Abner Jordan Ex-slave, 95 years.

"I wus bawn about 1832 an' I wus bawn at Staggsville, Marse Paul Cameron's place. I belonged
to Marse Paul. My pappy's name wus Obed an' my mammy wus Ella Jordan an' dey wus thirteen chillun
on our family.

"I wus de same age of Young Marse Benehan, I played wid him an' wus his body guard. Yes, suh,
Whare ever young Marse Benehan went I went too. I waited on him. Young Marse Benny run away
an' 'listed in de war, but Marse Paul done went an' brung him back kaze he wus too young to
go and fight de Yankees.

"Marse Paul had a heap of niggahs; he had five thousan'. When he meet dem in de road he wouldn'
know dem an' when he azed dem who dey wus an' who dey belonged to, dey' tell him dey belonged
to Marse Paul Cameron an' den he would say dat wus all right for dem to go right on.

"My pappy wus de blacksmith an' foreman for Marse Paul, an' he blew de horn for de other niggahs
to come in from de fiel' at night. Dey couldn' leave de plantation without Marse say dey could.

"When de war come de Yankees come to de house an' axed my mammy whare de folks done hid de
silver an' gol', an' dey say dey gwine to kill mammy if she didn' tell dem. But mammy say she
didn' know whare dey put it, an' dey would jus' have to kill her for she didn' know an' wouldn'
lie to keep dem from hurting her.

"De sojers stole seven or eight of de ho'ses an' foun' de meat an' stole dat, but dey didn'
burn none of de buildin's nor hurt any of us slaves.

"My pappy an' his family stayed wid Marse Paul five years after de surrender den we moved to
Hillsboro an' I's always lived 'roun' dese parts. I ain' never been out of North Carolina eighteen
months in my life. North Carolina is good enough for me." 324 Battle Street Raleigh, N.C.

"I am 'bout 80 years old. I am somewhere in my seventies, don't zackly know my age. I wus here
when de Yankees come an' I 'member seein' dem dressed in blue. I wus a nurse at dat time not
big enough to hold a baby but dey let me set by de cradle an' rock it.

"All my white folks dead an' all my people am dead an' I haint got no one to ax 'bout my age.
Dey had my age an' my mother's age in de Bible but dey am all dead out now an' I don't know
whur it is.

"My mother an' me belonged to the Councils. Dr. Kit Council who lived on a plantation in de
lower edge of Chatham County, 'bout three miles from New Hill.[3] My father belonged to de
Lamberts. Their plantation wus near Pittsboro in Chatham County. My father wus named Macon
Lambert an' his marster wus named At Lambert. Our missus wus named Caroline an' father's missus
wus named Beckie. My grandfather wus Phil Bell. He belonged to the Bells. They lived in Chatham
County. My grandmother wus named Peggy an' she belonged to de same family.

"We lived in little ole log houses. We called 'em cabins. They had stick an' dirt chimleys
wid one door to de house an' one window. It shet to lak a door.

"We did not have any gardens an' we never had any money of our own. We jest wurked fer de white
folks.

"We had plenty sumptin to eat an' it wus cooked good. My mother wus de cook an' she done it
right. Our clothes wus homemade but we had plenty shiftin' clothes. Course our shoes wus given
out at Christmas. We got one pair a year an' when dey wore out we got no more an' had to go
barefooted de rest of de time. You had to take care of dat pair uv shoes bekase dey wus all
you got a year. The slaves caught game sometime an' et it in de cabins, but dere wus not much
time fer huntin' dere wus so much wurk to do.

"Dere wus 'bout fifty slaves on de plantation, an' dey wurked from light till dark. I 'member
dey wurkin' till dark. Course I wus too small to 'member all 'bout it an' I don't 'member 'bout
de overseers. I never seen a slave whupped, but I 'members seein' dem carryin' slaves in droves
like cows. De white men who wus guardin' 'em walked in front an' some behind. I did not see
any chains. I never seen a slave sold an' I don't 'member ever seein' a jail fer slaves.

"Dere wus no books, or larnin' uv any kind allowed. You better not be ketched wid a book in
yore han's. Dat wus sumptin dey would git you fer. I ken read an' write a little but I learned
since de surrender. My mother tole me 'bout dat bein' 'ginst de rules of de white folks. I
'members it while I wus only a little gal. When de Yankees come thro'.

"Dere wus no churches on de plantation an' we wus not 'lowed to have prayer meetings in de
cabins, but we went to preachin' at de white folks church. I 'member dat. We set on de back
seat. I 'member dat.

"No slaves ever run away from our plantation cause marster wus good to us. I never heard of
him bein' 'bout to whup any of his niggers. Mother loved her white folks as long as she lived
an' I loved 'em too. No mister, we wus not mistreated. Mother tole me a lot 'bout Raw Head
an' Bloody Bones an' when I done mean, she say, 'Better not do dat any more Raw Head an' Bloody
Bones gwine ter git yo'.' Ha! ha! dey jest talked 'bout ghosts till I could hardly sleep at
nite, but de biggest thing in ghosts is somebody 'guised up tryin' to skeer you. Ain't no sich
thing as ghosts. Lot of niggers believe dere is do'.

"We stayed on at marsters when de surrender come cause when we wus freed we had nothin' an'
nowhere to go. Dats de truth. Mister, dats de truth. We stayed with marster a long time an'
den jest moved from one plantation to another. It wus like dis, a crowd of tenants would get
dissatisfied on a certain plantation, dey would move, an' another gang of niggers move in.
Dat wus all any of us could do. We wus free but we had nothin' 'cept what de marsters give us.

"When we got sick, you sees we stayed wid a doctor, he looked after us, but we had our herbs
too. We took sassafras tea, catnip an' horehound tea an' flag. Flag wus good to ease pain.
Jest make a tea of de flagroots an' drink it hot.

"I married Kit Lassiter in Chatham County an' I had seven chilluns. Three boys an' four girls.
All am dead but two. Two girls are livin'. One named Louie Finch, her husband dead. She stays
wid me an' supports me. She cooks an' supports me. My other livin' daughter is Venira McLean.
She lives across de street wid her husband. Her husband had a stroke an' ain't able to wurk
no more. Dey live on five dollars a week. Dey ain't able to help me now. I moved ter Raleigh
20 years ago. My husband died here.

"I heard 'bout de Ku Klux but dey never give our family no trouble cause we didn't give 'em
no cause to bother us. I don't know all 'bout slavery but I 'members dere wus a lot of big
fat greasy niggers goin' around, an' I reckin dey fared good or dey wouldn't a been so fat.
Dey got plenty to eat even if dey did wurk 'em.

"I believe slavery wus all rite whur slaves wus treated right. I haint got nuff edication to
tell you nothin' 'bout Lincoln an' dem udder men. Heard 'em say he come thro', reckon he did
too. I belong to the 'United Holiness Church'."

DAVE LAWSON EX-SLAVE

MY FATHER WHO KNEW THE PRINCIPLE CHARACTERS TOLD ME THIS STORY YEARS AGO

"Yes, suh, de wus' I knows 'bout slavery times is what dey tols me 'bout how come dey hung
my gran'mammy an' gran'pappy. Dey hung dem bof at de same time an' from de same lim' of de
tree, but dat was way back yonder befo' Mistah Lincoln come down here to set de niggers free.
My mammy wuzn' but six months ole den an' I wuzn' even bawn, but Aunt Becky tole me 'bout it
when I was ole enough to lissen.

"Dis ain' no nice tale you gwine hear. It's de truf, but 'tain't nice. De fus' time I heard
it I didn' sleep none for a week. Everytime I shut my eyes I seed Marse Drew Norwood wid dat
funnel in his mouf an' de hot steam blowin' up like a cloud 'roun' his wicked face an' skeered
eyes.

"Dey say my gran'pappy's Ole Marse was de meanes' white man de Lawd ever let breath de breaf
of life. His name was Marse Drew Norwood. He was de riches' lan' owner anywhare 'roun'. He
owned more lan' an' more niggers den anybody in Person or Granville counties. But he didn'
make his money wid no farm, no suh, he sho didn', he made his money buyin' an' sellin' niggers.
He bought dem cheap an' sold dem high. He would catch all de niggers dat run away from other
plantations an' keep dem in his lockup 'twell he fatten dem, den he would take dem way off
down in Georgia, Alabama or some place like dat an' sell dem for a big price. He would come
back wid his pockets runnin' over wid money. Some folks say he stold niggers to sell, but nobody
never could catch him.

"Marse Drew lived over here on de Virginia line 'tween Red Bank an' Blue Wing. He owned lan'
'cross de No'th Carolina line too an' lived close to Blue Wing. He treated his niggers so mean
dey was all de time runnin' off. If he caught dem he beat dem near 'bout to death. He did beat
Cindy Norwood to death one time kaze she run off to Marse Reuben Jones place an' axed him to
keep her. She got pizen in de cut places on her back an' had fits three days befo' de Lawd
took her. But Marse Drew jus' laugh an' say he didn' keer; dat she wuzn' no 'count nohow.

"I ain't never seed Marse Drew kaze I was bawn way after de niggers was freed, but dey tole
me he looked like a mad bull. He was short wid a big head set forward on his big shoulders.
His neck was so short dat he couldn' wear no collar; he jus' kept de neck bindin' of his shirt
pinned wid a diaper pin. De debil done lit a lamp an' set it burnin' in his eyes; his mouf
was a wicked slash cut 'cross his face, an' when he got mad his lips curled back from his teef
like a mad dog's. When he cracked his whip de niggers swinged an' de chillun screamed wid pain
when dat plaited thong bit in dey flesh. He beat Mistis too. Mis' Cary wuzn' no bigger den
a minute an' she skeered as a kildee of Marse Drew. She didn' live long dey say kaze Marse
Drew whipped her jus' befo' dey fus' baby wuz bawn.

"Marse Drew done whip Luzanne kaze she burnt de biscuits, an' Mis' Cary give her some salve
to rub on de cut places on her back. When Marse Drew foun' it out he got so mad dat he come
back to de big house an' tole Mis' Cary dat he gwine touch her up wid his whip kaze she give
Luzanne de salve, dat when he want his niggers doctored he gwine doctor dem hese'f, so he got
to use his lash a little bit to make her remember.
