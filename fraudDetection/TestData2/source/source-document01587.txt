Thus over-excited and topsy-turvy, the proletariat require only arms and a rallying-point.
The Girondins furnish both. Through a striking coincidence, one which shows that the plan was
concerted,[2384] they start three political engines at the same time. Just at the moment when,
through their deliberate saber-rattling, they made war inevitable, they invented popular insignia
and armed the poor. At the end of January, 1792, almost during one week, they announced their
ultimatum to Austria using a fixed deadline, they adopted the red woolen cap and began the
manufacture of pikes.--It is evident that pikes are of no use in the open field against cannon
and a regular army; accordingly the are intended for use in the interior and in towns. Let
the national-guard who can pay for his uniform, and the active citizen whose three francs of
direct tax gives him a privilege, own their guns; the stevedore, the market-porter, the lodger,
the passive citizen, whose poverty excludes them from voting must have their pikes, and, in
these insurrectionary times, a ballot is not worth a good pike wielded by brawny arms.--The
magistrate in his robes may issue any summons he pleases, but it will be rammed down his throat,
and, lest he should be in doubt of this he is made to know it beforehand. "The Revolution began
with pikes and pikes will finish it."[2385] "Ah," say the regulars of the Tuileries gardens,
"if the good patriots of the Champs de Mars only had had pikes like these the blue-coats (Lafayette's
guards) would not have had such a good hand!"--"They are to be used everywhere, wherever there
are enemies of the people, to the Château, if any can be found there!" They will override the
veto and make sure that the National Assembly will approve the good laws. To this purpose,
the Faubourg St. Antoine volunteers its pikes, and, to mark the use made of them, it complains
that "efforts are made to substitute an aristocracy of wealth for the omnipotence of inherited
rank." It demands "severe measures against the rascally hypocrites who, with the Constitution
in their hands, slaughter the people." It declares that "kings, ministers and a civil list
will pass away, but that the rights of man, national sovereignty and pikes will not pass away,"
and, by order of the president, the National Assembly thanks the petitioners, "for the advice
their zeal prompts them to give.

The leaders of the Assembly and the people armed with pikes unite against the rich, against
Constitutionalists, against the government, and henceforth, the Jacobin extremists march side
by side with the Girondins, both reconciled for the attack but reserved their right to disagree
until after the victory.

"The object of the Girondists[2386] is not a republic in name, but an actual republic through
a reduction of the civil lists to five millions, through the curtailment of most of the royal
prerogatives, through a change of dynasty of which the new head would be a sort of honorary
president of the republic to which they would assign an executive council appointed by the
Assembly, that is to say, by themselves." As to the Jacobin extremists we find no principle
with them but "that of a rigorous, absolute application of the Rights of Man. With the aid
of such a charter they aim at changing the laws and public officers every six months, at extending
their leveling process to every constituted authority, to all legal pre-eminence and to property.
The only regime they long for is the democracy of a contentious rabble... The vilest instruments,
professional agitators, brigands, fanatics, every sort of wretch, the hardened and armed poverty-stricken,
who, in wild disorder" march to the attack of property and to "universal pillage" in short,
barbarians of town and country "who form their ordinary army and never leave it inactive one
single day."--Under their universal, concerted and growing usurpation the substance of power
melts wholly away in the hand of the legal authorities; little by little, these are reduced
to vain counterfeits, while from one end of France, to the other, long before the final collapse,
the party, in the provinces as well as at Paris, substitutes, under the cry of public danger,
a government of might for the government of law.

(against the emigrants) was prepared in committee; it was expected that the emigrants would

report of the district administrators, and of the municipal officers of Brest, Nov. 27, 1791.--Letter
by M. de Marigny, commissary in the navy, at Brest, Nov. 28.--Letters by M. de la Jaille, etc.--M.
de la Jaille, sent to Brest to take command of the Dugay-Trouin, arrives there Nov.27. While
at dinner, twenty persons enter the room, and announce to him, "in the name of many others,"
that his presence in Brest is causing trouble, that he must leave, and that "he will not be
allowed to take command of a vessel." He replies, that he will leave the town, as soon as he
has finished his dinner. Another deputation follows, more numerous than the first one, and
insists on his leaving at once; and they act as his escort. He submits, is conducted to the
city gates, and there the escort leaves him. A mob attacks him, and "his body is covered with
contusions. He is rescued, with great difficulty, by six brave fellows, of whom one is a pork-dealer,
sent to bleed him on the spot. "This insurrection is due to an extra meeting of 'The Friends
of the constitution,' held the evening before in the theater, to which the public were invited."
M. de la Jaille, it must be stated, is not a proud aristocrat, but a sensible man, in the style
of Florian's and Berquin's heroes. But just pounded to a jelly, he writes to the president
of the "Friends of the Constitution," that, "could he have flown into the bosom of the club,
he would have gladly done so, to convey to it his grateful feelings. He had accepted his command
only at the solicitation of the Americans in Paris, and of the six commissioners recently arrived
from St. Domingo."--Mercure de France, April 14, article by Mallet du Pan "I have asked in
vain for the vengeance of the law against the assassins of M. de la Jaille. The names of the
authors of this assault in full daylight, to which thousands can bear witness, are known to
everybody in Brest. Proceedings have been ordered and begun, but the execution of the orders
is suspended. More potent than the law, the motionnaires, protectors of assassins, frighten
or paralyze its ministrants."]

(This troop) encamped in tents, but only because it lacked barracks and houses."--M.--, deputy
of the lower Rhine, says: "This army at Ettenheim is composed of about five or six hundred
poorly-clad, half-paid men, deserters of all nations, sleeping in tents, for lack of other
shelter, and armed with clubs, for lack of fire-arms and deserting every day, because money
is getting scarce. The second army, at Worms, under the command of a Condé, is composed of
three hundred gentlemen, and as many valets and grooms. I have to add, that the letters which
reach me from Strasbourg, containing extracts of inside information from Frankfort, Munich,
Regensburg, and Vienna, announce the most pacific intentions on the part of the different courts,
since receiving the notification of the king's submission." The number of armed emigrants increases,
but always remain very small (Moniteur, X. 678, letter of M. Delatouche, an eyewitness, Dec.
10). "I suppose that the number of emigrants scattered around on the territories of the grand-duke
of Baden, the bishop of Spires, the electorates, etc., amounts to scarcely 4,000 men."]

millions income, and who spends two-thirds of it in poor pay for an army of generals and a
small number of discontented soldiers... As to that princess (Catherine II.), whose dislike
of the French constitution is well known, and who is about as good looking as Elizabeth, she
cannot expect greater success than Elizabeth in the Dutch revolution." (Brissot, in this last
