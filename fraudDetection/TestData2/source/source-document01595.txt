The New Russia Speaks

An Appeal by Russian Authors, Artists, and Actors

[From the Russkia Vedomosti, No. 223, Sept. 28, (Oct. 11,) 1914, P. 6.]

We appeal to our country, we appeal to the whole civilized world.

What our heart and our reason refused to believe has come indisputably true, to the greatest
shame of humanity. Every new day brings new horrible proofs of the cruelty and the vandalism
of the Germans in the bloody clash of nations which we are witnessing, in that neutral slaughtering
of brothers provoked by the madness of these same Germans; in their vainglorious ambition to
rule the world with violence, they are throwing upon the scales of the world's justice nothing
but the sword. We fancy that Germany, oblivious of her past fame, has turned to the altars
of her cruel national gods whose defeat has been accomplished by the incarnation of the one
gracious god upon earth. Her warriors seem to have assumed the miserable duty of reminding
humanity of the latent vigor of the aboriginal beast within man, of the fact that even the
leading nations of civilization, by letting loose their ill-will, may easily fall back on an
equal footing with their forefathers--those half naked bands that fifteen centuries ago trampled
under their heavy feet the ancient inheritance of civilization. As in the days of yore, again
priceless productions of art, temples, and libraries perish in conflagration, whole cities
and towns are wiped off the face of the earth, rivers are overflowing with blood, through heaps
of cadavers savage men are hewing their path, and those whose lips are shouting in honor of
their criminal supreme commander are inflicting untold tortures and infamies upon defenseless
people, upon aged men and women, upon captives and wounded.

Let these horrible crimes be entered upon the Book of Fate with eternal letters! These crimes
shall awake within us one sole burning wish--to wrest the arms from the barbarous hands, to
deprive Germany forever of that brutal power upon whose achievement she has concentrated all
her thoughts. Already the seed of national pride and of hatred, widely sown by her, has awakened
a magnificent growth. This hatred may spread like wildfire among other nations, and then will
resound the voice of those blinded by wrath, the voice of those demanding vengeance, the voice
of those repudiating everything great and beautiful among the creations of the German genius
to the rejoicing and for the benefit of all mankind.

But let us remember the disastrous results of such a course--for the black crimes thrust by
Germany upon herself by drawing the sword, and the outrages in which she has indulged herself
while drunk with victory are the inevitable fruits of the darkness which she has voluntarily
entered. At present she is pursuing this course, encouraged even by her poets, scientists,
and social and political leaders.

Her adversaries, carrying peace and victory to their peoples, shall indeed be inspired solely
by holy motives.

Russia in Literature

By British Men of Letters.

     The following address, signed by a number of distinguished
     writers in Great Britain, and intended for publication in
     Russia, appeared in The London Times on Dec. 23, 1914.

To Our Colleagues in Russia:

At this moment, when your countrymen and ours are alike facing death for the deliverance of
Europe, we Englishmen of letters take the opportunity of uttering to you feelings which have
been in our hearts for many years. You yourselves perhaps hardly realize what an inspiration
Englishmen of the last two generations have found in your literature.

Many a writer among us can still call back, from ten or twenty or thirty years ago, the feeling
of delight and almost of bewilderment with which he read his first Russian novel. Perhaps it
was "Virgin Soil" or "Fathers and Sons," perhaps "War and Peace," or "Anna Karenina"; perhaps
"Crime and Punishment" or "The Idiot"; perhaps, again, it was the work of some author still
living. But many of us then felt, as our poet Keats felt on first reading Homer,

      "like some watcher of the skies
    When a new planet swims into his ken."

It was a strange world that opened before us, a world full of foreign names which we could
neither pronounce nor remember, of foreign customs and articles of daily life which we could
not understand. Yet beneath all the strangeness there was a deep sense of having discovered
a new home, of meeting our unknown kindred, of finding expressed great burdens of thought which
had lain unspoken and half-realized at the depths of our own minds. The books were very different
one from another, sometimes they were mutually hostile; yet we found in all some quality which
made them one, and made us at one with them. We will not attempt to analyze that quality. It
was, perhaps, in part, that deep Russian tenderness, which never derides but only pities and
respects the unfortunate; in part that simple Russian sincerity which never fears to see the
truth and to express it; but most of all it was that ever-present sense of spiritual values,
behind the material and utterly transcending the material, which enables Russian literature
to move so naturally in a world of the spirit, where there are no barriers between the ages
and the nations, but all mankind is one.

And they call you "barbarians"! The fact should make us ask again what we mean by the words
"culture" and "civilization." Critics used once to call our Shakespeare a barbarian, and might
equally well give the same name to Aeschylus or Isaiah. All poets and prophets are in this
sense barbarians, that they will not measure life by the standards of external "culture." And
it is at a time like this, when the material civilization of Europe seems to have betrayed
us and shown the lie at its heart, that we realize that the poets and prophets are right, and
that we must, like them and like your great writers, once more see life with the simplicity
of the barbarian or the child, if we are to regain our peace and freedom and build up a better
civilization on the ruins of this that is crumbling.

That task, we trust, will some day lie before us. When at last our victorious fleets and armies
meet together, and the allied nations of East and West set themselves to restore the well-being
of many millions of ruined homes, France and Great Britain will assuredly bring their large
contributions of good-will and wisdom, but your country will have something to contribute which
is all its own. It is not only because of your valor in war and your achievements in art, science,
and letters that we rejoice to have you for allies and friends; it is for some quality in Russia
herself, something both profound and humane, of which these achievements are the outcome and
the expression.

You, like us, entered upon this war to defend a weak and threatened nation, which trusted you,
against the lawless aggression of a strong military power; you, like us, have continued it
as a war of self-defense and self-emancipation. When the end comes and we can breathe again,
we will help one another to remember the spirit in which our allied nations took up arms, and
thus work together in a changed Europe to protect the weak, to liberate the oppressed, and
to bring eventual healing to the wounds inflicted on suffering mankind both by ourselves and
our enemies.

With assurances of our friendship and gratitude, we sign ourselves,

Russia and Europe's War

By Paul Vinogradoff.

     The following letter to The London Times by Paul Vinogradoff,
     Corpus Professor of Jurisprudence at Oxford University,
     appeared on Sept. 14, 1914. Prof. Vinogradoff was invited to
     return to Russia a few years ago to become a Minister of
     State, but on going there he found the Ministry not liberal
     enough for him, and returned to Oxford.

To the Editor of The Times:

SIR: I hope you may see your way to publish the following somewhat lengthy statement on one
of the burning questions of the day.

In this time of crisis, when the clash of ideas seems as fierce as the struggle of the hosts,
it is the duty of those who possess authentic information on one or the other point in dispute
to speak out firmly and clearly. I should like to contribute some observations on German and
Russian conceptions in matters of culture. I base my claim to be heard on the fact that I have
had the privilege of being closely connected with Russian, German, and English life. As a Russian
Liberal, who had to give up an honorable position at home for the sake of his opinions, I can
hardly be suspected of subserviency to the Russian bureaucracy.

I am struck by the insistence with which the Germans represent their cause in this worldwide
struggle as the cause of civilization as opposed to Muscovite barbarism; and I am not sure
that some of my English friends do not feel reluctant to side with the subjects of the Czar
against the countrymen of Harnack and Eucken. One would like to know, however, since when did
the Germans take up this attitude? They were not so squeamish during the "war of emancipation,"
which gave birth to modern Germany. At that time the people of Eastern Prussia were anxiously
waiting for the appearance of Cossacks as heralds of the Russian hosts who were to emancipate
them from the yoke of Napoleon. Did the Prussians and Austrians reflect on the humiliation
of an alliance with the Muscovites, and on the superiority of the code civil when the Russian
Guard at Kulm stood like a rock against the desperate onslaughts of Vandamme? Perhaps by this
time the inhabitants of Berlin have obliterated the bas-relief in the Alley of Victories, representing
Prince William of Prussia, the future victor of Sedan, seeking safety within the square of
the Kaluga regiment! Russian blood has flowed in numberless battles in the cause of the Germans
and Austrians. The present Armageddon might perhaps have been avoided if Emperor Nicholas I.
had left the Hapsburg monarchy to its own resources in 1849, and had not unwisely crushed the
independence of Hungary. Within our memory, the benevolent neutrality of Russia guarded Germany
in 1870 from an attack in the rear by its opponents of Sadowa. Are all such facts to be explained
away on the ground that the despised Muscovites may be occasionally useful as "gun meat," but
are guilty of sacrilege if they take up a stand against German taskmasters in "shining armor"?
The older generations of Germany had not yet reached that comfortable conclusion. The last
recommendation which the founder of the German Empire made on his deathbed to his grandson
was to keep on good terms with that Russia which is now proclaimed to be a debased mixture
of Byzantine, Tartar, and Muscovite abominations.

Fortunately, the course of history does not depend on the frantic exaggerations of partisans.
The world is not a classroom in which docile nations are distributed according to the arbitrary
standards of German pedagogues. Europe has admired the patriotic resistance of the Spanish,
Tyrolese, and Russian peasants to the enlightened tyranny of Napoleon. There are other standards
of culture besides proficiency in research and aptitude for systematic work. The massacre of
Louvain, the hideous brutality of the Germans--as regards non-combatants--to mention only one
or two of the appalling occurrences of these last weeks--have thrown a lurid light on the real
character of twentieth-century German culture. "By their fruits ye shall know them," said our
Lord, and the saying which He aimed at the Scribes and Pharisees of His time is indeed applicable
to the proud votaries of German civilization today. Nobody wishes to underestimate the services
rendered by the German people to the cause of European progress, but those who have known Germany
during the years following on the achievements of 1870 have watched with dismay the growth
of that arrogant conceit which the Greeks called ubris. The cold-blooded barbarity advocated
by Bernhardi, the cynical view taken of international treaties and of the obligations of honor
by the German Chancellor--these things reveal a spirit which it would be difficult indeed to
describe as a sign of progress.

One of the effects of such a frame of mind is to strike the victim of it with blindness. This
symptom has been manifest in the stupendous blunders of German diplomacy. The successors of
Bismarck have alienated their natural allies, such as Italy and Rumania, and have driven England
into this war against the evident intentions of English Radicals. But the Germans have misconceived
even more important things--they set out on their adventure in the belief that England would
be embarrassed by civil war and unable to take any effective part in the fray; and they had
to learn something which all their writers had not taught them--that there is a nation's spirit
watching over England's safety and greatness, a spirit at whose mighty call all party differences
and racial strifes fade into insignificance. In the same way they had reckoned on the unpreparedness
of Russia, in consequence of internal dissensions and administrative weakness, without taking
heed of the love of all Russians for Russia, of their devotion to the long-suffering giant
whose life is throbbing in their veins. Instead of that they were confronted with soldiers
of the same type as those whom Frederick the Great and Napoleon admired, led at last by chiefs
worthy of their men. And behind these soldiers they discovered a nation. Do they realize now
what a force they have awakened? Do they understand that a steadfast, indomitable resolution,
despising all theatrical display, is moving Russia's hosts? Even if the Russian Generals had
proved mediocre, even if many disappointing days had been in store, the nation would not belie
its history. It has seen more than one conquering army go down before it--the Tartars and the
Poles, the Swedes of Charles XII., the Prussians of Frederick the Great, the Grand Army of
Napoleon were not less formidable than the Kaiser's army, but the task of mastering a united
Russia proved too much for each one of them. The Germans counted on the fratricidal feud between
Poles and Russians, on the resentment of the Jews, on the Mohammedan sympathies with Turkey,
and so forth. They had to learn too late that the Jews had rallied around the country of their
hearths, and that the best of them cannot believe that Russia will continue to deny them the
measure of justice and humanity which the leaders of Russian thought have long acknowledged
to be due to them. More important still, the Germans have read the Grand Duke's appeal to the
Poles and must have heard of the manner in which it was received in Poland, of the enthusiastic
support offered to the Russian cause. If nothing else came of this great historical upheaval
but the reconciliation of the Russians and their noble kinsmen the Poles, the sacrifices which
this crisis demands would not be too great a price to pay for the result.

But the hour of trial has revealed other things. It has appealed to the best feelings and the
best elements of the Russian Nation. It has brought out in a striking manner the fundamental
tendency of Russian political life and the essence of Russian culture, which so many people
have been unable to perceive on account of the chaff on the surface. Russia has been going
through a painful crisis. In the words of the Manifesto of Oct. 17, (30,) 1905, the outward
casing of her administration had become too narrow and oppressive for the development of society
with its growing needs, its altered perceptions of rights and duties, its changed relations
between Government and people. The result was that deep-seated political malaise which made
itself felt during the Japanese war, when society at large refused to take any interest in
the fate of the army; the feverish rush for "liberties" after the defeat; the subsequent reign
of reaction and repression, which has cast such a gloom over Russian life during these last
years. But the effort of the national struggle had dwarfed all these misunderstandings and
misfortunes as in Great Britain the call of the common fatherland has dwarfed the dispute between
Unionists and Home Rulers. Russian parties have not renounced their aspirations; Russian Liberals
in particular believe in self-government and the rule of law as firmly as ever. But they have
realized as one man that this war is not an adventure engineered by unscrupulous ambition,
but a decisive struggle for independence and existence; and they are glad to be arrayed in
close ranks with their opponents from the Conservative side. A friend, a Liberal like myself,
writes to me from Moscow: "It is a great, unforgettable time; we are happy to be all at one!"
And from the ranks of the most unfortunate of Russia's children, from the haunts of the political
exiles in Paris, comes the news that Bourtzeff, one of the most prominent among the revolutionary
leaders, has addressed an appeal to his comrades urging them to stand by their country to the
utmost of their power.
