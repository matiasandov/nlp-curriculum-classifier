IN THE BROODING WILD

CHAPTER I.

ON THE MOUNTAINSIDE

To the spirit which broods over the stupendous solitudes of the northern Rockies, the soul
of man, with all its complex impulses, is but so much plastic material which it shapes to its
own inscrutable ends. For the man whose lot is cast in the heart of these wilds, the drama
of life usually moves with a tremendous simplicity toward the sudden and sombre tragedy of
the last act. The titanic world in which he lives closes in upon him and makes him its own.
For him, among the ancient watch-towers of the earth, the innumerable interests and activities
of swarming cities, the restless tides and currents of an eager civilization, take on the remoteness
of a dream. The peace or war of nations is less to him than the battles of Wing and Fur. His
interests are all in that world over which he seeks to rule by the law of trap and gun, and
in the war of defence which he wages against the aggression of the elements. He returns insensibly
to the type of the primitive man, strong, patient, and enduring.

High up on the mountainside, overlooking a valley so deep and wide as to daze the brain of
the gazing human, stands a squat building. It seems to have been crushed into the slope by
the driving force of the vicious mountain storms to which it is open on three sides. There
is no shelter for it. It stands out bravely to sunshine and storm alike with the contemptuous
indifference of familiarity. It is a dugout, and, as its name implies, is built half in the
ground. Its solitary door and single parchment-covered window overlook the valley, and the
white path in front where the snow is packed hard by the tramp of dogs and men, and the runners
of the dog-sled. Below the slope bears away to the woodlands. Above the hut the overshadowing
mountain rises to dazzling heights; and a further, but thin, belt of primeval forest extends
up, up, until the eternal snows are reached and the air will no longer support life. Even to
the hardy hunters, whose home this is, those upper forests are sealed chapters in Nature's story.

Below the dugout, and beyond the valley, lie countless lesser hills, set so closely that their
divisions are lost in one smooth, dark expanse of forest. Blackened rifts are visible here
and there, but they have little meaning, and only help to materialize what would otherwise
wear an utterly ghostly appearance. The valley in front is so vast that its contemplation from
the hillside sends a shudder of fear through the heart. It is dark, dreadfully dark and gloomy,
although the great stretch of pine forest, which reaches to its uttermost confines, bears upon
its drooping branches the white coat of winter.

The valley is split by a river, now frozen to its bed. But, from the hut door, the rift which
marks its course in the dark carpet cannot be seen.

In the awesome view no life is revealed. Each individual thing, like the human body, must be determined
to existence and action by another individual thing in a certain and determinate manner, and
this again by another, and so on ad infinitum.

But we have demonstrated in the preceding proposition, from this common property of individual
things, that we have but a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of our own body; therefore
the same conclusion is to be drawn about the duration of individual things, that is to say, that
we can have but a very inadequate knowledge of it.

Hence it follows that all individual things are contingent and corruptible, for we can have no
adequate knowledge concerning their duration and this is what is
to be understood by us as their contingency and capability of corruption;
for there is no other contingency but this. Then, for awhile, all is still again. But the coming of that breath from the
mountain top has made a difference in the outlook. Something strange has happened. One looks
about and cannot tell what it is. It may be that the air is colder; it may be that the daylight
has changed its tone; it may be that the sunlit scene is changed as the air fills with sparkling,
diamond frost particles. Something has happened.

Suddenly a dismal howl splits the air, and its echoes intensify the gloom. Another howl succeeds
it, and then the weird cry is taken up by other voices.

And ere the echoes die out another breath comes down from the hilltop, a breath less patient;
angry with a biting fierceness which speaks of patience exhausted and a spirit of retaliation.

It catches up the loose snow as it comes and hurls it defiantly at every obstruction with the
viciousness of an exasperated woman. Now it shakes the dugout, and, as it passes on, shrieks
invective at the world over which it rushes, and everything it touches feels the bitter lash
of the whipping snow it bears upon its bosom. Again come the strange howls of the animal world,
but they sound more distant and the echoes are muffled, for those who cry out have sought the
woodland shelter, where the mountain breath exhausts itself against the countless legions of
the pines.

Ere the shriek has died out, another blast comes, down the mountainside, and up rises the fine-powdered
snow like a thin fog. From the valley a rush of wind comes up to meet it, and the two battle
for supremacy. While the conflict rages fresh clouds of snow rise in other directions and rush
to the scene of action. Encountering each other on the way they struggle together, each intolerant
of interference, until the shrieking is heard on every hand, and the snow fog thickens, and
the dull sun above grows duller, and the lurid "sun dogs" look like evil coals of fire burning
in the sky.

Now, from every direction, the wind tears along in a mad fury. The forest tops sway as with
the roll of some mighty sea swept by the sudden blast of a tornado. In the rage of the storm
the woodland giants creak out their impotent protests. The wind battles and tears at everything,
there is no cessation in its onslaught.

And as the fight waxes the fog rises and a grey darkness settles over the valley. The forest
is hidden, the hills are gone, the sun is obscured, and a fierce desolation reigns. Darker
and darker it becomes as the blizzard gains force. And the cries of the forest beasts add to
the chaos and din of the mountain storm.

The driving cold penetrates, with the bite of invisible arrows, to the interior of the dugout.
The two men who sit within pile up the fuel in the box stove which alone makes life possible
for them in such weather. The roof groans and bends beneath the blast. Under the rattling door
a thin carpet of snow has edged its way in, while through the crack above it a steady rain
of moisture falls as the snow encounters the rising heat of the stifling atmosphere.

"I knew it 'ud come, Nick," observed one of the men, as he shut the stove, after carefully
packing several cord-wood sticks within its insatiable maw.

He was of medium height but of large muscle. His appearance was that of a man in the prime
of life. His hair, above a face tanned and lined by exposure to the weather, was long and grey,
as was the beard which curled about his chin. He was clad in a shirt of rough-tanned buckskin
and trousers of thick moleskin. His feet were shod with moccasins which were brilliantly beaded.
Similar bead-work adorned the front of the weather-proof shirt.

His companion was a slightly younger and somewhat larger man. The resemblance he bore to his
comrade indicated the relationship between them. They were brothers.

Ralph and Nicol Westley were born and bred in that dugout. Their father and mother were long
since dead, dying in the harness of the toil they had both loved, and which they bequeathed
to their children. These two men had never seen the prairie. They had never left their mountain
fastnesses. They had never even gone south to where the railway bores its way through the Wild.

They had been born to the life of the trapper and knew no other. They lived and enjoyed their
lives, for they were creatures of Nature who understood and listened when she spoke. They had
no other education. The men lived together harmoniously, practically independent of all other
human companionship.

At long intervals, when pelts had accumulated and supplies had run low, they visited the cabin
of an obscure trader. Otherwise they were cut off from the world and rejoiced in their isolation.

"Yes, we've had the warnin' this week past," rejoined Nick solemnly, as he affectionately polished
the butt of his rifle with a rag greased with bear's fat. "Them 'patch' winds at sunrise an'
sunset ain't sent fer nothin'. I 'lows Hell's hard on the heels o' this breeze. When the wind
quits there'll be snow, an' snow means us bein' banked in. Say, she's boomin'. Hark to her.
You can hear her tearin' herself loose from som'eres up on the hilltops."

Nick looked round the hut as though expecting to see the storm break through the walls of their
shelter. A heavy storm always affected the superstitious side of these men's natures. A blizzard
to them was as the Evil Spirit of the mountains. They always possessed the feeling, somewhere
deep down in their hearts, that the attack of a storm was directed against them. And the feeling
was a mute acknowledgment that they were interlopers in Nature's most secret haunts.

Ralph had planted himself upon an upturned bucket, and sat with his hands thrust out towards
the stove. He was smoking, and his eyes were directed in a pensive survey at a place where
the black iron of the stove was steadily reddening.

Presently he looked up.

"Ha' ye fed the dogs, lad?" he asked.

"Ay."

The two relapsed into silence. The creaking of the hut was like the protest of a wooden ship
riding a heavy storm at sea. The men shifted their positions with every fresh burst which struck
their home; it was as though they personally felt each shock, and their bones ached with the
strain of battle. The smoke curled up slowly from Ralph's pipe and a thin cloud hovered just
beneath the roof. The red patch on the stove widened and communicated itself to the stovepipe.
Presently the trapper leaned forward, and, closing the damper, raked away the ashes with a
chip of wood.

Nick looked up and laid his gun aside, and, rising, stepped over to the stove.

"Makes ye feel good to hear the fire roarin' when it's stormin' bad. Ther' ain't no tellin'
when this'll let up." He jerked his head backward to imply the storm.

"It's sharp. Mighty sharp," replied his brother. "Say--"

He broke off and bent his head in an attitude of keen attention. He held his pipe poised in
his right hand, whilst his eyes focused themselves on a side of bacon which hung upon the wall.

Nick had turned towards the door. His attitude was intent also; he, too, was listening acutely.

The howling elements continued to beat furiously upon the house and the din was appalling,
but these two men, keen-eared, trained to the life of their mountains, had heard a sound which
was not the storm, nor of the forest creatures doling their woful cries beneath the shelter
of the woods.

Slowly Ralph's eyes moved from the bacon and passed over the smoke stained wooden wall of the
hut. Nor did they pause again until they looked into the eyes of his brother. Here they fixed
themselves and the working brains of the two men seemed to communicate one with the other.
Neither of them was likely to be mistaken. To hear a sound in those wilds was to recognize
it unerringly.

"A cry," said Nick.

"Some 'un out in the storm," replied Ralph.

"A neche."

Ralph shook his head.

"A neche would 'a' know'd this was comin'. He'd 'a' made camp. 'Tain't a neche. Hark!"

The beat of the storm seemed to drown all other sounds, and yet those two men listened. It
is certain that what they heard would have been lost to most ears.

Ralph rose deliberately. There was no haste, nor was there any hesitation. His intention was
written on his face.

"The lifeline," he said briefly.

Out into the awful storm the two men plunged a few moments later. There was no thought of their
own comfort in their minds. They had heard a cry--the cry of a human being, and they were prepared
to lend such aid as lay in their power. They did not pause to wonder at a voice other than
their own in those regions. Some one was caught in the storm, and they knew that such a disaster
meant certain death to the poor wretch if they did not go to the rescue. The terror of the
blizzard was expressed in the significant words Ralph had uttered. Even these hardy men of
the wild dared not venture beyond their door without the lifeline which was always kept handy.

With their furs covering every part of them but their eyes and noses they plunged into the
fog of blinding snow. They could see nothing around them--they could not even see their own
feet. Each gripped a long pole, and used his other hand to grasp the line.

They moved down the beaten path with certain step. Three yards from the dugout and the house
was obscured. The wind buffeted them from every direction, and they were forced to bend their
heads in order to keep their eyes open.

The whole attack of the wind now seemed to centre round those two struggling human creatures.
It is the way of the blizzard. It blows apparently from every direction, and each obstacle
in its chaotic path becomes the special object of its onslaught.

A forceful gust, too sudden to withstand, would drive them, blind, groping, from their path;
and a moment later they would be hurled like shuttlecocks in the opposite direction. They staggered
under the burden of the storm, and groped for the solid foothold of the track with their poles;
and so they slowly gained their way.

Their strenuous life had rendered them uncomplaining, and they laboured in silence. No emergency
but they were ready to meet with a promptness that was almost automatic. A slip upon the declining
path and the fall was checked by the aid of the poles which both men used as skilfully as any
guide upon the Alps. These contests with the elements were as much a part of their lives as
were their battles with the animal world.

After awhile Ralph halted; he thrust his pole deep into the snow and held his position by its
aid. Then, throwing up his head, as might any wolf, he opened his throat and uttered a prolonged
cry. It rose high above the storm in a manner which only the cry of a mountain or forest bred
man can. It rushed forth borne unwillingly upon the shrieking wind, and its sound almost instantly
died out of the ears of the sender. But the men knew it was travelling. Nick followed his brother's
example, and then Ralph gave out the mountain call again.

Then they waited, listening. A sound, faint and far off, came in answer to their cries. It
was the human cry they had heard before.

Ralph moved forward with Nick hard upon his heels. The line "paid out," and the points of the
poles sought the hard earth beneath the snow. They gained their way in spite of the storm,
foot by foot, yard by yard. And, at short intervals, they paused and sent their cries hurtling
upon the vicious wind. And to every cry came an answer, and every answer sounded nearer.

They were on the only open track in the valley, and both men knew that whoever was out in that
storm must be somewhere upon it. Therefore they kept on.

"The line's gettin' heavy," said Nick presently.

"It's only a little further," replied Ralph.

"By the weight o' the line, I reckon ther' ain't more'n fifty feet more."

"Maybe it'll be 'nough."

And Ralph was right.

Ten yards further on they almost fell over a dark mass lying in the snow. It was a huddled
heap, as of a creature striving to shut out the attack of the storm. It was the attitude of
one whose heart quails with dread. It was the attitude of one, who, in possession of all his
faculties and strength, lies down to die. Rank cowardice was in that fur-clad figure, and the
cries for help were as the weeping of a fear-filled soul.

Ralph was down upon his knees in a moment, and all that the still figure conveyed was at once
apparent to him. His hand fell heavily upon the man's shoulder, and he turned him over to look
at his face.

The victim of the storm groaned; as yet he was unable to realize that help was at hand. Then,
after several rough shakes, his head emerged from the folds of an enormous storm-collar.

As he looked up at the faces bending over him the two trappers uttered exclamations.

"It's the trader!" said Ralph.

"Victor Gagnon!" exclaimed Nick.

CHAPTER II.

WHICH TELLS OF THE WHITE SQUAW

The stormy day was followed by an equally stormy night. Inside the dugout it was possible,
in a measure, to forget the terrors of the blizzard raging outside. The glowing stove threw
out its comforting warmth, and even the rank yellow light of the small oil lamp, which was
suspended from one of the rafters, gave a cheering suggestion of comfort to the rough interior.
Besides, there were within food and shelter and human association, and the mind of man is easily
soothed into a feeling of security by such surroundings.

The trappers had brought the rescued trader to the shelter of their humble abode; they had
refreshed him with warmth and good food; they had given him the comfort of a share of their
blankets, the use of their tobacco, all the hospitality they knew how to bestow.

The three men were ranged round the room in various attitudes of repose. All were smoking heavily.
On the top of the stove stood a tin billy full to the brim of steaming coffee, the scent of
which, blending with the reek of strong tobacco, came soothingly to their nostrils.

Victor Gagnon was lying full length upon a pile of outspread blankets. His face was turned
towards the stove, and his head was supported upon one hand. He looked none the worse for his
adventure in the storm. He was a small, dark man of the superior French half-breed class. He
had a narrow, ferret face which was quite good looking in a mean small way. He was clean shaven,
and wore his straight black hair rather long. His clothes, now he had discarded his furs, showed
to be of orthodox type, and quite unlike those of his hosts. He was a trader who kept a store
away to the northeast of the dugout. He worked in connection with one of the big fur companies
of the East, as an agent for the wholesale house dealing directly with trappers and Indians.

This was the man with whom the Westleys traded, and they were truly glad that chance had put
it in their power to befriend him. Their associations with him, although chiefly of a business
nature, were decidedly friendly.

Now they were listening to his slow, quiet, thoughtful talk. He was a man who liked talking,
but he always contrived that his audience should be those who gave information. These two backwoodsmen,
simple as the virgin forests to which they belonged, were not keen enough to observe this.
Victor Gagnon understood such men well. His life had been made up of dealings with the mountain
world and those who peopled it.

Nick, large and picturesque, sat tailor-fashion on his blankets, facing the glowing stove with
the unblinking, thoughtful stare of a large dog. Ralph was less luxurious. He was propped upon
his upturned bucket, near enough to the fire to dispense the coffee without rising from his seat.

"Yup. It's a long trail for a man to make travellin' light an' on his lone," Victor was saying,
while his black eyes flashed swiftly upon his companions. "It's not a summer picnic, I guess.
Maybe you're wonderin' what I come for."

He ceased speaking as a heavy blast shook the roof, and set the lamp swinging dangerously.

"We're good an' pleased to see you--" began Ralph, in his deliberate way; but Victor broke
in upon him at once.

"O' course you are. It's like you an' Nick there to feel that way. But human natur's human
natur', an' maybe som'eres you are jest wonderin' what brought me along. Anyway, I come with
a red-hot purpose. Gee! but it's blowin'. I ain't like to forget this storm." Gagnon shuddered
as he thought of his narrow escape.

"Say," he went on, with an effort at playfulness. "You two boys are pretty deep--pretty deep."
He repeated himself reflectively. "An' you seem so easy and free, too. I do allow I'd never
'a' thought it. Ha, ha!"

He turned a smiling face upon his two friends and looked quizzically from one to the other.
His look was open, but behind it shone something else. This is a vile conspiracy amongst my enemies.
Some of my wicked rivals, unable to submit to my superior attractions,
have planned this scheme on purpose to mortify me, but they shall
find themselves defeated in their atrocious designs."

 We ain't good at guessin'."

Ralph had looked steadily at the trader while he was speaking; now he turned slowly and poured
out three pannikins of coffee. During the operation he turned his visitor's words over in his
mind and something of their meaning came to him. He passed a tin to each of the others and
sipped meditatively from his own, while his eyes became fixed upon the face of the half-breed.

"Ther' was some fine pelts in that last parcel o' furs you brought along," continued Victor.
"Three black foxes. But your skins is always the best I get."

Ralph nodded over his coffee, whilst he added his other hand to the support of the tin. Nick
watched his brother a little anxiously. He, too, felt uneasy.

"It's cur'us that you git more o' them black pelts around here than anybody else higher up
north. You're a sight better hunters than any durned neche on the Peace River. An' them hides
is worth more'n five times their weight in gold. You're makin' a pile o' bills. Say, you keep
them black pelts snug away wi' other stuff o' value."

Gagnon paused and took a deep draught at his coffee.

"Say," he went on, with a knowing smile. "I guess them black foxes lived in a gold mine--"

He broke off and watched the effect of his words. The others kept silence, only their eyes
betrayed them. The smoke curled slowly up from their pipes and hung in a cloud about the creaking
roof. The fire burned fiercely in the stove, and with every rush of wind outside there came
a corresponding roar of flame up the stovepipe.

"Maybe you take my meanin'," said the Breed, assured that his words had struck home. "Them
black furs was chock full o' grit--an' that grit was gold-dust. Guess that dust didn't grow
in them furs; an' I 'lows foxes don't fancy a bed o' such stuff. Say, boys, you've struck gold
in this layout o' yours. That's what's brought me out in this all-fired storm."

The two brothers exchanged rapid glances and then Ralph spoke for them both.

"You're smart, Victor. That's so. We've been workin' a patch o' pay-dirt for nigh on to twelve
month. But it's worked out; clear out to the bedrock. It wa'n't jest a great find, though I
'lows, while it lasted, we took a tidy wage out o' it--"

"An' what might you call a 'tidy wage'?" asked the Breed, in a tone of disappointment. He knew
these men so well that he did not doubt their statement; but he was loth to relinquish his
dream. He had come there to make an arrangement with them. If they had a gold working he considered
that, provided he could be of use to them, there would be ample room for him in it. This had
been the object of his hazardous journey. And now he was told that it had worked out. He loved
gold, and the news came as a great blow to him.

He watched Ralph keenly while he awaited his reply, sitting up in his eagerness.

"Seventy-fi' dollars a day," Ralph spoke without enthusiasm.

Victor's eyes sparkled.

"Each?" he asked.

"No, on shares."

There was another long silence while the voice of the storm was loud without. Victor Gagnon
was thinking hard, but his face was calm, his expression almost indifferent. More coffee was
drunk, and the smoke continued to rise.

"I 'lows you should know if it's worked out, sure."

The sharp eyes seemed to go through Ralph.

"Dead sure. We ain't drawn a cent's worth o' colour out o' it fer nine months solid."

"'Tain't worth prospectin' fer the reef?"

"Can't say. I ain't much when it comes to prospectin' gold. I knows the colour when I sees it."

Nick joined in the conversation at this point.

"Guess you'd a notion you fancied bein' in it," he said, smiling over at the Breed.

Victor laughed a little harshly.

"That's jest what."

The two brothers nodded. This they had understood.

"I'd have found all the plant fer big work," went on the trader eagerly. "I'd have found the
cash to do everything. I'd have found the labour. An' us three 'ud have made a great syndicate.
We'd 'a' run it dead secret. Wi' me in it we could 'a' sent our gold down to the bank by the
dogs, an', bein' as my shack's so far from here, no one 'ud ever 'a' found whar the yeller
come from. It 'ud 'a' been a real fine game--a jo-dandy game. An' it's worked clear out?" he
asked again, as though to make certain that he had heard aright.

"Bottomed right down to the bedrock. Maybe ye'd like to see fer yourself?"

"Guess I ken take your word, boys; ye ain't the sort to lie to a pal. I'm real sorry." He paused
and shifted his position. Then he went on with a slightly cunning look. "I 'lows you're like
to take a run down to Edmonton one o' these days. A feller mostly likes to make things hum
when he's got a good wad." Gagnon's tone was purely conversational. But his object must have
been plain to any one else. He was bitterly resentful at the working out of the placer mine,
and his anger always sent his thoughts into crooked channels. His nature was a curious one;
he was honest enough, although avaricious, while his own ends were served. It was different
when he was balked.

"We don't notion a city any," said Nick, simply.

"Things is confusin' to judge by the yarns folks tell," added Ralph, with a shake of his shaggy
head.

"Them fellers as comes up to your shack, Victor, mostly talks o' drink, an' shootin', an'--an'
women," Nick went on. "Guess the hills'll do us. Maybe when we've done wi' graft an' feel that
it 'ud be good to laze, likely we'll go down an' buy a homestead on the prairie. Maybe, I sez."

Nick spoke dubiously, like a man who does not convince himself.

"Hah, that's 'cause you've never been to a city," said the Breed sharply.

"Jest so," observed Ralph quietly, between the puffs at his pipe.

Gagnon laughed silently. His eyes were very bright and he looked from one brother to the other
with appreciation. An idea had occurred to him and he was mentally probing the possibilities
of carrying it out. What he saw pleased him, for he continued to smile.

"Well, well, maybe you're right," he said indulgently. Then silence fell.

Each man was rapt in his own thoughts, and talk without a definite object was foreign to at
least two of the three. The brothers were waiting in their stolid Indian fashion for sleep
to come. The trader was thinking hard behind his lowered eyelids, which were almost hidden
by the thick smoke which rose from his pipe.

The fire burned down and was replenished. Ralph rose and gathered the pannikins and threw them
into a biscuit-box. Then he laid out his blankets while Nick went over and bolted the door.
Still the trader did not look up. When the two men had settled themselves comfortably in their
blankets the other at last put his pipe away.

"No," he said, as he too negotiated his blankets, "guess we want good sound men in these hills,
anyway. I reckon you've no call to get visitin' the prairie, boys; you're the finest hunters
I've ever known. D'ye know the name your shack here goes by among the down-landers? They call
it the 'Westley Injun Reserve.'"

"White Injuns," said Nick, with a grin followed by a yawn.

"That's what," observed Victor, curling himself up in his blankets. "I've frequent heard tell
of the White Squaw, but White Injuns sounds like as it wa'n't jest possible. Howsum, they call
you real white buck neches, an' I 'lows ther' ain't no redskin in the world to stan' beside
you on the trail o' a fur."

The two men laughed at their friend's rough tribute to their attainments. Ralph was the quieter
of the two, but his appreciation was none the less. He was simple-hearted, but he knew his
own worth when dealing with furs. Nick laughed loudly. It tickled him to be considered a White
Indian at the calling which was his, for his whole pride was in his work.

Nick was not without a romantic side to his nature. The life of the mountains had imbued him
with a half-savage superstition which revelled in the uncanny lore of such places. This was
not the first time he had heard of a White Squaw, and, although he did not believe such a phenomenon
possible, it appealed seductively to his love of the marvellous. Victor had turned over to
sleep, but Nick was very wide awake and interested. He could not let such an opportunity slip.
Victor was good at a yarn. And, besides, Victor knew more of the mountain-lore than any one
else. So he roused the Breed again.

"You was sayin' about a White Squaw, Victor," he said, in a shamefaced manner. His bronzed
cheeks were deeply flushed and he glanced over at his brother to see if he were laughing at
him. Ralph was lying full length upon his blankets and his eyes were closed, so he went on.
"Guess I've heerd tell of a White Squaw. Say, ain't it that they reckon as she ain't jest a
human crittur?"

Victor opened his eyes and rolled over on his back. If there was one weakness he had it was
the native half-breed love of romancing. He was ever ready to yarn. He revelled in it when
he had a good audience. Nick was the very man for him, simple, honest, superstitious. So he
sat up and answered readily enough.

"That's jest how, pard. An' it ain't a yarn neither. It's gospel truth. I know."

"Hah!" ejaculated Nick, while a strange feeling passed down his spine. Ralph's eyes had slowly
opened, but the others did not notice him.

"I've seen her!" went on the trader emphatically.

"You've seen her!" said Nick, in an awed whisper.

An extra loud burst of the storming wind held the men silent a moment, then, as it died away,
Victor went on.

"Yes, I see her with my own two eyes, an' I ain't like to ferget it neither. Say, ye've seen
them Bible 'lustrations in my shanty? Them pictur's o' lovesome critturs wi' feathery wings
an' sech?"

"I guess."

"Wal, clip them wings sheer off, an' you've got her dead right."

"Mush! But she must be a dandy sight," exclaimed Nick, with conviction. "How come ye to--"

"Guess it's a long yarn, an' maybe ye're wantin' to sleep."

"Say, I 'lows I'd like that yarn, Victor. I ain't worried for sleep, any."

Nick deliberately refilled his pipe and lit it, and passed his tobacco to the trader. Victor
took the pouch. Ralph's eyes had closed again.

"You allus was a great one fer a yarn, Nick," began the half-breed, with a laugh. "Guess you
most allus gets me gassin'; but say, this ain't no yarn, in a way. It's the most cur'us bit
o' truth, as maybe you'll presently allow. But I ain't goin' to tell it you if ye ain't believin',
'cause it's the truth." The trader's face had become quite serious and he spoke with unusual
earnestness. Nick was impressed, and Ralph's eyes had opened again.

"Git goin', pard; guess your word's good fer me," Nick said eagerly. "You was sayin'--"

"Ye've heard tell o' the Moosefoot Injuns?" began the trader slowly. Nick nodded. "They're
a queer lot o' neches. I used to do a deal o' trade wi' them on the Peace River, 'fore they
was located on a reserve. They were the last o' the old-time redskin hunters. Dessay they were
the last to hunt the buffalo into the drives. They're pretty fine men now, I guess, as neches
go, but they ain't nothin' to what they was. I guess that don't figger anyway, but they're
different from most Injuns, which is what I was coming to. Their chief ain't a 'brave,' same
as most, which, I 'lows, is unusual. Maybe that's how it come they ain't allus on the war-path,
an' maybe that's how it come their river's called Peace River. Their chief is a Med'cine Man;
has been ever since they was drove across the mountains from British Columbia. They was pretty
nigh wiped out when that happened, so they did away wi' havin' a 'brave' fer a chief, an' took
on a 'Med'cine Man.'

"Wal, it ain't quite clear how it come about, but the story, which is most gener'ly believed,
says that the first Med'cine Man was pertic'ler cunnin', an' took real thick with the white
folks' way o' doin' things. Say, he learned his folk a deal o' farmin' an' sech, an' they took
to trappin' same as you understand it. There wa'n't no scrappin', nor war-path yowlin'; they
jest come an' settled right down an' took on to the land. Wal, this feller, 'fore he died,
got the Mission'ry on his trail, an' got religion; but he couldn't git dead clear o' his med'cine,
an' he got to prophesyin'. He called all his folk together an' took out his youngest squaw.
She was a pretty crittur, sleek as an antelope fawn; I 'lows her pelt was nigh as smooth an'
soft. Her eyes were as black an' big as a moose calf's, an' her hair was as fine as black fox
fur. Wal, he up an' spoke to them folk, an' said as ther' was a White Squaw comin' amongst
'em who was goin' to make 'em a great people; who was goin' to lead 'em to victory agin their
old enemies in British Columbia, where they'd go back to an' live in peace. An' he told 'em
as this squaw was goin' to be the instrument by which the comin' of the White Squaw was to
happen. Then they danced a Med'cine Dance about her, an' he made med'cine for three days wi'out
stoppin'. Then they built her a lodge o' teepees in the heart o' the forest, where she was
to live by herself.

"Wal, time went on an' the squaw give birth to a daughter, but she wa'n't jest white, so the
men took and killed her, I guess. Then came another; she was whiter than the first, but she
didn't jest please the folk, an' they killed her too. Then came another, an' another, each
child whiter than the last, an' they were all killed, 'cause I guess they wa'n't jest white.
Till the seventh come along. The seventh was the White Squaw. Say, fair as a pictur, wi' black
hair that shone in the sun, an' wi' eyes that blue as 'ud shame the summer sky."

The half-breed paused, and sat staring with introspective gaze at the iron side of the stove.
Nick was gazing at him all eyes and ears for the story. Ralph, too, was sitting up now.

"Wal, she was taken care of an' treated like the queen she was. On'y the headman was allowed
to look at her. She grew an' grew, an' all the tribe was thinkin' of war, an' gettin' ready.
They made 'braves' nigh every week, an' their Sun Dances was the greatest ever known. They
danced Ghost Dances, too, to keep away Evil Spirits, I guess, an' things was goin' real good.
Then sudden comes the white folk, an' after a bit they was all herded on to a Reserve an' kep'
there. But that White Squaw never left her home in the forest, 'cause no one but the headman
knew where she was. She was on'y a young girl then; I guess she's grown now. Wal, fer years
them pore critturs reckoned on her comin' along an' leadin' them out on the war-path. But she
didn't come; she jest stayed right along with her mother in that forest, an' didn't budge.

"That's the yarn as it stan's," Victor went on, after another pause, "but this is how I come
to see her. It was winter, an' I was tradin' on the Reserve there. It was a fine, cold day,
an' the snow was good an' hard, an' I set out to hunt an old bull moose that was runnin' with
its mates in the location. I took two neches with me, an' we had a slap-up time fer nigh on
to a week. We hunted them moose hard the whole time, but never came up wi' 'em. Then it came
on to storm, an' we pitched camp in a thick pine forest. We was there fer nigh on three days
while it stormed a'mighty hard. Then it cleared an' we set out, an', wi'in fifty yards o' our
camp, we struck the trail o' the moose. We went red-hot after them beasts, I'm figgerin', an'
they took us into the thick o' the forest. Then we got a couple o' shots in; my slugs got home,
but, fer awhiles, we lost them critturs. Next day we set out again, an' at noon we was startled
by hearin' a shot fired by som'un else. We kep' right on, an' bimeby we came to a clearin'.
There we saw four teepees an' a shack o' pine logs all smeared wi' colour; but what came nigh
to par'lyzin' me was the sight o' my moose lyin' all o' a heap on the ground, an', standin'
beside its carcass, leanin' on a long muzzle-loader, was a white woman. She was wearin' the
blanket right enough, but she was as white as you are. Say, she had six great huskies wi' her,
an' four women. An' when they see us they put hard into the woods. I was fer goin' to have
a look at the teepees, but my neches wouldn't let me. They told me the lodge was sacred to
the White Squaw, who we'd jest seen. An' I 'lows, they neches wa'n't jest easy till we cleared
them woods."

"An' she was beautiful, an'--an' fine?" asked Nick, as the trader ceased speaking. "Was she
that beautiful as you'd heerd tell of?"

His voice was eager with suppressed excitement. His pipe had gone out, and he had forgotten
everything but the story the Breed had told.

"Ay, that she was; her skin was as clear as the snow she trod on, an' her eyes--gee! but I've
never seen the like. Man, she was wonderful."

Victor threw up his hands in a sort of ecstasy and looked up at the creaking roof.

"An' her hair?" asked Nick, wonderingly.

"A black fox pelt was white aside it."

"An' didn't ye foller her?"

The question came abruptly from Ralph, whom the others had forgotten.

"I didn't jest know you was awake," said Victor. "Wal, no, to own the truth, I 'lows I was
scart to death wi' what them neches said. Maybe I wa'n't sorry to light out o' them woods."

They talked on for a few moments longer, then Ralph's stertorous breathing told of sleep. Victor
was not long in following his example. Nick sat smoking thoughtfully for some time; presently
he rose and put out the lamp and stoked up the fire. Then he, too, rolled over in his blankets,
and, thinking of the beautiful White Squaw, dropped off to sleep to continue his meditations
in dreamland.

CHAPTER III.

THE QUEST OF THE WHITE SQUAW

Christmas had gone by and the new year was nearing the end of its first month. It was many
weeks since Victor Gagnon had come to the Westley's dugout on that stormy evening. But his
visit had not been forgotten. The story of the White Squaw had made an impression upon Nick
such as the half-breed could never have anticipated. Ralph had thought much of it too, but,
left to himself, he would probably have forgotten it, or, at most, have merely remembered it
as a good yarn.

But this he was not allowed to do. Nick was enthusiastic. The romance of the mountains was
in his blood, and that blood was glowing with the primest life of man. The fire of youth had
never been stirred within him, but it was there, as surely as it is in every human creature.
Both men were nearing forty years of age, and, beyond the associations of the trader's place,
they had never mixed with their fellows.

The dream of this beautiful White Squaw had come to Nick; and, in the solitude of the forest,
in the snow-bound wild, it remained with him, a vision of such joy as he had never before dreamed.
The name of "woman" held for him suggestions of unknown delights, and the weird surroundings
with which Victor had enveloped the lovely creature made the White Squaw a vision so alluring
that his uncultured brain was incapable of shutting it out.

And thus it was, as he glided, ghost-like, through the forests or scaled the snowy crags in
the course of his daily work, the memory of the mysterious creature remained with him. He thought
of her as he set his traps; he thought of her, as, hard on the trail of moose, or deer, or
wolf, or bear, he scoured the valleys and hills; in the shadow of the trees at twilight, in
fancy he saw her lurking; even amidst the black, barren tree-trunks down by the river banks.
His eyes and ears were ever alert with the half-dread expectation of seeing her or hearing
her voice. The scene Victor had described of the white huntress leaning upon her rifle was
the most vivid in his imagination, and he told himself that some day, in the chances of the
chase, she might visit his valleys, his hills.

At night he would talk of her to his brother, and together they would chum the matter over,
and slowly, in the more phlegmatic Ralph, Nick kindled the flame with which he himself was
consumed.

And so the days wore on; a fresh zest was added to their toil. Each morning Ralph would set
out with a vague but pleasurable anticipation of adventure. And as his mind succumbed to the
strange influence of the White Squaw, it coloured for him what had been the commonplace events
of his daily life. If a buck was started and rushed crashing through the forest growths, he
would pause ere he raised his rifle to assure himself that it was not a woman, garbed in the
parti-coloured blanket of the Moosefoot Indians, and with a face radiant as an angel's. His
slow-moving imagination was deeply stirred.

From the Beginning Nature has spoken in no uncertain language. "Man shall not live alone,"
she says. Victor Gagnon had roused these two simple creatures. There was a woman in the world,
other than the mother they had known, and they began to wonder why the mountains should be
peopled only by the forest beasts and solitary man.

As February came the time dragged more heavily than these men had ever known it to drag before.
They no longer sat and talked of the White Squaw, and speculated as to her identity, and the
phenomenon of her birth, and her mission with regard to her tribe. Somehow the outspoken enthusiasm
of Nick had subsided into silent brooding; and Ralph needed no longer the encouragement of
his younger brother to urge him to think of the strange white creature. Each had taken the
subject to himself, and nursed and fostered it in his own way.

The time was approaching for their visit to Gagnon's store. This was the reason of the dragging
days. Both men were eager for the visit, and the cause of their eagerness was not far to seek.
They wished to see the half-breed and feed their passion on fresh words of the lovely creature
who had so strangely possessed their imaginations.

They did not neglect the methodical routine of their duties. When night closed in Nick saw
to the dogs. The great huskies obeyed only one master who fed them, who cared for them, who
flogged them on the trail with club and whip; and that was Nick. Ralph they knew not. He cooked.
He was the domestic of the abode, for he was of a slow nature which could deal with the small
details of such work. Nick was too large and heavy in his mode of life to season a stew. But
in the trapper's craft it is probable that he was the better man.

The brothers' nights were passed in long, Indian-like silence which ended in sleep. Tobacco
scented the atmosphere of the hut with a heaviness that was depressing. Each man sat upon his
blankets alternating between his pannikin of coffee and his pipe, with eyes lowered in deep
thought, or turned upon the glowing stove in earnest, unseeing contemplation.

The night before the appointed day for starting came round. To-morrow they would be swinging
along over the snowy earth with their dogs hauling their laden sled. The morrow would see them
on their way to Little Choyeuse Creek, on the bank of which stood Victor Gagnon's store.

There was an atmosphere of suppressed excitement in the doings of that night. There was much
to be done, and the unusual activity almost seemed a bustle in so quiet an abode. Outside the
door the sled stood piled with the furs which represented their winter's catch. The dog harness
was spread out, and all was in readiness. Inside the hut the two men were packing away the
stuff they must leave behind. Although there was no fear of their home being invaded it was
their custom to take certain precautions. In that hut were all their savings, to lose which
would mean to lose the fruits of their life's labours.

Nick had just moved a chest from the depths of the patchwork cupboard in which they kept their
food. It was a small receptacle hewn out of a solid pine log. The lid was attached with heavy
rawhide hinges, and was secured by an iron hasp held by a clumsy-looking padlock. He set it
down upon his blankets.

"Wer'll we put this?" he asked abruptly.

Ralph looked at it with his thoughtful eyes.

"It needs considerin'," he observed. And he leant himself against a heavy table which stood
by the wall.

"We ain't opened it since last fall," said Nick presently, after a long and steady survey of
the object of their solicitude.

"No."

"Ther's a deal in it."

Ralph groped at the neck of his shirt. Nick watched his brother's movements.

"Maybe we'll figure it up agin."

Ralph fell in with his brother's suggestion and drew out the key which was secured round his
neck. He unlocked the rusty padlock and threw open the lid. The chest contained six small bags
filled to bursting point and securely tied with rawhide; one bag, half-full and open; and a
thick packet of Bank of Montreal bills.

Nick knelt down and took out the bills and set them on one side.

"Ther's fi' thousand dollars ther," he said. "I 'lows they've been reckoned careful." Then
he picked up one of the bags and held it up for his brother's inspection. "We tied them seven
bags up all weighin' equal, but we ain't jest sure how much dust they hold. Seven," he went
on reflectively, "ther's on'y six an' a haf now, since them woodbugs got at 'em, 'fore we made
this chest. I 'lows Victor's 'cute to locate the dust in them furs. It wa'n't a good layout
wrappin' the bags in black fox pelts. Howsum, I'd like to know the value o' them bags. Weighs
nigh on to three poun', I'm guessin'."

Ralph took the bag and weighed it in his hand.

"More," he said. "Ther's fi' poun' o' weight ther'."

"Guess them bags together means fifteen to twenty thousan' dollars, sure," said Nick, his eyes
shining at the thought.

"I don't rightly know," said Ralph. "It's a goodish wad, I 'lows."

Nick returned the store to the chest which Ralph relocked.

"Where?" asked Nick, glancing round the hut in search of a secure hiding-place.

"We'll dig a hole in the floor under my blankets," said Ralph after a pause. "Maybe it'll be
tol'ble safe there."

And for greater security the chest was so disposed. The work was quickly done, and the clay
floor, with the aid of water, was smeared into its usual smooth appearance again. Then the
brothers sought their rest.

At daybreak came the start. Nick harnessed the dogs, five great huskies who lived in the shelter
of a rough shed outside the hut when it stormed, and curled themselves up in the snow, or prowled,
baying the moon, when the night was fine. Fierce-looking brutes these with their long, keen
muzzles, their high shoulders and deep chests, their drooping quarters which were massed with
muscle right down to the higher sinews of their great feet. Their ferocity was chiefly the
animal antagonism for their kind; with Nick they were easy enough to handle, for all had been
well broken beneath the heavy lash which the man knew better than to spare.

While the dogs were being hitched into their places Ralph secured the door of the dugout. There
were no half measures here. The door was nailed up securely, and a barrier of logs set before
it. Then, when all was ready, the men took their poles and Nick broke out the frost-bound runners
of the sled. At the magic word "Mush!" the dogs sprang at their breast-draws, and the sled
glided away down the slope with Nick running beside it, and Ralph following close behind.

Down they dropped into the depths of the silent valley, Nick guiding his dogs by word of mouth
alone. The lead dog, an especially vile-tempered husky, needed nothing but the oft-repeated
"Gee" and "Haw" where no packed path was, and when anything approaching a trail was struck
Nick issued no commands. These creatures of the wild knew their work, loved it, lived for it,
as all who have seen them labouring over snow and ice must understand.

By the route they must take it was one hundred miles to Little Choyeuse Creek. One hundred
miles of mountain and forest; one hundred miles of gloomy silence; one hundred miles of virgin
snow, soft to the feet of the labouring dogs, giving them no foothold but the sheer anchorage
of half-buried legs. It was a temper-trying journey for man and beast. The dogs snapped at
each other's heels, but the men remained silent, hugging their own thoughts and toiling amidst
the pleasure of anticipation.

Skirting the forests wherever possible, and following the break of the mammoth pine-trees when
no bald opening was to hand they sped along. The dogs hauled at the easy running sled, while,
with long, gliding strides, the two men kept pace with them. The hills were faced by the sturdy
dogs with the calm persistence of creatures who know their own indomitable powers of endurance,
while the descents were made with a speed which was governed by the incessant use of Nick's pole.

The evening camp was pitched in the shelter of the forest. The dogs fed voraciously and well
on their raw fish, for the journey was short and provisions plentiful. The two men fared in
their usual plain way. They slept in their fur-lined bags while the wolfish burden-bearers
of the North first prowled, argued out their private quarrels, sang in chorus as the northern
lights moved fantastically in the sky, and finally curled themselves in their several snow-burrows.

The camp was struck at daylight next morning and the journey resumed. The dogs raced fresh
and strong after their rest, and the miles were devoured with greedy haste. The white valleys
wound in a mazy tangle round the foot of tremendous hills, but never a mistake in direction
was made by the driver, Nick. To him the trail was as plain as though every foot of it were
marked by well-packed snow; every landmark was anticipated, every inch of that chaotic land
was an open book. A "Gee," or a sudden "Haw" and a fresh basin of magnificent primeval forest
would open before the travellers. And so the unending ocean of mountain rollers and forest
troughs continued. No variation, save from the dead white of the open snowfields to the heavy
shadows of the forest. Always the strange, mystic grey twilight; the dazzling sparkle of glinting
snow; the biting air which stung the flesh like the sear of a red-hot iron; the steady run
of dogs and men. On, on, with no thought of time to harass the mind, only the destination to
think of.

And when they came to Little Choyeuse Creek they were welcomed in person by Victor Gagnon.
He awaited them at his threshold. The clumsy stockade of lateral pine logs, a relic of the
old Indian days when it was necessary for every fur store to be a fortress, was now a wreck.
A few upright posts were standing, but the rest had long since been used to bank the stoves with.

The afternoon was spent in barter, and the time was one of beaming good nature, for Victor
was a shrewd dealer, and the two brothers had little real estimate of the value of money. They
sold their pelts in sets, regardless of quality. And when the last was traded, and Victor had
parted the value in stores and cash, there came a strong feeling of relief to the trappers.
Now for their brief holiday.

It was the custom on the occasion of these visits to make merry in a temperate way. Victor
was never averse to such doings for there was French blood in his veins. He could sing a song,
and most of his ditties were either of the old days of the Red River Valley, or dealt with
the early settlers round the Citadel of Quebec. Amongst the accomplishments which he possessed
was that of scraping out woful strains upon an ancient fiddle. In this land, where life was
always serious, he was a right jovial companion for such men as Nick and Ralph, and the merry
evenings in his company at the store were well thought of. 

For although each individual thing is determined by another individual thing to existence in
a certain way, the force nevertheless by which each thing perseveres in its existence follows
from the eternal necessity of the nature of God.

The demonstration of the preceding proposition is universal, and whether a thing be considered
as a part or as a whole, its idea, whether it be of a part or whole, will involve the eternal
and infinite essence of God. Therefore that which gives a knowledge of the eternal and infinite
essence of God is common to all, and is equally in the part and in the whole. This knowledge
therefore will be adequate.

The human mind possesses ideas by which it perceives itself and its own body, together with external
bodies, as actually existing. Therefore it possesses an adequate knowledge of the eternal and
infinite essence of God.

Hence we see that the infinite essence and the eternity of God are
known to all; and since all things are in God and are conceived through
Him, it follows that we can deduce from this knowledge many things
which we can know adequately, and that we can thus form that third
sort of knowledge.

The reason why we do not possess a knowledge of God as distinct as that which we have of common notions
is, that we cannot imagine God as we can bodies; and because we have attached the name God
to the images of things which we are in the habit of seeing, an error we can hardly avoid, inasmuch
as we are continually affected by external bodies.

Many errors, of a truth, consist merely in the application of the wrong names to things. For if a man
says that the lines which are drawn from the center of the circle
to the circumference are not equal, he understands by the circle,
at all events for the time, something else than mathematicians understand
by it.

    So when men make errors in calculation,
    the numbers which are in their minds are not those which are upon
the paper.

As far as their mind is concerned there is no error, although it seems as if there were, because
we think that the numbers in their minds are those which are upon the paper. If we did not
think so, we should not believe them to be in error.

For example, when I lately heard a man complaining that his court had flown into one of his neighbor's
fowls, I understood what he meant, and therefore did not imagine him to be in error. This
is the source from which so many controversies arise--that men either do not properly explain their
own thoughts, or do not properly interpret those of other people; for, in truth, when they
most contradict one another, they either think the same things or
something different, so that those things which they suppose to be
errors and absurdities in another person are not so.

CHAPTER XI

DETERMINISM AND MORALS

The Mind Is Necessarily Determined

The mind is a certain and determinate mode of thought, and therefore it cannot be the free
cause of its own actions, or have an absolute faculty of willing
or not willing, but must be determined to this or that volition by
a cause which is also determined by another cause, and this again
by another, and so on ad infinitum.

In the same manner it is demonstrated that in the mind there exists
no absolute faculty of understanding, desiring, loving, etc. These
and the like faculties, therefore, are either altogether fictitious,
or else are nothing but metaphysical or universal entities, which
we are in the habit of forming from individual cases.

The intellect and will, therefore, are related to this or that idea or volition as rockiness is
related to this or that rock, or as man is related to Peter or Paul. The reason why men imagine
themselves to be free we have already explained.

Faculty Psychology Fallacious

Before, however, I advance any further, I must observe that by the
will I understand a faculty of affirming or denying, but not a desire;
a faculty, I say, by which the mind affirms or denies that which is
true or false, and not a desire by which the mind seeks a thing or
turns away from it.

But now that we have demonstrated that these faculties are universal notions which are not
distinguishable from the individual notions from which they are formed, we must now inquire whether
the volitions themselves are anything more than the ideas of things.
We must inquire, I say, whether in the mind there exists any other
affirmation or negation than that which the idea involves in so far
as it is an idea. For this purpose see the following, so that thought
may not fall into pictures. For by ideas I do not understand the images
which are formed at the back of the eye, or, if you please, in the
middle of the brain, but rather the conceptions of thought.

In the
mind there exists no absolute faculty of willing or not willing. Only
individual volitions exist, that is to say, this and that affirmation
and this and that negation.

"By Gar!" he cried, "then I go an' find her; I go an' see for myself."

And as he spoke a strange expression looked out of Victor's eyes.

Ralph removed his pipe from his lips.

"Good, Nick," he said emphatically. "The dogs are fresh. Guess a long trail'll do 'em a deal
o' good. When'll we start?"

Nick looked across at his brother. He was doubtful if he had heard aright. He had expected
strong opposition from the quiet, steady-going Ralph. But, instead, the elder man gave unhesitating
approval. Just for one instant there came a strange feeling in his heart; a slight doubt, a
sensation of disappointment, something foreign to his nature and unaccountable, something which
took all pleasure from the thought of his brother's company. It was quite a fleeting sensation,
however, for the next moment it was gone; his honest nature rose superior to any such jealousy
and he strode across the room and gripped Ralph's hand.

"Say, we'll start at daylight, brother. Jest you an' me," he blurted out, in the fulness of
his large heart. "We'll hunt that white crittur out, we'll smell her out like Injun med'cine-men,
an' we'll bring her back wi' us. Say, Ralph, we'll treat her like an angel, this dandy, queer
thing. By Gar! We'll find her, sure. Shake again, brother." They wrung each other forcefully
by the hand. "Shake, Victor." And Nick turned and caught the trader's slim hand in his overwhelming
grasp.

His enthusiasm was at boiling point. The brew of essences had done its work. Victor's swift-moving
eyes saw what was passing in the thoughts of both his guests. And, like the others, his enthusiasm
rose. But there was none of the simple honesty of these men in Victor. The half-breed cunning
was working within him; and the half-breed cunning is rarely clean.

And so the night ended to everybody's satisfaction. Ralph was even more quiet than usual. Victor
Gagnon felt that the stars were working in his best interests; and he blessed the lucky and
innocent thought that had suggested to him the yarn of the White Squaw. As for Nick, his delight
was boisterous and unrestrained. He revelled openly in the prospect of the morrow's journey.

Nor had broad daylight power to shake the purpose of the night. Too long had the trappers brooded
upon the story of the White Squaw. Victor knew his men so well too; while they breakfasted
he used every effort to encourage them. He literally herded them on by dint of added detail
and well-timed praise of the woman's beauty.

And after the meal the sled was prepared. Victor was chief adviser. He made them take a supply
of essences and "trade." He told them of the disposition of Man-of-the-Snow-Hill, the Moosefoot
chief, assuring them he would sell his soul for strong drink. No encouragement was left ungiven,
and, well before noon, the dogs stood ready in the traces.

A hearty farewell; then out upon the white trail Nick strung the willing beasts, and the flurry
of loose surface-snow that flew in their wake hid the sled as the train glided away to the
far northeast.

Victor stood watching the receding figures till the hiss of the runners died down in the distance,
and the driving voice of Nick became lost in the grey solitude. The northern trail held them
and he felt safe. He moved out upon the trampled snow, and, passing round to the back of the
store, disappeared within the pine wood which backed away up the slope of the valley.

Later he came to where three huts were hidden away amongst the vast tree-trunks. They were
so placed, and so disguised, as to be almost hidden until the wanderer chanced right upon them.
These habitations were a part of Victor's secret life. There was a strange mushroom look about
them; low walls of muck-daubed logs supported wide-stretching roofs of reeds, which, in their
turn, supported a thick covering of soot-begrimed snow. He paused near by and uttered a low
call, and presently a tall girl emerged from one of the doors. She walked slowly toward him
with proud, erect carriage, while at her heels followed two fierce husky dogs, moving with
all the large dignity of honoured guards. The woman was taller than the trader, and her beauty
of figure was in no wise hidden by the blanket clothing she wore. They talked earnestly together
for some time, and then, in answer to a further summons from Victor, they were joined by a
tall, gaunt man, with the solemn cast of face of an Indian, and a pair of eyes as darkly brooding
as those of a moose. Although he was very dark-skinned he was plainly of the bastard race of
his companions, and a certain resemblance between himself and the woman spoke of relationship.

The three talked long and seriously, and finally Victor returned alone to the store. Again
he took up his stand in the doorway and remained gazing out upon the valley of the Little Choyeuse
Creek, and the more distant crags of the foothills beyond.

His face was serious; serious even for the wild, where all levity seems out of place, and laughter
jars upon the solemnity of the life and death struggle for existence which is for ever being
fought out there. On his brow was a pucker of deep thought, whilst his eyes shone with a look
which seemed to have gathered from his surroundings much of the cunning which belongs to the
creatures of the forest. His usual expression of good-fellowship had passed; and in its place
appeared a hungry, avaricious look which, although always there, was generally hidden behind
a superficial geniality. Victor had hitherto lived fairly honestly because there was little
or no temptation to do otherwise where his trading-post was stationed. But it was not his nature
to do so. And as he stood gazing out upon the rugged picture before him he knew he was quite
unobserved; and so the rough soul within him was laid bare to the grey light of the world.

CHAPTER IV.

THE HOODED MAN

The mere suggestion of the possibility of a woman's presence had rudely broken up the even
calm of Ralph and Nick Westley's lives. To turn back to the peace of their mountain home without
an effort to discover so fair and strange a creature as this White Squaw would have been impossible.

These men had known no real youth. They had fought the battle of life from the earliest childhood,
they had lived lives as dispassionate and cold as the glaciers of their mountain home. Recreation
was almost unknown to them. Toil, unremitting, arduous, had been their lot. Thus Nature had
been defied; and now she was coming back on them as inevitably as the sun rises and sets, and
the seasons come and go. They failed to realize their danger; they had no understanding of
the passions that moved them, and so they hurried headlong upon the trail that was to lead
them they knew not whither, but which was shadowed by disaster every foot of the way. To them
temptation was irresistible for they had never known the teaching of restraint; it was the
passionate rending of the bonds which had all too long stifled their youth.

Even the dogs realized the change in their masters. Nick's lash fell heavily and frequently,
and the hardy brutes, who loved the toil of the trace, and the incessant song of the trailing
sled, fell to wondering at the change, and the pace they were called upon to make. It was not
their nature to complain; their pride was the stubborn, unbending pride of savage power, and
their reply to the wealing thong was always the reply their driver sought. Faster and faster
they journeyed as the uncooling ardour of their master's spirits rose.

The snow lay thick and heavy, and every inch of the wild, unmeasured trail had to be broken.
The Northland giants thronged about them, glistening in their impenetrable armour and crested
by the silvery burnish of their glacial headpieces. They frowned vastly, yet with a sublime
contempt, at the puny intrusion of their solitude. But the fiery spirit impelling the brothers
was a power which defied the overwhelming grandeur of the mountain world, and rendered insignificant
the trials they encountered. The cry was "On!" and the dogs laboured as only these burden-bearers
of the North can labour.

The dark day ripened; and, as the dull sun crept out from behind the greyness, and revealed
the frost in the air, the temperature dropped lower and lower. And the animal world peeped
furtively out upon the strange sight of creatures like themselves toiling at the command of
beings whose voices had not even the power to smite the mountainsides with boastful defiance
as theirs were wont to do.

Then the daylight waned. The sky returned to its greyness as the night shades rose, and a bitter
breeze shuddered through the woods and along the valleys. The sounds of the forest rose in
mournful cadence, and, as the profundity of the mountain night settled heavily upon the world,
the timber-wolf, the outlaw of the region, moved abroad, lifting his voice in a cry half-mournful,
half-exultant.

Camp was pitched well clear of the forest and a large fire kindled; and the savage night-prowlers
drew forth from the woodland shadows. The men proceeded silently with their various tasks.
Ralph prepared their own food, and soon a savoury odour tickled the nostrils of those beyond
the circle of the firelight. Nick thawed out the dogs' evening meal and distributed it impartially,
standing over the hungry beasts with a club to see that each got the full benefit of his portion.
It was a strange sight for the furtive eyes that looked on, and a tantalizing one, but they
dared not draw near, for the fire threatened them, and, besides, they possessed a keen instinct
of caution.

After supper the men rested in spells, one always sitting up by the fire whilst the other slept
in the comfort of his fur-lined "Arctic bag." And presently the blackness about lightened,
and the dark shadows prowling became visible to the eyes of the sentry. The moon had risen,
but was still hidden somewhere behind the great mountains. Its light had effect, that was all.
And as the night wore on the shadows grew bolder and their presence kept the sentry ever on
the alert. For the most part he sat still, swathed to the eyes in his furs; he huddled down
over the fire smoking, every now and then pausing to thaw the nicotine in the stem of his pipe.
But his eyes seemed to be watching in every direction at once. Nor was the vaguest shadow lost
to their quick flashing glances.

The dogs, sleeping in their snow-burrows, rested their muscles, dreaming peacefully of happy
hunting-grounds. Their safety was assured under the watchful eyes of their masters; the forest
world had no terrors for them.

Towards dawn Nick was on the watch. The aspect of the night had quite changed. The moon, large,
full, brilliant, was directly overhead, and the stars, like magnificent dewdrops, hung richly
in the sky. Away to the north, just clear of a stretch of heaven-high peaks, the scintillating
shafts of the northern lights shuddered convulsively, like skeleton arms outstretched to grasp
the rich gems which hung just beyond their reach. The moving shadows had changed to material
forms. Lank, gaunt, hungry-looking beasts crowded just beyond the fire-lit circle; shaggy-coated
creatures, with manes a-bristle and baleful eyes which gazed angrily upon the camp.

Nick saw all these; could have counted them, so watchful was he. The wolves were of small account,
but there were other creatures which needed his most vigilant attention. Twice in the night
he had seen two green-glowing eyes staring down upon him from among the branches of one of
the trees on the edge of the forest. He knew those eyes, as who of his calling would not; a
puma was crouching along the wide-spreading bough.

He stealthily drew his gun towards him. He was in the act of raising it to his shoulder when
the eyes were abruptly withdrawn. The time passed on. He knew that the puma had not departed,
and he waited, ready. The eyes reappeared. Up leapt the rifle, but ere his hand had compressed
the trigger a sound from behind arrested him. His head turned instantly, and, gazing through
the light, drifting fire smoke, he beheld the outline of a monstrous figure bearing down upon
the camp in an almost human manner. In size the newcomer dwarfed the trapper; it came slowly
with a shuffling gait. Suddenly it dropped to all-fours and came on quicker. Nick hesitated
only for a second. His mouth set firmly and his brows contracted. He knew that at all hazards
he must settle the puma first. He glanced at the sleeping Ralph. He was about to rouse him;
then he changed his mind and swung round upon the puma, leaving the fire between himself and
the other. He took a long and deadly aim. The glowing eyes offered a splendid target and he
knew he must not miss. A report rang out, followed almost instantaneously by a piteous, half-human
shriek of pain; then came the sound of a body falling, and the eyes had vanished. After firing
Nick swung round to the figure beyond the fire. It loomed vast in the yellow light and was
reared to its full height not ten yards away. A low, snarling growl came from it, and the sound
was dreadful in its suppressed ferocity. Ralph was now sitting up gazing at the oncoming brute,--a
magnificent grizzly. Nick stooped, seized a blazing log from the fire, and dashed out to meet
the intruder.

It was a strange and impressive sight, this encounter of man and beast. But Nick, with his
wide experience, was master of the situation. He boldly went up to within two yards of his
savage and fearless foe and dashed the burning brand into the creature's face. Down dropped
the grizzly upon all-fours again, and, with a roar of pain and terror, ambled hastily away
into the forest.

"B'ar?" questioned Ralph, from the shelter of his fur bag.

"Yes--an' puma," replied Nick unconcernedly, as he returned to his seat to await the coming
of morning.

And so the long night passed, and the slow day broke over the bleak, pitiless world. The dogs
awoke, and clambered from their warm, snowy couches. The routine of the "long trail" obtained,
and once more the song of the sled rang out at the heels of the eager beasts.

Nor was the short day and long weary night in such a region without effect upon the men. A
feeling of superstitious uneasiness seized upon Nick. He said nothing, he was possibly too
ashamed of it to do so, but the dread steadily grew, and no effort of his seemed to have power
to dispel it. As he moved along beside his dogs he would shoot swift, fearful glances at the
heights above, or back over the trail, or on ahead to some deep, dark gorge they might be approaching.
He grew irritable. The darkness of the woods would sometimes hold his attention for hours,
while the expression of his eyes would tell of the strange thoughts passing behind them. And
Ralph, though more unemotional than his brother, was scarcely less affected. It was startling
in such men, yet was it hardly to be wondered at in so overpowering a waste.

It was still the morning of the second day. Nick's whip had been silent for a long time. His
eyes were gazing out afar. Sometimes up at the lowering sky, where the peaks were lost in a
sea of dark cloud, sometimes down, with a brooding fire, into the forest depths. Ralph had
observed the change in his brother and sympathy prompted him to draw up alongside him.

"What's ailin' ye?" he asked.

Nick shook his head; he could not say that anything ailed him.

"Thought, maybe ther' was somethin' amiss," went on his brother, half-apologetically. He felt
himself that he must talk.

Then Nick was seized with a desire to confide in the only lifelong friend he had ever known.

"Ther' ain't nothin' amiss, zac'ly," he said. And he got no farther.

"Hah!"

Ralph looked round sharply. It seemed as if something were stirring about him. He waited expectantly.
There was nothing unusual in sight. A wild panorama of snowy grandeur; mountain and valley
and wood, that was all.

They traipsed on in silence, but now they journeyed side by side. Both men were strangely moved.
Both had heard of the "Dread of the Wild," but they would have scoffed at the idea of its assailing
them. But the haunting clung, and at each step they felt that the next might be the signal
for a teeming spirit life to suddenly break up the dreadful calm.

They passed a hollow where the snow was unusually deep and soft. The dogs laboured wearily.
They reached the rising end of it, and toiled up the sharp ascent. The top was already in sight
and a fresh vista of the interminable peaks broke up their view. Without apparent reason Nick
suddenly drew up and a sharp exclamation broke from him. The dogs lay down in the traces, and
both men gazed back into the hollow they had left. Nick towered erect, and, with eyes staring,
pointed at a low hill on the other side of it.

Ralph followed the direction of the outstretched arm. And as he looked he held his breath,
for something seemed to grip his throat.

Then a moment later words, sounding hoarse and stifled, came from the depths of his storm-collar.

"Who--who is it?"

Nick did not answer. Both were staring out across the hollow at the tall motionless figure
of a man, and their eyes were filled with an expression of painful awe. The figure was aggressively
distinct, silhouetted as it was against a barren, snow-clad crag. They might have been gazing
at a statue, so still the figure stood. It was enveloped in fur, so far as the watchers could
tell, but what impressed them most was the strange hood which covered the head. The figure
was too distant for them to have distinguished the features of the face had they been visible,
but, as it was, they were lost within the folds of the grey hood.

There came an ominous click from behind. Ralph turned suddenly and seized his brother's arm
as he was in the act of raising his rifle to his shoulder. The gun was lowered, and the intense
face of Nick scowled at the author of the interruption.

"It's--it ain't a human crittur," he said hoarsely.

"It's a man," retorted Ralph, without releasing his hold.

And the two brothers became silent.

They stood watching for a long time. Neither spoke again, they had nothing to say. Their thoughts
occupied them with strange apprehension while the dogs sprawled in the snow in the spiritless
manner of their kind when the labour of the traces is not demanded of them. The figure on the
hill stood quite still. The silence of the wild was profound. No wind stirred to relieve it,
and even under their warm furs the two men watching shivered as with cold.

At last the movement they had awaited came. The Hooded Man turned towards them. One long arm
was raised and he pointed away at a tall hill. Then his arm moved, and he seemed to be pointing
out certain landmarks for his own benefit. Again, on a sudden, as he fronted the direction
where the brothers stood, he dropped his arm, and, a moment later, disappeared on the other
side of the hill. The two men remained gazing out across the hollow for some while longer,
but as the Hooded Man did not return they turned back to their dogs and continued their journey.

Nick shook his head in a dissatisfied manner. Ralph said nothing for awhile. He was beginning
to doubt his own assertion.

The dogs leapt at their breast-draws and the sled moved forward. The two men ran side by side.
When Nick at length spoke it was to reiterate his fears.

"Ther' wa'n't no face showed," he said abruptly.

"No," replied Ralph. Then he added thoughtfully: "He hadn't no dogs, neither."

"He was alone, seemly. Ther' wa'n't no camp outfit."

Ralph shook his head and brushed away the ice about his mouth with the back of his beaver mitt.

There was a painful atmosphere of disquiet about the two men. Their backward glances spoke
far louder than words. Had their mission been in the nature of their ordinary calling they
would possibly have felt nothing but curiosity, and their curiosity would have led them to
investigate further, but as it was, all their inclinations tended in the opposite direction.
"The Dread of the Wild" had come to them.

When they camped at midday things were no better. They had seen nothing more to disturb them,
but the thoughts of both had turned upon the night, so long and drear, which was to come; and
the "dread" grew stronger.

After the noon meal Nick harnessed the dogs while Ralph stowed the chattels. They were on a
hillside overlooking a wide valley of unbroken forest. All was ready for a start and Nick gave
a wide, comprehensive glance around. The magic word "Mush," which would send the dogs headlong
at their breast harness, hovered on his lips, but ere he gave it utterance it changed into
an ejaculation of horror.

"By Gar!" Then after a thrilling pause, "The Hood!"

Ralph, standing ready to break the sled out, turned.

"Hey!" he ejaculated; and horror was in his tone, too.

There, in the hazy distance, more than three miles away, was the dim figure of the Hooded Man
racing over the snow. His course lay on the far side of the valley and he was to the rear of them.

Nick turned back to the dogs, the command "Mush!" rang out with biting emphasis, and the dogs
and men, as though both were animated by the same overwhelming fear, raced down the virgin
trail. Their pace was a headlong flight.

Night came, and they camped in the open. The night was blacker, and longer, more weary and
shadowy than the first, by reason of the "dread" which had now become the "Dread of the Hooded
Man." Even thoughts of the White Squaw took a secondary place in the minds of the brothers,
for, at every turn, they felt that their steps were dogged by that other strange creature of
the wild. When morning came they knew, without looking, that somewhere, coldly surveying their
camp, the grey-hooded figure would be watching and waiting for them to move on. And sure enough,
as the eager eyes looked out over the snow and forest, the grim, silent figure was there, watching,
watching; but no nearer to them.

That night they came to the Moosefoot Reserve, and both men experienced such nervous relief
as they had never before known. They camped within sight of the Indian teepees and log huts,
but they waited for morning before they approached the chief.

Over their fire they discussed their plans with seriousness. Neither of them could speak the
Moosefoot language, but they could talk both Sioux and Cree, and they did not doubt but there
would be interpreters about the chief.

"We'll see him first thing, I guess," said the eager Nick. "Guess them two black foxes'll fix
him good. He'll git a goodish bit o' trade for 'em."

"An' we'll promise him powder, an' slugs, an' essences," said the cautious Ralph. "We'll get
his yarn first an' pay after," he added, as he sipped his coffee.

Nick nodded.

"We'll fin' that crittur, sure," he said.

And he sat gazing upon the pictures his mind conjured up as he watched the flaming logs. In
every tongue of flame he beheld the glowing face Victor had told them of, and, as the smoke
rolled up into the black vault of night, he seemed to see the elusive form of the White Squaw
floating in its midst. Ralph's slower imagination was less fantastically, but no less deeply,
stirred.

At daybreak they sought Man-of-the-Snow-Hill's lodge. They found him a grizzled wreck of extreme
age. He was surrounded by his medicine-men, his young chiefs and his squaws. And by the gathering
in the smoke-begrimed hut they knew that their approach had been made known.

Perfect silence reigned as the white men entered. An Indian silence; such silence as it would
be hard to find anywhere but in the primitive dwelling. The atmosphere of the place was heavy
with the pungent odours of Killi-ka-nik. Both men and women were smoking it in pipes of red
clay with reed stems, and they passed this sign of friendship from one to another in solemn
fashion. All were clad in the parti-coloured blanket, and sat hunched upon their quarters more
like beasts than human creatures, yet with that perfect air of dignity which the Indian seldom
loses.

Man-of-the-Snow-Hill alone differed in his dress and attitude. He was wrapped in a large buffalo
robe, and was stretched out upon a pile of skins to ease his rheumatics, while, spread out
before him, were a number of charms and much "med'cine," which had been so set by his wise
men to alleviate his ailments. In the centre of the throng a fire smouldered, and the smoke
therefrom rose sullenly upon the dense air and drifted out through a hole in the flat roof.
Man-of-the-Snow-Hill blinked his watery eyes as the strangers entered, and passed his pipe
to his favourite squaw, a buxom, sleepy-eyed beauty who sat upon his right. Then he grunted
intelligently as he saw the visitors deposit their pile of presents upon the floor, and, in
the manner of the neche, seat themselves beside it.

Ralph spoke his greeting in Indian fashion.

"How," he said.

"How!" replied Man-of-the-Snow-Hill, in a thin, reedy voice. And his followers echoed the sentiment
in chorus.

Then the aged chief held out his hand in further greeting. And each neche in turn shook the
white men by the hand.

The visitors filled and lighted their pipes, and passed their plugs of tobacco to the others.
Then Ralph began to speak in Cree.

"We come far to speak with Man-of-the-Snow-Hill," he began.

The watery-eyed chief shook his head, grunting. The squaws laughed, and the med'cine-men closed
their eyes in sign of not understanding the tongue in which he spoke. Then a young chief harangued
his comrades. He could understand the tongue and would interpret. The old chief nodded approval
and continued to gaze greedily at the presents.

Now the conversation proceeded quite smoothly.

"We wish to speak with the great Man-of-the-Snow-Hill in private," Ralph said. "We have much
to say, and many presents."

The chief blinked with satisfaction, and grunted appreciation. His lined face lit up. He waved
one shaking arm and his followers reluctantly departed. All except the interpreter and the
chief squaw.

Then Ralph went on. Nick had care of the presents, and on him the cunning old chief kept his
eyes. He opened a large bag of beads and emptied some on a spread of cheap print. The squaw's
eyes smiled greedily.

"We wish the great chief well," said Ralph, using all the flowery embellishments of the Cree
tongue, "and we would live in peace. We have tobacco, beads, skins, prints, and blankets. And
we would lay them all at the feet of the great man, the mighty hunter, if he would help us
to find that which we seek."

Ralph signed to his brother and Nick laid out an array of presents and passed them with due
solemnity to the old man.

"Ow-ow!" grunted Man-of-the-Snow-Hill, as he waved the things away to his squaw. He was not
satisfied, and his eyes watered as though he were weeping.

Then Ralph went on.

"We have come on the 'long trail' through the mountains. And we seek the White Squaw of the
Moosefoot Indians."

The chief remained quite calm, but his bleared old eyes shot a sidelong gleam at the speaker
in which there was little friendliness. No other movement was allowed to give evidence of disquiet.
It is part of the upbringing of the neche to eschew all outward signs of emotion. The Sun Dance,
when the braves are made, is the necessary education in this direction. Ralph saw the look
but failed to take its meaning. The squaw watched the white men with keen interest. Nick was
groping about in the depths of a gunny-sack.

Ralph plunged into the fantastic story which he and Nick had prepared. The language of the
Cree helped him, for the natural colouring of the Indian tongues is as flowery as that of any
Eastern race.

"We come from beyond the mountains, from the hunting-grounds of forest and river where the
great fathers of the Moosefoot Indians dwelt. We come to tell the White Squaw that the land
cries out for her, and the return of the children of the Moose. We come to speak with her of
these things, for the time has come when she must leave her forest home and return to her own
land. Man-of-the-Snow-Hill must show us the way. We have many presents which we will give him."

"It is well," said the great man, closing his eyes while the water oozed from between the compressed
lids. "The white men are the friends of the Moosefoot people, and they have many presents.
Have they fire-water?"

Nick produced some bottles and the great man reached for them greedily. But the other withheld
them.

"What will Man-of-the-Snow-Hill do for the fire-water?" Ralph asked.

The interpreter passed the word.

"He will send his favourite squaw to guide the white men," he answered at once. "He can do
no more."

A dozen bottles of vanilla essence passed over to the chief. A number of other presents were
handed to him. Then without a word the squaw arose and accompanied the white men out.

And without further delay the brothers continued their journey. Fleet of foot, untiring, silent
as only an Indian woman can be, the squaw led the way. North, north; always north they travelled,
over hill, through forest and deep white valley, without let-up to their eager speed. The superstitious
dread which had hitherto so afflicted the white men now fell away from them. Night came on
swift and silent, and camp was pitched on the edge of a dense forest.

Ere the daylight had quite died out the squaw took the two men to the crest of a hill. She
looked out across the virgin carpet of towering pines below them and pointed with one blanket-covered
arm outstretched. She was silent while she indicated several points in the vast panorama before
her. Then she tried to tell them something.

But her language was the language of her tribe, and neither of the men could understand her.
Then she spoke in the language of signs, which all Indians speak so well.

She raised her hand, pointing eastward, till it reached a point directly overhead. Then she
pointed to her feet, and her hand moved slowly in a northern direction, after which she made
a running movement with her feet. Then she bent her body and appeared to be gazing about her,
searching. Finally she pointed to two very large trees which stood out apart from their fellows.
Then again came the motion of running, which finished quickly, and she pointed first to Nick's
face and then to herself. After that she stood motionless, with arms folded over her bosom.
And the two men read her meaning.

At daylight they were to start out northward and travel until midday. Then they were to halt
and search the outskirts of the forest until they found two mammoth trees standing apart. The
space between them was the mouth of a pathway into the heart of the forest. They were to traverse
this path a short distance, and they would discover the White Squaw.

Ralph nodded his head slowly in token of comprehension. He waited to see if she had aught further
to say. But the woman remained standing where she was, slightly aloof and with her arms folded.
Her sleepy eyes were watching the last dying gleam of daylight away in the west. Suddenly,
out upon the still air, came a doleful cry. It was long-drawn-out and mournful, but it travelled
as mountain cries will travel. It came waving upon the air with a certain rise and fall in
it like the rippling of water. It rose up, up, and then lingeringly died out. The men listened,
and looked in the direction whence it came, and, as they looked, a feeling of awe swept over
them. In a rush the old "dread" awoke, and their gaze was filled with the expression of it.

Out to the west the forest lay gloomy, brooding; and within a few hundred yards of them stood
the mighty sentry trees which the squaw had pointed out. But now between them, breaking up
the dead white carpet which covered the earth, the tall form of the Hooded Man stood silhouetted.
Grim and ghostly he looked, as, motionless, he gazed upon the watchers.

With the instinct of self-defence which the wild teaches so insistently, Nick unslung his rifle.
Ere Ralph could stay him the shot rang out, echoing away over the tree-tops. The figure had
disappeared, and the unblemished carpet of snow was as it had been before. Nick stood aghast,
for he was a dead shot. Ralph gazed helplessly at the spot where the man had stood.

Suddenly Nick gasped.

"It--it ain't human."

And Ralph had no answer to make.

Then presently they turned to where the Moosefoot squaw had stood. She, too, had gone; vanished
as completely as had the Hooded Man. There was the trail of her snow-shoes ruffling the snow,
and the men ran following it as far as the forest edge; but here they stood. They could follow
no further. Night was upon them. Slowly they returned to camp.

The next day they continued their journey with almost fanatical persistence. They found no
sentry-trees such as the squaw had described. Forest, yes, but where in that region could they
fail to find forest? The abode of the White Squaw was nowhere to be found.

That night they decided upon their next move in the quiet, terse manner of men who cannot bring
themselves to speak of the strange feelings which possess them; who are ashamed of their own
weakness, and yet must acknowledge it to themselves.

"An' to-morrow--" said Nick, glancing apprehensively around beyond the fire, over which they
were sitting, fighting the deadly cold of the night.

"To-morrow?" echoed Ralph.

"Where?" asked Nick, looking away towards the south.

Ralph followed the direction of his brother's gaze.

"Um." And he nodded.

"What--south?"

"South."

"An' the Wh--"

Ralph shook his head, and smoked on solemnly.

CHAPTER V.

THE WHITE SQUAW

Down the sharp incline Nick ran beside his dogs; Ralph was close behind. They were home once
more in their own silent valley, and were pushing on to avoid the coming snow-storm which the
leaden hue of the sky portended. So the dogs were rushed along at a great pace, for the dugout
was beyond, a full hour distant.

It had been a weary journey, that return from the quest of the White Squaw. But the weariness
had been mental. The excitement of their going had eaten up their spirit, and left them with
a feeling of distressing lassitude. They were sobered; and, as men recovering from drunkenness,
they felt ashamed, and their tempers were uncertain.

But as the string of huskies raced down into the valley they knew so well, yelping a joyful
greeting to the familiar objects about them, the men began to feel better, and less like those
who are detected in unworthy actions.

The dogs emerged upon their original outward-bound trail and pursued it along the edge of the
forest. They needed no urging, and even set a pace which taxed all their masters' speed. The
sight of the familiar scenes had banished the "Dread of the Wild" from the minds of the two
men, and their spirits rose as they approached the frost-bound river below their home. There
were no stealing glances into the gloomy shelter of the woods, no nervous backward turns of
the head. They looked steadily ahead for the glad sight of their home; and the snap of the
crisp snow under the heavy-footed dogs, and the eager, steady pull on the traces brought a
cheerful light to their eyes such as had not been there for days.

But although they had failed to discover the White Squaw, she was by no means forgotten. A
certain sense of relief had followed their first moments of keen disappointment, but it was
only a revulsion of their strained nerves; thoughts of her which were, perhaps, less fiery
and reckless, but consequently more enduring, still possessed them.

Ralph was especially calm. He had thought the whole thing over in his deliberate fashion, and,
finally, admitted to himself that what had happened was for the best. Nick was less easy. His
disappointment had slightly soured an already hasty, but otherwise kindly, disposition. He
needed something of his brother's calm to balance him. But, however, in both cases, somewhere
deep down in their hearts the fateful flame so strangely kindled was still burning; a deep,
strong, unquenchable fire.

They were almost home. Before them lay the frozen waterway. Beyond that, and above, rose the
hill, on the face of which stood their shack; and about them was the brooding silence, still
and portentous, but familiar.

The lead-dog plunged down the bank and the rest followed, whilst Ralph and Nick steadied the
laden sled. The brief passage was made, and Nick's whip drove the fierce, willing beasts at
the ascent beyond. Then, ere the sled had left the river, and while the dogs still struggled
in their harness to lift its nose over what was almost a cut-bank, and when Nick's attention
was most needed, the whip suddenly became idle, and his stock of driving-curses changed to
a shout of alarmed surprise.

Down he dropped upon his knees; and, with head bent low, examined the disturbed surface of
the snow. In an instant Ralph was at his side. The dogs had ceased to pull and crouched down
in their traces. A strange and wonderful thing had happened. In their absence their valley
had been invaded, and the indications were those of human agency.

Nick pointed, and his outstretched forefinger moved slowly over a footprint indicating the
sharp, clean outline which the surface of the snow still retained. A moccasin-covered foot
had trodden there; and the mark left was small, smaller than that of an ordinary man. And the
two heads, almost touching, bent over it in silent scrutiny.

Presently Ralph raised his eyes and looked ahead. Step by step he traced the marks on up the
hill in the direction of the dugout, and, at last, silent speculation gave place to tense,
low-spoken words.

"Injun moccasins," he said.

"Guess so, by the seamin'."

"'Tain't a buck neche, neither."

"No."

There was an impressive pause, and the silent land seemed weighted down as with an atmosphere
of gloomy presage. Nick broke it, and his voice had in it a harsh ring. The fire of passion
was once more alight in his eyes.

"It's a squaw's," he added.

"Yes, sure; a squaw's," and Ralph swallowed a deep breath as though his surroundings stifled him.

A thrill of emotion moved both men. There had leapt within them, in one great, overwhelming
tide, all the old reckless craze for the shadowy creature of Victor's story. At the mere suggestion
of a squaw's presence in that valley their blood-tide surged through their veins like a torrent
of fire, and their pulses were set beating like sledge-hammers. A squaw! A squaw! That was
their cry. Why not the White Squaw?

Whilst Ralph gazed on ahead Nick still bent over the footprint. The delicate shape, the deep
hollow of the ball of the foot, the round cup which marked the heel, and, between them, the
narrow, shallow indentation which formed the high-arched instep. In fancy he built over the
marks the tall, lithe, straight-limbed creature Victor had told them of. He saw the long flowing
hair which fell in a shower upon her shoulders; and the beautiful eyes blue as the summer sky.
In a moment his tanned face was transformed and became radiant.

Ralph, the quiet and thoughtful, was no less moved. But he turned from his brother, hugging
his own anticipations to himself, and concealing them behind a grim mask of impassivity. His
eyes were bright with the same insistent idea, but he told himself that the thing was impossible.
He told himself that She lived in the north, and not even the chase of the far-travelling moose
could have brought her hither from her forest home. These things he said in his caution, but
he did not listen to the voice of his doubt, and his heart beat in great bounding pulsations.

Suddenly Nick sprang from the ground, and short and sharp came his words.

"Let's git on."

"Ay," replied Ralph, and he turned back to the sled.

And again the dogs laid foot to the ground; and again the voice of Nick roused the hollow echoes
of the shimmering peaks; again the song of the sled-runners rose and fell in cadence brisk
and sharp on the still, cold air. But all the world was changed to the men. The stillness was
only the stillness which appeals to the physical senses. There was a sensation of life in the
air; a feeling of living surroundings; a certain knowledge that they were no longer alone in
their valley. A woman was present; the woman.

The widening break of the forest gave place to a broad sloping expanse of snow-land. It was
the hill down which they had travelled many thousands of times. Above, more snow-laden forest,
and above that the steel of the glacier which rose till its awful limits plunged into the grey
world of cloud. The dugout was not yet in view; there was a scored and riven crag, black and
barren, impervious to the soft caresses of velvety snow, to be passed ere the home which was
theirs would be sighted. Besides, as yet neither of the men had turned their eyes from the
trailing footprints to look ahead. Thus they came to the higher ground.

Now the barren crag seemed to thrust itself out, an impassable barrier; a mute protest at further
progress; a grim, silent warning that the home beyond was no longer for them, no longer the
home they had always known. And the hard-breathing dogs toiled on, straining at their breast-harness,
with bodies heaving forward, heads bent low, and quarters drooped to give them surer purchase.
They, too, as though by instinct, followed the footprints. As the marks swung out to pass the
jutting cliff the lead-dog followed their course; Nick, on the right of them, moved wide, and
craned to obtain a first view of the hut. Suddenly he gave a great shout. The dogs dropped
in their harness and crouched, snarling and snapping, their jaws clipping together with the
sound of castanets, whilst their wiry manes rose upon their shoulders bristling with ferocity
which had in it something of fear. Ralph reached his brother's side and peered beyond the cliff.

And as he looked his breath suddenly ceased, and one hand clutched his brother's arm with a
force that bruised the softer flesh, and in silence the two men gaped at the vision which they
beheld. There was what seemed an endless pause while the men and dogs alike focused their gaze
upon the strange apparition.

A figure, calm, serene, stood before the door of the dugout, from which the logs had been removed.
Like a sentry "at ease" the figure stood resting gracefully, leaning upon the muzzle of a long
rifle. Fur crowned the head which was nobly poised, and a framing of flowing dark hair showed
off to perfection the marble-like whiteness of the calm, beautiful face. The robes were characteristic
of the Northern Indians; beads, buckskin and fur. A tunic reached to the knees, and below that
appeared "chaps," which ended where woollen stockings surmounted moosehide moccasins.

A wild, picturesque figure was this creature of the mountain solitude; and, to the wondering
eyes of the two men, something which filled them with superstitious awe and a primitive gladness
that was almost overpowering. The dogs alone seemed to resent the intrusion. There was no joy
in their attitude which was one of angry protest.

Nick broke the silence.

"White--white," he murmured, without knowledge that he spoke aloud.

Ralph's face was working. His excitement, slow to rise, now overwhelmed him, and he answered
in a similar tone.

"That hair," he muttered. "Dark, dark; an' them chaps wi' beads of Injun patte'n. An' the muzzle-loadin'
weapin."

Nick took up the argument as his brother broke off.

"It's a squaw, too."

"Her eyes, he says, was blue," Ralph murmured, breathing hard.

"An' she was leanin' on a gun," Nick added softly.

"It's--"

"By Gar! It is!"

Nick turned to the dogs with the wild impetuosity of a man who knows not the meaning of patience.
His fiery orders fairly hurled the brutes at their task, and the sled leapt forward. On, on,
they sped, till they halted within a few yards of the silent figure.

The woman showed no signs of fear, a matter which both men set down to the fact that she was
a queen among her own people. She still stood in the position in which she had watched their
approach. There was not a quiver of the delicate eyelids, not a tremor of the perfect mouth.
Proud, haughty, and masked by the impassivity of the Indian races, she awaited the coming of
the strangers.

And as men and dogs halted there was an awkwardness. How should they address her? They consulted,
and their whisperings were loud enough to reach her ears. They did not attempt to suppress
their tones unduly. This woman, they knew, did not understand the tongue of the whites, and
probably knew only the language of the Moosefoot people. Therefore they spoke unguardedly.
They admitted to each other the woman's identity. Ralph was for speaking to her in Cree; Nick
for the language of signs. And while they talked the woman looked on. Had they been keenly
observant they would have seen the shadow of an occasional smile curl the corners of her beautiful
lips. As it was they saw only the superb form, and eyes so wondrously blue, shining like sapphires
from an oval face framed with waves of black hair.

At last Ralph advanced toward her.

"You're welcome to our shack," he said, in Cree.

The woman shook her beautiful head, but smiled upon him; and the simple soul felt the blood
rush from heart to head.

"Try signs," said Nick impatiently. "How's the White Squaw o' the Moosefoots goin' to savvee
a low-down bat like Cree. I sed so 'fore."

The blue eyes were turned on Nick with a deep inscrutable smile. Nick felt that life at her
feet was the only life possible.

And Ralph resorted to signs, while Nick alternated his attention between his idolatrous, silent
worship of the lovely woman and clubbing his dogs into quiescence. Their angry protests seemed
to express something more abiding than mere displeasure at the intrusion of a stranger. They
seemed to feel a strong instinctive antagonism toward this beautiful woman.

Ralph persisted with his signs. The woman read them easily and replied in her own sign-language,
which was wonderful to behold. Ralph and Nick read it as though they were listening to a familiar
tongue.

She told them that she was Aim-sa, which is the Moosefoot for "Blue-Sky"; and that she was
the White Squaw, the queen of her people. She indicated that she was out on a "long trail"
hunting, and that she had found herself in this valley, with a snow-storm coming on. She had
seen the dugout and had sought its shelter, intending to remain there until the storm had passed.
She made it clear to them that a bull moose and four cows had entered the valley. She had trailed
them for many days. She asked the brothers if, when the storm had passed, they would join her
in the hunt.

And to all she said Ralph replied in his less perfect signs, prompted by Nick with blundering
impetuosity; and, at the end of the parley, a perfect harmony prevailed. Two great rough men,
with hearts as simple and trusting as those of infants, led this stranger into their home,
and made it clear that the place was hers for so long as she chose to accept their hospitality.

A fire was kindled. A meal was cooked. The hut grew warm and comforting. The dogs outside yelped
pitifully and often snuffed angrily at the sill of the door. And the White Squaw calmly accepted
the throne of that silent world, which had so long known only the joint rule of the two brothers.
She looked out upon her subjects with eyes which drove them wild with adoration, but which
said nothing but that which she chose to convey. Nor did her features betray one single thought
that might chance to be passing in the brain behind. She wore an impenetrable mask of reserve
while she watched the effect of the womanly power she wielded.

And that night saw a change in the ordering of the trappers' household. The two men talked
it over after their meal. Ralph broached the subject.

He waved his arm, the bowl of his pipe gripped in his horny hand, while its stem indicated
the entire hut.

"Hers," he said. And his eyes were dragged from the object of his solicitude and turned upon Nick.

His brother nodded as he puffed at his pipe.

"The shed," Ralph went on. "The huskies must burrow in the snow."

Again Nick nodded.

"Wants sweepin' some," observed Ralph again.

"Yup. We'll fix it."

"Best git to it."

"Ay."

And so the brothers moved out of their home, and went to live in the place which had been given
over to the dogs. They would have done more, far more, in their love for the woman who had
so strangely come into their midst. They felt that it was little enough that they must lie
where the dogs were wont to herd. They needed little comfort, and she must have the best they
could give. And so the brothers moved out of their home.

The snow fell that night; a silent, irresistible mountain snow-storm, without a breath of wind,
in flakes as big as a tennis-ball. Down they ambled, seeming to loiter in indolent playfulness
on the way. And up, up, mounted the earth's white carpet, thicker and thicker, softer and softer.
And at daylight the men confronted eight feet of snow, through which they had to dig their
way. They cleared the dugout that their priceless treasure, the wondrous creature who had come
to them, might see the light of day. And as they laboured the snow continued to fall; and at
night. The next day, and the next, they cleared while the forest below was being slowly buried,
and all the world about them seemed to be choked with the gentle horror.

But Ralph and his brother, Nick, feared nothing. They loved the labour; for was it not on behalf
of the beautiful White Squaw?

CHAPTER VI.

THE WEIRD OF THE WILD

For five days the snow fell without ceasing. Then the weather cleared and the sun shone forth,
and the temperature, which had risen while the ghostly snow filled the air, dropped with a
rush many degrees below zero.

Again the call of the forest came to the two men, claiming them as it ever claims those who
are bred to the craft of trap and fur; and for the first time in their lives, the call was
hearkened to by unwilling ears, ears which sought to turn from the alluring cry, ears that
craved only for the seductive tones of love. But habit was strong upon these woodsmen, and
they obeyed the voice which had always ruled their lives, although with the skeleton of rebellion
in their hearts.

The days passed, and March, the worst month of the mountain winter, was rapidly nearing; and
with it a marked change came over the routine of the Westleys' home. Hitherto Ralph and Nick
were accustomed to carry out their work singly, each scouring the woodlands and valleys in
a direction which was his alone, each making his own bag of furs, which, in the end, would
be turned over to the partnership; but Aim-sa joined them in their hunting, and, somehow, it
came about that the men found it necessary to work together.

They no longer parted at daybreak to meet again when the stealing night shades fell. It became
the custom for a party of three to set out from the hut, and the skilled trappers found themselves
willingly deferring to a woman in the details of their craft, the craft of which they were
acknowledged masters.

But this was not the only change that took place with the coming of the White Squaw. For a
woman of the wild, for a woman who had been bred in the mysterious depths of the northern forests,
away from her fellow creatures, shut off from all associations of men, Aim-sa displayed a wondrous
knowledge of those arts which women practise for the subjugation of the opposite sex. She set
herself the task of administering to her companions' welfare in the manner which has been woman's
from the first. She took to herself the bothersome duties with which no man, however self-reliant,
loves to be burdened. She went further. She demanded and accepted the homage of each of the
brothers, not impartially, but favouring first one and then the other, with the quiet enjoyment
of a woman who looks on at the silent rivalry of two men who seek her smiles.

And as the days lengthened, and the winter crept on toward spring, the peace of the house was
slowly but surely undermined. Eve had appeared in the Garden.

The calm that still remained was as the smooth surface of water about to boil. Beneath it was
chaos which must soon break out into visible tumult. The canker of jealousy fastened itself
like a secret growth upon the uncultured hearts of the men, sapping and undermining that which
was best in their natures.

And Aim-sa looked on with eyes which smiled inscrutably; with silent tongue, and brain ever
busy. In due course she showed signs of beginning to understand her comrades' language. She
even essayed to speak it herself; and, as she stumbled prettily over the words, and placed
them wrongly, she became more and more a source of delight, an object of adoration to the poor
souls who had been so suddenly born to this new life. With keen appreciation she saw these
things while she listened to their speech between themselves, and her great, deep eyes would
wear many varying expressions, chief among which was the dark, abiding smile.

There could be no doubt that what she saw she interpreted aright. She was too clever in everything
else to do otherwise. Nick, impatient, headstrong, could never long conceal his feelings. His
eyes would express displeasure the moment the quieter Ralph chanced to monopolize Aim-sa's
attention. Every smile she bestowed upon the elder brother brought a frown to the younger man's
brow. Every act or look which could be interpreted into an expression of regard for his brother
fired his soul with feelings of aversion and anger till he was well-nigh distracted. Nor was
Ralph any less disturbed. In his undemonstrative way he watched Nick, and suffered the acutest
pangs of jealousy at what he believed was Aim-sa's marked preference. But the woman continued
to stir the fire she had kindled with a childlike naiveté which was less of the wild than of
the drawing-room.

And as day succeeded day, and week followed week, the companionship of these men became forced.
The old tacit understanding was replaced by a feverish desire to talk; and this forced conversation
only helped to widen the rift which was already gaping between them.

One night the friction almost resulted in a blaze.

Ralph was lying prone upon his back, buried to the neck in his "Arctic bag." He was smoking,
as was his custom, while waiting for sleep to come. An oil lamp reeked upon the earthen floor
and threw its bilious rays little further than the blankets spread out upon either side of
it. For a long time Ralph had lain silently gazing up at the frosted rafters above him, while
his brother sat cross-legged at work restringing his snow-shoes with strands of rawhide. Suddenly
Ralph turned his face towards him in silent contemplation. He watched Nick's heavy hands with
eyes that wore a troubled look. Then he abruptly broke the long silence.

"Victor don't know as she's here," he said.

Nick looked up, glanced round the room, shook his head, and bent over his work again.

"No," he answered shortly.

"Maybe he won't jest laff."

"No."

Again came Nick's monosyllabic reply.

"Guess we'd best let him know."

There was a pause. Ralph waited for his brother to speak. As no answer came he went on.

"Who's goin' to tell him?"

Still there was no reply. The silence was broken only by the "ping" of the rawhide strands
which Nick tested as he drew tight.

"We need some fixin's fer her," Ralph went on, a moment later. "Wimmin, I 'lows, has fancies.
Now, maybe, Victor's got a mighty fine show o' print stuffs. A bit o' Turkey red wouldn't come
amiss, I dessay. Likewise beads."

"Maybe."

"Why don't you take the dogs an' run in?"

Nick's hands suddenly became motionless; his eyes were raised until they looked into the face
of his brother. His seared, weather-beaten skin flushed a desperate hue, and his eyes were
alight and shining angrily. His lips twitched with the force of the passion stirring within
him, and for some seconds he held himself not daring to trust to speech.

When at last he answered it was in a tone of fiery abruptness.

"Guess not," he said. And it was Ralph's turn to hold back the anger which rose within him.

"Why?"

"Say, brother," said Nick, with a biting distinctness, "quit right there. Ther' ain't no need
fer another word."

For a moment Ralph peered into the other's face; but he remained silent. Then he turned over
upon his pillow with a sound very like a muttered curse. And from that moment the gulf between
them became impassable. Aim-sa was a subject henceforth tabooed from their conversation. Each
watched the other with distrust, and even hatred, full grown within him.

And soon there came a further disturbing element in that mountain home. It awoke all the dormant
atmosphere of mystery, which, in the minds of the two men, surrounded the lovely Aim-sa. It
awoke afresh the "Dread of the Wild" that had assailed them on their journey north.

It came in the early morning, when the world about them was cloaked in the grey shroud of daylight
mists; when the silent forests above and below them were rendered even more ghostly and sepulchral
by reason of the heavy vapour which depressed all on which it settled. Nick was standing, rifle
in hand, preparing to sling it across his back. Ralph was stooping to adjust his snow-shoes.
Aim-sa had been left within the hut.

A gentle breeze, like the icy breath of some frozen giant on the peak above the hut, came lazily
down the hillside. It broke the fog into a turmoil of protest. The heavy vapour rolled in huge
waves, sought to return to its settled calm, then slowly lifted from the flustered tree-tops.
Another breath, a little stronger than the first, shot forcefully into the heart of the morning
fog and scattered it mercilessly. Then the whole grey expanse solemnly lifted. Up it rose;
nor did it pause until the lower hills were bared, and the wintry sun shone splendidly down
upon the crystal earth.

And as the air cleared the keen eyes of Nick flashed out in a swift survey of the prospect.
Suddenly his breathing was sharply indrawn. His rifle never reached his shoulder, but remained
gripped in his hand. His eyes had become riveted upon a low hill far out across the valley.
It looked as though it rose sheer out of the forest below, but the watching man knew full well
that it was only a spur of the giant that backed it. It was the summit of this clear-cut hill,
and what was visible upon it, that held his fascinated attention. Suddenly a half-whispered
word escaped him and Ralph was beside him in a moment.

"Look!" And Nick's arm was outstretched pointing.

And Ralph looked in time to see the ghostly form of the Hooded Man as it slowly passed from
view over the hill.

"The Hood!" exclaimed Ralph, in awestruck tones.

"Ay."

"What's--what's he doin' here?" Ralph asked, more of himself than of his brother. Then he added:
"He's on our trail."

There was a slight pause.

"It's somethin' on her account," Nick said, at last, with uneasy conviction.

As if actuated by a common thought, both turned and looked back at the hut. Nor was their uneasiness
lessened when they beheld Aim-sa standing directly behind them, gazing out across the woodland
hollow with eyes distended with a great fear. So absorbed was she that she did not observe
the men's scrutiny, and only was her attention drawn to them when she heard Nick's voice addressing
her. Then her lids drooped in confusion and she hastily turned back to the house. But Nick
was not to be denied.

"Ye've seen him," he said sharply; "him wi' the hood?" And he made a motion with his hand which
described the stranger's headgear.

Aim-sa nodded, and Nick went on.

"We seen him up north. On the trail to the Moosefoot."

The woman again nodded. She quite understood now, and her eyes brightened suddenly as she turned
their dazzling depths of blue upon her questioner. She understood these men as they little
thought she understood them.

"It is the Spirit--the Great Spirit," she said, in her broken speech. "The Spirit of--Moosefoot
Indian. Him watches Aim-sa--Queen of Moosefoot. She--White Squaw."

Ralph turned away uneasily. These mysterious allusions troubled him. Nick could not withdraw
his fascinated gaze. Her strange eyes held him captive.

They took her words without a doubt. They accepted all she said without question. They never
doubted her identity with the White Squaw. Primitive superstition deeply moved them.

"You was scared when you see him just now?" said Ralph, questioningly.

Aim-sa nodded.

"He come to--take me," she said, halting over the words. "The Moosefoot--they angry--Aim-sa
stay away."

"Hah!"

Nick thrust his rifle out towards her.

"Here take it. It shoots good. When 'The Hood' comes, shoot--savvee?"

Aim-sa took the gun and turned back to the hut. And the men passed out into the forest.

Aim-sa left the hut soon after the brothers had departed. For long she stood just beyond the
door as though not sure of what she contemplated doing.

And as she stood her eyes travelled acutely over the silent valley. At last, however, she moved
leisurely down the hill. Her easy gait lasted just so long as she was in the open; the moment
she entered the forest her indifference vanished and she raced along in the dark shadow with
all the speed she could summon. The silence, the heavy, depressing atmosphere, the labyrinth
of trees so dark and confusing; these things were no deterrent to her. Her object was distinct
in her mind and she gave heed to nothing else. She ran on over the snow with the silent movements
of some ghostly spirit, and with a swiftness which told of the Indian blood in her veins. Her
dilating eyes flashed about her with the searching gaze of one who expects to see something
appear, while not knowing whence it will come. Her flowing hair trailed from under her cap
with the speed of her going, and the biting air stung her face into a brilliant glow. Her direction
was plainly in her mind, for, though dodging her way through trees, she never deviated from
a certain course; all her thoughts, all her attention, were centred upon the object of her quest.

Nor did she pause till she came to the low hill which stood on the far side of the valley.
As she came to the edge of the forest which skirted its base she drew up and stood for a moment
hesitating. Once she raised a hand to her mouth as though about to give voice to a prolonged
mountain call, but she desisted, and, instead, set out to round the hill, always keeping to
the shadow of the forest edge.

At length she stopped. Her hand went up to her mouth and her head was thrown back, and out
upon the still air rang a cry so mournful that even the forest gloom was rendered more cheerless
by its sound. High it rose, soaring upwards through the trees until the valley rang with its
plaintive wail. As if recognizing the distressful howl of their kind, the cry came back to
her from the deep-toned throats of prowling timber-wolves. The chorus rang in her ears from
many directions as she listened, but the sound? had little effect. As they died down she still
waited in an attitude of attention.

The moments slipped by. Presently she again sent the call hurtling through the trees. Again
came the chorus; again she waited. And the sounds of the chorus were nearer at hand, and a
crackling of undergrowth warned her of the presence of the savage creatures she had summoned.
The deep blue eyes were alert and watchful, but she showed no signs of fear; nor did she move.
Suddenly a less stealthy and more certain crackling of the bush made itself heard; and the
roving eyes became fixed in one direction. Beneath the shadow of the laden boughs a tall grey
figure appeared moving towards her. But this was not all, for several slinking, stealing forms
were moving about amongst the barren tree-trunks; hungry-looking creatures these, with fierce
burning eyes and small pricked ears, with ribs almost bursting through the coarse hides which
covered their low, lank bodies.

But all the woman's attention was centred upon the form of the other--the hooded figure she
had seen in the morning. He came with long, regular strides, a figure truly calculated to inspire
awe. Even now, near as he was to her, there was no sign of his face to be seen. He was clad
in the folds of grey wolfskin, and a cowl-like hood utterly concealed his face, while leaving
him free to see from within.

As the man came up Aim-sa plunged into voluble speech.

They talked together long and earnestly; their tones were of dictation on the part of the woman
and subservience on the part of the man. Then the Spirit of the Moosefoot Indians moved away,
and the White Squaw retraced her steps to the dugout.

A look of triumph was in Aim-sa's blue eyes as she returned through the forest. She gave no
heed to the slinking forms that dogged her steps. She saw nothing of the forest about her;
all her interest was in the dugout and those who lived there.

When she came to the house she received a shock. Nick had returned during her absence. He had
come for the dog sled, and had since brought the vast carcass of a grizzly into camp. Now he
was stripping the rich fur from the forest king's body. The five huskies, with shivering bodies
and jowls dripping saliva, were squatting around upon their haunches waiting for the meal they
hoped would soon be theirs.

The man, still kneeling over his prize, greeted Aim-sa without pausing in his work.

"Wher'?" he asked, sparing his words lest he should confuse her.

The unconcern of the query reassured her.

"The forest," replied Aim-sa easily, pointing away down the hill.

There was a long pause while the woodsman plied his knife with rough but perfect skill. The
thick fur rolled under his hands. The snick, snick of his knife alternated with the sound of
tearing as he pulled the pelt from the under-flesh. Aim-sa watched, interested, then, as Nick
made no further remark, she went on. She pointed back at the forest.

"The wolves--they very thick. Many, many--an' hungry."

"They've left the open. Guess it's goin' to storm, sure," observed the man indifferently. He
wrenched the fur loose from the fore paws.

"Yes--it storm--sure." And Aim-sa gazed critically up at the sky. The usual storm sentries
hung glittering upon either side of the sun, and the blue vault was particularly steely.

Nick rose from his gory task. He drew the fur away and spread it out on the roof of the dugout
to freeze. Then he cut some fresh meat from the carcass, and afterwards dragged the remainder
down the hill and left it for the dogs. The squabble began as soon as he returned to Aim-sa.
A babel of fierce snarling and yapping proceeded as the ruthless beasts tore at the still warm
flesh. And in less than a minute other voices came up from the woods, heralding the approach
of some of the famished forest creatures. Nick gave no heed. The dogs must defend their own.
Such is the law of the wild. He had Aim-sa to himself, and he knew not how long it would be
before his brother returned.

And Aim-sa was in no way loth to linger by this great trapper's side. It pleased her to talk
in her halting fashion to him. He had more to say than his brother; he was a grand specimen
of manhood. Besides, his temperament was wilder, more fierce, more like the world in which
he lived.

She hearkened to the sounds of the snarling wolves and her blue eyes darkened with the latent
savagery that was in her nature.

"The dogs--they fight. Hah!" she said. And a smile of delight was in her eyes.

"Let 'em fight," said Nick, carelessly. Then he turned upon her with a look there was no mistaking.
His whole attitude was expressive of passionate earnestness as he looked down into the blue
worlds which confronted him.

She taunted him with a glance of intense meaning. And, in an instant, the fire in his soul
blazed into an overwhelming conflagration.

"You're that beautiful, Aim-sa," he cried. Then he paused as though his feelings choked him.
"Them blue eyes o' yours goes right clear through me, I guess. Makes me mad. By Gar! you're
the finest crittur in the world."

He looked as though he would devour the fair form which had raised such a storm within his
simple heart. She returned his look with a fearlessness which still had some power to check
his untutored passion. Her smile, too, was not wholly devoid of derision; but that was lost
upon him.

"Aim-sa--beautiful. Ah! yes--yes, I know. You speak love to me. You speak love to White Squaw."

"Ay, love," cried Nick, the blood mounting with a rush to his strong face. "Guess you don't
know love, my girl. Not yet. But mebbe you will. Say, Aim-sa, I'll teach it ye. I'll teach
it ye real well, gal. You'll be my squaw, an' we'll light right out o' here. I've got half
share in our pile, an' it ain't a little. Jest say right here as ye'll do it, an' I'll fix
things, an' hitch up the dogs."

Nick paused in his eloquence. The squaw's eyes danced with delight, and he read the look to
suit himself. Already he anticipated a favourable answer. But he was quickly undeceived. Aim-sa
merely revelled in the passion she had aroused, like a mischievous child with a forbidden plaything.
She enjoyed it for a moment, then her face suddenly became grave, and her eyelids drooped over
the wonderful eyes which he thought had told him so much. And her answer came with a shake
of the head.

"Aim-sa loves not. She must not. The Moosefoot--she is Queen."

"Curses on the Moosefoot, I say," cried Nick, with passionate impulse.

Aim-sa put up her hand.

"The man--'The Hood.' Fear the Spirit."

A chill shot down through Nick's heart as he listened. But his passion was only checked for
the moment. The next and he seized the woman in his powerful arms and drew her to his breast,
and kissed her not too unwilling lips. The kiss maddened him, and he held her tight, while
he sought her blindly, madly. He kissed her cheeks, her hair, her eyes, her lips, and the touch
of her warm flesh scorched his very soul. Nor is it possible to say how long he would have
held her had she not, by a subtle, writhing movement, slipped from within his enfolding arms.
Her keen ears had caught a sound which did not come from the fighting dogs. It was the penetrating
forest cry in the brooding mountain calm.

"Remember--'The Hood,'" Aim-sa warned him. And the next moment had vanished within the dugout.

Now Nick knew that he too had heard the cry, and he stood listening, while his passion surged
through his veins and his heart beat in mighty pulsations. As he gazed over the forest waste,
he expected to see the mysterious hooded figure.

But what he beheld brought an angry flush to his cheeks. He did not see "The Hood," but Ralph
walking slowly up the hill.

And a harsh laugh which had no mirth in it broke from him. Then a frown settled darkly upon
his brow. What, he asked himself, had Ralph returned for? He bore no burden of skins.

And when Ralph looked up and saw Nick whom he believed to be miles away, his heart grew bitter
within him. He read the look on the other's face. He saw the anger, and a certain guiltiness
of his own purpose made him interpret it aright. And in a flash he resolved upon a scheme which,
but for what he saw, would never have presented itself to him.

And as the gleaming sun-dogs, drooping so heavily yet angrily in the sky, heralded the coming
storm of elements, so did that meeting of the two brothers threaten the peace of the valley.

CHAPTER VII.

IN THE STORMING NIGHT

The love of these men for the fair creature of the wild had risen to fever-heat with the abruptness
of tropical sunshine. It was no passing infatuation, but the deep-rooted, absorbing passion
of strong simple men; a passion which dominated their every act and thought; a passion which
years alone might mellow into calm affection, but which nothing could eradicate. It had come
into their lives at a time when every faculty was at its ripest; henceforth everything would
be changed. The wild, to them, was no longer the wild they had known; it was no longer theirs
alone. Their life had gathered to itself a fresh meaning; a meaning drawn from association
with Woman, and from which it could never return to the colourless existence of its original
solitude.

With the return of Ralph to the camp the day progressed in sullen silence. Neither of the men
would give way an inch; neither would return to the forest to complete his day's work, and
even Aim-sa found their morose antagonism something to be feared. Each watched the other until
it seemed impossible for the day to pass without the breaking of the gathering storm. But,
however, the time wore on, and the long night closed down without anything happening to precipitate
matters.

The evening was passed in the woman's company. Ralph sat silent, brooding. While Nick, with
the memory of the wild moments during which he had held Aim-sa in his embrace fresh upon him,
held a laboured conversation with her. To him there was a sense of triumph as he sat smoking
his blackened pipe, listening to the halting phrases of the woman, and gazing deeply into her
wonderful blue eyes. And in the ecstasy of recollection he forgot Ralph and all but his love.
There was no generosity in his heart; he had given himself up to the delights of his passion.
He claimed the fair Aim-sa to himself, and was ready to uphold his claim so long as he had life.

All that long evening he heeded nothing of the dark expression of Ralph's face. The furtive
glances from his brother's eyes were lost upon him, and even had he seen them their meaning
would have had no terrors for him. With all the blind selfishness of a first love he centred
his faculties upon obtaining Aim-sa's regard, and lived in the fool's paradise of a reckless lover.

And all the time Ralph watched, and planned. The bitterness of his heart ate into the uttermost
part of his vitals, the canker mounted even to his brain. The deep fire of hatred was now blazing
furiously, and each moment it gathered destructive force. All that was good in the man was
slowly devoured, and only a shell of fierce anger remained.

But what Nick failed to observe Aim-sa saw as plainly as only a woman can see such things.
Her bright eyes saw the fire she had kindled, and from sheer wantonness she fanned the flame
with all the art of which she was mistress.

Slowly the hours passed. It was Nick who at last rose and gave the signal for departure. It
was an unwritten law between these two that when one left Aim-sa's presence they both left
it. Therefore Ralph followed suit, and they retired to their sleeping-apartment.

Outside the night was fine, but the threat of storm hung heavily in the air. The temperature
had risen, a sure indication of the coming blizzard. Ralph was the last to leave the woman's
presence, and, ere he closed the door, he looked back at the smiling face, so beautiful to
him, so seductively fair in his eyes; and the memory of the picture he looked upon remained
with him. He saw the dull-lit interior, with its rough woodsman's belongings; the plastered
walls of logs, coarse and discoloured; the various utensils hanging suspended from five-inch
spikes driven in the black veins of timber; the blazing stove and crooked stovepipe; the box
of tin dishes and pots; the sides of bacon hanging from the roof; the pile of sacks containing
biscuit and dried fish, the latter for the dogs; the outspread blankets which formed the woman's
bed; and in the midst of it all the dazzling presence of Aim-sa, fair as the twilight of a
summer evening.

The door closed softly, and as it closed Aim-sa rose from her blankets. Her expression had
changed, and while the men went to their humble couches she moved about with feverish haste,
attentive to the least sound, but always hurried, and with a look of deep anxiety in her alert
eyes.

No word was spoken as the men rolled into their blankets. The thick wall shut out all sound
from within the hut. The night was intensely still and silent. Not even was there a single
wolf-howl to awaken the echoes of the towering hills. It was as though all nature was at rest.

Nick was soon asleep. Not even the agitation of mind caused by a first love could keep him
long awake when the hour for sleep came around. With Ralph it was different. His nature was
intenser. His disposition was capable of greater disturbance than was that of the more impetuous
Nick. He remained awake; awake and alert. He smoked in the darkness more from habit than enjoyment.
Although he could see nothing his eyes constantly wandered in the direction of the man beside
him, and he listened for the heavy breathing which should tell him of the slumber which would
endure till the first streak of dawn shot athwart the sky. Soon it came; and Nick snored heavily.

Then, without sound, Ralph sat up in his blankets. He bent his head towards the sleeper, and,
satisfied, rose softly to his feet. Opening the door he looked out. All was profoundly quiet
and black. Not a star shone in the sky, nor was there a sign of the dancing northern lights.
And while he stood he heard for the first time that night the cry of some distant forest creature;
but the timber-wolves kept silent in the depths below the hut. He drew the door to behind him
and moved out into the night.

Cold as it was he was consumed by a perfect fever of agitation. His thoughts were in a state
of chaos, but the one dominant note which rang out with clarion-like distinctness was that
which drew him towards Aim-sa's door. And thither he stole softly, silently, with the tiptoeing
of a thief, and with the nervous quakings of a wrong-doer. His face was wrought with fear,
with hope, with the eagerness of expectancy.

He passed from the deeper shadows in which the lean-to was bathed, and stood at the angle of
the house. He paused, and a flurrying of the snow at his feet warned him that he had stepped
close to the burrow of one of Nick's huskies. He moved quickly aside, and the movement brought
him beyond the angle. Then he stood stock-still, held motionless as he saw that the door of
the dugout was open and the light of the oil-lamp within was illuminating the beaten snow which
fronted the house. He held his breath. Again and again he asked himself the meaning of the
strange phenomenon.

From where he stood he could see only the light; the doorway was hidden by the storm-porch.
But, as he strained his eyes in the direction and craned forward, he became aware of a shadow
on the snow where the lamp threw its dull rays. Slowly he scanned the outline of it, and his
mind was moved by speculation. The shadow was uncertain, and only that which was nearest the
door was recognizable. Here there was no mistake; some one was standing in the opening, and
that some one could only be Aim-sa.

He was filled with excitement and his heart beat tumultuously; a frenzy of delight seized upon
him, and he stepped forward swiftly. A moment later he stood confronting her.

Just for one moment Aim-sa's face took on a look of dismay, but it passed before Ralph had
time to read it. Then she smiled a glad welcome up at the keen eyes which peered down into
her own, and her voice broke the silence in a gentle, suppressed tone.

"Quiet--quiet. The night. The storm is near. Aim-sa watches."

Ralph turned his face out upon the blackness of the valley, following the direction of the
woman's gaze.

"Ay, storm," he said mechanically, and his heart pounded within his breast, and his breath
came and went heavily. Then, in the pause which followed, he started and looked towards the
lean-to as a sound came from that direction. He was half-fearful of his sleeping brother.

Aim-sa's eyes turned towards the rugged features before her, and her gaze was of an intensity
such as Ralph could not support in silence. Words blundered unbidden to his lips, uncontrolled,
and he spoke as a man who scarce knows what he is saying. His mind was in the throes of a fever,
and his speech partook of the irrelevance of delirium.

"You must live with me," he said, his brows frowning with the intensity of his passion. "You
must be my wife. The white man takes a squaw, an' he calls her 'wife,' savvee? Guess he ain't
like the Injuns that has many squaws. He jest takes one. You'll be my squaw, an' we'll go away
from here."

A smile was in the woman's blue eyes, for her memory went back to the words Nick had spoken
to her that morning.

Ralph went on.

"Guess I love you that bad as makes me crazy. Ther' ain't nothin' to life wi'out you." His
eyes lowered to the ground; then they looked beyond her, and he gazed upon the disordered condition
of the room without observing it. "Nick don't need me here. He can have the shack an' everything,
'cep' my haf share o' the money. Guess we'll trail north an' pitch our camp on the Peace River.
What say?"

Aim-sa's eyes were still smiling. Every word Nick had spoken was vivid in her memory. She looked
as though she would laugh aloud, but she held herself in check, and the man took her smile
for one of acquiescence and became bolder. He stretched out his hand and caught hers in his
shaking grasp.

"The white man loves--Aim-sa," the woman said, softly, while she yielded her two hands to him.

"Love? Ay, love. Say, ther' ain't nothin' in the world so beautiful as you, Aim-sa, an' that's
a fac'. I ain't never seen nothin' o' wimmin before, 'cep' my mother, but I guess now I've
got you I can't do wi'out you, you're that soft an' pictur'-like. Ye've jest got to say right
here that you're my squaw, an' everything I've got is yours, on'y they things I leave behind
to Nick."

"Ah," sighed the woman, "Nick--poor Nick. He loves--Aim-sa, too. Nick is great man."

"Nick loves you? Did he get tellin' ye so?"

There was a wild, passionate ring in Ralph's question.

The squaw nodded, and the man's expression suddenly changed. The passionate look merged into
one of fiery anger, and his eyes burned with a low, dark fire. Aim-sa saw the sudden change,
but she still smiled in her soft way.

"An' you?"

The voice of the man was choking with suppressed passion. His whole body trembled with the
chaos of feeling which moved him.

The woman shook her head.

"An' what did ye say?" he went on, as she remained silent.

"Nick is great. No, Aim-sa not loves Nick."

Ralph sighed with relief, and again the fiery blood swept through his veins. He stepped up
close to her and she remained quite still. The blue eyes were raised to his face and Aim-sa's
lips parted in a smile. The effect was instantaneous. Ralph seized her in a forceful embrace,
and held her to him whilst he gasped out the passionate torrent of his love amidst an avalanche
of kisses. And they stood thus for long, until the man calmed and spoke with more practical
meaning.

"An' we go together?" he asked.

Aim-sa nodded.

"Now?"

The woman shook her head.

"No--sunrise. I wait here."

Again they stood; he clasping her unresisting form, while the touch of her flowing hair intoxicated
him, and the gentle rise and fall of her bosom drove all thought wild within him.

They stood for many minutes; till at last the still night was stirred by the rustling herald
of the coming storm. The long-drawn-out sigh of the wind, so sad, so weird in the darkness
of night would have passed unheeded by the man, but Aim-sa was alert, and she freed herself
from his embrace.

"At sunrise," she said. "Now--sleep." And she made a sign as of laying her head upon a pillow.

Ralph stood irresolute. Suddenly Aim-sa started. Her whole bearing changed. A swift, startled
gaze shot from beneath her long, curling lashes in the direction of the distant hills. A tiny
glimmer of light had caught her attention and she stepped back on the instant and passed into
the hut, closing the door softly but quickly behind her. And when she had disappeared Ralph
stood as one dazed.

The significance of Aim-sa's abrupt departure was lost upon him. For him there was nothing
unusual in her movements. She had been there, he had held her in his arms, he had kissed her
soft lips. He had tasted of love, and the mad passion had upset his thoughtful nature. His
mind and his feelings were in a whirl and he thrilled with a delicious joy. His thoughts were
so vivid that all sense of that which was about him, all caution, was obscured by them. At
that moment there was but one thing that mattered to him,--Aim-sa's love. All else was as nothing.

So it came that the faint light on the distant hills burned steadily; and he saw it not. So
it came that a shadowy figure moved about at the forest edge below him; and he saw it not.
So it came that the light breath from the mountain-top was repeated only more fiercely; and
he heeded it not. In those moments he was living within himself; his thoughts were his world,
and those thoughts were of the woman he had kissed and held in his arms.

Nothing gave him warning of the things which were doing about him. He saw no tribulation in
the sea upon which he had embarked. He loved; that was all he knew. Presently like a sleep-walker
he turned and moved around towards the deeper shadow of the lean-to. Then, when he neared the
door of the shed in which his brother was, he seemed to partially awake to his surroundings.
He knew that he must regain his bed without disturbing Nick. With this awakening he pulled
himself together. To-morrow at sunrise he and the squaw were to go away, and long he lay awake,
thinking, thinking.

Now the shadow hovering at the forest edge became more distinct as it neared the house; it
came slowly, stealing warily up the snow-clad hill. There was no scrunch of footsteps, the
snow muffled all such sounds. It drew nearer, nearer, a tall, grey, ghostly shadow that seemed
to float over the white carpet which was everywhere spread out upon the earth. And as it came
the wind rose, gusty and patchy, and the hiss of rising snow sounded stingingly upon the night
air, and often beat with the force of hail against the front of the dugout.

Within a few yards of the hut the figure came to a halt. Thus it stood, immovable, a grey sombre
shadow in the darkness of night. Then, after a long pause, high above the voice of the rising
wind the howl of the wolf rang out. It came like a cry of woe from a lost soul; deep-toned,
it lifted upon the air, only to fall and die away lost in the shriek of the wind. Thrice came
the cry. Then the door of the dugout opened and Aim-sa looked out into the relentless night.

The figure moved forward again. It drew near to the door, and, in the light, the grey swathing
of fur became apparent, and the cavernous hood lapping about the head identified the Spirit
of the Moosefoot Indians. Then followed a low murmur of voices. And again the woman moved back
into the hut. The grey figure waited, and a moment later Aim-sa came to him again. Shortly
after the door closed and the Spirit moved silently away.

All was profoundly dark. The darkness of the night was a darkness that could be felt, for the
merciless blizzard of the northern latitudes was raging at its full height. The snow-fog had
risen and all sign of trail or footstep was swept from the icy carpet. It was a cruel night,
and surely one fit for the perpetration of cruel deeds.

And so the night passed. The elements warring with the fury of wildcats, with the shrieking
of fiends, with the roaring of artillery, with the merciless severity of the bitter north.
And while the storm swept the valley the two brothers slept; even Ralph, although torn by such
conflicting emotions, was lulled, and finally won to sleep by the raging elements whose voices
he had listened to ever since his cradle days.

But even his slumbers were broken, and strange visions haunted his night hours. There was none
of the peacefulness of his usual repose--the repose of a man who has performed his allotted
daylight task. He tossed and twisted within his sleeping-bag. He talked disjointedly and flung
his arms about; and, finally, while yet it was dark, he awoke.

Springing into a sitting posture, he peered about him in the darkness. Everything came back
to his mind with a rush. He remembered his appointment at sunrise, and he wondered how long
he had slept. Again he crept to the shed door. Again he looked out and finally passed out.
Nick still slumbered heavily.

The fury of the elements was unabated and they buffeted him; but he looked around and saw the
grey daylight illuminating the snow-fog, and he knew that though sunrise was near it was not
yet. He passed around the hut, groping with his hands upon the building until he came to the
door. Here he paused. He would awake Aim-sa that she might prepare for her flight with him.
There was much to be done. He was about to knock but altered his mind and tried the latch.
It yielded to his touch and the door swung back.

He did not pause to wonder, although he knew that it was Aim-sa's custom to secure the door.
He passed within, and in a hoarse whisper called out the name that was so dear to him. There
came no answer and he stood still, his senses tense with excitement. He called again, again.
Still there was no answer. Now he closed the door, which creaked over the snow covering the
sill. He stood listening lest Nick should be moving on the other side of the wall, and to ascertain
if Aim-sa had awakened and was fearful at the intrusion. But no sound except the rage of the
storm came to him.

His impatience could no longer be restrained; he plunged his hand into the pocket of his buckskin
shirt and drew out a box of matches. A moment later a light flashed out, and in one sweeping,
comprehensive glance around him he realized the truth. The hut was empty. "Gone, gone," he
muttered, while, in rapid survey, his eyes glanced from one familiar object to another.

Everything was out of place, there were signs of disorder everywhere; and the woman was gone.

Suddenly the wind rushed upon the house with wild violence and set everything in the place
a-clatter. He lit the lamp. Then he seemed to collect himself and went over and felt the stove.
It was ice cold. The blankets were laid out upon the floor in the usual spread of the daytime.
They had not been slept in.

Into his eyes there leapt a strange, wild look. The truth was forcing itself upon him, and
his heart was racked with torment.

"She's gone," he muttered again, "an'," as an afterthought, "it's storming terrible. When the human mind through the ideas of the modifications of its
body contemplates external bodies, we say that it then imagines, nor
can the mind in any other way imagine external bodies as actually
existing.

Therefore in so far as the mind imagines external bodies it does not possess an adequate knowledge
of them.

II

The idea of a modification of the human body does not involve an adequate
knowledge of the body itself, or, in other words, does not adequately
express its nature, that is to say, it does not correspond adequately
with the nature of the human mind, and therefore the idea of this
idea does not adequately express the nature of the human mind, nor
involve an adequate knowledge of it.

From this it is evident that the human mind, when it perceives things in the common order of Nature,
has no adequate knowledge of itself nor of its own body, nor of external bodies, but only a confused
and mutilated knowledge; for the mind does not know itself unless in so far as it perceives the ideas
of the modifications of the body. Moreover, it does not perceive its body unless through those
same ideas of the modifications by means of which alone it perceives
external bodies.

Therefore in so far as it possesses these ideas it possesses an adequate
knowledge neither of itself, nor of its body, nor of external bodies,
but merely a mutilated and confused knowledge.

I say expressly that the mind has no adequate knowledge of itself,
nor of its body, nor of external bodies, but only a confused knowledge,
as often as it perceives things in the common order of Nature, that
is to say, as often as it is determined to the contemplation of this
or that externally--namely, by a chance coincidence, and not as often
as it is determined internally--for the reason that it contemplates
several things at once, and is determined to understand in what they
differ, agree, or oppose one another; for whenever it is internally
disposed in this or in any other way, it then contemplates things
clearly and distinctly.

III

The duration of our body does not depend upon its essence, nor upon
the absolute nature of God, but the body is determined to existence
and action by causes which also are determined by others to existence
and action in a certain and determinate manner, whilst these, again,
are determined by others, and so on ad infinitum.

 The only inhabitants of the hut on the wild hillside that offered no complaint,
and even seemed to welcome the change, were Nick's huskies. They displayed a better temper
since the going of the White Squaw, although the change in their attitude was unheeded by their
masters.

The antagonism of the men was no longer masked by sullen silence. It broke out into open hostility
almost the moment their loss was discovered, and it took the form of bickering and mutual reprisal.
Nick laid the charge of her departure at Ralph's door. Applying all the most unreasonable arguments
in support of his belief. Ralph retaliated with a countercharge, declaring that Nick had caused
her flight by thrusting his unwelcome attentions upon her. And every word they uttered on the
subject added fuel to the fire of their hatred, and often they were driven to the verge of blows.

Nick had no reason in him; and, in his anger, Ralph was little better. But where a certain
calmness came to the latter when away from his brother, Nick continued to fume with his mind
ever set upon what he regarded as only his loss. Thus it came that Ralph saw ahead, hazily
it is true, but he saw that the time had come when they must part. It was impossible for them
to continue to shelter under the same roof, the roof which had covered them since the days
of their earliest recollections.

But though he saw this necessity, he did not broach the subject, for, like his brother, he
looked forward to the abatement of the storm so that he might set out in search of the lost
one. Besides, he felt that until Aim-sa was found he could not part from Nick. Even in his
hatred for his brother, even in his calmest moments, jealousy supervened. Were they to part,
Nick might be the one to find her, and then--No, they must wait till the storm had passed,
afterwards it would be time to act. Meanwhile, by tacit consent, they continued to live in
the lean-to, reserving the dugout for the object of their love, against her return.

At length the weather cleared. The search began at once. Each day they set out for the forest
and hills with hope buoying their hearts; and each night they returned with downcast looks,
despair in their hearts, and with their brooding anger against each other a dark flame leaping
within them.

Sometimes, in stolen moments, they visited the place Aim-sa had lived in. Every day Ralph would
clean up the dugout and leave it ready for the White Squaw's occupation when she returned.
Every article of furniture had its allotted place, the place which she had selected. With the
utmost deliberation he would order everything, and never had their mountain home been so tenderly
cared for. Then Nick would come. His brother's handiwork would drive him to a frenzy of anger,
and he would reset the place to his own liking, at which Ralph's exasperation would break out
in angry protest.

The metamorphosis of these men could not have been more complete. They hated themselves, they
grew to hate the home which was theirs, the wild in which they lived. They set their traps
and hunted because it was their habit to do so, but always with only secondary thought for
their calling. The chief object of their lives was to find the woman who had taught them the
meaning of love.

Winter was waning. The soft snow in the forest was melting rapidly. Every morning found their
valley buried beneath a pall of white fog. The sun's power was rapidly increasing, and already
a slush of snow-water was upon the ice-bound river. The overpowering heights of the valley
gleamed and sparkled in the cheery daylight; the clear mountain air drew everything nearer,
and the stifling sense, inspired by the crush of towering hills, was exaggerated as the sun
rose in the heavens and revealed the obscurer recesses of the stupendous world. And now, too,
the forest grew dank and moist, and the steady dripping of the melting snow upon the branches
became like a heavy rainfall within the gloomy depths.

One day Ralph returned home first. He was cooking the supper. The sun was dipping behind the
western mountain-tops, and the red gold reflection swept in a rosy flush over the crystal summits.
The winter sky had given place to the deeper hue of spring, and, in place of the heavy grey
cloud-caps, fleecy puffs of white, little less dazzling than the snowy hills themselves, dotted
the azure vault above. The forest was alive with the cries of the feathered world, as they
sought their rest in their newly-built nests. It was not the bright chatter of gay song-birds
such as belong to warmer climes, but the hoarse cries of water-fowl, and the harsh screams
of the preying lords of wing and air. The grey eagle in his lofty eyrie; the gold-crested vulture-hawk;
creatures that live the strenuous life of the silent lands, fowl that live by war. The air
was very still; the prospect perfect with a wild rugged beauty.

The train dogs were lying about lazily, but their attitude was deceptive. Their fierce eyes
were only partially closed, and they watched the cook at his work, waiting for their share
in the meal.

Presently a sharp snarl broke from one of them, and he sprang to his feet and walked round
his neighbour in a hectoring fashion. Ralph just glanced up from his work, his attitude expressing
indifference. The second dog rose leisurely, and a silent argument over some old-time dispute
proceeded in true husky fashion. They walked round and round each other, seeming almost to
tiptoe in their efforts to browbeat. Their manes bristled and their fangs bared to the gums,
but never a sound came from their deep-toned throats. And such is ever the way of the husky,
unless stirred to the wildest fury. The other dogs paid no heed; the smell which emanated from
Ralph's cooking-pot held them. Those who wished to fight could do so; their indifference plainly
said so.

Ralph went to the shed and returned with some fresh logs. As he reached the fire he paused.
The disputing dogs had attracted his attention. A quick spring in and out, a slash of the bared
fangs, and the shoulder of one dog was laid open. The other brutes were on their feet in an
instant. The scent of blood had greater attraction for their wolfish senses than the smell
of cooking food. They gathered round with licking lips. Ralph stepped back from the fire and
raised aloft one of the logs he had brought. The next moment it was hurtling through the air.
It took the combatants somewhere in the midst. They parted, with a howl of pain, and the spectators
hurriedly returned to their contemplation of the fire. In a moment temporary peace was restored.
Ralph stood to see that hostilities were definitely postponed, then he went on with his work.

Suddenly, up out of the valley came the sound of Nick's voice. It trolled harshly up the hillside,
giving out strange echoes which confused the melody he essayed. The listening man recognized
the words of "The Red River Valley," but the tune was obscured.

The unusual outburst held Ralph silent, wondering. Nick was not given to singing at any time,
and the events of the last few days were not likely to inspire him. What had caused the change?

The voice sounded nearer. In spite of the tunelessness of the song, Ralph thought he detected
a joyousness in the tone which was unusual. A shiver passed down his back, and his thoughts
flew at once to Aim-sa.

Gazing down the hill he saw Nick emerge from the forest and face the slope at a swinging pace.
His powerful limbs moved easily, with a springiness of stride that was not natural to a man
accustomed to the labours of the "long trail." His face was no longer bathed in desponding
gloom; his eyes were shining, and his strong features had upon them an expression of triumph.
He brought with him an atmosphere as fresh and joyous as the dawn of a mountain summer sky.

Over his shoulder were slung several moist pelts, newly taken from the carcasses of golden
foxes, and in his hand he carried two large traps, which he was bringing home for repair. But
these things were passed unheeded by his brother; it was the voice, and the look upon his face
that unpleasantly fixed Ralph's attention. But a further astonishment came to the waiting man.
Nick shouted a greeting as he came.

"A great day, Ralph," he cried. "Two o' the finest yeller-bellies I've seed. Most as big as
timber-wolves."

Ralph nodded, but said no word. He knew without being told that it was not the pleasure of
such a catch which had urged Nick to cordiality. He watched the coming of his brother with
his quiet, steady eyes, and what he beheld beat his heart down, down, as though with the fall
of a sledge-hammer.

As Nick's overtures met with no response, he said no more, but came and stood beside the spluttering
fire, while his eyes searched the gloomy face of his brother. Then, with an impatient movement,
he threw his traps down and removed the pelts from his shoulder. He passed over to the dugout
and spread the reeking hides upon the roof, well out of reach of the dogs; then he returned
in silence to the fire.

His coming had been the signal for a renewal of hostilities among the dogs, and now a sharp
clip of teeth drew his attention. The two beasts Ralph had separated were at it again. Nick
seized a pole and trounced them impartially till they scattered out of his reach.

A portentous silence followed. Nick was casting about in his mind for something agreeable to
say. He felt good. So good that he did not want to tell Ralph what was in his mind. He wanted
to be sociable, he wanted to break through the icy barrier which had risen between them; he
felt that he could afford to do so. But ideas were not forthcoming. He had but one thought
in his brain, and when, at last, he spoke it was to blurt out the very thing he would withheld.

"I've seen her," he said, in a voice tense with emotion.

And Ralph had known it from the moment he had heard his brother singing. He looked up from
his cooking-pot, and his fork remained poised above the black iron lid. At last his answer
came in a hoarse whisper.

"Her?"

"Yes, I spoke to her, I guess."

"Spoke to her?"

And the whites of the elder man's eyes had become bloodshot as he stood up from his crouching
attitude over the fire.

His stolid face was unmoved, only his eyes gave expression to that which passed behind them.
There was a dangerous look in their sunken depths which the depressed brows accentuated. He
looked into his brother's face, and, for awhile, the supper was forgotten.

"Yes, spoke to her," said Nick, emphatically. "She ain't gone from us. She ain't left this
valley. She's scairt o' the Moosefoots. That all-fired 'Hood.' She said as they were riled
that she'd stopped in the white man's lodge. Said they'd made med'cine an' found out where
she'd gone. Say, that 'Hood' is the very devil, I'm thinkin'. She's scairt to death o' him."

But though Ralph listened to his brother's words he seemed to pay little heed. The blow had
fallen on him with stunning force. Nick had seen Aim-sa; he had been with her that day, perhaps
all day. And at the thought he broke out in a sweat. Something seemed to rise up in his throat
and choke him.

"You look that glad. Maybe you've had a good time."

Ralph's words came as though he were thinking aloud.

The devil stirred in Nick's heart.

"Glad, man? Glad? Ay, I am that, surely. She said as she'd been on the watch fer me ever since
the storm quit. She said as she wanted to hunt wi' me."

"You?"

"An' why not? I ain't lyin', I guess. I 'lows she ain't like to say they things fer passin'
time. She was allus easy an' free wi' me. Mebbe you're kind o' quiet. Wimmin mostly likes them
as ken talk."

Ralph's eyes darkened. His set face became more rigid. Then suddenly a harsh laugh broke from
his unmoving lips.

"Guess you're crazed, Nick. That woman's foolin' ye."

Then he swung about as the sound of a violent struggle came from among the dogs. It was the
saving interruption. Another moment and the brooding hate of the two men would have broken
loose. Nick turned, too. And he was just in time; for one of the huskies was down and the rest
of the train were upon him, bent on tearing out the savage life. Nick clubbed them right and
left, nor did he desist till the torn beast was upon his feet again, ready to face his antagonists
with undiminished courage. The husky knows no other termination to a quarrel than the fight
to the death.

It took Nick some minutes to restore peace among his dogs, and by the time this was accomplished
his own feelings had calmed. Ralph, recognizing the danger of his mood, had gripped himself
sternly, and returned to his cooking.

And so the crisis was passed and the disaster temporarily averted. But in their hearts both
men knew that the savage wild, ingrained in their natures, would not always be so easily stifled.
Unless they parted, a dire calamity must surely befall.

CHAPTER IX.

TO THE DEATH

The forest gloom is broken by gladdening beams of sunlight. They sketch a mazy fretwork pattern
of light and shade on the dank underlay of rotting vegetation which the melting snow has laid
bare. The air is weighted down with heavy, resinous odours, and an enervating warmth has descended
to the depths of the lower forests. But Winter has not yet spread its wings for its last flight.
Spring's approach has been heralded by its feathered trumpeters, garbed in their sober plumage.
It is on its way, that is all. The transition of the seasons is at hand. Winter still resists,
and the gentle legions of Spring have yet to fight out their annual battle. The forests are
astir with wild, furred life; the fierce life which emphasizes the solitude of the mountain
world. The pine-cones scrunch under the feet of the prowling beast as he moves solemnly upon
his dread way; there is a swish of bush or a snapping of wood as some startled animal seeks
cover; or a heavy crashing of branches, as the mighty-antlered moose, solemn-eyed, unheeding,
thrusts himself through the undergrowth.

Ralph was bending over a large trap. It was still set although the bait had been removed. It
had been set at the mouth of a narrow track where it opened out in a small, snow-covered clearing.
The blood stains of the raw meat with which it had been baited were still moist, but the flesh
itself had been taken. He turned from his inspection. There were footprints in the snow, evidently
the tracks of a timber-wolf. His face expressed his disgust as he rebaited the trap. Wolves
were the pest of his life. Their skins were almost worthless, and they were as cunning as any
dog-fox. A trap had no terrors for them. He moved away to continue on his journey. Suddenly
he drew up and scanned the white carpet. His trailing instincts were keenly alert.

The snow was disturbed by other marks than those made by the wolf. In places the ground was
laid bare, and broken pine-cones were displayed upon its surface as though some great weight
had crushed them. Moose suggested itself. He looked keenly at the marks. No, the snow displayed
no imprint of cloven hoofs. It looked as though it had been raked by a close-set harrow. To
him there was much significance in what he saw. Only one creature could have left such a track.
There was but one animal in that forest world that moved with shambling gait, and whose paws
could rake the snow in such a manner. That animal was the grizzly, the monarch of the mountain
forest.

The man looked further over the snow, and, in a few moments, had learned all he wished to know.
There were two distinct trails, one approaching, the other departing. But there was a curious
difference between them. The approach had evidently been at a slovenly, ambling pace. The raking
of the trailing feet showed this. But the departing track displayed every sign of great haste.
The snow had been flurried to an extent that had obliterated all semblance of footprints.

Ralph unslung his rifle. Ahead of him was the track, ahead of him also was a further break
in the forest where the sun shone down with dazzling brilliancy. He passed on and looked up
at the perfect sky. Then he took the direction of the track. It struck out for the northeast.

"I wonder if Nick's lit on it," he muttered. "It 'ud be his luck, anyway."

He further examined the tracks, and the whiteness of the snow warned him they were quite fresh.

"Ain't been made more'n an hour," he added, in further soliloquy. "Guess, I'll trail him."

And he set off hot-foot through the forest.

The trail was well marked, and he followed it with ease. And as he moved slowly on his mind
had much leisure from his task. The direction the bear had taken was towards the country over
which Nick was working. Also Ralph could not help recollecting that the northeast was the direction
in which lay the Moosefoot camp. True there were many miles of wild country between him and
the Indians, but the knowledge of the direction he was taking quickly turned his thoughts into
other channels, and his quarry no longer solely occupied his mind. His eyes followed the trail,
his thoughts went on miles ahead.

It was three days since Nick had first told Ralph of his meeting with Aim-sa. And ever since
the latter had sought her himself, but his search had been in vain. And each of those three
days Nick had returned to camp happy and smiling in a manner which maddened his brother. Now
he thought of these things. He told himself, with warped reasoning, that Nick had gone behind
his back, that he had taken undue advantage in his winning of Aim-sa's regard. He forgot, or
admitted not, his own doings, his own secret meeting with her on the night of her flight from
the dugout.

Such was his mood as he traversed the forest paths. Through dell and brake; through endless
twilight maze of black tree-trunks; over moss-grown patches, and roots and stumps reeking with
the growth of rank fungus. But his eyes never lost the indications of his quarry, and at intervals
he paused listening for some sound which should tell him of the beast's proximity.

A frozen creek crossed his way. The surface was covered with the watery slush of melting snow,
and great cracks ran in many directions through the ice.

He crossed it and the forest closed about him again. The beast he was trailing had paused here,
had moved roundabout as though seeking the direction he required. Ralph followed the creature's
movements, understanding with the acuteness of his forest breeding.

Suddenly he started and a half-stifled cry broke from him. He dashed forward to a point where
the snow had drifted and was now disturbed. He halted, and looked down. Other footprints mingled
with those of the bear. They were small, and had been made by moccasin-shod feet. He had seen
such footprints before. He knew the owner of the feet which had made these imprints. Aim-sa's
were such as these--Aim-sa's!

His eyes took in every detail slowly, fondly. Where was she now? He must follow. Then he remembered.
Something else was following, not him, but her. He straightened himself up, and a muttered
exclamation broke from his lips. Now he understood. Away there, back in the distant woods,
the bear must have scented the woman's presence and was tracking her down. She had gone on
through the forest, unknowing of the danger that lurked behind her, which was hard upon her trail.

Forgetful of Nick, forgetful of all else, Ralph pursued the double trail. Danger threatened
the woman he loved, for aught he knew had already overtaken her. To his credit be it said,
that, as he raced over the sodden carpet of the forest, not one selfish thought possessed him.
Aim-sa was in danger, and so he went headlong to the rescue. His quiet eyes were lit with a
fiery determination such as one might have expected in the eyes of Nick, but not in those of
Ralph. His soul was afire with anxiety. Aim-sa was an expert in forest-craft, but she was a
woman. So he hasted.

The world about him might have been bathed in the blackness of night for all he heeded it;
only the track of footsteps stood out to his gaze like a trail of fire. His speed was great;
nor was he conscious how great. He no longer walked, but ran, and thought nothing of distance,
nor the passing of time. The trail of pursuer and pursued still lit, red-hot, before him, and
the cry of his heart still rang out--On! On!

It was noon when his speed slackened. Nor was it weariness that checked him. Once in the echoing
wood he had heard the distant sound of breaking undergrowth. The prospect about him had changed.
The forest had become a tangled maze of low-growing shrub, dotted with giant growths of maple,
spruce, and blue-gum. It was a wider, deeper hollow than any hitherto passed, and the air was
warmer. It was the valley of a wide, swift-flowing river.

The declivity was abrupt, and the rush of the river, too swift to succumb to the grip of winter,
sounded faintly up from below. Suddenly he halted listening, and the sound of breaking undergrowth
came to him again and again; he waited for the cry of the human, but it did not come. With
beating heart he hurried on, his mind was easier and his thoughts centred upon the killing
of the grizzly. His rifle was ready to hand and he looked for a sight of the dark fur through
the bush ahead.

Now his movements became almost Indian-like in their stealth. Bending low to avoid the rustling
branches, he crept on, silently and swiftly. He no longer followed the tracks. He had turned
off, meaning to come up with his quarry against the wind. At every opening in the bush he paused,
his keen eyes alert for a sign of his prey. But the leafless branches of the scrub, faintly
tinged with the signs of coming spring, alone confronted him; only that, and the noise of breaking
brushwood ahead.

It quickly became plain to him that the bear was no longer advancing, but was moving about
uncertainly; and as he realized this, his heart was gripped with a terrible fear. Had the brute
come up with his prey? Had the tragedy been played out? He dashed forward, throwing all caution
to the winds; but ere he had gone fifty yards he came to a halt, like one paralyzed.

His eyes, which had been peering ever ahead, had suddenly dropped to the ground. It seemed
as though they could no longer face that which they looked upon. For a moment his face worked
as might that of a man in great pain. Then its expression changed and a flush mounted to his
brow; a flush of indescribable rage. Again his eyes were raised and a devilish look peered
out from them.

An opening not two acres in extent lay before him. In its midst was a blackened tree-trunk,
limbless, riven; a forest giant blasted by some mountain storm. Nick was standing beside it;
his gun rested against its blackened sides, and, upon a fallen bough, scarcely a yard away,
Aim-sa was seated. They were in deep converse, and Ralph was near enough to hear the sound
of their voices, but not to distinguish their words. As he strained his tingling ears to catch
the tenor of their speech, he could hear the movements of the bear in the adjacent woods.

The two in the open seemed all unconscious of what was going on so near them. Nick was gazing
upon the woman, his heart laid bare in his eyes. And Aim-sa was smiling up into his face with
all the arch coquetry of her sex, with that simple, trusting look which, however guileful,
must ever appeal to the strong man.

For awhile Ralph looked on. The exquisite torture of his heart racked him, but he did not turn
away to shut out the sight. Rather it seemed as if he preferred to thus harass himself. It
was the working of his own angry passion which held him, feeding itself, fostering, nursing
itself, and goading him to fury.

Suddenly the sound of movement close at hand broke the spell which held him. He looked, and
saw the bear less than twenty yards off.

He gripped his rifle, and his first thought was to slay. It was the hunter's instinct which
rose within him. But something held him, and his weapon did not move from his side; somewhere
in his heart a harsh voice whispered to him, and he listened to words of evil counsel. Then
a revulsion of feeling swept over him, and he shook himself as though to get rid of something
which clung about him and oppressed him. But the moment passed, leaving him undecided, his
brain maddened with bitter thoughts.

The dark form in the bush beyond moved. There came no sound, and the waiting man wondered if
his eyes deceived him. No cat could have moved more silently upon its prey. Not a twig creaked.
It moved on stealthily, inexorably, till it paused at the edge of the opening.

Ralph's eyes turned upon the dead tree. Nick's back was turned, and Aim-sa was intent upon
her companion. She seemed to be hanging upon his every word. And Ralph's heart grew harder
within him. His hand held his rifle in a nervous clutch and his finger-nails scored the stock.
A shout from him would avert disaster; a shot would arrest that terrible advance. But the shout
remained unborn; the trigger still waited the compressing hand. And the unconscious brother
stood with death stealing upon him from beyond the fringe of the woods.

Solemnly the great grizzly advanced. Once in the open he made no pause. The lumbering beast
looked so clumsy that the inexperienced might have been forgiven a smile of ridicule. Its ears
twitched backward and forward, its head lolled to its gait, and though its eyes shone with
a baleful ferocity they seemed to gaze anywhere but at its intended victims.

Ralph stood watching, with lips compressed and jaws set, and a cruel frown darkening his brow.
But his heart was beating in mighty pulsations, and somewhere within him a conflict was raging,
in which Evil had attacked in overwhelming force, and Good was being beaten back.

Within ten yards of the tree the bear halted and reared itself upon its haunches. Thus for
a moment it towered in terrible menace.

It was the last chance. Ralph's lips moved as though to shout, but only a low muttered curse
came from them. Suddenly the air was split with a piercing scream. Aim-sa stood erect, one
arm was outstretched pointing, the other rested against the tree as though she would steady
herself. Her eyes were staring in terror at the huge brute as it came towards them.

Nick swung round. He was too late. There was no time to reach his rifle. His right hand plunged
at his belt, and he drew a long hunting-knife from its sheath, and thrust himself, a shield,
before Aim-sa.

The cry smote the savage heart of Ralph, smote it with the sear of white-hot iron. A wave of
horror passed over him. It was not of his brother he thought, but of the woman he loved. Nick's
death would only be the forerunner of hers. In a flash his rifle sprang to his shoulder. A
second passed while his keen eyes ran over the sights, the compressing hand was upon the trigger.
A puff of smoke. A sharp report. The grizzly swung round with a lurch. He had not stopped,
he merely changed the direction of his steps and came straight for the forest where Ralph stood.

But the magnificent brute only took a few strides. Ralph went out to meet him, but, ere he
came up, the creature tottered. Then, reeling, it dropped upon all fours, only, the next instant,
to roll over upon its side, dead.

Ralph gave one glance at the body of the great bear; the next moment its presence was forgotten.
He passed on, and confronted those whom he had unwillingly rescued. The depression of his brows,
and the glint of his eyes and merciless set of his jaws, all gave warning of a danger that
dwarfed to insignificance that which had just passed.

"I 'lows I hadn't reckoned to find you wi' company," Ralph said, addressing his brother with
a quietness that ill-concealed the storm underlying his words. "Mebbe I didn't calc'late to
find you, anyway."

There was no mistaking the challenge in his look. Nick saw it. His impetuous temper rose in
response. The bear was forgotten. Neither alluded to it. The two men faced each other with
the concentrated jealous hatred of weeks' growth uppermost in their hearts.

"Wal, I guess y've found me. What then?"

Nick squared himself, and his expression was as relentless as that of the older man.

Ralph paid no heed to the taunting inquiry. He looked over at Aim-sa, who had shrunk away.
Now she answered his look with one that was half-pleading, half-amused. She realized the feud
which was between the men, but she did not understand the rugged, forceful natures which she
had so stirred.

"Say, gal," Ralph said abruptly. "Ther's jest us two. Ye gave yourself to me that night, maybe
you've give yourself to him since. Which is it, him or me? Ye'll choose right here. Choose!"

Nick turned and looked at her with strained, anxious eyes. Ralph's face belied his outward calm.

"An' what if Aim-sa loves neither?" the woman asked, with a laugh in which there was no mirth,
and some fear.

"Then she's lied."

Ralph's teeth shut with a snap.

Aim-sa looked from one to the other. She was beginning to understand, and with understanding
came a great dread. She longed to flee, but knew that to do so would be impossible.

"Aim-sa loves both," she said at last.

There was a long, deathly silence. The brooding solitude of the wild was never more pronounced
than at that moment.

Then Ralph looked into the face of his brother, and Nick returned his gaze.

"You hear?" said Ralph. "She is an Injun, I guess, an' don't know no better. Maybe we'd best
settle it for her."

"That's so."

Ralph threw off his buckskin shirt. Nick removed his heavy clothing.

"Stand aside, woman," said Ralph. "Ye'll wait by, an' your man'll claim ye."

"Knives?" said Nick, through his clenched teeth.

"Knives."

And then again silence reigned.

CHAPTER X.

THE BATTLE IN THE WILD

The woman shrank back. The last trace of levity had vanished from her eyes. Their blue depths
gazed out upon the strange scene with horror and dread. In that moment she understood the power
she had wielded with these two men, and a thrill of regret shook her frame. She saw in the
eyes of both the cruel purpose which was in their hearts. It was death for one of them. Even
in that moment of suspense, she found herself speculating which of them it would be.

There was no sentiment in her thoughts. These two were nothing to her. She would regret the
death of either as she would regret the death of any strong, healthy man; but that was all.
Her horror was a natural revulsion at the prospect of seeing death dealt out in the ruthless
manner that these men contemplated.

Just for one instant the desire to stay the combatants rose uppermost in her mind. She stepped
forward again and raised a protesting hand.

"Are you brothers or wolves of the forest that you'd kill each other? If you fight for Aim-sa,
she'll have neither of you."

Her words rang out clear and incisive. In her excitement she had forgotten the halting phrases
of the White Squaw, and spoke fluently enough. Nick was ominously silent. Ralph answered her.

"Stand back, an' remember ye're the squaw of him as wins ye in fair fight."

Then he cried out to his brother:

"Are ye ready?"

Nick made no audible reply. His face looked the words his lips did not frame. He was ready,
and the passion in him was more than willing. Once, before he closed with his opponent, he
glanced round at Aim-sa. It may have been that he sought one look of encouragement, one smile;
it may have been. But the beautiful face he looked upon had no smile for either. It was dead
white under its tanning, and the blue eyes were widely staring. Ralph did not take his eyes
from his brother's face, and the fierce light in them was as the gleam in the eyes of the timber-wolf
prowling at night around a camp-fire in the forest.

For a moment a heavy cloud spread itself over the face of the sun, and the grey daylight of
winter again covered the mountains. Instantly the forest lost its look of spring, and the air
returned to the chill of the darker months. The bald break in the forest looked more cheerless
than a waste ground in a city, and those who stood about to fight for life became savage images
that looked something less than human. Nick, larger than his brother, was a tower of thew and
muscle. As he stood there, clad in a cotton shirt and trousers belted at the waist, he was
the figure of a perfect man. His shaggy head was thrown back, but his handsome face was distorted
by its expression of hate. Ralph was the smaller by inches, but his muscles were as fine-tempered
steel. There was even more of the wild in his expression than in that of his brother. The ferocity
in his face was wolfish, and not good to look upon.

Both had bared their hunting-blades, long knives at once vicious and coldly significant.

There was no further word. The men bent low and moved circling round each other. Their attitudes
were much those of wrestlers seeking an advantageous "holt." By common consent they avoided
the tree, keeping to the oozing soil of the open.

Ralph displayed the more activity. His lesser stature inclined to a quickness his brother did
not possess. He sought to use art to draw the impetuosity of the other, and kept up a series
of feints. But strangely enough Nick displayed a control which was surprising. He had a full
appreciation of the life and death struggle. He had faced it too often with the dumb adversaries
of the forest. It was Ralph who became incautious. His fury could not long be held in check,
and his cunning at the start of the fight soon gave place to a wild and slashing onslaught,
while Nick fought on the defensive, reading in his brother's eyes the warning of every contemplated
attack.

But Ralph's swift movements harassed Nick; they pressed him sorely, and often drove him to
extremity in his defence. For long he kept distance, knowing that while the other was wasting
strength his own was being carefully husbanded.

Ten minutes passed. Still they had not come together. Ralph charged in with upraised knife;
the blow was warded, and he passed on only to swing round on the instant and repeat the attack
from the opposite direction. But always Nick faced him, grim, determined, and with deadly purpose.
Once the latter slipped; the footing was none too secure. Instantly Ralph hurled himself upon
him and his blade scored his brother's arm, leaving a trail of blood from elbow to wrist. That
one touch let loose Nick's pent-up fury and he allowed himself to be drawn.

The two came together with a terrific impact. Nick slipped again. This time he could not save
himself. His feet shot from under him and he went down backwards. In his fall he seized Ralph's
knife-arm at the wrist, and the same time aimed a slashing blow at his face. But Ralph's agility
was as furious as it was full of force. In turn he caught Nick by the wrist, and, with a great
wrench, sought to dislocate his shoulder.

As well try to tear a limb from the parent oak. Ralph's effort died out, and they lay upon
the ground fighting to free their weapons. Now the life and death struggle had begun. It was
a hideous battle, silent, ominous. But the horror of it lay, not in the deadly intent, the
flashing steel, the grim silence. These men were brothers; brothers whose affection had stood
them through years of solitary labours, trials, and privations, but which had changed to a
monstrous hatred because a woman had come into their lives.

As the moments swept by, the brothers rolled and writhed, with every faculty at terrible tension.
Now Ralph was uppermost; now Nick sought to drive the downward blow. Now Ralph strained to
twist his knife-arm free from the iron grip that held it; now Nick slashed vainly at the air,
seeking to sever the sinewy limb that threatened above his face.

It required only the smallest slip, the briefest relaxation of the tense-drawn muscles on the
part of either, and death awaited the unfortunate. For long neither yielded one iota, but the
struggle was too fierce to last. Human strength has but narrow limits of endurance when put
forth to its uttermost. Given no slip, no accident, there could be only one conclusion to the
battle. Victory must inevitably be with the man of superior muscle. Neither fought with a fine
skill; for, used as they both were to the knife, their antagonists of the forest only possessed
Nature's weapons, which left the hunter with the balance of power.

Already the breathing of the combatants had become painfully heavy; but while Ralph struggled
with all the fierceness of his passion, and put forth his whole strength, Nick reserved a latent
force for the moment when opportunity arrived. And that moment was nearing.

Ralph was under and Nick's great weight held him down, for the sinuous struggles of the other
had lost their vim. Suddenly, with a mighty effort, the younger man wrenched his knife-arm
free, and a cry, hoarse, fierce, sounded deep in his throat. But his effort had cost him his
hold upon his brother. There was a wicked gleam of steel as both men struck.

Ralph, striking upwards, was at a disadvantage. His blade, aimed at the neck and shoulder,
struck Nick's cheek, laid the flesh open to the lower jaw, glanced, and buried itself in the
muscle of the shoulder. Nick's blade smote with a fearful gash into the side of his brother's
throat.

It was over.

Ralph lay quivering and silent upon the ground. Nick rose staggering and dazed.

He moved away like a man in a dream. His arms hung limply at his sides, and his eyes looked
out across the wide woodland valley with an uncomprehending stare. His face was almost unrecognizable
under the flow of blood from his wound. Once, as he stood, one hand went up mechanically to
his face, then it dropped again without having accomplished its purpose. And all the while
his vacant eyes stared out upon--nothing.

Presently he sat down. His actions were almost like collapse, and he remained where he sat,
still, silent, like an image. The moments passed. The quiet was intense. A faint murmur of
flowing waters came up from the river beyond.

Suddenly he moved. Then in a moment he seemed to break out into passionate life. The stony
stare had gone from his eyes. Intelligence looked out; intelligence such as one might find
in one whose mind is on the verge of losing its balance; a fearful, anxious, hunted intelligence,
face to face with an unending horror.

He moved to where his brother was lying, and stood shaking in every limb; he had realized the
work of his hands. He dashed the blood from his face. The vivid stain dyed his fingers and
the touch of the warm tide only seemed to add to his terror. He went up to the still form and
looked down. Then he backed away, slowly, step by step, but still unable to withdraw his fascinated
gaze.

Suddenly a cry broke from his lips. It was bitter, heartrending. Then a quick word followed.

"Wher's--"

His question remained uncompleted. His head turned swiftly, and he looked stupidly about him.
The clearing was empty of all save himself and that other lying upon the ground at his feet,
and, beyond, the carcass of the dead grizzly. A dreadful fear leapt to his brain; he moved
tottering. His action gained swiftness suddenly. He ran to the forest edge, and, with hungry
eyes, gazed in beyond the sparse fringe of scrub. There was nothing there. He moved away to
the right and ran in amongst the low-growing bush, only to reappear with more feverish haste,
and eyes whose fiery glance seemed to shoot in every direction at once. On he went, round the
edge of the entire clearing; in and out, like some madman running purposelessly in search of
some phantasy of his brain. There was no one there but himself, and the two still forms upon
the ground. Aim-sa was gone!

But he did not pause. His brain was in a tumult, there was no reasoning in it. He searched
everywhere. Bush that could conceal nothing bigger than a beetle was examined; to his distorted
fancy the lightning-stricken tree presented a hiding-place. Further he penetrated into the
woods, but always only to return to his brother's side, distraught, weary from loss of blood.

Gone! Aim-sa was gone!

At last he stood, an awesome figure, bloodstained, dishevelled. He was at his brother's side
as he had been a dozen times during his mad search. It was as though he returned to the dead
for company. But now, at last, he moved away no more. He looked upon the pallid face and staring,
sightless eyes, and the red pool in which the body weltered.

There was a long pause, and the quiet set his pulses beating and his ears drumming. Presently
he turned away. But as by a magnet drawn, he turned quickly again and his eyes once more rested
upon his brother's body. Then all in a moment a stifled cry broke from his lips, and, throwing
himself upon his knees, he thrust his arms about the dead.

Suffering as he was, he raised the body and nursed the almost severed head. He muttered hoarsely,
and his face was bent low till his own dripping wound shed its sluggish tide to mingle with
the blood of the man he had slain.

Now, in his paroxysm of awful remorse, the woman was forgotten, and he only realized the dread
horror he had committed. He had slain his brother! He was a murderer! For what?

At the thought he almost threw the body from him as he sprang to his feet.

"No, no! not murder," he cried, in a choking voice. "It was fair fight."

Then, still looking down, he drew his foot back as though to kick the stiffening clay. But
the blow did not come, and, instead, he wrung his hands at his sides like a child in distress.
Harsh sobs broke tearless from his lips; his breast heaved with inexpressible agony. Then he
flung himself face downwards upon the sodden earth, and his fingers dug into the carpet of
dead matter, clawing aimlessly.

The afternoon was well advanced when he moved again. He rose to his feet without any warning,
and the change in him was staggering. Now a gaunt, grey-faced man looked out upon the world
through eyes which burned with the light of fever. His movements were slow, deliberate. Only
his eyes betrayed his condition, telling a tale of a strange new life born within him.

He moved off into the woods, striking down the slope towards the river. He was gone some time;
and when he returned his face was cleaned, and a bandage was tied about it. The wound in his
shoulder was not severe.

He came none too soon, for, as he neared the clearing, he heard a succession of deep-toned
wolf-howls. As he broke the forest fringe, he saw two great timber-wolves steal swiftly back
to the depths whence they had just emerged.

Nick cursed them under his breath. Then he went to his brother's side. Here he paused, and,
after a moment of mental struggle, stooped and lifted the corpse upon his unwounded shoulder.
Then with his gruesome freight he plunged into the forest.

He held the body firmly but tenderly, and walked as rapidly as his burden permitted. He often
talked to himself as he went, like a man in deep thought and stirred by violent emotions. Sometimes
he slowed his gait, and, at others, he almost ran. His thoughts influenced him strangely.

Once he set his burden down and rested. The forest was getting dark about him, but it suited
his mood; it formed a background for his gloomy thoughts. And, while he rested, he fell to
talking as though Ralph were living, and merely rested with him. He talked and answered himself,
and, later, leaned over his dead, crooning like some woman over her child. The time passed.
Again he rose, and once more shouldering the body, now stiff and cold, hastened on.

And as the evening shadows gathered, and the forest gloom deepened, there came the sound of
movement about him. At intervals wolfish throats were opened and the dismal forest cries echoed
and reëchoed in the hollow shadows.

His burden grew heavier. His mind suffered, and his nerves were tense as the wires of a musical
instrument. Every jolt found an echoing note upon them, and each note so struck caused him
exquisite pain. And now, too, the wolves grew bolder; the scent of blood was in the air and
taunted their hungry bellies till they began to lose their fear of the man.

Nick stopped and looked about him. The evening shadows were fast closing in. In the gloom he
saw eyes looking out upon him, eyes in pairs, like coals of fire surrounded by dark, lank,
shadowy forms. One shadow stood out more distinctly than the others, and he unslung his rifle
and fired pointblank at it. There was a howl of pain. Then followed several fierce yelps, and
stealing forms crowded thick and fast upon the creature that had bitten the dust.

With a thrill of strange dread Nick shouldered his burden again and proceeded on his way. His
steps were no longer steady, but hurried and uncertain. In his haste he frequently stumbled,
but he was strong, and he had a haunting fear of what lay behind him, and so he put forth a
great effort.

The twilight deepened; black shadows were everywhere about him. Hills rose before him, and
valleys sank away at his feet. His fancy now saw the forest crowded with prying eyes. Every
tree-trunk became a figure which stood pointing and whispering words of denunciation. And as
he beheld this ghostly army of shadows his heart quailed, and the look in his eyes grew more
and more fevered. He lurched on under the cold, clammy body without thought of his way, with
nervous dews upon his forehead, and shaking limbs.

The wolves still followed. Their cries, vicious, eager, came to him, and he knew that the meal
he had provided was devoured, and they hungered yet, and thirsted for the blood they scented
upon the air. He sped on, staggering, and his mind grew dizzy. But he knew that he had entered
his valley, and beyond lay the dugout which henceforth was his alone.

His intolerable burden had worn him down. He feared it as he feared the dark shadows of the
woods, and the stealing forms which trailed behind him. He longed to throw that which he carried
to the ground and run headlong to the shelter of his home. But something held him. It was as
if his brother's corpse were endowed with life, a ghostly life, and that it clung with tenacious
grip to the back of the living. And the thought grew in his aching brain that he was no longer
free to do as he chose, but was being driven by the Thing he carried. At the river he bent
to rid himself of the corpse. He purposed to rest ere he bore it up the last hill, but the
stiff arms had somehow embraced his neck and clung to him. With a cry of terror he moved forward
at a run. Hard on his heels came the loud-voiced throng of timber-wolves.

At last, ahead, he heard the yelping of his own dogs. The noise brought him a measure of relief,
for the speeding shadows behind dropped back into the woods, and their voices faded away into
the distance.

But the corpse clung, and its weight dragged him back; to his distorted fancy the arms held
his neck as in a vise. He gasped painfully as imagination told him that he was being choked.
A cold sweat poured down his face and set him shivering, but, like one doomed to his task,
he sped on.

Now the open stretched before him and beyond lay the dugout. He saw his dogs rushing to meet
him; his five fierce huskies. They came welcoming; then they paused uncertainly and grouped
together in a cluster, and their tone suddenly changed to the short-voiced yapping of fear.
As he came on he called them by name, seeking solace in their company and in the sound of his
own voice. But the only response the dogs made was to move uneasily. Their bushy tails drooped
and hung between their legs and they turned back fearfully. Then they began to creep away,
slinking in furtive apprehension; then finally they broke into a headlong flight, racing for
home in a perfect madness of terror.

And so, with horror staring from his eyes, the man who had killed his brother came to his home
again.

Inside the hut he released himself from the icy embrace of the dead man's arms, and laid the
poor, cold clay upon the blankets which had been spread for the return of Aim-sa. While he
stood brooding over the corpse a sound reached him from, behind. Turning he saw that he had
left the door open, and in the opening he beheld the crowding forms of his dogs. They stood
snarling fiercely, with bristling manes, their narrow-set eyes gleaming in the dusk like sparks
of baleful light.

The sight set him shuddering. Then something seemed to stir within him. His heart felt like
stone in his body. A coldness seemed to freeze his blood one minute, and the next in a rush
came a wave of fiery passion which drove him to unthinking action. The veins in his head seemed
to be bursting, and his brain felt as though gripped in a vise.

Out whipped his revolver, and six chambers were emptied at the figures which barred the doorway.
A hubbub of howls followed, then, in a moment, all became quiet. Now the doorway stood clear;
the creatures had vanished--all but two. And these lay where they had fallen.

Suddenly a harsh laugh broke the stillness. But though the laugh was his, Nick's lips were
unsmiling and his eyes gleamed furiously out into the night.

CHAPTER XI.

THE GATHERING OF THE FOREST LEGIONS

Nick kicked the bodies of the two dogs from the doorway. Then, by force of habit, he kindled
a fire in the stove, though he had no thought or desire for warmth. His action was mechanical
and unheeding. Then he sat down; and, as he sat, he heard the howling of the dogs as, in chorus,
they mourned their dead companions.

As the noise continued the man's nerves vibrated with the hideous dole. It rose and fell, in
mournful cadence, until he could stand it no longer. So he rose and reloaded his revolver.
The action brought him relief. It did more: it brought him a feeling akin to joy. And he passed
out into the night.

Forceful action alone could serve him. His dread, the torture of heart and brain, found relief
in the thought of taking life. A lust for slaughter was upon him.

He closed the door behind him, and, from the storm porch, peered out beyond. The moon had just
risen above the ghostly mountain peak, and its deep, yellow light shone down over the gleaming
crests in long shafts of dull fire. Twenty yards away, the three huskies were squatting upon
the ground facing each other, as might their blood relations, the timber-wolves. Their long,
sharp muzzles were thrown up towards the starlit heavens, and their voices trolled drearily
from their cavernous throats, thrilling the air and arousing the mountain echoes.

For a second there was a gleam of light in the darkness of the porch as the moon's rays caught
the burnished metal of the man's revolver. Then three shots rang sharply out. Three hideous
voices were instantly hushed; three bodies rolled over, falling almost side by side. The labour
of the trace would know the huskies no more.

But the man's passion was only rising. He reentered the hut, thrilled with a strange wild joy.
A fierceness leapt within him as he seated himself beside the stove and gazed over at the still
form of his brother. And up out of the forest came the yelp of famished wolf and starving coyote.

The hunched figure made no move.

Wild thoughts surged through his brain, thoughts which had no sequence, no continuity. He had
not eaten the whole day, and though food was now to his hand he heeded it not. He was exhausted
and utterly weary of body. But he sought no rest. He was living upon the vitality of his poor
strained brain, sapping the tide of reason which flowed none too surely.

The time passed.

The cries of the wolves gathered force and drew nearer. The scent of blood was in the air.
That night they were very bold. With muzzles thrown up they snuffed at the scent they loved,
and came with licking lips and frothing jowls, fighting fiercely among themselves.

Nick stirred at last.

He rose and took his rifle. His cartridge-belt was still about his waist. Again he passed out
into the night. In the shadow of the porch he stood again, and gazed upon the moonlit scene.
Down the hill was the darkness of the forest, giving the appearance of an unfathomable pit.
Above rose its sides, shimmering in the cold moonlight. Above the forest line the eternal snows
glinted like burnished steel, for the yellow rays of the rising moon had given place to the
silvery gleam of its maturity. The diamond-studded sky had nothing of darkness in it; a grey
light, the sheen of the star myriads too minute to be visible to the naked eye, shone down
upon the earth, and the still air had the sharp snap of the spring frost in it. Nick was oblivious
to all but the forest cries and the crowd of stealing forms moving from the woodland shelter,
and circling upward, ever nearer and nearer towards the feast which lay spread out within sight
of their cruel eyes.

Nearer they drew, lean, scraggy, but withal large beasts. And as they came they often paused
to send their dismal song out upon the air. Then there was a scuffle, a wicked clipping of
keen fangs. Instantly the crowd packed about a fallen comrade. Then later they would scatter
and continue their advance in a sort of rude skirmishing order. The man's rifle was at his
shoulder; a tongue of flame leapt from its muzzle, and its report rang out bitingly. The foremost
wolf fell to the earth, and the ravenous horde behind leapt to the banquet thus provided.

Again and again the rifle spoke its sharp-voiced command, and death followed hard upon its
word. At every shot a wolf went down, and the madness rose in the brain behind the eyes that
looked out from the porch. Nick's craving for slaughter increased. He emptied his belt and
obtained a fresh supply of ammunition, and continued to wage his fiendish warfare. And all
the time wolves poured out from the woods until it seemed as if the whole race had gathered
in one vast army to assail the little stronghold set high upon the hillside. It was as though
Ralph's death had been the signal for the gathering of the forest creatures to avenge him.

And fierce and long the carnage continued. The fearsome pastime was one to thrill the most
hardened with horror. The still night air was filled with a nauseating reek, whilst the echoes
gave back the death-cries, mingling with the deep-toned bayings of ferocious joy. But never
for one instant did the man relax his watchfulness. Never once did his rifle cease its biting
greeting to the relentless scavengers of the forest. Short and sharp its words leapt forth,
and every word meant death.

The moon passed its meridian and sank lower and lower towards the western peaks; and as it
lost power the stars shone more brilliantly and the northern lights hovered in the sky, dancing
their fantastic measure slowly, solemnly. The tint of dawn stole gradually above the eastern
horizon. The man was still at his post, his unsleeping eyes ever watchful. Longer intervals
now elapsed between his deadly shots. The wolves recognized the coming of daylight, and became
more chary of breaking cover. Besides, the banquet was nearly over and every guest was gorged.

Dawn grew apace. The silver of the eastern sky changed to gold, deeper and deeper, till the
yellow merged into a roseate sheen which shone down upon the cloud mists, and tinged them with
the hue of blood. Light was over the darkling forests, and as it brightened the voice of the
forest legions died away in the distance, and the battleground was deserted of all but the
author of the fearful carnage.

Nick waited in his shelter until the last cry had passed. Then he reluctantly turned back into
the hut. He sought no rest. His fevered brain was in a tumult. For a long time he stood beside
his brother's corpse, while his mind struggled to regain something of its lost balance. There
came to him a hazy recollection of all that had gone before. It was as though he stood viewing
the past from some incalculable distance. Events passed phantasmagorically before his memory,
yet always their meaning seemed to tantalize and elude him.

And while he stood thus the woman leapt into the foreground of his mental picture. It was the
tangible feature he needed upon which he could link the chain of recollection. Now everything
became more clear. Now the meaning of his brother's dead body returned to him once more. He
remembered all that had happened. His love for Aim-sa arose paramount out of the shadowed recesses
of his deranged mind, and merged into that other passion which had gripped him the night long.

Nor was there pity nor penitence in his mood. Remorse had passed from him. Now there was no
one to stand between him and his love. He was glad that Ralph was dead. Therefore the will and
the intellect are one and the same.

False Doctrines about Error Exposed

I have thus removed what is commonly thought to be the cause of error. It has been proved above
that falsity consists solely in the privation which mutilated and
confused ideas involve.

A false idea, therefore, in so far as it is false, does not involve certitude. Consequently, when
we say that a man assents to what is false and does not doubt it,
we do not say that he is certain, but merely that he does not doubt,
that is to say, that he assents to what is false, because there are
no causes sufficient to make his imagination waver. Although, therefore,
a man may be supposed to adhere to what is false, we shall never on
that account say that he is certain.

Again he passed a hand across his forehead, and his action was uncertain, as of a man who finds
it difficult to think, and having thought fails to obtain reassurance. He passed out of the
hut, and presently returned with a shovel and pick.

Now the hut resounded with the dull thud of the pick as it was driven deep into the hard-trodden
earth. There was a feverish haste and unnecessary energy in the manner of his work. At first
what he intended was not quite clear. He seemed to be digging at random. Then he laid his pick
aside and plied the shovel, and gradually his purpose became plain. A long, narrow trench was
cleared, and its outline was that of a grave. Again the pick was set to work, and again the
shovel cleared the débris. The ground was hard with the years of tramping it had endured, and
it took a long time to dig to a sufficient depth. But at last the grave was completed.

Nick seized the body in its blanket shroud and flung it into the hole. There was neither pause
nor hesitancy in anything he did, only his eyes peered furtively about. As the first part of
the burial was accomplished, a panic seized him and he shovelled the soil back as though his
life depended on his speed. He packed the dry clay down with his feet; nor did he rest till
the grave was filled to the top.

Then he paused and wiped the sweat from his brow. The tension of his nerves was slightly relaxed.
He went outside the hut to drink in a deep breath of the purer mountain air before he proceeded
further. And while he stood leaning against the doorway he listened as though expecting the
sound of some one approaching. He scanned the outlook carefully, but there was no sign of living
creature about. The wolves had gone as surely as if their visit had been a ghostly hallucination
which daylight had dispelled.

He returned to his labours with his spirit more easy and his brain less fevered. He thought
of Aim-sa and that which he meant to bestow upon her.

Near by where he had buried his brother's body was the spot where the treasure had been placed
for safety. Here he began to dig. The work was easy. The soil was light and loose, and gave
beneath the sharp edge of the shovel. He cleared several shovelfuls out, and then stooped to
rake for the chest with his fingers. He knew that it had been buried only a few inches below
the surface. He raked long and diligently, but, wherever he tried it, the earth gave beneath
the pressure of his strong fingers, nor yielded up any indication of the chest. He rose and
resorted once more to the shovel, and a look of disquiet stole into his face. He opened a wider
surface, thinking he had missed the spot. He dug deeper, but no chest appeared, and his look
changed to one of absolute fear.

Again he raked, but without result. Again he dug, but now deeper and deeper. Still there was
no chest, and as he widened the hole he found himself working upon the hard soil which had
never before been disturbed. An awful fear gripped him. He sought out the spot where the soil
was easy. He knew that this was where he had buried the chest. His actions became hurried and
more and more energetic. He dug furiously, scattering the earth wildly in his alarm, and all
the time conviction was forcing itself upon him, and he muttered as he worked.

But all his efforts were in vain, and, after an hour's fruitless search, he flung down the
shovel with a bitter cry. Then he stood gazing blankly before him with eyes that seemed to
scorch in his head. His face twitched, and his hands clenched and unclenched at his sides.
Then his lips parted and he gasped rather than spoke.

"It's gone!"

The veins at his temples beat visibly. In his ears was a sound as of rushing waters. He saw
nothing. He scarcely knew where he was, only he was conscious of something in his head which
was strained to the verge of breaking. When, at last, movement came to him, every nerve in
his body seemed to draw up with a jolt, and a cry, like the roar of a maddened bull, burst
from his quivering lips. He rushed headlong from the hut.

Out into the glittering daylight he went, heedless of his course, heedless of his surroundings.
He rushed down the hill and plunged into the woods. On he went, without pause, without hesitation,
blindly, madly. On, on, running, stumbling, slipping upon the sodden earth, tripping over projecting
roots and rotting stumps.

His mind was a blank. He saw, but comprehended not; he felt, but the sense had no meaning.
He heard with clarion-like distinctness, but that which he heard sang upon his ear-drums and
penetrated no further. His way was the way of the blindfold, his staring eyes beheld nothing
real; he saw the name of Aim-sa blazing in letters of fire before him, and a hazy picture of
her lovely face. All recollection of his loss had suddenly passed from him, utterly blotted
out of his thought as though he had never known it. He knew not that he had ever had a brother
whose death had been the work of his own hand. The hut behind him might never have existed,
the forest about him might have been the open prairie, the sodden ground a carpet of fine texture,
the snow-covered clearings dusty plains; he knew nothing, nothing. He moved, ran, walked; he
was a living organism without a governing power of mind.

Noon came. The silent forest looked down upon his frenzied progress. The trees nodded gently
in the breeze, whispering solemnly to each other in their pitying tones. Owls watched him with
staring, unmeaning eyes; deer fled as he came rushing into the calm of their sylvan retreats.
A grizzly stood erect as he passed, meditating a protest at the strange disturbance, but remained
staring in amazement as the wild human figure went by, oblivious and unheeding.

The afternoon saw him still struggling, but now wearily, and in a state of collapse. His headlong
course had taken the inevitable turn. He had swung round in a great circle, and was heading
again for the hillside where the dugout stood. Now he often fell as he went, for his feet lagged
and caught in every unevenness of the ground. Once he lay where he fell, and remained so long
motionless that it seemed as if he would rise no more. But as the afternoon waned and the evening
shadows gathered, there came the wild cries of the wolves from somewhere close behind. Though
he felt no fear of them, he staggered to his feet and dragged wearily on towards the hut. It
was the forest instinct obeyed mechanically.

He came to the hut; he passed the door. Again it was habit that guided him. He kept on, and
went round to the door of the lean-to. It stood wide open and he plunged within, and fell headlong
upon his blankets. Nor did he stir again; only there came the sound of his stertorous breathing
to indicate that he slept.

Black night closed down. The forest cries awoke and their chorus rang out as the moon mounted
in the heavens. The wolfish legions hovered at the edge of the woods and snuffed hungrily at
the air. But the scent of blood had passed, and they came not too near.

Nick's slumber of exhaustion was haunted by painful, incoherent dreams. With the curious freakishness
of a disordered mind, he was beset by a vision of the dark, ferret face of Victor Gagnon. The
trader seemed to be hovering threateningly over his rude couch, and, behind him, less distinct,
but always recognizable, was the fair Aim-sa. The whole night the sleeper was depressed by
some dreadful threat which centred about the vision of these two, and when at length he awoke
it was with the effect of his dreams hard upon him.

The fair fresh daylight was streaming in through the open door. Nick roused himself. He turned
uneasily, shivering with the cold, for he had slept where he had fallen. Suddenly he sat up.
Then with a leap he was on his feet and wide-awake, and the name of Victor Gagnon fell from
his lips. A frenzied, unreasoning desire to take the trader's life possessed him.

His body was refreshed and the blank of memory had passed from him. A gleam of reason shot
athwart the racked brain. It was only for an instant, then it was gone again. But that instant
sufficed. He remembered that Gagnon knew of the treasure, the only person except himself who
knew of it. Victor had robbed him. A wild laughter shook him. Ay, that was it. Victor was the
thief; he should die. After that--Aim-sa.

His untutored brain had broken under the strain of recent events. Horror had driven him to
the verge of the abyss in the depths of which lurked insanity; his final loss had plunged him
headlong down. He was mad!

CHAPTER XII.

WHERE THE LAWS OF MIGHT ALONE PREVAIL

Two men occupied the back room of Victor Gagnon's store. The proprietor, small, alert, with
eye and brain working swiftly, and an expression on his dark face indicating the angry nature
of his thoughts. He was sitting with his feet on the stove rail and his hands spread out to
the warmth. The other man was beside the parchment-covered window. He was immensely tall, and
was clad in grey wolfskin from head to foot. His broad shoulders were broadened by the fur
covering till he looked a giant. He had just thrown back a cavernous hood from his head, and
it now hung down his back. His fur cap was removed, thus displaying a coarse mane of long black
hair, and a face as sombre and strong as the world to which he belonged.

The room was untidy. The bed stood at one end, and the tumbled blankets upon it looked as though
they had not been straightened for weeks. A small table supported the remains of a frugal meal
and the floor about it was littered with food and crumbs. Everywhere were signs of half-breed
slovenliness.

For some moments silence had reigned. The North, that Land of Silence, makes men sparing of
words, and even women only talk when it is necessary. Just now, there was that between these
two men which held every thought to the main issue.

Victor's attention was for the moment upon a rough-hewn chest which was standing on the floor
at the big man's feet.

"An' why didn't she come right along with you?"

"Mebbe cos she's smarter nor any o' us; mebbe cos I jest didn't want her to. There's somethin'
'tween you an' me, Victor, that needs some parley."

The big man spoke quite calmly, but his very calmness was portentous.

"Smarter?" said Victor contemptuously, ignoring the latter part of the other's remark.

"That's what I said," went on the giant, in dispassionate tones. "Davia reckoned as it wa'n't
jest safe to light right out lest them fellers found they'd been robbed o' their wad. She's
stayin' around to put 'em off'n the trail. They're dead sweet on her an' ain't likely to 'spect
who's got the stuff while she's around."

Victor nodded approvingly. His face was less angry. He knew Davia would serve him well. A silence
fell again. The stove roared under the forced draught of the damper. Then the big man spoke
as though he had not broken off.

"But that ain't on'y the reason, I guess. I wanted her to stay. You an' me are goin' to talk,
Victor Gagnon."

The trader glanced angrily at the man with the hood.

"See here, Jean Leblaude, you allus had a crank in yer head, an' I don't cotton to cranks anyhow."

"But you'll cotton to this," replied Jean drily.

"Eh?"

"It's nigh on to three year since you an' sister Davi' took on together," he went on, ignoring
the interruption, and speaking with great feeling. "Guess you said as you'd marry her when
you was independent o' the company. It was allus the company. Didn't want no married traders
on their books. An' you hadn't no cash pappy. That's how you sed. Mebbe it's different now.
Wal? When are you goin' to make her a de--your wife?"

There was a look in Jean's eyes that brooked no denial or evasion. He had driven straight to
the point, nor was there any likelihood of his drawing back.

"You're pretty rough," said Victor, with an unpleasant laugh. He was inwardly raging, but,
like all men of no great moral strength, feared the direct challenge of the other.

"We ain't polished folk hereabouts," retorted Jean. "We've played the dirty game o' the White
Squaw for you' clear out. Davi's most as dead sick of it as me, but wher' she went into it
fer a frolic an' to please you, I had my notions, I guess. I come clear away down from Peace
River nigh on two summers ago jest fer to see that you acted squar' by that misguided girl.
An' that's why I done all your dirty work in this White Squaw racket. Now we've got the boodle
you're goin' to hitch up wi' Davi', or--"

"Or--what?" broke in Victor contemptuously.

"Or not one blazin' cent o' the stuff in this chest'll you touch."

Victor sprang from his seat and his eyes shone furiously.

"You--you--" But his fury was baffled by the solemn, determined stare of the other. A moment
more and he dropped back in his seat.

Then the great Jean lowered his eyes to the hewn chest upon the floor. The lid had been forced
open and the bags of gold dust, so carefully arranged by the Westleys, were displayed within.
Presently he looked back at the angry figure bending towards the stove.

"Guess I'll git blankets out o' your store," he said.

Victor remained rapt in moody silence.

"Ther' ain't room fer two to sleep comfort'ble in that bed o' yourn," he added significantly,
as the other showed no inclination to speak.

At last Victor looked up and the dark half-breed blood slowly mounted and flushed his narrow face.

"You're goin' to stop here--wher' the stuff is?"

"I guess."

The trader looked long into the cavernous moose-eyes of the Hooded Man while he choked down
the rage which consumed him. He knew that he was a prisoner in his own store. Resistance would
be utterly useless against such a man as Jean Leblaude.

In his scheme for obtaining wealth Victor had omitted to take into consideration one of the
great factors of a life of wrong-doing. A man may not engage in crime with those whom he has
wronged.

Victor had sought to obtain good service, forgetting the manner in which he had treated the
sister of Jean. The ways of the half-breed are loose in the matter of morals. Davia, he knew,
loved him. She was a strong, passionate woman, therefore he had not bothered about Jean. That
Jean could possibly have scruples or feelings, had never entered his head. Davia had given
her love, then what business of her brother's was the manner in which he, Victor, chose to
accept it? This is how he argued when he fully realized the position in which he had thrust
himself. But his argument went no further.

Jean was a man strong and purposeful. He had waited long for such an opportunity, and he was
not the one to forego his advantage without enforcing his will. If Victor wanted his share
of the proceeds of the robbery he must fulfil the promise, which, in a passionate moment, he
had bestowed. Davia was as clay in his hands. Jean was different. He was possessed of all the
cunning of the half-breed nature, but, looked at from a half-breed point of view, he was a
good man, an honest man. A half-breed will shoot an enemy down in his tracks, while yet he
is a good father and husband, or a dutiful son. He is a man of much badness and some good.
Jean was a little above the average. Possibly it was because his affections were centred upon
but one creature in the world, his sister Davia, that he felt strongly in her cause. He knew
that, at last, he held Victor in a powerful grip, and he did not intend to relax it.

Jean was as good as his word and took up his abode in Victor's store. Nor would he permit the
removal of the treasure under any pretext. This brother of Davia's understood the trader; he
did not watch him; it was the chest that contained the money that occupied his vigilance.

Victor was resourceful and imaginative, but the stolid purpose of the other defied his best
schemes. He meant to get away with the money, but the bulldog watchfulness of Jean gave him
no opportunity. He was held prisoner by his greed, and it seemed as if, in the end, he would
be forced to bend to the other's will.

And no word came from Davia. No word that could cause alarm, or tell them of the dire tragedy
being enacted in the mountains. And the two men, one for ever scheming and the other watching,
passed their time in moody silence.

It was the third day after the foregoing events had taken place, and midday. Victor was in
the store standing in the doorway gazing out across the mighty foothills which stretched far
as the eyes could reach to the east. He was thinking, casting about in his mind for a means
of getting away with the money. Jean was at his post in the inner room.

It was an unbeautiful time of the year. The passing of winter in snow regions is like the moulting
season of fowls, or the season when the furred world sheds its coat. The dazzling whiteness
of the earth is superseded by a dirty drab-grey. The snow lasts long, but its hue is utterly
changed. And now Victor was looking out upon a scene that was wholly dispiriting to the mind
used to the brilliancy of the northern winter.

The trader's thoughts were moving along out over the stretch of country before him, for in
that southeastern direction lay the town of Edmonton, which was his goal. It would be less
than a fortnight before the melting snow would practically inundate the land, therefore what
he had to do must be done at once. And still no feasible scheme presented itself.

He moved impatiently and a muttered curse escaped him. He asked himself the question again
and again while his keen, restless eyes moved eagerly over the scene before him. He took a
chew of tobacco and rolled it about in his mouth with the nervous movement of a man beset.
He could hear Jean moving heavily about the room behind him, and he wondered what he was doing.
But he did not turn to see.

Once let him get upon the trail with the "stuff," and Jean and his sister could go hang. They
would never get him, he told himself. He had not lived in these latitudes for five and twenty
years for nothing. But he ever came back to the pitiful admission that he was not yet on the
trail, nor had he got the treasure. And time was passing.

Suddenly his eyes settled themselves upon a distant spot beyond the creek. Something had caught
his attention, and that something was moving. The sounds of Jean's lumbering movements continued.
Victor no longer heeded them. His attention was fixed upon that movement on the distant slope.

And gradually his brow lightened and something akin to a smile spread over his features. Then
he moved back to his counter, and, procuring a small calendar, glanced hastily at the date.
His look of satisfaction deepened, and his smile became one of triumph. Surely the devil was
with him. Here, in the blackest moment of his despair, was the means he had sought. Yonder
moving object was the laden dog-train coming up from Edmonton, with his half-yearly supplies.
Now he would see whose wits were the sharpest, his or those of the pig-headed Jean, the man
who had dared to dictate to Victor Gagnon. The trader laughed silently.

Gagnon's plan had come to him in a flash. The moment he had recognized that the company's dog-train
was approaching he had realized the timeliness of its coming. It would be at his door within
an hour and a half.

Jean's voice calling him broke in upon his meditations. He was about to pass the summons by
unheeded. Then he altered his mind. Better not force his gaoler to seek him. His eyes might
see what he had seen, and his suspicions might be aroused if he thought that he, Victor, had
seen the dog-train coming and had said nothing. So he turned and obeyed the call with every
appearance of reluctance.

Jean eyed his prisoner coldly as he drew up beside him.

"Wal, I've waited fer you to say as ye'll marry Davi', an' ye ain't had the savvee to wag yer
tongue right, I'm goin' to quit. The snow's goin' fast. They dogs o' mine is gettin saft fer
want o' work. I'm goin' to light right out o' here, Victor, an' the boodle's goin' wi' me."

Jean was the picture of strong, unimaginative purpose. But Victor had that in his mind which
made him bold.

"Ye've held me prisoner, Jean. Ye've played the skunk. Guess you ain't goin' now. Neither is
my share o' the contents o' that chest. Savvee? If ye think o' moving that wad we're goin'
to scrap. I ain't no coyote."

Jean thought for awhile. His lean face displayed no emotion. His giant figure dwarfed the trader
almost to nothing, but he seemed to weigh the situation well before he committed himself.

At last he grunted, which was his way of announcing that his decision was taken.

"I'll have they dogs hitched this afternoon," he said slowly, and with meaning.

"An' I'll set right here by the door," said Gagnon. "Guess the door'll let you pass, but it
ain't big enough fer the chest to git through."

Victor sat himself down as he said and deliberately pulled out a large revolver. This he laid
across his lap. And then the two men eyed each other. Jean was in no way taken aback. In fact
nothing seemed to put him out of his deliberate manner. He allowed the challenge to pass and
went out. But he returned almost immediately and thrust his head in through the doorway.

"Ther' won't be no need fer scrappin' yet awhile," he said. "I 'lows I've changed my way o'
thinkin'. The company's dog-train is comin' up the valley, I guess. When they've gone, we'll see."

And Victor smiled to himself when the giant had once more departed. Then he put his pistol away.

"Wal, that's settled," he said to himself. "The boodle stops right here. Now we'll see, Jean
Leblaude, who's runnin' this layout. Ther's whiskey aboard that train. Mebbe you ain't like
to fergit that. You'll taste sure. As ye jest sed, 'we'll see.'"

The trader knew his man. The great Jean had all the half-breed's weaknesses as well as a more
than usual supply of their better qualities. Sober he was more than dangerous, now that he
had shown his real intentions, for he was a man not likely to be turned from his purpose. But
Victor knew his fondness for drink, and herein lay the kernel of his plan. With him it was
a case of now or never. He must throw everything to the winds for that money, or be burdened
with a wife he did not want, and a brother-in-law he wanted less, with only a third of that
which his greedy heart thirsted for. No, he would measure swords with Jean, and though his
blade was less stout than that of the stolid giant he relied upon its superior keenness and
lightness. He meant to win.

The company's dog-train came up. Two sleds, each hauled by ten great huskies. They were laden
down with merchandise: groceries, blankets, implements, medicines and a supply of spirits,
for medicinal purposes only. Just the usual freight which comes to every trader in the wild.
Such stuff as trappers and Indians need and are willing to take in part payment for their furs.
But Victor only cared for the supply of spirits just then. He paid unusual attention, however,
to the condition of the dogs.

The train was escorted by two half-breeds, one driving each sled. These were experienced hands,
servants who had grown old in the service of the company. Men whose responsibility began when
they hit the trail, and ceased when they arrived at their destination.

Pierre was a grizzled veteran, and his was the charge of the journey. Ambrose was his assistant.
Victor understood these men, and made no delay in displaying his hospitality when the work
of unloading was completed. A ten-gallon keg of Hudson's Bay Rum was part of the consignment,
and this was tapped at once by the wily trader.

The four men were gathered in the back room of the store when Victor turned on the tap and
the thick brown stream gurgled forth from the cask. He poured out a tot for each of the train
drivers. Then he stood uncertainly and looked over at Jean. The latter had seated himself over
against the stove and appeared to take little interest in what was going on. Victor stood with
one foot tapping the floor impatiently. He had been quick to notice that Jean's great eyes
had stolen in the direction of the little oaken keg. At last he threw the tin beaker aside
as if in disgust. He played his part consummately.

"'Tain't no go, boys. I'm not drinkin'. Thet's what. Look at him," he cried, pointing at Jean.
"We've had words, I guess. Him an' me, an' he's that riled as he don't notion suppin' good
thick rum wi' us. Wal, I guess it'll keep, what you boys can't do in. Ther's the pannikin,
ther's the keg. Jest help yourselves, lads, when you fancy. I ain't tastin' with bad blood
runnin' in this shack."

"What, no drink?" cried old Pierre, his face beaming with oily geniality. "Dis no lak ole time,
Victor. What's de fuss? Mebbe I tink right. Squaw, Vic, squaw."

The old boy chuckled heartily at his pleasantry. He was a French-Canadian half-breed and spoke
with a strong foreign accent. Ambrose joined in the laugh.

"Ho, Jean, man," cried the latter. "No bad blood, I'm guessin'. Ther's good thick rum, lad,
an' I mind you're a'mighty partial most gener'ly."

Victor had started the ball rolling, and he knew that neither Pierre nor Ambrose were likely
to let it rest until they had had all the rum they wanted. Everything had been made snug for
the night so they only had their own pleasure to consider. As Ambrose's challenge fell upon
his ears Jean looked up. His eyes were very bright and they rested longingly upon the keg on
their way to the driver's face. He shook his head, but there was not much decision in the movement.

Pierre seeing the action stepped up to him and shook a warning finger in his face.

"Hey, you, Jean-le-gros, pig-head. We come lak Hell, four hundred mile to see you. We bring
you drink, everyting. You not say 'How.' We not welcome. Bah, I spit! In my Quebec we lak our
frien's to come. We treat. All is theirs. Bah, I spit again."

Jean looked slightly abashed. Then Ambrose chimed in.

"Out of the durned way, froggy," he said, swinging Pierre aside by the shoulder, "you don't
understand our ways, I guess. Ther' ain't no slobberin' wi' white folk. Here you, Vic, hold
out yer hand, man, and shake wi' Jean. We're goin' to hev a time to-night, or I'll quit the
road for ever."

Victor shrugged. Then he picked up a pannikin and filled it with rum. He held it out in his
left hand towards Jean while he offered his right in token of friendship. Jean eyed the outstretched
hand. Then he looked at the rum, and the insidious odour filled his nostrils. The temptation
was too great, as Victor knew it would be, for him. He thrust one great hand into the trader's
and the two men shook; then he took the drink and gulped it down.

The armistice was declared, and Victor, in imagination, already saw the treasure his.

Now the pannikin passed round merrily. The room reeked with the pungent odour of the spirit
and all was apparently harmonious. Victor resigned his post as dispenser of liquor to Ambrose,
and began his series of stock entertainments. He drank as little as possible himself, though
he could not openly shirk his drink, and he always kept one eye upon Jean to see that he was
well supplied; and so the time slipped by.

After the first taste Jean became a different man; he laughed and jested in his slow, coarse
fashion, and, with him, all seemed good-fellowship. Pierre and Ambrose soon began to get drunk
and Victor's voice, as he sang, was mostly drowned by the rolling tones of these hoary-headed
old sinners as they droned out the choruses of his songs.

Now, as the merriment waxed, Victor was able to shirk his drink deliberately. Jean seemed insatiable,
and soon his great body swayed in a most drunken fashion, and he clung to his seat as if fearing
to trust his legs. He joined in every chorus and never lost an opportunity of addressing Victor
in terms of deepest friendliness. And in every pause in the noise he seized upon the chance
to burst out into some wild ditty of his own. Victor watched with cat-like vigilance, and what
he saw pleased him mightily. Jean was drunk. And he would see to it that before he had done
the giant would be hopelessly so.

Evening came on. Ambrose was the first to collapse. The others laughed and left him to his
deep dreamless slumber upon the floor. Victor was wearied of it all, but he knew he must see
the game out. Jean's eyelids were drooping heavily, and he, too, seemed on the verge of collapse.
Only old Pierre, hardened to the ways of his life, flagged not. Suddenly the Frenchman saw
Jean's head droop forward. In a moment he was on his unsteady legs and filling a pannikin to
the brim. He laughed as he drew Victor's attention, and the latter nodded approval. Then he
put it to the giant's lips. The big man supped a little of it, then, his head falling further
forward, he upset the pannikin, and the contents poured upon the earthen floor. At the same
time, as though utterly helpless, he rolled off his seat and fell to the ground, snoring heavily.
Pierre shouted his delight. Only Victor and he were left. They knew how to take their liquor,
the old hands. His pride of achievement was great. He would see Victor under the table, too,
he told himself. He stood over the trader while the latter drank a bumper. Then he, himself,
drank to the dregs. It was the last straw. He swayed and lurched to the outer door. There he
stood for a moment, then the cold night air did for him what the rum had been powerless to
do. Without warning he fell in a heap upon the doorstep as unconscious as though he had been
struck dead.

Victor alone kept his head.

The trader rose from his seat and stretched himself. Then, stealthily, he went the round of
the prostrate men. He shook Ambrose, but could not wake him. Jean he stood over for awhile
and silently watched the stern face. There was not a shade of consciousness in its expression.
He bent down and touched him. Still no movement. He shook him gently, then more roughly. He
was like a log. Victor grinned with a fiendish leer.

"Guess he's fixed," he muttered.

Then he went out into the store and came to the door where old Pierre had fallen. The Frenchman
was no better than the others.

"Good! By Gar, Jean, my friend, I've done you," he said to himself, as, reassured, he went
back to the inner room. He was none too steady himself, but he had all his wits about him.
The chest was near the bed. He picked it up and opened it. The treasure was there safe enough.
He closed the lid and took it up in his arms, and passed out of the store. Nor did he look
back. He was anxious to be gone.

It was the chance of his lifetime, he told himself, as he hastened to deposit the chest in
the sled. Now he set about obtaining his blankets and provisions. His journey would be an arduous
one, and nobody knew better than he the barrenness of that Northwestern land while the icy
grip of winter still clings. A large quantity of the food stuffs which had only arrived that
day was returned to the sled, and some of the new blankets. Then he shipped a rifle and ammunition.

Now was the trader to be seen in his true light. Here was emergency, when all veneer fell from
him as the green coat of summer falls from the trees at the first breath of winter. His haste
was not the swift movements of a man whose nerve is steady. He knew that he had at least twelve
hours before any one of the three men were likely to awaken from their drunken stupor. And
yet he feared. Nor did he know what he feared. And his nerves made him savage as he handled
the dogs. They were living creatures and could feel, so he wantonly belted them with a club
lest they should hesitate to obey their new master. The great wolfish creatures had more courage
than he had; they took the unjust treatment without open complaint, as is the way of the husky,
tacitly resenting it and eying with fierce, contemptuous eyes the cowardly wretch who so treated
them. They slunk slowly and with down-drooped tails and bristling manes into their places in
the traces, and stood ready for the word to pull. Victor surveyed them with little satisfaction,
for now that all was ready to march he was beset with moral apprehensions.

He could not throw off his dread. It may have been that he feared that bleak four hundred mile
journey. It may have been the loneliness which he contemplated. It may have been that he recollected
the time when those whom he had robbed had saved him from the storm, away back there in the
heart of the mountains. He shivered, and started at every night-sound that broke the stillness.

The lead dog lay down in the sloppy snow. Victor flew into a passion, and, running forward,
dealt the poor brute a kick that would have been sufficient to break an ordinary dog's ribs.
With a wicked snarl the beast rose solemnly to its feet. Suddenly its wolf-ears pricked and
it stared out keenly ahead. The man looked too. It seemed to him that he had heard the sound
of some one walking. He gazed long and earnestly out into the darkness, but all seemed quite
still. He looked at the dog again. Its ears were still pricked, but they were twitching uncertainly,
as though not sure of the direction whence the sound had come.

Victor cursed the brute and moved back to the sled. The word "Mush" was hovering on his lips.
Suddenly his eyes chanced upon the slumbering form of old Pierre lying in a heap where he had
fallen in the doorway. It is impossible to say what made him pause to give a second thought
to those he was leaving behind. He had known Pierre for years, and had always been as friendly
as his selfish, cruel nature would permit. Perhaps some such feeling now made him hesitate.
It might even have been his knowledge of the wild that made him view the helpless figure with
some concern. The vagaries of human nature are remarkable. Something held him, then he turned
quickly from the sled, and stepping up to the old man's side, stooped, and putting his arms
about him, dragged him bodily into the store. Pierre did not rouse but remained quite still
where Victor left him. Then the trader went out again. His back was turned as he reached to
close the door. It would not quite shut and he pulled it hard. Then, as it still resisted his
efforts, he turned away. As he turned he reeled back with a great cry.

Something large and dark faced him. And, even in the darkness, he could make out a shining
ring of metal close in front of his face.

Victor's horror-stricken cry was the only sound that came. In the twinkling of an eye the metal
ring disappeared. Victor felt two bony hands seize him by the throat. The next instant he was
hurled to the ground, and a knee was upon his chest. A weight compressed his lungs and he could
scarcely breathe. Then he felt the revolver belt dragged from about his waist and his long
sheath-knife withdrawn from its sheath. Then, and not till then, the pressure on his chest
relaxed, and the hand that had gripped his throat released its hold. The next moment he was
lifted to his feet as though he were a mere puppet, and the voice of Jean Leblaude broke harshly
upon his ears.

"Guess your bluff wa'n't wuth a cent, Victor Gagnon. I see'd this comin' the minit you pass'd
me the drink. I 'lows ye ken mostly tell a skunk by the stink. I rec'nized you awhiles back.
Guess you ain't lightin' out o' here this night. Come right along."

The trader had no choice. Jean had him foul, gripping him with a clutch that was vise-like.
The giant's great strength was irresistible when put forth in the deadly earnestness of passion,
and just now he could hardly hold his hand from breaking the neck which was so slight beneath
his sinewy fingers.

Just for one instant Victor made a faint struggle. As well attempt to resist Doom. Jean shook
him like a rat and thrust him before him in the direction of the woods behind the store.

"You'll pay fer this," the trader said, between his teeth.

But Jean gave no heed to his impotent rage. He pushed him along in silence, nor did he pause
till the secret huts were reached. He opened the door of one and dragged his captive in. There
was no light within. But this seemed no embarrassment to the purposeful man. He strode straight
over to one corner of the room and took a long, plaited lariat from the wall. In three minutes
Victor was trussed and laid upon the ground bound up like a mummy.

Now Jean lighted a lamp and looked down at his victim; there was not the faintest sign of drink
about him, and as Victor noticed this he cursed himself bitterly.

There was an impressive silence. Then Jean's words came slowly. He expressed no emotion, no
passion; just the purpose of a strong man who moves relentlessly on to his desired end.

Gagnon realized to the full the calamity which had befallen him.

"Ye'll wait right here till Davi' gits back. She's goin' to git her ears full o' you, I guess.
Say, she was sweet on you--mighty sweet. But she's that sensible as it don't worry any. Say,
you ain't goin' to marry that gal; ye never meant to. You're a skunk, an' I'd as lief choke
the life out o' ye as not. But I'm goin' to pay ye sorer than that. Savvee? Ye'll bide here
till Davi' comes. I'll jest fix this wedge in your mouth till I've cleared them drivers out
o' the store. I don't fancy to hear your lungs exercisin' when I'm busy."

With easy deftness Jean gagged his prisoner. Then he glanced round the windowless shack to
see if there was any weapon or other thing about that could possibly assist the trader to free
himself. Having assured himself that all was safe he put out the light and passed out, securing
the door behind him.

CHAPTER XIII.

OUT ON THE NORTHLAND TRAIL

Noon, the following day, saw the dog-train depart on its homeward journey. The way of it was
curious and said much for the simplicity of these "old hands" of the northland trail. They
were giants of learning in all pertaining to their calling; infants in everything that had
to do with the world of men.

Thus Jean Leblaude's task was one of no great difficulty. It was necessary that he should throw
dust in their eyes. And such a dust storm he raised about their simple heads that they struck
the trail utterly blinded to the events of the previous night.

While they yet slumbered Jean had freed the dogs from their traces, and unloaded the sled which
bore the treasure-chest. He had restored everything to its proper place; and so he awaited
the coming of the morning. He did not sleep; he watched, ready for every emergency.

When, at last, the two men stirred he was at hand. Rolling Pierre over he shook him violently
till the old man sat up, staring about him in a daze. A beaker of rum was thrust against his
parched lips, and he drank greedily. The generous spirit warmed the Frenchman's chilled body
and roused him. Then Jean performed the same merciful operation upon Ambrose, and the two unrepentant
sinners were on their legs again, with racking heads, and feeling very ill.

But Jean cared nothing for their sufferings; he wanted to be rid of them. He gave them no chance
to question him; not that they had any desire to do so, in fact it was doubtful if they fully
realized anything that was happening. And he launched into his carefully considered story.

"Victor's gone up to the hills 'way back ther'," he said. "Ther's been a herd o' moose come
down, from the moose-yard, further north, an' he's after their pelts. Say, he left word fer
you to git right on loadin' the furs, an' when ye hit the trail ye're to take three bottles
o' the Rye, an' some o' the rum. He says he ain't like to be back fer nigh on three days."

And while he was speaking the two men supped their coffee, and, as they moistened their parched
and burning throats, they nodded assent to all Jean had to say. At that moment Victor, or any
one else, might go hang. All they thought of was the awful thirst that assailed them.

Breakfast over, the work of loading the sleds proceeded with the utmost dispatch. Thus it was
that at noon, without question, without the smallest suspicion of the night's doings, they
set out for the weary "long trail."

Jean saw them go. He stood at the door of the store and watched them until they disappeared
behind the rising ground of the great Divide. Then his solemn eyes turned away indifferently,
and he gazed out into the hazy distance. His gaunt face showed nothing of what was passing
in the brain behind it. He rarely displayed emotion of any sort. The Indian blood in his veins
preponderated, and much of the stoical calm of the Redskin was his. Now he could wait, undisturbed,
for the return of Davia. He felt that he had mastered the situation. He could not make Victor
marry the sister he had wronged, but at least he could pay off the wrong in his own way, and
to his entire satisfaction. Two years he had waited for the adjustment of these matters. He
was glad that he had exercised patience. He might have slain Victor a hundred times over, but
he had refrained, vainly hoping to see his sister righted. Besides, he knew that Davia had
loved Victor, and women are peculiar. Who might say but that she would have fled from the murderer
of her lover? Jean felt well satisfied on the whole. So he stood thinking and waiting with
a calm mind.

But the tragedy was working itself out in a manner little suspected, little expected, by him.
This he was soon to learn.

The grey spring snow spread itself out on every hand, only was the wood-lined hill, which stretched
away to the right and left of him, and behind the hut, bare of the wintry pall. The sky was
brilliant in contrast with the greyness of the world beneath it, and the sun shone high in
the blue vault. Everywhere was the deadly calm of the Silent North. The presence of any moving
forest beast in that brooding picture, however distant, must surely have caught the eye. There
was not a living thing to be seen. These woful wastes have much to do with the rugged nature
of those who dwell in the north.

Suddenly the whole prospect seemed to be electrified with a thrill of life. The change came
with a swift movement of the man's quiet eyes. Nothing had really altered in the picture, nothing
had appeared, and yet that swift flash of the eyes had brought a suggestion of something which
broke up the solitude as though it had never been.

Awhile, and his attention became fixed upon the long line of woods to the right. Then his ears
caught a slight but distinct sound. He stood away from the doorway, and, shading his eyes from
the sunlight, looked keenly along the dark shadow of the woods. No wolf or fox could have keener
instinct than had this man. A sound of breaking brush, but so slight that it probably would
have passed unheeded by any other, had told him that some one approached through these woods.

He waited.

Suddenly there was movement in the shadow. The next moment a figure stepped out into the open.
A figure, dressed in beaded buckskin and blanket clothing. It was Davia.

She came in haste, yet wearily. She looked slight and drooping in her mannish garments, while
the pallor of her drawn face was intense. She came up to where Jean stood and would have fallen
but for his support. Her journey had been rapid and long, and she was utterly weary of body.

"Quick, let's git inside," she cried, in a choking voice. Then she added hysterically: "He's
on the trail."

Without a word Jean led her into the house, and she flung herself into a seat. A little whiskey
put new life into her and the colour came back to her face. For example, those who have more
frequently looked with admiration upon the stature of men, by the
name man will understand an animal of erect stature, while those who
have been in the habit of fixing their thoughts on something else,
will form another common image of men, describing man, for instance,
as an animal capable of laughter, a biped without feathers, a rational
animal, and so on; each person forming universal images of things
according to the temperament of his own body.

It is not therefore to be wondered at that so many controversies
have arisen amongst those philosophers who have endeavored to explain
natural objects by the images of things alone.

The Three Kinds of Knowledge

From what has been already said, it clearly appears that we perceive
many things and form universal ideas:

1.

From individual things, represented by the senses to us in a mutilated
and confused manner, and without order to the intellect.

These perceptions I have therefore been in the habit of calling knowledge
from vague experience.

2. From signs; as, for example, when we hear or read certain words, we recollect things and form
certain ideas of them similar to them, through which ideas we imagine
things.

These two ways of looking at things I shall hereafter call knowledge of the first kind, opinion
or imagination.

3. From our possessing common notions and adequate ideas of the properties
of things.

This I shall call reason and knowledge of the second kind.

Besides these two kinds of knowledge, there is a third, as I shall hereafter show, which we
shall call intuitive science. This kind of knowing advances from an adequate idea of the formal
essence of certain attributes of God to the adequate knowledge of the essence of things. All
this I will explain by one example.

Let there be three numbers given through which it is required to discover a fourth which shall be
to the third as the second is to the first.

 The blue eyes fairly blazed.

"The boodle," with a glance in the direction of the treasure. "He was fer jumpin' the lot."

"Hah! An'--?"

And Jean told his story. And after that a silence fell.

"It's cursed--it's blood-money!" Davia's voice was hoarse with emotion as she said the words.

Jean started.

"We're goin' to git," he said slowly. And he looked into the woman's eyes as though he would
read her very soul.

"An' Victor?" said Davia harshly.

"Come, we'll go to him."

At the door Davia was seized with an overwhelming terror. She gripped Jean's arm forcefully
while she peered along the woodland fringe. The man listened.

"Let's git on quick," Davia whispered. And her mouth was dry with her terror.

They found Victor as Jean had left him. The prisoner looked up when the door opened. His eyes
brightened at the sight of the woman.

No word was spoken for some moments. In that silence a drama was swiftly working itself out.
Victor was calculating his chances. Davia was thinking in a loving woman's unreasoning fashion.
And Jean was watching both. At last the giant stooped and removed the gag from his captive's
mouth. The questioning eyes of Victor Gagnon looked from one to the other and finally rested
upon Davia.

"Wal?" he said.

And Davia turned to Jean.

"Loose him!" she said imperiously.

And Jean knew that trouble had come for his plans. He shook his head. The glance of Victor's
eyes as they turned upon Jean was like the edge of a super-sharpened knife. The trader knew
that a crisis had arrived. Which was the stronger of these two, the brother or the sister?
He waited.

"What are you goin' to do with him?" Davia asked.

She could scarcely withhold the anger which had risen within her.

But Jean did not answer; he was listening to a strange sound which came to him through the
open door. Suddenly he stooped again and began to readjust the rope that held his prisoner.
He secured hands and feet together in a manner from which Victor was not likely to free himself
easily; and yet from which it was possible for him to get loose. Davia followed his movements
keenly. At last the giant rose; his task was completed.

"Now," he said, addressing them both. "Say your says--quick."

"You ain't leavin' him here," said the woman, looking squarely into her brother's eyes.

"That's so."

A strange light leapt into Davia's eyes. Jean saw it and went on with a frown.

"I'm easy, dead easy; but I guess I've had enough. He'll shift fer himself. If he'd 'a' acted
straight ther'd 'a' been no call fer me to step in. He didn't. He ain't settin' you right,
Davi'; he can't even act the thief decent. He'd 'a' robbed you an' me, an' left you what you
are. Wal, my way goes."

Then he turned to Victor and briefly told him Davia's story of the mountain tragedy. As he
came to the climax the last vestige of the trader's insolence vanished. Nick was on his way
to the store armed and--mad. Panic seized upon the listener. His bravado had ever been but
the veneer of the surface. His condition returned to the subversive terror which had assailed
him when he was caught in the mountain blizzard.

"Now, see you here, Victor," Jean concluded coldly, yet watching the effect he had produced.
"Ye owe us a deal more'n ye ken pay easy, but I'm fixin' the reckonin' my way. We're goin',
an' the boodle goes wi' us. Savvee?" Davia watched her brother acutely. Nor could she help
noticing that the great man was listening while he spoke. "I 'lows you'll git free o' this
rope. I mean ye to--after awhiles. Ye'll keep y'r monkey tricks till after we're clear o' here.
Then ye'll do best to go dead easy. Fer that crank's comin' right along, an', I 'lows, if I
was you I'd as lief lie here and rot, an' feed the gophers wi' my carcass as run up agin him.
I tell ye, pard, ther's a cuss hangin' around wher' Nick Westley goes, an' I don't reckon it's
like to work itself out easy by a big sight."

Jean finished up with profound emphasis. Then he turned about and faced his sister.

"Now, gal, we're goin'."

"Not while Victor's left here."

Jean stood quite still for a moment. Then his rage suddenly broke forth.

"Not while that skunk's left?" he cried, pointing scornfully at the prostrate man. "Ye'd stop
here fer him as has shamed ye; him as 'ud run from ye this minit if he had the chance; him
as 'ud rob ye too; him as thinks as much to ye as a coyote. Slut y' are, but y' are my sister,
an' I say ye shall go wi' me."

He made a step towards her. Then he brought up to a halt as the long blade of a knife gleamed
before his eyes. But he only hesitated a second. His great hand went out, and he caught the
woman's wrist as she was about to strike. The next instant he had wrenched the weapon from
her grasp and held her.

Now he thrust her out of the hut and secured the door. He believed that what he had done was
only right.

As they passed out into the bright spring daylight again a change seemed to come over Davia.
Her terror of Nick Westley returned as she noted the alert attitude of her brother. She listened
too, and held her breath to intensify her hearing. But Jean did not relax his hold upon her
till they were once more within the store. Then he set her to assist in the preparations for
their flight. When all was ready, and they stood outside the house while Jean secured the door,
Davia made a final appeal.

"Let me stop, Jean," she cried, while a sob broke from her. "I love him. He's mine."

"God's curse on ye, no!" came the swift response, and the man's eyes blazed.

Suddenly a long-drawn cry rose upon the air. It reached a great pitch and died lingeringly
away. It was near by and told its tale. And the woman shuddered involuntarily. It was the wolf
cry of the mountains; the cry of the human. And, as if in answer, came a chorus from wolfish
throats. The last moment had come.

Davia caught Jean's arm as though seeking protection.

"I will go," she cried, and the man took her answer to be a final submission.

The stillness of the day had passed. Life thrilled the air although no life was visible. Davia's
fear was written in her face, Jean's expression was inscrutable; only was it sure that he listened.

But Jean was not without the superstitious dread which madness inspires. And as they raced,
he bearing the burden of the treasure-chest, for the wood-covered banks of the creek, he was
stirred to horror by the familiar sounds that pursued him. It was their coming, at that time,
in daylight; and in answer to the human cry that had first broken up the silence of the hills.
How came it that the legions of the forest were marching in the wake of that other upon the
valley of Little Choyeuse Creek?

Jean halted when they stood upon the rotten ice of the creek. Now he released his sister, and
they stood facing each other well screened from view from the store.

The sullen peace of the valley had merged into the deep-toned, continuous howl of hoarse throats.
A terrible threat was in the sound. Jean unslung his rifle and looked to his pistol.

"Ther's six in this gun," he said deliberately. "Five of 'em is fer them beasties, if ne'sary.
The other's fer you if you git playin' tricks. Mebbe ye'll thank me later fer what I'm doin'.
It don't cut no figger anyway."

Then he prodded the ice with his iron-shod staff.

Davia watched him while she listened to the din of the forest world. At length the staff had
beaten its way to the water below.

"What are ye doin'?" she asked, quite suddenly.

And Jean's retort was a repetition of her own words.

"It's cursed--it's blood-money!"

She took his meaning, and her cupidity cried out in revolt. But her protest was useless.

"You're not goin'--" she began.

"It goes," cried Jean fiercely, "wher' he ain't like to touch it, 'less Hell gits him. Father
Lefleur, at the mission, says as gold's Hell's pavin', an' mebbe this'll git back wher' it
come." And with vengeful force he threw back the lid of the chest.

Davia's eyes expressed more than any words could have told. She stood silently by, a mute but
eloquent protest, while Jean took the bags of gold dust one by one from the chest, and poured
their contents into the water below. When the last bag was emptied he took the packet of bills
and fingered them gently. Even his purpose seemed to be shaken by the seductive feel of the
familiar paper. Suddenly he thrust them into the hole, and his staff thrust viciously at them
as he pushed them under the ice where they would quickly rot. It was done.

"Mebbe the water'll wash the blood off'n it," he exclaimed. "Mebbe."

Davia's eyes looked derisively upon the giant figure as he straightened himself up. She could
not understand.

But her look changed to one of horror a moment later, as above the cries of the forest rose
the inhuman note of the madman. Both recognized it, and the dreadful tone gripped their hearts.
Jean leant forward, and seizing the woman by the arm dragged her off the ice to the cover of
the bush.

With hurried strides they made their way through the leafless branches, until they stood where,
themselves well under cover, they had a view of the store.

CHAPTER XIV.

WHO SHALL FATHOM THE DEPTHS OF A WOMAN'S LOVE?

The dull woods look black in the bright sunlight; and beyond, and above, the crystal of the
eternal snow gleams with appalling whiteness. No touch of spring can grey those barren, everlasting
fields, where foot of man has never trod, and no warmth can penetrate to the rock-bound earth
beneath.

All the world seems to be reaching to the sky vault above. Everything is vast; only is the
work of human hands puny.

Thus the old log storehouse of Victor Gagnon, now shut up like a deserted fort of older days,
without its stockade, is less than a terrier's kennel set at the door of a giant's castle.
And yet it breaks up the solitude so that something of the savage magnificence is gone. The
forest cries echo and reëcho, and, to human ears, the savage din is full of portentous meaning,
but it is lost beyond the confines of the valley; and the silent guardians of the peaks above
sleep on undisturbed.

A mighty flock of water-fowl speeding their way, droop downwards, with craning necks, at the
unusual sounds, to watch the stealing creatures moving at the edge of the woods. The fox, hungering
as he always hungers, foremost, lest other scavengers, like himself, shall steal the prize
he seeks; a troupe of broad-antlered deer racing headlong down the valley; shaggy wolves, grey
or red, lurking within the shadow, as though fearing the open daylight, or perhaps him whose
voice has summoned them; these things they see, but their meaning is lost to the feathered
wanderers, as they wing their way onward.

The cry of the human floats over the tree-tops and beats itself out upon the solemn hillsides.
It has in it a deep-toned note of invitation to the fierce denizens of the forest. A note which
they cannot resist; and they answer it, and come from hill and valley, gathering, gathering,
with hungry bellies and frothing jowls.

Driving his way through close-growing bush comes the unkempt figure of a man. A familiar figure,
but so changed as to be hardly recognizable. His clothes are rent and scored by the horny branches.
His feet crush noisily over the pine-cones in moccasins that have rotted from his feet with
the journey over melting snow and sodden vegetation. There is a quivering fire burning in his
eyes, an uncertain light, like the sun's reflections upon rippling water. He looks neither
this way nor that, yet his eyes seem to be flashing in all directions at once. The bloody scar
upon his cheek is dreadful to look upon, for it has scarce begun to heal, and the cold has
got into it. He is armed, as Davia had said, this strange horrific figure, and at intervals
his head is thrown back to give tongue to his wolfish cry. It almost seems as if the Spirit
of the Forest has claimed him.

He journeys on through the twilit gloom. The horror of the life gathered about him is no more
grim than is the condition of his witless brain. Over hills and through brakes; in valleys
and along winding tracks made by the forest lords; now pushing his way through close-growing
scrub, now passing like a fierce shadow among the bare, primeval tree-trunks, he moves forward.
His goal is ahead, and one instinct, one desire, urges him onward. He knows nought of his surroundings,
he sees nought. His chaotic brain is aware only of its mad purpose.

Suddenly the bush parts. There stands the store of Victor Gagnon in the bright light of day.
Swift to the door he speeds, but pauses as he finds it locked. The pause is brief. A shot from
his pistol shatters the lock, the door flies open at his touch, and he passes within. Then
follows a cry that has in it the tone of a baffled creature robbed of its prey; it is like
the night cry of the puma that shrinks at the blaze of the camp-fire; it is fierce, terrible.
The house is empty.

But the cunning of the madman does not desert him. He sets out to search, peering here, there,
and everywhere. As the moments pass, and no living thing is to be seen within, his anger rises
like a fierce summer storm. He stands in the centre of the store which is filled with a disordered
array of stuffs. His eyes light upon the wooden trap which opens upon the cellar where Victor
stores his skins. Once more the fire flares up in his dreadful eyes. An oil-lamp is upon a
shelf. He dashes towards it, and soon its dull, yellow flame sheds its feeble rays about. He
stoops and prises up the heavy square of wood. Below sees the top rungs of a rough ladder.
His poor brain is incapable of argument and with a fierce joy he clambers down into the dank,
earthy atmosphere of the cellar.

All is silent again except for the shuffling of his almost bare feet upon the uneven ladder.
The last rung is gone, and he drops heavily to the ground. Then, for awhile, silence reigns.

During that silence there comes a figure stealing round the angle at the back of the building.
It is a slight, dark figure, and it moves with extreme caution. There is a look on the narrow
face which is one of superstitious horror. It is Victor Gagnon escaped from his prison, and
he advances haltingly, for he has seen the approach of his uncanny visitor, and he knows not
what to do. His inclination is to flee, yet is he held fascinated. He advances no further than
the front angle of the building, where he stands shaking with nervous apprehension.

Suddenly he hears a cry that is half-stifled by distance, for it comes from the depths of the
cellar within. Then follows a metallic clatter of something falling, which, in turn, is followed
again by a cry that is betwixt a fierce exclamation of joy and a harsh laugh. A foreboding
wrings the heart of the half-breed trader.

Now he listens with every sense aiding him, and a strange sound comes to his ears. It is a
sound like the rushing of water or the sighing of the wind through the skeleton branches of
forest-trees. It grows louder, and, in its midst, he hears the stumbling of feet within the
house. Something, he knows not what, makes him look about him fearfully, but he remains at
his post. He dare not move.

At last he thrusts his head forward and peers round the corner so that he has a full view of
the door. Then he learns the meaning of the sound he has heard. Great clouds of smoke are belching
through the opening, and are rolling heavily away upon the chill, scented air. His jaws come
together, his breath catches, and a look that is the expression of a mind distracted leaps
into his eyes. He knows that his store is on fire. He does not leave his lurking-place, for
he knows that there is no means of staying the devouring flames. Besides, the man must still
be within. Yes, he is certainly still within the building, for he can hear him.

The cries of the wild come up from the forest but Victor no longer heeds them. The hiss and
crackle of the burning house permeate his brain. His eyes watch the smoke with a dreadful fascination.
He cannot think, he can only watch, and he is gripped by a more overwhelming terror than ever.

Suddenly a fringe of flame pursues the smoke from the door. It leaps, and rushes up the woodwork
of the thatch above and shoots along to the pitch of the roof. The rapidity of the mighty tongues
is appalling. Still the man is within the building, for Victor can hear his voice as he talks
and laughs at the result of his handiwork.

The madman's voice rises high above the roar of the flames. The fire seems to have driven him
to the wildest pitch of insensate excitement, and Victor begins to wonder what the end will be.

A moment later he hears distant words come from the burning house. They come in a shout that
is like the roar of some wild beast, and they sound high above every other sound. There is
in them the passionate ring of one who abandons all to one overpowering desire.

"Aim-sa! Aim-sa! Wait, I'm comin'."

There is an instant's silence which the sound of the hungry flames devours. Then, through the
blazing doorway, the great form of Nick Westley rushes headlong, shouting as he comes.

"Aim-sa! Aim-sa!"

The cry echoes and reëchoes, giving fresh spirit to the baying of the wolves that wait in the
cover of the woodland. On rushes the man heedless of the excoriating roughnesses of the ground
beneath his bare and battered feet. He gazes with staring eyes upon the woods as though he
sees the vision of the woman that has inspired his cry. On, he speeds towards the beasts whose
chorus welcomes him; on, to the dark woods in which he plunges from view.

                   *       *       *       *       *

Jean Leblaude, standing within cover of the woods which lined the creek, was lost to all sight
and sound other than the strange scene enacted at the store. Once or twice he had spoken, but
it was more to himself than to Davia, for he was engrossed by what he beheld.

But now, as he saw the man rush with frantic haste and disappear within the woods, he thought
of the wealth of skins within the burning house. He was a trapper, and, to his thinking, the
loss was irreparable. He loved the rich furs of the North as any woman loves her household
goods. As for the store, that was little to him except that Victor was now punished even beyond
his, Jean's, hopes. He knew that the trader was ruined. For the rest it would be as it always
was in the wild. The valley would simply go back to its primordial condition.

But he watched Victor curiously. He saw him stand out before the wreck of his store, and a
world of despair and dejection was in his attitude. A mighty bitterness was in the great Jean's
heart for the man he gazed upon, and a sense of triumphant joy flashed through him at the sight.

"See," he said, without turning from his contemplation, and pointing with one arm outstretched.
"He's paid, an' paid bad. The teachin's come to him. Maybe he's learned." 

Therefore it is of the nature of reason to consider things under this
form of eternity.

Moreover, the foundations of reason are notions which explain those things which are common to
all, and these things explain the essence of no individual thing, and must therefore be conceived
without any relation to time, but under a certain form of eternity.

The Limits of Human Knowledge

I

The parts composing the human body pertain to the essence of the body itself only in so far
as they communicate their motions to one another by some certain method, and not in so far as
they can be considered as individuals without relation to the human body. For the parts of
the human body are individuals, composite to a high degree, parts of which can be separated from the
human body and communicate their motions to other bodies in another way, although the nature
and form of the human body itself is closely preserved.

Therefore the idea or knowledge of each part will be in God in so far as He is considered as affected
by another idea of an individual thing, which individual thing is prior to the part itself
in the order of Nature. The same thing may be said of each part of the individual itself composing
the human body, and therefore the knowledge of each part composing
the human body exists in God in so far as He is affected by a number
of ideas of things, and not in so far as He has the idea of the human
body only; that is to say, the idea which constitutes the nature of
the human mind; and therefore the human mind does not involve an adequate
knowledge of the parts composing the human body. He knew that
that weapon had been given for defence against himself.

That evening the setting sun shone down upon a solitary camp-fire on the Northland trail, and
beside it sat a large man crouching for warmth. He was smoking; and as he smoked he thought
much. All the days he had lived he had never known a woman's love. He muttered as he kicked
the sticks of his fire together, and spat into the blaze as it leapt up.

"Maybe it's a fine thing. Maybe they're queer critturs. Mostly saft an' gentle an'--um--I wonder--"

The sun sank abruptly, and the brief twilight gave place to a night that was little less than
day. The northern lights danced their mystic measure in the starlit vault to the piping of
the Spirit of the North. The hush of the Silent Land was only broken by the cries which came
up from the dark valleys and darker forests. And the lonely giant, Jean Leblaude, slept the
light slumber of the journeyer in the wild; the slumber that sees and hears when danger is
abroad, and yet rests the body. He dreamed not, though all his schemes had gone awry, for he
was weary.

CHAPTER XV.

THE TRAGEDY OF THE WILD

"Aim-sa! Aim-sa! I come!"

The cry rings against the mountainsides, shuddering and failing; then it is lost in the vastness,
like the sound of a pebble pitched into rushing waters. The woodland chorus takes it up in
its own wolfish tongue, and it plunges forth again, magnified by the din of a thousand echoes.

High up to the lair of the mountain lion it rises; where the mighty crags, throne-like, o'ershadow
the lesser woods; where the royal beast, lording it over an inferior world, stealthily prowls
and lashes its angry tail at the impudence of such a disturbance in its vast domain. Its basilisk
stare looks out from its furtive, drooping head, and its commands ring out in a roar of magnificent
displeasure.

Even to loftier heights still the cry goes up; and the mighty grey eagle ruffles its angry
feathers, shakes out its vast wings, and screams invective in answer to this loud-voiced boast
of wingless creatures. Then, in proud disdain, it launches itself out upon the air, and with
a mighty swoop downwards, screaming defiance as its outstretched pinions brush the sleek coat
of the mountain lion, it passes on over the creaking tree-tops to learn the real cause of the
hubbub.

Down the valley, away to the east, the timid deer gather, snuffing at the breeze, fearful,
protesting, yet fascinated. The caribou pauses in his headlong race to listen; only, a moment
later, to speed on the faster.

"Aim-sa! Aim-sa! Wait, I come!"

The cry is more muffled. The dark canopy of forest deadens it, till the sound is like a voice
crying out from the depths of the earth. For the man is travelling with the fierce directness
of one who is lured on by the haunting vision of that which is his whole desire. The riven
mountains have no meaning for him. He looks straight out, nor tree-trunk, nor bush, nor jutting
rock bars his vision; there beyond, ever beyond, is that which alone he seeks. It moves as
he moves; beckoning, calling, smiling. But always, like a will-o'-the-wisp, it eludes him,
and draws forth the cry from his throat. The sweet, mocking face; the profound blue eyes, sparkling
with laughter or brooding in perfect seriousness; the parted lips about the glistening teeth
so luscious in their suggestion; the dark flowing hair, like a soft curtain of wondrous texture
falling in delicate folds upon rounded shoulders--these things he sees. Always ahead the vision
speeds, always beyond. The man's efforts avail nothing.

The wolves upon his trail lope slowly over the forest bed of oozing vegetation; with careless
stride, but with relentless intent, the creatures openly seek their prey. For blood is upon
the air, and they come with the patter of thousands of feet, singing their dolorous chorus
with all the deep meaning of the savage primordial beast. But the man heeds them not. He is
deaf to their raucous song as he is blind to the mighty encompassing hills. What cares he if
the earth links up with the blue heavens above him? What cares he for the everlasting silence
of those heights, or the mute Spirits which repose upon the icy beds of the all-time glaciers?
He is beyond the knowledge of Storm or Calm. He knows nought of the meaning of the awesome
voice of Nature. The vision is all to him, and he gazes upon it with hungry, dreadful eyes.
His heart is starving; his mind is empty of all but the pangs of his all-mastering desire.
If need be he will pursue to the ends of the earth. He has been to the depths of hell for her;
he has felt the withering blast of satanic fires. There is nought for him but possession; possession
of the woman he seeks.

To his distraught fancy, his cries receive answer, and he stumbles blindly on. Meanwhile the
wolves draw ever nearer and nearer, as their courage rises in response to the voice of their
famished bellies. So the strange pursuit goes on, on; over hills and through valleys, now scaling
barren, snow-clad rocks, now clambering drearily down jagged rifts of earth; over Nature's
untrodden trails, or along beaten paths made by the passage of forest beasts. Through clearing
and brake, and over the rotting ice which fills the bed of the mountain torrent. On, on into
Nature's dim recesses, where only the forest creatures lord it, and the feet of man have never
been set.

At length the forests disappear and the magnificent heights rear their snowy crests thousands
of feet skywards. The valleys are left, and behind him and below the forests form but a dark
shadow of little meaning. The greatness is about him; the magnitude of the higher mountain
world. As he faces the unfathomed heights he again treads the snow, for the warm embrace of
Spring has not yet enfolded the higher lands, and the gracious influence of the woods is no
longer to be felt.

He pauses, breathing hard, and the expression of his wounded face is not pleasant. The flesh
is blue, and the eyes are as fierce as the crouching puma's. He looks about him as one in a
daze. The baying of the wolves comes up from below. They still dog him, for the blood trail
holds them fast. A ledge stretches away, winding upwards; a mass of tumbled rocks foot one
towering, solitary pine, and beyond is blank snow.

For the moment he is lost, his vision has deserted him. It may be that weariness has overcome
the power of his illusion, for he stares vacantly about. He looks back, and the breadth of
what he sees conveys no meaning. The woods, with the sound of life coming up to him in deadly
monotony of tone; the hills, beyond, rising till the sun, like a ball of deep red fire, seems
to rest upon their now lurid glacial fields, but is powerless to break their icy bondage; these
things he sees but heeds not. Beyond, far into the hazy distance, stretch hills in their hundreds;
incalculable, remote, all bearing the ruddy tint of sunset; a ghostly array, chaotic, overwhelming
to the brain of man. But the scene has no significance to him. His eyes are the eyes of a man
dead to all but the illusion of a disordered brain. He sees as one partially blinded by the sun.

Suddenly he starts. A sound such as he craves has come to him again. He wheels to the right,
whither the ledge winds round the crag. He peers out; again he sees, and with a cry he rushes
on. A moving figure is upon the road; a smiling figure, a beckoning figure.

Up rises the way, a toilsome path and rugged; slippery and biting to the unshod feet. He feels
no pain; there is the figure. He presses on; and the hungry legions move out from the forest
below and follow boldly upon his trail.

He rounds the bend. The call trembles down the mountainside, and its music is strangely soothing
and sweet to his ears. Quite abruptly a broad plateau spreads out before him. It is edged on
one side by a sheer drop to unimaginable depths, on the other the uprising crags overhang in
horrible menace. The plateau is strewn with bleaching bones, and from beneath the overhanging
rocks comes a fetid stench. Now the figure is lost again, and the dreadful straining eyes search
vainly for the fair face and beckoning hand. His heart labours and great pain is in his chest.
For he is high up in the mountain air, and every breath is an effort.

Nor does he see the crouching object to his right, lying low to the ground, with muscles quivering
and eyes shooting green fire upon him. There is no movement in the savage body but the furious,
noiseless lashing of the tail, and the bristling of the hair at its shoulders. But suddenly
a strange thing happens. The creature shrinks back, and draws slowly away. Its awful eyes are
averted as though in a fear it is powerless to contend with. Its anger is lost in an arrant
cowardice, and the beast slinks within a low-mouthed cavern. What is it that has power to put
fear into the heart of the monarch of the mountainside, unless it is the madness which peers
out of the man's dreadful eyes.

And the man moves on unconscious of any lurking danger. As he passes, the spell of his presence
passes also. A roar comes from the depths of the cavern, and is answered by the wolves as they
crowd up to the edge of the plateau. But though their reply is bold they hesitate to advance
further. For they know who dwells where the broken, bleaching bones lie, and fear is in their
hearts. They snuff at the air with muzzles up-thrown, and their mangy coats bristle with sullen
anger. The crowd increases, the courage of the coward begins to rise within them. A fierce
argument arises, and the debate takes the form of a vicious clipping of huge fangs. A mighty
roar interrupts them, seeming to quell their warlike spirit. For a moment silence reigns.

Then as if by chance, one great dog-wolf is driven out upon the battleground. He is a leader,
high of shoulder, broad of chest, with jaws like the iron fangs of a trap, and limbs that are
so lean that the muscles stand out upon them like knots of rope. And his action is a signal
to the crowd of savage poltroons behind. With one accord they send their fierce battle-cry
out upon the still air, and leap, like the rush of an avalanche, to the lair of the mountain
lion. Out from his shelter springs the royal beast, and close upon his heels comes his mate.
Side by side they stand, ready for the battle though the odds be a million to one against them.

Their sleek bodies are a-quiver with rage, their tails whip the earth in their fury, while
their eyes, like coals of green fire, shine with a malevolence such as no words can describe.

Again the wolves hesitate. Their outstretched tails droop and are pressed between their legs;
their backs are hunched, and they turn their long, narrow heads from the green glitter of the
two pairs of terrible eyes. But the pause is brief, and the noise has died only for a second.
One wolf moves a step forward, hunger overpowering his fears. As before, it is a signal. The
whole pack leap to the fray; struggling, howling, fighting as they come ripping at comrade
and foe alike. The battle is swift; so swift that it is almost impossible to realize that it
is over. The pack, leaping and baying, pass on, following the blood trail of the man, leaving
more bones upon the plateau, more blood upon the trodden snow; and the royal dwellers of that
little plain have vanished as though they had never been.

The path has taken a downward slope and the man looks ahead for the fair face, hungrily, feverishly.
Again it has vanished. His heart cries out bitterly, and his despairing voice echoes through
the barren hills.

As he advances the path declines lower and lower, till out of the shadowy depths the tree-tops
seem climbing to meet him. The air he breathes is denser now, and respiration is easier. As
the path declines its mountainous sides rise higher and higher until overhead only a narrow
streak of sky is revealed, like a soft-toned ribbon set in a background of some dun-coloured
material. Ahead is a barrier of snow and ice, while below him, down in the depths of the gorge,
the earth is clear of the wintry pall and frowns up in gloomy contrast. The sparse vegetation,
too, has changed its appearance. Here towers the silent, portentous pine, but of a type vaster
than can be seen in any other corner of the earth. The man hastens on with all the speed his
weary limbs will permit, stumbling as he goes, for the frost of the high altitudes has entered
his bones, and he cannot now feel the touch of the broken earth. But his yearning heart is
ceaseless in its despairing cry. Where--where is She? The trees come up higher and higher and
the gloom closes in upon him as he reaches the barrier.

Now he pauses under a mighty archway. Below, it is black with age and full of crowding shadows;
the superstructure alone is hung with snowy frost curtains, and these help to emphasize the
forbidding nature of the dark, narrow under-world. Down, down he goes, as though he were journeying
to the very bowels of the earth, heedless of the place, heedless of all but the phantom he
seeks. Again his surroundings have changed. The barrenness is emphasized by skeleton-like trees
of such size as no man has ever seen before. High up aloft there is foliage upon them, but
so meagre, so torn and wasted as to suggest a wreck of magnificent life. These gigantic trunks
are few in number, but so huge that the greatest elm would appear a sapling beside them, and
yet their wondrous size would not be properly estimated. They are the primordial pines, survivors
from an unknown period. They shelter nothing but barrenness, and stand out alone like solemn
sentries, the watchmen for all time of the earth's most dim and secret recesses, where storms
cannot reach, and scarcely the forest beasts dare penetrate.

Again the poor benighted brain finds relief. Down beside these monsters his eyes are gladdened
once more with the fleeting vision. He sees the figure moving ahead, but slowly now; no longer
is she the gay laughing creature he has hitherto followed, she moves wearily, as though exhausted
by the journey she has taken. His heart thrills with hope and joy, for now he knows that he
is overtaking her. Her face is hidden from him, and even her fair form has taken on something
of the hue of her dark surroundings.

"Aim-sa! Aim-sa!" he cries aloud. And again "Aim-sa!"

The gorge rings solemnly with the hoarse echoes, and the place is filled with discordant sounds
which come back to his straining ears mingling with the cries of the wolves that still follow
on his trail.

The figure pauses, looks round, then continues her slow-paced movement; but she does not answer.
Still he sees her, she is there. And now he knows that he must come up with her. He toils on.

He talks to himself, muttering as he goes; and a train of incoherent thought passes through
his brain. He tells himself that the journey is over. She has brought him to the home which
shall be theirs. The heart of the wild, where the mountains rise sheer to the sky above; where
no man comes, where a dark peace reigns, and has ever reigned. Where snow is not, and summer
and winter are alike. It is the fitting home for a tortured spirit.

The figure no longer moves now, but turns and faces him. The sweet familiar features seem to
bend toward him out of the deep shadows and the grim surroundings. He shakes back his shaggy
hair; he holds himself proudly erect as he approaches the woman he loves. He summons all his
failing strength. His knees forget their weariness, his torn feet are unconscious of their
injuries. The haunting cry of the wolves comes down to him from behind, but he heeds only the
beckoning phantom.

Every trailing stride lessens the distance between them.

He sees her stoop as though to adjust her moccasin. She moves again, but she does not stand
erect. A half-articulate cry breaks from him. She is coming to him. Now he sees that her head
is bowed as though in deep humility. A cry breaks from him, then all is silent. Suddenly she
lifts her head and her tall figure stands erect, gazing upon him with sombre, steady eyes,
eyes which seem to have caught something of the dull hue of that awesome gorge. His heart leaps
with joy. How tall she is; what a superb form. She moves toward him, her body swaying gracefully
to the rhythm of her gait. Her arms are stretched out appealingly; and he sees that she is
clad in the rich furs of the North, clad as though for a journey. He tells himself, with a
thrill of mad desire, that she is ready for their journey, the journey of life they will travel
together.

Now the wolf cries come louder and more fierce. If he is deaf to them the woman is not. Her
head turns sharply and a fierce light leaps into her eyes. The change is lost upon the man.
He stretches out his arms and staggers towards her. They come together, and he feels the soft
touch of her fur robes upon his face and hands. Her arms close about him and her warm breath
fans his fevered cheek, as he is drawn, willingly, closer and closer to her bosom.

But what is this? The embrace draws tight, tighter and yet tighter; he becomes rigid in her
arms, he cannot breathe, and life seems to be going from him. He feels his ribs cracking under
the pressure; he cannot cry out; he cannot struggle. Now comes the sound of something ripping,
of flesh being torn by ruthless claws. A quiver of nerves, a sigh, and the man is still.

Down the path of that woful gorge in a headlong rush comes the wolf-pack. A great figure with
lolling body looks up. Its broad head and short muzzle are poised alertly. So it stands, and
under its merciless fore paws is the mangled corpse of Nick Westley. It is a monstrous grizzly,
monstrous even for its kind. It turns from its victim with shambling but swiftly moving gait,
growling and snarling with terrible ferocity as it goes, but never hesitating. This shaggy
monarch is no coward, but he is cunning as any fox, and, unlike the mountain lion, knows the
limitation of his powers. He knows that even his gigantic strength could not long make stand
against the oncoming horde. What he leaves behind will check the fanged legions while he makes
good his escape.

The pack pours like a hideous flood over the spot where the last act of Nick Westley's tragedy
has been played out. A brief but fiendish tumult, and little remains to tell of the sorry drama.
The impassive mountains, unmoved spectators, give no sign. The stupendous reticence of the
wilderness, like the fall of a mighty curtain, closes over the scene, taking the story into
its inviolable keeping.

THE END.
