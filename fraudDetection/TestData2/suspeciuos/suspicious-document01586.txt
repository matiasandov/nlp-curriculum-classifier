Towards the end of March, 1800, five or six months after my entrance into the service of Madame.
Bonaparte, the First Consul while at dinner one day regarded me intently; and having carefully
scrutinized and measured me from head to foot, "Young man," said he, "would you like to go
with me on the campaign?"  I replied, with much emotion, that I would ask nothing better. 
"Very well, then, you shall go with me!" and on rising from the table, he ordered Pfister,
the steward, to place my name on the list of the persons of his household who would accompany
him.  My preparations did not require much time; for I was delighted with the idea of being
attached to the personal service of so great a man, and in imagination saw myself already beyond
the Alps.  But the First Consul set out without me.  Pfister, by a defect of memory, perhaps
intentional, had forgotten to place my name on the list.  I was in despair, and went to relate,
with tears, my misfortune to my excellent mistress, who was good enough to endeavor to console
me, saying, "Well, Constant, everything is not lost; you will stay with me.  You can hunt in
the park to pass the time; and perhaps the First Consul may yet send for you."  However, Madame
Bonaparte did not really believe this; for she thought, as I did, although out of kindness
she did not wish to say this to me, that the First Consul having changed his mind, and no longer
wishing my services on the campaign, had himself given the counter orders.  However, I soon
had proof to the contrary.  In passing through Dijon, on his way to Mt. St. Bernard, the First
Consul asked for me, and learning that they had forgotten me, expressed his dissatisfaction,
and directed Bourrienne to write immediately to Madame Bonaparte, requesting her to send me
on without delay.

One morning, when my chagrin was more acute than ever, Madame Bonaparte sent for me, and said,
holding Bourrienne's letter in her hand, "Constant, since you have determined to quit us to
make the campaign, you may rejoice, for you are now about to leave.  The First Consul has sent
for you.  Go to the office of Maret, and ascertain if he will not soon send a courier.  You
will accompany him."  I was inexpressibly delighted at this good news, and did not try to conceal
my pleasure.  "You are very well satisfied to leave us," said Madame Bonaparte with a kind
smile. "It is not leaving Madame, but joining the First Consul, which delights me."--"I hope
so," replied she.  "Go, Constant; and take good care of him."  If any incentive had been needed,
this injunction of my noble mistress would have added to the zeal and fidelity with which I
had determined to discharge my new duties.  I hurried without delay to the office of Maret,
secretary of state, who already knew me, and had shown his good-will for me.  "Get ready at
once," said he; "a courier will set out this evening or to-morrow morning."  I returned in
all haste to Malmaison, and announced to Madame Bonaparte my immediate departure.  She immediately
had a good post-chaise made ready for me, and Thibaut (for that was the name of the courier
I was to accompany) was directed to obtain horses for me along the route.  Maret gave me eight
hundred francs for the expenses of my trip, which sum, entirely unexpected by me, filled me
with wonder, for I had never been so rich.  At four o'clock in the morning, having heard from
Thibaut that everything was ready, I went to his house, where the post-chaise awaited me, and
we set out.

I traveled very comfortably, sometimes in the postchaise, sometimes on horseback; I taking
Thibaut's place, and he mine.  I expected to overtake the First Consul at Martigny; but his
traveling had been so rapid, that I caught up with him only at the convent of Mt. St. Bernard.
Upon our route we constantly passed regiments on the march, composed of officers and soldiers
who were hastening to rejoin their different corps.  Their enthusiasm was irrepressible,--those
who had made the campaign of Italy rejoiced at returning to so fine a country; those who had
not yet done so were burning with impatience to see the battlefields immortalized by French
valor, and by the genius of the hero who still marched at their head.  All went as if to a
festival, and singing songs they climbed the mountains of Valais.  It was eight o'clock in
the morning when I arrived at headquarters.  Pfister announced me; and I found the general-in-chief
in the great hall, in the basement of the Hospice.  He was taking breakfast, standing, with
his staff.  As soon as he saw me, he said, "Here you are, you queer fellow! why didn't you
come with me?"  I excused myself by saying that to my great regret I had received a counter
order, or, at least, they had left me behind at the moment of departure.  "Lose no time, my
friend; eat quickly; we are about to start."  From this moment I was attached to the personal
service of the First Consul, in the quality of ordinary valet; that is to say, in my turn.
This duty gave me little to do; Hambard, the head valet of the First Consul, being in the habit
of dressing him from head to foot.

Immediately after breakfast we began to descend the mountain, many sliding down on the snow,
very much as they coast at the garden Beaujon, from top to bottom of the Montagnes Russes,
and I followed their example. This they called "sledding."  The general-in-chief also descended
in this manner an almost perpendicular glacier.  His guide was a young countryman, active and
courageous, to whom the First Consul promised a sufficiency for the rest of his days.  Some
young soldiers who had wandered off into the snow were found, almost dead with cold, by the
dogs sent out by the monks, and carried to the Hospice, where they received every possible
attention, and their lives were saved.  The First Consul gave substantial proof of his gratitude
to the good fathers for a charity so useful and generous.  Before leaving the Hospice, where
he had found tables loaded with food already prepared awaiting the soldiers as soon as they
reached the summit of the mountain, he gave to the good monks a considerable sum of money,
in reward for the hospitality he and his companions in arms had received, and an order on the
treasury for an annuity in support of the convent.

The same day we climbed Mount Albaredo; but as this passage was impracticable for cavalry and
artillery, he ordered them to pass outside the town of Bard, under the batteries of the fort.
The First Consul had ordered that they should pass it at night, and on a gallop; and he had
straw tied around the wheels of the caissons and on the feet of the horses, but even these
precautions were not altogether sufficient to prevent the Austrians hearing our troops.  The
cannon of the fort rained grape-shot incessantly; but fortunately the houses of the town sheltered
our soldiers from the enemy's guns, and more than half the army passed without much loss. 
I was with the household of the First Consul, which under the care of General Gardanne flanked
the fort.

The 23d of May we forded a torrent which flowed between the town and the fort, with the First
Consul at our head, and then, followed by General Berthier and some other officers, took the
path over the Albaredo, which overlooked the fort and the town of Bard.  Directing his field-glass
towards the hostile batteries, from the fire of which he was protected only by a few bushes,
he criticised the dispositions which had been made by the officer in charge of the siege of
the fort, and ordered changes, which he said would cause the place to fall into our hands in
a short time.  Freed now from the anxiety which this fort had caused him, and which he said
had prevented his sleeping the two days he had passed in the convent of Maurice, he stretched
himself at the foot of a fir-tree and took a refreshing nap, while the army was making good
its passage. Rising from this brief interval of repose, he descended the mountain and continued
his march to Ivree, where we passed the night.

The brave General Lannes, who commanded the advance guard, acted somewhat in the capacity of
quartermaster, taking possession of all the places which barred the road.  Only a few hours
before we entered he had forced the passage of Ivree.

Such was this miraculous passage of St. Bernard.  Horses, cannon, caissons, and an immense
quantity of army stores of all kinds, everything, in fact, was drawn or carried over glaciers
which appeared inaccessible, and by paths which seemed impracticable even for a single man.
The Austrian cannon were not more successful than the snow in stopping the French army.  So
true is it that the genius and perseverance of the First Consul were communicated, so to speak,
to the humblest of his soldiers, and inspired them with a courage and a strength, the results
of which will appear fabulous to posterity.

On the 2d of June, which was the day after the passage of the Ticino, and the day of our entrance
into Milan, the First Consul learned that the fort of Bard had been taken the evening before,
showing that his dispositions had led to a quick result, and the road of communication by the
St. Bernard was now free from all obstructions.  The First Consul entered Milan without having
met much resistance, the whole population turned out on his entrance, and he was received with
a thousand acclamations.  The confidence of the Milanese redoubled when they learned that he
had promised the members of the assembled clergy to maintain the catholic worship and clergy
as already established, and had compelled them to take the oath of fidelity to the cisalpine
republic.

The First Consul remained several days in this capital; and I had time to form a more intimate
acquaintance with my colleagues, who were, as I have said, Hambard, Roustan, and Hebert.  We
relieved each other every twenty- four hours, at noon precisely.  As has always been my rule
when thrown into association with strangers, I observed, as closely as circumstances permitted,
the character and temper of my comrades, so that I could regulate my conduct in regard to them,
and know in advance what I might have to fear or hope from association with them.

Hambard had an unbounded devotion for the First Consul, whom he had followed to Egypt, but
unfortunately his temper was gloomy and misanthropic, which made him extremely sullen and disagreeable;
and the favor which Roustan enjoyed perhaps contributed to increase this gloomy disposition.
In a kind of mania he imagined himself to be the object of a special espionage; and when his
hours of service were over, he would shut himself up in his room, and pass in mournful solitude
the whole time he was not on duty.  The First Consul, when in good humor, would joke with him
upon this savage disposition, calling him Mademoiselle Hambard. "Ah, well, what were you doing
there in your room all by yourself? Doubtless you were reading some poor romances, or some
old books about princesses carried off and kept under guard by a barbarous giant."  To which
Hambard would sullenly reply, "General, you no doubt know better than I what I was doing,"
referring in this way to the spies by which he believed himself to be always surrounded.  Notwithstanding
this unfortunate disposition, the First Consul felt very kindly to him.  When the Emperor went
to camp at Boulogne, Hambard refused to accompany him; and the Emperor gave him, as a place
of retreat, the charge of the palace of Meudon.  There he showed unmistakable symptoms of insanity,
and his end was lamentable.  During the Hundred Days, after a conversation with the Emperor,
he threw himself against a carving-knife with such violence that the blade came out two inches
behind his back.  As it was believed at this time that I had incurred the anger of the Emperor,
the rumor went abroad that it was I who had committed suicide, and this tragic death was announced
in several papers as mine.

Hebert, ordinary valet, was a very agreeable young fellow, but very timid, and was, like all
the rest of the household, devotedly attached to the First Consul.  It happened one day in
Egypt that the latter, who had never been able to shave himself (it was I who taught him how
to shave himself, as I shall relate elsewhere at length), called Hebert to shave him, in the
absence of Hambard, who ordinarily discharged that duty.  As it had sometimes happened that
Hebert, on account of his great timidity, had cut his master's chin, on that day the latter,
who held a pair of scissors in his hand, when Hebert approached him, holding his razor, said,
"Take care, you scamp; if you cut me, I will stick my scissors into your stomach."  This threat,
made with an air of pretended seriousness, but which was in fact only a jest, such as I have
seen the Emperor indulge in a hundred times, produced such an impression on Hebert, that it
was impossible for him to finish his work.  He was seized with a convulsive trembling, the
razor fell from his hand, and the general-in- chief in vain bent his neck, and said to him
many times, laughing "Come, finish, you scamp."  Not only was Hebert unable to complete his
task that day, but from that time he had to renounce the duty of barber.  The Emperor did not
like this excessive timidity in the servants of his household; but this did not prevent him,
when he restored the castle of Rambouillet, from giving to Hebert the place of concierge which
he requested.

Roustan, so well known under the name of Mameluke, belonged to a good family of Georgia; carried
off at the age of six or seven, and taken to Cairo, he was there brought up among the young
slaves who attended upon the mamelukes, until he should be of sufficient age to enter this
warlike militia.  The Sheik of Cairo, in making a present to General Bonaparte of a magnificent
Arab horse, had given him at the same time Roustan and Ibrahim, another mameluke, who was afterwards
attached to the service of Madame Bonaparte, under the name of Ali.  It is well known that
Roustan became an indispensable accompaniment on all occasions when the Emperor appeared in
public.  He was with him in all his expeditions, in all processions, and, which was especially
to his honor, in all his battles. In the brilliant staff which followed the Emperor he shone
more than all others by the richness of his Oriental costume; and his appearance made a decided
impression, especially upon the common people and in the provinces.  He was believed to have
great influence with the Emperor; because, as credulous people said, Roustan had saved his
master's life by throwing himself between him and the saber of an enemy who was about to strike
him.  I think that this belief was unfounded, and that the especial favor he enjoyed was due
to the habitual kindness of his Majesty towards every one in his service.  Besides, this favor
affected in no wise his domestic relations; for when Roustan, who had married a young and pretty
French girl, a certain Mademoiselle Douville, whose father was valet to the Empress Josephine,
was reproached by certain journals in 1814 and 1815 with not having followed to the end of
his fortunes the man for whom he had always expressed such intense devotion, Roustan replied
that the family ties which he had formed prevented his leaving France, and that he could not
destroy the happiness of his own household.

Ibrahim took the name of Ali when he passed into the service of Madame Bonaparte.  He was of
more than Arabic ugliness, and had a wicked look. I recall in this connection a little incident
which took place at Malmaison, which will give an idea of his character.  One day, while playing
on the lawn of the chateau, I unintentionally threw him down while running; and furious at
his fall, he rose up, drew his poniard, which he always wore, and dashed after me to strike
me.  I laughed at first, like every one else, at the accident, and amused myself by making
him run; but warned by the cries of my comrades, and looking back to see how close he was,
I perceived at the same time his dagger and his rage. I stopped at once, and planted my foot,
with my eye fixed upon his poniard, and was fortunate enough to avoid his blow, which, however,
grazed my breast.  Furious in my turn, as may be imagined, I seized him by his flowing pantaloons,
and pitched him ten feet into the stream of Malmaison, which was barely two feet deep.  The
plunge brought him at once to his senses; and besides, his poniard had gone to the bottom,
which made him much less dangerous.  But in his disappointment he yelled so loudly that Madame
Bonaparte heard him; and as she had quite a fancy for her mameluke, I was sharply scolded.
However, this poor Ali was of such an unsocial temperament that he got into difficulties with
almost every one in the household, and at last was sent away to Fontainebleau, to take the
place of manservant there.

I now return to our campaign.  On the 13th of June the First Consul spent the night at Torre-di-Galifolo,
where he established his headquarters. From the day of our entry into Milan the advance of
the army had not slackened; General Murat had passed the Po, and taken possession of Piacenza;
and General Lannes, still pushing forward with his brave advance guard, had fought a bloody
battle at Montebello, a name which he afterwards rendered illustrious by bearing it.  The recent
arrival of General Desaix, who had just returned from Egypt, completed the joy of the general-in-chief,
and also added much to the confidence of the soldiers, by whom the good and modest Desaix was
adored.  The First Consul received him with the frankest and most cordial friendship, and they
remained together three consecutive hours in private conversation. At the end of this conference,
an order of the day announced to the army that General Desaix would take command of the division
Boudet.  I heard some persons in the suite of General Desaix say that his patience and evenness
of temper were rudely tried during his voyage, by contrary winds, forced delays, the ennui
of quarantine, and above all by the bad conduct of the English, who had kept him for some time
a prisoner in their fleet, in sight of the shores of France, although he bore a passport, signed
by the English authorities in Egypt, in consequence of the capitulation which had been mutually
agreed upon.  Consequently his resentment against them was very ardent; and he regretted much,
he said, that the enemy he was about to fight was not the English.

In spite of the simplicity of his tastes and habits, no one was more ambitious of glory than
this brave general.  All his rage against the English was caused by the fear that he might
not arrive in time to gather new laurels.  He did indeed arrive in time, but only to find a
glorious death, alas, so premature!

It was on the fourteenth that the celebrated battle of Marengo took place, which began early
in the morning, and lasted throughout the day. I remained at headquarters with all the household
of the First Consul, where we were almost within range of the cannon on the battlefield. Contradictory
news constantly came, one report declaring the battle completely lost, the next giving us the
victory.  At one time the increase in the number of our wounded, and the redoubled firing of
the Austrian cannon, made us believe that all was lost; and then suddenly came the news that
this apparent falling back was only a bold maneuver of the First Consul, and that a charge
of General Desaix had gained the battle.  But the victory was bought at a price dear to France
and to the heart of the First Consul.  Desaix, struck by a bullet, fell dead on the field;
and the grief of his soldiers serving only to exasperate their courage, they routed, by a bayonet
charge, the enemy, who were already shaken by the brilliant cavalry charge of General Kellermann.
The First Consul slept upon the field of battle, and notwithstanding the decisive victory that
he had gained, was very sad, and said that evening, in the presence of Hambard and myself,
many things which showed the profound grief he experienced in the death of General Desaix.
He said, "France has lost one of her bravest defenders, and I one of my best friends; no one
knew how much courage there was in the heart of Desaix, nor how much genius in his head." 
He thus solaced his grief by making to each and all a eulogy on the hero who had died on the
field of honor.

"My brave Desaix," he further said, "always wished to die thus;" and then added, almost with
tears in his eyes, "but ought death to have been so prompt to grant his wish?"

There was not a soldier in our victorious army who did not share so just a sorrow.  Rapp and
Savary, the aides-de-camp of Desaix, remained plunged in the most despairing grief beside the
body of their chief, whom they called their father, rather to express his unfailing kindness
to them than the dignity of his character.  Out of respect to the memory of his friend, the
general-in-chief, although his staff was full, added these two young officers in the quality
of aides-de-camp.

Commandant Rapp (for such only was his rank at that time) was then, as he has ever been, good,
full of courage, and universally beloved.  His frankness, which sometimes bordered on brusqueness,
pleased the Emperor; and I have many times heard him speak in praise of his aide-de-camp, whom
he always styled, "My brave Rapp."  Rapp was not lucky in battle, for he rarely escaped without
a wound.  While thus anticipating events, I will mention that in Russia, on the eve of the
battle of La Moskwa, the Emperor said, in my presence, to General Rapp, who had just arrived
from Dantzic, "See here, my brave fellow, we will beat them to-morrow, but take great care
of yourself.  You are not a favorite of fortune."--"That is," said the general, "the premium
to be paid on the business, but I shall none the less on that account do my best."

Savary manifested for the First Consul the same fervid zeal and unbounded devotion which had
attached him to General Desaix; and if he lacked any of the qualities of General Rapp, it was
certainly not bravery.  Of all the men who surrounded the Emperor, no one was more absolutely
devoted to his slightest wishes.  In the course of these memoirs, I shall doubtless have occasion
to recall instances of this unparalleled enthusiasm, for which the Duke de Rovigo I was magnificently
rewarded; but it is just to say that he did not bite the hand which rewarded him, and that
he gave to the end, and even after the end, of his old master (for thus he loved to style the
Emperor) an example of gratitude which has been imitated by few.

A government decree, in the month of June following, determined that the body of Desaix should
be carried to the Hospice of St. Bernard, and that a tomb should be erected on that spot, in
the country where he had covered himself with immortal glory, as a testimonial to the grief
of France, and especially that of the First Consul.

CHAPTER V.
