The writer of this once traveled for days with an intelligent curmudgeon, who made himself
at all points as prickly as the porcupine. He spoke of my pursuits and prospects in life with
interest and with feeling--of my little attempts in verse and prose with a knowledge that
he had read them carefully--offered to help me to such information as I should require, and even
mentioned a subject in which he thought I could appear to advantage. "If you try your hand
on a story," he observed, "I would advise you to prepare a kind of skeleton, and when you have
pleased yourself with the line of narrative, you may then leisurely clothe it with flesh and
blood." Why travel, then? We want the abnormal, the strong, the ugly, the unusual
at least. We wish to be startled and stirred up and repelled. And we ought to be more thankful
than we are that there are so many desolate and wearisome and fantastic places, and so many
tiresome and unattractive people in this lovely world.

GIVING AS A LUXURY

There must be something very good in human nature, or people would not experience so much pleasure
in giving; there must be something very bad in human nature, or more people would try the experiment
of giving. Those who do try it become enamored of it, and get their chief pleasure in life
out of it; and so evident is this that there is some basis for the idea that it is ignorance
rather than badness which keeps so many people from being generous. Of course it may become
a sort of dissipation, or more than that, a devastation, as many men who have what are called
"good wives" have reason to know, in the gradual disappearance of their wardrobe if they chance
to lay aside any of it temporarily. The amount that a good woman can give away is only measured
by her opportunity. I will beg, I will crawl through the world on my hands, but never more will I eat
the bread of crime!'

'Take her away, Pierre,' said one more ruffianly than the rest, 'or you may repent it.'

'Go, girl, go,' whispered Pierre faintly, while the wreckers moved in a body to the shore, where
the boats were about to strike.

'Never!' shrieked Madeleine, clinging franticly to her father's clothes.

'Let
me go!' cried Pierre, dragging her with him.

At that moment a terrible
event interrupted their struggle. A man stood upright in the foremost
boat, guiding their progress. Just as they were within two yards of
the shore, this man saw the wreckers coming down in a body.

'As I
expected!' he cried in a loud ringing voice. That substantially ministers to his self-esteem. He follows the
gift; he dwells upon the delight of the receiver; his imagination plays about it; it will never
wear out or become stale; having parted with it, it is for him a lasting possession. It is
an investment as lasting as that in the debt of England. Like a good deed, it grows, and is
continually satisfactory. It is something to think of when he first wakes in the morning--a
time when most people are badly put to it for want of something pleasant to think of. This
fact about giving is so incontestably true that it is a wonder that enlightened people do not
more freely indulge in giving for their own comfort. It is, above all else, amazing that so
many imagine they are going to get any satisfaction out of what they leave by will. They may
be in a state where they will enjoy it, if the will is not fought over; but it is shocking
how little gratitude there is accorded to a departed giver compared to a living giver. He couldn't
take the property with him, it is said; he was obliged to leave it to somebody. By this thought
his generosity is always reduced to a minimum. He may build a monument to himself in some institution,
but we do not know enough of the world to which he has gone to know whether a tiny monument
on this earth is any satisfaction to a person who is free of the universe. Whereas every giving
or deed of real humanity done while he was living would have entered into his character, and
would be of lasting service to him--that is, in any future which we can conceive.

Of course we are not confining our remarks to what are called Christmas gifts--commercially
so called--nor would we undertake to estimate the pleasure there is in either receiving or
giving these. SIR WALTER SCOTT.

(From the first of "Living Literary Characters," in the New Monthly Magazine.)

It would be superfluous to continue the list of his prose works: they are numerous; but they
are in all people's hands, and censure or praise would come equally
late. He has triumphed over every difficulty of subject, place, or
time--exhibited characters humble and high, cowardly and brave, selfish
and generous, vulgar and polished, and is at home in them all. If there are no "directions"
on the articles, his gratitude is somewhat tempered. He has seen these nondescripts of ingenuity
and expense in the shop windows, but he never expected to come into personal relations to them.
He is puzzled, and he cannot escape the unpleasant feeling that commerce has put its profit-making
fingers into Christmas. Such a lot of things seem to be manufactured on purpose that people
may perform a duty that is expected of them in the holidays. The house is full of these impossible
things; they occupy the mantelpieces, they stand about on the tottering little tables, they
are ingenious, they are made for wants yet undiscovered, they tarnish, they break, they will
not "work," and pretty soon they look "second-hand." Yet there must be more satisfaction in
giving these articles than in receiving them, and maybe a spice of malice--not that of course,
for in the holidays nearly every gift expresses at least kindly remembrance--but if you give
them you do not have to live with them. She is making desperate efforts to clear the point, but she won't
do it. She is ours, lads!'

'Give me the glass!' exclaimed Pierre rising. The other gave him the
telescope.

'Faith, a splendid brig!' said the patriarch with a sinister smile--'the finest windfall we have
had for many a season. Jean, you must out with the cow, or perhaps it may escape us.'

The cow was an abominable invention which Pierre had taught his comrades.
A cow was tied to a stake, and a huge ship's lantern fastened to its
horns. But this frittering away a good instinct and tendency in conventional giving of
manufactures made to suit an artificial condition is hardly in the line of developing the spirit
that shares the last crust or gives to the thirsty companion in the desert the first pull at
the canteen. Of course Christmas feeling is the life of trade and all that, and we will be
the last to discourage any sort of giving, for one can scarcely disencumber himself of anything
in his passage through this world and not be benefited; but the hint may not be thrown away
that one will personally get more satisfaction out of his periodic or continual benevolence
if he gives during his life the things which he wants and other people need, and reserves for
a fine show in his will a collected but not selected mass of holiday goods.
