IV.  He reaped the fruit of his noble qualities in abundance, being so much esteemed and beloved
by his friends, that Augustus (to say nothing of his other relations) being a long time in
doubt, whether he should not appoint him his successor, at last ordered Tiberius to adopt him.
He was so extremely popular, that many authors tell us, the crowds of those who went to meet
him upon his coming to any place, or to attend him at his departure, were so prodigious, that
he was sometimes in danger of his life; and that upon his return from Germany, after he had
quelled the mutiny in the army there, all the cohorts of the pretorian guards marched out to
meet him, notwithstanding the order that only two should go; and that all the people of Rome,
both men and women, of every age, sex, and rank, flocked as far as the twentieth milestone
to attend his entrance.

V.  At the time of his death, however, and afterwards, they displayed still greater and stronger
proofs of their extraordinary attachment to him.  The day on which he died, stones were thrown
at the temples, the altars of the gods demolished, the household gods, in some cases, thrown
into the streets, and new-born infants exposed.  It is even said that barbarous nations, both
those engaged in intestine wars, and those in hostilities against us, all agreed to a cessation
of arms, as if they had been mourning for some very near and common friend; that some petty
kings shaved their beards and their wives' heads, in token of their extreme sorrow; and that
the king of kings [383] forbore his exercise of hunting and feasting with his nobles, which,
amongst the Parthians, is equivalent to a cessation of all business in a time of public mourning
with us.

VI.  At Rome, upon the first news of his sickness, the city was thrown into great consternation
and grief, waiting impatiently for farther intelligence; when suddenly, in the evening, a report,
without any certain author, was spread, that he was recovered; upon which the people flocked
with torches (254) and victims to the Capitol, and were in such haste to pay the vows they
had made for his recovery, that they almost broke open the doors.  Tiberius was roused from
out of his sleep with the noise of the people congratulating one another, and singing about
the streets,

    Salva Roma, salva patria, salvus est Germanicus.
    Rome is safe, our country safe, for our Germanicus is safe.

But when certain intelligence of his death arrived, the mourning of the people could neither
be assuaged by consolation, nor restrained by edicts, and it continued during the holidays
in the month of December. The atrocities of the subsequent times contributed much to the glory
of Germanicus, and the endearment of his memory; all people supposing, and with reason, that
the fear and awe of him had laid a restraint upon the cruelty of Tiberius, which broke out
soon afterwards.

VII.  Germanicus married Agrippina, the daughter of Marcus Agrippa and Julia, by whom he had
nine children, two of whom died in their infancy, and another a few years after; a sprightly
boy, whose effigy, in the character of a Cupid, Livia set up in the temple of Venus in the
Capitol. Augustus also placed another statue of him in his bed-chamber, and used to kiss it
as often as he entered the apartment.  The rest survived their father; three daughters, Agrippina,
Drusilla, and Livilla, who were born in three successive years; and as many sons, Nero, Drusus,
and Caius Caesar.  Nero and Drusus, at the accusation of Tiberius, were declared public enemies.

VIII.  Caius Caesar was born on the day before the calends [31st August] of September, at the
time his father and Caius Fonteius Capito were consuls [384].  But where he was born, is rendered
uncertain from the number of places which are said to have given him birth.  Cneius Lentulus
Gaetulicus [385] says that he was born at Tibur; Pliny the younger, in the country of the Treviri,
at a village called Ambiatinus, above Confluentes [386]; and he alleges, as a proof of it,
that altars are there shown with this inscription: "For Agrippina's child-birth."  Some verses
which were published in his reign, intimate that he was born in the winter quarters of the legions,

    In castris natus, patriis nutritius in armis,
      Jam designati principis omen erat.

    Born in the camp, and train'd in every toil
    Which taught his sire the haughtiest foes to foil;
    Destin'd he seem'd by fate to raise his name,
    And rule the empire with Augustan fame.

I find in the public registers that he was born at Antium.  Pliny charges Gaetulicus as guilty
of an arrant forgery, merely to soothe the vanity of a conceited young prince, by giving him
the lustre of being born in a city sacred to Hercules; and says that he advanced this false
assertion with the more assurance, because, the year before the birth of Caius, Germanicus
had a son of the same name born at Tibur; concerning whose amiable childhood and premature
death I have already spoken [387].  Dates clearly prove that Pliny is mistaken; for the writers
of Augustus's history all agree, that Germanicus, at the expiration of his consulship, was
sent into Gaul, after the birth of Caius.  Nor will the inscription upon the altar serve to
establish Pliny's opinion; because Agrippina was delivered of two daughters in that country,
and any child-birth, without regard to sex, is called puerperium, as the ancients were used
to call girls puerae, and boys puelli.  There is also extant a letter written by Augustus,
a few months before his death, to his granddaughter Agrippina, about the same Caius (for there
was then no other child of hers living under that name).  He writes as follows: "I gave orders
yesterday for Talarius and Asellius to set out on their journey towards you, if the gods permit,
with your child Caius, upon the fifteenth of the calends of June [18th May].  I also send with
him a physician of mine, and I wrote to Germanicus that he may retain him if he pleases.  Farewell,
my dear Agrippina, and take what care you can to (256) come safe and well to your Germanicus."
I imagine it is sufficiently evident that Caius could not be born at a place to which he was
carried from The City when almost two years old.  The same considerations must likewise invalidate
the evidence of the verses, and the rather, because the author is unknown.  The only authority,
therefore, upon which we can depend in this matter, is that of the acts, and the public register;
especially as he always preferred Antium to every other place of retirement, and entertained
for it all that fondness which is commonly attached to one's native soil.  It is said, too,
that, upon his growing weary of the city, he designed to have transferred thither the seat
of empire.

IX.  It was to the jokes of the soldiers in the camp that he owed the name of Caligula [388],
he having been brought up among them in the dress of a common soldier.  How much his education
amongst them recommended him to their favour and affection, was sufficiently apparent in the
mutiny upon the death of Augustus, when the mere sight of him appeased their fury, though it
had risen to a great height.  For they persisted in it, until they observed that he was sent
away to a neighbouring city [389], to secure him against all danger. "Did Davy never see a mischievous
boy fidgeting at prayers?" asked the Doctor, who was nearer than she thought. "If so, he has
been luckier than I have been."

There was a laugh, out of deference to the clergyman, but the old woman held to her point. "Begging
your Reverence's pardon, sir, there be more in this than we knows. They says up at Oakwood, there's
no peace in the place for the spite of him, and when they thinks he is safe locked into his chamber,
there he be a-clogging of the spit, or changing sugar into pepper, or making the stool break
down under one. Oh, he be a strange one, sir, or summat worse. I have heerd him myself hollaing
'Ho! ho! ho!' on the downs enough to make one's flesh creep."

"I
will tell you what he is, dame," said the Doctor gravely.  While he remained in that
island, many insidious artifices were practised, to extort from him complaints against Tiberius,
but by his circumspection he avoided falling into the snare [390].  He affected to take no
more notice of the ill-treatment of his relations, than if nothing had befallen them.  With
regard to his own sufferings, he seemed utterly insensible of them, and behaved with such obsequiousness
to his grandfather [391] and all about him, that it was justly said of him, "There never was
a better servant, nor a worse master."

XI.  But he could not even then conceal his natural disposition to cruelty and lewdness.  He
delighted in witnessing the infliction of punishments, and frequented taverns and bawdy-houses
in the night-time, disguised in a periwig and a long coat; and was passionately addicted to
the theatrical arts of singing and dancing.  All these levities Tiberius readily connived at,
in hopes that they might perhaps correct the roughness of his temper, which the sagacious old
man so well understood, that he often said, "That Caius was destined to be the ruin of himself
and all mankind; and that he was rearing a hydra [392] for the people of Rome, and a Phaeton
for all the world." [393]

XII.  Not long afterwards, he married Junia Claudilla, the daughter of Marcus Silanus, a man
of the highest rank.  Being then chosen augur in the room of his brother Drusus, before he
could be inaugurated he was advanced to the pontificate, with no small commendation of his
dutiful behaviour, and great capacity.  The situation of the court likewise was at this time
favourable to his fortunes, as it was now left destitute of support, Sejanus being suspected,
and soon afterwards taken off; and he was by degrees flattered with the hope of succeeding
Tiberius in the empire.  In order more effectually to secure this object, upon Junia's dying
in child-bed, he engaged in a criminal commerce with Ennia Naevia, the wife (258) of Macro,
at that time prefect of the pretorian cohorts; promising to marry her if he became emperor,
to which he bound himself, not only by an oath, but by a written obligation under his hand.
Having by her means insinuated himself into Macro's favour, some are of opinion that he attempted
to poison Tiberius, and ordered his ring to be taken from him, before the breath was out of
his body; and that, because he seemed to hold it fast, he caused a pillow to be thrown upon
him [394], squeezing him by the throat, at the same time, with his own hand.  One of his freedmen
crying out at this horrid barbarity, he was immediately crucified.  These circumstances are
far from being improbable, as some authors relate that, afterwards, though he did not acknowledge
his having a hand in the death of Tiberius, yet he frankly declared that he had formerly entertained
such a design; and as a proof of his affection for his relations, he would frequently boast,
"That, to revenge the death of his mother and brothers, he had entered the chamber of Tiberius,
when he was asleep, with a poniard, but being seized with a fit of compassion, threw it away,
and retired; and that Tiberius, though aware of his intention, durst not make any inquiries,
or attempt revenge."

XIII.  Having thus secured the imperial power, he fulfilled by his elevation the wish of the
Roman people, I may venture to say, of all mankind; for he had long been the object of expectation
and desire to the greater part of the provincials and soldiers, who had known him when a child;
and to the whole people of Rome, from their affection for the memory of Germanicus, his father,
and compassion for the family almost entirely destroyed.  Upon his moving from Misenum, therefore,
although he was in mourning, and following the corpse of Tiberius, he had to walk amidst altars,
victims, and lighted torches, with prodigious crowds of people everywhere attending him, in
transports of joy, and calling him, besides other auspicious names, by those of "their star,"
"their chick," "their pretty puppet," and "bantling."

XIV.  Immediately on his entering the city, by the joint acclamations of the senate, and people,
who broke into the senate-house, Tiberius's will was set aside, it having left his (259) other
grandson [395], then a minor, coheir with him, the whole government and administration of affairs
was placed in his hands; so much to the joy and satisfaction of the public, that, in less than
three months after, above a hundred and sixty thousand victims are said to have been offered
in sacrifice.  Upon his going, a few days afterwards, to the nearest islands on the coast of
Campania [396], vows were made for his safe return; every person emulously testifying their
care and concern for his safety.  And when he fell ill, the people hung about the Palatium
all night long; some vowed, in public handbills, to risk their lives in the combats of the
amphitheatre, and others to lay them down, for his recovery.  To this extraordinary love entertained
for him by his countrymen, was added an uncommon regard by foreign nations.  Even Artabanus,
king of the Parthians, who had always manifested hatred and contempt for Tiberius, solicited
his friendship; came to hold a conference with his consular lieutenant, and passing the Euphrates,
paid the highest honours to the eagles, the Roman standards, and the images of the Caesars. [397]

XV.  Caligula himself inflamed this devotion, by practising all the arts of popularity.  After
he had delivered, with floods of tears, a speech in praise of Tiberius, and buried him with
the utmost pomp, he immediately hastened over to Pandataria and the Pontian islands [398],
to bring thence the ashes of his mother and brother; and, to testify the great regard he had
for their memory, he performed the voyage in a very tempestuous season.  He approached their
remains with profound veneration, and deposited them in the urns with his own hands.  Having
brought them in grand solemnity to Ostia [399], with an ensign flying in the stern of the galley,
and thence up the Tiber to Rome, they were borne by persons of the first distinction in the
equestrian order, on two biers, into the mausoleum [400], (260) at noon-day.  He appointed
yearly offerings to be solemnly and publicly celebrated to their memory, besides Circensian
games to that of his mother, and a chariot with her image to be included in the procession
[401].  The month of September he called Germanicus, in honour of his father.  By a single
decree of the senate, he heaped upon his grandmother, Antonia, all the honours which had been
ever conferred on the empress Livia.  His uncle, Claudius, who till then continued in the equestrian
order, he took for his colleague in the consulship.  He adopted his brother, Tiberius [402],
on the day he took upon him the manly habit, and conferred upon him the title of "Prince of
the Youths."  As for his sisters, he ordered these words to be added to the oaths of allegiance
to himself: "Nor will I hold myself or my own children more dear than I do Caius and his sisters:"
[403] and commanded all resolutions proposed by the consuls in the senate to be prefaced thus:
"May what we are going to do, prove fortunate and happy to Caius Caesar and his sisters." 
With the like popularity he restored all those who had been condemned and banished, and granted
an act of indemnity against all impeachments and past offences.  To relieve the informers and
witnesses against his mother and brothers from all apprehension, he brought the records of
their trials into the forum, and there burnt them, calling loudly on the gods to witness that
he had not read or handled them.  A memorial which was offered him relative to his own security,
he would not receive, declaring, "that he had done nothing to make any one his enemy:" and
said, at the same time, "he had no ears for informers."

XVI.  The Spintriae, those panderers to unnatural lusts [404], he banished from the city, being
prevailed upon not to throw them (261) into the sea, as he had intended.  The writings of Titus
Labienus, Cordus Cremutius, and Cassius Severus, which had been suppressed by an act of the
senate, he permitted to be drawn from obscurity, and universally read; observing, "that it
would be for his own advantage to have the transactions of former times delivered to posterity."
He published accounts of the proceedings of the government--a practice which had been introduced
by Augustus, but discontinued by Tiberius [405].  He granted the magistrates a full and free
jurisdiction, without any appeal to himself.  He made a very strict and exact review of the
Roman knights, but conducted it with moderation; publicly depriving of his horse every knight
who lay under the stigma of any thing base and dishonourable; but passing over the names of
those knights who were only guilty of venial faults, in calling over the list of the order.
To lighten the labours of the judges, he added a fifth class to the former four.  He attempted
likewise to restore to the people their ancient right of voting in the choice of magistrates
[406].  He paid very honourably, and without any dispute, the legacies left by Tiberius in
his will, though it had been set aside; as likewise those left by the will of Livia Augusta,
which Tiberius had annulled.  He remitted the hundredth penny, due to the government in all
auctions throughout Italy.  He made up to many their losses sustained by fire; and when he
restored their kingdoms to any princes, he likewise allowed them all the arrears of the taxes
and revenues which had accrued in the interval; as in the case of Antiochus of Comagene, where
the confiscation would have amounted to a hundred millions of sesterces.  To prove to the world
that he was ready to encourage good examples of every kind, he gave to a freed-woman eighty
thousand sesterces, for not discovering a crime committed by her patron, though she had been
put to exquisite torture for that purpose.  For all these acts of beneficence, amongst other
honours, a golden shield was decreed to him, which the colleges of priests were to carry annually,
upon a fixed day, into the Capitol, with the senate attending, and the youth of the nobility,
of both sexes, celebrating the praise of his virtues in (262) songs.  It was likewise ordained,
that the day on which he succeeded to the empire should be called Palilia, in token of the
city's being at that time, as it were, new founded. [407]

XVII.  He held the consulship four times; the first [408], from the calends [the first] of
July for two months: the second [409], from the calends of January for thirty days; the third
[410], until the ides [the 13th] of January; and the fourth [411], until the seventh of the
same ides [7th January].  Of these, the two last he held successively.  The third he assumed
by his sole authority at Lyons; not, as some are of opinion, from arrogance or neglect of rules;
but because, at that distance, it was impossible for him to know that his colleague had died
a little before the beginning of the new year.  He twice distributed to the people a bounty
of three hundred sesterces a man, and as often gave a splendid feast to the senate and the
equestrian order, with their wives and children.  In the latter, he presented to the men forensic
garments, and to the women and children purple scarfs.  To make a perpetual addition to the
public joy for ever, he added to the Saturnalia [412] one day, which he called Juvenalis [the
juvenile feast].

XVIII.  He exhibited some combats of gladiators, either in the amphitheatre of Taurus [413],
or in the Septa, with which he intermingled troops of the best pugilists from Campania and
Africa.  He did not always preside in person upon those occasions, but sometimes gave a commission
to magistrates or friends to supply his place.  He frequently entertained the people with stage-plays
(263) of various kinds, and in several parts of the city, and sometimes by night, when he caused
the whole city to be lighted.  He likewise gave various things to be scrambled for among the
people, and distributed to every man a basket of bread with other victuals.  Upon this occasion,
he sent his own share to a Roman knight, who was seated opposite to him, and was enjoying himself
by eating heartily.  To a senator, who was doing the same, he sent an appointment of praetor-extraordinary.
He likewise exhibited a great number of Circensian games from morning until night; intermixed
with the hunting of wild beasts from Africa, or the Trojan exhibition.  Some of these games
were celebrated with peculiar circumstances; the Circus being overspread with vermilion and
chrysolite; and none drove in the chariot races who were not of the senatorian order.  For
some of these he suddenly gave the signal, when, upon his viewing from the Gelotiana [414]
the preparations in the Circus, he was asked to do so by a few persons in the neighbouring
galleries.

XIX.  He invented besides a new kind of spectacle, such as had never been heard of before.
For he made a bridge, of about three miles and a half in length, from Baiae to the mole of
Puteoli [415], collecting trading vessels from all quarters, mooring them in two rows by their
anchors, and spreading earth upon them to form a viaduct, after the fashion of the Appian Way
[416].  This bridge he crossed and recrossed for two days together; the first day mounted on
a horse richly caparisoned, wearing on his head a crown of oak leaves, armed with a battle-axe,
a Spanish buckler and a sword, and in a cloak made of cloth of gold; the day following, in
the habit of a charioteer, standing in a chariot, drawn by two high-bred horses, having with
him a young boy, Darius by name, one of the Parthian hostages, with a cohort of the pretorian
guards attending him, and a (264) party of his friends in cars of Gaulish make [417]. Over their
next day's game Mrs. Woodford left them, and Anne became at ease since Peregrine never attempted
any tricks. She taught him to play at draughts, the elders thinking it expedient not to doubt
whether such vanities were permissible at Oakwood.

Soon there was such merriment between them that the kind Doctor said
it did his heart good to hear the boy's hearty natural laugh in lieu
of the "Ho! ho! ho!" of malice or derision.

They were odd conversations
that used to take place between that boy and girl.  But for myself, when I was a boy, I heard my grandfather say
[418], that the reason assigned by some courtiers who were in habits of the greatest intimacy
with him, was this; when Tiberius was in some anxiety about the nomination of a successor,
and rather inclined to pitch upon his grandson, Thrasyllus the astrologer had assured him,
"That Caius would no more be emperor, than he would ride on horseback across the gulf of Baiae."

XX.  He likewise exhibited public diversions in Sicily, Grecian games at Syracuse, and Attic
plays at Lyons in Gaul besides a contest for pre-eminence in the Grecian and Roman eloquence;
in which we are told that such as were baffled bestowed rewards upon the best performers, and
were obliged to compose speeches in their praise: but that those who performed the worst, were
forced to blot out what they had written with a sponge or their tongue, unless they preferred
to be beaten with a rod, or plunged over head and ears into the nearest river.

XXI.  He completed the works which were left unfinished by Tiberius, namely, the temple of
Augustus, and the theatre (265) of Pompey [419]. He began, likewise, the aqueduct from the
neighbourhood of Tibur [420], and an amphitheatre near the Septa [421]; of which works, one
was completed by his successor Claudius, and the other remained as he left it.  The walls of
Syracuse, which had fallen to decay by length of time, he repaired, as he likewise did the
temples of the gods.  He formed plans for rebuilding the palace of Polycrates at Samos, finishing
the temple of the Didymaean Apollo at Miletus, and building a town on a ridge of the Alps;
but, above all, for cutting through the isthmus in Achaia [422]; and even sent a centurion
of the first rank to measure out the work.

XXII.  Thus far we have spoken of him as a prince.  What remains to be said of him, bespeaks
him rather a monster than a man.  He assumed a variety of titles, such as "Dutiful," "The (266)
Pious," "The Child of the Camp, the Father of the Armies," and "The Greatest and Best Caesar."
Upon hearing some kings, who came to the city to pay him court, conversing together at supper,
about their illustrious descent, he exclaimed,

    Eis koiranos eto, eis basileus.
    Let there be but one prince, one king.

He was strongly inclined to assume the diadem, and change the form of government, from imperial
to regal; but being told that he far exceeded the grandeur of kings and princes, he began to
arrogate to himself a divine majesty.  He ordered all the images of the gods, which were famous
either for their beauty, or the veneration paid them, among which was that of Jupiter Olympius,
to be brought from Greece, that he might take the heads off, and put on his own.  Having continued
part of the Palatium as far as the Forum, and the temple of Castor and Pollux being converted
into a kind of vestibule to his house, he often stationed himself between the twin brothers,
and so presented himself to be worshipped by all votaries; some of whom saluted him by the
name of Jupiter Latialis.  He also instituted a temple and priests, with choicest victims,
in honour of his own divinity.  In his temple stood a statue of gold, the exact image of himself,
which was daily dressed in garments corresponding with those he wore himself.  The most opulent
persons in the city offered themselves as candidates for the honour of being his priests, and
purchased it successively at an immense price.  The victims were flamingos, peacocks, bustards,
guinea-fowls, turkey and pheasant hens, each sacrificed on their respective days.  On nights
when the moon was full, he was in the constant habit of inviting her to his embraces and his
bed.  In the day-time he talked in private to Jupiter Capitolinus; one while whispering to
him, and another turning his ear to him: sometimes he spoke aloud, and in railing language.
For he was overheard to threaten the god thus:

    Hae em' anaeir', hae ego se; [423]
    Raise thou me up, or I'll--

(267) until being at last prevailed upon by the entreaties of the god, as he said, to take
up his abode with him, he built a bridge over the temple of the Deified Augustus, by which
he joined the Palatium to the Capitol. Afterwards, that he might be still nearer, he laid the
foundations of a new palace in the very court of the Capitol.
