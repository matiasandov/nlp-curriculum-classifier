Willersley set himself to draw a sociological moral. "I'm not so sure," he said in a voice
of intense discriminations, "after all, that agricultural work isn't good for women."

"Damn agricultural work!" I said, and broke out into a vigorous cursing of all I held dear.
"Fettered things we are!" I cried. "I wonder why I stand it!"

"Stand what?"

"Why don't I go back and make love to those girls and let the world and you and everything
go hang? Deep breasts and rounded limbs--and we poor emasculated devils go tramping by with
the blood of youth in us!..."

"I'm not quite sure, Remington," said Willersley, looking at me with a deliberately quaint
expression over his glasses, "that picturesque scenery is altogether good for your morals."

That fever was still in my blood when we came to Locarno.

Along the hot and dusty lower road between the Orrido of Traffiume and Cannobio Willersley
had developed his first blister. And partly because of that and partly because there was a
bag at the station that gave us the refreshment of clean linen and partly because of the lazy
lower air into which we had come, we decided upon three or four days' sojourn in the Empress Hotel.

We dined that night at a table-d'hote, and I found myself next to an Englishwoman who began
a conversation that was resumed presently in the hotel lounge. She was a woman of perhaps thirty-three
or thirty-four, slenderly built, with a warm reddish skin and very abundant fair golden hair,
the wife of a petulant-looking heavy-faced man of perhaps fifty-three, who smoked a cigar and
dozed over his coffee and presently went to bed. "He always goes to bed like that," she confided
startlingly. "He sleeps after all his meals. I never knew such a man to sleep."

Then she returned to our talk, whatever it was.

We had begun at the dinner table with itineraries and the usual topographical talk, and she
had envied our pedestrian travel. "My husband doesn't walk," she said. "His heart is weak and
he cannot manage the hills."

There was something friendly and adventurous in her manner; she conveyed she liked me, and
when presently Willersley drifted off to write letters our talk sank at once to easy confidential
undertones. I felt enterprising, and indeed it is easy to be daring with people one has never
seen before and may never see again. I said I loved beautiful scenery and all beautiful things,
and the pointing note in my voice made her laugh. She told me I had bold eyes, and so far as
I can remember I said she made them bold. "Blue they are," she remarked, smiling archly. "I
like blue eyes." Then I think we compared ages, and she said she was the Woman of Thirty, "George
Moore's Woman of Thirty."

I had not read George Moore at the time, but I pretended to understand.

That, I think, was our limit that evening. She went to bed, smiling good-night quite prettily
down the big staircase, and I and Willersley went out to smoke in the garden. My head was full
of her, and I found it necessary to talk about her. So I made her a problem in sociology. "Who
the deuce are these people?" I said, "and how do they get a living? They seem to have plenty
of money. He strikes me as being--Willersley, what is a drysalter? I think he's a retired drysalter."

Willersley theorised while I thought of the woman and that provocative quality of dash she
had displayed. The next day at lunch she and I met like old friends. A huge mass of private
thinking during the interval had been added to our effect upon one another. We talked for a
time of insignificant things.

"What do you do," she asked rather quickly, "after lunch? Take a siesta?"

"Sometimes," I said, and hung for a moment eye to eye. 

And they were the same for each day: the same sand-bars, the same hulk of unwieldy steamer
wedged into the same curves, like a corpulent dame in a jammed throng.

So, at each moment, the good man had to stop, to back up, to go forward
at half speed, sending--now to port, now to starboard--the five sailors
equipped with long bamboo poles to give force to the turn the rudder
had suggested.

He was like a veteran who, after leading men through hazardous campaigns,
had in his age become the tutor of a capricious, disobedient, and
lazy boy.

 She said she would lend it to me and hesitated.

Willersley wanted to go for an expedition across the lake that afternoon, but I refused. He
made some other proposals that I rejected abruptly. "I shall write in my room," I said.

"Why not write down here?"

"I shall write in my room," I snarled like a thwarted animal, and he looked at me curiously.
"Very well," he said; "then I'll make some notes and think about that order of ours out under
the magnolias."

I hovered about the lounge for a time buying postcards and feverishly restless, watching the
movements of the other people. Finally I went up to my room and sat down by the windows, staring
out. There came a little tap at the unlocked door and in an instant, like the go of a taut
bowstring, I was up and had it open.

"Here is that book," she said, and we hesitated.

"COME IN!" I whispered, trembling from head to foot.

"You're just a boy," she said in a low tone.

I did not feel a bit like a lover, I felt like a burglar with the safe-door nearly opened.
"Come in," I said almost impatiently, for anyone might be in the passage, and I gripped her
wrist and drew her towards me.

"What do you mean?" she answered with a faint smile on her lips, and awkward and yielding.

I shut the door behind her, still holding her with one hand, then turned upon her--she was
laughing nervously--and without a word drew her to me and kissed her. And I remember that as
I kissed her she made a little noise almost like the purring miaow with which a cat will greet
one and her face, close to mine, became solemn and tender.

She was suddenly a different being from the discontented wife who had tapped a moment since
on my door, a woman transfigured....

That evening I came down to dinner a monster of pride, for behold! I was a man. I felt myself
the most wonderful and unprecedented of adventurers. It was hard to believe that any one in
the world before had done as much. My mistress and I met smiling, we carried things off admirably,
and it seemed to me that Willersley was the dullest old dog in the world. I wanted to give
him advice. I wanted to give him derisive pokes. After dinner and coffee in the lounge I was
too excited and hilarious to go to bed, I made him come with me down to the cafe under the
arches by the pier, and there drank beer and talked extravagant nonsense about everything under
the sun, in order not to talk about the happenings of the afternoon. All the time something
shouted within me: "I am a man! I am a man!"...

"What shall we do to-morrow?" said he.

"I'm for loafing," I said. "Let's row in the morning and spend to-morrow afternoon just as
we did to-day."

"They say the church behind the town is worth seeing."

"We'll go up about sunset; that's the best time for it. We can start about five."

We heard music, and went further along the arcade to discover a place where girls in operatic
Swiss peasant costume were singing and dancing on a creaking, protesting little stage. I eyed
their generous display of pink neck and arm with the seasoned eye of a man who has lived in
the world. Life was perfectly simple and easy, I felt, if one took it the right way.
