"Just the same as regards the estate."

"Then why has he gone away?"

"I cannot answer for him. I can only tell you what I shall do. I dare say it may take months
before it is all settled. But now, Desmond, you know how I stand; I am Owen Fitzgerald of Hap
House, now as I have ever been, that and nothing more,--for as to the handle to my name it
is not worth talking about."

They were still sitting at the table, and now they both sat silent, not looking at each other,
but with their eyes fixed on the wood. Owen had in his hand a pen, which he had taken from
the mantelpiece, and unconsciously began to trace signs on the polished surface before him.
The earl sat with his forehead leaning on his two hands, thinking what he was to say next.
He felt that he himself loved the man better than ever; but when his mother should come to
hear all this, what would she say?

"You know it all now, my boy," said Owen, looking up at last; and as he did so there was an
expression about his face to which the young earl thought that he had never seen the like.
There was a gleam in his eye which, though not of joy, was so bright; and a smile round his
mouth which was so sweet, though full of sadness! "How can she not love him?" said he to himself,
thinking of his sister. "And now, Desmond, go back to your mother and tell her all. She has
sent you here."

"No, she did not send me," said the boy, stoutly,--almost angrily; "she does not even know
that I have come."

"Go back then to your sister."

"Nor does she know it."

"Nevertheless, go back to them, and tell them both what I have told you; and tell them this
also, that I, Owen Fitzgerald of Hap House, still love her better than all that the world else
can give me; indeed, there is nothing else that I do love,--except you, Desmond. But tell them
also that I am Owen of Hap House still--that and nothing more."

"Owen," said the lad, looking up at him; and Fitzgerald as he glanced into the boy's face could
see that there was that arising within his breast which almost prevented him from speaking.

"And look, Desmond," continued Fitzgerald; "do not think that I shall blame you because you
turn from me, or call you mercenary. Do you do what you think right. What you said just now
of your sister's--, well, of the possibility of our marriage, you said under the idea that
I was a rich man. You now find that I am a poor man; and you may consider that the words were
never spoken."

"Owen!" said the boy again; and now that which was before rising in his breast had risen to
his brow and cheeks, and was telling its tale plainly in his eyes. 18) the ark is ignored in the
history of Saul. But in this place the Septuagint reads "ephod" for ark, while in 1 Chronicles
xiii. 3 David says that "we sought not unto it [the ark] in the days
of Saul."

Nor does Samuel seem to have paid any regard to the ark after its return from Philistia; though,
in his childhood, he is said to have slept in "the temple of Jahveh,
where the ark of Elohim was"

(1 Sam. iii. 3), at Shiloh and there to have been the seer of the earliest apparitions vouchsafed
to him by Jahveh.

The space between the cherubim or winged images on the canopy or cover (Kapporeth) of this holy
chest was held to be the special seat of Jahveh--the place selected
for a temporary residence of the Supreme Elohim who had, after Aaron
and Phineas, Eli and his sons for priests and seers.

And, when the ark was carried to the camp at Eben-ezer, there can be no doubt that the Israelites,
no less than the Philistines, held that "Elohim is come into the camp" (iv. 7), and that the
one, as much as the other, conceived that the Israelites had summoned to their aid a powerful
ally in "these (or this) mighty Elohim"--elsewhere called Jahve-Sabaoth, the Jahveh of Hosts.
If the "temple" at Shiloh was the pentateuchal tabernacle, as is
suggested by the name of "tent of meeting" given to it in 1 Samuel ii.

22, it was essentially a large tent, though constituted of very expensive and ornate materials;
if, on the other hand, it was a different edifice, there can be little doubt that this "house
of Jahveh" was built on the model of an ordinary house of the time.

But there is not the slightest evidence that, during the reign of
Saul, any greater importance attached to this seat of the cult of
Jahveh than to others.

Sanctuaries, and "high places" for sacrifice, were scattered all over the country from Dan to
Beersheba.

And, as Samuel is said to have gone up to one of these high places to bless the sacrifice, it may
be taken for tolerably certain that he knew nothing of the Levitical laws which severely condemn
the high places and those who sacrifice away from the sanctuary hallowed by the presence of the
ark.

There is no evidence that, during the time of the Judges and of Samuel,
any one occupied the position of the high priest of later days.

 To those who had hitherto spoken
to him upon the subject, to Mr. Prendergast, Mr. Somers, and his cousin, he had disclaimed
the inheritance, and that he had thought would have sufficed. That Sir Thomas should die so
quickly after the discovery had not of course been expected by anybody; and much, therefore,
had not been thought at the moment of these disclaimers;--neither at the moment, nor indeed
afterwards, when Sir Thomas did die.

Even Mr. Somers was prepared to admit that as the game had been given up,--as his branch of
the Fitzgeralds, acting under the advice of their friend and lawyer, admitted that the property
must go from them--even he, much as he contested within his own breast the propriety of Mr.
Prendergast's decisions, was fain to admit now that it was Owen's business to walk in upon
the property. Any words which he may have spoken on the impulse of the moment were empty words.
When a man becomes heir to twelve thousand a year, he does not give it up in a freak of benevolence.
And, therefore, when Sir Thomas had been dead some four or five weeks, and when Herbert had
gone away from the scene which was no longer one of interest to him, it was necessary that
something should be done.

During the last two or three days of his life Sir Thomas had executed a new will, in which
he admitted that his son was not the heir to his estates, and so disposed of such moneys as
it was in his power to leave as he would have done had Herbert been a younger son. Early in
his life he himself had added something to the property, some two or three hundred a year,
and this, also, he left of course to his own family. Such having been done, there would have
been no opposition made to Owen had he immediately claimed the inheritance; but as he made
no claim, and took no step whatever,--as he appeared neither by himself, nor by letter, nor
by lawyer, nor by agent,--as no rumour ever got about as to what he intended to do, Mr. Somers
found it necessary to write to him. This he did on the day of Herbert's departure, merely asking
him, perhaps with scant courtesy, who was his man of business, in order that he, Mr. Somers,
as agent to the late proprietor, might confer with him. With but scant courtesy,--for Mr. Somers
had made one visit to Hap House since the news had been known, with some intention of ingratiating
himself with the future heir; but his tenders had not been graciously received. Mr. Somers
was a proud man, and though his position in life depended on the income he received from the
Castle Richmond estate, he would not make any further overture. So his letter was somewhat
of the shortest, and merely contained the request above named.

Owen's reply was sharp, immediate, and equally short, and was carried back by the messenger
from Castle Richmond who had brought the letter, to which it was an answer. It was as follows:--

"Hap House, Thursday morning, two o'clock."

(There was no other date; and Owen probably was unaware that his letter being written at two
P.M. was not written on Thursday morning.)

"DEAR SIR,

"I have got no lawyer, and no man of business; nor do I mean to employ any if I can help it.
I intend to make no claim to Mr. Herbert Fitzgerald's property of Castle Richmond; and if it
be necessary that I should sign any legal document making over to him any claim that I may
have, I am prepared to do so at any moment. As he has got a lawyer, he can get this arranged,
and I suppose Mr. Prendergast had better do it.

"I am, dear sir,

"Your faithful servant,

"OWEN FITZGERALD of Hap House."

And with those four or five lines he thought it would be practicable for him to close the whole
affair.

This happened on the day of Herbert's departure, and on the day preceding Lord Desmond's visit
to Hap House; so that on the occasion of that visit, Owen looked upon the deed as fully done.
He had put it quite beyond his own power to recede now, even had he so wished. And then came
the tidings to him,--true tidings as he thought,--that Clara was still within his reach if
only he were master of Castle Richmond. That this view of his position did for a moment shake
him I will not deny; but it was only for a moment: and then it was that he had looked up at
Clara's brother, and bade him go back to his mother and sister, and tell them that Owen of
Hap House was Owen of Hap House still;--that and nothing more. Clara Desmond might be bought
at a price which would be too costly even for such a prize as her. It was well for him that
he so resolved, for at no price could she have been bought.

Mr. Somers, when he received that letter, was much inclined to doubt whether or no it might
not be well to take Owen at his word. After all, what just right had he to the estate? According
to the eternal and unalterable laws of right and wrong ought it not to belong to Herbert Fitzgerald?
Mr. Somers allowed his wish on this occasion to be father to many thoughts much at variance
from that line of thinking which was customary to him as a man of business. In his ordinary
moods, law with him was law, and a legal claim a legal claim. Had he been all his life agent
to the Hap House property instead of to that of Castle Richmond, a thought so romantic would
never have entered his head. He would have scouted a man as nearly a maniac who should suggest
to him that his client ought to surrender an undoubted inheritance of twelve thousand a year
on a point of feeling. He would have rejected it as a proposed crime, and talked much of the
indefeasible rights of the coming heirs of the new heir. He would have been as firm as a rock,
and as trenchant as a sword in defence of his patron's claims. But now, having in his hands
that short, pithy letter from Owen Fitzgerald, he could not but look at the matter in a more
Christian light. After all, was not justice, immutable justice, better than law? And would
not the property be enough for both of them? Might not law and justice make a compromise? Let
Owen be the baronet, and take a slice of four or five thousand, and add that to Hap House;
and then if these things were well arranged, might not Mr. Somers still be agent to them both?

Meditating all this in his newly tuned romantic frame of mind, Mr. Somers sat down and wrote
a long letter to Mr. Prendergast, enclosing the short letter from Owen, and saying all that
he, as a man of business with a new dash of romance, could say on such a subject. This letter,
not having slept on the road as Herbert did in Dublin, and having been conveyed with that lightning
rapidity for which the British Post-office has ever been remarkable--and especially that portion
of it which has reference to the sister island,--was in Mr. Prendergast's pocket when Herbert
dined with him. That letter, and another to which we shall have to refer more specially. But
so much at variance were Mr. Prendergast's ideas from those entertained by Mr. Somers, that
he would not even speak to Herbert on the subject. Perhaps, also, that other more important
letter, which, if we live, we shall read at length, might also have had some effect in keeping
him silent.

But in truth Mr. Somers' mind, and that of Mr. Prendergast, did not work in harmony on this
subject. Judging of the two men together by their usual deeds and ascertained character, we
may say that there was much more romance about Mr. Prendergast than there was about Mr. Somers.
But then it was a general romance, and not one with an individual object. Or perhaps we may
say, without injury to Mr. Somers, that it was a true feeling, and not a false one. Mr. Prendergast,
also, was much more anxious for the welfare of Herbert Fitzgerald than that of his cousin;
but then he could feel on behalf of the man for whom he was interested that it did not behove
him to take a present of an estate from the hands of the true owner.

For more than a week Mr. Somers waited, but got no reply to his letter, and heard nothing from
Mr. Prendergast; and during this time he was really puzzled as to what he should do. As regarded
himself, he did not know at what moment his income might end, or how long he and his family
might be allowed to inhabit the house which he now held: and then he could take no steps as
to the tenants; could neither receive money nor pay it away, and was altogether at his wits'
ends. Lady Fitzgerald looked to him for counsel in everything, and he did not know how to counsel
her. Arrangements were to be made for an auction in the house as soon as she should be able
to move; but would it not be a thousand pities to sell all the furniture if there was a prospect
of the family returning? And so he waited for Mr. Prendergast's letter with an uneasy heart
and vexation of spirit.

But still he attended the relief committees, and worked at the soup-kitchens attached to the
estate, as though he were still the agent to Castle Richmond; and still debated warmly with
Father Barney on one side, and Mr. Townsend on the other, on that vexatious question of out-door
relief. And now the famine was in full swing; and, strange to say, men had ceased to be uncomfortable
about it; --such men, that is, as Mr. Somers and Mr. Townsend. The cutting off of maimed limbs,
and wrenching out from their sockets of smashed bones, is by no means shocking to the skilled
practitioner. And dying paupers, with "the drag" in their face--that certain sign of coming
death of which I have spoken--no longer struck men to the heart. Like the skilled surgeon,
they worked hard enough at what good they could do, and worked the better in that they could
treat the cases without express compassion for the individuals that met their eyes. In administering
relief one may rob five unseen sufferers of what would keep them in life if one is moved to
bestow all that is comfortable on one sufferer that is seen. Was it wise to spend money in
alleviating the last hours of those whose doom was already spoken, which money, if duly used,
might save the lives of others not yet so far gone in misery? And so in one sense those who
were the best in the county, who worked the hardest for the poor and spent their time most
completely among them, became the hardest of heart, and most obdurate in their denials. It
was strange to see devoted women neglecting the wants of the dying, so that they might husband
their strength and time and means for the wants of those who might still be kept among the living.

At this time there came over to the parish of Drumbarrow a young English clergyman who might
be said to be in many respects the very opposite to Mr. Townsend. Two men could hardly be found
in the same profession more opposite in their ideas, lives, purposes, and pursuits;--with this
similarity, however, that each was a sincere, and on the whole an honest man. The Rev. Mr.
Carter was much the junior, being at that time under thirty. He had now visited Ireland with
the sole object of working among the poor, and distributing according to his own judgment certain
funds which had been collected for this purpose in England.

And indeed there did often exist in England at this time a misapprehension as to Irish wants,
which led to some misuses of the funds which England so liberally sent. It came at that time
to be the duty of a certain public officer to inquire into a charge made against a seemingly
respectable man in the far west of Ireland, purporting that he had appropriated to his own
use a sum of twelve pounds sent to him for the relief of the poor of his parish. It had been
sent by three English maiden ladies to the relieving officer of the parish of Kilcoutymorrow,
and had come to his hands, he then filling that position. He, so the charge said,--and unfortunately
said so with only too much truth,--had put the twelve pounds into his own private pocket. The
officer's duty in the matter took him to the chairman of the Relief Committee, a stanch old
Roman Catholic gentleman nearly eighty years of age, with a hoary head and white beard, and
a Milesian name that had come down to him through centuries of Catholic ancestors;--a man urbane
in his manner, of the old school, an Irishman such as one does meet still here and there through
the country, but now not often--one who, above all things, was true to the old religion.

Then the officer of the government told his story to the old Irish gentleman--with many words,
for there were all manner of small collateral proofs, to all of which the old Irish gentleman
listened with a courtesy and patience which were admirable. And when the officer of the government
had done, the old Irish gentleman thus replied:--

"My neighbour Hobbs,"--such was the culprit's name--"has undoubtedly done this thing. He has
certainly spent upon his own uses the generous offering made to our poor parish by those noble-minded
ladies, the three Miss Walkers. But he has acted with perfect honesty in the matter."

"What!" said the government officer, "robbing the poor, and at such a time as this!"

"No robbery at all, dear sir," said the good old Irish gentleman, with the blandest of all
possible smiles; "the excellent Miss Walkers sent their money for the Protestant poor of the
parish of Kilcoutymorrow, and Mr. Hobbs is the only Protestant within it." And from the twinkle
in the old man's eye, it was clear to see that his triumph consisted in this,--that not only
he had but one Protestant in the parish, but that that Protestant should have learned so little
from his religion.

But this is an episode. And nowadays no episodes are allowed.

And now Mr. Carter had come over to see that if possible certain English funds were distributed
according to the wishes of the generous English hearts by whom they had been sent. For as some
English, such as the three Miss Walkers, feared on the one hand that the Babylonish woman so
rampant in Ireland might swallow up their money for Babylonish purposes; so, on the other hand,
did others dread that the too stanch Protestantism of the church militant in that country might
expand the funds collected for undoubted bodily wants in administering to the supposed wants
of the soul. No such faults did, in truth, at that time prevail. The indomitable force of the
famine had absolutely knocked down all that; but there had been things done in Ireland, before
the famine came upon them, which gave reasonable suspicion for such fears.

Mr. Townsend among others had been very active in soliciting aid from England, and hence had
arisen a correspondence between him and Mr. Carter; and now Mr. Carter had arrived at Drumbarrow
with a respectable sum to his credit at the provincial bank, and an intense desire to make
himself useful in this time of sore need. Mr. Carter was a tall, thin, austere-looking man;
one, seemingly, who had macerated himself inwardly and outwardly by hard living. He had a high,
narrow forehead, a sparse amount of animal development, thin lips, and a piercing, sharp, gray
eye. He was a man, too, of few words, and would have been altogether harsh in his appearance
had there not been that in the twinkle of his eye which seemed to say that, in spite of all
that his gait said to the contrary, the cockles of his heart might yet be reached by some play
of wit--if only the wit were to his taste.

Mr. Carter was a man of personal means, so that he not only was not dependent on his profession,
but was able--as he also was willing --to aid that profession by his liberality. In one thing
only was he personally expensive. As to his eating and drinking it was, or might have been
for any solicitude of his own, little more than bread and water. As for the comforts of home,
he had none, for since his ordination his missions had ever been migrating. But he always dressed
with care, and consequently with expense, for careful dressing is ever expensive. He always
wore new black gloves, and a very long black coat which never degenerated to rust, black cloth
trousers, a high black silk waistcoat, and a new black hat. Everything about him was black
except his neck, and that was always scrupulously white.

Mr. Carter was a good man--one may say a very good man--for he gave up himself and his money
to carry out high views of charity and religion, in which he was sincere with the sincerity
of his whole heart, and from which he looked for no reward save such as the godly ever seek.
But yet there was about him too much of the Pharisee. He was greatly inclined to condemn other
men, and to think none righteous who differed from him. And now he had come to Ireland with
a certain conviction that the clergy of his own Church there were men not to be trusted; that
they were mere Irish, and little better in their habits and doctrines than under-bred dissenters.
He had been elsewhere in the country before he visited Drumbarrow, and had shown this too plainly;
but then Mr. Carter was a very young man, and it is not perhaps fair to expect zeal and discretion
also from those who are very young.

Mrs. Townsend had heard of him, and was in dismay when she found that he was to stay with them
at Drumbarrow parsonage for three days. If Mr. Carter did not like clerical characters of her
stamp, neither did she like them of the stamp of Mr. Carter. She had heard of him, of his austerity,
of his look, of his habits, and in her heart she believed him to be a Jesuit. Had she possessed
full sway herself in the parish of Drumbarrow, no bodies should have been saved at such terrible
peril to the souls of the whole parish. But this Mr Carter came with such recommendation--with
such assurances of money given and to be given, of service done and to be done,--that there
was no refusing him. And so the husband, more worldly wise than his wife, had invited the Jesuit
to his parsonage.

"You'll find, Aeneas, he'll have mass in his room in the morning instead of coming to family
prayers," said the wife.

"But what on earth shall we give him for dinner?" said the husband, whose soul at the present
moment was among the flesh-pots, and indeed Mrs. Townsend had also turned over that question
in her prudent mind.

"He'll not eat meat in Lent, you may be sure," said Mrs. Townsend, remembering that that was
the present period of the year.

"And if he would there is none for him to eat," said Mr. Townsend, calling to mind the way
in which the larder had of late been emptied.

Protestant clergymen in Ireland in those days had very frequently other reasons for fasting
than those prescribed by ecclesiastical canons. A well-nurtured lady, the wife of a parish
rector in the county Cork, showed me her larder one day about that time. It contained two large
loaves of bread, and a pan full of stuff which I should have called paste, but which she called
porridge. It was all that she had for herself, her husband, her children, and her charity.
Her servants had left her before she came to that pass. And she was a well-nurtured, handsome,
educated woman, born to such comforts as you and I enjoy every day,--oh, my reader! perhaps
without much giving of thanks for them. Poor lady! the struggle was too much for her, and she
died under it.

Mr. Townsend was, as I have said, the very opposite to Mr. Carter, but he also was a man who
could do without the comforts of life, if the comforts of life did not come readily in his
way. He liked his glass of whisky punch dearly, and had an idea that it was good for him. Not
caring much about personal debts, he would go in debt for whisky. But if the whisky and credit
were at an end, the loss did not make him miserable. He was a man with a large appetite, and
who took great advantage of a good dinner when it was before him, nay, he would go a long distance
to insure a good dinner; but, nevertheless, he would leave himself without the means of getting
a mutton chop, and then not be unhappy. Now Mr. Carter would have been very unhappy had he
been left without his superfine long black coat.

In tendering his invitation to Mr. Carter, Mr. Townsend had explained that with him the res
angusta domi, which was always a prevailing disease, had been heightened by the circumstances
of the time; but that of such crust and cup as he had, his brother English clergyman would
be made most welcome to partake. In answer to this, Mr. Carter had explained that in these
days good men thought but little of crusts and cups, and that as regarded himself, nature had
so made him that he had but few concupiscences of that sort. And then, all this having been
so far explained and settled, Mr. Carter came.

The first day the two clergymen spent together at Berryhill, and found plenty to employ them.
They were now like enough to be in want of funds at that Berryhill soup-kitchen, seeing that
the great fount of supplies, the house, namely, of Castle Richmond, would soon have stopped
running altogether. And Mr. Carter was ready to provide funds to some moderate extent if all
his questions were answered satisfactorily. "There was to be no making of Protestants," he
said, "by giving away of soup purchased with his money." Mr. Townsend thought that this might
have been spared him. "I regret to say," replied he, with some touch of sarcasm, "that we have
no time for that now." "And so better," said Mr. Carter, with a sarcasm of a blunter sort.
"So better. Let us not clog our alms with impossible conditions which will only create falsehood."
"Any conditions are out of the question when one has to feed a whole parish," answered Mr.
Townsend.

And then Mr Carter would teach them how to boil their yellow meal, on which subject he had
a theory totally opposite to the practice of the woman employed at the soup-kitchen. "Av we
war to hocus it that, yer riverence," said Mrs. Daly, turning to Mr. Townsend, "the crathurs
couldn't ate a bit of it; it wouldn't bile at all, at all, not like that."

"Try it, woman," said Mr. Carter, when he had uttered his receipt oracularly for the third time.

"'Deed, an' I won't," said Mrs. Daly, whose presence there was pretty nearly a labour of love,
and who was therefore independent. "It'd be a sin an' a shame to spile Christian vittels in
them times, an' I won't do it." And then there was some hard work that day; and though Mr.
Townsend kept his temper with his visitor, seeing that he had much to get and nothing to give,
he did not on this occasion learn to alter his general opinion of his brethren of the English
High Church.

And then, when they got home, very hungry after their toil, Mr. Townsend made another apology
for the poorness of his table. "I am almost ashamed," said he, "to ask an English gentleman
to sit down to such a dinner as Mrs. Townsend will put before you."

"And indeed then it isn't much," said Mrs. Townsend; "just a bit of fish I found going the road."

"My dear madam, anything will suffice," said Mr. Carter, somewhat pretentiously. And anything
would have sufficed. Had they put before him a mess of that paste of which I have spoken he
would have ate it and said nothing,--ate enough of it at least to sustain him till the morrow.

But things had not come to so bad a pass as this at Drumbarrow parsonage; and, indeed, that
day fortune had been propitious; fortune which ever favours the daring. Mrs. Townsend, knowing
that she had really nothing in the house, had sent Jerry to waylay the Lent fishmonger, who
twice a week was known to make his way from Kanturk to Mallow with a donkey and panniers, and
Jerry had returned with a prize.

And now they sat down to dinner, and lo and behold, to the great surprise of Mr. Carter, and
perhaps also to the surprise of the host, a magnificent turbot smoked upon the board. The fins
no doubt had been cut off to render possible the insertion of the animal into the largest of
the Drumbarrow parsonage kitchen-pots,--an injury against which Mr. Townsend immediately exclaimed
angrily. "My goodness, they have cut off the fins!" said he, holding up both hands in deep
dismay. According to his philosophy, if he did have a turbot, why should he not have it with
all its perfections about it--fins and all?

"My dear Aeneas!" said Mrs. Townsend, looking at him with that agony of domestic distress which
all wives so well know how to assume.

Mr. Carter said nothing. He said not a word, but he thought much. This then was their pretended
poorness of living; with all their mock humility, these false Irishmen could not resist the
opportunity of showing off before the English stranger, and of putting on their table before
him a dish which an English dean could afford only on gala days. And then this clergyman, who
was so loudly anxious for the poor, could not repress the sorrow of his heart because the rich
delicacy was somewhat marred in the cooking. "It was too bad," thought Mr. Carter to himself,
"too bad."

"None, thank you," said he, drawing himself up with gloomy reprobation of countenance. "I will
not take any fish, I am much obliged to you."

Then the face of Mrs. Townsend was one on which neither Christian nor heathen could have looked
without horror and grief. What, the man whom in her heart she believed to be a Jesuit, and
for whom nevertheless, Jesuit though he was, she had condescended to cater with all her woman's
wit!--this man, I say, would not eat fish in Lent! And it was horrible to her warm Irish heart
to think that after that fish now upon the table there was nothing to come but two or three
square inches of cold bacon. Not eat turbot in Lent! Had he been one of her own sort she might
have given him credit for true antagonism to popery; but every inch of his coat gave the lie
to such a supposition as that.

"Do take a bit," said Mr. Townsend, hospitably. "The fins should not have been cut off, otherwise
I never saw a finer fish in my life."

"None, I am very much obliged to you," said Mr. Carter, with sternest reprobation of feature.

It was too much for Mrs. Townsend. "Oh, Aeneas," said she, "what are we to do?" Mr. Townsend
merely shrugged his shoulders, while he helped himself. His feelings were less acute, perhaps,
than those of his wife, and he, no doubt, was much more hungry. Mr. Carter the while sat by,
saying nothing, but looking daggers. He also was hungry, but under such circumstances he would
rather starve than eat.

"Don't you ever eat fish, Mr. Carter?" said Mr. Townsend, proceeding to help himself for a
second time, and poking about round the edges of the delicate creature before him for some
relics of the glutinous morsels which he loved so well. He was not, however, enjoying it as
he should have done, for seeing that his guest ate none, and that his wife's appetite was thoroughly
marred, he was alone in his occupation. No one but a glutton could have feasted well under
such circumstances, and Mr. Townsend was not a glutton.

"Thank you, I will eat none to-day," said Mr. Carter, sitting bolt upright, and fixing his
keen gray eyes on the wall opposite.

"Then you may take away, Biddy; I've done with it. But it's a thousand pities such a fish should
have been so wasted."

The female heart of Mrs. Townsend could stand these wrongs no longer, and with a tear in one
corner of her eye, and a gleam of anger in the other, she at length spoke out. "I am sure then
I don't know what you will eat, Mr. Carter, and I did think that all you English clergymen
always ate fish in Lent,--and indeed nothing else; for indeed people do say that you are much
the same as the papists in that respect."

"Hush, my dear!" said Mr. Townsend.

"Well, but I can't hush when there's nothing for the gentleman to eat."

"My dear madam, such a matter does not signify in the least," said Mr. Carter, not unbending
an inch.

"But it does signify, it signifies a great deal; and so you'd know if you were a family man;"--"as
you ought to be," Mrs. Townsend would have been delighted to add. "And I'm sure I sent Jerry
five miles, and he was gone four hours to get that bit of fish from Paddy Magrath, as he stops
always at Ballygibblin Gate; and indeed I thought myself so lucky, for I only gave Jerry one
and sixpence. But they had an uncommon take of fish yesterday at Skibbereen, and--"

"One and sixpence!" said Mr. Carter, now slightly relaxing his brow for the first time.

"I'd have got it for one and three," said Mr. Townsend, upon whose mind an inkling of the truth
was beginning to dawn.

"Indeed and you wouldn't, Aeneas; and Jerry was forced to promise the man a glass of whisky
the first time he comes this road, which he does sometimes. That fish weighed over nine pounds,
every ounce of it."

"Nine fiddlesticks," said Mr. Townsend.

"I weighed it myself, Aeneas, with my own hands, and it was nine pounds four ounces before
we were obliged to cut it, and as firm as a rock the flesh was."

"For one and sixpence!" said Mr. Carter, relaxing still a little further, and condescending
to look his hostess in the face.

"Yes, for one and six, and now--"

"I'm sure I'd have bought it for one and four, fins and all," said the parson, determined to
interrupt his wife in her pathos.

"I'm sure you would not then," said his wife, taking his assertion in earnest. "You could never
market against Jerry in your life; I will say that for him."

"If you will allow me to change my mind, I think I will have a little bit of it," said Mr.
Carter, almost humbly.

"By all means," said Mr. Townsend. "Biddy, bring that fish back. Now I think of it, I have
not half dined myself yet."

And then they all three forgot their ill humours, and enjoyed their dinner thoroughly,--in
spite of the acknowledged fault as touching the lost fins of the animal.

CHAPTER XXXVIII

CONDEMNED

I have said that Lord Desmond rode home from Hap House that day in a quieter mood and at a
slower pace than that which had brought him thither, and in truth it was so. He had things
to think of now much more serious than any that had filled his mind as he had cantered along,
joyously hoping that after all he might have for his brother the man that he loved, and the
owner of Castle Richmond also. This was now impossible; but he felt that he loved Owen better
than ever he had done, and he was pledged to fight Owen's battle, let Owen be ever so poor.

"And what does it signify after all?" he said to himself, as he rode along. "We shall all be
poor together, and then we sha'n't mind it so much; and if I don't marry, Hap House itself
will be something to add to the property;" and then he made up his mind that he could be happy
enough, living at Desmond Court all his life, so long as he could have Owen Fitzgerald near
him to make life palatable.

That night he spoke to no one on the subject, at least to no one of his own accord. When they
were alone his mother asked him where he had been; and when she learned that he had been at
Hap House, she questioned him much as to what had passed between him and Owen; but he would
tell her nothing, merely saying that Owen had spoken of Clara with his usual ecstasy of love,
but declining to go into the subject at any length. The countess, however, gathered from him
that he and Owen were on kindly terms together, and so far she felt satisfied.

On the following morning he made up his mind "to have it out," as he called it, with Clara;
but when the hour came his courage failed him: it was a difficult task--that which he was now
to undertake--of explaining to her his wish that she should go back to her old lover, not because
he was no longer poor, but, as it were in spite of his poverty, and as a reward to him for
consenting to remain poor. As he had thought about it while riding home, it had seemed feasible
enough. He would tell her how nobly Owen was going to behave to Herbert, and would put it to
her whether, as he intended willingly to abandon the estate, he ought not to be put into possession
of the wife. There was a romantic justice about this which he thought would touch Clara's heart.
But on the following morning when he came to think what words he would use for making his little
proposition, the picture did not seem to him to be so beautiful. If Clara really loved Herbert--and
she had declared that she did twenty times over--it would be absurd to expect her to give him
up merely because he was not a ruined man. But then, which did she love? His mother declared
that she loved Owen. "That's the real question," said the earl to himself, as on the second
morning he made up his mind that he would "have it out" with Clara without any further delay.
He must be true to Owen; that was his first great duty at the present moment.

"Clara, I want to talk to you," he said, breaking suddenly into the room where she usually
sat alone o' mornings. "I was at Hap House the day before yesterday with Owen Fitzgerald, and
to tell you the truth at once, we were talking about you the whole time we were there. And
now what I want is, that something should be settled, so that we may all understand one another."

These words he spoke to her quite abruptly. When he first said that he wished to speak to her,
she had got up from her chair to welcome him, for she dearly loved to have him there. There
was nothing she liked better than having him to herself when he was in a soft brotherly humour;
and then she would interest herself about his horse, and his dogs, and his gun, and predict
his life for him, sending him up as a peer to Parliament, and giving him a noble wife, and
promising him that he should be such a Desmond as would redeem all the family from their distresses.
But now as he rapidly brought out his words, she found that on this day her prophecies must
regard herself chiefly.

"Surely, Patrick, it is easy enough to understand me," she said.

"Well, I don't know; I don't in the least mean to find fault with you."

"I am glad of that, dearest," she said, laying her hand upon his arm.

"But my mother says one thing, and you another, and Owen another; and I myself, I hardly know
what to say."

"Look here, Patrick, it is simply this: I became engaged to Herbert with my mother's sanction
and yours; and now--"

"Stop a moment," said the impetuous boy, "and do not pledge yourself to anything till you have
heard me. I know that you are cut to the heart about Herbert Fitzgerald losing his property."

"No, indeed; not at all cut to the heart; that is as regards myself."

"I don't mean as regards yourself; I mean as regards him. I have heard you say over and over
again that it is a piteous thing that he should be so treated. Have I not?"

"Yes, I have said that, and I think so."

"And I think that most of your great--great--great love for him, if you will, comes from that
sort of feeling."

"But, Patrick, it came long before."

"Dear Clara, do listen to me, will you? You may at any rate do as much as that for me." And
then Clara stood perfectly mute, looking into his handsome face as he continued to rattle out
his words at her.

"Now, if you please, Clara, you may have the means of giving back to him all his property,
every shilling that he ever had, or expected to have. Owen Fitzgerald,--who certainly is the
finest fellow that ever I came across in all my life, or ever shall, if I live to five hundred,--says
that he will make over every acre of Castle Richmond back to his cousin Herbert if--" Oh, my
lord, my lord, what a scheme is this you are concocting to entrap your sister! Owen Fitzgerald
inserted no "if," as you are well aware! "If," he continued, with some little qualm of conscience,
"if you will consent to be his wife."

"Patrick!"

"Listen, now listen. He thinks, and, Clara, by the heavens above me! I think also, that you
did love him better than you ever loved Herbert Fitzgerald." Clara as she heard these words
blushed ruby red up to her very hair, but she said never a word. "And I think, and he thinks,
that you are bound now to Herbert by his misfortunes--that you feel that you cannot desert
him because he has fallen so low. By George, Clara, I am proud of you for sticking to him through
thick and thin, now that he is down! But the matter will be very difficult if you have the
means of giving back to him all that he has lost, as you have. Owen will be poor, but he is
a prince among men. By heaven, Clara, if you will only say that he is your choice, Herbert
shall have back all Castle Richmond! and I--I shall never marry, and you may give to the man
that I love as my brother all that there is left to us of Desmond."

There was something grand about the lad's eager tone of voice as he made his wild proposal,
and something grand also about his heart. He meant what he said, foolish as he was either to
mean or to say it. Clara burst into tears, and threw herself into his arms. "You don't understand,"
she said, through her sobs, "my own, own brother, you do not understand."

"But, by Jove! I think I do understand. As sure as you are a living girl he will give back
Castle Richmond to Herbert Fitzgerald."

She recovered herself, and leaving her brother's arms, walked away to the window, and from
thence looked down to that path beneath the elms which was the spot in the world which she
thought of the oftenest, but as she gazed, there was no lack of loyalty in her heart to the
man to whom she was betrothed. It seemed to her as though those childish days had been in another
life, as though Owen had been her lover in another world,--a sweet, childish, innocent, happy
world which she remembered well, but which was now dissevered from her by an impassable gulf.
She thought of his few words of love,--so few that she remembered every word that he had then
spoken, and thought of them with a singular mixture of pain and pleasure. And now she heard
of his noble self-denial with a thrill which was in no degree enhanced by the fact that she,
or even Herbert, was to be the gainer by it. She rejoiced at his nobility, merely because it
was a joy to her to know that he was so noble. And yet all through this she was true to Herbert.
Another work-a-day world had come upon her in her womanhood, and as that came she had learned
to love a man of another stamp, with a love that was quieter, more subdued, and perhaps, as
she thought, more enduring. Whatever might be Herbert's lot in life, that lot she would share.
Her love for Owen should never be more to her than a dream.

"Did he send you to me?" she said at last, without turning her face away from the window.

"Yes, then, he did; he did send me to you, and he told me to say that as Owen of Hap House
he loved you still. And I, I promised to do his bidding; and I promised, moreover, that as
far as my good word could go with you, he should have it. And now you know it all; if you care
for my pleasure in the matter you will take Owen, and let Herbert have his property. By Jove!
if he is treated in that way he cannot complain."

"Patrick," said she, returning to him and again laying her hand on him. "You must now take
my message also. You must go to him and bid him come here that I may see him."

"Who? Owen?"

"Yes, Owen Fitzgerald."

"Very well, I have no objection in life." And the earl thought that the difficulty was really
about to be overcome. "And about my mother?"

"I will tell mamma."

"And what shall I say to Owen?"

"Say nothing to him, but bid him come here. But wait, Patrick; yes, he must not misunderstand
me; I can never, never, never marry him."

"Clara!"

"Never, never; it is impossible. Dear Patrick, I am so sorry to make you unhappy, and I love
you so very dearly,--better than ever, I think, for speaking as you do now. But that can never
be. Let him come here, however, and I myself will tell him all." At last, disgusted and unhappy
though he was, the earl did accept the commission, and again on that afternoon rode across
the fields to Hap House.

"I will tell him nothing but that he is to come," said the earl to himself as he went thither.
And he did tell Owen nothing else. Fitzgerald questioned him much, but learned but little from
him. "By heavens, Owen," he said, "you must settle the matter between you, for I don't understand
it. She has bid me ask you to come to her; and now you must fight your own battle." Fitzgerald
of course said that he would obey, and so Lord Desmond left him.

In the evening Clara told her mother. "Owen Fitzgerald is to be here to-morrow," she said.

"Owen Fitzgerald; is he?" said the countess. She hardly knew how to bear herself, or how to
interfere so as to assist her own object; or how not to interfere, lest she should mar it.

"Yes, mamma. Patrick saw him the other day, and I think it is better that I should see him also."

"Very well, my dear. But you must be aware, Clara, that you have been so very--I don't wish
to say headstrong exactly--so very entetee about your own affairs, that I hardly know how to
speak of them. If your brother is in your confidence I shall be satisfied."

"He is in my confidence, and so may you be also, mamma, if you please."

But the countess thought it better not to have any conversation forced upon her at that moment;
and so she asked her daughter for no further show of confidence then. It would probably be
as well that Owen should come and plead his own cause.

And Owen did come. All that night and on the next morning the poor girl remained alone in a
state of terrible doubt. She had sent for her old lover, thinking at the moment that no one
could explain to him in language so clear as her own what was her fixed resolve. And she had
too been so moved by the splendour of his offer, that she longed to tell him what she thought
of it. The grandeur of that offer was enhanced tenfold in her mind by the fact that it had
been so framed as to include her in this comparative poverty with which Owen himself was prepared
to rest contented. He had known that she was not to be bought by wealth, and had given her
credit for a nobility that was akin to his own.

But yet, now that the moment was coming, how was she to talk to him? How was she to speak the
words which would rob him of his hope, and tell him that he did not, could not, never could
possess that one treasure which he desired more than houses and lands, or station and rank?
Alas, alas! If it could have been otherwise! If it could have been otherwise! She also was
in love with poverty;--but at any rate, no one could accuse her now of sacrificing a poor lover
for a rich one. Herbert Fitzgerald would be poor enough.

And then he came. They had hitherto met but once since that afternoon, now so long ago--that
afternoon to which she looked back as to another former world--and that meeting had been in
the very room in which she was now prepared to receive him. But her feelings towards him had
been very different then. Then he had almost forced himself upon her, and for months previously
she had heard nothing of him but what was evil. He had come complaining loudly, and her heart
had been somewhat hardened against him. Now he was there at her bidding, and her heart and
very soul were full of tenderness. She rose rapidly, and sat down again, and then again rose
as she heard his footsteps; but when he entered the room she was standing in the middle of it.

"Clara," he said, taking the hand which she mechanically held out, "I have come here now at
your brother's request."

Her name sounded so sweet upon his lips. No idea occurred to her that she ought to be angry
with him for using it. Angry with him! Could it be possible that she should ever be angry with
him--that she ever had been so?

"Yes," she said. "Patrick said something to me which made me think that it would be better
that we should meet."

"Well, yes; it is better. If people are honest they had always better say to each other's faces
that which they have to say."

"I mean to be honest, Mr. Fitzgerald."

"Yes, I am sure you do; and so do I also. And if this is so, why cannot we say each to the
other that which we have to say? My tale will be a very short one; but it will be true if it
is short."

"But, Mr. Fitzgerald--"

"Well, Clara?"

"Will you not sit down?" And she herself sat upon the sofa; and he drew a chair for himself
near to her; but he was too impetuous to remain seated on it long. During the interview between
them he was sometimes standing, and sometimes walking quickly about the room; and then for
a moment he would sit down, or lean down over her on the sofa arm.

"But, Mr. Fitzgerald, it is my tale that I wish you to hear."

"Well; I will listen to it." But he did not listen; for before she had spoken a dozen words
he had interrupted her, and poured out upon her his own wild plans and generous schemes. She,
poor girl, had thought to tell him that she loved Herbert, and Herbert only--as a lover. But
that if she could love him, him Owen, as a brother and a friend, that love she would so willingly
give him. And then she would have gone on to say how impossible it would have been for Herbert,
under any circumstances, to have availed himself of such generosity as that which had been
offered. But her eloquence was all cut short in the bud. How could she speak with such a storm
of impulse raging before her as that which was now strong within Owen Fitzgerald's bosom?

He interrupted her before she had spoken a dozen words, in order that he might exhibit before
her eyes the project with which his bosom was filled. This he did, standing for the most part
before her, looking down upon her as she sat beneath him, with her eyes fixed upon the floor,
while his were riveted on her down-turned face. She knew it all before--all this that he had
to say to her, or she would hardly have understood it from his words, they were so rapid and
vehement. And yet they were tender, too; spoken in a loving tone, and containing ever and anon
assurances of respect, and a resolve to be guided now and for ever by her wishes,--even though
those wishes should be utterly subversive of his happiness.

"And now you know it all," he said, at last. "And as for my cousin's property, that is safe
enough. No earthly consideration would induce me to put a hand upon that, seeing that by all
justice it is his." But in this she hardly yet quite understood him. "Let him have what luck
he may in other respects, he shall still be master of Castle Richmond. If it were that that
you wanted--as I know it is not--that I cannot give you. I cannot tell you with what scorn
I should regard myself if I were to take advantage of such an accident as this to rob any man
of his estate."

Her brother had been right, so Clara felt, when he declared that Owen Fitzgerald was the finest
fellow that ever he had come across. She made another such declaration within her own heart,
only with words that were more natural to her. He was the noblest gentleman of whom she had
ever heard, or read, or thought.

"But," continued Owen, "as I will not interfere with him in that which should be his, neither
should he interfere with me in that which should be mine. Clara, the only estate that I claim,
is your heart."

And that estate she could not give him. On that at any rate she was fixed. She could not barter
herself about from one to the other either as a make-weight or a counterpoise. All his pleading
was in vain; all his generosity would fail in securing to him this one reward that he desired.
And now she had to tell him so.

"Your brother seems to think," he continued, "that you still--;" but now it was her turn to
interrupt him.

"Patrick is mistaken," she said, with her eyes still fixed upon the ground.

"What. You will tell me, then, that I am utterly indifferent to you?"

"No, no, no; I did not say so." And now she got up and took hold of his arm, and looked into
his face imploringly. "I did not say so. But, oh, Mr. Fitzgerald, be kind to me, be forbearing
with me, be good to me," and she almost embraced his arm as she appealed to him, with her eyes
all swimming with tears.

"Good to you!" he said. And a strong passion came upon him, urging him to throw his arm round
her slender body, and press her to his bosom. Good to her! would he not protect her with his
life's blood against all the world if she would only come to him? "Good to you, Clara! Can
you not trust me that I will be good to you if you will let me?"

"But not so, Owen." It was the first time she had ever called him by his name, and she blushed
again as she remembered that it was so. "Not good, as you mean, for now I must trust to another
for that goodness. Herbert must be my husband, Owen; but will not you be our friend?"

"Herbert must be your husband!"

"Yes, yes, yes. It is so. Do not look at me in that way, pray do not; what would you have me
do? You would not have me false to my troth, and false to my own heart, because you are generous.
Be generous to me--to me also."

He turned away from her, and walked the whole length of the long room; away and back, before
he answered her, and even then, when he had returned to her, he stood looking at her before
he spoke. And she now looked full into his face, hoping, but yet fearing; hoping that he might
yield to her; and fearing his terrible displeasure should he not yield.

"Clara," he said; and he spoke solemnly, slowly, and in a mood unlike his own,--"I cannot as
yet read your heart clearly; nor do I know whether you can quite so read it yourself."

"I can, I can," she answered quickly; "and you shall know it all--all, if you wish."

"I want to know but one thing. Whom is it that you love? And, Clara,"--and this he said interrupting
her as she was about to speak--"I do not ask you to whom you are engaged. You have engaged
yourself both to him and to me."

"Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald!"

"I do not blame you, not in the least. But is it not so? as to that I will ask no question,
and say nothing; only this, that so far we are equal. But now ask of your own heart, and then
answer me. Whom is it then you love?"

"Herbert Fitzgerald," she said. The words hardly formed themselves into a whisper, but nevertheless
they were audible enough to him.

"Then I have no further business here," he said, and turned about as though to leave the room.

But she ran forward and stopped him, standing between him and the door. "Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald,
do not leave me like that. Say one word of kindness to me before you go. Tell me that you forgive
me for the injury I have done you."

"Yes, I forgive you."

"And is that all? Oh, I will love you so, if you will let me,--as your friend, as your sister;
you shall be our dearest, best, and nearest friend. You do not know how good he is. Owen, will
you not tell me that you will love me as a brother loves?"

"No!" and the sternness of his face was such that it was dreadful to look on it. "I will tell
you nothing that is false."

"And would that be false?"

"Yes, false as hell! What, sit by at his hearthstone and see you leaning on his bosom! Sleep
under his roof while you were in his arms! No, Lady Clara, that would not be possible. That
virtue, if it be virtue, I cannot possess."

"And you must go from me in anger? If you knew what I am suffering you would not speak to me
so cruelly."

"Cruel! I would not wish to be cruel to you; certainly not now, for we shall not meet again;
if ever, not for many years. I do not think that I have been cruel to you."

"Then say one word of kindness before you go!"

"A word of kindness! Well; what shall I say? Every night, as I have lain in my bed, I have
said words of kindness to you, since-- since--since longer than you will remember; since I
first knew you as a child. Do you ever think of the day when you walked with me round by the
bridge?"

"It is bootless thinking of that now."

"Bootless! yes, and words of kindness are bootless. Between you and me, such words should be
full of love, or they would have no meaning. What can I say to you that shall be both kind
and true?"

"Bid God bless me before you leave me."

"Well. I will say that. May God bless you, in this world and in the next! And now, Lady Clara
Desmond, good-bye!" and he tendered to her his hand.

She took it, and pressed it between both of hers, and looked up into his face, and stood so
while the fast tears ran down her face. He must have been more or less than man had he not
relented then. "And, Owen," she said, "dear Owen, may God in His mercy bless you also, and
make you happy, and give you some one that you can love, and--and--teach you in your heart
to forgive the injury I have done you." And then she stooped down her head and pressed her
lips upon the hand which she held within her own.

"Forgive you! Well--I do forgive you. Perhaps it may be right that we should both forgive;
though I have not wittingly brought unhappiness upon you. But what there is to be forgiven
on my side, I do forgive. And--and I hope that you may be happy." They were the last words
that he spoke; and then leading her back to her seat, he placed her there, and without turning
to look at her again, he left the room.

He hurried down into the court, and called for his horse. As he stood there, when his foot
was in the stirrup, and his hand on the animal's neck, Lord Desmond came up to him. "Goodbye,
Desmond," he said. "It is all over; God knows when you and I may meet again." And without waiting
for a word of reply he rode out under the porch, and putting spurs to his horse, galloped fast
across the park. The earl, when he spoke of it afterwards to his mother, said that Owen's face
had been as it were a thunder-cloud.

CHAPTER XXXIX

FOX-HUNTING IN SPINNY LANE

I think it will be acknowledged that Mr. Prendergast had said no word throughout the conversation
recorded in a late chapter as having taken place between him and Herbert Fitzgerald over their
wine, which could lead Herbert to think it possible that he might yet recover his lost inheritance;
but nevertheless during the whole of that evening he held in his pocket a letter, received
by him only that afternoon, which did encourage him to think that such an event might at any
rate be possible. And, indeed, he held in his pocket two letters, having a tendency to the
same effect, but we shall have nothing now to say as to that letter from Mr. Somers of which
we have spoken before.

It must be understood that up to this time certain inquiries had been going on with reference
to the life of Mr. Matthew Mollett, and that these inquiries were being made by agents employed
by Mr. Prendergast. He had found that Mollett's identity with Talbot had been so fully proved
as to make it, in his opinion, absolutely necessary that Herbert and his mother should openly
give up Castle Richmond. But, nevertheless, without a hope, and in obedience solely to what
he felt that prudence demanded in so momentous a matter, he did prosecute all manner of inquiries;--but
prosecuted them altogether in vain. And now, O thou most acute of lawyers, this new twinkling
spark of hope has come to thee from a source whence thou least expectedst it!

Quod minime reris Graia pandetur ab urbe.

And then, as soon as Herbert was gone from him, crossing one leg over the other as he sat in
his easy chair, he took it from his pocket and read it for the third time. The signature at
the end of it was very plain and legible, being that of a scholar no less accomplished than
Mr. Abraham Mollett. This letter we will have entire, though it was not perhaps as short as
it might have been. It ran as follows:--

"45 Tabernacle row London April--1847.

"RESPECTIT SIR--

Now look about you; you are many hundred feet under ground." It was a strange scene to Charlie.
Look where you would, nothing but black met the eye--black walls, black floor, groups of black
men standing about--every one and every thing was covered with the bright coal dust that glittered
and sparkled in the rays of the lamps, like black diamonds.

"Now," said Brownlee, "we must get to work. I'll take you to your place, as it is in my way;"
and they turned up a sort of road or gallery that had been cut out of the slate and coal. On each
side of this branched, right and left, other roads or galleries that had been formed by the
taking away of the coal; from these again branched other roads, and
so on, that you might walk for miles under ground, in and out of the
workings of the mine. He was not, therefore, led into any strong opinion
that these new tidings were of value. And, indeed, he was prone to disbelieve them, because
they ran counter to a conviction which had already been made in his own heart, and had been
extensively acted on by him. Nevertheless he resolved that even Aby's letter deserved attention,
and that it should receive that attention early on the following morning.

And thus he had sat for the three hours after dinner, chatting comfortably with his young friend,
and holding this letter in his pocket. Had he shown it to Herbert, or spoken of it, he would
have utterly disturbed the equilibrium of the embryo law student, and rendered his entrance
in Mr. Die's chambers absolutely futile. "Ten will not be too early for you," he had said.
"Mr. Die is always in his room by that hour." Herbert had of course declared that ten would
not be at all too early for him; and Mr. Prendergast had observed that after leaving Mr. Die's
chambers, he himself would go on to the City. He might have said beyond the City, for his intended
expedition was to Spinny lane, at St. Botolph's in the East When Herbert was gone he sat musing
over his fire with Aby's letter still in his hand. A lawyer has always a sort of affection
for a scoundrel,--such affection as a hunting man has for a fox. He loves to watch the skill
and dodges of the animal, to study the wiles by which he lives, and to circumvent them by wiles
of his own, still more wily. It is his glory to run the beast down; but then he would not for
worlds run him down, except in conformity with certain laws, fixed by old custom for the guidance
of men in such sports. And the two-legged vermin is adapted for pursuit as is the fox with
four legs. He is an unclean animal, leaving a scent upon his trail, which the nose of your
acute law hound can pick up over almost any ground. And the more wily the beast is, the longer
he can run, the more trouble he can give in the pursuit, the longer he can stand up before
a pack of legal hounds, the better does the forensic sportsman love and value him. There are
foxes of so excellent a nature, so keen in their dodges, so perfect in their cunning, so skilful
in evasion, that a sportsman cannot find it in his heart to push them to their destruction
unless the field be very large so that many eyes are looking on. And the feeling is I think
the same with lawyers.

Mr. Prendergast had always felt a tenderness towards the Molletts, father and son,--a tenderness
which would by no means have prevented him from sending them both to the halter had that been
necessary, and had they put themselves so far in his power. Much as the sportsman loves the
fox, it is a moment to him of keen enjoyment when he puts his heavy boot on the beast's body,--the
expectant dogs standing round demanding their prey--and there both beheads and betails him.
"A grand old dog," he says to those around him. "I know him well. It was he who took us that
day from Poulnarer, through Castlecor, and right away to Drumcollogher." And then he throws
the heavy carcase to the hungry hounds. And so could Mr. Prendergast have delivered up either
of the Molletts to be devoured by the dogs of the law; but he did not the less love them tenderly
while they were yet running.

And so he sat with the letter in his hand, smiling to think that the father and son had come
to grief among themselves; smiling also at the dodge by which, as he thought most probable,
Aby Mollett was striving to injure the man who had kicked him, and raise a little money for
his own private needs. There was too much earnestness in that prayer for cash to leave Mr.
Prendergast in any doubt as to Aby's trust that money would be forthcoming. There must be something
in the dodge, or Aby would not have had such trust.

And the lawyer felt that he might, perhaps, be inclined to give some little assistance to poor
Aby in the soreness of his needs. Foxes will not do well in any country which is not provided
with their natural food. Rats they eat, and if rats be plentiful it is so far good. But one
should not begrudge them occasional geese and turkeys, or even break one's heart if they like
a lamb in season. A fox will always run well when he has come far from home seeking his breakfast.

Poor Aby, when he had been so cruelly treated by the "gent of Appy ouse," whose side in the
family dispute he had latterly been so anxious to take, had remained crouching for some hour
or two in Owen's kitchen, absolutely mute. The servants there for a while felt sure that he
was dying; but in their master's present mood they did not dare to go near him with any such
tidings. And then when the hounds were gone, and the place was again quiet, Aby gradually roused
himself, allowed them to wash the blood from his hands and face, to restore him to life by
whisky and scraps of food, and gradually got himself into his car, and so back to the Kanturk
Hotel, in South Main Street, Cork.

But, alas, his state there was more wretched by far than it had been in the Hap House kitchen.
That his father had fled was no more than he expected. Each had known that the other would
now play some separate secret game. But not the less did he complain loudly when he heard that
"his guvnor" had not paid the bill, and had left neither money nor message for him. How Fanny
had scorned and upbraided him, and ordered Tom to turn him out of the house "neck and crop;"
how he had squared at Tom, and ultimately had been turned out of the house "neck and crop,"--whatever
that may mean--by Fanny's father, needs not here to be particularly narrated. With much suffering
and many privations--such as foxes in their solitary wanderings so often know--he did find
his way to London; and did, moreover, by means of such wiles as foxes have, find out something
as to his "guvnor's" whereabouts, and some secrets also as to his "guvnor" which his "guvnor"
would fain have kept to himself had it been possible. And then, also, he again found for himself
a sort of home--or hole rather--in his old original gorse covert of London; somewhere among
the Jews, we may surmise, from the name of the row from which he dated; and here, setting to
work once more with his usual cunning industry,--for your fox is very industrious,--he once
more attempted to build up a slender fortune by means of the "Fitsjerral" family. The grand
days in which he could look for the hand of the fair Emmeline were all gone by; but still the
property had been too good not to leave something for which he might grasp. Properly worked,
by himself alone, as he said to himself, it might still yield him some comfortable returns,
especially as he should be able to throw over that "confounded old guvnor of his."

He remained at home the whole of the day after his letter was written, indeed for the next
three days, thinking that Mr. Prendergast would come to him, or send for him; but Mr. Prendergast
did neither the one nor the other. Mr. Prendergast took his advice instead, and putting himself
into a Hansom cab, had himself driven to "Centbotollfs intheheast."

Spinny Lane, St. Botolph's in the East, when at last it was found, was not exactly the sort
of place that Mr. Prendergast had expected. It must be known that he did not allow the cabman
to drive him up to the very door indicated, nor even to the lane itself; but contented himself
with leaving the cab at St. Botolph's church. The huntsman in looking after his game is as
wily as the fox himself. Men do not talk at the covert side--or at any rate they ought not.
And they should stand together discreetly at the non-running side. All manner of wiles and
silences and discretions are necessary, though too often broken through by the uninstructed,--much
to their own discomfort. And so in hunting his fox, Mr. Prendergast did not dash up loudly
into the covert, but discreetly left his cab at the church of St. Botolph's.

Spinny Lane, when at last found by intelligence given to him at the baker's,--never in such
unknown regions ask a lad in the street, for he invariably will accompany you, talking of your
whereabouts very loudly, so that people stare at you, and ask each other what can possibly
be your business in those parts--Spinny Lane, I say, was not the sort of locality that he had
expected. He knew the look of the half-protected, half-condemned Alsatias of the present-day
rascals, and Spinny Lane did not at all bear their character. It was a street of small new
tenements, built, as yet, only on one side of the way, with the pavement only one third finished,
and the stones in the road as yet unbroken and untrodden. Of such streets there are thousands
now round London. They are to be found in every suburb, creating wonder in all thoughtful minds
as to who can be their tens of thousands of occupants. The houses are a little too good for
artisans, too small and too silent to be the abode of various lodgers, and too mean for clerks
who live on salaries. They are as dull-looking as Lethe itself, dull and silent, dingy and
repulsive. But they are not discreditable in appearance, and never have that Mohawk look which
by some unknown sympathy in bricks and mortar attaches itself to the residences of professional
ruffians.

Number seven he found to be as quiet and decent a house as any in the row, and having inspected
it from a little distance he walked up briskly to the door, and rang the bell. He walked up
briskly in order that his advance might not be seen; unless, indeed, as he began to think not
impossible, Aby's statement was altogether a hoax.

"Does a woman named Mrs. Mary Swan live here?" he asked of a decent-looking young woman of
some seven or eight and twenty, who opened the door for him. She was decent looking, but poverty
stricken and wan with work and care, and with that heaviness about her which perpetual sorrow
always gives. Otherwise she would not have been ill featured; and even as it was she was feminine
and soft in her gait and manner. "Does Mrs. Mary Swan live here?" asked Mr. Prendergast in
a mild voice.

She at once said Mrs. Mary Swan did live there; but she stood with the door in her hand by
no means fully opened, as though she did not wish to ask him to enter; and yet there was nothing
in her tone to repel him. Mr. Prendergast at once felt that he was on the right scent, and
that it behoved him at any rate to make his way into that house; for if ever a modest-looking
daughter was like an immodest-looking father, that young woman was like Mr. Mollett senior.

"Then I will see her, if you please," said Mr. Prendergast, entering the passage without her
invitation. Not that he pushed in with roughness, but she receded before the authority of his
tone, and obeyed the command which she read in his eye. The poor young woman hesitated as though
it had been her intention to declare that Mrs. Swan was not within; but if so, she had not
strength to carry out her purpose, for in the next moment Mr. Prendergast found himself in
the presence of the woman he had come to seek.

"Mrs. Mary Swan?" said Mr. Prendergast, asking a question as to her identity.

"Yes, sir, that is my name," said a sickly-looking elderly woman, rising from her chair.

The room in which the two had been sitting was very poor; but nevertheless it was neat, and
arranged with some attention to appearance. It was not carpeted, but there was a piece of drugget
some three yards long spread before the fireplace. The wall had been papered from time to time
with scraps of different coloured paper, as opportunity offered. The table on which the work
of the two women was lying was very old and somewhat rickety, but it was of mahogany; and Mrs.
Mary Swan herself was accommodated with a high-backed arm-chair, which gave some appearance
of comfort to her position. It was now spring; but they had a small, very small fire in the
small grate, on which a pot had been placed in hopes that it might be induced to boil. All
these things did the eye of Mr. Prendergast take in; but the fact which his eye took in with
its keenest glance was this,--that on the other side of the fire to that on which sat Mrs.
Mary Swan, there was a second arm-chair standing close over the fender, an ordinary old mahogany
chair, in which it was evident that the younger woman had not been sitting. The statement that Saul
"perceived" that it was Samuel is not to be taken to imply that, even now, Saul actually saw
the shade of the prophet, but only that the woman's allusion to the prophetic mantle and to
the aged appearance of the spectre convinced him that it was Samuel.

Reuss [3] in fact translates the passage "Alors Saul reconnut que c'etait Samuel." Nor does
the dialogue between Saul and Samuel necessarily, or probably, signify that Samuel spoke otherwise
than by the voice of the wise woman.
 Her clothes, though very poor, were neat, and worn as a
poor lady might have worn them. Though there was in her face an aspect almost of terror as
she owned to her name in the stranger's presence, yet there was also about her a certain amount
of female dignity, which made Mr. Prendergast feel that it behoved him to treat her not only
with gentleness, but also with respect.

"I want to say a few words to you," said he, "in consequence of a letter I have received; perhaps
you will allow me to sit down for a minute or two."

"Certainly, sir, certainly. This is my daughter, Mary Swan; do you wish that she should leave
the room, sir?" And Mary Swan, as her mother spoke, got up and prepared to depart quietly.

"By no means, by no means," said Mr. Prendergast, putting his hand out so as to detain her.
"I would much rather that she should remain, as it may be very likely that she may assist me
in my inquiries. You will know who I am, no doubt, when I mention my name; Mr. Mollett will
have mentioned me to you--I am Mr. Prendergast."

"No, sir, he never did," said Mrs. Swan.

"Oh!" said Mr. Prendergast, having ascertained that Mr. Mollett was at any rate well known
at No. 7, Spinny Lane. "I thought that he might probably have done so. He is at home at present,
I believe?"

"Sir?" said Mary Swan senior.

"Your father is at home, I believe?" said Mr. Prendergast, turning to the younger woman.

"Sir?" said Mary Swan junior. It was clear at any rate that the women were not practised liars,
for they could not bring themselves on the spur of the moment to deny that he was in the house.

Mr. Prendergast did not wish to be confronted at present with Matthew Mollett. Such a step
might or might not be desirable before the termination of the interview; but at the present
moment he thought that he might probably learn more from the two women as they were than he
would do if Mollett were with them.

It had been acknowledged to him that Mollett was living in that house, that he was now at home,
and also that the younger woman present before him was the child of Mollett and of Mary Swan
the elder. That the young woman was older than Herbert Fitzgerald, and that therefore the connection
between Mollett and her mother must have been prior to that marriage down in Dorsetshire, he
was sure; but then it might still be possible that there had been no marriage between Mollett
and Mary Swan. If he could show that they had been man and wife when that child was born, then
would his old friend Mr. Die lose his new pupil.

"I have a letter in my pocket, Mrs. Swan, from Abraham Mollett--" Mr. Prendergast commenced,
pulling out the letter in question.

"He is nothing to me, sir," said the woman, almost in a tone of anger. "I know nothing whatever
about him."

"So I should have supposed from the respectability of your appearance, if I may be allowed
to say so."

"Nothing at all, sir; and as for that, we do try to keep ourselves respectable. But this is
a very hard world for some people to live in. It has been very hard to me and this poor girl here."

"It is a hard world to some people, and to some honest people, too,--which is harder still."

"We've always tried to be honest," said Mary Swan the elder.

"I am sure you have; and permit me to say, madam, that you will find it at the last to be the
best policy;--at the last, even as far as this world is concerned. But about this letter--I
can assure you that I have never thought of identifying you with Abraham Mollett."

"His mother was dead, sir, before ever I set eyes on him or his father; and though I tried
to do my--" and then she stopped herself suddenly. Honesty might be the best policy, but, nevertheless,
was it necessary that she should tell everything to this stranger?

"Ah, yes; Abraham's mother was dead before you were married," said Mr. Prendergast, hunting
his fox ever so craftily,--his fox whom he knew to be lying in ambush upstairs. It was of course
possible that old Mollett should slip away out of the back door and over a wall. If foxes did
not do those sort of things they would not be worth half the attention that is paid to them.
But Mr. Prendergast was well on the scent; all that a sportsman wants is good scent. He would
rather not have a view till the run comes to its close. "But," continued Mr. Prendergast, "it
is necessary that I should say a few words to you about this letter. Abraham's mother was,
I suppose, not exactly an--an educated woman?"

"I never saw her, sir."

"She died when he was very young?"

"Four years old, sir."

"And her son hardly seems to have had much education?"

"It was his own fault, sir; I sent him to school when he came to me, though, goodness knows,
sir, I was short enough of means of doing so. He had better opportunities than my own daughter
there, and though I say it myself, who ought not to say it, she is a good scholar."

"I'm sure she is,--and a very good young woman too, if I can judge by her appearance. But about
this letter. I am afraid your husband has not been so particular in his way of living as he
should have been."

"What could I do, sir? a poor weak woman!"

"Nothing; what you could do, I'm sure you did do."

"I've always kept a house over my head, though it's very humble, as you see, sir. And he has
had a morsel to eat and a cup to drink of when he has come here. It is not often that he has
troubled me this many years past."

"Mother," said Mary Swan the younger, "the gentleman won't care to know about, about all that
between you and father."

"Ah, but it is just what I do care to know."

"But, sir, father perhaps mightn't choose it."

The obedience of women to men--to those men to whom they are legally bound--is, I think, the
most remarkable trait in human nature. Nothing equals it but the instinctive loyalty of a dog.
Of course we hear of gray mares, and of garments worn by the wrong persons. Xanthippe doubtless
did live, and the character from time to time is repeated; but the rule, I think, is as I have
said.

"Mrs. Swan," said Mr. Prendergast, "I should think myself dishonest were I to worm your secrets
out of you, seeing that you are yourself so truthful and so respectable." Perhaps it may be
thought that Mr. Prendergast was a little late in looking at the matter in this light. "But
it behoves me to learn much of the early history of your husband, who is now living with you
here, and whose name, as I take it, is not Swan, but Mollett. Your maiden name probably was Swan?"

"But I was honestly married, sir, in the parish church at Putney, and that young woman was
honestly born."

"I am quite sure of it. I have never doubted it. But as I was saying, I have come here for
information about your husband, and I do not like to ask you questions off your guard,"--oh,
Mr. Prendergast!--"and therefore I think it right to tell you, that neither I nor those for
whom I am concerned have any wish to bear more heavily than we can help upon your husband,
if he will only come forward with willingness to do that which we can make him do either willingly
or unwillingly."

"But what was it about Abraham's letter, sir?"

"Well, it does not so much signify now."

"It was he sent you here, was it, sir? How has he learned where we are, Mary?" and the poor
woman turned to her daughter. "The truth is, sir, he has never known anything of us for these
twenty years, nor we of him. I have not set eyes on him for more than twenty years,--not that
I know of. And he never knew me by any other name than Swan, and when he was a child he took
me for his aunt."

"He hasn't known then that you and his father were husband and wife?"

"I have always thought he didn't, sir. But how--"

Then after all the young fox had not been so full of craft as the elder one, thought Mr. Prendergast
to himself. But nevertheless, he still liked the old fox best. There are foxes that run so
uncommonly short that you can never get a burst after them.

"I suppose, Mrs. Swan," continued Mr. Prendergast, "that you have heard the name of Fitzgerald?"

The poor woman sat silent and amazed, but after a moment the daughter answered him. "My mother,
sir, would rather that you should ask her no questions." 

In Tahiti and the adjacent islands, Moerenhout (t. i. p. 471) makes the very interesting observation,
not only that idols were often absent, but that, where they existed,
the images of the gods served merely as depositories for the proper
representatives of the divinity.



"He has behaved badly, sir, to a great many ladies," said Mrs. Swan, or Mrs. Mollett as we
may now call her.

"You are aware, are you not, that he went through a form of marriage with this lady many years
ago?" said Mr. Prendergast, almost severely.

"Let him answer for himself," said the true wife. "Mary, go upstairs, and ask your father to
come down."

CHAPTER XL

THE FOX IN HIS EARTH

Mary Swan the younger hesitated a moment before she executed her mother's order, not saying
anything, but looking doubtfully up into her mother's face. "Go, my dear," said the old woman,
"and ask your father to come down. It is no use denying him."

"None in the least," said Mr. Prendergast; and then the daughter went.

For ten minutes the lawyer and the old woman sat alone, during which time the ear of the former
was keenly alive to any steps that might be heard on the stairs or above head. Not that he
would himself have taken any active measures to prevent Mr. Mollett's escape, had such an attempt
been made. The woman could be a better witness for him than the man, and there would be no
fear of her running. Nevertheless, he was anxious that Mollett should, of his own accord, come
into his presence.

"I am sorry to keep you so long waiting, sir," said Mrs. Swan.

"It does not signify. I can easily understand that your husband should wish to reflect a little
before he speaks to me. I can forgive that."

"And, sir--"

"Well, Mrs. Mollett?"

"Are you going to do anything to punish him, sir? If a poor woman may venture to speak a word,
I would beg you on my bended knees to be merciful to him. If you would forgive him now I think
he would live honest, and be sorry for what he has done."

"He has worked terrible evil," said Mr. Prendergast solemnly. "Do you know that he has harassed
a poor gentleman into his grave?"

"Heaven be merciful to him!" said the poor woman. "But, sir, was not that his son? Was it not
Abraham Mollett who did that? Oh, sir, if you will let a poor wife speak, it is he that has
been worse than his father."

Before Mr. Prendergast had made up his mind how he would answer her, he heard the sound of
footsteps slowly descending upon the stairs. They were those of a person who stepped heavily
and feebly, and it was still a minute before the door was opened.

"Sir," said the woman. "Sir," and as she spoke she looked eagerly into his face--"Forgive us
our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us. We should all remember that, sir."

"True, Mrs. Mollett, quite true," and Mr. Prendergast rose from his chair as the door opened.

It will be remembered that Mr. Prendergast and Matthew Mollett had met once before, in the
room usually occupied by Sir Thomas Fitzgerald. On that occasion Mr. Mollett had at any rate
entered the chamber with some of the prestige of power about him. He had come to Castle Richmond
as the man having the whip hand; and though his courage had certainly fallen somewhat before
he left it, nevertheless he had not been so beaten down but what he was able to say a word
or two for himself. He had been well in health and decent in appearance, and even as he left
the room had hardly realized the absolute ruin which had fallen upon him.
