CHAPTER XXVII.  The horses were so weak and old that we soon found that it would be better
if one or two of us got out and walked.  It was an improvement.  Next, we found that it would
be better if a third man got out.  That was an improvement also.  It was at this time that
I volunteered to drive, although I had never driven a harnessed horse before and many a man
in such a position would have felt fairly excused from such a responsibility.  But in a little
while it was found that it would be a fine thing if the drive got out and walked also. It was
at this time that I resigned the position of driver, and never resumed it again.  Within the
hour, we found that it would not only be better, but was absolutely necessary, that we four,
taking turns, two at a time, should put our hands against the end of the wagon and push it
through the sand, leaving the feeble horses little to do but keep out of the way and hold up
the tongue.  Perhaps it is well for one to know his fate at first, and get reconciled to it.
We had learned ours in one afternoon.  It was plain that we had to walk through the sand and
shove that wagon and those horses two hundred miles.  So we accepted the situation, and from
that time forth we never rode.  More than that, we stood regular and nearly constant watches
pushing up behind.

We made seven miles, and camped in the desert.  Young Clagett (now member of Congress from
Montana) unharnessed and fed and watered the horses; Oliphant and I cut sagebrush, built the
fire and brought water to cook with; and old Mr. Ballou the blacksmith did the cooking.  This
division of labor, and this appointment, was adhered to throughout the journey. We had no tent,
and so we slept under our blankets in the open plain.  We were so tired that we slept soundly.

We were fifteen days making the trip--two hundred miles; thirteen, rather, for we lay by a
couple of days, in one place, to let the horses rest.

We could really have accomplished the journey in ten days if we had towed the horses behind
the wagon, but we did not think of that until it was too late, and so went on shoving the horses
and the wagon too when we might have saved half the labor.  Parties who met us, occasionally,
advised us to put the horses in the wagon, but Mr. Ballou, through whose iron-clad earnestness
no sarcasm could pierce, said that that would not do, because the provisions were exposed and
would suffer, the horses being "bituminous from long deprivation."  The reader will excuse
me from translating.  What Mr. Ballou customarily meant, when he used a long word, was a secret
between himself and his Maker.  He was one of the best and kindest hearted men that ever graced
a humble sphere of life.  He was gentleness and simplicity itself--and unselfishness, too.
Although he was more than twice as old as the eldest of us, he never gave himself any airs,
privileges, or exemptions on that account.  He did a young man's share of the work; and did
his share of conversing and entertaining from the general stand-point of any age--not from
the arrogant, overawing summit-height of sixty years.  His one striking peculiarity was his
Partingtonian fashion of loving and using big words for their own sakes, and independent of
any bearing they might have upon the thought he was purposing to convey.  He always let his
ponderous syllables fall with an easy unconsciousness that left them wholly without offensiveness.
In truth his air was so natural and so simple that one was always catching himself accepting
his stately sentences as meaning something, when they really meant nothing in the world.  If
a word was long and grand and resonant, that was sufficient to win the old man's love, and
he would drop that word into the most out-of-the-way place in a sentence or a subject, and
be as pleased with it as if it were perfectly luminous with meaning.

We four always spread our common stock of blankets together on the frozen ground, and slept
side by side; and finding that our foolish, long-legged hound pup had a deal of animal heat
in him, Oliphant got to admitting him to the bed, between himself and Mr. Ballou, hugging the
dog's warm back to his breast and finding great comfort in it.  But in the night the pup would
get stretchy and brace his feet against the old man's back and shove, grunting complacently
the while; and now and then, being warm and snug, grateful and happy, he would paw the old
man's back simply in excess of comfort; and at yet other times he would dream of the chase
and in his sleep tug at the old man's back hair and bark in his ear.  The old gentleman complained
mildly about these familiarities, at last, and when he got through with his statement he said
that such a dog as that was not a proper animal to admit to bed with tired men, because he
was "so meretricious in his movements and so organic in his emotions."  We turned the dog out.

It was a hard, wearing, toilsome journey, but it had its bright side; for after each day was
done and our wolfish hunger appeased with a hot supper of fried bacon, bread, molasses and
black coffee, the pipe-smoking, song-singing and yarn-spinning around the evening camp-fire
in the still solitudes of the desert was a happy, care-free sort of recreation that seemed
the very summit and culmination of earthly luxury.

It is a kind of life that has a potent charm for all men, whether city or country-bred.  We
are descended from desert-lounging Arabs, and countless ages of growth toward perfect civilization
have failed to root out of us the nomadic instinct.  We all confess to a gratified thrill at
the thought of "camping out."

Once we made twenty-five miles in a day, and once we made forty miles (through the Great American
Desert), and ten miles beyond--fifty in all --in twenty-three hours, without halting to eat,
drink or rest.  To stretch out and go to sleep, even on stony and frozen ground, after pushing
a wagon and two horses fifty miles, is a delight so supreme that for the moment it almost seems
cheap at the price.

We camped two days in the neighborhood of the "Sink of the Humboldt." We tried to use the strong
alkaline water of the Sink, but it would not answer.  It was like drinking lye, and not weak
lye, either.  It left a taste in the mouth, bitter and every way execrable, and a burning in
the stomach that was very uncomfortable.  We put molasses in it, but that helped it very little;
we added a pickle, yet the alkali was the prominent taste and so it was unfit for drinking.

The coffee we made of this water was the meanest compound man has yet invented. Not that "Love and
Geography" is without a Björnsonian moral, but it is amusingly, jocosely enforced in scenes
of great vivacity and theatrical effect. This time it is himself the author has chosen to satirize.
The unconscious tyranny of a man who has a mission, a life-work, is delightfully illustrated in the
person of the geographer, Professor Tygesen, to whom Björn Björnson,
the actor, when he played the part at the Christiania Theatre, had
the boldness to give his father's mask.



CHAPTER XXVIII.

After leaving the Sink, we traveled along the Humboldt river a little way.  People accustomed
to the monster mile-wide Mississippi, grow accustomed to associating the term "river" with
a high degree of watery grandeur.  Consequently, such people feel rather disappointed when
they stand on the shores of the Humboldt or the Carson and find that a "river" in Nevada is
a sickly rivulet which is just the counterpart of the Erie canal in all respects save that
the canal is twice as long and four times as deep.  One of the pleasantest and most invigorating
exercises one can contrive is to run and jump across the Humboldt river till he is overheated,
and then drink it dry.

On the fifteenth day we completed our march of two hundred miles and entered Unionville, Humboldt
county, in the midst of a driving snow-storm.  Unionville consisted of eleven cabins and a
liberty-pole. Six of the cabins were strung along one side of a deep canyon, and the other
five faced them.  The rest of the landscape was made up of bleak mountain walls that rose so
high into the sky from both sides of the canyon that the village was left, as it were, far
down in the bottom of a crevice. It was always daylight on the mountain tops a long time before
the darkness lifted and revealed Unionville.

We built a small, rude cabin in the side of the crevice and roofed it with canvas, leaving
a corner open to serve as a chimney, through which the cattle used to tumble occasionally,
at night, and mash our furniture and interrupt our sleep.  It was very cold weather and fuel
was scarce. Indians brought brush and bushes several miles on their backs; and when we could
catch a laden Indian it was well--and when we could not (which was the rule, not the exception),
we shivered and bore it.

I confess, without shame, that I expected to find masses of silver lying all about the ground.
I expected to see it glittering in the sun on the mountain summits.  I said nothing about this,
for some instinct told me that I might possibly have an exaggerated idea about it, and so if
I betrayed my thought I might bring derision upon myself.  Yet I was as perfectly satisfied
in my own mind as I could be of anything, that I was going to gather up, in a day or two, or
at furthest a week or two, silver enough to make me satisfactorily wealthy--and so my fancy
was already busy with plans for spending this money.  The first opportunity that offered, I
sauntered carelessly away from the cabin, keeping an eye on the other boys, and stopping and
contemplating the sky when they seemed to be observing me; but as soon as the coast was manifestly
clear, I fled away as guiltily as a thief might have done and never halted till I was far beyond
sight and call.  Then I began my search with a feverish excitement that was brimful of expectation--almost
of certainty. I crawled about the ground, seizing and examining bits of stone, blowing the
dust from them or rubbing them on my clothes, and then peering at them with anxious hope. 
Presently I found a bright fragment and my heart bounded!  I hid behind a boulder and polished
it and scrutinized it with a nervous eagerness and a delight that was more pronounced than
absolute certainty itself could have afforded.  The more I examined the fragment the more I
was convinced that I had found the door to fortune.  I marked the spot and carried away my
specimen.  Up and down the rugged mountain side I searched, with always increasing interest
and always augmenting gratitude that I had come to Humboldt and come in time.  Of all the experiences
of my life, this secret search among the hidden treasures of silver-land was the nearest to
unmarred ecstasy.  It was a delirious revel.

By and by, in the bed of a shallow rivulet, I found a deposit of shining yellow scales, and
my breath almost forsook me!  A gold mine, and in my simplicity I had been content with vulgar
silver!  I was so excited that I half believed my overwrought imagination was deceiving me.
Then a fear came upon me that people might be observing me and would guess my secret. Moved
by this thought, I made a circuit of the place, and ascended a knoll to reconnoiter.  Solitude.
No creature was near.  Then I returned to my mine, fortifying myself against possible disappointment,
but my fears were groundless--the shining scales were still there.  I set about scooping them
out, and for an hour I toiled down the windings of the stream and robbed its bed.  But at last
the descending sun warned me to give up the quest, and I turned homeward laden with wealth.
As I walked along I could not help smiling at the thought of my being so excited over my fragment
of silver when a nobler metal was almost under my nose.  In this little time the former had
so fallen in my estimation that once or twice I was on the point of throwing it away.

The boys were as hungry as usual, but I could eat nothing.  Neither could I talk.  I was full
of dreams and far away.  Their conversation interrupted the flow of my fancy somewhat, and
annoyed me a little, too. I despised the sordid and commonplace things they talked about. 
But as they proceeded, it began to amuse me.  It grew to be rare fun to hear them planning
their poor little economies and sighing over possible privations and distresses when a gold
mine, all our own, lay within sight of the cabin and I could point it out at any moment.  Smothered
hilarity began to oppress me, presently.  It was hard to resist the impulse to burst out with
exultation and reveal everything; but I did resist.  I said within myself that I would filter
the great news through my lips calmly and be serene as a summer morning while I watched its
effect in their faces.  I said:

"Where have you all been?"

"Prospecting."

"What did you find?"

"Nothing."

"Nothing?  What do you think of the country?"

"Can't tell, yet," said Mr. Ballou, who was an old gold miner, and had likewise had considerable
experience among the silver mines.

"Well, haven't you formed any sort of opinion?"

"Yes, a sort of a one.  It's fair enough here, may be, but overrated. Seven thousand dollar
ledges are scarce, though.

"That Sheba may be rich enough, but we don't own it; and besides, the rock is so full of base
metals that all the science in the world can't work it.  We'll not starve, here, but we'll
not get rich, I'm afraid."

"So you think the prospect is pretty poor?"

"No name for it!"

"Well, we'd better go back, hadn't we?"

"Oh, not yet--of course not.  We'll try it a riffle, first."

"Suppose, now--this is merely a supposition, you know--suppose you could find a ledge that
would yield, say, a hundred and fifty dollars a ton --would that satisfy you?"

"Try us once!" from the whole party.

"Or suppose--merely a supposition, of course--suppose you were to find a ledge that would yield
two thousand dollars a ton--would that satisfy you?"

"Here--what do you mean?  What are you coming at?  Is there some mystery behind all this?"

"Never mind.  I am not saying anything.  You know perfectly well there are no rich mines here--of
course you do.  Because you have been around and examined for yourselves.  Anybody would know
that, that had been around.  But just for the sake of argument, suppose--in a kind of general
way--suppose some person were to tell you that two-thousand-dollar ledges were simply contemptible--contemptible,
understand--and that right yonder in sight of this very cabin there were piles of pure gold
and pure silver--oceans of it--enough to make you all rich in twenty-four hours! Come!"

"I should say he was as crazy as a loon!" said old Ballou, but wild with excitement, nevertheless.

"Gentlemen," said I, "I don't say anything--I haven't been around, you know, and of course
don't know anything--but all I ask of you is to cast your eye on that, for instance, and tell
me what you think of it!" and I tossed my treasure before them.

There was an eager scramble for it, and a closing of heads together over it under the candle-light.
Then old Ballou said:

"Think of it?  I think it is nothing but a lot of granite rubbish and nasty glittering mica
that isn't worth ten cents an acre!"

So vanished my dream.  So melted my wealth away.  So toppled my airy castle to the earth and
left me stricken and forlorn.

Moralizing, I observed, then, that "all that glitters is not gold."

Mr. Ballou said I could go further than that, and lay it up among my treasures of knowledge,
that nothing that glitters is gold.  So I learned then, once for all, that gold in its native
state is but dull, unornamental stuff, and that only low-born metals excite the admiration
of the ignorant with an ostentatious glitter.  However, like the rest of the world, I still
go on underrating men of gold and glorifying men of mica.  Commonplace human nature cannot
rise above that.

CHAPTER XXIX.

True knowledge of the nature of silver mining came fast enough.  We went out "prospecting"
with Mr. Ballou.  We climbed the mountain sides, and clambered among sage-brush, rocks and
snow till we were ready to drop with exhaustion, but found no silver--nor yet any gold.  Day
after day we did this.  Now and then we came upon holes burrowed a few feet into the declivities
and apparently abandoned; and now and then we found one or two listless men still burrowing.
But there was no appearance of silver. These holes were the beginnings of tunnels, and the
purpose was to drive them hundreds of feet into the mountain, and some day tap the hidden ledge
where the silver was.  Some day!  It seemed far enough away, and very hopeless and dreary.
Day after day we toiled, and climbed and searched, and we younger partners grew sicker and
still sicker of the promiseless toil.  At last we halted under a beetling rampart of rock which
projected from the earth high upon the mountain.  Mr. Ballou broke off some fragments with
a hammer, and examined them long and attentively with a small eye-glass; threw them away and
broke off more; said this rock was quartz, and quartz was the sort of rock that contained silver.
Contained it!  I had thought that at least it would be caked on the outside of it like a kind
of veneering.  He still broke off pieces and critically examined them, now and then wetting
the piece with his tongue and applying the glass.  At last he exclaimed:

"We've got it!"

We were full of anxiety in a moment.  The rock was clean and white, where it was broken, and
across it ran a ragged thread of blue.  He said that that little thread had silver in it, mixed
with base metal, such as lead and antimony, and other rubbish, and that there was a speck or
two of gold visible.  After a great deal of effort we managed to discern some little fine yellow
specks, and judged that a couple of tons of them massed together might make a gold dollar,
possibly.  We were not jubilant, but Mr. Ballou said there were worse ledges in the world than
that.  He saved what he called the "richest" piece of the rock, in order to determine its value
by the process called the "fire-assay."  Then we named the mine "Monarch of the Mountains"
(modesty of nomenclature is not a prominent feature in the mines), and Mr. Ballou wrote out
and stuck up the following "notice," preserving a copy to be entered upon the books in the
mining recorder's office in the town.

      "NOTICE."

      "We the undersigned claim three claims, of three hundred feet each
      (and one for discovery), on this silver-bearing quartz lead or lode,
      extending north and south from this notice, with all its dips,
      spurs, and angles, variations and sinuosities, together with fifty
      feet of ground on either side for working the same."

We put our names to it and tried to feel that our fortunes were made. But when we talked the
matter all over with Mr. Ballou, we felt depressed and dubious.  He said that this surface
quartz was not all there was of our mine; but that the wall or ledge of rock called the "Monarch
of the Mountains," extended down hundreds and hundreds of feet into the earth --he illustrated
by saying it was like a curb-stone, and maintained a nearly uniform thickness-say twenty feet--away
down into the bowels of the earth, and was perfectly distinct from the casing rock on each
side of it; and that it kept to itself, and maintained its distinctive character always, no
matter how deep it extended into the earth or how far it stretched itself through and across
the hills and valleys.  He said it might be a mile deep and ten miles long, for all we knew;
and that wherever we bored into it above ground or below, we would find gold and silver in
it, but no gold or silver in the meaner rock it was cased between.  And he said that down in
the great depths of the ledge was its richness, and the deeper it went the richer it grew.
Therefore, instead of working here on the surface, we must either bore down into the rock with
a shaft till we came to where it was rich--say a hundred feet or so --or else we must go down
into the valley and bore a long tunnel into the mountain side and tap the ledge far under the
earth.  To do either was plainly the labor of months; for we could blast and bore only a few
feet a day--some five or six.  But this was not all.  He said that after we got the ore out
it must be hauled in wagons to a distant silver-mill, ground up, and the silver extracted by
a tedious and costly process.  Our fortune seemed a century away!

But we went to work.  We decided to sink a shaft.  So, for a week we climbed the mountain,
laden with picks, drills, gads, crowbars, shovels, cans of blasting powder and coils of fuse
and strove with might and main. At first the rock was broken and loose and we dug it up with
picks and threw it out with shovels, and the hole progressed very well.  But the rock became
more compact, presently, and gads and crowbars came into play.  But shortly nothing could make
an impression but blasting powder.

That was the weariest work!  One of us held the iron drill in its place and another would strike
with an eight-pound sledge--it was like driving nails on a large scale.  In the course of an
hour or two the drill would reach a depth of two or three feet, making a hole a couple of inches
in diameter.  We would put in a charge of powder, insert half a yard of fuse, pour in sand
and gravel and ram it down, then light the fuse and run.  When the explosion came and the rocks
and smoke shot into the air, we would go back and find about a bushel of that hard, rebellious
quartz jolted out.  Nothing more.  One week of this satisfied me.  I resigned. That she loves
Axel, the husband, is clear; and the probability is that she meant to avenge herself upon
him for having before his marriage used her as a decoy, when the
real object of his attention was her friend Laura.

But if such was her object, she lacked the strength of mind and hardness of heart to carry it
out, and in the end she becomes a benevolent providence, who labors for the reconciliation of
the estranged couple. She proves too noble for the ignoble rôle she had undertaken.

There were none in the camp.

We dropped the "Monarch" for the time being.

Meantime the camp was filling up with people, and there was a constantly growing excitement
about our Humboldt mines.  We fell victims to the epidemic and strained every nerve to acquire
more "feet."  We prospected and took up new claims, put "notices" on them and gave them grandiloquent
names.  We traded some of our "feet" for "feet" in other people's claims. In a little while
we owned largely in the "Gray Eagle," the "Columbiana," the "Branch Mint," the "Maria Jane,"
the "Universe," the "Root-Hog-or-Die," the "Samson and Delilah," the "Treasure Trove," the
"Golconda," the "Sultana," the "Boomerang," the "Great Republic," the "Grand Mogul," and fifty
other "mines" that had never been molested by a shovel or scratched with a pick.  We had not
less than thirty thousand "feet" apiece in the "richest mines on earth" as the frenzied cant
phrased it--and were in debt to the butcher.  We were stark mad with excitement--drunk with
happiness--smothered under mountains of prospective wealth--arrogantly compassionate toward
the plodding millions who knew not our marvellous canyon--but our credit was not good at the
grocer's.

It was the strangest phase of life one can imagine.  It was a beggars' revel.  There was nothing
doing in the district--no mining--no milling --no productive effort--no income--and not enough
money in the entire camp to buy a corner lot in an eastern village, hardly; and yet a stranger
would have supposed he was walking among bloated millionaires. Prospecting parties swarmed
out of town with the first flush of dawn, and swarmed in again at nightfall laden with spoil--rocks.
Nothing but rocks.  Every man's pockets were full of them; the floor of his cabin was littered
with them; they were disposed in labeled rows on his shelves.

CHAPTER XXX.

I met men at every turn who owned from one thousand to thirty thousand "feet" in undeveloped
silver mines, every single foot of which they believed would shortly be worth from fifty to
a thousand dollars--and as often as any other way they were men who had not twenty-five dollars
in the world.  Every man you met had his new mine to boast of, and his "specimens" ready; and
if the opportunity offered, he would infallibly back you into a corner and offer as a favor
to you, not to him, to part with just a few feet in the "Golden Age," or the "Sarah Jane,"
or some other unknown stack of croppings, for money enough to get a "square meal" with, as
the phrase went.  And you were never to reveal that he had made you the offer at such a ruinous
price, for it was only out of friendship for you that he was willing to make the sacrifice.
Then he would fish a piece of rock out of his pocket, and after looking mysteriously around
as if he feared he might be waylaid and robbed if caught with such wealth in his possession,
he would dab the rock against his tongue, clap an eyeglass to it, and exclaim:

"Look at that!  Right there in that red dirt!  See it?  See the specks of gold?  And the streak
of silver?  That's from the Uncle Abe.  There's a hundred thousand tons like that in sight!
Right in sight, mind you! And when we get down on it and the ledge comes in solid, it will
be the richest thing in the world!  Look at the assay!  I don't want you to believe me--look
at the assay!"

Then he would get out a greasy sheet of paper which showed that the portion of rock assayed
had given evidence of containing silver and gold in the proportion of so many hundreds or thousands
of dollars to the ton.

I little knew, then, that the custom was to hunt out the richest piece of rock and get it assayed!
Very often, that piece, the size of a filbert, was the only fragment in a ton that had a particle
of metal in it--and yet the assay made it pretend to represent the average value of the ton
of rubbish it came from!

On such a system of assaying as that, the Humboldt world had gone crazy. On the authority of
such assays its newspaper correspondents were frothing about rock worth four and seven thousand
dollars a ton!

And does the reader remember, a few pages back, the calculations, of a quoted correspondent,
whereby the ore is to be mined and shipped all the way to England, the metals extracted, and
the gold and silver contents received back by the miners as clear profit, the copper, antimony
and other things in the ore being sufficient to pay all the expenses incurred?  Everybody's
head was full of such "calculations" as those --such raving insanity, rather.  Few people took
work into their calculations--or outlay of money either; except the work and expenditures of
other people.
