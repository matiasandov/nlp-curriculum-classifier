A DAUGHTER OF THE LAND

CHAPTER I

THE WINGS OF MORNING

"TAKE the wings of Morning."

Kate Bates followed the narrow footpath rounding the corner of the small country church, as
the old minister raised his voice slowly and impressively to repeat the command he had selected
for his text. Fearing that her head would be level with the windows, she bent and walked swiftly
past the church; but the words went with her, iterating and reiterating themselves in her brain.
Once she paused to glance back toward the church, wondering what the minister would say in
expounding that text.  She had a fleeting thought of slipping in, taking the back seat and
listening to the sermon.  The remembrance that she had not dressed for church deterred her;
then her face twisted grimly as she again turned to the path, for it occurred to her that she
had nothing else to wear if she had started to attend church instead of going to see her brother.

As usual, she had left her bed at four o'clock; for seven hours she had cooked, washed dishes,
made beds, swept, dusted, milked, churned, following the usual routine of a big family in the
country.  Then she had gone upstairs, dressed in clean gingham and confronted her mother.

"I think I have done my share for to-day," she said.  "Suppose you call on our lady school-mistress
for help with dinner.  I'm going to Adam's."

Mrs. Bates lifted her gaunt form to very close six feet of height, looking narrowly at her
daughter.

"Well, what the nation are you going to Adam's at this time a-Sunday for?" she demanded.

"Oh, I have a curiosity to learn if there is one of the eighteen members of this family who
gives a cent what becomes of me!" answered Kate, her eyes meeting and looking clearly into
her mother's.

"You are not letting yourself think he would 'give a cent' to send you to that fool normal-thing,
are you?"

"I am not! But it wasn't a 'fool thing' when Mary and Nancy Ellen, and the older girls wanted
to go.  You even let Mary go to college two years."

"Mary had exceptional ability," said Mrs. Bates.

"I wonder how she convinced you of it. None of the rest of us can discover it," said Kate.

"What you need is a good strapping, Miss."

"I know it; but considering the facts that I am larger than you, and was eighteen in September,
I shouldn't advise you to attempt it.  What is the difference whether I was born in '62 or
'42? Give me the chance you gave Mary, and I'll prove to you that I can do anything she has
done, without having 'exceptional ability!'"

"The difference is that I am past sixty now.  I was stout as an ox when Mary wanted to go to
school.  It is your duty and your job to stay here and do this work."

"To pay for having been born last?  Not a bit more than if I had been born first.  Any girl
in the family owes you as much for life as I do; it is up to the others to pay back in service,
after they are of age, if it is to me.  I have done my share.  If Father were not the richest
farmer in the county, and one of the richest men, it would be different.  He can afford to
hire help for you, quite as well as he can for himself."

"Hire help!  Who would I get to do the work here?"

"You'd have to double your assistants.  You could not hire two women who would come here and
do so much work as I do in a day. That is why I decline to give up teaching, and stay here
to slave at your option, for gingham dresses and cowhide shoes, of your selection.  If I were
a boy, I'd work three years more and then I would be given two hundred acres of land, have
a house and barn built for me, and a start of stock given me, as every boy in this family has
had at twenty-one."

"A man is a man!  He founds a family, he runs the Government!  It is a different matter," said
Mrs. Bates.

"It surely is; in this family.  But I think, even with us, a man would have rather a difficult
proposition on his hands to found a family without a woman; or to run the Government either."

"All right!  Go on to Adam and see what you get."

"I'll have the satisfaction of knowing that Nancy Ellen gets dinner, anyway," said Kate as
she passed through the door and followed the long path to the gate, from there walking beside
the road in the direction of her brother's home.  There were many horses in the pasture and
single and double buggies in the barn; but it never occurred to Kate that she might ride: 
it was Sunday and the horses were resting.  So she followed the path beside the fences, rounded
the corner of the church and went on her way with the text from which the pastor was preaching,
hammering in her brain.  She became so absorbed in thought that she scarcely saw the footpath
she followed, while June flowered, and perfumed, and sang all around her.

She was so intent upon the words she had heard that her feet unconsciously followed a well-defined
branch from the main path leading into the woods, from the bridge, where she sat on a log,
and for the unnumbered time, reviewed her problem.  She had worked ever since she could remember.
Never in her life had she gotten to school before noon on Monday, because of the large washings.
After the other work was finished she had spent nights and mornings ironing, when she longed
to study, seldom finishing before Saturday.  Summer brought an endless round of harvesting,
canning, drying; winter brought butchering, heaps of sewing, and postponed summer work.  School
began late in the fall and closed early in spring, with teachers often inefficient; yet because
she was a close student and kept her books where she could take a peep and memorize and think
as she washed dishes and cooked, she had thoroughly mastered all the country school near her
home could teach her.  With six weeks of a summer Normal course she would be as well prepared
to teach as any of her sisters were, with the exception of Mary, who had been able to convince
her parents that she possessed two college years' worth of "ability."

Kate laid no claim to "ability," herself; but she knew she was as strong as most men, had an
ordinary brain that could be trained, and while she was far from beautiful she was equally
as far from being ugly, for her skin was smooth and pink, her eyes large and blue-gray, her
teeth even and white.  She missed beauty because her cheekbones were high, her mouth large,
her nose barely escaping a pug; but she had a real "crown of glory" in her hair, which was
silken fine, long and heavy, of sunshine-gold in colour, curling naturally around her face
and neck.  Given pure blood to paint such a skin with varying emotions, enough wind to ravel
out a few locks of such hair, the proportions of a Venus and perfect health, any girl could
rest very well assured of being looked at twice, if not oftener.

Kate sat on a log, a most unusual occurrence for her, for she was familiar only with bare,
hot houses, furnished with meagre necessities; reeking stables, barnyards and vegetable gardens.
She knew less of the woods than the average city girl; but there was a soothing wind, a sweet
perfume, a calming silence that quieted her tense mood and enabled her to think clearly; so
the review went on over years of work and petty economies, amounting to one grand aggregate
that gave to each of seven sons house, stock, and land at twenty-one; and to each of nine daughters
a bolt of muslin and a fairly decent dress when she married, as the seven older ones did speedily,
for they were fine, large, upstanding girls, some having real beauty, all  exceptionally well-trained
economists and workers.  Because her mother had the younger daughters to help in the absence
of the elder, each girl had been allowed the time and money to prepare herself to teach a country
school; all of them had taught until they married.  Nancy Ellen, the beauty of the family,
the girl next older than Kate, had taken the home school for the second winter.  Going to school
to Nancy Ellen had been the greatest trial of Kate's life, until the possibility of not going
to Normal had confronted her.

Nancy Ellen was almost as large as Kate, quite as pink, her features assembled in a manner
that made all the difference, her jet-black hair as curly as Kate's, her eyes big and dark,
her lips red.  As for looking at Kate twice, no one ever looked at her at all if Nancy Ellen
happened to be walking beside her.  Kate bore that without protest; it would have wounded her
pride to rebel openly; she did Nancy Ellen's share of the work to allow her to study and have
her Normal course; she remained at home plainly clothed to loan Nancy Ellen her best dress
when she attended Normal; but when she found that she was doomed to finish her last year at
school under Nancy Ellen, to work double so that her sister might go to school early and remain
late, coming home tired and with lessons to prepare for the morrow, some of the spontaneity
left Kate's efforts.

She had a worse grievance when Nancy Ellen hung several new dresses and a wrapper on her side
of the closet after her first pay-day, and furnished her end of the bureau with a white hair
brush and a brass box filled with pink powder, with a swan's-down puff for its application.
For three months Kate had waited and hoped that at least "thank you" would be vouchsafed her;
when it failed for that length of time she did two things:  she studied so diligently that
her father called her into the barn and told her that if before the school, she asked Nancy
Ellen another question she could not answer, he would use the buggy whip on her to within an
inch of her life. The buggy whip always had been a familiar implement to Kate, so she stopped
asking slippery questions, worked harder than ever, and spent her spare time planning what
she would hang in the closet and put on her end of the bureau when she had finished her Normal
course, and was teaching her first term of school.

Now she had learned all that Nancy Ellen could teach her, and much that Nancy Ellen never knew:
it was time for Kate to be starting away to school.  Because it was so self-evident that she
should have what the others had had, she said nothing about it until the time came; then she
found her father determined that she should remain at home to do the housework, for no compensation
other than her board and such clothes as she always had worn, her mother wholly in accord with
him, and marvel of all, Nancy Ellen quite enthusiastic on the subject.

Her father always had driven himself and his family like slaves, while her mother had ably
seconded his efforts.  Money from the sale of chickens, turkeys, butter, eggs, and garden truck
that other women of the neighbourhood used for extra clothing for themselves and their daughters
and to prettify their homes, Mrs. Bates handed to her husband to increase the amount necessary
to purchase the two hundred acres of land for each son when he came of age.  The youngest son
had farmed his land with comfortable profit and started a bank account, while his parents and
two sisters were still saving and working to finish the last payment. Kate thought with bitterness
that if this final payment had been made possibly there would have been money to spare for
her; but with that thought came the knowledge that her father had numerous investments on which
he could have realized and made the payments had he not preferred that they should be a burden
on his family.

"Take the wings of morning," repeated Kate, with all the emphasis the old minister had used.
"Hummm!  I wonder what kind of wings. Those of a peewee would scarcely do for me; I'd need
the wings of an eagle to get me anywhere, and anyway it wasn't the wings of a bird I was to
take, it was the wings of morning.  I wonder what the wings of morning are, and how I go about
taking them.  God knows where my wings come in; by the ache in my feet I seem to have walked,
mostly.  Oh, what ARE the wings of morning?"

Kate stared straight before her, sitting absorbed and motionless. Close in front of her a little
white moth fluttered over the twigs and grasses.  A kingbird sailed into view and perched on
a brush-heap preparatory to darting after the moth.  While the bird measured the distance and
waited for the moth to rise above the entangling grasses, with a sweep and a snap a smaller
bird, very similar in shape and colouring, flashed down, catching the moth and flying high
among the branches of a big tree.

"Aha!  You missed your opportunity!" said Kate to the kingbird.

She sat straighter suddenly.  "Opportunity," she repeated.  "Here is where I am threatened
with missing mine.  Opportunity!  I wonder now if that might not be another name for 'the wings
of morning.'  Morning is winging its way past me, the question is: do I sit still and let it
pass, or do I take its wings and fly away?"

Kate brooded on that awhile, then her thought formulated into words again.

"It isn't as if Mother were sick or poor, she is perfectly well and stronger than nine women
out of ten of her age; Father can afford to hire all the help she needs; there is nothing cruel
or unkind in leaving her; and as for Nancy Ellen, why does the fact that I am a few years younger
than she, make me her servant?  Why do I cook for her, and make her bed, and wash her clothes,
while she earns money to spend on herself?  And she is doing everything in her power to keep
me at it, because she likes what she is doing and what it brings her, and she doesn't give
a tinker whether I like what I am doing or not; or whether I get anything I want out of it
or not; or whether I miss getting off to Normal on time or not.  She is blame selfish, that's
what she is, so she won't like the jolt she's going to get; but it will benefit her soul, her
soul that her pretty face keeps her from developing, so I shall give her a little valuable
assistance.  Mother will be furious and Father will have the buggy whip convenient; but I am
going!  I don't know how, or when, but I am GOING.

      "Who has a thirst for knowledge, in Helicon may slake it,
      If he has still, the Roman will, to find a way, or make it."

Kate arose tall and straight and addressed the surrounding woods. "Now you just watch me 'find
a way or make it,'" she said.  "I am 'taking the wings of morning,' observe my flight!  See
me cut curves and circles and sail and soar around all the other Bates girls the Lord ever
made, one named Nancy Ellen in particular.  It must be far past noon, and I've much to do to
get ready.  I fly!"

Kate walked back to the highway, but instead of going on she turned toward home.  When she
reached the gate she saw Nancy Ellen, dressed her prettiest, sitting beneath a cherry tree
reading a book, in very plain view from the road.  As Kate came up the path:  "Hello!" said
Nancy Ellen.  "Wasn't Adam at home?"

"I don't know," answered Kate.  "I was not there."

"You weren't?  Why, where were you?" asked Nancy Ellen.

"Oh, I just took a walk!" answered Kate.

"Right at dinner time on Sunday?  Well, I'll be switched!" cried Nancy Ellen.

"Pity you weren't oftener, when you most needed it," said Kate, passing up the walk and entering
the door.  Her mother asked the same questions so Kate answered them.

"Well, I am glad you came home," said Mrs. Bates.  "There was no use tagging to Adam with a
sorry story, when your father said flatly that you couldn't go."

"But I must go!" urged Kate.  "I have as good a right to my chance as the others.  If you put
your foot down and say so, Mother, Father will let me go.  Why shouldn't I have the same chance
as Nancy Ellen? Please Mother, let me go!"

"You stay right where you are.  There is an awful summer's work before us," said Mrs. Bates.

"There always is," answered Kate.  "But now is just my chance while you have Nancy Ellen here
to help you."

"She has some special studying to do, and you very well know that she has to attend the County
Institute, and take the summer course of training for teachers."

"So do I," said Kate, stubbornly.  "You really will not help me, Mother?"

"I've said my say!  Your place is here!  Here you stay!" answered her mother.

"All right," said Kate, "I'll cross you off the docket of my hopes, and try Father."

"Well, I warn you, you had better not!  He has been nagged until his patience is lost," said
Mrs. Bates.

Kate closed her lips and started in search of her father.  She found him leaning on the pig
pen watching pigs grow into money, one of his most favoured occupations.  He scowled at her,
drawing his huge frame to full height.

"I don't want to hear a word you have to say," he said.  "You are the youngest, and your place
is in the kitchen helping your mother.  We have got the last installment to pay on Hiram's
land this summer. March back to the house and busy yourself with something useful!"

Kate looked at him, from his big-boned, weather-beaten face, to his heavy shoes, then turned
without a word and went back toward the house. She went around it to the cherry tree and with
no preliminaries said to her sister:  "Nancy Ellen, I want you to lend me enough money to fix
my clothes a little and pay my way to Normal this summer.  I can pay it all back this winter.
I'll pay every cent with interest, before I spend any on anything else."

"Why, you must be crazy!" said Nancy Ellen.

"Would I be any crazier than you, when you wanted to go?" asked Kate.

"But you were here to help Mother," said Nancy Ellen.

"And you are here to help her now," persisted Kate.

"But I've got to fix up my clothes for the County Institute," said Nancy Ellen, "I'll be gone
most of the summer."

"I have just as much right to go as you had," said Kate.

"Father and Mother both say you shall not go," answered her sister.

"I suppose there is no use to remind you that I did all in my power to help you to your chance."

"You did no more than you should have done," said Nancy Ellen.

"And this is no more than you should do for me, in the circumstances," said Kate.

"You very well know I can't!  Father and Mother would turn me out of the house," said Nancy Ellen.

"I'd be only too glad if they would turn me out," said Kate.  "You can let me have the money
if you like.  Mother wouldn't do anything but talk; and Father would not strike you, or make
you go, he always favours you."

"He does nothing of the sort!  I can't, and I won't, so there!" cried Nancy Ellen.

"'Won't,' is the real answer, 'so there,'" said Kate.

She went into the cellar and ate some cold food from the cupboard and drank a cup of milk.
Then she went to her room and looked over all of her scanty stock of clothing, laying in a
heap the pieces that needed mending.  She took the clothes basket to the wash room, which was
the front of the woodhouse, in summer; built a fire, heated water, and while making it appear
that she was putting the clothes to soak, as usual, she washed everything she had that was
fit to use, hanging the pieces to dry in the building.

"Watch me fly!" muttered Kate.  "I don't seem to be cutting those curves so very fast; but
I'm moving.  I believe now, having exhausted all home resources, that Adam is my next objective.
He is the only one in the family who ever paid the slightest attention to me, maybe he cares
a trifle what becomes of me, but Oh, how I dread Agatha! However, watch me take wing!  If Adam
fails me I have six remaining prospects among my loving brothers, and if none of them has any
feeling for me or faith in me there yet remain my seven dear brothers-in-law, before I appeal
to the tender mercies of the neighbours; but how I dread Agatha!  Yet I fly!"

CHAPTER II

AN EMBRYO MIND READER

KATE was far from physical flight as she pounded the indignation of her soul into the path
with her substantial feet.  Baffled and angry, she kept reviewing the situation as she went
swiftly on her way, regardless of dust and heat.  She could see no justice in being forced
into a position that promised to end in further humiliation and defeat of her hopes.  If she
only could find Adam at the stable, as she passed, and talk with him alone!  Secretly, she
well knew that the chief source of her dread of meeting her sister-in-law was that to her Agatha
was so funny that ridiculing her had been regarded as perfectly legitimate pastime.  For Agatha
WAS funny; but she had no idea of it, and could no more avoid it than a bee could avoid being
buzzy, so the manner in which her sisters-in-law imitated her and laughed at her, none too
secretly, was far from kind.  While she never guessed what was going on, she realized the antagonism
in their attitude and stoutly resented it.

Adam was his father's favourite son, a stalwart, fine-appearing, big man, silent, honest, and
forceful; the son most after the desires of the father's heart, yet Adam was the one son of
the seven who had ignored his father's law that all of his boys were to marry strong, healthy
young women, poor women, working women. Each of the others at coming of age had contracted
this prescribed marriage as speedily as possible, first asking father Bates, the girl afterward.
If father Bates disapproved, the girl was never asked at all.  And the reason for this docility
on the part of these big, matured men, lay wholly in the methods of father Bates. He gave those
two hundred acres of land to each of them on coming of age, and the same sum to each for the
building of a house and barn and the purchase of stock; gave it to them in words, and with
the fullest assurance that it was theirs to improve, to live on, to add to.  Each of them had
seen and handled his deed, each had to admit he never had known his father to tell a lie or
deviate the least from fairness in a deal of any kind, each had been compelled to go in the
way indicated by his father for years; but not a man of them held his own deed.  These precious
bits of paper remained locked in the big wooden chest beside the father's bed, while the land
stood on the records in his name; the taxes they paid him each year he, himself, carried to
the county clerk; so that he was the largest landholder in the county and one of the very richest
men.  It must have been extreme unction to his soul to enter the county office and ask for
the assessment on those "little parcels of land of mine."  Men treated him very deferentially,
and so did his sons.  Those documents carefully locked away had the effect of obtaining ever-ready
help to harvest his hay and wheat whenever he desired, to make his least wish quickly deferred
to, to give him authority and the power for which he lived and worked earlier, later, and harder
than any other man of his day and locality.

Adam was like him as possible up to the time he married, yet Adam was the only one of his sons
who disobeyed him; but there was a redeeming feature.  Adam married a slender tall slip of
a woman, four years his senior, who had been teaching in the Hartley schools when he began
courting her.  She was a prim, fussy woman, born of a prim father and a fussy mother, so what
was to be expected?  Her face was narrow and set, her body and her movements almost rigid,
her hair, always parted, lifted from each side and tied on the crown, fell in stiff little
curls, the back part hanging free.  Her speech, as precise as her movements, was formed into
set habit through long study of the dictionary.  She was born antagonistic to whatever existed,
no matter what it was.  So surely as every other woman agreed on a dress, a recipe, a house,
anything whatever, so surely Agatha thought out and followed a different method, the disconcerting
thing about her being that she usually finished any undertaking with less exertion, ahead of
time, and having saved considerable money.

She could have written a fine book of synonyms, for as certainly as any one said anything in
her presence that she had occasion to repeat, she changed the wording to six-syllabled mouthfuls,
delivered with ponderous circumlocution.  She subscribed to papers and magazines, which she
read and remembered.  And she danced! When other women thought even a waltz immoral and shocking;
perfectly stiff, her curls exactly in place, Agatha could be seen, and frequently was seen,
waltzing on the front porch in the arms of, and to a tune whistled by young Adam, whose full
name was Adam Alcibiades Bates.  In his younger days, when discipline had been required, Kate
once had heard her say to the little fellow:  "Adam Alcibiades ascend these steps and proceed
immediately to your maternal ancestor."

Kate thought of this with a dry smile as she plodded on toward Agatha's home hoping she could
see her brother at the barn, but she knew that most probably she would "ascend the steps and
proceed to the maternal ancestor," of Adam Bates 3d.  Then she would be forced to explain her
visit and combat both Adam and his wife; for Agatha was not a nonentity like her collection
of healthful, hard-working sisters-in-law.  Agatha worked if she chose, and she did not work
if she did not choose. Mostly she worked and worked harder than any one ever thought.  She
had a habit of keeping her house always immaculate, finishing her cleaning very early and then
reading in a conspicuous spot on the veranda when other women were busy with their most tiresome
tasks. Such was Agatha, whom Kate dreaded meeting, with every reason, for Agatha, despite curls,
bony structure, language, and dance, was the most powerful factor in the whole Bates family
with her father-in-law; and all because when he purchased the original two hundred acres for
Adam, and made the first allowance for buildings and stock, Agatha slipped the money from Adam's
fingers in some inexplainable way, and spent it all for stock; because forsooth! Agatha was
an only child, and her prim father endowed her, she said so herself, with three hundred acres
of land, better in location and more fertile than that given to Adam, land having on it a roomy
and comfortable brick house, completely furnished, a large barn and also stock; so that her
place could be used to live on and farm, while Adam's could be given over to grazing herds
of cattle which he bought cheaply, fattened and sold at the top of the market.

If each had brought such a farm into the family with her, father Bates could have endured six
more prim, angular, becurled daughters-in-law, very well indeed, for land was his one and only
God.  His respect for Agatha was markedly very high, for in addition to her farm he secretly
admired her independence of thought and action, and was amazed by the fact that she was about
her work when several of the blooming girls he had selected for wives for his sons were confined
to the sofa with a pain, while not one of them schemed, planned, connived with her husband
and piled up the money as Agatha did, therefore she stood at the head of the women of the Bates
family; while she was considered to have worked miracles in the heart of Adam Bates, for with
his exception no man of the family ever had been seen to touch a woman, either publicly or
privately, to offer the slightest form of endearment, assistance or courtesy.  "Women are to
work and to bear children," said the elder Bates.  "Put them at the first job when they are
born, and at the second at eighteen, and keep them hard at it."

At their rate of progression several of the Bates sons and daughters would produce families
that, with a couple of pairs of twins, would equal the sixteen of the elder Bates; but not
so Agatha.  She had one son of fifteen and one daughter of ten, and she said that was all she
intended to have, certainly it was all she did have; but she further aggravated matters by
announcing that she had had them because she wanted them; at such times as she intended to;
and that she had the boy first and five years the older, so that he could look after his sister
when they went into company.  Also she walked up and sat upon Adam's lap whenever she chose,
ruffled his hair, pulled his ears, and kissed him squarely on the mouth, with every appearance
of having help, while the dance on the front porch with her son or daughter was of daily occurrence.
And anything funnier than Agatha, prim and angular with never a hair out of place, stiffly
hopping "Money Musk" and "Turkey In The Straw," or the "Blue Danube" waltz, anything funnier
than that, never happened.  But the two Adams, Jr. and 3d, watched with reverent and adoring
eyes, for she was MOTHER, and no one else on earth rested so high in their respect as the inflexible
woman they lived with.  That she was different from all the other women of her time and location
was hard on the other women.  Had they been exactly right, they would have been exactly like her.

So Kate, thinking all these things over, her own problem acutely "advanced and proceeded."
She advanced past the closed barn, and stock in the pasture, past the garden flaming June,
past the dooryard, up the steps, down the hall, into the screened back porch dining room and
"proceeded" to take a chair, while the family finished the Sunday night supper, at which they
were seated.  Kate was not hungry and she did not wish to trouble her sister-in-law to set
another place, so she took the remaining chair, against the wall, behind Agatha, facing Adam,
3d, across the table, and with Adam Jr., in profile at the head, and little Susan at the foot.
Then she waited her chance.  Being tired and aggressive she did not wait long.

"I might as well tell you why I came," she said bluntly.  "Father won't give me money to go
to Normal, as he has all the others.  He says I have got to stay at home and help Mother."

"Well, Mother is getting so old she needs help," said Adam, Jr., as he continued his supper.

"Of course she is," said Kate.  "We all know that.  But what is the matter with Nancy Ellen
helping her, while I take my turn at Normal? There wasn't a thing I could do last summer to
help her off that I didn't do, even to lending her my best dress and staying at home for six
Sundays because I had nothing else fit to wear where I'd be seen."

No one said a word.  Kate continued:  "Then Father secured our home school for her and I had
to spend the winter going to school to her, when you very well know that I always studied harder,
and was ahead of her, even after she'd been to Normal.  And I got up early and worked late,
and cooked, and washed, and waited on her, while she got her lessons and reports ready, and
fixed up her nice new clothes, and now she won't touch the work, and she is doing all she can
to help Father keep me from going."

"I never knew Father to need much help on anything he made up his mind to," said Adam.

Kate sat very tense.  She looked steadily at her brother, but he looked quite as steadily at
his plate.  The back of her sister-in-law was fully as expressive as her face.  Her head was
very erect, her shoulders stiff and still, not a curl moved as she poured Adam's tea and Susan's
milk.  Only Adam, 3d, looked at Kate with companionable eyes, as if he might feel a slight
degree of interest or sympathy, so she found herself explaining directly to him.

"Things are blame unfair in our family, anyway!" she said, bitterly. "You have got to be born
a boy to have any chance worth while; if you are a girl it is mighty small, and if you are
the youngest, by any mischance, you have none at all.  I don't want to harp things over; but
I wish you would explain to me why having been born a few years after Nancy Ellen makes me
her slave, and cuts me out of my chance to teach, and to have some freedom and clothes. They
might as well have told Hiram he was not to have any land and stay at home and help Father
because he was the youngest boy; it would have been quite as fair; but nothing like that happens
to the boys of this family, it is always the girls who get left.  I have worked for years,
knowing every cent I saved and earned above barely enough to cover me, would go to help pay
for Hiram's land and house and stock; but he wouldn't turn a hand to help me, neither will
any of the rest of you."

"Then what are you here for?" asked Adam.

"Because I am going to give you, and every other brother and sister I have, the chance to REFUSE
to loan me enough to buy a few clothes and pay my way to Normal, so I can pass the examinations,
and teach this fall.  And when you have all refused, I am going to the neighbours, until I
find someone who will loan me the money I need.  A hundred dollars would be plenty.  I could
pay it back with two months' teaching, with any interest you say."

Kate paused, short of breath, her eyes blazing, her cheeks red. Adam went steadily on with
his supper.  Agatha appeared stiffer and more uncompromising in the back than before, which
Kate had not thought possible.  But the same dull red on the girl's cheeks had begun to burn
on the face of young Adam. Suddenly he broke into a clear laugh.

"Oh, Ma, you're too funny!" he cried.  "I can read your face like a book.  I bet you ten dollars
I can tell you just word for word what you are going to say.  I dare you let me!  You know
I can!" Still laughing, his eyes dancing, a picture to see, he stretched his arm across the
table toward her, and his mother adored him, however she strove to conceal the fact from him.

"Ten dollars!" she scoffed.  "When did we become so wealthy?  I'll give you one dollar if you
tell me exactly what I was going to say."

The boy glanced at his father.  "Oh this is too easy!" he cried. "It's like robbing the baby's
bank!"  And then to his mother: "You were just opening your lips to say:  'Give it to her!
If you don't, I will!' And you are even a little bit more of a brick than usual to do it. It's
a darned shame the way all of them impose on Kate."

There was a complete change in Agatha's back.  Adam, Jr., laid down his fork and stared at
his wife in deep amazement.  Adam, 3d, stretched his hand farther toward his mother.  "Give
me that dollar!" he cajoled.

"Well, I am not concealing it in the sleeve of my garments," she said. "If I have one, it is
reposing in my purse, in juxtaposition to the other articles that belong there, and if you
receive it, it will be bestowed upon you when I deem the occasion suitable."

Young Adam's fist came down with a smash.  "I get the dollar!" he triumphed.  "I TOLD you so!
I KNEW she was going to say it! Ain't I a dandy mind reader though?  But it is bully for you,
Father, because of course, if Mother wouldn't let Kate have it, you'd HAVE to; but if you DID
it might make trouble with your paternal land-grabber, and endanger your precious deed that
you hope to get in the sweet by-and-by.  But if Mother loans the money, Grandfather can't say
a word, because it is her very own, and didn't cost him anything, and he always agrees with
her anyway!  Hurrah for hurrah, Kate!  Nancy Ellen may wash her own petticoat in the morning,
while I take you to the train.  You'll let me, Father?  You did let me go to Hartley alone,
once.  I'll be careful!  I won't let a thing happen.  I'll come straight home. And oh, my dollar,
you and me; I'll put you in the bank and let you grow to three!"

"You may go," said his father, promptly.

"You shall proceed according to your Aunt Katherine's instructions," said his mother, at the
same time.

"Katie, get your carpet-sack!  When do we start?" demanded young Adam.

"Morning will be all right with me, you blessed youngun," said Kate, "but I don't own a telescope
or anything to put what little I have in, and Nancy Ellen never would spare hers; she will
want to go to County Institute before I get back."

"You may have mine," said Agatha.  "You are perfectly welcome to take it wherever your peregrinations
lead you, and return it when you please.  I shall proceed to my chamber and formulate your
check immediately.  You are also welcome to my best hat and cape, and any of my clothing or
personal adornments you can use to advantage."

"Oh, Agatha, I wish you were as big as a house, like me," said Kate, joyfully.  "I couldn't
possibly crowd into anything you wear, but it would almost tickle me to death to have Nancy
Ellen know you let me take your things, when she won't even offer me a dud of her old stuff;
I never remotely hoped for any of the new."

"You shall have my cape and hat, anyway.  The cape is new and very fashionable.  Come upstairs
and try the hat," said Agatha.

The cape was new and fashionable as Agatha had said; it would not fasten at the neck, but there
would be no necessity that it should during July and August, while it would improve any dress
it was worn with on a cool evening.  The hat Kate could not possibly use with her large, broad
face and mass of hair, but she was almost as pleased with the offer as if the hat had been
most becoming.  Then Agatha brought out her telescope, in which Kate laid the cape while Agatha
wrote her a check for one hundred and twenty dollars, and told her where and how to cash it.
The extra twenty was to buy a pair of new walking shoes, some hose, and a hat, before she went
to her train.  When they went downstairs Adam, Jr., had a horse hitched and Adam, 3d, drove
her to her home, where, at the foot of the garden, they took one long survey of the landscape
and hid the telescope behind the privet bush.  Then Adam drove away quietly, Kate entered the
dooryard from the garden, and soon afterward went to the wash room and hastily ironed her clothing.

Nancy Ellen had gone to visit a neighbour girl, so Kate risked her remaining until after church
in the evening.  She hurried to their room and mended all her own clothing she had laid out.
Then she deliberately went over Nancy Ellen's and helped herself to a pair of pretty nightdresses,
such as she had never owned, a white embroidered petticoat, the second best white dress, and
a most becoming sailor hat. These she made into a parcel and carried to the wash room, brought
in the telescope and packed it, hiding it under a workbench and covering it with shavings.
After that she went to her room and wrote a note, and then slept deeply until the morning call.
She arose at once and went to the wash room but instead of washing the family clothing, she
took a bath in the largest tub, and washed her hair to a state resembling spun gold. During
breakfast she kept sharp watch down the road.  When she saw Adam, 3d, coming she stuck her
note under the hook on which she had seen her father hang his hat all her life, and carrying
the telescope in the clothes basket covered with a rumpled sheet, she passed across the yard
and handed it over the fence to Adam, climbed that same fence, and they started toward Hartley.

Kate put the sailor hat on her head, and sat very straight, an anxious line crossing her forehead.
She was running away, and if discovered, there was the barest chance that her father might
follow, and make a most disagreeable scene, before the train pulled out.  He had gone to a
far field to plow corn and Kate fervently hoped he would plow until noon, which he did.  Nancy
Ellen washed the dishes, and went into the front room to study, while Mrs. Bates put on her
sunbonnet and began hoeing the potatoes.  Not one of the family noticed that Monday's wash
was not on the clothes line as usual.  Kate and Adam drove as fast as they dared, and on reaching
town, cashed the check, decided that Nancy Ellen's hat would serve, thus saving the price of
a new one for emergencies that might arise, bought the shoes, and went to the depot, where
they had an anxious hour to wait.

"I expect Grandpa will be pretty mad," said Adam.

"I am sure there is not the slightest chance but that he will be," said Kate.

"Dare you go back home when school is over?" he asked.

"Probably not," she answered.

"What will you do?" he questioned.

"When I investigated sister Nancy Ellen's bureau I found a list of the School Supervisors of
the county, so I am going to put in my spare time writing them about my qualifications to teach
their schools this winter.  All the other girls did well and taught first-class schools, I
shall also.  I am not a bit afraid but that I may take my choice of several.  When I finish
it will be only a few days until school begins, so I can go hunt my boarding place and stay there."

"Mother would let you stay at our house," said Adam.

"Yes, I think she would, after yesterday; but I don't want to make trouble that might extend
to Father and your father.  I had better keep away."

"Yes, I guess you had," said Adam. "If Grandfather rows, he raises a racket.  But maybe he won't!"

"Maybe!  Wouldn't you like to see what happens when Mother come in from the potatoes and Nancy
Ellen comes out from the living room, and Father comes to dinner, all about the same time?"

Adam laughed appreciatively.

"Wouldn't I just!" he cried.  "Kate, you like my mother, don't you?"

"I certainly do!  She has been splendid.  I never dreamed of such a thing as getting the money
from her."

"I didn't either," said Adam, "until--I became a mind reader."

Kate looked straight into his eyes.

"How about that, Adam?" she asked.

Adam chuckled.  "She didn't intend to say a word.  She was going to let the Bateses fight it
out among themselves.  Her mouth was shut so tight it didn't look as if she could open it if
she wanted to.  I thought it would be better for you to borrow the money from her, so Father
wouldn't get into a mess, and I knew how fine she was, so I just SUGGESTED it to her.  That's all!"

"Adam, you're a dandy!" cried Kate.

"I am having a whole buggy load of fun, and you ought to go," said he. "It's all right!  Don't
you worry!  I'll take care of you."

"Why, thank you, Adam!" said Kate.  "That is the first time any one ever offered to take care
of me in my life.  With me it always has been pretty much of a 'go-it-alone' proposition."

"What of Nancy Ellen's did you take?" he asked.  "Why didn't you get some gloves?  Your hands
are so red and work-worn.  Mother's never look that way."

"Your mother never has done the rough field work I do, and I haven't taken time to be careful.
They do look badly.  I wish I had taken a pair of the lady's gloves; but I doubt if she would
have survived that. I understand that one of the unpardonable sins is putting on gloves belonging
to any one else."

Then the train came and Kate climbed aboard with Adam's parting injunction in her ears:  "Sit
beside an open window on this side!"

So she looked for and found the window and as she seated herself she saw Adam on the outside
and leaned to speak to him again. Just as the train started he thrust his hand inside, dropped
his dollar on her lap, and in a tense whisper commanded her:  "Get yourself some gloves!" Then
he ran.

Kate picked up the dollar, while her eyes dimmed with tears.

"Why, the fine youngster!" she said.  "The Jim-dandy fine youngster!"

Adam could not remember when he ever had been so happy as he was driving home.  He found his
mother singing, his father in a genial mood, so he concluded that the greatest thing in the
world to make a whole family happy was to do something kind for someone else. But he reflected
that there would be far from a happy family at his grandfather's; and he was right.  Grandmother
Bates came in from her hoeing at eleven o'clock tired and hungry, expecting to find the wash
dry and dinner almost ready.  There was no wash and no odour of food. She went to the wood-shed
and stared unbelievingly at the cold stove, the tubs of soaking clothes.

She turned and went into the kitchen, where she saw no signs of Kate or of dinner, then she
lifted up her voice and shouted: "Nancy Ellen!"

Nancy Ellen came in a hurry.  "Why, Mother, what is the matter?" she cried.

"Matter, yourself!" exclaimed Mrs. Bates.  "Look in the wash room! Why aren't the clothes on
the line?  Where is that good-for-nothing Kate?"

Nancy Ellen went to the wash room and looked.  She came back pale and amazed.  "Maybe she is
sick," she ventured. "She never has been; but she might be!  Maybe she has lain down."

"On Monday morning!  And the wash not out!  You simpleton!" cried Mrs. Bates.

Nancy Ellen hurried upstairs and came back with bulging eyes.

"Every scrap of her clothing is gone, and half of mine!"

"She's gone to that fool Normal-thing!  Where did she get the money?" cried Mrs. Bates.

"I don't know!" said Nancy Ellen.  "She asked me yesterday, but of course I told her that so
long as you and Father decided she was not to go, I couldn't possibly lend her the money."

"Did you look if she had taken it?"

Nancy Ellen straightened.  "Mother!  I didn't need do that!"

"You said she took your clothes," said Mrs. Bates.

"I had hers this time last year.  She'll bring back clothes."

"Not here, she won't!  Father will see that she never darkens these doors again.  This is the
first time in his life that a child of his has disobeyed him."

"Except Adam, when he married Agatha; and he strutted like a fighting cock about that."

"Well, he won't 'strut' about this, and you won't either, even if you are showing signs of
standing up for her.  Go at that wash, while I get dinner."

Dinner was on the table when Adam Bates hung his hat on its hook and saw the note for him.
He took it down and read:

FATHER:  I have gone to Normal.  I borrowed the money of a woman who was willing to trust me
to pay it back as soon as I earned it. Not Nancy Ellen, of course.  She would not even loan
me a pocket handkerchief, though you remember I stayed at home six weeks last summer to let
her take what she wanted of mine.  Mother:  I think you can get Sally Whistler to help you
as cheaply as any one and that she will do very well.  Nancy Ellen:  I have taken your second
best hat and a few of your things, but not half so many as I loaned you.  I hope it makes you
mad enough to burst.  I hope you get as mad and stay as mad as I have been most of this year
while you taught me things you didn't know yourself; and I cooked and washed for you so you
could wear fine clothes and play the lady.  KATE

Adam Bates read that note to himself, stretching every inch of his six feet six, his face a
dull red, his eyes glaring.  Then he turned to his wife and daughter.

"Is Kate gone?  Without proper clothing and on borrowed money," he demanded.

"I don't know," said Mrs. Bates.  "I was hoeing potatoes all forenoon."

"Listen to this," he thundered.  Then he slowly read the note aloud. But someway the spoken
words did not have the same effect as when he read them mentally in the first shock of anger.
When he heard his own voice read off the line, "I hope it makes you mad enough to burst," there
was a catch and a queer gurgle in his throat.  Mrs. Bates gazed at him anxiously.  Was he so
surprised and angry he was choking?  Might it be a stroke?  It was!  It was a master stroke.
He got no farther than "taught me things you didn't know yourself," when he lowered the sheet,
threw back his head and laughed as none of his family ever had seen him laugh in his life;
laughed and laughed until his frame was shaken and the tears rolled.  Finally he looked at
the dazed Nancy Ellen.  "Get Sally Whistler, nothing!" he said.  "You hustle your stumps and
do for your mother what Kate did while you were away last summer. And if you have any common
decency send your sister as many of your best things as you had of hers, at least.  Do you
hear me?"

CHAPTER III

PEREGRINATIONS

"PEREGRINATIONS," laughed Kate, turning to the window to hide her face. "Oh, Agatha, you are
a dear, but you are too funny!  Even a Fourth of July orator would not have used that word.
I never heard it before in all of my life outside spelling-school."

Then she looked at the dollar she was gripping and ceased to laugh.

"The dear lad," she whispered.  "He did the whole thing.  She was going to let us 'fight it
out'; I could tell by her back, and Adam wouldn't have helped me a cent, quite as much because
he didn't want to as because Father wouldn't have liked it.  Fancy the little chap knowing
he can wheedle his mother into anything, and exactly how to go about it!  I won't spend a penny
on myself until she is paid, and then I'll make her a present of something nice, just to let
her and Nancy Ellen see that I appreciate being helped to my chance, for I had reached that
point where I would have walked to school and worked in somebody's kitchen, before I'd have
missed my opportunity.  I could have done it; but this will be far pleasanter and give me a
much better showing."

Then Kate began watching the people in the car with eager curiosity, for she had been on a
train only twice before in her life.  She decided that she was in a company of young people
and some even of middle age, going to Normal.  She also noticed that most of them were looking
at her with probably the same interest she found in them.  Then at one of the stations a girl
asked to sit with her and explained that she was going to Normal, so Kate said she was also. "I
cannot conceive such a thing possible. Dear me! How strange to think of anything out of the common
happening there!"

The tone and the laugh hurt him.

"Indeed," said he, gravely, "except for that I should have made my appearance here long ago."

"You
are very kind. And I assure you, I am grateful that you did not entirely forget me." Her tone
was mocking, but her look was so guileless as almost to make him disbelieve his ears.

"I assure you, Miss Mollie," said he, earnestly, "you do me injustice. I was so closely engaged
that I was not even aware of your departure until the second day afterward."

He meant this to show how serious were the matters which claimed his attention. To him it was
the strongest possible proof of their urgency. But she remembered her exultant ride to Red
Wing, and said to-herself, "And he did not think of me for two whole
days!"

As she listened to his voice, her heart had been growing soft despite her; but it was hard enough
now. So she smiled artlessly, and said:

"Only two days? Why, Mr. Le Moyne, I thought it was two weeks. That was how I excused you. Charles
said you were too busy to ride with me; your mother wrote that you were too busy to ask after
me; and I supposed you had been too busy to think of me, ever since."

"Now, Miss Mollie," said he, in a tone of earnest remonstrance, "please do not speak in that
way. Things of the utmost importance have occurred, and I came over this evening to tell you
of them. You, perhaps, think that I have been neglectful."

"I had no right to demand anything from Mr. Le Moyne."

"Yes, you had, Miss Ainslie," said he, rising and going around the table until he stood close
beside her.

"You know that only the most pressing necessity could excuse me for
allowing you to leave my house unattended."

"That is the way I went there," she interrupted, as she looked up
at him, laughing saucily.

"But that was before you had, at my request, risked your life in behalf of my child. Let us not
hide the truth, Miss Ainslie. We can never go back to the relation of mere acquaintanceship
we held before that night. If you had gone away the next morning it might have been different,
but every hour afterward increased my obligations to you. I came here to tell you why I had seemed
to neglect them. Will you allow me to do so?"

"It is quite needless, because there is no obligation--none in the least--unless it be to you
for generous hospitality and care and a pleasant respite from tedious
duty."

"Why do you say that? You cannot think it is so," he said,
impetuously. "You know it was my duty to have attended you hither,
to have offered my services in that trying time, and by my presence
and counsel saved you such annoyance as I might. You know that I could
not have been unaware of this duty, and you dare not deny that you
expected me to follow you very speedily after your departure."

"Mr.
Le Moyne," she said, rising, with flushed cheeks and flashing eyes,
"you have no right to address such language to me! It was bad enough
to leave me to face danger and trouble and horror alone; but not so
bad as to come here and say such things. But I am not ashamed to let
you know that you are right. I did expect you, Hesden Le Moyne. As
I came along the road and thought of the terrors which the night might
bring, I said to myself that before the sun went down you would be
here, and would counsel and protect the girl who had not shrunk from
danger when you asked her to face it, and who had come to look upon
you as the type of chivalry. Because I thought you better and braver
and nobler than you are, I am not ashamed to confess what I expected.
I know it was foolish. I might have known better.

In acute discomfort and with a sore heart, Kate passed her first six weeks away from home.
She wrote to each man on the list of school directors she had taken from Nancy Ellen's desk.
Some answered that they had their teachers already engaged, others made no reply.  One bright
spot was the receipt of a letter from Nancy Ellen saying she was sending her best dress, to
be very careful of it, and if Kate would let her know the day she would be home she would meet
her at the station. Kate sent her thanks, wore the dress to two lectures, and wrote the letter
telling when she would return.

As the time drew nearer she became sickeningly anxious about a school. What if she failed in
securing one?  What if she could not pay back Agatha's money?  What if she had taken "the wings
of morning," and fallen in her flight?  In desperation she went to the Superintendent of the
Normal and told him her trouble.  He wrote her a fine letter of recommendation and she sent
it to one of the men from whom she had not heard, the director of a school in the village of
Walden, seven miles east of Hartley, being seventeen miles from her home, thus seeming to Kate
a desirable location, also she knew the village to be pretty and the school one that paid well.
Then she finished her work the best she could, and disappointed and anxious, entered the train
for home.

When the engine whistled at the bridge outside Hartley Kate arose, lifted her telescope from
the rack overhead, and made her way to the door, so that she was the first person to leave
the car when it stopped.  As she stepped to the platform she had a distinct shock, for her
father reached for the telescope, while his greeting and his face were decidedly friendly,
for him.  As they walked down the street Kate was trying wildly to think of the best thing
to say when he asked if she had a school.  But he did not ask.  Then she saw in the pocket
of his light summer coat a packet of letters folded inside a newspaper, and there was one long,
official-looking envelope that stood above the others far enough that she could see "Miss K--"
of the address. Instantly she decided that it was her answer from the School Director of Walden
and she was tremblingly eager to see it.  She thought an instant and then asked:  "Have you
been to the post office?"

"Yes, I got the mail," he answered.

"Will you please see if there are any letters for me?" she asked.

"When we get home," he said.  "I am in a hurry now.  Here's a list of things Ma wants, and
don't be all day about getting them."

Kate's lips closed to a thin line and her eyes began to grow steel coloured and big.  She dragged
back a step and looked at the loosely swaying pocket again.  She thought intently a second.
As they passed several people on the walk she stepped back of her father and gently raised
the letter enough to see that the address was to her.  Instantly she lifted it from the others,
slipped it up her dress sleeve, and again took her place beside her father until they reached
the store where her mother did her shopping. Then he waited outside while Kate hurried in,
and ripping open the letter, found a contract ready for her to sign for the Walden school.
The salary was twenty dollars a month more than Nancy Ellen had received for their country
school the previous winter and the term four months longer.

Kate was so delighted she could have shouted.  Instead she went with all speed to the stationery
counter and bought an envelope to fit the contract, which she signed, and writing a hasty note
of thanks she mailed the letter in the store mail box, then began her mother's purchases. 
This took so much time that her father came into the store before she had finished, demanding
that she hurry, so in feverish haste she bought what was wanted and followed to the buggy.
On the road home she began to study her father; she could see that he was well pleased over
something but she had no idea what could have happened; she had expected anything from verbal
wrath to the buggy whip, so she was surprised, but so happy over having secured such a good
school, at higher wages than Nancy Ellen's, that she spent most of her time thinking of herself
and planning as to when she would go to Walden, where she would stay, how she would teach,
and Oh, bliss unspeakable, what she would do with so much money; for two month's pay would
more than wipe out her indebtedness to Agatha, and by getting the very cheapest board she could
endure, after that she would have over three fourths of her money to spend each month for books
and clothes.  She was intently engaged with her side of the closet and her end of the bureau,
when she had her first glimpse of home; even preoccupied as she was, she saw a difference.
Several loose pickets in the fence had been nailed in place.  The lilac beside the door and
the cabbage roses had been trimmed, so that they did not drag over the walk, while the yard
had been gone over with a lawn-mower.

Kate turned to her father.  "Well, for land's sake!" she said.  "I wanted a lawn-mower all
last summer, and you wouldn't buy it for me.  I wonder why you got it the minute I was gone."

"I got it because Nancy Ellen especially wanted it, and she has been a mighty good girl all
summer," he said.

"If that is the case, then she should be rewarded with the privilege of running a lawn-mower,"
said Kate.

Her father looked at her sharply; but her face was so pleasant he decided she did not intend
to be saucy, so he said:  "No doubt she will be willing to let you help her all you want to."

"Not the ghost of a doubt about that," laughed Kate, "and I always wanted to try running one,
too.  They look so nice in pictures, and how one improves a place!  I hardly know this is home.
Now if we only had a fresh coat of white paint we could line up with the neighbours."

"I have been thinking about that," said Mr. Bates, and Kate glanced at him, doubting her hearing.

He noticed her surprise and added in explanation:  "Paint every so often saves a building.
It's good economy."

"Then let's economize immediately," said Kate.  "And on the barn, too. It is even more weather-beaten
than the house."

"I'll see about it the next time I go to town," said Mr. Bates; so Kate entered the house prepared
for anything and wondering what it all meant for wherever she looked everything was shining
the brightest that scrubbing and scouring could make it shine, the best of everything was out
and in use; not that it was much, but it made a noticeable difference.  Her mother greeted
her pleasantly, with a new tone of voice, while Nancy Ellen was transformed.  Kate noticed
that, immediately.  She always had been a pretty girl, now she was beautiful, radiantly beautiful,
with a new shining beauty that dazzled Kate as she looked at her.  No one offered any explanation
while Kate could see none.  At last she asked:  "What on earth has happened?  I don't understand."

"Of course you don't," laughed Nancy Ellen.  "You thought you ran the whole place and did everything
yourself, so I thought I'd just show you how things look when I run them."

"You are a top-notcher," said Kate.  "Figuratively and literally, I offer you the palm.  Let
the good work go on!  I highly approve; but I don't see how you found time to do all this and
go to Institute."

"I didn't go to Institute," said Nancy Ellen.

"You didn't!  But you must!" cried Kate.

"Oh must I?  Well, since you have decided to run your affairs as you please, in spite of all
of us, just suppose you let me run mine the same way.  Only, I rather enjoy having Father and
Mother approve of what I do."

Kate climbed the stairs with this to digest as she went; so while she put away her clothing
she thought things over, but saw no light.  She would go to Adam's to return the telescope
to-morrow, possibly he could tell her.  As she hung her dresses in the closet and returned
Nancy Ellen's to their places she was still more amazed, for there hung three pretty new wash
dresses, one of a rosy pink that would make Nancy Ellen appear very lovely.

What was the reason, Kate wondered.  The Bates family never did anything unless there was some
purpose in it, what was the purpose in this?  And Nancy Ellen had not gone to Institute.  She
evidently had worked constantly and hard, yet she was in much sweeter frame of mind than usual.
She must have spent almost all she had saved from her school on new clothes.  Kate could not
solve the problem, so she decided to watch and wait.  She also waited for someone to say something
about her plans, but no one said a word, so after waiting all evening Kate decided that they
would ask before they learned anything from her.  She took her place as usual, and the work
went on as if she had not been away; but she was happy, even in her bewilderment.

If her father noticed the absence of the letter she had slipped from his pocket he said nothing
about it as he drew the paper and letters forth and laid them on the table.  Kate had a few
bad minutes while this was going on, she was sure he hesitated an instant and looked closely
at the letters he sorted; but when he said nothing, she breathed deeply in relief and went
on being joyous.  It seemed to her that never had the family been in such a good-natured state
since Adam had married Agatha and her three hundred acres with house, furniture, and stock.
She went on in ignorance of what had happened until after Sunday dinner the following day.
Then she had planned to visit Agatha and Adam.  It was very probable that it was because she
was dressing for this visit that Nancy Ellen decided on Kate's enlightenment, for she could
not have helped seeing that her sister was almost stunned at times.

Kate gave her a fine opening.  As she stood brushing her wealth of gold with full-length sweeps
of her arm, she was at an angle that brought her facing the mirror before which Nancy Ellen
sat training waves and pinning up loose braids.  Her hair was beautiful and she slowly smiled
at her image as she tried different effects of wave, loose curl, braids high piled or flat.
Across her bed lay a dress that was a reproduction of one that she had worn for three years,
but a glorified reproduction. The original dress had been Nancy Ellen's first departure from
the brown and gray gingham which her mother always had purchased because it would wear well,
and when from constant washing it faded to an exact dirt colour it had the advantage of providing
a background that did not show the dirt.  Nancy Ellen had earned the money for a new dress
by raising turkeys, so when the turkeys went to town to be sold, for the first time in her
life Nancy Ellen went along to select the dress.  No one told her what kind of dress to get,
because no one imagined that she would dare buy any startling variation from what always had
been provided for her.

But Nancy Ellen had stood facing a narrow mirror when she reached the gingham counter and the
clerk, taking one look at her fresh, beautiful face with its sharp contrasts of black eyes
and hair, rose-tinted skin that refused to tan, and red cheeks and lips, began shaking out
delicate blues, pale pinks, golden yellows.  He called them chambray; insisted that they wore
for ever, and were fadeless, which was practically the truth.  On the day that dress was like
to burst its waist seams, it was the same warm rosy pink that transformed Nancy Ellen from
the disfiguration of dirt-brown to apple and peach bloom, wild roses and swamp mallow, a girl
quite as pretty as a girl ever grows, and much prettier than any girl ever has any business
to be. The instant Nancy Ellen held the chambray under her chin and in an oblique glance saw
the face of the clerk, the material was hers no matter what the cost, which does not refer
to the price, by any means. Knowing that the dress would be an innovation that would set her
mother storming and fill Kate with envy, which would probably culminate in the demand that
the goods be returned and exchanged for dirt-brown, when she reached home Nancy Ellen climbed
from the wagon and told her father that she was going on to Adam's to have Agatha cut out her
dress so that she could begin to sew on it that night.  Such commendable industry met his hearty
approval, so he told her to go and he would see that Kate did her share of the work.  Wise
Nancy Ellen came home and sat her down to sew on her gorgeous frock, while the storm she had
feared raged in all its fury; but the goods was cut, and could not be returned.  Yet, through
it, a miracle happened:  Nancy Ellen so appreciated herself in pink that the extreme care she
used with that dress saved it from half the trips of a dirt-brown one to the wash board and
the ironing table; while, marvel of marvels, it did not shrink, it did not fade, also it wore
like buckskin.  The result was that before the season had passed Kate was allowed to purchase
a pale blue, which improved her appearance quite as much in proportion as pink had Nancy Ellen's;
neither did the blue fade nor shrink nor require so much washing, for the same reason.  Three
years the pink dress had been Nancy Ellen's PIECE DE RESISTANCE; now she had a new one, much
the same, yet conspicuously different.  This was a daring rose colour, full and wide, peeping
white embroidery trimming, and big pearl buttons, really a beautiful dress, made in a becoming
manner. Kate looked at it in cheerful envy.  Never mind!  The coming summer she would have
a blue that would make that pink look silly. From the dress she turned to Nancy Ellen, barely
in time to see her bend her head and smirk, broadly, smilingly, approvingly, at her reflection
in the glass.

"For mercy sake, what IS the matter with you?" demanded Kate, ripping a strand of hair in sudden
irritation.

"Oh, something lovely!" answered her sister, knowing that this was her chance to impart the
glad tidings herself; if she lost it, Agatha would get the thrill of Kate's surprise.  So Nancy
Ellen opened her drawer and slowly produced and set upon her bureau a cabinet photograph of
a remarkably strong-featured, handsome young man.  Then she turned to Kate and smiled a slow,
challenging smile.  Kate walked over and picked up the picture, studying it intently but in
growing amazement.

"Who is he?" she asked finally.

"My man!" answered Nancy Ellen, possessively, triumphantly.

Kate stared at her.  "Honest to God?" she cried in wonderment.

"Honest!" said Nancy Ellen.

"Where on earth did you find him?" demanded Kate.

"Picked him out of the blackberry patch," said Nancy Ellen.

"Those darn blackberries are always late," said Kate, throwing the picture back on the bureau.
"Ain't that just my luck!  You wouldn't touch the raspberries.  I had to pick them every one
myself.  But the minute I turn my back, you go pick a man like that, out of the blackberry
patch.  I bet a cow you wore your pink chambray, and carried grandmother's old blue bowl."

"Certainly," said Nancy Ellen, "and my pink sun-bonnet.  I think maybe the bonnet started it."

Kate sat down limply on the first chair and studied the toes of her shoes.  At last she roused
and looked at Nancy Ellen, waiting in smiling complaisance as she returned the picture to her
end of the bureau.

"Well, why don't you go ahead?" cried Kate in a thick, rasping voice. "Empty yourself!  Who
is he?  Where did he come from?  WHY was he IN our blackberry patch?  Has he really been to
see you, and is he courting you in earnest?--But of COURSE he is! There's the lilac bush, the
lawn-mower, the house to be painted, and a humdinger dress.  Is he a millionaire?  For Heaven's
sake tell me--"

"Give me some chance!  I did meet him in the blackberry patch. He's a nephew of Henry Lang
and his name is Robert Gray.  He has just finished a medical course and he came here to rest
and look at Hartley for a location, because Lang thinks it would be such a good one.  And since
we met he has decided to take an office in Hartley, and he has money to furnish it, and to
buy and furnish a nice house."

"Great Jehoshaphat!" cried Kate.  "And I bet he's got wings, too! I do have the rottenest luck!"

"You act for all the world as if it were a foregone conclusion that if you had been here, you'd
have won him!"

Nancy Ellen glanced in the mirror and smiled, while Kate saw the smile. She picked up her comb
and drew herself to full height.

"If anything ever was a 'foregone conclusion,'" she said, "it is a 'foregone conclusion' that
if I HAD been here, I'd have picked the blackberries, and so I'd have had the first chance
at him, at least."

"Much good it would have done you!" cried Nancy Ellen.  "Wait until he comes, and you see him!"

"You may do your mushing in private," said Kate.  "I don't need a demonstration to convince
me.  He looks from the picture like a man who would be as soft as a frosted pawpaw."

Nancy Ellen's face flamed crimson.  "You hateful spite-cat!" she cried.

Then she picked up the picture and laid it face down in her drawer, while two big tears ran
down her cheeks.  Kate saw those also. Instantly she relented.

"You big silly goose!" she said.  "Can't you tell when any one is teasing?  I think I never
saw a finer face than the one in that picture.  I'm jealous because I never left home a day
before in all my life, and the minute I do, here you go and have such luck. Are you really
sure of him, Nancy Ellen?"

"Well, he asked Father and Mother, and I've been to visit his folks, and he told them; and
I've been with him to Hartley hunting a house; and I'm not to teach this winter, so I can have
all my time to make my clothes and bedding.  Father likes him fine, so he is going to give
me money to get all I need.  He offered to, himself."

Kate finished her braid, pulled the combings from the comb and slowly wrapped the end of her
hair as she digested these convincing facts. She swung the heavy braid around her head, placed
a few pins, then crossed to her sister and laid a shaking hand on her shoulder.  Her face was
working strongly.

"Nancy Ellen, I didn't mean one ugly word I said.  You gave me an awful surprise, and that
was just my bald, ugly Bates way of taking it.  I think you are one of the most beautiful women
I ever have seen, alive or pictured.  I have always thought you would make a fine marriage,
and I am sure you will.  I haven't a doubt that Robert Gray is all you think him, and I am
as glad for you as I can be.  You can keep house in Hartley for two with scarcely any work
at all, and you can have all the pretty clothes you want, and time to wear them.  Doctors always
get rich if they are good ones, and he is sure to be a good one, once he gets a start.  If
only we weren't so beastly healthy there are enough Bates and Langs to support you for the
first year.  And I'll help you sew, and do all I can for you.  Now wipe up and look your handsomest!"

Nancy Ellen arose and put her arms around Kate's neck, a stunningly unusual proceeding.  "Thank
you," she said.  "That is big and fine of you.  But I always have shirked and put my work on
you; I guess now I'll quit, and do my sewing myself."

Then she slipped the pink dress over her head and stood slowly fastening it as Kate started
to leave the room.  Seeing her go: "I wish you would wait and meet Robert," she said. "I have
told him about what a nice sister I have."

"I think I'll go on to Adam's now," said Kate.  "I don't want to wait until they go some place,
and I miss them.  I'll do better to meet your man after I become more accustomed to bare facts,
anyway.  By the way, is he as tall as you?"

"Yes," said Nancy Ellen, laughing.  "He is an inch and a half taller. Why?"

"Oh, I hate seeing a woman taller than her husband and I've always wondered where we'd find
men to reach our shoulders.  But if they can be picked at random from the berry patch--"

So Kate went on her way laughing, lifting her white skirts high from the late August dust.
She took a short cut through the woods and at a small stream, with sure foot, crossed the log
to within a few steps of the opposite bank.  There she stopped, for a young man rounded the
bushes and set a foot on the same log; then he and Kate looked straight into each other's eyes.
Kate saw a clean-shaven, forceful young face, with strong lines and good colouring, clear gray
eyes, sandy brown hair, even, hard, white teeth, and broad shoulders a little above her own.
The man saw Kate, dressed in her best and looking her best. Slowly she extended her hand.

"I bet a picayune you are my new brother, Robert," she said.

The young man gripped her hand firmly, held it, and kept on looking in rather a stunned manner
at Kate.

"Well, aren't you?" she asked, trying to withdraw the hand.

"I never, never would have believed it," he said.

"Believed what?" asked Kate, leaving the hand where it was.

"That there could be two in the same family," said he.

"But I'm as different from Nancy Ellen as night from day," said Kate, "besides, woe is me,
I didn't wear a pink dress and pick you from the berry patch in a blue bowl."

Then the man released her hand and laughed.  "You wouldn't have had the slightest trouble,
if you had been there," he said.

"Except that I should have inverted my bowl," said Kate, calmly. "I am looking for a millionaire,
riding a milk-white steed, and he must be much taller than you and have black hair and eyes.
Good-bye, brother! I will see you this evening."

Then Kate went down the path to deliver the telescope, render her thanks, make her promise
of speedy payment, and for the first time tell her good news about her school.  She found that
she was very happy as she went and quite convinced that her first flight would prove entirely
successful.

CHAPTER IV

A QUESTION OF CONTRACTS

"HELLO, Folks!" cried Kate, waving her hand to the occupants of the veranda as she went up
the walk.  "Glad to find you at home."

"That is where you will always find me unless I am forced away on business," said her brother
as they shook hands.

Agatha was pleased with this, and stiff as steel, she bent the length of her body toward Kate
and gave her a tight-lipped little peck on the cheek.

"I came over, as soon as I could," said Kate as she took the chair her brother offered, "to
thank you for the big thing you did for me, Agatha, when you lent me that money.  If I had
known where I was going, or the help it would be to me, I should have gone if I'd had to walk
and work for my board.  Why, I feel so sure of myself!  I've learned so much that I'm like
the girl fresh from boarding school:  'The only wonder is that one small head can contain it
all.'  Thank you over and over and I've got a good school, so I can pay you back the very first
month, I think.  If there are things I must have, I can pay part the first month and the remainder
the second.  I am eager for pay-day.  I can't even picture the bliss of having that much money
in my fingers, all my own, to do with as I please.  Won't it be grand?"

In the same breath said Agatha:  "Procure yourself some clothes!" Said Adam:  "Start a bank
account!"

Said Kate:  "Right you are!  I shall do both."

"Even our little Susan has a bank account," said Adam, Jr., proudly.

"Which is no reflection whatever on me," laughed Kate.  "Susan did not have the same father
and mother I had.  I'd like to see a girl of my branch of the Bates family start a bank account
at ten."

"No, I guess she wouldn't," admitted Adam, dryly.

"But have you heard that Nancy Ellen has started?" cried Kate. "Only think!  A lawn-mower!
The house and barn to be painted! All the dinge possible to remove scoured away, inside!  She
must have worn her fingers almost to the bone!  And really, Agatha, have you seen the man?
He's as big as Adam, and just fine looking.  I'm simply consumed with envy."

"Miss Medira, Dora, Ann, cast her net, and catched a man!" recited Susan from the top step,
at which they all laughed.

"No, I have not had the pleasure of casting my optics upon the individual of Nancy Ellen's
choice," said Agatha primly, "but Miss Amelia Lang tells me he is a very distinguished person,
of quite superior education in a medical way.  I shall call him if I ever have the misfortune
to fall ill again.  I hope you will tell Nancy Ellen that we shall be very pleased to have
her bring him to see us some evening, and if she will let me know a short time ahead I shall
take great pleasure in compounding a cake and freezing custard."

"Of course I shall tell her, and she will feel a trifle more stuck up than she does now, if
that is possible," laughed Kate in deep amusement.

She surely was feeling fine.  Everything had come out so splendidly. That was what came of
having a little spirit and standing up for your rights.  Also she was bubbling inside while
Agatha talked.  Kate wondered how Adam survived it every day.  She glanced at him to see if
she could detect any marks of shattered nerves, then laughed outright.

Adam was the finest physical specimen of a man she knew.  He was good looking also, and spoke
as well as the average, better in fact, for from the day of their marriage, Agatha sat on his
lap each night and said these words:  "My beloved, to-day I noted an error in your speech.
It would put a former teacher to much embarrassment to have this occur in public.  In the future
will you not try to remember that you should say, 'have gone,' instead of 'have went?'"  As
she talked Agatha rumpled Adam's hair, pulled off his string tie, upon which she insisted,
even when he was plowing; laid her hard little face against his, and held him tight with her
frail arms, so that Adam being part human as well as part Bates, held her closely also and
said these words:  "You bet your sweet life I will!"  And what is more he did.  He followed
a furrow the next day, softly muttering over to himself: "Langs have gone to town.  I have
gone to work.  The birds have gone to building nests."  So Adam seldom said:  "have went,"
or made any other error in speech that Agatha had once corrected.

As Kate watched him leaning back in his chair, vital, a study in well-being, the supremest
kind of satisfaction on his face, she noted the flash that lighted his eye when Agatha offered
to "freeze a custard."  How like Agatha! Any other woman Kate knew would have said, "make ice
cream."  Agatha explained to them that when they beat up eggs, added milk, sugar, and corn-starch
it was custard.  When they used pure cream, sweetened and frozen, it was iced cream.  Personally,
she preferred the custard, but she did not propose to call it custard cream.  It was not correct.
Why persist in misstatements and inaccuracies when one knew better? So Agatha said iced cream
when she meant it, and frozen custard, when custard it was, but every other woman in the neighbourhood,
had she acted as she felt, would have slapped Agatha's face when she said it:  this both Adam
and Kate well knew, so it made Kate laugh despite the fact that she would not have offended
Agatha purposely.

"I think--I think," said Agatha, "that Nancy Ellen has much upon which to congratulate herself.
More education would not injure her, but she has enough that if she will allow her ambition
to rule her and study in private and spend her spare time communing with the best writers,
she can make an exceedingly fair intellectual showing, while she surely is a handsome woman.
With a good home and such a fine young professional man as she has had the good fortune to
attract, she should immediately put herself at the head of society in Hartley and become its
leader to a much higher moral and intellectual plane than it now occupies."

"Bet she has a good time," said young Adam.  "He's awful nice."

"Son," said Agatha, "'awful,' means full of awe.  A cyclone, a cloudburst, a great conflagration
are awful things.  By no stretch of the imagination could they be called nice."

"But, Ma, if a cyclone blew away your worst enemy wouldn't it be nice?"

Adam, Jr., and Kate laughed.  Not the trace of a smile crossed Agatha's pale face.

"The words do not belong in contiguity," she said.  "They are diametrically opposite in meaning.
Please do not allow my ears to be offended by hearing you place them in propinquity again."

"I'll try not to, Ma," said young Adam; then Agatha smiled on him approvingly.  "When did you
meet Mr. Gray, Katherine?" she asked.

"On the foot-log crossing the creek beside Lang's line fence. Near the spot Nancy Ellen first
met him I imagine."

"How did you recognize him?"

"Nancy Ellen had just been showing me his picture and telling me about him.  Great Day, but
she's in love with him!"

"And so he is with her, if Lang's conclusions from his behaviour can be depended upon.  They
inform me that he can be induced to converse on no other subject.  The whole arrangement appeals
to me as distinctly admirable."

"And you should see the lilac bush and the cabbage roses," said Kate. "And the strangest thing
is Father.  He is peaceable as a lamb.  She is not to teach, but to spend the winter sewing
on her clothes and bedding, and Father told her he would give her the necessary money. She
said so.  And I suspect he will.  He always favoured her because she was so pretty, and she
can come closer to wheedling him than any of the rest of us excepting you, Agatha."

"It is an innovation, surely!"

"Mother is nearly as bad.  Father furnishing money for clothes and painting the barn is no
more remarkable than Mother letting her turn the house inside out.  If it had been I, Father
would have told me to teach my school this winter, buy my own clothes and linen with the money
I had earned, and do my sewing next summer. But I am not jealous. It is because she is handsome,
and the man fine-looking and with such good prospects."

"There you have it!" said Adam emphatically.  "If it were you, marrying Jim Lang, to live on
Lang's west forty, you WOULD pay your own way. But if it were you marrying a fine-looking young
doctor, who will soon be a power in Hartley, no doubt, it would tickle Father's vanity until
he would do the same for you."

"I doubt it!" said Kate.  "I can't see the vanity in Father."

"You can't?" said Adam, Jr., bitterly.  "Maybe not!  You have not been with him in the Treasurer's
office when he calls for 'the tax on those little parcels of land of mine.'  He looks every
inch of six feet six then, and swells like a toad.  To hear him you would think sixteen hundred
and fifty acres of the cream of this county could be tied in a bandanna and carried on a walking
stick, he is so casual about it.  And those men fly around like buttons on a barn door to wait
on him and it's 'Mister Bates this' and 'Mister Bates that,' until it turns my stomach.  Vanity!
He rolls in it! He eats it!  He risks losing our land for us that some of us have slaved over
for twenty years, to feed that especial vein of his vanity.  Where should we be if he let anything
happen to those deeds?"

"How refreshing!" cried Kate.  "I love to hear you grouching!  I hear nothing else from the
women of the Bates family, but I didn't even know the men had a grouch.  Are Peter, and John,
and Hiram, and the other boys sore, too?"

"I should say they are!  But they are too diplomatic to say so. They are afraid to cheep. 
I just open my head and say right out loud in meeting that since I've turned in the taxes and
insurance for all these years and improved my land more than fifty per cent., I'd like to own
it, and pay my taxes myself, like a man."

"I'd like to have some land under any conditions," said Kate, "but probably I never shall.
And I bet you never get a flipper on that deed until Father has crossed over Jordan, which
with his health and strength won't be for twenty-five years yet at least.  He's performing
a miracle that will make the other girls rave, when he gives Nancy Ellen money to buy her outfit;
but they won't dare let him hear a whisper of it.  They'll take it all out on Mother, and she'll
be afraid to tell him."

"Afraid?  Mother afraid of him?  Not on your life.  She is hand in glove with him.  She thinks
as he does, and helps him in everything he undertakes."

"That's so, too.  Come to think of it, she isn't a particle afraid of him.  She agrees with
him perfectly.  It would be interesting to hear them having a private conversation.  They never
talk a word before us. But they always agree, and they heartily agree on Nancy Ellen's man,
that is plainly to be seen."

"It will make a very difficult winter for you, Katherine," said Agatha. "When Nancy Ellen becomes
interested in dresses and table linen and bedding she will want to sew all the time, and leave
the cooking and dishes for you as well as your schoolwork."

Kate turned toward Agatha in surprise.  "But I won't be there!  I told you I had taken a school."

"You taken a school!" shouted Adam.  "Why, didn't they tell you that Father has signed up for
the home school for you?"

"Good Heavens!" said Kate.  "What will be to pay now?"

"Did you contract for another school?" cried Adam.

"I surely did," said Kate slowly.  "I signed an agreement to teach the village school in Walden.
It's a brick building with a janitor to sweep and watch fires, only a few blocks to walk, and
it pays twenty dollars a month more than the home school where you can wade snow three miles,
build your own fires, and freeze all day in a little frame building at that.  I teach the school
I have taken."

"And throw our school out of a teacher?  Father could be sued, and probably will be," said
Adam.  "And throw the housework Nancy Ellen expected you to do on her," said Agatha, at the
same time.

"I see," said Kate.  "Well, if he is sued, he will have to settle. He wouldn't help me a penny
to go to school, I am of age, the debt is my own, and I don't owe it to him.  He's had all
my work has been worth all my life, and I've surely paid my way.  I shall teach the school
I have signed for."

"You will get into a pretty kettle of fish!" said Adam.

"Agatha, will you sell me your telescope for what you paid for it, and get yourself a new one
the next time you go to Hartley?  It is only a few days until time to go to my school, it opens
sooner than in the country, and closes later.  The term is four months longer, so I earn that
much more.  I haven't gotten a telescope yet.  You can add it to my first payment."

"You may take it," said Agatha, "but hadn't you better reconsider, Katherine?  Things are progressing
so nicely, and this will upset everything for Nancy Ellen."

"That taking the home school will upset everything for me, doesn't seem to count.  It is late,
late to find teachers, and I can be held responsible if I break the contract I have made. 
Father can stand the racket better than I can.  When he wouldn't consent to my going, he had
no business to make plans for me.  I had to make my own plans and go in spite of him; he might
have known I'd do all in my power to get a school.  Besides, I don't want the home school,
or the home work piled on me.  My hands look like a human being's for the first time in my
life; then I need all my time outside of school to study and map out lessons.  I am going to
try for a room in the Hartley schools next year, or the next after that, surely.  They sha'n't
change my plans and boss me, I am going to be free to work, and study, and help myself, like
other teachers."

"A grand row this will be," commented young Adam.  "And as usual Kate will be right, while
all of them will be trying to use her to their advantage.  Ma has done her share.  Now it is
your turn, Pa. Ain't you going to go over and help her?"

"What could I do?" demanded his father.  "The mischief is done now."

"Well, if you can't do anything to help, you can let me have the buggy to drive her to Walden,
if they turn her out."

"'Forcibly invite her to proceed to her destination,' you mean, son," said Agatha.

"Yes, Ma, that is exactly what I mean," said young Adam.  "Do I get the buggy?"

"Yes, you may take my private conveyance.  But do nothing to publish the fact.  There is no
need to incur antagonism if it can be avoided."

"Kate, I'll be driving past the privet bush about nine in the morning. If you need me, hang
a white rag on it, and I'll stop at the corner of the orchard."

"I shall probably be standing in the road waiting for you," said Kate.

"Oh, I hope not," said Agatha.

"Looks remarkably like it to me," said Kate.

Then she picked up the telescope, said good-bye to each of them, and in acute misery started
back to her home.  This time she followed the footpath beside the highway.  She was so busy
with her indignant thought that she forgot to protect her skirts from the dust of wayside weeds,
while in her excitement she walked so fast her face was red and perspiring when she approached
the church.

"Oh, dear, I don't know about it," said Kate to the small, silent building.  "I am trying to
follow your advice, but it seems to me that life is very difficult, any way you go at it. 
If it isn't one thing, it is another.  An hour ago I was the happiest I have ever been in my
life; only look at me now!  Any one who wants 'the wings of morning' may have them for all
of me.  It seems definitely settled that I walk, carry a load, and fight for the chance to
do even that."

A big tear rolled down either side of Kate's nose and her face twisted in self-pity for an
instant.  But when she came in sight of home her shoulders squared, the blue-gray of her eyes
deepened to steel, and her lips set in a line that was an exact counterpart of her father's
when he had made up his mind and was ready to drive his family, with their consent or without
it.  As she passed the vegetable garden--there was no time or room for flowers in a Bates garden--Kate,
looking ahead, could see Nancy Ellen and Robert Gray beneath the cherry trees.  She hoped Nancy
Ellen would see that she was tired and dusty, and should have time to brush and make herself
more presentable to meet a stranger, and so Nancy Ellen did; for which reason she immediately
arose and came to the gate, followed by her suitor whom she at once introduced.  Kate was in
no mood for words; one glance at her proved to Robert Gray that she was tired and dusty, that
there were tear marks dried on her face.  They hastily shook hands, but neither mentioned the
previous meeting.  Excusing herself Kate went into the house saying she would soon return.

Nancy Ellen glanced at Robert, and saw the look of concern on his face.

"I believe she has been crying," she said.  "And if she has, it's something new, for I never
saw a tear on her face before in my life."

"Truly?" he questioned in amazement.

"Why, of course!  The Bates family are not weepers."

"So I have heard," said the man, rather dryly.

Nancy Ellen resented his tone.

"Would you like us better if we were?"

"I couldn't like you better than I do, but because of what I have heard and seen, it naturally
makes me wonder what could have happened that has made her cry."

"We are rather outspoken, and not at all secretive," said Nancy Ellen, carelessly, "you will
soon know."

Kate followed the walk around the house and entered at the side door, finding her father and
mother in the dining room reading the weekly papers.  Her mother glanced up as she entered.

"What did you bring Agatha's telescope back with you for?" she instantly demanded.

For a second Kate hesitated.  It had to come, she might as well get it over.  Possibly it would
be easier with them alone than if Nancy Ellen were present.

"It is mine," she said.  "It represents my first purchase on my own hook and line."

"You are not very choicy to begin on second-hand stuff.  Nancy Ellen would have had a new one."

"No doubt!" said Kate.  "But this will do for me."

Her father lowered his paper and asked harshly:  "What did you buy that thing for?"

Kate gripped the handle and braced herself.

"To pack my clothes in when I go to my school next week," she said simply.

"What?" he shouted.  "What?" cried her mother.

"I don't know why you seem surprised," said Kate.  "Surely you knew I went to Normal to prepare
myself to teach.  Did you think I couldn't find a school?"

"Now look here, young woman," shouted Adam Bates, "you are done taking the bit in your teeth.
Nancy Ellen is not going to teach this winter. I have taken the home school for you; you will
teach it.  That is settled.  I have signed the contract.  It must be fulfilled."

"Then Nancy Ellen will have to fulfill it," said Kate.  "I also have signed a contract that
must be fulfilled.  I am of age, and you had no authority from me to sign a contract for me."

For an instant Kate thought there was danger that the purple rush of blood to her father's
head might kill him.  He opened his mouth, but no distinct words came.  Her face paled with
fright, but she was of his blood, so she faced him quietly.  Her mother was quicker of wit,
and sharper of tongue.

"Where did you get a school?  Why didn't you wait until you got home?" she demanded.

"I am going to teach the village school in Walden," said Kate. "It is a brick building, has
a janitor, I can board reasonably, near my work, and I get twenty dollars more a month than
our school pays, while the term is four months longer."

"Well, it is a pity about that; but it makes no difference," said her mother.  "Our home school
has got to be taught as Pa contracted, and Nancy Ellen has got to have her chance."

"What about my chance?" asked Kate evenly.  "Not one of the girls, even Exceptional Ability,
ever had as good a school or as high wages to start on.  If I do well there this winter, I
am sure I can get in the Hartley graded schools next fall."

"Don't you dare nickname your sister," cried Mrs. Bates, shrilly. "You stop your impudence
and mind your father."

"Ma, you leave this to me," said Adam Bates, thickly.  Then he glared at Kate as he arose,
stretching himself to full height. "You've signed a contract for a school?" he demanded.

"I have," said Kate.

"Why didn't you wait until you got home and talked it over with us?" he questioned.

"I went to you to talk over the subject to going," said Kate. "You would not even allow me
to speak.  How was I to know that you would have the slightest interest in what school I took,
or where."

"When did you sign this contract?" he continued.

"Yesterday afternoon, in Hartley," said Kate.

"Aha!  Then I did miss a letter from my pocket.  When did you get to be a thief?" he demanded.

"Oh, Father!" cried Kate.  "It was my letter.  I could see my name on the envelope.  I ASKED
you for it, before I took it."

"From behind my back, like the sneak-thief you are.  You are not fit to teach in a school where
half the scholars are the children of your brothers and sisters, and you are not fit to live
with honest people. Pack your things and be off!"

"Now?  This afternoon?" asked Kate.

"This minute!" he cried.

"All right.  You will be surprised at how quickly I can go," said Kate.

She set down the telescope and gathered a straw sunshade and an apron from the hooks at the
end of the room, opened the dish cupboard, and took out a mug decorated with the pinkest of
wild roses and the reddest and fattest of robins, bearing the inscription in gold, "For a Good
Girl" on a banner in its beak. Kate smiled at it grimly as she took the telescope and ran upstairs.
It was the work of only a few minutes to gather her books and clothing and pack the big telescope,
then she went down the front stairs and left the house by the front door carrying in her hand
everything she possessed on earth.  As she went down the walk Nancy Ellen sprang up and ran
to her while Robert Gray followed.

"You'll have to talk to me on the road," said Kate.  "I am forbidden the house which also means
the grounds, I suppose."

She walked across the road, set the telescope on the grass under a big elm tree, and sat down
beside it.

"I find I am rather tired," she said.  "Will you share the sofa with me?"

Nancy Ellen lifted her pink skirt and sat beside Kate.  Robert Gray stood looking down at them.

"What in the world is the matter?" asked Nancy Ellen.

"You know, of course, that Father signed a contract for me to teach the home school this winter,"
explained Kate.  "Well, I am of age, and he had no authority from me, so his contract isn't
legal.  None of you would lift a finger to help me get away to Normal, how was I to know that
you would take any interest in finding me a school while I was gone?  I thought it was all
up to me, so I applied for the school in Walden, got it, and signed the contract to teach it.
It is a better school, at higher wages.  I thought you would teach here--I can't break my contract.
Father is furious and has ordered me out of the house. So there you are, or rather here I am."

"Well, it isn't much of a joke," said Nancy Ellen, thinking intently.

What she might have said had they been alone, Kate always wondered. What she did say while
her betrothed looked at her with indignant eyes was possibly another matter.  It proved to
be merely:  "Oh, Kate, I am so sorry!"

"So am I," said Kate.  "If I had known what your plans were, of course I should gladly have
helped you out.  If only you had written me and told me."

"I wanted to surprise you," said Nancy Ellen.

"You have," said Kate.  "Enough to last a lifetime.  I don't see how you figured.  You knew
how late it was.  You knew it would be nip and tuck if I got a school at all."

"Of course we did!  We thought you couldn't possibly get one, this late, so we fixed up the
scheme to let you have my school, and let me sew on my linen this winter.  We thought you would
be as pleased as we were."

"I am too sorry for words," said Kate.  "If I had known your plan, I would have followed it,
even though I gave up a better school at a higher salary.  But I didn't know.  I thought I
had to paddle my own canoe, so I made my own plans.  Now I must live up to them, because my
contract is legal, while Father's is not.  I would have taught the school for you, in the circumstances,
but since I can't, so far as I am concerned, the arrangement I have made is much better.  The
thing that really hurts the worst, aside from disappointing you, is that Father says I was
not honest in what I did."

"But what DID you do?" cried Nancy Ellen.

So Kate told them exactly what she had done.

"Of course you had a right to your own letter, when you could see the address on it, and it
was where you could pick it up," said Robert Gray.

Kate lifted dull eyes to his face.

"Thank you for so much grace, at any rate," she said.

"I don't blame you a bit," said Nancy Ellen.  "In the same place I'd have taken it myself."

"You wouldn't have had to," said Kate.  "I'm too abrupt--too much like the gentleman himself.
You would have asked him in a way that would have secured you the letter with no trouble."

Nancy Ellen highly appreciated these words of praise before her lover. She arose immediately.

"Maybe I could do something with him now," she said.  "I'll go and see."

"You shall do nothing of the kind," said Kate.  "I am as much Bates as he is.  I won't be taunted
afterward that he turned me out and that I sent you to him to plead for me."

"I'll tell him you didn't want me to come, that I came of my own accord," offered Nancy Ellen.

"And he won't believe you," said Kate.

"Would you consent for me to go?" asked Robert Gray.

"Certainly not!  I can look out for myself."

"What shall you do?" asked Nancy Ellen anxiously.

"That is getting slightly ahead of me," said Kate.  "If I had been diplomatic I could have
evaded this until morning.  Adam, 3d, is to be over then, prepared to take me anywhere I want
to go.  What I have to face now is a way to spend the night without letting the neighbours
know that I am turned out.  How can I manage that?"

Nancy Ellen and Robert each began making suggestions, but Kate preferred to solve her own problems.

"I think," she said, "that I shall hide the telescope under the privet bush, there isn't going
to be rain to-night; and then I will go down to Hiram's and stay all night and watch for Adam
when he passes in the morning.  Hiram always grumbles because we don't come oftener."

"Then we will go with you," said Nancy Ellen.  "It will be a pleasant evening walk, and we
can keep you company and pacify my twin brother at the same time."

So they all walked to the adjoining farm on the south and when Nancy Ellen and Robert were
ready to start back, Kate said she was tired and she believed she would stay until morning,
which was agreeable to Hiram and his wife, a girlhood friend of Kate's.  As Nancy Ellen and
Robert walked back toward home:  "How is this going to come out?" he asked, anxiously.

"It will come out all right," said Nancy Ellen, serenely.  "Kate hasn't a particle of tact.
She is Father himself, all over again. It will come out this way:  he will tell me that Kate
has gone back on him and I shall have to teach the school, and I will say that is the ONLY
solution and the BEST thing to do.  Then I shall talk all evening about how provoking it is,
and how I hate to change my plans, and say I am afraid I shall lose you if I have to put off
our wedding to teach the school, and things like that," Nancy Ellen turned a flushed sparkling
face to Robert, smiling quizzically, "and to-morrow I shall go early to see Serena Woodruff,
who is a fine scholar and a good teacher, but missed her school in the spring by being so sick
she was afraid to contract for it.  She is all right now, and she will be delighted to have
the school, and when I know she will take it then I shall just happen to think of her in a
day or two and I'll suggest her, after I've wailed a lot more; and Father will go to see her
of his own accord, and it will all be settled as easy as falling off a chunk, only I shall
not get on so fast with my sewing, because of having to help Mother; but I shall do my best,
and everything will be all right."

The spot was secluded.  Robert Gray stopped to tell Nancy Ellen what a wonderful girl she was.
He said he was rather afraid of such diplomacy.  He foresaw clearly that he was going to be
a managed man. Nancy Ellen told him of course he was, all men were, the thing was not to let
them know it.  Then they laughed and listened to a wood robin singing out his little heart
in an evening song that was almost as melodious as his spring performances had been.

CHAPTER V

THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER

EARLY in the morning Kate set her young nephew on the gate-post to watch for his cousin, and
he was to have a penny for calling at his approach.  When his lusty shout came, Kate said good-bye
to her sister-in-law, paid the penny, kissed the baby, and was standing in the road when Adam
stopped.  He looked at her inquiringly.

"Well, it happened," she said.  "He turned me out instanter, with no remarks about when I might
return, if ever, while Mother cordially seconded the motion.  It's a good thing, Adam, that
you offered to take care of me, because I see clearly that you are going to have it to do."

"Of course I will," said Adam promptly.  "And of course I can.  Do you want to go to Hartley
for anything?  Because if you don't, we can cut across from the next road and get to Walden
in about fifteen miles, while it's seventeen by Hartley; but if you want to go we can, for
I needn't hurry.  I've got a box of lunch and a feed for my horse in the back of the buggy.
Mother said I was to stay with you until I saw you settled in your room, if you had to go;
and if you do, she is angry with Grandpa, and she is going to give him a portion of her mentality
the very first time she comes in contact with him.  She said so."

"Yes, I can almost hear her," said Kate, struggling to choke down a rising laugh. "She will
never know how I appreciate what she has done for me, but I think talking to Father will not
do any good. Home hasn't been so overly pleasant.  It's been a small, dark, cramped house,
dingy and hot, when it might have been big, airy, and comfortable, well furnished and pretty
as Father's means would allow, and as all the neighbours always criticize him for not having
it; it's meant hard work and plenty of it ever since I was set to scouring the tinware with
rushes at the mature age of four, but it's been home, all the home I have had, and it hurts
more than I can tell you to be ordered out of it as I was, but if I do well and make a big
success, maybe he will let me come back for Christmas, or next summer's vacation."

"If he won't, Ma said you could come to our house," said Adam.

"That's kind of her, but I couldn't do it," said Kate.

"She SAID you could," persisted the boy.

"But if I did it, and Father got as mad as he was last night and tore up your father's deed,
then where would I be?" asked Kate.

"You'd be a sixteenth of two hundred acres better off than you are now," said Adam.

"Possibly," laughed Kate, "but I wouldn't want to become a land shark that way.  Look down
the road."

"Who is it?" asked Adam.

"Nancy Ellen, with my telescope," answered Kate.  "I am to go, all right."

"All right, then we will go," said the boy, angrily.  "But it is a blame shame and there is
no sense to it, as good a girl as you have been, and the way you have worked.  Mother said
at breakfast there was neither sense nor justice in the way Grandpa always has acted and she
said she would wager all she was worth that he would live to regret it. She said it wasn't
natural, and when people undertook to controvert--ain't that a peach?  Bet there isn't a woman
in ten miles using that word except Ma--nature they always hurt themselves worse than they
hurt their victims.  And I bet he does, too, and I, for one, don't care.  I hope he does get
a good jolt, just to pay him up for being so mean."

"Don't, Adam, don't!" cautioned Kate.

"I mean it!" cried the boy.

"I know you do.  That's the awful thing about it," said Kate.  "I am afraid every girl he has
feels the same way, and from what your father said yesterday, even the sons he favours don't
feel any too good toward him."

"You just bet they don't!  They are every one as sore as boiled owls. Pa said so, and he knows,
for they all talk it over every time they meet.  He said they didn't feel like men, they felt
like a lot of 'spanked school-boys.'"

"They needn't worry," said Kate.  "Every deed is made out.  Father reads them over whenever
it rains.  They'll all get their land when he dies.  It is only his way."

"Yes, and THIS is only his way, too, and it's a dern poor way," said Adam.  "Pa isn't going
to do this way at all.  Mother said he could go and live on his land, and she'd stay home with
Susan and me, if he tried it.  And when I am a man I am going to do just like Pa and Ma because
they are the rightest people I know, only I am not going to save QUITE so close as Pa, and
if I died for it, I never could converse or dance like Ma."

"I should hope not!" said Kate, and then added hastily, "it's all right for a lady, but it
would seem rather sissy for a man, I believe."

"Yes, I guess it would, but it is language let me tell you, when Ma cuts loose," said Adam.

"Hello, Nancy Ellen," said Kate as Adam stopped the buggy.  "Put my telescope in the back with
the horse feed.  Since you have it, I don't need ask whether I am the Prodigal Daughter or
not.  I see clearly I am."

Nancy Ellen was worried, until she was pale.

"Kate," she said, "I never have seen Father so angry in all my life.  I thought last night
that in a day or two I could switch the school over to Serena Woodruff, and go on with my plans,
but Father said at breakfast if the Bates name was to stand for anything approaching honour,
a Bates would teach that school this winter or he'd know the reason why.  And you know how
easy it is to change him.  Oh, Kate, won't you see if that Walden trustee can't possibly find
another teacher, and let you off?  I know Robert will be disappointed, for he's rented his
office and bought a house and he said last night to get ready as soon after Christmas as I
could.  Oh, Kate, won't you see if you can't possibly get that man to hire another teacher?"

"Why, Nancy Ellen--" said Kate.

Nancy Ellen, with a twitching face, looked at Kate.

"If Robert has to wait months, there in Hartley, handsome as he is, and he has to be nice to
everybody to get practice, and you know how those Hartley girls are--"

"Yes, Nancy Ellen, I know," said Kate.  "I'll see what I can do. Is it understood that if I
give up the school and come back and take ours, Father will let me come home?"

"Yes, oh, yes!" cried Nancy Ellen.

"Well, nothing goes on guess-work.  I'll hear him say it, myself," said Kate.

She climbed from the buggy.  Nancy Ellen caught her arm.

"Don't go in there!  Don't you go there," she cried.  "He'll throw the first thing he can pick
up at you.  Mother says he hasn't been asleep all night."

"Pooh!" said Kate.  "How childish!  I want to hear him say that, and he'll scarcely kill me."

She walked swiftly to the side door.

"Father," she said, "Nancy Ellen is afraid she will lose Robert Gray if she has to put off
her marriage for months--"

Kate stepped back quickly as a chair crashed against the door facing. She again came into view
and continued--"so she asked me if I would get out of my school and come back if I could"--Kate
dodged another chair; when she appeared again--"To save the furniture, of which we have none
too much, I'll just step inside," she said.  When her father started toward her, she started
around the dining table, talking as fast as she could, he lunging after her like a furious
bull.  "She asked me to come back and teach the school--to keep her from putting off her wedding--because
she is afraid to--  If I can break my contract there--may I come back and help her out here?"

The pace was going more swiftly each round, it was punctuated at that instant by a heavy meat
platter aimed at Kate's head.  She saw it picked up and swayed so it missed.

"I guess that is answer enough for me," she panted, racing on.  "A lovely father you are--no
wonder your daughters are dishonest through fear of you--no wonder your wife has no mind of
her own--no wonder your sons hate you and wish you would die--so they could have their deeds
and be like men--instead of 'spanked school-boys' as they feel now--no wonder the whole posse
of us hate you."

Directly opposite the door Kate caught the table and drew it with her to bar the opening. 
As it crashed against the casing half the dishes flew to the floor in a heap.  When Adam Bates
pulled it from his path he stepped in a dish of fried potatoes and fell heavily.  Kate reached
the road, climbed in the buggy, and said the Nancy Ellen:  "You'd better hide!  Cut a bundle
of stuff and send it to me by Adam and I'll sew my fingers to the bone for you every night.
Now drive like sin, Adam!"

As Adam Bates came lurching down the walk in fury the buggy dashed past and Kate had not even
time to turn her head to see what happened.

"Take the first turn," she said to Adam.  "I've done an awful thing."

"What did you do?" cried the boy.

"Asked him as nicely as I could; but he threw a chair at me. Something funny happened to me,
and I wasn't afraid of him at all. I dodged it, and finished what I was saying, and another
chair came, so the two Bates went at it."

"Oh, Kate, what did you do?" cried Adam.

"Went inside and ran around the dining table while I told him what all his sons and daughters
think of him. 'Spanked school-boys' and all--"

"Did you tell him my father said that?" he demanded.

"No.  I had more sense left than that," said Kate.  "I only said all his boys FELT like that.
Then I pulled the table after me to block the door, and smashed half the dishes and he slipped
in the fried potatoes and went down with a crash--"

"Bloody Murder!" cried young Adam, aghast.

"Me, too!" said Kate.  "I'll never step in that house again while he lives.  I've spilled the
beans, now."

"That you have," said Adam, slacking his horse to glance back. "He is standing in the middle
of the road shaking his fist after you."

"Can you see Nancy Ellen?" asked Kate.

"No.  She must have climbed the garden fence and hidden behind the privet bush."

"Well, she better make it a good long hide, until he has had plenty of time to cool off.  He'd
have killed me if he had caught me, after he fell--and wasted all those potatoes already cooked----"

Kate laughed a dry hysterical laugh, but the boy sat white-faced and awed.

"Never mind," said Kate, seeing how frightened he was.  "When he has had plenty of time he'll
cool off; but he'll never get over it.  I hope he doesn't beat Mother, because I was born."

"Oh, drat such a man!" said young Adam.  "I hope something worse that this happens to him.
If ever I see Father begin to be the least bit like him as he grows older I shall----"

"Well, what shall you do?" asked Kate, as he paused.

"Tell Ma!" cried young Adam, emphatically.

Kate leaned her face in her hands and laughed.  When she could speak she said:  "Do you know,
Adam, I think that would be the very best thing you could do."

"Why, of course!" said Adam.

They drove swiftly and reached Walden before ten o'clock.  There they inquired their way to
the home of the Trustee, but Kate said nothing about giving up the school.  She merely made
a few inquiries, asked for the key of the schoolhouse, and about boarding places.  She was
directed to four among which she might choose.

"Where would you advise me to go?" she asked the Trustee.

"Well, now, folks differ," said he.  "All those folks is neighbours of mine and some might
like one, and some might like another, best.  I COULD say this:  I think Means would be the
cheapest, Knowls the dearest, but the last teacher was a good one, an' she seemed well satisfied
with the Widder Holt."

"I see," said Kate, smiling.

Then she and young Adam investigated the schoolhouse and found it far better than any either
of them had ever been inside.  It promised every comfort and convenience, compared with schools
to which they had been accustomed, so they returned the keys, inquired about the cleaning of
the building, and started out to find a boarding place.  First they went to the cheapest, but
it could be seen at a glance that it was too cheap, so they eliminated that.  Then they went
to the most expensive, but it was obvious from the house and grounds that board there would
be more than Kate would want to pay.

"I'd like to save my digestion, and have a place in which to study, where I won't freeze,"
said Kate, "but I want to board as cheaply as I can.  This morning changes my plans materially.
I shall want to go to school next summer part of the time, but the part I do not, I shall have
to pay my way, so I mustn't spend money as I thought I would.  Not one of you will dare be
caught doing a thing for me.  To make you safe I'll stay away, but it will cost me money that
I'd hoped to have for clothes like other girls."

"It's too bad," said Adam, "but I'll stick to you, and so will Ma."

"Of course you will, you dear boy," said Kate.  "Now let's try our third place; it is not far
from here."

Soon they found the house, but Kate stopped short on sight of it.

"Adam, there has been little in life to make me particular," she said, "but I draw the line
at that house.  I would go crazy in a house painted bright red with brown and blue decoration.
It should be prohibited by law.  Let us hunt up the Widder Holt and see how her taste in colour
runs."

"The joke is on you," said Adam, when they had found the house.

It was near the school, on a wide shady street across which big maples locked branches.  There
was a large lot filled with old fruit trees and long grass, with a garden at the back.  The
house was old and low, having a small porch in front, but if it ever had seen paint, it did
not show it at that time.  It was a warm linty gray, the shingles of the old roof almost moss-covered.

"The joke IS on me," said Kate.  "I shall have no quarrel with the paint here, and will you
look at that?"

Adam looked where Kate pointed across the street, and nodded.

"That ought to be put in a gold frame," he said.

"I think so, too," said Kate.  "I shouldn't be a bit surprised if I stay where I can see it."

They were talking of a deep gully facing the house and running to a levee where the street
crossed.  A stream ran down it, dipped under a culvert, turned sharply, and ran away to a distant
river, spanning which they could see the bridge.  Tall old forest trees lined the banks, shrubs
and bushes grew in a thicket.  There were swaying, clambering vines and a babel of bird notes
over the seed and berry bearing bushes.

"Let's go inside, and if we agree, then we will get some water and feed the horse and eat our
lunch over there," said Kate.

"Just the thing!" said young Adam.  "Come and we will proceed to the residence of Mrs. Holt
and investigate her possibilities.  How do you like that?"

"That is fine," said Kate gravely.

"It is," said Adam, promptly, "because it is Ma. And whatever is Ma, is right."

"Good for you!" cried Kate.  "I am going to break a Bates record and kiss you good-bye, when
you go.  I probably shan't have another in years.  Come on."

They walked up the grassy wooden walk, stepped on the tiny, vine-covered porch, and lifted
and dropped a rusty old iron knocker. Almost at once the door opened, to reveal a woman of
respectable appearance, a trifle past middle age.  She made Kate think of dried sage because
she had a dried-out look and her complexion, hair, and eyes were all that colour.  She was
neat and clean while the hall into which she invited them was clean and had a wholesome odour.
Kate explained her errand.  Mrs. Holt breathed a sigh of relief.

"Well, thank goodness I was before-handed," she said.  "The teacher stayed here last year and
she was satisfied, so I ast the Trustee to mention me to the new teacher.  Nobody was expecting
you until the last of the week, but I says to myself, 'always take time by the fetlock, Samantha,
always be ready'; so last week I put in scouring my spare room to beat the nation, and it's
all ready so's you can walk right in."

"Thank you," said Kate, rather resenting the assumption that she was to have no option in the
matter.  "I have four places on my list where they want the teacher, so I thought I would look
at each of them and then decide."

"My, ain't we choicey!" said Mrs. Holt in sneering tones.  Then she changed instantly, and
in suave commendation went on:  "That's exactly right.  That's the very thing fer you to do.
After you have seen what Walden has to offer, then a pretty young thing like you can make up
your mind where you will have the most quiet fer your work, the best room, and be best fed.
One of the greatest advantages here fer a teacher is that she can be quiet, an' not have her
room rummaged. Every place else that takes boarders there's a lot of children; here there is
only me and my son, and he is grown, and will be off to his medical work next week fer the
year, so all your working time here, you'd be alone with me.  This is the room."

"That surely would be a great advantage, because I have much studying to do," said Kate as
they entered the room.

With one glance, she liked it.  It was a large room with low ceiling, quaintly papered in very
old creamy paper, scattered with delicately cut green leaves, but so carefully had the room
been kept, that it was still clean.  There were four large windows to let in light and air,
freshly washed white curtains hanging over the deep green shades.  The floor was carpeted with
a freshly washed rag carpet stretched over straw, the bed was invitingly clean and looked comfortable,
there was a wash stand with bowl and pitcher, soap and towels, a small table with a lamp, a
straight-backed chair and a rocking chair.  Mrs. Holt opened a large closet having hooks for
dresses at one end and shelves at the other.  On the top of these there were a comfort and
a pair of heavy blankets.

"Your winter covers," said Mrs. Holt, indicating these, "and there is a good stove I take out
in summer to make more room, and set up as soon as it gets cold, and that is a wood box."

She pointed out a shoe box covered with paper similar to that on the walls.

Kate examined the room carefully, the bed, the closet, and tried the chairs.  Behind the girl,
Mrs. Holt, with compressed lips, forgetting Adam's presence, watched in evident disapproval.

"I want to see the stove," said Kate.

"It is out in the woodhouse.  It hasn't been cleaned up for the winter yet."

"Then it won't be far away.  Let's look at it."

Almost wholly lacking experience, Kate was proceeding by instinct in exactly the same way her
father would have taken through experience. Mrs. Holt hesitated, then turned:  "Oh, very well,"
she said, leading the way down the hall, through the dining room, which was older in furnishing
and much more worn, but still clean and wholesome, as were the small kitchen and back porch.
From it there was only a step to the woodhouse, where on a little platform across one end sat
two small stoves for burning wood, one so small as to be tiny.  Kate walked to the larger,
lifted the top, looked inside, tried the dampers and drafts and turning said:  "That is very
small. It will require more wood than a larger one."

Mrs. Holt indicated dry wood corded to the roof.

"We git all our wood from the thicket across the way.  That little strip an' this lot is all
we have left of father's farm.  We kept this to live on, and sold the rest for town lots, all
except that gully, which we couldn't give away.  But I must say I like the trees and birds
better than mebby I'd like people who might live there; we always git our wood from it, and
the shade an' running water make it the coolest place in town."

"Yes, I suppose they do," said Kate.

She took one long look at everything as they returned to the hall.

"The Trustee told me your terms are four dollars and fifty cents a week, furnishing food and
wood," she said, "and that you allowed the last teacher to do her own washing on Saturday,
for nothing. Is that right?"

The thin lips drew more tightly.  Mrs. Holt looked at Kate from head to foot in close scrutiny.

"I couldn't make enough to pay the extra work at that," she said. "I ought to have a dollar
more, to really come out even.  I'll have to say five-fifty this fall."

"If that is the case, good-bye," said Kate.  "Thank you very much for showing me.  Five-fifty
is what I paid at Normal, it is more than I can afford in a village like this."

She turned away, followed by Adam.  They crossed the street, watered the horse at the stream,
placed his food conveniently for him, and taking their lunch box, seated themselves on a grassy
place on the bank and began eating.

"Wasn't that a pretty nice room?" asked Adam.  "Didn't you kind of hate to give it up?"

"I haven't the slightest intention of giving it up," answered Kate. "That woman is a skin-flint
and I don't propose to let her beat me.  No doubt she was glad to get four-fifty last fall.
She's only trying to see if she can wring me for a dollar more. If I have to board all next
summer, I shall have to watch every penny, or I'll not come out even, let alone saving anything.
I'll wager you a nickel that before we leave, she comes over here and offers me the room at
the same price she got last winter."

"I hope you are right," said Adam.  "How do you like her?"

"Got a grouch, nasty temper, mean disposition; clean house, good room, good cook--maybe; lives
just on the edge of comfort by daily skimping," summarized Kate.

"If she comes, are you going to try it?" asked Adam.

"Yes, I think I shall.  It is nearest my purse and requirements and if the former teacher stayed
there, it will seem all right for me; but she isn't going to put that little stove in my room.
It wouldn't heat the closet.  How did you like her?"

"Not much!" said Adam, promptly.  "If glaring at your back could have killed you, you would
have fallen dead when you examined the closet, and bedding, and stove.  She honeyed up when
she had to, but she was mad as hops.  I nearly bursted right out when she talked about 'taking
time by the fetlock.'  I wanted to tell her she looked like she had, and almost got the life
kicked out of her doing it, but I thought I'd better not."

Kate laughed.  "Yes, I noticed," she said, "but I dared not look at you.  I was afraid you'd
laugh. Isn't this a fine lunch?"

"Bet your life it is," said Adam.  "Ma never puts up any other kind."

"I wish someone admired me as much as you do your mother, Adam," said Kate.

"Well, you be as nice as Ma, and somebody is sure to," said he.

"But I never could," said Kate.

"Oh, yes, you could," said Adam, "if you would only set yourself to do it and try with all
your might to be like her.  Look, quick! That must be her 'Medical Course' man!"

Kate glanced across the way and saw a man she thought to be about thirty years of age.  He
did not resemble his mother in any particular, if he was the son of Mrs. Holt.  He was above
the average man in height, having broad, rather stooping shoulders, dark hair and eyes. He
stopped at the gate and stood a few seconds looking at them, so they could not very well study
him closely, then he went up the walk with loose, easy stride and entered the house.

"Yes, that is her son," said Kate.  "That is exactly the way a man enters a house that belongs
to him."

"That isn't the way I am going to enter my house," said Adam. "Now what shall we do?"

"Rest half an hour while they talk it over, and then get ready to go very deliberately.  If
she doesn't come across, literally and figuratively, we hunt another boarding place."

"I half believe she will come," said Adam.  "She is watching us; I can see her pull back the
blind of her room to peep."

"Keep looking ahead.  Don't let her think you see her.  Let's go up the creek and investigate
this ravine.  Isn't it a lovely place?"

"Yes.  I'm glad you got it," said Adam, "that is, if she come across. I will think of you as
having it to look at in summer; and this winter--my, what rabbit hunting there will be, and
how pretty it will look!"

So they went wandering up the ravine, sometimes on one bank, sometimes crossing stepping-stones
or logs to the other, looking, talking, until a full hour had passed when they returned to
the buggy.  Adam began changing the halter for the bridle while Kate shook out the lap robe.

"Nickel, please," whispered Kate.

Adam glanced across the street to see Mrs. Holt coming.  She approached them and with no preliminaries
said:  "I have been telling my son about you an' he hates so bad to go away and leave me alone
for the winter, that he says to take you at the same as the last teacher, even if I do lose
money on it."

"Oh, you wouldn't do that, Mrs. Holt," said Kate, carelessly.  "Of course it is for you to
decide.  I like the room, and if the board was right for the other teacher it will be for me.
If you want me to stay, I'll bring my things over and take the room at once.  If not, I'll
look farther."

"Come right over," said Mrs. Holt, cordially.  "I am anxious to git on the job of mothering
such a sweet young lady.  What will you have for your supper?"

"Whatever you are having," said Kate.  "I am not accustomed to ordering my meals.  Adam, come
and help me unpack."

In half an hour Kate had her dresses on the hooks, her underclothing on the shelves, her books
on the table, her pencils and pen in the robin cup, and was saying goodbye to Adam, and telling
him what to tell his father, mother, and Nancy Ellen--if he could get a stolen interview with
her on the way home.  He also promised to write Kate what happened about the home school and
everything in which she would be interested. Then she went back to her room, sat in the comfortable
rocking chair, and with nothing in the world she was obliged to do immediately, she stared
at the opposite wall and day by day reviewed the summer.  She sat so long and stared at the
wall so intently that gradually it dissolved and shaped into the deep green ravine across the
way, which sank into soothing darkness and the slowly lightened until a peep of gold came over
the tree tops; and then, a red sun crept up having a big wonderful widespread wing on each
side of it.  Kate's head fell with a jerk which awakened her, so she arose, removed her dress,
washed and brushed her hair, put on a fresh dress and taking a book, she crossed the street
and sat on the bank of the stream again, which she watched instead of reading, as she had intended.

CHAPTER VI

KATE'S PRIVATE PUPIL

AT FIRST Kate merely sat in a pleasant place and allowed her nerves to settle, after the short
nap she had enjoyed in the rocking chair.  It was such a novel experience for her to sit idle,
that despite the attractions of growing things, running water, and singing birds, she soon
veered to thoughts of what she would be doing if she were at home, and that brought her to
the fact that she was forbidden her father's house; so if she might not go there, she was homeless.
As she had known her father for nearly nineteen years, for she had a birth anniversary coming
in a few days, she felt positive that he never would voluntarily see her again, while with
his constitution, he would live for years. She might as well face the fact that she was homeless;
and prepare to pay her way all the year round.  She wondered why she felt so forlorn and what
made the dull ache in her throat.

She remembered telling Nancy Ellen before going away to Normal that she wished her father would
drive her from home.  Now that was accomplished.  She was away from home, in a place where
there was not one familiar face, object, or plan of life, but she did not wish for it at all.
She devoutly wished that she were back at home even if she were preparing supper, in order
that Nancy Ellen might hem towels.  She wondered what they were saying:  her mind was crystal
clear as to what they were doing.  She wondered if Nancy Ellen would send Adam, 3d, with a
parcel of cut-out sewing for her to work on.  She resolved to sew quickly and with stitches
of machine-like evenness, if it came.  She wondered if Nancy Ellen would be compelled to put
off her wedding and teach the home school in order that it might be taught by a Bates, as her
father had demanded.  She wondered if Nancy Ellen was forced to this uncongenial task, whether
it would sour the wonderful sweetness developed by her courtship, and make her so provoked
that she would not write or have anything to do with her.  They were nearly the same age; they
had shared rooms, and, until recently, beds, and whatever life brought them; now Kate lifted
her head and ran her hand against her throat to ease the ache gathering there more intensely
every minute. With eyes that did not see, she sat staring at the sheer walls of the ravine
as it ran toward the east, where the water came tumbling and leaping down over stones and shale
bed.  When at last she arose she had learned one lesson, not in the History she carried.  No
matter what its disadvantages are, having a home of any kind is vastly preferable to having
none.  And the casualness of people so driven by the demands of living and money making that
they do not take time even to be slightly courteous and kind, no matter how objectionable it
may be, still that, even that, is better than their active displeasure.  So she sat brooding
and going over and over the summer, arguing her side of the case, honestly trying to see theirs,
until she was mentally exhausted and still had accomplished nothing further than arriving at
the conclusion that if Nancy Ellen was forced to postpone her wedding she would turn against
her and influence Robert Gray in the same feeling.

Then Kate thought of Him.  She capitalized him in her thought, for after nineteen years of
Bates men Robert Gray would seem a deified creature to their women.  She reviewed the scene
at the crossing log, while her face flushed with pleasure.  If she had remained at home and
had gone after the blackberries, as it was sure as fate that she would have done, then she
would have met him first, and he would have courted her instead of Nancy Ellen.  Suddenly Kate
shook herself savagely and sat straight.  "Why, you big fool!" she said.  "Nancy Ellen went
to the berry patch in a pink dress, wearing a sunbonnet to match, and carrying a blue bowl.
Think of the picture she made!  But if I had gone, I'd have been in a ragged old dirt-coloured
gingham, Father's boots, and his old straw hat jammed down to my ears; I'd have been hot and
in a surly temper, rebelling because I had the berries to pick.  He would have taken one look
at me, jumped the fence, and run to Lang's for dear life.  Better cut that idea right out!"

So Kate "cut that idea out" at once, but the operation was painful, because when one turns
mental surgeon and operates on the ugly spots in one's disposition, there is no anaesthetic,
nor is the work done with skilful hands, so the wounds are numerous and leave ugly scars; but
Kate was ruthless.  She resolved never to think of that brook scene again.  In life, as she
had lived it, she would not have profited by having been first at the berry patch.  Yet she
had a right to think of Robert Gray's face, grave in concern for her, his offers to help, the
influence he would have in her favour with Nancy Ellen.  Of course if he was forced to postpone
his wedding he would not be pleased; but it was impossible that the fears which were tormenting
Nancy Ellen would materialize into action on his part.  No sane man loved a woman as beautiful
as her sister and cast her aside because of a few months' enforced waiting, the cause of which
he so very well knew; but it would make both of them unhappy and change their beautiful plans,
after he even had found and purchased the house.  Still Nancy Ellen said that her father was
making it a point of honour that a Bates should teach the school, because he had signed the
contract for Kate to take the place Nancy Ellen had intended to fill, and then changed her
plans.  He had sworn that a Bates should teach the school.  Well, Hiram had taken the county
examination, as all pupils of the past ten years had when they finished the country schools.
It was a test required to prove whether they had done their work well.  Hiram held a certificate
for a year, given him by the County Superintendent, when he passed the examinations.  He had
never used it.  He could teach; he was Nancy Ellen's twin.  School did not begin until the
first of November.  He could hire help with his corn if he could not finish alone.  He could
arise earlier than usual and do his feeding and milking; he could clean the stables, haul wood
on Saturday and Sunday, if he must, for the Bates family looked on Sunday more as a day of
rest for the horses and physical man than as one of religious observances.  They always worked
if there was anything to be gained by it.  Six months being the term, he would be free by the
first of May; surely the money would be an attraction, while Nancy Ellen could coach him on
any new methods she had learned at Normal.  Kate sprang to her feet, ran across the street,
and entering the hall, hurried to her room.  She found Mrs. Holt there in the act of closing
her closet door.  Kate looked at her with astonished eyes.

"I was just telling my son," Mrs. Holt said rather breathlessly, "that I would take a peep
and see if I had forgot to put your extra covers on the shelf."

Kate threw her book on the bed and walked to the table.  She had experienced her share of battle
for the day.  "No children to rummage," passed through her brain.  It was the final week of
hot, dry August weather, while a point had been made of calling her attention to the extra
cover when the room had been shown her. She might have said these things, but why say them?
The shamed face of the woman convicted her of "rummaging," as she had termed it.  Without a
word Kate sat down beside the table, drew her writing material before her, and began addressing
an envelope to her brother Hiram.  Mrs. Holt left the room, disliking Kate more than if she
had said what the woman knew she thought.

Kate wrote briefly, convincingly, covering every objection and every advantage she could conceive,
and then she added the strongest plea she could make.  What Hiram would do, she had no idea.
As with all Bates men, land was his God, but it required money to improve it.  He would feel
timid about making a first attempt to teach after he was married and a father of a child, but
Nancy Ellen's marriage would furnish plausible excuse; all of the family had done their school
work as perfectly as all work they undertook; he could teach if he wanted to; would he want
to?  If he did, at least, she would be sure of the continued friendship of her sister and Robert
Gray.  Suddenly Kate understood what that meant to her as she had not realized before.  She
was making long strides toward understanding herself, which is the most important feature of
any life.

She sent a line of pleading to her sister-in-law, a word of love to the baby, and finishing
her letter, started to post it, as she remembered the office was only a few steps down the
street.  In the hall it occurred to her that she was the "Teacher" now, and so should be an
example.  Possibly the women of Walden did not run bareheaded down the street on errands. 
She laid the letter on a small shelf of an old hatrack, and stepped back to her room to put
on her hat.  Her return was so immediate that Mrs. Holt had the letter in her fingers when
Kate came back, and was reading the address so intently, that with extended hand, the girl
said in cold tones:  "My letter, please!" before the woman realized she was there.  Their eyes
met in a level look.  Mrs. Holt's mouth opened in ready excuse, but this time Kate's temper
overcame her better judgment.

"Can you read it clearly, without your glasses?" she asked politely. "I wouldn't for the world
have you make a mistake as to whom my letter is addressed.  It goes to my brother Hiram Bates,
youngest son of Adam Bates, Bates Corners, Hartley, Indiana."

"I was going to give it to my son, so that he could take it to the office," said Mrs. Holt.

"And I am going to take it myself, as I know your son is down town and I want it to go over
on the evening hack, so it will be sure to go out early in the morning."

Surprise overcame Mrs. Holt's discomfiture.

"Land sakes!" she cried.  "Bates is such a common name it didn't mean a thing to me.  Be you
a daughter of Adam Bates, the Land King, of Bates Corners?"

"I be," said Kate tersely.

"Well, I never!  All them hundreds of acres of land an' money in the bank an' mortgages on
half his neighbours.  Whut the nation! An' no more of better clo's an' you got! An' teachin'
school! I never heard of the like in all my days!"

"If you have Bates history down so fine, you should know that every girl of the entire Bates
family has taught from the time she finished school until she married.  Also we never buy more
clothing than we need, or of the kind not suitable for our work. This may explain why we own
some land and have a few cents in the Bank.  My letter, please."

Kate turned and went down the street, a dull red tingeing her face.  "I could hate that woman
cordially without half trying," she said.

The house was filled with the odour of cooking food when she returned and soon she was called
to supper.  As she went to the chair indicated for her, a step was heard in the hall.  Kate
remained standing and when a young man entered the room Mrs. Holt at once introduced her son,
George.  He did not take the trouble to step around the table and shake hands, but muttered
a gruff "howdy do?" and seating himself, at once picked up the nearest dish and began filling
his plate.

His mother would have had matters otherwise.  "Why, George," she chided.  "What's your hurry?
Why don't you brush up and wait on Miss Bates first?"

"Oh, if she is going to be one of the family," he said, "she will have to learn to get on without
much polly-foxing.  Grub is to eat.  We can all reach at a table of this size."

Kate looked at George Holt with a searching glance.  Surely he was almost thirty, of average
height, appeared strong, and as if he might have a forceful brain; but he was loosely jointed
and there was a trace of domineering selfishness on his face that was repulsive to her.  "I
could hate that MAN cordially, without half trying," she thought to herself, smiling faintly
at the thought.

The sharp eyes of Mrs. Holt detected the smile.  She probably would have noticed it, if Kate
had merely thought of smiling.

"Why do you smile, my dear?" she asked in melting tone.

"Oh, I was feeling so at home," answered Kate, suavely. "Father and the boys hold exactly those
opinions and practise them in precisely the same way; only if I were to think about it at all,
I should think that a man within a year of finishing a medical course would begin exercising
politeness with every woman he meets.  I believe a doctor depends on women to be most of his
patients, and women don't like a rude doctor."

"Rot!" said George Holt.

"Miss Bates is exactly right," said his mother.  "Ain't I been tellin' you the whole endurin'
time that you'd never get a call unless you practised manners as well as medicine?  Ain't I, now?"

"Yes, you have," he said, angrily.  "But if you think all of a sudden that manners are so essential,
why didn't you hammer some into me when you had the whip hand and could do what you pleased?
You didn't find any fault with my manners, then."

"How of all the world was I to know that you'd grow up and go in for doctorin'?  I s'pos'd
then you'd take the farm an' run it like your pa did, stead of forcin' me to sell it off by
inches to live, an' then you wastin' half the money."

"Go it, Mother," said George Holt, rudely.  "Tell all you know, and then piece out with anything
you can think of that you don't."

Mrs. Holt's face flushed crimson.  She looked at Kate and said vindictively:  "If you want
any comfort in life, never marry and bring a son inter the world.  You kin humour him, and
cook for him, an work your hands to the bone fur him, and sell your land, and spend all you
can raise educatin' him for half a dozen things, an' him never stickin to none or payin' back
a cent, but sass in your old age--"

"Go it, Mother, you're doing fine!" said George.  "If you keep on Miss Bates will want to change
her boarding place before morning."

"It will not be wholly your mother's fault, if I do," said Kate. "I would suggest that if we
can't speak civilly, we eat our supper in silence.  This is very good food; I could enjoy it,
if I had a chance."

She helped herself to another soda biscuit and a second piece of fried chicken and calmly began
eating them.

"That's a good idy!" said Mrs. Holt.

"Then why don't you practice it?" said her son.

Thereupon began a childish battle for the last word.  Kate calmly arose, picked up her plate,
walked from the room, down the hall, and entering her own room, closed the door quietly.

"You fool!  You great big dunderheaded fool!" cried Mrs. Holt. "Now you have done it, for the
thousandth time.  She will start out in less than no time to find some place else to stay,
an' who could blame her? Don't you know who she is?  Ain't you sense in your head?  If there
was ever a girl you ort to go after, and go quick an' hard, there she is!"

"What?  That big beef!  What for?" asked George.

"You idjit!  You idjit!  Don't you sense that she's a daughter of Adam Bates?  Him they call
the Land King.  Ain't you sense ner reason? Drive her from the house, will you?  An' me relyin'
on sendin' you half her board money to help you out?  You fool!"

"Why under the Heavens didn't you tell me?  How could I know?  No danger but the bowl is upset,
and it's all your fault.  She should be worth ten thousand, maybe twenty!"

"I never knew till jist before supper.  I got it frum a letter she wrote to her brother.  I'd
no chanct to tell you.  Course I meant to, first chanct I had; but you go to work an upset
everything before I get a chanct.  You never did amount to anything, an' you never will."

"Oh, well, now stop that.  I didn't know.  I thought she was just common truck.  I'll fix it
up with her right after supper.  Now shut up."

"You can't do it!  It's gone too far.  She'll leave the house inside fifteen minutes," said
Mrs. Holt.

"Well, I'll just show you," he boasted.

George Holt pushed back his plate, wiped his mouth, brushed his teeth at the washing place
on the back porch, and sauntered around the house to seat himself on the front porch steps.
Kate saw him there and remained in her room.  When he had waited an hour he arose and tapped
on her door.  Kate opened it.

"Miss Bates," he said.  "I have been doing penance an hour.  I am very sorry I was such a boor.
I was in earnest when I said I didn't get the gad when I needed it.  I had a big disappointment
to-day, and I came in sore and cross.  I am ashamed of myself, but you will never see me that
way again.  I know I will make a failure of my profession if I don't be more polite than Mother
ever taught me to be.  Won't you let me be your scholar, too? Please do come over to the ravine
where it is cool and give me my first lesson.  I need you dreadfully."

Kate was desperately in need of human companionship in that instant, herself, someone who could
speak, and sin, and suffer, and repent.  As she looked straight in the face of the man before
her she saw, not him being rude and quarrelling pettily with his mother, but herself racing
around the dining table pursued by her father raving like an insane man.  Who was she to judge
or to refuse help when it was asked?  She went with him; and Mrs. Holt, listening and peering
from the side of the window blind of her room across the hall, watched them cross the road
and sit beside each other on the bank of the ravine in what seemed polite and amicable conversation.
So she heaved a deep sigh of relief and went to wash the dishes and plan breakfast.  "Better
feed her up pretty well 'til she gits the habit of staying here and mebby the rest who take
boarders will be full," she said to herself.  "Time enough to go at skimpin' when she's settled,
and busy, an' I get the whip hand."

But in planning to get the "whip hand" Mrs. Holt reckoned without Kate. She had been under
the whip hand all her life.  Her dash to freedom had not been accomplished without both mental
and physical hurt.  She was doing nothing but going over her past life minutely, and as she
realized more fully with each review how barren and unlovely it had been, all the strength
and fresh young pride in her arose in imperative demand for something better in the future.
She listened with interest to what George Holt said to her.  All her life she had been driven
by a man of inflexible will, his very soul inoculated with greed for possessions which would
give him power; his body endowed with unfailing strength to meet the demands he made on it,
and his heart wholly lacking in sentiment; but she did not propose to start her new life by
speaking of her family to strangers.  George Holt's experiences had been those of a son spoiled
by a weak woman, one day petted, the next bribed, the next nagged, again left to his own devices
for days, with strong inherited tendencies to be fought, tendencies to what he did not say.
Looking at his heavy jaw and swarthy face, Kate supplied "temper" and "not much inclination
to work."  He had asked her to teach him, she would begin by setting him an example in the
dignity of self-control; then she would make him work.  How she would make that big, strong
man work!  As she sat there on the bank of the ravine, with a background of delicately leafed
bushes and the light of the setting sun on her face and her hair, George Holt studied her closely,
mentally and physically, and would have given all he possessed if he had not been so hasty.
He saw that she had a good brain and courage to follow her convictions, while on closer study
he decided that she was moulded on the finest physical lines of any woman he ever had seen,
also his study of medicine taught him to recognize glowing health, and to set a right estimate
on it.  Truly he was sorry, to the bottom of his soul, but he did not believe in being too
humble.  He said as much in apology as he felt forced, and then set himself the task of calling
out and parading the level best he could think up concerning himself, or life in general. 
He had tried farming, teaching, merchandise, and law before he had decided his vocation was
medicine. 

Her face, which had been pale, was all aflame as she glanced up at Hesden with a frightened look,
while he went on.

"I do not believe that you would intentionally be unjust. So, if you will permit me, I will
ask you one question. If you knew that on the day of your departure, and for several succeeding
days, a human life was absolutely dependent upon my care and watchfulness, would you consider
me excusable for failure to learn of your unannounced departure, or for not immediately following
you hither on learning that fact?" He paused, evidently expecting a reply.

"Surely, Mr. Le Moyne," she said, looking up at him in wide-eyed wonder, "you know I would."

"And
would you believe my word if I assured you that this was the fact?"

"Of course I would."

"I am very glad. Such was the case; and that alone prevented my following you and insisting
on your immediate return."

"I did not know your mother had been so ill," she said, with some contrition in her voice.

"It
was not my mother. I am sorry, but I cannot tell you now who it was. You will know all about
it some time. And more than that," he continued, "on the fourth day after you had gone, one
who had saved my life in battle came and asked me to acknowledge my debt by performing an important
service for him, which has required nearly all my time since that."

"Oh, Mr. Le Moyne!" she said, as the tears came into her eyes, "please forgive my anger and
injustice."

"I have nothing to forgive," he said. "You were not unjust--only ignorant of the facts, and your
anger was but natural."

"Yet I should have known better.

I should have trusted you more," said she, sobbing.

"Well, do not mind it," he said, soothingly. "But if my explanation is thus far sufficient, will
you allow me to sit down while I tell you the rest? The story is a somewhat long one."

"Oh, pray do, Mr. Le Moyne. Excuse my rudeness as well as my anger. Please be seated and let
me take your hat."

She took the hat and laid it on a table at the side of the room, and then returned and listened
to his story. He told her all that he had told his mother the night before, explaining such
things as he thought she might not fully understand. Then he showed her the pocket-book and the
will, which he had brought with him for that purpose.

At first she listened to what he said with a constrained and embarrassed air. He had not proceeded
far, however, before she began to manifest a lively interest in his words. She leaned forward and
gazed into his face with an absorbed earnestness that awakened his
surprise. Two or three times she reached out her hand, and her lips
moved, as though she would interrupt him. He stopped; but, without
speaking, she nodded for him to go on. When he handed her the pocket-book
and the will, she took them with a trembling hand and examined them
with the utmost care. The student-lamp had been lighted before his
story was ended. Her face was in the soft light which came through
the porcelain shade, but her hands were in the circle of bright light
that escaped beneath it. He noticed that they trembled so that they
could scarcely hold the paper she was trying to read. He asked if
he should not read it for her. She handed him the will, but kept the
pocketbook tightly clasped in both hands, with the rude scrawl,

MARBLEHEAD,
MASS.,

in full view. She listened nervously to the reading, never
once looking up. When he had finished, she said,

"And you say the
land mentioned there is the plantation you now occupy?"

"It embraces
my mother's plantation and much more. Indeed, this very plantation
of Red Wing, except the little tract around the house here, is a part
of it. The Red Wing Ordinary tract is mentioned as one of those which
adjoins it upon the west. This is the west line, and the house at
Mulberry Hill is very near the eastern edge. It is a narrow tract,
running down on this side the river until it comes to the big bend
near the ford, which it crosses, and keeps on to the eastward.

"It
is a large belt, though I do not suppose it was then of any great
value--perhaps not worth more than a shilling an acre. It is almost
impossible to realize how cheap land was in this region at that time.
A man of moderate wealth might have secured almost a county. She over-ruled the proxy objections he so kindly offered
her, so he was obliged to drag his tired body up the trees on both banks for several hundred
yards and drop the dead wood.  Kate marshalled a corps of boys who would be her older pupils
and they dragged out the dry branches, saved all that were suitable for firewood, and made
bonfires from the remainder.  They raked the tin cans and town refuse of years from the water
and banks and induced the village delivery man to haul the stuff to the river bridge and dump
it in the deepest place in the stream. They cleaned the creek bank to the water's edge and
built rustic seats down the sides.  They even rolled boulders to the bed and set them where
the water would show their markings and beat itself to foam against them.  Mrs. Holt looked
on in breathless amazement and privately expressed to her son her opinion of him in terse and
vigorous language.  He answered laconically:  "Has a fish got much to say about what happens
to it after you get it out of the water?"

"No!" snapped Mrs. Holt, "and neither have you, if you kill yourself to get it."

"Do I look killed?" inquired her son.

"No. You look the most like a real man I ever saw you," she conceded.

"And Kate Bates won't need glasses for forty years yet," he said as he went back to his work
in the ravine.

Kate was in the middle of the creek helping plant a big stone.  He stood a second watching
her as she told the boys surrounding her how best to help her, then he turned away, a dull
red burning his cheek. "I'll have her if I die for it," he muttered, "but I hope to Heaven
she doesn't think I am going to work like this for her every day of my life."

As the villagers sauntered past and watched the work of the new teacher, many of them thought
of things at home they could do that would improve their premises greatly, and a few went home
and began work of like nature.  That made their neighbours' places look so unkempt that they
were forced to trim, and rake, and mend in turn, so by the time the school began, the whole
village was busy in a crusade that extended to streets and alleys, while the new teacher was
the most popular person who had ever been there. Without having heard of such a thing, Kate
had started Civic Improvement.

George Holt leaned against a tree trunk and looked down at her as he rested.

"Do you suppose there is such a thing as ever making anything out of this?" he asked.

"A perfectly lovely public park for the village, yes; money, selling it for anything, no! 
It's too narrow a strip, cut too deeply with the water, the banks too steep.  Commercially,
I can't see that it is worth ten cents."

"Cheering!  It is the only thing on earth that truly and wholly belongs to me. The road divided
the land.  Father willed everything on the south side to Mother, so she would have the house,
and the land on this side was mine. I sold off all I could to Jasper Linn to add to his farm,
but he would only buy to within about twenty rods of the ravine. The land was too rocky and
poor. So about half a mile of this comprises my earthly possessions."

"Do you keep up the taxes?" she asked.

"No. I've never paid them," he said carelessly.

"Then don't be too sure it is yours," she said.  "Someone may have paid them and taken the
land.  You had better look it up."

"What for?" he demanded.

"It is beautiful.  It is the shadiest, coolest place in town. Having it here doubles the value
of your mother's house across the street.  In some way, some day, it might turn out to be worth
something."

"I can't see how," he said.

"Some of the trees may become valuable when lumber gets scarcer, as it will when the land grows
older. Maybe a stone quarry could be opened up, if the stone runs back as far as you say. 
A lot of things might make it valuable.  If I were you I would go to Hartley, quietly, to-morrow,
and examine the records, and if there are back taxes I'd pay them."

"I'll look it up, anyway," he agreed.  "You surely have made another place of it.  It will
be wonderful by spring."

"I can think of many uses for it," said Kate.  "Here comes your mother to see how we are getting
along."

Instead, she came to hand Kate a letter she had brought from the post office while doing her
marketing.  Kate took the letter, saw at a glance that it was from Nancy Ellen, and excusing
herself, she went to one of the seats they had made, and turning her face so that it could
not be seen, she read:

DEAR KATE:  You can prepare yourself for the surprise of your life. Two Bates men have done
something for one of their women. I hope you will survive the shock; it almost finished me
and Mother is still speechless.  I won't try to prepare you. I could not.  Here it is. Father
raged for three days and we got out of his way like scared rabbits.  I saw I had to teach,
so I said I would, but I had not told Robert, because I couldn't bear to. Then up came Hiram
and offered to take the school for me.  Father said no, I couldn't get out of it that way.
Hiram said I had not seen him or sent him any word, and I could prove by mother I hadn't been
away from the house, so Father believed him.  He said he wanted the money to add two acres
to his land from the Simms place; that would let his stock down to water on the far side of
his land where it would be a great convenience and give him a better arrangement of fields
so he could make more money.  You know Father. He shut up like a clam and only said:  "Do what
you please.  If a Bates teaches the school it makes my word good."  So Hiram is going to teach
for me.  He is brushing up a little nights and I am helping him on "theory," and I am wild
with joy, and so is Robert.  I shall have plenty of time to do all my sewing and we shall be
married at, or after, Christmas.  Robert says to tell you to come to see him if you ever come
to Hartley.  He is there in his office now and it is lonesome, but I am busy and the time will
soon pass.  I might as well tell you that Father said right after you left that you should
never enter his house again, and Mother and I should not speak your name before him.  I do
hope he gets over it before the wedding.  Write me how you like your school, and where you
board.  Maybe Robert and I can slip off and drive over to see you some day. But that would
make Father so mad if he found out that he would not give me the money he promised; so we had
better not, but you come to see us as soon as we get in our home.  Love from both, NANCY ELLEN.

Kate read the joyful letter slowly.  It contained all she hoped for. She had not postponed
Nancy Ellen's wedding.  That was all she asked. She had known she would not be forgiven so
soon, there was slight hope she ever would.  Her only chance, thought Kate, lay in marrying
a farmer having about a thousand acres of land. If she could do that, her father would let
her come home again sometime.  She read the letter slowly over, then tearing it in long strips
she cross tore them and sifted the handful of small bits on the water, where they started a
dashing journey toward the river.  Mrs. Holt, narrowly watching her, turned with snaky gleaming
eyes to her son and whispered:  "A-ha! Miss Smart Alec has a secret!"

CHAPTER VII

HELPING NANCY ELLEN AND ROBERT TO ESTABLISH A HOME

THE remainder of the time before leaving, George Holt spent in the very strongest mental and
physical effort to show Kate how much of a man he was. He succeeded in what he hoped he might
do.  He so influenced her in his favour that during the coming year whenever any one showed
signs of criticising him, Kate stopped them by commendation, based upon what she supposed to
be knowledge of him.

With the schoolhouse and grounds cleaned as they never had been before, the parents and pupils
naturally expected new methods. During the week spent in becoming acquainted with the teacher,
the parents heartily endorsed her, while the pupils liked her cordially.  It could be seen
at a glance that she could pick up the brawniest of them, and drop him from the window, if
she chose. The days at the stream had taught them her physical strength, while at the same
time they had glimpses of her mental processes. The boys learned many things:  that they must
not lie or take anything which did not belong to them; that they must be considerate and manly,
if they were to be her friends; yet not one word had been said on any of these subjects.  As
she spoke to them, they answered her, and soon spoke in the same way to each other.  She was
very careful about each statement she made, often adducing convenient proof, so they saw that
she was always right, and never exaggerated. The first hour of this made the boys think, the
second they imitated, the third they instantly obeyed. She started in to interest and educate
these children; she sent them home to investigate more subjects the first day than they had
ever carried home in any previous month.  Boys suddenly began asking their fathers about business;
girls questioned their mothers about marketing and housekeeping.

The week of Christmas vacation was going to be the hardest; everyone expected the teacher to
go home for the Holidays.  Many of them knew that her sister was marrying the new doctor of
Hartley.  When Kate was wondering how she could possibly conceal the rupture with her family,
Robert Gray drove into Walden and found her at the schoolhouse.  She was so delighted to see
him that she made no attempt to conceal her joy.  He had driven her way for exercise and to
pay her a call.  When he realized from her greeting how she had felt the separation from her
family, he had an idea that he at once propounded:  "Kate, I have come to ask a favour of you,"
he said.

"Granted!" laughed Kate.  "Whatever can it be?"

"Just this! I want you to pack a few clothes, drive to Hartley with me and do what you can
to straighten out the house, so there won't be such confusion when Nancy Ellen gets there."

Kate stared at him in a happy daze.  "Oh, you blessed Robert Gray! What a Heavenly idea!" she
cried.  "Of course it wouldn't be possible for me to fix Nancy Ellen's house the way she would,
but I could put everything where it belonged, I could arrange well enough, and I could have
a supper ready, so that you could come straight home."

"Then you will do it?" he asked.

"Do it?" cried Kate. "Do it!  Why, I would be willing to pay you for the chance to do it. 
How do you think I'm to explain my not going home for the Holidays, and to my sister's wedding,
and retain my self-respect before my patrons?"

"I didn't think of it in that way," he said.

"I'm crazy," said Kate.  "Take me quickly!  How far along are you?"

"House cleaned, blinds up, stoves all in, coal and wood, cellar stocked, carpets down, and
furniture all there, but not unwrapped or in place.  Dishes delivered but not washed; cooking
utensils there, but not cleaned."

"Enough said," laughed Kate.  "You go marry Nancy Ellen.  I shall have the house warm, arranged
so you can live in it, and the first meal ready when you come.  Does Nancy Ellen know you are
here?"

"No.  I have enough country practice that I need a horse; I'm trying this one. I think of you
often so I thought I'd drive out. How are you making it, Kate?"

"Just fine, so far as the school goes.  I don't particularly like the woman I board with. 
Her son is some better, yes, he is much better. And Robert, what is a Zonoletic Doctor?"

"A poor fool, too lazy to be a real doctor, with no conscience about taking people's money
for nothing," he said.

"As bad as THAT?" asked Kate.

"Worse! Why?" he said.

"Oh, I only wondered," said Kate.  "Now I am ready, here; but I must run to the house where
I board a minute.  It's only a step. You watch where I go, and drive down."

She entered the house quietly and going back to the kitchen she said: "The folks have come
for me, Mrs. Holt.  I don't know exactly when I shall be back, but in plenty of time to start
school.  If George goes before I return, tell him 'Merry Christmas,' for me."

"He'll be most disappointed to death," said Mrs. Holt.

"I don't see why he should," said Kate, calmly.  "You never have had the teacher here at Christmas."

"We never had a teacher that I wanted before," said Mrs. Holt; while Kate turned to avoid seeing
the woman's face as she perjured herself. "You're like one of the family, George is crazy about
you.  He wrote me to be sure to keep you.  Couldn't you possibly stay over Sunday?"

"No, I couldn't," said Kate.

"Who came after you?" asked Mrs. Holt.

"Dr. Gray," answered Kate.

"That new doctor at Hartley? Why, be you an' him friends?"

Mrs. Holt had followed down the hall, eagerly waiting in the doorway. Kate glanced at her and
felt sudden pity.  The woman was warped. Everything in her life had gone wrong.  Possibly she
could not avoid being the disagreeable person she was.  Kate smiled at her.

"Worse than that," she said.  "We be relations in a few days. He's going to marry my sister
Nancy Ellen next Tuesday."

Kate understood the indistinct gurgle she heard to be approving, so she added:  "He came after
me early so I could go to Hartley and help get their new house ready for them to live in after
the ceremony."

"Did your father give them the house?" asked Mrs. Holt eagerly.

"No. Dr. Gray bought his home," said Kate.

"How nice!  What did your father give them?"

Kate's patience was exhausted.  "You'll have to wait until I come back," she said.  "I haven't
the gift of telling about things before they have happened."

Then she picked up her telescope and saying "good-bye," left the house.

As they drove toward Hartley:  "I'm anxious to see your house," said Kate.  "Did you find one
in a good neighbourhood?"

"The very best, I think," said the doctor.  "That is all one could offer Nancy Ellen."

"I'm so glad for her!  And I'm glad for you, too!  She'll make you a beautiful wife in every
way.  She's a good cook, she knows how to economize, and she's too pretty for words, if she
IS my sister."

"I heartily agree with you," said the doctor.  "But I notice you put the cook first and the
beauty last."

"You will, too, before you get through with it," answered Kate.

"Here we are!" said he, soon after they entered Hartley. "I'll drive around the block, so you
can form an idea of the location." Kate admired every house in the block, the streets and trees,
the one house Robert Gray had selected in every particular.  They went inside and built fires,
had lunch together at the hotel, and then Kate rolled up her sleeves and with a few yards of
cheese-cloth for a duster, began unwrapping furniture and standing it in the room where it
belonged. Robert moved the heavy pieces, then he left to call on a patient and spend the evening
with Nancy Ellen.

So Kate spent several happy days setting Nancy Ellen's new home in order. From basement to
garret she had it immaculate and shining. No Bates girl, not even Agatha, ever had gone into
a home having so many comforts and conveniences.

Kate felt lonely the day she knew her home was overcrowded with all their big family; she sat
very still thinking of them during the hour of the ceremony; she began preparing supper almost
immediately, because Robert had promised her that he would not eat any more of the wedding
feast than he could help, and he would bring Nancy Ellen as soon afterward as possible.  Kate
saw them drive to the gate and come up the walk together.  As they entered the door Nancy Ellen
was saying:  "Why, how does the house come to be all lighted up?  Seems to me I smell things
to eat.  Well, if the table isn't all set!"

There was a pause and then Nancy Ellen's clear voice called: "Kate! Kate!  Where are you? 
Nobody else would be THIS nice to me.  You dear girl, where are you?"

"I'll get to stay until I go back to school!" was Kate's mental comment as she ran to clasp
Nancy Ellen in her arms, while they laughed and very nearly cried together, so that the doctor
felt it incumbent upon him to hug both of them.  Shortly afterward he said:  "There is a fine
show in town to-night, and I have three tickets.  Let's all go."

"Let's eat before we go," said Nancy Ellen, "I haven't had time to eat a square meal for a
week and things smell deliciously."

They finished their supper leisurely, stacked the dishes and went to the theatre, where they
saw a fair performance of a good play, which was to both of the girls a great treat.  When
they returned home, Kate left Nancy Ellen and Robert to gloat over the carpets they had selected,
as they appeared on their floors, to arrange the furniture and re-examine their wedding gifts;
while she slipped into the kitchen and began washing the dishes and planning what she would
have for breakfast.  But soon they came to her and Nancy Ellen insisted on wiping the dishes,
while Robert carried them to the cupboard. Afterward, they sat before their fireplace and talked
over events since the sisters' separation.

Nancy Ellen told about getting ready for her wedding, life at home, the school, the news of
the family; the Kate drew a perfect picture of the Walden school, her boarding place, Mrs.
Holt, the ravine, the town and the people, with the exception of George Holt--him she never
mentioned.

After Robert had gone to his office the following morning, Kate said to Nancy Ellen:  "Now
I wish you would be perfectly frank with me--"

"As if I could be anything else!" laughed the bride.

"All right, then," said Kate. "What I want is this:  that these days shall always come back
to you in memory as nearly perfect as possible. Now if my being here helps ever so little,
I like to stay, and I'll be glad to cook and wash dishes, while you fix your house to suit
you. But if you'd rather be alone, I'll go back to Walden and be satisfied and happy with the
fine treat this has been.  I can look everyone in the face now, talk about the wedding, and
feel all right."

Nancy Ellen said slowly:  "I shan't spare you until barely time to reach your school Monday
morning.  And I'm not keeping you to work for me, either!  We'll do everything together, and
then we'll plan how to make the house pretty, and go see Robert in his office, and go shopping.
I'll never forgive you if you go."

"Why, Nancy Ellen--!" said Kate, then fled to the kitchen too happy to speak further.

None of them ever forgot that week. It was such a happy time that all of them dreaded its end;
but when it came they parted cheerfully, and each went back to work, the better for the happy
reunion.  Kate did not return to Walden until Monday; then she found Mrs. Holt in an evil temper.
Kate could not understand it. She had no means of knowing that for a week George had nagged
his mother unceasingly because Kate was gone on his return, and would not be back until after
time for him to go again.  The only way for him to see her during the week he had planned to
come out openly as her lover, was to try to find her at her home, or at her sister's.  He did
not feel that it would help him to go where he never had been asked.  His only recourse was
to miss a few days of school and do extra work to make it up; but he detested nothing in life
as he detested work, so the world's happy week had been to them one of constant sparring and
unhappiness, for which Mrs. Holt blamed Kate.  Her son had returned expecting to court Kate
Bates strenuously; his disappointment was not lightened by his mother's constant nagging. Monday
forenoon she went to market, and came in gasping.

"Land sakes!" she cried as she panted down the hall.  "I've got a good one on that impident
huzzy now!"

"You better keep your mouth shut, and not gossip about her," he said. "Everyone likes her!"

"No, they don't, for I hate her worse 'n snakes!  If it wa'n't for her money I'd fix her so's
'at she'd never marry you in kingdom come."

George Holt clenched his big fist.

"Just you try it!" he threatened.  "Just you try that!"

"You'll live to see the day you'd thank me if I did.  She ain't been home.  Mind you, she ain't
been HOME!  She never seen her sister married at all!  Tilly Nepple has a sister, living near
the Bates, who worked in the kitchen.  She's visitin' at Tilly's now. Miss High-and-Mighty
never seen her sister married at all!  An' it looked mighty queer, her comin' here a week ahead
of time, in the fall.  Looks like she'd done somepin she don't DARE go home.  No wonder she
tears every scrap of mail she gets to ribbons an' burns it.  I told you she had a secret! 
If ever you'd listen to me."

"Why, you're crazy!" he exclaimed.  "I did listen to you.  What you told me was that I should
go after her with all my might.  So I did it. Now you come with this.  Shut it up!  Don't let
her get wind of it for the world!"

"And Tilly Nepple's sister says old Land King Bates never give his daughter a cent, an' he
never gives none of his girls a cent. It's up to the men they marry to take keer of them. 
The old skin-flint!  What you want to do is to go long to your schoolin', if you reely are
going to make somepin of yourself at last, an' let that big strap of a girl be, do--"

"Now, stop!" shouted George Holt.  "Scenting another scandal, are you? Don't you dare mar Kate
Bates' standing, or her reputation in this town, or we'll have a time like we never had before.
If old Bates doesn't give his girls anything when they marry, they'll get more when he dies.
And so far as money is concerned, this has gone PAST money with me.  I'm going to marry Kate
Bates, as soon as ever I can, and I've got to the place where I'd marry her if she hadn't a
cent.  If I can't take care of her, she can take care of me.  I am crazy about her, an' I'm
going to have her; so you keep still, an' do all you can to help me, or you'll regret it."

"It's you that will regret it!" she said.

"Stop your nagging, I tell you, or I'll come at you in a way you won't like," he cried.

"You do that every day you're here," said Mrs. Holt, starting to the kitchen to begin dinner.

Kate appeared in half an hour, fresh and rosy, also prepared; for one of her little pupils
had said:  "Tilly Nepple's sister say you wasn't at your sister's wedding at all.  Did you
cry 'cause you couldn't go?"

Instantly Kate comprehended what must be town gossip, so she gave the child a happy solution
of the question bothering her, and went to her boarding house forewarned.  She greeted both
Mrs. Holt and her son cordially, then sat down to dinner, in the best of spirits.  The instant
her chance came, Mrs. Holt said:  "Now tell us all about the lovely wedding."

"But I wasn't managing the wedding," said Kate cheerfully.  "I was on the infare job.  Mother
and Nancy Ellen put the wedding through.  You know our house isn't very large, and close relatives
fill it to bursting.  I've seen the same kind of wedding about every eighteen months all my
life.  I had a NEW job this time, and one I liked better."

She turned to George:  "Of course your mother told you that Dr. Gray came after me.  He came
to ask me as an especial favour to go to his new house in Hartley, and do what I could to arrange
it, and to have a supper ready.  I was glad.  I'd seen six weddings that I can remember, all
exactly alike--there's nothing to them; but brushing those new carpets, unwrapping nice furniture
and placing it, washing pretty new dishes, untying the loveliest gifts and arranging them--THAT
was something new in a Bates wedding. Oh, but I had a splendid time!"

George Holt looked at his mother in too great disgust to conceal his feelings.

"ANOTHER gilt-edged scandal gone sky high," he said.  Then he turned to Kate.  "One of the
women who worked in your mother's kitchen is visiting here, and she started a great hullabaloo
because you were not at the wedding.  You probably haven't got a leg left to stand on.  I suspect
the old cats of Walden have chewed them both off, and all the while you were happy, and doing
the thing any girl would much rather have done.  Lord, I hate this eternal picking!  How did
you come back, Kate?"

"Dr. Gray brought me."

"I should think it would have made talk, your staying there with him," commented Mrs. Holt.

"Fortunately, the people of Hartley seem reasonably busy attending their own affairs," said
Kate.  "Doctor Gray had been boarding at the hotel all fall, so he just went on living there
until after the wedding."

George glared at his mother, but she avoided his eyes, and laughing in a silly, half-confused
manner she said:  "How much money did your father give the bride?"

"I can't tell you, in even dollars and cents," said Kate.  "Nancy Ellen didn't say."

Kate saw the movement of George's foot under the table, and knew that he was trying to make
his mother stop asking questions; so she began talking to him about his work.  As soon as the
meal was finished he walked with her to school, visiting until the session began.  He remained
three days, and before he left he told Kate he loved her, and asked her to be his wife.  She
looked at him in surprise and said: "Why, I never thought of such a thing!  How long have you
been thinking about it?"

"Since the first instant I saw you!" he declared with fervour.

"Hum!  Matter of months," said Kate.  "Well, when I have had that much time, I will tell you
what I think about it."

CHAPTER VIII

THE HISTORY OF A LEGHORN HAT

Kate finished her school in the spring, then went for a visit with Nancy Ellen and Robert,
before George Holt returned.  She was thankful to leave Walden without having seen him, for
she had decided, without giving the matter much thought, that he was not the man she wanted
to marry.  In her heart she regretted having previously contracted for the Walden school another
winter because she felt certain that with the influence of Dr. Gray, she could now secure a
position in Hartley that would enable her either to live with, or to be near, her sister. 
With this thought in mind, she tried to make the acquaintance of teachers in the school who
lived in Hartley and she soon became rather intimate with one of them.

It was while visiting with this teacher that Kate spoke of attending Normal again in an effort
to prepare herself still better for the work of the coming year.  Her new friend advised against
it.  She said the course would be only the same thing over again, with so little change or
advancement, that the trip was not worth the time and money it would cost.  She proposed that
Kate go to Lake Chautauqua and take the teachers' course, where all spare time could be put
in attending lectures, and concerts, and studying the recently devised methods of education.
Kate went from her to Nancy Ellen and Robert, determined at heart to go.

She was pleased when they strongly advised her to, and offered to help her get ready.  Aside
from having paid Agatha, and for her board, Kate had spent almost nothing on herself.  She
figured the probable expenses of the trip for a month, what it would cost her to live until
school began again, if she were forced to go to Walden, and then spent all her remaining funds
on the prettiest clothing she had ever owned.  Each of the sisters knew how to buy carefully;
then the added advantage of being able to cut and make their own clothes, made money go twice
as far as where a dressmaker had to be employed.  When everything they had planned was purchased,
neatly made, and packed in a trunk, into which Nancy Ellen slipped some of her prettiest belongings,
Kate made a trip to a milliner's shop to purchase her first real hat.

She had decided on a big, wide-brimmed Leghorn, far from cheap. While she was trying the effect
of flowers and ribbon on it, the wily milliner slipped up and with the hat on Kate's golden
crown, looped in front a bow of wide black velvet ribbon and drooped over the brim a long,
exquisitely curling ostrich plume.  Kate had one good view of herself, before she turned her
back on the temptation.

"You look lovely in that," said the milliner.  "Don't you like it?"

"I certainly do," said Kate.  "I look the best in that hat, with the black velvet and the plume,
I ever did, but there's no use to look twice, I can't afford it."

"Oh, but it is very reasonable!  We haven't a finer hat in the store, nor a better plume,"
said the milliner.

She slowly waved it in all its glory before Kate's beauty-hungry eyes. Kate turned so she could
not see it.

"Please excuse one question.  Are you teaching in Walden this winter?" asked the milliner.

"Yes," said Kate.  "I have signed the contract for that school."

"Then charge the hat and pay for it in September.  I'd rather wait for my money than see you
fail to spend the summer under that plume.  It really is lovely against your gold hair."

"'Get thee behind me, Satan,'" quoted Kate.  "No.  I never had anything charged, and never
expect to.  Please have the black velvet put on and let me try it with the bows set and sewed."

"All right," said the milliner, "but I'm sorry."

She was so sorry that she carried the plume to the work room, and when she walked up behind
Kate, who sat waiting before the mirror, and carefully set the hat on her head, at exactly
the right angle, the long plume crept down one side and drooped across the girl's shoulder.

"I will reduce it a dollar more," she said, "and send the bill to you at Walden the last week
of September."

Kate moved her head from side to side, lifted and dropped her chin. Then she turned to the
milliner.

"You should be killed!" she said.

The woman reached for a hat box.

"No, I shouldn't!" she said.  "Waiting that long, I'll not make much on the hat, but I'll make
a good friend who will come again, and bring her friends.  What is your name, please?"

Kate took one look at herself--smooth pink cheeks, gray eyes, gold hair, the sweeping wide
brim, the trailing plume.

"Miss Katherine Eleanor Bates," she said.  "Bates Corners, Hartley, Indiana.  Please call my
carriage?"

The milliner laughed heartily.  "That's the spirit of '76," she commended.  "I'd be willing
to wager something worth while that this very hat brings you the carriage before fall, if you
show yourself in it in the right place.  It's a perfectly stunning hat. Shall I send it, or
will you wear it?"

Kate looked in the mirror again.  "You may put a fresh blue band on the sailor I was wearing,
and send that to Dr. Gray's when it is finished," she said.  "And put in a fancy bow, for my
throat, of the same velvet as the hat, please.  I'll surely pay you the last week of September.
And if you can think up an equally becoming hat for winter----"

"You just bet I can, young lady," said the milliner to herself as Kate walked down the street.

From afar, Kate saw Nancy Ellen on the veranda, so she walked slowly to let the effect sink
in, but it seemed to make no impression until she looked up at Nancy Ellen's very feet and
said:  "Well, how do you like it?"

"Good gracious!" cried Nancy Ellen.  "I thought I was having a stylish caller.  I didn't know
you!  Why, I never saw YOU walk that way before."

"You wouldn't expect me to plod along as if I were plowing, with a thing like this on my head,
would you?"

"I wouldn't expect you to have a thing like that on your head; but since you have, I don't
mind telling you that you are stunning in it," said Nancy Ellen.

"Better and better!" laughed Kate, sitting down on the step.  "The milliner said it was a stunning
HAT."

"The goose!" said Nancy Ellen.  "You become that hat, Kate, quite as much as the hat becomes you."

The following day, dressed in a linen suit of natural colour, with the black bow at her throat,
the new hat in a bandbox, and the renewed sailor on her head, Kate waved her farewells to Nancy
Ellen and Robert on the platform, then walked straight to the dressing room of the car, and
changed the hats.  Nancy Ellen had told her this was NOT the thing to do.  She should travel
in a plain untrimmed hat, and when the dust and heat of her journey were past, she should bathe,
put on fresh clothing, and wear such a fancy hat only with her best frocks, in the afternoon.
Kate need not have been told that.  Right instincts and Bates economy would have taught her
the same thing, but she had a perverse streak in her nature.  She had SEEN herself in the hat.

The milliner, who knew enough of the world and human nature to know how to sell Kate the hat,
when she never intended to buy it, and knew she should not in the way she did, had said that
before fall it would bring her a carriage, which put into bald terms meant a rich husband.
Now Kate liked her school and she gave it her full attention; she had done, and still intended
to keep on doing, first-class work in the future; but her school, or anything pertaining to
it, was not worth mentioning beside Nancy Ellen's HOME, and the deep understanding and strong
feeling that showed so plainly between her and Robert Gray.  Kate expected to marry by the
time she was twenty or soon after; all Bates girls had, most of them had married very well
indeed.  She frankly envied Nancy Ellen, while it never occurred to her that any one would
criticise her for saying so.  Only one thing could happen to her that would surpass what had
come to her sister.  If only she could have a man like Robert Gray, and have him on a piece
of land of their own. Kate was a girl, but no man of the Bates tribe ever was more deeply bitten
by the lust for land.  She was the true daughter of her father, in more than one way.  If that
very expensive hat was going to produce the man why not let it begin to work from the very
start?  If her man was somewhere, only waiting to see her, and the hat would help him to speedy
recognition, why miss a change?

She thought over the year, and while she deplored the estrangement from home, she knew that
if she had to go back to one year ago, giving up the present and what it had brought and promised
to bring, for a reconciliation with her father, she would not voluntarily return to the old
driving, nagging, overwork, and skimping, missing every real comfort of life to buy land, in
which she never would have any part.

"You get your knocks 'taking the wings of morning,'" thought Kate to herself, "but after all
it is the only thing to do.  Nancy Ellen says Sally Whistler is pleasing Mother very well,
why should I miss my chance and ruin my temper to stay at home and do the work done by a woman
who can do nothing else?"

Kate moved her head slightly to feel if the big, beautiful hat that sat her braids so lightly
was still there.  "Go to work, you beauty," thought Kate.  "Do something better for me than
George Holt.  I'll have him to fall back on if I can't do better; but I think I can.  Yes,
I'm very sure I can!  If you do your part, you lovely plume, I KNOW I can!"

Toward noon the train ran into a violent summer storm.  The sky grew black, the lightning flashed,
the wind raved, the rain fell in gusts. The storm was at its height when Kate quit watching
it and arose, preoccupied with her first trip to a dining car, thinking about how little food
she could order and yet avoid a hunger headache.  The twisting whirlwind struck her face as
she stepped from the day coach to go to the dining car.  She threw back her head and sucked
her lungs full of the pure, rain-chilled air.  She was accustomed to being out in storms, she
liked them. One second she paused to watch the gale sweeping the fields, the next a twitch
at her hair caused her to throw up her hands and clutch wildly at nothing.  She sprang to the
step railing and leaned out in time to see her wonderful hat whirl against the corner of the
car, hold there an instant with the pressure of the wind, then slide down, draw under, and
drop across the rail, where passing wheels ground it to pulp.

Kate stood very still a second, then she reached up and tried to pat the disordered strands
of hair into place.  She turned and went back into the day coach, opened the bandbox, and put
on the sailor.  She resumed her old occupation of thinking things over. All the joy had vanished
from the day and the trip.  Looking forward, it had seemed all right to defy custom and Nancy
Ellen's advice, and do as she pleased. Looking backward, she saw that she had made a fool of
herself in the estimation of everyone in the car by not wearing the sailor, which was suitable
for her journey, and would have made no such mark for a whirling wind.

She found travelling even easier than any one had told her.  Each station was announced.  When
she alighted, there were conveyances to take her and her luggage to a hotel, patronized almost
exclusively by teachers, near the schools and lecture halls. Large front suites and rooms were
out of the question for Kate, but luckily a tiny corner room at the back of the building was
empty and when Kate specified how long she would remain, she secured it at a less figure than
she had expected to pay.  She began by almost starving herself at supper in order to save enough
money to replace her hat with whatever she could find that would serve passably, and be cheap
enough.  That far she proceeded stoically; but when night settled and she stood in her dressing
jacket brushing her hair, something gave way.  Kate dropped on her bed and cried into her pillow,
as she never had cried before about anything. It was not ALL about the hat.  While she was
at it, she shed a few tears about every cruel thing that had happened to her since she could
remember that she had borne tearlessly at the time.  It was a deluge that left her breathless
and exhausted. When she finally sat up, she found the room so close, she gently opened her
door and peeped into the hall.  There was a door opening on an outside veranda, running across
the end of the building and the length of the front.

As she looked from her door and listened intently, she heard the sound of a woman's voice in
choking, stifled sobs, in the room having a door directly across the narrow hall from hers.

"My Lord!  THERE'S TWO OF US!" said Kate.

She leaned closer, listening again, but when she heard a short groan mingled with the sobs,
she immediately tapped on the door. Instantly the sobs ceased and the room became still.  Kate
put her lips to the crack and said in her off-hand way:  "It's only a school-marm, rooming
next you.  If you're ill, could I get anything for you?"

"Will you please come in?" asked a muffled voice.

Kate turned the knob, and stepping inside, closed the door after her. She could dimly see her
way to the dresser, where she found matches and lighted the gas.  On the bed lay in a tumbled
heap a tiny, elderly, Dresden-china doll-woman.  She was fully dressed, even to her wrap, bonnet,
and gloves; one hand clutched her side, the other held a handkerchief to her lips.  Kate stood
an instant under the light, studying the situation.  The dark eyes in the narrow face looked
appealingly at her.  The woman tried to speak, but gasped for breath. Kate saw that she had
heart trouble.

"The remedy!  Where is it?" she cried.

The woman pointed to a purse on the dresser.  Kate opened it, took out a small bottle, and
read the directions.  In a second, she was holding a glass to the woman's lips; soon she was
better.  She looked at Kate eagerly.

"Oh, please don't leave me," she gasped.

"Of course not!" said Kate instantly.  "I'll stay as long as you want me."

She bent over the bed and gently drew the gloves from the frail hands. She untied and slipped
off the bonnet.  She hunted keys in the purse, opened a travelling bag, and found what she
required. Then slowly and carefully, she undressed the woman, helped her into a night robe,
and stooping she lifted her into a chair until she opened the bed.  After giving her time to
rest, Kate pulled down the white wavy hair and brushed it for the night.  As she worked, she
said a word of encouragement now and again; when she had done all she could see to do, she
asked if there was more. The woman suddenly clung to her hand and began to sob wildly. Kate
knelt beside the bed, stroked the white hair, patted the shoulder she could reach, and talked
very much as she would have to a little girl.

"Please don't cry," she begged.  "It must be your heart; you'll surely make it worse."

"I'm trying," said the woman, "but I've been scared sick.  I most certainly would have died
if you hadn't come to me and found the medicine.  Oh, that dreadful Susette!  How could she?"

The clothing Kate had removed from the woman had been of finest cloth and silk.  Her hands
wore wonderful rings.  A heavy purse was in her bag.  Everything she had was the finest that
money could buy, while she seemed as if a rough wind never had touched her.  She appeared so
frail that Kate feared to let her sleep without knowing where to locate her friends.

"She should be punished for leaving you alone among strangers," said Kate indignantly.

"If I only could learn to mind John," sighed the little woman. "He never liked Susette.  But
she was the very best maid I ever had.  She was like a loving daughter, until all at once,
on the train, among strangers, she flared out at me, and simply raved. Oh, it was dreadful!"

"And knowing you were subject to these attacks, she did the thing that would precipitate one,
and then left you alone among strangers.  How wicked!  How cruel!" said Kate in tense indignation.

"John didn't want me to come.  But I used to be a teacher, and I came here when this place
was mostly woods, with my dear husband. Then after he died, through the long years of poverty
and struggle, I would read of the place and the wonderful meetings, but I could never afford
to come.  Then when John began to work and made good so fast I was dizzy half the time with
his successes, I didn't think about the place.  But lately, since I've had everything else
I could think of, something possessed me to come back here, and take a suite among the women
and men who are teaching our young people so wonderfully; and to sail on the lake, and hear
the lectures, and dream my youth over again.  I think that was it most of all, to dream my
youth over again, to try to relive the past."

"There now, you have told me all about it," said Kate, stroking the white forehead in an effort
to produce drowsiness, "close your eyes and go to sleep."

"I haven't even BEGUN to tell you," said the woman perversely. "If I talked all night I couldn't
tell you about John.  How big he is, and how brave he is, and how smart he is, and how he is
the equal of any business man in Chicago, and soon, if he keeps on, he will be worth as much
as some of them--more than any one of his age, who has had a lot of help instead of having
his way to make alone, and a sick old mother to support besides.  No, I couldn't tell you in
a week half about John, and he didn't want me to come. If I would come, then he wanted me to
wait a few days until he finished a deal so he could bring me, but the minute I thought of
it I was determined to come; you know how you get."

"I know how badly you want to do a thing you have set your heart on," admitted Kate.

"I had gone places with Susette in perfect comfort.  I think the trouble was that she tried
from the first to attract John.  About the time we started, he let her see plainly that all
he wanted of her was to take care of me; she was pretty and smart, so it made her furious.
She was pampered in everything, as no maid I ever had before.  John is young yet, and I think
he is very handsome, and he wouldn't pay any attention to her.  You see when other boys were
going to school and getting acquainted with girls by association, even when he was a little
bit of a fellow in knee breeches, I had to let him sell papers, and then he got into a shop,
and he invented a little thing, and then a bigger, and bigger yet, and then he went into stocks
and things, and he doesn't know anything about girls, only about sick old women like me. He
never saw what Susette was up to.  You do believe that I wasn't ugly to her, don't you?"

"You COULDN'T be ugly if you tried," said Kate.

The woman suddenly began to sob again, this time slowly, as if her forces were almost spent.
She looked to Kate for the sympathy she craved and for the first time really saw her closely.

"Why, you dear girl," she cried.  "Your face is all tear stained. You've been crying, yourself."

"Roaring in a pillow," admitted Kate.

"But my dear, forgive me!  I was so upset with that dreadful woman. Forgive me for not having
seen that you, too, are in trouble.  Won't you please tell me?"

"Of course," said Kate.  "I lost my new hat."

"But, my dear!  Crying over a hat?  When it is so easy to get another? How foolish!" said the
woman.

"Yes, but you didn't see the hat," said Kate.  "And it will be far from easy to get another,
with this one not paid for yet.  I'm only one season removed from sunbonnets, so I never should
have bought it at all."

The woman moved in bed, and taking one of Kate's long, crinkly braids, she drew the wealth
of gold through her fingers repeatedly.

"Tell me about your hat," she said.

So to humour this fragile woman, and to keep from thinking of her own trouble, Kate told the
story of her Leghorn hat and ostrich plume, and many things besides, for she was not her usual
terse self with her new friend who had to be soothed to forgetfulness.

Kate ended:  "I was all wrong to buy such a hat in the first place.  I couldn't afford it;
it was foolish vanity.  I'm not really good-looking; I shouldn't have flattered myself that
I was. Losing it before it was paid for was just good for me.  Never again will I be so foolish."

"Why, my dear, don't say such things or think them," chided the little woman.  "You had as
good a right to a becoming hat as any girl.  Now let me ask you one question, and then I'll
try to sleep.  You said you were a teacher.  Did you come here to attend the Summer School
for Teachers?"

"Yes," said Kate.

"Would it make any great difference to you if you missed a few days?" she asked.

"Not the least," said Kate.

"Well, then, you won't be offended, will you, if I ask you to remain with me and take care
of me until John comes?  I could send him a message to-night that I am alone, and bring him
by this time to-morrow; but I know he has business that will cause him to lose money should
he leave, and I was so wilful about coming, I dread to prove him right so conclusively the
very first day.  That door opens into a room reserved for Susette, if only you'd take it, and
leave the door unclosed to-night, and if only you would stay with me until John comes I could
well afford to pay you enough to lengthen your stay as long as you'd like; and it makes me
so happy to be with such a fresh young creature. Will you stay with me, my dear?"

"I certainly will," said Kate heartily.  "If you'll only tell me what I should do; I'm not
accustomed to rich ladies, you know."

"I'm not myself," said the little woman, "but I do seem to take to being waited upon with the
most remarkable facility!"

CHAPTER IX

A SUNBONNET GIRL

WITH the first faint light of morning, Kate slipped to the door to find her charge still sleeping
soundly.  It was eight o'clock when she heard a movement in the adjoining room and went again
to the door.  This time the woman was awake and smilingly waved to Kate as she called:  "Good
morning!  Come right in.  I was wondering if you were regretting your hasty bargain."

"Not a bit of it!" laughed Kate.  "I am here waiting to be told what to do first.  I forgot
to tell you my name last night.  It is Kate Bates. I'm from Bates Corners, Hartley, Indiana."

The woman held out her hand.  "I'm so very glad to meet you, Miss Bates," she said.  "My name
is Mariette Jardine.  My home is in Chicago."

They shook hands, smiling at each other, and then Kate said: "Now, Mrs. Jardine, what shall
I do for you first?"

"I will be dressed, I think, and then you may bring up the manager until I have an understanding
with him, and give him a message I want sent, and an order for our breakfast.  I wonder if
it wouldn't be nice to have it served on the corner of the veranda in front of our rooms, under
the shade of that big tree."

"I think that would be famous," said Kate.

They ate together under the spreading branches of a giant maple tree, where they could see
into the nest of an oriole that brooded in a long purse of gray lint and white cotton cord.
They could almost reach out and touch it.  The breakfast was good, nicely served by a neat
maid, evidently doing something so out of the ordinary that she was rather stunned; but she
was a young person of some self-possession, for when she removed the tray, Mrs. Jardine thanked
her and gave her a coin that brought a smiling: "Thank you very much.  If you want your dinner
served here and will ask for Jennie Weeks, I'd like to wait on you again."

"Thank you," said Mrs. Jardine, "I shall remember that.  I don't like changing waiters each
meal.  It gives them no chance to learn what I want or how I want it."

Then she and Kate slowly walked the length of the veranda several times, while she pointed
out parts of the grounds they could see that remained as she had known them formerly, and what
were improvements.

When Mrs. Jardine was tired, they returned to the room and she lay on the bed while they talked
of many things; talked of things with which Kate was familiar, and some concerning which she
unhesitatingly asked questions until she felt informed.  Mrs. Jardine was so dainty, so delicate,
yet so full of life, so well informed, so keen mentally, that as she talked she kept Kate chuckling
most of the time.  She talked of her home life, her travels, her friends, her son.  She talked
of politics, religion, and education; then she talked of her son again. She talked of social
conditions, Civic Improvement, and Woman's Rights, then she came back to her son, until Kate
saw that he was the real interest in the world to her.  The mental picture she drew of him
was peculiar.  One minute Mrs. Jardine spoke of him as a man among men, pushing, fighting,
forcing matters to work to his will, so Kate imagined him tall, broad, and brawny, indefatigable
in his undertakings; the next, his mother was telling of such thoughtfulness, such kindness,
such loving care that Kate's mental picture shifted to a neat, exacting little man, purely
effeminate as men ever can be; but whatever she thought, some right instinct prevented her
from making a comment or asking a question.

Once she sat looking far across the beautiful lake with such an expression on her face that
Mrs. Jardine said to her:  "What are you thinking of, my dear?"

Kate said smilingly:  "Oh, I was thinking of what a wonderful school I shall teach this winter."

"Tell me what you mean," said Mrs. Jardine.

"Why, with even a month of this, I shall have riches stored for every day of the year," said
Kate.  "None of my pupils ever saw a lake, that I know of.  I shall tell them of this with
its shining water, its rocky, shady, sandy shore lines; of the rowboats and steam-boats, and
the people from all over the country.  Before I go back, I can tell them of wonderful lectures,
concerts, educational demonstrations here. I shall get much from the experiences of other teachers.
I shall delight my pupils with just you."

"In what way?" asked Mrs. Jardine.

"Oh, I shall tell them of a dainty little woman who know everything. From you I shall teach
my girls to be simple, wholesome, tender, and kind; to take the gifts of God thankfully, reverently,
yet with self-respect.  From you I can tell them what really fine fabrics are, and about laces,
and linens.  When the subjects arise, as they always do in teaching, I shall describe each
ring you wear, each comb and pin, even the handkerchiefs you carry, and the bags you travel
with.  To teach means to educate, and it is a big task; but it is almost painfully interesting.
Each girl of my school shall go into life a gentler, daintier woman, more careful of her person
and speech because of my having met you.  Isn't that a fine thought?"

"Why, you darling!" cried Mrs. Jardine.  "Life is always having lovely things in store for
me.  Yesterday I thought Susette's leaving me as she did was the most cruel thing that ever
happened to me.  To-day I get from it this lovely experience.  If you are straight from sunbonnets,
as you told me last night, where did you get these advanced ideas?"

"If sunbonnets could speak, many of them would tell of surprising heads they have covered,"
laughed Kate.  "Life deals with women much the same as with men.  If we go back to where we
start, history can prove to you that there are ten sunbonnets to one Leghorn hat, in the high
places of the world."

"Not to entertain me, but because I am interested, my dear, will you tell me about your particular
sunbonnet?" asked Mrs. Jardine.

Kate sat staring across the blue lake with wide eyes, a queer smile twisting her lips.  At
last she said slowly:  "Well, then, my sunbonnet is in my trunk.  I'm not so far away from
it but that it still travels with me.  It's blue chambray, made from pieces left from my first
pretty dress.  It is ruffled, and has white stitching.  I made it myself.  The head that it
fits is another matter.  I didn't make that, or its environment, or what was taught it, until
it was of age, and had worked out its legal time of service to pay for having been a head at
all.  But my head is now free, in my own possession, ready to go as fast and far on the path
of life as it develops the brains to carry it. You'd smile if I should tell you what I'd ask
of life, if I could have what I want."

"I scarcely think so.  Please tell me."

"You'll be shocked," warned Kate.

"Just so it isn't enough to set my heart rocking again," said Mrs. Jardine.

"We'll stop before that," laughed Kate.  "Then if you will have it, I want of life by the time
I am twenty a man of my stature, dark eyes and hair, because I am so light.  I want him to
be honest, forceful, hard working, with a few drops of the milk of human kindness in his heart,
and the same ambitions I have."

"And what ARE your ambitions?" asked Mrs. Jardine.

"To own, and to cultivate, and to bring to the highest state of efficiency at least two hundred
acres of land, with convenient and attractive buildings and pedigreed stock, and to mother
at least twelve perfect physical and mental boys and girls."

"Oh, my soul!" cried Mrs. Jardine, falling back in her chair, her mouth agape.  "My dear, you
don't MEAN that?  You only said that to shock me."

"But why should I wish to shock you?  I sincerely mean it," persisted Kate.

"You amazing creature!  I never heard a girl talk like that before," said Mrs. Jardine.

"But you can't look straight ahead of you any direction you turn without seeing a girl working
for dear life to attract the man she wants; if she can't secure him, some other man; and in
lieu of him, any man at all, in preference to none.  Life shows us woman on the age-old quest
every day, everywhere we go; why be so secretive about it?  Why not say honestly what we want,
and take it if we can get it?  At any rate, that is the most important thing inside my sunbonnet.
I knew you'd be shocked."

"But I am not shocked at what you say, I agree with you.  What I am shocked at is your ideals.
I thought you'd want to educate yourself to such superiority over common woman that you could
take the platform, and backed by your splendid physique, work for suffrage or lecture to educate
the masses."

"I think more could be accomplished with selected specimens, by being steadily on the job,
than by giving an hour to masses.  I'm not much interested in masses.  They are too abstract
for me; I prefer one stern reality.  And as for Woman's Rights, if anybody gives this woman
the right to do anything more than she already has the right to do, there'll surely be a scandal."

Mrs. Jardine lay back in her chair laughing.

"You are the most refreshing person I have met in all my travels. Then to put it baldly, you
want of life a man, a farm, and a family."

"You comprehend me beautifully," said Kate.  "All my life I've worked like a towhead to help
earn two hundred acres of land for someone else. I think there's nothing I want so much as
two hundred acres of land for myself.  I'd undertake to do almost anything with it, if I had
it.  I know I could, if I had the shoulder-to-shoulder, real man.  You notice it will take
considerable of a man to touch shoulders with me; I'm a head taller than most of them."

Mrs. Jardine looked at her speculatively.  "Ummm!" she murmured. Kate laughed.

"For eighteen years I have been under marching orders," said Kate. "Over a year ago I was advised
by a minister to 'take the wings of morning' so I took wing.  I started on one grand flight
and fell ker-smash in short order.  Life since has been a series of battering my wings until
I have almost decided to buy some especially heavy boots, and walk the remainder of the way.
As a concrete example, I started out yesterday morning wearing a hat that several very reliable
parties assured me would so assist me to flight that I might at least have a carriage.  Where,
oh, where are my hat and my carriage now?  The carriage, non est!  The hat--I am humbly hoping
some little country girl, who has lived a life as barren as mine, will find the remains and
retrieve the velvet bow for a hair-ribbon.  As for the man that Leghorn hat was supposed to
symbolize, he won't even look my way when I appear in my bobby little sailor.  He's as badly
crushed out of existence as my beautiful hat."

"You never should have been wearing such a hat to travel in, my dear," murmured Mrs. Jardine.

"Certainly not!" said Kate.  "I knew it.  My sister told me that. Common sense told me that!
But what has that got to do with the fact that I WAS wearing the hat?  I guess I have you there!"

"Far from it!" said Mrs. Jardine.  "If you're going to start out in life, calmly ignoring the
advice of those who love you, and the dictates of common sense, the result will be that soon
the wheels of life will be grinding you, instead of a train making bag-rags of your hat."

"Hummm!" said Kate.  "There IS food for reflection there.  But wasn't it plain logic, that
if the hat was to bring the man, it should be worn where at any minute he might see it?"

"But my dear, my dear!  If such a man as a woman like you should have, had seen you wearing
that hat in the morning, on a railway train, he would merely have thought you prideful and
extravagant. You would have been far more attractive to any man I know in your blue sunbonnet."

"I surely have learned that lesson," said Kate.  "Hereafter, sailors or sunbonnets for me in
the morning.  Now what may I do to add to your comfort?"

"Leave me for an hour until I take a nap, and then we'll have lunch and go to a lecture.  I
can go to-day, perfectly well, after an hour's rest."

So Kate went for a very interesting walk around the grounds.  When she returned Mrs. Jardine
was still sleeping so she wrote Nancy Ellen, telling all about her adventure, but not a word
about losing her hat. Then she had a talk with Jennie Weeks whom she found lingering in the
hall near her door.  When at last that nap was over, a new woman seemed to have developed.
Mrs. Jardine was so refreshed and interested the remainder of the day that it was easier than
before for Kate to see how shocked and ill she had been.  As she helped dress her for lunch,
Kate said to Mrs. Jardine:  "I met the manager as I was going to post a letter to my sister,
so I asked him always to send you the same waiter. He said he would, and I'd like you to pay
particular attention to her appearance, and the way she does her work."

"Why?" asked Mrs. Jardine.

"I met her in the hall as I came back from posting my letter, so we 'visited' a little, as
the country folks say.  She has taught one winter of country school, a small school in an out
county. She's here waiting table two hours three times a day, to pay for her room and board.
In the meantime, she attends all the sessions and studies as much as she can; but she's very
poor material for a teacher.  I pity her pupils.  She's a little thing, bright enough in her
way, but she has not much initiative, not strong enough for the work, and she has not enough
spunk.  She'll never lead the minds of school children anywhere that will greatly benefit them."

"And your deduction is--"

"That she would make you a kind, careful, obedient maid, who is capable enough to be taught
to wash your hair and manicure you with deftness, and who would serve you for respect as well
as hire.  I think it would be a fine arrangement for you and good for her."

"This surely is kind of you," said Mrs. Jardine.  "I'll keep strict watch of Jennie Weeks.
If I could find a really capable maid here and not have to wire John to bring one, I'd be so
glad. It does so go against the grain to prove to a man that he has a right to be more conceited
than he is naturally."

As they ate lunch Kate said to Mrs. Jardine:  "I noticed one thing this morning that is going
to be balm to my soul.  I passed many teachers and summer resorters going to the lecture halls
and coming from them, and half of them were bareheaded, so my state will not be remarkable,
until I can get another hat."

"'God moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform,'" laughingly quoted Mrs. Jardine.
"You thought losing that precious hat was a calamity; but if you hadn't lost it, you probably
would have slept soundly while I died across the hall.  My life is worth the price of a whole
millinery shop to me; I think you value the friendship we are developing; I foresee I shall
get a maid who will not disgrace my in public; you will have a full summer here; now truly,
isn't all this worth many hats?"

"Of course!  It's like a fairy tale," said Kate.  "Still, you didn't see the hat!"

"But you described it in a truly graphic manner," said Mrs. Jardine.

"When I am the snowiest of great-grandmothers, I shall still be telling small people about
the outcome of my first attempt at vanity," laughed Kate.

The third morning dawned in great beauty, a "misty, moisty morning," Mrs. Jardine called it.
The sun tried to shine but could not quite pierce the intervening clouds, so on every side
could be seen exquisite pictures painted in delicate pastel colours.  Kate, fresh and rosy,
wearing a blue chambray dress, was a picture well worth seeing.  Mrs. Jardine kept watching
her so closely that Kate asked at last:  "Have you made up your mind, yet?"

"No, and I am afraid I never shall," answered Mrs. Jardine.  "You are rather an astonishing
creature.  You're so big, so vital; you absorb knowledge like a sponge takes water--"

"And for the same purpose," laughed Kate.  "That it may be used for the benefit of others.
Tell me some more about me.  I find me such an interesting subject."

"No doubt!" admitted Mrs. Jardine.  "Not a doubt about that!  We are all more interested in
ourselves than in any one else in this world, until love comes; then we soon learn to a love
man more than life, and when a child comes we learn another love, so clear, so high, so purifying,
that we become of no moment at all, and live only for those we love."

"You speak for yourself, and a class of women like you," answered Kate gravely.  "I'm very
well acquainted with many women who have married and borne children, and who are possibly more
selfish than before.  The Great Experience never touched them at all."

There was a tap at the door.  Kate opened it and delivered to Mrs. Jardine a box so big that
it almost blocked the doorway.

Mrs. Jardine lifted from the box a big Leghorn hat of weave so white and fine it almost seemed
like woven cloth instead of braid. There was a bow in front, but the bow was nested in and
tied through a web of flowered gold lace.  One velvet end was slightly long and concealed a
wire which lifted one side of the brim a trifle, beneath which was fastened a smashing big,
pale-pink velvet rose.  There was an ostrich plume even longer than the other, broader, blacker,
as wonderful a feather as ever dropped from the plumage of a lordly bird.  Mrs. Jardine shook
the hat in such a way as to set the feather lifting and waving after the confinement of the
box.  With slender, sure fingers she set the bow and lace as they should be, and touched the
petals of the rose.  She inspected the hat closely, shook it again, and held it toward Kate.

"A very small price to pay for the breath of life, which I was rapidly losing," she said. 
"Do me the favour to accept it as casually as I offer it.  Did I understand your description
anywhere near right?  Is this your hat?"

"Thank you," said Kate.  "It is just 'the speaking image' of my hat, but it's a glorified,
sublimated, celestial image.  What I described was merely a hat.  This is what I think I have
lately heard Nancy Ellen mention as a 'creation.'  Wheuuuuuu!"

She went to the mirror, arranged her hair, set the hat on her head, and turned.

"Gracious Heaven!" said Mrs. Jardine.  "My dear, I understand NOW why you wore that hat on
your journey."

"I wore that hat," said Kate, "as an ascension stalk wears its crown of white lilies, as a
bobolink wears its snowy courting crest, as a bride wears her veil; but please take this from
me to-night, lest I sleep in it!"

That night Mrs. Jardine felt tired enough to propose resting in her room, with Jennie Weeks
where she could be called; so for the first time Kate left her, and, donning her best white
dress and the hat, attended a concert.  At its close she walked back to the hotel with some
of the other teachers stopping there, talked a few minutes in the hall, went to the office
desk for mail, and slowly ascended the stairs, thinking intently.  What she thought was: "If
I am not mistaken, my hat did a small bit of execution to-night."  She stepped to her room
to lock the door and stopped a few minutes to arrange the clothing she had discarded when she
dressed hurriedly before going to the concert, then, the letters in her hand, she opened Mrs.
Jardine's door.

A few minutes before, there had been a tap on that same door.

"Come in," said Mrs. Jardine, expecting Kate or Jennie Weeks.  She slowly lifted her eyes and
faced a tall, slender man standing there.

"John Jardine, what in the world are you doing here?" she demanded after the manner of mothers,
"and what in this world has happened to you?"

"Does it show on me like that?" he stammered.

"Was your train in a wreck?  Are you in trouble?" she asked. "Something shows plainly enough,
but I don't understand what it is."

"Are you all right, Mother?"  He advanced a step, looking intently at her.

"Of course I'm all right!  You can see that for yourself.  The question is, what's the matter
with you?"

"If you will have it, there is something the matter.  Since I saw you last I have seen a woman
I want to marry, that's all; unless I add that I want her so badly that I haven't much sense
left.  Now you have it!"

"No, I don't have it, and I won't have it!  What designing creature has been trying to intrigue
you now?" she demanded.

"Not any one.  She didn't see me, even.  I saw her.  I've been following her for nearly two
hours instead of coming straight to you, as I always have.  So you see where I am.  I expect
you won't forgive me, but since I'm here, you must know that I could only come on the evening
train." 

It is certain that the work was very costly and presented formidable
difficulties, especially the vaulting of the tribune, which is pear-shaped
and covered outside with lead.

The exterior is full of columns, carving, scenes, and the middle
part of the frieze of the doorway contains figures of Christ and the
twelve apostles in half-relief and in the Byzantine style.

About the same time, namely in 1061, the Lucchese, in emulation of the Pisans, began the church
of S. Martino at Lucea, from the designs of some pupils of Buschetto, there being no other
artists then in Tuscany.

The façade has a marble portico in front of it containing many ornaments and carvings in honour
of Pope Alexander II., who had been bishop of the city just before
he was raised to the pontificate.

Nine lines in Latin relate the whole history of the façade and of the Pope, repeated in some
antique letters carved in marble inside the doors of the portico. The façade also contains some
figures and a number of scenes in half-relief below the portico relating
to the life of St Martin executed in marble and in the Byzantine style.

But the best things there, over one of these doors, were done by Niccola Pisano, 170 years later,
and completed in 1233, as will be related in the proper place, Abellenato
and Aliprando being the craftsmen at the beginning, as some letters
carved in marble in the same place fully relate.

The figures by Niccola Pisano show to what an extent the art was
improved by him.



Kate crossed the room, and looking straight into each other's eyes they shook hands and found
chairs.

"How was your concert, my dear?" asked Mrs. Jardine.

"I don't think it was very good," said Kate.  "Not at all up to my expectations.  How did you
like it, Mr. Jardine?"

"Was that a concert?" he asked.

"It was supposed to be," said Kate.

"Thank you for the information," he said.  "I didn't see it, I didn't hear it, I don't know
where I was."

"This is most astonishing," said Kate.

Mrs. Jardine looked at her son, her eyes two big imperative question marks.  He nodded slightly.

"My soul!" she cried, then lay back in her chair half-laughing, half-crying, until Kate feared
she might have another attack of heart trouble.

CHAPTER X

JOHN JARDINE'S COURTSHIP

THE following morning they breakfasted together under the branches of the big maple tree in
a beautiful world.  Mrs. Jardine was so happy she could only taste a bite now and then, when
urged to. Kate was trying to keep her head level, and be natural.  John Jardine wanted to think
of everything, and succeeded fairly well. It seemed to Kate that he could invent more ways
to spend money, and spend it with freer hand, than any man she ever had heard of, but she had
to confess that the men she had heard about were concerned with keeping their money, not scattering
it.

"Did you hear unusual sounds when John came to bid me good-night?" asked Mrs. Jardine of Kate.

"Yes," laughed Kate, "I did.  And I'm sure I made a fairly accurate guess as to the cause."

"What did you think?" asked Mrs. Jardine.

"I thought Mr. Jardine had missed Susette, and you'd had to tell him," said Kate.

"You're quite right.  It's a good thing she went on and lost herself in New York.  I'm not
at all sure that he doesn't contemplate starting out to find her yet."

"Let Susette go!" said Kate.  "We're interested in forgetting her. There's a little country
school-teacher here, who wants to take her place, and it will be the very thing for your mother
and for her, too. She's the one serving us; notice her in particular."

"If she's a teacher, how does she come to be serving us?" he asked.

"I'm a teacher; how do I come to be dining with you?" said Kate. "This is such a queer world,
when you go adventuring in it. Jennie had a small school in an out county, a widowed mother
and a big family to help support; so she figured that the only way she could come here to try
to prepare herself for a better school was to work for her room and board.  She serves the
table two hours, three times a day, and studies between times.  She tells me that almost every
waiter in the dining hall is a teacher.  Please watch her movements and manner and see if you
think her suitable. Goodness knows she isn't intended for a teacher."

"I like her very much," said John Jardine.  "I'll engage her as soon as we finish."

Kate smiled, but when she saw the ease and dexterity with which he ended Jennie Weeks' work
as a waiter and installed her as his mother's maid, making the least detail all right with
his mother, with Jennie, with the manager, she realized that there had been nothing for her
to smile about.  Jennie was delighted, and began her new undertaking earnestly, with sincere
desire to please. Kate helped her all she could, while Mrs. Jardine developed a fund of patience
commensurate with the need of it.  She would have endured more inconvenience than resulted
from Jennie's inexperienced hands because of the realization that her son and the girl she
had so quickly learned to admire were on the lake, rambling the woods, or hearing lectures
together.

When she asked him how long he could remain, he said as long as she did.  When she explained
that she was enjoying herself thoroughly and had no idea how long she would want to stay, he
said that was all right; he had only had one vacation in his life; it was time he was having
another.  When she marvelled at this he said:  "Now, look here, Mother, let's get this business
straight, right at the start.  I told you when I came I'd seen the woman I wanted.  If you
want me to go back to business, the way to do it is to help me win her."

"But I don't want you 'to go back to business'; I want you to have a long vacation, and learn
all you can from the educational advantages here."

"It's too late for me to learn more than I get every day by knocking around and meeting people.
I've tried books two or three times, and I've given them up; I can't do it.  I've waited too
long, I've no way to get down to it, I can't remember to save my soul."

"But you can remember anything on earth about a business deal," she urged.

"Of course I can.  I was born with a business head.  It was remember, or starve, and see you
starve.  If I'd had the books at the time they would have helped; now it's too late, and I'll
never try it again, that's settled.  Much as I want to marry Miss Bates, she'll have to take
me or leave me as I am.  I can't make myself over for her or for you.  I would if I could,
but that's one of the things I can't do, and I admit it.  If I'm not good enough for her as
I am, she'll have the chance to tell me so the very first minute I think it's proper to ask her."

"John, you are good enough for the best woman on earth.  There never was a better lad, it isn't
that, and you know it.  I am so anxious that I can scarcely wait; but you must wait.  You must
give her time and go slowly, and you must be careful, oh, so very careful!  She's a teacher
and a student; she came here to study."

"I'll fix that.  I can rush things so that there'll be no time to study."

"You'll make a mistake if you try it.  You'd far better let her go her own way and only appear
when she has time for you," she advised.

"That's a fine idea!" he cried.  "A lot of ice I'd cut, sitting back waiting for a signal to
run after a girl, like a poodle.  The way to do is the same as with any business deal.  See
what you want, overcome anything in your way, and get it.  I'd go crazy hanging around like
that.  You've always told me I couldn't do the things in business I said I would; and I've
always proved to you that I could, by doing them.  Now watch me do this."

"You know I'll do anything to help you, John.  You know how proud I am of you, how I love you!
I realize now that I've talked volumes to Kate about you.  I've told her everything from the
time you were a little boy and I slaved for you, until now, when you slave for me."

"Including how many terms I'd gone to school?"

"Yes, I even told her that," she said.

"Well, what did she seem to think about it?" he asked.

"I don't know what she thought, she didn't say anything.  There was nothing to say.  It was
a bare-handed fight with the wolf in those days.  I'm sure I made her understand that," she said.

"Well, I'll undertake to make her understand this," he said.  "Are you sure that Jennie Weeks
is taking good care of you?"

"Jennie is well enough and is growing better each day, now be off to your courting, but if
you love me, remember, and be careful," she said.

"Remember--one particular thing--you mean?" he asked.

She nodded, her lips closed.

"You bet I will!" he said.  "All there is of me goes into this. Isn't she a wonder, Mother?"

Mrs. Jardine looked closely at the big man who was all the world to her, so like her in mentality,
so like his father with his dark hair and eyes and big, well-rounded frame; looked at him with
the eyes of love, then as he left her to seek the girl she had learned to love, she shut her
eyes and frankly and earnestly asked the Lord to help her son to marry Kate Bates.

One morning as Kate helped Mrs. Jardine into her coat and gloves, preparing for one of their
delightful morning drives, she said to her: "Mrs. Jardine, may I ask you a REAL question?"

"Of course you may," said Mrs. Jardine, "and I shall give you a 'real' answer if it lies in
my power."

"You'll be shocked," warned Kate.

"Shock away," laughed Mrs. Jardine.  "By now I flatter myself that I am so accustomed to you
that you will have to try yourself to shock me."

"It's only this," said Kate:  "If you were a perfect stranger, standing back and looking on,
not acquainted with any of the parties, merely seeing things as they happen each day, would
it be your honest opinion--would you say that I am being COURTED?"

Mrs. Jardine laughed until she was weak.  When she could talk, she said:  "Yes, my dear, under
the conditions, and in the circumstances you mention, I would cheerfully go on oath and testify
that you are being courted more openly, more vigorously, and as tenderly as I ever have seen
woman courted in all my life. I always thought that John's father was a master hand at courting,
but John has him beaten in many ways.  Yes, my dear, you certainly are being courted assiduously."

"Now, then, on that basis," said Kate, "just one more question and we'll proceed with our drive.
From the same standpoint:  would you say from your observation and experience that the mother
of the man had any insurmountable objection to the proceedings?"

Mrs. Jardine laughed again.  Finally she said:  "No, my dear. It's my firm conviction that
the mother of the man in the case would be so delighted if you should love and marry her son
that she would probably have a final attack of heart trouble and pass away from sheer joy."

"Thank you," said Kate.  "I wasn't perfectly sure, having had no experience whatever, and I
didn't want to make a mistake."

That drive was wonderful, over beautiful country roads, through dells, and across streams and
hills.  They stopped where they pleased, gathering flowers and early apples, visiting with
people they met, lunching wherever they happened to be.

"If it weren't for wishing to hear John A. Logan to-night," said Kate, "I'd move that we drive
on all day.  I certainly am having the grandest time."

She sat with her sailor hat filled with Early Harvest apples, a big bunch of Canadian anemones
in her belt, a little stream at her feet, July drowsy fullness all around her, congenial companions;
taking the "wings of morning" paid, after all.

"Why do you want to hear him so much?" asked John.

Kate looked up at him in wonder.

"Don't you want to see and hear him?" she asked.

He hesitated, a thoughtful expression on his face.  Finally he said: "I can't say that I do.
Will you tell me why I should?"

"You should because he was one of the men who did much to preserve our Union, he may tell us
interesting things about the war.  Where were you when it was the proper time for you to be
studying the speech of Logan's ancestor in McGuffey's Fourth?"

"That must have been the year I figured out the improved coupling pin in the C. N. W. shops,
wouldn't you think, Mother?"

"Somewhere near, my dear," she said.

So they drove back as happily as they had set out, made themselves fresh, and while awaiting
the lecture hour, Kate again wrote to Robert and Nancy Ellen, telling plainly and simply all
that had occurred.  She even wrote "John Jardine's mother is of the opinion that he is courting
me.  I am so lacking in experience myself that I scarcely dare venture an opinion, but it has
at times appealed to me that if he isn't really, he certainly must be going through the motions."

Nancy Ellen wrote:  I have read over what you say about John Jardine several times.  Then I
had Robert write Bradstreet's and look him up. He is rated so high that if he hasn't a million
right now, he soon will have.  You be careful, and do your level best.  Are your clothes good
enough?  Shall I send more of my things?  You know I'll do anything to help you.  Oh, yes,
that George Holt from your boarding place was here the other day hunting you.  He seemed determined
to know where you were and when you would be back, and asked for your address.  I didn't think
you had any time for him and I couldn't endure him or his foolish talk about a new medical
theory; so I said you'd no time for writing and were going about so much I had no idea if you'd
get a letter if he sent one, and I didn't give him what he wanted.  He'll probably try general
delivery, but you can drop it in the lake.  I want you to be sure to change your boarding place
this winter, if you teach; but I haven't an idea you will.  Hadn't you better bring matters
to a close if you can, and let the Director know? Love from us both, NANCY ELLEN.

Kate sat very still, holding this letter in her hand, when John Jardine came up and sat beside
her.  She looked at him closely. He was quite as good looking as his mother thought him, in
a brawny masculine way; but Kate was not seeking the last word in mental or physical refinement.
She was rather brawny herself, and perfectly aware of the fact.  She wanted intensely to learn
all she could, she disliked the idea that any woman should have more stored in her head than
she, but she had no time to study minute social graces and customs.  She wanted to be kind,
to be polite, but she told Mrs. Jardine flatly the "she didn't give a flip about being overly
nice," which was the exact truth.  That required subtleties beyond Kate's depth, for she was
at times alarmingly casual. So she held her letter and thought about John Jardine. As she thought,
she decided that she did not know whether she was in love with him or not; she thought she
was.  She liked being with him, she liked all he did for her, she would miss him if he went
away, she would be proud to be his wife, but she did wish that he were interested in land,
instead of inventions and stocks and bonds.  Stocks and bonds were almost as evanescent as
rainbows to Kate.  Land was something she could understand and handle. Maybe she could interest
him in land; if she could, that would be ideal.  What a place his wealth would buy and fit
up.  She wondered as she studied John Jardine, what was in his head; if he truly intended to
ask her to be his wife, and since reading Nancy Ellen's letter, when?  She should let the Trustee
know if she were not going to teach the school again; but someway, she rather wanted to teach
the school.  When she started anything she did not know how to stop until she finished.  She
had so much she wanted to teach her pupils the coming winter.

Suddenly John asked:  "Kate, if you could have anything you wanted, what would you have?"

"Two hundred acres of land," she said.

"How easy!" laughed John, rising to find a seat for his mother who was approaching them.  "What
do you think of that, Mother?  A girl who wants two hundred acres of land more than anything
else in the world."

"What is better?" asked Mrs. Jardine.

"I never heard you say anything about land before."

"Certainly not," said his mother, "and I'm not saying anything about it now, for myself; but
I can see why it means so much to Kate, why it's her natural element."

"Well, I can't," he said.  "I meet many men in business who started on land, and most of them
were mighty glad to get away from it.  What's the attraction?"

Kate waved her hand toward the distance.

"Oh, merely sky, and land, and water, and trees, and birds, and flowers, and fruit, and crops,
and a few other things scarcely worth mentioning," she said, lightly.  "I'm not in the mood
to talk bushels, seed, and fertilization just now; but I understand them, they are in my blood.
I think possibly the reason I want two hundred acres of land for myself is because I've been
hard on the job of getting them for other people ever since I began to work, at about the age
of four."

"But if you want land personally, why didn't you work to get it for yourself?" asked John Jardine.

"Because I happened to be the omega of my father's system," answered Kate.

Mrs. Jardine looked at her interestedly.  She had never mentioned her home or parents before.
The older woman did not intend to ask a word, but if Kate was going to talk, she did not want
to miss one.  Kate evidently was going to talk, for she continued:  "You see my father is land
mad, and son crazy.  He thinks a BOY of all the importance in the world; a GIRL of none whatever.
He has the biggest family of any one we know.  From birth each girl is worked like a man, or
a slave, from four in the morning until nine at night.  Each boy is worked exactly the same
way; the difference lies in the fact that the girls get plain food and plainer clothes out
of it; the boys each get two hundred acres of land, buildings and stock, that the girls have
been worked to the limit to help pay for; they get nothing personally, worth mentioning. I
think I have two hundred acres of land on the brain, and I think this is the explanation of
it.  It's a pre-natal influence at our house; while we nurse, eat, sleep, and above all, WORK
it, afterward."

She paused and looked toward John Jardine calmly:  "I think," she said, "that there's not a
task ever performed on a farm that I haven't had my share in.  I have plowed, hoed, seeded,
driven reapers and bound wheat, pitched hay and hauled manure, chopped wood and sheared sheep,
and boiled sap; if you can mention anything else, go ahead, I bet a dollar I've done it."

"Well, what do you think of that?" he muttered, looking at her wonderingly.

"If you ask me, and want the answer in plain words, I think it's a shame!" said Kate.  "If
it were ONE HUNDRED acres of land, and the girls had as much, and were as willing to work it
as the boys are, well and good.  But to drive us like cattle, and turn all we earn into land
for the boys, is another matter.  I rebelled last summer, borrowed the money and went to Normal
and taught last winter.  I'm going to teach again this winter; but last summer and this are
the first of my life that I haven't been in the harvest fields, at this time.  Women in the
harvest fields of Land King Bates are common as men, and wagons, and horses, but not nearly
so much considered.  The women always walk on Sunday, to save the horses, and often on week days."

"Mother has it hammered into me that it isn't polite to ask questions," said John, "but I'd
like to ask one."

"Go ahead," said Kate.  "Ask fifty!  What do I care?"

"How many boys are there in your family?"

"There are seven," said Kate, "and if you want to use them as a basis for a land estimate add
two hundred and fifty for the home place. Sixteen hundred and fifty is what Father pays tax
on, besides the numerous mortgages and investments.  He's the richest man in the county we
live in; at least he pays the most taxes."

Mother and son looked at each other in silence.  They had been thinking her so poor that she
would be bewildered by what they had to offer. But if two hundred acres of land were her desire,
there was a possibility that she was a women who was not asking either ease or luxury of life,
and would refuse it if it were proffered.

"I hope you will take me home with you, and let me see all that land, and how it is handled,"
said John Jardine.  "I don't own an acre.  I never even have thought of it, but there is no
reason why I, or any member of my family shouldn't have all the land they want.  Mother, do
you feel a wild desire for two hundred acres of land?  Same kind of a desire that took you
to come here?"

"No, I don't," said Mrs. Jardine.  "All I know about land is that I know it when I see it,
and I know if I think it's pretty; but I can see why Kate feels that she would like that amount
for herself, after having helped earn all those farms for her brothers.  If it's land she wants,
I hope she speedily gets all she desires in whatever location she wants it; and then I hope
she lets me come to visit her and watch her do as she likes with it."

"Surely," said Kate, "you are invited right now; as soon as I ever get the land, I'll give
you another invitation.  And of course you may go home with me, Mr. Jardine, and I'll show
you each of what Father calls 'those little parcels of land of mine.'  But the one he lives
on we shall have to gaze at from afar, because I'm a Prodigal Daughter.  When I would leave
home in spite of him for the gay and riotous life of a school-marm, he ordered me to take all
my possessions with me, which I did in one small telescope.  I was not to enter his house again
while he lived.  I was glad to go, he was glad to have me, while I don't think either of us
has changed our mind since.  Teaching school isn't exactly gay, but I'll fill my tummy with
quite a lot of symbolical husks before he'll kill the fatted calf for me.  They'll be glad
to see you at my brother Adam's, and my sister, Nancy Ellen, would greatly enjoy meeting you.
Surely you may go home with me, if you'd like."

"I can think of only one thing I'd like better," he said.  "We've been such good friends here
and had such a good time, it would be the thing I'd like best to take you home with us, and
show you where and how we live.  Mother, did you ever invite Kate to visit us?"

"I have, often, and she has said that she would," replied Mrs. Jardine. "I think it would be
nice for her to go from here with us; and then you can take her home whenever she fails to
find us interesting.  How would that suit you for a plan, my dear?"

"I think that would be a perfect ending to a perfect summer," said Kate.  "I can't see an objection
in any way.  Thank you very much."

"Then we'll call that settled," said John Jardine.

CHAPTER XI

A BUSINESS PROPOSITION

MID-AUGUST saw them on their way to Chicago.  Kate had taken care of Mrs. Jardine a few days
while Jennie Weeks went home to see her mother and arrange for her new work.  She had no intention
of going back to school teaching.  She preferred to brush Mrs. Jardine's hair, button her shoes,
write her letters, and read to her.

In a month, Jennie had grown so deft at her work and made herself so appreciated, that she
was practically indispensable to the elderly woman, and therefore the greatest comfort to John.
Immediately he saw that his mother was properly cared for, sympathetically and even lovingly,
he made it his business to smooth Jennie's path in every way possible.  In turn she studied
him, and in many ways made herself useful to him.  Often she looked at him with large and speculative
eyes as he sat reading letters, or papers, or smoking.

The world was all right with Kate when they crossed the sand dunes as they neared the city.
She was sorry about the situation in her home, but she smiled sardonically as she thought how
soon her father would forget his anger when he heard about the city home and the kind of farm
she could have, merely by consenting to take it.  She was that sure of John Jardine; yet he
had not asked her to marry him.  He had seemed on the verge of it a dozen times, and then had
paused as if better judgment told him it would be wise to wait a little longer.  Now Kate had
concluded that there was a definite thing he might be waiting for, since that talk about land.

She thought possibly she understood what it was.  He was a business man; he knew nothing else;
he said so frankly.  He wanted to show her his home, his business, his city, his friends, and
then he required--he had almost put it into words--that he be shown her home and her people.
Kate not only acquiesced, she approved.  She wanted to know as much of a man she married as
Nancy Ellen had known, and Robert had taken her to his home and told his people she was his
betrothed wife before he married her.

Kate's eyes were wide open and her brain busy, as they entered a finely appointed carriage
and she heard John say:  "Rather sultry. Home down the lake shore, George."  She wished their
driver had not been named "George," but after all it made no difference. There could not be
a commoner name than John, and she knew of but one that she liked better. For the ensuing three
days she lived in a Lake Shore home of wealth. She watched closely not to trip in the heavy
rugs and carpets.  She looked at wonderful paintings and long shelves of books.  She never
had touched such china, or tasted such food or seen so good service.  She understood why John
had opposed his mother's undertaking the trip without him, for everyone in the house seemed
busy serving the little woman.

Jennie Weeks was frankly enchanted.

"My sakes!" she said to Kate.  "If I'm not grateful to you for getting me into a place like
this.  I wouldn't give it up for all the school-teaching in the world.  I'm going to snuggle
right in here, and make myself so useful I won't have to leave until I die. I hope you won't
turn me out when to come to take charge."

"Don't you think you're presuming?" said Kate.

Jennie drew back with a swift apology, but there was a flash in the little eyes and a spiteful
look on the small face as she withdrew.

Then Kate was shown each of John's wonderful inventions.  To her they seemed almost miracles,
because they were so obvious, so simple, yet brought such astounding returns.  She saw offices
and heard the explanation of big business; but did not comprehend, farther than that when an
invention was completed, the piling up of money began.  Before the week's visit was over, Kate
was trying to fit herself and her aims and objects of life into the surroundings, with no success
whatever. She felt housed in, cribbed, confined, frustrated.  When she realized that she was
becoming plainly cross, she began keen self-analysis and soon admitted to herself that she
did not belong there.

Kate watched with keen eyes.  Repeatedly she tried to imagine herself in such surroundings
for life, a life sentence, she expressed it, for soon she understood that it would be to her,
a prison.  The only way she could imagine herself enduring it at all was to think of the promised
farm, and when she began to think of that on Jardine terms, she saw that it would mean to sit
down and tell someone else what she wanted done.  There would be no battle to fight.  Her mind
kept harking back to the day when she had said to John that she hoped there would be a lake
on the land she owned, and he had answered casually:  "If there isn't a lake, make one!"  Kate
thought that over repeatedly.  "Make one!"   Make a lake?  It would have seemed no more magical
to her if he had said, "Make a cloud," "Make a star," or "Make a rainbow."  "What on earth
would I do with myself, with my time, with my life?" pondered Kate.

She said "Good-bye" to Mrs. Jardine and Jennie Weeks, and started home with John, still pondering.
When the train pulled into Hartley, Nancy Ellen and Robert were on the platform to meet them.
From that time, Kate was on solid ground.  She was reckoning in terms she could comprehend.
All her former assurance and energy came back to her.  She almost wished the visit were over,
and that she were on the way to Walton to clean the school-house.  She was eager to roll her
sleeves and beat a tub of soapy clothes to foam, and boil them snowy white. She had a desire
she could scarcely control to sweep, and dust, and cook.  She had been out of the environment
she thought she disliked and found when she returned to it after a wider change than she could
have imagined, that she did not dislike it at all.  It was her element, her work, what she
knew.  She could attempt it with sure foot, capable hand, and certain knowledge.

Sunday morning she said to Nancy Ellen as they washed the breakfast dishes, while the men smoked
on the veranda:  "Nancy Ellen, I don't believe I was ever cut out for a rich woman!  If I have
got a chance, I wish YOU had it, and I had THIS.  This just suits my style to a T."

"Tell me about it," said Nancy Ellen.

Kate told all she could remember.

"You don't mean to say you didn't LIKE it?" cried Nancy Ellen.

"I didn't say anything," said Kate, "but if I were saying exactly what I feel, you'd know I
despise it all."

"Why, Kate Barnes!" cried the horrified Nancy Ellen, "Whatever do you mean?"

"I haven't thought enough to put it to you clearly," said Kate, "but someway the city repels
me.  Facilities for manufacturing something start a city.  It begins with the men who do the
work, and the men who profit from that work, living in the same coop. It expands, and goes
on, and grows, on that basis.  It's the laborer, living on his hire, and the manufacturer living
on the laborer's productions, coming in daily contact.  The contrast is too great, the space
is too small. Somebody is going to get the life crowded out of him at every turn, and it isn't
always the work hand in the factory.  The money kings eat each other for breakfast every day.
As for work, we always thought we worked. You should take a peep into the shops and factories
I've seen this week.  Work?  Why, we don't know what work is, and we waste enough food every
day to keep a workman's family, and we're dressed liked queens, in comparison with them right now."

"Do you mean to say if he asks you--?"  It was a small explosion.

"I mean to say if he asks me, 'buy me that two hundred acres of land where I want it, build
me the house and barns I want, and guarantee that I may live there as I please, and I'll marry
you to-morrow.'  If it's Chicago--Never!  I haven't stolen, murdered, or betrayed, who should
I be imprisoned?"

"Why, you hopeless anarchist!" said Nancy Ellen, "I am going to tell John Jardine on you."

"Do!" urged Kate.  "Sound him on the land question.  It's our only hope of a common foundation.
Have you send Agatha word that we will be out this afternoon?"

"I have," said Nancy Ellen.  "And I don't doubt that now, even now, she is in the kitchen--how
would she put it?"

"'Compounding a cake,'" said Kate, "while Adam is in the cellar 'freezing a custard.'  Adam,
3d, will be raking the yard afresh and Susan will be sweeping the walks steadily from now until
they sight us coming down the road.  What you bet Agatha asked John his intentions? I almost
wish she would," she added.  "He has some, but there is a string to them in some way, and I
can't just make out where, or why it is."

"Not even a guess?" asked Nancy Ellen.

"Not even a guess, with any sense to it.  I've thought it was coming repeatedly; but I've got
a stubborn Bates streak, and I won't lift a finger to help him.  He'll speak up, loud and plain,
or there will be no 'connubial bliss' for us, as Agatha says.  I think he has ideas about other
things than freight train gear. According to his programme we must have so much time to become
acquainted, I must see his home and people, he must see mine.  If there's more after that,
I'm not informed.  Like as not there is. It may come after we get back to-night, I can't say."

"Have you told him--?" asked Nancy Ellen.

"Not the details, but the essentials.  He knows that I can't go home. It came up one day in
talking about land.  I guess they had thought before, that my people were poor as church mice.
I happened to mention how much land I had helped earn for my brothers, and they seemed so interested
I finished the job. Ted twists a little.

"It all seems so blamed impossible," he says cryptically.

"Oh, I wouldn't call Elinor Piper that exactly." Oliver grins. "Even if she is Peter's sister.
Old Peter. She's a nice girl."

"A nice girl?" Ted begins rather violently. "She's--why she's--" then pauses, seeing the trap.

"Oh
very well--that's all I wanted to know."

"Oh don't look so much
like a little tin Talleyrand, Ollie! I'm not sure--and that's rather
more than I'd even hint to anybody else."

"Thanks, little darling."
But Ted has been stung too suddenly, even by Oliver's light touch
on something which he thought was a complete and mortuary secret,
to be in a mood for sarcasm.

"Oh, well, you might as well know. I
suppose you do."  Aren't they funny?  What would I care--?"

"Well, I'D care a lot!" said Nancy Ellen.

Kate surveyed her slowly.  "Yes, I guess you would."

They finished the dishes and went to church, because Robert was accustomed to going.  They
made a remarkable group.  Then they went to the hotel for dinner, so that the girls would not
have to prepare it, and then in a double carriage Robert had secured for the occasion, they
drove to Bates Corners and as Kate said, "Viewed the landscape o'er." Those eight pieces of
land, none under two hundred acres, some slightly over, all in the very highest state of cultivation,
with modern houses, barns, outbuildings, and fine stock grazing in the pastures, made an impressive
picture.  It was probably the first time that any of the Bates girls had seen it all at once,
and looked on it merely as a spectacle.  They stopped at Adam's last, and while Robert was
busy with the team and John had alighted to help him, Nancy Ellen, revealing tight lips and
unnaturally red cheeks, leaned back to Kate.

"This is about as mean a trick, and as big a shame as I've ever seen," she said, hotly.  "You
know I was brought up with this, and I never looked at it with the eyes of a stranger before.
If ever I get my fingers on those deeds, I'll make short work of them!"

"And a good job, too!" assented Kate, instantly.  "Look out! There comes Adam."

"I'd just as soon tell him so as not!" whispered Nancy Ellen.

"Which would result in the deeds being recorded to-morrow and spoiling our trip to-day, and
what good would it do you?" said Kate.

"None, of course!  Nothing ever does a Bates girl any good, unless she gets out and does it
for herself," retorted Nancy Ellen spitefully.

"There, there," said Robert as he came to help Nancy Ellen protect her skirts in alighting.
"I was afraid this trip would breed discontent."

"What's the trouble?" asked John, as he performed the same service for Kate.

"Oh, the girls are grouching a little because they helped earn all this, and are to be left
out of it," explained Robert in a low voice.

"Let's get each one of them a farm that will lay any of these completely in the shade," suggested
John.

"All right for you, if you can do it," said Robert, laughing, "but I've gone my limit for the
present.  Besides, if you gave each of them two hundred acres of the Kingdom of Heaven, it
wouldn't stop them from feeling that they had been defrauded of their birthright here."

"How would you feel if you was served the same way?" asked John, and even as she shook hands
with Adam, and introduced John Jardine, Kate found herself wishing that he had said "were."

As the girls had predicted, the place was immaculate, the yard shady and cool from the shelter
of many big trees, the house comfortable, convenient, the best of everything in sight.  Agatha
and Susan were in new white dresses, while Adam Jr. and 3d wore tan and white striped seersucker
coats, and white duck trousers. It was not difficult to feel a glow of pride in the place and
people.  Adam made them cordially welcome.

"You undoubtedly are blessed with good fortune," said Agatha. "Won't you please enlighten us
concerning your travels, Katherine?"

So Kate told them everything she could think of that she thought would interest and amuse them,
even outlining for Agatha speeches she had heard made by Dr. Vincent, Chaplain McCabe, Jehu
DeWitt Miller, a number of famous politicians, teachers, and ministers. Then all of them talked
about everything.  Adam took John and Robert to look over the farm, whereupon Kate handed over
her hat for Agatha to finger and try on.

"And how long will it be, my dear," said Agatha to Kate, "before you enter connubial bliss?"

"My goodness!  I'm glad you asked me that while the men are at the barn," said Kate.  "Mr.
Jardine hasn't said a word about it himself, so please be careful what you say before him."

Agatha looked at Kate in wonder.

"You amaze me," she said.  "Why, he regards you as if he would devour you.  He hasn't proposed
for your hand, you say?  Surely you're not giving him proper encouragement!"

"She isn't giving him any, further than allowing him to be around," said Nancy Ellen.

"Do enlighten me!" cried the surprised Agatha.  "How astonishing! Why, Kate, my dear, there
is a just and proper amount of encouragement that MUST be given any self-respecting youth,
before he makes his declarations.  You surely know that."

"No, I do not know it!" said Kate.  "I thought it was a man's place to speak up loud and plain
and say what he had to propose."

"Oh, dear!" wailed Agatha, wringing her thin hands, her face a mirror of distress.  "Oh, dear,
I very much fear you will lose him.  Why, Katherine, after a man has been to see you a certain
number of times, and evidenced enough interest in you, my dear, there are a thousand strictly
womanly ways in which you can lend his enterprise a little, only a faint amount of encouragement,
just enough to allow him to recognize that he is not--not--er--repulsive to you."

"But how many times must he come, and how much interest must he evince?" asked Kate.

"I can scarcely name an exact number," said Agatha.  "That is personal. You must decide for
yourself what is the psychological moment at which he is to be taken.  Have you even signified
to him that you--that you--that you could be induced, even to CONTEMPLATE marriage?"

"Oh, yes," said Kate, heartily.  "I told his mother that it was the height of my ambition to
marry by the time I'm twenty.  I told her I wanted a man as tall as I am, two hundred acres
of land, and at least twelve babies."

Agatha collapsed suddenly.  She turned her shocked face toward Nancy Ellen.

"Great Day of Rest!" she cried.  "No wonder the man doesn't propose!"

When the men returned from their stroll, Agatha and Susan served them with delicious frozen
custard and Angel's food cake.  Then they resumed their drive, passing Hiram's place last.
At the corner Robert hesitated and turned to ask:  "Shall we go ahead, Kate?"

"Certainly," said Kate.  "I want Mr. Jardine to see where I was born and spent my time of legal
servitude.  I suppose we daren't stop.  I doubt if Mother would want to see me, and I haven't
the slightest doubt that Father would NOT; but he has no jurisdiction over the road.  It's
the shortest way--and besides, I want to see the lilac bush and the cabbage roses."

As they approached the place Nancy Ellen turned.

"Father's standing at the gate.  What shall we do?"

"There's nothing you can do, but drive straight ahead and you and Robert speak to him," said
Kate.  "Go fast, Robert."

He touched the team and at fair speed they whirled past the white house, at the gate of which,
stiffly erect, stood a brawny man of six feet six, his face ruddy and healthy in appearance.
He was dressed as he prepared himself to take a trip to pay his taxes, or to go to Court. He
stood squarely erect, with stern, forbidding face, looking directly at them.  Robert spoke
to him, and Nancy Ellen leaned forward and waved, calling "Father," that she might be sure
he knew her, but he gave not the slightest sign of recognition.  They carried away a distinct
picture of him, at his best physically and in appearance; at his worst mentally.

"There you have it!" said Kate, bitterly.  "I'd be safe in wagering a thousand dollars, if
I had it, that Agatha or the children told, at Hiram's or to Mother's girl, that we were coming.
They knew we would pass about this time.  Mother was at the side door watching, and Father
was in his Sunday best, waiting to show us what would happen if we stopped, and that he never
changes his mind.  It didn't happen by accident that he was standing there dressed that way.
What do you think, Nancy Ellen?"

"That he was watching for us!" said Nancy Ellen.

"But why do you suppose that he did it?" asked Kate.

"He thought that if he were NOT standing guard there, we might stop in the road and at least
call Mother out.  He wanted to be seen, and seen at his best; but as always, in command, showing
his authority."

"Don't mind," said John Jardine.  "It's easy to understand the situation."

"Thank you," said Kate.  "I hope you'll tell your mother that.  I can't bear her to think that
the trouble is wholly my fault."

"No danger of that," he said.  "Mother thinks there's nobody in all the world like you, and
so do I."

Nancy Ellen kicked Robert's shin, to let him know that she heard. Kate was very depressed for
a time, but she soon recovered and they spent a final happy evening together.  When John had
parted from Robert and Nancy Ellen, with the arrangement that he was to come again the following
Saturday evening and spend Sunday with them, he asked Kate to walk a short distance with him.
He seemed to be debating some proposition in his mind, that he did not know how to approach.
Finally he stopped abruptly and said:  "Kate, Mother told me that she told you how I grew up.
We have been together most of every day for six weeks. I have no idea how a man used to women
goes at what I want, so I can only do what I think is right, and best, and above all honest,
and fair.  I'd be the happiest I've ever been, to do anything on earth I've got the money to
do, for you.  There's a question I'm going to ask you the next time I come.  You can think
over all you know of me, and of Mother, and of what we have, and are, and be ready to tell
me how you feel about everything next Sunday.  There's one question I want to ask you before
I go.  In case we can plan for a life together next Sunday, what about my mother?"

"Whatever pleases her best, of course," said Kate.  "Any arrangement that you feel will make
her happy, will be all right with me; in the event we agree on other things."

He laughed, shortly.

"This sounds cold-blooded and business-like," he said.  "But Mother's been all the world to
me, until I met you.  I must be sure about her, and one other thing.  I'll write you about
that this week.  If that is all right with you, you can get ready for a deluge.  I've held
in as long as I can.  Kate, will you kiss me good-bye?"

"That's against the rules," said Kate.  "That's getting the cart before the horse."

"I know it," he said.  "But haven't I been an example for six weeks? Only one.  Please?"

They were back at Dr. Gray's gate, standing in the deep shelter of a big maple.  Kate said:
"I'll make a bargain with you.  I'll kiss you to-night, and if we come to an agreement next
Sunday night, you shall kiss me.  Is that all right?"

The reply was so indistinct Kate was not sure of it; but she took his face between her hands
and gave him exactly the same kind of kiss she would have given Adam, 3d.  She hesitated an
instant, then gave him a second.  "You may take that to your mother," she said, and fled up
the walk.

CHAPTER XII

TWO LETTERS

NANCY ELLEN and Robert were sitting on the side porch, not seeming in the least sleepy, when
Kate entered the house.  As she stepped out to them, she found them laughing mysteriously.

"Take this chair, Kate," said Nancy Ellen.  "Come on, Robert, let's go stand under the maple
tree and let her see whether she can see us."

"If you're going to rehearse any momentous moment of your existence," said Kate, "I shouldn't
think of even being on the porch.  I shall keep discreetly in the house, even going at once
to bed.  Good-night! Pleasant dreams!"

"Now we've made her angry," said Robert.

"I think there WAS 'a little touch of asperity,' as Agatha would say, in that," said Nancy
Ellen, "but Kate has a good heart. She'll get over it before morning."

"Would Agatha use such a common word as 'little'?" asked Robert.

"Indeed, no!" said Nancy Ellen.  "She would say 'infinitesimal.' But all the same he kissed her."

"If she didn't step up and kiss him, never again shall I trust my eyes!" said the doctor.

"Hush!" cautioned Nancy Ellen.  "She's provoked now; if she hears that, she'll never forgive us."

Kate did not need even a hint to start her talking in the morning. The day was fine, a snappy
tinge of autumn in the air, her head and heart were full.  Nancy Ellen would understand and
sympathize; of course Kate told her all there was to tell.

"And even at that," said Nancy Ellen, "he hasn't just come out right square and said 'Kate,
will you marry me?' as I understand it."

"Same here," laughed Kate.  "He said he had to be sure about his mother, and there was 'one
other thing' he'd write me about this week, and he'd come again next Sunday; then if things
were all right with me--the deluge!"

"And what is 'the other thing?'" asked Nancy Ellen.

"There he has me guessing.  We had six, long, lovely weeks of daily association at the lake,
I've seen his home, and his inventions, and as much of his business as is visible to the eye
of a woman who doesn't know a tinker about business.  His mother has told me minutely of his
life, every day since he was born, I think.  She insists that he never paid the slightest attention
to a girl before, and he says the same, so there can't be any hidden ugly feature to mar my
joy.  He is thoughtful, quick, kind, a self-made business man.  He looks well enough, he acts
like a gentleman, he seldom makes a mistake in speech--"

"He doesn't say enough to MAKE any mistakes.  I haven't yet heard him talk freely, give an
opinion, or discuss a question," said Nancy Ellen.

"Neither have I," said Kate.  "He's very silent, thinking out more inventions, maybe.  The
worst thing about him is a kind of hard-headed self-assurance.  He got it fighting for his
mother from boyhood.  He knew she would freeze and starve if he didn't take care of her; he
HAD to do it.  He soon found he could.  It took money to do what he had to do.  He got the
money.  Then he began performing miracles with it.  He lifted his mother out of poverty, he
dressed her 'in purple and fine linen,' he housed her in the same kind of home other rich men
of the Lake Shore Drive live in, and gave her the same kind of service.  As most men do, when
things begin to come their way, he lived for making money alone. He was so keen on the chase
he wouldn't stop to educate and culture himself; he drove headlong on, and on, piling up more,
far more than any one man should be allowed to have; so you can see that it isn't strange that
he thinks there's nothing on earth that money can't do.  You can see THAT sticking out all
over him.  At the hotel, on boats, on the trains, anywhere we went, he pushed straight for
the most conspicuous place, the most desirable thing, the most expensive.  I almost prayed
sometimes that in some way he would strike ONE SINGLE THING that he couldn't make come his
way with money; but he never did. No.  I haven't an idea what he has in his mind yet, but he's
going to write me about it this week, and if I agree to whatever it is, he is coming Sunday;
then he has threatened me with a 'deluge,' whatever he means by that."

"He means providing another teacher for Walden, taking you to Chicago shopping for a wonderful
trousseau, marrying you in his Lake Shore palace, no doubt."

"Well, if that's what he means by a 'deluge,'" said Kate, "he'll find the flood coming his
way.  He'll strike the first thing he can't do with money.  I shall teach my school this winter
as I agreed to.  I shall marry him in the clothes I buy with what I earn.  I shall marry him
quietly, here, or at Adam's, or before a Justice of the Peace, if neither of you wants me.
He can't pick me up, and carry me away, and dress me, and marry me, as if I were a pauper."

"You're RIGHT about it," said Nancy Ellen.  "I don't know how we came to be so different. 
I should do at once any way he suggested to get such a fine-looking man and that much money.
That it would be a humiliation to me all my after life, I wouldn't think about until the humiliation
began, and then I'd have no way to protect myself.  You're right!  But I'd get out of teaching
this winter if I could.  I'd love to have you here."

"But I must teach to the earn money for my outfit.  I'll have to go back to school in the same
old sailor."

"Don't you care," laughed Nancy Ellen.  "We know a secret!"

"That we do!" agreed Kate.

Wednesday Kate noticed Nancy Ellen watching for the boy Robert had promised to send with the
mail as soon as it was distributed, because she was, herself.  Twice Thursday, Kate hoped in
vain that the suspense would be over.  It had to end Friday, if John were coming Saturday night.
She began to resent the length of time he was waiting.  It was like him to wait until the last
minute, and then depend on money to carry him through.

"He is giving me a long time to think things over," Kate said to Nancy Ellen when there was
no letter in the afternoon mail Thursday.

"It may have been lost or delayed," said Nancy Ellen.  "It will come to-morrow, surely."

Both of them saw the boy turn in at the gate Friday morning.  Each saw that he carried more
than one letter.  Nancy Ellen was on her feet and nearer to the door; she stepped to it, and
took the letters, giving them a hasty glance as she handed them to Kate.

"Two," she said tersely.  "One, with the address written in the clear, bold hand of a gentleman,
and one, the straggle of a country clod-hopper."

Kate smiled as she took the letters:  "I'll wager my hat, which is my most precious possession,"
she said, "that the one with the beautifully written address comes from the 'clod-hopper,'
and the 'straggle' from the 'gentleman.'"

She glanced at the stamping and addresses and smiled again:  "So it proves," she said.  "While
I'm about it, I'll see what the 'clod-hopper' has to say, and then I shall be free to give
my whole attention to the 'gentleman.'"

"Oh, Kate, how can you!" cried Nancy Ellen.

"Way I'm made, I 'spect," said Kate.  "Anyway, that's the way this is going to be done."

She dropped the big square letter in her lap and ran her finger under the flap of the long,
thin, beautifully addressed envelope, and drew forth several quite as perfectly written sheets.
She read them slowly and deliberately, sometimes turning back a page and going over a part
of it again.  When she finished, she glanced at Nancy Ellen while slowly folding the sheets.
"Just for half a cent I'd ask you to read this," she said.

"I certainly shan't pay anything for the privilege, but I'll read it, if you want me to," offered
Nancy Ellen.

"All right, go ahead," said Kate.  "It might possibly teach you that you can't always judge
a man by appearance, or hastily; though just why George Holt looks more like a 'clod-hopper'
than Adam, or Hiram, or Andrew, it passes me to tell."

She handed Nancy Ellen the letter and slowly ripped open the flap of the heavy white envelope.
She drew forth the sheet and sat an instant with it in her fingers, watching the expression
of Nancy Ellen's face, while she read the most restrained yet impassioned plea that a man of
George Holt's nature and opportunities could devise to make to a woman after having spent several
months in the construction of it.  It was a masterly letter, perfectly composed, spelled, and
written; for among his other fields of endeavour, George Holt had taught several terms of country
school, and taught them with much success; so that he might have become a fine instructor,
had it been in his blood to stick to anything long enough to make it succeed.  After a page
as she turned the second sheet Nancy Ellen glanced at Kate, and saw that she had not opened
the creased page in her hands.  She flamed with sudden irritation.

"You do beat the band!" she cried.  "You've watched for two days and been provoked because
that letter didn't come.  Now you've got it, there you sit like a mummy and let your mind be
so filled with this idiotic drivel that you're not ever reading John Jardine's letter that
is to tell you what both of us are crazy to know."

"If you were in any mood to be fair and honest, you'd admit that you never read a finer letter
than THAT," said Kate.  "As for THIS, I never was so AFRAID in all my life.  Look at that!"

She threw the envelope in Nancy Ellen's lap.

"That is the very first line of John Jardine's writing I have ever seen," she said.  "Do you
see anything about it to ENCOURAGE me to go farther?"

"You Goose!" cried the exasperated Nancy Ellen.  "I suppose he transacts so much business he
scarcely ever puts pen to paper. What's the difference how he writes?  Look at what he is and
what he does!  Go on and read his letter."

Kate arose and walked to the window, turning her back to Nancy Ellen, who sat staring at her,
while she read John Jardine's letter.  Once Nancy Ellen saw Kate throw up her head and twist
her neck as if she were choking; then she heard a great gulping sob down in her throat; finally
Kate turned and stared at her with dazed, incredulous eyes. Slowly she dropped the letter,
deliberately set her foot on it, and leaving the room, climbed the stairs.  Nancy Ellen threw
George Holt's letter aside and snatched up John Jardine's.  She read:

MY DEREST KATE:  I am a day late with this becos as I told you I have no schooling and in writing
a letter is where I prove it, so I never write them, but it was not fare to you for you not
to know what kind of a letter I would write if I did write one, so here it is very bad no dout
but the best I can possably do which has got nothing at all to do with my pashion for you and
the aughful time I will have till I here from you.  If you can stand for this telagraf me and
I will come first train and we will forget this and I will never write another letter. With
derest love from Mother, and from me all the love of my hart. Forever yours only, JOHN JARDINE.

The writing would have been a discredit to a ten-year-old schoolboy. Nancy Ellen threw the
letter back on the floor; with a stiffly extended finger, she poked it into the position in
which she thought she had found it, and slowly stepped back.

"Great God!" she said amazedly.  "What does the man mean?  Where does that dainty and wonderful
little mother come in?  She must be a regular parasite, to take such ease and comfort for herself
out of him, and not see that he had time and chance to do better than THAT for himself. Kate
will never endure it, never in the world! And by the luck of the very Devil, there comes that
school-proof thing in the same mail, from that abominable George Holt, and Kate reads it FIRST.
It's too bad!  I can't believe it!  What did his mother mean?"

Suddenly Nancy Ellen began to cry bitterly; between sobs she could hear Kate as she walked
from closet and bureau to her trunk which she was packing.  The lid slammed heavily and a few
minutes later Kate entered the room dressed for the street.

"Why are you weeping?" she asked casually.

Her eyes were flaming, her cheeks scarlet, and her lips twitching. Nancy Ellen sat up and looked
at her.  She pointed to the letter: "I read that," she said.

"Well, what do I care?" said Kate.  "If he has no more respect for me than to write me such
an insult as that, why should I have the respect for him to protect him in it?  Publish it
in the paper if you want to."

"Kate, what are you going to do?" demanded Nancy Ellen.

"Three things," said Kate, slowly putting on her long silk gloves. "First, I'm going to telegraph
John Jardine that I never shall see him again, if I can possibly avoid it.  Second, I'm going
to send a drayman to get my trunk and take it to Walden.  Third, I'm going to start out and
walk miles, I don't know or care where; but in the end, I'm going to Walden to clean the schoolhouse
and get ready for my winter term of school."

"Oh, Kate, you are such a fine teacher!  Teach him!  Don't be so hurried!  Take more time to
think.  You will break his heart," pleaded Nancy Ellen.

Kate threw out both hands, palms down.

"P-a-s-h, a-u-g-h, h-a-r-t, d-o-u-t, d-e-r-e," she slowly spelled out the letters.  "What about
my heart and my pride?  Think I can respect that, or ask my children to respect it?  But thank
you and Robert, and come after me as often as you can, as a mercy to me. If John persists in
coming, to try to buy me, as he thinks he can buy anything he wants, you needn't let him come
to Walden; for probably I won't be there until I have to, and I won't see him, or his mother,
so he needn't try to bring her in.  Say good-bye to Robert for me."

She walked from the house, head erect, shoulders squared, and so down the street from sight.
In half an hour a truckman came for her trunk, so Nancy Ellen made everything Kate had missed
into a bundle to send with it.  When she came to the letters, she hesitated.

"I guess she didn't want them," she said.  "I'll just keep them awhile and if she doesn't ask
about them, the next time she comes, I'll burn them.  Robert must go after her every Friday
evening, and we'll keep her until Monday, and do all we can to cheer her; and this very day
he must find out all there is to know about that George Holt.  That IS the finest letter I
ever read; she does kind of stand up for him; and in the reaction, impulsive as she is and
self-confident--of course she wouldn't, but you never can tell what kind of fool a girl will
make of herself, in some cases."

Kate walked swiftly, finished two of the errands she set out to do, then her feet carried her
three miles from Hartley on the Walden road, before she knew where she was, so she proceeded
to the village.

Mrs. Holt was not at home, but the house was standing open.  Kate found her room cleaned, shining,
and filled with flowers. "The notes of Reynolds, treasures of practical observation, place him
among those whom we may read with profit." De Piles and Felibien are spoken of next, as the
teachers of "what may be learned from precept, founded on prescriptive authority more than on the
verdicts of nature." Of the effects of the system pursued by the French Academy from such
precepts, our author is, perhaps, not undeservedly severe.

"About the middle of the last century the German critics, established at Rome, began to claim
the exclusive privilege of teaching the art, and to form a complete system of antique style.
The verdicts of Mengs and Winkelmann, become the oracles of antiquaries,
dilettanti, and artists, from the Pyrenees to the utmost north of
Europe, have been detailed, and are not without their influence here.  She heard him come closer and knew when he seated himself that he was watching her,
but she did not care enough even to move.  Finally she shifted her position to rest herself,
opened her eyes, and looked at him without a word.  He returned her gaze steadily, smiling
gravely.  She had never seen him looking so well.  He had put in the summer grooming himself,
he had kept up the house and garden, and spent all his spare time on the ravine, and farming
on the shares with his mother's sister who lived three miles east of them.  At last she roused
herself and again looked at him.

"I had your letter this morning," she said.

"I was wondering about that," he replied.

"Yes, I got it just before I started," said Kate.  "Are you surprised to see me?"

"No," he answered.  "After last year, we figured you might come the last of this week or the
first of next, so we got your room ready Monday."

"Thank you," said Kate.  "It's very clean and nice."

"I hope soon to be able to offer you such a room and home as you should have," he said.  "I
haven't opened my office yet.  It was late and hot when I got home in June and Mother was fussing
about this winter--that she had no garden and didn't do her share at Aunt Ollie's, so I have
farmed most of the summer, and lived on hope; but I'll start in and make things fly this fall,
and by spring I'll be sailing around with a horse and carriage like the best of them.  You
bet I am going to make things hum, so I can offer you anything you want."

"You haven't opened an office yet?" she asked for the sake of saying something, and because
a practical thing would naturally suggest itself to her.

"I haven't had a breath of time," he said in candid disclaimer.

"Why don't you ask me what's the matter?"

"Didn't figure that it was any of my business in the first place," he said, "and I have a pretty
fair idea, in the second."

"But how could you have?" she asked in surprise.

"When your sister wouldn't give me your address, she hinted that you had all the masculine
attention you cared for; then Tilly Nepple visited town again last week and she had been sick
and called Dr. Gray. She asked him about you, and he told what I fine time you had at Chautauqua
and Chicago, with the rich new friends you'd made.  I was watching for you about this time,
and I just happened to be at the station in Hartley last Saturday when you got off the train
with your fine gentleman, so I stayed over with some friends of mine, and I saw you several
times Sunday.  I saw that I'd practically no chance with you at all; but I made up my mind
I'd stick until I saw you marry him, so I wrote just as I would if I hadn't known there was
another man in existence."

"That was a very fine letter," said Kate.

"It is a very fine, deep, sincere love that I am offering you," said George Holt.  "Of course
I could see prosperity sticking out all over that city chap, but it didn't bother me much,
because I knew that you, of all women, would judge a man on his worth.  A rising young professional
man is not to be sneered at, at least until he makes his start and proves what he can do. 
I couldn't get an early start, because I've always had to work, just as you've seen me last
summer and this, so I couldn't educate myself so fast, but I've gone as fast and far as I could."

Kate winced.  This was getting on places that hurt and to matters she well understood, but
she was the soul of candour.  "You did very well to educate yourself as you have, with no help
at all," she said.

"I've done my best in the past, I'm going to do marvels in the future, and whatever I do, it
is all for you and yours for the taking," he said grandiosely.

"Thank you," said Kate.  "But are you making that offer when you can't help seeing that I'm
in deep trouble?"

"A thousand times over," he said.  "All I want to know about your trouble is whether there
is anything a man of my size and strength can do to help you."

"Not a thing," said Kate, "in the direction of slaying a gay deceiver, if that's what you mean.
The extent of my familiarities with John Jardine consists in voluntarily kissing him twice
last Sunday night for the first and last time, once for himself, and once for his mother, whom
I have since ceased to respect."

George Holt was watching her with eyes lynx-sharp, but Kate never saw it.  When she mentioned
her farewell of Sunday night, a queer smile swept over his face and instantly disappeared.

"I should thing any girl might be permitted that much, in saying a final good-bye to a man
who had shown her a fine time for weeks," he commented casually.

"But I didn't know I was saying good-bye," explained Kate.  "I expected him back in a week,
and that I would then arrange to marry him.  That was the agreement we made then."

As she began to speak, George Holt's face flashed triumph at having led her on; at what she
said it fell perceptibly, but he instantly controlled it and said casually:  "In any event,
it was your own business."

"It was," said Kate.  "I had given no man the slightest encouragement, I was perfectly free.
John Jardine was courting me openly in the presence of his mother and any one who happened
to be around.  I intended to marry him.  I liked him as much as any man need be liked. I don't
know whether it was the same feeling Nancy Ellen had for Robert Gray or not, but it was a whole
lot of feeling of some kind.  I was satisfied with it, and he would have been.  I meant to
be a good wife to him and a good daughter to his mother, and I could have done much good in
the world and extracted untold pleasure from the money he would have put in my power to handle.
All was going 'merry as a marriage bell,' and then this morning came my Waterloo, in the same
post with your letter."

"Do you know what you are doing?" cried George Holt, roughly, losing self-control with hope.
"YOU ARE PROVING TO ME, AND ADMITTING TO YOURSELF, THAT YOU NEVER LOVED THAT MAN AT ALL.  You
were flattered, and tempted with position and riches, but your heart was not his, or you would
be mighty SURE of it, don't you forget that!"

"I am not interested in analyzing exactly what I felt for him," said Kate.  "It made small
difference then; it makes none at all now.  I would have married him gladly, and I would have
been to him all a good wife is to any man; then in a few seconds I turned squarely against
him, and lost my respect for him.  You couldn't marry me to him if he were the last and only
man on earth; but it hurt terribly, let me tell you that!"

George Holt suddenly arose and went to Kate.  He sat down close beside her and leaned toward her.

"There isn't the least danger of my trying to marry you to him," he said, "because I am going
to marry you myself at the very first opportunity.  Why not now?  Why not have a simple ceremony
somewhere at once, and go away until school begins, and forget him, having a good time by ourselves?
Come on, Kate, let's do it! We can go stay with Aunt Ollie, and if he comes trying to force
himself on you, he'll get what he deserves.  He'll learn that there is something on earth he
can't buy with his money."

"But I don't love you," said Kate.

"Neither did you love him," retorted George Holt.  "I can prove it by what you say.  Neither
did you love him, but you were going to marry him, and use all his wonderful power of position
and wealth, and trust to association to BRING love. Hesden Le Moyne," she continued, rising, and
standing before him, "you are a brave man and a proud one. You are so brave that you would
not hesitate to acknowledge your regard for me, despite the fact that I am a 'nigger-teacher.'
It is a noble act, and I honor you for it.

"Of course we could make it all right, as to a living," said Kate. "Big and strong as we are,
but--"

Then the torrent broke.  At the first hint that she would consider his proposal George Holt
drew her to him and talked volumes of impassioned love to her.  He gave her no chance to say
anything; he said all there was to say himself; he urged that Jardine would come, and she should
not be there.  He begged, he pleaded, he reasoned.  Night found Kate sitting on the back porch
at Aunt Ollie's with a confused memory of having stood beside the little stream with her hand
in George Holt's while she assented to the questions of a Justice of the Peace, in the presence
of the School Director and Mrs. Holt.  She knew that immediately thereafter they had walked
away along a hot, dusty country road; she had tried to eat something that tasted like salted
ashes. She could hear George's ringing laugh of exultation breaking out afresh every few minutes;
in sudden irritation at the latest guffaw she clearly remembered one thing:  in her dazed and
bewildered state she had forgotten to tell him that she was a Prodigal Daughter.

CHAPTER XIII

THE BRIDE

ONLY one memory in the ten days that followed before her school began ever stood out clearly
and distinctly with Kate.  That was the morning of the day after she married George Holt. 
She saw Nancy Ellen and Robert at the gate so she went out to speak with them.  Nancy Ellen
was driving, she held the lines and the whip in her hands.  Kate in dull apathy wondered why
they seemed so deeply agitated.  Both of them stared at her as if she might be a maniac.

"Is this thing in the morning paper true?" cried Nancy Ellen in a high, shrill voice that made
Kate start in wonder.  She did not take the trouble to evade by asking "what thing?" she merely
made assent with her head.

"You are married to that--that--" Nancy Ellen choked until she could not say what.

"It's TIME to stop, since I am married to him," said Kate, gravely.

"You rushed in and married him without giving Robert time to find out and tell you what everybody
knows about him?" demanded Nancy Ellen.

"I married him for what I knew about him myself," said Kate.  "We shall do very well."

"Do well!" cried Nancy.  "Do well!  You'll be hungry and in rags the rest of your life!"

"Don't, Nancy Ellen, don't!" plead Robert.  "This is Kate's affair, wait until you hear what
she has to say before you go further."

"I don't care what she has to say!" cried Nancy Ellen.  "I'm saying my say right now.  This
is a disgrace to the whole Bates family.  We may not be much, but there isn't a lazy, gambling,
drunken loafer among us, and there won't be so far as I'm concerned."

She glared at Kate who gazed at her in wonder.

"You really married this lout?" she demanded.

"I told you I was married," said Kate, patiently, for she saw that Nancy Ellen was irresponsible
with anger.

"You're going to live with him, you're going to stay in Walden to live?" she cried.

"That is my plan at present," said Kate.

"Well, see that YOU STAY THERE," said Nancy Ellen.  "You can't bring that--that creature to
my house, and if you're going to be his wife, you needn't come yourself.  That's all I've got
to say to you, you shameless, crazy--"

"Nancy Ellen, you shall not!" cried Robert Gray, deftly slipping the lines from her fingers,
and starting the horse full speed. Kate saw Nancy Ellen's head fall forward, and her hands
lifted to cover her face.  She heard the deep, tearing sob that shook her, and then they were
gone.  She did not know what to do, so she stood still in the hot sunshine, trying to think;
but her brain refused to act at her will. When the heat became oppressive, she turned back
to the shade of a tree, sat down, and leaned against it.  There she got two things clear after
a time.  She had married George Holt, there was nothing to do but make the best of it.  But
Nancy Ellen had said that if she lived with him she should not come to her home.  Very well.
She had to live with him, since she had consented to marry him, so she was cut off from Robert
and Nancy Ellen.  She was now a prodigal, indeed.  And those things Nancy Ellen had said--she
was wild with anger.  She had been misinformed.  Those things could not be true.

"Shouldn't you be in here helping Aunt Ollie?" asked George's voice from the front step where
he seated himself with his pipe.

"Yes, in a minute," said Kate, rising.  "Did you see who came?"

"No.  I was out doing the morning work.  Who was it?" he asked.

"Nancy Ellen and Robert," she answered.

He laughed hilariously:  "Brought them in a hurry, didn't we?  Why didn't they come in?"

"They came to tell me," said Kate, slowly, "that if I had married you yesterday, as I did,
that they felt so disgraced that I wasn't to come to their home again."

"'Disgraced?'" he cried, his colour rising.  "Well, what's the matter with me?"

"Not the things they said, I fervently hope."

"Well, they have some assurance to come out here and talk about me, and you've got as much
to listen, and then come and tell me about it," he cried.

"It was over in a minute," said Kate.  "I'd no idea what they were going to say.  They said
it, and went.  Oh, I can't spare Nancy Ellen, she's all I had!"

Kate sank down on the step and covered her face.  George took one long look at her, arose,
and walked out of hearing.  He went into the garden and watched from behind a honeysuckle bush
until he saw her finally lift her head and wipe her eyes; then he sauntered back, and sat down
on the step beside her.

"That's right," he said.  "Cry it out, and get it over.  It was pretty mean of them to come
out here and insult you, and tell any lie they could think up, and then drive away and leave
you; but don't mind, they'll soon get over it.  Nobody ever keeps up a fuss over a wedding long."

"Nancy Ellen never told a lie in her life," said Kate.  "She has too much self-respect.  What
she said she THOUGHT was true.  My only chance is that somebody has told her a lie.  You know
best if they did."

"Of course they did," he broke in, glibly.  "Haven't you lived in the same house with me long
enough to know me better than any one else does?"

"You can live in the same house with people and know less about them than any one else, for
that matter," said Kate, "but that's neither here nor there.  We're in this together, we got
to get on the job and pull, and make a success out of it that will make all of them proud to
be our friends.  That's the only thing left for me.  As I know the Bates, once they make up
their minds, they never change.  With Nancy Ellen and Father both down on me, I'm a prodigal
for sure."

"What?" he cried, loudly.  "What?  Is your father in this, too? Did he send you word you couldn't
come home, either?  This is a hell of a mess!  Speak up!"

Kate closed her lips, looked at him with deep scorn, and walked around the corner of the house.
For a second he looked after her threateningly, then he sprang to his feet, and ran to her,
catching her in his arms.

"Forgive me, dearest," he cried.  "That took the wind out of my sails until I was a brute.
You'd no business to SAY a thing like that.  Of course we can't have the old Land King down
on us. We've got to have our share of that land and money to buy us a fine home in Hartley,
and fix me up the kind of an office I should have.  We'll borrow a rig and drive over to-morrow
and fix things solid with the old folks.  You bet I'm a star-spangled old persuader, look what
I did with you--"

"You stop!" cried Kate, breaking from his hold.  "You will drive me crazy!  You're talking
as if you married me expecting land and money from it.  I haven't been home in a year, and
my father would deliberately kill me if I went within his reach."

"Well, score one for little old scratchin', pickin', Mammy!" he cried. "She SAID you had a secret!"

Kate stood very still, looking at him so intently that a sense of shame must have stirred in
his breast.

"Look here, Kate," he said, roughly.  "Mother did say you had a secret, and she hinted at Christmas
that the reason you didn't go home was because your folks were at outs with you, and you can
ask her if I didn't tell her to shut up and leave you alone, that I was in love with you, and
I'd marry you and we'd get along all right, even if you were barred from home, and didn't get
a penny. I just dare you to ask her."

"It's no matter," said Kate, wearily.  "I'd rather take your word."

"All right, you take it, for that's the truth," he said.  "But what was the rumpus?  How did
you come to have a racket with your old man?"

"Over my wanting to teach," said Kate.  Then she explained in detail.

"Pother!  Don't you fret about that!" said George.  "I'm taking care of you now, and I'll see
that you soon get home and to Grays', too; that's all buncombe.  As for your share of your
father's estate, you watch me get it!  You are his child, and there is law!"

"There's law that allows him to deed his land to his sons before he dies, and that is exactly
what he has done," said Kate.

"The Devil, you say!" shouted George Holt, stepping back to stare at her.  "You tell that at
the Insane Asylum or the Feeble Minded Home! I've seen the records!  I know to the acre how
much land stands in your father's name.  Don't try to work that on me, my lady."

"I am not trying to work anything on you," said Kate, dully, wondering to herself why she listened,
why she went on with it. "I'm merely telling you.  In Father's big chest at the head of his
bed at home lies a deed for two hundred acres of land for each of his seven sons, all signed
and ready to deliver.  He keeps the land in his name on record to bring him distinction and
feed his vanity.  He makes the boys pay the taxes, and ko-tow, and help with his work; he keeps
them under control; but the land is theirs; none of the girls get a penny's worth of it!"

George Holt cleared his face with an effort.

"Well, we are no worse off than the rest of them, then," he said, trying to speak naturally
and cheerfully.  "But don't you ever believe it!  Little old Georgie will sleep with this in
his night cap awhile, and it's a problem he will solve if he works himself to death on it."

"But that is Father's affair," said Kate.  "You had best turn your efforts, and lie awake nights
thinking how to make enough money to buy some land for us, yourself."

"Certainly!  Certainly!  I see myself doing it!" laughed George Holt. "And now, knowing how
you feel, and feeling none to good myself, we are going to take a few days off and go upstream,
fishing.  I'll take a pack of comforts to sleep on, and the tackle and some food, and we will
forget the whole bunch and go have a good time.  There's a place, not so far away, where I
have camped beside a spring since I was a little shaver, and it's quiet and cool.  Go get what
you can't possibly exist without, nothing more."

"But we must dig the potatoes," protested Kate.

"Let them wait until we get back; it's a trifle early, anyway," he said.  "Stop objecting and
get ready!  I'll tell Aunt Ollie. We're chums.  Whatever I do is always all right with her.
Come on!  This is our wedding trip.  Not much like the one you had planned, no doubt, but one
of some kind."

So they slipped beneath the tangle of vines and bushes, and, following the stream of the ravine,
they walked until mid-afternoon, when they reached a spot that was very lovely, a clear, clean
spring, grassy bank, a sheltered cave-in floored with clean sand, warm and golden. From the
depths of the cave George brought an old frying pan and coffee pot.  He spread a comfort on
the sand of the cave for a bed, produced coffee, steak, bread, butter, and fruit from his load,
and told Kate to make herself comfortable while he got dinner.  They each tried to make allowances
for, and to be as decent as possible with, the other, with the result that before they knew
it, they were having a good time; at least, they were keeping the irritating things they thought
to themselves, and saying only the pleasant ones.

After a week, which George enjoyed to the fullest extent, while Kate made the best of everything,
they put away the coffee pot and frying pan, folded the comforts, and went back to Aunt Ollie's
for dinner; then to Walden in the afternoon.  Because Mrs. Holt knew they would be there that
day she had the house clean and the best supper she could prepare ready for them.  She was
in a quandary as to how to begin with Kate.  She heartily hated her.  She had been sure the
girl had a secret, now she knew it; for if she did not attend the wedding of her sister, if
she had not been at home all summer, if her father and mother never mentioned her name or made
any answer to any one who did, there was a reason, and a good reason.  Of course a man as rich
as Adam Bates could do no wrong; whatever the trouble was, Kate was at fault, she had done
some terrible thing.

"Hidin' in the bushes!" spat Mrs. Holt.  "Hidin' in the bushes! Marry a man who didn't know
he was goin' to be married an hour before, unbeknownst to her folks, an' wouldn't even come
in the house, an' have a few of the neighbours in.  Nice doin's for the school-ma'am!  Nice
prospect for George."

Mrs. Holt hissed like a copperhead, which was a harmless little creature compared with her,
as she scraped, and slashed, and dismembered the chicken she was preparing to fry.  She had
not been able, even by running into each store in the village, and the post office, to find
one person who would say a word against Kate. The girl had laid her foundations too well. 
The one thing people could and did say was:  "How could she marry George Holt?"  The worst
of them could not very well say it to his mother.  They said it frequently to each other and
then supplied the true answers. "Look how he spruced up after she came!"  "Look how he worked!"
"Look how he ran after and waited on her!"  "Look how nice he has been all summer!"  Plenty
was being said in Walden, but not one word of it was for the itching ears of Mrs. Holt.  They
had told her how splendid Kate was, how they loved her, how glad they were that she was to
have the school again, how fortunate her son was, how proud she should be, until she was almost
bursting with repressed venom. 

Did not Attalus do the same? who without an afterthought expended more than 6000 sesterces to
have a picture of Bacchus painted by Aristides. This picture was placed by Lucius Mummius,
with great pomp to adorn Rome, in the temple of Ceres.

But although the nobility of this art was so highly valued, it is
uncertain to whom it owes its origin.

As I have already said, it is found in very ancient times among the Chaldeans, some attribute
the honour to the Ethiopians, while the Greeks claim it for themselves.



Kate laughed and went into the house.  George stepped in front of his mother.

"Now you look here," he said.  "I know every nasty thing your mind has conjured up that you'd
LIKE to say, and have other folks say, about Kate.  And I know as well as if you were honest
enough to tell me, that you haven't been able to root out one living soul who would say a single
word against her.  Swallow your secret! Swallow your suspicions! Swallow your venom, and forget
all of them.  Kate is as fine a woman as God ever made, and anybody who has common sense knows
it.  She can just MAKE me, if she wants to, and she will; she's coming on fine, much faster
and better than I hoped for.  Now you drop this!  Stop it!  Do you hear?"

He passed her and hurried up the walk.  In an hour, both George and Kate had bathed and dressed
in their very best.  Kate put on her prettiest white dress and George his graduation suit.
Then together they walked to the post office for their mail, which George had ordered held,
before they left.  Carrying the bundle, they entered several stores on trifling errands, and
then went home.  They stopped and spoke to everyone.  Kate kissed all her little pupils she
met, and told them to come to see her, and to be ready to help clean the schoolhouse in the
morning.  Word flew over town swiftly.  The Teacher was back, wearing the loveliest dress,
and nicer than ever, and she had invited folks to come to see her.

Kate and George had scarcely finished their supper, when the first pair of shy little girls
came for their kisses and to bring "Teacher" a bunch of flowers and a pretty pocket handkerchief
from each.  They came in flocks, each with flowers, most with a towel or some small remembrance;
then the elders began to come, merchants with comforts, blankets, and towels, hardware men
with frying pans, flat irons, and tinware.  By ten o'clock almost everyone in Walden had carried
Kate some small gift, wished her joy all the more earnestly, because they felt the chances
of her ever having it were so small, and had gone their way, leaving her feeling better than
she had thought possible.

She slipped into her room alone and read two letters, one a few typewritten lines from John
Jardine, saying he had been at Hartley, also at Walden, and having found her married and gone,
there was nothing for him to do but wish that the man she married had it in his heart to guard
her life and happiness as he would have done.  He would never cease to love her, and if at
any time in her life there was anything he could do for her, would she please let him know.
Kate dropped the letter on her dresser, with a purpose, and let it lie there.  The other was
from Robert.  He said he was very sorry, but he could do nothing with Nancy Ellen at present.
He hoped she would change later.  If there was ever anything he could do, to let him know.
Kate locked that letter in her trunk.  She wondered as she did so why both of them seemed to
think she would need them in the future.  She felt perfectly able to take care of herself.

Monday morning George carried Kate's books to school for her, saw that she was started on her
work in good shape, then went home, put on his old clothes, and began the fall work at Aunt
Ollie's. Kate, wearing her prettiest blue dress, forgot even the dull ache in her heart, as
she threw herself into the business of educating those young people.  She worked as she never
had before.  She seemed to have developed fresh patience, new perception, keener penetration;
she made the dullest of them see her points, and interested the most inattentive.  She went
home to dinner feeling better.  She decided to keep on teaching a few years until George was
well started in his practice; if he ever got started.  He was very slow in action it seemed
to her, compared with his enthusiasm when he talked.

CHAPTER XIV

STARTING MARRIED LIFE

FOR two weeks Kate threw herself into the business of teaching with all her power.  She succeeded
in so interesting herself and her pupils that she was convinced she had done a wise thing.
Marriage did not interfere with her teaching; she felt capable and independent so long as she
had her salary.  George was working and working diligently, to prepare for winter, whenever
she was present or could see results.  With her first month's salary she would buy herself
a warm coat, a wool suit, an extra skirt for school, and some waists.  If there was enough
left, she would have another real hat.  Then for the remainder of the year she would spend
only for the barest necessities and save to help toward a home something like Nancy Ellen's.
Whenever she thought of Nancy Ellen and Robert there was a choking sensation in her throat,
a dull ache where she had been taught her heart was located.

For two weeks everything went as well as Kate hoped:  then Mrs. Holt began to show the results
of having been partially bottled up, for the first time in her life.  She was careful to keep
to generalities which she could claim meant nothing, if anything she said was taken up by either
George or Kate.  George was too lazy to quarrel unless he was personally angered; Kate thought
best to ignore anything that did not come in the nature of a direct attack.  So long as Mrs.
Holt could not understand how some folks could see their way to live off of other folks, or
why a girl who had a chance to marry a fortune would make herself a burden to a poor man, Kate
made the mistake of ignoring her. Thus emboldened she soon became personal.  It seemed as if
she spent her spare time and mental force thinking up suggestive, sarcastic things to say,
where Kate could not help hearing them.  She paid no attention unless the attack was too mean
and premeditated; but to her surprise she found that every ugly, malicious word the old woman
said lodged in her brain and arose to confront her at the most inopportune times--in the middle
of a recitation or when she roused enough to turn over in her bed at night.  The more vigorously
she threw herself into her school work, the more she realized a queer lassitude, creeping over
her.  She kept squaring her shoulders, lifting her chin, and brushing imaginary cobwebs from
before her face.

The final Friday evening of the month, she stopped at the post office and carried away with
her the bill for her Leghorn hat, mailed with nicely conceived estimate as to when her first
check would be due. Kate visited the Trustee, and smiled grimly as she slipped the amount in
an envelope and gave it to the hack driver to carry to Hartley on his trip the following day.
She had intended all fall to go with him and select a winter headpiece that would be no discredit
to her summer choice, but a sort of numbness was in her bones; so she decided to wait until
the coming week before going.  She declined George's pressing invitation to go along to Aunt
Ollie's and help load and bring home a part of his share of their summer's crops, on the ground
that she had some work to prepare for the coming week.

Then Kate went to her room feeling faint and heavy.  She lay there most of the day, becoming
sorrier for herself, and heavier every passing hour.  By morning she was violently ill; when
she tried to leave her bed, dizzy and faint.  All day she could not stand. Toward evening,
she appealed to George either to do something for her himself, or to send for the village doctor.
He asked her a few questions and then, laughing coarsely, told her that a doctor would do her
no good, and that it was very probable that she would feel far worse before she felt better.
Kate stared at him in dumb wonder.

"But my school!" she cried.  "My school!  I must be able to go to school in the morning.  Could
that spring water have been infected with typhus?  I've never been sick like this before."

"I should hope not!" said George.  And then he told her bluntly what caused her trouble.  Kate
had been white to begin with, now she slowly turned greenish as she gazed at him with incredulous
eyes.  Then she sprang to her feet.

"But I can't be ill!" she cried.  "I can't!  There is my school! But according to Pliny this art
was introduced into Egypt by Gyges of Lydia, who on seeing his shadow
cast by the fire, at once drew a representation of himself on the
wall with a piece of coal.

For some time after that it was the custom to draw in outline only, without any colouring, Pliny
again being our authority. This was afterwards introduced by Philocles of Egypt with considerable
pains, and also by Cleanthes and Ardices of Corinth and by Telephanes of Sicyon.
  "I don't see people falling
over each other to get to you for professional services, and it's hard work anyway.  Zonoletics
are away above the head of these country ignoramuses; blue mass and quinine are about their limit."

He took his time to bathe Kate's face.  Presently she sat up, then fell on the pillow again.

"Better not try that!" warned George.  "You'll hurt yourself, and you can't make it.  You're
out of the game; you might as well get used to it."

"I won't be out of the game!" cried Kate.  "I can't be!  What will become of my school?  Oh,
George, could you possibly teach for me, only for a few days, until I get my stomach settled?"

"Why, I'd like to help you," he said, "but you see how it is with me. I've got my fall work
finished up, and I'm getting ready to open my office next week.  I'm going to rent that nice
front room over the post office."

"But, George, you must," said Kate.  "You've taught several terms. You've a license.  You can
take it until this passes.  If you have waited from June to October to open your office, you
can wait a few more days.  Suppose you OPEN the office and patients don't come, or we haven't
the school; what would we LIVE on?  What would I buy things with, and pay doctor bills?"

"Why didn't you think of that before you got married?  What was your rush, anyway?  I can't
figure it to save my soul," he said.

"George, the school can't go," she cried.  "If what you say is true, and I suspect it is, I
must have money to see me through."

"Then set your wits to work and fix things up with your father," he said casually.

Kate arose tall and straight, standing unwaveringly as she looked at him in blazing contempt.

"So?" she said.  "This is the kind of man you are?  I'm not so helpless as you think me.  I
have a refuge.  I know where to find it.  You'll teach my school until I'm able to take it
myself, if the Trustee and patrons will allow you, or I'll sever my relations with you as quickly
as I formed them.  You have no practice; I have grave doubts if you can get any; this is our
only chance for the money we must have this winter.  Go ask the Trustee to come here until
I can make arrangements with him."

Then she wavered and rolled on the bed again.  George stood looking at her between narrowed
eyelids.

"Tactics I use with Mother don't go with you, old girl," he said to himself.  "Thing of fire
and tow, stubborn as an ox; won't be pushed a hair's breadth; old Bates over again--alike as
two peas.  But I'll break you, damn you, I'll break you; only, I WANT that school.  Lots easier
than kneading somebody's old stiff muscles, while the money is sure.  Oh, I go after the Trustee,
all right!"

He revived Kate, and telling her to keep quiet, and not excite herself, he explained that it
was a terrible sacrifice to him to put off opening his office any longer; she must forgive
him for losing self-control when he thought of it; but for her dear sake he would teach until
she was better--possibly she would be all right in a few days, and then she could take her
work again. Because she so devoutly hoped it, Kate made that arrangement with the Trustee.
Monday, she lay half starved, yet gagging and ill, while George went to teach her school. 
As she contemplated that, she grew sicker than she had been before.  When she suddenly marshalled
all the facts she knew of him, she stoutly refused to think of what Nancy Ellen had said; when
she reviewed his character and disposition, and thought of him taking charge of the minds of
her pupils, Kate suddenly felt she must not allow that to happen, she must not!  Then came
another thought, even more personal and terrible, a thought so disconcerting she mercifully
lost consciousness again.

She sent for the village doctor, and found no consolation from her talk with him.  She was
out of the school; that was settled.  No harpy ever went to its meat with one half the zest
Mrs. Holt found in the situation.  With Kate so ill she could not stand on her feet half the
time, so ill she could not reply, with no spirit left to appeal to George, what more could
be asked?  Mrs. Holt could add to every grievance she formerly had, that of a sick woman in
the house for her to wait on.  She could even make vile insinuations to Kate, prostrate and
helpless, that she would not have dared otherwise.  She could prepare food that with a touch
of salt or sugar where it was not supposed to be, would have sickened a well person.  One day
George came in from school and saw a bowl of broth sitting on a chair beside Kate's bed.

"Can't you drink it?" he asked.  "Do, if you possibly can," he urged. "You'll get so weak you'll
be helpless."

"I just can't," said Kate.  "Things have such a sickening, sweetish taste, or they are bitter,
or sour; not a thing is as it used to be.  I simply can't!"

A curious look crept over George's face.  He picked up the bowl and tasted the contents.  Instantly
his face went black; he started toward the kitchen.  Kate heard part of what happened, but
she never lifted her head.  After a while he came back with more broth and a plate of delicate
toast.

"Try this," he said.  "I made it myself."

Kate ate ravenously.

"That's good!" she cried.

"I'll tell you what I'm going to do," he said.  "I'm going to take you out to Aunt Ollie's
for a week after school to-night.  Want to go?"

"Yes!  Oh, yes!" cried Kate.
