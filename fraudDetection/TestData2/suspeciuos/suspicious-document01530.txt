As he spoke, gesticulating furiously, in front of the open window, the deep red glow of the
setting sun, piercing through the boughs of the ash- trees, threw its bright reflections on
his blazing eyeballs and convulsed features.  His interlocutor, leaning against the opposite
corner of the window-frame, noticed, with some anxiety, the extreme agitation of his behavior,
and wondered what could be the cause of such emotion.

"I?  Not frank with you!  Ah, that is a good joke, Monsieur de Buxieres! Naturally, I should
not go proclaiming on the housetops that I have a tender feeling for Mademoiselle Vincart,
but, all the same, I should have told you had you asked me sooner.  I am not reserved; but,
you must excuse my saying it, you are walled in like a subterranean passage.  One can not get
at the color of your thoughts.  I never for a moment imagined that you were interested in Reine,
and you never have made me sufficiently at home to entertain the idea of confiding in you on
that subject."

Julien remained silent.  He had reseated himself at the table, where, leaning his head in his
hands, he pondered over what Claudet had said. He placed his hand so as to screen his eyes,
and bit his lips as if a painful struggle was going on within him.  The splendors of the setting
sun had merged into the dusky twilight, and the last piping notes of the birds sounded faintly
among the sombre trees.  A fresh breeze had sprung up, and filled the darkening room with the
odor of honeysuckle.

Under the soothing influence of the falling night, Julien slowly raised his head, and addressing
Claudet in a low and measured voice like a father confessor interrogating a penitent, said:

"Does Reine know that you love her?"

"I think she must suspect it," replied Claudet, "although I never have ventured to declare
myself squarely.  But girls are very quick, Reine especially.  They soon begin to suspect there
is some love at bottom, when a young man begins to hang around them too frequently."

"You see her often, then?"

"Not as often as I should like.  But, you know, when one lives in the same district, one has
opportunities of meeting--at the beech harvest, in the woods, at the church door.  And when
you meet, you talk but little, making the most of your time.  Still, you must not suppose,
as I think you did, that we have rendezvous in the evening.  Reine respects herself too much
to go about at night with a young man as escort, and besides, she has other fish to fry.  She
has a great deal to do at the farm, since her father has become an invalid."

"Well, do you think she loves you?"  said Julien, with a movement of nervous irritation.

"I can not tell," replied Claudet shrugging his shoulders, "she has confidence in me, and shows
me some marks of friendship, but I never have ventured to ask her whether she feels anything
more than friendship for me.  Look here, now.  I have good reasons for keeping back; she is
rich and I am poor.  You can understand that I would not, for any consideration, allow her
to think that I am courting her for her money--"

"Still, you desire to marry her, and you hope that she will not say no-- you acknowledge that!"
cried Julien, vociferously.

Claudet, struck with the violence and bitterness of tone of his companion, came up to him.

"How angrily you say that, Monsieur de Buxieres!"  exclaimed he in his turn; "upon my word,
one might suppose the affair is very displeasing to you.  Will you let me tell you frankly
an idea that has already entered my head several times these last two or three days, and which
has come again now, while I have been listening to you?  It is that perhaps you, yourself,
are also in love with Reine?"

"I!"  protested Julien.  He felt humiliated at Claudet's perspicacity; but he had too much
pride and selfrespect to let his preferred rival know of his unfortunate passion.  He waited
a moment to swallow something in his throat that seemed to be choking him, and then, trying
in vain to steady his voice, he added:

"You know that I have an aversion for women; and for that matter, I think they return it with
interest.  But, at all events, I am not foolish enough to expose myself to their rebuffs. 
Rest assured, I shall not follow at your heels!"

Claudet shook his head incredulously.

"You doubt it," continued de Buxieres; "well, I will prove it to you. You can not declare your
wishes because Reine is rich and you are poor? I will take charge of the whole matter."

"I--I do not understand you," faltered Claudet, bewildered at the strange turn the conversation
was taking.

"You will understand-soon," asserted Julien, with a gesture of both decision and resignation.

The truth was, he had made one of those resolutions which seem illogical and foolish at first
sight, but are natural to minds at once timid and exalted.  The suffering caused by Claudet's
revelations had become so acute that he was alarmed.  He recognized with dismay the disastrous
effects of this hopeless love, and determined to employ a heroic remedy to arrest its further
ravages.  This was nothing less than killing his love, by immediately getting Claudet married
to Reine Vincart. Sacrifices like this are easier to souls that have been subjected since their
infancy to Christian discipline, and accustomed to consider the renunciation of mundane joys
as a means of securing eternal salvation. As soon as this idea had developed in Julien's brain,
he seized upon it with the precipitation of a drowning man, who distractedly lays hold of the
first object that seems to offer him a means of safety, whether it be a dead branch or a reed.

"Listen," he resumed; "at the very first explanation that we had together, I told you I did
not intend to deprive you of your right to a portion of your natural father's inheritance.
Until now, you have taken my word for it, and we have lived at the chateau like two brothers.
But now that a miserable question of money alone prevents you from marrying the woman you love,
it is important that you should be legally provided for.  We will go to-morrow to Monsieur
Arbillot, and ask him to draw up the deed, making over to you from me one half of the fortune
of Claude de Buxieres.  You will then be, by law, and in the eyes of all, one of the desirable
matches of the canton, and you can demand the hand of Mademoiselle Vincart, without any fear
of being thought presumptuous or mercenary."

Claudet, to whom this conclusion was wholly unexpected, was thunderstruck.  His emotion was
so great that it prevented him from speaking.  In the obscurity of the room his deep-set eyes
seemed larger, and shone with the tears he could not repress.

"Monsieur Julien," said he, falteringly, "I can not find words to thank you.  I am like an
idiot.  And to think that only a little while ago I suspected you of being tired of me, and
regretting your benefits toward me!  What an animal I am!  I measure others by myself.  Well!
can you forgive me?  If I do not express myself well, I feel deeply, and all I can say is that
you have made me very happy!"  He sighed heavily. "The question is now," continued he, "whether
Reine will have me!  You may not believe me, Monsieur de Buxieres, but though I may seem very
bold and resolute, I feel like a wet hen when I get near her.  I have a dreadful panic that
she will send me away as I came.  I don't know whether I can ever find courage to ask her."

"Why should she refuse you?"  said Julien, sadly, "she knows that you love her.  Do you suppose
she loves any one else?"

"That I don't know.  Although Reine is very frank, she does not let every one know what is
passing in her mind, and with these young girls, I tell you, one is never sure of anything.
That is just what I fear may be possible."

"If you fear the ordeal," said de Buxieres, with a visible effort, "would you like me to present
the matter for you?"

"I should be very glad.  It would be doing me a great service.  It would be adding one more
kindness to those I have already received, and some day I hope to make it all up to you."

The next morning, according to agreement, Julien accompanied Claudet to Auberive, where Maitre
Arbillot drew up the deed of gift, and had it at once signed and recorded.  Afterward the young
men adjourned to breakfast at the inn.  The meal was brief and silent.  Neither seemed to have
any appetite.  As soon as they had drunk their coffee, they turned back on the Vivey road;
but, when they had got as far as the great limetree, standing at the entrance to the forest,
Julien touched Claudet lightly on the shoulder.

"Here," said he, "we must part company.  You will return to Vivey, and I shall go across the
fields to La Thuiliere.  I shall return as soon as I have had an interview with Mademoiselle
Vincart.  Wait for me at the chateau."

"The time will seem dreadfully long to me," sighed Claudet; "I shall not know how to dispose
of my body until you return."

"Your affair will be all settled within two or three hours from now. Stay near the window of
my room, and you will catch first sight of me coming along in the distance.  If I wave my hat,
it will be a sign that I bring a favorable answer."

Claudet pressed his hand; they separated, and Julien descended the newly mown meadow, along
which he walked under the shade of trees scattered along the border line of the forest.

The heat of the midday sun was tempered by a breeze from the east, which threw across the fields
and woods the shadows of the white fleecy clouds. The young man, pale and agitated, strode
with feverish haste over the short-cropped grass, while the little brooklet at his side seemed
to murmur a flute-like, soothing accompaniment to the tumultuous beatings of his heart.  He
was both elated and depressed at the prospect of submitting his already torn and lacerated
feelings to so severe a trial. The thought of beholding Reine again, and of sounding her feelings,
gave him a certain amount of cruel enjoyment.  He would speak to her of love-- love for another,
certainly--but he would throw into the declaration he was making, in behalf of another, some
of his own tenderness; he would have the supreme and torturing satisfaction of watching her
countenance, of anticipating her blushes, of gathering the faltering avowal from her lips.
He would once more drink of the intoxication of her beauty, and then he would go and shut himself
up at Vivey, after burying at La Thuiliere all his dreams and profane desires.  But, even while
the courage of this immolation of his youthful love was strong within him, he could not prevent
a dim feeling of hope from crossing his mind. Claudet was not certain that he was beloved;
and possibly Reine's answer would be a refusal.  Then he should have a free field.

By a very human, but very illogical impulse, Julien de Buxieres had hardly concluded the arrangement
with Claudet which was to strike the fatal blow to his own happiness when he began to forestall
the possibilities which the future might have in store for him.  The odor of the wild mint
and meadow-sweet, dotting the banks of the stream, again awoke vague, happy anticipations.
Longing to reach Reine Vincart's presence, he hastened his steps, then stopped suddenly, seized
with an overpowering panic.  He had not seen her since the painful episode in the hut, and
it must have left with her a very sorry impression.  What could he do, if she refused to receive
him or listen to him?

While revolting these conflicting thoughts in his mind, he came to the fields leading directly
to La Thuiliere, and just beyond, across a waving mass of oats and rye, the shining tops of
the farm-buildings came in sight.  A few minutes later, he pushed aside a gate and entered
the yard.

The shutters were closed, the outer gate was closed inside, and the house seemed deserted.
Julien began to think that the young girl he was seeking had gone into the fields with the
farm-hands, and stood uncertain and disappointed in the middle of the courtyard.  At this sudden
intrusion into their domain, a brood of chickens, who had been clucking sedately around, and
picking up nourishment at the same time, scattered screaming in every direction, heads down,
feet sprawling, until by unanimous consent they made a beeline for a half-open door, leading
to the orchard.  Through this manoeuvre, the young man's attention was brought to the fact
that through this opening he could reach the rear facade of the building.  He therefore entered
a grassy lane, winding round a group of stones draped with ivy; and leaving the orchard on
his left, he pushed on toward the garden itself--a real country garden with square beds bordered
by mossy clumps alternating with currant-bushes, rows of raspberry-trees, lettuce and cabbage
beds, beans and runners climbing up their slender supports, and, here and there, bunches of
red carnations and peasant roses.

Suddenly, at the end of a long avenue, he discovered Reine Vincart, seated on the steps before
an arched door, communicating with the kitchen.  A plum-tree, loaded with its violet fruit,
spread its light shadow over the young girl's head, as she sat shelling fresh-gathered peas
and piling the faint green heaps of color around her.  The sound of approaching steps on the
grassy soil caused her to raise her head, but she did not stir.  In his intense emotion, Julien
thought the alley never would come to an end.  He would fain have cleared it with a single
bound, so as to be at once in the presence of Mademoiselle Vincart, whose immovable attitude
rendered his approach still more difficult. Nevertheless, he had to get over the ground somehow
at a reasonable pace, under penalty of making himself ridiculous, and he therefore found plenty
of time to examine Reine, who continued her work with imperturbable gravity, throwing the peas
as she shelled them into an ash-wood pail at her feet.

She was bareheaded, and wore a striped skirt and a white jacket fitted to her waist.  The checkered
shadows cast by the tree made spots of light and darkness over her face and her uncovered neck,
the top button of her camisole being unfastened on account of the heat.  De Buxieres had been
perfectly well recognized by her, but an emotion, at least equal to that experienced by the
young man, had transfixed her to the spot, and a subtle feminine instinct had urged her to
continue her employment, in order to hide the sudden trembling of her fingers.  During the
last month, ever since the adventure in the hut, she had thought often of Julien; and the remembrance
of the audacious kiss which the young de Buxieres had so impetuously stolen from her neck,
invariably brought the flush of shame to her brow.  But, although she was very indignant at
the fiery nature of his caress, as implying a want of respect little in harmony with Julien's
habitual reserve, she was astonished at herself for not being still more angry.  At first,
the affront put upon her had roused a feeling of indignation, but now, when she thought of
it, she felt only a gentle embarrassment, and a soft beating of the heart. She began to reflect
that to have thus broken loose from all restraint before her, this timid youth must have been
carried away by an irresistible burst of passion, and any woman, however high-minded she may
be, will forgive such violent homage rendered to the sovereign power of her beauty.  Besides
his feeding of her vanity, another independent and more powerful motive predisposed her to
indulgence: she felt a tender and secret attraction toward Monsieur de Buxieres.  This healthy
and energetic girl had been fascinated by the delicate charm of a nature so unlike her own
in its sensitiveness and disposition to self-blame. Julien's melancholy blue eyes had, unknown
to himself, exerted a magnetic influence on Reine's dark, liquid orbs, and, without endeavoring
to analyze the sympathy that drew her toward a nature refined and tender even to weakness,
without asking herself where this unreflecting instinct might lead her, she was conscious of
a growing sentiment toward him, which was not very much unlike love itself.

Julien de Buxieres's mood was not sufficiently calm to observe anything, or he would immediately
have perceived the impression that his sudden appearance had produced upon Reine Vincart. 
As soon as he found himself within a few steps of the young girl, he saluted her awkwardly,
and she returned his bow with marked coldness.  Extremely disconcerted at this reception, he
endeavored to excuse himself for having invaded her dwelling in so unceremonious a manner.

"I am all the more troubled," added he, humbly, "that after what has happened, my visit must
appear to you indiscreet, if not improper."

Reine, who had more quickly recovered her self-possession, pretended not to understand the
unwise allusion that had escaped the lips of her visitor.  She rose, pushed away with her foot
the stalks and pods, which encumbered the passage, and replied, very shortly:

"You are excused, Monsieur.  There is no need of an introduction to enter La Thuiliere.  Besides,
I suppose that the motive which has brought you here can only be a proper one."

While thus speaking, she shook her skirt down, and without any affectation buttoned up her
camisole.

"Certainly, Mademoiselle," faltered Julien, "it is a most serious and respectable motive that
causes me to wish for an interview, and--if--I do not disturb you--"

"Not in the least, Monsieur; but, if you wish to speak with me, it is unnecessary for you to
remain standing.  Allow me to fetch you a chair."

She went into the house, leaving the young man overwhelmed with the coolness of his reception;
a few minutes later she reappeared, bringing a chair, which she placed under the tree.  "Sit
here, you will be in the shade."

She seated herself on the same step as before, leaning her back against the wall, and her head
on her hand.

"I am ready to listen to you," she said.

Julien, much less under his own control than she, discovered that his mission was more difficult
than he had imagined it would be; he experienced a singular amount of embarrassment in unfolding
his subject; and was obliged to have recourse to prolonged inquiries concerning the health
of Monsieur Vincart.

"He is still in the same condition," said Reine, "neither better nor worse, and, with the illness
which afflicts him, the best I can hope for is that he may remain in that condition.  But,"
continued she, with a slight inflection of irony; "doubtless it is not for the purpose of inquiring
after my father's health that you have come all the way from Vivey?"

"That is true, Mademoiselle," replied he, coloring.  "What I have to speak to you about is
a very delicate matter.  You will excuse me, therefore, if I am somewhat embarrassed.  I beg
of you, Mademoiselle, to listen to me with indulgence."

"What can he be coming to?"  thought Reine, wondering why he made so many preambles before
beginning.  And, at the same time, her heart began to beat violently.

Julien took the course taken by all timid people after meditating for a long while on the best
way to prepare the young girl for the communication he had taken upon himself to make--he lost
his head and inquired abruptly:

"Mademoiselle Reine, do you not intend to marry?"

Reine started, and gazed at him with a frightened air.

"I!"  exclaimed she, "Oh, I have time enough and I am not in a hurry." Then, dropping her eyes:
"Why do you ask that?"

"Because I know of some one who loves you and who would be glad to marry you."

She became very pale, took up one of the empty pods, twisted it nervously around her finger
without speaking.

"Some one belonging to our neighborhood?"  she faltered, after a few moments' silence.

"Yes; some one whom you know, and who is not a recent arrival here. Some one who possesses,
I believe, sterling qualities sufficient to make a good husband, and means enough to do credit
to the woman who will wed him.  Doubtless you have already guessed to whom I refer?"

She sat motionless, her lips tightly closed, her features rigid, but the nervous twitching
of her fingers as she bent the green stem back and forth, betrayed her inward agitation.

"No; I can not tell," she replied at last, in an almost inaudible voice.

"Truly?"  he exclaimed, with an expression of astonishment, in which was a certain amount of
secret satisfaction; "you can not tell whom I mean? You have never thought of the person of
whom I am speaking in that light?"

"No; who is that person?"

She had raised her eyes toward his, and they shone with a deep, mysterious light.

"It is Claudet Sejournant," replied Julien, very gently; and in an altered tone.

The glow that had illumined the dark orbs of the young girl faded away, her eyelids dropped,
and her countenance became as rigid as before; but Julien did not notice anything.  The words
he had just uttered had cost him too much agony, and he dared not look at his companion, lest
he should behold her joyful surprise, and thereby aggravate his suffering.

"Ah!"  said Reine, coldly, "in that case, why did not Claudet come himself and state his own case?"

"His courage failed him at the last moment--and so--"

"And so," continued she, with sarcastic bitterness of tone, "you took upon yourself to speak
for him?"

"Yes; I promised him I would plead his cause.  I was sure, moreover, that I should not have
much difficulty in gaining the suit.  Claudet has loved you for a long time.  He is good-hearted,
and a fine fellow to look at. And as to worldly advantages, his position is now equal to your
own. I have made over to him, by legal contract, the half of his father's estate.  What answer
am I to take back?"

He spoke with difficulty in broken sentences, without turning his eyes toward Mademoiselle
Vincart.  The silence that followed his last question seemed to him unbearable, and the contrasting
chirping of the noisy grasshoppers, and the buzzing of the flies in the quiet sunny garden,
resounded unpleasantly in his ears.
