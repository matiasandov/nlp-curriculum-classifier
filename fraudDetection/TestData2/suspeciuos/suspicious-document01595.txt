After some discussion with a vetturino, who was to leave next morning, we made a contract with
him for the remainder of the journey, for the rain, which fell in torrents, forbade all thought
of pedestrianism. At five o'clock we rattled out of the gate, and drove by the waning moon
and morning starlight, down the vale of the Clitumnus. As the dawn stole on, I watched eagerly
the features of the scene. Instead of a narrow glen, as my fancy had pictured, we were in a
valley, several miles broad, covered with rich orchards and fertile fields. A glorious range
of mountains bordered it on the north, looking like Alps in their winter garments. A rosy flush
stole over the snow, which kindled with the growing morn, till they shone like clouds that
float in the sunrise. The Clitumnus, beside us, was the purest of streams. The heavy rains
which had fallen, had not soiled in the least its limpid crystal.

When it grew light enough, I looked at our companions for the three days' journey. The two
other inside seats were occupied by a tradesman of Trieste, with his wife and child; an old
soldier, and a young dragoon going to visit his parents after seven years' absence, occupied
the front part. Persons traveling together in a carriage are not long in becoming acquainted--close
companionship soon breeds familiarity. Before night, I had made a fast friend of the young
soldier, learned to bear the perverse humor of the child with as much patience as its father,
and even drawn looks of grim kindness from the crusty old vetturino.

Our mid-day resting place was Spoleto. As there were two hours given us, we took a ramble through
the city, visited the ruins of its Roman theatre and saw the gate erected to commemorate the
victory gained here over Hannibal, which stopped his triumphal march towards Rome. A great
part of the afternoon was spent in ascending among the defiles of Monte Somma, the highest
pass on the road between Ancona and Rome. Assisted by two yoke of oxen we slowly toiled up
through the snow, the mountains on both sides covered with thickets of box and evergreen oaks,
among whose leafy screens the banditti hide themselves. It is not considered dangerous at present,
but as the dragoons who used to patrol this pass have been sent off to Bologna, to keep down
the rebellion, the robbers will probably return to their old haunts again. We saw many suspicious
looking coverts, where they might have hidden.

We slept at Terni and did not see the falls--not exactly on Wordsworth's principle of leaving
Yarrow "unvisited," but because under the circumstances, it was impossible. The vetturino did
not arrive there till after dark; he was to leave before dawn; the distance was five miles,
and the roads very bad. Besides, we had seen falls quite as grand, which needed only a Byron
to make them as renowned--we had been told that those of Tivoli, which we shall see, were equally
fine. The Velino, which we crossed near Terni, was not a large stream--in short, we hunted
as many reasons as we could find, why the falls need not be seen.

Leaving Terni before day, we drove up the long vale towards Narni. The roads were frozen hard;
the ascent becoming more difficult, the vetturino was obliged to stop at a farm-house and get
another pair of horses, with which, and a handsome young contadino as postillion, we reached
Narni in a short time. In climbing the hill, we had a view of the whole valley of Terni, shut
in on all sides by snow-crested Appenines, and threaded by the Nar, whose waters flow "with
many windings, through the vale!"

At Otricoli, while dinner was preparing, I walked around the crumbling battlements to look
down into the valley and trace the far windings of the Tiber. In rambling through the crooked
streets, we saw everywhere the remains of the splendor which this place boasted in the days
of Rome. Fragments of fluted pillars stood here and there in the streets; large blocks of marble
covered with sculpture and inscriptions were built into the houses, defaced statues used as
door-ornaments, and the steppingstone to our rude inn, worn every day by the feet of grooms
and vetturini, contained some letters of an inscription which may have recorded the glory of
on emperor.

Traveling with a vetturino, is unquestionably the pleasantest way of seeing Italy. The easy
rate of the journey allows time for becoming well acquainted with the country, and the tourist
is freed from the annoyance of quarrelling with cheating landlords. A translation of our written
contract, will best explain this mode of traveling:

  "CARRIAGE" FOR ROME.

  "Our contract is, to be conducted to Rome for the sum of twenty
  francs each, say 20f. and the buona mano, if we are well
  served. We must have from the vetturino, Giuseppe Nerpiti, supper
  each night, a free chamber with two beds, and fire, until we shall
  arrive at Rome.

  "I, Geronymo Sartarelli, steward of the Inn of the White Cross, at
  Foligno, in testimony of the above contract."

Beyond Otricoli, we passed through some relics of an age anterior to Rome. A few soiled masses
of masonry, black with age, stood along the brow of the mountain, on whose extremity were the
ruins of a castle of the middle ages. We crossed the Tiber on a bridge built by Augustus Cæsar,
and reached Borghetto as the sun was gilding with its last rays the ruined citadel above. As
the carriage with its four horses was toiling slowly up the hill, we got out and walked before,
to gaze on the green meadows of the Tiber.

On descending from Narni, I noticed a high, prominent mountain, whose ridgy back, somewhat
like the profile of a face, reminded me of the Traunstein, in Upper Austria. As we approached,
its form gradually changed, until it stood on the Campagna

    "Like a long-swept wave about to break,
    That on the curl hangs pausing"--

and by that token of a great bard, I recognized Monte Soracte. The dragoon took us by the arms,
and away we scampered over the Campagna, with one of the loveliest sunsets before us, that
ever painted itself on my retina. I cannot portray in words the glory that flooded the whole
western heaven. It was like a sea of melted ruby, amethyst and topaz--deep, dazzling and of
crystal transparency. The color changed in tone every few minutes, till in half an hour it
sank away before the twilight to a belt of deep orange along the west.

We left Civita Castellana before daylight. The sky was red with dawn as we approached Nepi,
and we got out to walk, in the clear, frosty air. A magnificent Roman aqueduct, part of it
a double row of arches, still supplies the town with water. There is a deep ravine, appearing
as if rent in the ground by some convulsion, on the eastern side of the city. A clear stream
that steals through the arches of the aqueduct, falls in a cascade of sixty feet down into
the chasm, sending up constant wreaths of spray through the evergreen foliage that clothes
the rocks. In walking over the desolate Campagna, we saw many deep chambers dug in the earth,
used by the charcoal burners; the air was filled with sulphureous exhalations, very offensive
to the smell, which rose from the ground in many places.

Miles and miles of the dreary waste, covered only with flocks of grazing sheep, were passed,--and
about noon we reached Baccano, a small post station, twenty miles from Rome. A long hill rose
before us, and we sprang out of the carriage and ran ahead, to see Rome from its summit. As
we approached the top, the Campagna spread far before and around us, level and blue as an ocean.
I climbed up a high bank by the roadside, and the whole scene came in view. Perhaps eighteen
miles distant rose the dome of St. Peter's, near the horizon--a small spot on the vast plain.
Beyond it and further east, were the mountains of Albano--on our left Soracte and the Appenines,
and a blue line along the west betrayed the Mediterranean. There was nothing peculiarly beautiful
or sublime in the landscape, but few other scenes on earth combine in one glance such a myriad
of mighty associations, or bewilder the mind with such a crowd of confused emotions.

As we approached Rome, the dragoon, with whom we had been walking all day, became anxious and
impatient. He had not heard from his parents for a long time, and knew not if they were living.
His desire to be at the end of his journey finally became so great, that he hailed a peasant
who was driving by in a light vehicle, left our slow carriage and went out of sight in a gallop.

As we descended to the Tiber in the dusk of evening, the domes and spires of Rome came gradually
into view, St. Peter's standing like a mountain in the midst of them. Crossing the yellow river
by the Ponte Molle, two miles of road, straight as an arrow, lay before us, with the light
of the Porta del Popolo at the end. I felt strangely excited as the old vehicle rumbled through
the arch, and we entered a square with fountains and an obelisk of Egyptian granite in the
centre. Delivering up our passports, we waited until the necessary examinations were made,
and then went forward. Three streets branch out from the square, the middle one of which, leading
directly to the Capitol, is the Corso, the Roman Broadway. Our vetturino chose that to the
left, the Via della Scrofa, leading off towards the bridge of St. Angelo. I looked out the
windows as we drove along, but saw nothing except butcher-shops, grocer-stores, etc.--horrible
objects for a sentimental traveler!

Being emptied out on the pavement at last, our first care was to find rooms; after searching
through many streets, with a coarse old Italian who spoke like an angel, we arrived at a square
where the music of a fountain was heard through the dusk and an obelisk cut out some of the
starlight. At the other end I saw a portico through the darkness, and my heart gave a breathless
bound on recognizing the Pantheon--the matchless temple of Ancient Rome! And now while I am
writing, I hear the gush of the fountain--and if I step to the window, I see the time-worn
but still glorious edifice.

On returning for our baggage, we met the funeral procession of the Princess Altieri. Priests
in white and gold carried flaming torches, and the coffin, covered with a magnificent golden
pall, was borne in a splendid hearse, guarded by four priests. As we were settling our account
with the vetturino, who demanded much more buona mano than we were willing to give, the young
dragoon returned. He was greatly agitated. "I have been at home!" said he, in a voice trembling
with emotion. I was about to ask him further concerning his family, but he kissed and embraced
us warmly and hurriedly, saying he had only come to say "addio!" and to leave us. I stop writing
to ramble through Rome. This city of all cities to me--this dream of my boyhood--giant, god-like,
fallen Rome--is around me, and I revel in a glow of anticipation and exciting thought that
seems to change my whole state of being.

CHAPTER XL.

ROME.

Dec. 29.--One day's walk through Rome--how shall I describe it? The Capitol, the Forum, St.
Peter's, the Coliseum--what few hours' ramble ever took in places so hallowed by poetry, history
and art? It was a golden leaf in my calendar of life. In thinking over it now, and drawing
out the threads of recollection from the varied woof of thought I have woven to-day, I almost
wonder how I dared so much at once; but within reach of them all, how was it possible to wait?
Let me give a sketch of our day's ramble.

Hearing that it was better to visit the ruins by evening or moonlight, (alas! there is no moon
now) we started out to hunt St. Peter's. Going in the direction of the Corso, we passed the
ruined front of the magnificent Temple of Antoninus, now used as the Papal Custom House. We
turned to the right on entering the Corso, expecting to have a view of the city from the hill
at its southern end. It is a magnificent street, lined with palaces and splendid edifices of
every kind, and always filled with crowds of carriages and people. On leaving it, however,
we became bewildered among the narrow streets--passed through a market of vegetables, crowded
with beggars and contadini--threaded many by-ways between dark old buildings--saw one or two
antique fountains and many modern churches, and finally arrived at a hill.

We ascended many steps, and then descending a little towards the other side, saw suddenly below
us the Roman Forum! I knew it at once--and those three Corinthian columns that stood near us--what
could they be but the remains of the temple of Jupiter Stator? We stood on the Capitoline Hill;
at the foot was the Arch of Septimus Severus, brown with age and shattered; near it stood the
majestic front of the Temple of Fortune, its pillars of polished granite glistening in the
sun, as if they had been erected yesterday, while on the left the rank grass was waving from
the arches and mighty walls of the Palace of the Cæsars! In front, ruin upon ruin lined the
way for half a mile, where the Coliseum towered grandly through the blue morning mist, at the
base of the Esquiline Hill!

Good heavens, what a scene! Grandeur, such as the world never saw, once rose through that blue
atmosphere; splendor inconceivable, the spoils of a world, the triumphs of a thousand armies
had passed over that earth; minds which for ages moved the ancient world had thought there,
and words of power and glory, from the lips of immortal men, had been syllabled on that hallowed
air. To call back all this on the very spot, while the wreck of what once was, rose mouldering
and desolate around, aroused a sublimity of thought and feeling too powerful for words.

Returning at hazard through the streets, we came suddenly upon the column of Trajan, standing
in an excavated square below the level of the city, amid a number of broken granite columns,
which formed part of the Forum dedicated to him by Rome, after the conquest of Dacia. The column
is one hundred and thirty-two feet high, entirely covered with bas-reliefs representing his
victories, winding about it in a spiral line to the top. The number of figures is computed
at two thousand five hundred, and they were of such excellence that Raphael used many of them
for his models. They are now much defaced, and the column is surmounted by a statue of some
saint. The inscription on the pedestal has been erased, and the name of Sixtus V. substituted.
Nothing can exceed the ridiculous vanity of the old popes in thus mutilating the finest monuments
of ancient art. You cannot look upon any relic of antiquity in Rome, but your eyes are assailed
by the words "PONTIFEX MAXIMUS," in staring modern letters. Even the magnificent bronzes of
the Pantheon were stripped to make the baldachin under the dome of St. Peter's.

Finding our way back again, we took a fresh start, happily in the right direction, and after
walking some time, came out on the Tiber, at the Bridge of St. Angelo. The river rolled below
in his muddy glory, and in front, on the opposite bank, stood "the pile which Hadrian retired
on high"--now, the Castle of St. Angelo. Knowing that St. Peter's was to he seen from this
bridge, I looked about in search of it. There was only one dome in sight, large and of beautiful
proportions. I said at once, "surely that cannot be St. Peter's!" On looking again, however,
I saw the top of a massive range of building near it, which corresponded so nearly with the
pictures of the Vatican, that I was unwillingly forced to believe the mighty dome was really
before me. I recognized it as one of those we saw from the Capitol, but it appeared so much
smaller when viewed from a greater distance, that I was quite deceived. On considering we were
still three-fourths of a mile from it, and that we could see its minutest parts distinctly,
the illusion was explained.

Going directly down the Borgo Vecchio, towards it, it seemed a long time before we arrived
at the square of St. Peter's; when at length we stood in front with the majestic colonnade
sweeping around--the fountains on each side sending up their showers of silvery spray--the
mighty obelisk of Egyptian granite piercing the sky--and beyond, the great front and dome of
the Cathedral, I confessed my unmingled admiration. It recalled to my mind the grandeur of
ancient Rome, and mighty as her edifices must have been, I doubt if there were many views more
overpowering than this. The façade of St. Peter's seemed close to us, but it was a third of
a mile distant, and the people ascending the steps dwindled to pigmies.

I passed the obelisk, went up the long ascent, crossed the portico, pushed aside the heavy
leathern curtain at the entrance, and stood in the great nave. I need not describe my feelings
at the sight, but I will tell the dimensions, and you may then fancy what they were. Before
me was a marble plain six hundred feet long, and under the cross four hundred and seventeen
feet wide! One hundred and fifty feet above, sprang a glorious arch, dazzling with inlaid gold,
and in the centre of the cross there were four hundred feet of air between me and the top of
the dome! The sunbeam, stealing through the lofty window at one end of the transept, made a
bar of light on the blue air, hazy with incense, one-tenth of a mile long, before it fell on
the mosaics and gilded shrines of the other extremity. The grand cupola alone, including lantern
and cross, is two hundred and eighty-five feet high, or sixty feet higher than the Bunker Hill
Monument, and the four immense pillars on which it rests are each one hundred and thirty-seven
feet in circumference! It seems as if human art had outdone itself in producing this temple--the
grandest which the world ever erected for the worship of the Living God! The awe felt in looking
up at the giant arch of marble and gold, did not humble me; on the contrary, I felt exalted,
ennobled--beings in the form I wore planned the glorious edifice, and it seemed that in godlike
power perseverance, they were indeed but "a little lower than the angels!" I felt that, if
fallen, my race was still mighty and immortal.

The Vatican is only open twice a week, on days which are not festas; most fortunately, to-day
happened to be one of these, and we took a run through its endless halls. The extent and magnificence
of the gallery of sculpture is perfectly amazing. The halls, which are filled to overflowing
with the finest works of ancient art, would, if placed side by side, make a row more than two
miles in length! You enter at once into a hall of marble, with a magnificent arched ceiling,
a third of a mile long; the sides are covered for a great distance with inscriptions of every
kind, divided into compartments according to the era of the empire to which they refer. One
which I examined, appeared to be a kind of index of the roads in Italy, with the towns on them;
and we could decipher on that time-worn block, the very route I had followed from Florence hither.

Then came the statues, and here I am bewildered, how to describe them. Hundreds upon hundreds
of figures--statues of citizens, generals, emperors and gods--fauns, satyrs and nymphs--children,
cupids and tritons--in fact, it seemed inexhaustible. Many of them, too, were forms of matchless
beauty; there were Venuses and nymphs, born of the loftiest dreams of grace; fauns on whose
faces shone the very soul of humor, and heroes and divinities with an air of majesty worthy
the "land of lost gods and godlike men!"

I am lost in astonishment at the perfection of art attained by the Greeks and Romans. There
is scarcely a form of beauty, that has ever met my eye, which is not to be found in this gallery.
I should almost despair of such another blaze of glory on the world, were it not my devout
belief that what has been done may be done again, and had I not faith that the dawn in which
we live will bring another day equally glorious. And why should not America, with the experience
and added wisdom which three thousand years have slowly yielded to the old world, joined to
the giant energy of her youth and freedom, re-bestow on the world the divine creations of art?
Let Powers answer!

But let us step on to the hemicycle of the Belvidere, and view some works greater than any
we have yet seen, or even imagined. The adjoining gallery is filled with masterpieces of sculpture,
but we will keep our eyes unwearied and merely glance along the rows. At length we reach a
circular court with a fountain flinging up its waters in the centre. Before us is an open cabinet;
there is a beautiful, manly form within, but you would not for an instant take it for the Apollo.
By the Gorgon head it holds aloft, we recognize Canova's Perseus--he has copied the form and
attitude of the Apollo, but he could not breathe into it the same warming fire. It seemed to
me particularly lifeless, and I greatly preferred his Boxers, who stand on either side of it.
One, who has drawn back in the attitude of striking, looks as if he could fell an ox with a
single blow of his powerful arm. The other is a more lithe and agile figure, and there is a
quick fire in his countenance which might overbalance the massive strength of his opponent.

Another cabinet--this is the far-famed Antinous. A countenance of perfect Grecian beauty, with
a form such as we would imagine for one of Homer's heroes. His features are in repose, and
there is something in their calm, settled expression, strikingly like life.

Now we look on a scene of the deepest physical agony. Mark how every muscle of old Laocoon's
body is distended to the utmost in the mighty struggle! What intensity of pain in the quivering,
distorted, features! Every nerve, which despair can call into action, is excited in one giant
effort, and a scream of anguish seems just to have quivered on those marble lips. The serpents
have rolled their strangling coils around father and sons, but terror has taken away the strength
of the latter, and they make but feeble resistance. After looking with indifference on the
many casts of this group, I was the more moved by the magnificent original. It deserves all
the admiration that has been heaped upon it.

I absolutely trembled on approaching the cabinet of the Apollo, I had built up in fancy a glorious
ideal, drawn from all that bards have sung or artists have rhapsodized about its divine beauty.
I feared disappointment--I dreaded to have my ideal displaced and my faith in the power of
human genius overthrown by a form less than perfect. However, with a feeling of desperate excitement,
I entered and looked upon it.

Now what shall I say of it? How make you comprehend its immortal beauty? To what shall I liken
its glorious perfection of form, or the fire that imbues the cold marble with the soul of a
god? Not with sculpture, for it stands alone and above all other works of art--nor with men,
for it has a majesty more than human. I gazed on it, lost in wonder and joy--joy that I could,
at last, take into my mind a faultless ideal of godlike, exalted manhood. The figure appears
actually to possess a spirit, and I looked on it, not as on a piece of marble, but a being
of loftier mould, and half expected to see him step forward when the arrow had reached its
mark. I would give worlds to feel one moment the sculptor's mental triumph when his work was
completed; that one exulting thrill must have repaid him for every ill he might have suffered
on earth! With what divine inspiration has he wrought its faultless lines! There is a spirit
in every limb which mere toil could not have given. It must have been caught in those lofty
moments.

    "When each conception was a heavenly guest--a
    ray of immortality--and stood
    star-like, around, until they gathered to a god?"

We ran through a series of halls, roofed with golden stars on a deep blue, midnight sky, and
filled with porphyry vases, black marble gods, and mummies. Some of the statues shone with
the matchless polish they had received from a Theban artisan before Athens was founded, and
are, apparently, as fresh and perfect as when looked upon by the vassals of Sesostris. Notwithstanding
their stiff, rough-hewn limbs, there were some figures of great beauty, and they gave me a
much higher idea of Egyptian sculpture. In an adjoining hall, containing colossal busts of
the gods, is a vase forty-one feet in circumference, of one solid block of red porphyry.

The "Transfiguration" is truly called the first picture in the world. The same glow of inspiration
which created the Belvidere, must have been required to paint the Saviour's aerial form. The
three figures hover above the earth in a blaze of glory, seemingly independent of all material
laws. The terrified Apostles on the mount, and the wondering group below, correspond in the
grandeur of their expression to the awe and majesty of the scene. The only blemish in the sublime
perfection of the picture is the introduction of the two small figures on the left hand; who,
by-the-bye, were Cardinals, inserted there by command. Some travelers say the color is all
lost, but I was agreeably surprised to find it well preserved. It is, undoubtedly, somewhat
imperfect in this respect, as Raphael died before it was entirely finished; but "take it all
in all," you may search the world in vain to find its equal.

January 1, 1846.--New Year's Day in the Eternal City! It will be something to say in after
years, that I have seen one year open in Rome--that, while my distant friends were making up
for the winter without, with good cheer around the merry board, I have walked in sunshine by
the ruins of the Coliseum, watched the orange groves gleaming with golden fruitage in the Farnese
gardens, trodden the daisied meadow around the sepulchre of Caius Cestius, and mused by the
graves of Shelley, Keats and Salvator Rosa! The Palace of the Cassars looked even more mournful
in the pale, slant sunshine, and the yellow Tiber, as he flowed through the "marble wilderness,"
seemed sullenly counting up the long centuries during which degenerate slaves have trodden
his banks. A leaden-colored haze clothed the seven hills, and heavy silence reigned among the
ruins, for all work was prohibited, and the people were gathered in their churches. Rome never
appeared so desolate and melancholy as to-day.

In the morning I climbed the Quirinal Hill, now called Monte Cavallo, from the colossal statues
of Castor and Pollux, with their steeds, supposed to be the work of Phidias and Praxiteles.
They stand on each side of an obelisk of Egyptian granite, beside which a strong stream of
water gushes up into a magnificent bronze basin, found in the old Forum. The statues, entirely
browned by age, are considered masterpieces of Grecian art, and whether or not from the great
masters, show in all their proportions, the conceptions of lofty genius.

We kept on our way between gardens filled with orange groves, whose glowing fruit reminded
me of Mignon's beautiful reminiscence--"Im dunkeln Laub die Gold Orangen glühn!" Rome, although
subject to cold winds from the Appenines, enjoys so mild a climate that oranges and palm trees
grow in the open air, without protection. Daisies and violets bloom the whole winter, in the
meadows of never-fading green. The basilic of the Lateran equals St. Peter's in splendor, though
its size is much smaller. The walls are covered with gorgeous hangings of velvet embroidered
with gold, and before the high altar, which glitters with precious stones, are four pillars
of gilt bronze, said to be those which Augustus made of the spars of Egyptian vessels captured
at the battle of Actium.

We descended the hill to the Coliseum, and passing under the Arch of Constantine, walked along
the ancient triumphal way, at the foot of the Palatine Hill, which is entirely covered with
the ruins of the Cæsars' Palace. A road, rounding its southern base towards the Tiber, brought
us to the Temple of Vesta--a beautiful little relic which has been singularly spared by the
devastations that have overthrown so many mightier fabrics. It is of circular form, surrounded
by nineteen Corinthian columns, thirty-six feet in height; a clumsy tiled roof now takes the
place of the elegant cornice which once gave the crowning charm to its perfect proportions.
Close at hand are the remains of the temple of Fortuna Virilis, of which some Ionic pillars
alone are left, and the house of Cola di Rienzi--the last Tribune of Rome.

As we approached the walls, the sepulchre of Caius Cestius came in sight--a single solid pyramid,
one hundred feet in height. The walls are built against it, and the light apex rises far above
the massive gate beside it, which was erected by Belisarius. But there were other tombs at
hand, for which we had more sympathy than that of the forgotten Roman, and we turned away to
look for the graves of Shelley and Keats.

They lie in the Protestant burying ground, on the side of a mound that slopes gently up to
the old wall of Rome, beside the pyramid of Cestius. The meadow around is still verdant and
sown thick with daisies, and the soft green of the Italian pine mingles with the dark cypress
above the slumberers. Huge aloes grow in the shade, and the sweet bay and bushes of rosemary
make the air fresh and fragrant. There is a solemn, mournful beauty about the place, green
and lonely as it is, beside the tottering walls of ancient Rome, that takes away the gloomy
associations of death, and makes one wish to lie there, too, when his thread shall be spun
to the end.

We found first the simple head-stone of Keats, alone, in the grassy meadow. Its inscription
states that on his death-bed, in the bitterness of his heart, at the malice of his enemies,
be desired these words to be written on his tombstone: "Here lies one whose name was written
in water." Not far from him reposes the son of Shelley.

Shelley himself lies at the top of the shaded slope, in a lonely spot by the wall, surrounded
by tall cypresses. A little hedge of rose and bay surrounds his grave, which bears the simple
inscription--

    "PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY; Cor Cordium."

Glorious, but misguided Shelley! He sleeps calmly now in that silent nook, and the air around
his grave is filled with sighs from those who mourn that the bright, erratic star should have
been blotted out ere it reached the zenith of its mounting fame. I plucked a leaf from the
fragrant bay, as a token of his fame, and a sprig of cypress from the bough that bent lowest
over his grave; and passing between tombs shaded with blooming roses or covered with unwithered
garlands, left the lovely spot.

Amid the excitement of continually changing scenes, I have forgotten to mention our first visit
to the Coliseum. The day after our arrival we set out with two English friends, to see it by
sunset. Passing by the glorious fountain of Trevi, we made our way to the Forum, and from thence
took the road to the Coliseum, lined on both sides with the remains of splendid edifices. The
grass-grown ruins of the Palace of the Cæsars stretched along on our right; on our left we
passed in succession the granite front of the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, the three grand
arches of the Temple of Peace and the ruins of the Temple of Venus and Rome. We went under
the ruined triumphal arch of Titus, with broken friezes representing the taking of Jerusalem,
and the mighty walls of the Coliseum gradually rose before us. They grew in grandeur as we
approached them, and when at length we stood in the centre, with the shattered arches and grassy
walls rising above and beyond one another, far around us, the red light of sunset giving them
a soft and melancholy beauty, I was fain to confess that another form of grandeur had entered
my mind, of which I before knew not.

A majesty like that of nature clothes this wonderful edifice. Walls rise above walls, and arches
above arches, from every side of the grand arena, like a sweep of craggy, pinnacled mountains
around an oval lake. The two outer circles have almost entirely disappeared, torn away by the
rapacious nobles of Rome, during the middle ages, to build their palaces. When entire, and
filled with its hundred thousand spectators, it must have exceeded any pageant which the world
can now produce. No wonder it was said--

    "While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand;
    When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall;
    And when Rome falls, the world!"

--a prediction, which time has not verified. The world is now going forward, prouder than ever,
and though we thank Rome for the legacy she has left us, we would not wish the dust of her
ruin to cumber our path.

While standing in the arena, impressed with the spirit of the scene around me, which grew more
spectral and melancholy as the dusk of evening began to fill up the broken arches, my eye was
assailed by the shrines ranged around the space, doubtless to remove the pollution of paganism.
In the middle stands also a cross, with an inscription, granting an absolution of forty days
to all who kiss it. Now, although a simple cross in the centre might be very appropriate, both
as a token of the heroic devotion of the martyr Telemachus and the triumph of a true religion
over the barbarities of the Past, this congregation of shrines and bloody pictures mars very
much the unity of association so necessary to the perfect enjoyment of any such scene.

We saw the flush of sunset fade behind the Capitoline Hill, and passed homeward by the Forum,
as its shattered pillars were growing solemn and spectral through the twilight. I intend to
visit them often again, and "meditate amongst decay." I begin already to grow attached to their
lonely grandeur. A spirit, almost human, speaks from the desolation, and there is something
in the voiceless oracles it utters, that strikes an answering chord in my own breast.

In the Via de' Pontefici, not far distant from the Borghese Palace, we saw the Mausoleum of
Augustus. It is a large circular structure somewhat after the plan of that of Hadrian, but
on a much smaller scale. The interior has been cleared out, seats erected around the walls,
and the whole is now a summer theatre, for the amusement of the peasantry and tradesmen. What
a commentary on greatness! Harlequin playing his pranks in the tomb of an Emperor, and the
spot which nations approached with reverence, resounding with the mirth of beggars and degraded
vassals!

I visited lately the studio of a young Philadelphian, Mr. W. B. Chambers, who has been here
two or three years. In studying the legacies of art which the old masters left to their country,
he has caught some of the genuine poetic inspiration which warmed them. But he is modest as
talented, and appears to undervalue his works, so long as they do not reach his own mental
ideal. He chooses principally subjects from the Italian peasant-life, which abounds with picturesque
and classic beauty. His pictures of the shepherd boy of the Albruzzi, and the brown maidens
of the Campagna are fine illustrations of this class, and the fidelity with which he copies
nature, is an earnest of his future success.

I was in the studio of Crawford, the sculptor; he has at present nothing finished in the marble.
There were many casts of his former works, which, judging from their appearance in plaster,
must be of no common excellence--for the sculptor can only be justly judged in marble. I saw
some fine bas-reliefs of classical subjects, and an exquisite group of Mercury and Psyche,
but his masterpiece is undoubtedly the Orpheus. There is a spirit in this figure which astonished
me. The face is full of the inspiration of the poet, softened by the lover's tenderness, and
the whole fervor of his soul is expressed in the eagerness with which he gazes forward, on
stepping past the sleeping Cerberus. Crawford is now engaged on the statue of an Indian girl,
pierced by an arrow, and dying. It is a simple and touching figure, and will, I think, be one
of his best works.

We are often amused with the groups in the square of the Pantheon, which we can see from our
chamber-window. Shoemakers and tinkers carry on their business along the sunny side, while
the venders of oranges and roasted chesnuts form a circle around the Egyptian obelisk and fountain.
Across the end of an opposite street we get a glimpse of the vegetable-market, and now and
then the shrill voice of a pedlar makes its nasal solo audible above the confused chorus. As
the beggars choose the Corso, St. Peter's, and the ruins for their principal haunts, we are
now spared the hearing of their lamentations. Every time we go out we are assailed with them.
"Maladetta sia la vostra testa!"--"Curses be upon your head!"--said one whom I passed without
notice. The priests are, however, the greatest beggars. In every church are kept offering boxes,
for the support of the church or some unknown institution; they even go from house to house,
imploring support and assistance in the name of the Virgin and all the saints, while their
bloated, sensual countenances and capacious frames tell of anything but fasts and privations.
Once, as I was sitting among the ruins, I was suddenly startled by a loud, rattling sound;
turning my head, I saw a figure clothed in white from head to foot, with only two small holes
for the eyes. He held in his hand a money-box, on which was a figure of the Virgin, which he
held close to my lips, that I might kiss it. This I declined doing, but dropped a baiocco into
his box, when, making the sign of the cross, he silently disappeared.

Our present lodging (Trattoria del Sole) is a good specimen of an Italian inn for mechanics
and common tradesmen. Passing through the front room, which is an eating-place for the common
people--with a barrel of wine in the corner, and bladders of lard hanging among orange boughs
in the window--we enter a dark court-yard filled with heavy carts, and noisy with the neighing
of horses and singing of grooms, for the stables occupy part of the house. An open staircase,
running all around this hollow square, leads to the second, third, and fourth stories,

On the second story is the dining-room for the better class of travelers, who receive the same
provisions as those below for double the price, and the additional privilege of giving the
waiter two baiocchi. The sleeping apartments are in the fourth story, and are named according
to the fancy of a former landlord, in mottos above each door. Thus, on arriving here, the Triester,
with his wife and child, more fortunate than our first parents, took refuge in "Paradise,"
while we Americans were ushered into the "Chamber of Jove." We have occupied it ever since,
and find a paul (ten cents) apiece cheap enough for a good bed and a window opening on the
Pantheon.

Next to the Coliseum, the baths of Caracalla are the grandest remains of Rome. The building
is a thousand feet square, and its massive walls look as if built by a race of giants. These
Titan remains are covered with green shrubbery, and long, trailing vines sweep over the cornice,
and wave down like tresses from architrave and arch. In some of its grand halls the mosaic
pavement is yet entire. The excavations are still carried on; from the number of statues already
found, this would seem to have been one of the most gorgeous edifices of the olden time.

I have been now several days loitering and sketching among the ruins, and I feel as if I could
willingly wander for months beside these mournful relics, and draw inspiration from the lofty
yet melancholy lore they teach. There is a spirit haunting them, real and undoubted. Every
shattered column, every broken arch and mouldering wall, but calls up more vividly to mind
the glory that has passed away. Each lonely pillar stands as proudly as if it still helped
to bear up the front of a glorious temple, and the air seems scarcely to have ceased vibrating
with the clarions that heralded a conqueror's triumph.

    "--the old majestic trees
    Stand ghost-like in the Cæsar's home,
      As if their conscious roots were set
    In the old graves of giant Rome,
      And drew their sap all kingly yet!"

           *       *       *       *       *

    "There every mouldering stone beneath
      Is broken from some mighty thought,
    And sculptures in the dust still breathe
      The fire with which their lines were wrought,
    And sunder'd arch and plundered tomb
    Still thunder back the echo--'Rome!'"

In Rome there is no need that the imagination be excited to call up thrilling emotion or poetic
reverie--they are forced on the mind by the sublime spirit of the scene. The roused bard might
here pour forth his thoughts in the wildest climaces, and I could believe he felt it all. This
is like the Italy of my dreams--that golden realm whose image has been nearly chased away by
the earthly reality. I expected to find a land of light and beauty, where every step crushed
a flower or displaced a sunbeam--whose very air was poetic inspiration, and whose every scene
filled the soul with romantic feelings. Nothing is left of my picture but the far-off mountains,
robed in the sapphire veil of the Ausonian air, and these ruins, amid whose fallen glory sits
triumphant the spirit of ancient song.

I have seen the flush of morn and eve rest on the Coliseum; I have seen the noon-day sky framed
in its broken loopholes, like plates of polished sapphire; and last night, as the moon has
grown into the zenith, I went to view it with her. Around the Forum all was silent and spectral--a
sentinel challenged us at the Arch of Titus, under which we passed and along the Cæsar's wall,
which lay in black shadow. Dead stillness brooded around the Coliseum; the pale, silvery lustre
streamed through its arches, and over the grassy walls, giving them a look of shadowy grandeur
which day could not bestow. The scene will remain fresh in my memory forever.

CHAPTER XLI.

TIVOLI AND THE ROMAN CAMPAGNA.

Jan. 9.--A few days ago we returned from an excursion to Tivoli, one of the loveliest spots
in Italy. We left the Eternal City by the Gate of San Lorenzo, and twenty minutes walk brought
us to the bare and bleak Campagna, which was spread around us for leagues in every direction.
Here and there a shepherd-boy in his woolly coat, with his flock of browsing sheep, were the
only objects that broke its desert-like monotony.

At the fourth mile we crossed the rapid Anio, the ancient Teverone, formerly the boundary between
Latium and the Sabine dominions, and at the tenth, came upon some fragments of the old Tibertine
way, formed of large irregular blocks of basaltic lava. A short distance further, we saw across
the plain the ruins of the bath of Agrippa, built by the side of the Tartarean Lake. The wind,
blowing from it, bore us an overpowering smell of sulphur; the waters of the little river Solfatara,
which crosses the road, are of a milky blue color, and carry those of the lake into the Anio.
A fragment of the old bridge over it still remains.

Finding the water quite warm, we determined to have a bath. So we ran down the plain, which
was covered with a thick coat of sulphur, and sounded hollow to our tread, till we reached
a convenient place, where we threw off our clothes, and plunged in. The warm wave was delightful
to the skin, but extremely offensive to the smell, and when we came out, our mouths and throats
were filled with the stifling gas.

It was growing dark as we mounted through the narrow streets of Tivoli, but we endeavored to
gain some sight of the renowned beauties of the spot, before going to rest. From a platform
on a brow of the hill, we looked down into the defile, at whose bottom the Anio was roaring,
and caught a sideward glance of the Cascatelles, sending up their spray amid the evergreen
bushes that fringe the rocks. Above the deep glen that curves into the mountain, stands the
beautiful temple of the Sybil--a building of the most perfect and graceful proportion. It crests
the "rocky brow" like a fairy dwelling, and looks all the lovelier for the wild caverns below.
Gazing downward from the bridge, one sees the waters of the Anio tumbling into the picturesque
grotto of the Sirens; around a rugged corner, a cloud of white spray whirls up continually,
while the boom of a cataract rumbles down the glen. All these we marked in the deepening dusk,
and then hunted an albergo.

The shrill-voiced hostess gave us a good supper and clean beds; in return we diverted the people
very much by the relation of our sulphur bath. We were awakened in the night by the wind shaking
the very soul out of our loose casement. I fancied I heard torrents of rain dashing against
the panes, and groaned in bitterness of spirit on thinking of a walk back to Rome in such weather.
When morning came, we found it was only a hurricane of wind which was strong enough to tear
off pieces of the old roofs. I saw some capuchins nearly overturned in crossing the square,
by the wind seizing their white robes.

I had my fingers frozen and my eyes filled with sand, in trying to draw the Sybil's temple,
and therefore left it to join my companions, who had gone down into the glen to see the great
cascade. The Anio bursts out of a cavern in the mountain-side, and like a prisoner giddy with
recovered liberty, reels over the edge of a precipice more than two hundred feet deep. The
bottom is hid in a cloud of boiling spray, that shifts from side to side, and driven by the
wind, sweeps whistling down the narrow pass. It stuns the ear with a perpetual boom, giving
a dash of grandeur to the enrapturing beauty of the scene. I tried a footpath that appeared
to lead down to the Cascatelles, but after advancing some distance along the side of an almost
perpendicular precipice, I came to a corner that looked so dangerous, especially as the wind
was nearly strong enough to carry me off, that it seemed safest to return. We made another
vain attempt to get down, by creeping along the bed of a torrent, filled with briars. The Cascatelles
are formed by that part of the Anio, which is used in the iron works, made out of the ruins
of Mecænas' villa. They gush out from under the ancient arches, and tumble more than a hundred
feet down the precipice, their white waters gleaming out from the dark and feathery foliage.
Not far distant are the remains of the villa of Horace.

We took the road to Frascati, and walked for miles among cane-swamps and over plains covered
with sheep. The people we saw, were most degraded and ferocious-looking, and there were many
I would not willingly meet alone after nightfall. Indeed it is still considered quite unsafe
to venture without the walls of Rome, after dark. The women, with their yellow complexions,
and the bright red blankets they wear folded around the head and shoulders, resemble Indian Squaws.

I lately spent three hours in the Museum of the Capitol, on the summit of the sacred hill.
In the hall of the Gladiator I noticed an exquisite statue of Diana. There is a pure, virgin
grace in the classic outlines of the figure that keeps the eye long upon it. The face is full
of cold, majestic dignity, but it is the ideal of a being to be worshipped, rather than loved.
The Faun of Praxiteles, in the same room, is a glorious work; it is the perfect embodiment
of that wild, merry race the Grecian poets dreamed of. One looks on the Gladiator with a hushed
breath and an awed spirit. He is dying; the blood flows more slowly from the deep wound in
his side; his head is sinking downwards, and the arm that supports his body becomes more and
more nerveless. You feel that a dull mist is coming over his vision, and almost wait to see
his relaxing limbs sink suddenly on his shield. That the rude, barbarian form has a soul, may
be read in his touchingly expressive countenance. It warms the sympathies like reality to look
upon it. Yet how many Romans may have gazed on this work, moved nearly to tears, who have seen
hundreds perish in the arena without a pitying emotion! Why is it that Art has a voice frequently
more powerful than Nature?

How cold it is here! I was forced to run home to-night, nearly at full speed, from the Café
delle Belle Arti through the Corso and the Piazza Colonna, to keep warm. The clear, frosty
moon threw the shadow of the column of Antoninus over me as I passed, and it made me shiver
to look at the thin, falling sheet of the fountain. Winter is winter everywhere, and even the
sun of Italy cannot always scorch his icy wings.

Two days ago we took a ramble outside the walls. Passing the Coliseum and Caracalla's Baths,
we reached the tomb of Scipio, a small sepulchral vault, near the roadside. The ashes of the
warrior were scattered to the winds long ago, and his mausoleum is fast falling to decay. The
old arch over the Appian way is still standing, near the modern Porta San Sebastiano through
which we entered on the far-famed road. Here and there it is quite entire, and we walked over
the stones once worn by the feet of Virgil and Horace and Cicero. After passing the temple
of Romulus--a shapeless and ivy-grown ruin--and walking a mile or more beyond the walls, we
reached the Circus of Caracalla, whose long and shattered walls fill the hollow of one of the
little dells of the Campagna. The original structure must have been of great size and splendor,
but those twin Vandals--Time and Avarice--have stripped away everything but the lofty brick
masses, whose nakedness the pitying ivy strives to cover.

Further, on a gentle slope, is the tomb of "the wealthiest Roman's wife," familiar to every
one through Childe Harold's musings. It is a round, massive tower, faced with large blocks
of marble, and still bearing the name of Cecilia Metella. One side is much ruined, and the
top is overgrown with grass and wild bushes. The wall is about thirty feet thick, so that but
a small round space is left in the interior, which is open to the rain and filled will rubbish.
The echoes pronounced hollowly after us the name of the dead for whom it was built, but they
could tell us nothing of her life's history--

    "How lived, how loved, how died she?"
