DREAMTHORP

It matters not to relate how or when I became a denizen of Dreamthorp; it will be sufficient
to say that I am not a born native, but that I came to reside in it a good while ago now. 
The several towns and villages in which, in my time, I have pitched a tent did not please,
for one obscure reason or another; this one was too large, t'other too small; but when, on
a summer evening about the hour of eight, I first beheld Dreamthorp, with its westward-looking
windows painted by sunset, its children playing in the single straggling street, the mothers
knitting at the open doors, the fathers standing about in long white blouses, chatting or smoking;
the great tower of the ruined castle rising high into the rosy air, with a whole troop of swallows--by
distance made as small as gnats--skimming about its rents and fissures;--when I first beheld
all this, I felt instinctively that my knapsack might be taken off my shoulders, that my tired
feet might wander no more, that at last, on the planet, I had found a home.  From that evening
I have dwelt here, and the only journey I am like now to make, is the very inconsiderable one,
so far at least as distance is concerned, from the house in which I live to the graveyard beside
the ruined castle.  There, with the former inhabitants of the place, I trust to sleep quietly
enough, and nature will draw over our heads her coverlet of green sod, and tenderly tuck us
in, as a mother her sleeping ones, so that no sound from the world shall ever reach us, and
no sorrow trouble us any more.

The village stands far inland; and the streams that trot through the soft green valleys all
about have as little knowledge of the sea as the three-years' child of the storms and passions
of manhood.  The surrounding country is smooth and green, full of undulations; and pleasant
country roads strike through it in every direction, bound for distant towns and villages, yet
in no hurry to reach them.  On these roads the lark in summer is continually heard; nests are
plentiful in the hedges and dry ditches; and on the grassy banks, and at the feet of the bowed
dikes, the blue-eyed speedwell smiles its benison on the passing wayfarer.  On these roads
you may walk for a year and encounter nothing more remarkable than the country cart, troops
of tawny children from the woods, laden with primroses, and at long intervals--for people in
this district live to a ripe age--a black funeral creeping in from some remote hamlet; and
to this last the people reverently doff their hats and stand aside.  Death does not walk about
here often, but when he does, he receives as much respect as the squire himself.  Everything
round one is unhurried, quiet, moss-grown, and orderly.  Season follows in the track of season,
and one year can hardly be distinguished from another.  Time should be measured here by the
silent dial, rather than by the ticking clock, or by the chimes of the church.  Dreamthorp
can boast of a respectable antiquity, and in it the trade of the builder is unknown.   Ever
since I remember, not a single stone has been laid on the top of another.  The castle, inhabited
now by jackdaws and starlings, is old; the chapel which adjoins it is older still; and the
lake behind both, and in which their shadows sleep, is, I suppose, as old as Adam.  A fountain
in the market-place, all mouths and faces and curious arabesques,--as dry, however, as the
castle moat,--has a tradition connected with it; and a great noble riding through the street
one day several hundred years ago, was shot from a window by a man whom he had injured.  The
death of this noble is the chief link which connects the place with authentic history.  The
houses are old, and remote dates may yet be deciphered on the stones above the doors; the apple-trees
are mossed and ancient; countless generations of sparrows have bred in the thatched roofs,
and thereon have chirped out their lives.  In every room of the place men have been born, men
have died.  On Dreamthorp centuries have fallen, and have left no more trace than have last
winter's snowflakes.   This commonplace sequence and flowing on of life is immeasurably affecting.
That winter morning when Charles lost his head in front of the banqueting-hall of his own palace,
the icicles hung from the eaves of the houses here, and the clown kicked the snowballs from
his clouted shoon, and thought but of his supper when, at three o'clock, the red sun set in
the purple mist. On that Sunday in June while Waterloo was going on, the gossips, after morning
service, stood on the country roads discussing agricultural prospects, without the slightest
suspicion that the day passing over their heads would be a famous one in the calendar.  Battles
have been fought, kings have died, history has transacted itself; but, all unheeding and untouched,
Dreamthorp has watched apple-trees redden, and wheat ripen, and smoked its pipe, and quaffed
its mug of beer, and rejoiced over its new-born children, and with proper solemnity carried
its dead to the churchyard.  As I gaze on the village of my adoption I think of many things
very far removed, and seem to get closer to them. The last setting sun that Shakspeare saw
reddened the windows here, and struck warmly on the faces of the hinds coming home from the
fields. The mighty storm that raged while Cromwell lay a-dying made all the oak-woods groan
round about here, and tore the thatch from the very roofs I gaze upon.  When I think of this,
I can almost, so to speak, lay my hand on Shakspeare and on Cromwell.  These poor walls were
contemporaries of both, and I find something affecting in the thought. The mere soil is, of
course, far older than either, but it does not touch one in the same way.  A wall is the creation
of a human hand, the soil is not.

This place suits my whim, and I like it better year after year.  As with everything else, since
I began to love it I find it gradually growing beautiful.  Dreamthorp--a castle, a chapel,
a lake, a straggling strip of gray houses, with a blue film of smoke over all--lies embosomed
in emerald.  Summer, with its daisies, runs up to every cottage door.  From the little height
where I am now sitting, I see it beneath me.  Nothing could be more peaceful.  The wind and
the birds fly over it.  A passing sunbeam makes brilliant a white gable-end, and brings out
the colours of the blossomed apple-tree beyond, and disappears.  I see figures in the street,
but hear them not.  The hands on the church clock seem always pointing to one hour. Time has
fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine.  I make a frame of my fingers, and look at my picture.
On the walls of the next Academy's Exhibition will hang nothing half so beautiful!

My village is, I think, a special favourite of summer's.  Every window-sill in it she touches
with colour and fragrance; everywhere she wakens the drowsy murmurs of the hives; every place
she scents with apple-blossom.  Traces of her hand are to be seen on the weir beside the ruined
mill; and even the canal, along which the barges come and go, has a great white water-lily
asleep on its olive-coloured face. Never was velvet on a monarch's robe so gorgeous as the
green mosses that be-ruff the roofs of farm and cottage, when the sunbeam slants on them and
goes.  The old road out towards the common, and the hoary dikes that might have been built
in the reign of Alfred, have not been forgotten by the generous adorning season; for every
fissure has its mossy cushion, and the old blocks themselves are washed by the loveliest gray-green
lichens in the world, and the large loose stones lying on the ground have gathered to themselves
the peacefulest mossy coverings.  Some of these have not been disturbed for a century. Summer
has adorned my village as gaily, and taken as much pleasure in the task, as the people of old,
when Elizabeth was queen, took in the adornment of the May-pole against a summer festival.
And, just think, not only Dreamthorp, but every English village she has made beautiful after
one fashion or another--making vivid green the hill slope on which straggling white Welsh hamlets
hang right opposite the sea; drowning in apple-blossom the red Sussex ones in the fat valley. Geof
was a good fellow; he really had a great opinion of Oliver Kenwick's talent, and did not hesitate
to say so on occasion. It would never do to play him any unhandsome tricks. The more unsuspicious
he was, the more it behooved Kenwick to guard his interests.
  And in the wonderful night the
moon knows, she hangs--the planet on which so many millions of us fight, and sin, and agonise,
and die--a sphere of glow-worm light.
