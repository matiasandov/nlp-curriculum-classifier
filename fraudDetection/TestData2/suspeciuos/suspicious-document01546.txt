Now I am going to ask some of the older people what the day means to them. There is a young
woman. She is a stenographer. She says, "Thanksgiving means a day away from the office. I am
at the office every day except Sunday, and I do appreciate, now and then, a day that is really
my own." Yonder is a traveling salesman. What does Thanksgiving mean to you? He says, "It means
a day at home. Last year I spent one hundred and sixty-nine nights away from home. I have three
children. I should like to see them every day. There are times when many days pass and I do
not see them. Thanksgiving week I plan to be at home."

There are others I could ask. Each has his answer. But Thanksgiving has a special meaning for
us. It is the Harvest time. I have here an apple. Isn't this a beautiful apple? What color!
Who mixed the paints, who handled the brush to give such color to this apple? God. He, in his
infinite love and wisdom, has provided, through the unfailing laws of nature, for the growth,
sweetness, coloring and beautifying of all the products of the fields. This apple is but one
of many kinds of fruits.

Praise, then, is the great meaning of Thanksgiving. God, our heavenly Father, sends us every
good gift. From his bountiful hand come our daily and nightly mercies. We should praise him
every day. But the day for the united chorus of praise is Thanksgiving.

MEMORY VERSE, Psalm 150: 6

    "Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the
    Lord."

MEMORY HYMN [717]

    "Come, ye thankful people, come."

MARBLES IN THE POCKET

Do you know what a Missionary Box is? Well, I will tell you. It is a box or barrel sent from
a missionary society in a city or town to a missionary family or school on the frontier. The
box contains clothing, bedding, and sometimes toys, dolls and picture books if there are children
at the frontier end of the journey.

In a certain city one Christmas season the children of the Sunday School brought gifts to fill
a box. Some brought clothes they had outgrown. Some who had two coats decided they could give
one. Others brought books. One little girl brought a beautiful doll. She had other dolls, and
this one she dearly loved, but she said, "I want some other little girl to be happy, and I
think I can get along without this doll, though I shall miss her dreadfully."

One day the committee came together to sort the gifts and pack the box. One woman picked up
a boy's coat. She felt something, hard in one of the pockets. Another woman said, "Better look
all through those pockets; you can never tell what a boy will use his pockets for." So she
went all through the pockets. In one of them she found a soiled handkerchief tied in a knot.
With much pulling, for it was a hard knot, she loosed the little package, and there she found
five marbles. With the marbles was a note scrawled in a boy's hand--

    "DEAR BOY WHO GETS THIS COAT,

    I have eight marbles. First I put in four for you. Then I put in
    another one. I hope you will like the coat, and the marbles.

    From your friend,

    JOHN MASON."

Now what do you think of that? Isn't it glorious? To give more to the other fellow than you
keep for yourself, especially when that other fellow is some one you have never seen, is Christlike.

MEMORY VERSE, Matthew 7: 12

    "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye
    even so to them."

MEMORY HYMN [411]

    "O Master, let me walk with thee."

THE FIRST MONTH

What month is this? December. It is the first month in the year. "No, no," you say, "December
is the last month." I cannot entirely agree with you. December is last on the calendar but
first in importance. Now you agree with me, do you not?
