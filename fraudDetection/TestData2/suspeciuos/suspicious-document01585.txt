But it was in the more intimate reward of his wife's happiness that Glennard tasted the full
flavor of success. Coming out of conditions so narrow that those he offered her seemed spacious,
she fitted into her new life without any of those manifest efforts at adjustment that are as
sore to a husband's pride as the critical rearrangement of the bridal furniture. She had given
him, instead, the delicate pleasure of watching her expand like a sea-creature restored to
its element, stretching out the atrophied tentacles of girlish vanity and enjoyment to the
rising tide of opportunity. And somehow--in the windowless inner cell of his consciousness
where self-criticism cowered--Glennard's course seemed justified by its merely material success.
How could such a crop of innocent blessedness have sprung from tainted soil?

Now he had the injured sense of a man entrapped into a disadvantageous bargain. He had not
known it would be like this; and a dull anger gathered at his heart. Anger against whom? Against
his wife, for not knowing what he suffered? Against Flamel, for being the unconscious instrument
of his wrong-doing? Or against that mute memory to which his own act had suddenly given a voice
of accusation? Yes, that was it; and his punishment henceforth would be the presence, the unescapable
presence, of the woman he had so persistently evaded. She would always be there now. It was
as though he had married her instead of the other. It was what she had always wanted--to be
with him--and she had gained her point at last....

He sprang up, as though in an impulse of flight.... The sudden movement lifted his wife's lids,
and she asked, in the incurious voice of the woman whose life is enclosed in a magic circle
of prosperity--"Any news?"

"No--none--" he said, roused to a sense of immediate peril. The papers lay scattered at his
feet--what if she were to see them? He stretched his arm to gather them up, but his next thought
showed him the futility of such concealment. The same advertisement would appear every day,
for weeks to come, in every newspaper; how could he prevent her seeing it? He could not always
be hiding the papers from her.... Well, and what if she did see it? It would signify nothing
to her, the chances were that she would never even read the book.... As she ceased to be an
element of fear in his calculations the distance between them seemed to lessen and he took
her again, as it were, into the circle of his conjugal protection.... Yet a moment before he
had almost hated her!... He laughed aloud at his senseless terrors.... He was off his balance,
decidedly.

"What are you laughing at?" she asked.

He explained, elaborately, that he was laughing at the recollection of an old woman in the
train, an old woman with a lot of bundles, who couldn't find her ticket.... But somehow, in
the telling, the humor of the story seemed to evaporate, and he felt the conventionality of
her smile. He glanced at his watch, "Isn't it time to dress?"

She rose with serene reluctance. "It's a pity to go in. The garden looks so lovely."

They lingered side by side, surveying their domain. There was not space in it, at this hour,
for the shadow of the elm-tree in the angle of the hedge; it crossed the lawn, cut the flower-border
in two, and ran up the side of the house to the nursery window. She bent to flick a caterpillar
from the honey-suckle; then, as they turned indoors, "If we mean to go on the yacht next Sunday,"
she suggested, "oughtn't you to let Mr. Flamel know?"

Glennard's exasperation deflected suddenly. "Of course I shall let him know. You always seem
to imply that I'm going to do something rude to Flamel."

The words reverberated through her silence; she had a way of thus leaving one space in which
to contemplate one's folly at arm's length. Glennard turned on his heel and went upstairs.
As he dropped into a chair before his dressing-table he said to himself that in the last hour
he had sounded the depths of his humiliation and that the lowest dregs of it, the very bottom-slime,
was the hateful necessity of having always, as long as the two men lived, to be civil to Barton
Flamel.

VI

THE week in town had been sultry, and the men, in the Sunday emancipation of white flannel
and duck, filled the deck-chairs of the yacht with their outstretched apathy, following, through
a mist of cigarette-smoke, the flitting inconsequences of the women. The part was a small one--Flamel
had few intimate friends--but composed of more heterogeneous atoms than the little pools into
which society usually runs. The reaction from the chief episode of his earlier life had bred
in Glennard an uneasy distaste for any kind of personal saliency. Cleverness was useful in
business; but in society it seemed to him as futile as the sham cascades formed by a stream
that might have been used to drive a mill. He liked the collective point of view that goes
with the civilized uniformity of dress-clothes, and his wife's attitude implied the same preference;
yet they found themselves slipping more and more into Flamel's intimacy. Alexa had once or
twice said that she enjoyed meeting clever people; but her enjoyment took the negative form
of a smiling receptivity; and Glennard felt a growing preference for the kind of people who
have their thinking done for them by the community.

Still, the deck of the yacht was a pleasant refuge from the heat on shore, and his wife's profile,
serenely projected against the changing blue, lay on his retina like a cool hand on the nerves.
He had never been more impressed by the kind of absoluteness that lifted her beauty above the
transient effects of other women, making the most harmonious face seem an accidental collocation
of features.

The ladies who directly suggested this comparison were of a kind accustomed to take similar
risks with more gratifying results. Mrs. Armiger had in fact long been the triumphant alternative
of those who couldn't "see" Alexa Glennard's looks; and Mrs. Touchett's claims to consideration
were founded on that distribution of effects which is the wonder of those who admire a highly
cultivated country. The third lady of the trio which Glennard's fancy had put to such unflattering
uses, was bound by circumstances to support the claims of the other two. This was Mrs. Dresham,
the wife of the editor of the Radiator. Mrs. Dresham was a lady who had rescued herself from
social obscurity by assuming the role of her husband's exponent and interpreter; and Dresham's
leisure being devoted to the cultivation of remarkable women, his wife's attitude committed
her to the public celebration of their remarkableness. For the conceivable tedium of this duty,
Mrs. Dresham was repaid by the fact that there were people who took HER for a remarkable woman;
and who in turn probably purchased similar distinction with the small change of her reflected
importance. As to the other ladies of the party, they were simply the wives of some of the
men--the kind of women who expect to be talked to collectively and to have their questions
left unanswered.

Mrs. Armiger, the latest embodiment of Dresham's instinct for the remarkable, was an innocent
beauty who for years had distilled dulness among a set of people now self-condemned by their
inability to appreciate her. Under Dresham's tutelage she had developed into a "thoughtful
woman," who read his leaders in the Radiator and bought the books he recommended. When a new
novel appeared, people wanted to know what Mrs. Armiger thought of it; and a young gentleman
who had made a trip in Touraine had recently inscribed to her the wide-margined result of his
explorations.

Glennard, leaning back with his head against the rail and a slit of fugitive blue between his
half-closed lids, vaguely wished she wouldn't spoil the afternoon by making people talk; though
he reduced his annoyance to the minimum by not listening to what was said, there remained a
latent irritation against the general futility of words.

His wife's gift of silence seemed to him the most vivid commentary on the clumsiness of speech
as a means of intercourse, and his eyes had turned to her in renewed appreciation of this finer
faculty when Mrs. Armiger's voice abruptly brought home to him the underrated potentialities
of language.

"You've read them, of course, Mrs. Glennard?" he heard her ask; and, in reply to Alexa's vague
interrogation--"Why, the 'Aubyn Letters'--it's the only book people are talking of this week."

Mrs. Dresham immediately saw her advantage. "You HAVEN'T read them? How very extraordinary!
As Mrs. Armiger says, the book's in the air; one breathes it in like the influenza."

Glennard sat motionless, watching his wife.

"Perhaps it hasn't reached the suburbs yet," she said, with her unruffled smile.

"Oh, DO let me come to you, then!" Mrs. Touchett cried; "anything for a change of air! I'm
positively sick of the book and I can't put it down. Can't you sail us beyond its reach, Mr.
Flamel?"

Flamel shook his head. "Not even with this breeze. Literature travels faster than steam nowadays.
And the worst of it is that we can't any of us give up reading; it's as insidious as a vice
and as tiresome as a virtue."

"I believe it IS a vice, almost, to read such a book as the 'Letters,'" said Mrs. Touchett.
"It's the woman's soul, absolutely torn up by the roots--her whole self laid bare; and to a
man who evidently didn't care; who couldn't have cared. I don't mean to read another line;
it's too much like listening at a keyhole."

"But if she wanted it published?"

"Wanted it? How do we know she did?"

"Why, I heard she'd left the letters to the man--whoever he is--with directions that they should
be published after his death--"

"I don't believe it," Mrs. Touchett declared.

"He's dead then, is he?" one of the men asked.

"Why, you don't suppose if he were alive he could ever hold up his head again, with these letters
being read by everybody?" Mrs. Touchett protested. "It must have been horrible enough to know
they'd been written to him; but to publish them! No man could have done it and no woman could
have told him to--"

"Oh, come, come," Dresham judicially interposed; "after all, they're not love-letters."

"No--that's the worst of it; they're unloved letters," Mrs. Touchett retorted.

"Then, obviously, she needn't have written them; whereas the man, poor devil, could hardly
help receiving them."

"Perhaps he counted on the public to save him the trouble of reading them," said young Hartly,
who was in the cynical stage.

Mrs. Armiger turned her reproachful loveliness to Dresham. "From the way you defend him, I
believe you know who he is."

Everyone looked at Dresham, and his wife smiled with the superior air of the woman who is in
her husband's professional secrets. Dresham shrugged his shoulders.

"What have I said to defend him?"

"You called him a poor devil--you pitied him."

"A man who could let Margaret Aubyn write to him in that way? Of course I pity him."

"Then you MUST know who he is," cried Mrs. Armiger, with a triumphant air of penetration.

Hartly and Flamel laughed and Dresham shook his head. "No one knows; not even the publishers;
so they tell me at least."

"So they tell you to tell us," Hartly astutely amended; and Mrs. Armiger added, with the appearance
of carrying the argument a point farther, "But even if HE'S dead and SHE'S dead, somebody must
have given the letters to the publishers."

"A little bird, probably," said Dresham, smiling indulgently on her deduction.

"A little bird of prey then--a vulture, I should say--" another man interpolated.

"Oh, I'm not with you there," said Dresham, easily. "Those letters belonged to the public."

"How can any letters belong to the public that weren't written to the public?" Mrs. Touchett
interposed.

"Well, these were, in a sense. A personality as big as Margaret Aubyn's belongs to the world.
Such a mind is part of the general fund of thought. It's the penalty of greatness--one becomes
a monument historique. Posterity pays the cost of keeping one up, but on condition that one
is always open to the public."

"I don't see that that exonerates the man who gives up the keys of the sanctuary, as it were."

"Who WAS he?" another voice inquired.

"Who was he? Oh, nobody, I fancy--the letter-box, the slit in the wall through which the letters
passed to posterity...."

"But she never meant them for posterity!"

"A woman shouldn't write such letters if she doesn't mean them to be published...."

"She shouldn't write them to such a man!" Mrs. Touchett scornfully corrected.

"I never keep letters," said Mrs. Armiger, under the obvious impression that she was contributing
a valuable point to the discussion.

There was a general laugh, and Flamel, who had not spoken, said, lazily, "You women are too
incurably subjective. I venture to say that most men would see in those letters merely their
immense literary value, their significance as documents. The personal side doesn't count where
there's so much else."

"Oh, we all know you haven't any principles," Mrs. Armiger declared; and Alexa Glennard, lifting
an indolent smile, said: "I shall never write you a love-letter, Mr. Flamel."

Glennard moved away impatiently. Such talk was as tedious as the buzzing of gnats. He wondered
why his wife had wanted to drag him on such a senseless expedition.... He hated Flamel's crowd--and
what business had Flamel himself to interfere in that way, standing up for the publication
of the letters as though Glennard needed his defence?...

Glennard turned his head and saw that Flamel had drawn a seat to Alexa's elbow and was speaking
to her in a low tone. The other groups had scattered, straying in twos along the deck. It came
over Glennard that he should never again be able to see Flamel speaking to his wife without
the sense of sick mistrust that now loosened his joints....

Alexa, the next morning, over their early breakfast, surprised her husband by an unexpected
request.

"Will you bring me those letters from town?" she asked.

"What letters?" he said, putting down his cup. He felt himself as helplessly vulnerable as
a man who is lunged at in the dark.

"Mrs. Aubyn's. The book they were all talking about yesterday."

Glennard, carefully measuring his second cup of tea, said, with deliberation, "I didn't know
you cared about that sort of thing."

She was, in fact, not a great reader, and a new book seldom reached her till it was, so to
speak, on the home stretch; but she replied, with a gentle tenacity, "I think it would interest
me because I read her life last year."

"Her life? Where did you get that?"

"Someone lent it to me when it came out--Mr. Flamel, I think."

His first impulse was to exclaim, "Why the devil do you borrow books of Flamel? I can buy you
all you want--" but he felt himself irresistibly forced into an attitude of smiling compliance.
"Flamel always has the newest books going, hasn't he? You must be careful, by the way, about
returning what he lends you. He's rather crotchety about his library."

"Oh, I'm always very careful," she said, with a touch of competence that struck him; and she
added, as he caught up his hat: "Don't forget the letters."

Why had she asked for the book? Was her sudden wish to see it the result of some hint of Flamel's?
The thought turned Glennard sick, but he preserved sufficient lucidity to tell himself, a moment
later, that his last hope of self-control would be lost if he yielded to the temptation of
seeing a hidden purpose in everything she said and did. How much Flamel guessed, he had no
means of divining; nor could he predicate, from what he knew of the man, to what use his inferences
might be put. The very qualities that had made Flamel a useful adviser made him the most dangerous
of accomplices. Glennard felt himself agrope among alien forces that his own act had set in
motion....

Alexa was a woman of few requirements; but her wishes, even in trifles, had a definiteness
that distinguished them from the fluid impulses of her kind. He knew that, having once asked
for the book, she would not forget it; and he put aside, as an ineffectual expedient, his momentary
idea of applying for it at the circulating library and telling her that all the copies were
out. If the book was to be bought it had better be bought at once. He left his office earlier
than usual and turned in at the first book-shop on his way to the train. The show-window was
stacked with conspicuously lettered volumes. "Margaret Aubyn" flashed back at him in endless
repetition. He plunged into the shop and came on a counter where the name reiterated itself
on row after row of bindings. It seemed to have driven the rest of literature to the back shelves.
He caught up a copy, tossing the money to an astonished clerk who pursued him to the door with
the unheeded offer to wrap up the volumes.

In the street he was seized with a sudden apprehension. What if he were to meet Flamel? The
thought was intolerable. He called a cab and drove straight to the station where, amid the
palm-leaf fans of a perspiring crowd, he waited a long half-hour for his train to start.

He had thrust a volume in either pocket and in the train he dared not draw them out; but the
detested words leaped at him from the folds of the evening paper. The air seemed full of Margaret
Aubyn's name. The motion of the train set it dancing up and down on the page of a magazine
that a man in front of him was reading....

At the door he was told that Mrs. Glennard was still out, and he went upstairs to his room
and dragged the books from his pocket. They lay on the table before him like live things that
he feared to touch.... At length he opened the first volume. A familiar letter sprang out at
him, each word quickened by its glaring garb of type. The little broken phrases fled across
the page like wounded animals in the open.... It was a horrible sight.... A battue of helpless
things driven savagely out of shelter. He had not known it would be like this....

He understood now that, at the moment of selling the letters, he had viewed the transaction
solely as it affected himself: as an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise presentable record.
He had scarcely considered the act in relation to Margaret Aubyn; for death, if it hallows,
also makes innocuous. Glennard's God was a god of the living, of the immediate, the actual,
the tangible; all his days he had lived in the presence of that god, heedless of the divinities
who, below the surface of our deeds and passions, silently forge the fatal weapons of the dead.

VII

A knock roused him and looking up he saw his wife. He met her glance in silence, and she faltered
out, "Are you ill?"

The words restored his self-possession. "Ill? Of course not. They told me you were out and
I came upstairs."

The books lay between them on the table; he wondered when she would see them. She lingered
tentatively on the threshold, with the air of leaving his explanation on his hands. She was
not the kind of woman who could be counted on to fortify an excuse by appearing to dispute it.

"Where have you been?" Glennard asked, moving forward so that he obstructed her vision of the
books.

"I walked over to the Dreshams for tea."

"I can't think what you see in those people," he said with a shrug; adding, uncontrollably--"I
suppose Flamel was there?"

"No; he left on the yacht this morning."

An answer so obstructing to the natural escape of his irritation left Glennard with no momentary
resource but that of strolling impatiently to the window. As her eyes followed him they lit
on the books.

"Ah, you've brought them! I'm so glad," she exclaimed.

He answered over his shoulder, "For a woman who never reads you make the most astounding exceptions!"

Her smile was an exasperating concession to the probability that it had been hot in town or
that something had bothered him.

"Do you mean it's not nice to want to read the book?" she asked. "It was not nice to publish
it, certainly; but after all, I'm not responsible for that, am I?" She paused, and, as he made
no answer, went on, still smiling, "I do read sometimes, you know; and I'm very fond of Margaret
Aubyn's books. I was reading 'Pomegranate Seed' when we first met. Don't you remember? It was
then you told me all about her."

Glennard had turned back into the room and stood staring at his wife. "All about her?" he repeated,
and with the words remembrance came to him. He had found Miss Trent one afternoon with the
novel in her hand, and moved by the lover's fatuous impulse to associate himself in some way
with whatever fills the mind of the beloved, had broken through his habitual silence about
the past. Rewarded by the consciousness of figuring impressively in Miss Trent's imagination
he had gone on from one anecdote to another, reviving dormant details of his old Hillbridge
life, and pasturing his vanity on the eagerness with which she received his reminiscences of
a being already clothed in the impersonality of greatness.

The incident had left no trace in his mind; but it sprang up now like an old enemy, the more
dangerous for having been forgotten. The instinct of self-preservation--sometimes the most
perilous that man can exercise--made him awkwardly declare--"Oh, I used to see her at people's
houses, that was all;" and her silence as usual leaving room for a multiplication of blunders,
he added, with increased indifference, "I simply can't see what you can find to interest you
in such a book."

She seemed to consider this intently. "You've read it, then?"

"I glanced at it--I never read such things."

"Is it true that she didn't wish the letters to be published?"

Glennard felt the sudden dizziness of the mountaineer on a narrow ledge, and with it the sense
that he was lost if he looked more than a step ahead.

"I'm sure I don't know," he said; then, summoning a smile, he passed his hand through her arm.
"I didn't have tea at the Dreshams, you know; won't you give me some now?" he suggested.

That evening Glennard, under pretext of work to be done, shut himself into the small study
opening off the drawing-room. As he gathered up his papers he said to his wife: "You're not
going to sit indoors on such a night as this? I'll join you presently outside."

But she had drawn her armchair to the lamp. "I want to look at my book," she said, taking up
the first volume of the "Letters."

Glennard, with a shrug, withdrew into the study. "I'm going to shut the door; I want to be
quiet," he explained from the threshold; and she nodded without lifting her eyes from the book.

He sank into a chair, staring aimlessly at the outspread papers. How was he to work, while
on the other side of the door she sat with that volume in her hand? The door did not shut her
out--he saw her distinctly, felt her close to him in a contact as painful as the pressure on
a bruise.

The sensation was part of the general strangeness that made him feel like a man waking from
a long sleep to find himself in an unknown country among people of alien tongue. We live in
our own souls as in an unmapped region, a few acres of which we have cleared for our habitation;
while of the nature of those nearest us we know but the boundaries that march with ours. Of
the points in his wife's character not in direct contact with his own, Glennard now discerned
his ignorance; and the baffling sense of her remoteness was intensified by the discovery that,
in one way, she was closer to him than ever before. As one may live for years in happy unconsciousness
of the possession of a sensitive nerve, he had lived beside his wife unaware that her individuality
had become a part of the texture of his life, ineradicable as some growth on a vital organ;
and he now felt himself at once incapable of forecasting her judgment and powerless to evade
its effects.

To escape, the next morning, the confidences of the breakfast-table, he went to town earlier
than usual. But a cunning Fellow personating a Solunarian, and who was in the Plot, gravely answer'd
them thus,

'Look ye, Gentlemen, we own with you that Nature, Reason, Law, Justice,
and Custom of Nations is on your side, and that all Power Derives
from, Centers in, and on all Recesses or Demises of Power returns
to its Great Original the Party Governed: Nay we own our Great Eye
from whom all the habitable Parts of this Globe are inlightned, has
always directed us to practice what Nature thus dictates, always approv'd
and generally succeeded the attempt of Dethroning Tyrants.

But our Case differs, we have always pretended to this absolute undisputed Obedience, which we
did indeed to gain the Power of your Party; and if we should turn round at once to your Opinion,
tho' never so right, we should so fly in the Face of our own Doctrin,
Sermons, innumerable Pamphlets and Pretensions, as would give all
our Enemies too great a Power over us in Argument, and we should never
be able to look Mankind in the Face: But we have laid our Measures
so that by prompting the King to run upon us in all sorts of bare-fac'd
Extreams and Violences, we shall bring him to exasperate the whole
Nation; then we may underhand foment the breach on this side, raise
the Mob upon him, and by acting on both sides seem to suffer a Force
in falling in with the People, and preserve our Reputation.

 As they strolled up the shaded hill, Glennard talked volubly, pointing
out the improvements in the neighborhood, deploring the threatened approach of an electric
railway, and screening himself by a series of reflex adjustments from the imminent risk of
any allusion to the "Letters." Flamel suffered his discourse with the bland inattention that
we accord to the affairs of someone else's suburb, and they reached the shelter of Alexa's
tea-table without a perceptible turn toward the dreaded topic.

The dinner passed off safely. Flamel, always at his best in Alexa's presence, gave her the
kind of attention which is like a beaconing light thrown on the speaker's words: his answers
seemed to bring out a latent significance in her phrases, as the sculptor draws his statue
from the block. Glennard, under his wife's composure, detected a sensibility to this manoeuvre,
and the discovery was like the lightning-flash across a nocturnal landscape. Thus far these
momentary illuminations had served only to reveal the strangeness of the intervening country:
each fresh observation seemed to increase the sum-total of his ignorance. Her simplicity of
outline was more puzzling than a complex surface. One may conceivably work one's way through
a labyrinth; but Alexa's candor was like a snow-covered plain where, the road once lost, there
are no landmarks to travel by.

Dinner over, they returned to the veranda, where a moon, rising behind the old elm, was combining
with that complaisant tree a romantic enlargement of their borders. Glennard had forgotten
the cigars. He went to his study to fetch them, and in passing through the drawing-room he
saw the second volume of the "Letters" lying open on his wife's table. He picked up the book
and looked at the date of the letter she had been reading. It was one of the last... he knew
the few lines by heart. He dropped the book and leaned against the wall. Why had he included
that one among the others? Or was it possible that now they would all seem like that...?

Alexa's voice came suddenly out of the dusk. "May Touchett was right--it IS like listening
at a key-hole. I wish I hadn't read it!"

Flamel returned, in the leisurely tone of the man whose phrases are punctuated by a cigarette,
"It seems so to us, perhaps; but to another generation the book will be a classic."

"Then it ought not to have been published till it had become a classic. It's horrible, it's
degrading almost, to read the secrets of a woman one might have known." She added, in a lower
tone, "Stephen DID know her--"

"Did he?" came from Flamel.

"He knew her very well, at Hillbridge, years ago. The book has made him feel dreadfully...
he wouldn't read it... he didn't want me to read it. I didn't understand at first, but now
I can see how horribly disloyal it must seem to him. It's so much worse to surprise a friend's
secrets than a stranger's."

"Oh, Glennard's such a sensitive chap," Flamel said, easily; and Alexa almost rebukingly rejoined,
"If you'd known her I'm sure you'd feel as he does...."

Glennard stood motionless, overcome by the singular infelicity with which he had contrived
to put Flamel in possession of the two points most damaging to his case: the fact that he had
been a friend of Margaret Aubyn's, and that he had concealed from Alexa his share in the publication
of the letters. To a man of less than Flamel's astuteness it must now be clear to whom the
letters were addressed; and the possibility once suggested, nothing could be easier than to
confirm it by discreet research. An impulse of self-accusal drove Glennard to the window. Why
not anticipate betrayal by telling his wife the truth in Flamel's presence? If the man had
a drop of decent feeling in him, such a course would be the surest means of securing his silence;
and above all, it would rid Glennard of the necessity of defending himself against the perpetual
criticism of his wife's belief in him....

The impulse was strong enough to carry him to the window; but there a reaction of defiance
set in. What had he done, after all, to need defence and explanation? Both Dresham and Flamel
had, in his hearing, declared the publication of the letters to be not only justifiable but
obligatory; and if the disinterestedness of Flamel's verdict might be questioned, Dresham's
at least represented the impartial view of the man of letters. As to Alexa's words, they were
simply the conventional utterance of the "nice" woman on a question already decided for her
by other "nice" women. She had said the proper thing as mechanically as she would have put
on the appropriate gown or written the correct form of dinner-invitation. Glennard had small
faith in the abstract judgments of the other sex; he knew that half the women who were horrified
by the publication of Mrs. Aubyn's letters would have betrayed her secrets without a scruple.

The sudden lowering of his emotional pitch brought a proportionate relief. He told himself
that now the worst was over and things would fall into perspective again. His wife and Flamel
had turned to other topics, and coming out on the veranda, he handed the cigars to Flamel,
saying, cheerfully--and yet he could have sworn they were the last words he meant to utter!--"Look
here, old man, before you go down to Newport you must come out and spend a few days with us--mustn't
he, Alexa?"

VIII

Glennard had, perhaps unconsciously, counted on the continuance of this easier mood. He had
always taken pride in a certain robustness of fibre that enabled him to harden himself against
the inevitable, to convert his failures into the building materials of success. Though it did
not even now occur to him that what he called the inevitable had hitherto been the alternative
he happened to prefer, he was yet obscurely aware that his present difficulty was one not to
be conjured by any affectation of indifference. Some griefs build the soul a spacious house--but
in this misery of Glennard's he could not stand upright. It pressed against him at every turn.
He told himself that this was because there was no escape from the visible evidences of his
act. The "Letters" confronted him everywhere. People who had never opened a book discussed
them with critical reservations; to have read them had become a social obligation in circles
to which literature never penetrates except in a personal guise.

Glennard did himself injustice, it was from the unexpected discovery of his own pettiness that
he chiefly suffered. Our self-esteem is apt to be based on the hypothetical great act we have
never had occasion to perform; and even the most self-scrutinizing modesty credits itself negatively
with a high standard of conduct. Glennard had never thought himself a hero; but he had been
certain that he was incapable of baseness. We all like our wrong-doings to have a becoming
cut, to be made to order, as it were; and Glennard found himself suddenly thrust into a garb
of dishonor surely meant for a meaner figure.

The immediate result of his first weeks of wretchedness was the resolve to go to town for the
winter. He knew that such a course was just beyond the limit of prudence; but it was easy to
allay the fears of Alexa who, scrupulously vigilant in the management of the household, preserved
the American wife's usual aloofness from her husband's business cares. Glennard felt that he
could not trust himself to a winter's solitude with her. He had an unspeakable dread of her
learning the truth about the letters, yet could not be sure of steeling himself against the
suicidal impulse of avowal. His very soul was parched for sympathy; he thirsted for a voice
of pity and comprehension. But would his wife pity? Would she understand? Again he found himself
brought up abruptly against his incredible ignorance of her nature. The fact that he knew well
enough how she would behave in the ordinary emergencies of life, that he could count, in such
contingencies, on the kind of high courage and directness he had always divined in her, made
him the more hopeless of her entering into the torturous psychology of an act that he himself
could no longer explain or understand. It would have been easier had she been more complex,
more feminine--if he could have counted on her imaginative sympathy or her moral obtuseness--but
he was sure of neither. He was sure of nothing but that, for a time, he must avoid her. Glennard
could not rid himself of the delusion that by and by his action would cease to make its consequences
felt. He would not have cared to own to himself that he counted on the dulling of his sensibilities:
he preferred to indulge the vague hypothesis that extraneous circumstances would somehow efface
the blot upon his conscience. In his worst moments of self-abasement he tried to find solace
in the thought that Flamel had sanctioned his course. Flamel, at the outset, must have guessed
to whom the letters were addressed; yet neither then nor afterward had he hesitated to advise
their publication. This thought drew Glennard to him in fitful impulses of friendliness, from
each of which there was a sharper reaction of distrust and aversion. When Flamel was not at
the house, he missed the support of his tacit connivance; when he was there, his presence seemed
the assertion of an intolerable claim.

Early in the winter the Glennards took possession of the little house that was to cost them
almost nothing. The change brought Glennard the immediate relief of seeing less of his wife,
and of being protected, in her presence, by the multiplied preoccupations of town life. Alexa,
who could never appear hurried, showed the smiling abstraction of a pretty woman to whom the
social side of married life has not lost its novelty. Glennard, with the recklessness of a
man fresh from his first financial imprudence, encouraged her in such little extravagances
as her good sense at first resisted. Since they had come to town, he argued, they might as
well enjoy themselves. He took a sympathetic view of the necessity of new gowns, he gave her
a set of furs at Christmas, and before the New Year they had agreed on the obligation of adding
a parlour-maid to their small establishment.

Providence the very next day hastened to justify this measure by placing on Glennard's breakfast-plate
an envelope bearing the name of the publishers to whom he had sold Mrs. Aubyn's letters. It
happened to be the only letter the early post had brought, and he glanced across the table
at his wife, who had come down before him and had probably laid the envelope on his plate.
She was not the woman to ask awkward questions, but he felt the conjecture of her glance, and
he was debating whether to affect surprise at the receipt of the letter, or to pass it off
as a business communication that had strayed to his house, when a check fell from the envelope.
It was the royalty on the first edition of the letters. His first feeling was one of simple
satisfaction. The money had come with such infernal opportuneness that he could not help welcoming
it. Before long, too, there would be more; he knew the book was still selling far beyond the
publisher's previsions. He put the check in his pocket and left the room without looking at
his wife.

On the way to his office the habitual reaction set in. The money he had received was the first
tangible reminder that he was living on the sale of his self-esteem. The thought of material
benefit had been overshadowed by his sense of the intrinsic baseness of making the letters
known; now he saw what an element of sordidness it added to the situation and how the fact
that he needed the money, and must use it, pledged him more irrevocably than ever to the consequences
of his act. It seemed to him, in that first hour of misery, that he had betrayed his friend anew.

When, that afternoon, he reached home earlier than usual, Alexa's drawing-room was full of
a gayety that overflowed to the stairs. Flamel, for a wonder, was not there; but Dresham and
young Hartly, grouped about the tea-table, were receiving with resonant mirth a narrative delivered
in the fluttered staccato that made Mrs. Armiger's conversation like the ejaculations of a
startled aviary.

She paused as Glennard entered, and he had time to notice that his wife, who was busied about
the tea-tray, had not joined in the laughter of the men.

"Oh, go on, go on," young Hartly rapturously groaned; and Mrs. Armiger met Glennard's inquiry
with the deprecating cry that really she didn't see what there was to laugh at. "I'm sure I
feel more like crying. I don't know what I should have done if Alexa hadn't been home to give
me a cup of tea. My nerves are in shreds--yes, another, dear, please--" and as Glennard looked
his perplexity, she went on, after pondering on the selection of a second lump of sugar, "Why,
I've just come from the reading, you know--the reading at the Waldorf."

"I haven't been in town long enough to know anything," said Glennard, taking the cup his wife
handed him. "Who has been reading what?"

"That lovely girl from the South--Georgie--Georgie what's her name--Mrs. Dresham's protegee--unless
she's YOURS, Mr. Dresham! Why, the big ball-room was PACKED, and all the women were crying
like idiots--it was the most harrowing thing I ever heard--"
