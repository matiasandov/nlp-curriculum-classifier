PREFACE

When the publishers asked me to write the Life of Watt, I declined, stating that my thoughts
were upon other matters. This settled the question, as I supposed, but in this I was mistaken.
Why shouldn't I write the Life of the maker of the steam-engine, out of which I had made fortune?
Besides, I knew little of the history of the Steam Engine and of Watt himself, and the surest
way to obtain knowledge was to comply with the publisher's highly complimentary request. In
short, the subject would not down, and finally, I was compelled to write again, telling them
that the idea haunted me, and if they still desired me to undertake it, I should do so with
my heart in the task.

I now know about the steam-engine, and have also had revealed to me one of the finest characters
that ever graced the earth. For all this I am deeply grateful to the publishers.

I am indebted to friends, Messrs. Angus Sinclair and Edward R. Cooper, for editing my notes
upon Scientific and Mechanical points.

The result is this volume. If the public, in reading, have one tithe of the pleasure I have
had in writing it, I shall be amply rewarded.

CHAPTER I

CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH

James Watt, born in Greenock, January 19, 1736, had the advantage, so highly prized in Scotland,
of being of good kith and kin. He had indeed come from a good nest. His great-grandfather,
a stern Covenanter, was killed at Bridge of Dee, September 12, 1644, in one of the battles
which Graham of Claverhouse fought against the Scotch. He was a farmer in Aberdeenshire, and
upon his death the family was driven out of its homestead and forced to leave the district.

Watt's grandfather, Thomas Watt, was born in 1642, and found his way to Crawford's Dyke, then
adjoining, and now part of, Greenock, where he founded a school of mathematics, and taught
this branch, and also that of navigation, to the fishermen and seamen of the locality. That
he succeeded in this field in so little and poor a community is no small tribute to his powers.
He was a man of decided ability and great natural shrewdness, and very soon began to climb,
as such men do. The landlord of the district appointed him his Baron Bailie, an office which
then had important judicial functions. He rose to high position in the town, being Bailie and
Elder, and was highly respected and honored. He subsequently purchased a home in Greenock and
settled there, becoming one of its first citizens. Before his death he had established a considerable
business in odds and ends, such as repairing and provisioning ships; repairing instruments
of navigation, compasses, quadrants, etc., always receiving special attention at his hands.

The sturdy son of a sturdy Covenanter, he refused to take the test in favor of prelacy (1683),
and was therefore proclaimed to be "a disorderly school-master officiating contrary to law."
He continued to teach, however, and a few years later the Kirk Session of Greenock, notwithstanding
his contumacy, found him "blameless in life and conversation," and appointed him an Elder,
which required him to overlook not only religious observances, but the manners and morals of
the people. One of the most important of these duties was to provide for the education of the
young, in pursuance of that invaluable injunction of John Knox, "that no father, of what estate
or condition that ever he may be, use his children at his own fantasie, especially in their
youthhood, but all must be compelled to bring up their children in learning and virtue." Here
we have, at its very birth, the doctrine of compulsory education for all the people, the secret
of Scotland's progress. Great as was the service Knox rendered in the field ecclesiastical,
probably what he did for the cause of public education excels it. The man who proclaimed that
he would never rest until there was a public school in every parish in Scotland must stand
for all time as one of the foremost of her benefactors; probably, in the extent and quality
of the influence he exerted upon the national character through universal compulsory education,
the foremost of all.

The very year after Parliament passed the Act of 1696, which at last fulfilled Knox's aspirations,
and during the Eldership of Watt's grandfather, Greenock made prompt provision for her parish
school, in which we may be sure the old "teacher of mathematics" did not fail to take a prominent
part.

Thomas Watt's son, the father of the great inventor, followed in his father's footsteps, after
his father's death, as shipwright, contractor, provider, etc., becoming famous for his skill
in the making of the most delicate instruments. He built shops at the back of his house, and
such were the demands upon him that he was able to keep a number of men, sometimes as many
as fourteen, constantly at work. Like his father, he became a man of position and influence
in the community, and was universally esteemed. Prosperity attended him until after the birth
of his famous son. The loss of a valuable ship, succeeded by other misfortunes, swept away
most of the considerable sum which he had made, and it was resolved that James would have to
be taught a trade, instead of succeeding to the business, as had been the intention.

Fortunate it was for our subject, and especially so for the world, that he was thus favored
by falling heir to the best heritage of all, as Mr. Morley calls it in his address to the Midland
Institute--"the necessity at an early age to go forth into the world and work for the means
needed for his own support." President Garfield's verdict was to the same effect, "The best
heritage to which a man can be born is poverty." The writer's knowledge of the usual effect
of the heritage of milliondom upon the sons of millionaires leads him fully to concur with
these high authorities, and to believe that it is neither to the rich nor to the noble that
human society has to look for its preservation and improvement, but to those who, like Watt,
have to labor that they may live, and thus make a proper return for what they receive, as working
bees, not drones, in the social hive. Not from palace or castle, but from the cottage have
come, or can come, the needed leaders of our race, under whose guidance it is to ascend.

We have a fine record in the three generations of the Watts, great-grandfather, grandfather
and father, all able and successful men, whose careers were marked by steady progress, growing
in usefulness to their fellows; men of unblemished character, kind and considerate, winning
the confidence and affection of their neighbors, and leaving behind them records unstained.

So much for the male branch of the family tree, but this is only half. What of that of the
grandmothers and mothers of the line--equally important? For what a Scotch boy born to labor
is to become, and how, cannot be forecast until we know what his mother is, who is to him nurse,
servant, governess, teacher and saint, all in one. We must look to the Watt women as carefully
as to the men; and these fortunately we find all that can be desired. His mother was Agnes
Muirhead, a descendant of the Muirheads of Lachop, who date away back before the reign of King
David, 1122. Scott, in his "Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border," gives us the old ballad of
"The Laird of Muirhead," who played a great part in these unsettled days.

The good judgment which characterised the Watts for three generations is nowhere more clearly
shown than in the lady James Watt's father courted and finally succeeded in securing for his
wife. She is described as a gentlewoman of reserved and quiet deportment, "esteemed by her
neighbours for graces of person as well as of mind and heart, and not less distinguished for
her sound sense and good manners than for her cheerful temper and excellent housewifery." Her
likeness is thus drawn, and all that we have read elsewhere concerning her confirms the truth
of the portrait. Williamson says that

    the lady to whom he (Thomas Watt) was early united in marriage
    was Miss Agnes Muirhead, a gentlewoman of good understanding and
    superior endowments, whose excellent management in household
    affairs would seem to have contributed much to the order of her
    establishment, as well as to the every-day happiness of a
    cheerful home. She is described as having been a person above
    common in many respects, of a fine womanly presence, ladylike in
    appearance, affecting in domestic arrangements--according to our
    traditions--what, it would seem was considered for the time,
    rather a superior style of living. What such a style consisted
    in, the reader shall have the means of judging for himself. One
    of the author's informants on such points more than twenty years
    ago, a venerable lady, then in her eighty-fifth year, was wont
    to speak of the worthy Bailie's wife with much characteristic
    interest and animation. As illustrative of what has just been
    remarked of the internal economy of the family, the old lady
    related an occasion on which she had spent an evening, when a
    girl, at Mrs. Watt's house, and remembered expressing with much
    naïveté to her mother, on returning home, her childish
    surprise that "Mrs. Watt had two candles lighted on the
    table!" Among these and other reminiscences of her youth, one
    venerable informant described James Watt's mother, in her
    eloquent and expressive Doric, as, "a braw, braw, woman--none
    now to be seen like her."

There is another account from a neighbor, who also refers to Mrs. Watt as being somewhat of
the grand lady, but always so kind, so sweet, so helpful to all her neighbors.

The Watt family for generations steadily improved and developed. A great step upward was made
the day Agnes Muirhead was captured. We are liable to forget how little of the original strain
of an old family remains in after days. We glance over the record of the Cecils, for instance,
to find that the present Marquis has less than one four-thousandth part of the Cecil blood;
a dozen marriages have each reduced it one-half, and the recent restoration of the family to
its pristine greatness in the person of the late Prime Minister, and in his son, the brilliant
young Parliamentarian, of whom great things are predicted already, is to be credited equally
to the recent infusion into the Cecil family of the entirely new blood of two successive brides,
daughters of commoners who made their own way in the world. One was the mother of the late
statesman, the other his wife and the mother of his sons. So with the Watt family, of which
we have records of three marriages. Our Watt, therefore, had but one-eighth of the original
Watt strain; seven-eighths being that of the three ladies who married into the family. Upon
the entrance of a gentlewoman of Agnes Muirhead's qualities hung important results, for she
was a remarkable character with the indefinable air of distinction, was well educated, had
a very wise head, a very kind heart and all the sensibility and enthusiasm of the Celt, easily
touched to fine issues. She was a Scot of the Scots and a storehouse of border lore, as became
a daughter of her house, Muirhead of Lachop.

Here, then, we have existing in the quiet village of Greenock in 1736, unknown of men, all
the favorable conditions, the ideal soil, from which might be expected to appear such "variation
of species" as contained that rarest of elements, the divine spark we call genius. In due time
the "variation" made its appearance, now known as Watt, the creator of the most potent instrument
of mechanical force known to man.

The fond mother having lost several of her children born previously was intensely solicitous
in her care of James, who was so delicate that regular attendance at school was impossible.
The greater part of his school years he was confined most of the time to his room. This threw
him during most of his early years into his mother's company and tender care. Happy chance!
What teacher, what companionship, to compare with that of such a mother! She taught him to
read most of what he then knew, and, we may be sure, fed him on the poetry and romance upon
which she herself had fed, and for which he became noted in after life. He was rated as a backward
scholar at school, and his education was considered very much neglected.

Let it not be thought, however, that the lad was not being educated in some very important
departments. The young mind was absorbing, though its acquisitions did not count in the school
records. Much is revealed of his musings and inward development in the account of a visit which
he paid to his grandmother Muirhead in Glasgow, when it was thought that a change would benefit
the delicate boy. We read with pleasant surprise that he had to be sent for, at the request
of the family, and taken home. He kept the household so stirred up with his stories, recitations
and continual ebullitions, which so fairly entranced his Grannie and Grandpa and the cousins,
that the whole household economy was disordered. They lost their sleep, for "Jamie" held them
spellbound night after night with his wonderful performances. The shy and contemplative youngster
who had tramped among the hills, reciting the stirring ballads of the border, had found an
admiring tho astonished audience at last, and had let loose upon them.

To the circle at home he was naturally shy and reserved, but to his Grannie, Grandpa, and Cousins,
free from parental restraint, he could freely deliver his soul. His mind was stored with the
legends of his country, its romance and poetry, and, strong Covenanters as were the Watts for
generations, tales of the Martyrs were not wanting. The heather was on fire within Jamie's
breast. But where got you all that perferidum Scotorum, my wee mannie--that store of precious
nutriment that is to become part of yourself and remain in the core of your being to the end,
hallowing and elevating your life with ever-increasing power? Not at the grammar school we
trow. No school but one can instil that, where rules the one best teacher you will ever know,
genius though you be--the school kept at your mother's knee. Such mothers as Watt had are the
appointed trainers of genius, and make men good and great, if the needed spark be there to
enkindle: "Kings they make gods, and meaner subjects kings."

We have another story of Watt's childhood that proclaims the coming man. Precocious children
are said rarely to develop far in later years, but Watt was pre-eminently a precocious child,
and of this several proofs are related. A friend looking at the child of six said to his father,
"You ought to send your boy to a public school, and not allow him to trifle away his time at
home." "Look how he is occupied before you condemn him," said the father. He was trying to
solve a problem in geometry. His mother had taught him drawing, and with this he was captivated.
A few toys were given him, which were constantly in use. Often he took them to pieces, and
out of the parts sometimes constructed new ones, a source of great delight. In this way he
employed and amused himself in the many long days during which he was confined to the house
by ill health.

It is at this stage the steam and kettle story takes its rise. Mrs. Campbell, Watt's cousin
and constant companion, recounts, in her memoranda, written in 1798:

    Sitting one evening with his aunt, Mrs. Muirhead, at the
    tea-table, she said: "James Watt, I never saw such an idle boy;
    take a book or employ yourself usefully; for the last hour you
    have not spoken one word, but taken off the lid of that kettle
    and put it on again, holding now a cup and now a silver spoon
    over the steam, watching how it rises from the spout, and
    catching and connecting the drops of hot water it falls into.
    Are you not ashamed of spending your time in this way?"

To what extent the precocious boy ruminated upon the phenomenon must be left to conjecture.
Enough that the story has a solid foundation upon which we can build. This more than justifies
us in classing it with "Newton and the Apple," "Bruce and the Spider," "Tell and the Apple,"
"Galvani and the Frog," "Volta and the Damp Cloth," "Washington and His Little Hatchet," a
string of gems, amongst the most precious of our legendary possessions. Let no rude iconoclast
attempt to undermine one of them. Even if they never occurred, it matters little. They should
have occurred, for they are too good to lose. We could part with many of the actual characters
of the flesh in history without much loss; banish the imaginary host of the spirit and we were
poor indeed. So with these inspiring legends; let us accept them and add others gladly as they
arise, inquiring not too curiously into their origin.

While Watt was still in boyhood, his wise father not only taught him writing and arithmetic,
but also provided a set of small tools for him in the shop among the workmen--a wise and epoch-making
gift, for young Watt soon revealed such wonderful manual dexterity, and could do such astonishing
things, that the verdict of one of the workmen, "Jamie has a fortune at his finger-ends," became
a common saying among them. The most complicated work seemed to come naturally to him. One
model after another was produced to the wonder and delight of his older fellow-workmen. Jamie
was the pride of the shop, and no doubt of his fond father, who saw with pardonable pride that
his promising son inherited his own traits, and gave bright promise of excelling as a skilled
handicraftsman.

The mechanical dexterity of the Watts, grandfather, father and son, is not to be belittled,
for most of the mechanical inventions have come from those who have been cunning of hand and
have worked as manual laborers, generally in charge of the machinery or devices which they
have improved. When new processes have been invented, these also have usually suggested themselves
to the able workmen as they experienced the crudeness of existing methods. Indeed, few important
inventions have come from those who have not been thus employed. It is with inventors as with
poets; few have been born to the purple or with silver spoons in their mouths, and we shall
plainly see later on that had it not been for Watt's inherited and acquired manual dexterity,
it is probable that the steam engine could never have been perfected, so often did failure
of experiments arise solely because it was in that day impossible to find men capable of executing
the plans of the inventor. His problem was to teach them by example how to obtain the exact
work required when the tools of precision of our day were unknown and the men themselves were
only workmen of the crudest kind. Many of the most delicate parts, even of working engines,
passed through Watt's own hands, and for most of his experimental devices he had himself to
make the models. Never was there an inventor who had such reason to thank fortune that in his
youth he had learned to work with his hands. It proved literally true, as his fellow-workmen
in the shop predicted, that "Jamie's fortune was at his finger-ends."

As before stated, he proved a backward scholar for a time, at the grammar school. No one seems
to have divined the latent powers smoldering within. Latin and Greek classics moved him not,
for his mind was stored with more entrancing classics learned at his mother's knee: his heroes
were of nobler mould than the Greek demigods, and the story of his own romantic land more fruitful
than that of any other of the past. Busy working man has not time to draw his inspiration from
more than one national literature. Nor has any man yet drawn fully from any but that of his
native tongue. We can no more draw our mental sustenance from two languages than we can think
in two. Man can have but one deep source from whence come healing waters, as he can have but
one mother tongue. So it was with Watt. He had Scotland and that sufficed. When the boy absorbs,
or rather is absorbed by, Wallace, The Bruce, and Sir John Grahame, is fired by the story of
the Martyrs, has at heart page after page of the country's ballads, and also, in more recent
times, is at home with Burns' and Scott's prose and poetry, he has little room and less desire,
and still less need, for inferior heroes. So the dead languages and their semi-supernatural,
quarrelsome, self-seeking heroes passed in review without gaining admittance to the soul of
Watt. But the spare that fired him came at last--Mathematics. "Happy is the man who has found
his work," says Carlyle. Watt found his when yet a boy at school. Thereafter never a doubt
existed as to the field of his labors. The choice of an occupation is a serious matter with
most young men. There was never room for any question of choice with young Watt. The occupation
had chosen him, as is the case with genius. "Talent does what it can, genius what it must."
When the goddess lays her hand upon a mortal dedicated to her shrine, concentration is the
inevitable result; there is no room for anything which does not contribute to her service,
or rather all things are made contributory to it, and nothing that the devotee sees or reads,
hears or feels, but some way or other is made to yield sustenance for the one great, overmastering
task. "The gods send thread for a web begun," because the web absorbs everything that comes
within reach. So it proved with Watt.

At fifteen, he had twice carefully read "The Elements of Philosophy" (Gravesend), and had made
numerous chemical experiments, repeating them again and again, until satisfied of their accuracy.
A small electrical machine was one of his productions with which he startled his companions.
Visits to his uncle Muirhead at Glasgow were frequent, and here he formed acquaintance with
several educated young men, who appreciated his abilities and kindly nature; but the visits
to the same kind uncle "on the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond," where the summer months
were spent, gave the youth his happiest days. Indefatigable in habits of observation and research,
and devoted to the lonely hills, he extended his knowledge by long excursions, adding to his
botanical and mineral treasures. Freely entering the cottages of the people, he spent hours
learning their traditions, superstitions, ballads, and all the Celtic lore. He loved nature
in her wildest moods, and was a true child of the mist, brimful of poetry and romance, which
he was ever ready to shower upon his friends. An omniverous reader, in after life he vindicated
his practice of reading every book he found, alleging that he had "never yet read a book or
conversed with a companion without gaining information, instruction or amusement." Scott has
left on record that he never had met and conversed with a man who could not tell him something
he did not know. Watt seems to have resembled Sir Walter, "who spoke to every man he met as
if he were a brother"--as indeed he was--one of the many fine traits of that noble, wholesome
character. These two foremost Scots, each supreme in his sphere, seem to have had many social
traits in common, and both that fine faculty of attracting others.

The only "sport" of the youth was angling, "the most fitting practice for quiet men and lovers
of peace," the "Brothers of the Angle," according to Izaak Walton, "being mostly men of mild
and gentle disposition." From the ruder athletic games of the school he was debarred, not being
robust, and this was a constant source of morbid misery to him, entailing as it did separation
from the other boys. The prosecution of his favorite geometry now occupied his thoughts and
time, and astronomy also became a fascinating study. Long hours were often spent, lying on
his back in a grove near his home, studying the stars by night and the clouds by day.

Watt met his first irreparable loss in 1753, when his mother suddenly died. The relations between
them had been such as are only possible between mother and son. Often had the mother said to
her intimates that she had been enabled to bear the loss of her daughter only by the love and
care of her dutiful son. Home was home no longer for Jamie, and we are not surprised to find
him leaving it soon after she who had been to him the light and leading of his life had passed
out of it.

Watt now reached his seventeenth year. His father's affairs were greatly embarrassed. It was
clearly seen that the two brothers, John and James, had to rely for their support upon their
own unaided efforts. John, the elder, some time before this had taken to the sea and been shipwrecked,
leaving only James at home. Of course, there was no question as to the career he would adopt.
His fortune "lay at his fingers' ends," and accordingly he resolved at once to qualify himself
for the trade of a mathematical instrument maker, the career which led him directly in the
pathway of mathematics and mechanical science, and enabled him to gratify his unquenchable
thirst for knowledge thereof.

Naturally Glasgow was decided upon as the proper place in which to begin, and Watt took up
his abode there with his maternal relatives, the Muirheads, carrying his tools with him.

No mathematical instrument maker was to be found in Glasgow, but Watt entered the service of
a kind of jack-of-all-trades, who called himself an "optician" and sold and mended spectacles,
repaired fiddles, tuned spinets, made fishing-rods and tackle, etc. Watt, as a devoted brother
of the angle, was an adept at dressing trout and salmon flies, and handy at so many things
that he proved most useful to his employer, but there was nothing to be learned by the ambitious
youth.

His most intimate schoolfellow was Andrew Anderson, whose elder brother, John Anderson, was
the well-known Professor of natural philosophy, the first to open classes for the instruction
of working-men in its principles. He bequeathed his property to found an institution for this
purpose, which is now a college of the university. The Professor came to know young Watt through
his brother, and Watt became a frequent visitor at his house. He was given unrestricted access
to the Professor's valuable library, in which he spent many of his evenings.

One of the chief advantages of the public school is the enduring friendships boys form there,
first in importance through their beneficial influence upon character, and, second, as aids
to success in after life. The writer has been impressed by this feature, for great is the number
of instances he has known where the prized working-boy or man in position has been able, as
additional force was required, to say the needed word of recommendation, which gave a start
or a lift upward to a dearly-cherished schoolfellow. It seems a grave mistake for parents not
to educate their sons in the region of home, or in later years in colleges and universities
of their own land, so that early friendships may not be broken, but grow closer with the years.
Watt at all events was fortunate in this respect. His schoolmate, Andrew Anderson, brought
into his life the noted Professor, with all his knowledge, kindness and influence, and opened
to him the kind of library he most needed.

CHAPTER II

GLASGOW TO LONDON--RETURN TO GLASGOW

Through Professor Muirhead, a kinsman of Watt's mother, he was introduced to many others of
the faculty of the university, and, as usual, attracted their attention, especially that of
Dr. Dick, Professor of natural philosophy, who strongly advised him to proceed to London, where
he could receive better instruction than it was possible to obtain in Scotland at that time.
The kind Professor, diviner of latent genius, went so far as to give him a personal introduction,
which proved efficient. How true it is that the worthy, aspiring youth rarely goes unrecognised
or unaided. Men with kind hearts, wise heads, and influence strong to aid, stand ready at every
turn to take modest merit by the hand and give it the only aid needed, opportunity to speak,
through results, for itself. So London was determined upon. Fortunately, a distant relative
of the Watt family, a sea-captain, was about to set forth upon that then long and toilsome
journey. They started from Glasgow June 7, 1755, on horseback, the journey taking twelve days.

The writer's parents often referred to the fact that when the leading linen manufacturer of
Dunfermline was about to take the journey to London--the only man in the town then who ever
did--special prayers were always said in church for his safety.

The member of Parliament in Watt's day from the extreme north of Scotland would have consumed
nearly twice twelve days to reach Westminster. To-day if the capital of the English-speaking
race were in America, which Lord Roseberry says he is willing it should be, if thereby the
union of our English-speaking race were secured, the members of the Great Council from Britain
could reach Washington in seven days, the members from British Columbia and California, upon
the Pacific, in five days, both land and sea routes soon to be much quickened.

Those sanguine prophets who predict the reunion of our race on both sides of the Atlantic can
at least aver that in view of the union of Scotland and England, the element of time required
to traverse distances to and from the capital is no obstacle, since the most distant points
of the new empire, Britain in the east and British Columbia and California in the west, would
be reached in less than one-third the time required to travel from the north of Scotland to
London at the time of the union. Besides, the telegraph to-day binds the parts together, keeping
all citizens informed, and stirring their hearts simultaneously thousands of miles apart--Glasgow
to London, 1755, twelve days; 1905, eight hours. Thus under the genius Steam, tamed and harnessed
by Watt, the world shrinks into a neighborhood, giving some countenance to the dreamers who
may perchance be proclaiming a coming reality. We may continue, therefore, to indulge the hope
of the coming "parliament of man, the federation of the world," or even the older and wider
prophecy of Burns, that, "It's coming yet for a' that, when man to man the world o'er, shall
brithers be for a' that."

There comes to mind that jewel we owe to Plato, which surely ranks as one of the most precious
of all our treasures: "We should lure ourselves as with enchantments, for the hope is great
and the reward is noble." So with this enchanting dream, better than most realities, even if
it be all a dream. Let the dreamers therefore dream on. The world, minus enchanting dreams,
would be commonplace indeed, and let us remember this dream is only dreamable because Watt's
steam engine is a reality.

After his twelve days on horseback, Watt arrived in London, a stranger in a strange land, unknowing
and unknown. But the fates had been kind for, burdened with neither wealth nor rank, this poor
would-be skilled mechanic was to have a fair chance by beginning at the bottom among his fellows,
the sternest yet finest of all schools to call forth and strengthen inherent qualities, and
impel a poor young man to put forth his utmost effort when launched upon the sea of life, where
he must either sink or swim, no bladders being in reserve for him.

Our young hero rose to the occasion and soon proved that, Cæsar-like, he could "stem the waves
with heart of controversy." Thus the rude school of experience calls forth and strengthens
the latent qualities of youth, implants others, and forms the indomitable man, fit to endure
and overcome. Here, for the first time, alone in swarming London, not one relative, not one
friend, not even an acquaintance, except the kind sea-captain, challenged by the cold world
around to do or die, fate called to Watt as it calls to every man who has his own way to make:

    "This is Collingtogle ford,
    And thou must keep thee with thy sword."

When the revelation first rushes upon a youth, hitherto directed by his parents, that, boy
no more, he must act for himself, presto! change! he is a man, he has at last found himself.
The supreme test, which proves the man, can come in all its winnowing force only to those born
to earn their own support by training themselves to be able to render to society services which
command return. This training compels the development of powers which otherwise would probably
lie dormant. Scotch boy as Watt was to the core, with the lowland broad, soft accent, and ignorant
of foreign literature, it is very certain that he then found support in the lessons instilled
at his mother's knee. He had been fed on Wallace and Bruce, and when things looked darkest,
even in very early years, his national hero, Wallace, came to mind, and his struggles against
fearful odds, not for selfish ends, but for his country's independence. Did Wallace give up
the fight, or ever think of giving up? Never! It was death or victory. Bruce and the spider!
Did Bruce falter? Never! Neither would he. "Scots wa hae," "Let us do or die," implanted before
his teens, has pulled many a Scottish boy through the crises of life when all was dark, as
it will pull others yet to come. Altho Burns and Scott had yet to appear, to crystallise Scotland's
characteristics and plant the talismanic words into the hearts of young Scots, Watt had a copious
supply of the national sentiment, to give him the "stout heart for the stye brae," when manhood
arrived. His mother had planted deep in him, and nurtured, precious seed from her Celtic garden,
which was sure to grow and bear good fruit.

We are often met with the question, "What is the best possible safeguard for a young man, who
goes forth from a pure home, to meet the temptations that beset his path?" Various answers
are given, but, speaking that as a Scot, reared as Watt was, the writer believes all the suggested
safeguards combined scarcely weigh as much as preventives against disgracing himself as the
thought that it would not be only himself he would disgrace, but that he would also bring disgrace
upon his family, and would cause father, mother, sister and brother to hang their heads among
their neighbors in secluded village, on far-away moor or in lonely glen. The Scotch have strong
traces of the Chinese and Japanese religious devotion to "the family," and the filial instinct
is intensely strong. The fall of one member is the disgrace of all. Even although Watt's mother
had passed, there remained the venerated father in Greenock, and the letters regularly written
to him, some of which have fortunately been preserved, abundantly prove that, tho far from
home, yet in home and family ties and family duties the young man had his strong tower of defence,
keeping him from "all sense of sin or shame." Watt never gave his father reason for one anxious
thought that he would in any respect discredit the good name of his forbears.

Many London shops were visited, but the rules of the trade, requiring apprentices to serve
for seven years, or, being journeymen, to have served that time, proved an insuperable obstacle
to Watt's being employed. His plan was to fit himself by a year's steady work for return to
Glasgow, there to begin on his own account. He had not seven years to spend learning what he
could learn in one. He would be his own master. Wise young man in this he was. There is not
much outcome in the youth who does not already see himself captain in his dreams, and steers
his barque accordingly, true to the course already laid down, not to be departed from, under
any stress of weather. We see the kind of stuff this young Scotch lad was made of in the tenacity
with which he held to his plan. At last some specimens of his work having seemed very remarkable
to Mr. John Morgan, mathematical instrument maker, Finch Lane, Cornhill, he agreed to give
the conquering young man the desired year's instructions for his services and a premium of
twenty pounds, whereupon the plucky fellow who had kept to his course and made port, wrote
to his father of his success, praising his master "as being of as good character, both for
accuracy in his business, and good morals, as any of his way in London." The order in which
this aspiring young man of the world records the virtues will not be overlooked. He then adds,
"If it had not been for Mr. Short, I could not have got a man in London that would have undertaken
to teach me, as I now find there are not above five or six who could have taught me all I wanted."

Mr. Short was the gentleman to whom Professor Dick's letter of introduction was addressed,
who, no more than the Professor himself, nor Mr. Morgan, could withstand the extraordinary
youth, whom he could not refuse taking into his service--glad to get him no doubt, and delighted
that he was privileged to instruct one so likely to redound to his credit in after years. Thus
Watt made his start in London, the twenty pounds premium being duly remitted from home.

Up to this time, Watt had been a charge on his father, but it was very small, for he lived
in the most frugal style at a cost of only two dollars per week. In one of his letters to his
father he regrets being unable to reduce it below that, knowing that his father's affairs were
not prosperous. He, however, was able to obtain some remunerative work on his own account,
which he did after his day's task was over, and soon made his position secure as a workman.
Specialisation he met with for the first time, and he expresses surprise that "very few here
know any more than how to make a rule, others a pair of dividers, and suchlike." Here we see
that even at that early day division of labor had won its way in London, though yet unknown
in the country. The jack-of-all-trades, the handyman, who can do everything, gives place to
the specialist who confines himself to one thing in which practice makes him perfect. Watt's
mission saved him from this, for to succeed he had to be master, not of one process, but of
all. Hence we find him first making brass scales, parallel-rulers and quadrants. By the end
of one month in this department he was able to finish a Hadley quadrant. From this he proceeded
to azimuth compasses, brass sectors, theodolites, and other delicate instruments. Before his
year was finished he wrote his father that he had made "a brass sector with a French joint,
which is reckoned as nice a piece of framing-work as is in the trade," and expressed the hope
that he would soon now be able to support himself and be no longer a charge upon him.

It is highly probable that this first tool finished by his own hands brought to Watt more unalloyed
pleasure than any of his greater triumphs of later years, just as the first week's wages of
youth, money earned by service rendered, proclaiming coming manhood, brings with it a thrill
and glow of proud satisfaction, compared with which all the millions of later years are as dross.

Writers upon labor, who have never labored, generally make the profound mistake of considering
labor as one solid mass, when the truth is that it contains orders and degrees as distinct
as those in aristocracy. The workman skilled beyond his fellows, who is called upon by his
superintendent to undertake the difficult job in emergencies, ranks high, and probably enjoys
an honorable title, a pet name conferred by his shopmates. Men measure each other as correctly
in the workshop as in the professions, and each has his deserved rank. When the right man is
promoted, they rally round and enable him to perform wonders. Where favoritism or poor judgment
is shown, the reverse occurs, and there is apathy and dissatisfaction, leading to poor results
and serious trouble. The manual worker is as proud of his work, and rightly so, as men are
in other vocations. His life and thought centre in the shop as those of members of Congress
or Parliament centre in the House; and triumph for him in the shop, his world, means exactly
the same to him, and appears not less important to his family and friends than what leadership
is to the public man, or in any of the professions. He has all their pride of profession, and
less vanity than most.

How far this "pride of profession" extends is well illustrated by the Pittsburgh story of the
street scrapers at their noon repast. MacCarthy, recently deceased, was the subject of eulogy,
one going so far as to assert that he was "the best man that ever scraped a hoe on Liberty
Street." To this, one who had aspirations "allowed Mac was a good enough man on plain work,
but around the gas-posts he wasn't worth a cent."

A public character, stopping over night with a friend in the country, the maid-of-all-work
tells her mistress, after the guest departs, "I have read so much about him, never expecting
to see him; little did I think I should have the honor of brushing his boots this morning."
Happy girl in her work, knowing that all service is honorable. Even shoe-blacking, we see,
has its rewards.

A Highland laird and lady, visiting some of their crofters on the moors, are met and escorted
by a delighted wife to her cot. The children and the husband are duly presented. At an opportune
moment the proud wife cannot refrain from informing her visitors that "it was Donald himsel'
the laird had to send for to thatch the pretty golf-house at the Castle. Donald did all that
himsel'," with an admiring glance cast at the embarrassed great man. Donald "sent for by the
laird at the Castle" ranks in Donald's circle and in Donald's own heart with the honor of being
sent for by His Majesty to govern the empire in Mr. Balfour's circle and in Mr. Balfour's own
heart. Ten to one the proud Highland crofter and his circle reap more genuine, unalloyed satisfaction
from the message than the lowland statesman and his circle could reap from his. But it made
Balfour famous, you say. So was Donald made famous, his circle not quite so wide as that of
his colleague--that is all. Donald is as much "uplifted" as the Prime Minister; probably more
so. Thus is human nature ever the same down to the roots. Many distinctions, few differences
in life. We are all kin, members of the one family, playing with different toys.

So deep down into the ranks of labor goes the salt of pride of profession, preventing rot and
keeping all fresh in the main, because on the humblest of the workers there shines the bright
ray of hope of recognition and advancement, progress and success. As long as this vista is
seen stretching before all is well with labor. There will be friction, of course, between capital
and labor, but it will be healthy friction, needed by, and good for, both. There is the higgling
of the market in all business. As long as this valuable quality of honest pride in one's work
exists, and finds deserved recognition, society has nothing to fear from the ranks of labor.
Those who have had most experience with it, and know its qualities and its failings best, have
no fear; on the contrary, they know that at heart labor is sound, and only needs considerate
treatment. The kindly personal attention of the employer will be found far more appreciated
than even a rise in wages.

Enforced confinement and unremitting labor soon told upon Watt's delicate constitution, yet
he persevered with the self-imposed extra work, which brought in a little honest money and
reduced the remittances from home. He caught a severe cold during the winter and was afflicted
by a racking cough and severe rheumatic pains. With his father's sanction, he decided to return
home to recuperate, taking good care however, forehanded as he always proved himself, to secure
some new and valuable tools and a stock of materials to make many others, which "he knew he
must make himself." A few valuable books were not forgotten, among them Bion's work on the
"Construction and Use of Mathematical Instruments"--nothing pertaining to his craft but he
would know. King he would be in that, so everything was made to revolve around it. That was
the foundation upon which he had to build.

To the old home in Scotland our hero's face was now turned in the autumn of 1756, his twentieth
year. His native air, best medicine of all for the invalid exile, soon restored his health,
and to Glasgow he then went, in pursuance of his plan of life early laid down, to begin business
on his own account. He thus became master before he was man. There was not in all Scotland
a mathematical instrument maker, and here was one of the very best begging permission to establish
himself in Glasgow. As in London so in Glasgow, however, the rules of the Guild of Hammermen,
to which it was decided a mathematical instrument maker would belong, if one of such high calling
made his appearance, prevented Watt from entrance if he had not consumed seven years in learning
the trade. He had mastered it in one, and was ready to demonstrate his ability to excel by
any kind of test proposed. Watt had entered in properly by the door of knowledge and experience
of the craft, the only door through which entrance was possible, but he had travelled too quickly;
besides he was "neither the son of a burgess, nor had he served an apprenticeship in the borough,"
and this was conclusive. How the world has travelled onward since those days! and yet our day
is likely to be in as great contrast a hundred and fifty years hence. Protective tariffs between
nations, and probably wars, may then seem as strangely absurd as the hammermen's rules. Even
in 1905 we have still a far road to travel.

Failing in his efforts to establish himself in business, he asked the guild to permit him to
rent and use a small workshop to make experiments, but even this was refused. We are disposed
to wonder at this, but it was in strict accordance with the spirit of the times.

When the sky was darkest, the clouds broke and revealed the university as his guardian angel.
Dr. Dick, Professor of natural philosophy, knowing of Watt's skill from his first start in
Glasgow, had already employed him to repair some mathematical instruments bequeathed to the
university by a Scotch gentleman in the West Indies, and the work had been well done, at a
cost of five pounds--the first contract money ever earned by Watt in Glasgow. Good work always
tells. Ability cannot be kept down forever; if crushed to earth, it rises again. So Watt's
"good work" brought the Professors to his aid, several of whom he had met and impressed most
favorably during its progress. The university charter, gift of the Pope in 1451, gave absolute
authority within the area of its buildings, and the Professors resolved to give our hero shelter
there--the best day's work they ever did. May they ever be remembered for this with feelings
of deepest gratitude. What men these were! The venerable Anderson has already been spoken of;
Adam Smith, who did for the science of economics what Watt did for steam, was one of Watt's
dearest friends; Black, discoverer of latent heat; Robinson, Dick of whom we have spoken, and
others. Such were the world's benefactors, who resolved to take Watt under their protection,
and thus enabled him to do his appointed work. Glorious university, this of Glasgow, protector
and nurse of Watt, probably of all its decisions this has been of the greatest service to man!

There are universities and universities. Glasgow's peculiar claim to regard lies in the perfect
equality of the various schools, the humanities not neglected, the sciences appreciated, neither
accorded precedence. Its scientific Professor, Thompson, now Lord Kelvin, was recently elevated
to the Lord Chancellorship, the highest honor in its power to bestow.

Every important university develops special qualities of its own, for which it is noted. That
of Glasgow is renowned for devotion to the scientific field. What a record is hers! Protector
of Watt, going to extreme measures necessary, not alone to shelter him, but to enable him to
labor within its walls and support himself; first university to establish an engineering school
and professorship of engineering; first to establish a chemical teaching laboratory for students;
first to have a physical laboratory for the exercise and instruction of students in experimental
work; nursery from which came the steam engine of Watt, the discovery of latent heat by its
Professor Black, and the successful operation of telegraph cables by its Professor and present
Lord Chancellor (Lord Kelvin). May the future of Glasgow University copy fair her glorious
past! Her "atmosphere" favors and stimulates steady, fruitful work. At all Scottish, as at
all American universities, we may rejoice that there is always found a large number of the
most distinguished students, who, figuratively speaking, cultivate knowledge upon a little
oatmeal, earning money between terms to pay their way. It is highly probable that a greater
proportion of these will be heard from in later years than of any other class.

American universities have, fortunately, followed the Glasgow model, and are giving more attention
to the hitherto much neglected needs of science, and the practical departments of education,
making themselves real universities, "where any man can study everything worth studying."

A room was assigned to Watt, only about twenty feet square, but it served him as it has done
others since for great work. When the well-known author, Dr. Smiles, visited the room, he found
in it the galvanic apparatus employed by Professor Thompson (Lord Kelvin) for perfecting his
delicate invention which rendered ocean cables effective.

The kind and wise Professors did not stop here. They went pretty far, one cannot but think,
when they took the next step in Watt's behalf, giving him a small room, which could be made
accessible to the public, and this he was at liberty to open as a shop for the sale of his
instruments, for Watt had to make a living by his handiwork. Strange work this for a university,
especially in those days; but our readers, we are sure, will heartily approve the last, as
they have no doubt approved the first action of the faculty in favor of struggling genius.
Business was not prosperous at first with Watt, his instruments proving slow of sale. Of quadrants
he could make three per week with the help of a lad, at a profit of forty shillings, but as
sea-going ships could not then reach Glasgow, few could be sold. A supply was sent to Greenock,
then the port of Glasgow, and sold by his father. He was reduced, as the greatest artists have
often been, to the necessity of making what are known as "pot-boilers." Following the example
of his first master in Glasgow he made spectacles, fiddles, flutes, guitars, and, of course,
flies and fishing-tackle, and, as the record tells, "many dislocated violins, fractured guitars,
fiddles also, if intreated, did he mend with good approbation." Such were his "pot-boilers"
that met the situation.

His friend, Professor Black, who, like Professor Dick, had known of Watt's talent, one day
asked him if he couldn't make an organ for him. By this time, Watt's reputation had begun to
spread, and it finally carried him to the height of passing among his associates as "one who
knew most things and could make anything." Watt knew nothing about organs, but he immediately
undertook the work (1762), and the result was an indisputable success that led to his constructing,
for a mason's lodge in Glasgow, a larger "finger organ," "which elicited the surprise and admiration
of musicians." This extraordinary man improved everything he touched. For his second organ
he devised a number of novelties, a sustained monochord, indicators and regulators of the blast,
means for tuning to any system, contrivances for improving the stops, etc.

Lest we are led into a sad mistake here, let us stop a moment to consider how Watt so easily
accomplished wonders, as if by inspiration. In all history it may be doubted whether success
can be traced more clearly to long and careful preparation than in Watt's case. When we investigate,
for instance, this seeming sleight-of-hand triumph with the organs, we find that upon agreeing
to make the first, Watt immediately devoted himself to a study of the laws of harmony, making
science supplement his lack of the musical ear. As usual, the study was exhaustive. Of course
he found and took for guide the highest authority, a profound, but obscure book by Professor
Smith of Cambridge University, and, mark this, he first made a model of the forthcoming organ.
It is safe to say that there was not then a man in Britain who knew more of the science of
music and was more thoroughly prepared to excel in the art of making organs than the new organ-builder.

When he attacked the problem of steam, as we shall soon see, the same course was followed,
although it involved the mastering of three languages, that he should miss nothing.

We note that the taking of infinite pains, this fore-arming of himself, this knowing of everything
that was to be known, the note of thorough preparation in Watt's career, is ever conspicuous.
The best proof that he was a man of true genius is that he first made himself master of all
knowledge bearing upon his tasks.

Watt could not have been more happily situated. His surroundings were ideal, the resources
of the university were at his disposal, and, being conveniently situated, his workshop soon
became the rendezvous of the faculty. He thus enjoyed the constant intimate companionship of
one of the most distinguished bodies of educated men of science in the world. Glasgow was favored
in her faculty those days as now. Two at least of Watt's closest friends, the discoverer of
latent heat, and the author of the "Wealth of Nations," won enduring fame. Others were eminent.
He did not fail to realise his advantages, and has left several acknowledgments of his debt
to "those who were all much my superiors, I never having attended a college and being then
but a mechanic." His so-called superiors did not quite see it in this light, as they have abundantly
testified, but the modesty of Watt was ever conspicuous all through his life.

Watt led a busy life, the time not spent upon the indispensable "pot-boilers" being fully occupied
in severe studies; chemistry, mathematics and mechanics all received attention. What he was
finally to become no one could so far predict, but his associates expected something great
from one who had so deeply impressed them.

Robison (afterwards Professor of natural history in Edinburgh University), being nearer Watt's
age than the others, became his most intimate friend. His introduction to Watt, in 1758, has
been described by himself. After feasting his eyes on the beautifully finished instruments
in his shop, Robison entered into conversation with him. Expecting to find only a workman,
he was surprised to find a philosopher. Says Robison:

    I had the vanity to think myself a pretty good proficient in my
    favorite study (mathematical and mechanical philosophy), and was
    rather mortified at finding Mr. Watt so much my superior. But
    his own high relish for those things made him pleased with the
    chat of any person who had the same tastes with himself; or his
    innate complaisance made him indulge my curiosity, and even
    encourage my endeavors to form a more intimate acquaintance with
    him. I lounged much about him, and, I doubt not, was frequently
    teasing him. Thus our acquaintance began.

CHAPTER III

CAPTURED BY STEAM

The supreme hour of Watt's life was now about to strike. He had become deeply interested in
the subject of steam, to which Professor Robison had called his attention, Robison being then
in his twentieth year, Watt three years older.

Robison's idea was that steam might be applied to wheel carriages. Watt admitted his ignorance
of steam then. Nevertheless, he made a model of a wheel carriage with two cylinders of tin
plate, but being slightly and inaccurately made, it failed to work satisfactorily. Nothing
more was heard of it. Robison soon thereafter left Glasgow. The demon Steam continued to haunt
Watt. He, who up to this time had never seen even a model of a steam engine, strangely discovered
in his researches that the university actually owned a model of the latest type, the Newcomen
engine, which had been purchased for the use of the natural philosophy class. One wonders how
many of the universities in Britain had been so progressive. That of Glasgow seems to have
recognised at an early day the importance of science, in which department she continues famous.
The coveted and now historical model had been sent to London for repairs. Watt urged its prompt
return and a sum of money was voted for this purpose. Watt was at last completely absorbed
in the subject of steam. He read all that had been written on the subject. Most of the valuable
matter those days was in French and Italian, of which there were no translations. Watt promptly
began to acquire these languages, that he might know all that was to be known. He could not
await the coming of the model, which did not arrive until 1763, and began his own experiments
in 1761. How did he obtain the necessary appliances and apparatus, one asks. The answer is
easy. He made them. Apothecaries' vials were his steam boilers, and hollowed-out canes his
steam-pipes. Numerous experiments followed and much was learnt. Watt's account of these is
appended to the article on "Steam and the Steam Engine" in the "Encyclopædia Britannica," ninth
edition.

Detailed accounts of Watt's numerous experiments, failures, difficulties, disappointments,
and successes, as one after the other obstacles were surmounted, is not within the scope of
this volume, these being all easily accessible to the student, but the general reader may be
interested in the most important of all the triumphs of the indefatigable worker--the keystone
of the arch. The Newcomen model arrived at last and was promptly repaired, but was not successful
when put in operation. Steam enough could not be obtained, although the boiler seemed of ample
capacity. The fire was urged by blowing and more steam generated, and still it would not work;
a few strokes of the piston and the engine stopped. Smiles says that exactly at the point when
ordinary experimentalists would have abandoned the task, Watt became thoroughly aroused. "Every
obstacle," says Professor Robison, "was to him the beginning of a new and serious study, and
I knew he would not quit it until he had either discovered its worthlessness or had made something
of it." The difficulty here was serious. Books were searched in vain. No one had touched it.
A course of independent experiments was essential, and upon this he entered as usual, determined
to find truth at the bottom of the well and to get there in his own way. Here he came upon
the fact which led him to the stupendous result. That fact was the existence of latent heat,
the original discoverer of which was Watt's intimate friend, Professor Black. Watt found that
water converted into steam heated five times its own weight of water to steam heat. He says:

    Being struck with this remarkable fact (effect of latent heat),
    and not understanding the reason of it, I mentioned it to my
    friend, Dr. Black, who then explained to me his doctrine of
    latent heat, which he had taught some time before this period
    (1764); but having myself been occupied with the pursuits of
    business, if I had heard of it I had not attended to it, when I
    thus stumbled upon one of the material facts by which that
    beautiful theory is supported.

Here we have an instance of two men in the same university, discovering latent heat, one wholly
ignorant of the other's doings; fortunately, the later discoverer only too glad to acknowledge
and applaud the original, and, strange to say, going to him to announce the discovery he had
made. Watt of course had no access to the Professor's classes, and some years before the former
stumbled upon the fact, the theory had been announced by Black, but had apparently attracted
little attention. This episode reminds us of the advantages Watt had in his surroundings. He
breathed the very "atmosphere" of scientific and mechanical investigation and invention, and
had at hand not only the standard books, but the living men who could best assist him.

What does latent heat mean? we hear the reader inquire. Let us try to explain it in simple
language. Arago pronounced Black's experiment revealing it as one of the most remarkable in
modern physics. Water passed as an element until Watt found it was a compound. Change its temperature
and it exists in three different states, liquid, solid, and gaseous--water, ice and steam.
Convert water into steam, and pass, say, two pounds of steam into ten pounds of water at freezing
point and the steam would be wholly liquified, i.e., become water again, at 212°, but the whole
ten pounds of freezing water would also be raised to 212° in the process. That is to say two
pounds of steam will convert ten pounds of freezing water into boiling water, so great is the
latent heat set free in the passage of steam to lower temperatures at the moment when the contact
of cold surfaces converts the vapor from the gaseous into the liquid state. This heat is so
thoroughly merged in the compound that the most delicate thermometer cannot detect a variation.
It is undiscoverable by our senses and yet it proves its existence beyond question by its work.
Heat which is obtained by the combustion of coal or wood, lies also in water, to be drawn forth
and utilised in steam. It is apparently a mere question of temperature. The heat lies latent
and dead until we raise the temperature of the water to 212°, and it is turned to vapor. Then
the powerful force is instantly imbued with life and we harness it for our purposes.

The description of latent heat which gave the writer the clearest idea of it, and at the same
time a much-needed reminder of the fact that Watt was the discoverer of the practically constant
and unvarying amount of heat in steam, whatever the pressure, is the following by Mr. Lauder,
a graduate of Glasgow University and pupil of Lord Kelvin, taken from "Watt's Discoveries of
the Properties of Steam."

    It is well to distinguish between the two things, Discovery and
    Invention. The title of Watt the Inventor is world-wide, and is
    so just and striking that there is none to gainsay. But it is
    only to the few that dive deeper that Watt the Discoverer is
    known. When his mind became directed to the possibilities of the
    power of steam, he, following his natural bent, began to
    investigate its properties. The mere inventor would have been
    content with what was already known, and utilised such
    knowledge, as Newcomen had done in his engine. Watt might have
    invented the separate condenser and ranked as a great inventor,
    but the spirit of enquiry was in possession of him, and he had
    to find out all he could about the nature of steam.

    His first discovery was that of latent heat. When communicating
    this to Professor Black he found that his friend had anticipated
    him, and had been teaching it in lectures to his students for
    some years past. His next step was the discovery of the total
    heat of steam, and that this remains practically constant at all
    pressures. Black's fame rests upon his theory of latent heat;
    Watt's fame as the discoverer of the total heat of steam should
    be equally great, and would be no doubt had his rôle of inventor
    not overshadowed all his work.

    This part of Watt's work has been so little known that it is
    almost imperative to-day to give some idea of it to the general
    reader. Suppose you take a flask, such as olive oil is often
    sold in, and fill with cold water. Set it over a lighted lamp,
    put a thermometer in the water, and the temperature will be
    observed to rise steadily till it reaches 212°, where it
    remains, the water boils, and steam is produced freely. Now draw
    the thermometer out of the water, but leaving it still in the
    steam. It remains steady at the same point--212°. Now it
    requires quite a long time and a large amount of heat to convert
    all the water into steam. As the steam goes off at the same
    temperature as the water, it is evident a quantity of heat has
    escaped in the steam, of which the thermometer gives us no
    account. This is latent heat.

    Now, if you blow the steam into cold water instead of allowing
    it to pass into the air, you will find that it heats the water
    six times more than what is due to its indicated temperature. To
    fix your ideas: suppose you take 100 lbs. of water at 60°, and
    blow one pound of steam into it, making 101 lbs., its
    temperature will now be about 72°, a rise of 12°. Return to your
    100 lbs. of water at 60° and add one pound of water at 212° the
    same temperature as the steam you added, and the temperature
    will only be raised about 2°. The one pound of steam heats six
    times more than the one pound of water, both being at the same
    temperature. This is the quantity of latent heat, which means
    simply hidden heat, in steam.

    Proceeding further with the experiment, if, instead of allowing
    the steam to blow into the water, you confine it until it gets
    to some pressure, then blow it into the water, it takes the same
    weight to raise the temperature to the same degree. This means
    that the total heat remains practically the same, no matter at
    what pressure.

    This is James Watt's discovery, and it led him to the use of
    high-pressure steam, used expansively.

Even coal may yet be superseded before it is exhausted, for as eminent an authority as Professor
Pritchett of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has said in a recent address:

    Watt's invention and all it has led to is only a step on the way
    to harnessing the forces of nature to the service of man. Do you
    doubt that other inventions will work changes even more sweeping
    than those which the steam engine has brought?

    Consider a moment. The problem of which Watt solved a part is
    not the problem of inventing a machine, but the problem of using
    and storing the forces of nature which now go to waste. Now to
    us who live on the earth there is only one source of power--the
    sun. Darken the sun and every engine on the earth's surface
    would soon stop, every wheel cease to turn, and all movement
    cease. How prodigal this supply of power is we seldom stop to
    consider. Deducting the atmospheric absorption, it is still true
    that the sun delivers on each square yard of the earth's
    surface, when he is shining, the equivalent of one horse-power
    working continuously. Enough mechanical power goes to waste on
    the college campus to warm and light and supply all the
    manufactories, street railroads and other consumers of
    mechanical power in the city. How to harness this power and to
    store it--that is the problem of the inventor and the engineer
    of the twentieth century, a problem which in good time is sure
    to be solved.

Who shall doubt, after finding this secret source of force in water, that some future Watt
is to discover other sources of power, or perchance succeed in utilising the superabundant
power known to exist in the heat of the sun, or discover the secret of the latent force employed
by nature in animals, which converts chemical energy directly into the dynamic form, giving
much higher efficiencies than any thermo-dynamic machine has to-day or probably ever can have.
Little knew Shakespeare of man's perfect power of motion which utilises all energy! How came
he then to exclaim "What a piece of work is man; how infinite in faculty; in form and moving
how express and admirable"?

Man's "moving" is found more "express and admirable" than that of the most perfect machine
or adaptation of natural forces yet devised. Lord Kelvin says the animal motor more closely
resembles an electro-magnetic engine than a heat engine, but very probably the chemical forces
in animals produce the external mechanical effects through electricity and do not act as a
thermo-dynamic engine.

The wastage of heat energy under present methods is appalling. About 65 per cent. of the heat
energy of coal can be put into the steam boiler, and from this only 15 per cent. of mechanical
power is obtained. Thus about nine-tenths of the original heat in coal is wasted. Proceeding
further and putting mechanical power into electricity, only from 2 to 5 per cent. is turned
into light; or, in other words, from coal to light we get on an average only about one-half
of 1 per cent. of the original energy, a wastage of ninety-nine and one-half of every hundred
pounds of coal used. The very best possible with largest and best machinery is a little more
than one pound from every hundred consumed.

When Watt gave to the steam-engine five times its efficiency by utilising the latent heat,
he only touched the fringe of the mysterious realm which envelops man.

Burbank, of the spineless cactus and new fruits, who has been delving deep into the mysteries,
tells us:

    The facts of plant life demand a kinetic theory of evolution, a
    slight change from Huxley's statement that, "Matter is a
    magazine of force," to that of matter being force alone. The
    time will come when the theory of "ions" will be thrown aside,
    and no line left between force and matter.

Professor Matthews, he who, with Professor Loeb at Wood's Hole, is imparting life to sea-urchins
through electrical reactions, declares "that certain chemical substances coming together under
certain conditions are bound to produce life. All life comes through the operation of universal
laws." We are but young in all this mysterious business. What lies behind and probably near
at hand may not merely revolutionise material agencies but human preconceptions as well. "There
are more things in Heaven and Earth than are ever dreamt of in your Philosophy."

Latent Heat was a find indeed, but there remained another discovery yet to make. Watt found
that no less than four-fifths of all the steam used was lost in heating the cold cylinder,
and only one-fifth performed service by acting on the piston. Prevent this, and the power of
the giant is increased fourfold. Here was the prize to contend for. Win this and the campaign
is won. First then, what caused the loss? This was soon determined. The cylinder was necessarily
cooled at the top because it was open to the air, and also cooled below in condensing the charge
of steam that had driven the piston up in order to create a vacuum, without which the piston
would not descend from top to bottom, to begin another upward stroke. A jet of cold water was
introduced to effect this. How to surmount this seemingly insuperable obstacle was the problem
that kept Watt long in profound study.

Many plans were entertained, only to be finally rejected. At last the flash came into that
teeming brain like a stroke of lightning. Eureka! he had found it. Not one scintilla of doubt
ever intruded thereafter. The solution lay right there and he would invent the needed appliances.
His mode of procedure, when on the trail of big game, is beautifully illustrated here. When
he found the root of the defect which rendered the Newcomen engine impracticable for general
purposes, he promptly formulated the one indispensable condition which alone met the problem,
and which the successful steam-engine must possess. He abandoned all else for the time as superfluous,
since this was the key of the position. This is the law he then laid down as an axiom--which
is repeated in his specification for his first patent in 1769: "To make a perfect steam engine
it was necessary that the cylinder should be always as hot as the steam which entered it, and
that the steam should be cooled below 100° to exert its full powers."

Watt describes how at last the idea of the "separate condenser," the complete cure, flashed
suddenly upon his mind:

    I had gone to take a walk on a fine Sabbath afternoon, early in
    1765. I then saw that I must get rid of
    the condensed steam and injection-water if I used a jet as in
    Newcomen's engine. Two ways of doing this occurred to me. First,
    the water might be run off by a descending pipe, if an offlet
    could be got at the depth of thirty-five or thirty-six feet,
    and any air might be extracted by a small pump. The second was
    to make the pump large enough to extract both water and air ...
    I had not walked farther than the golf-house when the whole
    thing was arranged in my mind.

Professor Black says, "This capital improvement flashed upon his mind at once and filled him
with rapture." We may imagine

    "Then felt he like some watcher of the skies
    When a new planet sweeps into his ken."

A new world had sprung forth in Watt's brain, for nothing less has the steam engine given to
man. One reads with a smile the dear modest man's deprecatory remarks about the condenser in
after years, when he was overcome by the glowing tributes paid him upon one occasion and hailed
as having conquered hitherto uncontrollable steam. He stammered out words to the effect that
it came in his way and he happened to find it; others had missed it; that was all; somebody
had to stumble upon it. That is all very well, and we love thee, Jamie Watt (he was always
Jamie to his friends), for such self-abnegation, but the truth of history must be vindicated
for all that. It proclaims, Thou art the man; go up higher and take your seat there among the
immortals, the inventor of the greatest of all inventions, a great discoverer and one of the
noblest of men!

In this one change lay all the difference between the Newcomen engine, limited to atmospheric
pressure, and the steam engine, capable of development into the modern engine through the increasing
use of the tremendous force of steam under higher pressures, and improved conditions from time
to time.

Watt leads the steam out of the cylinder and condenses it in a separate vessel, leaving the
cylinder hot. He closes the cylinder top and sends a circular piston (hitherto all had been
square) through it, and closely stuffs it around to prevent escape of steam. The rapidity of
the "strokes" gained keeps the temperature of the cylinder high; besides, he encases it and
leaves a space between cylinder and covering filled with steam. Thus he fulfils his law: "The
cylinder is kept as hot as the steam that enters." "How simple!" you exclaim. "Is that all?
How obviously this is the way to do it!" Very true, surprised reader, but true, also, that
no condenser and closed cylinder, no modern steam engine.

On Monday morning following the Sabbath flash, we find Watt was up betimes at work upon the
new idea. How many hours' sleep he had enjoyed is not recorded, but it may be imagined that
he had several visions of the condenser during the night. One was to be made at once; he borrowed
from a college friend a brass syringe, the body of which served as a cylinder. The first condenser
vessel was an improvised syringe and a tin can. From such an acorn the mighty oak was to grow.
The experiment was successful and the invention complete, but Watt saw clearly that years of
unceasing labor might yet pass before the details could all be worked out and the steam engine
appear ready to revolutionise the labor of the world. During these years, Professor Black was
his chief adviser and encouraged him in hours of disappointment. The true and able friend not
only did this, but furnished him with money needed to enable him to concentrate all his time
and strength upon the task.

Most opportunely, at this juncture, came Watt's marriage, to his cousin Miss Miller, a lady
to whom he had long been deeply attached. Watt's friends are agreed in stating that the marriage
was of vast importance, for he had not passed untouched through the days of toil and trial.
Always of a meditative turn, somewhat prone to melancholy when without companionship, and withal
a sufferer from nervous headaches, there was probably no gift of the gods equal to that of
such a wife as he had been so fortunate as to secure. Gentle yet strong in her gentleness,
it was her courage, her faith, and her smile that kept Watt steadfast. No doubt he, like many
other men blessed with an angel in the household, could truly aver that his worrying cares
vanished at the doorstep.

Watt had at last, what he never had before, a home. More than one intimate friend has given
expression to the doubt whether he could have triumphed without Mrs. Watt's bright and cheerful
temperament to keep him from despondency during the trying years which he had now to encounter.
Says Miss Campbell:

    I have not entered into any of the interesting details my mother
    gave me of Mr. Watt's early and constant attachment to his
    cousin Miss Miller; but she ever considered it as having added
    to his enjoyment of life, and as having had the most beneficial
    influence on his character. Even his powerful mind sank
    occasionally into misanthropic gloom, from the pressure of
    long-continued nervous headaches, and repeated disappointments
    in his hopes of success in life. Mrs. Watt, from her sweetness
    of temper, and lively, cheerful disposition, had power to win
    him from every wayward fancy; to rouse and animate him to active
    exertion. She drew out all his gentle virtues, his native
    benevolence and warm affections.

From all that has been recorded of her, we are justified in classing Watt with Bassanio.

        "It is very meet
    He live an upright life,
    For having such a blessing in his lady,
    He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
    And if on earth he do not merit it,
    In reason he should never come to heaven."

Watt knew and felt this and let us hope that, as was his duty, he let Mrs. Watt know it, not
only by act, but by frequent acknowledgment.

Watt did not marry imprudently, for his instrument-making business had increased, as was to
have been expected, for his work soon made a reputation as being most perfectly executed. At
first he was able to carry out all his orders himself; now he had as many as sixteen workmen.
He took a Mr. Craig as a partner, to obtain needed capital. His profits one year were $3,000.
The business had been removed in 1760 to new quarters in the city, and Watt himself had rented
a house outside the university grounds. Having furnished it, Watt brought his young wife and
installed her there, July, 1764. We leave him there, happy in the knowledge that he is to be
carefully looked after, and, last but not least, steadily encouraged and counselled not to
give up the engine. As we shall presently see, such encouragement was much needed at intervals.

The first step was to construct a model embodying all the inventions in a working form. An
old cellar was rented, and there the work began. To prepare the plan was easy, but its execution
was quite another story. Watt's sad experience with indifferent work had not been lost upon
him, and he was determined that, come what may, this working model should not fail from imperfect
construction. His own handiwork had been of the finest and most delicate kind, but, as he said,
he had "very little experience of mechanics in great." This model was a monster in those days,
and great was the difficulty of finding mechanics capable of carrying out his designs. The
only available men were blacksmiths and tinsmiths, and these were most clumsy workmen, even
in their own crafts. Were Watt to revisit the earth to-day, he would not easily find a more
decided change or advance over 1764, in all that has been changed or improved since then, than
in this very department of applied mechanics. To-day such a model as Watt constructed in the
cellar would be simple work indeed. Even the gasoline or the electric motor of to-day, though
complicated far beyond the steam model, is now produced by automatic machinery. Skilled workmen
do not have to fashion the parts. They only stand looking on at machinery--itself made by automatic
tools--performing work of unerring accuracy. Had Watt had at his call only a small part of
the inventory resources of our day, his model steam engine might have been named the Minerva,
for Minerva-like, it would have sprung forth complete, the creature of automatic machinery,
the workmen meanwhile smilingly looking on at these slaves of the mechanic which had been brought
forth and harnessed to do his bidding by the exercise of godlike reason.

The model was ready after six months of unceasing labor, but notwithstanding the scrupulous
fastidiousness displayed by Watt in the workmanship of all the parts, the machine, alas, "snifted
at many openings." Little can our mechanics of to-day estimate what "perfect joints" meant
in those days. The entire correctness of the great idea was, however, demonstrated by the trials
made. The right principle had been discovered; no doubt of that. Watt's decision was that "it
must be followed to an issue." There was no peace for him otherwise. He wrote (April, 1765)
to a friend, "My whole thoughts are bent on this machine. I can think of nothing else." Of
course not; he was hot in the chase of the biggest game hunter ever had laid eyes on. He had
seen it, and he knew he had the weapons to bring it down. A larger model, free as possible
from defects which he felt he could avoid in the next, was promptly determined upon. A larger
and better shop was obtained, and here Watt shut himself up with an assistant and erected the
second model. Two months sufficed, instead of six required for the first. This one also at
first trial leaked in many directions, and the condenser needed alterations. Nevertheless,
the engine accomplished much, for it worked readily with ten and one-half pounds pressure per
square inch, a decided increase over previous results. It was still the cylinder and its piston
that gave Watt the chief trouble. No wonder the cylinder leaked. It had to be hammered into
something like true lines, for at that day so backward was the art that not even the whole
collective mechanical skill of cylinder-making could furnish a bored cylinder of the simplest
kind. This is not to be construed as unduly hard upon Glasgow, for it is said that all the
skill of the world could not do so in 1765, only one hundred and forty years ago. We travel
so fast that it is not surprising that there are wiseacres among us quite convinced that we
are standing still.

We may be pardoned for again emphasising the fact that it is not only for his discoveries and
inventions that Watt is to be credited, but also for the manual ability displayed in giving
to these "airy nothings of the brain, a local habitation and a name," for his greatest idea
might have remained an "airy nothing," had he not been also the mechanician able to produce
it in the concrete. It is not, therefore, only Watt the inventor, Watt the discoverer, but
also Watt, the manual worker, that stands forth. As we shall see later on, he created a new
type of workmen capable of executing his plans, working with, and educating them often with
his own hands. Only thus did he triumph, laboring mentally and physically. Watt therefore must
always stand among the benefactors of men, in the triple capacity of discoverer, inventor,
and constructor.

The defects of the cylinder, though serious, were clearly mechanical. Their certain cure lay
in devising mechanical tools and appliances and educating workmen to meet the new demands.
An exact cylinder would leave no room for leakage between its smooth and true surface and the
piston; but the solution of another difficulty was not so easily indicated. Watt having closed
the top of the cylinder to save steam, was debarred from using water on the upper surface of
the piston as Newcomen did, to fill the interstices between piston and cylinder and prevent
leakage of steam, as his piston was round and passed through the top of the cylinder. The model
leaked badly from this cause, and while engaged trying numerous expedients to meet this, and
many different things for stuffing, he wrote to a friend, "My old White Iron man is dead."
This being the one he had trained to be his best mechanic, was a grievous loss in those days.
Misfortunes never come singly; he had just started the engine after overhauling it, when the
beam broke. Discouraged, but not defeated, he battled on, steadily gaining ground, meeting
and solving one difficulty after another, certain that he had discovered how to utilise steam.

CHAPTER IV

PARTNERSHIP WITH ROEBUCK

Capital was essential to perfect and place the engine upon the market; it would require several
thousand pounds. Had Watt been a rich man, the path would have been clear and easy, but he
was poor, having no means but those derived from his instrument-making business, which for
some time had necessarily been neglected. Where was the daring optimist who could be induced
to risk so much in an enterprise of this character, where result was problematical. Here, Watt's
best friend, Professor Black, who had himself from his own resources from time to time relieved
Watt's pressing necessities, proved once more the friend in time of need. Black thought of
Dr. Roebuck, founder of the celebrated Carron Iron Works near by, which Burns apostrophised
in these lines, when denied admittance:

    "We cam na here to view your works
    In hopes to be mair wise,
    But only lest we gang to hell
    It may be nae surprise."

He was approached upon the subject by Dr. Black, and finally, in September, 1765, he invited
Watt to visit him with the Professor at his country home, and urged him to press forward his
invention "whether he pursued it as a philosopher or as a man of business." In the month of
November Watt sent Roebuck drawings of a covered cylinder and piston to be cast at his works,
but it was so poorly done as to be useless. "My principal difficulty in making engines," he
wrote Roebuck, "is always the smith-work."

By this time, Watt was seriously embarrassed for money. Experiments cost much and brought in
nothing. His duty to his family required that he should abandon these for a time and labor
for means to support it. He determined to begin as a surveyor, as he had mastered the art when
making surveying instruments, as was his custom to study and master wherever he touched. He
could never rest until he knew all there was to know about anything. Of course he succeeded.
Everybody knew he would, and therefore business came to him. Even a public body, the magistrates
of Glasgow, had not the slightest hesitation in obtaining his services to survey a canal which
was to open a new coal field. He was also commissioned to survey the proposed Forth and Clyde
canal. Had he been content to earn money and become leading surveyor or engineer of Britain,
the world might have waited long for the forthcoming giant destined to do the world's work;
but there was little danger of this. The world had not a temptation that could draw Watt from
his appointed work. His thoughts were ever with his engine, every spare moment being devoted
to it. Roebuck's speculative and enterprising nature led him also into the entrancing field
of steam. It haunted him until finally, in 1767, he decided to pay off Watt's debts to the
amount of a thousand pounds, provide means for further experiments, and secure a patent for
the engine. In return, he became owner of two thirds of the invention.

Next year Watt made trial of a new and larger model, with unsatisfactory results upon the first
trial. He wrote Roebuck that "by an unforeseen misfortune, the mercury found its way into the
cylinder and played the devil with the solder." Only after a month's hard labor was the second
trial made, with very different and indeed astonishing results--"success to my heart's content,"
exclaimed Watt. Now he would pay his long-promised debt to his partner Roebuck, to whom he
wrote, "I sincerely wish you joy of this successful result, and hope it will make some return
for the obligations I owe you." The visit of congratulation paid to his partner Roebuck, was
delightful. Now were all their griefs "in the deep bosom of the ocean buried" by this recent
success. Already they saw fortunes in their hands, so brightly shone the sun these few but
happy days. But the old song has its lesson:

    "I've seen the morning the gay hills adorning,
    I've seen it storming before the close of day."

Instead of instant success, trying days and years were still before them. A patent was decided
upon, a matter of course and almost of formality in our day, but far from this at that time,
when it was considered monopolistic and was highly unpopular on that account. Watt went to
Berwick-on-Tweed to make the required declaration before a Master in Chancery. In August, 1768,
we find him in London about the patent, where he became so utterly wearied with the delays,
and so provoked with the enormous fees required to protect the invention, that he wrote his
wife in a most despairing mood. She administered the right medicine in reply, "I beg you will
not make yourself uneasy though things do not succeed as you wish. If the engine will not do,
something else will; never despair." Happy man whose wife is his best doctor. From the very
summit of elation, to which he had been raised by the success of the model, Watt was suddenly
cast down into the valley of despair to find that only half of his heavy task was done, and
the hill of difficulty still loomed before. Reaction took place, and the fine brain, so long
strained to utmost tension, refused at intervals to work at high pressure. He became subject
to recurring fits of despondency, aggravated, if not primarily caused by anxiety for his family,
who could not be maintained unless he engaged in work yielding prompt returns.

We may here mention one of his lifelong traits, which revealed itself at times. Watt was no
man of affairs. Business was distasteful to him. As he once wrote his partner, Boulton, he
"would rather face a loaded cannon than settle a disputed account or make a bargain." Monetary
matters were his special aversion. For any other form of annoyance, danger or responsibility,
he had the lion heart. Pecuniary responsibility was his bogey of the dark closet. He writes
that, "Solomon said that in the increase of knowledge there is increase of sorrow: if he had
substituted business for knowledge it would have been perfectly true."

Roebuck shines out brilliantly in this emergency. He was always sanguine, and encouraged Watt
to go forward. October, 1768, he writes:

    You are now letting the most active part of your life insensibly
    glide away. A day, a moment, ought not to be lost. And you
    should not suffer your thoughts to be diverted by any other
    object, or even improvement of this [model], but only the
    speediest and most effectual manner of executing an engine of a
    proper size, according to your present ideas.

Watt wrote Dr. Small in January, 1769, "I have much contrived and little executed. How much
would good health and spirits be worth to me!" and a month later, "I am still plagued with
headaches and sometimes heartaches." Sleepless nights now came upon him. All this time, however,
he was absorbed in his one engrossing task. Leupold's "Theatrim Machinarum," which fell into
his hands, gave an account of the machinery, furnaces and methods of mine-working in the upper
Hartz. Alas! the book was in German, and he could not understand it. He promptly resolved to
master the language, sought out a Swiss-German dyer then settled in Glasgow whom he engaged
to give him lessons. So German and the German book were both mastered. Not bad work this from
one in the depths of despair. It has been before noted that for the same end he had successfully
mastered French and Italian. So in sickness as in health his demon steam pursued him, giving
him no rest.

Watt had a hard piece of work in preparing his first patent-specification, which was all-important
in those early days of patent "monopolies" as these were considered. Their validity often turned
upon a word or two too much or too little. It was as dangerous to omit as to admit. Professionals
agree in opinion that Watt here displayed extraordinary ability.

In nothing has public opinion more completely changed than in its attitude toward patents.
In Watt's day, the inventor who applied for a patent was a would-be monopolist. The courts
shared the popular belief. Lord Brougham vehemently remonstrated against this, declaring that
the inventor was entitled to remuneration. Every point was construed against the unfortunate
benefactor, as if he were a public enemy attempting to rob his fellows. To-day the inventor
is hailed as the foremost of benefactors.

Notable indeed is it that on the very day Watt obtained his first patent, January 5th, 1769,
Arkwright got his spinning-frame patent. Only the year before Hargreaves obtained his patent
for the spinning-jenny. These are the two inventors, with Whitney, the American inventor of
the cotton-gin, from whose brains came the development of the textile industry in which Britain
still stands foremost. Fifty-six millions of spindles turn to-day in the little island--more
than all the rest of the civilised world can boast. Much later came Stephenson with his locomotive.
Here is a record for a quartette of manual laborers in the truest sense, actual wage-earners
as mechanics--Watt, Stephenson, Arkwright, and Hargreaves! Where is that quartette to be equalled?

Workingmen of our day should ponder over this, and take to heart the truth that manual mechanical
labor is the likeliest career to develop mechanical inventors and lead them to such distinction
as these benefactors of man achieved. If disposed to mourn the lack of opportunity, they should
think of these working-men, whose advantages were small compared to those of our day.

The greatest invention of all, the condenser, is fully covered by the first patent of 1769.
The best engine up to this time was the Newcomen, exclusively used for pumping water. As we
have seen, it was an atmospheric engine, in no sense a steam engine. Steam was only used to
force the heavy piston upward, no other work being done by it. All the pumping was done on
the downward stroke. The condensation of the spent steam below the piston created a vacuum,
which only facilitated the fall of the piston. This caused the cylinder to be cooled between
each stroke and led to the wastage of about four-fifths of all the steam used. It was to save
this that the condenser was invented, in obedience to Watt's law, as stated in his patent,
that "the cylinder should be kept always as hot as the steam that entered it"; but it must
be kept clearly in mind that Watt's "modified machines," under his first patent, only used
steam to do work upon the upward stroke, where Newcomen used it only to force up the piston.
The double-acting engine--doing work up and down--came later, and was protected in the second
patent of 1780.

Watt knew better than any that although his model had been successful and was far beyond the
Newcomen engine, it was obvious that it could be improved in many respects--not the least of
his reasons for confidence in its final and more complete triumph.

To these possible improvements, he devoted himself for years. The records once again remind
us that it was not one invention, but many, that his task involved. Smiles gives the following
epitome of some of those pressing at this stage:

    Various trials of pipe-condensers, plate-condensers and
    drum-condensers, steam-jackets to prevent waste of heat, many
    trials of new methods to tighten the piston band, condenser
    pumps, oil pumps, gauge pumps, exhausting cylinders,
    loading-valves, double cylinders, beams and cranks--all these
    contrivances and others had to be thought out and tested
    elaborately amidst many failures and disappointments.

There were many others.

All unaided, this supreme toiler thus slowly and painfully evolved the steam engine after long
years of constant labor and anxiety, bringing to the task a union of qualities and of powers
of head and hand which no other man of his time--may we not venture to say of all time--was
ever known to possess or ever exhibited.

When a noble lord confessed to him admiration for his noble achievements, Watt replied, "The
public only look at my success and not at the intermediate failures and uncouth constructions
which have served me as so many steps to climb to the top of the ladder."

Quite true, but also quite right. The public have no time to linger over a man's mistakes.
What concerns is his triumphs. We "rise upon our dead selves (failures) to higher things,"
and mistakes, recognised as such in after days, make for victory. The man who never makes mistakes
never makes anything. The only point the wise man guards is not to make the same mistake twice;
the first time never counts with the successful man. He both forgives and forgets that. One
difference between the wise man and the foolish one!

It has been truly said that Watt seemed to have divined all the possibilities of steam. We
have a notable instance of this in a letter of this period (March, 1769) to his friend, Professor
Small, in which he anticipated Trevithick's use of high-pressure steam in the locomotive. Watt
said:

    I intend in many cases to employ the expansive force of steam to
    press on the piston, or whatever is used instead of one, in the
    same manner as the weight of the atmosphere is now employed in
    common fire engines. In some cases I intend to use both the
    condenser and this force of steam, so that the powers of these
    engines will as much exceed those pressed only by the air, as
    the expansive power of the steam is greater than the weight of
    the atmosphere. In other cases, when plenty of cold water cannot
    be had, I intend to work the engines by the force of steam only,
    and to discharge it into the air by proper outlets after it has
    done its office.

In these days patents could be very easily blocked, as Watt experienced with his improved crank
motion. He proceeded therefore in great secrecy to erect the first large engine under his patent,
after he had successfully made a very small one for trial. An outhouse near one of Dr. Roebuck's
pits was selected as away from prying eyes. The parts for the new engine were partly supplied
from Watt's own works in Glasgow and partly from the Carron works. Here the old trouble, lack
of competent mechanics, was again met with. On his return from necessary absences, the men
were usually found in face of the unexpected and wondering what to do next. As the engine neared
completion, Watt's anxiety "for his approaching doom," he writes, kept him from sleep, his
fears being equal to his hopes. He was especially sensitive and discouraged by unforeseen expenditure,
while his sanguine partner, Roebuck, on the contrary, continued hopeful and energetic, and
often rallied his pessimistic partner on his propensity to look upon the dark side. He was
one of those who adhered to the axiom, "Never bid the devil good-morning till you meet him."
Smiles believes that it is probable that without Roebuck's support Watt could never have gone
on, but that may well be doubted. His anxieties probably found a needed vent in their expression,
and left the indomitable do-or-die spirit in all its power. Watt's brain, working at high pressure,
needed a safety valve. Mrs. Roebuck, wife-like, very properly entertained the usual opinion
of devoted wives, that her husband was really the essential man upon whom the work devolved,
and, that without him nothing could have been accomplished. Smiles probably founded his remark
upon her words to Robison: "Jamie (Watt) is a queer lad, and, without the Doctor (her husband),
his invention would have been lost. He won't let it perish." The writer knows of a business
organisation in which fond wives of the partners were all full of dear Mrs. Roebuck's opinion.
At one time, according to them, the sole responsibility rested upon three of four of these
marvellous husbands, and never did any of the confiding consorts ever have reason to feel that
their friend did not share to the fullest extent the highly praiseworthy opinion formed of
his partners by their loving wives. The rising smile was charitably suppressed. In extreme
cases a suggested excursion to Europe at the company's expense, to relieve Chester from the
cruel strain, and enable him to receive the benefit of a wife's care and ever needful advice,
was remarkably effective, the wife's fears that Chester's absence would prove ruinous to the
business being overcome at last, though with difficulty.

Due allowance must be made for Mrs. Roebuck's view of the situation. There can be no doubt
whatever, that Mr. Roebuck's influence, hopefulness and courage were of inestimable value at
this period to the over-wrought and anxious inventor. Watt was not made of malleable stuff,
and, besides, he was tied to his mission. He was bound to obey his genius.

The monster new engine, upon which so much depended, was ready for trial at last in September,
1769. About six months had been spent in its construction. Its success was indifferent. Watt
had declared it to be a "clumsy job." The new pipe-condenser did not work well, the cylinder
was almost useless, having been badly cast, and the old difficulty in keeping the piston-packing
tight remained. Many things were tried for packing--cork, oiled rags, old hats (felt probably),
paper, horse dung, etc., etc. Still the steam escaped, even after a thorough overhauling. The
second experiment also failed. So great is the gap between the small toy model and the practical
work-performing giant, a rock upon which many sanguine theoretical inventors have been wrecked!
Had Watt been one of that class, he could never have succeeded. Here we have another proof
of the soundness of the contention that Watt, the mechanic, was almost as important as Watt
the inventor.

Watt remained as certain as ever of the soundness of his inventions. Nothing could shake his
belief that he had discovered the true scientific mode of utilising steam. His failures lay
in the impossibility of finding mechanics capable of accurate workmanship. There were none
such at Carron, nor did he then know of any elsewhere.

Watt's letter to his friend, Dr. Small, at this juncture, is interesting. He writes:

    You cannot conceive how mortified I am with this disappointment.
    It is a damned thing for a man to have his all hanging by a
    single string. If I had wherewithal to pay the loss, I don't
    think I should so much fear a failure; but I cannot bear the
    thought of other people becoming losers by my schemes; and I
    have the happy disposition of always painting the worst.

Watt's timidity and fear of money matters generally have been already noted. He had the Scotch
peasant's horror of debt--anything but that. This probably arises from the fact that the trifling
sums owing by the poor to their poor neighbors who have kindly helped them in distress are
actually needed by these generous friends for comfortable existence. The loss is serious, and
this cuts deeply into grateful hearts. The millionaire's downfall, with large sums owing to
banks, rich money-lenders, and wealthy manufacturers, really amounts to little. No one actually
suffers, since imprisonment for debt no longer exists; hence "debt" means little to the great
operator, who neither suffers want himself by failure nor entails it upon others.

To Watt, pressing pecuniary cares were never absent, and debt added to these made him the most
afflicted of men. Besides this, he says, he had been cheated and was "unlucky enough to know."
Wise man! ignorance in such cases is indeed bliss. We should almost be content to be cheated
as long as we do not find it out.

It was at such a crisis as this that another cloud, and a dark one, came. The sanguine, enterprising,
kindly Roebuck was in financial straits. His pits had been much troubled by water, which no
existing machinery could pump out. He had hoped that the new engine would prove successful
and sufficiently powerful in time to avert the drowning of the pits, but this hope had failed.
His embarrassments were so pressing that he was unable to pay the cost of the engine patent,
according to agreement, and Watt had to borrow the money for this from that never-failing friend,
Professor Black. Long may his memory be gratefully remembered. Watt had the delightful qualities
which attracted friends, and those of the highest and best character, but among them all, though
more than one might have been willing, none were both able and willing to sustain him in days
of trouble except the famous discoverer of latent heat. When we think of Watt, we picture him
holding Black by the one hand and Small by the other, repeating to them

    "I think myself in nothing else so happy
    As in a soul remembering my dear friends."

The patent was secured--so much to the good--but Watt had already spent too much time upon
profitless work, at least more time than he could afford. His duty to provide for the frugal
wants of his family became imperative. "I had," he said, "a wife and children, and I saw myself
growing gray without having any settled way of providing for them." He turned again to surveying
and prospered, for few such men as Watt were to be found in those days, or in any day. With
a record of Watt's work as surveyor, engineer, councillor, etc., our readers need not be troubled
in detail. It should, however, be recorded that the chief canal schemes in Scotland in this,
the day of canals for internal commerce, preceding the day of railroads that was to come, were
entrusted to Watt, who continued to act as engineer for the Monkland Canal. While Watt was
acting as engineer for this (1770-72), Dr. Small wrote him that he and Boulton had been talking
of moving canal boats by the steam engine on the high-pressure principle. In his reply, September
30, 1770, Watt asks, "Have you ever considered a spiral oar for that purpose, or are you for
two wheels?" To make his meaning quite plain, he gives a rough sketch of the screw propeller,
with four turns as used to-day.

Thus the idea of the screw propeller to be worked by his own improved engine was propounded
by Watt one hundred and thirty-five years ago.

This is a remarkable letter, and a still more remarkable sketch, and adds another to the many
true forecasts of future development made by this teeming brain.

Watt also made a survey of the Clyde, and reported upon its proposed deepening. His suggestions
remained unacted upon for several years, when the work was begun, and is not ended even in
our day, of making a trout and salmon stream into one of the busiest, navigable highways of
the world. This year further improvements have been decided upon, so that the monsters of our
day, with 16,000-horse-power turbine engines, may be built near Glasgow. Watt also made surveys
for a canal between Perth and Coupar Angus, for the well-known Crinan Canal and other projects
in the Western Highlands, as also for the great Caledonian and the Forth and Clyde Canals.

The Perth Canal was forty miles long through a rough country, and took forty-three days, for
which Watt's fee, including expenses, was $400. Labor, even of the highest kind, was cheap
in those times. We note his getting thirty-seven dollars for plans of a bridge over the Clyde.
Watt prepared plans for docks and piers at Port Glasgow and for a new harbor at Ayr. His last
and most important engineering work in Scotland was the survey of the Caledonian Canal, made
in the autumn of 1773, through a district then without roads. "An incessant rain kept me,"
he writes, "for three days as wet as water could make me. I could scarcely preserve my journal
book."

Suffice it to note that he saved enough money to be able to write, "Supposing the engine to
stand good for itself, I am able to pay all my debts and some little thing more, so that I
hope in time to be on a par with the world."

       *       *       *       *       *

We are now to make one of the saddest announcements saving dishonor that it falls to man to
make. Watt's wife died in childbed in his absence. He was called home from surveying the Caledonian
Canal. Upon arrival, he stands paralysed for a time at the door, unable to summon strength
to enter the ruined home. At last the door opens and closes and we close our eyes upon the
scene--no words here that would not be an offence. The rest is silence.

Watt tried to play the man, but he would have been less than man if the ruin of his home had
not made him a changed man. The recovery of mental equipoise proved for a time quite beyond
his power. He could do all that man could do, "who could do more is none." The light of his
life had gone out.

       *       *       *       *       *

CHAPTER V

BOULTON PARTNERSHIP

After Watt was restored to himself the first subject which we find attracting him was the misfortunes
of Roebuck, whose affairs were now in the hands of his creditors. "My heart bleeds for him,"
says Watt, "but I can do nothing to help him. I have stuck by him, indeed, until I have hurt
myself." Roebuck's affairs were far too vast to be affected by all that Watt had or could have
borrowed. For the thousand pounds Watt had paid on Roebuck's account to secure the patent,
he was still in debt to Black. This was subsequently paid, however, with interest, when Watt
became prosperous.

We now bid farewell to Roebuck with genuine regret. He had proved himself a fine character
throughout, just the kind of partner Watt needed. It was a great pity that he had to relinquish
his interest in the patent, when, as we shall see, it would soon have saved him from bankruptcy
and secured him a handsome competence. He must ever rank as one of the men almost indispensable
to Watt in the development of his engine, and a dear, true friend.

The darkest hour comes before the dawn, and so it proved here. As Roebuck retired, there appeared
a star of hope of the first magnitude, in no less a person than the celebrated Matthew Boulton
of Birmingham, of whom we must say a few words by way of introduction to our readers, for in
all the world there was not his equal as a partner for Watt, who was ever fortunate in his
friends. Of course Watt was sure to have friends, for he was through and through the devoted
friend himself, and won the hearts of those worth winning. "If you wish to make a friend, be
one," is the sure recipe.

Boulton was not only obviously the right man but he came from the right place, for Birmingham
was the headquarters of mechanical industry. At this time, 1776, there was at last a good road
to London. As late as 1747 the coach was advertised to run there in two days only "if the roads
permit."

If skilled mechanics, Watt's greatest need, were to be found anywhere, it was here in the centre
of mechanical skill, and especially was it in the celebrated works of Boulton, which had been
bequeathed from worthy sire to worthy son, to be largely extended and more than ever preëminent.

Boulton left school early to engage in his father's business. When only seventeen years old,
he had made several improvements in the manufacture of buttons, watch chains, and various trinkets,
and had invented the inlaid steel buckles, which became so fashionable. It is stated that in
that early day it was found necessary to export them in large quantities to France to be returned
and sold in Britain as the latest productions of French skill and taste. It is well to get
a glimpse of human nature as seen here. Fashion decides for a time with supreme indifference
to quality. It is a question of the name.

At his father's death, the son inherited the business. Great credit belongs to him for unceasingly
laboring to improve the quality of his products and especially to raise the artistic standard,
then so low as to have already caused "Brummagem" to become a term of reproach. He not only
selected the cleverest artisans, but he employed the best artists, Flaxman being one, to design
the artistic articles produced. The natural result followed. Boulton's work soon gained high
reputation. New and larger factories became necessary, and the celebrated Soho works arose
in 1762. The spirit in which Boulton pursued business is revealed in a letter to his partner
at Soho from London. "The prejudice that Birmingham hath so justly established against itself
makes every fault conspicuous in all articles that have the least pretensions to taste." It
may interest American readers familiar with One Dollar watches, rendered possible by production
upon a large scale, that it was one of Boulton's leading ideas in that early day that articles
in common use could be produced much better and cheaper "if manufactured by the help of the
best machinery upon a large scale, and this could be successfully done in the making of clocks
and timepieces." He promptly erected the machinery and started this new branch of business.
Both King and Queen received him cordially and became his patrons. Soho works soon became famous
and one of the show places of the country; princes, philosophers, poets, authors and merchants
from foreign lands visited them and were hospitably received by Boulton.

He was besieged with requests to take gentlemen apprentices into the works, hundreds of pounds
sometimes being offered as premium, but he resolutely declined, preferring to employ boys whom
he could train up as workmen. He replies to a gentleman applicant, "I have built and furnished
a house for the reception of one class of apprentices--fatherless children, parish apprentices,
and hospital boys; and gentlemen's sons would probably find themselves out of place in such
companionship."

It is not to be inferred that Boulton grew up an uncultured man because he left school very
early. On the contrary, he steadily educated himself, devoting much time to study, so that
with his good looks, handsome presence, the manners of the gentleman born, and knowledge much
beyond the average of that class, he had little difficulty in winning for his wife a lady of
such position in the county as led to some opposition on the part of members of her family
to the suitor, but only "on account of his being in trade." There exists no survival of this
objection in these days of American alliances with heirs of the highest British titles. We
seem now to have as its substitute the condition that the father of the bride must be in trade
and that heavily and to some purpose.

Boulton, like most busy men, had time, and an open mind, for new ideas. None at this time interested
him so deeply as that of the steam engine. Want of water-power proved a serious difficulty
at Soho. He wrote to a friend, "The enormous expense of the horse-power" (it was also irregular
and sometimes failed) "put me upon thinking of turning the mill by fire. I made many fruitless
experiments on the subject."

Boulton wrote Franklin, February 22, 1766, in London, about this, and sent a model he had made.
Franklin replies a month later, apologising for the delay on account of "the hurry and anxiety
I have been engaged in with our American affairs."[1]

Tamer of lightning and tamer of steam, Franklin and Watt--one of the new, the other of the
old branch of our English-speaking race--co-operating in enlarging the powers of man and pushing
forward the chariot of progress--fit subject, this, for the sculptor and painter!

How much further the steam engine is to be the hand-maid of electricity cannot be told, for
it seems impossible to set limits to the future conquests of the latter, which is probably
destined to perform miracles un-dreamt of to-day, perhaps coupled in some unthought-of way,
with radium, the youngest sprite of the weird, uncanny tribe of mysterious agents. Uranium,
the supposed basis of the latest discovery, Radium, has only one-millionth part of the heat
of the latter. The slow-moving earth takes twenty-four hours to turn upon its axis. Radium
covers an equal distance while we pronounce its name. One and one-quarter seconds, and twenty-five
thousand miles are traversed. Puck promises to put his "girdle round the earth in forty minutes."
Radium would pass the fairy girdlist in the spin round sixteen hundred times. Thus truth, as
it is being evolved in our day, becomes stranger than the wildest imaginings of fiction. Our
century seems on the threshold of discoveries and advances, not less revolutionary, perhaps
more so, than those that have sprung from steam and electricity. "Canst thou send lightnings
to say 'Lo, here I am'?" silenced man. It was so obviously beyond his power until last century.
Now he smiles as he reads the question. Is Tyndal's prophecy to be verified that "the potency
of all things is yet to be found in matter"?

We may be sure the searching, restless brains of Franklin and Watt would have been meditating
upon strange things these days if they were now alive.

Boulton is entitled to rank, so far as the writer knows, as the first man in the world worthy
to wear Carlyle's now somewhat familiar title, "Captain of Industry" for he was in his day
foremost in the industrial field, and before that, industrial organisations had not developed
far enough to create or require captains, in Carlyle's sense.

Roebuck, while Watt's partner, was one of Boulton's correspondents, and told him of Watt's
progress with the model engine which proved so successful. Boulton was deeply interested, and
expressed a desire that Watt should visit him at Soho. This he did, on his return from a visit
to London concerning the patent. Boulton was not at home, but his intimate friend, Dr. Small,
then residing at Birmingham, a scientist and philosopher, whom Franklin had recommended to
Boulton, took Watt in charge. Watt was amazed at what he saw, for this was his first meeting
with trained and skilled mechanics, the lack of whom had made his life miserable. The precision
of both tools and workmen sank deep. Upon a subsequent visit, he met the captain himself, his
future partner, and of course, as like draws to like, they drew to each other, a case of mutual
liking at first sight. We meet one stranger, and stranger he remains to the end of the chapter.
We meet another, and ere we part he is a kindred soul. Magnetic attraction is sudden. So with
these two, who, by a kind of free-masonry, knew that each had met his affinity. The Watt engine
was exhaustively canvassed and its inventor was delighted that the great, sagacious, prudent
and practical manufacturer should predict its success as he did. Shortly after this, Professor
Robison visited Soho, which was a magnet that attracted the scientists in those days. Boulton
told him that he had stopped work upon his proposed pumping engine. "I would necessarily avail
myself of what I learned from Mr. Watt's conversation, and this would not be right without
his consent."

It is such a delicate sense of honor as is here displayed that marks the man, and finally makes
his influence over others commanding in business. It is not sharp practice and smart bargaining
that tell. On the contrary, there is no occupation in which not only fair but liberal dealing
brings greater reward. The best bargain is that good for both parties. Boulton and Watt were
friends. That much was settled. They had business transactions later, for we find Watt sending
a package containing "one dozen German flutes" (made of course by him in Glasgow), "at 5s.
each, and a copper digester, £1:10." Boulton's people probably wished samples.

Much correspondence followed between Dr. Small and Watt, the latter constantly expressing the
wish that Mr. Boulton could be induced to become partner with himself and Roebuck in his patents.
Naturally the sagacious manufacturer was disinclined to associate himself with Mr. Roebuck,
then in financial straits, but the position changed when he had become bankrupt and affairs
were in the hands of creditors. Watt therefore renewed the subject and agreed to go and settle
in Birmingham, as he had been urged to do. Roebuck's pitiable condition he keenly felt, and
had done everything possible to ameliorate.

    What little I can do for him is purchased by denying myself the
    conveniences of life my station requires, or by remaining in
    debt, which it galls me to the bone to owe. I shall be content
    to hold a very small share in the partnership, or none at all,
    provided I am to be freed from my pecuniary obligations to
    Roebuck and have any kind of recompense for even a part of the
    anxiety and ruin it has involved me in.

Thus wrote Watt to his friend Small, August 30, 1772. Small's reply pointed out one difficulty
which deserves notice and commendation. "It is impossible for Mr. Boulton and me, or any other
honest man, to purchase, especially from two particular friends, what has no market price,
and at a time when they might be inclined to part with the commodity at an under value." This
is an objection which to stock-exchange standards may seem "not well taken," and far too fantastical
for the speculative domain, and yet it is neither surprising nor unusual in the realms of genuine
business, in which men are concerned with or creating only intrinsic values.

The result so ardently desired by Watt was reached in this unexpected fashion. It was found
that in the ordinary course of business Roebuck owed Boulton a balance of $6,000. Boulton agreed
to take the Roebuck interest in the Watt patent for the debt. As the creditors considered the
patent interest worthless, they gladly accepted. As Watt said, "it was only paying one bad
debt with another."

Boulton asked Watt to act as his attorney in the matter, which he did, writing Boulton that
"the thing is now a shadow; 'tis merely ideal, and will cost time and money to realise it."
This as late as March 29, 1773, after eight years of constant experimentation, with many failures
and disappointments, since the discovery of the separate condenser in 1765, which was then
hailed, and rightly so, as the one thing needed. It remained the right and only foundation
upon which to develop the steam engine, but many minor obstacles intervened, requiring Watt's
inventive and mechanical genius to overcome.

The transfer of Roebuck's two-third interest to Boulton afterward carried with it the formation
of the celebrated firm of Boulton and Watt. The latter arranged his affairs as quickly as possible.
He had only made $1,000 for a whole year spent in surveying, and part of that he gave to Roebuck
in his necessity, "so that I can barely support myself and keep untouched the small sum I have
allotted for my visit to you." (Watt to Small, July 25, 1773). This is pitiable indeed--Watt
pressed for money to pay his way to Birmingham upon important business.

The trial engine was shipped from Kinneil to Soho and Watt arrived in May, 1774, in Birmingham.
Here a new life opened before him, still enveloped in clouds, but we may please ourselves by
believing that through these the wearied and harassed inventor did not fail to catch alluring
visions of the sun.

Partnership requires not duplicates, but opposites--a union of different qualities. He who
proves indispensable as a partner to one man might be wholly useless, or even injurious, to
another. Generals Grant and Sherman needed very different chiefs of staff. One secret of Napoleon's
success arose from his being free to make his own appointments, choosing the men who had the
qualities which supplemented his and cured his own shortcomings, for every man has shortcomings.
The universal genius who can manage all himself has yet to appear. Only one with the genius
to recognise others of different genius and harness them to his own car can approach the "universal."
It is a case of different but coöperating abilities, each part of the complicated machine fitting
into its right place, and there performing its duty without jarring.

Never were two men more "supplementary" to each other than Boulton and Watt, and hence their
success. One possessed in perfection the qualities the other lacked. Smiles sums this up so
finely that we must quote him:

    Different though their characters were in most respects, Boulton
    at once conceived a hearty liking for him. The one displayed in
    perfection precisely those qualities which the other wanted.
    Boulton was a man of ardent and generous temperament, bold and
    enterprising, undaunted by difficulty, and possessing an almost
    boundless capacity for work. He was a man of great tact, clear
    perception, and sound judgment. Moreover, he possessed that
    indispensable quality of perseverance, without which the best
    talents are of comparatively little avail in the conduct of
    important affairs. While Watt hated business, Boulton loved it.
    He had, indeed, a genius for business--a gift almost as rare as
    that for poetry, for art, or for war. He possessed a marvellous
    power of organisation. With a keen eye for details, he combined
    a comprehensive grasp of intellect. While his senses were so
    acute, that when sitting in his office at Soho he could detect
    the slightest stoppage or derangement in the machinery of that
    vast establishment, and send his message direct to the spot
    where it had occurred, his power of imagination was such as
    enabled him to look clearly along extensive lines of possible
    action in Europe, America, and the East. For there is a poetic
    as well as a commonplace side to business; and the man of
    business genius lights up the humdrum routine of daily life by
    exploring the boundless region of possibility wherever it may
    lie open before him.

This tells the whole story, and once again reminds us that without imagination and something
of the romantic element, little great or valuable is to be done in any field. He "runs his
business as if it were a romance," was said upon one occasion. The man who finds no element
of romance in his occupation is to be pitied. We know how radically different Watt was in his
nature to Boulton, whose judgment of men was said to be almost unerring. He recognised in Watt
at their first interview, not only the original inventive genius, but the indefatigable, earnest,
plodding and thorough mechanic of tenacious grip, and withal a fine, modest, true man, who
hated bargaining and all business affairs, who cared nothing for wealth beyond a very modest
provision for old age, and who was only happy if so situated that without anxiety for money
to supply frugal wants, he could devote his life to the development of the steam engine. Thus
auspiciously started the new firm.

    But Boulton was more than a man of business, continues Smiles;
    he was a man of culture, and the friend of educated men. His
    hospitable mansion at Soho was the resort of persons eminent in
    art, in literature, and in science; and the love and admiration
    with which he inspired such men affords one of the best proofs
    of his own elevation of character. Among the most intimate of
    his friends and associates were Richard Lovell Edgeworth, a
    gentleman of fortune, enthusiastically devoted to his
    long-conceived design of moving land-carriages by steam; Captain
    Keir, an excellent practical chemist, a wit and a man of
    learning; Dr. Small, the accomplished physician, chemist and
    mechanist; Josiah Wedgwood, the practical philosopher and
    manufacturer, founder of a new and important branch of skilled
    industry; Thomas Day, the ingenious author of "Sandford and
    Merton"; Dr. Darwin, the poet-physician; Dr. Withering, the
    botanist; besides others who afterward joined the Soho circle,
    not the least distinguished of whom were Joseph Priestley and
    James Watt.

The first business in hand was the reconstruction of the engine brought from Kinneil, which
upon trial performed much better than before, wholly on account of the better workmanship attainable
at Soho; but there still recurs the unceasing complaint that runs throughout the long eight
years of trial--lack of accurate tools and skilled workmen, the difference in accuracy between
the blacksmith standard and that of the mathematical-instrument maker. Watt and Boulton alike
agreed that the inventions were scientifically correct and needed only proper construction.
In our day it is not easy to see the apparently insuperable difficulty of making anything to
scale and perfectly accurate, but we forget what the world of Watt was and how far we have
advanced since.

Watt wrote to his father at Greenock, November, 1774: "The business I am here about has turned
out rather successful; that is to say, the fire-engine I have invented is now going, and answers
much better than any other that has yet been made." This is as is usual with the Scotch in
speech, in a low key and extremely modest, on a par with the verdict rendered by the Dunfermline
critic who had ventured to attend "the playhouse" in Edinburgh to see Garrick in Hamlet--"no
bad." The truth was that, so pronounced were the results of proper workmanship, coupled with
some of those improvements which Watt was constantly devising, the engine was so satisfactory
as to set both Boulton and Watt to thinking about the patent which protected the invention.
Six of the fourteen years for which it was granted had already passed. Some years would still
be needed to ensure its general use, and it was feared that before the patent expired little
return might be received. Much interest was aroused by the successful trial. Enquiries began
to pour in for pumping engines for mines. The Newcomen had proved inadequate to work the mines
as they became deeper, and many were being abandoned in consequence. The necessity for a new
power had set many ingenious men to work besides Watt, and some of these were trying to adopt
Watt's principles while avoiding his patent. Hatley, one of Watt's workmen upon the trial engine
at the Carron works, had stolen and sold the drawings.

All this put Boulton and Watt on their guard, and the former hesitated to build the new works
intended for the manufacture of steam engines upon a large scale with improved machinery. An
extension of the patent seemed essential, and to secure this Watt proceeded to London and spent
some time there, busy in his spare moments visiting the mathematical instrument shops of his
youth, and attending to numerous commissions from Boulton. A second visit was paid to London,
during which the sad intelligence of the death of his dear friend, Dr. Small, reached him.
In the bitterness of his grief, Boulton writes him: "If there were not a few other objects
yet remaining for me to settle my affections upon, I should wish also to take up my abode in
the mansions of the dead." Watt's sympathetic reply reminds Boulton of the sentiments held
by their departed friend--that, instead of indulging in unavailing sorrow, the best refuge
is the more sedulous performance of duties. "Come, my dear sir," he writes, "and immerse yourself
in this sea of business as soon as possible. Pay a proper respect to your friend by obeying
his precepts. No endeavour of mine shall be wanting to make life agreeable to you."

Beautiful partnership this, not only of business, but also entering into the soul close and
deep, comprehending all of life and all we know of death.

Professor Small, born 1734, was a Scot, who went to Williamsburg University, Virginia, as Professor
of mathematics and natural philosophy. Thomas Jefferson was among his pupils. His health suffered,
and he returned to the old home. Franklin introduced him to Boulton, writing (May 22, 1765):

    I beg leave to introduce my friend Doctor Small to your
    acquaintance, and to recommend him to your civilities. I would
    not take this freedom if I were not sure it would be agreeable
    to you; and that you will thank me for adding to the number of
    those who from their knowledge of you must respect you, one who
    is both an ingenious philosopher and a most worthy, honest man.
    If anything new in magnetism or electricity, or any other branch
    of natural knowledge, has occurred to your fruitful genius since
    I last had the pleasure of seeing you, you will by communicating
    it greatly oblige me.

This man must have been one of the finest characters revealed in Watt's life. Altho he left
little behind him to ensure permanent remembrance, the extraordinary tributes paid his memory
by friends establish his right to high rank among the coterie of eminent men who surrounded
Watt and Boulton. Boulton records that "there being nothing which I wish to fix in my mind
so permanently as the remembrance of my dear departed friend, I did not delay to erect a memorial
in the prettiest but most obscure part of my garden, from which you see the church in which
he was interred." Dr. Darwin contributed the verses inscribed. Upon hearing of Small's illness
Day hastened from Brussels to be present at the last hour.

Keir writes, announcing Small's death to his brother, the Rev. Robert Small, in Dundee, "It
is needless to say how universally he is lamented; for no man ever enjoyed or deserved more
the esteem of mankind. We loved him with the tenderest affection and shall ever revere his memory."

Watt's voluminous correspondence with Professor Small, previous to his partnership with Boulton,
proves Small at that time to have been his intimate friend and counsellor. We scarcely know
in all literature of a closer union between two men. Many verses of Tennyson's Memorial to
Hallam could be appropriately applied to their friendship. Watt did not apparently give way
to lamentations as Boulton and others did who were present at Small's death, probably because
the receipt of Boulton's heart-breaking letter impressed Watt with the need of assuming the
part of comforter to his partner, who was face to face with death, and had to bear the direct
blow. Watt's tribute to his dear friend came later.

Future operations necessarily depended upon the extension of the patent. Boulton, of course,
could not proceed with the works. There was as yet no agreement between Watt and Boulton beyond
joint ownership in the patent. At this time, Watt's most intimate friend of youthful years
in Glasgow University, Professor Robison, was Professor of mathematics in the Government Naval
School, Kronstadt. He secured for Watt an appointment at $5,000 per annum, a fortune to the
poor inventor; but although this would have relieved him from dependence upon Boulton, and
meant future affluence, he declined, alleging that "Boulton's favours were so gracefully conferred
that dependence on him was not felt." He made Watt feel "that the obligation was entirely upon
the side of the giver." Truly we must canonise Boulton. He was not only the first "Captain
of Industry," but also a model for all others to follow.

The bill extending the patent was introduced in Parliament February, 1775. Opposition soon
developed. The mining interest was in serious trouble owing to the deepening of the mines and
the unbearable expense of pumping the water. They had looked forward to the Watt engine soon
to be free of patent rights to relieve them. "No monopoly," was their cry, nor were they without
strong support, for Edmund Burke pleaded the cause of his mining constituents near Bristol.[2]

We need not follow the discussion that ensued upon the propriety of granting the patent extension.
Suffice to say it was finally granted for a term of twenty-four years, and the path was clear
at last. Britain was to have probably for the first time great works and new tools specially
designed for a specialty to be produced upon a large scale. Boulton had arranged to pay Roebuck
$5,000 out of the first profits from the patent in addition to the $6,000 of debt cancelled.
He now anticipated payment of the thousand, at the urgent request of Roebuck's assignees, giving
in so doing pretty good evidence of his faith in prompt returns from the engines, for which
orders came pouring in. New mechanical facilities followed, as well as a supply of skilled
mechanics.

The celebrated Wilkinson now appears upon the scene, first builder of iron boats, and a leading
iron-founder of his day, an original Captain of Industry of the embryonic type, who began working
in a forge for three dollars a week. He cast a cylinder eighteen inches in diameter, and invented
a boring machine which bored it accurately, thus remedying one of Watt's principal difficulties.
This cylinder was substituted for the tin-lined cylinder of the triumphant Kinneil engine.
Satisfactory as were the results of the engine before, the new cylinder improved upon these
greatly. Thus Wilkinson was pioneer in iron ships, and also in ordering the first engine built
at Soho--truly an enterprising man. Great pains were taken by Watt that this should be perfect,
as so much depended upon a successful start. Many concerns suspended work upon Newcomen engines,
countermanded orders, or refrained from placing them, awaiting anxiously the performance of
this heralded wonder, the Watt engine. As it approached completion, Watt became impatient to
test its powers, but the prudent, calm Boulton insisted that not one stroke be made until every
possible hindrance to successful working had been removed. He adds, "then, in the name of God,
fall to and do your best." Admirable order of battle! It was "Be sure you're right, then go
ahead," in the vernacular. Watt acted upon this, and when the trial came the engines worked
"to the admiration of all." The news of this spread rapidly. Enquiries and orders for engines
began to flow in. No wonder when we read that of thirty engines of former makers in one coal-mining
district only eighteen were at work. The others had failed. Boulton wrote Watt to

    tell Wilkinson to get a dozen cylinders cast and bored ... I
    have fixed my mind upon making from twelve to fifteen
    reciprocating engines and fifty rotative engines per annum. Of
    all the toys and trinkets we manufacture at Soho, none shall
    take the place of fire-engines in respect of my attention.

The captain was on deck, evidently. Sixty-five engines per year--prodigious for these days--nothing
like this was ever heard of before. Two thousand per year is the record of one firm in Philadelphia
to-day, but let us boast not. Perhaps one hundred and twenty-nine years hence will have as
great a contrast to show. The day of small factories, as of small nations, is past. Increasing
magnitude, to which it is hard to set a limit, is the order of the day.

So far all was well, the heavy clouds that had so long hovered menacingly over Boulton and
Watt had been displaced once more by clear skies. But no new machinery or new manufacturing
business starts without accidents, delays and unexpected difficulties. There was necessarily
a long period of trial and disappointment for which the sanguine partners were not prepared.
As before, the chief trouble lay in the lack of skilled workmen, for although the few original
men in Soho were remarkably efficient, the increased demand for engines had compelled the employment
of many new hands, and the work they could perform was sadly defective. Till this time, it
is to be remembered there had been neither slide lathes, planing machines, boring tools, nor
any of the many other devices which now ensure accuracy. All depended upon the mechanics' eye
and hand, if mechanics they could be called. Most of the new hands were inexpert and much given
to drink. Specialisation had to be resorted to--one thing for each workman, in the fashioning
of which practice made perfect. This system was introduced with success, but the training of
the men took time. Meanwhile work already turned out and that in progress was not up to standard,
and this caused infinite trouble. One very important engine was "The Bow" for London, which
was shipped in September. The best of the experts, Joseph Harrison, was sent to superintend
its erection. Verbal instructions Watt would not depend upon; Harrison was supplied in writing
with detailed particulars covering every possible contingency. Constant communication between
them was kept up by letter, for the engine did not work satisfactorily, and finally Watt himself
proceeded to London in November and succeeded in overcoming the defects. Harrison's anxieties
disabled him, and Boulton wrote to Dr. Fordyce, a celebrated doctor of that day, telling him
to take good care of Harrison, "let the expense be what it will." Watt writes Boulton that
Harrison must not leave London, as "a relapse of the engine would ruin our reputation here
and elsewhere." The Bow engine had a relapse, however, which happened in this way. Smeaton,
then the greatest of the engineers, requested Boulton's London agent to take him to see the
new engine. He carefully examined it, called it a "very pretty engine," but thought it too
complicated a piece of machinery for practical use. There was apparently much to be said for
this opinion, for we clearly see that Watt was far in advance of his day in mechanical requirements.
Hence his serious difficulties in the construction of the complex engine, and in finding men
capable of doing the delicately accurate work which was absolutely indispensable for successful
working.

Before leaving, Smeaton made the engineer a gift of money, which he spent in drink. The drunken
engineman let the engine run wild, and it was thrown completely out of order. The valves--the
part of the complicated machine that required the most careful treatment--were broken. He was
dismissed, and, repairs being made, the engine worked satisfactorily at last. In Watt's life,
we meet drunkenness often as a curse of the time. We have the satisfaction of knowing that
our day is much freer from it. We have certainly advanced in the cure of this evil, for our
working-men may now be regarded as on the whole a steady sober class, especially in America,
where intemperance has not to be reckoned with.

We see the difference between the reconstructed Kinneil engine where Boulton's "mathematical
instrument maker's" standard of workmanship was possible "because his few trained men capable
of such work were employed." The Kinneil engine, complicated as it was in its parts, being
thus accurately reconstructed, did the work expected and more. The Bow engines and some others
of the later period, constructed by ordinary workmen capable only of the "blacksmith's" standard
of finish, proved sources of infinite trouble.

Watt had several cases of this kind to engross his attention, all traceable to the one root,
lack of the skilled, sober workmen, and the tools of precision which his complex (for his day,
very complex) steam engine required. The truth is that Watt's engine in one sense was born
before its time. Our class of instrument-making mechanics and several new tools should have
preceded it; then, the science of the invention being sound, its construction would have been
easy. The partners continued working in the right direction and in the right way to create
these needful additions and were finally successful, but they found that success brought another
source of annoyance. Escaping Scylla they struck Charybdis. So high did the reputation of their
chief workmen rise, that they were early sought after and tempted to leave their positions.
Even the two trained fitters sent to London to cure the Bow engine we have just spoken of were
offered strong inducements to take positions in Russia. Watt writes Boulton, May 3, 1777, that
he had just heard a great secret to the effect that Carless and Webb were probably going beyond
sea, $5,000 per year having been offered for six years. They were promptly ordered home to
Soho and warrants obtained for those who had attempted to induce them to abscond (strange laws
these days!), "even though Carless be a drunken and comparatively useless fellow." Consider
Watt's task, compelled to attempt the production of his new engines, complicated beyond the
highest existing standard, without proper tools and with such workmen as Carless, whom he was
glad to get and determined to keep, drunken and useless as he was.

French agents appeared and tried to bribe some of the men to go to Paris and communicate Watt's
plans to the contractor who had undertaken to pump water from the Seine for the supply of Paris.
The German states sent emissaries for a similar purpose, and Baron Stein was specially ordered
by his government to master the secret of the Watt engine, to obtain working plans, and bring
away workmen capable of constructing it, the first step taken being to obtain access to the
engine-rooms by bribing the workmen. All this is so positively stated by Smiles that we must
assume that he quotes from authentic records. It is clear at all events that the attention
of other nations was keenly drawn to the advent of an agency that promised to revolutionise
existing conditions. Watt himself, at a critical part of his career (1773), as we have seen,
had been tempted to accept an offer to enter the imperial service of Russia, carrying the then
munificent salary of $5,000 per annum. Boulton wrote him: "Your going to Russia staggers me....
I wish to advise you for the best without regard to self, but I find I love myself so well
that I should be very sorry to have you go, and I begin to repent sounding your trumpet at
the Ambassador's."

The imperial family of Russia were then much interested in the Soho works. The empress stayed
for some time at Boulton's house, "and a charming woman she is," writes her host. Here is a
glimpse of imperial activity and wise attention to what was going on in other lands which it
was most desirous to transplant to their own. The emperor, and no less his wife, evidently
kept their eyes open during their travels abroad. Imperial progresses we fear are seldom devoted
to such practical ends, although the present king of Britain and his nephew the German emperor
would not be blind to such things. It is a strange coincidence that the successor of this emperor,
Tsar Nicholas, when grand duke, should have been denied admission to Soho works. Not that he
was personally objected to, but that certain people of his suite might not be disinclined to
take advantage of any new processes discovered. So jealously were improvements guarded in these
days.

Another source of care to the troubled Watt lay here. Naturally, only a few such men had been
developed as could be entrusted to go to distant parts in charge of fellow-workmen and erect
the finished engines. A union of many qualities was necessary here. Managers of erection had
to be managers of men, by far the most complicated and delicate of all machinery, exceeding
even the Watt engine in complexity. When the rare man was revealed, and the engine under his
direction had proved itself the giant it was reputed, ensuring profitable return upon capital
invested in works hitherto unproductive, as it often did, the sagacious owner would not readily
consent to let the engineer leave. He could well afford to offer salary beyond the dreams of
the worker, to a rider who knew his horse and to whom the horse took so kindly. The engineer
loved his engine, the engine which he had seen grow in the shop under his direction and which
he had wholly erected.

McAndrew's Song of Steam tells the story of the engineer's devotion to
his engine, a song which only Kipling in our day could sing. The Scotch
blood of the MacDonalds was needed for that gem; Kipling fortunately has
it pure from his mother.
    Not so!

So the McAndrews of Watt's day were loth to part from their engines, this feeling being in
the blood of true engineers. On the other hand, just such men, in numbers far beyond the supply,
were needed by the builders, who in one sense were almost if not quite as deeply concerned
as the owners, in having proved, capable, engine managers remain in charge of their engines,
thus enhancing their reputation. Endless trouble ensued from the lack of managing enginemen,
a class which had yet to be developed, but which was sure to arise in time through the educative
policy adopted, which was already indeed slowly producing fruit.

Meanwhile, to meet the present situation, Watt resolved to simplify the engine, taking a step
backward, which gives foundation for Smeaton's acute criticism upon its complexity. We have
seen that the working of steam expansively was one of Watt's early inventions. Some of the
new engines were made upon this plan, which involved the adoption of some of the most troublesome
of the machinery. It was ultimately decided that to operate this was beyond the ability of
the obtainable enginemen of the day.

It must not be understood that expansion was abandoned. On the contrary, it was again introduced
by Watt at a later stage and in better form. Since his time it has extended far beyond what
he could have ventured upon under the conditions of that day. "Yet," as Kelvin says, "the triple
and quadruple expansion engine of our day all lies in the principle Watt had so fully developed
in his day."

[1] If those in London had only listened to Franklin and taken his advice when he pleaded for
British liberties for British subjects in America! It is refreshing to read in our day how
completely the view regarding colonies has changed in Britain. These are now pronounced "Independent
nations, free to go or stay in the empire, as they choose," the very surest way to prolong
the connection. This is true statesmanship. Being free, the chains become decorations and cease
to chafe the wearer, unless great growth comes, when the colony must at its maturity perforce
either merge with the motherland under one joint government or become a free and independent
nation, giving her sons a country of their own for which to live, and, if necessary, to die.

[2] The mention of Burke and Bristol so soon after the note of Boulton upon Dr. Small's passing,
recalls one of Burke's many famous sentences, one perhaps unequalled under the circumstances.
The candidate opposing him for Parliament died during the canvass. When Burke next addressed
the people after the sad event, his first words were:

    "What shadows we are; what shadows we pursue."

CHAPTER VI

REMOVAL TO BIRMINGHAM

Watt's permanent settlement in Birmingham had for some time been seen to be inevitable, all
his time being needed there. Domestic matters, including the care of his two children, with
which he had hitherto been burdened, pressed hard upon him, and he had been greatly depressed
by finding his old father quite in his dotage, although he was not more than seventy-five.
Watt was alone and very unhappy during a visit he made to Greenock.

Before returning to Birmingham, he married Miss MacGregor, daughter of a Glasgow man of affairs,
who was the first in Britain to use chlorine for bleaching, the secret of which Berthollet,
its inventor, had communicated to Watt.

Pending the marriage, it was advisable that the partnership with Boulton as hitherto agreed
upon should be executed. Watt writes so to Boulton, and the arrangement between the partners
is indicated by the following passage of Watt's letter to him:

    As you may have possibly mislaid my missive to you concerning
    the contract, I beg just to mention what I remember of the
    terms.

    1. I to assign to you two-thirds of the property of the
    invention.

    2. You to pay all expenses of the Act or others incurred before
    June, 1775 (the date of the Act), and also the expense of future
    experiments, which money is to be sunk without interest by you,
    being the consideration you pay for your share.

    3. You to advance stock-in-trade bearing interest, but having no
    claim on me for any part of that, further than my intromissions;
    the stock itself to be your security and property.

    4. I to draw one-third of the profits so soon as any arise from
    the business, after paying the workmen's wages and goods
    furnished, but abstract from the stock-in-trade, excepting the
    interest thereof, which is to be deducted before a balance is
    struck.

    5. I to make drawings, give directions, and make surveys, the
    company paying for the travelling expenses to either of us when
    upon engine business.

    6. You to keep the books and balance them once a year.

    7. A book to be kept wherein to be marked such transactions as
    are worthy of record, which, when signed by both, to have the
    force of the contract.

    8. Neither of us to alienate our share of the other, and if
    either of us by death or otherwise shall be incapacitated from
    acting for ourselves, the other of us to be the sole manager
    without contradiction or interference of heirs, executors,
    assignees or others; but the books to be subject to their
    inspection, and the acting partner of us to be allowed a
    reasonable commission for extra trouble.

    9. The contract to continue in force for twenty-five years, from
    the 1st of June, 1775, when the partnership commenced,
    notwithstanding the contract being of later date.

    10. Our heirs, executors and assignees bound to observance.

    11. In case of demise of both parties, our heirs, etc., to
    succeed in same manner, and if they all please, they may burn
    the contract.

    If anything be very disagreeable in these terms, you will find
    me disposed to do everything reasonable for your satisfaction.

Boulton's reply was entirely satisfactory, and upon this basis the arrangement was closed.

Watt, with his usual want of confidence in himself in business affairs, was anxious that Boulton
should come to him at Glasgow and arrange all pecuniary matters connected with the marriage.
Watt had faced the daughter and conquered, but trembled at the thought of facing the father-in-law.
He appeals to his partner as follows:

    I am afraid that I shall otherwise make a very bad bargain in
    money matters, which wise men like you esteem the most essential
    part, and I myself, although I be an enamoured swain, do not
    altogether despise. You may perhaps think it odd that in the
    midst of my friends here I should call for your help; but the
    fact is that from several reasons I do not choose to place that
    confidence in any of my friends here that would be necessary in
    such a case, and I do not know any of them that have more to say
    with the gentleman in question than I have myself. Besides, you
    are the only person who can give him satisfactory information
    concerning my situation.

This being impracticable, as explained by Boulton, who thoroughly approved of the union, the
partnership and Boulton's letter were accepted by the judicious father-in-law as satisfactory
evidence that his daughter's future was secure. Boulton states in his letter, July, 1776:

    It may be difficult to say what is the value of your property in
    partnership with me. However, I will give it a name, and I do
    say that I would willingly give you two, or perhaps three
    thousand pounds for your assignment of your third part of the
    Act of Parliament. But I should be sorry to make you so bad a
    bargain, or to make any bargain at all that tended to deprive me
    of your friendship, acquaintance, and assistance, hoping that we
    shall harmoniously live to wear out the twenty-five years, which
    I had rather do than gain a Nabob's fortune by being the sole
    proprietor.

This is the kind of expression from the heart to make a partner happy and resolve to do his
utmost for one who in the recipient's heart had transposed positions, and is now friend first,
and partner afterward.

The marriage took place in July, 1776. Two children were born, both of whom died in youth.
Mrs. Watt lived until a ripe old age and enjoyed the fruits of her husband's success and fame.
She died in 1832. Arago praises her, and says "Various talents, sound judgment, and strength
of mind rendered her a worthy companion."

It is difficult to realise that many yet with us were contemporaries of Mrs. Watt, and not
a few yet living were contemporaries of Watt himself, for he did not pass away until 1819,
eighty-six years ago, so much a thing of yesterday is the material development and progress
of the world, which had its basis, start and accomplishment in the steam engine.

The reasons given by Boulton for being unable to proceed to the side of his friend and partner
in Glasgow, shed clear light upon the condition of affairs at Soho. Their London agent, like
Watt, was also to be married and would be absent. Fothergill had to proceed to London. Scale,
one of the managers, was absent. Important visitors were constantly arriving. Said Boulton:

    Our copper bottom hath plagued us very much by steam leaks, and
    therefore I have had one cast (with its conducting pipe) all in
    one piece; since which the engine doth not take more than 10
    feet of steam, and I hope to reduce that quantity, as we have
    just received the new piston, which shall be put in and at work
    tomorrow. Our Soho engine never was in such good order as at
    present. Bloomfield and Willey (engines) are both well, and I
    doubt not but Bow engine will be better than any of 'em.

He concludes, "I did not sleep last night, my mind being absorbed by steam." Means for increasing
the heating surface swept through his mind, by applying "in copper spheres within the water,"
the present flue system, also for working steam expansively, "being clear the principle is sound."

To add to Boulton's anxieties, he had received a summons to attend the Solicitor-General next
week in opposition to Gainsborough, a clergyman who claimed to be the original inventor. "This
is a disagreeable circumstance, particularly at this season, when you are absent. Harrison
is in London and idleness is in our engine shop."

Watt wrote Boulton on July 28, 1776, apologising for his long absence and stating he was now
ready to return, and would start "Tuesday first" for Liverpool, where he expected to meet Boulton.
Meanwhile, the latter had been called to London by the Gainsborough business. A note from him,
however, reached Watt at Liverpool, in which he says, "As to your absence, say nothing about
it. I will forgive it this time, provided you promise me never to marry again."

In due time, Mr. and Mrs. Watt arrived and settled early in August, 1776, in Birmingham, which
was hereafter to be their permanent home, although, as we shall see, Watt never ceased to keep
in close touch with his native town of Greenock and his Glasgow friends. His heart still warmed
to the tartan, the soft, broad Scotch accent never forsook him; nor, we may be sure, did the
refrain ever leave his heart----

    And may dishonour blot our name
      And quench our household fires,
    If me or mine forget thy name,
      Thou dear land of my Sires,

Many a famous Scot has the fair South in recent times called to her--Stephenson, Ruskin, Carlyle,
Mill, Gladstone and others--but never before or since, one whose work was the transformation
of the world.

At last we have Watt permanently settled alongside the great works to which he was hereafter
to devote his rare abilities until his retirement at the expiration of the partnership in 1800.
His labors at Soho soon began to tell. The works increased their celebrity beyond all others
then known, for materials, workmanship and invention.

The mines of Cornwall promised to become unworkable; indeed, many already had became so. The
Newcomen engines could no longer drain the deepened mines. Several orders for Watt engines
had been received, and as much depended upon the success of the first, Watt resolved to superintend
its erection himself. Mrs. Watt and he started over the terrible road into Cornwall, and had
to take up their abode with the superintendent of the mine, there being no other house for
miles around. Naturally the builders and attendants of the Newcomen engine viewed Watt's invasion
of their district with no kindly feelings. Great jealousy arose and Watt's sensitive nature
was sorely tried. Many attempts to thwart him were met with, and, taken altogether, his life
in Cornwall was far from agreeable.

The engine was erected, the day of trial came, mining men, engineers, mining proprietors and
others assembled from all quarters to see the start. Many of the spectators interested in other
engines would not have shed tears had it failed, but it started splendidly making eleven eight-foot
strokes per minute, which broke the record. Three cheers for the Scotch engineer! It soon worked
with greater power and more steadily, and "forked" more water than the ordinary engines with
only about one-third the consumption of coal. Watt wrote:

    I understand all the west country captains are to be here
    tomorrow to see the prodigy. The velocity, violence, magnitude,
    and horrible noise of the engine give universal satisfaction to
    all beholders, believers or not. I have once or twice trimmed
    the engine to end the stroke gracefully and to make less noise,
    but Mr. Wilson cannot sleep without it seems quite furious, so I
    have left it to the enginemen; and, by the by, the noise seems
    to convey great ideas of its power to the ignorant, who seem to
    be no more taken with modest merit in an engine than in a man.

Well said, modest, reserved philosopher with vast horse-power in that big head of yours, working
in the closet noiselessly, driving deep but silently into the bosom of nature's secrets, pumping
her deepest mines, discovering and bringing to the surface the genius which lay in steam to
do your bidding and revolutionise life on earth! In this, the first triumph, there was recompense
for all the trials Watt and his wife had endured in Cornwall.

Readers will note that no workman had yet been developed who could be trusted to erect the
engine. The master inventor had to go himself as the mechanical genius certain to cure all
defects and ensure success. This shows how indispensable Watt was.

Orders now flowed in, and Watt was needed to prepare the plans and drawings, no one being capable
of relieving him of this. To-day we have draftsmen by the thousand to whom it would be easy
routine work, as we have thousands to whom the erection of the Watt engine would be play. Watt
was everywhere. At length he had to confess that "a very little more of this hurrying and vexation
would knock me up altogether." At this moment he had just been called to return to Cornwall
to erect the second engine. He says "I fancy I must be cut in pieces and a portion sent to
every tribe in Israel." We may picture him reciting in Falstaffian mood, "Would my name were
not so terrible to the enemy (deep-mine water) as it is. There can't a drowned-out mine peep
its head out but I'm thrust upon it. Well, well, it always was the trick of my countrymen to
make a good thing too common. Better rust to death than be scoured to nothing by this perpetual
motion."

Watt had a hard time of it in Cornwall during his next stay there, for he had to go again.
He arrives at Redruth to find many troubles.

    Forbes' eduction-pipe is a vile job, he writes, and full of
    holes. The cylinder they have cast for Chacewater is still
    worse, for it will hardly do at all. The Soho people have sent
    here Chacewater pipe instead of Wheal Union, and the gudgeon
    pipe has not arrived with the nozzles. These repeated
    disappointments will ruin our credit in the country, and I
    cannot stay here to bear the shame of such failures of promise.

It is easy for present-day captains of industry to plume themselves upon their ability to select
men sure to succeed well with any undertaking, and assume that Watt lacked the indispensable
talent for selection, but he had been driven by sad experience to trust none but himself, the
skilled workmen needed to co-operate with him not yet having been developed.

We have not touched upon another source of great anxiety to him at this time. The enterprising
Boulton would not have been the organiser he was unless blessed with a sanguine disposition
and the capacity for shedding troubles. The business was rapidly extending in many branches,
all needing capital; the engine business, promising though it was, was no exception. Little
money was yet due from sales and much had been spent developing the invention. Boulton's letter
to Watt constantly urged cash collections, while mine-owners were not disposed to pay until
further tests were made. Boulton suggested loans from Truro bankers on security of the engines,
but Watt found this impracticable. The engines were doing astonishingly well to-day, but who
could ensure their lasting qualities? Watt shows good judgment in suggesting that Wilkinson,
the famous foundryman, should be taken into partnership. He urges his enterprising partner
to apply the pruning knife and cut down expenses naively assuring him that "he was practising
all the frugality in his power." As Watt's personal expenses then were only ten dollars per
week, a smile rises at the prudent Scot's possible contribution to reduction in expenditure.
But he was on the right lines, and at least gave Boulton the benefit of example. Watt was never
disposed to look on the bright side of things, and to add to Boulton's load, the third partner,
Fothergill, was even more desponding than Watt. When Boulton went away to raise means, he was
pursued by letters from Fothergill telling him day by day of imperative needs. In one he was
of opinion that "the creditors must be called together; better to face the worst than to go
on in the neck-and-neck race with ruin." Boulton would hurry back to quiet Fothergill and keep
the ship afloat. Here he shines out resplendently. He proved equal to the emergency. His courage
and determination rose in proportion to the difficulties to be overcome, borne up by his invariable
hope and unshakable belief in the value of Watt's condensing engine, he triumphed at last,
pledging, as security for a loan of $70,000, the royalties derivable from the engine patents,
and an annuity for a loan of $35,000 more. So small a sum as $105,000 sufficed to keep afloat
the big ship laden with all their treasures.

There was a period of great depression in Britain when Boulton and Watt were thus in deep water,
and at such times credit is sensitive in the extreme. A small balance on the right side performs
wonders. This recalls to the writer how, once in the history of his own firm, credit was kept
high during a panic by using the identical sum Boulton raised, $70,000, from a reserve fund
that had been laid away and came in very opportunely at the critical time. Every single dollar
weighs a hundredfold when credit trembles in the balance. A leading nerve specialist in New
York once said that the worst malady he had to treat was the man of affairs whose credit was
suspected. His unfailing remedy was: "Call your creditors together, explain all and ask their
support. I can then do you some good, but not till then." His patients who did this found themselves
restored to vigor. They were supported by creditors and all was bright once more. The wise
doctor was sound in his advice. If the firm has neither speculated nor gambled (synonymous
terms), nor lived extravagantly, nor endorsed for others, and the business is on a solid foundation,
no people have so much at stake in sustaining it as the creditors; they will rally round it
and think more of the firm than ever, because they will see behind their money the best of
all securities--men at the helm who are not afraid and know how to meet a storm.

Boulton's timid partners no doubt were amazed that he was so blind to the dangers which they
with clearer vision saw so clearly. How deluded they were. We may be sure neither of them saw
the danger half as vividly as he, but it is not the part of a leader to reveal to his fellows
all that he sees or fears. His part is to look dangers steadily in the face and challenge them.
It is the great leader who inspires in his followers contempt for the danger which he sees
in much truer proportion than they. This Boulton did, for behind all else in his character
there lay the indomitable will, the do or die resolve. He had staked his life upon the hazard
of a die and he would stand the cost. "But if we fail," often said the timid pair to him, as
Macbeth did to his resolute partner, and the same answer came, "We fail." That's all. "One
knockdown will not finish this fight. We'll get up again, never fear. We know no such word
as fail."[1]

One source of serious trouble arose from Watt and Boulton having been so anxious at first to
introduce their engines that they paid small regard to terms. When their success was proved,
they offered to settle, taking one-third the value of the fuel saved. This was a liberal offer,
for, in addition to the mine-owners saving two-thirds of the former cost of fuel consumed by
the previous engines, mines became workable, which without the Watt engine must have been abandoned.
These terms however were not accepted, and a long series of disputes arose, ending in some
cases only with the patent-right itself. It was resolved that all future engines should be
furnished only upon the terms before stated, Watt declaring that otherwise he would not put
pen to paper to make new drawings. "Let our terms be moderate," he writes, "and, if possible,
consolidated into money a priori, and it is certain we shall get some money, enough to keep
us out of jail, in continual apprehension of which I live at present." Imprisonment for debt,
let it be remembered, had not been abolished. One of the most beneficent forward steps that
our time can boast of is the Bankruptcy Court. However hard we may yet be upon offenders against
us, society, through humane laws, forgives our debtors in money matters, and gives a clear
bill of health after honorable acquittal in bankruptcy, and a fresh start.

The result proved Watt's wisdom. His engines were needed to save the mines. No other could.
Applications came in freely upon his terms, and as Watt was a poor hand at bargaining, he insisted
that Boulton should come to Cornwall and attend to that part.

Meanwhile great attention was being paid to the works and all pertaining to the men and methods.
The firm established perhaps the first benefit society of workmen. Every one was a member and
contributed according to his earnings. Out of this fund payments were made to the sick or disabled
in varying amounts. No member of the Soho Friendly Society, except a few irreclaimable drunkards,
ever came upon the parish.

When Boulton's son came of age, seven hundred were dined. No well-behaved workman was ever
turned adrift. Fathers employed introduced their sons into the works and brought them up under
their own eye, watching over their conduct and mechanical training. Thus generation after generation
followed each other at Soho works.

On another occasion Boulton writes Watt in Cornwall, "I have thought it but respectful to give
our folks a dinner to-day. There were present Murdoch, Lawson, Pearson, Perkins, Malcom, Robert
Muir, all Scotchmen, John Bull and Wilson and self, for the engines are now all finished and
the men have behaved well and are attached to us."

Six Scotch and three English in the English works of Soho thought worthy of dining with their
employer! It was, we may be sure, a very rare occurrence in that day, but worthy of the true
captain of industry. Here is an early "invasion" from the north. We are reminded of Sir Charles
Dilke's statement in his "Greater Britain," that, in his tour round the world, he found ten
Scotchmen for every Englishman in high position. Owing, of course, to the absence of scope
at home the Scot has had to seek his career abroad.

A master-stroke this, probably the first dinner of its kind in Britain, and no doubt more highly
appreciated by the honored guests than an advance in wages. Splendid workmen do not live upon
wages alone. Appreciation felt and shown by their employer, as in this case, is the coveted reward.

We have read how Watt was much troubled in Scotland with poor mechanics. Not one good craftsman
could he then find. After seeing Soho, where the standard was much higher, he declared that
the Scotch mechanic was very much inferior; he was prejudiced against them. Murdoch, however,
the first Scot at Soho, soon eclipsed all, and no doubt under his wing other Scots gained a
trial with the result indicated. It is very significant that even in the earliest days of the
steam engine, Scotchmen should exhibit such talent for its construction, forecasting their
present pre-eminence in marine engineering.

Small wonder that the Soho works became the model for all others. The last words in Boulton's
letter, "and are attached to us," tell the story. No danger of strikes, of lockouts, or quarrels
of any kind in such establishments as that of Boulton and Watt, who proved that they in turn
were attached to their men. Mutual attachment between employers and employed is the panacea
for all troubles--yes, better than a panacea, the preventer of troubles.

After repeated calls from Watt, Boulton took the journey to Cornwall in October, 1778, although
Fothergill was again uttering lamentable prophecies of impending ruin, and the London agent
was imploring his presence there upon financial matters pressing in the extreme. Boulton succeeded
in borrowing $10,000 from Truro bankers on the security of engines erected, and settled several
disputes, getting $3,500 per year royalty for one engine and $2,000 per year for another. At
last, after nine years of arduous labor since the invention was hailed as successful, the golden
harvest so long expected began to replenish the empty treasury. The heavy liabilities, however,
remained a source of constant anxiety. No remedy could be found against "this consumption of
the purse."

Watt had again to encounter the lack of competent, sober workmen to run engines. The Highland
blood led him at last into severe measures, and he insisted upon discharging two or three of
the most drunken. Here Boulton had great difficulty in restraining him. Much had to be endured,
and occasional bouts of drunkenness overlooked, although serious accidents resulted. At last
two men appeared whose services proved invaluable--Murdoch, already mentioned, and Law--one
of whom became famous. Watt was absent when the former called and asked Boulton for employment.
The young Scot was the son of a well-known millwright near Ayr who had made several improvements.
His famous son worked with him, but being ambitious and hearing of the fame of Boulton and
Watt, he determined to seek entrance to Soho works and learn the highest order of handicraft.
Boulton had told him that there was at present no place open, but noticing the strange cap
the awkward young man had been dangling in his hands, he asked what it was made of. "Timmer,"
said the lad. "What, out of wood?" "Yes." "How was it made?" "I turned it mysel' in a bit lathey
o' my own making." This was enough for that rare judge of men. Here was a natural-born mechanic,
certain. The young man was promptly engaged for two years at fifteen shillings per week when
in shop, seventeen shillings when abroad, and eighteen shillings when in London. His history
is the usual march upward until he became his employers' most trusted manager in all their
mechanical operations. While engaged upon one critical job, where the engine had defied previous
attempts to put it to rights, the people in the house where Murdoch lodged were awakened one
night by heavy tramping in his room over-head. Upon entering, Murdoch was seen in his bed clothes
heaving away at the bed post in his sleep, calling out "Now she goes, lads, now she goes."
His heart was in his work. He had a mission, and only one--to make that engine go.

Of course he rose. There's no holding down such a "dreamer" anywhere in this world. It was
not only that he had zeal, for he had sense with it, and was not less successful in conquering
the rude Cornishmen who had baffled, annoyed and intimidated Watt. He won their hearts. His
ability did not end with curing the defects of machinery; he knew how to manage men. At first
he had to depend upon his physical powers. He was an athlete not indisposed to lead the strenuous
life. He had not been very long in Cornwall before half a dozen of the mining captains, a class
that had tormented poor, retiring and modest Watt, entered the engine-room and began their
bullying tricks on him. The Scotch blood was up, Murdoch quietly locked the door and said to
the captains, "Now then gentlemen, you shall not leave until we have settled matters once for
all." He selected the biggest Cornishman and squared off. The contest was soon over. Murdoch
vanquished the bully and was ready for the next. The captains, seeing the kind of man he was,
offered terms of peace, hands were shaken all round and they parted good friends, and remained
so. We are past that rude age. The skilled, educated manager of to-day can use no weapon so
effectively with skilled men as the supreme force of gentleness, the manner, language and action
of the educated man, even to the calm, low voice never raised to passionate pitch. He conquers
and commands others because he has command of himself.

We must not lose sight of Murdoch. In addition to his rare qualities, he possessed mechanical
genius. He was the inventor of lighting by gas, and it was he who made the first model of a
locomotive. There was no emergency with engines, no accident, no blunder, but Murdoch was called
in. We read with surprise that his wages even in 1780 were only five dollars per week. He then
modestly asked for an advance, but this was not given. A present of one hundred dollars, however,
was made to him in recognition of his unusual services. Probably the explanation of the failure
to increase his wages at the time was that, owing to the condition of the business, no rise
in wages could be made to one which would involve an advance to others. Murdoch remained loyal
to the firm, however, although invited into partnership by another. Afterward he received due
reward. He had always a strong aversion to partnership, no doubt well founded in this case,
for during many years failure seemed almost as likely as success. Watt has much to say in his
letters about "William" (Murdoch), who, more than anyone, relieved him from trouble.[2]

The bargainings with mine-owners brought on intense heartaches and broke Watt down completely.
Boulton had to go to him again in Cornwall in the autumn of 1779, and as usual succeeded in
adjusting many disputes by wise compromises with the grasping owners which Watt's strict sense
of justice had denied. Many of these had paid no royalties for years, others disputed Watt's
unerring register of fuel consumption (another of his most ingenious inventions now in general
use for many purposes), a more heinous offense in his eyes than that of non-payment. "The rascality
of man," he writes, "is almost beyond belief." He never was more despondent or more irritable
than now. No one was better aware of his weakness than himself. In short, his heartaches and
nervousness unfitted him for business. As usual, he attributed his discouragement chiefly to
his financial obligations. The firm was as hard pressed as ever. Indeed a new source of danger
had developed. Fothergill's affairs became involved, and had it not been for Boulton's capital
and credit, the firm of Boulton and Fothergill could not have maintained payment. This had
caused a drain upon their resources. Boulton sold the estate which had come to him by his wife,
and the greater part of his father's property, and mortgaged the remainder. It is evident that
the great captain had taken in hand far too many enterprises. Probably he had not heard the
new doctrine: "Put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket." He had even ventured
considerable sums in blockade running during the American Revolutionary War. It was not without
good reason, therefore, that the more cautious Scot addressed to him so many pathetic letters:
"I beg of you to attend to these money matters. I cannot rest in my bed until they have some
determinate form." Watt's inexperience in money matters caused apprehensions of ruin to arise
whenever financial measures were discussed. He was at this time utterly wretched, and Mrs.
Watt at last became anxious, long and bravely as she had hitherto borne up and striven to dispel
her husband's fears. Never before had she ventured to speak to Boulton upon the subject. She
now broke the silence and wrote him in Cornwall a touching letter, stating that her husband's
health and spirits had become much worse since Boulton had left Soho. "I know there are several
things that so prey upon his mind as to render him perfectly miserable. They never cross his
mind, but he is rendered unfit to do anything for a long time." She describes these financial
demons that torment him and begs that her writing should not be told to Watt, as it might only
add to his troubles. The appeal brings Mrs. Watt before us in a most engaging light.

A study of the problem was made upon Boulton's return and he agreed to close two departments
of the business which were so far unprofitable, thus entering upon the right path. The engine
having proved itself indispensable, the demand for it was becoming great and pressing from
various countries. To concentrate upon its manufacture was obviously the true policy. The great
captain's enterprise was not often expended upon failures, and it is with pleasure we find
that among the profitable branches which Boulton had encouraged Watt in introducing at Soho,
was the copying-press, which Watt invented in 1778, and which we use to this day. In July of
that year he writes Dr. Black that he has "lately discovered a method of copying writing instantaneously,
provided it has been written within twenty-four hours. I send you a specimen and will impart
the secret if it will be of any use to you. It enables me to copy all my business letters."
He kept this secret for two years, and in May, 1780, secured a patent after he had completed
details of the press and experimented with the ink. One hundred and fifty were made and sold.
Thirty of these went abroad. It steadily made its way. Watt, writing some thirty years later,
said it had proved so useful to him that it was well worth all the trouble of perfecting it,
even if it brought no profit.

We think of Watt and the steam engine appears. Let us however note the unobtrusive little copying-press
on the table at his side. Extremes meet here. It would be difficult to name an invention more
universally used, in all offices where man labors in any field of activity. In the list of
modest inventions of greatest usefulness, the modern copying-press must take high rank, and
this we owe entirely to Watt.

Of the same period as the copying-machine is his invention of a drying-machine for cloth, consisting
of three cylinders of copper over which the cloth must turn over and under while cylinders
are filled with steam, the cloth to be alternately wound off and on the two wooden rollers,
by which means it will pass over three cylinders in succession. This machine was erected for
Watt's father-in-law, Mr. MacGregor in Glasgow, by an ingenious mechanic, John Gardiner, often
employed by Watt in earlier years. "This I apprehend," he writes to David Brewster in 1814,
"to be the original from which such machines were made." When we consider the extent to which
such steam drying-machines are used in our day, our estimate of the credit due to Watt cannot
be small. The drying-machine is no unfit companion to the copying-machine.

Watt revisited Cornwall in 1781 to make an inspection of all the engines. Much he found needing
attention and improvement. His evenings were spent designing "road steam-carriages." This was
before the day of railroads, and the carriages were to be driven by steam over the ordinary
coach roads. He filled a quarto drawing-book with different plans for these, and covered the
idea in one of his patent specifications. Boulton suggested in 1781 that the idea of rotary
motion should be developed, which Watt had from the first regarded as of prime importance.
It was for this he had invented his original wheel engine, and in his first patent of 1769
he describes one method of securing it. It occurred to him that the ordinary engine might be
adapted to give the rotary motion. He wrote from Cornwall to Boulton: "As to the circular motion,
I will apply it as soon as I can." He prepared a model upon his return to Soho, using a crank
connected with the working-beam of the engine for that purpose, which worked satisfactorily.
There was nothing new in the crank motion; it was used on every spinning-wheel, grind-stone
and foot-lathe turned by hand, but its application to the steam-engine was new. As early as
1771, he writes:

    I have at times had my thoughts a good deal upon the subject. In
    general, it appears to me that a crank of a sufficient sweep
    will be by much the sweetest motion, and perhaps not the
    dearest, if its durability be considered ... I then resolved to
    adopt the crank ... Of this I caused a model to be made, which
    performed to satisfaction. But being then very much engaged with
    other business, I neglected to take a patent immediately, and
    having employed a blackguard of the name of Cartwright (who was
    afterward hanged), about this model, he, when in company with
    some of the same sort who worked at Wasborough's mill, and were
    complaining of its irregularities and frequent disasters, told
    them he could put them in a way to make a rotative motion which
    would not go out of order nor stun them with its noise, and
    accordingly explained to them what he had seen me do. Soon after
    which, John Steed, who was engineer at Wasborough's mill, took a
    patent for a rotative motion with a crank, and applied it to
    their engine. Suspicions arising of Cartwright's treachery, he
    was strictly questioned, and confessed his part in the
    transaction when too late to be of service to us.

Overtures were made by Wasborough to exchange patents and work together, which Watt scornfully
rejected. He writes:

    Though I am not so saucy as many of my countrymen, I have enough
    innate pride to prevent me from doing a mean action because a
    servile prudence may dictate it ... I will never meanly sue a
    thief to give me my own again unless I have nothing left behind.

His blood was up. No dealings with rascals!

July, 1781, Watt had finished his studies, went to Penryn, and swore he had "invented certain
new methods of applying the vibrating or reciprocating motion of steam or fire engines to produce
a continued rotation or circular motion round an axis or centre, and thereby to give motion
to the wheels of mills or other machines."

Watt proceeded to work out the plan of the rotary engine, stimulated by numerous inquiries
for steam engines for driving all kinds of mills. He found that "the people in London, Manchester
and Birmingham are steam-mill mad."

During many long years of trial with their financial troubles, inferior and drunken workmen,
disappointing engines, Cornish mine-owners to annoy him, it is highly probable that Watt only
found relief in retiring to his garret to gratify his passion for solving difficult mechanical
problems. We may even imagine that from his serious mission--the development of the engine--which
was ever present, he sometimes flew to the numerous less exhausting inventions for recreation,
as the weary student flies to fiction. His mind at this period seems never to have been at
rest. His voluminous correspondence constantly reveals one invention after another upon which
he was engaged. A new micrometer, a dividing screw, a new surveying-quadrant, problems for
clearing the observed distance of the moon from a star of the effects of refraction and parallax,
a drawing-machine, a copying-machine for sculpture--anything and everything he used or saw
seems immediately to have been subjected to the question: "Cannot this be improved?" usually
with a response in the affirmative.

As we have read, he had long studied the question of a locomotive steam carriage. In Muirhead's
Biography, several pages are devoted to this. In his seventh "new improvement," in his patent
of 1784, he describes "the principle and construction of steam engines which are applied to
give motion to wheel carriages for removing persons, goods, or other matter from place to place,
in which case the engines themselves must be portable." Here lay in a few words the idea from
which our railway system has sprung. Surely Edgeworth deserves to be placed among the immortals.[3]
As in the case of the steamship, however, the indispensable steam engine of Watt had to furnish
the motive power. The railroad is only the necessary smooth track upon which the steam engine
could perform its miracle. It is significant that steam power upon roads required the abandonment
of the usual highway. So we may believe is the automobile to force new roads of its own, or
to widen existing highways, rendering those safe under certain rules for speed of twenty miles
per hour, or even more, when they were intended only for eight or ten.

The reading lamp of Watt's day was a poor affair, and as he never saw an inefficient instrument
without studying its improvement, he produced a new lamp. He wrote Argand of the Argand burner
upon the subject and for a long time Watt lamps were made at the Soho works, which gave a light
surpassing in steadiness and brilliance anything of the kind that had yet appeared. He gives
four plans for lamps, "with the reservoir below and the stem as tall as you please." He also
made an instrument for determining the specific gravity of liquids, and a year after this he
"found out a method of working tubes of the elastic resin without dissolving it." The importance
of such tubes for a thousand purposes in the arts and sciences is now appreciated.

Watt gave much time to an arithmetical machine which he found exceedingly simple to plan, but
he adds, "I have learnt by experience that in mechanics many things fall out between the cup
and the mouth." He describes what it is to accomplish, but it remained for Babbage at a much
later date to perfect the machine. A machine for copying sculpture amused him for a time but
it was never finished.

If any difficulty of a mechanical nature arose, people naturally turned to Watt for a solution.
Thus the Glasgow University failed to get pipes for conveying water across the Clyde to stand,
the channel of the river being covered with mud and shifty sand, full of inequalities, and
subject to the pressure of a considerable body of water. Application was at last made to the
recognised genius. If he could not solve it, who could? This was just one of the things that
Watt liked to do. He promptly devised an articulated suction pipe with parts formed on the
principle of a lobster's tail. This crustacean tube a thousand feet long solved the matter.
Watt stated that his services were induced solely by a desire to be of use in procuring good
water to the city of Glasgow, and to promote the prosperity of a company which had risked so
much for the public good. These were handsomely acknowledged by the presentation to him of
a valuable piece of plate.

As another proof of Watt's habit of thinking of everything that could possibly be improved,
it may be news to many readers that the consumption of the smoke from steam engines early attracted
his attention, and that he patented devices for this. These have been substantially followed
in the numerous attempts which have been made from time to time to reduce the huge volumes
of smoke that keep so many cities under a cloud. He was successful and his son James writes
to him in 1790 from Manchester:

    It is astonishing what an impression the smoke-consuming power
    of the engine has made upon everybody hereabouts. They scarcely
    trusted to the evidence of their senses. You would be diverted
    to hear the strange hypotheses which have been stated to account
    for it.

This is all very well. It is certain that most of the smoke made in manufacturing concerns
can be consumed, if manufacturers are compelled by law to erect sufficient heating surface
and to include the well-known appliances, including those for careful firing, but no city so
far as the writer knows has ever been able to enforce effective laws. There remain the dwellings
of the people to deal with, which give forth smoke in large cities in the aggregate far exceeding
that made by the manufacturing plants. New York pursues the only plan for ensuring the clearest
skies of any large city in the world where coal is generally used, by making the use of bituminous
coal unlawful. The enormous growth of present New York (45 per cent. in last decade) is not
a little dependent upon the attraction of clear blue sides and the resulting cleanliness of
all things in and about the city compared with others. When, by the progress of invention or
new methods of distributing heat, smoke is banished, as it probably will be some day, many
rich citizens will remain in their respective western cities instead of flocking to the clear
blue-skied metropolis, as they are now so generally doing.

Such were some of Watt's by-products. His recreation, if found at all, was found in change
of occupation. We read of no idle days, no pleasure trips, no vacations, only change of work.

Rumors of new inventions of engines far excelling his continued to disturb Watt, and much of
his time was given to investigation. He thought of a caloric air engine as possibly one of
the new ideas; then of the practicability of producing mechanical power by the absorption and
condensation of gas on the one hand and by its disengagement and expansion on the other. His
mind seemed to range over the entire field of possibilities.

The Hornblower engine had been heralded as sure to displace the Watt. When it was described,
it proved to be as Watt said, "no less than our double-cylinder engine, worked upon our principle
of expansion. It is fourteen years since I mentioned it to Mr. Smeaton." Watt had explained
to Dr. Small his method of working steam expansively as early as May, 1769, and had adopted
it in the Soho engine and also in the Shadwell engine erected in that year.

We have seen before that Watt had to retrace his steps and abandon for a time in later engines
what he had before ventured upon.

The application of steam for propelling boats upon the water was, at this time (1788), attracting
much attention. Boulton and Watt were urged to undertake experiments. This they declined to
entertain, having their facilities fully employed in their own field, but finally Fulton, on
August 6, 1803, ordered an engine from them from his own drawings, intended for this purpose,
repeating the order in person in 1804. It was shipped to America early in 1805, and in 1807
placed upon the Clermont, which ran upon the Hudson River as a passenger boat, attaining a
speed of about five miles an hour. This was the first steamboat that was ever used for passengers,
and altho Fulton neither invented the boat nor the engine, nor the combination of the two,
still he is entitled to great credit for overcoming innumerable difficulties sufficient to
discourage most men. Fulton, who was the son of a Scotsman from Dumfrieshire, visited Syminton's
steamboat, the Charlotte Dundas, in Scotland, in 1801, and had seen it successfully towing
canal boats upon the Forth and Clyde Canal. This was the first boat ever propelled by steam
successfully for commercial purposes. It was subsequently discarded, not because it did not
tow the canal boats, but because the revolving paddle-wheels caused waves that threatened to
wash away the canal banks.

Several engines were sent to New York. The men in charge of one found on shipboard a pattern-maker
going to America named John Hewitt. He settled in America January 12th, 1796, and became the
father of the late famous and deeply lamented Hon. Abram S. Hewitt, long a member of Congress
and afterward mayor of New York, foremost in many improvements in the city, the last being
the Subway, just opened, which owes its inception to him. For this service, the Chamber of
Commerce presented him with a memorial medal. Mr. Hewitt married a daughter of Peter Cooper,
founder of the Cooper Institute, which owes its wonderful development chiefly to him. His children
devote themselves and their fortunes to its management. At the time of his death in 1902, he
was pronounced "the first private citizen of the Republic." Small engine-shops (of which the
ruins still remain), called "Soho" after their prototype, were erected by his father near New
York city, on the Greenwood division of the Erie Railroad. The railroad station was called
"Soho" by Mr. Abram S. Hewitt, who was then president of the railroad company. Upon Mr. Hewitt's
eightieth birthday congratulations poured in from all quarters. One cable from abroad attracted
attention as appropriate and deserved: "Ten octaves every note truly struck and grandly sung."
No man in private life passed away in our day with such general lamentation. The Republic got
even more valuable material than engines from the old home in the ship that arrived on January
12, 1796.

We must not permit ourselves to forget that it was not until the Watt engine was applied to
steam navigation that the success of the latter became possible. It was only by this that it
could be made practicable, so that the steamship is the product of the steam-engine, and it
is to Watt we owe the modern twenty-three-thousand-ton monster (and larger monsters soon to
come), which keeps its course against wind and tide, almost "unshaked of motion," for this
can now properly be said. Passengers crossing the Atlantic from port to port now scarcely know
anything of irregular motion, and never more than the gentlest of slight heaves, even during
the gale that

    "Catches the ruffian billows by their tops,
    Curling their monstrous heads."

The ocean, traversed in these ships, is a smooth highway--nothing but a ferry--and a week spent
upon it has become perhaps the most enjoyable and the most healthful of holiday excursions,
provided the prudent excursionist has left behind positive instructions that wireless telegrams
shall not follow.

[1] Perhaps there is no instance so striking as this of the immense difference that sometimes
lies in the mere accent given one monosyllable. Until Mrs. Siddons revealed the real Lady Macbeth,
every actress had replied, "We fail?" interrogatively, and then encouragingly, "Screw your
courage to the sticking-point and we'll not fail." Such the commonplace reciters. When genius
touched the word it flashed and sparkled. Then came the prompt response. "We fail." She was
of such stuff as meets failure without fear. For this revelation the actress becomes immortal,
since her name is linked with the greatest son of time. One word did it, nay a new accent upon
a monosyllable--a trifling change say you? "I make it a rule never to mind trifles," said a
great man. "So should I if I could only tell what were trifles," said a greater. One is far
on if he can predict consequences that may flow from one kind word or the intonation of a word.
Fortune sometimes hangs upon a glance or nod of kindly recognition as we pass.

[2] An American Murdoch was found in Captain Jones, the best manager of works of his day. He
entered the service of the Carnegie Steel Company as a young mechanic at two dollars per day,
a perfect copy of Murdoch in many important respects. Reading Murdoch's history, we have found
ourselves substituting the "captain," a title well earned on the field in the war for the Union,
which he entered as a private. Once he was offered an interest in the firm, which would have
made him one of the band of young millionaires. His reply was, "Thank you, don't want to have
anything to do with business. These works (Steel rail mills, Pittsburg) give me enough to think
of. You just give me a 'thundering salary.'" "All right, Captain, the salary of the president
of the United States is yours." Also like Murdoch, he was an inventor. His principal invention,
recently sustained by the Supreme Court, would easily yield from those who appropriated it
and refused payment, at least five millions of dollars in royalties. Captain Jones was born
in Pennsylvania of Welsh parents. Murdoch won promotion at last, and was first superintendent
of one of the special departments, and later had general supervision of the mechanical department,
becoming "the right hand man" of the firm. The young partners dealt generously with him, and
treated him with reverence and affection to the end. He died in his eighty-fifth year. Captain
Jones was injured at the works and passed away just as a touch of age came upon him, as many
war veterans did. Fortunate is the firm that discovers a William Murdoch or a William Jones,
and gives him swing to do the work of an original in his own way.

[3] Since the above was put in type I learn that in his forthcoming book upon "The Development
of the Locomotive," which promises to become the standard, Mr. Angus Sinclair says: "The first
suggestion of a railroad for goods transportation appears to have been made before The Literary
and Philosophical Society of Newcastle by a Mr Thomas, of Denton, in February, 1800. Two years
later Richard Edgeworth, father of the famous novelist, suggested that it should be extended
for the carrying of passengers." There is no record of Thomas's suggestion, as far as we know,
but only tradition. Even if made, however, it seems to have lain dead. Edgeworth evidently
knew nothing of it, and as it was his letter to Watt which seems first to have attracted public
attention, the passage is allowed to stand as written.

CHAPTER VII

SECOND PATENT

The number and activity of rivals attracted to the steam engine and its possible improvement,
some of whom had begun infringements upon the Watt patents, alarmed Messrs. Watt and Boulton
so much that they decided Watt should apply for another patent, covering his important improvements
since the first. Accordingly, October 25, 1781, the patent (already referred to on p. 91) was
secured, "for certain new methods of producing a continued rotative motion around an axis or
centre, and thereby to give motion to the wheels of mills or other machines."

This patent was necessary in consequence of the difficulties experienced in working the steam
wheels or rotatory engines described in the first patent of 1769, and by Watt's having been
so unfairly anticipated, by Wasborough in the crank motion.

No less than five different methods for rotatory motion are described in the patent, the fifth
commonly known as the "sun and planet wheels," of which Watt writes to Boulton, January 3, 1782,

    I have tried a model of one of my old plans of rotative engines,
    revived and executed by Mr. Murdoch, which merits being
    included in the specification as a fifth method; for which
    purpose I shall send a drawing and description next post. It has
    the singular property of going twice round for each stroke of
    the engine, and may be made to go oftener round, if required,
    without additional machinery.

Then followed an explanation of the sketch which he sent, and two days later he wrote, "I send
you the drawings of the fifth method, and thought to have sent you the description complete,
but it was late last night before I finished so far, and to-day have a headache, therefore
only send you a rough draft of part."

In all of these Watt recommended that a fly-wheel be used to regulate the motion, but in the
specification for the patent of the following year, 1782, his double-acting engine produced
a more regular motion and rendered a fly-wheel unnecessary, "so that," he says, "in most of
our great manufactories these engines now supply the place of water, wind and horse mills,
and instead of carrying the work to the power, the prime agent is placed wherever it is most
convenient to the manufacturer."

This marks one of the most important stages in the development of the steam engine. It was
at last the portable machine it remains to-day, and was placed wherever convenient, complete
in itself and with the rotative motion adaptable for all manner of work. The ingenious substitutes
Watt had to invent to avoid the obviously perfect crank motion have of course all been discarded,
and nothing of these remains except as proofs, where none are needed, that genius has powers
in reserve for emergencies; balked in one direction, it hews out another path for itself.

While preparing the specification for this patent of 1781, Watt was busy upon another specification
quite as important, which appeared in the following year, 1782. It embraced the following new
improvements, the winnowing of numberless ideas and experiments that he had conceived and tested
for some years previous:

    1. The use of steam on the expansive principle; together with
    various methods or contrivances (six in number, some of them
    comprising various modifications), for equalising the expansive
    power.

    2. The double-acting engine; in which steam is admitted to press
    the piston upward as well as downward; the piston being also
    aided in its ascent as well as in its descent by a vacuum
    produced by condensation on the other side.

    3. The double-engine; consisting of two engines, primary and
    secondary, of which the steam-vessels and condensers communicate
    by pipes and valves, so that they can be worked either
    independently or in concert; and make their strokes either
    alternately or both together, as may be required.

    4. The employment of a toothed rack and sector, instead of
    chains, for guiding the piston-rod.

    5. A rotative engine, or steam-wheel.

Here we have three of the vital elements required toward the completion of the work: first,
steam used expansively; second, the double-acting engine. It will be remembered that Watt's
first engines only took in steam at the bottom of the cylinder, as Newcomen's did, but with
this difference: Watt used the steam to perform work which Newcomen could not do, the latter
only using steam to force the piston itself upward. Now came Watt's great step forward. Having
a cylinder closed at the top, while the Newcomen cylinder remained open, it was as easy to
admit steam at the top to press the piston down as to admit it at the bottom to press the piston
up; also as easy to apply his condenser to the steam above as below, at the moment a vacuum
was needed. All this was ingeniously provided for by numerous devices and covered by the patent.
Third, he went one step farther to the compound engine, consisting of two engines, primary
and secondary, working steam expansively independently or in concert, with strokes alternate
or simultaneous. The compound engine was first thought of by Watt about 1767. He laid a large
drawing of it on parchment before parliament when soliciting an extension of his first patent.
The reason he did not proceed to construct it was "the difficulty he had encountered in teaching
others the construction and use of the single engine, and in overcoming prejudices"; the patent
of 1782 was only taken out because he found himself "beset with a host of plagiaries and pirates."

One of the earliest of these double-acting engines was erected at the Albion Mills, London,
in 1786. Watt writes:

    The mention of Albion Mills induces me to say a few words
    respecting an establishment so unjustly calumniated in its day,
    and the premature destruction of which, by fire, in 1791, was,
    not improbably, imputed to design. So far from being, as
    misrepresented, a monopoly injurious to the public, it was the
    means of considerably reducing the price of flour while it
    continued at work.

The "double-acting" engine was followed by the "compound" engine, of which Watt says:

    A new compound engine, or method of connecting together the
    cylinders and condensers of two or more distinct engines, so as
    to make the steam which has been employed to press on the piston
    of the first, act expansively upon the piston of the second,
    etc., and thus derive an additional power to act either
    alternately or co-jointly with that of the first cylinder.

We have here, in all substantial respects, the modern engine of to-day.

Two fine improvements have been made since Watt's time: first, the piston-rings of Cartwright,
which effectively removed one of Watt's most serious difficulties, the escape of steam, even
though the best packing he could devise were used--the chief reason he could not use high-pressure
steam. In our day, the use of this is rapidly extending, as is that of superheated steam. Packing
the piston was an elaborate operation even after Watt's day.

It was not because Watt did not know as well as any of our present experts the advantages of
high pressures, that he did not use them, but simply because of the mechanical difficulties
then attending their adoption. He was always in advance of mechanical practicalities rather
than behind, and as we have seen, had to retrace his steps, in the case of expansion.

The other improvement is the cross-head of Haswell, an American, a decided advance, giving
the piston rod a smooth and straight bed to rest upon and freeing it from all disturbance.
The drop valve is now displacing the slide valve as a better form of excluding or admitting steam.

Watt of course knew nothing of the thermo-dynamic value of high temperature without high pressure,
altho fully conversant with the value of pressures. This had not been even imagined by either
philosopher or engineer until discovered by Carnot as late as 1824. Even if he had known about
it the mechanical arts in his day were in no condition to permit its use. Even high pressures
were impracticable to any great extent. It is only during the past few years that turbines
and superheating, having long been practically discarded, show encouraging signs of revival.
They give great promise of advancement, the hitherto insuperable difficulties of lubrication
and packing having been overcome within the last five years. Superheating especially promises
to yield substantial results as compared with the practice with ordinary engines, but the margin
of saving in steam over the best quadruple expansion engine cannot be great. Lord Kelvin however
expects it to be the final contribution of science to the highest possible economy in the steam
engine.

In the January (1905) number of "Stevens Institute Indicator," Professor Denton has an instructive
résumé of recent steam engine economics. He tells us that Steam Turbines are now being applied
to Piston Engines to operate with the latter's exhaust, to effect the same saving as the sulphur
dioxide cylinder; and adds

    that the Turbine is a formidable competitor to the Piston Engine
    is mainly due to the fact that it more completely realizes the
    expansive principle enunciated in the infancy of steam history
    as the fundamental factor of economy by its sagacious founder,
    the immortal Watt.

Watt's favorite employment in Soho works late in 1783 and early in 1784 was to teach his engine,
now become as docile as it was powerful, to work a tilt hammer. In 1777 he had written Boulton that

    Wilkinson wants an engine to raise a stamp of 15 cwt. thirty or
    forty times in a minute. I have set Webb to work to try it with
    the little engine and a stamp-hammer of 60 lbs. weight. Many of
    these battering rams will be wanted if they answer.

The trial was successful. A new machine to work a 700 lbs. hammer for Wilkinson was made, and
April 27, 1783, Watt writes that

    it makes from 15 to 50, and even 60, strokes per minute, and
    works a hammer, raised two feet high, which has struck 300 blows
    per minute.

The engine was to work two hammers, but was capable of working four of 7 cwt. each. He says,
with excusable pride,

    I believe it is a thing never done before, to make a hammer of
    that weight make 300 blows per minute; and, in fact, it is more
    a matter to brag of than for any other use, as the rate wanted
    is from 90 to 100 blows, being as quick as the workmen can
    manage the iron under it.

This most ingenious application of steam power was included in Watt's next patent of April
28, 1784. It embraced many improvements, mostly, however, now of little consequence, the most
celebrated being "parallel motion," of which Watt was prouder than any other of his triumphs.
He writes to his son, November, 1808, twenty-four years after it was invented (1784):

    Though I am not over anxious after fame, yet I am more proud of
    the parallel motion than of any other mechanical invention I
    have ever made.

He wrote Boulton, in June, 1784:

    I have started a new hare. I have got a glimpse of a method of
    causing a piston-rod to move up and down perpendicularly, by
    only fixing it to a piece of iron upon the beam ... I think it
    one of the most ingenious simple pieces of mechanism I have
    contrived.

October, 1784, he writes:

    The new central perpendicular motion answers beyond expectation,
    and does not make the shadow of a noise.

He says:

    When I saw it in movement, it afforded me all the pleasure of a
    novelty, as if I had been examining the invention of another.

When beam-engines were universally used for pumping, this parallel motion was of great advantage.
It has been superseded in our day, by improved piston guides and cross-heads, the construction
of which in Watt's day was impossible, but no invention has commanded in greater degree the
admiration of all who comprehend the principles upon which it acts, or who have witnessed the
smoothness, orderly power and "sweet simplicity" of its movements. Watt's pride in it as his
favorite invention in these respects is fully justified.

A detailed specification for a road steam-carriage concludes the claims of this patent, but
the idea of railroads, instead of common roads, coming later left the construction of the locomotive
to Stephenson.[1]

Watt's last patent bears date June 14, 1785, and was

    for certain newly improved methods of constructing furnaces or
    fire-places for heating, boiling, or evaporating of water and
    other liquids which are applicable to steam engines and other
    purposes, and also for heating, melting, and smelting of metals
    and their ores, whereby greater effects are produced from the
    fuel, and the smoke is in a great measure prevented or consumed.

The principle, "an old one of my own," as Watt says, is in great part acted upon to-day.

So numerous were the improvements made by Watt at various periods, which greatly increased
the utility of his engine, it would be in vain to attempt a detailed recital of his endless
contrivances, but we may mention as highly important, the throttle-valve, the governor, the
steam-gauge and the indicator. Muirhead says:

    The throttle-valve is worked directly by the engineer to start
    or stop the engine, and also to regulate the supply of steam.
    Watt describes it as a circular plate of metal, having a spindle
    fixed across its diameter, the plate being accurately fitted to
    an aperture in a metal ring of some thickness, through the
    edgeway of which the spindle is fitted steam-tight, and the ring
    fixed between the two flanches of the joint of the steam-pipe
    which is next to the cylinder. One end of the spindle, which has
    a square upon it, comes through the ring, and has a spanner
    fixed upon it, by which it can be turned in either direction.
    When the valve is parallel to the outsides of the ring, it shuts
    the opening nearly perfectly; but when its plane lies at an
    angle to the ring, it admits more or less steam according to the
    degree it has opened; consequently the piston is acted upon with
    more or less force.

Papin preferred gunpowder as a safer source of power than steam, but that was before it had
been automatically regulated by the "Governor." The governor has always been the writer's favorite
invention, probably because it was the first he fully understood. It is an application of the
centrifugal principle adapted and mechanically improved. Two heavy revolving balls swing round
an upright rod. The faster the rod revolves the farther from it the balls swing out. The slower
it turns the closer the balls fall toward it. By proper attachments the valve openings admitting
steam are widened or narrowed accordingly. Thus the higher speed of the engine, the less steam
admitted, the slower the speed the more steam admitted. Hence any uniform speed desired can
be maintained: should the engine be called upon to perform greater service at one moment than
another, as in the case of steel rolling mills, speed being checked when the piece of steel
enters the rolls, immediately the valves widen, more steam rushes into the engine, and vice
versa. Until the governor came regular motion was impossible--steam was an unruly steed.

Arago describes the steam-gauge thus:

    It is a short glass tube with its lower end immersed in a
    cistern of mercury, which is placed within an iron box screwed
    to the boiler steam-pipe, or to some other part communicating
    freely with the steam, which, pressing on the surface of the
    mercury in the cistern, raises the mercury in the tube (which is
    open to the air at the upper end), and its altitude serves to
    show the elastic power of the steam over that of the atmosphere.

The indicator he thus describes:

    The barometer being adapted only to ascertain the degree of
    exhaustion in the condenser where its variations were small, the
    vibrations of the mercury rendered it very difficult, if not
    impracticable, to ascertain the state of the exhaustion of the
    cylinder at the different periods of the stroke of the engine;
    it became therefore necessary to contrive an instrument for that
    purpose that should be less subject to vibration, and should
    show nearly the degree of exhaustion in the cylinder at all
    periods. The following instrument, called the Indicator, is
    found to answer the end sufficiently. A cylinder about an inch
    diameter, and six inches long, exceedingly truly bored, has a
    solid piston accurately fitted to it, so as to slide easy by the
    help of some oil; the stem of the piston is guided in the
    direction of the axis of the cylinder, so that it may not be
    subject to jam, or cause friction in any part of its motion. The
    bottom of this cylinder has a cock and small pipe joined to it
    which, having a conical end, may be inserted in a hole drilled
    in the cylinder of the engine near one of the ends, so that, by
    opening the small cock, a communication may be effected between
    the inside of the cylinder and the indicator.

    The cylinder of the indicator is fastened upon a wooden or
    metal frame, more than twice its own length; one end of a spiral
    steel spring, like that of a spring steel-yard, is attached to
    the upper part of the frame, and the other end of the spring is
    attached to the upper end of the piston-rod of the indicator.
    The spring is made of such a strength, that when the cylinder of
    the indicator is perfectly exhausted, the pressure of the
    atmosphere may force its piston down within an inch of its
    bottom. An index being fixed to the top of its piston-rod, the
    point where it stands, when quite exhausted, is marked from an
    observation of a barometer communicating with the same exhausted
    vessel, and the scale divided accordingly.

Improvements come in many ways, sometimes after much thought and after many experimental failures.
Sometimes they flash upon clever inventors, but let us remember this is only after they have
spent long years studying the problem. In the case of the steam engine, however, a quite important
improvement came very curiously. Humphrey Potter was a lad employed to turn off and on the
stop cocks of a Newcomen engine, a monotonous task, for, at every stroke one had to be turned
to let steam into the boiler and another for injecting the cold water to condense it, and this
had to be done at the right instant or the engine could not move. How to relieve himself from
the drudgery became the question. He wished time to play with the other boys whose merriment
was often heard at no great distance, and this set him thinking. Humphrey saw that the beam
in its movements might serve to open and shut these stop cocks and he promptly began to attach
cords to the cocks and then tied them at the proper points to the beam, so that ascending it
pulled one cord and descending the other. Thus came to us perhaps not the first automatic device,
but no doubt the first of its kind that was ever seen there. The steam engine henceforth was
self-attending, providing itself for its own supply of steam and for its condensation with
perfect regularity. It had become in this feature automatic.

The cords of Potter gave place to vertical rods with small pegs which pressed upward or downward
as desired. These have long since been replaced by other devices, but all are only simple modifications
of a contrivance devised by the mere lad whose duty it was to turn the stop cocks.

It would be interesting to know the kind of man this precocious boy inventor became, or whether
he received suitable reward for his important improvement. We search in vain; no mention of
him is to be found. Let us, however, do our best to repair the neglect and record that, in
the history of the steam engine, Humphrey Potter must ever be honorably associated with famous
men as the only famous boy inventor.

In the development of the steam engine, we have one purely accidental discovery. In the early
Newcomen engines, the head of the piston was covered by a sheet of water to fill the spaces
between the circular contour of the movable piston and the internal surface of the cylinder,
for there were no cylinder-boring tools in those days, and surfaces of cylinders were most
irregular. To the surprise of the engineer, the engine began one day working at greatly increased
speed, when it was found that the piston-head had been pierced by accident and that the cold
water had passed in small drops into the cylinder and had condensed the steam, thus rapidly
making a more perfect vacuum. From this accidental discovery came the improved plan of injecting
a shower of cold water through the cylinder, the strokes of the engine being thus greatly increased.

The year 1783 was one of Watt's most fruitful years of the dozen which may be said to have
teemed with his inventions. His celebrated discovery of the composition of water was published
in this year. The attempts made to deprive him of the honor of making this discovery ended
in complete failure. Sir Humphrey Davy, Henry, Arago, Liebig, and many others of the highest
authority acknowledged and established Watt's claims.

The true greatness of the modest Watt was never more finely revealed than in his correspondence
and papers published during the controversy. Watt wrote Dr. Black, April 21st, that he had
handed his paper to Dr. Priestley to be read at the Royal Society. It contained the new idea
of water, hitherto considered an element and now discovered to be a compound. Thus was announced
one of the most wonderful discoveries found in the history of science. It was justly termed
the beginning of a new era, the dawn of a new day in physical chemistry, indeed the real foundation
for the new system of chemistry, and, according to Dr. Young, "a discovery perhaps of greater
importance than any single fact which human ingenuity has ascertained either before or since."
What Newton had done for light Watt was held to have done for water. Muirfield well says:

    It is interesting in a high degree to remark that for him who
    had so fully subdued to the use of man the gigantic power of
    steam it was also reserved to unfold its compound natural and
    elemental principles, as if on this subject there were to be
    nothing which his researches did not touch, nothing which they
    touched that they did not adorn.

Arago says:

    In his memoir of the month of April, Priestley added an
    important circumstance to those resulting from the experiments
    of his predecessors: he proved that the weight of the water
    which is deposited upon the sides of the vessel, at the instant
    of the detonation of the oxygen and hydrogen, is precisely the
    same as the weights of the two gases.

Watt, to whom Priestley communicated this important result, immediately perceived that proof
was here afforded that water was not a simple body. Writing to his illustrious friend, he asks:

    What are the products of your experiment? They are water,
    light and heat. Are we not, thence, authorised to conclude
    that water is a compound of the two gases, oxygen and hydrogen,
    deprived of a portion of their latent or elementary heat; that
    oxygen is water deprived of its hydrogen, but still united to
    its latent heat and light? If light be only a modification of
    heat, or a simple circumstance of its manifestation, or a
    component part of hydrogen, oxygen gas will be water deprived of
    its hydrogen, but combined with latent heat.

This passage, so clear, so precise, and logical, is taken from a letter of Watt's, dated April
26, 1783. The letter was communicated by Priestley to several of the scientific men in London,
and was transmitted immediately afterward to Sir Joseph Banks, the President of the Royal Society,
to be read at one of the meetings of that learned body.

Watt had for many years entertained the opinion that air was a modification of water. He writes
Boulton, December 10, 1782:

    You may remember that I have often said, that if water could be
    heated red-hot or something more, it would probably be converted
    into some kind of air, because steam would in that case have
    lost all its latent heat, and that it would have been turned
    solely into sensible heat, and probably a total change of the
    nature of the fluid would ensue.

A month after he hears of Priestley's experiments, he writes Dr. Black (April 21, 1783) that
he "believes he has found out the cause of the conversion of water into air." A few days later,
he writes to Dr. Priestley:

    In the deflagration of the inflammable and dephlogisticated
    airs, the airs unite with violence--become red-hot--and, on
    cooling, totally disappear. The only fixed matter which remains
    is water; and water, light, and heat, are all the
    products. Are we not then authorised to conclude that water is
    composed of dephlogisticated and inflammable air, or phlogiston,
    deprived of part of their latent heat; and that
    dephlogisticated, or pure air, is composed of water deprived of
    its phlogiston, and united to heat and light; and if light be
    only a modification of heat, or a component part of phlogiston,
    then pure air consists of water deprived of its phlogiston and
    of latent heat?

It appears from the letter to Dr. Black of April 21st, that Mr. Watt had, on that day, written
his letter to Dr. Priestley, to be read by him to the Royal Society, but on the 26th he informs
Mr. DeLuc, that having observed some inaccuracies of style in that letter, he had removed them,
and would send the Doctor a corrected copy in a day or two, which he accordingly did on the
28th; the corrected letter (the same that was afterward embodied verbatim in the letter to
Mr. DeLuc, printed in the Philosophical Transactions), being dated April 26th. In enclosing
it, Mr. Watt adds, "As to myself, the more I consider what I have said, I am the more satisfied
with it, as I find none of the facts repugnant."

Thus was announced for the first time one of the most wonderful discoveries recorded in the
history of science, startling in its novelty and yet so simple.

Watt had divined the import of Priestley's experiment, for he had mastered all knowledge bearing
upon the question, but even when this was communicated to Priestley, he could not accept it,
and, after making new experiments, he writes Watt, April 29, 1783, "Behold with surprise and
indignation the figure of an apparatus that has utterly ruined your beautiful hypothesis,"
giving a rough sketch with his pen of the apparatus employed. Mark the promptitude of the master
who had deciphered the message which the experimenter himself could not translate. He immediately
writes in reply May 2, 1783:

    I deny that your experiment ruins my hypothesis. It is not
    founded on so brittle a basis as an earthen retort, nor on its
    converting water into air. I founded it on the other facts, and
    was obliged to stretch it a good deal before it would fit this
    experiment.... I maintain my hypothesis until it shall be shown
    that the water formed after the explosion of the pure and
    inflammable airs, has some other origin.

He also writes to Mr. DeLuc on May 18th:

    I do not see Dr. Priestley's experiment in the same light that
    he does. It does not disprove my theory.... My assertion was
    simply, that air (i.e., dephlogisticated air, or oxygen,
    which was also commonly called vital air, pure air, or simple
    air) was water deprived of its phlogiston, and united to heat,
    which I grounded on the decomposition of air by inflammation
    with inflammable air, the residuum, or product of which, is only
    water and heat.

Having, by experiments of his own, fully satisfied himself of the correctness of his theory,
in November he prepared a full statement for the Royal Society, having asked the society to
withhold his first paper until he could prove it for himself by experiment. He never doubted
its correctness, but some members of the society advised that it had better be supported by facts.

When the discovery was so daring that Priestley, who made the experiments, could not believe
it and had to be convinced by Watt of its correctness, there seems little room left for other
claimants, nor for doubt as to whom is due the credit of the revelation.

Watt encountered the difficulties of different weights and measures in his studies of foreign
writers upon chemistry, a serious inconvenience which still remains with us.

He wrote Mr. Kirwan, November, 1783:

    I had a great deal of trouble in reducing the weights and
    measures to speak the same language; and many of the German
    experiments become still more difficult from their using
    different weights and different divisions of them in different
    parts of that empire. It is therefore a very desirable thing to
    have these difficulties removed, and to get all philosophers to
    use pounds divided in the same manner, and I flatter myself that
    may be accomplished if you, Dr. Priestley, and a few of the
    French experimenters will agree to it; for the utility is so
    evident, that every thinking person must immediately be
    convinced of it.

Here follows his plan: Let the

    Philosophical pound consist of 10 ounces, or 10,000 grains.
              the ounce    "    "  10 drachms or 1,000    "
              the drachm   "    "  100 grains.

    Let all elastic fluids be measured by the ounce measure of
    water, by which the valuation of different cubic inches will be
    avoided, and the common decimal tables of specific gravities
    will immediately give the weights of those elastic fluids.

    If all philosophers cannot agree on one pound or one grain, let
    every one take his own pound or his own grain; it will affect
    nothing but doses of medicines, which must be corrected as is
    now done; but as it would be much better that the identical
    pound was used by all. I would propose that the Amsterdam or
    Paris pound be assumed as the standard, being now the most
    universal in Europe: it is to our avoirdupois pound as 109 is to
    100. Our avoirdupois pound contains 7,000 of our grains, and the
    Paris pound 7,630 of our grains, but it contains 9,376 Paris
    grains, so that the division into 10,000 would very little
    affect the Paris grain. I prefer dividing the pound afresh to
    beginning with the Paris grain, because I believe the pound is
    very general, but the grain local.

    Dr. Priestley has agreed to this proposal, and has referred it
    to you to fix upon the pound if you otherwise approve of it. I
    shall be happy to have your opinion of it as soon as convenient,
    and to concert with you the means of making it universal.... I
    have some hopes that the foot may be fixed by the pendulum and a
    measure of water, and a pound derived from that; but in the
    interim let us at least assume a proper division, which from the
    nature of it must be intelligible as long as decimal arithmetic
    is used.

He afterward wrote, in a letter to Magellan:

    As to the precise foot or pound, I do not look upon it to be
    very material, in chemistry at least. Either the common English
    foot may be adopted according to your proposal, which has the
    advantage that a cubic foot is exactly 1,000 ounces,
    consequently the present foot and ounce would be retained; or a
    pendulum which vibrates 100 times a minute may be adopted for
    the standard, which would make the foot 14.2 of our present
    inches, and the cubic foot would be very exactly a bushel, and
    would weigh 101 of the present pounds, so that the present pound
    would not be much altered. But I think that by this scheme the
    foot would be too large, and that the inconvenience of changing
    all the foot measures and things depending on them, would be
    much greater than changing all the pounds, bushels, gallons,
    etc. I therefore give the preference to those plans which retain
    the foot and ounce.

The war of the standards still rages--metric, or decimal, or no change. What each nation has
is good enough for it in the opinion of many of its people. Some day an international commission
will doubtless assemble to bring order out of chaos. As far as the English-speaking race is
concerned, it seems that a decided improvement could readily be affected with very trifling,
indeed scarcely perceptible, changes. Especially is this so with money values. Britain could
merge her system with those of Canada and America, by simply making her "pound" the exact value
of the American five dollars, it being now only ten pence less; her silver coinage one and
two shillings equal to quarter- and half-dollars, the present coin to be recoined upon presentation,
but meanwhile to pass current. Weights and measures are more difficult to assimilate. Science
being world-wide, and knowing no divisions, should use uniform terms. Alas! at the distance
of nearly a century and a half we seem no nearer the prospect of a system of universal weights
and measures than in Watt's day, but Watt's idea is not to be lost sight of for all that. He
was a seer who often saw what was to come.

We have referred to the absence of holidays in Watt's strenuous life, but Birmingham was remarkable
for a number of choice spirits who formed the celebrated Lunar Society, whose members were
all devoted to the pursuit of knowledge and mutually agreeable to one another. Besides Watt
and Boulton, there were Dr. Priestley, discoverer of oxygen gas, Dr. Darwin, Dr. Withering,
Mr. Keir, Mr. Galton, Mr. Wedgwood of Wedgwood ware fame, who had monthly dinners at their
respective houses--hence the "Lunar" Society. Dr. Priestley, discoverer of oxygen, who arrived
in Birmingham in 1780, has repeatedly mentioned the great pleasure he had in having Watt for
a neighbor. He says:

    I consider my settlement at Birmingham as the happiest event in
    my life; being highly favourable to every object I had in view,
    philosophical or theological. In the former respect I had the
    convenience of good workmen of every kind, and the society of
    persons eminent for their knowledge of chemistry; particularly
    Mr. Watt, Mr. Keir, and Dr. Withering. These, with Mr. Boulton
    and Dr. Darwin, who soon left us by removing from Lichfield to
    Derby, Mr. Galton, and afterwards Mr. Johnson of Kenilworth and
    myself, dined together every month, calling ourselves the Lunar
    Society, because the time of our meeting was near the
    full-moon--in order,

as he elsewhere says,

    to have the benefit of its light in returning home.

Richard Lovell Edgeworth says of this distinguished coterie:

    By means of Mr. Keir, I became acquainted with Dr. Small of
    Birmingham, a man esteemed by all who knew him, and by all who
    were admitted to his friendship beloved with no common
    enthusiasm. Dr. Small formed a link which combined Mr. Boulton,
    Mr. Watt, Dr. Darwin, Mr. Wedgwood, Mr. Day, and myself
    together--men of very different characters, but all devoted to
    literature and science. This mutual intimacy has never been
    broken but by death, nor have any of the number failed to
    distinguish themselves in science or literature. Some may think
    that I ought with due modesty to except myself. Mr. Keir, with
    his knowledge of the world and good sense; Dr. Small, with his
    benevolence and profound sagacity; Wedgwood, with his increasing
    industry, experimental variety, and calm investigation; Boulton,
    with his mobility, quick perception, and bold adventure; Watt,
    with his strong inventive faculty, undeviating steadiness, and
    bold resources; Darwin, with his imagination, science, and
    poetical excellence; and Day with his unwearied research after
    truth, his integrity and eloquence proved altogether such a
    society as few men have had the good fortune to live with; such
    an assemblage of friends, as fewer still have had the happiness
    to possess, and keep through life.

The society continued to exist until the beginning of the century, 1800. Watt was the last
surviving member. The last reference is Dr. Priestley's dedication to it, in 1793, of one of
his works "Experiments on the Generation of Air from Water," in which he says:

    There are few things that I more regret, in consequence of my
    removal from Birmingham, than the loss of your society. It both
    encouraged and enlightened me; so that what I did there of a
    philosophical kind ought in justice to be attributed almost as
    much to you as to myself. From our cheerful meetings I never
    absented myself voluntarily, and from my pleasing recollection
    they will never be absent. Should the cause of our separation
    make it necessary for to me remove to a still greater distance
    from you, I shall only think the more, and with the more regret,
    of our past interviews.... Philosophy engrossed us wholly.
    Politicians may think there are no objects of any consequence
    besides those which immediately interest them. But objects far
    superior to any of which they have an idea engaged our
    attention, and the discussion of them was accompanied with a
    satisfaction to which they are strangers. Happy would it be for
    the world if their pursuits were as tranquil, and their projects
    as innocent, and as friendly to the best interests of mankind,
    as ours.

That the partners, Boulton and Watt, had such pleasure amid their lives of daily cares, all
will be glad to know. It was not all humdrum money-making nor intense inventing. There was
the society of gifted minds, the serene atmosphere of friendship in the high realms of mutual
regard, best recreation of all.

In 1786, quite a break in their daily routine took place. In that year Messrs. Boulton and
Watt visited Paris to meet proposals for their erecting steam engines in France under an exclusive
privilege. They were also to suggest improvements on the great hydraulic machine of Marly.
Before starting, the sagacious and patriotic Watt wrote to Boulton:

    I think if either of us go to France, we should first wait upon
    Mr. Pitt (prime minister), and let him know our errand thither,
    that the tongue of slander may be silenced, all undue suspicion
    removed, and ourselves rendered more valuable in his eyes,
    because others desire to have us!

They had a flattering reception in Paris from the ministry, who seemed desirous that they should
establish engine-works in France. This they absolutely refused to do, as being contrary to
the interests of their country. It may be feared we are not quite so scrupulous in our day.
On the other hand, refusal now would be fruitless, it has become so easy to obtain plans, and
even experts, to build machines for any kind of product in any country. Automatic machinery
has almost dispelled the need for so-called skilled labor. East Indians, Mexicans, Japanese,
Chinese, all become more or less efficient workers with a few month's experience. Manufacturing
is therefore to spread rapidly throughout the world. All nations may be trusted to develop,
and if necessary for a time protect, their natural resources as a patriotic duty. Only when
prolonged trials have been made can it be determined which nation can best and most cheaply
provide the articles for which raw material abounds.

The visit to Paris enabled Watt and Boulton to make the acquaintance of the most eminent men
of science, with whom they exchanged ideas afterward in frequent and friendly correspondence.
Watt described himself as being, upon one occasion, "drunk from morning to night with Burgundy
and undeserved praise." The latter was always a disconcerting draught for our subject; anything
but reference to his achievements for the modest self-effacing genius.

While in Paris, Berthollet told Watt of his new method of bleaching by chlorine, and gave him
permission to communicate it to his father-in-law, who adopted it in his business, together
with several improvements of Watt's invention, the results of a long series of experiments.
Watt, writing to Mr. Macgregor, April 27, 1787, says:

    In relation to the inventor, he is a man of science, a member of
    the Academy of Sciences at Paris, and a physician, not very
    rich, a very modest and worthy man, and an excellent chemist. My
    sole motives in meddling with it were to procure such reward as
    I could to a man of merit who had made an extensively useful
    discovery in the arts, and secondly, I had an immediate view to
    your interest; as to myself, I had no lucrative views
    whatsoever, it being a thing out of my way, which both my
    business and my health prevented me from pursuing further than
    it might serve for amusement when unfit for more serious
    business. Lately, by a letter from the inventor, he informs me
    that he gives up all intentions of pursuing it with lucrative
    views, as he says he will not compromise his quiet and happiness
    by engaging in business; in which, perhaps, he is right; but
    if the discovery has real merit, as I apprehend, he is certainly
    entitled to a generous reward, which I would wish for the honour
    of Britain, to procure for him; but I much fear, in the way you
    state it, that nothing could be got worth his acceptance.

France has been distinguished for men of science who have thus refrained from profiting by
their inventions. Pasteur, in our day, perhaps the most famous of all, the liver, not only
of the simple but of the ideal life, laboring for the good of humanity--service to man--and
taking for himself the simple life, free from luxury, palace, estate, and all the inevitable
cares accompanying ostentatious living. Berthollet preceded him. Like Agassiz, these gifted
souls were "too busy to make money."

In 1792, when Boulton had passed the allotted three score years and ten, and Watt was over
three score, they made a momentous decision which brought upon them several years of deep anxiety.
Fortunately the sons of the veterans who had recently been admitted to the business proved
of great service in managing the affair, and relieved their parents of much labor and many
journeys. Fortunate indeed were Watt and Boulton in their partnership, for they became friends
first and partners afterward. They were not less fortunate in each having a talented son, who
also became friends and partners like their fathers before them. The decision was that the
infringers of their patents were to be proceeded against. They had to appeal to the law to
protect their rights.

Watt met the apparently inevitable fate of inventors. Rivals arose in various quarters to dispute
his right to rank as the originator of many improvements. No reflection need be made upon most
rival claimants to inventions. Some wonderful result is conceived to be within the range of
possibility, which, being obtained, will revolutionise existing modes. A score of inventive
minds are studying the problem throughout the civilised world. Every day or two some new idea
flashes upon one of them and vanishes, or is discarded after trial. One day the announcement
comes of triumphant success with the very same idea slightly modified, the modification or
addition, slight though this may be, making all the difference between failure and success.
The man has arrived with the key that opens the door of the treasure-house. He sets the egg
on end perhaps by as obvious a plan as chipping the end. There arises a chorus of strenuous
claimants, each of whom had thought of that very device long ago. No doubt they did. They are
honest in their protests and quite persuaded in their own minds that they, and not the Watt
of the occasion, are entitled to the honor of original discovery. This very morning we read
in the press a letter from the son of Morse, vindicating his father's right to rank as the
father of the telegraph, a son of Vail, one of his collaborators, having claimed that his father,
and not Morse, was the real inventor. The most august of all bodies of men, since its decisions
overrule both Congress and President, the Supreme Court of the United States, has shown rare
wisdom from its inception, and in no department more clearly than in that regarding the rights
of inventors. No court has had such experience with patent claims, for no nation has a tithe
of the number to deal with. Throughout its history, the court has attached more and more importance
to two points: First, is the invention valuable? Second, who proved this in actual practice?
These points largely govern its decisions.

The law expenses of their suits seemed to Boulton and Watt exorbitant, even in that age of
low prices compared to our own. One solicitors bill was for no less than $30,000, which caused
Watt years afterward, when speaking of an enormous charge to say that "it would not have disgraced
a London solicitor." When we find however, that this was for four years' services, the London
solicitor appears in a different light. "In the whole affair," writes Watt to his friend Dr.
Black, January 15, 1797, "nothing was so grateful to me as the zeal of our friends and the
activity of our young men, which were unremitting."

The first trial ended June 22, 1793, with a verdict for Watt and Boulton by the jury, subject
to the opinion of the court as to the validity of the patent. On May 16, 1795, the case came
on for judgment, when unfortunately the court was found divided, two for the patent and two
against. Another case was tried December 16, 1796, with a special jury, before Lord Chief Justice
Eyre; the verdict was again for the plaintiffs. Proceedings on a writ of error had the effect
of affirming the result by the unanimous opinion of the four judges, before whom it was ably
and fully argued on two occasions.

The testimony of Professor Robison, Watt's intimate friend of youth in Glasgow, was understood
to have been deeply impressive, and to have had a decisive effect upon judges and jury.

All the claims of Watt were thus triumphantly sustained. The decision has always been considered
of commanding importance to the law of patents in Britain, and was of vast consequence to the
firm of Watt and Boulton pecuniarily. Heavy damages and costs were due from the actual defendants,
and the large number of other infringers were also liable for damages. As was to have been
expected, however, the firm remembered that to be merciful in the hour of victory and not to
punish too hard a fallen foe, was a cardinal virtue. The settlements they made were considered
most liberal and satisfactory to all. Watt used frequently long afterward to refer to his specifications
as his old and well-tried friends. So indeed they proved, and many references to their wonderful
efficiency were made.

With the beginning of the new century, 1800, the original partnership of the famous firm of
Boulton and Watt expired, after a term of twenty-five years, as did the patents of 1769 and
1775. The term of partnership had been fixed with reference to the duration of the patents.
Young men in their prime, Watt at forty and Boulton about fifty when they joined hands, after
a quarter-century of unceasing and anxious labor, were disposed to resign the cares and troubles
of business to their sons. The partnership therefore was not renewed by them, but their respective
shares in the firm were agreed upon as the basis of a new partnership between their sons, James
Watt, Jr., Matthew Robinson Boulton and Gregory Watt, all distinguished for abilities of no
mean order, and in a great degree already conversant with the business, which their wise fathers
had seen fit for some years to entrust more and more to them.

In nothing done by either of these two wise fathers is more wisdom shown than in their sagacious,
farseeing policy in regard to their sons. As they themselves had been taught to concentrate
their energies upon useful occupation, for which society would pay as for value received, they
had doubtless often conferred, and concluded that was the happiest and best life for their
sons, instead of allowing them to fritter away the precious years of youth in aimless frivolity,
to be followed in later years by a disappointing and humiliating old age.

So the partnership of Boulton and Watt was renewed in the union of the sons. Gregory Watt's
premature death four years later was such a blow to his father that some think he never was
quite himself again. Gregory had displayed brilliant talents in the higher pursuits of science
and literature, in which he took delight, and great things had been predicted from him. With
the other two sons the business connection continued without change for forty years, until,
when old men, they also retired like their fathers. They proved to be great managers, for notwithstanding
the cessation of the patents which opened engine-building free to all, the business of the
firm increased and became much more profitable than it had ever been before; indeed toward
the close of the original partnership, and upon the triumph gained in the patent suits, the
enterprise became so profitable as fully to satisfy the moderate desire of Watt, and to provide
a sure source of income for his sons. This met all his wishes and removed the fears of becoming
dependent that had so long haunted him.

The continued and increasing success of the Soho works was obviously owing to the new partners.
They had some excellent assistants, but in the foremost place among all of them stands Murdoch,
Watt's able, faithful and esteemed assistant for many years, who, both intellectually and in
manly independence, was considered to exhibit no small resemblance to his revered master and
friend. Never formally a partner in Soho (for he declined partnership as we have seen), he
was placed on the footing of a partner by the sons in 1810, without risk, and received $5,000
per annum. From 1830 he lived in peaceful retirement and passed away in 1839. His remains were
deposited in Handsworth Church near those of his friends and employers, Watt and Boulton (the
one spot on earth he could have most desired). "A bust by Chantrey serves to perpetuate the
remembrance of his manly and intelligent features, and of the mind of which these were a pleasing
index." We may imagine the shades of Watt and Boulton, those friends so appropriately laid
together, greeting their friend and employee: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant!"
If ever there was one, Murdoch was the man, and Captain Jones his fellow.

We have referred to Watt's suggestion of the screw-propeller, and of the sketch of it sent
to Dr. Small, September 30, 1770. The only record of any earlier suggestion of steam is that
of Jonathan Hulls, in 1736, and which he set forth in a pamphlet entitled "A Description and
Draught of a Newly Invented Machine for carrying vessels or ships out of or into any Harbour,
Port or River, against Wind or Tide or in a Calm"; London, 1737. He described a large barge
equipped with a Newcomen engine to be employed as a tug, fitted with fan (or paddle) wheels,
towing a ship of war, but nothing further appears to have been done. Writing on this subject,
Mr. Williamson says:

    During his last visit to Greenock in 1816, Mr. Watt, in company
    with his friend, Mr. Walkinshaw--whom the author some years
    afterward heard relate the circumstance--made a voyage in a
    steamboat as far as Rothsay and back to Greenock--an excursion,
    which, in those days, occupied a greater portion of a whole day.
    Mr. Watt entered into conversation with the engineer of the
    boat, pointing out to him the method of "backing" the engine.
    With a footrule he demonstrated to him what was meant. Not
    succeeding, however, he at last, under the impulse of the ruling
    passion, threw off his overcoat, and, putting his hand to the
    engine himself, showed the practical application of his lecture.
    Previously to this, the "back-stroke" of the steamboat engine
    was either unknown, or not generally known. The practice was to
    stop the engine entirely a considerable time before the vessel
    reached the point of mooring, in order to allow for the gradual
    and natural diminution of her speed.

The naval review at Spithead, upon the close of the Crimean war in 1856, was the greatest up
to that time. Ten vessels out of two hundred and fifty still had not steam power, but almost
all the others were propelled by the screw--the spiral oar of Watt's letter of 1770--a red-letter
day for the inventor.

Watt's early interest in locomotive steam-carriages, dating from Robison's having thrown out
the idea to him, was never lost. On August 12, 1768, Dr. Small writes Watt, referring to the
"peculiar improvements in them" the latter had made previous to that date. Seven months later
he apprises Watt that "a patent for moving wheel-carriages by steam has been taken out by one
Moore," adding "this comes of thy delays; do come to England with all possible speed." Watt
replied "If linen-draper Moore does not use my engine to drive his chaises he can't drive them
by steam." Here Watt hit the nail on the head; as with the steamship, so with the locomotive,
his steam-engine was the indispensable power. In 1786 he states that he has a carriage model
of some size in hand "and am resolved to try if God will work a miracle in favor of these carriages."
Watt's doubt was based on the fact that they would take twenty pounds of coal and two cubic
feet of water per horse-power on the common roads.

Another of Watt's recreations in his days of semi-retirement was the improvement of lamps.
He wrote the famous inventor of the Argand burner fully upon the subject in August, 1787, and
constructed some lamps which proved great successes.

The following year he invented an instrument for determining the specific gravities of liquids,
which was generally adopted.

One of Watt's inventions was a new method of readily measuring distances by telescope, which
he used in making his various surveys for canals. Such instruments are in general use to-day.
Brough's treatise on "Mining" (10th ed., p. 228) gives a very complete account of them, and
states that "the original instrument of this class is that invented by James Watt in 1771."

In his leisure hours, Watt invented an ingenious machine for drawing in perspective, using
the double parallel ruler, then very little known and not at all used as far as Watt knew.
Watt reports having made from fifty to eighty of these machines, which went to various parts
of the world.

In 1810 Watt informs Berthollet that for several years he had felt unable, owing to the state
of his health, to make chemical experiments. But idle he could not be; he must be at work upon
something. As he often said, "without a hobby-horse, what is life?" So the saying is reported,
but we may conclude that the "horse" is here an interpolation, for the difference between "a
horse" and "a hobby" is radical--a man can get off a horse.

Watt's next "hobby" fortunately became an engrossing occupation and kept him alert. This was
a machine for copying sculpture. A machine he had seen in Paris for tracing and multiplying
the dies of medals, suggested the other. After much labor and many experiments he did get some
measure of success, and made a large head of Locke in yellow wood, and a small head of his
friend Adam Smith.

Long did Watt toil at the new hobby in the garret where it had been created, but the garret
proved too hot in summer and too cold in winter. March 14, 1810, he writes Berthollet and Levèque:

    I still do a little in mechanics: a part of which, if I live to
    complete it, I shall have the honor of communicating to my
    friends in France.

He went steadily forward and succeeded in making some fine copies in 1814. For one of Sappho
he gives dates and the hours required for various parts, making a total of thirty-nine. Some
censorious Sabbatarians discovered that the day he was employed one hour "doing her breast
with 1/8th drill" was Sabbath, which in one who belonged to a strict Scottish Covenanter family,
betokened a sad fall from grace. When we consider that his health was then precarious, that
he was debarred from chemical experiments, and depended solely upon mechanical subjects; that
in all probability it was a stormy day (Sunday, February 3, 1811), knowing also that "Satan
finds mischief still for idle hands to do," we hope our readers will pardon him for yielding
to the irresistible temptation, even if on the holy Sabbath day for once he could not "get
off" his captivating hobby.

The historical last workshop of the great worker with all its contents remains open to the
public to-day just as it was when he passed away. Pilgrims from many lands visit it, as Shakespeare's
birthplace, Burns' cottage, and Scott's Abbottsford attract their many thousands yearly. We
recommend our readers to add to these this garret of Watt in their pilgrimages.

[1] Sinclair's "Development of the Locomotive" tends to deprive Stephenson of some part of
his fame as inventor. Much importance is attached to Hedley's "Puffing Billy," 1813, which
is pronounced to have been a commercial success. Sinclair, however, credits Stephenson with
doing most of all men to introduce the Locomotive. As the final verdict may admit Hedley and
cannot expel Stephenson from the temple of fame, we pass the sentence as written, leaving to
future disputants to adjust rival claims.

CHAPTER VIII

THE RECORD OF THE STEAM ENGINE

The Soho works, up to January, 1824, had completed 1164 steam engines, of a nominal horse-power
of 25,945; from January, 1824, to 1854, 441 engines, nominal horse-power, 25,278, making the
total number 1605, of nominal horse-power, 51,223, and real horse-power, 167,319. Mulhall gives
the total steam-power of the world as 50,150,000 horse-power in 1888. In 1880 it was only 34,150,000.
Thus in eight years it increased, say, fifty per cent. Assuming the same rate of increase from
1888 to 1905, a similar period, it is to-day 75,000,000 nominal, which Engel says may be taken
as one-half the effective power (vide Mulhall, "Steam," p. 546), the real horse-power in 1905
being 150,000,000. One horse-power raises ten tons a height of twelve inches per minute. Working
eight hours, this is about 5,000 tons daily, or twelve times a man's work, and as the engine
never tires, and can be run constantly, it follows that each horse-power it can exert equals
thirty-six men's work; but, allowing for stoppages, let us say thirty men. The engines of a
large ocean greyhound of 35,000 horse-power, running constantly from port to port, equal to
three relays of twelve men per horse-power, is daily exerting the power of 1,260,000 men, or
105,000 horses. Assuming that all the steam engines in the world upon the average work double
the hours of men, then the 150,000,000 horse-power in the world, each equal to two relays of
twelve men per horse-power, exerts the power of 3,600,000,000 of men. There are only one-tenth
as many male adults in the world, estimating one in five of the population.

If we assume that all steam engines work an average of only eight hours in the twenty-four,
as men and horses do (those on duty longer hours are not under continuous exertion), it still
follows that the 150,000,000 of effective steam-power, each doing the work of twelve men, equals
the work of 1,800,000,000 of men, or of 150,000,000 of horses.

Engel estimated that in 1880 the value of world industries dependent upon steam was thirty-two
thousand millions of dollars, and that in 1888 it had reached forty-three thousand millions
of dollars. It is to-day doubtless more than sixty thousand millions of dollars, a great increase
no doubt over 1880, but the one figure is as astounding as the other, for both mean nothing
that can be grasped.

The chief steam-using countries are America, 14,400,000 horse-power in 1888; Britain, 9,200,000
horse-power nominal. If we add the British colonies and dependencies, 7,120,000 horse-power,
the English-speaking race had three-fifths of all the steam-power of the world.

In 1840 Britain had only 620,000 horse-power nominal; the United States 760,000; the whole
world had only 1,650,000 horse-power. To-day it has 75,000,000 nominal. So rapidly has steam
extended its sway over most of the earth in less than the span of a man's life. There has never
been any development in the world's history comparable to this, nor can we imagine that such
a rapid transformation can ever come in the future. What the future is finally to bring forth
even imagination is unable to conceive. No bounds can be set to its forthcoming possible, even
probable, wonders, but as such a revolution as steam has brought must come from a superior
force capable of displacing steam, this would necessarily be a much longer task than steam
had in occupying an entirely new field without a rival.

The contrast between Newcomen and Watt is interesting. The Newcomen engine consumed twenty-eight
pounds of coal per horse-power and made not exceeding three to four strokes per minute, the
piston moving about fifty feet per minute. To-day, steam marine engines on one and one-third
pounds of coal per horse-power--the monster ships using less--make from seventy to ninety revolutions
per minute. "Destroyers" reach 400 per minute. Small steam engines, it is stated, have attained
600 revolutions per minute. The piston to-day is supposed to travel moderately when at 1,000
feet per minute, in a cylinder three feet long. This gives 166 revolutions per minute. With
coal under the boilers costing one dollar per net ton, from say five pounds of coal for one
cent there is one horse-power for three hours, or a day and a night of continuous running for
eight cents.

Countless millions of men and of horses would be useless for the work of the steam-engine,
for the seemingly miraculous quality steam possesses, that permits concentration, is as requisite
as its expansive powers. One hundred thousand horse-power, or several hundred thousand horse-power,
is placed under one roof and directed to the task required. Sixty-four thousand horse-power
is concentrated in the hold of the great steamships now building. All this stupendous force
is evolved, concentrated and regulated by science from the most unpromising of substances,
cold water. Nothing man has discovered or imagined is to be named with the steam engine. It
has no fellow. Franklin capturing the lightning, Morse annihilating space with the telegraph,
Bell transmitting speech through the air by the telephone, are not less mysterious--being more
ethereal, perhaps in one sense they are even more so--still, the labor of the world performed
by heating cold water places Watt and his steam engine in a class apart by itself. Many are
the inventions for applying power; his creates the power it applies.

Whether the steam engine has reached its climax, and gas, oil, or other agents are to be used
extensively for power, in the near future, is a question now debated in scientific circles.
Much progress has been made in using these substitutes, and more is probable, as one obstacle
after another is overcome. Gas especially is coming forward, and oil is freely used. For reasons
before stated, it seems to the writer that, where coal is plentiful, the day is distant when
steam will not continue to be the principal source of power. It will be a world surpriser that
beats one horse-power developed by one pound of coal. The power to do much more than this,
however, lies theoretically in gas, but there come these wise words of Arago to mind: "Persons
whose whole lives have been devoted to speculative labours are not aware how great the distance
is between a scheme, apparently the best concerted, and its realisation." So true! Watt's ideas
in the brain, and the steam engine that he had to evolve during nine long years, are somewhat
akin to the great gulf between resolve and performance, the "good resolution" that soothes
and the "act" that exalts.

The steam engine is Scotland's chief, tho not her only contribution to the material progress
of the world. Watt was its inventor, we might almost write Creator, so multiform were the successive
steps. Symington by the steamship stretched one arm of it over the water; Stephenson by the
locomotive stretched the other over the land. Thus was the world brought under its sway and
conditions of human life transformed. Watt and Symington were born in Scotland within a few
miles of each other. Stephenson's forbears moved from Scotland south of the line previous to
his birth, as Fulton's parents removed from Scotland to America, so that both Stephenson and
Fulton could boast with Gladstone that the blood in their veins was Scotch.

The history of the world has no parallel to the change effected by the inventions of these
three men. Strange that little Scotland, with only 1,500,000 people, in 1791, about one-half
the population of New York City, should have been the mother of such a triad, and that her
second "mighty three" (Wallace, Bruce and Burns always first), should have been of the same
generation, working upon the earth near each other at the same time. The Watt engine appeared
in 1782; the steamship in 1801; the locomotive thirteen years later, in 1814. Thus thirty-two
years after its appearance Watt's steam-engine had conquered both sea and land.

The sociologist may theorise, but plain people will remember that men do not gather grapes
from thorns, nor figs from thistles. There must be something in the soil which produces such
men; something in the poverty that compels exertion; something in the "land of the mountain
and the flood" that stirs the imagination; something in the history of centuries of struggle
for national and spiritual independence; much in the system of compulsory and universal free
education; something of all these elements mingling in the blood that tells, and enables Scotland
to contribute so largely to the progress of the world.

Strange reticence is shown by all Watt's historians regarding his religious and political views.
Williamson, the earliest author of his memoirs, is full of interesting facts obtained from
people in Greenock who had known Watt well. The hesitation shown by him as to Watt's orthodoxy
in his otherwise highly eulogistic tribute, attracts attention. He says:

    We could desire to know more of the state of those affections
    which are more purely spiritual by their nature and origin--his
    disposition to those supreme truths of Revelation, which alone
    really elevate and purify the soul. In the absence of much
    information of a very positive kind in regard to such points of
    character and life, we instinctively revert in a case like this
    to the principles and maxims of an infantile and early training.
    Remembering the piety portrayed in the ancestors of this great
    man, one cannot but cling to the hope that his many virtues
    reposed on a substratum of more than merely moral excellence.
    Let us cherish the hope that the calm which rested on the spirit
    of the pilgrim ... was one that caught its radiance from a far
    higher sphere than that of the purest human philosophy.

Watt's breaking of the Sabbath before recorded must have seemed to that stern Calvinist a heinous
sin, justifying grave doubts of Watt's spiritual condition, his "moral excellence" to the contrary
notwithstanding. Williamson's estimate of moral excellence had recently been described by Burns:

    But then, nae thanks to him for a' that,
    Nae godly symptom ye can ca' that,
    It's naething but a milder feature
    Of our poor sinfu' corrupt nature.
    Ye'll get the best o' moral works,
    Many black gentoos and pagan works,
    Or hunters wild on Ponotaxi
    Wha never heard of orthodoxy.

Williamson's doubts had much stronger foundation in Watt's non-attendance at church, for, as
we shall see from his letter to DeLuc, July, 1788, he had never attended the "meeting-house"
(dissenting church) in Birmingham altho he claimed to be still a member of the Presbyterian
body in declining the sheriffalty.

It seems probable that Watt, in his theological views, like Priestley and others of the Lunar
Society, was in advance of his age, and more or less in accord with Burns, who was then astonishing
his countrymen. Perhaps he had forstalled Dean Stanley's advice in his rectorial address to
the students of St. Andrew's University: "go to Burns for your theology," yet he remained a
deeply religious man to the end, as we see from his letter (page 216), at the age of seventy-six.

We know that politically Watt was in advance of his times for the prime minister pronounced
him "a sad radical." He was with Burns politically at all events. Watt's eldest son, then in
Paris, was carried away by the French Revolution, and Muirhead suggests that the prime minister
must have confounded father and son, but it seems unreasonable to suppose that he could have
been so misled as to mistake the doings of the famous Watt in Birmingham for those of his impulsive
son in France.

The French Revolution exerted a powerful influence in Britain, especially in the north of England
and south of Scotland, which have much in common. The Lunar Society of Birmingham was intensely
interested. At one of the meetings in the summer of 1788, held at her father's house, Mrs.
Schimmelpenniack records that Mr. Boulton presented to the company his son, just returned from
a long sojourn in Paris, who gave a vivid account of proceedings there, Watt and Dr. Priestly
being present. A few months later the revolution broke out. Young Harry Priestley, a son of
the Doctor's, one evening burst into the drawing-room, waving his hat and crying, "Hurrah!
Liberty, Reason, Brotherly Love forever! Down with kingcraft and priestcraft! The majesty of
the people forever! France is free!" Dr. Priestley was deeply stirred and became the most prominent
of all in the cause of the rights of man. He hailed the acts of the National Assembly abolishing
monarchy, nobility and church. He was often engaged in discussions with the local clergy on
theological dogmas. He wrote a pamphlet upon the French Revolution, and Burke attacked him
in the House of Commons. All this naturally concentrated local opposition upon him as leader.
The enthusiasts mistakenly determined to have a public dinner to celebrate the anniversary
of the Revolution, and no less than eighty gentlemen attended, altho many advised against it.
Priestley himself was not present. A mob collected outside and demolished the windows. The
cry was raised, "To the new meeting-house!" the chapel in which Priestley ministered. The chapel
was set on fire. Thence the riot proceeded to Priestley's house. The doctor and his family,
being warned, had left shortly before. The house was at the mercy of the mob, which broke in,
destroyed furniture, chemical laboratory and library, and finally set fire to the house. Some
of the very best citizens suffered in like manner. Mr. Ryland, one of the most munificent benefactors
of the town, Mr. Taylor, the banker, and Hutton, the estimable book-seller, were among the
number. The home of Dr. Withering, member of the Lunar Society, was entered, but the timely
arrival of troops saved it from destruction. The members of the Lunar Society, or the "lunatics,"
as they were popularly called, were especially marked for attack. The mob cried, "No philosophers!"
"Church and King forever!" All this put Boulton and Watt upon their guard, for they were prominent
members of the society. They called their workmen together, explained the criminally of the
rioters, and placed arms in their hands on their promise to defend them if attacked. Meanwhile
everything portable was packed up ready to be removed.

Watt wrote to Mr. DeLuc, July 19, 1791:

    Though our principles, which are well known, as friends to the
    established government and enemies of republican principles,
    should have been our protection from a mob whose watchword was
    Church and King, yet our safety was principally owing to most of
    the Dissenters living south of the town; for after the first
    moment they did not seem over-nice in their discrimination of
    religion and principles. I, among others, was pointed out as a
    Presbyterian, though I never was in a meeting-house (Dissenting
    Church) in Birmingham, and Mr. Boulton is well-known as a
    Churchman. We had everything most portable packed up, fearing
    the worst. However, all is well with us.

From all this we gather the impression that Radical principles had permeated the leading minds
of Birmingham to a considerable extent, probably around the Lunar Society district in greater
measure than in other quarters, altho clubs of ardent supporters were formed in London and
the principal provincial cities.

In the political field, we have only one appearance of Watt reported. Early in 1784, we find
him taking the lead in getting up a loyal address to the king on the appointment as prime minister
of Pitt, who proposed to tax coal, iron, copper and other raw materials of manufacture to the
amount of $5,000,000 per year, a considerable sum in those days when manufacturing was in its
infancy. Boulton also joined in opposition. They wisely held that for a manufacturing nation
"to tax raw materials was suicidal: let taxes be laid upon luxuries, upon vices, and, if you
like, upon property; tax riches when got, but not the means of getting them. Of all things
don't cut open the hen that lays the golden eggs."

Watt's services were enlisted and he drew up a paper for circulation upon the subject. The
policy failed, and soon after Pitt was converted to sounder doctrines by Adam Smith's "Wealth
of Nations." Free trade has ruled Britain ever since, and, being the country that could manufacture
cheapest, and indeed, the only manufacturing country for many years, this policy has made her
the richest, per capita, of all nations. The day may be not far distant when America, soon
to be the cheapest manufacturing country for many, as it already is for a few, staple articles,
will be crying for free trade, and urging free entrance to the markets of the world. To tax
the luxuries and vices, to tax wealth got and not in the making, as proposed by Watt and Boulton,
is the policy to follow. Watt shows himself to have been a profound economist.

Watt had cause for deep anxiety for his eldest son, James, who had taken an active part in
the agitation. He and his friend, Mr. Cooper of Manchester, were appointed deputies by the
"Constitutional Society," to proceed to Paris and present an address of congratulation to the
Jacobin Club. Young Watt was carried away, and became intimate with the leaders. Southey says
he actually prevented a duel between Danton and Robespierre by appearing on the ground and
remonstrating with them, pointing out that if either fell the cause must suffer.

Upon young Watt's return, king's messengers arrived in Birmingham and seized persons concerned
in seditious correspondence. Watt suggests that Boulton should see his son and arrange for
his leaving for America, or some foreign land, for a time. This proved to be unnecessary; his
son was not arrested, and in a short time all was forgotten. He entered the works with Boulton's
son as partner, and became an admirable manager. To-day we regard his mild republicanism, his
alliance with Jacobin leaders, and especially his bold intervention in the quarrel between
two of the principal actors in the tragedy of the French Revolution, as "a ribbon in the cap
of youth." That his douce father did the same and was proud of his eldest born seems probable.
Our readers will also judge for themselves whether the proud father had not himself a strong
liking for democratic principles, "the rights of the people," "the royalty of man," which Burns
was then blazing forth, and held such sentiments as quite justified the prime minister's accusation
that he was "a sad radical."

In Britain, since Watt's day, all traces of opposition to monarchy aroused by the French Revolution
have disappeared, as completely as the monarchy of King George. The "limited monarchy" of to-day,
developed during the admirable reign of Queen Victoria, has taken its place. The French abolished
monarchy by a frontal attack upon the citadel, involving serious loss. Not such the policy
of the colder Briton. He won his great victory, losing nothing, by flanking the position. That
the king "could do no wrong," is a doctrine almost coeval with modern history, flowing from
the "divine right" of kings, and, as such, was quietly accepted. It needed only to be properly
harnessed to become a very serviceable agent for registering the people's will.

It was obvious that the acceptance of the doctrine that the king could do no wrong involved
the duty of proving the truth of the axiom, and it was equally obvious that the only possible
way of doing this was that the king should not be allowed to do anything. Hence he was made
the mouthpiece of his ministers, and it is not the king, but they, who, being fallible men,
may occasionally err. The monarch, in losing power to do anything has gained power to influence
everything. The ministers hold office through the approval of the House of Commons. Members
of that house are elected by the people. Thus stands government in Britain "broad-based upon
the people's will."

All that the revolutionists of Watt's day desired has, in substance, been obtained, and Britain
has become in truth a "crowned republic," with "government of the people, for the people, and
by the people." This steady and beneficent development was peaceably attained. The difference
between the French and British methods is that between revolution and evolution.

In America's political domain, a similar evolution has been even more silently at work than
in Britain during the past century, and is not yet exhausted--the transformation of a loose
confederacy of sovereign states, with different laws, into one solid government, which assumes
control and insures uniformity over one department after another. The centripetal forces grow
stronger with the years; power leaves the individual states and drifts to Washington, as the
necessity for each successive change becomes apparent. In the regulation of interstate commerce,
of trusts, and in other fields, final authority over the whole land gravitates more and more
to Washington. It is a beneficent movement, likely to result in uniform national laws upon
many subjects in which present diversity creates confusion. Marriage and divorce laws, bankruptcy
laws, corporation charter privileges, and many other important questions may be expected to
become uniform under this evolutionary process. The Supreme Court decision that the Union was
an indissoluble union of indissoluble states, carries with it finally uniform regulation of
many interstate problems, in every respect salutary, and indispensable for the perfect union
of the American people.

CHAPTER IX

WATT IN OLD AGE

Watt gracefully glided into old age. This is the great test of success in life. To every stage
a laurel, but to happy old age the crown. It was different with his friend Boulton, who continued
to frequent the works and busy himself in affairs much as before, altho approaching his eightieth
year. Watt could still occupy himself in his garret, where his "mind to him a Kingdom was,"
upon the scientific pursuits which charmed him. He revisited Paris in 1802 and renewed acquaintances
with his old friends, with whom he spent five weeks. He frequently treated himself to tours
throughout England, Scotland and Wales. In the latter country, he purchased a property which
attracted him by its beauties, and which he greatly improved. It became at a later date, under
his son, quite an extensive estate, much diversified, and not lacking altogether the stern
grandeur of his native Scotland. He planted trees and took intense delight in his garden, being
very fond of flowers. The farmhouse gave him a comfortable home upon his visits. The fine woods
which now richly clothe the valley and agreeably diversify the river and mountain scenery were
chiefly planted under his superintendence, many by his own hand. In short, the blood in his
veins, the lessons of his childhood that made him a "child of the mist," happy in roaming among
the hills, reasserted their power in old age as the Celtic element powerfully does. He turned
more and more to nature.

    "That never yet betrayed the heart that loved her--"

Twice Watt was requested to undertake the honor of the shrievalty; in 1803 that of Staffordshire,
and in 1816 that of Radnorshire, both of which were positively declined.

He finally found it necessary to declare that he was not a member of the Church of England,
but of the Presbyterian church of Scotland, a reason which in that day was conclusive.

In 1816, he was in his eighty-first year, and no difficulty seems then to have been found for
excusing him, for it seems the assumption of the duties was compulsory. It was "the voice of
age resistless in its feebleness."

The day had come when Watt awakened to one of the saddest of all truths, that his friends were
one by one rapidly passing away, the circle ever narrowing, the few whose places never could
be filled becoming fewer, he in the centre left more and more alone. Nothing grieved Watt so
much as this. In 1794 his partner, Roebuck, fell; in 1799, his inseparable friend, and supporter
in his hour of need, Dr. Black, and also Withering of the Lunar Society; and in 1802 Darwin
"of the silver song," one of his earliest English friends. In 1804, his brilliant son Gregory
died, a terrible shock. In 1805, his first Glasgow College intimate, Robison; Dr. Beddoes in
1808; Boulton, his partner, in 1809; Dr. Wilson in 1811; DeLuc in 1817. Many other friends
of less distinction fell in these years who were not less dear to him. He says, "by one friend's
withdrawing after another," he felt himself "in danger of standing alone among strangers, the
son of later times."

He writes to Boulton on November 23, 1802:

    We cannot help feeling, with deep regret, the circle of our old
    friends gradually diminishing, while our ability to increase it
    by new ones is equally diminished; but perhaps it is a wise
    dispensation of Providence so to diminish our enjoyments in this
    world, that when our turn comes we may leave it without regret.

He writes to another correspondent, July 12, 1810:

    I, in particular, have reason to thank God that he has preserved
    me so well as I am, to so late a period, while the greater part
    of my contemporaries, healthier and younger men, have passed
    "the bourne from which no traveller returns." It is, however, a
    painful contemplation to see so many who were dear to us pass
    away before us; and our consolation should be, that as
    Providence has been pleased to prolong our life, we should
    render ourselves as useful to society as we can while we live.

And again, when seventy-six years of age, January, 1812, he writes:

    On these subjects I can offer no other consolations than what
    are derived from religion: they have only gone before us a
    little while, in that path we all must tread, and we should be
    thankful they were spared so long to their friends and the
    world.

Sir Walter Scott declares:

    That is the worst part of life when its earlier path is trod. If
    my limbs get stiff, my walks are made shorter, and my rides
    slower; if my eyes fail me, I can use glasses and a large print:
    if I get a little deaf, I comfort myself that except in a few
    instances I shall be no great loser by missing one full half of
    what is spoken: but I feel the loneliness of age when my
    companions and friends are taken from me.

All his life until retiring from business, Watt's care was to obtain sufficient for the support
of himself and family upon the most modest scale. He had no surplus to devote to ends beyond
self, but as soon as he retired with a small competence it was different, and we accordingly
find him promptly beginning to apply some portion of his still small revenue to philanthropical
ends. Naturally, his thoughts reverted first to his native town and the university to which
he owed so much.

In 1808 he founded the Watt Prize in Glasgow University, saying:

    Entertaining a due sense of the many favours conferred upon me
    by the University of Glasgow, I wish to leave them some memorial
    of my gratitude, and, at the same time, to excite a spirit of
    inquiry and exertion among the students of Natural Philosophy
    and Chemistry attending the College; which appears to me the
    more useful, as the very existence of Britain, as a nation,
    seems to me, in great measure, to depend upon her exertions in
    science and in the arts.

The University conferred the degree of LL.D. upon him in 1774, and its great engineering laboratory
bears his name.

In 1816, he made a donation to the town of Greenock for scientific books, stating it to be
his intention

    to form the beginning of a scientific library for the
    instruction of the youth of Greenock, in the hope of prompting
    others to add to it, and of rendering his townsmen as eminent
    for their knowledge as they are for the spirit of enterprise.

This has grown to be a library containing 15,000 volumes, and is a valuable adjunct of the
Watt Institution, founded by his son in memory of his father, which is to-day the educational
centre of Greenock. Its entrance is adorned by a remarkably fine statue of Watt, funds for
which were raised by public subscription.

Many societies honored the great inventor. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
the Royal Society of London, Member of the Batavian Society, correspondent of the French Academy
of Sciences, and was one of the eight Foreign Associates of the French Academy of Sciences.

Watt's almost morbid dislike for publicity leaves many well-known acts of kindness and charity
hidden from all save the recipients. Muirhead assures us that such gifts as we can well believe
were not wanting. Watt's character as a kindly neighbor always stood high.

In the autumn of 1819 an illness of no great apparent severity caused some little anxiety to
Watt's family, and was soon recognised by himself as the messenger sent to apprise him of his
end. This summons he met with the calm and tranquil mind, that, looking backward, could have
found little of serious nature to repent, and looking forward, found nothing to fear. "He often
expressed his gratitude to the Giver of All Good who had so signally prospered the work of
his hands and blessed him with length of days and riches and honour." On August 19, 1819, aged
83, in his own home at Heathfield, he tranquilly breathed his last, deeply mourned by all who
were privileged to know him. In the parish churchyard, alongside of Boulton, he was most appropriately
laid to rest. Thus the two strong men, lifelong friends and partners, who had never had a serious
difference, "lovely and pleasant in their lives, in their death were not divided."

It may be doubted whether there be on record so charming a business connection as that of Boulton
and Watt; in their own increasingly close union for twenty-five years, and, at its expiration,
in the renewal of that union in their sons under the same title; in their sons' close union
as friends without friction as in the first generation; in the wonderful progress of the world
resulting from their works; in their lying down side by side in death upon the bosom of Mother
Earth in the quiet churchyard, as they had stood side by side in the battle of life; and in
the faithful servant Murdoch joining them at the last, as he had joined them in his prime.
In the sweet and precious influences which emanate from all this, may we not gratefully make
acknowledgment that in contemplation thereof we are lifted into a higher atmosphere, refreshed,
encouraged, and bettered by the true story of men like ourselves, whom if we can never hope
to equal, we may at least try in part to imitate.

A meeting was called in London to take steps for a monument to Watt to be placed in Westminster
Abbey. The prime minister presided and announced a subscription of five hundred pounds sterling
from His Majesty. It may truly be said that

    A meeting more distinguished by rank, station and talent, was
    never before assembled to do honour to genius, and to modest and
    retiring worth; and a more spontaneous, noble, and
    discriminating testimony was never borne to the virtues,
    talents, and public services of any individual, in any age or
    country.

The result was the colossal statue by Chantrey which bears the following inscription, pronounced
to be beyond comparison "the finest lapidary inscription in the English language." Lord Brougham
has this to say of Watt:

    One of the most astonishing circumstances in this truly great
    man was the versatility of his talents. His accomplishments were
    so various, the powers of his mind were so vast, and yet of such
    universal application, that it was hard to say whether we should
    most admire the extraordinary grasp of his understanding, or the
    accuracy of nice research with which he could bring it to bear
    upon the most minute objects of investigation. I forget of whom
    it was said, that his mind resembled the trunk of an elephant,
    which can pick up straws and tear up trees by the roots. Mr.
    Watt in some sort resembled the greatest and most celebrated of
    his own inventions; of which we are at a loss whether most to
    wonder at the power of grappling with the mightiest objects, or
    of handling the most minute; so that while nothing seems too
    large for its grasp, nothing seems too small for the delicacy of
    its touch; which can cleave rocks and pour forth rivers from the
    bowels of the earth, and with perfect exactness, though not with
    greater ease, fashion the head of a pin, or strike the impress
    of some curious die. Now those who knew Mr. Watt, had to
    contemplate a man whose genius could create such an engine, and
    indulge in the most abstruse speculations of philosophy, and
    could at once pass from the most sublime researches of geology
    and physical astronomy, the formation of our globe, and the
    structure of the universe, to the manufacture of a needle or a
    nail; who could discuss in the same conversation, and with equal
    accuracy, if not with the same consummate skill, the most
    forbidding details of art, and the elegances of classical
    literature; the most abstruse branches of science, and the
    niceties of verbal criticism.

    There was one quality in Mr. Watt which most honorably
    distinguished him from too many inventors, and was worthy of all
    imitation; he was not only entirely free from jealousy, but he
    exercised a careful and scrupulous self-denial, and was anxious
    not to appear, even by accident, as appropriating to himself
    that which he thought belonged in part to others. I have heard
    him refuse the honor universally ascribed to him, of being
    inventor of the steam-engine, and call himself simply its
    improver; though, in my mind, to doubt his right to that honor
    would be as inaccurate as to question Sir Isaac Newton's claim
    to his greatest discoveries, because Descartes in mathematics,
    and Galileo in astronomy and mechanics, had preceded him; or to
    deny the merits of his illustrious successor, because galvanism
    was not his discovery, though before his time it had remained as
    useless to science as the instrument called a steam-engine was
    to the arts before Mr. Watt. The only jealousy I have known him
    betray was with respect to others, in the nice adjustment he was
    fond of giving to the claims of inventors. Justly prizing
    scientific discovery above all other possessions, he deemed the
    title to it so sacred, that you might hear him arguing by the
    hour to settle disputed rights; and if you ever perceived his
    temper ruffled, it was when one man's invention was claimed by,
    or given to, another; or when a clumsy adulation pressed upon
    himself that which he knew to be not his own.

Sir Humphrey Davy says:

    I consider it as a duty incumbent on me to endeavor to set forth
    his peculiar and exalted merits, which live in the recollection
    of his contemporaries and will transmit his name with immortal
    glory to posterity. Those who consider James Watt only as a
    great practical mechanic form a very erroneous idea of his
    character; he was equally distinguished as a natural philosopher
    and a chemist, and his inventions demonstrate his profound
    knowledge of those sciences, and that peculiar characteristic of
    genius, the union of them for practical application. The steam
    engine before his time was a rude machine, the result of simple
    experiments on the compression of the atmosphere, and the
    condensation of steam. Mr. Watt's improvements were not produced
    by accidental circumstances or by a single ingenious thought;
    they were founded on delicate and refined experiments, connected
    with the discoveries of Dr. Black. He had to investigate the
    cause of the cold produced by evaporation, of the heat
    occasioned by the condensation of steam--to determine the source
    of the air appearing when water was acted upon by an exhausting
    power; the ratio of the volume of steam to its generating water,
    and the law by which the elasticity of steam increased with the
    temperature; labor, time, numerous and difficult experiments,
    were required for the ultimate result; and when his principle
    was obtained, the application of it to produce the movement of
    machinery demanded a new species of intellectual and
    experimental labor.

    The Archimedes of the ancient world by his mechanical inventions
    arrested the course of the Romans, and stayed for a time the
    downfall of his country. How much more has our modern Archimedes
    done? He has permanently elevated the strength and wealth of his
    great empire: and, during the last long war, his inventions; and
    their application were amongst the great means which enabled
    Britain to display power and resources so infinitely above what
    might have been expected from the numerical strength of her
    population. Archimedes valued principally abstract science;
    James Watt, on the contrary, brought every principle to some
    practical use; and, as it were, made science descend from heaven
    to earth. The great inventions of the Syracusan died with
    him--those of our philosopher live, and their utility and
    importance are daily more felt; they are among the grand results
    which place civilised above savage man--which secure the triumph
    of intellect, and exalt genius and moral force over mere brutal
    strength, courage and numbers.

Sir James Mackintosh says:

    It may be presumptuous in me to add anything in my own words to
    such just and exalted praise. Let me rather borrow the language
    in which the great father of modern philosophy, Lord Bacon
    himself, has spoken of inventors in the arts of life. In a
    beautiful, though not very generally read fragment of his,
    called the New Atlantis, a voyage to an imaginary island, he has
    imagined a university, or rather royal society, under the name
    of Solomon's House, or the College of the Six Days' Works; and
    among the various buildings appropriated to this institution, he
    describes a gallery destined to contain the statues of
    inventors. He does not disdain to place in it not only the
    inventor of one of the greatest instruments of science, but the
    discoverer of the use of the silkworm, and of other still more
    humble contrivances for the comfort of man. What place would
    Lord Bacon have assigned in such a gallery to the statue of Mr.
    Watt? Is it too much to say, that, considering the magnitude of
    the discoveries, the genius and science necessary to make them,
    and the benefits arising from them to the world, that statue
    must have been placed at the head of those of all inventors in
    all ages and nations. In another part of his writings the same
    great man illustrates the dignity of useful inventions by one of
    those happy allusions to the beautiful mythology of the
    ancients, which he often employs to illuminate as well as to
    decorate reason. "The dignity," says he, "of this end of
    endowment of man's life with new commodity appeareth, by the
    estimation that antiquity made of such as guided thereunto; for
    whereas founders of states, lawgivers, extirpators of tyrants,
    fathers of the people, were honored but with the titles of
    demigods, inventors were ever consecrated amongst the gods
    themselves."

The Earl of Aberdeen says:

    It would ill become me to attempt to add to the eulogy which you
    have already heard on the distinguished individual whose genius
    and talents we have met this day to acknowledge. That eulogy has
    been pronounced by those whose praises are well calculated to
    confer honor, even upon him whose name does honor to his
    country. I feel in common with them, although I can but ill
    express that intense admiration which the bare recollection of
    those discoveries must excite, which have rendered us familiar
    with a power before nearly unknown, and which have taught us to
    wield, almost at will, perhaps the mightiest instrument ever
    intrusted to the hands of man. I feel, too, that in erecting a
    monument to his memory, placed, as it may be, among the
    memorials of kings, and heroes, and statesmen, and philosophers,
    that it will be then in its proper place; and most in its proper
    place, if in the midst of those who have been most distinguished
    by their usefulness to mankind, and by the spotless integrity of
    their lives.

Lord Jeffrey says:

    This name fortunately needs no commemoration of ours; for he
    that bore it survived to see it crowned with undisputed and
    unenvied honors; and many generations will probably pass away,
    before it shall have gathered "all its fame." We have said that
    Mr. Watt was the great improver of the steam engine; but, in
    truth, as to all that is admirable in its structure, or vast in
    its utility, he should rather be described as its inventor. It
    was by his inventions that its action was so regulated, as to
    make it capable of being applied to the finest and most delicate
    manufactures, and its power so increased, as to set weight and
    solidity at defiance. By his admirable contrivance, it has
    become a thing stupendous alike for its force and its
    flexibility, for the prodigious power which it can exert, and
    the ease, and precision, and ductility, with which it can be
    varied, distributed, and applied. The trunk of an elephant, that
    can pick up a pin or rend an oak, is as nothing to it. It can
    engrave a seal, and crush masses of obdurate metal before it;
    draw out, without breaking, a thread as fine as gossamer, and
    lift a ship of war like a bauble in the air. It can embroider
    muslin and forge anchors, cut steel into ribbons, and impel
    loaded vessels against the fury of the winds and waves.

    It would be difficult to estimate the value of the benefits
    which these inventions have conferred upon this country. There
    is no branch of industry that has not been indebted to them;
    and, in all the most material, they have not only widened most
    magnificently the field of its exertions, but multiplied a
    thousandfold the amount of its productions. It is our improved
    steam engine that has fought the battles of Europe, and exalted
    and sustained, through the late tremendous contest, the
    political greatness of our land. It is the same great power
    which now enables us to pay the interest of our debt, and to
    maintain the arduous struggle in which we are still engaged
    (1819), with the skill and capital of countries less oppressed
    with taxation. But these are poor and narrow views of its
    importance. It has increased indefinitely the mass of human
    comforts and enjoyments, and rendered cheap and accessible, all
    over the world, the materials of wealth and prosperity. It has
    armed the feeble hand of man, in short, with a power to which no
    limits can be assigned; completed the dominion of mind over the
    most refractory qualities of matter; and laid a sure foundation
    for all those future miracles of mechanical power which are to
    aid and reward the labors of after generations. It is to the
    genius of one man, too, that all this is mainly owing; and
    certainly no man ever bestowed such a gift on his kind. The
    blessing is not only universal, but unbounded; and the fabled
    inventors of the plough and the loom, who were deified by the
    erring gratitude of their rude contemporaries, conferred less
    important benefits on mankind than the inventor of our present
    steam engine.

    This will be the fame of Watt with future generations; and it is
    sufficient for his race and his country. But to those to whom he
    more immediately belonged, who lived in his society and enjoyed
    his conversation, it is not, perhaps, the character in which he
    will be most frequently recalled--most deeply lamented--or even
    most highly admired.

We shall end by quoting the greatest living authority, Lord Kelvin, now Lord Chancellor of
Glasgow University, which Watt and he have done so much to render famous:

    Precisely that single-acting, high-pressure, syringe-engine,
    made and experimented on by James Watt one hundred and forty
    years ago in his Glasgow College workshop, now in 1901, with the
    addition of a surface-condenser cooled by air to receive the
    waste steam, and a pump to return the water thence to the
    boiler, constitutes the common-road motor, which, in the opinion
    of many good judges, is the most successful of all the different
    motors which have been made and tried within the last few years.
    Without a condenser, Watt's high-pressure, single-acting engine
    of 1761, only needs the cylinder-cover with piston-rod passing
    steam-tight through it (as introduced by Watt himself in
    subsequent developments), and the valves proper for admitting
    steam on both sides of the piston and for working expansively,
    to make it the very engine, which, during the whole of the past
    century, has done practically all the steam work of the world,
    and is doing it still, except on the sea or lakes or rivers,
    where there is plenty of condensing water. Even the double and
    triple and quadruple expansion engines, by which the highest
    modern economy for power and steam engines has been obtained,
    are splendid mechanical developments of the principle of
    expansion, discovered and published by Watt, and used, though to
    a comparatively limited extent, in his own engines.

       *       *       *       *       *

    Thus during the five years from 1761-66 Watt had worked out all
    the principles and invented all that was essential in the
    details for realising them in the most perfect steam engines of
    the present day.

So passes Watt from view as the discoverer and inventor of the "most powerful instrument in
the hands of man to alter the face of the physical world." He takes his place "at the head
of all inventors of all ages and all nations."

CHAPTER XI

WATT, THE MAN

Of Watt, the genius, possessed of abilities far beyond those of other men, a scientist and
philosopher, a mechanician and a craftsman, one who gravitated without effort to the top of
every society, and who, even when a young workman, made his workshop the meeting-place of the
leaders of Glasgow University for the interchange of views upon the highest and most abstruse
subjects--with all this we have already dealt, but it is only part, and not the nobler part.
He excelled all his fellows in knowledge, but there is much beyond mere knowledge in man. Strip
Watt of all those commanding talents that brought him primacy without effort, for no man ever
avoided precedence more persistently than he, and the question still remains: what manner of
man was he, as man? Surely our readers would esteem the task but half done that revealed only
what was unusual in Watt's head. What of his heart? is naturally asked. We hasten to record
that in the domain of the personal graces and virtues, we have evidence of his excellence as
copious and assured as for his pre-eminence in invention and discovery.

We cite the testimony of those who knew him best. It is seldom that a great man is so fortunate
in his eulogists. The picture drawn of him by his friend, Lord Jeffrey, must rank as one of
the finest ever produced, as portrait and tribute combined. That it is a discriminating statement,
altho so eulogistic, may well be accepted, since numerous contributory proofs are given by
others of Watt's personal characteristics. Says Lord Jeffrey:

    Independently of his great attainments in mechanics, Mr. Watt
    was an extraordinary, and in many respects a wonderful man.
    Perhaps no individual in his age possessed so much and such
    varied and exact information--had read so much, or remembered
    what he had read so accurately and well. He had infinite
    quickness of apprehension, a prodigious memory, and a certain
    rectifying and methodising power of understanding, which
    extracted something precious out of all that was presented to
    it. His stores of miscellaneous knowledge were immense, and yet
    less astonishing than the command he had at all times over them.
    It seemed as if every subject that was casually started in
    conversation with him, had been that which he had been last
    occupied in studying and exhausting; such was the copiousness,
    the precision, and the admirable clearness of the information
    which he poured out upon it without effort or hesitation. Nor
    was this promptitude and compass of knowledge confined in any
    degree to the studies connected with his ordinary pursuits. That
    he should have been minutely and extensively skilled in
    chemistry and the arts, and in most of the branches of physical
    science, might perhaps have been conjectured; but it could not
    have been inferred from his usual occupations, and probably is
    not generally known, that he was curiously learned in many
    branches of antiquity, metaphysics, medicine, and etymology, and
    perfectly at home in all the details of architecture, music and
    law. He was well acquainted, too, with most of the modern
    languages, and familiar with their most recent literature. Nor
    was it at all extraordinary to hear the great mechanician and
    engineer detailing and expounding, for hours together, the
    metaphysical theories of the German logicians, or criticising
    the measures or the matter of the German poetry.

    His astonishing memory was aided, no doubt, in a great measure,
    by a still higher and rarer faculty--by his power of digesting
    and arranging in its proper place all the information he
    received, and of casting aside and rejecting, as it were
    instinctively, whatever was worthless or immaterial. Every
    conception that was suggested to his mind seemed instantly to
    take its place among its other rich furniture, and to be
    condensed into the smallest and most convenient form. He never
    appeared, therefore, to be at all encumbered or perplexed with
    the verbiage of the dull books he perused, or the idle talk to
    which he listened; but to have at once extracted, by a kind of
    intellectual alchemy, all that was worthy of attention, and to
    have reduced it, for his own use, to its true value and to its
    simplest form. And thus it often happened that a great deal more
    was learned from his brief and vigorous account of the theories
    and arguments of tedious writers, than an ordinary student could
    ever have derived from the most painful study of the originals,
    and that errors and absurdities became manifest from the mere
    clearness and plainness of his statement of them, which might
    have deluded and perplexed most of his hearers without that
    invaluable assistance.

    It is needless to say, that, with those vast resources, his
    conversation was at all times rich and instructive in no
    ordinary degree; but it was, if possible, still more pleasing
    than wise, and had all the charms of familiarity, with all the
    substantial treasures of knowledge. No man could be more social
    in his spirit, less assuming or fastidious in his manners, or
    more kind and indulgent toward all who approached him. He rather
    liked to talk, at least in his latter years, but though he took
    a considerable share of the conversation, he rarely suggested
    the topics on which it was to turn, but readily and quietly took
    up whatever was presented by those around him, and astonished
    the idle and barren propounders of an ordinary theme, by the
    treasures which he drew from the mine they had inconsciously
    opened. He generally seemed, indeed, to have no choice or
    predilection for one subject of discourse rather than another;
    but allowed his mind, like a great cyclopædia, to be opened at
    any letter his associates might choose to turn up, and only
    endeavour to select, from his inexhaustible stores, what might
    be best adapted to the taste of his present hearers. As to their
    capacity he gave himself no trouble; and, indeed, such was his
    singular talent for making all things plain, clear, and
    intelligible, that scarcely any one could be aware of such a
    deficiency in his presence. His talk, too, though overflowing
    with information, had no resemblance to lecturing or solemn
    discoursing, but, on the contrary, was full of colloquial spirit
    and pleasantry. He had a certain quiet and grave humour, which
    ran through most of his conversation, and a vein of temperate
    jocularity, which gave infinite zest and effect to the condensed
    and inexhaustible information which formed its main staple and
    characteristic. There was a little air of affected testiness,
    and a tone of pretended rebuke and contradiction, with which he
    used to address his younger friends, that was always felt by
    them as an endearing mark of his kindness and familiarity, and
    prized accordingly, far beyond all the solemn compliments that
    ever proceeded from the lips of authority. His voice was deep
    and powerful, although he commonly spoke in a low and somewhat
    monotonous tone, which harmonised admirably with the weight and
    brevity of his observations, and set off to the greatest
    advantage the pleasant anecdotes, which he delivered with the
    same grave brow, and the same calm smile playing soberly on his
    lips. There was nothing of effort indeed, or impatience, any
    more than pride or levity, in his demeanour; and there was a
    finer expression of reposing strength, and mild self-possession
    in his manner, than we ever recollect to have met with in any
    other person. He had in his character the utmost abhorrence for
    all sorts of forwardness, parade and pretensions; and, indeed,
    never failed to put all such impostures out of countenance, by
    the manly plainness and honest intrepidity of his language and
    deportment. His health,
    which was delicate from his youth upwards, seemed to become
    firmer as he advanced in years; and he preserved, up almost to
    the last moment of his existence, not only the full command of
    his extraordinary intellect, but all the alacrity of spirit, and
    the social gaiety, which had illumined his happiest days. His
    friends in this part of the country never saw him more full of
    intellectual vigour and colloquial animation, never more
    delightful or more instructive, than in his last visit to
    Scotland in the autumn of 1817. Indeed, it was after that time
    that he applied himself, with all the ardour of early life, to
    the invention of a machine for mechanically copying all sorts of
    sculpture and statuary; and distributed among his friends some
    of its earliest performances, as the productions of a young
    artist just entering on his eighty-third year.

Professor Robison, the most intimate friend of his youth, records that:

    When to the superiority of knowledge in his own line, which
    every man confessed, there was joined the naïve simplicity and
    candour of his character, it is no wonder that the attachment of
    his acquaintances was so strong. I have seen something of the
    world and I am obliged to say that I never saw such another
    instance of general and cordial attachment to a person whom all
    acknowledged to be their superior. But this superiority was
    concealed under the most amiable candour, and liberal allowance
    of merit to every man. Mr. Watt was the first to ascribe to the
    ingenuity of a friend things which were very often nothing but
    his own surmises followed out and embodied by another. I am well
    entitled to say this, and have often experienced it in my own
    case.

Lord Brougham says:

    We have been considering this eminent person as yet only in his
    public capacity, as a benefactor of mankind by his fertile
    genius and indomitable perseverance; and the best portraiture of
    his intellectual character was to be found in the description of
    his attainments. It is, however, proper to survey him also in
    private life. He was unexceptionable in all its relations; and
    as his activity was unmeasured, and his taste anything rather
    than fastidious, he both was master of every variety of
    knowledge, and was tolerant of discussion on subjects of very
    subordinate importance compared with those on which he most
    excelled. Not only all the sciences from the mathematics and
    astronomy, down to botany, received his diligent attention, but
    he was tolerably read in the lighter kinds of literature,
    delighting in poetry and other works of fiction, full of the
    stores of ancient literature, and readily giving himself up to
    the critical disquisitions of commentators, and to discussion on
    the fancies of etymology. His manners were most attractive from
    their perfect nature and simplicity. His conversation was rich
    in the measure which such stores and such easy taste might lead
    us to expect, and it astonished all listeners with its admirable
    precision, with the extraordinary memory it displayed, with the
    distinctness it seemed to have, as if his mind had separate
    niches for keeping each particular, and with its complete
    rejection of all worthless and superfluous matter, as if the
    same mind had some fine machine for acting like a fan, casting
    off the chaff and the husk. But it had besides a peculiar charm
    from the pleasure he took in conveying information where he was
    peculiarly able to give it, and in joining with entire candor
    whatever discussion happened to arise. Even upon matters on
    which he was entitled to pronounce with absolute authority, he
    never laid down the law, but spoke like any other partaker of
    the conversation. I had the happiness of knowing Mr. Watt for
    many years, in the intercourse of private life; and I will take
    upon me to bear a testimony, in which all who had that
    gratification I am sure will join, that they who only knew his
    public merit, prodigious as that was, knew but half his worth.
    Those who were admitted to his society will readily allow that
    anything more pure, more candid, more simple, more scrupulously
    loving of justice, than the whole habits of his life and
    conversation proved him to be, was never known in society.

The descriptions given by Lords Brougham, Jeffrey, the genial Sir Walter, and others, of Watt's
universality of knowledge and his charm in discourse recall Canterbury's exordium:

    Hear him but reason in divinity
    And, all-admiring, with an inward wish consumed,
    You would desire the king were made a prelate;
    Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
    You would say--it hath been all in all his study:
    List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
    A fearful battle rendered you in music.
    Turn him to any cause of policy,
    The Gordian knot of it he will unloose
    Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks,
    The air, a chartered libertine, is still,
    And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears
    To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences.

If Watt fell somewhat short of this, so no doubt did the king so greatly extolled, and much
more so, probably, than the versatile Watt.

Dr. Black, the discoverer of latent heat, upon his death-bed, hears that the Watt patent has
been sustained, and is for the time restored again to interest in life. He whispers that he
"could not help rejoicing at anything that benefited Jamie Watt."

The Earl of Liverpool, prime minister, stated that Watt was remarkable for

    the simplicity of his character, the modesty of his nature, the
    absence of anything like presumption and ostentation, the
    unwillingness to obtrude himself, not only upon the great and
    powerful, but even on those of the scientific world to which he
    belonged. A more excellent and amiable man in all the relations
    of life I believe never existed.

There can be no question that we have for our example, in the man Watt, a nature cast in the
finest mold, seemingly composed of every creature's best. Transcendent as were his abilities
as inventor and discoverer, we are persuaded that our readers will feel that his qualities
as a man in all the relations of life were not less so, nor less worthy of record. His supreme
abilities we can neither acquire nor emulate. These are individual and ended with him. But
his virtues and charms as our fellow-man still shine steadily upon our paths and will shine
upon those of our successors for ages to come, we trust not without leading us and them to
tread some part of the way toward the acquisition of such qualities as enabled the friend of
James Watt to declare his belief that "a more excellent and amiable man in all the relations
of life never existed." A nobler tribute was never paid by man to man, yet was it not undeserved.

So passes Jamie Watt, the man, from view--a man who attracted, delighted, impressed, instructed
and made lifelong friends of his fellows, to a degree unsurpassed, perhaps unequalled.
