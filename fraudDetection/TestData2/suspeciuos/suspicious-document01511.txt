"He was completely upset," said the doctor.  "I suggested that he go somewhere to rest up a
few days, so he took his tackle and went fishing, and to the farm."

"Shouldn't he have stayed and faced it?" asked Kate.

"There was nothing for him to face, except himself, Kate," said the doctor.

Kate shook her head.  She looked ghastly ill.

"Doctor," she said, "couldn't you have let me die?"

"And left your son and your little daughter to them?" he asked. "No, Kate, I couldn't have
let you die; because you've your work in the world under your hand right now."

He said that because when he said "left your son and your little daughter to them," Kate had
reached over and laid her hand possessively, defensively, on the little, squirming bundle,
which was all Dr. James asked of her.  Presently she looked the doctor straight in the face.
"Exactly what do you know?" she asked.

"Everything," said the doctor.  "And you?"

"Everything," said Kate.

There was a long silence.  Then Kate spoke slowly:  "That George didn't know that he shouldn't
have touched that man, proves him completely incompetent," she said.  "That he did, and didn't
have the courage to face the results, proves him lacking in principle. He's not fit for either
work to which he aspires."

"You are talking too much," said the doctor.  "Nurse Nepple is in charge here, and Aunt Ollie.
George's mother went to the farm to cook for him.  You're in the hands of two fine women, who
will make you comfortable.  You have escaped lasting disgrace with your skirts clear, now rest
and be thankful."

"I can't rest until I know one thing," said Kate.  "You're not going to allow George to kill
any one else?"

"No," said the doctor.  "I regretted telling him very much; but I had to tell him THAT could
not happen."

"And about the school?" she asked.  "I half thought he might get it."

"He WON'T!" said the doctor.  "I'm in a position to know that. Now try to take some rest."

Kate waved toward the babies:  "Will you please take them away until they need me?" she asked.

"Of course," said the doctor.  "But don't you want to see them, Kate? There isn't a mark or
blemish on either of them.  The boy weighs seven pounds and the girl six; they seem as perfect
as children can be."

"You needn't worry about that," said Kate.  "Twins are a Bates habit. My mother had three pairs,
always a boy and a girl, always big and sound as any children; mine will be all right, too."

The doctor started to turn back the blanket.  Kate turned her head away:  "Don't you think
I have had about enough at present?" she asked. "I'd stake my life that as a little further
piece of my punishment, the girl looks exactly like Mrs. Holt."

"By Jove," said the doctor, "I couldn't just think who it was."

He carried the babies from the room, lowered the blinds, and Kate tried to sleep, and did sleep,
because she was so exhausted she could not keep awake.

Later in the evening Aunt Ollie slipped in, and said George was in the woodhouse, almost crying
himself to death, and begging to see her.

"You tell him I'm too sick to be seen for at least a week," said Kate.

"But, my dear, he's so broken up; he feels so badly," begged Aunt Ollie.

"So do I," said Kate.  "I feel entirely too badly to be worried over seeing him.  I must take
the babies now."

"I do wish you would!" persisted Aunt Ollie.

"Well, I won't," said Kate.  "I don't care if I never see him again. He knows WHY he is crying;
ask him."

"I'll wager they ain't a word of truth in that tale they're telling," she said.

Kate looked straight at her:  "Well, for their sakes and my sake, and the babies' sake, don't
TALK about it."

"You poor thing!" said Aunt Ollie, "I'll do anything in the world to help you.  If ever you
need me, just call on me.  I'll go start him back in a hurry."

He came every night, but Kate steadily refused, until she felt able to sit up in a chair, to
see him, or his mother when she came to see the babies.  She had recovered rapidly, was over
the painful part of nursing the babies, and had a long talk with Aunt Ollie, before she consented
to see George.  At times she thought she never could see him again; at others, she realized
her helplessness. One can feel so much, and no more. And how can it matter with what pleasure
life tries to tempt one, or with what pain it seeks to maim and mar one's soul, if in the spectacle
of the lives of those who have never existed one has found the true secret of joy, and wept
away one's tears over their deaths who, like Cordelia and the daughter of Brabantio, can never
die?

ERNEST. Stop a moment.

It seems to me that in everything that you have said there is something
radically immoral.

GILBERT. All art is immoral.

ERNEST. All art?

GILBERT. Yes. For
emotion for the sake of emotion is the aim of art, and emotion for
the sake of action is the aim of life, and of that practical organisation
of life that we call society.

Kate sat straight up in bed:  "Oh, Aunt Ollie!  Would you?" she cried. "Would you?  That would
be a mercy to me; it would give George every chance to go straight, if there is a straight
impulse in him."

"Yes, I will," said Aunt Ollie, "and you needn't feel that I am getting the little end of the
bargain, either.  The only unpleasant thing about it will be my sister, and I'll undertake
to manage her.  I read a lot, an' I can always come to see you when mortal sperrits will bear
her no more.  She'll be no such trial to me, as she is to you."

"You're an angel," said Kate.  "You've given me hope where I had not a glimmer.  If I have
George out there alone, away from his mother, I can bring out all the good there is in him,
and we can get some results out of life, or I can assure myself that it is impossible, so that
I can quit with a clear conscience.  I do thank you."

"All right, then, I'll go out and begin packing my things, and see about moving this afternoon.
I'll leave my stoves, and beds, and tables, and chairs for you; you can use your wedding things,
and be downright comfortable.  I'll like living in town a spell real well."

So once more Kate saw hope a beckoning star in the distance, and ruffled the wings of the spirit
preparatory to another flight: only a short, humble flight this time, close earth; but still
as full of promise as life seemed to hold in any direction for her. She greeted George casually,
and as if nothing had happened, when she was ready to see him.

"You're at the place where words are not of the slightest use to me," she said.  "I'm giving
you one, and a final chance to ACT. This seems all that is open to us.  Go to work like a man,
and we will see what we can make of our last chance."

Kate was so glad when she sat in the carriage that was to take her from the house and the woman
she abominated that she could scarcely behave properly.  She clasped Adam tightly in her arms,
and felt truly his mother.  She reached over and tucked the blanket closer over Polly, but
she did not carry her, because she resembled her grandmother, while Adam was a Bates.

George drove carefully.  He was on behaviour too good to last, but fortunately both women with
him knew him well enough not to expect that it would.  When they came in sight of the house,
Kate could see that the grass beside the road had been cut, the trees trimmed, and Oh, joy,
the house freshly painted a soft, creamy white she liked, with a green roof.  Aunt Ollie explained
that she furnished the paint and George did the work.  He had swung oblong clothes baskets
from the ceiling of a big, cheery, old-fashioned bedroom for a cradle for each baby, and established
himself in a small back room adjoining the kitchen.  Kate said nothing about the arrangement,
because she supposed it had been made to give her more room, and that George might sleep in
peace, while she wrestled with two tiny babies.

There was no doubt about the wrestling.  The babies seemed of nervous temperament, sleeping
in short naps and lightly.  Kate was on her feet from the time she reached her new home, working
when she should not have worked; so that the result developed cross babies, each attacked with
the colic, which raged every night from six o'clock until twelve and after, both frequently
shrieking at the same time.  George did his share by going to town for a bottle of soothing
syrup, which Kate promptly threw in the creek.  Once he took Adam and began walking the floor
with him, extending his activities as far as the kitchen.  In a few minutes he had the little
fellow sound asleep and he did not waken until morning; then he seemed to droop and feel listless.
When he took the baby the second time and made the same trip to the kitchen, Kate laid Polly
on her bed and silently followed.  She saw George lay the baby on the table, draw a flask from
his pocket, pour a spoon partly full, filling it the remainder of the way from the teakettle.
As he was putting the spoon to the baby's lips, Kate stepped beside him and taking it, she
tasted the contents.  Then she threw the spoon into the dishpan standing near and picked up
the baby.

"I knew it!" she said.  "Only I didn't know what.  He acted like a drugged baby all last night
and to-day.  Since when did you begin carrying that stuff around with you, and feeding it to
tiny babies?"

"It's a good thing.  Dr. James recommended it.  He said it was harmful to let them strain themselves
crying, and very hard on you.  You could save yourself a lot," he urged.

"I need saving all right," said Kate, "but I haven't a picture of myself saving myself by drugging
a pair of tiny babies."

He slipped the bottle back in his pocket.  Kate stood looking at him so long and so intently,
he flushed and set the flask on a shelf in the pantry.  "It may come in handy some day when
some of us have a cold," he said.

Kate did her best, but she was so weakened by nursing both of the babies, by loss of sleep,
and overwork in the house, that she was no help whatever to George in getting in the fall crops
and preparing for spring.  She had lost none of her ambition, but there was a limit to her
capacity.

In the spring the babies were big and lusty, eating her up, and crying with hunger, until she
was forced to resort to artificial feeding in part, which did not agree with either of them.
As a saving of time and trouble she decided to nurse one and feed the other.  It was without
thought on her part, almost by chance, yet the chance was that she nursed Adam and fed Polly.
Then the babies began teething, so that she was rushed to find time to prepare three regular
meals a day, and as for the garden and poultry she had planned, George did what he pleased
about them, which was little, if anything.

He would raise so much to keep from being hungry, he would grow so many roots, and so much
cabbage for winter, he would tend enough corn for a team and to fatten pork; right there he
stopped and went fishing, while the flask was in evidence on the pantry shelf only two days.
Kate talked crop rotation, new seed, fertilization, until she was weary; George heartily agreed
with her, but put nothing of it all into practice.

"As soon as the babies are old enough to be taken out," she said, "things will be better. 
I just can't do justice to them and my work, too.  Three pairs!  My poor mother!  And she's
alive yet!  I marvel at it."

So they lived, and had enough to eat, and were clothed, but not one step did they advance toward
Kate's ideals of progression, economy, accumulation.  George always had a little money, more
than she could see how he got from the farming.  There were a few calves and pigs to sell occasionally;
she thought possibly he saved his share from them.

For four years, Kate struggled valiantly to keep pace with what her mother always had done,
and had required of her at home; but she learned long before she quit struggling that farming
with George was hopeless.  So at last she became so discouraged she began to drift into his
way of doing merely what would sustain them, and then reading, fishing, or sleeping the remainder
of the time.  She began teaching her children while very small, and daily they had their lessons
after dinner, while their father slept.

Kate thought often of what was happening to her; she hated it, she fought it; but with George
Holt for a partner she could not escape it. She lay awake nights, planning ways to make a start
toward prosperity; she propounded her ideas at breakfast.  To save time in getting him early
to work she began feeding the horses as soon as she was up, so that George could go to work
immediately after breakfast; but she soon found she might as well save her strength. He would
not start to harness until he had smoked, mostly three quarters of an hour.  That his neighbours
laughed at him and got ahead of him bothered him not at all.  All they said and all Kate said,
went, as he expressed it, "in at one ear, out at the other."

One day in going around the house Kate was suddenly confronted by a thing she might have seen
for three years, but had not noticed. Leading from the path of bare, hard-beaten earth that
ran around the house through the grass, was a small forking path not so wide and well defined,
yet a path, leading to George's window.  She stood staring at it a long time with a thoughtful
expression on her face.

That night she did not go to bed when she went to her room. Instead she slipped out into the
night and sitting under a sheltering bush she watched that window.  It was only a short time
until George crawled from it, went stealthily to the barn, and a few minutes later she saw
him riding barebacked on one of the horses he had bridled, down the footpath beside the stream
toward town.  She got up and crossing the barnyard shut the gate after him, and closed the
barn door.  She went back to the house and closed his window and lighting a lamp set it on
his dresser in front of his small clock.  His door was open in the morning when she passed
it on her way to the kitchen, so she got breakfast instead of feeding the horses.  He came
in slowly, furtively watching her.  She worked as usual, saying no unpleasant word.  At length
he could endure it no longer.

"Kate," he said, "I broke a bolt in the plow yesterday, and I never thought of it until just
as I was getting into bed, so to save time I rode in to Walden and got another last night.
Ain't I a great old economist, though?"

"You are a great something," she said.  "'Economist' would scarcely be my name for it.  Really,
George, can't you do better than that?"

"Better than what?" he demanded.

"Better than telling such palpable lies," she said.  "Better than crawling out windows instead
of using your doors like a man; better than being the most shiftless farmer of your neighbourhood
in the daytime, because you have spend most of your nights, God and probably all Walden know
how.  The flask and ready money I never could understand give me an inkling."

"Anything else?" he asked, sneeringly.

"Nothing at present," said Kate placidly.  "I probably could find plenty, if I spent even one
night in Walden when you thought I was asleep."

"Go if you like," he said.  "If you think I'm going to stay here, working like a dog all day,
year in and year out, to support a daughter of the richest man in the county and her kids,
you fool yourself.  If you want more than you got, call on your rich folks for it.  If you
want to go to town, either night or day, go for all I care.  Do what you damn please; that's
what I am going to do in the future and I'm glad you know it.  I'm tired climbing through windows
and slinking like a dog.  I'll come and go like other men after this."

"I don't know what other men you are referring to," said Kate. "You have a monopoly of your
kind in this neighbourhood; there is none other like you.  You crawl and slink as 'to the manner
born.'"

"Don't you go too far," he menaced with an ugly leer.

"Keep that for your mother," laughed Kate.  "You need never try a threat with me.  I am stronger
than you are, and you may depend upon it I shall see that my strength never fails me again.
I know now that you are all Nancy Ellen said you were."

"Well, if you married me knowing it, what are you going to do about it?" he sneered.

"I didn't know it then.  I thought I knew you.  I thought she had been misinformed," said Kate,
in self-defence.

"Well," he said insultingly, "if you hadn't been in such a big hurry, you could soon have found
out all you wanted to know.  I took advantage of it, but I never did understand your rush."

"You never will," said Kate.

Then she arose and went to see if the children had wakened.  All day she was thinking so deeply
she would stumble over the chairs in her preoccupation.  George noticed it, and it frightened
him. After supper he came and sat on the porch beside her.

"Kate," he said, "as usual you are 'making mountains out of mole hills.'  It doesn't damn a
fellow forever to ride or walk, I almost always walk, into town in the evening, to see the
papers and have a little visit with the boys.  Work all day in a field is mighty lonesome;
a man has got the have a little change.  I don't deny a glass of beer once in awhile, or a
game of cards with the boys occasionally; but if you have lived with me over five years here,
and never suspected it before, it can't be so desperately bad, can it?  Come now, be fair!"

"It's no difference whether I am fair or unfair," Kate said, wearily. "It explains why you
simply will not brace up, and be a real man, and do a man's work in the world, and achieve
a man's success."

"Who can get anywhere, splitting everything in halves?" he demanded.

"The most successful men in this neighbourhood got their start exactly that way," she said.

"Ah, well, farming ain't my job, anyway," he said.  "I always did hate it.  I always will.
If I could have a little capital to start with, I know a trick that would suit you, and make
us independent in no time."

Kate said no word, and seeing she was not going to, he continued: "I've thought about this
till I've got it all down fine, and it's a great scheme; you'll admit that, even angry as you
are.  It is this:  get enough together to build a saw mill on my strip of ravine.  A little
damming would make a free water power worth a fortune.  I could hire a good man to run the
saw and do the work, and I could take a horse and ride, or drive around among the farmers I
know, and buy up timber cheaper than most men could get it.  I could just skin the eyes out
of them."

"Did it ever occur to you that you could do better by being honest?" asked Kate, wearily.

"Aw, well, Smarty!  you know I didn't mean that literally!" he scoffed. "You know I only meant
I could talk, and jolly, and buy at bed-rock prices; I know where to get the timber, and the
two best mill men in the country; we are near the railroad; it's the dandiest scheme that ever
struck Walden.  What do you think about it?"

"I think if Adam had it he'd be rich from it in ten years," she said, quietly.

"Then you DO think it's a bully idea," he cried.  "You WOULD try it if we had a chance?"

"I might," said Kate.

"You know," he cried, jumping up in excitement, "I've never mentioned this to a soul, but I've
got it all thought out.  Would you go to see your brother Adam, and see if you could get him
to take an interest for young Adam?  He could manage the money himself."

"I wouldn't go to a relative of mine for a cent, even if the children were starving," said
Kate.  "Get, and keep, THAT clear in your head."

"But you think there is something in it?" he persisted.

"I know there is," said Kate with finality.  "In the hands of the right man, and with the capital
to start."

"Kate, you can be the meanest," he said.

"I didn't intend to be, in this particular instance," she said. "But honestly, George, what
have I ever seen of you in the way of financial success in the past that would give me hope
for the future?"

"I know it," he said, "but I've never struck exactly the right thing. This is what I could
make a success of, and I would make a good big one, you bet!  Kate, I'll not go to town another
night. I'll stop all that."  He drew the flask from his pocket and smashed it against the closest
tree.  "And I'll stop all there ever was of that, even to a glass of beer on a hot day; if
you say so, if you'll stand by me this once more, if I fail this time, I'll never ask you again;
honest, I won't."

"If I had money, I'd try it, keeping the building in my own name and keeping the books myself;
but I've none, and no way to get any, as you know," she said.  "I can see what could be done,
but I'm helpless."

"I'M NOT!" said George.  "I've got it all worked out.  You see I was doing something useful
with my head, if I wasn't always plowing as fast as you thought I should.  If you'll back me,
if you'll keep books, if you'll handle the money until she is paid back, I know Aunt Ollie
will sell enough of this land to build the mill and buy the machinery.  She could keep the
house, and orchard, and barn, and a big enough piece, say forty acres, to live on and keep
all of us in grub.  She and Mother could move out here--she said the other day she was tired
of town and getting homesick--and we could go to town to put the children in school, and be
on the job.  I won't ever ask you and Mother to live together again.  Kate, will you go in
with me?  Will you talk to Aunt Ollie?  Will you let me show you, and explain, and prove to you?"

"I won't be a party to anything that would even remotely threaten to lose Aunt Ollie's money
for her," she said.

"She's got nobody on earth but me.  It's all mine in the end.  Why not let me have this wonderful
chance with it?  Kate, will you?" he begged.

"I'll think about it," she conceded.  "If I can study out a sure, honourable way.  I'll promise
to think.  Now go out there, and hunt the last scrap of that glass; the children may cut their
feet in the morning."

Then Kate went in to bed.  If she had looked from her window, she might have seen George scratching
matches and picking pieces of glass from the grass.  When he came to the bottom of the bottle
with upstanding, jagged edges, containing a few drops, he glanced at her room, saw that she
was undressing in the dark, and lifting it, he poured the liquid on his tongue to the last
drop that would fall.

CHAPTER XVI

THE WORK OF THE SUN

BEFORE Kate awakened the following morning George was out feeding the horses, cattle, and chickens,
doing the milking, and working like the proverbial beaver.  By the time breakfast was ready,
he had convinced himself that he was a very exemplary man, while he expected Kate to be convinced
also.  He stood ready and willing to forgive her for every mean deceit and secret sin he ever
had committed, or had it in his heart to commit in the future.  All the world was rosy with
him, he was flying with the wings of hope straight toward a wonderful achievement that would
bring pleasure and riches, first to George Holt, then to his wife and children, then to the
old aunt he really cared more for than any one else.

Incidentally, his mother might have some share, while he would bring such prosperity and activity
to the village that all Walden would forget every bad thing it had ever thought or known of
him, and delight to pay him honour.  Kate might have guessed all this when she saw the pails
full of milk on the table, and heard George whistling "Hail the Conquering Hero Comes," as
he turned the cows into the pasture; but she had not slept well.  Most of the night she had
lain staring at the ceiling, her brain busy with calculations, computations, most of all with
personal values.

She dared not be a party to anything that would lose Aunt Ollie her land; that was settled;
but if she went into the venture herself, if she kept the deeds in Aunt Ollie's name, the bank
account in hers, drew all the checks, kept the books, would it be safe?  Could George buy timber
as he thought; could she, herself, if he failed?  The children were old enough to be in school
now, she could have much of the day, she could soon train Polly and Adam to do even more than
sweep and run errands; the scheme could be materialized in the Bates way, without a doubt;
but could it be done in a Bates way, hampered and impeded by George Holt?  Was the plan feasible,
after all?  She entered into the rosy cloud enveloping the kitchen without ever catching the
faintest gleam of its hue.  George came to her the instant he saw her and tried to put his
arm around her.  Kate drew back and looked at him intently.

"Aw, come on now, Kate," he said.  "Leave out the heroics and be human. I'll do exactly as
you say about everything if you will help me wheedle Aunt Ollie into letting me have the money."

Kate stepped back and put out her hands defensively:  "A rare bargain," she said, "and one
eminently worthy of you.  You'll do what I say, if I'll do what you say, without the slightest
reference as to whether it impoverishes a woman who has always helped and befriended you. 
You make me sick!"

"What's biting you now?" he demanded, sullenly.

Kate stood tall and straight before and above him

"If you have a good plan, if you can prove that it will work, what is the necessity for 'wheedling'
anybody?  Why not state what you propose in plain, unequivocal terms, and let the dear, old
soul, who has done so much for us already, decide what she will do?"

"That's what I meant!  That's all I meant!" he cried.

"In that case, 'wheedle' is a queer word to use."

"I believe you'd throw up the whole thing; I believe you'd let the chance to be a rich woman
slip through your fingers, if it all depended on your saying only one word you thought wasn't
quite straight," he cried, half in assertion, half in question.

"I honour you in that belief," said Kate.  "I most certainly would."

"Then you turn the whole thing down?  You won't have anything to do with it?" he cried, plunging
into stoop-shouldered, mouth-sagging despair.

"Oh, I didn't SAY that!" said Kate.  "Give me time!  Let me think! I've got to know that there
isn't a snare in it, from the title of the land to the grade of the creek bed.  Have you investigated
that?  Is your ravine long enough and wide enough to dam it high enough at our outlet to get
your power, and yet not back water on the road, and the farmers above you?  Won't it freeze
in winter? and can you get strong enough power from water to run a large saw? I doubt it!"

"Oh, gee!   I never thought about that!" he cried.

"And if it would work, did you figure the cost of a dam into your estimate of the building
and machinery?"

He snapped his fingers in impatience.

"By heck!" he cried, "I forgot THAT, too!  But that wouldn't cost much. Look what we did in
that ravine just for fun.  Why, we could build that dam ourselves!"

"Yes, strong enough for conditions in September, but what about the January freshet?" she said.

"Croak!  Croak!  You blame old raven," cried George.

"And have you thought," continued Kate, "that there is no room on the bank toward town to set
your mill, and it wouldn't be allowed there, if there were?"

"You bet I have!" he said defiantly.  "I'm no such slouch as you think me.  I've even stepped
off the location!"

"Then," said Kate, "will you build a bridge across the ravine to reach it, or will you buy
a strip from Linn and build a road?"

George collapsed with a groan.

"That's the trouble with you," said Kate.  "You always build your castle with not even sand
for a foundation.  The most nebulous of rosy clouds serve you as perfectly as granite blocks.
Before you go glimmering again, double your estimate to cover a dam and a bridge, and a lot
of incidentals that no one ever seems able to include in a building contract.  And whatever
you do, keep a still head until we get these things figured, and have some sane idea of what
the venture would cost."

"How long will it take?" he said sullenly.

"I haven't an idea.  I'd have to go the Hartley and examine the records and be sure that there
was no flaw in the deeds to the land; but the first thing is to get a surveyor and know for
sure if you have a water-power that will work and not infringe on your neighbours.  A thing
like this can't be done in a few minutes' persuasive conversation.  It will take weeks."

It really seemed as if it would take months.  Kate went to Walden that afternoon, set the children
playing in the ravine while she sketched it, made the best estimate she could of its fall,
and approved the curve on the opposite bank which George thought could be cleared for a building
site and lumber yard.  Then she added a location for a dam and a bridge site, and went home
to figure and think.  The further she went in these processes the more hopeless the project
seemed.  She soon learned that there must be an engine with a boiler to run the saw.  The dam
could be used only to make a pond to furnish the water needed; but at that it would be cheaper
than to dig a cistern or well.  She would not even suggest to Aunt Ollie to sell any of the
home forty.  The sale of the remainder at the most hopeful price she dared estimate would not
bring half the money needed, and it would come in long-time payments. Lumber, bricks, machinery,
could not be had on time of any length, while wages were cash every Saturday night.

"It simply can't be done," said Kate, and stopped thinking about it, so far as George knew.

He was at once plunged into morose moping; he became sullen and indifferent about the work,
ugly with Kate and the children, until she was driven almost frantic, and projects nearly as
vague as some of George's began to float through her head.

One Saturday morning Kate had risen early and finished cleaning up her house, baking, and scrubbing
porches.  She had taken a bath to freshen and cool herself and was standing before her dresser,
tucking the last pins in her hair, when she heard a heavy step on the porch and a loud knock
on the screen door.  She stood at an angle where she could peep; she looked as she reached
for her dress.  What she saw carried her to the door forgetful of the dress.  Adam, Jr., stood
there, white and shaken, steadying himself against the casing.

"Adam!" cried Kate.  "Is Mother--?"

He shook his head.

"Father--?" she panted.

He nodded, seeming unable to speak.  Kate's eyes darkened and widened. She gave Adam another
glance and opened the door.  "Come in," she said. "When did it happen?  How did he get hurt?"

In that moment she recalled that she had left her father in perfect health, she had been gone
more than seven years.  In that time he could not fail to illness; how he had been hurt was
her first thought.  As she asked the question, she stepped into her room and snatched up her
second best summer dress, waiting for Adam to speak as she slipped into it.  But speaking seemed
to be a very difficult thing for Adam.  He was slow in starting and words dragged and came
singly: "Yesterday--tired--big dinner--awful hot--sunstroke--"

"He's gone?" she cried.

Adam nodded in that queer way again.

"Why did you come?  Does Mother want me?" the questions leaped from Kate's lips; her eyes implored
him.  Adam was too stricken to heed his sister's unspoken plea.

"Course," he said.  "All there--your place--I want you.  Only one in the family--not stark mad!"

Kate straightened tensely and looked at him again.  "All right," she said.  "I can throw a
few things in my telescope, write the children a note to take to their father in the field,
and we can stop in Walden and send Aunt Ollie out to cook for them; I can go as well as not,
for as long as Mother wants me."

"Hurry!" said Adam.

In her room Kate stood still a second, her eyes narrow, her underlip sucked in, her heart almost
stopped.  Then she said aloud:  "Father's sons have wished he would die too long for his death
to strike even the most tolerant of them like that. Something dreadful has happened.  I wonder
to my soul--!"

She waited until they were past Hartley and then she asked suddenly: "Adam, what is the matter?"

Then Adam spoke:  "I am one of a pack of seven poor fools, and every other girl in the family
has gone raving mad, so I thought I'd come after you, and see if you had sense, or reason,
or justice, left in you."

"What do you want of me?" she asked dazedly.

"I want you to be fair, to be honest, to do as you'd be done by. You came to me when you were
in trouble," he reminded her.

Kate could not prevent the short laugh that sprang to her lips, nor what she said: "And you
would not lift a finger; young Adam MADE his MOTHER help me.  Why don't you go to George for
what you want?"

Adam lost all self-control and swore sulphurously.

"I thought you'd be different," he said, "but I see you are going to be just like the rest
of the--!"

"Stop that!" said Kate.  "You're talking about my sisters--and yours. Stop this wild talk,
and tell me exactly what is the matter."

"I'm telling nothing," said Adam.  "You can find out what is the matter and go it with the
rest of them, when you get there. Mother said this morning she wished you were there, because
you'd be the only SANE one in the family, so I thought I'd bring you; but I wish now I hadn't
done it, for it stands to reason that you will join the pack, and run as fast as the rest of
the wolves."

"FROM a prairie fire, or TO a carcass?" asked Kate.

"I told you, you could find out when you got there.  I'm not going to have them saying I influenced
you, or bribed you," he said.

"Do you really think that they think you could, Adam?" asked Kate, wonderingly.

"I have said all I'm going to say," said Adam, and then he began driving his horse inhumanely
fast, for the heat was deep, slow, and burning.

"Adam, is there any such hurry?" asked Kate.  "You know you are abusing your horse dreadfully."

Adam immediately jerked the horse with all his might, and slashed the length of its body with
two long stripes that rapidly raised in high welts, so Kate saw that he was past reasoning
with and said no other word.  She tried to think who would be at home, how they would treat
her, the Prodigal, who had not been there in seven years; and suddenly it occurred to Kate
that, if she had known all she now knew in her youth, and had the same decision to make again
as when she knew nothing, she would have taken wing, just as she had.  She had made failures,
she had hurt herself, mind and body, but her honour, her self-respect were intact. Suddenly
she sat straight.  She was glad that she had taken a bath, worn a reasonably decent dress,
and had a better one in the back of the buggy.  She would cut the Gordian knot with a vengeance.
She would not wait to see how they treated her, she would treat them!  As for Adam's state,
there was only one surmise she could make, and that seemed so incredible, she decided to wait
until her mother told her all about whatever the trouble was.

As they came in sight of the house, queer feelings took possession of Kate.  She struggled
to think kindly of her father; she tried to feel pangs of grief over his passing.  She was
too forthright and had too good memory to succeed.  Home had been so unbearable that she had
taken desperate measures to escape it, but as the white house with its tree and shrub filled
yard could be seen more plainly, Kate suddenly was filled with the strongest possessive feeling
she ever had known.  It was home.  It was her home.  Her place was there, even as Adam had
said.  She felt a sudden revulsion against herself that she had stayed away seven years; she
should have taken her chances and at least gone to see her mother.  She leaned from the buggy
and watched for the first glimpse of the tall, gaunt, dark woman, who had brought their big
brood into the world and stood squarely with her husband, against every one of them, in each
thing he proposed.

Now he was gone.  No doubt he had carried out his intentions. No doubt she was standing by
him as always.  Kate gathered her skirts, but Adam passed the house, driving furiously as ever,
and he only slackened speed when he was forced to at the turn from the road to the lane.  He
stopped the buggy in the barnyard, got out, and began unharnessing the horse.  Kate sat still
and watched him until he led it away, then she stepped down and started across the barnyard,
down the lane leading to the dooryard.  As she closed the yard gate and rounded a widely spreading
snowball bush, her heart was pounding wildly.  What was coming?  How would the other boys act,
if Adam, the best balanced man of them all, was behaving as he was?  How would her mother greet
her? With the thought, Kate realized that she was so homesick for her mother that she would
do or give anything in the world to see her.  Then there was a dragging step, a short, sharp
breath, and wheeling, Kate stood facing her mother.  She had come from the potato patch back
of the orchard, carrying a pail of potatoes in each hand.  Her face was haggard, her eyes bloodshot,
her hair falling in dark tags, her cheeks red with exertion.  They stood facing each other.
At the first glimpse Kate cried, "Oh, Mother," and sprang toward her. Then she stopped, while
her heart again failed her, for from the astonishment on her mother's face, Kate saw instantly
that she was surprised, and had neither sent for nor expected her.  She was nauseatingly disappointed.
Adam had said she was wanted, had been sent for.  Kate's face was twitching, her lips quivering,
but she did not hesitate more than an instant.

"I see you were not expecting me," she said.  "I'm sorry.  Adam came after me.  I wouldn't
have come if he hadn't said you sent for me."

Kate paused a minute hopefully.  Her mother looked at her steadily.

"I'm sorry," Kate repeated.  "I don't know why he said that."

By that time the pain in her heart was so fierce she caught her breath sharply, and pressed
her hand hard against her side.  Her mother stooped, set down the buckets, and taking off her
sunbonnet, wiped the sweat from her lined face with the curtain.

"Well, I do," she said tersely.

"Why?" demanded Kate.

"To see if he could use you to serve his own interests, of course," answered her mother.  "He
lied good and hard when he said I sent for you; I didn't.  I probably wouldn't a-had the sense
to do it.  But since you are here, I don't mind telling you that I never was so glad to see
any one in all my born days."

Mrs. Bates drew herself full height, set her lips, stiffened her jaw, and again used the bonnet
skirt on her face and neck.  Kate picked up the potatoes, to hide the big tears that gushed
from her eyes, and leading the way toward the house she said:  "Come over here in the shade.
Why should you be out digging potatoes?"

"Oh, they's enough here, and willing enough," said Mrs. Bates. "Slipped off to get away from
them.  It was the quietest and the peacefullest out there, Kate.  I'd most liked to stay all
day, but it's getting on to dinner time, and I'm short of potatoes."

"Never mind the potatoes," said Kate.  "Let the folks serve themselves if they are hungry."

She went to the side of the smoke house, picked up a bench turned up there, and carrying it
to the shady side of a widely spreading privet bush, she placed it where it would be best screened
from both house and barn.  Then setting the potatoes in the shade, she went to her mother,
put her arm around her, and drew her to the seat.  She took her handkerchief and wiped her
face, smoothed back her straggled hair, and pulling out a pin, fastened the coil better.

"Now rest a bit," she said, "and then tell me why you are glad to see me, and exactly what
you'd like me to do here.  Mind, I've been away seven years, and Adam told me not a word, except
that Father was gone."

"Humph!  All missed the mark again," commented Mrs. Bates dryly. "They all said he'd gone to
fill you up, and get you on his side."

"Mother, what is the trouble?" asked Kate.  "Take your time and tell me what has happened,
and what YOU want, not what Adam wants."

Mrs. Bates relaxed her body a trifle, but gripped her hands tightly together in her lap.

"Well, it was quick work," she said.  "It all came yesterday afternoon just like being hit
by lightning.  Pa hadn't failed a particle that any one could see.  Ate a big dinner of ham
an' boiled dumplings, an' him an' Hiram was in the west field.  It was scorchin' hot an' first
Hiram saw, Pa was down.  Sam Langley was passin' an' helped get him in, an' took our horse
an' ran for Robert.  He was in the country but Sam brought another doctor real quick, an' he
seemed to fetch Pa out of it in good shape, so we thought he'd be all right, mebby by morning,
though the doctor said he'd have to hole up a day or two.  He went away, promisin' to send
Robert back, and Hiram went home to feed.  I set by Pa fanning him an' putting cloths on his
head.  All at once he began to chill.

"We thought it was only the way a-body was with sunstroke, and past pilin' on blankets, we
didn't pay much attention.  He SAID he was all right, so I went to milk.  Before I left I gave
him a drink, an' he asked me to feel in his pants pocket an' get the key an' hand him the deed
box, till he'd see if everything was right. Said he guessed he'd had a close call.  You know
how he was.  I got him the box and went to do the evening work.  I hurried fast as I could.
Coming back, clear acrost the yard I smelt burning wool, an' I dropped the milk an' ran. I
dunno no more about just what happened 'an you do.  The house was full of smoke.  Pa was on
the floor, most to the sitting-room door, his head and hair and hands awfully burned, his shirt
burned off, laying face down, and clear gone.  The minute I seen the way he laid, I knew he
was gone.  The bed was pourin' smoke and one little blaze about six inches high was shootin'
up to the top.  I got that out, and then I saw most of the fire was smothered between the blankets
where he'd thrown them back to get out of the bed.  I dunno why he fooled with the lamp. It
always stood on the little table in his reach, but it was light enough to read fine print.
All I can figure is that the light was going out of his EYES, an' he thought IT WAS GETTIN'
DARK, so he tried to light the lamp to see the deeds.  He was fingerin' them when I left, but
he didn't say he couldn't see them.  The lamp was just on the bare edge of the table, the wick
way up an' blackened, the chimney smashed on the floor, the bed afire."

"Those deeds are burned?" gasped Kate.  "All of them?  Are they all gone?"

"Every last one," said Mrs. Bates.

"Well, if ONE is gone, thank God they all are," said Kate.

Her mother turned swiftly and caught her arm.

"Say that again!" she cried eagerly.

"Maybe I'm WRONG about it, but it's what I think," said Kate.  "If the boys are crazy over
all of them being gone, they'd do murder if part had theirs, and the others had not."

Mrs. Bates doubled over on Kate's shoulder suddenly and struggled with an inward spasm.

"You poor thing," said Kate.  "This is dreadful.  All of us know how you loved him, how you
worked together.  Can you think of anything I can do?  Is there any special thing the matter?"

"I'm afraid!" whispered Mrs. Bates.  "Oh, Katie, I'm so afraid. You know how SET he was, you
know how he worked himself and all of us--he had to know what he was doing, when he fought
the fire till the shirt burned off him"--her voice dropped to a harsh whisper--"what do you
s'pose he's doing now?"

Any form of religious belief was a subject that never had been touched upon or talked of in
the Bates family.  Money was their God, work their religion; Kate looked at her mother curiously.

"You mean you believe in after life?" she asked.

"Why, I suppose there must be SOMETHING," she said.

"I think so myself," said Kate.  "I always have.  I think there is a God, and that Father is
facing Him now, and finding out for the first time in his experience that he is very small
potatoes, and what he planned and slaved for amounted to nothing, in the scheme of the universe.
I can't imagine Father being subdued by anything on earth, but it appeals to me that he will
cut a pathetic figure before the throne of an Almighty God."

A slow grin twisted Mrs. Bates' lips.

"Well, wherever he went," she said, "I guess he found out pretty quick that he was some place
at last where he couldn't be boss."

"I'm very sure he has," said Kate, "and I am equally sure the discipline will be good for him.
But his sons!  His precious sons! What are they doing?"

"Taking it according to their bent," said Mrs. Bates.  "Adam is insane, Hiram is crying."

"Have you had a lawyer?" asked Kate.

"What for?  We all know the law on this subject better than we know our a, b, c's."

"Did your deed for this place go, too?" asked Kate.

"Yes," said Mrs. Bates, "but mine was recorded, none of the others were.  I get a third, and
the rest will be cut up and divided, share and share alike, among ALL OF YOU, equally.  I think
it's going to kill Adam and ruin Andrew."

"It won't do either.  But this is awful.  I can see how the boys feel, and really, Mother,
this is no more fair to them than things always have been for the girls.  By the way, what
are they doing?"

"Same as the boys, acting out their natures.  Mary is openly rejoicing. So is Nancy Ellen.
Hannah and Bertha at least can see the boys' side. The others say one thing before the boys
and another among themselves. In the end the girls will have their shares and nobody can blame
them. I don't myself, but I think Pa will rise from his grave when those farms are torn up."

"Don't worry," said Kate.  "He will have learned by now that graves are merely incidental,
and that he has no option on real estate where he is.  Leave him to his harp, and tell me what
you want done."

"I want you to see that it was all accidental.  I want you to take care of me.  I want you
should think out the FAIR thing for all of us to DO. I want you to keep sane and cool-headed
and shame the others into behaving themselves.  And I want you to smash down hard on their
everlasting, 'why didn't you do this?' and 'why didn't you do that?'  I reckon I've been told
five hundred times a-ready that I shouldn't a-give him the deeds.  Josie say it, an' then she
sings it.  NOT GIVE THEM TO HIM!  How could I help giving them to him?  He'd a-got up and got
them himself if I hadn't--"

"You have cut out something of a job for me," said Kate, "but I'll do my best.  Anyway, I can
take care of you.  Come on into the house now, and let me clean you up, and then I'll talk
the rest of them into reason, if you stand back of me, and let them see I'm acting for you."

"You go ahead," said Mrs. Bates.  "I'll back whatever you say. But keep them off of me!  Keep
them off of me!"

After Kate had bathed her mother, helped her into fresh clothes, and brushed her hair, she
coaxed her to lie down, and by diplomatic talk and stroking her head, finally soothed her to
sleep.  Then she went down and announced the fact, asked them all to be quiet, and began making
her way from group to group in an effort to restore mental balance and sanity.  After Kate
had invited all of them to go home and stay until time for the funeral Sunday morning, and
all of them had emphatically declined, and eagerly had gone on straining the situation to the
breaking point, Kate gave up and began setting the table.  When any of them tried to talk or
argue with her she said conclusively:  "I shall not say one word about this until Monday. 
Then we will talk things over, and find where we stand, and what Mother wants.  This would
be much easier for all of us, if you'd all go home and calm down, and plan out what you think
would be the fair and just thing to do."

Before evening Kate was back exactly where she left off, for when Mrs. Bates came downstairs,
her nerves quieted by her long sleep, she asked Kate what would be best about each question
that arose, while Kate answered as nearly for all of them as her judgment and common sense
dictated; but she gave the answer in her own way, and she paved the way by making a short,
sharp speech when the first person said in her hearing that "Mother never should have given
him the deeds."  Not one of them said that again, while at Kate's suggestion, mentally and
on scraps of paper, every single one of them figured that one third of sixteen hundred and
fifty was five hundred and fifty; subtracted from sixteen hundred and fifty this left one thousand
one hundred, which, divided by sixteen, gave sixty-eight and three fourths.  This result gave
Josie the hysterics, strong and capable though she was; made Hiram violently ill, so that he
resorted to garden palings for a support; while Agatha used her influence suddenly, and took
Adam, Jr., home.

As she came to Kate to say that they were going, Agatha was white as possible, her thin lips
compressed, a red spot burning on either cheek.

"Adam and I shall take our departure now, Katherine," she said, standing very stiffly, her
head held higher than Kate ever had thought it could be lifted.  Kate put her arm around her
sister-in-law and gave her a hearty hug:  "Tell Adam I'll do what I think is fair and just;
and use all the influence I have to get the others to do the same," she said.

"Fruitless!" said Agatha.  "Fruitless!  Reason and justice have departed from this abode. 
I shall hasten my pace, and take Adam where my influence is paramount.  The state of affairs
here is deplorable, perfectly deplorable!  I shall not be missed, and I shall leave my male
offspring to take the place of his poor, defrauded father."

Adam, 3d, was now a tall, handsome young man of twenty-two, quite as fond of Kate as ever.
He wiped the dishes, and when the evening work was finished, they talked with Mrs. Bates until
they knew her every wish.  The children had planned for a funeral from the church, because
it was large enough to seat the family and friends in comfort; but when they mentioned this
to Mrs. Bates, she delivered an ultimatum on the instant:  "You'll do no such thing!" she cried.
"Pa never went to that church living; I'll not sanction his being carried there feet first,
when he's helpless. P.T.W.

PROPHECY OF LORD BYRON.

In his journal, under the date of January 13, 1821, Lord Byron writes: "Dined--news come--the
powers mean to war with the people. The intelligence seems positive--let it be so--they will
be beaten in the end. I shall not live to see it--but I foresee it."

HARDHAM'S 37

Snuff-takers generally, especially the patrons of Hardham's 37 will read the following record
of benevolence with some gratification:--"In 1772, Mr. John Hardham,
a tobacconist, in London, a native of Chichester, left by his will
the interest of all his estates to the guardians of the poor, 'to
ease the inhabitants in their poor-rates for ever.' This valuable
legacy amounting to 653l. per annum was subject to the life of the
housekeeper of the testator, so that it was not till 1786 that it
reverted to the city."--This is even better than the plan for snuff-takers
paying off the national debt.

PRESTON, LANCASTER.

Preston is a market-town, borough, and parish; situated on the river
Ribble, in the hundred of Amounderness, county palatine of Lancaster.

It was incorporated by Henry II., in 1160; and the privileges and
free customs granted by this and subsequent royal grants were confirmed
by Charter of 36th Charles II.

The body corporate consists of a mayor, recorder, seven aldermen, and seventeen capital burgesses,
who, together, form the common council of the borough. The mayor, two town-bailiffs, and two
sergeants are elected annually, upon the Friday preceding the festival
of St. Wilfrid, who was formerly lord of this town; and they are invested,
on the 12th of October following, by a jury of twenty-four guild burgesses.

The members of the council, with the exception of the mayor, retain their seats for life, or
during the pleasure of a majority, and vacancies are supplied by
the remaining members.

The town sends two representatives to parliament, and affords the
nearest practical example of universal suffrage in the kingdom--every
male inhabitant, whether housekeeper or lodger, who has resided six
months in the town, and who has not, during the last twelve months,
been chargeable to any township as a pauper, having a right to vote
for two candidates at elections.

This principle was established by a decision of the House of Commons, on an appeal, in the year
1766, and has ever since been acted upon. The burgesses are entitled, by the charter of Henry
II., to have a GUILD MERCHANT, with the usual franchises annexed, of safe transit through the
kingdom, exemption from toll, pontage, and stallage; liberty to buy and sell peaceably; and
power to hold a guild for the renewal of freedom to the burgesses, the confirming of by-laws, and
other purposes. This privilege is still made the occasion of great festivity. For a long time
after their first institution, the guilds were held at irregular periods, but they have now,
for more than a century, been uniformly celebrated every twentieth
year, commencing on the Monday next after the Decollation of St. John,
which generally happens in the last week of August; the last was held
in 1822, and commenced on the 22nd of September.

The amusements, which are of great variety, continue for a fortnight; but, for civic purposes,
the guild books are open for one entire month. The corporation are obliged to hold this carnival,
on pain of forfeiting their elective franchises, and their rights as burgesses.
  If you
thought it was right and a fair thing to do."

"Yes, I'll tell you that," said Mrs. Bates.  "It was not fair, and I saw it; I saw it good
and plenty.  There was no use to fight him; that would only a-drove him to record them, but
I was sick of it, an' I told him so."

Kate was pinning her hat.

"I have planned for you to walk with Adam," she said.

"Well, you can just change THAT plan, so far as I am concerned," said Mrs. Bates with finality.
"I ain't a-goin' with Adam. Somebody had told him about the deeds before he got here.  He came
in ravin', and he talked to me something terrible.  He was the first to say I shouldn't a-give
Pa the box.  NOT GIVE IT TO HIM! An' he went farther than that, till I just rose up an' called
him down proper; but I ain't feelin' good at him, an' I ain't goin' with him.  I am goin' with
you.  I want somebody with me that understands me, and feels a little for me, an' I want the
neighbours to see that the minute I'm boss, such a fine girl as you has her rightful place
in her home.  I'll go with you, or I'll sit down on this chair, and sit here."

"But you didn't send for me," said Kate.

"No, I hadn't quite got round to it yet; but I was coming.  I'd told all of them that you were
the only one in the lot who had any sense; and I'd said I WISHED you were here, and as I see
it, I'd a-sent for you yesterday afternoon about three o'clock.  I was coming to it fast. I
didn't feel just like standing up for myself; but I'd took about all fault-finding it was in
me to bear. Just about three o'clock I'd a-sent for you, Katie, sure as God made little apples."

"All right then," said Kate, "but if you don't tell them, they'll always say I took the lead."

"Well, they got to say something," said Mrs. Bates.  "Most of 'em would die if they had to
keep their mouths shut awhile; but I'll tell them fast enough."

Then she led the way downstairs.  There were enough members of the immediate family to pack
the front rooms of the house, the neighbours filled the dining room and dooryard.  The church
choir sang a hymn in front of the house, the minister stood on the front steps and read a chapter,
and told where Mr. Bates had been born, married, the size of his family and possessions, said
he was a good father, an honest neighbour, and very sensibly left his future with his God.
Then the choir sang again and all started to their conveyances.  As the breaking up began outside,
Mrs. Bates arose and stepped to the foot of the casket.  She steadied herself by it and said:
"Some time back, I promised Pa that if he went before I did, at this time in his funeral ceremony
I would set his black tin box on the foot of his coffin and unlock before all of you, and in
the order in which they lay, beginning with Adam, Jr., hand each of you boys the deed Pa had
made you for the land you live on.  You all know WHAT happened.  None of you know just HOW.
It wouldn't bring the deeds BACK if you did.  They're gone.  But I want you boys to follow
your father to his grave with nothing in your hearts against HIM.  He was all for the men.
I don't ever want to hear any of you criticize him about this, or me, either. He did his best
to make you upstanding men in your community, his one failing being that he liked being an
upstanding man himself so well that he carried it too far; but his intentions was the best.
As for me, I'd no idea how sick he was, and nobody else did.  I minded him just like all the
rest of you always did; the BOYS especially.  From the church I want all of you to go home
until to-morrow morning, and then I want my sons and daughters by BIRTH only, to come here,
and we'll talk things over, quietly, QUIETLY, mind you; and decide what to do.  Katie, will
you come with me?"

It was not quite a tearless funeral.  Some of the daughters-in-law wept from nervous excitement;
and some of the little children cried with fear, but there were no tears from the wife of Adam
Bates, or his sons and daughters.  And when he was left to the mercies of time, all of them
followed Mrs. Bates' orders, except Nancy Ellen and Robert, who stopped to help Kate with the
dinner. Kate slipped into her second dress and went to work.  Mrs. Bates untied her bonnet
strings and unfastened her dress neck as they started home.  She unbuttoned her waist going
up the back walk and pulled it off at the door.

"Well, if I ever put that thing on in July again," she said, "you can use my head for a knock-maul.
Nancy Ellen, can't you stop at a store as you come out in the morning and get the goods, and
you girls run me up a dress that is nice enough to go out in, and not so hot it starts me burning
before my time?"

"Of course I can," said Nancy Ellen.  "About what do you want to pay, Mother?"

"Whatever it takes to get a decent and a cool dress; cool, mind you," said Mrs. Bates, "an'
any colour but black."

"Why, Mother!" cried Nancy Ellen "it must be black!"

"No," said Mrs. Bates.  "Pa kept me in black all my life on the supposition it showed the dirt
the least.  There's nothing in that.  It shows dirt worse 'an white.  I got my fill of black.
You can get a nice cool gray, if you want me to wear it."

"Well, I never!" said Nancy Ellen.  "What will the neighbours say?"

"What do I care?" asked Mrs. Bates.  "They've talked about me all my life, I'd be kinda lonesome
if they's to quit."

Dinner over, Kate proposed that her mother should lie down while they washed the dishes.

"I would like a little rest," said Mrs. Bates.  "I guess I'll go upstairs."

"You'll do nothing of the kind," said Kate.  "It's dreadfully hot up there.  Go in the spare
room, where it is cool; we'll keep quiet.  I am going to stay Tuesday until I move you in there,
anyway.  It's smaller, but it's big enough for one, and you'll feel much better there."

"Oh, Katie, I'm so glad you thought of that," cried Mrs. Bates. "I been thinking and thinking
about it, and it just seems as if I can't ever steel myself to go into that room to sleep again.
I'll never enter that door that I don't see--"

"You'll never enter it again as your room," said Kate.  "I'll fix you up before I go; and Sally
Whistler told me last evening she would come and make her home with you if you wanted her.
You like Sally, don't you?"

"Yes, I like her fine," said Mrs. Bates.

Quietly as possible the girls washed the dishes, pulled down the blinds, closed the front door,
and slipped down in the orchard with Robert to talk things over.  Nancy Ellen was stiffly reserved
with Kate, but she WOULD speak when she was spoken to, which was so much better than silence
that Kate was happy over it.  Robert was himself. Kate thought she had never liked him so well.
He seemed to grow even kinder and more considerate as the years passed.  Nancy Ellen was prettier
than Kate ever had seen her, but there was a line of discontent around her mouth, and she spoke
pettishly on slight provocation, or none at all.  Now she was openly, brazenly, brutally, frank
in her rejoicing.  She thought it was the best "JOKE" that ever happened to the boys; and she
said so repeatedly.  Kate found her lips closing more tightly and a slight feeling of revulsion
growing in her heart.  Surely in Nancy Ellen's lovely home, cared for and shielded in every
way, she had no such need of money as Kate had herself.  She was delighted when Nancy Ellen
said she was sleepy, and was going to the living-room lounge for a nap.  Then Kate produced
her sheet of figures. She and Robert talked the situation over and carefully figured on how
an adjustment, fair to all, could be made, until they were called to supper.

After supper Nancy Ellen and Robert went home, while Kate and her mother sat on the back porch
and talked until Kate had a clear understanding and a definite plan in her mind, which was
that much improvement over wearing herself out in bitter revilings, or selfish rejoicing over
her brothers' misfortune.  Her mother listened to all she had to say, asked a question occasionally,
objected to some things, and suggested others.  They arose when they had covered every contingency
they could think of and went upstairs to bed, even though the downstairs was cooler.

As she undressed, Mrs. Bates said slowly:  "Now in the morning, I'll speak my piece first;
and I'll say it pretty plain.  I got the whip-hand here for once in my life.  They can't rave
and fight here, and insult me again, as they did Friday night and Saturday till you got here
an' shut 'em up.  I won't stand it, that's flat! I'll tell 'em so, and that you speak for me,
because you can figure faster and express yourself plainer; but insist that there be no fussing,
an' I'll back you.  I don't know just what life has been doing to you, Katie, but Lord! it
has made a fine woman of you."

Kate set her lips in an even line and said nothing, but her heart was the gladdest it had been
in years.

Her mother continued:  "Seems like Nancy Ellen had all the chance. Most folks thought she was
a lot the purtiest to start with, though I can't say that I ever saw so much difference.  She's
had leisure an' pettin', and her husband has made a mint o' money; she's gone all over the
country with him, and the more chance she has, the narrower she grows, and the more discontenteder.
One thing, she is awful disappointed about havin' no children.  I pity her about that."

"Is it because she's a twin?" asked Kate.

"I'm afraid so," said Mrs. Bates.  "You can't tell much about those things, they just seem
to happen.  Robert and Nancy Ellen feel awful bad about it.  Still, she might do for others
what she would for her own.  The Lord knows there are enough mighty nice children in the world
who need mothering.  I want to see your children, Katie.  Are they nice little folks, straight
and good looking?"

"The boy is," said Kate.  "The girl is good, with the exception of being the most stubborn
child I've ever seen.  She looks so much like a woman it almost sickens me to think of that
I have to drive myself to do her justice."

"What a pity!" said Mrs. Bates, slowly.

"Oh, they are healthy, happy youngsters," said Kate.  "They get as much as we ever did, and
don't expect any more.  I have yet to see a demonstrative Bates."

"Humph!" said Mrs. Bates.  "Well, you ought to been here Friday night, and I thought Adam came
precious near it Saturday."

"Demonstrating power, or anger, yes," said Kate.  "I meant affection. And isn't it the queerest
thing how people are made? Of all the boys, Adam is the one who has had the most softening
influences, and who has made the most money, and yet he's acting the worst of all.  It really
seems as if failure and hardship make more of a human being of folks than success."

"You're right," said Mrs. Bates.  "Look at Nancy Ellen and Adam. Sometimes I think Adam has
been pretty much galled with Agatha and her money all these years; and it just drives him crazy
to think of having still less than she has.  Have you got your figures all set down, to back
you up, Katie?"

"Yes," said Kate.  "I've gone all over it with Robert, and he thinks it's the best and only
thing that can be done.  Now go to sleep."

Each knew that the other was awake most of the night, but very few words passed between them.
They were up early, dressed, and waiting when the first carriage stopped at the gate.  Kate
told her mother to stay where she would not be worried until she was needed, and went down
herself to meet her brothers and sisters in the big living room.  When the last one arrived,
she called her mother.  Mrs. Bates came down looking hollow-eyed, haggard, and grim, as none
of her children ever before had seen her.  She walked directly to the little table at the end
of the room, and while still standing she said:  "Now I've got a few words to say, and then
I'll turn this over to a younger head an' one better at figures than mine.  I've said my say
as to Pa, yesterday. Now I'll say THIS, for myself.  I got my start, minding Pa, and agreeing
with him, young; but you needn't any of you throw it in my teeth now, that I did.  There is
only ONE woman among you, and no MAN who ever disobeyed him.  Katie stood up to him once, and
got seven years from home to punish her and me.  He wasn't RIGHT then, and I knew it, as I'd
often known it before, and pretty often since; but no woman God ever made could have lived
with Adam Bates as his wife and contraried him.  I didn't mind him any quicker or any oftener
than the rest of you; keep that pretty clear in your heads, and don't one of you dare open
your mouth again to tell me, as you did Saturday, what I SHOULD a-done, and what I SHOULDN'T.
I've had the law of this explained to me; you all know it for that matter.  By the law, I get
this place and one third of all the other land and money.  I don't know just what money there
is at the bank or in notes and mortgages, but a sixteenth of it after my third is taken out
ain't going to make or break any of you.  I've told Katie what I'm willing to do on my part
and she will explain it, and then tell you about a plan she has fixed up.  As for me, you can
take it or leave it.  If you take it, well and good; if you don't, the law will be set in motion
to-day, and it will take its course to the end.  It all depends on YOU.

"Now two things more.  At the start, what Pa wanted to do seemed to me right, and I agreed
with him and worked with him.  But when my girls began to grow up and I saw how they felt,
and how they struggled and worked, and how the women you boys married went ahead of my own
girls, and had finer homes, an' carriages, and easier times, I got pretty sick of it, and I
told Pa so more'n once.  He just raved whenever I did, an' he always carried his keys in his
pocket.  I never touched his chest key in my life, till I handed him his deed box Friday afternoon.
But I agree with my girls.  It's fair and right, since things have come out as they have, that
they should have their shares.  I would, too.

"The other thing is just this:  I'm tired to death of the whole business.  I want peace and
rest and I want it quick.  Friday and Saturday I was so scared and so knocked out I s'pose
I'd 'a' took it if one of the sucking babies had riz up and commenced to tell me what I should
a-done, and what I shouldn't.  I'm THROUGH with that.  You will all keep civil tongues in your
heads this morning, or I'll get up and go upstairs, an' lock myself in a room till you're gone,
an' if I go, it will mean that the law takes its course; and if it does, there will be three
hundred acres less land to divide.  You've had Pa on your hands all your lives, now you will
go civil, and you will go easy, or you will get a taste of Ma.  I take no more talk from anybody.
Katie, go ahead with your figures."

Kate spread her sheet on the table and glanced around the room:

"The Milton County records show sixteen hundred and fifty acres standing in Father's name,"
she said.  "Of these, Mother is heir to five hundred and fifty acres, leaving one thousand
one hundred acres to be divided among sixteen of us, which give sixty-eight and three-fourths
acres to each.  This land is the finest that proper fertilization and careful handling can
make.  Even the poorest is the cream of the country as compared with the surrounding farms.
As a basis of estimate I have taken one hundred dollars an acre as a fair selling figure. 
Some is worth more, some less, but that is a good average.  This would make the share of each
of us in cash that could easily be realized, six thousand eight hundred and seventy-five dollars.
Whatever else is in mortgages, notes, and money can be collected as it is due, deposited in
some bank, and when it is all in, divided equally among us, after deducting Mother's third.
Now this is the law, and those are the figures, but I shall venture to say that none of us
feel RIGHT about it, or ever will."

An emphatic murmur of approval ran among the boys, Mary and Nancy Ellen stoutly declared that
they did.

"Oh, no, you don't!" said Kate.  "If God made any woman of you so that she feels right and
clean in her conscience about this deal, he made her WRONG, and that is a thing that has not
yet been proven of God.  As I see it, here is the boys' side:  from childhood they were told,
bribed, and urged to miss holidays, work all week, and often on Sunday, to push and slave on
the promise of this land at twenty-one.  They all got the land and money to stock it and build
homes.  They were told it was theirs, required to pay the taxes on it, and also to labour at
any time and without wages for Father.  Not one of the boys but has done several hundred dollars'
worth of work on Father's farm for nothing, to keep him satisfied and to insure getting his
deed.  All these years, each man has paid his taxes, put thousands in improvements, in rebuilding
homes and barns, fertilizing, and developing his land. Each one of these farms is worth nearly
twice what it was the day it was received.  That the boys should lose all this is no cause
for rejoicing on the part of any true woman; as a fact, no true woman would allow such a thing
to happen--"

"Speak for yourself!" cried several of the girls at once.

"Now right here is where we come to a perfect understanding," said Kate.  "I did say that for
myself, but in the main what I say, I say for MOTHER.  Now you will not one of you interrupt
me again, or this meeting closes, and each of you stands to lose more than two thousand dollars,
which is worth being civil for, for quite a while.  No more of that!  I say any woman should
be ashamed to take advantage of her brother through an accident; and rob him of years of work
and money he was perfectly justified in thinking was his.  I, for one, refuse to do it, and
I want and need money probably more than any of you.  To tear up these farms, to take more
than half from the boys, is too much.  On the other hand, for the girls to help earn the land,
to go with no inheritance at all, is even more unfair.  Now in order to arrive at a compromise
that will leave each boy his farm, and give each girl the nearest possible to a fair amount,
figuring in what the boys have spent in taxes and work for Father, and what each girl has LOST
by not having her money to handle all these years, it is necessary to split the difference
between the time Adam, the eldest, has had his inheritance, and Hiram, the youngest, came into
possession, which by taking from and adding to, gives a fair average of fifteen years.  Now
Mother proposes if we will enter into an agreement this morning with no words and no wrangling,
to settle on this basis:  she will relinquish her third of all other land, and keep only this
home farm.  She even will allow the fifty lying across the road to be sold and the money put
into a general fund for the share of the girls.  She will turn into this fund all money from
notes and mortgages, and the sale of all stock, implements, etc., here, except what she wants
to keep for her use, and the sum of three thousand dollars in cash, to provide against old
age.  This releases quite a sum of money, and three hundred and fifty acres of land, which
she gives to the boys to start this fund as her recompense for their work and loss through
a scheme in which she had a share in the start.  She does this only on the understanding that
the boys form a pool, and in some way take from what they have saved, sell timber or cattle,
or borrow enough money to add to this sufficient to pay to each girl six thousand dollars in
cash, in three months.  Now get out your pencils and figure.  Start with the original number
of acres at fifty dollars an acre which is what it cost Father on an average.  Balance against
each other what the boys have lost in tax and work, and the girls have lost in not having their
money to handle, and cross it off. Then figure, not on a basis of what the boys have made this
land worth, but on what it cost Father's estate to buy, build on, and stock each farm.  Strike
the fifteen-year average on prices and profits.  Figure that the girls get all their money
practically immediately, to pay for the time they have been out of it; while each boy assumes
an equal share of the indebtedness required to finish out the six thousand, after Mother has
turned in what she is willing to, if this is settled HERE AND NOW."

"Then I understand," said Mary, "that if we take under the law, each of us is entitled to sixty-eight
and three quarter acres; and if we take under Mother's proposition we are entitled to eighty-seven
and a half acres."

"No, no, E. A.," said Kate, the old nickname for "Exceptional Ability" slipping out before
she thought.  "No, no!  Not so!  You take sixty-eight and three quarters under the law.  Mother's
proposition is made ONLY to the boys, and only on condition that they settle here and now;
because she feels responsible to them for her share in rearing them and starting them out as
she did. By accepting her proposition you lose eight hundred and seventy-five dollars, approximately.
The boys lose on the same basis, figuring at fifty dollars and acre, six thousand five hundred
and sixty-two dollars and fifty cents, plus their work and taxes, and minus what Mother will
turn in, which will be about, let me see--It will take a pool of fifty-four thousand dollars
to pay each of us six thousand.  If Mother raises thirty-five thousand, plus sale money and
notes, it will leave about nineteen thousand for the boys, which will divide up at nearly two
thousand five hundred for them to lose, as against less than a thousand for us.  That should
be enough to square matters with any right-minded woman, even in our positions.  It will give
us that much cash in hand, it will leave the boys, some of the younger ones, in debt for years,
if they hold their land.  What more do you want?"

"I want the last cent that is coming to me," said Mary.

"I thought you would," said Kate.  "Yet you have the best home, and the most money, of any
of the girls living on farms.  I settle under this proposition, because it is fair and just,
and what Mother wants done. If she feels that this is defrauding the girls any, she can arrange
to leave what she has to us at her death, which would more than square matters in our favour--"

"You hold on there, Katie," said Mrs. Bates.  "You're going too fast! I'll get what's coming
to me, and hang on to it awhile, before I decide which way the cat jumps.  I reckon you'll
all admit that in mothering the sixteen of you, doing my share indoors and out, and living
with PA for all these years, I've earned it. I'll not tie myself up in any way. I'll do just
what I please with mine.  Figure in all I've told you to; for the rest--let be!"

"I beg your pardon," said Kate.  "You're right, of course.  I'll sign this, and I shall expect
every sister I have to do the same, quickly and cheerfully, as the best way out of a bad business
that has hurt all of us for years, and then I shall expect the boys to follow like men. It's
the fairest, decentest thing we can do, let's get it over."

Kate picked up the pen, handed it to her mother, signed afterward herself, and then carried
it to each of her sisters, leaving Nancy Ellen and Mary until last.  All of them signed up
to Nancy Ellen. She hesitated, and she whispered to Kate:  "Did Robert--?"  Kate nodded. Nancy
Ellen thought deeply a minute and then said slowly: "I guess it is the quickest and best we
can do."  So she signed. Mary hesitated longer, but finally added her name.  Kate passed on
to the boys, beginning with Adam.  Slowly he wrote his name, and as he handed back the paper
he said:  "Thank you, Kate, I believe it's the sanest thing we can do.  I can make it easier
than the younger boys."

"Then HELP them," said Kate tersely, passing on.

Each boy signed in turn, all of them pleased with the chance.  It was so much better than they
had hoped, that it was a great relief, which most of them admitted; so they followed Adam's
example in thanking Kate, for all of them knew that in her brain had originated the scheme,
which seemed to make the best of their troubles.

Then they sat closer and talked things over calmly and dispassionately. It was agreed that
Adam and his mother should drive to Hartley the following afternoon and arrange for him to
take out papers of administration for her, and start the adjustment of affairs.  They all went
home thinking more of each other, and Kate especially, than ever before.  Mrs. Bates got dinner
while Kate and Nancy Ellen went to work on the cool gray dress, so that it would be ready for
the next afternoon.  While her mother was away Kate cleaned the spare bedroom and moved her
mother's possessions into it.  She made it as convenient and comfortable and as pretty as she
could, but the house was bare to austerity, so that her attempt at prettifying was rather a
failure. Then she opened the closed room and cleaned it, after studying it most carefully as
it stood.  The longer she worked, the stronger became a conviction that was slowly working
its way into her brain.  When she could do no more she packed her telescope, installed Sally
Whistler in her father's room, and rode to Hartley with a neighbour.  From there she took the
Wednesday hack for Walden.

CHAPTER XVIII

KATE TAKES THE BIT IN HER TEETH

THE hackman was obliging, for after delivering the mail and some parcels, he took Kate to her
home.  While she waited for him, she walked the ravine bank planning about the mill which was
now so sure that she might almost begin work.  Surely she might as soon as she finished figuring,
for she had visited the Court House in Hartley and found that George's deeds were legal, and
in proper shape.  Her mind was filled with plans which this time must succeed.

As she approached the house she could see the children playing in the yard.  It was the first
time she ever had been away from them; she wondered if they had missed her.  She was amazed
to find that they were very decidedly disappointed to see her; but a few pertinent questions
developed the reason.  Their grandmother had come with her sister; she had spent her time teaching
them that their mother was cold, and hard, and abused them, by not treating them as other children
were treated. So far as Kate could see they had broken every rule she had ever laid down for
them:  eaten until their stomachs were out of order, and played in their better clothing, until
it never would be nice again, while Polly shouted at her approach:  "Give ME the oranges and
candy. I want to divide them."

"Silly," said Kate.  "This is too soon.  I've no money yet, it will be a long time before I
get any; but you shall each have an orange, some candy, and new clothing when I do.  Now run
see what big fish you can catch."

Satisfied, the children obeyed and ran to the creek.  Aunt Ollie, worried and angered, told
Adam to tell his father that Mother was home and for him to come and take her and grandmother
to Walden at once. She had not been able to keep Mrs. Holt from one steady round of mischief;
but she argued that her sister could do less, with her on guard, than alone, so she had stayed
and done her best; but she knew how Kate would be annoyed, so she believed the best course
was to leave as quickly as possible.  Kate walked into the house, spoke to both women, and
went to her room to change her clothing.  Before she had finished, she heard George's voice
in the house demanding:  "Where's our millionaire lady?  I want a look at her."

Kate was very tired, slowly relaxing from intense nerve strain, she was holding herself in
check about the children.  She took a tighter grip, and vowed she would not give Mrs. Holt
the satisfaction of seeing her disturbed and provoked, if she killed herself in the effort
at self-control.  She stepped toward the door.

"Here," she called in a clear voice, the tone of which brought George swiftly.

"What was he worth, anyway?" he shouted.

"Oh, millions and millions," said Kate, sweetly, "at least I THINK so. It was scarcely a time
to discuss finances, in the face of that horrible accident."

George laughed.  "Oh, you're a good one!" he cried.  "Think you can keep a thing like that
still?  The cats, and the dogs, and the chickens of the whole county know about the deeds the
old Land King had made for his sons; and how he got left on it.  Served him right, too!  We
could here Andrew swear, and see Adam beat his horse, clear over here! That's right!  Go ahead!
Put on airs! Tell us something we don't KNOW, will you?  Maybe you think I wasn't hanging pretty
close around that neighbourhood, myself!"

"Spying?" cried Kate.

"Looking for timber," he sneered.  "And never in all my life have I seen anything to beat it.
Sixteen hundred and fifty acres of the best land in the world.  Your share of land and money
together will be every cent of twelve thousand.  Oh, I guess I know what you've got up your
sleeve, my lady.  Come on, shell out!  Let's all go celebrate.  What did you bring the children?"

Kate was rapidly losing patience in spite of her resolves.

"Myself," she said.  "From their appearance and actions, goodness knows they needed me.  I
have been to my father's funeral, George; not to a circus."

"Humph!" said George.  "And home for the first time in seven years. You needn't tell me it
wasn't the biggest picnic you ever had! We are trying at present to stave off the coming crisis,
the coming revolution as my friends the Fabianists call it, by means
of doles and alms.

Well, when the revolution or crisis arrives, we shall be powerless,
because we shall know nothing.

And so, Ernest, let us not be deceived. England will never be civilised till she has added Utopia
to her dominions. There is more than one of her colonies that she might with advantage surrender
for so fair a land. What we want are unpractical people who see beyond the moment, and think
beyond the day. Those who try to lead the people can only do so by following the mob. It is
through the voice of one crying in the wilderness that the ways of the gods must be prepared.

But perhaps you think that in beholding for the mere joy of beholding, and contemplating for
the sake of contemplation, there is something that is egotistic. If you think so, do not say
so.

It takes a thoroughly selfish age, like our own, to deify self- sacrifice. It takes a thoroughly
grasping age, such as that in which we live, to set above the fine
intellectual virtues, those shallow and emotional virtues that are
an immediate practical benefit to itself.

They miss their aim, too, these philanthropists and sentimentalists
of our day, who are always chattering to one about one's duty to one's
neighbour.

For the development of the race depends on the development of the individual, and where self-
culture has ceased to be the ideal, the intellectual standard is instantly lowered, and, often,
ultimately lost. If you meet at dinner a man who has spent his life in educating himself--a
rare type in our time, I admit, but still one occasionally to be met with--you rise from table
richer, and conscious that a high ideal has for a moment touched and sanctified your days. But
oh! my dear Ernest, to sit next to a man who has spent his life in trying to educate others!
What a dreadful experience that is! How appalling is that ignorance which is the inevitable
result of the fatal habit of imparting opinions! How limited in range the creature's mind
proves to be! How it wearies us, and must weary himself, with its endless repetitions and sickly
reiteration! How lacking it is in any element of intellectual growth!


Kate thought intently a second.  Instead of beginning with leaving Friday morning:  "I was
at the Court House in Hartley this morning," she said.

"You needn't have done that," he scoffed.  "I spent most of the day there Monday.  You bet
folks shelled out the books when I told them who I was, and what I was after.  I must say you
folks have some little reason to be high and mighty.  You sure have got the dough.  No wonder
the old man hung on to his deeds himself.  He wasn't so FAR from a King, all right, all right."

"You mean you left your work Monday, and went to the Court House in Hartley and told who you
were, and spent the day nosing into my father's affairs, before his SONS had done anything,
or you had any idea WHAT was to be done?" she demanded.

"Oh, you needn't get so high and mighty," he said.  "I propose to know just where I am, about
this.  I propose to have just what is coming to me--to you, to the last penny, and no Bates
man will manage the affair, either."

Suddenly Kate leaned forward.

"I foresee that you've fixed yourself up for a big disappointment," she said.  "My mother and
her eldest son will settle my father's estate; and when it is settled I shall have exactly
what the other girls have. Then if I still think it is wise, I shall at once go to work building
the mill.  Everything must be shaved to the last cent, must be done with the closest economy,
I MUST come out of this with enough left to provide us a comfortable home."

"Do that from the first profits of the mill," he suggested.

"I'm no good at 'counting chickens before they're hatched,'" said Kate. "Besides, the first
profits from the mill, as you very well know, if you would ever stop to think, must go to pay
for logs to work on, and there must always be a good balance for that purpose. No.  I reserve
enough from my money to fix the home I want; but I shall wait to do it until the mill is working,
so I can give all my attention to it, while you are out looking up timber."

"Of course I can do all of it perfectly well," he said.  "And it's a MAN'S business.  You'll
make me look like fifty cents if you get out among men and go to doing a thing no woman in
this part of the country ever did.  Why, it will look like you didn't TRUST me!"

"I can't help how it will look," said Kate.  "This is my last and only dollar; if I lose it,
I am out for life; I shall take no risk.  I've no confidence in your business ability, and
you know it.  It need not hurt your pride a particle to say that we are partners; that I'm
going to build the mill, while you're going to bring in the timber.  It's the only way I shall
touch the proposition.  I will give you two hundred dollars for the deed and abstract of the
ravine.  I'll give your mother eight hundred for the lot and house, which is two hundred more
than it is worth. I'll lay away enough to rebuild and refurnish it, and with the remainder
I'll build the dam, bridge, and mill, just as quickly as it can be done.  As soon as I get
my money, we'll buy timber for the mill and get it sawed and dried this winter.  We can be
all done and running by next June."

"Kate, how are you going to get all that land sold, and the money in hand to divide up that
quickly?  I don't think it ever can be done. Land is always sold on time, you know," he said.

Kate drew a deep breath.  "THIS land isn't going to be sold," she said. "Most of the boys have
owned their farms long enough to have enabled them to buy other land, and put money in the
bank. They're going to form a pool, and put in enough money to pay the girls the share they
have agreed to take; even if they have to borrow it, as some of the younger ones will; but
the older ones will help them; so the girls are to have their money in cash, in three months.
I was mighty glad of the arrangement for my part, because we can begin at once on our plans
for the mill."

"And how much do the girls get?" he asked darkly.

"Can't say just yet," said Kate.  "The notes and mortgages have to be gone over, and the thing
figured out; it will take some time. Mother and Adam began yesterday; we shall know in a few
weeks."

"Sounds to me like a cold-blooded Bates steal," he cried.  "Who figured out what WAS a fair
share for the girls; who planned that arrangement? Why didn't you insist on the thing going
through court; the land belong sold, and equal divisions of all the proceeds?"

"Now if you'll agree not to say a word until I finish, I'll show you the figures," said Kate.
"I'll tell you what the plan is, and why it was made, and I'll tell you further that it is
already recorded, and in action.  There are no minor heirs.  We could make an agreement and
record it.  There was no will.  Mother will administer.  It's all settled.  Wait until I get
the figures."

Then slowly and clearly she went over the situation, explaining everything in detail.  When
she finished he sat staring at her with a snarling face.

"You signed that?" he demanded.  "You signed that!  YOU THREW AWAY AT LEAST HALF YOU MIGHT
HAVE HAD!  You let those lazy scoundrels of brothers of yours hoodwink you, and pull the wool
over your eyes like that?  Are you mad?  Are you stark, staring mad?"

"No, I'm quite sane," said Kate.  "It is you who are mad.  You know my figures, don't you?
Those were the only ones used yesterday.  The whole scheme was mine, with help from Mother
to the extent of her giving up everything except the home farm."

"You crazy fool!" he cried, springing up.

"Now stop," said Kate.  "Stop right there!  I've done what I think is right, and fair, and
just, and I'm happy with the results.  Act decently, I'll stay and build the mill.  Say one,
only one more of the nasty, insulting things in your head, and I'll go in there and wake up
the children and we will leave now and on foot."

Confronted with Kate and her ultimatum, George arose and walked down to the road; he began
pacing back and forth in the moonlight, struggling to regain command of himself.  He had no
money.  He had no prospect of any until Aunt Ollie died and left him her farm. He was, as he
expressed it, "up against it" there.  Now he was "up against it" with Kate.  What she decided
upon and proposed to do was all he could do. She might shave prices, and cut, and skimp, and
haggle to buy material, and put up her building at the least possible expense.  She might sit
over books and figure herself blind.  He would be driving over the country, visiting with the
farmers, booming himself for a fat county office maybe, eating big dinners, and being a jolly
good fellow generally. By carefully chronicling the current events of contemporary life, it shows
us of what very little importance such events really are. By invariably discussing the unnecessary
it makes us understand what things are requisite for culture, and what are not. But it should
not allow poor Tartuffe to write articles upon modern art.

When it does this it stultifies itself. And yet Tartuffe's articles and Chadband's notes do
this good, at least. They serve to show how extremely limited is the area over which ethics,
and ethical considerations, can claim to exercise influence. Science is out of the reach of
morals, for her eyes are fixed upon eternal truths. Art is out of the reach of morals, for
her eyes are fixed upon things beautiful and immortal and ever-changing.
  George stopped
in the moonlight to slap his leg and laugh over the happy thought.  "By George, Georgie, my
boy," he said, "most days will be cold, won't they?"

He had no word to say to Kate of his change of feeling in the matter. He did not want to miss
the chance of twitting her at every opportunity he could invent with having thrown away half
her inheritance; but he was glad the whole thing was settled so quickly and easily.  He was
now busy planning how he would spend the money Kate agreed to pay him for the ravine; but that
was another rosy cloud she soon changed in colour, for she told him if he was going to be a
partner he could put in what money he had, as his time was no more valuable than she could
make hers teaching school again--in other words, he could buy his horse and buggy with the
price she paid for the location, so he was forced to agree. He was forced to do a great many
things in the following months that he hated; but he had to do them or be left out of the proposition
altogether.

Mrs. Bates and Adam administered the Bates estate promptly and efficiently.  The girls had
their money on time, the boys adjusted themselves as their circumstances admitted.  Mrs. Bates
had to make so many trips to town, before the last paper was signed, and the last transfer
was made, that she felt she could not go any farther, so she did not.  Nancy Ellen had reached
the point where she would stop and talk a few minutes to Kate, if she met her on the streets
of Hartley, as she frequently did now; but she would not ask her to come home with her, because
she would not bring herself in contact with George Holt. The day Kate went to Hartley to receive
and deposit her check, and start her bank account, her mother asked her if she had any plan
as to what she would do with her money.  Kate told her in detail.  Mrs. Bates listened with
grim face:  "You better leave it in the bank," she said, "and use the interest to help you
live, or put it in good farm mortgages, where you can easily get ten per cent."

Kate explained again and told how she was doing all the buying, how she would pay all bills,
and keep the books.  It was no use. Mrs. Bates sternly insisted that she should do no such
thing.  In some way she would be defrauded.  In some way she would lose the money.  What she
was proposing was a man's work.  Kate had most of her contracts signed and much material ordered,
she could not stop.  Sadly she saw her mother turn from her, declaring as she went that Kate
would lose every cent she had, and when she did she need not come hanging around her. She had
been warned.  If she lost, she could take the consequences. For an instant Kate felt that she
could not endure it then she sprang after her mother.

"Oh, but I won't lose!" she cried.  "I'm keeping my money in my own hands.  I'm spending it
myself.  Please, Mother, come and see the location, and let me show you everything."

"Too late now," said Mrs. Bates grimly, "the thing is done.  The time to have told me was before
you made any contracts.  You're always taking the bit in your teeth and going ahead.  Well,
go! But remember, 'as you make your bed, so you can lie.'"

"All right," said Kate, trying to force a laugh.  "Don't you worry. Next time you get into
a tight place and want to borrow a few hundreds, come to me."

Mrs. Bates laughed derisively.  Kate turned away with a faint sickness in her heart and when
half an hour later she met Nancy Ellen, fresh from an interview with her mother, she felt no
better--far worse, in fact--for Nancy Ellen certainly could say what was in her mind with free
and forceful directness.  With deft tongue and nimble brain, she embroidered all Mrs. Bates
had said, and prophesied more evil luck in three minutes than her mother could have thought
of in a year.  Kate left them with no promise of seeing either of them again, except by accident,
her heart and brain filled with misgivings.  "Must I always have 'a fly in my ointment'?" she
wailed to herself.  "I thought this morning this would be the happiest day of my life.  I felt
as if I were flying. Ye Gods, but wings were never meant for me.  Every time I take them, down
I come kerflop, mostly in a 'gulf of dark despair,' as the hymn book says.  Anyway, I'll keep
my promise and give the youngsters a treat."

So she bought each of them an orange, some candy, and goods for a new Sunday outfit and comfortable
school clothing.  Then she took the hack for Walden, feeling in a degree as she had the day
she married George Holt.  As she passed the ravine and again studied the location her spirits
arose.  It WAS a good scheme.  It would work.  She would work it.  She would sell from the
yards to Walden and the surrounding country.  She would see the dealers in Hartley and talk
the business over, so she would know she was not being cheated in freight rates when she came
to shipping.  She stopped at Mrs. Holt's, laid a deed before her for her signature, and offered
her a check for eight hundred for the Holt house and lot, which Mrs. Holt eagerly accepted.
They arranged to move immediately, as the children were missing school.  She had a deed with
her for the ravine, which George signed in Walden, and both documents were acknowledged; but
she would not give him the money until he had the horse and buggy he was to use, at the gate,
in the spring.

He wanted to start out buying at once, but that was going too far in the future for Kate. 
While the stream was low, and the banks firm, Kate built her dam, so that it would be ready
for spring, put in the abutments, and built the bridge.  It was not a large dam, and not a
big bridge, but both were solid, well constructed, and would serve every purpose.  Then Kate
set men hauling stone for the corner foundations. She hoped to work up such a trade and buy
so much and so wisely in the summer that she could run all winter, so she was building a real
mill in the Bates way, which way included letting the foundations freeze and settle over winter.
That really was an interesting and a comfortable winter.

Kate and George both watched the children's studies at night, worked their plans finer in the
daytime, and lived as cheaply and carefully as they could.  Everything was going well.  George
was doing his best to promote the mill plan, to keep Kate satisfied at home, to steal out after
she slept, and keep himself satisfied in appetite, and some ready money in his pockets, won
at games of chance, at which he was an expert, and at cards, which he handled like a master.

CHAPTER XIX

"AS A MAN SOWETH"

AT THE earliest possible moment in the spring, the building of the mill began.  It was scarcely
well under way when the work was stopped by a week of heavy rains.  The water filled the ravine
to dangerous height and the roaring of the dam could be heard all over town.  George talked
of it incessantly.  He said it was the sweetest music his ears had ever heard.  Kate had to
confess that she like the sound herself, but she was fearful over saying much on the subject
because she was so very anxious about the stability of the dam.  There was a day or two of
fine weather; then the rains began again.  Kate said she had all the music she desired; she
proposed to be safe; so she went and opened the sluiceway to reduce the pressure on the dam.
The result was almost immediate. The water gushed through, lowering the current and lessening
the fall.  George grumbled all day, threatening half a dozen times to shut the sluice; but
Kate and the carpenter were against him, so he waited until he came slipping home after midnight,
his brain in a muddle from drink, smoke, and cards.  As he neared the dam, he decided that
the reason he felt so badly was because he had missed hearing it all day, but he would have
it to go to sleep by.  So he crossed the bridge and shut the sluice gate.  Even as he was doing
it the thunder pealed; lightning flashed, and high Heaven gave him warning that he was doing
a dangerous thing; but all his life he had done what he pleased; there was no probability that
he would change then.  He needed the roar of the dam to quiet his nerves.

The same roar that put him to sleep, awakened Kate.  She lay wondering at it and fearing. 
She raised her window to listen. The rain was falling in torrents, while the roar was awful,
so much worse than it had been when she fell asleep, that she had a suspicion of what might
have caused it.  She went to George's room and shook him awake.

"Listen to the dam!" she cried.  "It will go, as sure as fate. George, did you, Oh, did you,
close the sluice-gate when you came home?"

He was half asleep, and too defiant from drink to take his usual course.

"Sure!" he said.  "Sweesish mushich ever hearsh.  Push me shleep."

He fell back on the pillow and went on sleeping.  Kate tried again to waken him, but he struck
at her savagely.  She ran to her room, hurried into a few clothes, and getting the lantern,
started toward the bridge. At the gate she stepped into water.  As far as she could see above
the dam the street was covered.  She waded to the bridge, which was under at each end but still
bare in the middle, where it was slightly higher. Kate crossed it and started down the yard
toward the dam.  The earth was softer there, and she mired in places almost to her knees. 
At the dam, the water was tearing around each end in a mad race, carrying earth and everything
before it.  The mill side was lower than the street. The current was so broad and deep she
could not see where the sluice was.  She hesitated a second to try to locate it from the mill
behind her; and in that instant there was a crack and a roar, a mighty rush that swept her
from her feet and washed away the lantern.  Nothing saved her but the trees on the bank.  She
struck one, clung to it, pulled herself higher, and in the blackness gripped the tree, while
she heard the dam going gradually after the first break.

There was no use to scream, no one could have heard her.  The storm raved on; Kate clung to
her tree, with each flash of lightning trying to see the dam.  At last she saw that it was
not all gone.  She was not much concerned about herself.  She knew the tree would hold.  Eagerly
she strained her eyes toward the dam. She could feel the water dropping lower, while the roar
subsided to a wild rush, and with flashes of lightning she could see what she thought was at
least half of the dam holding firm.  By that time Kate began to chill.  She wrapped her arms
around the tree, and pressing her cheek against the rough bark, she cried as hard as she could
and did not care.  God would not hear; the neighbours could not.  She shook and cried until
she was worn out.  By that time the water was only a muddy flow around her ankles; if she had
a light she could wade back to the bridge and reach home.  But if she missed the bridge and
went into the ravine, the current would be too strong for her.  She held with one arm and tried
to wipe her face with the other hand.  "What a fool to cry!" she said. "As if there were any
more water needed here!"

Then she saw a light in the house, and the figures of the children, carrying it from room to
room, so she knew that one of them had awakened for a drink, or with the storm, and they had
missed her.  Then she could see them at the front door, Adam's sturdy feet planted widely apart,
bracing him, as he held up the lamp which flickered in the wind. Then she could hear his voice
shouting:  "Mother!"  Instantly Kate answered.  Then she was sorry she had, for both of them
began to scream wildly.  There was a second of that, then even the children realized its futility.

"She is out there in the water, WE GOT TO GET HER," said Adam. "We got to do it!"

He started with the light held high.  The wind blew it out.  They had to go back to relight
it.  Kate knew they would burn their fingers, and she prayed they would not set the house on
fire. When the light showed again, at the top of her lungs she screamed: "Adam, set the broom
on fire and carry it to the end of the bridge; the water isn't deep enough to hurt you."  She
tried twice, then she saw him give Polly the lamp, and run down the hall.  He came back in
an instant with the broom. Polly held the lamp high, Adam went down the walk to the gate and
started up the sidewalk.  "He's using his head," said Kate to the tree. "He's going to wait
until he reaches the bridge to start his light, so it will last longer.  THAT is BATES, anyway.
Thank God!"

Adam scratched several matches before he got the broom well ignited, then he held it high,
and by its light found the end of the bridge. Kate called to him to stop and plunging and splashing
through mud and water, she reached the bridge before the broom burned out.  There she clung
to the railing she had insisted upon, and felt her way across to the boy.  His thin cotton
night shirt was plastered to his sturdy little body.  As she touched him Kate lifted him in
her arms, and almost hugged the life from him.

"You big man!" she said.  "You could help Mother!  Good for you!"

"Is the dam gone?" he asked.

"Part of it," said Kate, sliding her feet before her, as she waded toward Polly in the doorway.

"Did Father shut the sluice-gate, to hear the roar?"

Kate hesitated.  The shivering body in her arms felt so small to her.

"I 'spect he did," said Adam.  "All day he was fussing after you stopped the roar."  Then he
added casually:  "The old fool ought-a known better.  I 'spect he was drunk again!"

"Oh, Adam!" cried Kate, setting him on the porch.  "Oh, Adam! What makes you say that?" 

In him the culture of the century will see itself realised. You must not ask of him to have any
aim other than the perfecting of himself.

The demand of the intellect, as has been well said, is simply to feel itself alive. The critic
may, indeed, desire to exercise influence; but, if so, he will concern
himself not with the individual, but with the age, which he will seek
to wake into consciousness, and to make responsive, creating in it
new desires and appetites, and lending it his larger vision and his
nobler moods.

The actual art of to-day will occupy him less than the art of to-morrow, far less than the
art of yesterday, and as for this or that person at present toiling away, what do the industrious
matter?
  She was up at the usual time and
had breakfast ready for the children. As they were starting to school George came into the room.

"Mother," said Polly, "there is a lot of folks over around the dam. What shall we tell them?"

Kate's heart stopped.  She had heard that question before.

"Tell them the truth," said Adam scornfully, before Kate could answer. "Tell them that Mother
opened the sluiceway to save the dam and Father shut it to hear it roar, and it busted!"

"Shall I, Mother?" asked Polly.

A slow whiteness spread over George's face; he stared down the hall to look.

"Tell them exactly what you please," said Kate, "only you watch yourself like a hawk.  If you
tell one word not the way it was, or in any way different from what happened, I'll punish you
severely."

"May I tell them I held the lamp while Adam got you out of the water?" asked Polly.  "That
would be true, you know."

George turned to listen, his face still whiter.

"Yes, that would be true," said Kate, "but if you tell them that, the first thing they will
ask will be 'where was your father?' What will you say then?"

"Why, we'll say that he was so drunk we couldn't wake him up," said Polly conclusively.  "We
pulled him, an' we shook him, an' we yelled at him.  Didn't we, Adam?"

"I was not drunk!" shouted George.

"Oh, yes, you were," said Adam.  "You smelled all sour, like it does at the saloon door!"

George made a rush at Adam.  The boy spread his feet and put up his hands, but never flinched
or moved.  Kate looking on felt something in her heart that never had been there before.  She
caught George's arm, as he reached the child.

"You go on to school, little folks," she said.  "And for Mother's sake try not to talk at all.
If people question you, tell them to ask Mother.  I'd be so proud of you, if you would do that."

"I WILL, if you'll hold me and kiss me again like you did last night when you got out of the
water," said Polly.

"It is a bargain," said Kate.  "How about you, Adam?"

"I will for THAT, too," said Adam, "but I'd like awful well to tell how fast the water went,
and how it poured and roared, while I held the light, and you got across.  Gee, if was awful,
Mother! So black, and so crashy, and so deep.  I'd LIKE to tell!"

"But you WON'T if I ask you not to?" queried Kate.

"I will not," said Adam.

Kate went down on her knees again, she held out her arms and both youngsters rushed to her.
After they were gone, she and George Holt looked at each other an instant, then Kate turned
to her work.  He followed:  "Kate--" he began.

"No use!" said Kate.  "If you go out and look at the highest water mark, you can easily imagine
what I had to face last night when I had to cross the bridge to open the sluice-gate, or the
bridge would have gone, too.  If the children had not wakened with the storm, and hunted me,
I'd have had to stay over there until morning, if I could have clung to the tree that long.
First they rescued me; and then they rescued YOU, if you only but knew it. By using part of
the money I had saved for the house, I can rebuild the dam; but I am done with you. We're partners
no longer.  Not with business, money, or in any other way, will I ever trust you again.  Sit
down there and eat your breakfast, and then leave my sight."

Instead George put on his old clothing, crossed the bridge, and worked all day with all his
might trying to gather building material out of the water, save debris from the dam, to clear
the village street. His sympathies, too, were wonderfully varied. In everything connected with
the stage, for instance, he was always extremely interested, and strongly upheld the necessity
for archaeological accuracy in costume and scene-painting.
  The dam he almost rebuilt himself,
as soon as the water lowered to normal again.  Kate knew what he was trying to do, and knew
also that in a month he had the village pitying him, and blaming her because he was working
himself to death, and she was allowing it.
