THE CALL OF THE CANYON

By Zane Grey

CHAPTER I

What subtle strange message had come to her out of the West? Carley Burch laid the letter in
her lap and gazed dreamily through the window.

It was a day typical of early April in New York, rather cold and gray, with steely sunlight.
Spring breathed in the air, but the women passing along Fifty-seventh Street wore furs and
wraps. She heard the distant clatter of an L train and then the hum of a motor car. A hurdy-gurdy
jarred into the interval of quiet.

"Glenn has been gone over a year," she mused, "three months over a year--and of all his strange
letters this seems the strangest yet."

She lived again, for the thousandth time, the last moments she had spent with him. It had been
on New-Year's Eve, 1918. They had called upon friends who were staying at the McAlpin, in a
suite on the twenty-first floor overlooking Broadway. And when the last quarter hour of that
eventful and tragic year began slowly to pass with the low swell of whistles and bells, Carley's
friends had discreetly left her alone with her lover, at the open window, to watch and hear
the old year out, the new year in. Glenn Kilbourne had returned from France early that fall,
shell-shocked and gassed, and otherwise incapacitated for service in the army--a wreck of his
former sterling self and in many unaccountable ways a stranger to her. Cold, silent, haunted
by something, he had made her miserable with his aloofness. But as the bells began to ring
out the year that had been his ruin Glenn had drawn her close, tenderly, passionately, and
yet strangely, too.

"Carley, look and listen!" he had whispered.

Under them stretched the great long white flare of Broadway, with its snow-covered length glittering
under a myriad of electric lights. Sixth Avenue swerved away to the right, a less brilliant
lane of blanched snow. The L trains crept along like huge fire-eyed serpents. The hum of the
ceaseless moving line of motor cars drifted upward faintly, almost drowned in the rising clamor
of the street. Broadway's gay and thoughtless crowds surged to and fro, from that height merely
a thick stream of black figures, like contending columns of ants on the march. And everywhere
the monstrous electric signs flared up vivid in white and red and green; and dimmed and paled,
only to flash up again.

Ring out the Old! Ring in the New! Carley had poignantly felt the sadness of the one, the promise
of the other. As one by one the siren factory whistles opened up with deep, hoarse bellow,
the clamor of the street and the ringing of the bells were lost in a volume of continuous sound
that swelled on high into a magnificent roar. It was the voice of a city--of a nation. It was
the voice of a people crying out the strife and the agony of the year--pealing forth a prayer
for the future.

Glenn had put his lips to her ear: "It's like the voice in my soul!" Never would she forget
the shock of that. And how she had stood spellbound, enveloped in the mighty volume of sound
no longer discordant, but full of great, pregnant melody, until the white ball burst upon the
tower of the Times Building, showing the bright figures 1919.

The new year had not been many minutes old when Glenn Kilbourne had told her he was going West
to try to recover his health.

Carley roused out of her memories to take up the letter that had so perplexed her. It bore
the postmark, Flagstaff, Arizona. She reread it with slow pondering thoughtfulness.

WEST FORK,

March 25.

DEAR CARLEY:

It does seem my neglect in writing you is unpardonable. I used to be a pretty fair correspondent,
but in that as in other things I have changed.

One reason I have not answered sooner is because your letter was so sweet and loving that it
made me feel an ungrateful and unappreciative wretch. Another is that this life I now lead
does not induce writing. I am outdoors all day, and when I get back to this cabin at night
I am too tired for anything but bed.

Your imperious questions I must answer--and that must, of course, is a third reason why I have
delayed my reply. First, you ask, "Don't you love me any more as you used to?"... Frankly,
I do not. I am sure my old love for you, before I went to France, was selfish, thoughtless,
sentimental, and boyish. I am a man now. And my love for you is different. Let me assure you
that it has been about all left to me of what is noble and beautiful. Whatever the changes
in me for the worse, my love for you, at least, has grown better, finer, purer.

And now for your second question, "Are you coming home as soon as you are well again?"... Carley,
I am well. I have delayed telling you this because I knew you would expect me to rush back
East with the telling. But--the fact is, Carley, I am not coming--just yet. I wish it were
possible for me to make you understand. For a long time I seem to have been frozen within.
You know when I came back from France I couldn't talk. It's almost as bad as that now. Yet
all that I was then seems to have changed again. It is only fair to you to tell you that, as
I feel now, I hate the city, I hate people, and particularly I hate that dancing, drinking,
lounging set you chase with. I don't want to come East until I am over that, you know... Suppose
I never get over it? Well, Carley, you can free yourself from me by one word that I could never
utter. I could never break our engagement. During the hell I went through in the war my attachment
to you saved me from moral ruin, if it did not from perfect honor and fidelity. This is another
thing I despair of making you understand. And in the chaos I've wandered through since the
war my love for you was my only anchor. You never guessed, did you, that I lived on your letters
until I got well. And now the fact that I might get along without them is no discredit to their
charm or to you.

It is all so hard to put in words, Carley. To lie down with death and get up with death was
nothing. To face one's degradation was nothing. But to come home an incomprehensibly changed
man--and to see my old life as strange as if it were the new life of another planet--to try
to slip into the old groove--well, no words of mine can tell you how utterly impossible it was.

My old job was not open to me, even if I had been able to work. NOTES ON BOOKS, CATALOGUES, SALES,
ETC.

The great interest excited by the further discovery in August last, of tesselated pavements
at Cirencester induced Professor Buckman and Mr. Newmarch at once to issue proposals for a work,
descriptive not only of those beautiful specimens of Roman art, but
also of all such other of the numerous remains found in the same locality
as they could satisfactorily identify.

To the grandeur of form, dignity of character, and great breadth of treatment exhibited in these
Pavements,--Mr. Westmacott, the Royal Academician, bears his testimony; and the fidelity with
which they have been copied in the valuable work before us reflects the highest credit upon
all parties engaged in its production.

sometimes, in her home, meeting young men there who had not gone into the service, he had seemed
to retreat into himself, singularly aloof, as if his world was not theirs.

Again, with eager eyes and quivering lips, she read the letter. It contained words that lifted
her heart. Her starved love greedily absorbed them. In them she had excuse for any resolve
that might bring Glenn closer to her. And she pondered over this longing to go to him.

Carley had the means to come and go and live as she liked. She did not remember her father,
who had died when she was a child. Her mother had left her in the care of a sister, and before
the war they had divided their time between New York and Europe, the Adirondacks and Florida,
Carley had gone in for Red Cross and relief work with more of sincerity than most of her set.
But she was really not used to making any decision as definite and important as that of going
out West alone. She had never been farther west than Jersey City; and her conception of the
West was a hazy one of vast plains and rough mountains, squalid towns, cattle herds, and uncouth
ill-clad men.

So she carried the letter to her aunt, a rather slight woman with a kindly face and shrewd
eyes, and who appeared somewhat given to old-fashioned garments.

"Aunt Mary, here's a letter from Glenn," said Carley. "It's more of a stumper than usual. Please
read it."

"Dear me! You look upset," replied the aunt, mildly, and, adjusting her spectacles, she took
the letter.

Carley waited impatiently for the perusal, conscious of inward forces coming more and more
to the aid of her impulse to go West. Her aunt paused once to murmur how glad she was that
Glenn had gotten well. Then she read on to the close.

"Carley, that's a fine letter," she said, fervently. "Do you see through it?"

"No, I don't," replied Carley. "That's why I asked you to read it."

"Do you still love Glenn as you used to before--"

"Why, Aunt Mary!" exclaimed Carley, in surprise.

"Excuse me, Carley, if I'm blunt. But the fact is young women of modern times are very different
from my kind when I was a girl. You haven't acted as though you pined for Glenn. You gad around
almost the same as ever."

"What's a girl to do?" protested Carley.

"You are twenty-six years old, Carley," retorted Aunt Mary.

"Suppose I am. I'm as young--as I ever was."

"Well, let's not argue about modern girls and modern times. We never get anywhere," returned
her aunt, kindly. "But I can tell you something of what Glenn Kilbourne means in that letter--if
you want to hear it."

"I do--indeed."

"The war did something horrible to Glenn aside from wrecking his health. Shell-shock, they
said! I don't understand that. Out of his mind, they said! But that never was true. Glenn was
as sane as I am, and, my dear, that's pretty sane, I'll have you remember. But he must have
suffered some terrible blight to his spirit--some blunting of his soul. For months after he
returned he walked as one in a trance. Then came a change. He grew restless. Perhaps that change
was for the better. At least it showed he'd roused. Glenn saw you and your friends and the
life you lead, and all the present, with eyes from which the scales had dropped. He saw what
was wrong. He never said so to me, but I knew it. It wasn't only to get well that he went West.
It was to get away.... And, Carley Burch, if your happiness depends on him you had better be
up and doing--or you'll lose him!"

"Aunt Mary!" gasped Carley.

"I mean it. That letter shows how near he came to the Valley of the Shadow--and how he has
become a man.... If I were you I'd go out West. Surely there must be a place where it would
be all right for you to stay."

"Oh, yes," replied Carley, eagerly. "Glenn wrote me there was a lodge where people went in
nice weather--right down in the canyon not far from his place. Then, of course, the town--Flagstaff--isn't
far.... Aunt Mary, I think I'll go."

"I would. You're certainly wasting your time here."

"But I could only go for a visit," rejoined Carley, thoughtfully. "A month, perhaps six weeks,
if I could stand it."

"Seems to me if you can stand New York you could stand that place," said Aunt Mary, dryly.

"The idea of staying away from New York any length of time--why, I couldn't do it I... But
I can stay out there long enough to bring Glenn back with me."

"That may take you longer than you think," replied her aunt, with a gleam in her shrewd eyes.
"If you want my advice you will surprise Glenn. Don't write him--don't give him a chance to--well
to suggest courteously that you'd better not come just yet. I don't like his words 'just yet.'"

"Auntie, you're--rather--more than blunt," said Carley, divided between resentment and amaze.
"Glenn would be simply wild to have me come."

"Maybe he would. Has he ever asked you?"

"No-o--come to think of it, he hasn't," replied Carley, reluctantly. "Aunt Mary, you hurt my
feelings."

"Well, child, I'm glad to learn your feelings are hurt," returned the aunt. "I'm sure, Carley,
that underneath all this--this blase ultra something you've acquired, there's a real heart.
Only you must hurry and listen to it--or--"

"Or what?" queried Carley.

Aunt Mary shook her gray head sagely. "Never mind what. Carley, I'd like your idea of the most
significant thing in Glenn's letter."

"Why, his love for me, of course!" replied Carley.

"Naturally you think that. But I don't. What struck me most were his words, 'out of the West.'
Carley, you'd do well to ponder over them."

"I will," rejoined Carley, positively. "I'll do more. I'll go out to his wonderful West and
see what he meant by them."

Carley Burch possessed in full degree the prevailing modern craze for speed. She loved a motor-car
ride at sixty miles an hour along a smooth, straight road, or, better, on the level seashore
of Ormond, where on moonlight nights the white blanched sand seemed to flash toward her. Therefore
quite to her taste was the Twentieth Century Limited which was hurtling her on the way to Chicago.
The unceasingly smooth and even rush of the train satisfied something in her. An old lady sitting
in an adjoining seat with a companion amused Carley by the remark: "I wish we didn't go so
fast. People nowadays haven't time to draw a comfortable breath. Suppose we should run off
the track!"

Carley had no fear of express trains, or motor cars, or transatlantic liners; in fact, she
prided herself in not being afraid of anything. But she wondered if this was not the false
courage of association with a crowd. Before this enterprise at hand she could not remember
anything she had undertaken alone. Her thrills seemed to be in abeyance to the end of her journey.
That night her sleep was permeated with the steady low whirring of the wheels. Once, roused
by a jerk, she lay awake in the darkness while the thought came to her that she and all her
fellow passengers were really at the mercy of the engineer. Who was he, and did he stand at
his throttle keen and vigilant, thinking of the lives intrusted to him? Such thoughts vaguely
annoyed Carley, and she dismissed them.

A long half-day wait in Chicago was a tedious preliminary to the second part of her journey.
But at last she found herself aboard the California Limited, and went to bed with a relief
quite a stranger to her. The glare of the sun under the curtain awakened her. Propped up on
her pillows, she looked out at apparently endless green fields or pastures, dotted now and
then with little farmhouses and tree-skirted villages. This country, she thought, must be the
prairie land she remembered lay west of the Mississippi.

Later, in the dining car, the steward smilingly answered her question: "This is Kansas, and
those green fields out there are the wheat that feeds the nation."

Carley was not impressed. The color of the short wheat appeared soft and rich, and the boundless
fields stretched away monotonously. She had not known there was so much flat land in the world,
and she imagined it might be a fine country for automobile roads. When she got back to her
seat she drew the blinds down and read her magazines. Then tiring of that, she went back to
the observation car. Carley was accustomed to attracting attention, and did not resent it,
unless she was annoyed. The train evidently had a full complement of passengers, who, as far
as Carley could see, were people not of her station in life. The glare from the many windows,
and the rather crass interest of several men, drove her back to her own section. There she
discovered that some one had drawn up her window shades. Carley promptly pulled them down and
settled herself comfortably. Then she heard a woman speak, not particularly low: "I thought
people traveled west to see the country." And a man replied, rather dryly. "Wal, not always."
His companion went on: "If that girl was mine I'd let down her skirt." The man laughed and
replied: "Martha, you're shore behind the times. Look at the pictures in the magazines."

Such remarks amused Carley, and later she took advantage of an opportunity to notice her neighbors.
They appeared a rather quaint old couple, reminding her of the natives of country towns in
the Adirondacks. She was not amused, however, when another of her woman neighbors, speaking
low, referred to her as a "lunger." Carley appreciated the fact that she was pale, but she
assured herself that there ended any possible resemblance she might have to a consumptive.
And she was somewhat pleased to hear this woman's male companion forcibly voice her own convictions.
In fact, he was nothing if not admiring.

Kansas was interminably long to Carley, and she went to sleep before riding out of it. Next
morning she found herself looking out at the rough gray and black land of New Mexico. She searched
the horizon for mountains, but there did not appear to be any. She received a vague, slow-dawning
impression that was hard to define. She did not like the country, though that was not the impression
which eluded her. Bare gray flats, low scrub-fringed hills, bleak cliffs, jumble after jumble
of rocks, and occasionally a long vista down a valley, somehow compelling--these passed before
her gaze until she tired of them. Where was the West Glenn had written about? One thing seemed
sure, and it was that every mile of this crude country brought her nearer to him. This recurring
thought gave Carley all the pleasure she had felt so far in this endless ride. It struck her
that England or France could be dropped down into New Mexico and scarcely noticed.

By and by the sun grew hot, the train wound slowly and creakingly upgrade, the car became full
of dust, all of which was disagreeable to Carley. She dozed on her pillow for hours, until
she was stirred by a passenger crying out, delightedly: "Look! Indians!"

Carley looked, not without interest. As a child she had read about Indians, and memory returned
images both colorful and romantic. From the car window she espied dusty flat barrens, low squat
mud houses, and queer-looking little people, children naked or extremely ragged and dirty,
women in loose garments with flares of red, and men in white man's garb, slovenly and motley.
All these strange individuals stared apathetically as the train slowly passed.

"Indians," muttered Carley, incredulously. "Well, if they are the noble red people, my illusions
are dispelled." She did not look out of the window again, not even when the brakeman called
out the remarkable name of Albuquerque.

Next day Carley's languid attention quickened to the name of Arizona, and to the frowning red
walls of rock, and to the vast rolling stretches of cedar-dotted land. Nevertheless, it affronted
her. This was no country for people to live in, and so far as she could see it was indeed uninhabited.
Her sensations were not, however, limited to sight. She became aware of unfamiliar disturbing
little shocks or vibrations in her ear drums, and after that a disagreeable bleeding of the
nose. The porter told her this was owing to the altitude. Thus, one thing and another kept
Carley most of the time away from the window, so that she really saw very little of the country.
From what she had seen she drew the conviction that she had not missed much. At sunset she
deliberately gazed out to discover what an Arizona sunset was like just a pale yellow flare!
She had seen better than that above the Palisades. Not until reaching Winslow did she realize
how near she was to her journey's end and that she would arrive at Flagstaff after dark. She
grew conscious of nervousness. Suppose Flagstaff were like these other queer little towns!

Not only once, but several times before the train slowed down for her destination did Carley
wish she had sent Glenn word to meet her. And when, presently, she found herself standing out
in the dark, cold, windy night before a dim-lit railroad station she more than regretted her
decision to surprise Glenn. But that was too late and she must make the best of her poor judgment.

Men were passing to and fro on the platform, some of whom appeared to be very dark of skin
and eye, and were probably Mexicans. At length an expressman approached Carley, soliciting
patronage. He took her bags and, depositing them in a wagon, he pointed up the wide street:
"One block up an' turn. Hotel Wetherford." Then he drove off. Carley followed, carrying her
small satchel. A cold wind, driving the dust, stung her face as she crossed the street to a
high sidewalk that extended along the block. There were lights in the stores and on the corners,
yet she seemed impressed by a dark, cold, windy bigness. Many people, mostly men, were passing
up and down, and there were motor cars everywhere. No one paid any attention to her. Gaining
the corner of the block, she turned, and was relieved to see the hotel sign. As she entered
the lobby a clicking of pool balls and the discordant rasp of a phonograph assailed her ears.
The expressman set down her bags and left Carley standing there. The clerk or proprietor was
talking from behind his desk to several men, and there were loungers in the lobby. The air
was thick with tobacco smoke. No one paid any attention to Carley until at length she stepped
up to the desk and interrupted the conversation there.

"Is this a hotel?" she queried, brusquely.

The shirt-sleeved individual leisurely turned and replied, "Yes, ma'am."

And Carley said: "No one would recognize it by the courtesy shown. I have been standing here
waiting to register."

With the same leisurely case and a cool, laconic stare the clerk turned the book toward her.
"Reckon people round here ask for what they want."

Carley made no further comment. She assuredly recognized that what she had been accustomed
to could not be expected out here. What she most wished to do at the moment was to get close
to the big open grate where a cheery red-and-gold fire cracked. It was necessary, however,
to follow the clerk. He assigned her to a small drab room which contained a bed, a bureau,
and a stationary washstand with one spigot. There was also a chair. While Carley removed her
coat and hat the clerk went downstairs for the rest of her luggage. Upon his return Carley
learned that a stage left the hotel for Oak Creek Canyon at nine o'clock next morning. And
this cheered her so much that she faced the strange sense of loneliness and discomfort with
something of fortitude. There was no heat in the room, and no hot water. When Carley squeezed
the spigot handle there burst forth a torrent of water that spouted up out of the washbasin
to deluge her. It was colder than any ice water she had ever felt. It was piercingly cold.
Hard upon the surprise and shock Carley suffered a flash of temper. But then the humor of it
struck her and she had to laugh.

"Serves you right--you spoiled doll of luxury!" she mocked. "This is out West. Shiver and wait
on yourself!"

Never before had she undressed so swiftly nor felt grateful for thick woollen blankets on a
hard bed. Gradually she grew warm. The blackness, too, seemed rather comforting.

"I'm only twenty miles from Glenn," she whispered. "How strange! I wonder will he be glad."
She felt a sweet, glowing assurance of that. Sleep did not come readily. Excitement had laid
hold of her nerves, and for a long time she lay awake. After a while the chug of motor cars,
the click of pool balls, the murmur of low voices all ceased. Then she heard a sound of wind
outside, an intermittent, low moaning, new to her ears, and somehow pleasant. Another sound
greeted her--the musical clanging of a clock that struck the quarters of the hour. Some time
late sleep claimed her.

Upon awakening she found she had overslept, necessitating haste upon her part. As to that,
the temperature of the room did not admit of leisurely dressing. She had no adequate name for
the feeling of the water. And her fingers grew so numb that she made what she considered a
disgraceful matter of her attire.

Downstairs in the lobby another cheerful red fire burned in the grate. How perfectly satisfying
was an open fireplace! She thrust her numb hands almost into the blaze, and simply shook with
the tingling pain that slowly warmed out of them. The lobby was deserted. A sign directed her
to a dining room in the basement, where of the ham and eggs and strong coffee she managed to
partake a little. Then she went upstairs into the lobby and out into the street.

A cold, piercing air seemed to blow right through her. Walking to the near corner, she paused
to look around. Down the main street flowed a leisurely stream of pedestrians, horses, cars,
extending between two blocks of low buildings. Across from where she stood lay a vacant lot,
beyond which began a line of neat, oddly constructed houses, evidently residences of the town.
And then lifting her gaze, instinctively drawn by something obstructing the sky line, she was
suddenly struck with surprise and delight.

"Oh! how perfectly splendid!" she burst out.

Two magnificent mountains loomed right over her, sloping up with majestic sweep of green and
black timber, to a ragged tree-fringed snow area that swept up cleaner and whiter, at last
to lift pure glistening peaks, noble and sharp, and sunrise-flushed against the blue.

Carley had climbed Mont Blanc and she had seen the Matterhorn, but they had never struck such
amaze and admiration from her as these twin peaks of her native land.

"What mountains are those?" she asked a passer-by.

"San Francisco Peaks, ma'am," replied the man.

"Why, they can't be over a mile away!" she said.

"Eighteen miles, ma'am," he returned, with a grin. "Shore this Arizonie air is deceivin'."

"How strange," murmured Carley. "It's not that way in the Adirondacks."

She was still gazing upward when a man approached her and said the stage for Oak Creek Canyon
would soon be ready to start, and he wanted to know if her baggage was ready. Carley hurried
back to her room to pack.

She had expected the stage would be a motor bus, or at least a large touring car, but it turned
out to be a two-seated vehicle drawn by a team of ragged horses. The driver was a little wizen-faced
man of doubtful years, and he did not appear obviously susceptible to the importance of his
passenger. There was considerable freight to be hauled, besides Carley's luggage, but evidently
she was the only passenger.

"Reckon it's goin' to be a bad day," said the driver. "These April days high up on the desert
are windy an' cold. Mebbe it'll snow, too. Them clouds hangin' around the peaks ain't very
promisin'. Now, miss, haven't you a heavier coat or somethin'?"

"No, I have not," replied Carley. "I'll have to stand it. Did you say this was desert?"

"I shore did. Wal, there's a hoss blanket under the seat, an' you can have that," he replied,
and, climbing to the seat in front of Carley, he took up the reins and started the horses off
at a trot.

At the first turning Carley became specifically acquainted with the driver's meaning of a bad
day. A gust of wind, raw and penetrating, laden with dust and stinging sand, swept full in
her face. It came so suddenly that she was scarcely quick enough to close her eyes. It took
considerable clumsy effort on her part with a handkerchief, aided by relieving tears, to clear
her sight again. Thus uncomfortably Carley found herself launched on the last lap of her journey.

All before her and alongside lay the squalid environs of the town. Looked back at, with the
peaks rising behind, it was not unpicturesque. But the hard road with its sheets of flying
dust, the bleak railroad yards, the round pens she took for cattle corrals, and the sordid
debris littering the approach to a huge sawmill,--these were offensive in Carley's sight. From
a tall dome-like stack rose a yellowish smoke that spread overhead, adding to the lowering
aspect of the sky. Beyond the sawmill extended the open country sloping somewhat roughly, and
evidently once a forest, but now a hideous bare slash, with ghastly burned stems of trees still
standing, and myriads of stumps attesting to denudation.

The bleak road wound away to the southwest, and from this direction came the gusty wind. It
did not blow regularly so that Carley could be on her guard. It lulled now and then, permitting
her to look about, and then suddenly again whipping dust into her face. The smell of the dust
was as unpleasant as the sting. It made her nostrils smart. It was penetrating, and a little
more of it would have been suffocating. And as a leaden gray bank of broken clouds rolled up
the wind grew stronger and the air colder. Chilled before, Carley now became thoroughly cold.

There appeared to be no end to the devastated forest land, and the farther she rode the more
barren and sordid grew the landscape. Carley forgot about the impressive mountains behind her.
And as the ride wore into hours, such was her discomfort and disillusion that she forgot about
Glenn Kilbourne. She did not reach the point of regretting her adventure, but she grew mightily
unhappy. Now and then she espied dilapidated log cabins and surroundings even more squalid
than the ruined forest. What wretched abodes! Could it be possible that people had lived in
them? She imagined men had but hardly women and children. Somewhere she had forgotten an idea
that women and children were extremely scarce in the West.

Straggling bits of forest--yellow pines, the driver called the trees--began to encroach upon
the burned-over and arid barren land. To Carley these groves, by reason of contrast and proof
of what once was, only rendered the landscape more forlorn and dreary. Why had these miles
and miles of forest been cut? By money grubbers, she supposed, the same as were devastating
the Adirondacks. Presently, when the driver had to halt to repair or adjust something wrong
with the harness, Carley was grateful for a respite from cold inaction. She got out and walked.
Sleet began to fall, and when she resumed her seat in the vehicle she asked the driver for
the blanket to cover her. The smell of this horse blanket was less endurable than the cold.
Carley huddled down into a state of apathetic misery. Already she had enough of the West.

But the sleet storm passed, the clouds broke, the sun shone through, greatly mitigating her
discomfort. By and by the road led into a section of real forest, unspoiled in any degree.
Carley saw large gray squirrels with tufted ears and white bushy tails. Presently the driver
pointed out a flock of huge birds, which Carley, on second glance, recognized as turkeys, only
these were sleek and glossy, with flecks of bronze and black and white, quite different from
turkeys back East. "There must be a farm near," said Carley, gazing about.

"No, ma'am. Them's wild turkeys," replied the driver, "an' shore the best eatin' you ever had
in your life."

A little while afterwards, as they were emerging from the woodland into more denuded country,
he pointed out to Carley a herd of gray white-rumped animals that she took to be sheep.

"An' them's antelope," he said. "Once this desert was overrun by antelope. Then they nearly
disappeared. An' now they're increasin' again."

More barren country, more bad weather, and especially an exceedingly rough road reduced Carley
to her former state of dejection. The jolting over roots and rocks and ruts was worse than
uncomfortable. She had to hold on to the seat to keep from being thrown out. The horses did
not appreciably change their gait for rough sections of the road. Then a more severe jolt brought
Carley's knee in violent contact with an iron bolt on the forward seat, and it hurt her so
acutely that she had to bite her lips to keep from screaming. A smoother stretch of road did
not come any too soon for her.

It led into forest again. And Carley soon became aware that they had at last left the cut and
burned-over district of timberland behind. A cold wind moaned through the treetops and set
the drops of water pattering down upon her. It lashed her wet face. Carley closed her eyes
and sagged in her seat, mostly oblivious to the passing scenery. "The girls will never believe
this of me," she soliloquized. And indeed she was amazed at herself. Then thought of Glenn
strengthened her. It did not really matter what she suffered on the way to him. Only she was
disgusted at her lack of stamina, and her appalling sensitiveness to discomfort.

"Wal, hyar's Oak Creek Canyon," called the driver.

Carley, rousing out of her weary preoccupation, opened her eyes to see that the driver had
halted at a turn of the road, where apparently it descended a fearful declivity.

The very forest-fringed earth seemed to have opened into a deep abyss, ribbed by red rock walls
and choked by steep mats of green timber. The chasm was a V-shaped split and so deep that looking
downward sent at once a chill and a shudder over Carley. At that point it appeared narrow and
ended in a box. In the other direction, it widened and deepened, and stretched farther on between
tremendous walls of red, and split its winding floor of green with glimpses of a gleaming creek,
bowlder-strewn and ridged by white rapids. A low mellow roar of rushing waters floated up to
Carley's ears. What a wild, lonely, terrible place! Could Glenn possibly live down there in
that ragged rent in the earth? It frightened her--the sheer sudden plunge of it from the heights.
Far down the gorge a purple light shone on the forested floor. And on the moment the sun burst
through the clouds and sent a golden blaze down into the depths, transforming them incalculably.
The great cliffs turned gold, the creek changed to glancing silver, the green of trees vividly
freshened, and in the clefts rays of sunlight burned into the blue shadows. Carley had never
gazed upon a scene like this. Hostile and prejudiced, she yet felt wrung from her an acknowledgment
of beauty and grandeur. But wild, violent, savage! Not livable! This insulated rift in the
crust of the earth was a gigantic burrow for beasts, perhaps for outlawed men--not for a civilized
person--not for Glenn Kilbourne.

"Don't be scart, ma'am," spoke up the driver. "It's safe if you're careful. An' I've druv this
manys the time."

Carley's heartbeats thumped at her side, rather denying her taunted assurance of fearlessness.
Then the rickety vehicle started down at an angle that forced her to cling to her seat.

CHAPTER II

Carley, clutching her support, with abated breath and prickling skin, gazed in fascinated suspense
over the rim of the gorge. Sometimes the wheels on that side of the vehicle passed within a
few inches of the edge. The brakes squeaked, the wheels slid; and she could hear the scrape
of the iron-shod hoofs of the horses as they held back stiff legged, obedient to the wary call
of the driver.

The first hundred yards of that steep road cut out of the cliff appeared to be the worst. It
began to widen, with descents less precipitous. Tips of trees rose level with her gaze, obstructing
sight of the blue depths. Then brush appeared on each side of the road. Gradually Carley's
strain relaxed, and also the muscular contraction by which she had braced herself in the seat.
The horses began to trot again. The wheels rattled. The road wound around abrupt corners, and
soon the green and red wall of the opposite side of the canyon loomed close. Low roar of running
water rose to Carley's ears. When at length she looked out instead of down she could see nothing
but a mass of green foliage crossed by tree trunks and branches of brown and gray. Then the
vehicle bowled under dark cool shade, into a tunnel with mossy wet cliff on one side, and close-standing
trees on the other.

"Reckon we're all right now, onless we meet somebody comin' up," declared the driver.

Carley relaxed. She drew a deep breath of relief. She had her first faint intimation that perhaps
her extensive experience of motor cars, express trains, transatlantic liners, and even a little
of airplanes, did not range over the whole of adventurous life. She was likely to meet something,
entirely new and striking out here in the West.

The murmur of falling water sounded closer. Presently Carley saw that the road turned at the
notch in the canyon, and crossed a clear swift stream. Here were huge mossy boulders, and red
walls covered by lichens, and the air appeared dim and moist, and full of mellow, hollow roar.
Beyond this crossing the road descended the west side of the canyon, drawing away and higher
from the creek. Huge trees, the like of which Carley had never seen, began to stand majestically
up out of the gorge, dwarfing the maples and white-spotted sycamores. The driver called these
great trees yellow pines.

At last the road led down from the steep slope to the floor of the canyon. What from far above
had appeared only a green timber-choked cleft proved from close relation to be a wide winding
valley, tip and down, densely forested for the most part, yet having open glades and bisected
from wall to wall by the creek. Every quarter of a mile or so the road crossed the stream;
and at these fords Carley again held on desperately and gazed out dubiously, for the creek
was deep, swift, and full of bowlders. Neither driver nor horses appeared to mind obstacles.
Carley was splashed and jolted not inconsiderably. They passed through groves of oak trees,
from which the creek manifestly derived its name; and under gleaming walls, cold, wet, gloomy,
and silent; and between lines of solemn wide-spreading pines. Carley saw deep, still green
pools eddying under huge massed jumble of cliffs, and stretches of white water, and then, high
above the treetops, a wild line of canyon rim, cold against the sky. She felt shut in from
the world, lost in an unscalable rut of the earth. Again the sunlight had failed, and the gray
gloom of the canyon oppressed her. It struck Carley as singular that she could not help being
affected by mere weather, mere heights and depths, mere rock walls and pine trees, and rushing
water. For really, what had these to do with her? These were only physical things that she
was passing. Nevertheless, although she resisted sensation, she was more and more shot through
and through with the wildness and savageness of this canyon.

A sharp turn of the road to the right disclosed a slope down the creek, across which showed
orchards and fields, and a cottage nestling at the base of the wall. The ford at this crossing
gave Carley more concern than any that had been passed, for there was greater volume and depth
of water. One of the horses slipped on the rocks, plunged up and on with great splash. They
crossed, however, without more mishap to Carley than further acquaintance with this iciest
of waters. From this point the driver turned back along the creek, passed between orchards
and fields, and drove along the base of the red wall to come suddenly upon a large rustic house
that had been hidden from Carley's sight. It sat almost against the stone cliff, from which
poured a white foamy sheet of water. The house was built of slabs with the bark on, and it
had a lower and upper porch running all around, at least as far as the cliff. Green growths
from the rock wall overhung the upper porch. A column of blue smoke curled lazily upward from
a stone chimney. On one of the porch posts hung a sign with rude lettering: "Lolomi Lodge."

"Hey, Josh, did you fetch the flour?" called a woman's voice from inside.

"Hullo I Reckon I didn't forgit nothin'," replied the man, as he got down. "An' say, Mrs. Hutter,
hyar's a young lady from Noo Yorrk."

That latter speech of the driver's brought Mrs. Hutter out on the porch. "Flo, come here,"
she called to some one evidently near at hand. And then she smilingly greeted Carley.

"Get down an' come in, miss," she said. "I'm sure glad to see you."

Carley, being stiff and cold, did not very gracefully disengage herself from the high muddy
wheel and step. When she mounted to the porch she saw that Mrs. Hutter was a woman of middle
age, rather stout, with strong face full of fine wavy lines, and kind dark eyes.

"I'm Miss Burch," said Carley.

"You're the girl whose picture Glenn Kilbourne has over his fireplace," declared the woman,
heartily. "I'm sure glad to meet you, an' my daughter Flo will be, too."

That about her picture pleased and warmed Carley. "Yes, I'm Glenn Kilbourne's fiancee. I've
come West to surprise him. Is he here.... Is--is he well?"

"Fine. I saw him yesterday. He's changed a great deal from what he was at first. Most all the
last few months. I reckon you won't know him.... But you're wet an' cold an' you look fagged.
Come right in to the fire."

"Thank you; I'm all right," returned Carley.

At the doorway they encountered a girl of lithe and robust figure, quick in her movements.
Carley was swift to see the youth and grace of her; and then a face that struck Carley as neither
pretty nor beautiful, but still wonderfully attractive.

"Flo, here's Miss Burch," burst out Mrs. Hutter, with cheerful importance. "Glenn Kilbourne's
girl come all the way from New York to surprise him!"

"Oh, Carley, I'm shore happy to meet you!" said the girl, in a voice of slow drawling richness.
"I know you. Glenn has told me all about you."

If this greeting, sweet and warm as it seemed, was a shock to Carley, she gave no sign. But
as she murmured something in reply she looked with all a woman's keenness into the face before
her. Flo Hutter had a fair skin generously freckled; a mouth and chin too firmly cut to suggest
a softer feminine beauty; and eyes of clear light hazel, penetrating, frank, fearless. Her
hair was very abundant, almost silver-gold in color, and it was either rebellious or showed
lack of care. Carley liked the girl's looks and liked the sincerity of her greeting; but instinctively
she reacted antagonistically because of the frank suggestion of intimacy with Glenn.

But for that she would have been spontaneous and friendly rather than restrained.

They ushered Carley into a big living room and up to a fire of blazing logs, where they helped
divest her of the wet wraps. And all the time they talked in the solicitous way natural to
women who were kind and unused to many visitors. Then Mrs. Hutter bustled off to make a cup
of hot coffee while Flo talked.

"We'll shore give you the nicest room--with a sleeping porch right under the cliff where the
water falls. It'll sing you to sleep. Of course you needn't use the bed outdoors until it's
warmer. Spring is late here, you know, and we'll have nasty weather yet. You really happened
on Oak Creek at its least attractive season. But then it's always--well, just Oak Creek. You'll
come to know."

"I dare say I'll remember my first sight of it and the ride down that cliff road," said Carley,
with a wan smile.

"Oh, that's nothing to what you'll see and do," returned Flo, knowingly. "We've had Eastern
tenderfeet here before. And never was there a one of them who didn't come to love Arizona."

"Tenderfoot! It hadn't occurred to me. But of course--" murmured Carley.

Then Mrs. Hutter returned, carrying a tray, which she set upon a chair, and drew to Carley's
side. "Eat an' drink," she said, as if these actions were the cardinally important ones of
life. "Flo, you carry her bags up to that west room we always give to some particular person
we want to love Lolomi." Next she threw sticks of wood upon the fire, making it crackle and
blaze, then seated herself near Carley and beamed upon her.

"You'll not mind if we call you Carley?" she asked, eagerly.

"Oh, indeed no! I--I'd like it," returned Carley, made to feel friendly and at home in spite
of herself.

"You see it's not as if you were just a stranger," went on Mrs. Hutter. "Tom--that's Flo's
father--took a likin' to Glenn Kilbourne when he first came to Oak Creek over a year ago. I
wonder if you all know how sick that soldier boy was.... Well, he lay on his back for two solid
weeks--in the room we're givin' you. An' I for one didn't think he'd ever get up. But he did.
An' he got better. An' after a while he went to work for Tom. Then six months an' more ago
he invested in the sheep business with Tom. He lived with us until he built his cabin up West
Fork. He an' Flo have run together a good deal, an' naturally he told her about you. So you
see you're not a stranger. An' we want you to feel you're with friends."

"I thank you, Mrs. Hutter," replied Carley, feelingly. "I never could thank you enough for
being good to Glenn. I did not know he was so--so sick. At first he wrote but seldom."

"Reckon he never wrote you or told you what he did in the war," declared Mrs. Hutter.

"Indeed he never did!"

"Well, I'll tell you some day. For Tom found out all about him. Got some of it from a soldier
who came to Flagstaff for lung trouble. He'd been in the same company with Glenn. We didn't
know this boy's name while he was in Flagstaff. But later Tom found out. John Henderson. He
was only twenty-two, a fine lad. An' he died in Phoenix. We tried to get him out here. But
the boy wouldn't live on charity. He was always expectin' money--a war bonus, whatever that
was. It didn't come. He was a clerk at the El Tovar for a while. Then he came to Flagstaff.
But it was too cold an' he stayed there too long."

"Too bad," rejoined Carley, thoughtfully. This information as to the suffering of American
soldiers had augmented during the last few months, and seemed to possess strange, poignant
power to depress Carley. Always she had turned away from the unpleasant. And the misery of
unfortunates was as disturbing almost as direct contact with disease and squalor. But it had
begun to dawn upon Carley that there might occur circumstances of life, in every way affronting
her comfort and happiness, which it would be impossible to turn her back upon.

At this juncture Flo returned to the room, and again Carley was struck with the girl's singular
freedom of movement and the sense of sure poise and joy that seemed to emanate from her presence.

"I've made a fire in your little stove," she said. "There's water heating. Now won't you come
up and change those traveling clothes. You'll want to fix up for Glenn, won't you?"

Carley had to smile at that. This girl indeed was frank and unsophisticated, and somehow refreshing.
Carley rose.

"You are both very good to receive me as a friend," she said. "I hope I shall not disappoint
you.... Yes, I do want to improve my appearance before Glenn sees me.... Is there any way I
can send word to him--by someone who has not seen me?"

"There shore is. I'll send Charley, one of our hired boys."

"Thank you. Then tell him to say there is a lady here from New York to see him, and it is very
important."

Flo Hutter clapped her hands and laughed with glee. Her gladness gave Carley a little twinge
of conscience. Jealously was an unjust and stifling thing.

Carley was conducted up a broad stairway and along a boarded hallway to a room that opened
out on the porch. A steady low murmur of falling water assailed her ears. Through the open
door she saw across the porch to a white tumbling lacy veil of water falling, leaping, changing,
so close that it seemed to touch the heavy pole railing of the porch.

This room resembled a tent. The sides were of canvas. It had no ceiling. But the roughhewn
shingles of the roof of the house sloped down closely. The furniture was home made. An Indian
rug covered the floor. The bed with its woolly clean blankets and the white pillows looked
inviting.

"Is this where Glenn lay--when he was sick?" queried Carley.

"Yes," replied Flo, gravely, and a shadow darkened her eyes. "I ought to tell you all about
it. I will some day. But you must not be made unhappy now.... Glenn nearly died here. Mother
or I never left his side--for a while there--when life was so bad."

She showed Carley how to open the little stove and put the short billets of wood inside and
work the damper; and cautioning her to keep an eye on it so that it would not get too hot,
she left Carley to herself.

Carley found herself in an unfamiliar mood. There came a leap of her heart every time she thought
of the meeting with Glenn, so soon now to be, but it was not that which was unfamiliar. She
seemed to have a difficult approach to undefined and unusual thoughts. All this was so different
from her regular life. Besides she was tired. But these explanations did not suffice. There
was a pang in her breast which must owe its origin to the fact that Glenn Kilbourne had been
ill in this little room and some other girl than Carley Burch had nursed him. "Am I jealous?"
she whispered. "No!" But she knew in her heart that she lied. A woman could no more help being
jealous, under such circumstances, than she could help the beat and throb of her blood. Nevertheless,
Carley was glad Flo Hutter had been there, and always she would be grateful to her for that
kindness.

Carley disrobed and, donning her dressing gown, she unpacked her bags and hung her things upon
pegs under the curtained shelves. Then she lay down to rest, with no intention of slumber.
But there was a strange magic in the fragrance of the room, like the piny tang outdoors, and
in the feel of the bed, and especially in the low, dreamy hum and murmur of the waterfall.
She fell asleep. When she awakened it was five o'clock. The fire in the stove was out, but
the water was still warm. She bathed and dressed, not without care, yet as swiftly as was her
habit at home; and she wore white because Glenn had always liked her best in white. But it
was assuredly not a gown to wear in a country house where draughts of cold air filled the unheated
rooms and halls. So she threw round her a warm sweater-shawl, with colorful bars becoming to
her dark eyes and hair.

All the time that she dressed and thought, her very being seemed to be permeated by that soft
murmuring sound of falling water. No moment of waking life there at Lolomi Lodge, or perhaps
of slumber hours, could be wholly free of that sound. It vaguely tormented Carley, yet was
not uncomfortable. She went out upon the porch. The small alcove space held a bed and a rustic
chair. Above her the peeled poles of the roof descended to within a few feet of her head. She
had to lean over the rail of the porch to look up. The green and red rock wall sheered ponderously
near. The waterfall showed first at the notch of a fissure, where the cliff split; and down
over smooth places the water gleamed, to narrow in a crack with little drops, and suddenly
to leap into a thin white sheet.

Out from the porch the view was restricted to glimpses between the pines, and beyond to the
opposite wall of the canyon. How shut-in, how walled in this home!

"In summer it might be good to spend a couple of weeks here," soliloquized Carley. "But to
live here? Heavens! A person might as well be buried."

Heavy footsteps upon the porch below accompanied by a man's voice quickened Carley's pulse.
Did they belong to Glenn? After a strained second she decided not. Nevertheless, the acceleration
of her blood and an unwonted glow of excitement, long a stranger to her, persisted as she left
the porch and entered the boarded hall. How gray and barn-like this upper part of the house!
From the head of the stairway, however, the big living room presented a cheerful contrast.
There were warm colors, some comfortable rockers, a lamp that shed a bright light, and an open
fire which alone would have dispelled the raw gloom of the day.

A large man in corduroys and top boots advanced to meet Carley. He had a clean-shaven face
that might have been hard and stern but for his smile, and one look into his eyes revealed
their resemblance to Flo's.

"I'm Tom Hutter, an' I'm shore glad to welcome you to Lolomi, Miss Carley," he said. His voice
was deep and slow. There were ease and force in his presence, and the grip he gave Carley's
hand was that of a man who made no distinction in hand-shaking. Carley, quick in her perceptions,
instantly liked him and sensed in him a strong personality. She greeted him in turn and expressed
her thanks for his goodness to Glenn. Naturally Carley expected him to say something about
her fiance, but he did not.

"Well, Miss Carley, if you don't mind, I'll say you're prettier than your picture," said Hutter.
"An' that is shore sayin' a lot. All the sheep herders in the country have taken a peep at
your picture. Without permission, you understand."

"I'm greatly flattered," laughed Carley.

"We're glad you've come," replied Hutter, simply. "I just got back from the East myself. Chicago
an' Kansas City. I came to Arizona from Illinois over thirty years ago. An' this was my first
trip since. Reckon I've not got back my breath yet. Times have changed, Miss Carley. Times
an' people!"

Mrs. Hutter bustled in from the kitchen, where manifestly she had been importantly engaged.
"For the land's sakes!" she exclaimed, fervently, as she threw up her hands at sight of Carley.
Her expression was indeed a compliment, but there was a suggestion of shock in it. Then Flo
came in. She wore a simple gray gown that reached the top of her high shoes.

"Carley, don't mind mother," said Flo. "She means your dress is lovely. Which is my say, too....
But, listen. I just saw Glenn comin' up the road."

Carley ran to the open door with more haste than dignity. She saw a tall man striding along.
Something about him appeared familiar. It was his walk--an erect swift carriage, with a swing
of the march still visible. She recognized Glenn. And all within her seemed to become unstable.
She watched him cross the road, face the house. How changed! No--this was not Glenn Kilbourne.
This was a bronzed man, wide of shoulder, roughly garbed, heavy limbed, quite different from
the Glenn she remembered. He mounted the porch steps. And Carley, still unseen herself, saw
his face. Yes--Glenn! Hot blood seemed to be tingling liberated in her veins. Wheeling away,
she backed against the wall behind the door and held up a warning finger to Flo, who stood
nearest. Strange and disturbing then, to see something in Flo Hutter's eyes that could be read
by a woman in only one way!

A tall form darkened the doorway. It strode in and halted.

"Flo!--who--where?" he began, breathlessly.

His voice, so well remembered, yet deeper, huskier, fell upon Carley's ears as something unconsciously
longed for. His frame had so filled out that she did not recognize it. His face, too, had unbelievably
changed--not in the regularity of feature that had been its chief charm, but in contour of
cheek and vanishing of pallid hue and tragic line. Carley's heart swelled with joy. Beyond
all else she had hoped to see the sad fixed hopelessness, the havoc, gone from his face. Therefore
the restraint and nonchalance upon which Carley prided herself sustained eclipse.

"Glenn! Look--who's--here!" she called, in voice she could not have steadied to save her life.
This meeting was more than she had anticipated.

Glenn whirled with an inarticulate cry. He saw Carley. Then--no matter how unreasonable or
exacting had been Carley's longings, they were satisfied.

"You!" he cried, and leaped at her with radiant face.

Carley not only did not care about the spectators of this meeting, but forgot them utterly.
More than the joy of seeing Glenn, more than the all-satisfying assurance to her woman's heart
that she was still beloved, welled up a deep, strange, profound something that shook her to
her depths. It was beyond selfishness. It was gratitude to God and to the West that had restored
him.

"Carley! I couldn't believe it was you," he declared, releasing her from his close embrace,
yet still holding her.

"Yes, Glenn--it's I--all you've left of me," she replied, tremulously, and she sought with
unsteady hands to put up her dishevelled hair. "You--you big sheep herder! You Goliath!"

"I never was so knocked off my pins," he said. "A lady to see me--from New York!... Of course
it had to be you. But I couldn't believe. Carley, you were good to come."

Somehow the soft, warm look of his dark eyes hurt her. New and strange indeed it was to her,
as were other things about him. Why had she not come West sooner? She disengaged herself from
his hold and moved away, striving for the composure habitual with her. Flo Hutter was standing
before the fire, looking down. Mrs. Hutter beamed upon Carley.

"Now let's have supper," she said.

"Reckon Miss Carley can't eat now, after that hug Glenn gave her," drawled Tom Hutter. "I was
some worried. You see Glenn has gained seventy pounds in six months. An' he doesn't know his
strength."

"Seventy pounds!" exclaimed Carley, gayly. "I thought it was more."

"Carley, you must excuse my violence," said Glenn. "I've been hugging sheep. That is, when
I shear a sheep I have to hold him."

They all laughed, and so the moment of readjustment passed. Presently Carley found herself
sitting at table, directly across from Flo. A pearly whiteness was slowly warming out of the
girl's face. Her frank clear eyes met Carley's and they had nothing to hide. Carley's first
requisite for character in a woman was that she be a thoroughbred. She lacked it often enough
herself to admire it greatly in another woman. And that moment saw a birth of respect and sincere
liking in her for this Western girl. If Flo Hutter ever was a rival she would be an honest one.

Not long after supper Tom Hutter winked at Carley and said he "reckoned on general principles
it was his hunch to go to bed." Mrs. Hutter suddenly discovered tasks to perform elsewhere.
And Flo said in her cool sweet drawl, somehow audacious and tantalizing, "Shore you two will
want to spoon."

"Now, Flo, Eastern girls are no longer old-fashioned enough for that," declared Glenn.

"Too bad! Reckon I can't see how love could ever be old-fashioned. Good night, Glenn. Good
night, Carley."

Flo stood an instant at the foot of the dark stairway where the light from the lamp fell upon
her face. It seemed sweet and earnest to Carley. It expressed unconscious longing, but no envy.
Then she ran up the stairs to disappear.

"Glenn, is that girl in love with you?" asked Carley, bluntly.

To her amaze, Glenn laughed. When had she heard him laugh? It thrilled her, yet nettled her
a little.

"If that isn't like you!" he ejaculated. "Your very first words after we are left alone! It
brings back the East, Carley."

"Probably recall to memory will be good for you," returned Carley. "But tell me. Is she in
love with you?"

"Why, no, certainly not!" replied Glenn. "Anyway, how could I answer such a question? It just
made me laugh, that's all."

"Humph! I can remember when you were not above making love to a pretty girl. You certainly
had me worn to a frazzle--before we became engaged," said Carley.

"Old times! How long ago they seem!... Carley, it's sure wonderful to see you."

"How do you like my gown?" asked Carley, pirouetting for his benefit.

"Well, what little there is of it is beautiful," he replied, with a slow smile. "I always liked
you best in white. Did you remember?"

"Yes. I got the gown for you. And I'll never wear it except for you."

"Same old coquette--same old eternal feminine," he said, half sadly. "You know when you look
stunning.... But, Carley, the cut of that--or rather the abbreviation of it--inclines me to
think that style for women's clothes has not changed for the better. In fact, it's worse than
two years ago in Paris and later in New York. Where will you women draw the line?"

"Women are slaves to the prevailing mode," rejoined Carley. "I don't imagine women who dress
would ever draw a line, if fashion went on dictating."

"But would they care so much--if they had to work--plenty of work--and children?" inquired
Glenn, wistfully.

"Glenn! Work and children for modern women? Why, you are dreaming!" said Carley, with a laugh.

She saw him gaze thoughtfully into the glowing embers of the fire, and as she watched him her
quick intuition grasped a subtle change in his mood. It brought a sternness to his face. She
could hardly realize she was looking at the Glenn Kilbourne of old.

"Come close to the fire," he said, and pulled up a chair for her. Then he threw more wood upon
the red coals. "You must be careful not to catch cold out here. The altitude makes a cold dangerous.
And that gown is no protection."

"Glenn, one chair used to be enough for us," she said, archly, standing beside him.

But he did not respond to her hint, and, a little affronted, she accepted the proffered chair.
Then he began to ask questions rapidly. He was eager for news from home--from his people--from
old friends. However he did not inquire of Carley about her friends. She talked unremittingly
for an hour, before she satisfied his hunger. But when her turn came to ask questions she found
him reticent.

He had fallen upon rather hard days at first out here in the West; then his health had begun
to improve; and as soon as he was able to work his condition rapidly changed for the better;
and now he was getting along pretty well. Carley felt hurt at his apparent disinclination to
confide in her. The strong cast of his face, as if it had been chiseled in bronze; the stern
set of his lips and the jaw that protruded lean and square cut; the quiet masked light of his
eyes; the coarse roughness of his brown hands, mute evidence of strenuous labors--these all
gave a different impression from his brief remarks about himself. Lastly there was a little
gray in the light-brown hair over his temples. Glenn was only twenty-seven, yet he looked ten
years older. Studying him so, with the memory of earlier years in her mind, she was forced
to admit that she liked him infinitely more as he was now. He seemed proven. Something had
made him a man. Had it been his love for her, or the army service, or the war in France, or
the struggle for life and health afterwards? Or had it been this rugged, uncouth West? Carley
felt insidious jealousy of this last possibility. She feared this West. She was going to hate
it. She had womanly intuition enough to see in Flo Hutter a girl somehow to be reckoned with.
Still, Carley would not acknowledge to herself that his simple, unsophisticated Western girl
could possibly be a rival. Carley did not need to consider the fact that she had been spoiled
by the attention of men. It was not her vanity that precluded Flo Hutter as a rival.

Gradually the conversation drew to a lapse, and it suited Carley to let it be so. She watched
Glenn as he gazed thoughtfully into the amber depths of the fire. What was going on in his
mind? Carley's old perplexity suddenly had rebirth. And with it came an unfamiliar fear which
she could not smother. Every moment that she sat there beside Glenn she was realizing more
and more a yearning, passionate love for him. The unmistakable manifestation of his joy at
sight of her, the strong, almost rude expression of his love, had called to some responsive,
but hitherto unplumbed deeps of her. If it had not been for these undeniable facts Carley would
have been panic-stricken. They reassured her, yet only made her state of mind more dissatisfied.

"Carley, do you still go in for dancing?" Glenn asked, presently, with his thoughtful eyes
turning to her.

"Of course. I like dancing, and it's about all the exercise I get," she replied.

"Have the dances changed--again?"

"It's the music, perhaps, that changes the dancing. Jazz is becoming popular. And about all
the crowd dances now is an infinite variation of fox-trot."

"No waltzing?"

"I don't believe I waltzed once this winter."

"Jazz? That's a sort of tinpanning, jiggly stuff, isn't it?"

"Glenn, it's the fever of the public pulse," replied Carley. "The graceful waltz, like the
stately minuet, flourished back in the days when people rested rather than raced."

"More's the pity," said Glenn. Then after a moment, in which his gaze returned to the fire,
he inquired rather too casually, "Does Morrison still chase after you?"

"Glenn, I'm neither old--nor married," she replied, laughing.

"No, that's true. But if you were married it wouldn't make any difference to Morrison."

Carley could not detect bitterness or jealousy in his voice. She would not have been averse
to hearing either. She gathered from his remark, however, that he was going to be harder than
ever to understand. What had she said or done to make him retreat within himself, aloof, impersonal,
unfamiliar? He did not impress her as loverlike. What irony of fate was this that held her
there yearning for his kisses and caresses as never before, while he watched the fire, and
talked as to a mere acquaintance, and seemed sad and far away? Or did she merely imagine that?
Only one thing could she be sure of at that moment, and it was that pride would never be her ally.

"Glenn, look here," she said, sliding her chair close to his and holding out her left hand,
slim and white, with its glittering diamond on the third finger.

He took her hand in his and pressed it, and smiled at her. "Yes, Carley, it's a beautiful,
soft little hand. But I think I'd like it better if it were strong and brown, and coarse on
the inside--from useful work."

"Like Flo Hutter's?" queried Carley.

"Yes."

Carley looked proudly into his eyes. "People are born in different stations. I respect your
little Western friend, Glenn, but could I wash and sweep, milk cows and chop wood, and all
that sort of thing?"

"I suppose you couldn't," he admitted, with a blunt little laugh.

"Would you want me to?" she asked.

"Well, that's hard to say," he replied, knitting his brows. "I hardly know. I think it depends
on you.... But if you did do such work wouldn't you be happier?"

"Happier! Why Glenn, I'd be miserable!... But listen. It wasn't my beautiful and useless hand
I wanted you to see. It was my engagement ring."

"Oh!--Well?" he went on, slowly.

"I've never had it off since you left New York," she said, softly. "You gave it to me four
years ago. Do you remember? It was on my twenty-second birthday. You said it would take two
months' salary to pay the bill."

"It sure did," he retorted, with a hint of humor.

"Glenn, during the war it was not so--so very hard to wear this ring as an engagement ring
should be worn," said Carley, growing more earnest. "But after the war--especially after your
departure West it was terribly hard to be true to the significance of this betrothal ring.
There was a let-down in all women. Oh, no one need tell me! There was. And men were affected
by that and the chaotic condition of the times. New York was wild during the year of your absence.
Prohibition was a joke.--Well, I gadded, danced, dressed, drank, smoked, motored, just the
same as the other women in our crowd. Something drove me to. I never rested. Excitement seemed
to be happiness--Glenn, I am not making any plea to excuse all that. But I want you to know--how
under trying circumstances--I was absolutely true to you. Understand me. I mean true as regards
love. Through it all I loved you just the same. And now I'm with you, it seems, oh, so much
more!... Your last letter hurt me. I don't know just how. But I came West to see you--to tell
you this--and to ask you.... Do you want this ring back?"

"Certainly not," he replied, forcibly, with a dark flush spreading over his face.

"Then--you love me?" she whispered.

"Yes--I love you," he returned, deliberately. "And in spite of all you say--very probably more
than you love me.... But you, like all women, make love and its expression the sole object
of life. Carley, I have been concerned with keeping my body from the grave and my soul from hell."

"But--dear--you're well now?" she returned, with trembling lips.

"Yes, I've almost pulled out."

"Then what is wrong?"

"Wrong?--With me or you," he queried, with keen, enigmatical glance upon her.

"What is wrong between us? There is something."

"Carley, a man who has been on the verge--as I have been--seldom or never comes back to happiness.
But perhaps--"

"You frighten me," cried Carley, and, rising, she sat upon the arm of his chair and encircled
his neck with her arms. "How can I help if I do not understand? Am I so miserably little?...
Glenn, must I tell you? No woman can live without love. I need to be loved. That's all that's
wrong with me."

"Carley, you are still an imperious, mushy girl," replied Glenn, taking her into his arms.
"I need to be loved, too. But that's not what is wrong with me. You'll have to find it out
yourself."

"You're a dear old Sphinx," she retorted.

"Listen, Carley," he said, earnestly. "About this love-making stuff. Please don't misunderstand
me. I love you. I'm starved for your kisses. But--is it right to ask them?"

"Right! Aren't we engaged? And don't I want to give them?"

"If I were only sure we'd be married!" he said, in low, tense voice, as if speaking more to
himself.

"Married!" cried Carley, convulsively clasping him. "Of course we'll be married. Glenn, you
wouldn't jilt me?"

"Carley, what I mean is that you might never really marry me," he answered, seriously.

"Oh, if that's all you need be sure of, Glenn Kilbourne, you may begin to make love to me now."

It was late when Carley went up to her room. And she was in such a softened mood, so happy
and excited and yet disturbed in mind, that the coldness and the darkness did not matter in
the least. She undressed in pitchy blackness, stumbling over chair and bed, feeling for what
she needed. And in her mood this unusual proceeding was fun. When ready for bed she opened
the door to take a peep out. Through the dense blackness the waterfall showed dimly opaque.
Carley felt a soft mist wet her face. The low roar of the falling water seemed to envelop her.
Under the cliff wall brooded impenetrable gloom. But out above the treetops shone great stars,
wonderfully white and radiant and cold, with a piercing contrast to the deep clear blue of
sky. The waterfall hummed into an absolutely dead silence. It emphasized the silence. Not only
cold was it that made Carley shudder. How lonely, how lost, how hidden this canyon!

Then she hurried to bed, grateful for the warm woolly blankets. Relaxation and thought brought
consciousness of the heat of her blood, the beat and throb and swell of her heart, of the tumult
within her. In the lonely darkness of her room she might have faced the truth of her strangely
renewed and augmented love for Glenn Kilbourne. But she was more concerned with her happiness.
She had won him back. Her presence, her love had overcome his restraint. She thrilled in the
sweet consciousness of her woman's conquest. How splendid he was! To hold back physical tenderness,
the simple expressions of love, because he had feared they might unduly influence her! He had
grown in many ways. She must be careful to reach up to his ideals. That about Flo Hutter's
toil-hardened hands! Was that significance somehow connected with the rift in the lute? For
Carley admitted to herself that there was something amiss, something incomprehensible, something
intangible that obtruded its menace into her dream of future happiness. Still, what had she
to fear, so long as she could be with Glenn?

And yet there were forced upon her, insistent and perplexing, the questions--was her love selfish?
was she considering him? was she blind to something he could see? Tomorrow and next day and
the days to come held promise of joyous companionship with Glenn, yet likewise they seemed
full of a portent of trouble for her, or fight and ordeal, of lessons that would make life
significant for her.

CHAPTER III

Carley was awakened by rattling sounds in her room. The raising of sleepy eyelids disclosed
Flo on her knees before the little stove, in the act of lighting a fire.

"Mawnin', Carley," she drawled. "It's shore cold. Reckon it'll snow today, worse luck, just
because you're here. Take my hunch and stay in bed till the fire burns up."

"I shall do no such thing," declared Carley, heroically.

"We're afraid you'll take cold," said Flo. "This is desert country with high altitude. Spring
is here when the sun shines. But it's only shinin' in streaks these days. That means winter,
really. Please be good."

"Well, it doesn't require much self-denial to stay here awhile longer," replied Carley, lazily.

Flo left with a parting admonition not to let the stove get red-hot. And Carley lay snuggled
in the warm blankets, dreading the ordeal of getting out into that cold bare room. Her nose
was cold. When her nose grew cold, it being a faithful barometer as to temperature, Carley
knew there was frost in the air. She preferred summer. Steam-heated rooms with hothouse flowers
lending their perfume had certainly not trained Carley for primitive conditions. She had a
spirit, however, that was waxing a little rebellious to all this intimation as to her susceptibility
to colds and her probable weakness under privation. Carley got up. Her bare feet landed upon
the board floor instead of the Navajo rug, and she thought she had encountered cold stone.
Stove and hot water notwithstanding, by the time she was half dressed she was also half frozen.
"Some actor fellow once said w-when you w-went West you were c-camping out," chattered Carley.
"Believe me, he said something."

The fact was Carley had never camped out. Her set played golf, rode horseback, motored and
house-boated, but they had never gone in for uncomfortable trips. The camps and hotels in the
Adirondacks were as warm and luxurious as Carley's own home. Carley now missed many things.
And assuredly her flesh was weak. It cost her effort of will and real pain to finish lacing
her boots. As she had made an engagement with Glenn to visit his cabin, she had donned an outdoor
suit. She wondered if the cold had anything to do with the perceptible diminishing of the sound
of the waterfall. Perhaps some of the water had frozen, like her fingers.

Carley went downstairs to the living room, and made no effort to resist a rush to the open
fire. Flo and her mother were amused at Carley's impetuosity. "You'll like that stingin' of
the air after you get used to it," said Mrs. Hutter. Carley had her doubts. When she was thoroughly
thawed out she discovered an appetite quite unusual for her, and she enjoyed her breakfast.
Then it was time to sally forth to meet Glenn.

"It's pretty sharp this mawnin'," said Flo. "You'll need gloves and sweater."

Having fortified herself with these, Carley asked how to find West Fork Canyon.

"It's down the road a little way," replied Flo. "A great narrow canyon opening on the right
side. You can't miss it."

Flo accompanied her as far as the porch steps. A queer-looking individual was slouching along
with ax over his shoulder.

"There's Charley," said Flo. "He'll show you." Then she whispered: "He's sort of dotty sometimes.
A horse kicked him once. But mostly he's sensible."

At Flo's call the fellow halted with a grin. He was long, lean, loose jointed, dressed in blue
overalls stuck into the tops of muddy boots, and his face was clear olive without beard or
line. His brow bulged a little, and from under it peered out a pair of wistful brown eyes that
reminded Carley of those of a dog she had once owned.

"Wal, it ain't a-goin' to be a nice day," remarked Charley, as he tried to accommodate his
strides to Carley's steps.

"How can you tell?" asked Carley. "It looks clear and bright."

"Naw, this is a dark mawnin'. Thet's a cloudy sun. We'll hev snow on an' off."

"Do you mind bad weather?"

"Me? All the same to me. Reckon, though, I like it cold so I can loaf round a big fire at night."

"I like a big fire, too."

"Ever camped out?" he asked.

"Not what you'd call the real thing," replied Carley.

"Wal, thet's too bad. Reckon it'll be tough fer you," he went on, kindly. "There was a gurl
tenderfoot heah two years ago an' she had a hell of a time. They all joked her, 'cept me, an'
played tricks on her. An' on her side she was always puttin' her foot in it. I was shore sorry
fer her."

"You were very kind to be an exception," murmured Carley.

"You look out fer Tom Hutter, an' I reckon Flo ain't so darn above layin' traps fer you. 'Specially
as she's sweet on your beau. I seen them together a lot."

"Yes?" interrogated Carley, encouragingly.

"Kilbourne is the best fellar thet ever happened along Oak Creek. I helped him build his cabin.
We've hunted some together. Did you ever hunt?"

"No."

"Wal, you've shore missed a lot of fun," he said. "Turkey huntin'. Thet's what fetches the
gurls. I reckon because turkeys are so good to eat. The old gobblers hev begun to gobble now.
I'll take you gobbler huntin' if you'd like to go."

"I'm sure I would."

"There's good trout fishin' along heah a little later," he said, pointing to the stream. "Crick's
too high now. I like West Fork best. I've ketched some lammin' big ones up there."

Carley was amused and interested. She could not say that Charley had shown any indication of
his mental peculiarity to her. It took considerable restraint not to lead him to talk more
about Flo and Glenn. Presently they reached the turn in the road, opposite the cottage Carley
had noticed yesterday, and here her loquacious escort halted.

"You take the trail heah," he said, pointing it out, "an' foller it into West Fork. So long,
an' don't forget we're goin' huntin' turkeys."

Carley smiled her thanks, and, taking to the trail, she stepped out briskly, now giving attention
to her surroundings. The canyon had widened, and the creek with its deep thicket of green and
white had sheered to the left. On her right the canyon wall appeared to be lifting higher--and
higher. She could not see it well, owing to intervening treetops. The trail led her through
a grove of maples and sycamores, out into an open park-like bench that turned to the right
toward the cliff. Suddenly Carley saw a break in the red wall. It was the intersecting canyon,
West Fork. What a narrow red-walled gateway! Huge pine trees spread wide gnarled branches over
her head. The wind made soft rush in their tops, sending the brown needles lightly on the air.
Carley turned the bulging corner, to be halted by a magnificent spectacle. It seemed a mountain
wall loomed over her. It was the western side of this canyon, so lofty that Carley had to tip
back her head to see the top. She swept her astonished gaze down the face of this tremendous
red mountain wall and then slowly swept it upward again. This phenomenon of a cliff seemed
beyond the comprehension of her sight. It looked a mile high. The few trees along its bold
rampart resembled short spear-pointed bushes outlined against the steel gray of sky. Ledges,
caves, seams, cracks, fissures, beetling red brows, yellow crumbling crags, benches of green
growths and niches choked with brush, and bold points where single lonely pine trees grew perilously,
and blank walls a thousand feet across their shadowed faces--these features gradually took
shape in Carley's confused sight, until the colossal mountain front stood up before her in
all its strange, wild, magnificent ruggedness and beauty.

"Arizona! Perhaps this is what he meant," murmured Carley. "I never dreamed of anything like
this.... But, oh! it overshadows me--bears me down! I could never have a moment's peace under it."

It fascinated her. There were inaccessible ledges that haunted her with their remote fastnesses.
How wonderful would it be to get there, rest there, if that were possible! But only eagles
could reach them. There were places, then, that the desecrating hands of man could not touch.
The dark caves were mystically potent in their vacant staring out at the world beneath them.
The crumbling crags, the toppling ledges, the leaning rocks all threatened to come thundering
down at the breath of wind. How deep and soft the red color in contrast with the green! How
splendid the sheer bold uplift of gigantic steps! Carley found herself marveling at the forces
that had so rudely, violently, and grandly left this monument to nature.

"Well, old Fifth Avenue gadder!" called a gay voice. "If the back wall of my yard so halts
you--what will you ever do when you see the Painted Desert, or climb Sunset Peak, or look down
into the Grand Canyon?"

"Oh, Glenn, where are you?" cried Carley, gazing everywhere near at hand. But he was farther
away. The clearness of his voice had deceived her. Presently she espied him a little distance
away, across a creek she had not before noticed.

"Come on," he called. "I want to see you cross the stepping stones."

Carley ran ahead, down a little slope of clean red rock, to the shore of the green water. It
was clear, swift, deep in some places and shallow in others, with white wreathes or ripples
around the rocks evidently placed there as a means to cross. Carley drew back aghast.

"Glenn, I could never make it," she called.

"Come on, my Alpine climber," he taunted. "Will you let Arizona daunt you?"

"Do you want me to fall in and catch cold?" she cried, desperately.

"Carley, big women might even cross the bad places of modern life on stepping stones of their
dead selves!" he went on, with something of mockery. "Surely a few physical steps are not beyond
you."

"Say, are you mangling Tennyson or just kidding me?" she demanded slangily.

"My love, Flo could cross here with her eyes shut."

That thrust spurred Carley to action. His words were jest, yet they held a hint of earnest.
With her heart at her throat Carley stepped on the first rock, and, poising, she calculated
on a running leap from stone to stone. Once launched, she felt she was falling downhill. She
swayed, she splashed, she slipped; and clearing the longest leap from the last stone to shore
she lost her balance and fell into Glenn's arms. His kisses drove away both her panic and her
resentment.

"By Jove! I didn't think you'd even attempt it!" he declared, manifestly pleased. "I made sure
I'd have to pack you over--in fact, rather liked the idea."

"I wouldn't advise you to employ any such means again--to dare me," she retorted.

"That's a nifty outdoor suit you've on," he said, admiringly. "I was wondering what you'd wear.
I like short outing skirts for women, rather than trousers. The service sort of made the fair
sex dippy about pants."

"It made them dippy about more than that," she replied. "You and I will never live to see the
day that women recover their balance."

"I agree with you," replied Glenn.

Carley locked her arm in his. "Honey, I want to have a good time today. Cut out all the other
women stuff.... Take me to see your little gray home in the West. Or is it gray?"

He laughed. "Why, yes, it's gray, just about. The logs have bleached some."

Glenn led her away up a trail that climbed between bowlders, and meandered on over piny mats
of needles under great, silent, spreading pines; and closer to the impondering mountain wall,
where at the base of the red rock the creek murmured strangely with hollow gurgle, where the
sun had no chance to affect the cold damp gloom; and on through sweet-smelling woods, out into
the sunlight again, and across a wider breadth of stream; and up a slow slope covered with
stately pines, to a little cabin that faced the west.

"Here we are, sweetheart," said Glenn. "Now we shall see what you are made of."

Carley was non-committal as to that. Her intense interest precluded any humor at this moment.
Not until she actually saw the log cabin Glenn had erected with his own hands had she been
conscious of any great interest. But sight of it awoke something unaccustomed in Carley. As
she stepped into the cabin her heart was not acting normally for a young woman who had no illusions
about love in a cottage.

Glenn's cabin contained one room about fifteen feet wide by twenty long. Between the peeled
logs were lines of red mud, hard dried. There was a small window opposite the door. In one
corner was a couch of poles, with green tips of pine boughs peeping from under the blankets.
The floor consisted of flat rocks laid irregularly, with many spaces of earth showing between.
The open fireplace appeared too large for the room, but the very bigness of it, as well as
the blazing sticks and glowing embers, appealed strongly to Carley. A rough-hewn log formed
the mantel, and on it Carley's picture held the place of honor. Above this a rifle lay across
deer antlers. Carley paused here in her survey long enough to kiss Glenn and point to her photograph.

"You couldn't have pleased me more."

To the left of the fireplace was a rude cupboard of shelves, packed with boxes, cans, bags,
and utensils. Below the cupboard, hung upon pegs, were blackened pots and pans, a long-handled
skillet, and a bucket. Glenn's table was a masterpiece. There was no danger of knocking it
over. It consisted of four poles driven into the ground, upon which had been nailed two wide
slabs. This table showed considerable evidence of having been scrubbed scrupulously clean.
There were two low stools, made out of boughs, and the seats had been covered with woolly sheep
hide. In the right-hand corner stood a neat pile of firewood, cut with an ax, and beyond this
hung saddle and saddle blanket, bridle and spurs. An old sombrero was hooked upon the pommel
of the saddle. Upon the wall, higher up, hung a lantern, resting in a coil of rope that Carley
took to be a lasso. Under a shelf upon which lay a suitcase hung some rough wearing apparel.

Carley noted that her picture and the suit case were absolutely the only physical evidences
of Glenn's connection with his Eastern life. That had an unaccountable effect upon Carley.
What had she expected? Then, after another survey of the room, she began to pester Glenn with
questions. He had to show her the spring outside and the little bench with basin and soap.
Sight of his soiled towel made her throw up her hands. She sat on the stools. She lay on the
couch. She rummaged into the contents of the cupboard. She threw wood on the fire. Then, finally,
having exhausted her search and inquiry, she flopped down on one of the stools to gaze at Glenn
in awe and admiration and incredulity.

"Glenn--you've actually lived here!" she ejaculated.

"Since last fall before the snow came," he said, smiling.

"Snow! Did it snow?" she inquired.

"Well, I guess. I was snowed in for a week."

"Why did you choose this lonely place--way off from the Lodge?" she asked, slowly.

"I wanted to be by myself," he replied, briefly.

"You mean this is a sort of camp-out place?"

"Carley, I call it my home," he replied, and there was a low, strong sweetness in his voice
she had never heard before.

That silenced her for a while. She went to the door and gazed up at the towering wall, more
wonderful than ever, and more fearful, too, in her sight. Presently tears dimmed her eyes.
She did not understand her feeling; she was ashamed of it; she hid it from Glenn. Indeed, there
was something terribly wrong between her and Glenn, and it was not in him. This cabin he called
home gave her a shock which would take time to analyze. At length she turned to him with gay
utterance upon her lips. She tried to put out of her mind a dawning sense that this close-to-the-earth
habitation, this primitive dwelling, held strange inscrutable power over a self she had never
divined she possessed. The very stones in the hearth seemed to call out from some remote past,
and the strong sweet smell of burnt wood thrilled to the marrow of her bones. How little she
knew of herself! But she had intelligence enough to understand that there was a woman in her,
the female of the species; and through that the sensations from logs and stones and earth and
fire had strange power to call up the emotions handed down to her from the ages. The thrill,
the queer heartbeat, the vague, haunting memory of something, as of a dim childhood adventure,
the strange prickling sense of dread--these abided with her and augmented while she tried to
show Glenn her pride in him and also how funny his cabin seemed to her.

Once or twice he hesitatingly, and somewhat appealingly, she imagined, tried to broach the
subject of his work there in the West. But Carley wanted a little while with him free of disagreeable
argument. It was a foregone conclusion that she would not like his work. Her intention at first
had been to begin at once to use all persuasion in her power toward having him go back East
with her, or at the latest some time this year. But the rude log cabin had checked her impulse.
She felt that haste would be unwise.

"Glenn Kilbourne, I told you why I came West to see you," she said, spiritedly. "Well, since
you still swear allegiance to your girl from the East, you might entertain her a little bit
before getting down to business talk."

"All right, Carley," he replied, laughing. "What do you want to do? The day is at your disposal.
I wish it were June. Then if you didn't fall in love with West Fork you'd be no good."

Scripture and in ancient writings, and furnishes a magazine of arms

DUTCH EAST INDIA COMPANY.--SLAVERY IN ENGLAND.

Having come across an old Daily Post of Thursday, August 4, 1720, I send you the following cuttings
from it, which perhaps you may think worth insertion:

"Hague, August 9.

"It was on the 5th that the first of our East-India ships appear'd off of the Texel, four of the ships
came to an anchor that evening, nine others kept out at sea till
day-light, and came up with the flood the next morning, and four more
came in this afternoon; but as they belong to the Chambers of Zealand,
and other towns, its thought they will stand away for the Maese.

This fleet is very rich, and including the single ship which arriv'd about a fortnight since, and
one still expected, are valued at near seven millions of guilders prime cost in the Indies, not
reckoning the freight or value at the sale, which may be suppos'd to make treble that sum."

"We
have an account from Flanders, that two ships more are come in to Ostend for the new East India
{99} Company there; it is said, these ships touch no where after they quit the coast of Malabar
till they come upon the coast of Guinea, where they put in for fresh water; and as for those which
come from China, they water on the bank of the Island of Ceylon, and again on the east shore
of Madagascar; but that none of them touch either at the Cape de bon Esperance, or at St. Helena,
not caring to venture falling into the hands of any of the Dutch or other nations trading to
the east. These ships they say are exceedingly rich, and the captains confirm the account
of the treaty which one of their former captains made with the Great Mogul, for the settling
a factory on his dominions, and that with very advantageous conditions;
what the particulars may be we yet know not."

"Went away the 22d of July last, from the house of William Webb in Limehouse Hole, a negro man, about
twenty years old, call'd Dick, yellow complection, wool hair, about five foot six inches high,
having on his right breast the word HARE burnt. Whoever brings him to the said Mr. Webb's
shall have half a guinea reward, and reasonable charges."

ORIGINAL ROYAL LETTERS TO THE GRAND MASTERS OF MALTA.

(Continued from Vol. viii., p. 558.)

I am now enabled to forward, according to my promise, literal translations,
so far as they could be made, of three more letters, which were written
in the Latin language, and addressed by Henry VIII. to the Grand Masters
of Malta.

The first two were directed to Philip de Villiers L'Isle Adam, and
the last to his successor Pierino Dupont, an Italian knight, who,
from his very advanced age, and consequent infirmity, was little disposed
to accept of the high dignity which his brethren of the Order of St.
John of Jerusalem had unanimously conferred upon him.

The life of Dupont was spared "long enough," not only for him to
take an active part in the expedition which Charles V. sent against
Tunis at his suggestion, to reinstate Muley Hassan on the throne of
that kingdom, but also to see his knights return to the convent covered
with glory, and galleys laden with plunder.

No. IV. Fol. 6th.

As he has declared to us that his most ardent wish is by our influence and favour to be in some
way invested with honour in his own country, we have most willingly
promised to do for him in this matter whatever lay in our power; and
we trust that from the good offices which your most worthy Reverence
has always received from us, this our desire with regard to promoting
the aforesaid Master Peter will be furthered, and the more readily
on this account, because what we beg for may be granted without injury
to any one.

Since, then, a certain Dominus Livius, concerning whom your Reverend
Lordship will be more fully informed by our same Secretary, is in
possession of a Priory in the Collegiate Church of SS.

John and Riparata in the city of Luca, we most earnestly desire that the said Livius, through
your Reverend Lordship's intercession, may resign the said Priory and Collegiate Church to our
said Latin Secretary, on this condition, however, that your Reverend
Lordship, as a special favour to us, will provide the said Dominus
Livius with a Commandery of equal or of greater value.

We therefore most earnestly entreat that you will have a care of
this matter, so that we may obtain the object of our wishes; and we
shall be greatly indebted to your Reverend Lordship, to whom, when
occasion offers, we will make a return for the twofold favour, in
a matter of like or of greater moment.

May all happiness attend you. From our palace of Greenwich, 13th day of January, 1526, Your
good friend, HENRY REX.

No. V. Fol. 9th. But that his Imperial Majesty has granted to your Order the island of Malta, Gozo,
and Tripoli, we cannot but rejoice; places which, as we hear, are most strongly fortified by
nature, and most excellently adapted for repelling the attacks of the Infidels, should have
now come into your hands, where your Order can assemble in all safety, recover its strength,
and settle and confirm its position.[5] And we wish to convince you that fresh increase is
daily made to the affection with which we have always cherished this Order of Jerusalem, inasmuch
as we perceive that your actions have been directed to a good and upright end, both because these
undertakings of your Reverend Lordship, and of your venerable Brethren, are approved by us as
highly beneficial and profitable; and because we trust that your favour and protection will
ever be ready to assist our nation, if there be any need; nor shall
we on our part be ever wanting in any friendly office which we can
perform towards preserving and protecting your Order, as your Reverend
Lordship will gather more at length of our well affected mind towards
you from Dominus Dentirville, the bearer of these presents.

May all happiness attend you. From our Palace at Hampton Court, The 22nd day of November, 1530.
Your good friend, HENRY REX.

Our most dear friend--Greeting:

We had conceived so great a hope and opinion of the probity, integrity,
and prudence of your predecessor, that, from his care and vigilance,
we securely trusted that the business and affairs of this your Order,
which hitherto has always wont to be of no slight assistance to our
most Holy Faith, and to the Christian name, would as far as was needful
have been amended and settled most quietly and effectually with God
and his Holy Religion.

From the love then and affection which we have hitherto shown in
no ordinary manner to your Order, for the sake of the propagation
of the Christian Faith, we were not a little grieved at the death
of your predecessor, because we very much feared that serious loss
would in consequence be entailed on that Religion.

But since, both from your letters and from the discourse of others, we now hear that your
venerable Brethren agreed by their unanimous voice and consent to choose your Reverence as
the {101} person to whom the care and government of so weighty an office should be intrusted, considering
this dignity to be especially worthy of you and your spirit of Religion,
we cannot but sincerely be glad; and rejoice especially if, by your
eminent virtues, it shall be effected that only such matters shall
be undertaken, and presided over by the strength and counsels of the
Order of Jerusalem, as are most in accordance with the True Religion
of Christ our Redeemer, and best adapted to the propagation of his
doctrine and Faith.

And if you shall seriously apply your mind to this, as you are especially bound to, we shall by no
means repent of the favours which we have bestowed neither seldom
nor secretly upon this your Order, nay rather this object shall be
attained that you shall have no reason to think that you have been
foiled in that your confidence, and in our protection and the guardianship
which we extend over your concerns through reverence for the Almighty
God.

And we shall not find that this guardianship and protection of your Order, assumed by us,
has been borne for so long a period by us without any fruit.

Those things which the Reverend Prior of our Kingdom, and the person who brought your Reverend
Lordship's letter to us, have listened to with attention and kindness, and returned an answer
to, as we doubt not will be intimated by them to your Reverend Lordship.

May

all happiness attend you. From our Palace at Westminster, The 17th day of November, 1534. HENRY
REX.

From the date and superscription of the above truly Catholic letter, it will be seen that it was
written about the period of the Reformation in England, and addressed to the Grand Master of an
Order, which for four centuries had been at all times engaged in Paynim war; and won for itself
among the Catholic powers of Europe, by its many noble and daring achievements, the style and
title of being the "bulwark of the Christian faith." Bound as the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem
were in all ages to pay a perfect obedience to the Roman Pontiffs, it is not surprising that
this should be the last letter which we have found filed away in the archives of their Order,
bearing the autograph of Henry VIII.

WILLIAM WINTHROP.

La Valetta, Malta.

When L'Isle Adam landed at Malta in October, 1530, it was with the rank of a monarch; and when,
in company with the authorities of the island, "he appeared before its capital, and swore to
protect its inhabitants, the gates of the old city were opened, and he was admitted with the knights;
the Maltese declaring to them their fealty, without prejudice to the interests of Charles
V., to whom they had heretofore been subject." Never, since the establishment of the Order, had
the affairs of the Hospitallers appeared more desperate than at this period. For the loss of Rhodes,
so famed in its history, so prized for its singular fertility, and rich and varied fruits; an island
which, as De Lamartine so beautifully expressed it, appeared to rise "like a bouquet of verdure
out of the bosom of the sea," with its groves of orange trees, its sycamores and palms; what
had L'Isle Adam received in return, but an arid African rock, without
palaces or dwellings, without fortifications or inland streams, and
which, were it not for its harbours, would have been as difficult
to hold as it would have been unworthy of his acceptance.

(Vertot.)

A person who has never been at Malta can, by reading its history, hardly picture to himself the change
which the island underwent for the better, under the long and happy rule of the Order of St.
John. Look whither one will, at this day, he sees some of the most perfect fortresses in the world,--fortifications
which it took millions of money to erect; and two hundred and fifty years of continual toil
and labour, before the work on them was finished. As a ship of war now enters the great harbour,
she passes immediately under the splendid castles of St. Elmo, Ricasoli, and St. Angelo. Going
to her anchorage, she "comes to" under some one of the extensive fortifications of the Borgo,
La Sangle, Burmola, Cotonera, and La Valetta. In all directions, and at all times, she is entirely
commanded by a line of walls, which are bristling with cannon above her. Should the more humble
merchantman be entering the small port of Marsamuscetto, to perform her quarantine, she also is
sailing under St. Elmo and Florianna on the one side, and forts Tigné
and Manoel on the other; from the cannon of which there is no escape.

But besides these numerous fortifications, the whole coast of the
island is protected by forts and batteries, towers and redoubts.

We name those of the Red Tower, the Melleha, St. Paul, St. Julien, Marsa Sirocco, and St. Thomas;
only to show how thoroughly the knights had guarded their convent, and how totally different the
protection of the Maltese was under their rule, from what it was
when they first landed; and found them with their inconsiderable fort,
with one cannon and two falconets, which, as Boisgelin has mentioned,
was their only defence.]

ENAREANS.

When Psammeticus turned back the conquering Scythians from their contemplated
invasion of Egypt, some stragglers of the rear-guard plundered the
temple of Venus Urania at Ascalon.

The goddess punished this sacrilege by inflicting on the Scythian
nation the "female disease."

Herodotus, from whom we learn this, says:

"The Scythians themselves confess that their countrymen suffer this malady in consequence of
the above crime; their condition also may be seen by those who visit Scythia, where they are called
Enareæ."--Beloe's Translation, vol. i. p. 112., ed. 8vo.

And again, vol. ii. p. 261., Hippocrates says:

"There are likewise among the Scythians, persons who come into the world as eunuchs, and do all
the work of women; they are called Enaræans, or womanish," &c.

It would occupy too much space to detail here all the speculations
to which this passage has given rise; sufficient for us be the fact,
that in Scythia there were men who dressed as, and associated with,
the women; that they were considered as victims of an offended female
deity; and yet, strange contradiction! they were revered as prophets
or diviners, and even acquired wealth by their predictions, &c. (See
Universal History, xx. p. 15., ed.

8vo.)

The curse still hangs over the descendants of the Scythians. Reineggo found the "female disease"
among the Nogay Tatars, who call persons so afflicted "Choss." In 1797-8, Count Potocki saw
one of them. The Turks apply the same term to men wanting a beard. (See Klaproth's Georgia and
Caucasus, p. 160., ed. 4to.) From the Turkish use of the word "choss," we may infer that Enareans
existed in the cradle of their race, and that the meaning only had suffered a slight modification
on their descent from the Altai.

De Pauw, in his Recherches sur les Américains, without quoting any
authority, says there are men in Mogulistan, who dress as women, but
are obliged to wear a man's turban.

It must be interesting to the ethnologist to find this curse extending
into the New World, and actually now existing amongst Dr. Latham's
American Mongolidæ.

It would be doubly interesting could we trace its course from ancient
Scythia to the Atlantic coast.

In this attempt, however, we have not been successful, a few isolated
facts only presenting themselves as probably descending from the same
source.

The relations of travellers in Eastern Asia offer nothing of the sort among the Tungusi, Yakuti,
&c. The two Mahometans (A.D. 833, thereabout), speaking of Chinese
depravity, assert that it is somehow connected with the worship of
their idols, &c. (Harris' Collection, p. 443. ed. fol.) Sauer mentions
boys dressed as females, and performing all the domestic duties in
common with the women, among the Kodiaks; and crossing to the American
coast, found the same practised by the inhabitants of Oonalashka (ed.

4to., pp. 160. 176.). More accurate observation might probably detect its existence amongst
intermediate tribes, but want {102} of information obliges us here
to jump at once over the whole range of the Rocky Mountains, and then
we find Enareanism (if I may so term it) extending from Canada to
Florida inclusive, and thence at intervals to the Straits of Magellan.

 To be sure, Flo had approved of Carley's choice, and Mr. Hutter,
with a hearty laugh, had fallen in line: "Shore. Let her ride one of the broncs, if she wants."
So this animal she bestrode must have been a bronc, for it did not take him long to elicit
from Carley a muttered, "I don't know what bronc means, but it sounds like this pony acts."

Carley had inquired the animal's name from the young herder who had saddled him for her.

"Wal, I reckon he ain't got much of a name," replied the lad, with a grin, as he scratched
his head. "For us boys always called him Spillbeans."

"Humph! What a beautiful cognomen!" ejaculated Carley, "But according to Shakespeare any name
will serve. I'll ride him or--or--"

So far there had not really been any necessity for the completion of that sentence. But five
miles of riding up into the cedar forest had convinced Carley that she might not have much
farther to go. Spillbeans had ambled along well enough until he reached level ground where
a long bleached grass waved in the wind. Here he manifested hunger, then a contrary nature,
next insubordination, and finally direct hostility. Carley had urged, pulled, and commanded
in vain. Then when she gave Spillbeans a kick in the flank he jumped stiff legged, propelling
her up out of the saddle, and while she was descending he made the queer jump again, coming
up to meet her. The jolt she got seemed to dislocate every bone in her body. Likewise it hurt.
Moreover, along with her idea of what a spectacle she must have presented, it quickly decided
Carley that Spillbeans was a horse that was not to be opposed. Whenever he wanted a mouthful
of grass he stopped to get it. Therefore Carley was always in the rear, a fact which in itself
did not displease her. Despite his contrariness, however, Spillbeans had apparently no intention
of allowing the other horses to get completely out of sight.

Several times Flo waited for Carley to catch up. "He's loafing on you, Carley. You ought to
have on a spur. Break off a switch and beat him some." Then she whipped the mustang across
the flank with her bridle rein, which punishment caused Spillbeans meekly to trot on with alacrity.
Carley had a positive belief that he would not do it for her. And after Flo's repeated efforts,
assisted by chastisement from Glenn, had kept Spillbeans in a trot for a couple of miles Carley
began to discover that the trotting of a horse was the most uncomfortable motion possible to
imagine. It grew worse. It became painful. It gradually got unendurable. But pride made Carley
endure it until suddenly she thought she had been stabbed in the side. This strange piercing
pain must be what Glenn had called a "stitch" in the side, something common to novices on horseback.
Carley could have screamed. She pulled the mustang to a walk and sagged in her saddle until
the pain subsided. What a blessed relief! Carley had keen sense of the difference between riding
in Central Park and in Arizona. She regretted her choice of horses. Spillbeans was attractive
to look at, but the pleasure of riding him was a delusion. Flo had said his gait resembled
the motion of a rocking chair. This Western girl, according to Charley, the sheep herder, was
not above playing Arizona jokes. Be that as it might, Spillbeans now manifested a desire to
remain with the other horses, and he broke out of a walk into a trot. Carley could not keep
him from trotting. Hence her state soon wore into acute distress.

Her left ankle seemed broken. The stirrup was heavy, and as soon as she was tired she could
no longer keep its weight from drawing her foot in. The inside of her right knee was as sore
as a boil. Besides, she had other pains, just as severe, and she stood momentarily in mortal
dread of that terrible stitch in her side. If it returned she knew she would fall off. But,
fortunately, just when she was growing weak and dizzy, the horses ahead slowed to a walk on
a descent. The road wound down into a wide deep canyon. Carley had a respite from her severest
pains. Never before had she known what it meant to be so grateful for relief from anything.

The afternoon grew far advanced and the sunset was hazily shrouded in gray. Hutter did not
like the looks of those clouds. "Reckon we're in for weather," he said. Carley did not care
what happened. Weather or anything else that might make it possible to get off her horse! Glenn
rode beside her, inquiring solicitously as to her pleasure. "Ride of my life!" she lied heroically.
And it helped some to see that she both fooled and pleased him.

Beyond the canyon the cedared desert heaved higher and changed its aspect. The trees grew larger,
bushier, greener, and closer together, with patches of bleached grass between, and russet-lichened
rocks everywhere. Small cactus plants bristled sparsely in open places; and here and there
bright red flowers--Indian paintbrush, Flo called them--added a touch of color to the gray.
Glenn pointed to where dark banks of cloud had massed around the mountain peaks. The scene
to the west was somber and compelling.

At last the men and the pack-horses ahead came to a halt in a level green forestland with no
high trees. Far ahead a chain of soft gray round hills led up to the dark heaved mass of mountains.
Carley saw the gleam of water through the trees. Probably her mustang saw or scented it, because
he started to trot. Carley had reached a limit of strength, endurance, and patience. She hauled
him up short. When Spillbeans evinced a stubborn intention to go on Carley gave him a kick.
Then it happened.

She felt the reins jerked out of her hands and the saddle propel her upward. When she descended
it was to meet that before-experienced jolt.

"Look!" cried Flo. "That bronc is going to pitch."

"Hold on, Carley!" yelled Glenn.

Desperately Carley essayed to do just that. But Spillbeans jolted her out of the saddle. She
came down on his rump and began to slide back and down. Frightened and furious, Carley tried
to hang to the saddle with her hands and to squeeze the mustang with her knees. But another
jolt broke her hold, and then, helpless and bewildered, with her heart in her throat and a
terrible sensation of weakness, she slid back at each upheave of the muscular rump until she
slid off and to the ground in a heap. Whereupon Spillbeans trotted off toward the water.

Carley sat up before Glenn and Flo reached her. Manifestly they were concerned about her, but
both were ready to burst with laughter. Carley knew she was not hurt and she was so glad to
be off the mustang that, on the moment, she could almost have laughed herself.

"That beast is well named," she said. "He spilled me, all right. And I presume I resembled
a sack of beans."

"Carley--you're--not hurt?" asked Glenn, choking, as he helped her up.

"Not physically. But my feelings are."

Then Glenn let out a hearty howl of mirth, which was seconded by a loud guffaw from Hutter.
Flo, however, appeared to be able to restrain whatever she felt. To Carley she looked queer.

"Pitch! You called it that," said Carley.

"Oh, he didn't really pitch. He just humped up a few times," replied Flo, and then when she
saw how Carley was going to take it she burst into a merry peal of laughter. Charley, the sheep
herder was grinning, and some of the other men turned away with shaking shoulders.

"Laugh, you wild and woolly Westerners!" ejaculated Carley. "It must have been funny. I hope
I can be a good sport.... But I bet you I ride him tomorrow."

"Shore you will," replied Flo.

Evidently the little incident drew the party closer together. Carley felt a warmth of good
nature that overcame her first feeling of humiliation. They expected such things from her,
and she should expect them, too, and take them, if not fearlessly or painlessly, at least without
resentment.

Carley walked about to ease her swollen and sore joints, and while doing so she took stock
of the camp ground and what was going on. At second glance the place had a certain attraction
difficult for her to define. She could see far, and the view north toward those strange gray-colored
symmetrical hills was one that fascinated while it repelled her. Near at hand the ground sloped
down to a large rock-bound lake, perhaps a mile in circumference. In the distance, along the
shore she saw a white conical tent, and blue smoke, and moving gray objects she took for sheep.

The men unpacked and unsaddled the horses, and, hobbling their forefeet together, turned them
loose. Twilight had fallen and each man appeared to be briskly set upon his own task. Glenn
was cutting around the foot of a thickly branched cedar where, he told Carley, he would make
a bed for her and Flo. All that Carley could see that could be used for such purpose was a
canvas-covered roll. Presently Glenn untied a rope from round this, unrolled it, and dragged
it under the cedar. Then he spread down the outer layer of canvas, disclosing a considerable
thickness of blankets. From under the top of these he pulled out two flat little pillows. These
he placed in position, and turned back some of the blankets.

"Carley, you crawl in here, pile the blankets up, and the tarp over them," directed Glenn.
"If it rains pull the tarp up over your head--and let it rain."

This direction sounded in Glenn's cheery voice a good deal more pleasurable than the possibilities
suggested. Surely that cedar tree could not keep off rain or snow.

"Glenn, how about--about animals--and crawling things, you know?" queried Carley.

"Oh, there are a few tarantulas and centipedes, and sometimes a scorpion. But these don't crawl
around much at night. The only thing to worry about are the hydrophobia skunks."

"What on earth are they?" asked Carley, quite aghast.

"Skunks are polecats, you know," replied Glenn, cheerfully. "Sometimes one gets bitten by a
coyote that has rabies, and then he's a dangerous customer. He has no fear and he may run across
you and bite you in the face. Queer how they generally bite your nose. Two men have been bitten
since I've been here. One of them died, and the other had to go to the Pasteur Institute with
a well-developed case of hydrophobia."

"Good heavens!" cried Carley, horrified.

"You needn't be afraid," said Glenn. "I'll tie one of the dogs near your bed."

Carley wondered whether Glenn's casual, easy tone had been adopted for her benefit or was merely
an assimilation from this Western life. Not improbably Glenn himself might be capable of playing
a trick on her. Carley endeavored to fortify herself against disaster, so that when it befell
she might not be wholly ludicrous.

With the coming of twilight a cold, keen wind moaned through the cedars. Carley would have
hovered close to the fire even if she had not been too tired to exert herself. Despite her
aches, she did justice to the supper. It amazed her that appetite consumed her to the extent
of overcoming a distaste for this strong, coarse cooking. Before the meal ended darkness had
fallen, a windy raw darkness that enveloped heavily like a blanket. Presently Carley edged
closer to the fire, and there she stayed, alternately turning back and front to the welcome
heat. She seemingly roasted hands, face, and knees while her back froze. The wind blew the
smoke in all directions. When she groped around with blurred, smarting eyes to escape the hot
smoke, it followed her. The other members of the party sat comfortably on sacks or rocks, without
much notice of the smoke that so exasperated Carley. Twice Glenn insisted that she take a seat
he had fixed for her, but she preferred to stand and move around a little.

By and by the camp tasks of the men appeared to be ended, and all gathered near the fire to
lounge and smoke and talk. Glenn and Hutter engaged in interested conversation with two Mexicans,
evidently sheep herders. If the wind and cold had not made Carley so uncomfortable she might
have found the scene picturesque. How black the night! She could scarcely distinguish the sky
at all. The cedar branches swished in the wind, and from the gloom came a low sound of waves
lapping a rocky shore. Presently Glenn held up a hand.

"Listen, Carley!" he said.

Then she heard strange wild yelps, staccato, piercing, somehow infinitely lonely. They made
her shudder.

"Coyotes," said Glenn. "You'll come to love that chorus. Hear the dogs bark back."

Carley listened with interest, but she was inclined to doubt that she would ever become enamoured
of such wild cries.

"Do coyotes come near camp?" she queried.

"Shore. Sometimes they pull your pillow out from under your head," replied Flo, laconically.

Carley did not ask any more questions. Natural history was not her favorite study and she was
sure she could dispense with any first-hand knowledge of desert beasts. She thought, however,
she heard one of the men say, "Big varmint prowlin' round the sheep." To which Hutter replied,
"Reckon it was a bear." And Glenn said, "I saw his fresh track by the lake. Some bear!"

The heat from the fire made Carley so drowsy that she could scarcely hold up her head. She
longed for bed even if it was out there in the open. Presently Flo called her: "Come. Let's
walk a little before turning in."

So Carley permitted herself to be led to and fro down an open aisle between some cedars. The
far end of that aisle, dark, gloomy, with the bushy secretive cedars all around, caused Carley
apprehension she was ashamed to admit. Flo talked eloquently about the joys of camp life, and
how the harder any outdoor task was and the more endurance and pain it required, the more pride
and pleasure one had in remembering it. Carley was weighing the import of these words when
suddenly Flo clutched her arm. "What's that?" she whispered, tensely.

Carley stood stockstill. They had reached the furthermost end of that aisle, but had turned
to go back. The flare of the camp fire threw a wan light into the shadows before them. There
came a rustling in the brush, a snapping of twigs. Cold tremors chased up and down Carley's back.

"Shore it's a varmint, all right. Let's hurry," whispered Flo.

Carley needed no urging. It appeared that Flo was not going to run. She walked fast, peering
back over her shoulder, and, hanging to Carley's arm, she rounded a large cedar that had obstructed
some of the firelight. The gloom was not so thick here. And on the instant Carley espied a
low, moving object, somehow furry, and gray in color. She gasped. She could not speak. Her
heart gave a mighty throb and seemed to stop.

"What--do you see?" cried Flo, sharply, peering ahead. "Oh!... Come, Carley. Run!"

Flo's cry showed she must nearly be strangled with terror. But Carley was frozen in her tracks.
Her eyes were riveted upon the gray furry object. It stopped. Then it came faster. It magnified.
It was a huge beast. Carley had no control over mind, heart, voice, or muscle. Her legs gave
way. She was sinking. A terrible panic, icy, sickening, rending, possessed her whole body.

The huge gray thing came at her. Into the rushing of her ears broke thudding sounds. The thing
leaped up. A horrible petrifaction suddenly made stone of Carley. Then she saw a gray mantlelike
object cast aside to disclose the dark form of a man. Glenn!

"Carley, dog-gone it! You don't scare worth a cent," he laughingly complained.

She collapsed into his arms. The liberating shock was as great as had been her terror. She
began to tremble violently. Her hands got back a sense of strength to clutch. Heart and blood
seemed released from that ice-banded vise.

"Say, I believe you were scared," went on Glenn, bending over her.

"Scar-ed!" she gasped. "Oh--there's no word--to tell--what I was!"

Flo came running back, giggling with joy. "Glenn, she shore took you for a bear. Why, I felt
her go stiff as a post!... Ha! Ha! Ha! Carley, now how do you like the wild and woolly?"

"Oh! You put up a trick on me!" ejaculated Carley. "Glenn, how could you? ... Such a terrible
trick! I wouldn't have minded something reasonable. But that! Oh, I'll never forgive you!"

Glenn showed remorse, and kissed her before Flo in a way that made some little amends. "Maybe
I overdid it," he said. "But I thought you'd have a momentary start, you know, enough to make
you yell, and then you'd see through it. I only had a sheepskin over my shoulders as I crawled
on hands and knees."

"Glenn, for me you were a prehistoric monster--a dinosaur, or something," replied Carley.

It developed, upon their return to the campfire circle, that everybody had been in the joke;
and they all derived hearty enjoyment from it.

"Reckon that makes you one of us," said Hutter, genially. "We've all had our scares."

Carley wondered if she were not so constituted that such trickery alienated her. Deep in her
heart she resented being made to show her cowardice. But then she realized that no one had
really seen any evidence of her state. It was fun to them.

Soon after this incident Hutter sounded what he called the roll-call for bed. Following Flo's
instructions, Carley sat on their bed, pulled off her boots, folded coat and sweater at her
head, and slid down under the blankets. How strange and hard a bed! Yet Carley had the most
delicious sense of relief and rest she had ever experienced. She straightened out on her back
with a feeling that she had never before appreciated the luxury of lying down.

Flo cuddled up to her in quite sisterly fashion, saying: "Now don't cover your head. If it
rains I'll wake and pull up the tarp. Good night, Carley." And almost immediately she seemed
to fall asleep.

For Carley, however, sleep did not soon come. She had too many aches; the aftermath of her
shock of fright abided with her; and the blackness of night, the cold whip of wind over her
face, and the unprotected helplessness she felt in this novel bed, were too entirely new and
disturbing to be overcome at once. So she lay wide eyed, staring at the dense gray shadow,
at the flickering lights upon the cedar. At length her mind formed a conclusion that this sort
of thing might be worth the hardship once in a lifetime, anyway. What a concession to Glenn's
West! In the secret seclusion of her mind she had to confess that if her vanity had not been
so assaulted and humiliated she might have enjoyed herself more. It seemed impossible, however,
to have thrills and pleasures and exaltations in the face of discomfort, privation, and an
uneasy half-acknowledged fear. No woman could have either a good or a profitable time when
she was at her worst. Carley thought she would not be averse to getting Flo Hutter to New York,
into an atmosphere wholly strange and difficult, and see how she met situation after situation
unfamiliar to her. And so Carley's mind drifted on until at last she succumbed to drowsiness.

A voice pierced her dreams of home, of warmth and comfort. Something sharp, cold, and fragrant
was scratching her eyes. She opened them. Glenn stood over her, pushing a sprig of cedar into
her face.

"Carley, the day is far spent," he said, gayly. "We want to roll up your bedding. Will you
get out of it?"

"Hello, Glenn! What time is it?" she replied.

"It's nearly six."

"What!... Do you expect me to get up at that ungodly hour?"

"We're all up. Flo's eating breakfast. It's going to be a bad day, I'm afraid. And we want
to get packed and moving before it starts to rain."

"Why do girls leave home?" she asked, tragically.

"To make poor devils happy, of course," he replied, smiling down upon her.

That smile made up to Carley for all the clamoring sensations of stiff, sore muscles. It made
her ashamed that she could not fling herself into this adventure with all her heart. Carley
essayed to sit up. "Oh, I'm afraid my anatomy has become disconnected!... Glenn, do I look
a sight?" She never would have asked him that if she had not known she could bear inspection
at such an inopportune moment.

"You look great," he asserted, heartily. "You've got color. And as for your hair--I like to
see it mussed that way. You were always one to have it dressed--just so.... Come, Carley, rustle
now."

Thus adjured, Carley did her best under adverse circumstances. And she was gritting her teeth
and complimenting herself when she arrived at the task of pulling on her boots. They were damp
and her feet appeared to have swollen. Moreover, her ankles were sore. But she accomplished
getting into them at the expense of much pain and sundry utterances more forcible than elegant.
Glenn brought her warm water, a mitigating circumstance. The morning was cold and thought of
that biting desert water had been trying.

"Shore you're doing fine," was Flo's greeting. "Come and get it before we throw it out."

Carley made haste to comply with the Western mandate, and was once again confronted with the
singular fact that appetite did not wait upon the troubles of a tenderfoot. Glenn remarked
that at least she would not starve to death on the trip.

"Come, climb the ridge with me," he invited. "I want you to take a look to the north and east."

He led her off through the cedars, up a slow red-earth slope, away from the lake. A green moundlike
eminence topped with flat red rock appeared near at hand and not at all a hard climb. Nevertheless,
her eyes deceived her, as she found to the cost of her breath. It was both far away and high.

"I like this location," said Glenn. "If I had the money I'd buy this section of land--six hundred
and forty acres--and make a ranch of it. Just under this bluff is a fine open flat bench for
a cabin. You could see away across the desert clear to Sunset Peak. There's a good spring of
granite water. I'd run water from the lake down into the lower flats, and I'd sure raise some
stock."

"What do you call this place?" asked Carley, curiously.

"Deep Lake. It's only a watering place for sheep and cattle. But there's fine grazing, and
it's a wonder to me no one has ever settled here."

Looking down, Carley appreciated his wish to own the place; and immediately there followed
in her a desire to get possession of this tract of land before anyone else discovered its advantages,
and to hold it for Glenn. But this would surely conflict with her intention of persuading Glenn
to go back East. As quickly as her impulse had been born it died.

Suddenly the scene gripped Carley. She looked from near to far, trying to grasp the illusive
something. Wild lonely Arizona land! She saw ragged dumpy cedars of gray and green, lines of
red earth, and a round space of water, gleaming pale under the lowering clouds; and in the
distance isolated hills, strangely curved, wandering away to a black uplift of earth obscured
in the sky.

These appeared to be mere steps leading her sight farther and higher to the cloud-navigated
sky, where rosy and golden effulgence betokened the sun and the east. Carley held her breath.
A transformation was going on before her eyes.

"Carley, it's a stormy sunrise," said Glenn.

His words explained, but they did not convince. Was this sudden-bursting glory only the sun
rising behind storm clouds? She could see the clouds moving while they were being colored.
The universal gray surrendered under some magic paint brush. The rifts widened, and the gloom
of the pale-gray world seemed to vanish. Beyond the billowy, rolling, creamy edges of clouds,
white and pink, shone the soft exquisite fresh blue sky. And a blaze of fire, a burst of molten
gold, sheered up from behind the rim of cloud and suddenly poured a sea of sunlight from east
to west. It trans-figured the round foothills. They seemed bathed in ethereal light, and the
silver mists that overhung them faded while Carley gazed, and a rosy flush crowned the symmetrical
domes. Southward along the horizon line, down-dropping veils of rain, just touched with the
sunrise tint, streamed in drifting slow movement from cloud to earth. To the north the range
of foothills lifted toward the majestic dome of Sunset Peak, a volcanic upheaval of red and
purple cinders, bare as rock, round as the lower hills, and wonderful in its color. Full in
the blaze of the rising sun it flaunted an unchangeable front. Carley understood now what had
been told her about this peak. Volcanic fires had thrown up a colossal mound of cinders burned
forever to the hues of the setting sun. In every light and shade of day it held true to its
name. Farther north rose the bold bulk of the San Francisco Peaks, that, half lost in the clouds,
still dominated the desert scene. Then as Carley gazed the rifts began to close. Another transformation
began, the reverse of what she watched. The golden radiance of sunrise vanished, and under
a gray, lowering, coalescing pall of cloud the round hills returned to their bleak somberness,
and the green desert took again its cold sheen.

"Wasn't it fine, Carley?" asked Glenn. "But nothing to what you will experience. I hope you
stay till the weather gets warm. I want you to see a summer dawn on the Painted Desert, and
a noon with the great white clouds rolling up from the horizon, and a sunset of massed purple
and gold. If they do not get you then I'll give up."

Carley murmured something of her appreciation of what she had just seen. Part of his remark
hung on her ear, thought-provoking and disturbing. He hoped she would stay until summer! That
was kind of him. But her visit must be short and she now intended it to end with his return
East with her. If she did not persuade him to go he might not want to go for a while, as he
had written--"just yet." Carley grew troubled in mind. Such mental disturbance, however, lasted
no longer than her return with Glenn to camp, where the mustang Spillbeans stood ready for
her to mount. He appeared to put one ear up, the other down, and to look at her with mild surprise,
as if to say: "What--hello--tenderfoot! Are you going to ride me again?"

Carley recalled that she had avowed she would ride him. There was no alternative, and her misgivings
only made matters worse. Nevertheless, once in the saddle, she imagined she had the hallucination
that to ride off so, with the long open miles ahead, was really thrilling. This remarkable
state of mind lasted until Spillbeans began to trot, and then another day of misery beckoned
to Carley with gray stretches of distance.

She was to learn that misery, as well as bliss, can swallow up the hours. She saw the monotony
of cedar trees, but with blurred eyes; she saw the ground clearly enough, for she was always
looking down, hoping for sandy places or rocky places where her mustang could not trot.

At noon the cavalcade ahead halted near a cabin and corral, which turned out to be a sheep
ranch belonging to Hutter. Here Glenn was so busy that he had no time to devote to Carley.
And Flo, who was more at home on a horse than on the ground, rode around everywhere with the
men. Most assuredly Carley could not pass by the chance to get off Spillbeans and to walk a
little. She found, however, that what she wanted most was to rest. The cabin was deserted,
a dark, damp place with a rank odor. She did not stay long inside.

Rain and snow began to fall, adding to what Carley felt to be a disagreeable prospect. The
immediate present, however, was cheered by a cup of hot soup and some bread and butter which
the herder Charley brought her. By and by Glenn and Hutter returned with Flo, and all partook
of some lunch.

All too soon Carley found herself astride the mustang again. Glenn helped her don the slicker,
an abominable sticky rubber coat that bundled her up and tangled her feet round the stirrups.
She was glad to find, though, that it served well indeed to protect her from raw wind and rain.

"Where do we go from here?" Carley inquired, ironically.

Glenn laughed in a way which proved to Carley that he knew perfectly well how she felt. Again
his smile caused her self-reproach. Plain indeed was it that he had really expected more of
her in the way of complaint and less of fortitude. Carley bit her lips.

Thus began the afternoon ride. As it advanced the sky grew more threatening, the wind rawer,
the cold keener, and the rain cut like little bits of sharp ice. It blew in Carley's face.
Enough snow fell to whiten the open patches of ground. In an hour Carley realized that she
had the hardest task of her life to ride to the end of the day's journey. No one could have
guessed her plight. Glenn complimented her upon her adaptation to such unpleasant conditions.
Flo evidently was on the lookout for the tenderfoot's troubles. But as Spillbeans, had taken
to lagging at a walk, Carley was enabled to conceal all outward sign of her woes. It rained,
hailed, sleeted, snowed, and grew colder all the time. Carley's feet became lumps of ice. Every
step the mustang took sent acute pains ramifying from bruised and raw places all over her body.

Once, finding herself behind the others and out of sight in the cedars, she got off to walk
awhile, leading the mustang. This would not do, however, because she fell too far in the rear.
Mounting again, she rode on, beginning to feel that nothing mattered, that this trip would
be the end of Carley Burch. How she hated that dreary, cold, flat land the road bisected without
end. It felt as if she rode hours to cover a mile. In open stretches she saw the whole party
straggling along, separated from one another, and each for himself. They certainly could not
be enjoying themselves. Carley shut her eyes, clutched the pommel of the saddle, trying to
support her weight. How could she endure another mile? Alas! there might be many miles. Suddenly
a terrible shock seemed to rack her. But it was only that Spillbeans had once again taken to
a trot. Frantically she pulled on the bridle. He was not to be thwarted. Opening her eyes,
she saw a cabin far ahead which probably was the destination for the night. Carley knew she
would never reach it, yet she clung on desperately. What she dreaded was the return of that
stablike pain in her side. It came, and life seemed something abject and monstrous. She rode
stiff legged, with her hands propping her stiffly above the pommel, but the stabbing pain went
right on, and in deeper. When the mustang halted his trot beside the other horses Carley was
in the last extremity. Yet as Glenn came to her, offering a hand, she still hid her agony.
Then Flo called out gayly: "Carley, you've done twenty-five miles on as rotten a day as I remember.
Shore we all hand it to you. And I'm confessing I didn't think you'd ever stay the ride out.
Spillbeans is the meanest nag we've got and he has the hardest gait."

CHAPTER V

Later Carley leaned back in a comfortable seat, before a blazing fire that happily sent its
acrid smoke up the chimney, pondering ideas in her mind.

There could be a relation to familiar things that was astounding in its revelation. To get
off a horse that had tortured her, to discover an almost insatiable appetite, to rest weary,
aching body before the genial warmth of a beautiful fire--these were experiences which Carley
found to have been hitherto unknown delights. It struck her suddenly and strangely that to
know the real truth about anything in life might require infinite experience and understanding.
How could one feel immense gratitude and relief, or the delight of satisfying acute hunger,
or the sweet comfort of rest, unless there had been circumstances of extreme contrast? She
had been compelled to suffer cruelly on horseback in order to make her appreciate how good
it was to get down on the ground. Otherwise she never would have known. She wondered, then,
how true that principle might be in all experience. It gave strong food for thought. There
were things in the world never before dreamed of in her philosophy.

Carley was wondering if she were narrow and dense to circumstances of life differing from her
own when a remark of Flo's gave pause to her reflections.

"Shore the worst is yet to come." Flo had drawled.

Carley wondered if this distressing statement had to do in some way with the rest of the trip.
She stifled her curiosity. Painful knowledge of that sort would come quickly enough.

"Flo, are you girls going to sleep here in the cabin?" inquired Glenn.

"Shore. It's cold and wet outside," replied Flo.

"Well, Felix, the Mexican herder, told me some Navajos had been bunking here."

"Navajos? You mean Indians?" interposed Carley, with interest.

"Shore do," said Flo. "I knew that. But don't mind Glenn. He's full of tricks, Carley. He'd
give us a hunch to lie out in the wet."

Hutter burst into his hearty laugh. "Wal, I'd rather get some things any day than a bad cold."

"Shore I've had both," replied Flo, in her easy drawl, "and I'd prefer the cold. But for Carley's
sake--"

"Pray don't consider me," said Carley. The rather crude drift of the conversation affronted her.

"Well, my dear," put in Glenn, "it's a bad night outside. We'll all make our beds here."

"Glenn, you shore are a nervy fellow," drawled Flo.

Long after everybody was in bed Carley lay awake in the blackness of the cabin, sensitively
fidgeting and quivering over imaginative contact with creeping things. The fire had died out.
A cold air passed through the room. On the roof pattered gusts of rain. Carley heard a rustling
of mice. It did not seem possible that she could keep awake, yet she strove to do so. But her
pangs of body, her extreme fatigue soon yielded to the quiet and rest of her bed, engendering
a drowsiness that proved irresistible.

Morning brought fair weather and sunshine, which helped to sustain Carley in her effort to
brave out her pains and woes. Another disagreeable day would have forced her to humiliating
defeat. Fortunately for her, the business of the men was concerned with the immediate neighborhood,
in which they expected to stay all morning.

"Flo, after a while persuade Carley to ride with you to the top of this first foothill," said
Glenn. "It's not far, and it's worth a good deal to see the Painted Desert from there. The
day is clear and the air free from dust."

"Shore. Leave it to me. I want to get out of camp, anyhow. That conceited hombre, Lee Stanton,
will be riding in here," answered Flo, laconically.

The slight knowing smile on Glenn's face and the grinning disbelief on Mr. Hutter's were facts
not lost upon Carley. And when Charley, the herder, deliberately winked at Carley, she conceived
the idea that Flo, like many women, only ran off to be pursued. In some manner Carley did not
seek to analyze, the purported advent of this Lee Stanton pleased her. But she did admit to
her consciousness that women, herself included, were both as deep and mysterious as the sea,
yet as transparent as an inch of crystal water.

It happened that the expected newcomer rode into camp before anyone left. Before he dismounted
he made a good impression on Carley, and as he stepped down in lazy, graceful action, a tall
lithe figure, she thought him singularly handsome. He wore black sombrero, flannel shirt, blue
jeans stuffed into high boots, and long, big-roweled spurs.

"How are you-all?" was his greeting.

From the talk that ensued between him and the men, Carley concluded that he must be overseer
of the sheep hands. Carley knew that Hutter and Glenn were not interested in cattle raising.
And in fact they were, especially Hutter, somewhat inimical to the dominance of the range land
by cattle barons of Flagstaff.

"When's Ryan goin' to dip?" asked Hutter.

"Today or tomorrow," replied Stanton.

"Reckon we ought to ride over," went on Hutter. "Say, Glenn, do you reckon Miss Carley could
stand a sheep-dip?"

This was spoken in a low tone, scarcely intended for Carley, but she had keen ears and heard
distinctly. Not improbably this sheep-dip was what Flo meant as the worst to come. Carley adopted
a listless posture to hide her keen desire to hear what Glenn would reply to Hutter.

"I should say not!" whispered Glenn, fiercely.

"Cut out that talk. She'll hear you and want to go."

Whereupon Carley felt mount in her breast an intense and rebellious determination to see a
sheep-dip. She would astonish Glenn. What did he want, anyway? Had she not withstood the torturing
trot of the hardest-gaited horse on the range? Carley realized she was going to place considerable
store upon that feat. It grew on her.

When the consultation of the men ended, Lee Stanton turned to Flo. And Carley did not need
to see the young man look twice to divine what ailed him. He was caught in the toils of love.
But seeing through Flo Hutter was entirely another matter.

"Howdy, Lee!" she said, coolly, with her clear eyes on him. A tiny frown knitted her brow.
She did not, at the moment, entirely approve of him.

"Shore am glad to see you, Flo," he said, with rather a heavy expulsion of breath. He wore
a cheerful grin that in no wise deceived Flo, or Carley either. The young man had a furtive
expression of eye.

"Ahuh!" returned Flo.

"I was shore sorry about--about that--" he floundered, in low voice.

"About what?"

"Aw, you know, Flo."

Carley strolled out of hearing, sure of two things--that she felt rather sorry for Stanton,
and that his course of love did not augur well for smooth running. What queer creatures were
women! Carley had seen several million coquettes, she believed; and assuredly Flo Hutter belonged
to the species.

Upon Carley's return to the cabin she found Stanton and Flo waiting for her to accompany them
on a ride up the foothill. She was so stiff and sore that she could hardly mount into the saddle;
and the first mile of riding was something like a nightmare. She lagged behind Flo and Stanton,
who apparently forgot her in their quarrel.

The riders soon struck the base of a long incline of rocky ground that led up to the slope
of the foothill. Here rocks and gravel gave place to black cinders out of which grew a scant
bleached grass. This desert verdure was what lent the soft gray shade to the foothill when
seen from a distance. The slope was gentle, so that the ascent did not entail any hardship.
Carley was amazed at the length of the slope, and also to see how high over the desert she
was getting. She felt lifted out of a monotonous level. A green-gray league-long cedar forest
extended down toward Oak Creek. Behind her the magnificent bulk of the mountains reached up
into the stormy clouds, showing white slopes of snow under the gray pall.

The hoofs of the horses sank in the cinders. A fine choking dust assailed Carley's nostrils.
Presently, when there appeared at least a third of the ascent still to be accomplished and
Flo dismounted to walk, leading their horses. Carley had no choice but to do likewise. At first
walking was a relief. Soon, however, the soft yielding cinders began to drag at her feet. At
every step she slipped back a few inches, a very annoying feature of climbing. When her legs
seemed to grow dead Carley paused for a little rest. The last of the ascent, over a few hundred
yards of looser cinders, taxed her remaining strength to the limit. She grew hot and wet and
out of breath. Her heart labored. An unreasonable antipathy seemed to attend her efforts. Only
her ridiculous vanity held her to this task. She wanted to please Glenn, but not so earnestly
that she would have kept on plodding up this ghastly bare mound of cinders. Carley did not
mind being a tenderfoot, but she hated the thought of these Westerners considering her a weakling.
So she bore the pain of raw blisters and the miserable sensation of staggering on under a leaden
weight.

Several times she noted that Flo and Stanton halted to face each other in rather heated argument.
At least Stanton's red face and forceful gestures attested to heat on his part. Flo evidently
was weary of argument, and in answer to a sharp reproach she retorted, "Shore I was different
after he came." To which Stanton responded by a quick passionate shrinking as if he had been stung.

Carley had her own reaction to this speech she could not help hearing; and inwardly, at least,
her feeling must have been similar to Stanton's. She forgot the object of this climb and looked
off to her right at the green level without really seeing it. A vague sadness weighed upon
her soul. Was there to be a tangle of fates here, a conflict of wills, a crossing of loves?
Flo's terse confession could not be taken lightly. Did she mean that she loved Glenn? Carley
began to fear it. Only another reason why she must persuade Glenn to go back East! But the
closer Carley came to what she divined must be an ordeal the more she dreaded it. This raw,
crude West might have confronted her with a situation beyond her control. And as she dragged
her weighted feet through the cinders, kicking, up little puffs of black dust, she felt what
she admitted to be an unreasonable resentment toward these Westerners and their barren, isolated,
and boundless world.

"Carley," called Flo, "come--looksee, as the Indians say. Here is Glenn's Painted Desert, and
I reckon it's shore worth seeing."

To Carley's surprise, she found herself upon the knob of the foothill. And when she looked
out across a suddenly distinguishable void she seemed struck by the immensity of something
she was unable to grasp. She dropped her bridle; she gazed slowly, as if drawn, hearing Flo's
voice.

"That thin green line of cottonwoods down there is the Little Colorado River," Flo was saying.
"Reckon it's sixty miles, all down hill. The Painted Desert begins there and also the Navajo
Reservation. You see the white strips, the red veins, the yellow bars, the black lines. They
are all desert steps leading up and up for miles. That sharp black peak is called Wildcat.
It's about a hundred miles. You see the desert stretching away to the right, growing dim--lost
in distance? We don't know that country. But that north country we know as landmarks, anyway.
Look at that saw-tooth range. The Indians call it Echo Cliffs. At the far end it drops off
into the Colorado River. Lee's Ferry is there--about one hundred and sixty miles. That ragged
black rent is the Grand Canyon. Looks like a thread, doesn't it? But Carley, it's some hole,
believe me. Away to the left you see the tremendous wall rising and turning to come this way.
That's the north wall of the Canyon. It ends at the great bluff--Greenland Point. See the black
fringe above the bar of gold. That's a belt of pine trees. It's about eighty miles across this
ragged old stone washboard of a desert. ... Now turn and look straight and strain your sight
over Wildcat. See the rim purple dome. You must look hard. I'm glad it's clear and the sun
is shining. We don't often get this view.... That purple dome is Navajo Mountain, two hundred
miles and more away!"

Carley yielded to some strange drawing power and slowly walked forward until she stood at the
extreme edge of the summit.

What was it that confounded her sight? Desert slope--down and down--color--distance--space!
The wind that blew in her face seemed to have the openness of the whole world back of it. Cold,
sweet, dry, exhilarating, it breathed of untainted vastness. Carley's memory pictures of the
Adirondacks faded into pastorals; her vaunted images of European scenery changed to operetta
settings. She had nothing with which to compare this illimitable space.

"Oh!--America!" was her unconscious tribute.

Stanton and Flo had come on to places beside her. The young man laughed. "Wal, now Miss Carley,
you couldn't say more. When I was in camp trainin' for service overseas I used to remember
how this looked. An' it seemed one of the things I was goin' to fight for. Reckon I didn't
the idea of the Germans havin' my Painted Desert. I didn't get across to fight for it, but
I shore was willin'."

"You see, Carley, this is our America," said Flo, softly.

Carley had never understood the meaning of the word. The immensity of the West seemed flung
at her. What her vision beheld, so far-reaching and boundless, was only a dot on the map.

"Does any one live--out there?" she asked, with slow sweep of hand.

"A few white traders and some Indian tribes," replied Stanton. "But you can ride all day an'
next day an' never see a livin' soul."

What was the meaning of the gratification in his voice? Did Westerners court loneliness? Carley
wrenched her gaze from the desert void to look at her companions. Stanton's eyes were narrowed;
his expression had changed; lean and hard and still, his face resembled bronze. The careless
humor was gone, as was the heated flush of his quarrel with Flo. The girl, too, had subtly
changed, had responded to an influence that had subdued and softened her. She was mute; her
eyes held a light, comprehensive and all-embracing; she was beautiful then. For Carley, quick
to read emotion, caught a glimpse of a strong, steadfast soul that spiritualized the brown
freckled face.

Carley wheeled to gaze out and down into this incomprehensible abyss, and on to the far up-flung
heights, white and red and yellow, and so on to the wonderful mystic haze of distance. The
significance of Flo's designation of miles could not be grasped by Carley. She could not estimate
distance. But she did not need that to realize her perceptions were swallowed up by magnitude.
Hitherto the power of her eyes had been unknown. How splendid to see afar! She could see--yes--but
what did she see? Space first, annihilating space, dwarfing her preconceived images, and then
wondrous colors! What had she known of color? No wonder artists failed adequately and truly
to paint mountains, let alone the desert space. The toiling millions of the crowded cities
were ignorant of this terrible beauty and sublimity. Would it have helped them to see? But
just to breathe that untainted air, just to see once the boundless open of colored sand and
rock--to realize what the freedom of eagles meant would not that have helped anyone?

And with the thought there came to Carley's quickened and struggling mind a conception of freedom.
She had not yet watched eagles, but she now gazed out into their domain. What then must be
the effect of such environment on people whom it encompassed? The idea stunned Carley. Would
such people grow in proportion to the nature with which they were in conflict? Hereditary influence
could not be comparable to such environment in the shaping of character.

"Shore I could stand here all day," said Flo. "But it's beginning to cloud over and this high
wind is cold. So we'd better go, Carley."

"I don't know what I am, but it's not cold," replied Carley.

"Wal, Miss Carley, I reckon you'll have to come again an' again before you get a comfortable
feelin' here," said Stanton.

It surprised Carley to see that this young Westerner had hit upon the truth. He understood
her. Indeed she was uncomfortable. She was oppressed, vaguely unhappy. But why? The thing there--the
infinitude of open sand and rock--was beautiful, wonderful, even glorious. She looked again.

Steep black-cindered slope, with its soft gray patches of grass, sheered down and down, and
out in rolling slope to merge upon a cedar-dotted level. Nothing moved below, but a red-tailed
hawk sailed across her vision. How still--how gray the desert floor as it reached away, losing
its black dots, and gaining bronze spots of stone! By plain and prairie it fell away, each
inch of gray in her sight magnifying into its league-long roll. On and on, and down across
dark lines that were steppes, and at last blocked and changed by the meandering green thread
which was the verdure of a desert river. Beyond stretched the white sand, where whirlwinds
of dust sent aloft their funnel-shaped spouts; and it led up to the horizon-wide ribs and ridges
of red and walls of yellow and mountains of black, to the dim mound of purple so ethereal and
mystic against the deep-blue cloud-curtained band of sky.

And on the moment the sun was obscured and that world of colorful flame went out, as if a blaze
had died.

Deprived of its fire, the desert seemed to retreat, to fade coldly and gloomily, to lose its
great landmarks in dim obscurity. Closer, around to the north, the canyon country yawned with
innumerable gray jaws, ragged and hard, and the riven earth took on a different character.
It had no shadows. It grew flat and, like the sea, seemed to mirror the vast gray cloud expanse.
The sublime vanished, but the desolate remained. No warmth--no movement--no life! Dead stone
it was, cut into a million ruts by ruthless ages. Carley felt that she was gazing down into chaos.

At this moment, as before, a hawk had crossed her vision, so now a raven sailed by, black as
coal, uttering a hoarse croak.

"Quoth the raven--" murmured Carley, with a half-bitter laugh, as she turned away shuddering
in spite of an effort of self-control. "Maybe he meant this wonderful and terrible West is
never for such as I.... Come, let us go."

Carley rode all that afternoon in the rear of the caravan, gradually succumbing to the cold
raw wind and the aches and pains to which she had subjected her flesh. Nevertheless, she finished
the day's journey, and, sorely as she needed Glenn's kindly hand, she got off her horse without
aid.

Camp was made at the edge of the devastated timber zone that Carley had found so dispiriting.
A few melancholy pines were standing, and everywhere, as far as she could see southward, were
blackened fallen trees and stumps. It was a dreary scene. The few cattle grazing on the bleached
grass appeared as melancholy as the pines. The sun shone fitfully at sunset, and then sank,
leaving the land to twilight and shadows.

Once in a comfortable seat beside the camp fire, Carley had no further desire to move. She
was so far exhausted and weary that she could no longer appreciate the blessing of rest. Appetite,
too, failed her this meal time. Darkness soon settled down. The wind moaned through the pines.
She was indeed glad to crawl into bed, and not even the thought of skunks could keep her awake.

Morning disclosed the fact that gray clouds had been blown away. The sun shone bright upon
a white-frosted land. The air was still. Carley labored at her task of rising, and brushing
her hair, and pulling on her boots; and it appeared her former sufferings were as naught compared
with the pangs of this morning. How she hated the cold, the bleak, denuded forest land, the
emptiness, the roughness, the crudeness! If this sort of feeling grew any worse she thought
she would hate Glenn. Yet she was nonetheless set upon going on, and seeing the sheep-dip,
and riding that fiendish mustang until the trip was ended.

Getting in the saddle and on the way this morning was an ordeal that made Carley actually sick.
Glenn and Flo both saw how it was with her, and they left her to herself. Carley was grateful
for this understanding. It seemed to proclaim their respect. She found further matter for satisfaction
in the astonishing circumstance that after the first dreadful quarter of an hour in the saddle
she began to feel easier. And at the end of several hours of riding she was not suffering any
particular pain, though she was weaker.

At length the cut-over land ended in a forest of straggling pines, through which the road wound
southward, and eventually down into a wide shallow canyon. Through the trees Carley saw a stream
of water, open fields of green, log fences and cabins, and blue smoke. She heard the chug of
a gasoline engine and the baa-baa of sheep. Glenn waited for her to catch up with him, and
he said: "Carley, this is one of Hutter's sheep camps. It's not a--a very pleasant place. You
won't care to see the sheep-dip. So I'm suggesting you wait here--"

"Nothing doing, Glenn," she interrupted. "I'm going to see what there is to see."

"But, dear--the men--the way they handle sheep--they'll--really it's no sight for you," he
floundered.

"Why not?" she inquired, eying him.

"Because, Carley--you know how you hate the--the seamy side of things. And the stench--why,
it'll make you sick!"

"Glenn, be on the level," she said. "Suppose it does. Wouldn't you think more of me if I could
stand it?"

"Why, yes," he replied, reluctantly, smiling at her, "I would. But I wanted to spare you. This
trip has been hard. I'm sure proud of you. And, Carley--you can overdo it. Spunk is not everything.
You simply couldn't stand this."

"Glenn, how little you know a woman!" she exclaimed. "Come along and show me your old sheep-dip."

They rode out of the woods into an open valley that might have been picturesque if it had not
been despoiled by the work of man. A log fence ran along the edge of open ground and a mud
dam held back a pool of stagnant water, slimy and green. As Carley rode on the baa-baa of sheep
became so loud that she could scarcely hear Glenn talking.

Several log cabins, rough hewn and gray with age, stood down inside the inclosure; and beyond
there were large corrals. From the other side of these corrals came sounds of rough voices
of men, a trampling of hoofs, heavy splashes, the beat of an engine, and the incessant baaing
of the sheep.

At this point the members of Hutter's party dismounted and tied their horses to the top log
of the fence. When Carley essayed to get off Glenn tried to stop her, saying she could see
well enough from there. But Carley got down and followed Flo. She heard Hutter call to Glenn:
"Say, Ryan is short of men. We'll lend a hand for a couple of hours."

Presently Carley reached Flo's side and the first corral that contained sheep. They formed
a compact woolly mass, rather white in color, with a tinge of pink. When Flo climbed up on
the fence the flock plunged as one animal and with a trampling roar ran to the far side of
the corral. Several old rams with wide curling horns faced around; and some of the ewes climbed
up on the densely packed mass. Carley rather enjoyed watching them. She surely could not see
anything amiss in this sight.

The next corral held a like number of sheep, and also several Mexicans who were evidently driving
them into a narrow lane that led farther down. Carley saw the heads of men above other corral
fences, and there was also a thick yellowish smoke rising from somewhere.

"Carley, are you game to see the dip?" asked Flo, with good nature that yet had a touch of
taunt in it.

"That's my middle name," retorted Carley, flippantly.

Both Glenn and this girl seemed to be bent upon bringing out Carley's worst side, and they
were succeeding. Flo laughed. The ready slang pleased her.

She led Carley along that log fence, through a huge open gate, and across a wide pen to another
fence, which she scaled. Carley followed her, not particularly overanxious to look ahead. Some
thick odor had begun to reach Carley's delicate nostrils. Flo led down a short lane and climbed
another fence, and sat astride the top log. Carley hurried along to clamber up to her side,
but stood erect with her feet on the second log of the fence.

Then a horrible stench struck Carley almost like a blow in the face, and before her confused
sight there appeared to be drifting smoke and active men and running sheep, all against a background
of mud. But at first it was the odor that caused Carley to close her eyes and press her knees
hard against the upper log to keep from reeling. Never in her life had such a sickening nausea
assailed her. It appeared to attack her whole body. The forerunning qualm of seasickness was
as nothing to this. Carley gave a gasp, pinched her nose between her fingers so she could not
smell, and opened her eyes.

Directly beneath her was a small pen open at one end into which sheep were being driven from
the larger corral. The drivers were yelling. The sheep in the rear plunged into those ahead
of them, forcing them on. Two men worked in this small pen. One was a brawny giant in undershirt
and overalls that appeared filthy. He held a cloth in his hand and strode toward the nearest
sheep. Folding the cloth round the neck of the sheep, he dragged it forward, with an ease which
showed great strength, and threw it into a pit that yawned at the side. Souse went the sheep
into a murky, muddy pool and disappeared. But suddenly its head came up and then its shoulders.
And it began half to walk and half swim down what appeared to be a narrow boxlike ditch that
contained other floundering sheep. Then Carley saw men on each side of this ditch bending over
with poles that had crooks at the end, and their work was to press and pull the sheep along
to the end of the ditch, and drive them up a boarded incline into another corral where many
other sheep huddled, now a dirty muddy color like the liquid into which they had been emersed.
Souse! Splash! In went sheep after sheep. Occasionally one did not go under. And then a man
would press it under with the crook and quickly lift its head. The work went on with precision
and speed, in spite of the yells and trampling and baa-baas, and the incessant action that
gave an effect of confusion.

Carley saw a pipe leading from a huge boiler to the ditch. The dark fluid was running out of
it. From a rusty old engine with big smokestack poured the strangling smoke. A man broke open
a sack of yellow powder and dumped it into the ditch. Then he poured an acid-like liquid after it.

"Sulphur and nicotine," yelled Flo up at Carley. "The dip's poison. If a sheep opens his mouth
he's usually a goner. But sometimes they save one."

Carley wanted to tear herself away from this disgusting spectacle. But it held her by some
fascination. She saw Glenn and Hutter fall in line with the other men, and work like beavers.
These two pacemakers in the small pen kept the sheep coming so fast that every worker below
had a task cut out for him. Suddenly Flo squealed and pointed.

"There! that sheep didn't come up," she cried. "Shore he opened his mouth."

Then Carley saw Glenn energetically plunge his hooked pole in and out and around until he had
located the submerged sheep. He lifted its head above the dip. The sheep showed no sign of
life. Down on his knees dropped Glenn, to reach the sheep with strong brown hands, and to haul
it up on the ground, where it flopped inert. Glenn pummeled it and pressed it, and worked on
it much as Carley had seen a life-guard work over a half-drowned man. But the sheep did not
respond to Glenn's active administrations.

"No use, Glenn," yelled Hutter, hoarsely. "That one's a goner."

Carley did not fail to note the state of Glenn's hands and arms and overalls when he returned
to the ditch work. Then back and forth Carley's gaze went from one end to the other of that
scene. And suddenly it was arrested and held by the huge fellow who handled the sheep so brutally.
Every time he dragged one and threw it into the pit he yelled: "Ho! Ho!" Carley was impelled
to look at his face, and she was amazed to meet the rawest and boldest stare from evil eyes
that had ever been her misfortune to incite. She felt herself stiffen with a shock that was
unfamiliar. This man was scarcely many years older than Glenn, yet he had grizzled hair, a
seamed and scarred visage, coarse, thick lips, and beetling brows, from under which peered
gleaming light eyes. At every turn he flashed them upon Carley's face, her neck, the swell
of her bosom. It was instinct that caused her hastily to close her riding coat. She felt as
if her flesh had been burned. Like a snake he fascinated her. The intelligence in his bold
gaze made the beastliness of it all the harder to endure, all the stronger to arouse.

"Come, Carley, let's rustle out of this stinkin' mess," cried Flo.

Indeed, Carley needed Flo's assistance in clambering down out of the choking smoke and horrid odor.

"Adios, pretty eyes," called the big man from the pen.

"Well," ejaculated Flo, when they got out, "I'll bet I call Glenn good and hard for letting
you go down there."

"It was--my--fault," panted Carley. "I said I'd stand it."

"Oh, you're game, all right. I didn't mean the dip.... That sheep-slinger is Haze Ruff, the
toughest hombre on this range. Shore, now, wouldn't I like to take a shot at him?... I'm going
to tell dad and Glenn."

"Please don't," returned Carley, appealingly.

"I shore am. Dad needs hands these days. That's why he's lenient. But Glenn will cowhide Ruff
and I want to see him do it."

In Flo Hutter then Carley saw another and a different spirit of the West, a violence unrestrained
and fierce that showed in the girl's even voice and in the piercing light of her eyes.

They went back to the horses, got their lunches from the saddlebags, and, finding comfortable
seats in a sunny, protected place, they ate and talked. Carley had to force herself to swallow.
It seemed that the horrid odor of dip and sheep had permeated everything. Glenn had known her
better than she had known herself, and he had wished to spare her an unnecessary and disgusting
experience. Yet so stubborn was Carley that she did not regret going through with it.

"Carley, I don't mind telling you that you've stuck it out better than any tenderfoot we ever
had here," said Flo.

"Thank you. That from a Western girl is a compliment I'll not soon forget," replied Carley.

"I shore mean it. We've had rotten weather. And to end the little trip at this sheep-dip hole!
Why, Glenn certainly wanted you to stack up against the real thing!"

"Flo, he did not want me to come on the trip, and especially here," protested Carley.

"Shore I know. But he let you."

"Neither Glenn nor any other man could prevent me from doing what I wanted to do."

"Well, if you'll excuse me," drawled Flo, "I'll differ with you. I reckon Glenn Kilbourne is
not the man you knew before the war."

"No, he is not. But that does not alter the case."

"Carley, we're not well acquainted," went on Flo, more carefully feeling her way, "and I'm
not your kind. I don't know your Eastern ways. But I know what the West does to a man. The
war ruined your friend--both his body and mind.... How sorry mother and I were for Glenn, those
days when it looked he'd sure 'go west,' for good!... Did you know he'd been gassed and that
he had five hemorrhages?"

"Oh! I knew his lungs had been weakened by gas. But he never told me about having hemorrhages."

"Well, he shore had them. The last one I'll never forget. Every time he'd cough it would fetch
the blood. I could tell!... Oh, it was awful. I begged him not to cough. He smiled--like a
ghost smiling--and he whispered, 'I'll quit.'... And he did. The doctor came from Flagstaff
and packed him in ice. Glenn sat propped up all night and never moved a muscle. Never coughed
again! And the bleeding stopped. After that we put him out on the porch where he could breathe
fresh air all the time. There's something wonderfully healing in Arizona air. It's from the
dry desert and here it's full of cedar and pine. Anyway Glenn got well. And I think the West
has cured his mind, too."

"Of what?" queried Carley, in an intense curiosity she could scarcely hide.

"Oh, God only knows!" exclaimed Flo, throwing up her gloved hands. "I never could understand.
But I hated what the war did to him."

Carley leaned back against the log, quite spent. Flo was unwittingly torturing her. Carley
wanted passionately to give in to jealousy of this Western girl, but she could not do it. Flo
Hutter deserved better than that. And Carley's baser nature seemed in conflict with all that
was noble in her. The victory did not yet go to either side. This was a bad hour for Carley.
Her strength had about played out, and her spirit was at low ebb.

"Carley, you're all in," declared Flo. "You needn't deny it. I'm shore you've made good with
me as a tenderfoot who stayed the limit. But there's no sense in your killing yourself, nor
in me letting you. So I'm going to tell dad we want to go home."

She left Carley there. The word home had struck strangely into Carley's mind and remained there.
Suddenly she realized what it was to be homesick. The comfort, the ease, the luxury, the rest,
the sweetness, the pleasure, the cleanliness, the gratification to eye and ear--to all the
senses--how these thoughts came to haunt her! All of Carley's will power had been needed to
sustain her on this trip to keep her from miserably failing. She had not failed. But contact
with the West had affronted, disgusted, shocked, and alienated her. In that moment she could
not be fair minded; she knew it; she did not care.

Carley gazed around her. Only one of the cabins was in sight from this position. Evidently
it was a home for some of these men. On one side the peaked rough roof had been built out beyond
the wall, evidently to serve as a kind of porch. On that wall hung the motliest assortment
of things Carley had ever seen--utensils, sheep and cow hides, saddles, harness, leather clothes,
ropes, old sombreros, shovels, stove pipe, and many other articles for which she could find
no name. The most striking characteristic manifest in this collection was that of service.
How they had been used! They had enabled people to live under primitive conditions. Somehow
this fact inhibited Carley's sense of repulsion at their rude and uncouth appearance. Had any
of her forefathers ever been pioneers? Carley did not know, but the thought was disturbing.
It was thought-provoking. Many times at home, when she was dressing for dinner, she had gazed
into the mirror at the graceful lines of her throat and arms, at the proud poise of her head,
at the alabaster whiteness of her skin, and wonderingly she had asked of her image: "Can it
be possible that I am a descendant of cavemen?" She had never been able to realize it, yet
she knew it was true. Perhaps somewhere not far back along her line there had been a great-great-grandmother
who had lived some kind of a primitive life, using such implements and necessaries as hung
on this cabin wall, and thereby helped some man to conquer the wilderness, to live in it, and
reproduce his kind. Like flashes Glenn's words came back to Carley--"Work and children!"

Some interpretation of his meaning and how it related to this hour held aloof from Carley.
If she would ever be big enough to understand it and broad enough to accept it the time was
far distant. Just now she was sore and sick physically, and therefore certainly not in a receptive
state of mind. Yet how could she have keener impressions than these she was receiving? It was
all a problem. She grew tired of thinking. But even then her mind pondered on, a stream of
consciousness over which she had no control. This dreary woods was deserted. No birds, no squirrels,
no creatures such as fancy anticipated! In another direction, across the canyon, she saw cattle,
gaunt, ragged, lumbering, and stolid. And on the moment the scent of sheep came on the breeze.
Time seemed to stand still here, and what Carley wanted most was for the hours and days to
fly, so that she would be home again.

At last Flo returned with the men. One quick glance at Glenn convinced Carley that Flo had
not yet told him about the sheep dipper, Haze Ruff.

"Carley, you're a real sport," declared Glenn, with the rare smile she loved. "It's a dreadful
mess. And to think you stood it!... Why, old Fifth Avenue, if you needed to make another hit
with me you've done it!"

His warmth amazed and pleased Carley. She could not quite understand why it would have made
any difference to him whether she had stood the ordeal or not. But then every day she seemed
to drift a little farther from a real understanding of her lover. His praise gladdened her,
and fortified her to face the rest of this ride back to Oak Creek.

Four hours later, in a twilight so shadowy that no one saw her distress, Carley half slipped
and half fell from her horse and managed somehow to mount the steps and enter the bright living
room. A cheerful red fire blazed on the hearth; Glenn's hound, Moze, trembled eagerly at sight
of her and looked up with humble dark eyes; the white-clothed dinner table steamed with savory
dishes. Flo stood before the blaze, warming her hands. Lee Stanton leaned against the mantel,
with eyes on her, and every line of his lean, hard face expressed his devotion to her. Hutter
was taking his seat at the head of the table. "Come an' get it--you-all," he called, heartily.
Mrs. Hutter's face beamed with the spirit of that home. And lastly, Carley saw Glenn waiting
for her, watching her come, true in this very moment to his stern hope for her and pride in
her, as she dragged her weary, spent body toward him and the bright fire.

By these signs, or the effect of them, Carley vaguely realized that she was incalculably changing,
that this Carley Burch had become a vastly bigger person in the sight of her friends, and strangely
in her own a lesser creature.

CHAPTER VI

If spring came at all to Oak Creek Canyon it warmed into summer before Carley had time to languish
with the fever characteristic of early June in the East.

As if by magic it seemed the green grass sprang up, the green buds opened into leaves, the
bluebells and primroses bloomed, the apple and peach blossoms burst exquisitely white and pink
against the blue sky. Oak Creek fell to a transparent, beautiful brook, leisurely eddying in
the stone walled nooks, hurrying with murmur and babble over the little falls. The mornings
broke clear and fragrantly cool, the noon hours seemed to lag under a hot sun, the nights fell
like dark mantles from the melancholy star-sown sky.

Carley had stubbornly kept on riding and climbing until she killed her secret doubt that she
was really a thoroughbred, until she satisfied her own insistent vanity that she could train
to a point where this outdoor life was not too much for her strength. She lost flesh despite
increase of appetite; she lost her pallor for a complexion of gold-brown she knew her Eastern
friends would admire; she wore out the blisters and aches and pains; she found herself growing
firmer of muscle, lither of line, deeper of chest. And in addition to these physical manifestations
there were subtle intimations of a delight in a freedom of body she had never before known,
of an exhilaration in action that made her hot and made her breathe, of a sloughing off of
numberless petty and fussy and luxurious little superficialities which she had supposed were
necessary to her happiness. What she had undertaken in vain conquest of Glenn's pride and Flo
Hutter's Western tolerance she had found to be a boomerang. She had won Glenn's admiration;
she had won the Western girl's recognition. But her passionate, stubborn desire had been ignoble,
and was proved so by the rebound of her achievement, coming home to her with a sweetness she
had not the courage to accept. She forced it from her. This West with its rawness, its ruggedness,
she hated.

Nevertheless, the June days passed, growing dreamily swift, growing more incomprehensibly full;
and still she had not broached to Glenn the main object of her visit--to take him back East.
Yet a little while longer! She hated his work and had not talked of that. Yet an honest consciousness
told her that as time flew by she feared more and more to tell him that he was wasting his
life there and that she could not bear it. Still was he wasting it? Once in a while a timid
and unfamiliar Carley Burch voiced a pregnant query. Perhaps what held Carley back most was
the happiness she achieved in her walks and rides with Glenn. She lingered because of them.
Every day she loved him more, and yet--there was something. Was it in her or in him? She had
a woman's assurance of his love and sometimes she caught her breath--so sweet and strong was
the tumultuous emotion it stirred. She preferred to enjoy while she could, to dream instead
of think. But it was not possible to hold a blank, dreamy, lulled consciousness all the time.
Thought would return. And not always could she drive away a feeling that Glenn would never
be her slave. She divined something in his mind that kept him gentle and kindly, restrained
always, sometimes melancholy and aloof, as if he were an impassive destiny waiting for the
iron consequences he knew inevitably must fall. What was this that he knew which she did not
know? The idea haunted her. Perhaps it was that which compelled her to use all her woman's
wiles and charms on Glenn. Still, though it thrilled her to see she made him love her more
as the days passed, she could not blind herself to the truth that no softness or allurement
of hers changed this strange restraint in him. How that baffled her! Was it resistance or knowledge
or nobility or doubt?

Flo Hutter's twentieth birthday came along the middle of June, and all the neighbors and range
hands for miles around were invited to celebrate it.

For the second time during her visit Carley put on the white gown that had made Flo gasp with
delight, and had stunned Mrs. Hutter, and had brought a reluctant compliment from Glenn. Carley
liked to create a sensation. What were exquisite and expensive gowns for, if not that?

It was twilight on this particular June night when she was ready to go downstairs, and she
tarried a while on the long porch. The evening star, so lonely and radiant, so cold and passionless
in the dusky blue, had become an object she waited for and watched, the same as she had come
to love the dreaming, murmuring melody of the waterfall. She lingered there. What had the sights
and sounds and smells of this wild canyon come to mean to her? She could not say. But they
had changed her immeasurably.

Her soft slippers made no sound on the porch, and as she turned the corner of the house, where
shadows hovered thick, she heard Lee Stanton's voice:

"But, Flo, you loved me before Kilbourne came."

The content, the pathos, of his voice chained Carley to the spot. Some situations, like fate,
were beyond resisting.

"Shore I did," replied Flo, dreamily. This was the voice of a girl who was being confronted
by happy and sad thoughts on her birthday.

"Don't you--love me--still?" he asked, huskily.

"Why, of course, Lee! I don't change," she said.

"But then, why--" There for the moment his utterance or courage failed.

"Lee, do you want the honest to God's truth?"

"I reckon--I do."

"Well, I love you just as I always did," replied Flo, earnestly. "But, Lee, I love him more
than you or anybody."

"My Heaven! Flo--you'll ruin us all!" he exclaimed, hoarsely.

"No, I won't either. You can't say I'm not level headed. I hated to tell you this, Lee, but
you made me."

"Flo, you love me an' him--two men?" queried Stanton, incredulously.

"I shore do," she drawled, with a soft laugh. "And it's no fun."

"Reckon I don't cut much of a figure alongside Kilbourne," said Stanton, disconsolately.

"Lee, you could stand alongside any man," replied Flo, eloquently. "You're Western, and you're
steady and loyal, and you'll--well, some day you'll be like dad. Could I say more?... But,
Lee, this man is different. He is wonderful. I can't explain it, but I feel it. He has been
through hell's fire. Oh! will I ever forget his ravings when he lay so ill? He means more to
me than just one man. He's American. You're American, too, Lee, and you trained to be a soldier,
and you would have made a grand one--if I know old Arizona. But you were not called to France....
Glenn Kilbourne went. God only knows what that means. But he went. And there's the difference.
I saw the wreck of him. I did a little to save his life and his mind. I wouldn't be an American
girl if I didn't love him.... Oh, Lee, can't you understand?"

"I reckon so. I'm not begrudging Glenn what--what you care. I'm only afraid I'll lose you."

"I never promised to marry you, did I?"

"Not in words. But kisses ought to--?"

"Yes, kisses mean a lot," she replied. "And so far I stand committed. I suppose I'll marry
you some day and be blamed lucky. I'll be happy, too--don't you overlook that hunch.... You
needn't worry. Glenn is in love with Carley. She's beautiful, rich--and of his class. How could
he ever see me?"

"Flo, you can never tell," replied Stanton, thoughtfully. "I didn't like her at first. But
I'm comin' round. The thing is, Flo, does she love him as you love him?"

"Oh, I think so--I hope so," answered Flo, as if in distress.

"I'm not so shore. But then I can't savvy her. Lord knows I hope so, too. If she doesn't--if
she goes back East an' leaves him here--I reckon my case--"

"Hush! I know she's out here to take him back. Let's go downstairs now."

"Aw, wait--Flo," he begged. "What's your hurry?... Come-give me--"

"There! That's all you get, birthday or no birthday," replied Flo, gayly.

Carley heard the soft kiss and Stanton's deep breath, and then footsteps as they walked away
in the gloom toward the stairway. Carley leaned against the log wall. She felt the rough wood--smelled
the rusty pine rosin. Her other hand pressed her bosom where her heart beat with unwonted vigor.
Footsteps and voices sounded beneath her. Twilight had deepened into night. The low murmur
of the waterfall and the babble of the brook floated to her strained ears.

Listeners never heard good of themselves. But Stanton's subtle doubt of any depth to her, though
it hurt, was not so conflicting as the ringing truth of Flo Hutter's love for Glenn. This unsought
knowledge powerfully affected Carley. She was forewarned and forearmed now. It saddened her,
yet did not lessen her confidence in her hold on Glenn. But it stirred to perplexing pitch
her curiosity in regard to the mystery that seemed to cling round Glenn's transformation of
character. This Western girl really knew more about Glenn than his fiancee knew. Carley suffered
a humiliating shock when she realized that she had been thinking of herself, of her love, her
life, her needs, her wants instead of Glenn's. It took no keen intelligence or insight into
human nature to see that Glenn needed her more than she needed him.

Thus unwontedly stirred and upset and flung back upon pride of herself, Carley went downstairs
to meet the assembled company. And never had she shown to greater contrast, never had circumstance
and state of mind contrived to make her so radiant and gay and unbending. She heard many remarks
not intended for her far-reaching ears. An old grizzled Westerner remarked to Hutter: "Wall,
she's shore an unbroke filly." Another of the company--a woman--remarked: "Sweet an' pretty
as a columbine. But I'd like her better if she was dressed decent." And a gaunt range rider,
who stood with others at the porch door, looking on, asked a comrade: "Do you reckon that's
style back East?" To which the other replied: "Mebbe, but I'd gamble they're short on silk
back East an' likewise sheriffs."

Carley received some meed of gratification out of the sensation she created, but she did not
carry her craving for it to the point of overshadowing Flo. On the contrary, she contrived
to have Flo share the attention she received. She taught Flo to dance the fox-trot and got
Glenn to dance with her. Then she taught it to Lee Stanton. And when Lee danced with Flo, to
the infinite wonder and delight of the onlookers, Carley experienced her first sincere enjoyment
of the evening.

Her moment came when she danced with Glenn. It reminded her of days long past and which she
wanted to return again. Despite war tramping and Western labors Glenn retained something of
his old grace and lightness. But just to dance with him was enough to swell her heart, and
for once she grew oblivious to the spectators.

"Glenn, would you like to go to the Plaza with me again, and dance between dinner courses,
as we used to?" she whispered up to him.

"Sure I would--unless Morrison knew you were to be there," he replied.

"Glenn!... I would not even see him."

"Any old time you wouldn't see Morrison!" he exclaimed, half mockingly.

His doubt, his tone grated upon her. Pressing closer to him, she said, "Come back and I'll
prove it."

But he laughed and had no answer for her. At her own daring words Carley's heart had leaped
to her lips. If he had responded, even teasingly, she could have burst out with her longing
to take him back. But silence inhibited her, and the moment passed.

At the end of that dance Hutter claimed Glenn in the interest of neighboring sheep men. And
Carley, crossing the big living room alone, passed close to one of the porch doors. Some one,
indistinct in the shadow, spoke to her in low voice: "Hello, pretty eyes!"

Carley felt a little cold shock go tingling through her. But she gave no sign that she had
heard. She recognized the voice and also the epithet. Passing to the other side of the room
and joining the company there, Carley presently took a casual glance at the door. Several men
were lounging there. One of them was the sheep dipper, Haze Ruff. His bold eyes were on her
now, and his coarse face wore a slight, meaning smile, as if he understood something about
her that was a secret to others. Carley dropped her eyes. But she could not shake off the feeling
that wherever she moved this man's gaze followed her. The unpleasantness of this incident would
have been nothing to Carley had she at once forgotten it. Most unaccountably, however, she
could not make herself unaware of this ruffian's attention. It did no good for her to argue
that she was merely the cynosure of all eyes. This Ruff's tone and look possessed something
heretofore unknown to Carley. Once she was tempted to tell Glenn. But that would only cause
a fight, so she kept her counsel. She danced again, and helped Flo entertain her guests, and
passed that door often; and once stood before it, deliberately, with all the strange and contrary
impulse so inscrutable in a woman, and never for a moment wholly lost the sense of the man's
boldness. It dawned upon her, at length, that the singular thing about this boldness was its
difference from any, which had ever before affronted her. The fool's smile meant that he thought
she saw his attention, and, understanding it perfectly, had secret delight in it. Many and
various had been the masculine egotisms which had come under her observation. But quite beyond
Carley was this brawny sheep dipper, Haze Ruff. Once the party broke up and the guests had
departed, she instantly forgot both man and incident.

Next day, late in the afternoon, when Carley came out on the porch, she was hailed by Flo,
who had just ridden in from down the canyon.

"Hey Carley, come down. I shore have something to tell you," she called.

Carley did not use any time pattering down that rude porch stairway. Flo was dusty and hot,
and her chaps carried the unmistakable scent of sheep-dip.

"Been over to Ryan's camp an' shore rode hard to beat Glenn home," drawled Flo.

"Why?" queried Carley, eagerly.

"Reckon I wanted to tell you something Glenn swore he wouldn't let me tell. ... He makes me
tired. He thinks you can't stand things."

"Oh! Has he been--hurt?"

"He's skinned an' bruised up some, but I reckon he's not hurt."

"Flo--what happened?" demanded Carley, anxiously.

"Carley, do you know Glenn can fight like the devil?" asked Flo.

"No, I don't. But I remember he used to be athletic. Flo, you make me nervous. Did Glenn fight?"

"I reckon he did," drawled Flo.

"With whom?"

"Nobody else but that big hombre, Haze Ruff."

"Oh!" gasped Carley, with a violent start. "That--that ruffian! Flo, did you see--were you there?"

"I shore was, an' next to a horse race I like a fight," replied the Western girl. "Carley,
why didn't you tell me Haze Ruff insulted you last night?"

"Why, Flo--he only said, 'Hello, pretty eyes,' and I let it pass!" said Carley, lamely.

"You never want to let anything pass, out West. Because next time you'll get worse. This turn
your other cheek doesn't go in Arizona. But we shore thought Ruff said worse than that. Though
from him that's aplenty."

"How did you know?"

"Well, Charley told it. He was standing out here by the door last night an' he heard Ruff speak
to you. Charley thinks a heap of you an' I reckon he hates Ruff. Besides, Charley stretches
things. He shore riled Glenn, an' I want to say, my dear, you missed the best thing that's
happened since you got here."

"Hurry--tell me," begged Carley, feeling the blood come to her face.

"I rode over to Ryan's place for dad, an' when I got there I knew nothing about what Ruff said
to you," began Flo, and she took hold of Carley's hand. "Neither did dad. You see, Glenn hadn't
got there yet. Well, just as the men had finished dipping a bunch of sheep Glenn came riding
down, lickety cut."

"'Now what the hell's wrong with Glenn?' said dad, getting up from where we sat.

"Shore I knew Glenn was mad, though I never before saw him that way. He looked sort of grim
an' black.... Well, he rode right down on us an' piled off. Dad yelled at him an' so did I.
But Glenn made for the sheep pen. You know where we watched Haze Ruff an' Lorenzo slinging
the sheep into the dip. Ruff was just about to climb out over the fence when Glenn leaped up
on it."

"'Say, Ruff,' he said, sort of hard, 'Charley an' Ben tell me they heard you speak disrespectfully
to Miss Burch last night.'"

"Dad an' I ran to the fence, but before we could catch hold of Glenn he'd jumped down into
the pen."

"'I'm not carin' much for what them herders say,' replied Ruff.

"'Do you deny it?' demanded Glenn.

"'I ain't denyin' nothin', Kilbourne,' growled Ruff. 'I might argue against me bein' disrespectful.
That's a matter of opinion.'

"'You'll apologize for speaking to Miss Burch or I'll beat you up an' have Hutter fire you.'

"'Wal, Kilbourne, I never eat my words,' replied Ruff.

"Then Glenn knocked him flat. You ought to have heard that crack. Sounded like Charley hitting
a steer with a club. Dad yelled: 'Look out, Glenn. He packs a gun!'--Ruff got up mad clear
through I reckon. Then they mixed it. Ruff got in some swings, but he couldn't reach Glenn's
face. An' Glenn batted him right an' left, every time in his ugly mug. Ruff got all bloody
an' he cussed something awful. Glenn beat him against the fence an' then we all saw Ruff reach
for a gun or knife. All the men yelled. An' shore I screamed. But Glenn saw as much as we saw.
He got fiercer. He beat Ruff down to his knees an' swung on him hard. Deliberately knocked
Ruff into the dip ditch. What a splash! It wet all of us. Ruff went out of sight. Then he rolled
up like a huge hog. We were all scared now. That dip's rank poison, you know. Reckon Ruff knew
that. He floundered along an' crawled up at the end. Anyone could see that he had mouth an'
eyes tight shut. He began to grope an' feel around, trying to find the way to the pond. One
of the men led him out. It was great to see him wade in the water an' wallow an' souse his
head under. When he came out the men got in front of him any stopped him. He shore looked bad....
An' Glenn called to him, 'Ruff, that sheep-dip won't go through your tough hide, but a bullet
will!"

Not long after this incident Carley started out on her usual afternoon ride, having arranged
with Glenn to meet her on his return from work.

Toward the end of June Carley had advanced in her horsemanship to a point where Flo lent her
one of her own mustangs. This change might not have had all to do with a wonderful difference
in riding, but it seemed so to Carley. There was as much difference in horses as in people.
This mustang she had ridden of late was of Navajo stock, but he had been born and raised and
broken at Oak Creek. Carley had not yet discovered any objection on his part to do as she wanted
him to. He liked what she liked, and most of all he liked to go. His color resembled a pattern
of calico, and in accordance with Western ways his name was therefore Calico. Left to choose
his own gait, Calico always dropped into a gentle pace which was so easy and comfortable and
swinging that Carley never tired of it. Moreover, he did not shy at things lying in the road
or rabbits darting from bushes or at the upwhirring of birds. Carley had grown attached to
Calico before she realized she was drifting into it; and for Carley to care for anything or
anybody was a serious matter, because it did not happen often and it lasted. She was exceedingly
tenacious of affection.

June had almost passed and summer lay upon the lonely land. Such perfect and wonderful weather
had never before been Carley's experience. The dawns broke cool, fresh, fragrant, sweet, and
rosy, with a breeze that seemed of heaven rather than earth, and the air seemed tremulously
full of the murmur of falling water and the melody of mocking birds. At the solemn noontides
the great white sun glared down hot--so hot that t burned the skin, yet strangely was a pleasant
burn. The waning afternoons were Carley's especial torment, when it seemed the sounds and winds
of the day were tiring, and all things were seeking repose, and life must soften to an unthinking
happiness. * * * * *

IVORY AND ITS APPLICATIONS.

The Chinese, from time immemorial, have been celebrated for their excellence in the fabrication
of ornamental articles in ivory; and, strange to say, up to our own time, their productions are
still unrivalled. European artists have never succeeded in cutting ivory after the manner
of these people, nor, to all appearance, is it likely they ever will. Nothing can be more exquisitely
beautiful than the delicate lacework of a Chinese fan, or the elaborate
carving of their miniature junks, chess-pieces, and concentric balls:
their models of temples, pagodas, and other pieces of architecture
are likewise skilfully constructed; and yet three thousand years ago
such monuments of art were executed with the very same grace and fidelity!

Ivory

was known to the Egyptians as an article both of use and ornament. They manufactured it into
combs, rings, and a variety of similar things. The processions on the walls of their palaces
and tombs would seem to indicate the fact of its having been obtained from India, and also
from Ethiopia or Central Africa. There is every reason to believe also that the harder and
more accessible ivory of the hippopotamus was extensively used by them. Colonel Hamilton Smith
has seen a specimen of what appeared to be a sword-handle of ancient
Egyptian workmanship, which has been recognised by dentists as belonging
to this class of ivory.

Ivory was extensively used by the Jews. It is frequently spoken of in Scripture as being obtained
from Tarshish--an indiscriminate term for various places in the lands of the Gentiles, but
probably referring in this case to some part of India or Eastern Africa. Wardrobes were made
of ivory, or at least inlaid with it; the splendid throne of Solomon was formed of this material,
overlaid with gold; Ahab built an ivory palace: and beds or couches of the same material were
common among the wealthy Israelites. The Phoenicians of Tyre--those merchant-princes of antiquity--were
so profuse of this valuable article of their luxurious commerce as to provide ivory benches for the
rowers of their galleys. Assyria--whose records and history are only now beginning to be unfolded--possessed
magnificent articles of ivory. Mr Layard, in his excavations at Nineveh, found 'in the rubbish
near the bottom of a chamber, several ivory ornaments upon which were traces of gilding: among
them was the figure of a man in long robes, carrying in one hand the Egyptian crux ansata--part of
a crouching sphinx--and flowers designed with great taste and elegance.'

The
Greeks--who were acquainted with it at least as early as the time
of Homer--gradually introduced ivory as a material for sculpture.

In certain forms of combination with gold, it gave origin to the art of chryselephantine sculpture,
so called from the Greek primitives, gold and ivory. This art, which was perhaps more luxurious
than tasteful, was introduced about six hundred years before the Christian era; and it was much
admired for its singular beauty. It was not, however, till the days
of Phidias that it attained to its full splendour.

Two of the masterpieces of this sculptor--the colossal statues of Minerva in the Parthenon
at Athens and the Olympian Jove in his temple--were formed of gold and ivory. The Minerva was
forty feet high, and the Olympian Jupiter was one of the wonders
of the world.

In the latter of these, the exposed parts of the figure were of ivory, and the drapery of
gold. It was seated on a throne elaborately formed of gold, ivory, and cedar-wood; it was
adorned with precious stones; and in his hand the god sustained an emblematic figure of Victory,
made of the same costly materials.

The Romans used ivory as a symbol of power; but they applied it practically to an infinite variety
of purposes.

Their kings and magistrates sat on ivory thrones of rich and elaborate construction--an idea
received from the Etruscans. The curule chairs of ivory and gold that belonged to the office
of consul, together with the sceptres and other articles of similar description, were all of
Etruscan origin. The libri elephantis were tablets of ivory, on which were registered the transactions
of the senate and magistrates; the births, marriages, and deaths of the people; their rank,
class, and occupation, with other things pertaining to the census. The Romans also applied this material
to the manufacture of musical instruments, combs, couches, harnesses
of horses, sword-hilts, girdles.

They were acquainted with the arts of dyeing and incrusting ivory, and they also possessed some
splendid specimens of chryselephantine statuary. Ancient writers, indeed, mention no fewer than
one hundred statues of gold and ivory; but they furnish us with no particulars of the mode of executing
these colossal monuments of art in a substance which could only be obtained in small pieces.
A head, smaller than the usual size, a statue about eight inches in height, and a bas-relief, are
the only specimens that exist in the present day.

After the fall of the Roman Empire, the taste for ivory ornament became almost extinct. There were some
periods, however, in the early part of mediæval history when this material was not forgotten:
when the caliphs of the East formed of it some of the beautiful ornaments of their palaces; when
the Arabian alchemists subjected it to the crucible, and so produced
the pigment ivory black; when a Danish knight killed an elephant in
the holy wars, and established an order of knighthood which still
exists; when Charlemagne, the emperor of the West, had ivory ornaments
of rare and curious carving.[3] It is, however, at a period subsequent
to the return of the crusaders that we must date the commencement
of a general revival of the taste in Europe.

It would be interesting to trace the steps by which ivory regained its place in the arts and commerce
of nations; but on this point we must not linger. From the low countries it spread to the
far North. Its relations with art and beauty soon became widely recognised; the growing luxury of
the Roman pontificate encouraged its applications; and towards the end of the fifteenth century
it was extensively employed as an article of ornament and decoration
in every country and court of Europe.

The Portuguese were the first to revive a traffic with Africa which had been dormant for upwards
of 1000 years. It was originally confined to the immense stores of ivory which the natives had
accumulated for the purposes of their superstition; but these soon became exhausted, and the
inexorable demands of European commerce once more prompted the destruction of the mighty and
docile inhabitant of the wilderness.

Elephant-hunting became a trade; and a terrible havoc was commenced, which has been unremittingly
pursued down to the present time.

The term ivory, originally derived from a Greek word signifying heavy, is indiscriminately applied
to the following varieties of osseous matter:--

1. The tusks and teeth of the elephant.--Naturalists recognise two species of elephants--the
Asiatic (Elephas Indicus) and the African (Elephas Africanus.) The
former of these species is indigenous to the whole of Southern India
and the Eastern Archipelago; but the largest and most valuable Indian
elephant is that of Ceylon.

The second species is found throughout the whole of Africa; and on the banks of the great rivers
and lakes of the unexplored regions of the interior, hordes of the
finest African elephants are supposed to wander in security.

It was until very recently believed that the Asiatic elephant yielded the largest teeth, and those
imported from Pegu, Cochin-China, and Ceylon, sometimes weighed 150
lbs.

Specimens, however, have been obtained from the interior of Africa
of much greater weight and dimensions.

Mr Gordon Cumming has in his collection a pair of teeth taken from an old bull elephant in
the vicinity of the equator, of which the larger of the two measures
10 feet 9 inches long, and weighs 173 lbs.; and Mr Cawood, who resided
thirty years at the Cape, has another pair in his possession measuring
8-1/2 feet each, and weighing together 330 lbs.

Besides these contemporary races of elephants, the market is extensively
supplied by the fossil ivory derived from the tusks of the great mammoth
or fossil elephant of the geologist.

The remains of this gigantic animal are abundantly distributed over
the whole extent of the globe.

They exist in large masses in the northern hemisphere, deeply embedded
in the alluvial deposits of the tertiary period.

Humboldt discovered specimens on some of the most elevated ridges of the Andes; and similar remains
have been found in Africa. In the frozen regions of the far North, surrounded by successive
layers of everlasting ice, the fossil ivory exists in a state of perfect preservation, and it
constitutes indeed an important article of commerce in the north
of Europe.

2. The teeth of the hippopotamus, or river-horse.--These, under the inappropriate term of 'sea-horse
teeth,' supply the most suitable ivory for the dentist. In addition to twenty grinders, the animal
has twelve front teeth, the outer on each side of the jaw being the
largest and most prized.

This ivory is much harder, closer in the grain, and more valuable
than that of the elephant.

It is remarkable, moreover, for the extreme hardness of its enamel, which is quite incapable of being
cut, and will strike fire with a steel instrument. The large teeth of the hippopotamus weigh
on the average 6 lbs., and the small ones about 1 lb. each.

Their value ranges from 6s. to 40s. per lb.

3. The teeth of the walrus, or sea-cow.--These are nearly straight, and measure from 2 feet
to 2-1/2 feet in length.

The exterior portion of the tooth possesses a much finer grain and
texture than its core, which in appearance and properties bears a
close resemblance to ordinary bone.

Of a yellowish cream-colour and mottled, this ivory is much less
valuable than the teeth of the hippopotamus.

It is seldom applied in our day to other than dental purposes; but
its antiquity is interesting.

The Scandinavian relics of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, with which our museums are so
profusely enriched, are for the most part formed of the teeth of
the walrus.

The elegant spiral horn of the narwhal or sea-unicorn also produces ivory of a superior quality.
It is not to any great extent applied to useful purposes, but is
more frequently preserved in museums and collections as a beautiful
natural curiosity.

The tusks and teeth of the elephant--the latter, for the sake of distinction, are termed grinders--are
formed after the ordinary manner of the teeth of animals.

The organism which converts the earthy constituents of the blood
into cellular tissue and membrane, contributes in the same way to
form the teeth by the successive deposition of layer upon layer of
the soft vascular pulp.

The marks of these depositions, or laminæ, are clearly distinguishable in the longitudinal striæ
of the section of a tooth.

Mr Corse Scott states that the Indian elephant has only ten or twelve
laminæ in the tooth, while that of the great mammoth has twenty-four,
besides having a much more regularly disposed enamel.

The tooth is hollow about half-way up, but a very small tubular cavity is visible throughout
its entire length. This, sometimes called the nerve, is in reality
the apex of successive formations in the process of growth.

The grinders are seldom used in the arts. They are of a different texture, the laminæ more
loosely combined, and possessing a tendency to separate, which renders
them unfit for nearly all useful purposes.

Ivory has the same chemical constitution as ordinary teeth--that is, cartilage united to such
earthy ingredients as the phosphate of lime.

But it is very remarkable that the fossil ivory of the mammoth, and specimens of the historic
period of Pompeii or Egypt, contain sometimes as much as 10 per cent. more of fluoride of calcium
than the ivory of the present day.

We apprehend, however, that this property--first investigated by Dr George Wilson--may be derived
from long-continued contact with earth, since fluoride of calcium
is the chief ingredient in the enamel or exterior portion of the tooth.

Ancient ivory, having thus gained in its inorganic bases, becomes
deficient in the gelatinous constituents necessary to its preservation.

We recently had a singularly beautiful application of the knowledge of this principle in the
case of the ivory specimens sent from Nineveh by Mr Layard.

On their arrival in England, it was discovered that they were rapidly crumbling to pieces. Professor
Owen recommended that the articles should be boiled in a solution
of albumen, which was done accordingly, and the ivory rendered as
firm and solid as when it was first entombed.

We may allude here to a very singular physical property which is possessed
by the elephant's tusk.

Specimens have frequently been obtained which were found to contain musket-bullets in their
centre, surrounded with a species of osseous pulp differing from
the ordinary character and constitution of ivory.

There was frequently no corresponding orifice on the surface of the
tusk; and hence Blumenbach, and other naturalists, were led to form
some very inaccurate notions regarding this circumstance.

Mr Rodgers of Sheffield some years ago forwarded a variety of such specimens to the Edinburgh
College Museum, and these were very closely examined by Professor
Goodsir, who, in a communication to the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
demonstrated that this arose simply from a property of isolating foreign
substances common to all osseous organised bodies: the ball having
been enclosed by the tusk in its pulpy secretion, and corrosive action
thereby prevented, the process of growth continued without interruption.

Ivory

is a solid, white, translucent substance, distinguishable from bone
by its beautiful texture of semi-transparent rhomboidal network.

The finest ivory is much more transparent than paper of the same thickness. A thin transverse
section placed under the microscope exhibits a series of curvilinear lines diverging from the
centre and interlacing each other with great regularity and beauty,
closely resembling in appearance the engine-turning of a watch.

It possesses a specific gravity varying from 1.888 in the tooth of
the walrus, to 2.843 in that of the elephant.

Its mean gravity is therefore about two and a half times greater than water. The best, finest,
and most valuable ivory is that obtained from the African elephant. When recently cut, it exhibits
something of a yellowish transparent tint, which is due to the oil it contains, but this gradually
changes to a beautiful and permanent white. It is not easily stained or destroyed by exposure
to the atmosphere, and on that account is used in the arts for all the higher purposes, and especially
for carved ornaments--such as chess-pieces, crucifixes, and articles
of virtu.

Indian ivory, on the contrary, when first cut, is perfectly white,
but it becomes yellow and discoloured with age and exposure.

A good illustration of this circumstance is presented by the dingy-coloured keys of an old pianoforte.

This
popular definition of good and inferior ivory is however, in point of fact, somewhat incorrect,
since ivory obtained from the coast of Africa is often much inferior to that obtained from the
Indian Archipelago. The best rule for determining the quality is probably that of its vicinity to
the equator. The ivory brought from within the 10th degrees of north and south latitude is incomparably
the finest in the market; it is at the same time the most transparent, which of itself is a
valuable characteristic. Our Indian ivory for some years back, instead of being shipped by
way of the Cape for England, has, in order to save time, been sent
by the Red Sea to Suez, and thence conveyed, generally on the backs
of camels, across the Desert to Alexandria, where it is again shipped
on board the Oriental steam-packets for Southampton, and conveyed
by railway to London.



"It ran into me, Glenn, and buried me," she laughed.

His fine eyes lingered on her face with glad and warm glance, and the keen, apprehensive penetration
of a lover.

"Well, under all that dust you look scared," he said.

"Scared! I was worse than that. When I first ran into the flying dirt I was only afraid I'd
lose my way--and my complexion. But when the worst of the storm hit me--then I feared I'd lose
my breath."

"Did you face that sand and ride through it all?" he queried.

"No, not all. But enough. I went through the worst of it before I reached the cabin," she replied.

"Wasn't it great?"

"Yes--great bother and annoyance," she said, laconically.

Whereupon he reached with long, arm and wrapped it round her as they rocked side by side. Demonstrations
of this nature were infrequent with Glenn. Despite losing one foot out of a stirrup and her
seat in the saddle Carley rather encouraged it. He kissed her dusty face, and then set her back.

"By George! Carley, sometimes I think you've changed since you've been here," he said, with
warmth. "To go through that sandstorm without one kick--one knock at my West!"

"Glenn, I always think of what Flo says--the worst is yet to come," replied Carley, trying
to hide her unreasonable and tumultuous pleasure at words of praise from him.

"Carley Burch, you don't know yourself," he declared, enigmatically.

"What woman knows herself? But do you know me?"

"Not I. Yet sometimes I see depths in you--wonderful possibilities--submerged under your poise--under
your fixed, complacent idle attitude toward life."

This seemed for Carley to be dangerously skating near thin ice, but she could not resist a retort:

"Depths in me? Why I am a shallow, transparent stream like your West Fork! ... And as for possibilities--may
I ask what of them you imagine you see?"

"As a girl, before you were claimed by the world, you were earnest at heart. You had big hopes
and dreams. And you had intellect, too. But you have wasted your talents, Carley. Having money,
and spending it, living for pleasure, you have not realized your powers.... Now, don't look
hurt. I'm not censuring you, It's just the way of modern life. And most of your friends have
been more careless, thoughtless, useless than you. The aim of their existence is to be comfortable,
free from work, worry, pain. They want pleasure, luxury. And what a pity it is! The best of
you girls regard marriage as an escape, instead of responsibility. You don't marry to get your
shoulders square against the old wheel of American progress--to help some man make good--to
bring a troop of healthy American kids into the world. You bare your shoulders to the gaze
of the multitude and like it best if you are strung with pearls."

"Glenn, you distress me when you talk like this," replied Carley, soberly. "You did not use
to talk so. It seems to me you are bitter against women."

"Oh no, Carley! I am only sad," he said. "I only see where once I was blind. American women
are the finest on earth, but as a race, if they don't change, they're doomed to extinction."

"How can you say such things?" demanded Carley, with spirit.

"I say them because they are true. Carley, on the level now, tell me how many of your immediate
friends have children."

Put to a test, Carley rapidly went over in mind her circle of friends, with the result that
she was somewhat shocked and amazed to realize how few of them were even married, and how the
babies of her acquaintance were limited to three. It was not easy to admit this to Glenn.

"My dear," replied he, "if that does not show you the handwriting on the wall, nothing ever will."

"A girl has to find a husband, doesn't she?" asked Carley, roused to defense of her sex. "And
if she's anybody she has to find one in her set. Well, husbands are not plentiful. Marriage
certainly is not the end of existence these days. We have to get along somehow. The high cost
of living is no inconsderable factor today. Do you know that most of the better-class apartment
houses in New York will not take children? Women are not all to blame. Take the speed mania.
Men must have automobiles. I know one girl who wanted a baby, but her husband wanted a car.
They couldn't afford both."

"Carley, I'm not blaming women more than men," returned Glenn. "I don't know that I blame them
as a class. But in my own mind I have worked it all out. Every man or woman who is genuinely
American should read the signs of the times, realize the crisis, and meet it in an American
way. Otherwise we are done as a race. Money is God in the older countries. But it should never
become God in America. If it does we will make the fall of Rome pale into insignificance."

"Glenn, let's put off the argument," appealed Carley. "I'm not--just up to fighting you today.
Oh--you needn't smile. I'm not showing a yellow streak, as Flo puts it. I'll fight you some
other time."

"You're right, Carley," he assented. "Here we are loafing six or seven miles from home. Let's
rustle along."

Riding fast with Glenn was something Carley had only of late added to her achievements. She
had greatest pride in it. So she urged her mustang to keep pace with Glenn's horse and gave
herself up to the thrill of the motion and feel of wind and sense of flying along. At a good
swinging lope Calico covered ground swiftly and did not tire. Carley rode the two miles to
the rim of the canyon, keeping alongside of Glenn all the way. Indeed, for one long level stretch
she and Glenn held hands. When they arrived at the descent, which necessitated slow and careful
riding, she was hot and tingling and breathless, worked by the action into an exuberance of
pleasure. Glenn complimented her riding as well as her rosy cheeks. There was indeed a sweetness
in working at a task as she had worked to learn to ride in Western fashion. Every turn of her
mind seemed to confront her with sobering antitheses of thought. Why had she come to love to
ride down a lonely desert road, through ragged cedars where the wind whipped her face with
fragrant wild breath, if at the same time she hated the West? Could she hate a country, however
barren and rough, if it had saved the health and happiness of her future husband? Verily there
were problems for Carley to solve.

Early twilight purple lay low in the hollows and clefts of the canyon. Over the western rim
a pale ghost of the evening star seemed to smile at Carley, to bid her look and look. Like
a strain of distant music, the dreamy hum of falling water, the murmur and melody of the stream,
came again to Carley's sensitive ear.

"Do you love this?" asked Glenn, when they reached the green-forested canyon floor, with the
yellow road winding away into the purple shadows.

"Yes, both the ride--and you," flashed Carley, contrarily. She knew he had meant the deep-walled
canyon with its brooding solitude.

"But I want you to love Arizona," he said.

"Glenn, I'm a faithful creature. You should be glad of that. I love New York."

"Very well, then. Arizona to New York," he said, lightly brushing her cheek with his lips.
And swerving back into his saddle, he spurred his horse and called back over his shoulder:
"That mustang and Flo have beaten me many a time. Come on."

It was not so much his words as his tone and look that roused Carley. Had he resented her loyalty
to the city of her nativity? Always there was a little rift in the lute. Had his tone and look
meant that Flo might catch him if Carley could not? Absurd as the idea was, it spurred her
to recklessness. Her mustang did not need any more than to know she wanted him to run. The
road was of soft yellow earth flanked with green foliage and overspread by pines. In a moment
she was racing at a speed she had never before half attained on a horse. Down the winding road
Glenn's big steed sped, his head low, his stride tremendous, his action beautiful. But Carley
saw the distance between them diminishing. Calico was overtaking the bay. She cried out in
the thrilling excitement of the moment. Glenn saw her gaining and pressed his mount to greater
speed. Still he could not draw away from Calico. Slowly the little mustang gained. It seemed
to Carley that riding him required no effort at all. And at such fast pace, with the wind roaring
in her ears, the walls of green vague and continuous in her sight, the sting of pine tips on
cheek and neck, the yellow road streaming toward her, under her, there rose out of the depths
of her, out of the tumult of her breast, a sense of glorious exultation. She closed in on Glenn.
From the flying hoofs of his horse shot up showers of damp sand and gravel that covered Carley's
riding habit and spattered in her face. She had to hold up a hand before her eyes. Perhaps
this caused her to lose something of her confidence, or her swing in the saddle, for suddenly
she realized she was not riding well. The pace was too fast for her inexperience. But nothing
could have stopped her then. No fear or awkwardness of hers should be allowed to hamper that
thoroughbred mustang. Carley felt that Calico understood the situation; or at least he knew
he could catch and pass this big bay horse, and he intended to do it. Carley was hard put to
it to hang on and keep the flying sand from blinding her.

When Calico drew alongside the bay horse and brought Carley breast to breast with Glenn, and
then inch by inch forged ahead of him, Carley pealed out an exultant cry. Either it frightened
Calico or inspired him, for he shot right ahead of Glenn's horse. Then he lost the smooth,
wonderful action. He seemed hurtling through space at the expense of tremendous muscular action.
Carley could feel it. She lost her equilibrium. She seemed rushing through a blurred green
and black aisle of the forest with a gale in her face. Then, with a sharp jolt, a break, Calico
plunged to the sand. Carley felt herself propelled forward out of the saddle into the air,
and down to strike with a sliding, stunning force that ended in sudden dark oblivion.

Upon recovering consciousness she first felt a sensation of oppression in her chest and a dull
numbness of her whole body. When she opened her eyes she saw Glenn bending over her, holding
her head on his knee. A wet, cold, reviving sensation evidently came from the handkerchief
with which he was mopping her face.

"Carley, you can't be hurt--really!" he was ejaculating, in eager hope. "It was some spill.
But you lit on the sand and slid. You can't be hurt."

The look of his eyes, the tone of his voice, the feel of his hands were such that Carley chose
for a moment to pretend to be very badly hurt indeed. It was worth taking a header to get so
much from Glenn Kilbourne. But she believed she had suffered no more than a severe bruising
and scraping.

"Glenn--dear," she whispered, very low and very eloquently. "I think--my back--is broken....
You'll be free--soon."

Glenn gave a terrible start and his face turned a deathly white. He burst out with quavering,
inarticulate speech.

Carley gazed up at him and then closed her eyes. She could not look at him while carrying on
such deceit. Yet the sight of him and the feel of him then were inexpressibly blissful to her.
What she needed most was assurance of his love. She had it. Beyond doubt, beyond morbid fancy,
the truth had proclaimed itself, filling her heart with joy.

Suddenly she flung her arms up around his neck. "Oh--Glenn! It was too good a chance to miss!...
I'm not hurt a bit."

CHAPTER VII

The day came when Carley asked Mrs. Hutter: "Will you please put up a nice lunch for Glenn
and me? I'm going to walk down to his farm where he's working, and surprise him."

"That's a downright fine idea," declared Mrs. Hutter, and forthwith bustled away to comply
with Carley's request.

So presently Carley found herself carrying a bountiful basket on her arm, faring forth on an
adventure that both thrilled and depressed her. Long before this hour something about Glenn's
work had quickened her pulse and given rise to an inexplicable admiration. That he was big
and strong enough to do such labor made her proud; that he might want to go on doing it made
her ponder and brood.

The morning resembled one of the rare Eastern days in June, when the air appeared flooded by
rich thick amber light. Only the sun here was hotter and the shade cooler.

Carley took to the trail below where West Fork emptied its golden-green waters into Oak Creek.
The red walls seemed to dream and wait under the blaze of the sun; the heat lay like a blanket
over the still foliage; the birds were quiet; only the murmuring stream broke the silence of
the canyon. Never had Carley felt more the isolation and solitude of Oak Creek Canyon. Far
indeed from the madding crowd! Only Carley's stubbornness kept her from acknowledging the sense
of peace that enveloped her--that and the consciousness of her own discontent. What would it
be like to come to this canyon--to give up to its enchantments? That, like many another disturbing
thought, had to go unanswered, to be driven into the closed chambers of Carley's mind, there
to germinate subconsciously, and stalk forth some day to overwhelm her.

The trail led along the creek, threading a maze of bowlders, passing into the shade of cottonwoods,
and crossing sun-flecked patches of sand. Carley's every step seemed to become slower. Regrets
were assailing her. Long indeed had she overstayed her visit to the West. She must not linger
there indefinitely. And mingled with misgiving was a surprise that she had not tired of Oak
Creek. In spite of all, and of the dislike she vaunted to herself, the truth stared at her--she
was not tired.

The long-delayed visit to see Glenn working on his own farm must result in her talking to him
about his work; and in a way not quite clear she regretted the necessity for it. To disapprove
of Glenn! She received faint intimations of wavering, of uncertainty, of vague doubt. But these
were cried down by the dominant and habitable voice of her personality.

Presently through the shaded and shadowed breadth of the belt of forest she saw gleams of a
sunlit clearing. And crossing this space to the border of trees she peered forth, hoping to
espy Glenn at his labors. She saw an old shack, and irregular lines of rude fence built of
poles of all sizes and shapes, and several plots of bare yellow ground, leading up toward the
west side of the canyon wall. Could this clearing be Glenn's farm? Surely she had missed it
or had not gone far enough. This was not a farm, but a slash in the forested level of the canyon
floor, bare and somehow hideous. Dead trees were standing in the lots. They had been ringed
deeply at the base by an ax, to kill them, and so prevent their foliage from shading the soil.
Carley saw a long pile of rocks that evidently had been carried from the plowed ground. There
was no neatness, no regularity, although there was abundant evidence of toil. To clear that
rugged space, to fence it, and plow it, appeared at once to Carley an extremely strenuous and
useless task. Carley persuaded herself that this must be the plot of ground belonging to the
herder Charley, and she was about to turn on down the creek when far up under the bluff she
espied a man. He was stalking along and bending down, stalking along and bending down. She
recognized Glenn. He was planting something in the yellow soil.

Curiously Carley watched him, and did not allow her mind to become concerned with a somewhat
painful swell of her heart. What a stride he had! How vigorous he looked, and earnest! He was
as intent upon this job as if he had been a rustic. He might have been failing to do it well,
but he most certainly was doing it conscientiously. Once he had said to her that a man should
never be judged by the result of his labors, but by the nature of his effort. A man might strive
with all his heart and strength, yet fail. Carley watched him striding along and bending down,
absorbed in his task, unmindful of the glaring hot sun, and somehow to her singularly detached
from the life wherein he had once moved and to which she yearned to take him back. Suddenly
an unaccountable flashing query assailed her conscience: How dare she want to take him back?
She seemed as shocked as if some stranger had accosted her. What was this dimming of her eye,
this inward tremulousness; this dammed tide beating at an unknown and riveted gate of her intelligence?
She felt more then than she dared to face. She struggled against something in herself. The
old habit of mind instinctively resisted the new, the strange. But she did not come off wholly
victorious. The Carley Burch whom she recognized as of old, passionately hated this life and
work of Glenn Kilbourne's, but the rebel self, an unaccountable and defiant Carley, loved him
all the better for them.

Carley drew a long deep breath before she called Glenn. This meeting would be momentous and
she felt no absolute surety of herself.

Manifestly he was surprised to hear her call, and, dropping his sack and implement, he hurried
across the tilled ground, sending up puffs of dust. He vaulted the rude fence of poles, and
upon sight of her called out lustily. How big and virile he looked! Yet he was gaunt and strained.
It struck Carley that he had not looked so upon her arrival at Oak Creek. Had she worried him?
The query gave her a pang.

"Sir Tiller of the Fields," said Carley, gayly, "see, your dinner! I brought it and I am going
to share it."

"You old darling!" he replied, and gave her an embrace that left her cheek moist with the sweat
of his. He smelled of dust and earth and his body was hot. "I wish to God it could be true
for always!"

His loving, bearish onslaught and his words quite silenced Carley. How at critical moments
he always said the thing that hurt her or inhibited her! She essayed a smile as she drew back
from him.

"It's sure good of you," he said, taking the basket. "I was thinking I'd be through work sooner
today, and was sorry I had not made a date with you. Come, we'll find a place to sit."

Whereupon he led her back under the trees to a half-sunny, half-shady bench of rock overhanging
the stream. Great pines overshadowed a still, eddying pool. A number of brown butterflies hovered
over the water, and small trout floated like spotted feathers just under the surface. Drowsy
summer enfolded the sylvan scene.

Glenn knelt at the edge of the brook, and, plunging his hands in, he splashed like a huge dog
and bathed his hot face and head, and then turned to Carley with gay words and laughter, while
he wiped himself dry with a large red scarf. Carley was not proof against the virility of him
then, and at the moment, no matter what it was that had made him the man he looked, she loved it.

"I'll sit in the sun," he said, designating a place. "When you're hot you mustn't rest in the
shade, unless you've coat or sweater. But you sit here in the shade."

"Glenn, that'll put us too far apart," complained Carley. "I'll sit in the sun with you."

The delightful simplicity and happiness of the ensuing hour was something Carley believed she
would never forget.

"There! we've licked the platter clean," she said. "What starved bears we were!.... I wonder
if I shall enjoy eating--when I get home. I used to be so finnicky and picky."

"Carley, don't talk about home," said Glenn, appealingly.

"You dear old farmer, I'd love to stay here and just dream--forever," replied Carley, earnestly.
"But I came on purpose to talk seriously."

"Oh, you did! About what?" he returned, with some quick, indefinable change of tone and expression.

"Well, first about your work. I know I hurt your feelings when I wouldn't listen. But I wasn't
ready. I wanted to--to just be gay with you for a while. Don't think I wasn't interested. I
was. And now, I'm ready to hear all about it--and everything."

She smiled at him bravely, and she knew that unless some unforeseen shock upset her composure,
she would be able to conceal from him anything which might hurt his feelings.

"You do look serious," he said, with keen eyes on her.

"Just what are your business relations with Hutter?" she inquired.

"I'm simply working for him," replied Glenn. "My aim is to get an interest in his sheep, and
I expect to, some day. We have some plans. And one of them is the development of that Deep
Lake section. You remember--you were with us. The day Spillbeans spilled you?"

"Yes, I remember. It was a pretty place," she replied.

Carley did not tell him that for a month past she had owned the Deep Lake section of six hundred
and forty acres. She had, in fact, instructed Hutter to purchase it, and to keep the transaction
a secret for the present. Carley had never been able to understand the impulse that prompted
her to do it. But as Hutter had assured her it was a remarkably good investment on very little
capital, she had tried to persuade herself of its advantages. Back of it all had been an irresistible
desire to be able some day to present to Glenn this ranch site he loved. She had concluded
he would never wholly dissociate himself from this West; and as he would visit it now and then,
she had already begun forming plans of her own. She could stand a month in Arizona at long
intervals.

"Hutter and I will go into cattle raising some day," went on Glenn. "And that Deep Lake place
is what I want for myself."

"What work are you doing for Hutter?" asked Carley.

"Anything from building fence to cutting timber," laughed Glenn. "I've not yet the experience
to be a foreman like Lee Stanton. Besides, I have a little business all my own. I put all my
money in that."

"You mean here--this--this farm?"

"Yes. And the stock I'm raisin'. You see I have to feed corn. And believe me, Carley, those
cornfields represent some job."

"I can well believe that," replied Carley. "You--you looked it."

"Oh, the hard work is over. All I have to do now it to plant and keep the weeds out."

"Glenn, do sheep eat corn?"

"I plant corn to feed my hogs."

"Hogs?" she echoed, vaguely.

"Yes, hogs," he said, with quiet gravity. "The first day you visited my cabin I told you I
raised hogs, and I fried my own ham for your dinner."

"Is that what you--put your money in?"

"Yes. And Hutter says I've done well."

"Hogs!" ejaculated Carley, aghast.

"My dear, are you growin' dull of comprehension?" retorted Glenn. "H-o-g-s." He spelled the
word out. "I'm in the hog-raising business, and pretty blamed well pleased over my success so far."

Carley caught herself in time to quell outwardly a shock of amaze and revulsion. She laughed,
and exclaimed against her stupidity. The look of Glenn was no less astounding than the content
of his words. He was actually proud of his work. Moreover, he showed not the least sign that
he had any idea such information might be startlingly obnoxious to his fiancee.

"Glenn! It's so--so queer," she ejaculated. "That you--Glenn Kilbourne-should ever go in for--for
hogs!... It's unbelievable. How'd you ever--ever happen to do it?"

"By Heaven! you're hard on me!" he burst out, in sudden dark, fierce passion. "How'd I ever
happen to do it?... What was there left for me? I gave my soul and heart and body to the government--to
fight for my country. I came home a wreck. What did my government do for me? What did my employers
do for me? What did the people I fought for do for me?... Nothing--so help me God--nothing!...
I got a ribbon and a bouquet--a little applause for an hour--and then the sight of me sickened
my countrymen. I was broken and used. I was absolutely forgotten.... But my body, my life,
my soul meant all to me. My future was ruined, but I wanted to live. I had killed men who never
harmed me--I was not fit to die.... I tried to live. So I fought out my battle alone. Alone!...
No one understood. No one cared. I came West to keep from dying of consumption in sight of
the indifferent mob for whom I had sacrificed myself. I chose to die on my feet away off alone
somewhere.... But I got well. And what made me well--and saved my soul--was the first work
that offered. Raising and tending hogs!"

The dead whiteness of Glenn's face, the lightning scorn of his eyes, the grim, stark strangeness
of him then had for Carley a terrible harmony with this passionate denunciation of her, of
her kind, of the America for whom he had lost all.

"Oh, Glenn!--forgive--me!" she faltered. "I was only--talking. What do I know? Oh, I am blind--blind
and little!"

She could not bear to face him for a moment, and she hung her head. Her intelligence seemed
concentrating swift, wild thoughts round the shock to her consciousness. By that terrible expression
of his face, by those thundering words of scorn, would she come to realize the mighty truth
of his descent into the abyss and his rise to the heights. Vaguely she began to see. An awful
sense of her deadness, of her soul-blighting selfishness, began to dawn upon her as something
monstrous out of dim, gray obscurity. She trembled under the reality of thoughts that were
not new. How she had babbled about Glenn and the crippled soldiers! How she had imagined she
sympathized! But she had only been a vain, worldly, complacent, effusive little fool. She had
here the shock of her life, and she sensed a greater one, impossible to grasp.

"Carley, that was coming to you," said Glenn, presently, with deep, heavy expulsion of breath.

"I only know I love you--more--more," she cried, wildly, looking up and wanting desperately
to throw herself in his arms.

"I guess you do--a little," he replied. "Sometimes I feel you are a kid. Then again you represent
the world--your world with its age-old custom--its unalterable.... But, Carley, let's get back
to my work."

"Yes--yes," exclaimed Carley, gladly. "I'm ready to--to go pet your hogs--anything."

"By George! I'll take you up," he declared. "I'll bet you won't go near one of my hogpens."

"Lead me to it!" she replied, with a hilarity that was only a nervous reversion of her state.

"Well, maybe I'd better hedge on the bet," he said, laughing again. "You have more in you than
I suspect. You sure fooled me when you stood for the sheep-dip. But, come on, I'll take you
anyway."

So that was how Carley found herself walking arm in arm with Glenn down the canyon trail. A
few moments of action gave her at least an appearance of outward composure. And the state of
her emotion was so strained and intense that her slightest show of interest must deceive Glenn
into thinking her eager, responsive, enthusiastic. It certainly appeared to loosen his tongue.
But Carley knew she was farther from normal than ever before in her life, and that the subtle,
inscrutable woman's intuition of her presaged another shock. Just as she had seemed to change,
so had the aspects of the canyon undergone some illusive transformation. The beauty of green
foliage and amber stream and brown tree trunks and gray rocks and red walls was there; and
the summer drowsiness and languor lay as deep; and the loneliness and solitude brooded with
its same eternal significance. But some nameless enchantment, perhaps of hope, seemed no longer
to encompass her. A blow had fallen upon her, the nature of which only time could divulge.

Glenn led her around the clearing and up to the base of the west wall, where against a shelving
portion of the cliff had been constructed a rude fence of poles. It formed three sides of a
pen, and the fourth side was solid rock. A bushy cedar tree stood in the center. Water flowed
from under the cliff, which accounted for the boggy condition of the red earth. This pen was
occupied by a huge sow and a litter of pigs.

Carley climbed on the fence and sat there while Glenn leaned over the top pole and began to
wax eloquent on a subject evidently dear to his heart. Today of all days Carley made an inspiring
listener. Even the shiny, muddy, suspicious old sow in no wise daunted her fictitious courage.
That filthy pen of mud a foot deep, and of odor rancid, had no terrors for her. With an arm
round Glenn's shoulder she watched the rooting and squealing little pigs, and was amused and
interested, as if they were far removed from the vital issue of the hour. But all the time
as she looked and laughed, and encouraged Glenn to talk, there seemed to be a strange, solemn,
oppressive knocking at her heart. Was it only the beat-beat-beat of blood?

"There were twelve pigs in that litter," Glenn was saying, "and now you see there are only
nine. I've lost three. Mountain lions, bears, coyotes, wild cats are all likely to steal a
pig. And at first I was sure one of these varmints had been robbing me. But as I could not
find any tracks, I knew I had to lay the blame on something else. So I kept watch pretty closely
in daytime, and at night I shut the pigs up in the corner there, where you see I've built a
pen. Yesterday I heard squealing--and, by George! I saw an eagle flying off with one of my
pigs. Say, I was mad. A great old bald-headed eagle--the regal bird you see with America's
stars and stripes had degraded himself to the level of a coyote. I ran for my rifle, and I
took some quick shots at him as he flew up. Tried to hit him, too, but I failed. And the old
rascal hung on to my pig. I watched him carry it to that sharp crag way up there on the rim."

"Poor little piggy!" exclaimed Carley. "To think of our American emblem--our stately bird of
noble warlike mien--our symbol of lonely grandeur and freedom of the heights--think of him
being a robber of pigpens!--Glenn, I begin to appreciate the many-sidedness of things. Even
my hide-bound narrowness is susceptible to change. It's never too late to learn. This should
apply to the Society for the Preservation of the American Eagle."

Glenn led her along the base of the wall to three other pens, in each of which was a fat old
sow with a litter. And at the last enclosure, that owing to dry soil was not so dirty, Glenn
picked up a little pig and held it squealing out to Carley as she leaned over the fence. It
was fairly white and clean, a little pink and fuzzy, and certainly cute with its curled tall.

"Carley Burch, take it in your hands," commanded Glenn.

The feat seemed monstrous and impossible of accomplishment for Carley. Yet such was her temper
at the moment that she would have undertaken anything.

"Why, shore I will, as Flo says," replied Carley, extending her ungloved hands. "Come here,
piggy. I christen you Pinky." And hiding an almost insupportable squeamishness from Glenn,
she took the pig in her hands and fondled it.

"By George!" exclaimed Glenn, in huge delight. "I wouldn't have believed it. Carley, I hope
you tell your fastidious and immaculate Morrison that you held one of my pigs in your beautiful
hands."

"Wouldn't it please you more to tell him yourself?" asked Carley.

"Yes, it would," declared Glenn, grimly.

This incident inspired Glenn to a Homeric narration of his hog-raising experience. In spite
of herself the content of his talk interested her. And as for the effect upon her of his singular
enthusiasm, it was deep and compelling. The little-boned Berkshire razorback hogs grew so large
and fat and heavy that their bones broke under their weight. The Duroc jerseys were the best
breed in that latitude, owing to their larger and stronger bones, that enabled them to stand
up under the greatest accumulation of fat.

Glenn told of his droves of pigs running wild in the canyon below. In summertime they fed upon
vegetation, and at other seasons on acorns, roots, bugs, and grubs. Acorns, particularly, were
good and fattening feed. They ate cedar and juniper berries, and pinyon nuts. And therefore
they lived off the land, at little or no expense to the owner. The only loss was from beasts
and birds of prey. Glenn showed Carley how a profitable business could soon be established.
He meant to fence off side canyons and to segregate droves of his hogs, and to raise abundance
of corn for winter feed. At that time there was a splendid market for hogs, a condition Hutter
claimed would continue indefinitely in a growing country. In conclusion Glenn eloquently told
how in his necessity he had accepted gratefully the humblest of labors, to find in the hard
pursuit of it a rejuvenation of body and mind, and a promise of independence and prosperity.

When he had finished, and excused himself to go repair a weak place in the corral fence, Carley
sat silent, wrapped in strange meditation.

Whither had faded the vulgarity and ignominy she had attached to Glenn's raising of hogs? Gone--like
other miasmas of her narrow mind! Partly she understood him now. She shirked consideration
of his sacrifice to his country. That must wait. But she thought of his work, and the more
she thought the less she wondered.

First he had labored with his hands. What infinite meaning lay unfolding to her vision! Somewhere
out of it all came the conception that man was intended to earn his bread by the sweat of his
brow. But there was more to it than that. By that toil and sweat, by the friction of horny
palms, by the expansion and contraction of muscle, by the acceleration of blood, something
great and enduring, something physical and spiritual, came to a man. She understood then why
she would have wanted to surrender herself to a man made manly by toil; she understood how
a woman instinctively leaned toward the protection of a man who had used his hands--who had
strength and red blood and virility who could fight like the progenitors of the race. Any toil
was splendid that served this end for any man. It all went back to the survival of the fittest.
And suddenly Carley thought of Morrison. He could dance and dangle attendance upon her, and
amuse her--but how would he have acquitted himself in a moment of peril? She had her doubts.
Most assuredly he could not have beaten down for her a ruffian like Haze Ruff. What then should
be the significance of a man for a woman?

Carley's querying and answering mind reverted to Glenn. He had found a secret in this seeking
for something through the labor of hands. All development of body must come through exercise
of muscles. The virility of cell in tissue and bone depended upon that. Thus he had found in
toil the pleasure and reward athletes had in their desultory training. But when a man learned
this secret the need of work must become permanent. Did this explain the law of the Persians
that every man was required to sweat every day?

Carley tried to picture to herself Glenn's attitude of mind when he had first gone to work
here in the West. Resolutely she now denied her shrinking, cowardly sensitiveness. She would
go to the root of this matter, if she had intelligence enough. Crippled, ruined in health,
wrecked and broken by an inexplicable war, soul-blighted by the heartless, callous neglect
of government and public, on the verge of madness at the insupportable facts, he had yet been
wonderful enough, true enough to himself and God, to fight for life with the instinct of a
man, to fight for his mind with a noble and unquenchable faith. Alone indeed he had been alone!
And by some miracle beyond the power of understanding he had found day by day in his painful
efforts some hope and strength to go on. He could not have had any illusions. For Glenn Kilbourne
the health and happiness and success most men held so dear must have seemed impossible. His
slow, daily, tragic, and terrible task must have been something he owed himself. Not for Carley
Burch! She like all the others had failed him. How Carley shuddered in confession of that!
Not for the country which had used him and cast him off! Carley divined now, as if by a flash
of lightning, the meaning of Glenn's strange, cold, scornful, and aloof manner when he had
encountered young men of his station, as capable and as strong as he, who had escaped the service
of the army. For him these men did not exist. They were less than nothing. They had waxed fat
on lucrative jobs; they had basked in the presence of girls whose brothers and lovers were
in the trenches or on the turbulent sea, exposed to the ceaseless dread and almost ceaseless
toil of war. If Glenn's spirit had lifted him to endurance of war for the sake of others, how
then could it fail him in a precious duty of fidelity to himself? Carley could see him day
by day toiling in his lonely canyon--plodding to his lonely cabin. He had been playing the
game--fighting it out alone as surely he knew his brothers of like misfortune were fighting.

So Glenn Kilbourne loomed heroically in Carley's transfigured sight. He was one of Carley's
battle-scarred warriors. Out of his travail he had climbed on stepping-stones of his dead self.
Resurgam! That had been his unquenchable cry. Who had heard it? Only the solitude of his lonely
canyon, only the waiting, dreaming, watching walls, only the silent midnight shadows, only
the white, blinking, passionless stars, only the wild creatures of his haunts, only the moaning
wind in the pines--only these had been with him in his agony. How near were these things to God?

Carley's heart seemed full to bursting. Not another single moment could her mounting love abide
in a heart that held a double purpose. How bitter the assurance that she had not come West
to help him! It was self, self, all self that had actuated her. Unworthy indeed was she of
the love of this man. Only a lifetime of devotion to him could acquit her in the eyes of her
better self. Sweetly and madly raced the thrill and tumult of her blood. There must be only
one outcome to her romance. Yet the next instant there came a dull throbbing--an oppression
which was pain--an impondering vague thought of catastrophe. Only the fearfulness of love perhaps!

She saw him complete his task and wipe his brown moist face and stride toward her, coming nearer,
tall and erect with something added to his soldierly bearing, with a light in his eyes she
could no longer bear.

The moment for which she had waited more than two months had come at last.

"Glenn--when will you go back East?" she asked, tensely and low.

The instant the words were spent upon her lips she realized that he had always been waiting
and prepared for this question that had been so terrible for her to ask.

"Carley," he replied gently, though his voice rang, "I am never going back East."

An inward quivering hindered her articulation.

"Never?" she whispered.

"Never to live, or stay any while," he went on. "I might go some time for a little visit....
But never to live."

"Oh--Glenn!" she gasped, and her hands fluttered out to him. The shock was driving home. No
amaze, no incredulity succeeded her reception of the fact. It was a slow stab. Carley felt
the cold blanch of her skin. "Then--this is it--the something I felt strange between us?"

"Yes, I knew--and you never asked me," he replied.

"That was it? All the time you knew," she whispered, huskily. "You knew. ... I'd never--marry
you--never live out here?"

"Yes, Carley, I knew you'd never be woman enough--American enough--to help me reconstruct my
broken life out here in the West," he replied, with a sad and bitter smile.

That flayed her. An insupportable shame and wounded vanity and clamoring love contended for
dominance of her emotions. Love beat down all else.

"Dearest--I beg of you--don't break my heart," she implored.

"I love you, Carley," he answered, steadily, with piercing eyes on hers.

"Then come back--home--home with me."

"No. If you love me you will be my wife."

"Love you! Glenn, I worship you," she broke out, passionately. "But I could not live here--I
could not."

"Carley, did you ever read of the woman who said, 'Whither thou goest, there will I go'..."

"Oh, don't be ruthless! Don't judge me.... I never dreamed of this. I came West to take you back."

"My dear, it was a mistake," he said, gently, softening to her distress. "I'm sorry I did not
write you more plainly. But, Carley, I could not ask you to share this--this wilderness home
with me. I don't ask it now. I always knew you couldn't do it. Yet you've changed so--that
I hoped against hope. Love makes us blind even to what we see."

"Don't try to spare me. I'm slight and miserable. I stand abased in my own eyes. I thought
I loved you. But I must love best the crowd--people--luxury--fashion--the damned round of things
I was born to."

"Carley, you will realize their insufficiency too late," he replied, earnestly. "The things
you were born to are love, work, children, happiness."

"Don't! don't!... they are hollow mockery for me," she cried, passionately. "Glenn, it is the
end. It must come--quickly.... You are free."

"I do not ask to be free. Wait. Go home and look at it again with different eyes. Think things
over. Remember what came to me out of the West. I will always love you--and I will be here--hoping--"

"I--I cannot listen," she returned, brokenly, and she clenched her hands tightly to keep from
wringing them. "I--I cannot face you.... Here is--your ring.... You--are--free.... Don't stop
me--don't come.... Oh, Glenn, good-by!"

With breaking heart she whirled away from him and hurried down the slope toward the trail.
The shade of the forest enveloped her. Peering back through the trees, she saw Glenn standing
where she had left him, as if already stricken by the loneliness that must be his lot. A sob
broke from Carley's throat. She hated herself. She was in a terrible state of conflict. Decision
had been wrenched from her, but she sensed unending strife. She dared not look back again.
Stumbling and breathless, she hurried on. How changed the atmosphere and sunlight and shadow
of the canyon! The looming walls had pitiless eyes for her flight. When she crossed the mouth
of West Fork an almost irresistible force breathed to her from under the stately pines.

An hour later she had bidden farewell to the weeping Mrs. Hutter, and to the white-faced Flo,
and Lolomi Lodge, and the murmuring waterfall, and the haunting loneliness of Oak Creek Canyon.

CHAPTER VIII

At Flagstaff, where Carley arrived a few minutes before train time, she was too busily engaged
with tickets and baggage to think of herself or of the significance of leaving Arizona. But
as she walked into the Pullman she overheard a passenger remark, "Regular old Arizona sunset,"
and that shook her heart. Suddenly she realized she had come to love the colorful sunsets,
to watch and wait for them. And bitterly she thought how that was her way to learn the value
of something when it was gone.

The jerk and start of the train affected her with singular depressing shock. She had burned
her last bridge behind her. Had she unconsciously hoped for some incredible reversion of Glenn's
mind or of her own? A sense of irreparable loss flooded over her--the first check to shame
and humiliation.

From her window she looked out to the southwest. Somewhere across the cedar and pine-greened
uplands lay Oak Creek Canyon, going to sleep in its purple and gold shadows of sunset. Banks
of broken clouds hung to the horizon, like continents and islands and reefs set in a turquoise
sea. Shafts of sunlight streaked down through creamy-edged and purple-centered clouds. Vast
flare of gold dominated the sunset background.

When the train rounded a curve Carley's strained vision became filled with the upheaved bulk
of the San Francisco Mountains. Ragged gray grass slopes and green forests on end, and black
fringed sky lines, all pointed to the sharp clear peaks spearing the sky. And as she watched,
the peaks slowly flushed with sunset hues, and the sky flared golden, and the strength of the
eternal mountains stood out in sculptured sublimity. Every day for two months and more Carley
had watched these peaks, at all hours, in every mood; and they had unconsciously become a part
of her thought. The train was relentlessly whirling her eastward. Soon they must become a memory.
Tears blurred her sight. Poignant regret seemed added to the anguish she was suffering. Why
had she not learned sooner to see the glory of the mountains, to appreciate the beauty and
solitude? Why had she not understood herself?

The next day through New Mexico she followed magnificent ranges and valleys--so different from
the country she had seen coming West--so supremely beautiful that she wondered if she had only
acquired the harvest of a seeing eye.

But it was at sunset of the following clay, when the train was speeding down the continental
slope of prairie land beyond the Rockies, that the West took its ruthless revenge.

Masses of strange cloud and singular light upon the green prairie, and a luminosity in the
sky, drew Carley to the platform of her car, which was the last of the train. There she stood,
gripping the iron gate, feeling the wind whip her hair and the iron-tracked ground speed from
under her, spellbound and stricken at the sheer wonder and glory of the firmament, and the
mountain range that it canopied so exquisitely.

A rich and mellow light, singularly clear, seemed to flood out of some unknown source. For
the sun was hidden. The clouds just above Carley hung low, and they were like thick, heavy
smoke, mushrooming, coalescing, forming and massing, of strange yellow cast of nature. It shaded
westward into heliotrope and this into a purple so royal, so matchless and rare that Carley
understood why the purple of the heavens could never be reproduced in paint. Here the cloud
mass thinned and paled, and a tint of rose began to flush the billowy, flowery, creamy white.
Then came the surpassing splendor of this cloud pageant--a vast canopy of shell pink, a sun-fired
surface like an opal sea, rippled and webbed, with the exquisite texture of an Oriental fabric,
pure, delicate, lovely--as no work of human hands could be. It mirrored all the warm, pearly
tints of the inside whorl of the tropic nautilus. And it ended abruptly, a rounded depth of
bank, on a broad stream of clear sky, intensely blue, transparently blue, as if through the
lambent depths shone the infinite firmament. The lower edge of this stream took the golden
lightning of the sunset and was notched for all its horizon-long length by the wondrous white
glistening-peaked range of the Rockies. Far to the north, standing aloof from the range, loomed
up the grand black bulk and noble white dome of Pikes Peak.

Carley watched the sunset transfiguration of cloud and sky and mountain until all were cold
and gray. And then she returned to her seat, thoughtful and sad, feeling that the West had
mockingly flung at her one of its transient moments of loveliness.

Nor had the West wholly finished with her. Next day the mellow gold of the Kansas wheat fields,
endless and boundless as a sunny sea, rich, waving in the wind, stretched away before her aching
eyes for hours and hours. Here was the promise fulfilled, the bountiful harvest of the land,
the strength of the West. The great middle state had a heart of gold.

East of Chicago Carley began to feel that the long days and nights of riding, the ceaseless
turning of the wheels, the constant and wearing stress of emotion, had removed her an immeasurable
distance of miles and time and feeling from the scene of her catastrophe. Many days seemed
to have passed. Many had been the hours of her bitter regret and anguish.

Indiana and Ohio, with their green pastoral farms, and numberless villages, and thriving cities,
denoted a country far removed and different from the West, and an approach to the populous
East. Carley felt like a wanderer coming home. She was restlessly and impatiently glad. But
her weariness of body and mind, and the close atmosphere of the car, rendered her extreme discomfort.
Summer had laid its hot hand on the low country east of the Mississippi.

Carley had wired her aunt and two of her intimate friends to meet her at the Grand Central
Station. This reunion soon to come affected Carley in recurrent emotions of relief, gladness,
and shame. She did not sleep well, and arose early, and when the train reached Albany she felt
that she could hardly endure the tedious hours. The majestic Hudson and the palatial mansions
on the wooded bluffs proclaimed to Carley that she was back in the East. How long a time seemed
to have passed! Either she was not the same or the aspect of everything had changed. But she
believed that as soon as she got over the ordeal of meeting her friends, and was home again,
she would soon see things rationally.

At last the train sheered away from the broad Hudson and entered the environs of New York.
Carley sat perfectly still, to all outward appearances a calm, superbly-poised New York woman
returning home, but inwardly raging with contending tides. In her own sight she was a disgraceful
failure, a prodigal sneaking back to the ease and protection of loyal friends who did not know
her truly. Every familiar landmark in the approach to the city gave her a thrill, yet a vague
unsatisfied something lingered after each sensation.

Then the train with rush and roar crossed the Harlem River to enter New York City. As one waking
from a dream Carley saw the blocks and squares of gray apartment houses and red buildings,
the miles of roofs and chimneys, the long hot glaring streets full of playing children and
cars. Then above the roar of the train sounded the high notes of a hurdy-gurdy. Indeed she
was home. Next to startle her was the dark tunnel, and then the slowing of the train to a stop.
As she walked behind a porter up the long incline toward the station gate her legs seemed to
be dead.

In the circle of expectant faces beyond the gate she saw her aunt's, eager and agitated, then
the handsome pale face of Eleanor Harmon, and beside her the sweet thin one of Beatrice Lovell.
As they saw her how quick the change from expectancy to joy! It seemed they all rushed upon
her, and embraced her, and exclaimed over her together. Carley never recalled what she said.
But her heart was full.

"Oh, how perfectly stunning you look!" cried Eleanor, backing away from Carley and gazing with
glad, surprised eyes.

"Carley!" gasped Beatrice. "You wonderful golden-skinned goddess!... You're young again, like
you were in our school days."

It was before Aunt Mary's shrewd, penetrating, loving gaze that Carley quailed.

"Yes, Carley, you look well--better than I ever saw you, but--but--"

"But I don't look happy," interrupted Carley. "I am happy to get home--to see you all... But--my--my
heart is broken!"

A little shocked silence ensued, then Carley found herself being led across the lower level
and up the wide stairway. As she mounted to the vast-domed cathedral-like chamber of the station
a strange sensation pierced her with a pang. Not the old thrill of leaving New York or returning!
Nor was it the welcome sight of the hurrying, well-dressed throng of travelers and commuters,
nor the stately beauty of the station. Carley shut her eyes, and then she knew. The dim light
of vast space above, the looming gray walls, shadowy with tracery of figures, the lofty dome
like the blue sky, brought back to her the walls of Oak Creek Canyon and the great caverns
under the ramparts. As suddenly as she had shut her eyes Carley opened them to face her friends.

"Let me get it over--quickly," she burst out, with hot blood surging to her face. "I--I hated
the West. It was so raw--so violent--so big. I think I hate it more--now.... But it changed
me--made me over physically--and did something to my soul--God knows what.... And it has saved
Glenn. Oh! he is wonderful! You would never know him.... For long I had not the courage to
tell him I came to bring him back East. I kept putting it off. And I rode, I climbed, I camped,
I lived outdoors. At first it nearly killed me. Then it grew bearable, and easier, until I
forgot. I wouldn't be honest if I didn't admit now that somehow I had a wonderful time, in
spite of all.... Glenn's business is raising hogs. He has a hog ranch. Doesn't it sound sordid?
But things are not always what they sound--or seem. Glenn is absorbed in his work. I hated
it--I expected to ridicule it. But I ended by infinitely respecting him. I learned through
his hog-raising the real nobility of work.... Well, at last I found courage to ask him when
he was coming back to New York. He said 'never!'... I realized then my blindness, my selfishness.
I could not be his wife and live there. I could not. I was too small, too miserable, too comfort-loving--too
spoiled. And all the time he knew this--knew I'd never be big enough to marry him.... That
broke my heart. I left him free--and here I am.... I beg you--don't ask me any more--and never
to mention it to me--so I can forget."

The tender unspoken sympathy of women who loved her proved comforting in that trying hour.
With the confession ruthlessly made the hard compression in Carley's breast subsided, and her
eyes cleared of a hateful dimness. When they reached the taxi stand outside the station Carley
felt a rush of hot devitalized air from the street. She seemed not to be able to get air into
her lungs.

"Isn't it dreadfully hot?" she asked.

"This is a cool spell to what we had last week," replied Eleanor.

"Cool!" exclaimed Carley, as she wiped her moist face. "I wonder if you Easterners know the
real significance of words."

Then they entered a taxi, to be whisked away apparently through a labyrinthine maze of cars
and streets, where pedestrians had to run and jump for their lives. A congestion of traffic
at Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street halted their taxi for a few moments, and here in the
thick of it Carley had full assurance that she was back in the metropolis. Her sore heart eased
somewhat at sight of the streams of people passing to and fro. How they rushed! Where were
they going? What was their story? And all the while her aunt held her hand, and Beatrice and
Eleanor talked as fast as their tongues could wag. Then the taxi clattered on up the Avenue,
to turn down a side street and presently stop at Carley's home. It was a modest three-story
brown-stone house. Carley had been so benumbed by sensations that she did not imagine she could
experience a new one. But peering out of the taxi, she gazed dubiously at the brownish-red
stone steps and front of her home.

"I'm going to have it painted," she muttered, as if to herself.

Her aunt and her friends laughed, glad and relieved to hear such a practical remark from Carley.
How were they to divine that this brownish-red stone was the color of desert rocks and canyon
walls?

In a few more moments Carley was inside the house, feeling a sense of protection in the familiar
rooms that had been her home for seventeen years. Once in the sanctity of her room, which was
exactly as she had left it, her first action was to look in the mirror at her weary, dusty,
heated face. Neither the brownness of it nor the shadow appeared to harmonize with the image
of her that haunted the mirror.

"Now!" she whispered low. "It's done. I'm home. The old life--or a new life? How to meet either.
Now!"

Thus she challenged her spirit. And her intelligence rang at her the imperative necessity for
action, for excitement, for effort that left no time for rest or memory or wakefulness. She
accepted the issue. She was glad of the stern fight ahead of her. She set her will and steeled
her heart with all the pride and vanity and fury of a woman who had been defeated but who scorned
defeat. She was what birth and breeding and circumstance had made her. She would seek what
the old life held.

What with unpacking and chatting and telephoning and lunching, the day soon passed. Carley
went to dinner with friends and later to a roof garden. The color and light, the gayety and
music, the news of acquaintances, the humor of the actors--all, in fact, except the unaccustomed
heat and noise, were most welcome and diverting. That night she slept the sleep of weariness.

Awakening early, she inaugurated a habit of getting up at once, instead of lolling in bed,
and breakfasting there, and reading her mail, as had been her wont before going West. Then
she went over business matters with her aunt, called on her lawyer and banker, took lunch with
Rose Maynard, and spent the afternoon shopping. Strong as she was, the unaccustomed heat and
the hard pavements and the jostle of shoppers and the continual rush of sensations wore her
out so completely that she did not want any dinner. She talked to her aunt a while, then went
to bed.

Next day Carley motored through Central Park, and out of town into Westchester County, finding
some relief from the seemed to look at the dusty trees and the worn greens without really seeing
them. In the afternoon she called on friends, and had dinner at home with her aunt, and then
went to a theatre. The musical comedy was good, but the almost unbearable heat and the vitiated
air spoiled her enjoyment. That night upon arriving home at midnight she stepped out of the
taxi, and involuntarily, without thought, looked up to see the stars. But there were no stars.
A murky yellow-tinged blackness hung low over the city. Carley recollected that stars, and
sunrises and sunsets, and untainted air, and silence were not for city dwellers. She checked
any continuation of the thought.

A few days sufficed to swing her into the old life. Many of Carley's friends had neither the
leisure nor the means to go away from the city during the summer. Some there were who might
have afforded that if they had seen fit to live in less showy apartments, or to dispense with
cars. Other of her best friends were on their summer outings in the Adirondacks. Carley decided
to go with her aunt to Lake Placid about the first of August. Meanwhile she would keep going
and doing.

She had been a week in town before Morrison telephoned her and added his welcome. Despite the
gay gladness of his voice, it irritated her. Really, she scarcely wanted to see him. But a
meeting was inevitable, and besides, going out with him was in accordance with the plan she
had adopted. So she made an engagement to meet him at the Plaza for dinner. When with slow
and pondering action she hung up the receiver it occurred to her that she resented the idea
of going to the Plaza. She did not dwell on the reason why.

When Carley went into the reception room of the Plaza that night Morrison was waiting for her--the
same slim, fastidious, elegant, sallow-faced Morrison whose image she had in mind, yet somehow
different. He had what Carley called the New York masculine face, blase and lined, with eyes
that gleamed, yet had no fire. But at sight of her his face lighted up.

"By Jove! but you've come back a peach!" he exclaimed, clasping her extended hand. "Eleanor
told me you looked great. It's worth missing you to see you like this."

"Thanks, Larry," she replied. "I must look pretty well to win that compliment from you. And
how are you feeling? You don't seem robust for a golfer and horseman. But then I'm used to
husky Westerners."

"Oh, I'm fagged with the daily grind," he said. "I'll be glad to get up in the mountains next
month. Let's go down to dinner."

They descended the spiral stairway to the grillroom, where an orchestra was playing jazz, and
dancers gyrated on a polished floor, and diners in evening dress looked on over their cigarettes.

"Well, Carley, are you still finicky about the eats?" he queried, consulting the menu.

"No. But I prefer plain food," she replied.

"Have a cigarette," he said, holding out his silver monogrammed case.

"Thanks, Larry. I--I guess I'll not take up smoking again. You see, while I was West I got
out of the habit."

"Yes, they told me you had changed," he returned. "How about drinking?"

"Why, I thought New York had gone dry!" she said, forcing a laugh.

"Only on the surface. Underneath it's wetter than ever."

"Well, I'll obey the law."

He ordered a rather elaborate dinner, and then turning his attention to Carley, gave her closer
scrutiny. Carley knew then that he had become acquainted with the fact of her broken engagement.
It was a relief not to need to tell him.

"How's that big stiff, Kilbourne?" asked Morrison, suddenly. "Is it true he got well?"

"Oh--yes! He's fine," replied Carley with eyes cast down. A hot knot seemed to form deep within
her and threatened to break and steal along her veins. "But if you please--I do not care to
talk of him."

"Naturally. But I must tell you that one man's loss is another's gain."

Carley had rather expected renewed courtship from Morrison. She had not, however, been prepared
for the beat of her pulse, the quiver of her nerves, the uprising of hot resentment at the
mere mention of Kilbourne. It was only natural that Glenn's former rivals should speak of him,
and perhaps disparagingly. But from this man Carley could not bear even a casual reference.
Morrison had escaped the army service. He had been given a high-salaried post at the ship-yards--the
duties of which, if there had been any, he performed wherever he happened to be. Morrison's
father had made a fortune in leather during the war. And Carley remembered Glenn telling her
he had seen two whole blocks in Paris piled twenty feet deep with leather army goods that were
never used and probably had never been intended to be used. Morrison represented the not inconsiderable
number of young men in New York who had gained at the expense of the valiant legion who had
lost. But what had Morrison gained? Carley raised her eyes to gaze steadily at him. He looked
well-fed, indolent, rich, effete, and supremely self-satisfied. She could not see that he had
gained anything. She would rather have been a crippled ruined soldier.

"Larry, I fear gain and loss are mere words," she said. "The thing that counts with me is what
you are."

He stared in well-bred surprise, and presently talked of a new dance which had lately come
into vogue. And from that he passed on to gossip of the theatres. Once between courses of the
dinner he asked Carley to dance, and she complied. The music would have stimulated an Egyptian
mummy, Carley thought, and the subdued rose lights, the murmur of gay voices, the glide and
grace and distortion of the dancers, were exciting and pleasurable. Morrison had the suppleness
and skill of a dancing-master. But he held Carley too tightly, and so she told him, and added,
"I imbibed some fresh pure air while I was out West--something you haven't here--and I don't
want it all squeezed out of me."

The latter days of July Carley made busy--so busy that she lost her tan and appetite, and something
of her splendid resistance to the dragging heat and late hours. Seldom was she without some
of her friends. She accepted almost any kind of an invitation, and went even to Coney Island,
to baseball games, to the motion pictures, which were three forms of amusement not customary
with her. At Coney Island, which she visited with two of her younger girl friends, she had
the best time since her arrival home. What had put her in accord with ordinary people? The
baseball games, likewise pleased her. The running of the players and the screaming of the spectators
amused and excited her. But she hated the motion pictures with their salacious and absurd misrepresentations
of life, in some cases capably acted by skillful actors, and in others a silly series of scenes
featuring some doll-faced girl.

But she refused to go horseback riding in Central Park. She refused to go to the Plaza. And
these refusals she made deliberately, without asking herself why.

On August 1st she accompanied her aunt and several friends to Lake Placid, where they established
themselves at a hotel. How welcome to Carley's strained eyes were the green of mountains, the
soft gleam of amber water! How sweet and refreshing a breath of cool pure air! The change from
New York's glare and heat and dirt, and iron-red insulating walls, and thronging millions of
people, and ceaseless roar and rush, was tremendously relieving to Carley. She had burned the
candle at both ends. But the beauty of the hills and vales, the quiet of the forest, the sight
of the stars, made it harder to forget. She had to rest. And when she rested she could not
always converse, or read, or write.

For the most part her days held variety and pleasure. The place was beautiful, the weather
pleasant, the people congenial. She motored over the forest roads, she canoed along the margin
of the lake, she played golf and tennis. She wore exquisite gowns to dinner and danced during
the evenings. But she seldom walked anywhere on the trails and, never alone, and she never
climbed the mountains and never rode a horse.

Morrison arrived and added his attentions to those of other men. Carley neither accepted nor
repelled them. She favored the association with married couples and older people, and rather
shunned the pairing off peculiar to vacationists at summer hotels. She had always loved to
play and romp with children, but here she found herself growing to avoid them, somehow hurt
by sound of pattering feet and joyous laughter. She filled the days as best she could, and
usually earned quick slumber at night. She staked all on present occupation and the truth of
flying time.

CHAPTER IX

The latter part of September Carley returned to New York.

Soon after her arrival she received by letter a formal proposal of marriage from Elbert Harrington,
who had been quietly attentive to her during her sojourn at Lake Placid. He was a lawyer of
distinction, somewhat older than most of her friends, and a man of means and fine family. Carley
was quite surprised. Harrington was really one of the few of her acquaintances whom she regarded
as somewhat behind the times, and liked him the better for that. But she could not marry him,
and replied to his letter in as kindly a manner as possible. Then he called personally.

"Carley, I've come to ask you to reconsider," he said, with a smile in his gray eyes. He was
not a tall or handsome man, but he had what women called a nice strong face.

"Elbert, you embarrass me," she replied, trying to laugh it out. "Indeed I feel honored, and
I thank you. But I can't marry you."

"Why not?" he asked, quietly.

"Because I don't love you," she replied.

"I did not expect you to," he said. "I hoped in time you might come to care. I've known you
a good many years, Carley. Forgive me if I tell you I see you are breaking--wearing yourself
down. Maybe it is not a husband you need so much now, but you do need a home and children.
You are wasting your life."

"All you say may be true, my friend," replied Carley, with a helpless little upflinging of
hands. "Yet it does not alter my feelings."

"But you will marry sooner or later?" he queried, persistently.

This straightforward question struck Carley as singularly as if it was one she might never
have encountered. It forced her to think of things she had buried.

"I don't believe I ever will," she answered, thoughtfully.

"That is nonsense, Carley," he went on. "You'll have to marry. What else can you do? With all
due respect to your feelings--that affair with Kilbourne is ended--and you're not the wishy-washy
heartbreak kind of a girl."

"You can never tell what a woman will do," she said, somewhat coldly.

"Certainly not. That's why I refuse to take no. Carley, be reasonable. You like me--respect
me, do you not?"

"Why, of course I do!"

"I'm only thirty-five, and I could give you all any sensible woman wants," he said. "Let's
make a real American home. Have you thought at all about that, Carley? Something is wrong today.
Men are not marrying. Wives are not having children. Of all the friends I have, not one has
a real American home. Why, it is a terrible fact! But, Carley, you are not a sentimentalist,
or a melancholiac. Nor are you a waster. You have fine qualities. You need something to do,
some one to care for."

"Pray do not think me ungrateful, Elbert," she replied, "nor insensible to the truth of what
you say. But my answer is no!"

When Harrington had gone Carley went to her room, and precisely as upon her return from Arizona
she faced her mirror skeptically and relentlessly. "I am such a liar that I'll do well to look
at myself," she meditated. "Here I am again. Now! The world expects me to marry. But what do
I expect?"

There was a raw unheated wound in Carley's heart. Seldom had she permitted herself to think
about it, let alone to probe it with hard materialistic queries. But custom to her was as inexorable
as life. If she chose to live in the world she must conform to its customs. For a woman marriage
was the aim and the end and the all of existence. Nevertheless, for Carley it could not be
without love. Before she had gone West she might have had many of the conventional modern ideas
about women and marriage. But because out there in the wilds her love and perception had broadened,
now her arraignment of herself and her sex was bigger, sterner, more exacting. The months she
had been home seemed fuller than all the months of her life. She had tried to forget and enjoy;
she had not succeeded; but she had looked with far-seeing eyes at her world. Glenn Kilbourne's
tragic fate had opened her eyes.

Either the world was all wrong or the people in it were. But if that were an extravagant and
erroneous supposition, there certainly was proof positive that her own small individual world
was wrong. The women did not do any real work; they did not bear children; they lived on excitement
and luxury. They had no ideals. How greatly were men to blame? Carley doubted her judgment
here. But as men could not live without the smiles and comradeship and love of women, it was
only natural that they should give the women what they wanted. Indeed, they had no choice.
It was give or go without. How much of real love entered into the marriages among her acquaintances?
Before marriage Carley wanted a girl to be sweet, proud, aloof, with a heart of golden fire.
Not attainable except through love! It would be better that no children be born at all unless
born of such beautiful love. Perhaps that was why so few children were born. Nature's balance
and revenge! In Arizona Carley had learned something of the ruthlessness and inevitableness
of nature. She was finding out she had learned this with many other staggering facts.

"I love Glenn still," she whispered, passionately, with trembling lips, as she faced the tragic-eyed
image of herself in the mirror. "I love him more--more. Oh, my God! If I were honest I'd cry
out the truth! It is terrible. ... I will always love him. How then could I marry any other
man? I would be a lie, a cheat. If I could only forget him--only kill that love. Then I might
love another man--and if I did love him--no matter what I had felt or done before, I would
be worthy. I could feel worthy. I could give him just as much. But without such love I'd give
only a husk--a body without soul."

Love, then, was the sacred and holy flame of life that sanctioned the begetting of children.
Marriage might be a necessity of modern time, but it was not the vital issue. Carley's anguish
revealed strange and hidden truths. In some inexplicable way Nature struck a terrible balance--revenged
herself upon a people who had no children, or who brought into the world children not created
by the divinity of love, unyearned for, and therefore somehow doomed to carry on the blunders
and burdens of life.

Carley realized how right and true it might be for her to throw herself away upon an inferior
man, even a fool or a knave, if she loved him with that great and natural love of woman; likewise
it dawned upon her how false and wrong and sinful it would be to marry the greatest or the
richest or the noblest man unless she had that supreme love to give him, and knew it was reciprocated.

"What am I going to do with my life?" she asked, bitterly and aghast. "I have been--I am a
waster. I've lived for nothing but pleasurable sensation. I'm utterly useless. I do absolutely
no good on earth."

Thus she saw how Harrington's words rang true--how they had precipitated a crisis for which
her unconscious brooding had long made preparation.

"Why not give up ideals and be like the rest of my kind?" she soliloquized.

That was one of the things which seemed wrong with modern life. She thrust the thought from
her with passionate scorn. If poor, broken, ruined Glenn Kilbourne could cling to an ideal
and fight for it, could not she, who had all the world esteemed worth while, be woman enough
to do the same? The direction of her thought seemed to have changed. She had been ready for
rebellion. Three months of the old life had shown her that for her it was empty, vain, farcical,
without one redeeming feature. The naked truth was brutal, but it cut clean to wholesome consciousness.
Such so-called social life as she had plunged into deliberately to forget her unhappiness had
failed her utterly. If she had been shallow and frivolous it might have done otherwise. Stripped
of all guise, her actions must have been construed by a penetrating and impartial judge as
a mere parading of her decorated person before a number of males with the purpose of ultimate
selection.

"I've got to find some work," she muttered, soberly.

At the moment she heard the postman's whistle outside; and a little later the servant brought
up her mail. The first letter, large, soiled, thick, bore the postmark Flagstaff, and her address
in Glenn Kilbourne's writing.

Carley stared at it. Her heart gave a great leap. Her hand shook. She sat down suddenly as
if the strength of her legs was inadequate to uphold her.

"Glenn has--written me!" she whispered, in slow, halting realization. "For what? Oh, why?"

The other letters fell off her lap, to lie unnoticed. This big thick envelope fascinated her.
It was one of the stamped envelopes she had seen in his cabin. It contained a letter that had
been written on his rude table, before the open fire, in the light of the doorway, in that
little log-cabin under the spreading pines of West Ford Canyon. Dared she read it? The shock
to her heart passed; and with mounting swell, seemingly too full for her breast, it began to
beat and throb a wild gladness through all her being. She tore the envelope apart and read:

DEAR CARLEY:

I'm surely glad for a good excuse to write you.

Once in a blue moon I get a letter, and today Hutter brought me one from a soldier pard of
mine who was with me in the Argonne. His name is Virgil Rust--queer name, don't you think?--and
he's from Wisconsin. Just a rough-diamond sort of chap, but fairly well educated. He and I
were in some pretty hot places, and it was he who pulled me out of a shell crater. I'd "gone
west" sure then if it hadn't been for Rust.

Well, he did all sorts of big things during the war. Was down several times with wounds. He
liked to fight and he was a holy terror. We all thought he'd get medals and promotion. But
he didn't get either. These much-desired things did not always go where they were best deserved.

Rust is now lying in a hospital in Bedford Park. His letter is pretty blue. All he says about
why he's there is that he's knocked out. But he wrote a heap about his girl. It seems he was
in love with a girl in his home town--a pretty, big-eyed lass whose picture I've seen--and
while he was overseas she married one of the chaps who got out of fighting. Evidently Rust
is deeply hurt. He wrote: "I'd not care so... if she'd thrown me down to marry an old man or
a boy who couldn't have gone to war." You see, Carley, service men feel queer about that sort
of thing. It's something we got over there, and none of us will ever outlive it. Now, the point
of this is that I am asking you to go see Rust, and cheer him up, and do what you can for the
poor devil. It's a good deal to ask of you, I know, especially as Rust saw your picture many
a time and knows you were my girl. But you needn't tell him that you--we couldn't make a go of it.

And, as I am writing this to you, I see no reason why I shouldn't go on in behalf of myself.

The fact is, Carley, I miss writing to you more than I miss anything of my old life. I'll bet
you have a trunkful of letters from me--unless you've destroyed them. I'm not going to say
how I miss your letters. But I will say you wrote the most charming and fascinating letters
of anyone I ever knew, quite aside from any sentiment. You knew, of course, that I had no other
girl correspondent. Well, I got along fairly well before you came West, but I'd be an awful
liar if I denied I didn't get lonely for you and your letters. It's different now that you've
been to Oak Creek. I'm alone most of the time and I dream a lot, and I'm afraid I see you here
in my cabin, and along the brook, and under the pines, and riding Calico--which you came to
do well--and on my hogpen fence--and, oh, everywhere! I don't want you to think I'm down in
the mouth, for I'm not. I'll take my medicine. But, Carley, you spoiled me, and I miss hearing
from you, and I don't see why it wouldn't be all right for you to send me a friendly letter
occasionally.

It is autumn now. I wish you could see Arizona canyons in their gorgeous colors. We have had
frost right along and the mornings are great. There's a broad zigzag belt of gold halfway up
the San Francisco peaks, and that is the aspen thickets taking on their fall coat. Here in
the canyon you'd think there was blazing fire everywhere. The vines and the maples are red,
scarlet, carmine, cerise, magenta, all the hues of flame. The oak leaves are turning russet
gold, and the sycamores are yellow green. Up on the desert the other day I rode across a patch
of asters, lilac and lavender, almost purple. I had to get off and pluck a handful. And then
what do you think? I dug up the whole bunch, roots and all, and planted them on the sunny side
of my cabin. I rather guess your love of flowers engendered this remarkable susceptibility in me.

I'm home early most every afternoon now, and I like the couple of hours loafing around. Guess
it's bad for me, though. You know I seldom hunt, and the trout in the pool here are so tame
now they'll almost eat out of my hand. I haven't the heart to fish for them. The squirrels,
too, have grown tame and friendly. There's a red squirrel that climbs up on my table. And there's
a chipmunk who lives in my cabin and runs over my bed. I've a new pet--the little pig you christened
Pinky. After he had the wonderful good fortune to be caressed and named by you I couldn't think
of letting him grow up in an ordinary piglike manner. So I fetched him home. My dog, Moze,
was jealous at first and did not like this intrusion, but now they are good friends and sleep
together. Flo has a kitten she's going to give me, and then, as Hutter says, I'll be "Jake."

My occupation during these leisure hours perhaps would strike my old friends East as idle,
silly, mawkish. But I believe you will understand me.

I have the pleasure of doing nothing, and of catching now and then a glimpse of supreme joy
in the strange state of thinking nothing. Tennyson came close to this in his "Lotus Eaters."
Only to see--only to feel is enough!

Sprawled on the warm sweet pine needles, I breathe through them the breath of the earth and
am somehow no longer lonely. I cannot, of course, see the sunset, but I watch for its coming
on the eastern wall of the canyon. I see the shadow slowly creep up, driving the gold before
it, until at last the canyon rim and pines are turned to golden fire. I watch the sailing eagles
as they streak across the gold, and swoop up into the blue, and pass out of sight. I watch
the golden flush fade to gray, and then, the canyon slowly fills with purple shadows. This
hour of twilight is the silent and melancholy one. Seldom is there any sound save the soft
rush of the water over the stones, and that seems to die away. For a moment, perhaps, I am
Hiawatha alone in his forest home, or a more primitive savage, feeling the great, silent pulse
of nature, happy in unconsciousness, like a beast of the wild. But only for an instant do I
ever catch this fleeting state. Next I am Glenn Kilbourne of West Fork, doomed and haunted
by memories of the past. The great looming walls then become no longer blank. They are vast
pages of the history of my life, with its past and present, and, alas! its future. Everything
time does is written on the stones. And my stream seems to murmur the sad and ceaseless flow
of human life, with its music and its misery.

Then, descending from the sublime to the humdrum and necessary, I heave a sigh, and pull myself
together, and go in to make biscuits and fry ham. But I should not forget to tell you that
before I do go in, very often my looming, wonderful walls and crags weave in strange shadowy
characters the beautiful and unforgettable face of Carley Burch!

I append what little news Oak Creek affords.

That blamed old bald eagle stole another of my pigs.

I am doing so well with my hog-raising that Hutter wants to come in with me, giving me an interest
in his sheep.

It is rumored some one has bought the Deep Lake section I wanted for a ranch. I don't know
who. Hutter was rather noncommittal.

Charley, the herder, had one of his queer spells the other day, and swore to me he had a letter
from you. He told the blamed lie with a sincere and placid eye, and even a smile of pride.
Queer guy, that Charley!

Flo and Lee Stanton had another quarrel--the worst yet, Lee tells me. Flo asked a girl friend
out from Flag and threw her in Lee's way, so to speak, and when Lee retaliated by making love
to the girl Flo got mad. Funny creatures, you girls! Flo rode with me from High Falls to West
Fork, and never showed the slightest sign of trouble. In fact she was delightfully gay. She
rode Calico, and beat me bad in a race.

Adios, Carley. Won't you write me?

GLENN.

No sooner had Carley read the letter through to the end than she began it all over again, and
on this second perusal she lingered over passages--only to reread them. That suggestion of
her face sculptured by shadows on the canyon walls seemed to thrill her very soul.

She leaped up from the reading to cry out something that was unutterable. All the intervening
weeks of shame and anguish and fury and strife and pathos, and the endless striving to forget,
were as if by the magic of a letter made nothing but vain oblations.

"He loves me still!" she whispered, and pressed her breast with clenching hands, and laughed
in wild exultance, and paced her room like a caged lioness. It was as if she had just awakened
to the assurance she was beloved. That was the shibboleth--the cry by which she sounded the
closed depths of her love and called to the stricken life of a woman's insatiate vanity.

Then she snatched up the letter, to scan it again, and, suddenly grasping the import of Glenn's
request, she hurried to the telephone to find the number of the hospital in Bedford Park. A
nurse informed her that visitors were received at certain hours and that any attention to disabled
soldiers was most welcome.

Carley motored out there to find the hospital merely a long one-story frame structure, a barracks
hastily thrown up for the care of invalided men of the service. The chauffeur informed her
that it had been used for that purpose during the training period of the army, and later when
injured soldiers began to arrive from France.

A nurse admitted Carley into a small bare anteroom. Carley made known her errand.

"I'm glad it's Rust you want to see," replied the nurse. "Some of these boys are going to die.
And some will be worse off if they live. But Rust may get well if he'll only behave. You are
a relative--or friend?"

"I don't know him," answered Carley. "But I have a friend who was with him in France."

The nurse led Carley into a long narrow room with a line of single beds down each side, a stove
at each end, and a few chairs. Each bed appeared to have an occupant and those nearest Carley
lay singularly quiet. At the far end of the room were soldiers on crutches, wearing bandages
on their beads, carrying their arms in slings. Their merry voices contrasted discordantly with
their sad appearance.

Presently Carley stood beside a bed and looked down upon a gaunt, haggard young man who lay
propped up on pillows.

"Rust--a lady to see you," announced the nurse.

Carley had difficulty in introducing herself. Had Glenn ever looked like this? What a face!
It's healed scar only emphasized the pallor and furrows of pain that assuredly came from present
wounds. He had unnaturally bright dark eyes, and a flush of fever in his hollow cheeks.

"How do!" he said, with a wan smile. "Who're you?"

"I'm Glenn Kilbourne's fiancee," she replied, holding out her hand.

"Say, I ought to've known you," he said, eagerly, and a warmth of light changed the gray shade
of his face. "You're the girl Carley! You're almost like my--my own girl. By golly! You're
some looker! It was good of you to come. Tell me about Glenn."

Carley took the chair brought by the nurse, and pulling it close to the bed, she smiled down
upon him and said: "I'll be glad to tell you all I know--presently. But first you tell me about
yourself. Are you in pain? What is your trouble? You must let me do everything I can for you,
and these other men."

Carley spent a poignant and depth-stirring hour at the bedside of Glenn's comrade. At last
she learned from loyal lips the nature of Glenn Kilbourne's service to his country. How Carley
clasped to her sore heart the praise of the man she loved--the simple proofs of his noble disregard
of self! Rust said little about his own service to country or to comrade. But Carley saw enough
in his face. He had been like Glenn. By these two Carley grasped the compelling truth of the
spirit and sacrifice of the legion of boys who had upheld American traditions. Their children
and their children's children, as the years rolled by into the future, would hold their heads
higher and prouder. Some things could never die in the hearts and the blood of a race. These
boys, and the girls who had the supreme glory of being loved by them, must be the ones to revive
the Americanism of their forefathers. Nature and God would take care of the slackers, the cowards
who cloaked their shame with bland excuses of home service, of disability, and of dependence.

Carley saw two forces in life--the destructive and constructive. On the one side greed, selfishness,
materialism: on the other generosity, sacrifice, and idealism. Which of them builded for the
future? She saw men as wolves, sharks, snakes, vermin, and opposed to them men as lions and
eagles. She saw women who did not inspire men to fare forth to seek, to imagine, to dream,
to hope, to work, to fight. She began to have a glimmering of what a woman might be.

That night she wrote swiftly and feverishly, page after page, to Glenn, only to destroy what
she had written. She could not keep her heart out of her words, nor a hint of what was becoming
a sleepless and eternal regret. She wrote until a late hour, and at last composed a letter
she knew did not ring true, so stilted and restrained was it in all passages save those concerning
news of Glenn's comrade and of her own friends. "I'll never--never write him again," she averred
with stiff lips, and next moment could have laughed in mockery at the bitter truth. If she
had ever had any courage, Glenn's letter had destroyed it. But had it not been a kind of selfish,
false courage, roused to hide her hurt, to save her own future? Courage should have a thought
of others. Yet shamed one moment at the consciousness she would write Glenn again and again,
and exultant the next with the clamouring love, she seemed to have climbed beyond the self
that had striven to forget. She would remember and think though she died of longing.

Carley, like a drowning woman, caught at straws. What a relief and joy to give up that endless
nagging at her mind! For months she had kept ceaselessly active, by associations which were
of no help to her and which did not make her happy, in her determination to forget. Suddenly
then she gave up to remembrance. She would cease trying to get over her love for Glenn, and
think of him and dream about him as much as memory dictated. This must constitute the only
happiness she could have.

The change from strife to surrender was so novel and sweet that for days she felt renewed.
It was augmented by her visits to the hospital in Bedford Park. Through her bountiful presence
Virgil Rust and his comrades had many dull hours of pain and weariness alleviated and brightened.
Interesting herself in the condition of the seriously disabled soldiers and possibility of
their future took time and work Carley gave willingly and gladly. At first she endeavored to
get acquaintances with means and leisure to help the boys, but these overtures met with such
little success that she quit wasting valuable time she could herself devote to their interests.

Thus several weeks swiftly passed by. Several soldiers who had been more seriously injured
than Rust improved to the extent that they were discharged. But Rust gained little or nothing.
The nurse and doctor both informed Carley that Rust brightened for her, but when she was gone
he lapsed into somber indifference. He did not care whether he ate or not, or whether he got
well or died.

"If I do pull out, where'll I go and what'll I do?" he once asked the nurse.

Carley knew that Rust's hurt was more than loss of a leg, and she decided to talk earnestly
to him and try to win him to hope and effort. He had come to have a sort of reverence for her.
So, biding her time, she at length found opportunity to approach his bed while his comrades
were asleep or out of hearing. He endeavored to laugh her off, and then tried subterfuge, and
lastly he cast off his mask and let her see his naked soul.

"Carley, I don't want your money or that of your kind friends--whoever they are--you say will
help me to get into business," he said. "God knows I thank you and it warms me inside to find
some one who appreciates what I've given. But I don't want charity.... And I guess I'm pretty
sick of the game. I'm sorry the Boches didn't do the job right."

"Rust, that is morbid talk," replied Carley. "You're ill and you just can't see any hope. You
must cheer up--fight yourself; and look at the brighter side. It's a horrible pity you must
be a cripple, but Rust, indeed life can be worth living if you make it so."

"How could there be a brighter side when a man's only half a man--" he queried, bitterly.

"You can be just as much a man as ever," persisted Carley, trying to smile when she wanted to cry.

"Could you care for a man with only one leg?" he asked, deliberately.

"What a question! Why, of course I could!"

"Well, maybe you are different. Glenn always swore even if he was killed no slacker or no rich
guy left at home could ever get you. Maybe you haven't any idea how much it means to us fellows
to know there are true and faithful girls. But I'll tell you, Carley, we fellows who went across
got to see things strange when we came home. The good old U. S. needs a lot of faithful girls
just now, believe me."

"Indeed that's true," replied Carley. "It's a hard time for everybody, and particularly you
boys who have lost so--so much."

"I lost all, except my life--and I wish to God I'd lost that," he replied, gloomily.

"Oh, don't talk so!" implored Carley in distress. "Forgive me, Rust, if I hurt you. But I must
tell you--that--that Glenn wrote me--you'd lost your girl. Oh, I'm sorry! It is dreadful for
you now. But if you got well--and went to work--and took up life where you left it--why soon
your pain would grow easier. And you'd find some happiness yet."

"Never for me in this world."

"But why, Rust, why? You're no--no--Oh! I mean you have intelligence and courage. Why isn't
there anything left for you?"

"Because something here's been killed," he replied, and put his hand to his heart.

"Your faith? Your love of--of everything? Did the war kill it?"

"I'd gotten over that, maybe," he said, drearily, with his somber eyes on space that seemed
lettered for him. "But she half murdered it--and they did the rest."

"They? Whom do you mean, Rust?"

"Why, Carley, I mean the people I lost my leg for!" he replied, with terrible softness.

"The British? The French?" she queried, in bewilderment.

"No!" he cried, and turned his face to the wall.

Carley dared not ask him more. She was shocked. How helplessly impotent all her earnest sympathy!
No longer could she feel an impersonal, however kindly, interest in this man. His last ringing
word had linked her also to his misfortune and his suffering. Suddenly he turned away from
the wall. She saw him swallow laboriously. How tragic that thin, shadowed face of agony! Carley
saw it differently. But for the beautiful softness of light in his eyes, she would have been
unable to endure gazing longer.

"Carley, I'm bitter," he said, "but I'm not rancorous and callous, like some of the boys. I
know if you'd been my girl you'd have stuck to me."

"Yes," Carley whispered.

"That makes a difference," he went on, with a sad smile. "You see, we soldiers all had feelings.
And in one thing we all felt alike. That was we were going to fight for our homes and our women.
I should say women first. No matter what we read or heard about standing by our allies, fighting
for liberty or civilization, the truth was we all felt the same, even if we never breathed
it.... Glenn fought for you. I fought for Nell.... We were not going to let the Huns treat
you as they treated French and Belgian girls.... And think! Nell was engaged to me--she loved
me--and, by God! She married a slacker when I lay half dead on the battlefield!"

"She was not worth loving or fighting for," said Carley, with agitation.

"Ah! now you've said something," he declared. "If I can only hold to that truth! What does
one girl amount to? I do not count. It is the sum that counts. We love America--our homes--our
women!... Carley, I've had comfort and strength come to me through you. Glenn will have his
reward in your love. Somehow I seem to share it, a little. Poor Glenn! He got his, too. Why,
Carley, that guy wouldn't let you do what he could do for you. He was cut to pieces--"

"Please--Rust--don't say any more. I am unstrung," she pleaded.

"Why not? It's due you to know how splendid Glenn was.... I tell you, Carley, all the boys
here love you for the way you've stuck to Glenn. Some of them knew him, and I've told the rest.
We thought he'd never pull through. But he has, and we know how you helped. Going West to see
him! He didn't write it to me, but I know.... I'm wise. I'm happy for him--the lucky dog. Next
time you go West--"

"Hush!" cried Carley. She could endure no more. She could no longer be a lie.

"You're white--you're shaking," exclaimed Rust, in concern. "Oh, I--what did I say? Forgive me--"

"Rust, I am no more worth loving and fighting for than your Nell."

"What!" he ejaculated.

"I have not told you the truth," she said, swiftly. "I have let you believe a lie.... I shall
never marry Glenn. I broke my engagement to him."

Slowly Rust sank back upon the pillow, his large luminous eyes piercingly fixed upon her, as
if he would read her soul.

"I went West--yes--" continued Carley. "But it was selfishly. I wanted Glenn to come back here....
He had suffered as you have. He nearly died. But he fought--he fought--Oh! he went through
hell! And after a long, slow, horrible struggle he began to mend. He worked. He went to raising
hogs. He lived alone. He worked harder and harder.... The West and his work saved him, body
and soul.... He had learned to love both the West and his work. I did not blame him. But I
could not live out there. He needed me. But I was too little--too selfish. I could not marry
him. I gave him up. ... I left--him--alone!"

Carley shrank under the scorn in Rust's eyes.

"And there's another man," he said, "a clean, straight, unscarred fellow who wouldn't fight!"

"Oh, no-I--I swear there's not," whispered Carley.

"You, too," he replied, thickly. Then slowly he turned that worn dark face to the wall. His
frail breast heaved. And his lean hand made her a slight gesture of dismissal, significant
and imperious.

Carley fled. She could scarcely see to find the car. All her internal being seemed convulsed,
and a deadly faintness made her sick and cold.

CHAPTER X

Carley's edifice of hopes, dreams, aspirations, and struggles fell in ruins about her. It had
been built upon false sands. It had no ideal for foundation. It had to fall.

Something inevitable had forced her confession to Rust. Dissimulation had been a habit of her
mind; it was more a habit of her class than sincerity. But she had reached a point in her mental
strife where she could not stand before Rust and let him believe she was noble and faithful
when she knew she was neither. Would not the next step in this painful metamorphosis of her
character be a fierce and passionate repudiation of herself and all she represented?

She went home and locked herself in her room, deaf to telephone and servants. There she gave
up to her shame. Scorned--despised--dismissed by that poor crippled flame-spirited Virgil Rust! 4to.,
Paris, 1724.) He farther tells us that Vasco Nuñez de Balbao met many of them, and in the fury of his religious zeal had them
torn to pieces by dogs. Was this in Darien? I believe neither Heckewelder, Adair, Colden,
nor J. Dunn Hunter, mention this subject, though they must all have been aware of the existence
of Enareans in some one or more of the tribes with which they were acquainted; and I do not
remember having ever met with mention of them among the Indian nations of New England, and
Tanner testifies to their existence amongst the Chepewa and Ottawa nations, by whom they are called
A-go-kwa. Catlin met with them among the Sioux, and gives a sketch
of a dance in honour of the I-coo-coo, as they call them.

Southey speaks of them among the Guayacuru under the name of "Cudinas," and so does Von Martius.
Captain Fitzroy, quoting the Jesuit Falkner, says the Patagonian wizards (query priests) are
dressed in female attire: they are chosen for the office when young,
preference being given to boys evincing a feminine disposition.

Lafitau's conjecture as to the connexion between these American Enareans and the worshippers
of Venus Urania, seems to receive some confirmation from our next evidence, viz. in Major Long's
Expedition to St. Peter's River, some of these people were met with, and inquiry being made
concerning them, it was ascertained that--

"The Indians believe the moon is the residence of a hostile female deity, and should she appear
to them in their dreams, it is an injunction to become Cinædi, and they immediately assume
feminine attire."--Vol. i. p. 216.

Farther it is stated, that two of these people whom they found among the Sauks, though generally
held in contempt, were pitied by many--

"As labouring under an unfortunate destiny that they cannot avoid, being supposed to be impelled
to this course by a vision from the female spirit that resides in the moon," &c.--Vol. i. p.
227.

Venus Urania is placed among the Scythian deities by Herodotus, under the name "Artimpasa." We are,
for obvious reasons, at liberty to conjecture that the adoption of her worship, and the development
of "the female disease," may have been contemporaneous, or nearly so. It were needless entering
on a long story to show the connexion between Venus and the moon, which was styled Urania, Juno,
Jana, Diana, Venus, &c. Should it be conceded that the American Mongolidæ
brought with them this curse of Scythia, the date of their emigration
will be approximated, since it must have taken place subsequently
to the affair of Ascalon, or between 400 or 500 years B.C.

The adoption
of female attire by the priesthood, however, was not confined to the
worshippers of Venus Urania; it was widely spread throughout Heathendom;
so widely that, as we learn from Tacitus, the priests of the Naharvali
(in modern Denmark) officiated in the dress of women.

Like many other heathenish customs and costumes, traces of this have descended to our own times;
such, for example, may have been the exchange of dresses on New Year's Eve, &c.: see Drake's Shakspeare
and his Times, vol. i. p. 124., ed. 4to.

And what else is the effeminate costume of the clergy in many parts of Europe, the girded
waist, and the petticoat-like cassock, but a relique {103} of the ancient priestly predilection
for female attire?

Minor Notes.

Russia and Turkey.--The following paragraph
from an old newspaper reads with a strange significance at the present
time:

"The last advices from Leghorn describe the genius of discord
still prevailing in the unfortunate city of Constantinople, the people
clamouring against their rulers, and the janissaries ripe for insurrection,
in consequence of the backwardness of the Porte to commence hostilities
with Russia."--English Chronicle, or Universal Evening Post, February
6th to 8th, 1783. He had seen in Carley Burch the paraded charm, the unashamed and
serene front, the woman seeking man. Haze Ruff had been neither vile nor base nor unnatural.
It had been her subjection to the decadence of feminine dress that had been unnatural. But
Ruff had found her a lie. She invited what she did not want. And his scorn had been commensurate
with the falsehood of her. So might any man have been justified in his insult to her, in his
rejection of her. Haze Ruff had found her unfit for his idea of dalliance. Virgil Rust had
found her false to the ideals of womanhood for which he had sacrificed all but life itself.
What then had Glenn Kilbourne found her? He possessed the greatness of noble love. He had loved
her before the dark and changeful tide of war had come between them. How had he judged her?
That last sight of him standing alone, leaning with head bowed, a solitary figure trenchant
with suggestion of tragic resignation and strength, returned to flay Carley. He had loved,
trusted, and hoped. She saw now what his hope had been--that she would have instilled into
her blood the subtle, red, and revivifying essence of calling life in the open, the strength
of the wives of earlier years, an emanation from canyon, desert, mountain, forest, of health,
of spirit, of forward-gazing natural love, of the mysterious saving instinct he had gotten
out of the West. And she had been too little too steeped in the indulgence of luxurious life
too slight-natured and pale-blooded! And suddenly there pierced into the black storm of Carley's
mind a blazing, white-streaked thought--she had left Glenn to the Western girl, Flo Hutter.
Humiliated, and abased in her own sight, Carley fell prey to a fury of jealousy.

She went back to the old life. But it was in a bitter, restless, critical spirit, conscious
of the fact that she could derive neither forgetfulness nor pleasure from it, nor see any release
from the habit of years.

One afternoon, late in the fall, she motored out to a Long Island club where the last of the
season's golf was being enjoyed by some of her most intimate friends. Carley did not play.
Aimlessly she walked around the grounds, finding the autumn colors subdued and drab, like her
mind. The air held a promise of early winter. She thought that she would go South before the
cold came. Always trying to escape anything rigorous, hard, painful, or disagreeable! Later
she returned to the clubhouse to find her party assembled on an inclosed porch, chatting and
partaking of refreshment. Morrison was there. He had not taken kindly to her late habit of
denying herself to him.

During a lull in the idle conversation Morrison addressed Carley pointedly. "Well, Carley,
how's your Arizona hog-raiser?" he queried, with a little gleam in his usually lusterless eyes.

"I have not heard lately," she replied, coldly.

The assembled company suddenly quieted with a portent inimical to their leisurely content of
the moment. Carley felt them all looking at her, and underneath the exterior she preserved
with extreme difficulty, there burned so fierce an anger that she seemed to have swelling veins
of fire.

"Queer how Kilbourne went into raising hogs," observed Morrison. "Such a low-down sort of work,
you know."

"He had no choice," replied Carley. "Glenn didn't have a father who made tainted millions out
of the war. He had to work. And I must differ with you about its being low-down. No honest
work is that. It is idleness that is low down."

"But so foolish of Glenn when he might have married money," rejoined Morrison, sarcastcally.

"The honor of soldiers is beyond your ken, Mr. Morrison."

He flushed darkly and bit his lip.

"You women make a man sick with this rot about soldiers," he said, the gleam in his eye growing
ugly. "A uniform goes to a woman's head no matter what's inside it. I don't see where your
vaunted honor of soldiers comes in considering how they accepted the let-down of women during
and after the war."

"How could you see when you stayed comfortably at home?" retorted Carley.

"All I could see was women falling into soldiers' arms," he said, sullenly.

"Certainly. Could an American girl desire any greater happiness--or opportunity to prove her
gratitude?" flashed Carley, with proud uplift of head.

"It didn't look like gratitude to me," returned Morrison.

"Well, it was gratitude," declared Carley, ringingly. "If women of America did throw themselves
at soldiers it was not owing to the moral lapse of the day. It was woman's instinct to save
the race! Always, in every war, women have sacrificed themselves to the future. Not vile, but
noble!... You insult both soldiers and women, Mr. Morrison. I wonder--did any American girls
throw themselves at you?"

Morrison turned a dead white, and his mouth twisted to a distorted checking of speech, disagreeable
to see.

"No, you were a slacker," went on Carley, with scathing scorn. "You let the other men go fight
for American girls. Do you imagine one of them will ever marry you?... All your life, Mr. Morrison,
you will be a marked man--outside the pale of friendship with real American men and the respect
of real American girls."

Morrison leaped up, almost knocking the table over, and he glared at Carley as he gathered
up his hat and cane. She turned her back upon him. From that moment he ceased to exist for
Carley. She never spoke to him again.

Next day Carley called upon her dearest friend, whom she had not seen for some time.

"Carley dear, you don't look so very well," said Eleanor, after greetings had been exchanged.

"Oh, what does it matter how I look?" queried Carley, impatiently.

"You were so wonderful when you got home from Arizona."

"If I was wonderful and am now commonplace you can thank your old New York for it."

"Carley, don't you care for New York any more?" asked Eleanor.

"Oh, New York is all right, I suppose. It's I who am wrong."

"My dear, you puzzle me these days. You've changed. I'm sorry. I'm afraid you're unhappy."

"Me? Oh, impossible! I'm in a seventh heaven," replied Carley, with a hard little laugh. "What
're you doing this afternoon? Let's go out--riding--or somewhere."

"I'm expecting the dressmaker."

"Where are you going to-night?"

"Dinner and theater. It's a party, or I'd ask you."

"What did you do yesterday and the day before, and the days before that?"

Eleanor laughed indulgently, and acquainted Carley with a record of her social wanderings during
the last few days.

"The same old things--over and over again! Eleanor don't you get sick of it?" queried Carley.

"Oh yes, to tell the truth," returned Eleanor, thoughtfully. "But there's nothing else to do."

"Eleanor, I'm no better than you," said Carley, with disdain. "I'm as useless and idle. But
I'm beginning to see myself--and you--and all this rotten crowd of ours. We're no good. But
you're married, Eleanor. You're settled in life. You ought to do something. I'm single and
at loose ends. Oh, I'm in revolt!... Think, Eleanor, just think. Your husband works hard to
keep you in this expensive apartment. You have a car. He dresses you in silks and satins. You
wear diamonds. You eat your breakfast in bed. You loll around in a pink dressing gown all morning.
You dress for lunch or tea. You ride or golf or worse than waste your time on some lounge lizard,
dancing till time to come home to dress for dinner. You let other men make love to you. Oh,
don't get sore. You do.... And so goes the round of your life. What good on earth are you,
anyhow? You're just a--a gratification to the senses of your husband. And at that you don't
see much of him."

"Carley, how you rave!" exclaimed her friend. "What has gotten into you lately? Why, everybody
tells me you're--you're queer! The way you insulted Morrison--how unlike you, Carley!"

"I'm glad I found the nerve to do it. What do you think, Eleanor?"

"Oh, I despise him. But you can't say the things you feel."

"You'd be bigger and truer if you did. Some day I'll break out and flay you and your friends
alive."

"But, Carley, you're my friend and you're just exactly like we are. Or you were, quite recently."

"Of course, I'm your friend. I've always loved you, Eleanor," went on Carley, earnestly. "I'm
as deep in this--this damned stagnant muck as you, or anyone. But I'm no longer blind. There's
something terribly wrong with us women, and it's not what Morrison hinted."

"Carley, the only thing wrong with you is that you jilted poor Glenn--and are breaking your
heart over him still."

"Don't--don't!" cried Carley, shrinking. "God knows that is true. But there's more wrong with
me than a blighted love affair."

"Yes, you mean the modern feminine unrest?"

"Eleanor, I positively hate that phrase 'modern feminine unrest!' It smacks of ultra--ultra--Oh!
I don't know what. That phrase ought to be translated by a Western acquaintance of mine--one
Haze Ruff. I'd not like to hurt your sensitive feelings with what he'd say. But this unrest
means speed-mad, excitement-mad, fad-mad, dress-mad, or I should say undress-mad, culture-mad,
and Heaven only knows what else. The women of our set are idle, luxurious, selfish, pleasure-craving,
lazy, useless, work-and-children shirking, absolutely no good."

"Well, if we are, who's to blame?" rejoined Eleanor, spiritedly. "Now, Carley Burch, you listen
to me. I think the twentieth-century girl in America is the most wonderful female creation
of all the ages of the universe. I admit it. That is why we are a prey to the evils attending
greatness. Listen. Here is a crying sin--an infernal paradox. Take this twentieth-century girl,
this American girl who is the finest creation of the ages. A young and healthy girl, the most
perfect type of culture possible to the freest and greatest city on earth--New York! She holds
absolutely an unreal, untrue position in the scheme of existence. Surrounded by parents, relatives,
friends, suitors, and instructive schools of every kind, colleges, institutions, is she really
happy, is she really living?"

"Eleanor," interrupted Carley, earnestly, "she is not.... And I've been trying to tell you why."

"My dear, let me get a word in, will you," complained Eleanor. "You don't know it all. There
are as many different points of view as there are people.... Well, if this girl happened to
have a new frock, and a new beau to show it to, she'd say, 'I'm the happiest girl in the world.'
But she is nothing of the kind. Only she doesn't know that. She approaches marriage, or, for
that matter, a more matured life, having had too much, having been too well taken care of,
knowing too much. Her masculine satellites--father, brothers, uncles, friends, lovers--all
utterly spoil her. Mind you, I mean, girls like us, of the middle class--which is to say the
largest and best class of Americans. We are spoiled.... This girl marries. And life goes on
smoothly, as if its aim was to exclude friction and effort. Her husband makes it too easy for
her. She is an ornament, or a toy, to be kept in a luxurious cage. To soil her pretty hands
would be disgraceful! Even f she can't afford a maid, the modern devices of science make the
care of her four-room apartment a farce. Electric dish-washer, clothes-washer, vacuum-cleaner,
and the near-by delicatessen and the caterer simply rob a young wife of her housewifely heritage.
If she has a baby--which happens occasionally, Carley, in spite of your assertion--it very
soon goes to the kindergarten. Then what does she find to do with hours and hours? If she is
not married, what on earth can she find to do?"

"She can work," replied Carley, bluntly.

"Oh yes, she can, but she doesn't," went on Eleanor. "You don't work. I never did. We both
hated the idea. You're calling spades spades, Carley, but you seem to be riding a morbid, impractical
thesis. Well, our young American girl or bride goes in for being rushed or she goes in for
fads, the ultra stuff you mentioned. New York City gets all the great artists, lecturers, and
surely the great fakirs. The New York women support them. The men laugh, but they furnish the
money. They take the women to the theaters, but they cut out the reception to a Polish princess,
a lecture by an Indian magician and mystic, or a benefit luncheon for a Home for Friendless
Cats. The truth is most of our young girls or brides have a wonderful enthusiasm worthy of
a better cause. What is to become of their surplus energy, the bottled-lightning spirit so
characteristic of modern girls? Where is the outlet for intense feelings? What use can they
make of education or of gifts? They just can't, that's all. I'm not taking into consideration
the new-woman species, the faddist or the reformer. I mean normal girls like you and me. Just
think, Carley. A girl's every wish, every need, is almost instantly satisfied without the slightest
effort on her part to obtain it. No struggle, let alone work! If women crave to achieve something
outside of the arts, you know, something universal and helpful which will make men acknowledge
her worth, if not the equality, where is the opportunity?"

"Opportunities should be made," replied Carley.

"There are a million sides to this question of the modern young woman--the fin-de-siecle girl.
I'm for her!"

"How about the extreme of style in dress for this remarkably-to-be-pitied American girl you
champion so eloquently?" queried Carley, sarcastically.

"Immoral!" exclaimed Eleanor with frank disgust.

"You admit it?"

"To my shame, I do."

"Why do women wear extreme clothes? Why do you and I wear open-work silk stockings, skirts
to our knees, gowns without sleeves or bodices?"

"We're slaves to fashion," replied Eleanor, "That's the popular excuse."

"Bah!" exclaimed Carley.

Eleanor laughed in spite of being half nettled. "Are you going to stop wearing what all the
other women wear--and be looked at askance? Are you going to be dowdy and frumpy and old-fashioned?"

"No. But I'll never wear anything again that can be called immoral. I want to be able to say
why I wear a dress. You haven't answered my question yet. Why do you wear what you frankly
admit is disgusting?"

"I don't know, Carley," replied Eleanor, helplessly. "How you harp on things! We must dress
to make other women jealous and to attract men. To be a sensation! Perhaps the word 'immoral'
is not what I mean. A woman will be shocking in her obsession to attract, but hardly more than
that, if she knows it."

"Ah! So few women realize how they actually do look. Haze Ruff could tell them."

"Haze Ruff. Who in the world is he or she?" asked Eleanor.

"Haze Ruff is a he, all right," replied Carley, grimly.

"Well, who is he?"

"A sheep-dipper in Arizona," answered Carley, dreamily.

"Humph! And what can Mr. Ruff tell us?"

"He told me I looked like one of the devil's angels--and that I dressed to knock the daylights
out of men."

"Well, Carley Burch, if that isn't rich!" exclaimed Eleanor, with a peal of laughter. "I dare
say you appreciate that as an original compliment."

"No.... I wonder what Ruff would say about jazz--I just wonder," murmured Carley.

"Well, I wouldn't care what he said, and I don't care what you say," returned Eleanor. "The
preachers and reformers and bishops and rabbis make me sick. They rave about jazz. Jazz--the
discordant note of our decadence! Jazz--the harmonious expression of our musicless, mindless,
soulless materialism!--The idiots! If they could be women for a while they would realize the
error of their ways. But they will never, never abolish jazz--never, for it is the grandest,
the most wonderful, the most absolutely necessary thing for women in this terrible age of smotheration."

"All right, Eleanor, we understand each other, even if we do not agree," said Carley. "You
leave the future of women to chance, to life, to materialism, not to their own conscious efforts.
I want to leave it to free will and idealism."

"Carley, you are getting a little beyond me," declared Eleanor, dubiously.

"What are you going to do? It all comes home to each individual woman. Her attitude toward life."

"I'll drift along with the current, Carley, and be a good sport," replied Eleanor, smiling.

"You don't care about the women and children of the future? You'll not deny yourself now, and
think and work, and suffer a little, in the interest of future humanity?"

"How you put things, Carley!" exclaimed Eleanor, wearily. "Of course I care--when you make
me think of such things. But what have I to do with the lives of people in the years to come?"

"Everything. America for Americans! While you dawdle, the life blood is being sucked out of
our great nation. It is a man's job to fight; it is a woman's to save.... I think you've made
your choice, though you don't realize it. I'm praying to God that I'll rise to mine."

Carley had a visitor one morning earlier than the usual or conventional time for calls.

"He wouldn't give no name," said the maid. "He wears soldier clothes, ma'am, and he's pale,
and walks with a cane."

"Tell him I'll be right down," replied Carley.

Her hands trembled while she hurriedly dressed. Could this caller be Virgil Rust? She hoped
so, but she doubted.

As she entered the parlor a tall young man in worn khaki rose to meet her. At first glance
she could not name him, though she recognized the pale face and light-blue eyes, direct and steady.

"Good morning, Miss Burch," he said. "I hope you'll excuse so early a call. You remember me,
don't you? I'm George Burton, who had the bunk next to Rust's."

"Surely I remember you, Mr. Burton, and I'm glad to see you," replied Carley, shaking hands
with him. "Please sit down. Your being here must mean you're discharged from the hospital."

"Yes, I was discharged, all right," he said.

"Which means you're well again. That is fine. I'm very glad."

"I was put out to make room for a fellow in bad shape. I'm still shaky and weak," he replied.
"But I'm glad to go. I've pulled through pretty good, and it'll not be long until I'm strong
again. It was the 'flu' that kept me down."

"You must be careful. May I ask where you're going and what you expect to do?"

"Yes, that's what I came to tell you," he replied, frankly. "I want you to help me a little.
I'm from Illinois and my people aren't so badly off. But I don't want to go back to my home
town down and out, you know. Besides, the winters are cold there. The doctor advises me to
go to a little milder climate. You see, I was gassed, and got the 'flu' afterward. But I know
I'll be all right if I'm careful.... Well, I've always had a leaning toward agriculture, and
I want to go to Kansas. Southern Kansas. I want to travel around till I find a place I like,
and there I'll get a job. Not too hard a job at first--that's why I'll need a little money.
I know what to do. I want to lose myself in the wheat country and forget the--the war. I'll
not be afraid of work, presently.... Now, Miss Burch, you've been so kind--I'm going to ask
you to lend me a little money. I'll pay it back. I can't promise just when. But some day. Will
you?"

"Assuredly I will," she replied, heartily. "I'm happy to have the opportunity to help you.
How much will you need for immediate use? Five hundred dollars?"

"Oh no, not so much as that," he replied. "Just railroad fare home, and then to Kansas, and
to pay board while I get well, you know, and look around."

"We'll make it five hundred, anyway," she replied, and, rising, she went toward the library.
"Excuse me a moment." She wrote the check and, returning, gave it to him.

"You're very good," he said, rather low.

"Not at all," replied Carley. "You have no idea how much it means to me to be permitted to
help you. Before I forget, I must ask you, can you cash that check here in New York?"

"Not unless you identify me," he said, ruefully, "I don't know anyone I could ask."

"Well, when you leave here go at once to my bank--it's on Thirty-fourth Street--and I'll telephone
the cashier. So you'll not have any difficulty. Will you leave New York at once?"

"I surely will. It's an awful place. Two years ago when I came here with my company I thought
it was grand. But I guess I lost something over there. ... I want to be where it's quiet. Liddell
and Scott), s.v. [Greek: barbaros], observes that the word was originally
applied to "all that were not Greeks, or that did not speak Greek.

It was used of all defects which the Greeks thought foreign to themselves and natural to other
nations: but as the Hellenes and Barbarians were most of all separated
by language, the word had always especial reference to this [Greek:
glôssa barbara], Soph.

Aj. 1263, &c." He considers the word as probably an onomatopoeion, to express the sound of
a foreign tongue

.


"And what is that?" he asked, with a blush.

"Your service to your country," she said, gravely.

"Well," he said, with a singular bluntness, "considering I didn't get any medals or bonuses,
I'd like to draw a nice girl."

"You will," replied Carley, and made haste to change the subject. "By the way, did you meet
Glenn Kilbourne in France?"

"Not that I remember," rejoined Burton, as he got up, rising rather stiffly by aid of his cane.
"I must go, Miss Burch. Really I can't thank you enough. And I'll never forget it."

"Will you write me how you are getting along?" asked Carley, offering her hand.

"Yes."

Carley moved with him out into the hall and to the door. There was a question she wanted to
ask, but found it strangely difficult of utterance. At the door Burton fixed a rather penetrating
gaze upon her.

"You didn't ask me about Rust," he said.

"No, I--I didn't think of him--until now, in fact," Carley lied.

"Of course then you couldn't have heard about him. I was wondering."

"I have heard nothing."

"It was Rust who told me to come to you," said Burton. "We were talking one day, and he--well,
he thought you were true blue. He said he knew you'd trust me and lend me money. I couldn't
have asked you but for him."

"True blue! He believed that. I'm glad.... Has he spoken of me to you since I was last at the
hospital?"

"Hardly," replied Burton, with the straight, strange glance on her again.

Carley met this glance and suddenly a coldness seemed to envelop her. It did not seem to come
from within though her heart stopped beating. Burton had not changed--the warmth, the gratitude
still lingered about him. But the light of his eyes! Carley had seen it in Glenn's, in Rust's--a
strange, questioning, far-off light, infinitely aloof and unutterably sad. Then there came
a lift of her heart that released a pang. She whispered with dread, with a tremor, with an
instinct of calamity.

"How about--Rust?"

"He's dead."

The winter came, with its bleak sea winds and cold rains and blizzards of snow. Carley did
not go South. She read and brooded, and gradually avoided all save those true friends who tolerated
her.

She went to the theater a good deal, showing preference for the drama of strife, and she did
not go anywhere for amusement. Distraction and amusement seemed to be dead issues for her.
But she could become absorbed in any argument on the good or evil of the present day. Socialism
reached into her mind, to be rejected. She had never understood it clearly, but it seemed to
her a state of mind where dissatisfied men and women wanted to share what harder working or
more gifted people possessed. There were a few who had too much of the world's goods and many
who had too little. A readjustment of such inequality and injustice must come, but Carley did
not see the remedy in Socialism.

She devoured books on the war with a morbid curiosity and hope that she would find some illuminating
truth as to the uselessness of sacrificing young men in the glory and prime of their lives.
To her war appeared a matter of human nature rather than politics. Hate really was an effect
of war. In her judgment future wars could be avoided only in two ways--by men becoming honest
and just or by women refusing to have children to be sacrificed. As there seemed no indication
whatever of the former, she wondered how soon all women of all races would meet on a common
height, with the mounting spirit that consumed her own heart. Such time must come. She granted
every argument for war and flung against it one ringing passionate truth--agony of mangled
soldiers and agony of women and children. There was no justification for offensive war. It
was monstrous and hideous. If nature and evolution proved the absolute need of strife, war,
blood, and death in the progress of animal and man toward perfection, then it would be better
to abandon this Christless code and let the race of man die out.

All through these weeks she longed for a letter from Glenn. But it did not come. Had he finally
roused to the sweetness and worth and love of the western girl, Flo Hutter? Carley knew absolutely,
through both intelligence and intuition, that Glenn Kilbourne would never love Flo. Yet such
was her intensity and stress at times, especially in the darkness of waking hours, that jealousy
overcame her and insidiously worked its havoc. Peace and a strange kind of joy came to her
in dreams of her walks and rides and climbs in Arizona, of the lonely canyon where it always
seemed afternoon, of the tremendous colored vastness of that Painted Desert. But she resisted
these dreams now because when she awoke from them she suffered such a yearning that it became
unbearable. Then she knew the feeling of the loneliness and solitude of the hills. Then she
knew the sweetness of the murmur of falling water, the wind in the pines, the song of birds,
the white radiance of the stars, the break of day and its gold-flushed close. But she had not
yet divined their meaning. It was not all love for Glenn Kilbourne. Had city life palled upon
her solely because of the absence of her lover? So Carley plodded on, like one groping in the
night, fighting shadows.

One day she received a card from an old schoolmate, a girl who had married out of Carley's
set, and had been ostracized. She was living down on Long Island, at a little country place
named Wading River. Her husband was an electrician--something of an inventor. He worked hard.
A baby boy had just come to them. Would not Carley run down on the train to see the youngster?

That was a strong and trenchant call. Carley went. She found indeed a country village, and
on the outskirts of it a little cottage that must have been pretty in summer, when the green
was on vines and trees. Her old schoolmate was rosy, plump, bright-eyed, and happy. She saw
in Carley no change--a fact that somehow rebounded sweetly on Carley's consciousness. Elsie
prattled of herself and her husband and how they had worked to earn this little home, and then
the baby.

When Carley saw the adorable dark-eyed, pink-toed, curly-fisted baby she understood Elsie's
happiness and reveled in it. When she felt the soft, warm, living little body in her arms,
against her breast, then she absorbed some incalculable and mysterious strength. What were
the trivial, sordid, and selfish feelings that kept her in tumult compared to this welling
emotion? Had she the secret in her arms? Babies and Carley had never become closely acquainted
in those infrequent meetings that were usually the result of chance. But Elsie's baby nestled
to her breast and cooed to her and clung to her finger. When at length the youngster was laid
in his crib it seemed to Carley that the fragrance and the soul of him remained with her.

"A real American boy!" she murmured.

"You can just bet he is," replied Elsie. "Carley, you ought to see his dad."

"I'd like to meet him," said Carley, thoughtfully. "Elsie, was he in the service?"

"Yes. He was on one of the navy transports that took munitions to France. Think of me, carrying
this baby, with my husband on a boat full of explosives and with German submarines roaming
the ocean! Oh, it was horrible!"

"But he came back, and now all's well with you," said Carley, with a smile of earnestness.
"I'm very glad, Elsie."

"Yes--but I shudder when I think of a possible war in the future. I'm going to raise boys,
and girls, too, I hope--and the thought of war is torturing."

Carley found her return train somewhat late, and she took advantage of the delay to walk out
to the wooded headlands above the Sound.

It was a raw March day, with a steely sun going down in a pale-gray sky. Patches of snow lingered
in sheltered brushy places. This bit of woodland had a floor of soft sand that dragged at Carley's
feet. There were sere and brown leaves still fluttering on the scrub-oaks. At length Carley
came out on the edge of the bluff with the gray expanse of sea beneath her, and a long wandering
shore line, ragged with wreckage or driftwood. The surge of water rolled in--a long, low, white,
creeping line that softly roared on the beach and dragged the pebbles gratingly back. There
was neither boat nor living creature in sight.

Carley felt the scene ease a clutching hand within her breast. Here was loneliness and solitude
vastly different from that of Oak Creek Canyon, yet it held the same intangible power to soothe.
The swish of the surf, the moan of the wind in the evergreens, were voices that called to her.
How many more miles of lonely land than peopled cities! Then the sea--how vast! And over that
the illimitable and infinite sky, and beyond, the endless realms of space. It helped her somehow
to see and hear and feel the eternal presence of nature. In communion with nature the significance
of life might be realized. She remembered Glenn quoting: "The world is too much with us. ...
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers." What were our powers? What did God intend men
to do with hands and bodies and gifts and souls? She gazed back over the bleak land and then
out across the broad sea. Only a millionth part of the surface of the unsubmerged earth knew
the populous abodes of man. And the lonely sea, inhospitable to stable homes of men, was thrice
the area of the land. Were men intended, then, to congregate in few places, to squabble and
to bicker and breed the discontents that led to injustice, hatred, and war? What a mystery
it all was! But Nature was neither false nor little, however cruel she might be.

Once again Carley fell under the fury of her ordeal. Wavering now, restless and sleepless,
given to violent starts and slow spells of apathy, she was wearing to defeat.

That spring day, one year from the day she had left New York for Arizona, she wished to spend
alone. But her thoughts grew unbearable. She summed up the endless year. Could she live another
like it? Something must break within her.

She went out. The air was warm and balmy, carrying that subtle current which caused the mild
madness of spring fever. In the Park the greening of the grass, the opening of buds, the singing
of birds, the gladness of children, the light on the water, the warm sun--all seemed to reproach
her. Carley fled from the Park to the home of Beatrice Lovell; and there, unhappily, she encountered
those of her acquaintance with whom she had least patience. They forced her to think too keenly
of herself. They appeared carefree while she was miserable.

Over teacups there were waging gossip and argument and criticism. When Carley entered with
Beatrice there was a sudden hush and then a murmur.

"Hello, Carley! Now say it to our faces," called out Geralda Conners, a fair, handsome young
woman of thirty, exquisitely gowned in the latest mode, and whose brilliantly tinted complexion
was not the natural one of health.

"Say what, Geralda?" asked Carley. "I certainly would not say anything behind your backs that
I wouldn't repeat here."

"Eleanor has been telling us how you simply burned us up."

"We did have an argument. And I'm not sure I said all I wanted to."

"Say the rest here," drawled a lazy, mellow voice. "For Heaven's sake, stir us up. If I could
get a kick out of anything I'd bless it."

"Carley, go on the stage," advised another. "You've got Elsie Ferguson tied to the mast for
looks. And lately you're surely tragic enough."

"I wish you'd go somewhere far off!" observed a third. "My husband is dippy about you."

"Girls, do you know that you actually have not one sensible idea in your heads?" retorted Carley.

"Sensible? I should hope not. Who wants to be sensible?"

Geralda battered her teacup on a saucer. "Listen," she called. "I wasn't kidding Carley. I
am good and sore. She goes around knocking everybody and saying New York backs Sodom off the
boards. I want her to come out with it right here."

"I dare say I've talked too much," returned Carley. "It's been a rather hard winter on me.
Perhaps, indeed, I've tried the patience of my friends."

"See here, Carley," said Geralda, deliberately, "just because you've had life turn to bitter
ashes in your mouth you've no right to poison it for us. We all find it pretty sweet. You're
an unsatisfied woman and if you don't marry somebody you'll end by being a reformer or fanatic."

"I'd rather end that way than rot in a shell," retorted Carley.

"I declare, you make me see red, Carley," flashed Geralda, angrily. "No wonder Morrison roasts
you to everybody. He says Glenn Kilbourne threw you down for some Western girl. If that's true
it's pretty small of you to vent your spleen on us."

Carley felt the gathering of a mighty resistless force, But Geralda Conners was nothing to
her except the target for a thunderbolt.

"I have no spleen," she replied, with a dignity of passion. "I have only pity. I was as blind
as you. If heartbreak tore the scales from my eyes, perhaps that is well for me. For I see
something terribly wrong in myself, in you, in all of us, in the life of today."

"You keep your pity to yourself. You need it," answered Geralda, with heat. "There's nothing
wrong with me or my friends or life in good old New York."

"Nothing wrong!" cried Carley. "Listen. Nothing wrong in you or life today--nothing for you
women to make right? You are blind as bats--as dead to living truth as if you were buried.
Nothing wrong when thousands of crippled soldiers have no homes--no money--no friends--no work--in
many cases no food or bed?... Splendid young men who went away in their prime to fight for
you and came back ruined, suffering! Nothing wrong when sane women with the vote might rid
politics of partisanship, greed, crookedness? Nothing wrong when prohibition is mocked by women--when
the greatest boon ever granted this country is derided and beaten down and cheated? Nothing
wrong when there are half a million defective children in this city? Nothing wrong when there
are not enough schools and teachers to educate our boys and girls, when those teachers are
shamefully underpaid? Nothing wrong when the mothers of this great country let their youngsters
go to the dark motion picture halls and night after night in thousands of towns over all this
broad land see pictures that the juvenile court and the educators and keepers of reform schools
say make burglars, crooks, and murderers of our boys and vampires of our girls? Nothing wrong
when these young adolescent girls ape you and wear stockings rolled under their knees below
their skirts and use a lip stick and paint their faces and darken their eyes and pluck their
eyebrows and absolutely do not know what shame is? Nothing wrong when you may find in any city
women standing at street corners distributing booklets on birth control? Nothing wrong when
great magazines print no page or picture without its sex appeal? Nothing wrong when the automobile,
so convenient for the innocent little run out of town, presents the greatest evil that ever
menaced American girls! Nothing wrong when money is god--when luxury, pleasure, excitement,
speed are the striven for? Nothing wrong when some of your husbands spend more of their time
with other women than with you? Nothing wrong with jazz--where the lights go out in the dance
hall and the dancers jiggle and toddle and wiggle in a frenzy? Nothing wrong in a country where
the greatest college cannot report birth of one child to each graduate in ten years? Nothing
wrong with race suicide and the incoming horde of foreigners?... Nothing wrong with you women
who cannot or will not stand childbirth? Nothing wrong with most of you, when if you did have
a child, you could not nurse it?... Oh, my God, there's nothing wrong with America except that
she staggers under a Titanic burden that only mothers of sons can remove!... You doll women,
you parasites, you toys of men, you silken-wrapped geisha girls, you painted, idle, purring
cats, you parody of the females of your species--find brains enough if you can to see the doom
hanging over you and revolt before it is too late!"

CHAPTER XI

Carley burst in upon her aunt.

"Look at me, Aunt Mary!" she cried, radiant and exultant. "I'm going back out West to marry
Glenn and live his life!"

The keen old eyes of her aunt softened and dimmed. "Dear Carley, I've known that for a long
time. You've found yourself at last."

Then Carley breathlessly babbled her hastily formed plans, every word of which seemed to rush
her onward.

"You're going to surprise Glenn again?" queried Aunt Mary.

"Oh, I must! I want to see his face when I tell him."

"Well, I hope he won't surprise you," declared the old lady. "When did you hear from him last?"

"In January. It seems ages--but--Aunt Mary, you don't imagine Glenn--"

"I imagine nothing," interposed her aunt. "It will turn out happily and I'll have some peace
in my old age. But, Carley, what's to become of me?"

"Oh, I never thought!" replied Carley, blankly. "It will be lonely for you. Auntie, I'll come
back in the fall for a few weeks. Glenn will let me."

"Let you? Ye gods! So you've come to that? Imperious Carley Burch!... Thank Heaven, you'll
now be satisfied to be let do things."

"I'd--I'd crawl for him," breathed Carley.

"Well, child, as you can't be practical, I'll have to be," replied Aunt Mary, seriously. "Fortunately
for you I am a woman of quick decision. Listen. I'll go West with you. I want to see the Grand
Canyon. Then I'll go on to California, where I have old friends I've not seen for years. When
you get your new home all fixed up I'll spend awhile with you. And if I want to come back to
New York now and then I'll go to a hotel. It is settled. I think the change will benefit me."

"Auntie, you make me very happy. A Sheapard, Tityrus, his Sheep should feed, And choose a subject suited
to his reed,

This certainly was a serious admonition, implyed by
the twitching of his Ear, and I believe if he had continued in this
former humor and not obey'd the smarting admonition.

He had still felt it: so far was he from thinking Kings and Battels
fit Themes for a Sheapards song: and this evidently shows that in
Virgils opinion, contrary to Nanniu's fancy, great things cannot in
the least be comprehended within the subject matter of Pastorals;
no, it must be low and humble, which Theocritus very happily expresseth
by this word *Boukoliasdên* i.e. as the interpreters explain it, sing
humble Strains.

Theefore let Pastoral never venture upon a {25} lofty subject, let it not recede one jot from
its proper matter, but be employ'd about Rustick affairs: such as are mean and humble in themselves;
and such are the affairs of Shepherds, especially their Loves, but those must be pure and innocent;
not disturb'd by vain suspitious jealousy, nor polluted by Rapes; The Rivals must not fight, and
their emulations must be without quarrellings: such as Vida meant.

Whilst on his Reed he Shepherd's stifes conveys, And soft complaints
in smooth Sicilian lays.

To these may be added sports, Jests, Gifts, and Presents; but not
costly, such are yellow Apples, young stock-Doves, Milk, Flowers,
and the like; all things must appear delightful and easy, nothing
vitious and rough: A perfidious Pimp, a designing Jilt, a gripeing
Usurer, a crafty factious Servant must have no room there, but every
part must be full of the simplicity of the Golden-Age, and of that
Candor which was then eminent: for as Juvenal affirms

Baseness was
a great wonder in that Age;

Sometimes Funeral-Rites are the subject
of an Eclogue, where the Shepherds scatter flowers on the Tomb, and
sing Rustick Songs in honor of the Dead: Examples of this kind are
left us by Virgil in his Daphnis, and Bion in his Adonis, and this
hath nothing disagreeable to a Shepherd: In {26} short whatever, the
decorum being still preserv'd, can be done by a Sheapard, may be the
Subject of a Pastoral.

11. for all the rest are deficient either in matter or form, and from this number of pure pastoral
Idylliums I am apt to think, that Theocritus seems to have made that Pipe, on which he tun'd his
Pastorals and which he consecrated to Pan of ten Reeds, as Salmasius in his notes on Theocritus's
Pipe hath learnedly observed: in which two Verses always make one Reed of the Pipe, therefore
all are so unequal, like the unequal Reeds of a Pipe, that if you put two equals together
which make one Reed, the whole inequality consists in ten pairs; when in the common Pipes there
were usually no more then seven Reeds, and this the less curious observers have heedlessly
past by.
 Carley looked down into the void, at the sailing birds, at the precipitous slopes,
and the dwarf spruces and the weathered old yellow cliffs. When she looked up again the shadows
out there were no longer dark. They were clear. The slopes and depths and ribs of rock could
be seen through them. Then the tips of the highest peaks and domes turned bright red. Far to
the east she discerned a strange shadow, slowly turning purple. One instant it grew vivid,
then began to fade. Soon after that all the colors darkened and slowly the pale gray stole
over all.

At night Carley gazed over and into the black void. But for the awful sense of depth she would
not have known the Canyon to be there. A soundless movement of wind passed under her. The chasm
seemed a grave of silence. It was as mysterious as the stars and as aloof and as inevitable.
It had held her senses of beauty and proportion in abeyance.

At another sunrise the crown of the rim, a broad belt of bare rock, turned pale gold under
its fringed dark line of pines. The tips of the peak gleamed opal. There was no sunrise red,
no fire. The light in the east was a pale gold under a steely green-blue sky. All the abyss
of the Canyon was soft, gray, transparent, and the belt of gold broadened downward, making
shadows on the west slopes of the mesas and escarpments. Far down in the shadows she discerned
the river, yellow, turgid, palely gleaming. By straining her ears Carley heard a low dull roar
as of distant storm. She stood fearfully at the extreme edge of a stupendous cliff, where it
sheered dark and forbidding, down and down, into what seemed red and boundless depths of Hades.
She saw gold spots of sunlight on the dark shadows, proving that somewhere, impossible to discover,
the sun was shining through wind-worn holes in the sharp ridges. Every instant Carley grasped
a different effect. Her studied gaze absorbed an endless changing. And at last she realized
that sun and light and stars and moon and night and shade, all working incessantly and mutably
over shapes and lines and angles and surfaces too numerous and too great for the sight of man
to hold, made an ever-changing spectacle of supreme beauty and colorful grandeur.

She talked very little while at the Canyon. It silenced her. She had come to see it at the
critical time of her life and in the right mood. The superficialities of the world shrunk to
their proper insignificance. Once she asked her aunt: "Why did not Glenn bring me here?" As
if this Canyon proved the nature of all things!

But in the end Carley found that the rending strife of the transformation of her attitude toward
life had insensibly ceased. It had ceased during the long watching of this cataclysm of nature,
this canyon of gold-banded black-fringed ramparts, and red-walled mountains which sloped down
to be lost in purple depths. That was final proof of the strength of nature to soothe, to clarify,
to stabilize the tried and weary and upward-gazing soul. Stronger than the recorded deeds of
saints, stronger than the eloquence of the gifted uplifters of men, stronger than any words
ever written, was the grand, brooding, sculptured aspect of nature. And it must have been so
because thousands of years before the age of saints or preachers--before the fret and symbol
and figure were cut in stone--man must have watched with thought-developing sight the wonders
of the earth, the monuments of time, the glooming of the dark-blue sea, the handiwork of God.

In May, Carley returned to Flagstaff to take up with earnest inspiration the labors of homebuilding
in a primitive land.

It required two trucks to transport her baggage and purchases out to Deep Lake. The road was
good for eighteen miles of the distance, until it branched off to reach her land, and from
there it was desert rock and sand. But eventually they made it; and Carley found herself and
belongings dumped out into the windy and sunny open. The moment was singularly thrilling and
full of transport. She was free. She had shaken off the shackles. She faced lonely, wild, barren
desert that must be made habitable by the genius of her direction and the labor of her hands.
Always a thought of Glenn hovered tenderly, dreamily in the back of her consciousness, but
she welcomed the opportunity to have a few weeks of work and activity and solitude before taking
up her life with him. She wanted to adapt herself to the metamorphosis that had been wrought
in her.

To her amazement and delight, a very considerable progress had been made with her plans. Under
a sheltered red cliff among the cedars had been erected the tents where she expected to live
until the house was completed. These tents were large, with broad floors high off the ground,
and there were four of them. Her living tent had a porch under a wide canvas awning. The bed
was a boxlike affair, raised off the floor two feet, and it contained a great, fragrant mass
of cedar boughs upon which the blankets were to be spread. At one end was a dresser with large
mirror, and a chiffonier. There were table and lamp, a low rocking chair, a shelf for books,
a row of hooks upon which to hang things, a washstand with its necessary accessories, a little
stove and a neat stack of cedar chips and sticks. Navajo rugs on the floor lent brightness
and comfort.

Carley heard the rustling of cedar branches over her head, and saw where they brushed against
the tent roof. It appeared warm and fragrant inside, and protected from the wind, and a subdued
white light filtered through the canvas. Almost she felt like reproving herself for the comfort
surrounding her. For she had come West to welcome the hard knocks of primitive life.

It took less than an hour to have her trunks stored in one of the spare tents, and to unpack
clothes and necessaries for immediate use. Carley donned the comfortable and somewhat shabby
outdoor garb she had worn at Oak Creek the year before; and it seemed to be the last thing
needed to make her fully realize the glorious truth of the present.

"I'm here," she said to her pale, yet happy face in the mirror. "The impossible has happened.
I have accepted Glenn's life. I have answered that strange call out of the West."

She wanted to throw herself on the sunlit woolly blankets of her bed and hug them, to think
and think of the bewildering present happiness, to dream of the future, but she could not lie
or sit still, nor keep her mind from grasping at actualities and possibilities of this place,
nor her hands from itching to do things.

It developed, presently, that she could not have idled away the time even if she had wanted
to, for the Mexican woman came for her, with smiling gesticulation and jabber that manifestly
meant dinner. Carley could not understand many Mexican words, and herein she saw another task.
This swarthy woman and her sloe-eyed husband favorably impressed Carley.

Next to claim her was Hoyle, the superintendent. "Miss Burch," he said, "in the early days
we could run up a log cabin in a jiffy. Axes, horses, strong arms, and a few pegs--that was
all we needed. But this house you've planned is different. It's good you've come to take the
responsibility."

Carley had chosen the site for her home on top of the knoll where Glenn had taken her to show
her the magnificent view of mountains and desert. Carley climbed it now with beating heart
and mingled emotions. A thousand times already that day, it seemed, she had turned to gaze
up at the noble white-clad peaks. They were closer now, apparently looming over her, and she
felt a great sense of peace and protection in the thought that they would always be there.
But she had not yet seen the desert that had haunted her for a year. When she reached the summit
of the knoll and gazed out across the open space it seemed that she must stand spellbound.
How green the cedared foreground--how gray and barren the downward slope--how wonderful the
painted steppes! The vision that had lived in her memory shrank to nothingness. The reality
was immense, more than beautiful, appalling in its isolation, beyond comprehension with its
lure and strength to uplift.

But the superintendent drew her attention to the business at hand.

Carley had planned an L-shaped house of one story. Some of her ideas appeared to be impractical,
and these she abandoned. The framework was up and half a dozen carpenters were lustily at work
with saw and hammer.

"We'd made better progress if this house was in an ordinary place," explained Hoyle. "But you
see the wind blows here, so the framework had to be made as solid and strong as possible. In
fact, it's bolted to the sills."

Both living room and sleeping room were arranged so that the Painted Desert could be seen from
one window, and on the other side the whole of the San Francisco Mountains. Both rooms were
to have open fireplaces. Carley's idea was for service and durability. She thought of comfort
in the severe winters of that high latitude, but elegance and luxury had no more significance
in her life.

Hoyle made his suggestions as to changes and adaptations, and, receiving her approval, he went
on to show her what had been already accomplished. Back on higher ground a reservoir of concrete
was being constructed near an ever-flowing spring of snow water from the peaks. This water
was being piped by gravity to the house, and was a matter of greatest satisfaction to Hoyle,
for he claimed that it would never freeze in winter, and would be cold and abundant during
the hottest and driest of summers. This assurance solved the most difficult and serious problem
of ranch life in the desert.

Next Hoyle led Carley down off the knoll to the wide cedar valley adjacent to the lake. He
was enthusiastic over its possibilities. Two small corrals and a large one had been erected,
the latter having a low flat barn connected with it. Ground was already being cleared along
the lake where alfalfa and hay were to be raised. Carley saw the blue and yellow smoke from
burning brush, and the fragrant odor thrilled her. Mexicans were chopping the cleared cedars
into firewood for winter use.

The day was spent before she realized it. At sunset the carpenters and mechanics left in two
old Ford cars for town. The Mexicans had a camp in the cedars, and the Hoyles had theirs at
the spring under the knoll where Carley had camped with Glenn and the Hutters. Carley watched
the golden rosy sunset, and as the day ended she breathed deeply as if in unutterable relief.
Supper found her with appetite she had long since lost. Twilight brought cold wind, the staccato
bark of coyotes, the flicker of camp fires through the cedars. She tried to embrace all her
sensations, but they were so rapid and many that she failed.

The cold, clear, silent night brought back the charm of the desert. How flaming white the stars!
The great spire-pointed peaks lifted cold pale-gray outlines up into the deep star-studded
sky. Carley walked a little to and fro, loath to go to her tent, though tired. She wanted calm.
But instead of achieving calmness she grew more and more towards a strange state of exultation.

Westward, only a matter of twenty or thirty miles, lay the deep rent in the level desert--Oak
Creek Canyon. If Glenn had been there this night would have been perfect, yet almost unendurable.
She was again grateful for his absence. What a surprise she had in store for him! And she imagined
his face in its change of expression when she met him. If only he never learned of her presence
in Arizona until she made it known in person! That she most longed for. Chances were against
it, but then her luck had changed. She looked to the eastward where a pale luminosity of afterglow
shone in the heavens. Far distant seemed the home of her childhood, the friends she had scorned
and forsaken, the city of complaining and striving millions. If only some miracle might illumine
the minds of her friends, as she felt that hers was to be illumined here in the solitude. But
she well realized that not all problems could be solved by a call out of the West. Any open
and lonely land that might have saved Glenn Kilbourne would have sufficed for her. It was the
spirit of the thing and not the letter. It was work of any kind and not only that of ranch
life. Not only the raising of hogs!

Carley directed stumbling steps toward the light of her tent. Her eyes had not been used to
such black shadow along the ground. She had, too, squeamish feminine fears of hydrophobia skunks,
and nameless animals or reptiles that were imagined denizens of the darkness. She gained her
tent and entered. The Mexican, Gino, as he called himself, had lighted her lamp and fire. Carley
was chilled through, and the tent felt so warm and cozy that she could scarcely believe it.
She fastened the screen door, laced the flaps across it, except at the top, and then gave herself
up to the lulling and comforting heat.

There were plans to perfect; innumerable things to remember; a car and accessories, horses,
saddles, outfits to buy. Carley knew she should sit down at her table and write and figure,
but she could not do it then.

For a long time she sat over the little stove, toasting her knees and hands, adding some chips
now and then to the red coals. And her mind seemed a kaleidoscope of changing visions, thoughts,
feelings. At last she undressed and blew out the lamp and went to bed.

Instantly a thick blackness seemed to enfold her and silence as of a dead world settled down
upon her. Drowsy as she was, she could not close her eyes nor refrain from listening. Darkness
and silence were tangible things. She felt them. And they seemed suddenly potent with magic
charm to still the tumult of her, to soothe and rest, to create thoughts she had never thought
before. Rest was more than selfish indulgence. Loneliness was necessary to gain consciousness
of the soul. Already far back in the past seemed Carley's other life.

By and by the dead stillness awoke to faint sounds not before perceptible to her--a low, mournful
sough of the wind in the cedars, then the faint far-distant note of a coyote, sad as the night
and infinitely wild.

Days passed. Carley worked in the mornings with her hands and her brains. In the afternoons
she rode and walked and climbed with a double object, to work herself into fit physical condition
and to explore every nook and corner of her six hundred and forty acres.

Then what she had expected and deliberately induced by her efforts quickly came to pass. Just
as the year before she had suffered excruciating pain from aching muscles, and saddle blisters,
and walking blisters, and a very rending of her bones, so now she fell victim to them again.
In sunshine and rain she faced the desert. Sunburn and sting of sleet were equally to be endured.
And that abomination, the hateful blinding sandstorm, did not daunt her. But the weary hours
of abnegation to this physical torture at least held one consoling recompense as compared with
her experience of last year, and it was that there was no one interested to watch for her weaknesses
and failures and blunders. She could fight it out alone.

Three weeks of this self-imposed strenuous training wore by before Carley was free enough from
weariness and pain to experience other sensations. Her general health, evidently, had not been
so good as when she had first visited Arizona. She caught cold and suffered other ills attendant
upon an abrupt change of climate and condition. But doggedly she kept at her task. She rode
when she should have been in bed; she walked when she should have ridden; she climbed when
she should have kept to level ground. And finally by degrees so gradual as not to be noticed
except in the sum of them she began to mend.

Meanwhile the construction of her house went on with uninterrupted rapidity. When the low,
slanting, wide-eaved roof was completed Carley lost further concern about rainstorms. Let them
come. When the plumbing was all in and Carley saw verification of Hoyle's assurance that it
would mean a gravity supply of water ample and continual, she lost her last concern as to the
practicability of the work. That, and the earning of her endurance, seemed to bring closer
a wonderful reward, still nameless and spiritual, that had been unattainable, but now breathed
to her on the fragrant desert wind and in the brooding silence.

The time came when each afternoon's ride or climb called to Carley with increasing delight.
But the fact that she must soon reveal to Glenn her presence and transformation did not seem
to be all the cause. She could ride without pain, walk without losing her breath, work without
blistering her hands; and in this there was compensation. The building of the house that was
to become a home, the development of water resources and land that meant the making of a ranch--these
did not altogether constitute the anticipation of content. To be active, to accomplish things,
to recall to mind her knowledge of manual training, of domestic science, of designing and painting,
to learn to cook--these were indeed measures full of reward, but they were not all. In her
wondering, pondering meditation she arrived at the point where she tried to assign to her love
the growing fullness of her life. This, too, splendid and all-pervading as it was, she had
to reject. Some exceedingly illusive and vital significance of life had insidiously come to Carley.

One afternoon, with the sky full of white and black rolling clouds and a cold wind sweeping
through the cedars, she halted to rest and escape the chilling gale for a while. In a sunny
place, under the lee of a gravel bank, she sought refuge. It was warm here because of the reflected
sunlight and the absence of wind. The sand at the bottom of the bank held a heat that felt
good to her cold hands. All about her and over her swept the keen wind, rustling the sage,
seeping the sand, swishing the cedars, but she was out of it, protected and insulated. The
sky above showed blue between the threatening clouds. There were no birds or living creatures
in sight. Certainly the place had little of color or beauty or grace, nor could she see beyond
a few rods. Lying there, without any particular reason that she was conscious of, she suddenly
felt shot through and through with exhilaration.

Another day, the warmest of the spring so far, she rode a Navajo mustang she had recently bought
from a passing trader; and at the farthest end of her section, in rough wooded and ridged ground
she had not explored, she found a canyon with red walls and pine trees and gleaming streamlet
and glades of grass and jumbles of rock. It was a miniature canyon, to be sure, only a quarter
of a mile long, and as deep as the height of a lofty pine, and so narrow that it seemed only
the width of a lane, but it had all the features of Oak Creek Canyon, and so sufficed for the
exultant joy of possession. She explored it. The willow brakes and oak thickets harbored rabbits
and birds. She saw the white flags of deer running away down the open. Up at the head where
the canyon boxed she flushed a flock of wild turkeys. They ran like ostriches and flew like
great brown chickens. In a cavern Carley found the den of a bear, and in another place the
bleached bones of a steer.

She lingered here in the shaded depths with a feeling as if she were indeed lost to the world.
These big brown and seamy-barked pines with their spreading gnarled arms and webs of green
needles belonged to her, as also the tiny brook, the blue bells smiling out of the ferns, the
single stalk of mescal on a rocky ledge.

Never had sun and earth, tree and rock, seemed a part of her being until then. She would become
a sun-worshiper and a lover of the earth. That canyon had opened there to sky and light for
millions of years; and doubtless it had harbored sheep herders, Indians, cliff dwellers, barbarians.
She was a woman with white skin and a cultivated mind, but the affinity for them existed in
her. She felt it, and that an understanding of it would be good for body and soul.

Another day she found a little grove of jack pines growing on a flat mesa-like bluff, the highest
point on her land. The trees were small and close together, mingling their green needles overhead
and their discarded brown ones on the ground. From here Carley could see afar to all points
of the compass--the slow green descent to the south and the climb to the black-timbered distance;
the ridged and canyoned country to the west, red vents choked with green and rimmed with gray;
to the north the grand upflung mountain kingdom crowned with snow; and to the east the vastness
of illimitable space, the openness and wildness, the chased and beaten mosaic of colored sands
and rocks.

Again and again she visited this lookout and came to love its isolation, its command of wondrous
prospects, its power of suggestion to her thoughts. She became a creative being, in harmony
with the live things around her. The great life-dispensing sun poured its rays down upon her,
as if to ripen her; and the earth seemed warm, motherly, immense with its all-embracing arms.
She no longer plucked the bluebells to press to her face, but leaned to them. Every blade of
gramma grass, with its shining bronze-tufted seed head, had significance for her. The scents
of the desert began to have meaning for her. She sensed within her the working of a great leveling
process through which supreme happiness would come.

June! The rich, thick, amber light, like a transparent reflection from some intense golden
medium, seemed to float in the warm air. The sky became an azure blue. In the still noontides,
when the bees hummed drowsily and the flies buzzed, vast creamy-white columnar clouds rolled
up from the horizon, like colossal ships with bulging sails. And summer with its rush of growing
things was at hand.

Carley rode afar, seeking in strange places the secret that eluded her. Only a few days now
until she would ride down to Oak Creek Canyon! There was a low, singing melody of wind in the
cedars. The earth became too beautiful in her magnified sight. A great truth was dawning upon
her--that the sacrifice of what she had held as necessary to the enjoyment of life--that the
strain of conflict, the labor of hands, the forcing of weary body, the enduring of pain, the
contact with the earth--had served somehow to rejuvenate her blood, quicken her pulse, intensify
her sensorial faculties, thrill her very soul, lead her into the realm of enchantment.

One afternoon a dull, lead-black-colored cinder knoll tempted her to explore its bare heights.
She rode up until her mustang sank to his knees and could climb no farther. From there she
essayed the ascent on foot. It took labor. But at last she gained the summit, burning, sweating,
panting.

The cinder hill was an extinct crater of a volcano. In the center of it lay a deep bowl, wondrously
symmetrical, and of a dark lusterless hue. Not a blade of grass was there, nor a plant. Yet the
Passion must not rise too high, as Polyphemus's, Galateas's mad Lover, of whom Theocritus divinely
thus, as almost of every thing else:

His was no common flame, nor could he move In the old Arts, and beaten paths of Love, No Flowers nor Fruits
sent to oblige the Fair, {62} His was all Rage, and Madness:

For all violent Perturbations are to be diligently avoided by Bucolicks,
whose nature it is to be soft, and easie: For in small matters, and
such must all the strifes and contentions of Shepherds be, to make
a great deal of adoe, is as unseemly, as to put Hercules's Vizard
and Buskins on an Infant, as Quintilian hath excellently observ'd.
For since Eclogue is but weak, it seems not capable of those Commotions
which belong to the Theater, and Pulpit; they must be soft, and gentle,
and all its Passion must seem to flow only, and not break out: as
in Virgil's Gallus,

Ah, far from home and me You wander o're The
Alpine snows, the farthest Western shore, And frozen Rhine.

When are we like to meet? Ah gently, gently, lest thy tender feet Sharp Ice may wound.

To these he may sometimes joyn some short Interrogations made to inanimate Beings, for those
spread a strange life and vigor thro the whole Composure. Thus in Daphnis,

Did not You Streams, and Hazels, hear the Nymphs?

Or give the very Trees, and Fountains sense, as in Tityrus,

Thee (Tityrus) the Pines, and every Vale, The Fountains, Hills, and
every shrub did call:

for by this the Concernment is express'd; and
of the like nature is that of Thyrsis, in Virgil's Meliboeus,

{63}
When Phyllis comes, my wood will all be green.

And this sort of Expressions is frequent in Theocritus, and Virgil, and in these the delicacy of Pastoral
is principally contain'd, as one of the old Interpreters of Theocritus
hath observ'd on this line, in the eighth Idyllium,

Ye Vales, and
Streams, a race Divine:

But let them be so, and so seldom us'd, that
nothing appear vehement, and bold, for Boldness and Vehemence destroy
the sweetness which peculiarly commends Bucolicks, and in those Composures
a constant care to be soft and easie should be chief: For Pastoral
bears some resemblance to Terence, of whom Tully, in that Poem which
he writes to Libo, gives this Character,

His words are soft, and
each expression sweet.

In mixing Passion in Pastorals, that rule of Longinus, in his golden Treatise *peri hypsous*,
must be observ'd, Never use it, but when the matter requires it, and then too very sparingly.

Concerning
the Numbers, in which Pastoral should be written, this is my opinion; the Heroick Measure, but not
so strong and sounding as in Epicks, is to be chosen. Virgil and Theocritus have given us examples;
for tho Theocritus hath in one Idyllium mixt other Numbers, yet that can be of no force against
all the rest; and Virgil useth no Numbers but Heroick, from whence it may be inferr'd, that
those are the fittest.

{64} Pastoral may sometimes admit plain, but not long Narrations such as Socrates in Plato requires
in a Poet; for he chiefly approves those who use a plain Narration, and commends that above all
other which is short, and fitly expresseth the nature of the Thing. Some are of opinion that Bucolicks
cannot endure Narrations, especially if they are very long, and imagine there are none in Virgil:
but they have not been nice enough in their observations, for there are some, as that in Silenus.

Young
Chromis and Mnasylus chanct to stray, Where (sleeping in a Cave)
Silenus lay, Whose constant Cups fly fuming to his brain, And always
boyl in each extended vein: His trusty Flaggon, full of potent Juice,
Was hanging by, worn out with Age, and Use, &c.

But, because Narrations
are so seldom to be found in Theocritus, and Virgil, I think they
ought not to be often us'd; yet if the matter will bear it, I believe
such as Socrates would have, may very fitly be made use of.

 And how are you, Charley?" she replied, shaking hands with him.

"Me? Aw, I'm tip-top. I'm shore glad you got this ranch. Reckon I'll hit you for a job."

"I'd give it to you. But aren't you working for the Hutters?"

"Nope. Not any more. Me an' Stanton had a row with them."

How droll and dry he was! His lean, olive-brown face, with its guileless clear eyes and his
lanky figure in blue jeans vividly recalled Oak Creek to Carley.

"Oh, I'm sorry," returned she haltingly, somehow checked in her warm rush of thought. "Stanton?...
Did he quit too?"

"Yep. He sure did."

"What was the trouble?"

"Reckon because Flo made up to Kilbourne," replied Charley, with a grin.

"Ah! I--I see," murmured Carley. A blankness seemed to wave over her. It extended to the air
without, to the sense of the golden sunset. It passed. What should she ask--what out of a thousand
sudden flashing queries? "Are--are the Hutters back?"

"Sure. Been back several days. I reckoned Hoyle told you. Mebbe he didn't know, though. For
nobody's been to town."

"How is--how are they all?" faltered Carley. There was a strange wall here between her thought
and her utterance.

"Everybody satisfied, I reckon," replied Charley.

"Flo--how is she?" burst out Carley.

"Aw, Flo's loony over her husband," drawled Charley, his clear eyes on Carley's.

"Husband!" she gasped.

"Sure. Flo's gone an' went an' done what I swore on."

"Who?" whispered Carley, and the query was a terrible blade piercing her heart.

"Now who'd you reckon on?" asked Charley, with his slow grin.

Carley's lips were mute.

"Wal, it was your old beau thet you wouldn't have," returned Charley, as he gathered up his
long frame, evidently to leave. "Kilbourne! He an' Flo came back from the Tonto all hitched up."

CHAPTER XII

Vague sense of movement, of darkness, and of cold attended Carley's consciousness for what
seemed endless time.

A fall over rocks and a severe thrust from a sharp branch brought an acute appreciation of
her position, if not of her mental state. Night had fallen. The stars were out. She had stumbled
over a low ledge. Evidently she had wandered around, dazedly and aimlessly, until brought to
her senses by pain. But for a gleam of campfires through the cedars she would have been lost.
It did not matter. She was lost, anyhow. What was it that had happened?

Charley, the sheep herder! Then the thunderbolt of his words burst upon her, and she collapsed
to the cold stones. She lay quivering from head to toe. She dug her fingers into the moss and
lichen. "Oh, God, to think--after all--it happened!" she moaned. There had been a rending within
her breast, as of physical violence, from which she now suffered anguish. There were a thousand
stinging nerves. There was a mortal sickness of horror, of insupportable heartbreaking loss.
She could not endure it. She could not live under it.

She lay there until energy supplanted shock. Then she rose to rush into the darkest shadows
of the cedars, to grope here and there, hanging her head, wringing her hands, beating her breast.
"It can't be true," she cried. "Not after my struggle--my victory--not now!" But there had
been no victory. And now it was too late. She was betrayed, ruined, lost. That wonderful love
had wrought transformation in her--and now havoc. Once she fell against the branches of a thick
cedar that upheld her. The fragrance which had been sweet was now bitter. Life that had been
bliss was now hateful! She could not keep still for a single moment.

Black night, cedars, brush, rocks, washes, seemed not to obstruct her. In a frenzy she rushed
on, tearing her dress, her hands, her hair. Violence of some kind was imperative. All at once
a pale gleaming open space, shimmering under the stars, lay before her. It was water. Deep
Lake! And instantly a hideous terrible longing to destroy herself obsessed her. She had no
fear. She could have welcomed the cold, slimy depths that meant oblivion. But could they really
bring oblivion? A year ago she would have believed so, and would no longer have endured such
agony. She had changed. A cursed strength had come to her, and it was this strength that now
augmented her torture. She flung wide her arms to the pitiless white stars and looked up at
them. "My hope, my faith, my love have failed me," she whispered. "They have been a lie. I
went through hell for them. And now I've nothing to live for.... Oh, let me end it all!"

If she prayed to the stars for mercy, it was denied her. Passionlessly they blazed on. But
she could not kill herself. In that hour death would have been the only relief and peace left
to her. Stricken by the cruelty of her fate, she fell back against the stones and gave up to
grief. Nothing was left but fierce pain. The youth and vitality and intensity of her then locked
arms with anguish and torment and a cheated, unsatisfied love. Strength of mind and body involuntarily
resisted the ravages of this catastrophe. Will power seemed nothing, but the flesh of her,
that medium of exquisite sensation, so full of life, so prone to joy, refused to surrender.
The part of her that felt fought terribly for its heritage.

All night long Carley lay there. The crescent moon went down, the stars moved on their course,
the coyotes ceased to wail, the wind died away, the lapping of the waves along the lake shore
wore to gentle splash, the whispering of the insects stopped as the cold of dawn approached.
The darkest hour fell--hour of silence, solitude, and melancholy, when the desert lay tranced,
cold, waiting, mournful without light of moon or stars or sun.

In the gray dawn Carley dragged her bruised and aching body back to her tent, and, fastening
the door, she threw off wet clothes and boots and fell upon her bed. Slumber of exhaustion
came to her.

When she awoke the tent was light and the moving shadows of cedar boughs on the white canvas
told that the sun was straight above. Carley ached as never before. A deep pang seemed invested
in every bone. Her heart felt swollen out of proportion to its space in her breast. Her breathing
came slow and it hurt. Her blood was sluggish. Suddenly she shut her eyes. She loathed the
light of day. What was it that had happened?

Then the brutal truth flashed over her again, in aspect new, with all the old bitterness. For
an instant she experienced a suffocating sensation as if the canvas had sagged under the burden
of heavy air and was crushing her breast and heart. Then wave after wave of emotion swept over
her. The storm winds of grief and passion were loosened again. And she writhed in her misery.

Some one knocked on her door. The Mexican woman called anxiously. Carley awoke to the fact
that her presence was not solitary on the physical earth, even if her soul seemed stricken
to eternal loneliness. Even in the desert there was a world to consider. Vanity that had bled
to death, pride that had been crushed, availed her not here. But something else came to her
support. The lesson of the West had been to endure, not to shirk--to face an issue, not to
hide. Carley got up, bathed, dressed, brushed and arranged her dishevelled hair. The face she
saw in the mirror excited her amaze and pity. Then she went out in answer to the call for dinner.
But she could not eat. The ordinary functions of life appeared to be deadened.

The day happened to be Sunday, and therefore the workmen were absent. Carley had the place
to herself. How the half-completed house mocked her! She could not bear to look at it. What
use could she make of it now? Flo Hutter had become the working comrade of Glenn Kilbourne,
the mistress of his cabin. She was his wife and she would be the mother of his children.

That thought gave birth to the darkest hour of Carley Burch's life. She became possessed as
by a thousand devils. She became merely a female robbed of her mate. Reason was not in her,
nor charity, nor justice. All that was abnormal in human nature seemed coalesced in her, dominant,
passionate, savage, terrible. She hated with an incredible and insane ferocity. In the seclusion
of her tent, crouched on her bed, silent, locked, motionless, she yet was the embodiment of
all terrible strife and storm in nature. Her heart was a maelstrom and would have whirled and
sucked down to hell all the beings that were men. Her soul was a bottomless gulf, filled with
the gales and the fires of jealousy, superhuman to destroy.

That fury consumed all her remaining strength, and from the relapse she sank to sleep.

Morning brought the inevitable reaction. However long her other struggles, this monumental
and final one would be brief. She realized that, yet was unable to understand how it could
be possible, unless shock or death or mental aberration ended the fight. An eternity of emotion
lay back between this awakening of intelligence and the hour of her fall into the clutches
of primitive passion.

That morning she faced herself in the mirror and asked, "Now--what do I owe you?" It was not
her voice that answered. It was beyond her. But it said: "Go on! You are cut adrift. You are
alone. You owe none but yourself!... Go on! Not backward--not to the depths--but up--upward!"

She shuddered at such a decree. How impossible for her! All animal, all woman, all emotion,
how could she live on the cold, pure heights? Yet she owed something intangible and inscrutable
to herself. Was it the thing that woman lacked physically, yet contained hidden in her soul?
An element of eternal spirit to rise! Because of heartbreak and ruin and irreparable loss must
she fall? Was loss of love and husband and children only a test? The present hour would be
swallowed in the sum of life's trials. She could not go back. She would not go down. There
was wrenched from her tried and sore heart an unalterable and unquenchable decision--to make
her own soul prove the evolution of woman. Vessel of blood and flesh she might be, doomed by
nature to the reproduction of her kind, but she had in her the supreme spirit and power to
carry on the progress of the ages--the climb of woman out of the darkness.

Carley went out to the workmen. The house should be completed and she would live in it. Always
there was the stretching and illimitable desert to look at, and the grand heave upward of the
mountains. Hoyle was full of zest for the practical details of the building. He saw nothing
of the havoc wrought in her. Nor did the other workmen glance more than casually at her. In
this Carley lost something of a shirking fear that her loss and grief were patent to all eyes.

That afternoon she mounted the most spirited of the mustangs she had purchased from the Indians.
To govern him and stick on him required all her energy. And she rode him hard and far, out
across the desert, across mile after mile of cedar forest, clear to the foothills. She rested
there, absorbed in gazing desertward, and upon turning back again, she ran him over the level
stretches. Wind and branch threshed her seemingly to ribbons. Violence seemed good for her.
A fall had no fear for her now. She reached camp at dusk, hot as fire, breathless and strengthless.
But she had earned something. Such action required constant use of muscle and mind. If need
be she could drive both to the very furthermost limit. She could ride and ride--until the future,
like the immensity of the desert there, might swallow her. She changed her clothes and rested
a while. The call to supper found her hungry. In this fact she discovered mockery of her grief.
Love was not the food of life. Exhausted nature's need of rest and sleep was no respecter of
a woman's emotion.

Next day Carley rode northward, wildly and fearlessly, as if this conscious activity was the
initiative of an endless number of rides that were to save her. As before the foothills called
her, and she went on until she came to a very high one.

Carley dismounted from her panting horse, answering the familiar impulse to attain heights
by her own effort.

"Am I only a weakling?" she asked herself. "Only a creature mined by the fever of the soul!...
Thrown from one emotion to another? Never the same. Yearning, suffering, sacrificing, hoping,
and changing--forever the same! What is it that drives me? A great city with all its attractions
has failed to help me realize my life. So have friends failed. So has the world. What can solitude
and grandeur do?... All this obsession of mine--all this strange feeling for simple elemental
earthly things likewise will fail me. Yet I am driven. They would call me a mad woman."

It took Carley a full hour of slow body-bending labor to climb to the summit of that hill.
High, steep, and rugged, it resisted ascension. But at last she surmounted it and sat alone
on the heights, with naked eyes, and an unconscious prayer on her lips.

What was it that had happened? Could there be here a different answer from that which always
mocked her?

She had been a girl, not accountable for loss of mother, for choice of home and education.
She had belonged to a class. She had grown to womanhood in it. She had loved, and in loving
had escaped the evil of her day, if not its taint. She had lived only for herself. Conscience
had awakened--but, alas! too late. She had overthrown the sordid, self-seeking habit of life;
she had awakened to real womanhood; she had fought the insidious spell of modernity and she
had defeated it; she had learned the thrill of taking root in new soil, the pain and joy of
labor, the bliss of solitude, the promise of home and love and motherhood. But she had gathered
all these marvelous things to her soul too late for happiness.

"Now it is answered," she declared aloud. "That is what has happened?... And all that is past....
Is there anything left? If so what?"

She flung her query out to the winds of the desert. But the desert seemed too gray, too vast,
too remote, too aloof, too measureless. It was not concerned with her little life. Then she
turned to the mountain kingdom.

It seemed overpoweringly near at hand. It loomed above her to pierce the fleecy clouds. It
was only a stupendous upheaval of earth-crust, grown over at the base by leagues and leagues
of pine forest, belted along the middle by vast slanting zigzag slopes of aspen, rent and riven
toward the heights into canyon and gorge, bared above to cliffs and corners of craggy rock,
whitened at the sky-piercing peaks by snow. Its beauty and sublimity were lost upon Carley
now; she was concerned with its travail, its age, its endurance, its strength. And she studied
it with magnified sight.

What incomprehensible subterranean force had swelled those immense slopes and lifted the huge
bulk aloft to the clouds? Cataclysm of nature--the expanding or shrinking of the earth--vast
volcanic action under the surface! Whatever it had been, it had left its expression of the
travail of the universe. This mountain mass had been hot gas when flung from the parent sun,
and now it was solid granite. What had it endured in the making? What indeed had been its dimensions
before the millions of years of its struggle?

Eruption, earthquake, avalanche, the attrition of glacier, the erosion of water, the cracking
of frost, the weathering of rain and wind and snow--these it had eternally fought and resisted
in vain, yet still it stood magnificent, frowning, battle-scarred and undefeated. Martin Lovell; 25.

I fear I have given you so long a list as to deter you from replying to my inquiry but if you
cannot spare time or space to answer me fully, I have numbered the writers in such a way as that
you may be induced to give the numbers without the names, except you think that many of your readers
would be glad to have the information given to them which I ask of you.

Tristram Merton is T. B. Macaulay, who wrote several sketches and five ballads in the Magazine; {104}
indeed, it was in it that his fine English ballads first appeared.

Peregrine Courtenay was the late Winthrop Mackworth Praed, who was, I believe, its editor.

Henry Nelson Coleridge and John Moultire were also contributors, but
under what signatures they wrote I cannot tell.

Knight's Quarterly Magazine never extended beyond three volumes, and
it is now a rather scarce book. Any light you can throw upon this
subject will have an interest for most people, and will be duly appreciated
by

THE STATIONERS' COMPANY AND ALMANACK.

Having
recently had occasion to consult the Lansdown MSS., No. 905., a volume
containing documents formerly belonging to Mr. Umfreville, I observed
the following:

"Ordinances, constitutions, rules, and articles made
by the Court of Star Chamber relating to Printers and Printing, Jan.
23, anno 28 Eliz."

Appended to these ordinances, &c. is a statement
from which I have made the following extracts:

"Viii^o Januarii,
1583. If nature's secret
was the developing of a spirit through all time, Carley divined that she had it within her.
So the present meant little.

"I have no right to be unhappy," concluded Carley. "I had no right to Glenn Kilbourne. I failed
him. In that I failed myself. Neither life nor nature failed me--nor love. It is no longer
a mystery. Unhappiness is only a change. Happiness itself is only change. So what does it matter?
The great thing is to see life--to understand--to feel--to work--to fight--to endure. It is
not my fault I am here. But it is my fault if I leave this strange old earth the poorer for
my failure.... I will no longer be little. I will find strength. I will endure.... I still
have eyes, ears, nose, taste. I can feel the sun, the wind, the nip of frost. Must I slink
like a craven because I've lost the love of one man? Must I hate Flo Hutter because she will
make Glenn happy? Never!... All of this seems better so, because through it I am changed. I
might have lived on, a selfish clod!"

Carley turned from the mountain kingdom and faced her future with the profound and sad and
far-seeing look that had come with her lesson. She knew what to give. Sometime and somewhere
there would be recompense. She would hide her wound in the faith that time would heal it. And
the ordeal she set herself, to prove her sincerity and strength, was to ride down to Oak Creek
Canyon.

Carley did not wait many days. Strange how the old vanity held her back until something of
the havoc in her face should be gone!

One morning she set out early, riding her best horse, and she took a sheep trail across country.
The distance by road was much farther. The June morning was cool, sparkling, fragrant. Mocking
birds sang from the topmost twig of cedars; doves cooed in the pines; sparrow hawks sailed
low over the open grassy patches. Desert primroses showed their rounded pink clusters in sunny
places, and here and there burned the carmine of Indian paint-brush. Jack rabbits and cotton-tails
bounded and scampered away through the sage. The desert had life and color and movement this
June day. And as always there was the dry fragrance on the air.

Her mustang had been inured to long and consistent travel over the desert. Her weight was nothing
to him and he kept to the swinging lope for miles. As she approached Oak Creek Canyon, however,
she drew him to a trot, and then a walk. Sight of the deep red-walled and green-floored canyon
was a shock to her.

The trail came out on the road that led to Ryan's sheep camp, at a point several miles west
of the cabin where Carley had encountered Haze Ruff. She remembered the curves and stretches,
and especially the steep jump-off where the road led down off the rim into the canyon. Here
she dismounted and walked. From the foot of this descent she knew every rod of the way would
be familiar to her, and, womanlike, she wanted to turn away and fly from them. But she kept
on and mounted again at level ground.

The murmur of the creek suddenly assailed her ears--sweet, sad, memorable, strangely powerful
to hurt. Yet the sound seemed of long ago. Down here summer had advanced. Rich thick foliage
overspread the winding road of sand. Then out of the shade she passed into the sunnier regions
of isolated pines. Along here she had raced Calico with Glenn's bay; and here she had caught
him, and there was the place she had fallen. She halted a moment under the pine tree where
Glenn had held her in his arms. Tears dimmed her eyes. If only she had known then the truth,
the reality! But regrets were useless.

By and by a craggy red wall loomed above the trees, and its pipe-organ conformation was familiar
to Carley. She left the road and turned to go down to the creek. Sycamores and maples and great
bowlders, and mossy ledges overhanging the water, and a huge sentinel pine marked the spot
where she and Glenn had eaten their lunch that last day. Her mustang splashed into the clear
water and halted to drink. Beyond, through the trees, Carley saw the sunny red-earthed clearing
that was Glenn's farm. She looked, and fought herself, and bit her quivering lip until she
tasted blood. Then she rode out into the open.

The whole west side of the canyon had been cleared and cultivated and plowed. But she gazed
no farther. She did not want to see the spot where she had given Glenn his ring and had parted
from him. She rode on. If she could pass West Fork she believed her courage would rise to the
completion of this ordeal. Places were what she feared. Places that she had loved while blindly
believing she hated! There the narrow gap of green and blue split the looming red wall. She
was looking into West Fork. Up there stood the cabin. How fierce a pang rent her breast! She
faltered at the crossing of the branch stream, and almost surrendered. The water murmured,
the leaves rustled, the bees hummed, the birds sang--all with some sad sweetness that seemed
of the past.

Then the trail leading up West Fork was like a barrier. She saw horse tracks in it. Next she
descried boot tracks the shape of which was so well-remembered that it shook her heart. There
were fresh tracks in the sand, pointing in the direction of the Lodge. Ah! that was where Glenn
lived now. Carley strained at her will to keep it fighting her memory. The glory and the dream
were gone!

A touch of spur urged her mustang into a gallop. The splashing ford of the creek--the still,
eddying pool beyond--the green orchards--the white lacy waterfall--and Lolomi Lodge!

Nothing had altered. But Carley seemed returning after many years. Slowly she dismounted--slowly
she climbed the porch steps. Was there no one at home? Yet the vacant doorway, the silence--something
attested to the knowledge of Carley's presence. Then suddenly Mrs. Hutter fluttered out with
Flo behind her.

"You dear girl--I'm so glad!" cried Mrs. Hutter, her voice trembling.

"I'm glad to see you, too," said Carley, bending to receive Mrs. Hutter's embrace. Carley saw
dim eyes--the stress of agitation, but no surprise.

"Oh, Carley!" burst out the Western girl, with voice rich and full, yet tremulous.

"Flo, I've come to wish you happiness," replied Carley, very low.

Was it the same Flo? This seemed more of a woman--strange now--white and strained--beautiful,
eager, questioning. In a number of passages, however, Rapin depends solely on the Ancients. Two
examples will suffice to illustrate his absolutism. At the beginning of "The Second Part,"
when he is inquiring "into the nature of Pastoral," he admits: And this must needs be a hard
Task, since I have no guide, neither Aristotle nor Horace to direct me.... And I am of opinion
that none can treat well and clearly of any kind of Poetry if he
hath no helps from these two (p. 16).

 The nervous agitation of these
women had stilled her own. "I just rode up the trail. Where is he?"

"He was here--a moment ago," panted Flo. "Oh, Carley, we sure are locoed. ... Why, we only
heard an hour ago--that you were at Deep Lake.... Charley rode in. He told us.... I thought
my heart would break. Poor Glenn! When he heard it.... But never mind me. Jump your horse and
run to West Fork!"

The spirit of her was like the strength of her arms as she hurried Carley across the porch
and shoved her down the steps.

"Climb on and run, Carley," cried Flo. "If you only knew how glad he'll be that you came!"

Carley leaped into the saddle and wheeled the mustang. But she had no answer for the girl's
singular, almost wild exultance. Then like a shot the spirited mustang was off down the lane.
Carley wondered with swelling heart. Was her coming such a wondrous surprise--so unexpected
and big in generosity--something that would make Kilbourne as glad as it had seemed to make
Flo? Carley thrilled to this assurance.

Down the lane she flew. The red walls blurred and the sweet wind whipped her face. At the trail
she swerved the mustang, but did not check his gait. Under the great pines he sped and round
the bulging wall. At the rocky incline leading to the creek she pulled the fiery animal to
a trot. How low and clear the water! As Carley forded it fresh cool drops splashed into her
face. Again she spurred her mount and again trees and walls rushed by. Up and down the yellow
bits of trail--on over the brown mats of pine needles--until there in the sunlight shone the
little gray log cabin with a tall form standing in the door. One instant the canyon tilted
on end for Carley and she was riding into the blue sky. Then some magic of soul sustained her,
so that she saw clearly. Reaching the cabin she reined in her mustang.

"Hello, Glenn! Look who's here!" she cried, not wholly failing of gayety.

He threw up his sombrero.

"Whoopee!" he yelled, in stentorian voice that rolled across the canyon and bellowed in hollow
echo and then clapped from wall to wall. The unexpected Western yell, so strange from Glenn,
disconcerted Carley. Had he only answered her spirit of greeting? Had hers rung false?

But he was coming to her. She had seen the bronze of his face turn to white. How gaunt and
worn he looked. Older he appeared, with deeper lines and whiter hair. His jaw quivered.

"Carley Burch, so it was you?" he queried, hoarsely.

"Glenn, I reckon it was," she replied. "I bought your Deep Lake ranch site. I came back too
late.... But it is never too late for some things.... I've come to wish you and Flo all the
happiness in the world--and to say we must be friends."

The way he looked at her made her tremble. He strode up beside the mustang, and he was so tall
that his shoulder came abreast of her. He placed a big warm hand on hers, as it rested, ungloved,
on the pommel of the saddle.

"Have you seen Flo?" he asked.

"I just left her. It was funny--the way she rushed me off after you. As if there weren't two--"

Was it Glenn's eyes or the movement of his hand that checked her utterance? His gaze pierced
her soul. His hand slid along her arm to her waist--around it. Her heart seemed to burst.

"Kick your feet out of the stirrups," he ordered.

Instinctively she obeyed. Then with a strong pull he hauled her half out of the saddle, pellmell
into his arms. Carley had no resistance. She sank limp, in an agony of amaze. Was this a dream?
Swift and hard his lips met hers--and again--and again....

"Oh, my God!--Glenn, are--you--mad?" she whispered, almost swooning.

"Sure--I reckon I am," he replied, huskily, and pulled her all the way out of the saddle. 

The calm and more philosophical observation of subsequent travellers, however, soon discovered
that the so-called hermaphrodites were men in female attire, associating
with the women, and partaking of all their labours and occupations.

 How his face blurred in her dimmed sight!
Was that a strange smile? Then he held her back from him.

"Carley--you came to wish Flo and me happiness?" he asked.

"Oh, yes--yes.... Pity me, Glenn--let me go. I meant well.... I should--never have come."

"Do you love me?" he went on, with passionate, shaking clasp.

"God help me--I do--I do!... And now it will kill me!"

"What did that damned fool Charley tell you?"

The strange content of his query, the trenchant force of it, brought her upright, with sight
suddenly cleared. Was this giant the tragic Glenn who had strode to her from the cabin door?

"Charley told me--you and Flo--were married," she whispered.

"You didn't believe him!" returned Glenn.

She could no longer speak. She could only see her lover, as if transfigured, limned dark against
the looming red wall.

"That was one of Charley's queer jokes. I told you to beware of him. Flo is married, yes--and
very happy.... I'm unutterably happy, too--but I'm not married. Lee Stanton was the lucky bridegroom....
Carley, the moment I saw you I knew you had come back to me."
