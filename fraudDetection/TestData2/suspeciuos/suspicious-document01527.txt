"

"Oh, no!" said Miss Baker, plaintively.

"I gave him no encouragement--none whatever;--used to send him here and there--anything to
get rid of him. Sometimes I thought--" and then Miss Todd hesitated.

"Thought what?" asked Miss Baker.

"Well, I don't want to be ill-natured; but sometimes I thought that he wanted to borrow money,
and didn't exactly know how to begin."

"To borrow money!" He had once borrowed money from Miss Baker.

"Well, I don't know; I only say I thought so. He never did."

Miss Baker sighed again, and then there was a slight pause in the conversation.

"But, Miss Todd--"

"Well, my dear!"

"Do you think that--"

"Think what? Speak out, my dear; you may before me. If you've got any secret, I'll keep it."

"Oh! I've got no secret; only this. Do you think that Sir Lionel is--is poor--that he should
want to borrow money?"

"Well; poor! I hardly know what you call poor. But we all know that he is a distressed man.
I suppose he has a good income, and a little ready money would, perhaps, set him up; but there's
no doubt about his being over head and ears in debt, I suppose."

This seemed to throw a new and unexpected light on Miss Baker's mind. "I thought he was always
so very respectable," said she.

"Hum-m-m!" said Miss Todd, who knew the world.

"Eh?" said Miss Baker, who did not.

"It depends on what one means by respectable," said Miss Todd.

"I really thought he was so very--"

"Hum-m-m-m," repeated Miss Todd, shaking her head.

And then there was a little conversation carried on between these ladies so entirely sotto
voce that the reporter of this scene was unable to hear a word of it. But this he could see,
that Miss Todd bore by far the greater part in it.

At the end of it, Miss Baker gave another, and a longer, and a deeper sigh. "But you know,
my dear," said Miss Todd, in her most consolatory voice, and these words were distinctly audible,
"nothing does a man of that sort so much good as marrying."

"Does it?" asked Miss Baker.

"Certainly; if his wife knows how to manage him."

And then Miss Todd departed, leaving Miss Baker with much work for her thoughts. Her female
friend Miss Baker had quite forgiven; but she felt that she could never quite forgive him.
"To have deceived me so!" she said to herself, recurring to her old idea of his great respectability.
But, nevertheless, it was probably his other sin that rankled deepest in her mind.

Of Miss Baker it may be said that she had hardly touched the pitch; at any rate, that it had
not defiled her.

Sir Lionel was somewhat ill at ease as he walked from the Paragon to his livery stables. He
had certainly looked upon success with Miss Todd as by no means sure; but, nevertheless, he
was disappointed. Let any of us, in any attempt that we may make, convince ourselves with ever
so much firmness that we shall fail, yet we are hardly the less down-hearted when the failure
comes. We assure ourselves that we are not sanguine, but we assure ourselves falsely. It is
man's nature to be sanguine; his nature, and perhaps his greatest privilege.

And Sir Lionel, as he walked along, began to fear that his own scruples would now stand in
the way of that other marriage--of that second string to his bow. When, in making his little
private arrangements within his own mind, he had decided that if Miss Todd rejected him he
would forthwith walk off to Miss Baker, it never occurred to him that his own feelings would
militate against such a proceeding. But such was now absolutely the fact. Having talked about
"dear Sarah," he found that even he would have a difficulty in bringing himself to the utterance
of "dear Mary."

He went to bed, however, that night with the comfortable reflection that any such nonsense
would be dissipated by the morning. But when the morning came--his morning, one P.M.--his feeling
he found was the same. He could not see Miss Baker that day.

He was disgusted and disappointed with himself. He had flattered himself that he was gifted
with greater firmness; and now that he found himself so wanting in strength of character, he
fretted and fumed, as men will do, even at their own faults. He swore to himself that he would
go to-morrow, and that evening went to bed early, trying to persuade himself that indigestion
had weakened him. He did great injustice, however, to as fine a set of internal organs as ever
blessed a man of sixty.

At two o'clock next day he dressed himself for the campaign in Montpellier Terrace; but when
dressed he was again disorganised. He found that he could not do it. He told himself over and
over again that with Miss Baker there need be no doubt; she, at least, would accept him. He
had only to smile there, and she would smile again. He had only to say "dear Mary," and those
soft eyes would be turned to the ground and the battle would be won.

But still he could not do it. He was sick; he was ill; he could not eat his breakfast. He looked
in the glass, and found himself to be yellow, and wrinkled, and wizened. He was not half himself.
There were yet three weeks before Miss Baker would leave Littlebath. It was on the whole better
that his little arrangement should be made immediately previous to her departure. He would
leave Littlebath for ten days, and return a new man. So he went up to London, and bestowed
his time upon his son.

At the end of the ten days much of his repugnance had worn off. But still the sound of that
word "Sarah," and the peal of laughter which followed, rang in his ears. That utterance of
the verbiage of love is a disagreeable task for a gentleman of his years. He had tried it,
and found it very disagreeable. He would save himself a repetition of the nuisance and write
to her.

He did so. His letter was not very long. He said nothing about "Mary" in it, but contented
himself with calling her his dearest friend. A few words were sufficient to make her understand
what he meant, and those few words were there. He merely added a caution, that for both their
sakes, the matter had better not at present be mentioned to anybody.

Miss Baker, when she received this letter, had almost recovered her equanimity. Hers had been
a soft and gentle sorrow. She had had no fits of bursting grief; her wailings had been neither
loud nor hysterical. A gentle, soft, faint tinge of melancholy had come upon her; so that she
had sighed much as she sat at her solitary tea, and had allowed her novel to fall uncared for
to the ground. "Would it not be well for her," she said to herself more than once, "to go to
Hadley? Would not any change be well for her?" She felt now that Caroline's absence was a heavy
blow to her, and that it would be well that she should leave Littlebath. It was astonishing
how this affair of Miss Todd's reconciled her to her future home.

And then, when she was thus tranquil, thus resigned, thus all but happy, came this tremendous
letter, upsetting her peace of mind, and throwing her into a new maze of difficulties.

She had never said to herself at any time that if Sir Lionel did propose she would accept him.
She had never questioned herself as to the probability of such an event. That she would have
accepted him a fortnight ago, there can be no doubt; but what was she to do now?

It was not only that Sir Lionel had made another tender of his hand to another lady ten or
twelve days since, but to this must be added the fact that all Littlebath knew that he had
done so. Miss Todd, after the first ebullition of her comic spleen, had not said much about
it; but Miss P. Gauntlet's tongue had not been idle. She, perhaps, had told it only to the
godly; but the godly, let them be ever so exclusive, must have some intercourse with the wicked
world; and thus every lady in Littlebath now knew all about it. And then there were other difficulties.
That whispered conversation still rang in her ears. She was not quite sure how far it might
be her mission to reclaim such a man as Sir Lionel--this new Sir Lionel whom Miss Todd had
described. And then, too, he was in want of money. Why, she was in want of money herself!

But was there not something also to be said on the other side? It is reported that unmarried
ladies such as Miss Baker generally regret the forlornness of their own condition. If so, the
fault is not their own, but must be attributed to the social system to which they belong. The
English world is pleased to say that an unmarried lady past forty has missed her hit in life--has
omitted to take her tide at the ebb; and what can unmarried ladies do but yield to the world's
dictum? That the English world may become better informed, and learn as speedily as may be
to speak with more sense on the subject, let us all pray.

But, in the meantime, the world's dictum was strong at Littlebath, and did influence this dear
lady. She would prefer the name of Lady Bertram to that of Miss Baker for the remainder of
the term of years allotted to her. It would please her to walk into a room as a married woman,
and to quit herself of that disgrace, which injustice and prejudice, and the folly of her own
sex rather than of the other, had so cruelly attached to her present position. And then, to
be Lady Bertram! There were but few angels at this time in Littlebath, and Miss Baker was not
one of them: she had a taint of vanity in her composition; but we doubt if such female vanity
could exist in any human breast in a more pardonable form than it did in hers.

And then, perhaps, this plan of marrying might have the wished-for effect on Sir Lionel's way
of living;--and how desirable was this! Would it not be a splendid work for her to reclaim
a lost colonel? Might it not be her duty to marry him with this special object?

There certainly did appear to be some difficulty as to money. If, as Miss Todd assured her,
Sir Lionel were really in difficulties, her own present annuity--all that she could absolutely
call her own--her one hundred and eighty-nine pounds, seventeen shillings and threepence per
annum--would not help them much. Sir Lionel was at any rate disinterested in his offer; that
at least was clear to her.

And then a sudden light broke in upon her meditations. Sir Lionel and the old gentleman were
at variance. We allude to the old gentleman at Hadley: with the other old gentleman, of whom
we wot, it may be presumed that Sir Lionel was on tolerably favourable terms. Might not she
be the means of bringing the two brothers together? If she were Lady Bertram, would not the
old gentleman receive Sir Lionel back to his bosom for her sake--to his bosom, and also to
his purse? But before she took any step in the dark, she resolved to ask the old gentleman
the question.

It is true that Sir Lionel had desired her to speak to no person on the subject; but that injunction
of course referred to strangers. It could not but be expected that on such a matter she should
consult her best friends. Sir Lionel had also enjoined a speedy answer; and in order that she
might not disappoint him in this matter, she resolved to put the question at once to Mr. Bertram.
Great measures require great means. She would herself go to Hadley on the morrow--and so she
wrote a letter that night, to beg that her uncle would expect her.

"So; you got tired of Littlebath before the month was out?" said he.

"Oh! but I am going back again."

"Going back again! Then why the d---- have you come up now?" Alas! it was too clear that the
old gentleman was not in one of his more pacific moods.

As these words were spoken, Miss Baker was still standing in the passage, that she might see
her box brought in from the fly. She of course had on her bonnet, and thickest shawl, and cloak.
She had thick boots on also, and an umbrella in her hand. The maid was in the passage, and
so was the man who had driven her. She was very cold, and her nose was blue, and her teeth
chattered. She could not tell her tale of love in such guise, or to such audience.

"What the d---- has brought you up?" repeated the old gentleman, standing with his two sticks
at the sitting-room door. He did not care who heard him, or how cold it was, or of what nature
might be her present mission. He knew that an extra journey from Littlebath to London and back,
flys and porters included, would cost two pounds ten shillings. He knew, or thought that he
knew, that this might have been avoided. He also knew that his rheumatism plagued him, that
his old bones were sore, that he could not sleep at night, that he could not get into the city
to see how things went, and that the game was coming to an end with him, and that the grave
was claiming him. It was not surprising that the old gentleman should be cross.

"I'll tell you if you'll let me come into the room," said Miss Baker. "Take the box upstairs,
Mary. Half a crown! oh no, two shillings will be quite enough." This economy was assumed to
pacify the old gentleman; but it did not have the desired effect. "One and sixpence," he holloed
out from his crutches. "Don't give him a halfpenny more."

"Please, sir, the luggage, sir," said the fly driver.

"Luggage!" shouted the old man. His limbs were impotent, but his voice was not; and the fly-driver
shook in his shoes.

"There," said Miss Baker, insidiously giving the man two and threepence. "I shall not give
you a farthing more." It is to be feared that she intended her uncle to think that his limit
had not been exceeded.

And then she was alone with Mr. Bertram. Her nose was still blue, and her toes still cold;
but at any rate she was alone with him. It was hard for her to tell her tale; and she thoroughly
wished herself back at Littlebath; but, nevertheless, she did tell it. The courage of women
in some conditions of life surpasses anything that man can do.

"I want to consult you about that," said she, producing Sir Lionel's letter.

The old gentleman took it, and looked at it, and turned it. "What! it's from that swindler,
is it?" said he.

"It's from Sir Lionel," said Miss Baker, trembling. There were as yet no promising auspices
for the fraternal reconciliation.

"Yes; I see who it's from--and what is it all about? I shan't read it. You can tell me, I suppose,
what's in it."

"I had hoped that perhaps, sir, you and he might--"

"Might what?"

"Be brought together as brothers and friends."

"Brothers and friends! One can't choose one's brother; but who would choose to be the friend
of a swindler? Is that what the letter is about?"

"Not exactly that, Mr. Bertram."

"Then what the d---- is it?"

"Sir Lionel, sir, has made me--"

"Made you what? Put your name to a bill, I suppose."

"No; indeed he has not. Nothing of that kind."

"Then what has he made you do?"

"He has not made me do anything; but he has sent me--an--an offer of marriage." And poor Miss
Baker, with her blue nose, looked up so innocently, so imploringly, so trustingly, that any
one but Mr. Bertram would have comforted her.

"An offer of marriage from Sir Lionel!" said he.

"Yes," said Miss Baker, timidly. "Here it is; and I have come up to consult you about the answer."
Mr. Bertram now did take the letter, and did read it through.

"Well!" he said, closing his eyes and shaking his head gently. "Well!"

"I thought it better to do nothing without seeing you. And that is what has brought me to Hadley
in such a hurry."

"The audacious, impudent scoundrel!"

"You think, then, that I should refuse him?"

"You are a fool, an ass! a downright old soft-headed fool!" Such was the old gentleman's answer
to her question.

"But I didn't know what to say without consulting you," said Miss Baker, with her handkerchief
to her face.

"Not know! Don't you know that he's a swindler, a reprobate, a penniless adventurer? Good heavens!
And you are such a fool as that! It's well that you are not to be left at Littlebath by yourself."

Miss Baker made no attempt to defend herself, but, bursting into tears, assured her uncle that
she would be guided by him. Under his absolute dictation she wrote the enclosed short answer
to Sir Lionel.

   Hadley, January --, 184--.

   Dear Sir,

   Mr. Bertram says that it will be sufficient to let you
   know that he would not give me a penny during his life,
   or leave me a penny at his death if I were to become your
   wife.

   Yours truly,

   MARY BAKER.

That was all that the old gentleman would allow; but as she folded the letter, she surreptitiously
added the slightest imaginable postscript to explain the matter--such words as occurred to
her at the spur of the moment.

"He is so angry about it all!"

After that Miss Baker was not allowed back to Littlebath, even to pack up or pay her bills,
or say good-bye to those she left behind. The servant had to do it all. Reflecting on the danger
which had been surmounted, Mr. Bertram determined that she should not again be put in the way
of temptation.

And this was the end of Sir Lionel's wooing.

CHAPTER III.

A QUIET LITTLE DINNER.

Sir Henry Harcourt was married and took his bride to Paris and Nice; and Sir Lionel Bertram
tried to get married, but his bride--bride as he hoped her to have been--ran away by herself
to Hadley. In the meantime George Bertram lived alone in his dark dull chambers in London.

He would fain have been all alone; but at what was perhaps the worst moment of his misery,
his father came to him. It may be remembered how anxiously he had longed to know his father
when he first commenced that journey to Jerusalem, how soon he became attached to him, how
fascinated he had been by Sir Lionel's manners, how easily he forgave the first little traits
of un-paternal conduct on his father's part, how gradually the truth forced itself upon his
mind. But now, at this time, the truth had forced itself on his mind. He knew his father for
what he was.

And his mind was not one which could reject such knowledge, or alter the nature of it because
the man was his father. There are those to whom a father's sins, or a husband's sins, or a
brother's sins are no sins at all. And of such one may say, that though we must of compulsion
find their judgment to be in some sort delinquent, that their hearts more than make up for
such delinquency. One knows that they are wrong, but can hardly wish them to be less so.

But George Bertram was not one of them: he had been in no hurry to condemn his father; but,
having seen his sins, he knew them for sins, and did condemn them. He found that his uncle
had been right, and that Sir Lionel was a man whom he could in no wise respect, and could hardly
love. Money he perceived was his father's desire. He would therefore give him what money he
could spare; but he would not give him his society.

When, therefore, Sir Lionel announced his arrival in town and his intention to remain there
some little time, George Bertram was by no means solaced in his misery. In those days he was
very miserable. It was only now that he knew how thoroughly he loved this woman--now that she
was so utterly beyond his reach. Weak and wavering as he was in many things, he was not weak
enough to abandon himself altogether to unavailing sorrow. He knew that work alone could preserve
him from sinking--hard, constant, unflinching work, that one great cure for all our sorrow,
that only means of adapting ourselves to God's providences.

So he set himself to work--not a lazy, listless reading of counted pages; not history at two
volumes a week, or science at a treatise a day; but to such true work as he found it in him
to do, working with all his mind and all his strength. He had already written and was known
as a writer; but he had written under impulse, carelessly, without due regard to his words
or due thought as to his conclusions. He had written things of which he was already ashamed,
and had put forth with the ex cathedra air of an established master ideas which had already
ceased to be his own. But all that should be altered now. Then he had wanted a quick return
for his writing. It had piqued him to think that the names of others, his contemporaries, were
bruited about the world, but that the world knew nothing of his own. Harcourt was already a
noted man, while he himself had done no more than attempted and abandoned a profession. Harcourt's
early success had made him an early author; but he already felt that his authorship was unavailing.
Harcourt's success had been solid, stable, such as men delight in; his had as yet resulted
only in his all but forced withdrawal from the only respectable position which he had achieved.

And now Harcourt's success was again before him. Harcourt had now as his own that which he
had looked to as the goal of all his success, the worldly reward for which he had been willing
to work. And yet what was Harcourt as compared with him? He knew himself to be of a higher
temperament, of a brighter genius, of greater powers. He would not condescend even to compare
himself to this man who had so thoroughly distanced him in the world's race.

Thinking, and feeling, and suffering thus, he had begun to work with all the vehemence of which
he was master. He would ask for no speedy return now. His first object was to deaden the present
misery of his mind; and then, if it might be so, to vindicate his claim to be regarded as one
of England's worthy children, letting such vindication come in its own time.

Such being the state of his mind, his father's arrival did not contribute much to his comfort.
Sir Lionel was rather petulant when he was with him; objected to him that he had played his
cards badly; would talk about Caroline, and, which was almost worse, about the solicitor-general;
constantly urged him to make overtures of reconciliation to his uncle; and wanted one day five
pounds, on another ten pounds, and again on a third fifteen pounds. At this moment George's
fixed income was but two hundred pounds a year, and any other wealth of which he was possessed
was the remainder of his uncle's thousand pounds. When that was gone, he must either live on
his income, small as it was, or write for the booksellers. Such being the case, he felt himself
obliged to decline when the fifteen pounds was mentioned.

"You can let me have it for a couple of months?" said Sir Lionel.

"Not conveniently," said his son.

"I will send it you back immediately on my return to Littlebath," said the father; "so if you
have got it by you, pray oblige me."

"I certainly have got it," said the son--and he handed him the desired check; "but I think
you should remember, sir, how very small my income is, and that there is no prospect of its
being increased."

"It must be altogether your own fault then," said the colonel, pocketing the money. "I never
knew a young man who had a finer hand of cards put into his hand--never; if you have played
it badly, it is your own fault, altogether your own fault." In truth, Sir Lionel did really
feel that his son had used him badly, and owed him some amends. Had George but done his duty,
he might now have been the actual recognized heir of his uncle's wealth, and the actual possessor
of as much as would have been allowed to a dutiful, obedient son. To a man of Sir Lionel's
temperament, it was annoying that there should be so much wealth so near him, and yet absolutely,
and, alas! probably for ever out of his reach.

Sir Lionel had resolved to wait in London for his answer, and there he received it. Short as
was poor Miss Baker's letter, it was quite sufficiently explicit. She had betrayed him to the
old gentleman, and after that all hopes of money from that source were over. It might still
be possible for him to talk over Miss Baker, but such triumph would be but barren. Miss Baker
with a transferred allegiance--transferred from the old gentleman to him--would be but a very
indifferent helpmate. He learnt, however, from Littlebath that she was still away, and would
probably not return. Then he went back in fancied security, and found himself the centre of
all those amatory ovations which Miss Todd and Miss Gauntlet had prepared for him.

It was about two months after this that George Bertram saw Sir Henry Harcourt for the first
time after the marriage. He had heard that Sir Henry was in town, had heard of the blaze of
their new house in Eaton Square, had seen in the papers how magnificently Lady Harcourt had
appeared at court, how well she graced her brilliant home, how fortunate the world esteemed
that young lawyer who, having genius, industry, and position of his own, had now taken to himself
in marriage beauty, wealth, and social charms. All this George Bertram heard and read, and
hearing it and reading it had kept himself from the paths in which such petted children of
fortune might probably be met.

Twice in the course of these two months did Sir Henry call at Bertram's chambers; but Bertram
was now at home to no one. He lived in a great desert, in which was no living being but himself--in
a huge desert without water and without grass, in which there was no green thing. He was alone;
to one person only had he spoken of his misery; once only had he thought of escaping from it.
That thought had been in vain: that companion was beyond his reach; and, therefore, living
there in his London chambers, he had been all alone.

But at last they did meet. Sir Henry, determined not to be beaten in his attempt to effect
a reconciliation, wrote to him, saying that he would call, and naming an hour. "Caroline and
you," he said, "are cousins; there can be no reason why you should be enemies. For her sake,
if not for mine, do oblige me in this."

Bertram sat for hours with that note beneath his eyes before he could bring himself to answer
it. Could it really be that she desired to see him again? That she, in her splendour and first
glow of prosperous joy, would wish to encounter him in his dreary, sad, deserted misery? And
why could she wish it? and, ah! how could she wish it?

And then he asked himself whether he also would wish to see her. That he still loved her, loved
her as he never had done while she was yet his own, he had often told himself. That he could
never be at rest till he had ceased to make her the first object of his thoughts he had said
as often. That he ought not to see her, he knew full well. The controversy within his own bosom
was carried on for two hours, and then he wrote to Sir Henry, saying that he would be at his
chambers at the hour named. From that moment the salutary effort was discontinued, the work
was put aside, and the good that had been done was all revoked.

Sir Henry came, true to his appointment. Whatever might be his object, he was energetic in
it. He was now a man of many concernments; hours were scanty with him, and a day much too short.
The calls of clients, and the calls of party, joined to those other calls which society makes
upon men in such brilliant stations, hardly left him time for sleeping; but not the less urgent
was he in his resolve to see his beaten rival who would so willingly have left him to his brilliant
joy. But was not all this explained long even before Christianity was in vogue? "Quos Deus
vult perdere, prius dementat." Whom God will confound, those he first maddens.

Nothing could exceed the bland friendship, the winning manners, and the frank courtesy of Sir
Henry. He said but little about what was past; but that little went to show that he had been
blessed with the hand of Caroline Waddington only because Bertram had rejected that blessing
as not worthy his acceptance. Great man as he was, he almost humbled himself before Bertram's
talent. He spoke of their mutual connection at Hadley as though they two were his heirs of
right, and as though their rights were equal; and then he ended by begging that they might
still be friends.

"Our careers must be widely different," said Bertram, somewhat touched by his tone; "yours
will be in the light; mine must be in the dark."

"Most men who do any good live in the dark for some period of their lives," said Harcourt.
"I, too, have had my dark days, and doubtless shall have them again; but neither with you nor
with me will they endure long."

Bertram thought that Harcourt knew nothing about it, and sneered when the successful man talked
of his dark days. What darkness had his mental eyesight ever known? We are all apt to think
when our days are dark that there is no darkness so dark as our own.

"I know what your feelings are," continued Sir Henry; "and I hope you will forgive me if I
speak openly. You have resolved not to meet Caroline. My object is to make you put aside that
resolve. It is my object and hers also. It is out of the question that you should continue
to avoid the world. Your walk in life will be that of a literary man: but nowadays literary
men become senators and statesmen. They have high rank, are well paid, and hold their own boldly
against men of meaner capacities. This is the career that we both foresee for you; and in that
career we both hope to be your friends."

So spoke the great advocate with suasive eloquence--with eloquence dangerously suasive as regarded
his own happiness. But in truth this man knew not what love meant--not that love which those
two wretched lovers understood so well. That his own wife was cold to him, cold as ice--that
he well knew. That Bertram had flung her from him because she had been cold to him--that he
believed. That he himself could live without any passionate love--that he acknowledged. His
wife was graceful and very beautiful--all the world confessed that. And thus Sir Henry was
contented. Those honeymoon days had indeed been rather dreary. Once or twice before that labour
was over he had been almost tempted to tell her that he had paid too high for the privilege
of pressing such an icicle to his bosom. But he had restrained himself; and now in the blaze
of the London season, passing his mornings in courts of law and his evenings in the House of
Parliament, he flattered himself that he was a happy man.

"Come and dine with us in a quiet way the day after to-morrow," said Sir Henry, "and then the
ice will be broken." George Bertram said that he would; and from that moment his studies were
at an end.

This occurred on the Monday. The invitation was for the following Wednesday. Sir Henry explained
that from some special cause he would be relieved from parliamentary attendance, at any rate
till ten o'clock; that at the quiet dinner there would be no other guests except Mr. and Mrs.
Stistick, and Baron Brawl, whose wife and family were not yet in town.

"You'll like the baron," said Harcourt; "he's loud and arrogant, no doubt; but he's not loud
and arrogant about nothing, as some men are. Stistick is a bore. Of course you know him. He's
member for Peterloo, and goes with us on condition that somebody listens to him about once
a week. But the baron will put him down."

"And Mrs. Stistick?" said George.

"I never heard of her till yesterday, and Caroline has gone to call on her to-day. It's rather
a bore for her, for they live somewhere half-way to Harrow, I believe. Half-past seven. Good-bye,
old fellow. I ought to have been before Baron Brawl at Westminster twenty minutes since." And
so the solicitor-general, rushing out from the Temple, threw himself into a cab; and as the
wheels rattled along the Strand, he made himself acquainted with the contents of his brief.

Why should Caroline have expressed a wish to see him? That was the thought that chiefly rested
in Bertram's mind when Sir Henry left him. Why should it be an object to her to force a meeting
between her and him? Would it not be better for them both that they should be far as the poles
asunder?

"Well," he said to himself, "if it be no difficulty to her, neither shall it be a difficulty
to me. She is strong-minded, and I will be so no less. I will go and meet her. It is but the
first plunge that gives the shock."

And thus he closed his work, and sat moodily thinking. He was angry with her in that she could
endure to see him; but, alas! half-pleased also that she should wish to do so. He had no thought,
no most distant thought, that she could ever now be more to him than the wife of an acquaintance
whom he did not love too well. But yet there was in his heart some fragment of half-satisfied
vanity at hearing that she did look forward to see him once again.

And how shall we speak of such a wish on her part? "Caroline," her husband had said to her
at breakfast, "it will be all nonsense for you and George Bertram to keep up any kind of quarrel.
I hate nonsense of that sort."

"There is no quarrel between us," she replied.

"There ought to be none; and I shall get him to come here."

The colour of her face became slightly heightened as she answered: "If you wish it, Sir Henry,
and he wishes it also, I shall not object."

"I do wish it, certainly. I think it absolutely necessary as regards my position with your
grandfather."

"Do just as you think best," said his wife. 'Twas thus that Lady Harcourt had expressed her
desire to see George Bertram at her house. Had he known the truth, that fragment of half-satisfied
vanity would have been but small.

In those early days of her marriage, Lady Harcourt bore her triumphs very placidly. She showed
no great elation at the change that had come over her life. Her aunt from Hadley was frequently
with her, and wondered to find her so little altered, or rather, in some respects, so much
altered; for she was more considerate in her manner, more sparing of her speech, much less
inclined to domineer now, as Lady Harcourt, than in former days she had ever been as Caroline
Waddington. She went constantly into society, and was always much considered; but her triumphs
were mainly of that quiet nature which one sometimes sees to be achieved with so little effort
by beautiful women. It seemed but necessary that she should sit still, and sometimes smile,
and the world was ready to throw itself at her feet. Nay, the smile was but too often omitted,
and yet the world was there.

At home, though more employed, she was hardly more energetic. Her husband told her that he
wished his house to be noted for the pleasantness of his dinner-parties, and, therefore, she
studied the subject as a good child would study a lesson. She taught herself what the material
of a dinner should be, she satisfied herself that her cook was good, she looked to the brilliancy
of her appointments, and did her best to make the house shine brightly. The house did shine,
and on the whole Sir Henry was contented. It was true that his wife did not talk much; but
what little she did say was said with a sweet manner and with perfect grace. She was always
dressed with care, was always beautiful, was always ladylike. Had not Sir Henry reason to be
contented? As for talking, he could do that himself.

And now that she was told that George Bertram was to come to her house, she did not show much
more excitement at the tidings than at the promised advent of Mr. Baron Brawl. She took the
matter with such indifference that Sir Henry, at least, had no cause for jealousy. But then
she was indifferent about everything. Nothing seemed to wake her either to joy or sorrow. Sir
Henry, perhaps, was contented; but lovely, ladylike, attractive as she was, he sometimes did
feel almost curious to know whether it were possible to rouse this doll of his to any sense
of life or animation. He had thought, nay, almost wished, that the name of her old lover would
have moved her, that the idea of seeing him would have disturbed her. But, no; one name was
the same to her as another. She had been told to go and call on Mrs. Stistick, and she had
gone. She was told to receive Mr. Bertram, and she was quite ready to do so. Angels from heaven,
or spirits from below, could Sir Henry have summoned such to his table, would have been received
by her with equal equanimity. This was dutiful on her part, and naturally satisfactory to a
husband inclined to be somewhat exigeant. But even duty may pall on an exigeant husband, and
a man may be brought to wish that his wife would cross him.

But on this occasion Sir Henry had no such pleasure. "I saw Bertram this morning," he said,
when he went home for five minutes before taking his seat in the House for the night. "He's
to be here on Wednesday."

"Oh, very well. There will be six, then." She said no more. It was clear that the dinner, and
that only, was on her mind. He had told her to be careful about his dinners, and therefore
could not complain. But, nevertheless, he was almost vexed. Don't let any wife think that she
will satisfy her husband by perfect obedience. Overmuch virtue in one's neighbours is never
satisfactory to us sinners.

But there were moments in which Lady Harcourt could think of her present life, when no eye
was by to watch her--no master there to wonder at her perfections. Moments! nay, but there
were hours, and hours, and hours. There were crowds of hours; slow, dull, lingering hours,
in which she had no choice but to think of it. A woman may see to her husband's dinners and
her own toilet, and yet have too much time for thinking. It would almost have been a comfort
to Lady Harcourt if Sir Henry could have had a dinner-party every day.

How should she bear herself; what should she say; how should she look when George Bertram came
there as a guest to her house? How could he be so cruel, so heartless, so inhuman as to come
there? Her path was difficult enough for her poor weary feet. He must know that--should, at
any rate, have known it. How could he be so cruel as to add this great stumbling-block to her
other perils?

The Wednesday came, and at half-past seven she was in her drawing-room as beautiful and as
dignified as ever. She had a peculiar place of her own in the corner of a peculiar sofa, and
there she lived. It was her goddess' shrine, and her worshippers came and did reverence before
her. None came and sat beside her. Hers was not that gentle fascination which entices men,
and women too, to a near proximity. Her bow was very gracious, and said much; but "noli me
tangere" was part of its eloquence. And so Baron Brawl found, when on entering her drawing-room
he told her that the fame of her charms had reached his ears, and that he was delighted to
have an opportunity of making her acquaintance.

Mr. and Mrs. Stistick were the next comers. Mrs. Stistick sat herself down on an opposite sofa,
and seemed to think that she did her duty to society by sitting there. And so she did. Only
permit her so to sit, and there was no further labour in entertaining Mrs. Stistick. She was
a large, heavy woman, with a square forehead and a square chin, and she had brought up seven
children most successfully. Now, in these days of her husband's parliamentary prosperity, she
was carried about to dinners; and in her way she enjoyed them. She was not too shy to eat,
and had no wish whatever either to be talked to or to talk. To sit easily on a sofa and listen
to the buzz of voices was life and society to her. Perhaps in those long hours she was meditating
on her children's frocks or her husband's linen. But they never seemed to be long to her.

Mr. Stistick was standing on the rug before the fire, preparing for his first onslaught on
Baron Brawl, when the servant announced Mr. Bertram.

"Ah! Bertram, I'm delighted to see you," said Sir Henry;--"doubly so, as dinner is ready. Judge,
you know my friend Bertram, by name, at any rate?" and some sort of half-introduction was performed.
"He who moved all Oxford from its propriety?" said the baron. But Bertram neither saw him nor
heard him. Neither his eyes nor his ears were at his command.

As he took his host's proffered hand, he glanced his eyes for a moment round the room. There
she sat, and he had to speak to her as best he might. At his last interview with her he had
spoken freely enough, and it all rushed now upon his mind. Then how little he had made of her,
how lightly he had esteemed her! Now, as she sat there before him his spirit acknowledged her
as a goddess, and he all but feared to address her. His face, he knew, was hot and red; his
manner, he felt, was awkward. He was not master of himself, and when such is the case with
a man, the fact always betrays itself.

But he did speak to her. "How do you do, Lady Harcourt?" he said, and he put his hand out,
and he felt the ends of her fingers once more within his own.

And she spoke too, probably. But pretty women can say almost as much as is necessary on such
occasions as this without opening their lips. Whether she spoke, or whether she did not, it
was the same to him. He certainly did not hear her. But her fingers did touch his hand, her
eyes did rest upon his face; and then, in that moment of time, he thought of Jerusalem, of
the Mount of Olives, of those rides at Littlebath, and of that last meeting, when all, all
had been shattered to pieces.

"There are five hundred and fifty-five thousand male children between the ages of nine and
twelve," said Mr. Stistick, pursuing some wondrous line of argument, as Bertram turned himself
towards the fire.

"What a fine national family!" said the baron. "And how ashamed I feel when I bethink myself
that only one of them is mine!"

"Dinner is served," said the butler.

"Mrs. Stistick, will you allow me?" said Sir Henry. And then in half a minute Bertram found
himself walking down to dinner with the member of Parliament. "And we have school accommodation
for just one hundred and fourteen," continued that gentleman on the stairs. "Now, will you
tell me what becomes of the other four hundred and forty-one?"

Bertram was not at that moment in a condition to give him any information on the subject.

"I can tell you about the one," said the baron, as Sir Henry began his grace.

"An odd thousand is nothing," said Mr. Stistick, pausing for a second till the grace was over.

The judge and Mr. Stistick sat at Lady Harcourt's right and left, so that Bertram was not called
upon to say much to her during dinner. The judge talked incessantly, and so did the member
of Parliament, and so also did the solicitor-general. A party of six is always a talking party.
Men and women are not formed into pairs, and do not therefore become dumb. Each person's voice
makes another person emulous, and the difficulty felt is not as to what one shall say, but
how one shall get it in. Ten, and twelve, and fourteen are the silent numbers.

Every now and again Harcourt endeavoured to make Bertram join in the conversation; and Bertram
did make some faint attempts. He essayed to answer some of Mr. Stistick's very difficult inquiries,
and was even roused to parry some raillery from the judge. But he was not himself; and Caroline,
who could not but watch him narrowly as she sat there in her silent beauty, saw that he was
not so. She arraigned him in her mind for want of courage; but had he been happy, and noisy,
and light of heart, she would probably have arraigned him for some deeper sin.

"As long as the matter is left in the hands of the parents, nothing on earth will be done,"
said Mr. Stistick.

"That's what I have always said to Lady Brawl," said the judge.

"And it's what I have said to Lord John; and what I intend to say to him again. Lord John is
all very well--"

"Thank you, Stistick. I am glad, at any rate, to get as much as that from you," said the solicitor.

"Lord John is all very well," continued the member, not altogether liking the interruption;
"but there is only one man in the country who thoroughly understands the subject, and who is
able--"

"And I don't see the slightest probability of finding a second," said the judge.

"And who is able to make himself heard."

"What do you say, Lady Harcourt," asked the baron, "as to the management of a school with--how
many millions of them, Mr. Stistick?"

"Five hundred and fifty-five thousand male children--"

"Suppose we say boys," said the judge.

"Boys?" asked Mr. Stistick, not quite understanding him, but rather disconcerted by the familiarity
of the word.

"Well, I suppose they must be boys;--at least the most of them."

"They are all from nine to twelve, I say," continued Mr. Stistick, completely bewildered.

"Oh, that alters the question," said the judge.

"Not at all," said Mr. Stistick. "There is accommodation for only--"

"Well, we'll ask Lady Harcourt. What do you say, Lady Harcourt?"

Lady Harcourt felt herself by no means inclined to enter into the joke on either side; so she
said, with her gravest smile, "I'm sure Mr. Stistick understands very well what he's talking
about."

"What do you say, ma'am?" said the judge, turning round to the lady on his left.

"Mr. Stistick is always right on such matters," said the lady.

"See what it is to have a character. It absolutely enables one to upset the laws of human nature.
But still I do say, Mr. Solicitor, that the majority of them were probably boys."

"Boys!" exclaimed the member of Parliament. "Boys! I don't think you can have understood a
word that we have been saying."

"I don't think I have," said the baron.

"There are five hundred and fifty-five thousand male children between--"

"Oh--h--h! male children! Ah--h--h! Now I see the difference; I beg your pardon, Mr. Stistick,
but I really was very stupid. And you mean to explain all this to Lord John in the present
session?"

"But, Stistick, who is the one man?" said Sir Henry.

"The one man is Lord Boanerges. He, I believe, is the only man living who really understands
the social wants of this kingdom."

"And everything else also," sneered the baron. The baron always sneered at cleverness that
was external to his own profession, especially when exhibited by one who, like the noble lord
named, should have confined his efforts to that profession.

"So Boanerges is to take in hand these male children? And very fitting, too; he was made to
be a schoolmaster."

"He is the first man of the age; don't you think so, Sir Henry?"

"He was, certainly, when he was on the woolsack," said Sir Henry. "That is the normal position
always assumed by the first man of his age in this country."

"Though some of them when there do hide their lights under a bushel," said the judge.

"He is the first law reformer that perhaps ever lived," said Mr. Stistick, enthusiastically.

"And I hope will be the last in my time," said his enemy.

"I hope he will live to complete his work," said the politician.

"Then Methuselah will be a child to him, and Jared and Lamech little babies," said the judge.

"In such case he has got his work before him, certainly," said Mr. Solicitor.

And so the battle was kept up between them, and George Bertram and Lady Harcourt sat by and
listened; or more probably, perhaps, sat by and did not listen.

But when her ladyship and Mrs. Stistick had retreated--Oh, my readers, fancy what that next
hour must have been to Caroline Harcourt!--How Gothic, how barbarous are we still in our habits,
in that we devote our wives to such wretchedness as that! O, lady, has it ever been your lot
to sit out such hour as that with some Mrs. Stistick, who would neither talk, nor read, nor
sleep; in whose company you could neither talk, nor read, nor yet sleep? And if such has been
your lot, have you not asked yourself why in this civilized country, in this civilized century,
you should be doomed to such a senseless, sleepless purgatory?--But when they were gone, and
when the judge, radiant with fun and happiness, hastened to fill his claret beaker, then Bertram
by degrees thawed, and began to feel that after all the world was perhaps not yet dead around him.

"Well, Mr. Stistick," said the baron; "if Sir Henry will allow us, we'll drink Lord Boanerges."

"With all my heart," said Mr. Stistick. "He is a man of whom it may be said--"

"That no man knew better on which side his bread was buttered."

"He is buttering the bread of millions upon millions," said Mr. Stistick.

"Or doing better still," said Bertram; "enabling them to butter their own. Lord Boanerges is
probably the only public man of this day who will be greater in a hundred years than he is now."

"Let us at any rate hope," said the baron, "that he will at that time be less truculent."

"I can't agree with you, Bertram," said Sir Henry. "I consider we are fertile in statesmen.
Do you think that Peel will be forgotten in a hundred years?" This was said with the usual
candour of a modern turncoat. For Sir Henry had now deserted Peel.

"Almost, I should hope, by that time," said Bertram. "He will have a sort of a niche in history,
no doubt; as has Mr. Perceval, who did so much to assist us in the war; and Lord Castlereagh,
who carried the Union. They also were heaven-sent ministers, whom Acheron has not as yet altogether
swallowed up."

"And Boanerges, you think, will escape Libitina?"

"If the spirit of the age will allow immortality to any man of these days, I think he will.
But I doubt whether public opinion, as now existing, will admit of hero-worship."

"Public opinion is the best safeguard for a great man's great name," said Mr. Stistick, with
intense reliance on the civilization of his own era.

"Quite true, sir; quite true," said the baron,--"for the space of twenty-four hours."

Then followed a calm, and then coffee. After that, the solicitor-general, looking at his watch,
marched off impetuous to the House. "Judge," he said, "I know you will excuse me; for you,
too, have been a slave in your time: but you will go up to Lady Harcourt; Bertram, you will
not be forgiven if you do not go upstairs."

Bertram did go upstairs, that he might not appear to be unmanly, as he said to himself, in
slinking out of the house. He did go upstairs, for one quarter of an hour.

But the baron did not. For him, it may be presumed, his club had charms. Mr. Stistick, however,
did do so; he had to hand Mrs. Stistick down from that elysium which she had so exquisitely
graced. He did hand her down; and then for five minutes George Bertram found himself once more
alone with Caroline Waddington.

"Good-night, Lady Harcourt," he said, again essaying to take her hand. This and his other customary
greeting was all that he had yet spoken to her.

"Good-night, Mr. Bertram." At last her voice faltered, at last her eye fell to the ground,
at last her hand trembled. Had she stood firm through this trial all might have been well;
but though she could bear herself right manfully before stranger eyes, she could not alone
support his gaze; one touch of tenderness, one sign of weakness was enough--and that touch
was there, that sign she gave.

"We are cousins still, are we not?" said he.

"Yes, we are cousins--I suppose so."

"And as cousins we need not hate each other?"

"Hate each other!" and she shuddered as she spoke; "oh, no, I hope there is no hatred!"

He stood there silent for a moment, looking, not at her, but at the costly ornaments which
stood at the foot of the huge pier-glass over the fireplace. Why did he not go now? why did
he stand there silent and thoughtful? why--why was he so cruel to her?

"I hope you are happy, Lady Harcourt," at last he said.

There was almost a savage sternness in her face as she made an effort to suppress her feelings.
"Thank you--yes," she said; and then she added, "I never was a believer in much happiness."

And yet he did not go. "We have met now," he said, after another pause.

"Yes, we have met now;" and she even attempted to smile as she answered him.

"And we need not be strangers?" Then there was again a pause; for at first she had no answer
ready. "Is it needful that we should be strangers?" he asked.

"I suppose not; no; not if Sir Henry wishes it otherwise."

And then he put out his hand, and wishing her good-night a second time, he went.

For the next hour, Lady Harcourt sat there looking at the smouldering fire. "Quos Deus vult
perdere, prius dementat." Not in such language, but with some such thought, did she pass judgment
on the wretched folly of her husband.

CHAPTER IV.

MRS. MADDEN'S BALL.

Two days after the dinner, George Bertram called in Eaton Square and saw Lady Harcourt; but,
as it happened, she was not alone. Their interview on this occasion was not in any great degree
embarrassing to either of them. He did not stay long; and as strangers were present, he was
able to talk freely on indifferent subjects. Lady Harcourt probably did not talk much, but
she looked as though she did.

And then Adela Gauntlet came up to town for a month; and George, though he was on three or
four occasions in Eaton Square, never saw Caroline alone; but he became used to seeing her
and being with her. The strangeness of their meeting wore itself away: he could speak to her
without reserve on the common matters of life, and found that he had intense delight in doing so.

Adela Gauntlet was present at all these interviews, and in her heart of hearts condemned them
bitterly; but she could say nothing to Caroline. They had been friends--real friends; but Caroline
was now almost like stone to her. This visit of Adela's had been a long promise--yes, very
long; for the visit, when first promised, was to have been made to Mrs. Bertram. One knows
how these promises still live on. Caroline had pressed it even when she felt that Adela's presence
could no longer be of comfort to her; and Adela would not now refuse, lest in doing so she
might seem to condemn. But she felt that Caroline Harcourt could never be to her what Caroline
Bertram would have been.

Lady Harcourt did whatever in her lay to amuse her guest; but Adela was one who did not require
much amusing. Had there been friendship between her and her friend, the month would have run
by all too quickly; but, as it was, before it was over she wished herself again even at Littlebath.

Bertram dined there twice, and once went with them to some concert. He met them in the Park,
and called; and then there was a great evening gathering in Eaton Square, and he was there.
Caroline was careful on all occasions to let her husband know when she met Bertram, and he
as often, in some shape, expressed his satisfaction.

"He'll marry Adela Gauntlet; you'll see if he does not," he said to her, after one of their
dinners in Eaton Square. "She is very pretty, very; and it will be all very nice; only I wish
that one of them had a little money to go on with."

Caroline answered nothing to this: she never did make him any answers; but she felt quite sure
in her own heart that he would not marry Adela Gauntlet. And had she confessed the truth to
herself, would she have wished him to do so?

Adela saw and disapproved; she saw much and could not but disapprove of all. She saw that there
was very little sympathy between the husband and wife, and that that little was not on the
increase.--Very little! nay, but was there any? Caroline did not say much of her lot in life;
but the few words that did fall from her seemed to be full of scorn for all that she had around
her, and for him who had given it all. She seemed to say, "There--this is that for which I
have striven--these ashes on which I now step, and sleep, and feed, which are gritty between
my teeth, and foul to my touch! See, here is my reward! Do you not honour me for having won it?"

And then it appeared that Sir Henry Harcourt had already learned how to assume the cross brow
of a captious husband; that the sharp word was already spoken on light occasions--spoken without
cause and listened to with apparent indifference. Even before Adela such words were spoken,
and then Caroline would smile bitterly, and turn her face towards her friend, as though she
would say, "See, see what it is to be the wife of so fine a man, so great a man! What a grand
match have I not made for myself!" But though her looks spoke thus, no word of complaint fell
from her lips--and no word of confidence.

We have said that Sir Henry seemed to encourage these visits which Bertram made to Eaton Square;
and for a time he did so--up to the time of that large evening-party which was given just before
Adela's return to Littlebath. But on that evening, Adela thought she saw a deeper frown than
usual on the brows of the solicitor-general, as he turned his eyes to a couch on which his
lovely wife was sitting, and behind which George Bertram was standing, but so standing that
he could speak and she could hear.

And then Adela bethought herself, that though she could say nothing to Caroline, it might not
be equally impossible to say something to Bertram. There had been between them a sort of confidence,
and if there was any one to whom Adela could now speak freely, it was to him. They each knew
something of each other's secrets, and each of them, at least, trusted the other.

But this, if it be done at all, must be done on that evening. There was no probability that
they would meet again before her departure. This was the only house in which they did meet,
and here Adela had no wish to see him more.

"I am come to say good-bye to you," she said, the first moment she was able to speak to him alone.

"To say good-bye! Is your visit over so soon?"

"I go on Thursday."

"Well, I shall see you again, for I shall come on purpose to make my adieux."

"No, Mr. Bertram; do not do that."

"But I certainly shall."

"No;" and she put out her little hand, and gently--oh! so gently--touched his arm.

"And why not? Why should I not come to see you? I have not so many friends that I can afford
to lose you."

"You shall not lose me, nor would I willingly lose you. But, Mr. Bertram--"

"Well, Miss Gauntlet?"

"Are you right to be here at all?"

The whole tone, and temper, and character of his face altered as he answered her quickly and
sharply--"If not, the fault lies with Sir Henry Harcourt, who, with some pertinacity, induced
me to come here. But why is it wrong that I should be here?--foolish it may be."

"That is what I mean. I did not say wrong; did I? Do not think that I imagine evil."

"It may be foolish," continued Bertram, as though he had not heard her last words. "But if
so, the folly has been his."

"If he is foolish, is that reason why you should not be wise?"

"And what is it you fear, Adela? What is the injury that will come? Will it be to me, or to
her, or to Harcourt?"

"No injury, no real injury--I am sure of that. But may not unhappiness come of it? Does it
seem to you that she is happy?"

"Happy! Which of us is happy? Which of us is not utterly wretched? She is as happy as you are?
and Sir Henry, I have no doubt, is as happy as I am."

"In what you say, Mr. Bertram, you do me injustice; I am not unhappy."

"Are you not? then I congratulate you on getting over the troubles consequent on a true heart."

"I did not mean in any way to speak of myself; I have cares, regrets, and sorrows, as have
most of us; but I have no cause of misery which I cannot assuage."

"Well, you are fortunate; that is all I can say."

"But Caroline I can see is not happy; and, Mr. Bertram, I fear that your coming here will not
make her more so."

She had said her little word, meaning it so well. But perhaps she had done more harm than good.
He did not come again to Eaton Square till after she was gone; but very shortly after that
he did so.

Adela had seen that short, whispered conversation between Lady Harcourt and Bertram--that moment,
as it were, of confidence; and so, also, had Sir Henry; and yet it had been but for a moment.

"Lady Harcourt," Bertram had said, "how well you do this sort of thing!"

"Do I?" she answered. "Well, one ought to do something well."

"Do you mean to say that your excellence is restricted to this?"

"Pretty nearly; such excellence as there is."

"I should have thought--" and then he paused.

"You are not coming to reproach me, I hope," she said.

"Reproach you, Lady Harcourt! No; my reproaches, silent or expressed, never fall on your head."

"Then you must be much altered;" and as she said these last words, in what was hardly more
than a whisper, she saw some lady in a distant part of the room to whom some attention might
be considered to be due, and rising from her seat she walked away across the room. It was very
shortly after that Adela had spoken to him.

For many a long and bitter day, Bertram had persuaded himself that she had not really loved
him. He had doubted it when she had first told him so calmly that it was necessary that their
marriage should be postponed for years; he had doubted it much when he found her, if not happy,
at least contented under that postponement; doubt had become almost certainty when he learnt
that she discussed his merits with such a one as Henry Harcourt; but on that day, at Richmond,
when he discovered that the very secrets of his heart were made subject of confidential conversation
with this man, he had doubted it no longer. Then he had gone to her, and his reception proved
to him that his doubts had been too well founded--his certainty only too sure. And so he had
parted with her--as we all know.

But now he began to doubt his doubts--to be less certain of his certainty. That she did not
much love Sir Henry, that was very apparent; that she could not listen to his slightest word
without emotion--that, too, he could perceive; that Adela conceived that she still loved him,
and that his presence there was therefore dangerous--that also had been told to him. Was it
then possible that he, loving this woman as he did--having never ceased in his love for one
moment, having still loved her with his whole heart, his whole strength--that he had flung
her from him while her heart was still his own? Could it be that she, during their courtship,
should have seemed so cold and yet had loved him?

A thousand times he had reproached her in his heart for being worldly; but now the world seemed
to have no charms for her. A thousand times he had declared that she cared only for the outward
show of things, but these outward shows were now wholly indifferent to her. That they in no
degree contributed to her happiness, or even to her contentment, that was made manifest enough
to him.

And then these thoughts drove him wild, and he began to ask himself whether there could be
yet any comfort in the fact that she had loved him, and perhaps loved him still. The motives
by which men are actuated in their conduct are not only various, but mixed. As Bertram thought
in this way concerning Lady Harcourt--the Caroline Waddington that had once belonged to himself--he
proposed to himself no scheme of infamy, no indulgence of a disastrous love, no ruin for her
whom the world now called so fortunate; but he did think that, if she still loved him, it would
be pleasant to sit and talk with her; pleasant to feel some warmth in her hand; pleasant that
there should be some confidence in her voice. And so he resolved--but, no, there was no resolve;
but he allowed it to come to pass that his intimacy in Eaton Square should not be dropped.

And then he bethought himself of the part which his friend Harcourt had played in this matter,
and speculated as to how that pleasant fellow had cheated him out of his wife. What Adela had
said might be very true, but why should he regard Sir Henry's happiness? why regard any man's
happiness, or any woman's? Who had regarded him? So he hired a horse, and rode in the Park
when he knew Lady Harcourt would be there, dined with Baron Brawl because Lady Harcourt was
to dine there, and went to a ball at Mrs. Madden's for the same reason. All which the solicitor-general
now saw, and did not press his friend to take a part at any more of his little dinners.

What may have passed on the subject between Sir Henry and his wife cannot be said. A man does
not willingly accuse his wife of even the first germ of infidelity; does not willingly suggest
to her that any one is of more moment to her than himself. It is probable that his brow became
blacker than it had been, that his words were less courteous, and his manner less kind; but
of Bertram himself, it may be presumed that he said nothing. It might, however, have been easy
for Caroline to perceive that he no longer wished to have his old friend at his house.

At Mrs. Madden's ball, Bertram asked her to dance with him, and she did stand up for a quadrille.
Mr. Madden was a rich young man, in Parliament, and an intimate friend both of Sir Henry's
and of Bertram's. Caroline had danced with him--being her first performance of that nature
since her marriage; and having done so, she could not, as she said to herself, refuse Mr. Bertram.
So they stood up; and the busy solicitor-general, who showed himself for five minutes in the
room, saw them moving, hand-in-hand together, in the figure of the dance. And as he so moved,
Bertram himself could hardly believe in the reality of his position. What if any one had prophesied
to him three months since that he would be dancing with Caroline Harcourt!

"Adela did not stay with you long," said he, as they were standing still.

"No, not very long. I do not think she is fond of London;" and then they were again silent
till their turn for dancing was over.

"No; I don't think she is," said Bertram, "nor am I. I should not care if I were to leave it
for ever. Do you like London, Lady Harcourt?"

"Oh, yes; as well as any other place. I don't think it much signifies--London, or Littlebath,
or New Zealand."

They were then both silent for a moment, till Bertram again spoke, with an effort that was
evident in his voice.

"You used not to be so indifferent in such matters."

"Used!"

"Has all the world so changed that nothing is any longer of any interest?"

"The world has changed, certainly--with me."

"And with me also, Lady Harcourt. The world has changed with both of us. But Fortune, while
she has been crushing me, has been very kind to you."

"Has she? Well, perhaps she has--as kind, at any rate, as I deserve. But you may be sure of
this--I do not complain of her." And then they were again silent.

"I wonder whether you ever think of old days?" he said, after a pause.

"At any rate, I never talk of them, Mr. Bertram."

"No; I suppose not. One should not talk of them. But out of a full heart the mouth will speak.
Constant thoughts will break forth in words. There is nothing else left to me of which I can
think."

Any one looking at her face as she answered him would have little dreamed how much was passing
through her mind, how much was weighing on her heart. She commanded not only her features,
but even her colour, and the motion of her eyes. No anger flashed from them; there was no blush
of indignation as she answered him in that crowded room. And yet her words were indignant enough,
and there was anger, too, in that low tone which reached his ear so plainly, but which reached
no further.

"And whose doing has this been? Why is it that I may not think of past times? Why is it that
all thought, all memories are denied to me? Who was it that broke the cup at the very fountain?"

"Was it I?"

"Did you ever think of your prayers? 'Forgive us our trespasses.' But you, in your pride--you
could forgive nothing. And now you dare to twit me with my fortune!"

"Lady Harcourt!"

"I will sit down, if you please, now. I do not know why I speak thus." And then, without further
words, she caused herself to be led away, and sitting down between two old dowagers, debarred
him absolutely from the power of another word.

Immediately after this he left the house; but she remained for another hour--remained and danced
with young Lord Echo, who was a Whig lordling; and with Mr. Twisleton, whose father was a Treasury
secretary. They both talked to her about Harcourt, and the great speech he was making at that
moment; and she smiled and looked so beautiful, that when they got together at one end of the
supper-table, they declared that Harcourt was out-and-out the luckiest dog of his day; and
questioned his right to monopolize such a treasure.

And had he been cruel? had he been unforgiving? had he denied to her that pardon which it behoved
him so often to ask for himself? This was the question which Bertram was now forced to put
to himself. And that other question, which he could now answer but in one way. Had he then
been the cause of his own shipwreck? Had he driven his own bark on the rocks while the open
channel was there clear before him? Had she not now assured him of her love, though no word
of tenderness had passed her lips? And whose doing had it been? Yes, certainly; it had been
his own doing.

The conviction which thus came upon him did not add much to his comfort. There was but little
consolation to him now in the assurance that she had loved, and did love him. He had hitherto
felt himself to be an injured man; but now he had to feel that he himself had committed the
injury. "Whose doing has it been? You--you in your pride, could forgive nothing!" These words
rang in his ears; his memory repeated to him hourly the tone in which they had been spoken.
She had accused him of destroying all her hopes for this world--and he had answered not a word
to the accusation.

On the morning after that ball at Mrs. Madden's, Sir Henry came into his wife's room while
she was still dressing. "By-the-by," said he, "I saw you at Mrs. Madden's last night."

"Yes; I perceived that you were there for a moment," Caroline answered.

"You were dancing. I don't know that I ever saw you dancing before."

"I have not done so since I was married. In former days I used to be fond of it."

"Ah, yes; when you were at Littlebath. It did not much matter then what you did in that way; but--"

"Does it matter more now, Sir Henry?"

"Well, if it would entail no great regret, I would rather that you did not dance. It is all
very nice for girls."

"You do not mean to say that married women--"

"I do not mean to say anything of the kind. One man has one idea, and another another. Some
women also are not placed in so conspicuous a position as you are."

"Why did you not tell me your wishes before?"

"It did not occur to me. I did not think it probable that you would dance. May I understand
that you will give it up?"

"As you direct me to do so, of course I shall."

"Direct! I do not direct, I only request."

"It is the same thing, exactly. I will not dance again. I should have felt the prohibition
less had I been aware of your wishes before I had offended."

"Well, if you choose to take it in that light, I cannot help it. Good-morning. I shall not
dine at home to-day."

And so the solicitor-general went his way, and his wife remained sitting motionless at her
dressing-table. They had both of them already become aware that the bargain they had made was
not a wise one.

CHAPTER V.

CAN I ESCAPE?

Had not George Bertram been of all men the most infirm of purpose, he would have quitted London
immediately after that ball--at any rate, for many months. But he was lamentably infirm of
purpose. He said to himself over and over again, that it behoved him to go. What had either
of them done for him that he should regard them? That had hitherto been the question within
his own breast; but now it was changed. Had he not greatly injured her? Had she not herself
told him that his want of mercy had caused all her misery? Ought he not, at any rate, to spare
her now? But yet he remained. He must ask her pardon before he went; he would do that, and
then he would go.

His object was to see her without going to Eaton Square. His instinct told him that Sir Henry
no longer wished to see him there, and he was unwilling to enter the house of any one who did
not wish his presence. For two weeks he failed in his object. He certainly did see Lady Harcourt,
but not in such a way as to allow of conversation; but at last fortune was propitious,--or
the reverse, and he found himself alone with her.

She was seated quite alone, turning over the engravings which lay in a portfolio before her,
when he came up to her.

"Do not be angry," he said, "if I ask you to listen to me for a few moments."

She still continued to move the engravings before her, but with a slower motion than before;
and though her eye still rested on the plates, he might have seen, had he dared to look at
her, that her mind was far away from them. He might have seen also that there was no flash
of anger now in her countenance: her spirit was softer than on that evening when she had reproached
him; for she had remembered that he also had been deeply injured. But she answered nothing
to the request which he thus made.

"You told me that I was unforgiving," he continued, "I now come to beg that you will not be
unforgiving also; that is, if I have done anything that has caused you--caused you to be less
happy than you might have been."

"Less happy!" she said; but not with that scorn with which she had before repeated his words.

"You believe, I hope, that I would wish you to be happy; that I would do anything in my power
to make you so?"

"There can be nothing now in your power, Mr. Bertram." And as she spoke she involuntarily put
an emphasis on the now, which made her words convey much more than she had intended.

"No," he said. "No. What can such a one as I do? What could I ever have done? But say that
you forgive me, Lady Harcourt."

"Let us both forgive," she whispered, and as she did so, she put out her hand to him. "Let
us both forgive. It is all that we can do for each other."

"Oh, Caroline, Caroline!" he said, speaking hardly above his breath, and with his eyes averted,
but still holding her hand; or attempting to hold it, for as he spoke she withdrew it.

"I was unjust to you the other night. It is so hard to be just when one is so wretched. We
have been like two children who have quarrelled over their plaything, and broken it in pieces
while it was yet new. We cannot put the wheels again together, or made the broken reed produce
sweet sounds."

"No," he said. "No, no, no. No sounds are any longer sweet. There is no music now."

"But as we have both sinned, Mr. Bertram, so should we both forgive."

"But I--I have nothing to forgive."

"Alas, yes! and mine was the first fault. I knew that you really loved me, and--"

"Loved you! Oh, Caroline!"

"Hush, Mr. Bertram; not so; do not speak so. I know that you would not wrong me; I know you
would not lead me into trouble--not into further trouble; into worse misery."

"And I, that might have led you--no; that might have been led to such happiness! Lady Harcourt,
when I think of what I have thrown away--"

"Think of it not at all, Mr. Bertram."

"And you; can you command your thoughts?"

"Sometimes; and by practice I hope always; at any rate, I make an effort. And now, good-bye.
It will be sweet to me to hear that you have forgiven me. You were very angry, you know, when
you parted from me last at Littlebath."

"If there be anything for me to forgive, I do forgive it with all my heart; with all my heart."

"And now, God bless you, Mr. Bertram. The thing that would most tend to make me contented would
be to see you married to some one you could love; a weight would then be off my soul which
now weighs on it very heavily." And so saying, she rose from her seat and left him standing
over the engravings. He had thrown his pearl away; a pearl richer than all his tribe. There
was nothing for him now but to bear the loss.

There were other sources of unpleasantness between Sir Henry and his wife besides her inclination
for dancing. Sir Henry had now paid one half-year's interest on the sum of money which had
been lent to him by the old gentleman at Hadley, and had been rather disgusted at finding that
it was taken as a matter of course. He was not at the present moment by any means over-burdened
with money. His constant devotion to politics interfered considerably with his practice. He
was also perhaps better known as a party lawyer than as a practical or practising one; and
thus, though his present career was very brilliant, it was not quite so profitable as he had
hoped. Most lawyers when they begin to devote themselves to politics have secured, if not fortune,
at least the means of making it. And, even at his age, Sir Henry might have been said to have
done this had his aspirations been in any way moderate. But they were not moderate. He wished
to shine with extreme brilliancy; to live up to the character for wealth which the world gave
him; and to give it out as a fact to be understood by all men that he was to be the heir of
the Hadley Croesus.

There was, perhaps, a certain wisdom in this, a wisdom of a dashing chancy nature. Fortune
favours the brave; and the world certainly gives the most credit to those who are able to give
an unlimited credit to themselves. But there was certainly risk in the life he led. The giving
of elegant little dinners two or three times a week in London is an expensive amusement--and
so he began to be very anxious about the old gentleman.

But what was he to do that he might get near those money-bags? There was the game. What best
sportsman's dodge might he use so as to get it into his bag? Perhaps to do nothing, to use
no sportsman's dodge would have been the best. But then it is so hard to do nothing when so
much might be gained by doing something very well.

Sir Henry, duly instructed as to the weaknesses customary to old men, thought his wife would
be his best weapon--his surest dodge. If she could be got to be attentive and affectionate
to her grandfather, to visit him, and flatter him, and hover about him, much might be done.
So thought Sir Henry. But do what he might, Lady Harcourt would not assist him. It was not
part of her bargain that she should toady an old man who had never shown any special regard
for her.

"I think you ought to go down to Hadley," Sir Henry said to her one morning.

"What, to stay there?" said Caroline.

"Yes; for a fortnight or so. Parliament will be up now in three weeks, and I shall go to Scotland
for a few days. Could not you make it out with the old gentleman till you go to the Grimsdale's?"

"I would much rather remain at home, Sir Henry."

"Ah, yes; that is just like you. And I would much rather that you went."

"If you wish to shut the house up, I shall not object to go to Littlebath."

"Very probably not. But I should object to you going there--exceedingly object to it. Of all
places, it is the most vulgar! the most--"

"You forget that I have dear friends living there."

"Dear friends! Yes; Miss Todd, I suppose. I think we may as well leave Miss Todd alone. At
the present moment, I am particularly anxious that you should be attentive to your grandfather."

"But I have never been in the habit of staying at Hadley."

"Then the sooner you get into the habit the better."

"I cannot think why you should wish me to trouble an old man who would not have the slightest
pleasure in seeing me."

"That is all nonsense. If you behaved well to him, he would have pleasure. Do you ever write
to him?"

"Never."

"Write to him to-day then, and ask whether he would be glad to have you."

Caroline did not answer her husband immediately, but went on buttering her toast, and sipping
her tea. She had never yet disobeyed any positive order that he had given, and she was now
thinking whether she could obey this order; or, if not, how she would explain to him that she
could not do so.

"Well!" said he; "why do you not answer me? Will you write to him to-day?"

"I had much rather not."

"Does that mean that you won't?"

"I fear, Sir Henry, that it must mean it. I have not been on terms with my grandfather which
would admit of my doing so."

"Nonsense!" said her lord and master.

"You are not very civil to me this morning."

"How can a man be civil when he hears such trash as that? You know how I am situated--how great
the stake is; and you will do nothing to help me win it." To this she made no answer. Of what
use would it be for her to answer? She also had thrown away her pearl, and taken in exchange
this piece of brass. There was nothing for her, too, but to bear her misery.

"Upon my word, you take it all very coolly," he continued; "you seem to think that houses,
and furniture, and carriages, and horses are to grow up all round you without any effort on
your own part. Does it ever strike you that these things cost money?"

"I will give them all up to-morrow if you wish it."

"That you know is nonsense."

"It was your doing to surround me with these things, and your reproach is not just. Nay, it
is not manly."

"A woman's idea of manliness is very extended. You expect to get everything, and to do nothing.
You talk of justice! Do you not know that when I married you, I looked to your uncle's fortune?"

"Certainly not: had I known it, I should have told you how vain I believed any such hope to be."

"Then, why on earth--?" But he refrained from finishing his question. Even he could not bring
himself to tell her that he had married her with no other view. He merely slammed the door
behind him as he left the room. Yes; she had certainly thrown her pearl away. What a life was
this to which she had doomed herself! what treatment was this for that Caroline Waddington,
who had determined to win the world and wear it! She had given herself to a brute, who had
taken her only because she might perhaps be the heiress of a rich old man.

And then she thought of that lost pearl. How could she do other than think of it? She thought
of what her life would have been had she bravely committed herself to his hands, fearing nothing,
trusting everything. She remembered his energy during those happy days in which he had looked
forward to an early marriage. She remembered his tenderness of manner, the natural gallantry
of his heart, the loving look of his bold eye; and then she thought of her husband.

Yes, she thought of him long and wildly. And as she did so, the indifference with which she
had regarded him grew into hatred. She shuddered as her imagination made that frightful contrast
between the picture which her eyes would have so loved to look on if it were only lawful, and
that other picture to look on which was her legal doom. Her brow grew wildly black as she thought
of his caresses, his love, which were more hateful to her even than his coarse ill-humour.
She thought of all this; and, as she did so, she asked herself that question which comes first
to the mind of all creatures when in misery: Is there no means of release; no way of escape?
was her bark utterly ruined, and for ever?

That marriage without love is a perilous step for any woman who has a heart within her bosom.
For those who have none--or only so much as may be necessary for the ordinary blood-circulating
department--such an arrangement may be convenient enough. Caroline Waddington had once flattered
herself that that heart of hers was merely a blood-circulating instrument. But she had discovered
her mistake, and learned the truth before it was too late. She had known what it was to love--and
yet she had married Henry Harcourt! Seldom, indeed, will punishment be so lame of foot as to
fail in catching such a criminal as she had been.

Punishment--bitter, cruel, remorseless punishment--had caught her now, and held her tight within
its grasp. He, too, had said that he was wretched. But what could his wretchedness be to hers?
He was not married to a creature that he hated: he was not bound in a foul Mezentian embrace
to a being against whom all his human gorge rose in violent disgust. Oh! if she could only
be alone, as he was alone! If it could be granted to her to think of her love, to think of
him in solitude and silence--in a solitude which no beast with a front of brass and feet of
clay had a right to break, both by night and day! Ah! if her wretchedness might only be as
his wretchedness! How blessed would she not think herself!

And then she again asked herself whether there might not be some escape. That women had separated
themselves from their husbands, she well knew. That pleas of ill-usage, of neglect, of harshness
of temper, had been put forward and accepted by the world, to the partial enfranchisement of
the unhappy wife, she had often heard. But she had also heard that in such cases cruelty must
be proved. A hasty word, a cross look, a black brow would not suffice. Nor could she plead
that she hated the man, that she had never loved him, that she had married him in wounded pique,
because her lover--he whom she did love--had thrown her off. There was no ground, none as yet,
on which she could claim her freedom. She had sold herself as a slave, and she must abide her
slavery. She had given herself to this beast with the face of brass and the feet of clay, and
she must endure the cold misery of his den. Separation--solitude--silence! He--that he whom
her heart worshipped--he might enjoy such things; but for her--there was no such relief within
her reach.

She had gone up into her room when Sir Henry left her, in order that no one might see her wretchedness,
and there she remained for hours. "No!" at last she said aloud, lifting her head from the pillow
on which her face had been all but hid, and standing erect in the room; "no! I will not bear
it. I will not endure it. He cannot make me." And with quick steps she walked across and along
the room, stretching forth her arms as though seeking aid from some one; ay, and as though
she were prepared to fight the battle herself if no one would come to aid her.

At this moment there was a knock at her chamber-door, and her maid came in.

"Mr. Bertram is in the drawing-room, my lady."

"Mr. Bertram! Which Mr. Bertram?"

"Mr. Bertram, my lady; the gentleman that comes here. Sir Henry's friend."

"Oh, very well. Why did John say that I was at home?"

"Oh, my lady, I can't say that. Only he told me to tell your ladyship that Mr. Bertram was
in the drawing-room."

Lady Harcourt paused for a moment. Then she said, "I will be down directly;" and the Abigail
retired. During that moment she had decided that, as he was there, she would meet him yet once
again.

It has been said that Bertram was unwilling to go to Sir Henry's house. As long as he had thought
of remaining in town he was so. But now he had resolved to fly, and had resolved also that
before he did so he would call in the ordinary way and say one last farewell. John, the servant,
admitted him at once; though he had on that same morning sent bootless away a score of other
suppliants for the honour of being admitted to Lady Harcourt's presence.

Bertram was standing with his back to the door, looking into a small conservatory that opened
from the drawing-room, when the mistress of the house entered. She walked straight up to him,
after having carefully closed the door, and just touching his hand, she said, "Mr. Bertram,
why are you here? You should be thousands and thousands of miles away if that were possible.
Why are you here?"

"Lady Harcourt, I will divide myself from you by any distance you may demand. But may I not
come to you to tell you that I am going?"

"To tell me that you are going!"

"Yes. I shall not trouble you much longer. I have become sure of this: that to remain near
you and not to love you, to remain near you and not to say that I love you is impossible. And
therefore I am going." And he held out his hand, which she had as yet hardly taken--had barely
touched.

He was going; but she was to remain. He would escape; but her prison bars could not be broken.
Ah, that she could have gone with him! How little now would wealth have weighed with her; or
high worldly hopes, or dreams of ambition! To have gone with him anywhere--honestly to have
gone with him--trusting to honest love and a true heart. Ah! how much joy is there in this
mortal, moribund world if one will but open one's arms to take it!

Ah! young ladies, sweet young ladies, dear embryo mothers of our England as it will be, think
not overmuch of your lovers' incomes. He that is true and honest will not have to beg his bread--neither
his nor yours. The true and honest do not beg their bread, though it may be that for awhile
they eat it without much butter. But what then? If a wholesome loaf on your tables, and a strong
arm round your waists, and a warm heart to lean on cannot make you happy, you are not the girls
for whom I take you.

Caroline's bread was buttered, certainly; but the butter had been mixed with gall, and she
could not bring herself to swallow it. And now he had come to tell her that he was going; he
whose loaf, and arm, and heart she might have shared. What would the world say of her if she
were to share his flight?

"Good-bye," she said, as she took his proffered hand.

"And is that all?"

"What would you have, Mr. Bertram?"

"What would I have? Ah, me! I would have that which is utterly--utterly--utterly beyond my reach."

"Yes, utterly--utterly," she repeated. And as she said so, she thought again, what would the
world say of her if she were to share his flight?

"I suppose that now, for the last time, I may speak truly--as a man should speak. Lady Harcourt,
I have never ceased to love you, never for one moment; never since that day when we walked
together among those strange tombs. My love for you has been the dream of my life."

"But, why--why--why?--" She could not speak further, for her voice was choked with tears.

"I know what you would say. Why was I so stern to you!"

"Why did you go away? Why did you not come to us?"

"Because you distrusted me; not as your lover, but as a man. But I did not come here to blame
you, Caroline."

"Nor to be blamed."

"No, nor to be blamed. What good can come of reproaches? We now know each other's faults, if
we never did before. And we know also each other's truth--" He paused a moment, and then added,
"For, Caroline, your heart has been true."

She sat herself down upon a chair, and wept, with her face hidden within her hands. Yes, her
heart had been true enough; if only her words, her deeds, her mind could have been true also.

He came up to her, and lightly put his hand upon her shoulder. His touch was very light, but
yet she felt that there was love in it--illicit, dishonest love. There was treason in it to
her lord's rights. Her lord! Yes, he was her lord, and it was treason. But it was very sweet
that touch; it was as though a thrill of love passed across her and embraced her whole body.
Treason to such a creature as that! a brute with a face of brass and feet of clay, who had
got hold of her with a false idea that by her aid he could turn his base brass into gold as
base! Could there be treason to such a one as he? Ah! what would the world say of her were
she to share that flight?

"Caroline," he murmured in her ear. "Caroline; dearest Caroline!" Thus he murmured soft words
into her ear, while his hand still rested gently on her shoulder--oh, so gently! And still
she answered nothing, but the gurgling of her sobs was audible to him enough. "Caroline," he
repeated; "dearest, dearest Caroline." And then he was on his knees beside her; and the hand
which had touched her shoulder was now pressed upon her arm.

"Caroline, speak to me--say one word. I will go if you bid me. Yes, even alone. I will go alone
if you have the heart to say so. Speak, Caroline."

"What would you have me say?" and she looked at him through her tears, so haggard, so wild,
so changed, that he was almost frightened at her countenance. "What would you have me say?
what would you have me do?"

"I will be your slave if you will let me," said he.

"No, George--you mean that I might be your slave--for awhile, till you thought me too base
even for that."

"Ah! you little know me."

"I should but little know you if I thought you could esteem me in that guise. There; God's
mercy has not deserted me. It is over now. Go, George--go--go; thou, only love of my heart;
my darling; mine that might have been; mine that never can be now--never--never--never. Go,
George. It is over now. I have been base, and vile, and cowardly--unworthy of your dear memory.
But it shall not be so again. You shall not blush that you have loved me."

"But, ah! that I have lost your love."

"You shall not blush that you have loved me, nor will I blush that I, too, have loved you.
Go, George; and remember this, the farther, the longer, the more entirely we are apart, the
better, the safer it will be. There; there. Go now. I can bear it now; dearest, dearest George."

He took her outstretched hands in his, and stood for awhile gazing into her face. Then, with
the strong motion of his arms, he drew her close to his breast, pressed her to his heart, and
imprinted one warm kiss upon her brow. Then he left her, and got to the drawing-room door with
his fleetest step.

"I beg your pardon, sir," said John, who met him exactly on the landing; "but I think my lady
rang."

"Lady Bertram did not ring. She is not well, and you had better not disturb her," said Bertram,
trying to look as though he were no whit disconcerted.

"Oh, very well, sir; then I'll go down again;" and so saying John followed George Bertram into
the hall, and opened the door for him very politely.

CHAPTER VI.

A MATRIMONIAL DIALOGUE.

Sir Henry had said also on this day that he would not dine at home; but he came home before
dinner; and after being for a few minutes in his own study, he sent for his wife. Abigail,
coming up to her, brought her Sir Henry's love, and would she be good enough to step downstairs
for five minutes? This was very civil; so she did step down, and found Sir Henry alone in his
study.

"George Bertram has been here to-day?" were the first words which the husband spoke when he
saw that the door had been fairly closed behind his wife.

What communication there may have been between Sir Henry and his servant John is, oh my reader,
a matter too low for you and me. That there had been some communication we must both fear.
Not that Sir Henry wished to find his wife guilty; not that he at all suspected that he should
find her guilty. But he did wish to have her entirely in his power; and he wished also that
Bertram should be altogether banished from his house.

"George Bertram has been here to-day?" He did not look cruel, or violent, or threatening as
he spoke; but yet there was that in his eye which was intended to make Caroline tremble. Caroline,
however, did not tremble; but looking up into his face with calm dignity replied, that Mr.
Bertram had called that morning.

"And would you object to telling me what passed between you?"

Caroline still looked him full in the face. He was sitting, but she had not sat down. She was
standing before him, faultless in demeanour, in posture, and in dress. If it had been his aim
to confound her, he certainly had so far missed his object.

"Would I object to telling you what passed between us? The question is a very singular one;"
and then she paused a moment. "Yes, Sir Henry, I should object."

"I thought as much," said he.

She still stood before him, perfectly silent; and he sat there, silent also. He hardly knew
how to go on with the interview. He wanted her to defend herself, but this was the very thing
which she did not intend to do. "May I go now?" she asked, after awhile.

"No; not quite yet. Sit down, Caroline; sit down. I wish to speak to you. George Bertram has
been here, and there has been that between you of which you are ashamed to speak!"

"I never said so, Sir Henry--nor will I allow you to say so. There has been that between us
to-day which I would rather bury in silence. But if you command me, I will tell you all."

"Command! you are always talking of commands."

"I have to do so very often. In such marriages as ours they must be spoken of--must be thought
of. If you command me, I will tell you. If you do not, I will be silent."

Sir Henry hardly knew what answer to make to this. His object was to frighten his wife. That
there had been words between her and George Bertram of which she, as his wife, would be afraid
to tell, he had been thoroughly convinced. Yet she now offered to repeat to him everything
if he would only desire her to do so; and in making this offer, she seemed to be anything but
afraid.

"Sit down, Caroline." She then sat down just opposite to him. "I should have thought that you
would have felt that, circumstanced as he, and you, and I are, the intercourse between you
and him should have been of the most restrained kind--should have had in it nothing of the
old familiarity."

"Who brought us again together?"

"I did so; trusting to your judgment and good taste."

"I did not wish to see him. I did not ask him here. I would have remained at home month after
month rather than have met him had I been allowed my own way."

"Nonsense! Why should you have been so afraid to meet him?"

"Because I love him."

As she said this she still looked into his face fearlessly--we may almost say boldly; so much
so that Sir Henry's eyes almost quailed before hers. On this she had at any rate resolved,
that she would never quail before him.

But by degrees there came across his brow a cloud that might have made her quail had she not
been bold. He had come there determined not to quarrel with her. An absolute quarrel with her
would not suit him--would not further his plans, as they were connected with Mr. Bertram at
Hadley. But it might be that he could not fail to quarrel with her. He was not a man without
blood in his veins--without feelings at his heart. He could have loved her in his way, could
she have been content to love him. Nay, he had loved her; and while she was the acknowledged
possession of another, he had thought that to obtain her he would have been willing to give
up many worldly goods. Now he had obtained her; and there she sat, avowing to him that she
still loved his unsuccessful rival. It was no wonder that his brow grew black, despite his
own policy.

"And he has been here to-day in order that you might tell him so?"

"He has been here to-day, and I did tell him so," said Caroline, looking still full up into
her husband's eyes. "What brought him here I cannot say."

"And you tell me this to my face?"

"Well; would you have me tell you a lie? Did I not tell you the same when you first asked me
to marry you? Did I not repeat it to you again but a week before we were married? Do you think
that a few months could make the difference? Do you think that such months as these have been
could have effaced his memory?"

"And you mean, then, to entertain him as your lover?"

"I mean to entertain him not at all. I mean that he shall never again enter any house in which
I may be doomed to live. You brought him here; and I--though I knew that the trial would be
hard--I thought that I could bear it. I find that I cannot. My memory is too clear; my thoughts
of other days too vivid; my remorse--"

"Go on, madam; pray go on."

"No, I shall not go on. I have said enough."

"Ah! you said more than that to him when he was here."

"Not half so much."

"Was he not kneeling at your feet?"

"Yes, sir, he did kneel at my feet;" and as she answered the question she rose up, as though
it were impossible for her any longer to sit in the presence of a man who so evidently had
set a spy upon her actions.

"Well, and what then? Since you are so little ashamed of the truth, tell it all."

"I am not at all ashamed of the truth. He came to tell me that he was going--and I bade him go."

"And you allowed him to embrace you--to hold you in his arms--to kiss you?"

"Ah me! yes--for the last time. He did kiss me. I feel his lips now upon my brow. And then
I told him that I loved him; loved none but him; could love none other. Then I bade him begone;
and he went. Now, sir, I think you know it all. You seem to have had two accounts of the interview;
I hope they do not disagree?"

"Such audacious effrontery I never witnessed in my life--never heard of before!"

"What, sir, did you think that I should lie to you?"

"I thought there was some sense of shame left in you."

"Too high a sense of shame for that. I wish you could know it all. I wish I could tell you
the tone of his voice, and the look of his eye. I wish I could tell you how my heart drooped,
and all but fainted, as I felt that he must leave me for ever. I am a married woman, and it
was needful that he should go." After this there was a slight pause, and then she added: "Now,
Sir Henry, I think you know it all. Now may I go?"

He rose from his chair and began walking the length of the room, backwards and forwards, with
quick step. As we have before said, he had a heart in his bosom; he had blood in his veins;
he had those feelings of a man which make the scorn of a beautiful woman so intolerable. And
then she was his wife, his property, his dependent, his own. For a moment he forgot the Hadley
money-bags, sorely as he wanted them, and the true man spoke out with full, unabated anger.

"Brazen-faced harlot!" he exclaimed, as he passed her in his walk; "unmitigated harlot!"

"Yes, sir," she answered, in a low tone, coming up to him as she spoke, laying her hand upon
his arm, and looking still full into his face--looking into it with such a gaze that even he
cowered before her. "Yes, sir, I was the thing you say. When I came to you, and sold my woman's
purity for a name, a house, a place before the world--when I gave you my hand, but could not
give my heart, I was--what you have said."

"And were doubly so when he stood here slobbering on your neck."

"No, Sir Henry, no. False to him I have been; false to my own sex; false, very false to my
own inner self; but never false to you."

"Madam, you have forgotten my honour."

"I have at any rate been able to remember my own."

They were now standing face to face; and as she said these last words, it struck Sir Henry
that it might be well to take them as a sign of grace, and to commence from them that half-forgiveness
which would be necessary to his projects.

"You have forgotten yourself, Caroline--"

"Stop a moment, Sir Henry, and let me finish, since you will not allow me to remain silent.
I have never been false to you, I say; and, by God's help, I never will be--"

"Well, well."

"Stop, sir, and let me speak. I have told you often that I did not love you. I tell you so
now again. I have never loved you--never shall love you. You have called me now by a base name;
and in that I have lived with you and have not loved you, I dare not say that you have called
me falsely. But I will sin no more."

"What is it you mean?"

"I will not deserve the name again--even from you."

"Nonsense; I do not understand you. You do not know what you are saying."

"Yes, Sir Henry, I do know well what I am saying. It may be that I have done you some injury;
if so, I regret it. God knows that you have done me much. We can neither of us now add to each
other's comfort, and it will be well that we should part."

"Do you mean me to understand that you intend to leave me?"

"That is what I intend you to understand."

"Nonsense; you will do no such thing."

"What! would you have us remain together, hating each other, vilifying each other, calling
each other base names as you just now called me? And do you think that we could still be man
and wife? No, Sir Henry. I have made one great mistake--committed one wretched, fatal error.
I have so placed myself that I must hear myself so called and bear it quietly; but I will not
continue to be so used. Do you think he would have called me so?"

"Damn him!"

"That will not hurt him. Your words are impotent against him, though they may make me shudder."

"Do not speak of him, then."

"No, I will not. I will only think of him."

"By heavens! Caroline, your only wish is to make me angry."

"I may go now, I suppose?"

"Go--yes; you may go; I will speak to you to-morrow, when you will be more cool."

"To-morrow, Sir Henry, I will not speak to you; nor the day afterwards, nor the day after that.
What you may wish to say now I will hear; but remember this--after what has passed to-day,
no consideration on earth shall induce me to live with you again. In any other respect I will
obey your orders--if I find it possible."

She stayed yet a little while longer, leaning against the table, waiting to hear whether or
no he would answer her; but as he sat silent, looking before him, but not at her, with his
hands thrust deep into his pockets, she without further words withdrew, and quietly closed
the door after her. As she did so, the faithful John was seen moving away to the top of the
kitchen stairs. She would hardly have cared had the faithful John been present during the whole
interview.

Sir Henry sat silent for a quarter of an hour, meditating how he would now play his game. As
regarded merely personal considerations, he was beginning to hate Caroline almost as much as
she hated him. A man does not like to be told by a beautiful woman that every hair of his head
is odious to her, while the very footsteps of another are music in her ears. Perhaps it does
not mend the matter when the hated man is the husband.

But still Sir Henry wished to keep his wife. It has been quite clear that Caroline had thrown
up her game. She had flattered herself that she could play it; but the very moment the cards
went against her, she discovered her own weakness and threw them away. Sir Henry was of a stronger
mind, and not so easily disgusted: he would try yet another deal. Indeed, his stakes were too
high to allow of his abandoning them.

So arousing himself with some exertion, he dressed himself, went out to dine, hurried down
to the House, and before the evening was over was again the happy, fortunate solicitor-general,
fortune's pet, the Crichton of the hour, the rising man of his day.

CHAPTER VII.

THE RETURN TO HADLEY.

We must now return for awhile to Hadley. Since the day on which Miss Baker had written that
letter to Sir Lionel, she had expressed no wish to leave her uncle's house. Littlebath had
no charms for her now. The colonel was still there, and so was the colonel's first love--Miss
Todd: let them forgive and forget, and marry each other at last if they so pleased. Miss Baker's
fit of ambition was over, and she was content to keep her uncle's house at Hadley, and to see
Caroline whenever she could spare a day and get up to London for that purpose.

And the old gentleman was less bearish than she thought he would have been. He occasionally
became rusty about shillings and sixpences, and scolded because his niece would have a second
fire lighted; but by degrees he forgot even this grievance, and did not make himself more disagreeable
or exacting than old age, wealth, and suffering generally are when they come together.

And then when Adela left London, Miss Baker was allowed to ask her to stop with them at Hadley--and
Adela did as she was asked. She went direct from Eaton Square to Mr. Bertram's house; and was
still there at the time alluded to in the last chapter.

It was on the second morning after Sir Henry's visit to his wife that the postman brought to
Miss Baker a letter from Lady Harcourt. The two ladies were sitting at the time over the breakfast-table,
and old Mr. Bertram, propped up with pillows, with his crutches close to his hand, was sitting
over the fire in his accustomed arm-chair. He did not often get out of it now, except when
he was taken away to bed; but yet both his eye and his voice were as sharp as ever when he
so pleased; and though he sat there paralyzed and all but motionless, he was still master of
his house, and master also of his money.

"Good heavens!" exclaimed Miss Baker, with startled voice before her letter had been half read
through.

"What's the matter?" demanded Mr. Bertram sharply.

"Oh, Miss Baker! what is it?" asked Adela.

"Goodness gracious! Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear!" And Miss Baker, with her handkerchief to
her eyes, began to weep most bitterly.

"What ails you? Who is the letter from?" said Mr. Bertram.

"Oh, dear! oh, dear! Read it, Adela. Oh, Mr. Bertram, here is such a misfortune!"

"What is it, Miss Gauntlet? That fool will never tell me."

Adela took the letter, and read it through.

"Oh, sir," she said, "it is indeed a misfortune."

"Devil take it! what misfortune?"

"Caroline has quarrelled with Sir Henry," said Miss Baker.

"Oh, is that all?" said Mr. Bertram.

"Ah, sir; I fear this quarrel will prove serious," said Adela.

"Serious; nonsense; how serious? You never thought, did you, that he and she would live together
like turtle doves? He married for money, and she for ambition; of course they'll quarrel."
Such was the wisdom of Mr. Bertram, and at any rate he had experience on his side.

"But, uncle; she wishes to leave him, and hopes that you'll let her come here."

"Come here--fiddlestick! What should I do here with the wife of such a man as him?"

"She declares most positively that nothing shall induce her to live with him again."

"Fiddlestick!"

"But, uncle--"

"Why, what on earth did she expect? She didn't think to have it all sunshine, did she? When
she married the man, she knew she didn't care for him; and now she determines to leave him
because he won't pick up her pocket-handkerchief! If she wanted that kind of thing, why did
not she marry my nephew?"

This was the first time that Mr. Bertram had been heard to speak of George in a tone of affection,
and both Miss Baker and Miss Gauntlet were not a little surprised. They had never heard him
speak of Caroline as his granddaughter.

During the whole of that day, Mr. Bertram was obdurate; and he positively refused to receive
Lady Harcourt at his house unless she came there with the full permission of her husband. Miss
Baker, therefore, was obliged to write by the first post, asking for a day's delay before she
sent her final answer. But on the next morning a letter reached the old gentleman himself,
from Sir Henry. Sir Henry suggested that the loving grandchild should take the occasion of
the season being so nearly over to pay a much-desired visit to her loving grandsire. He did
not drop the quarrel altogether; but just alluded to it as a passing cloud--an unfortunate
cloud certainly, but one that, without doubt, would soon pass away, and leave the horizon more
bright than ever.

The matter was at last arranged by Mr. Bertram giving the desired permission. He took no notice
himself of Sir Henry's letter, but desired his niece to tell Caroline that she might come there
if she liked. So Caroline did come; and Sir Henry gave it out that the London season had been
too much for her, and that she, to her deep regret, had been forced to leave town before it
was over.

"Sir Omicron was quite imperative," said Sir Henry, speaking confidentially to his intimate
parliamentary friend Mr. Madden; "and as she was to go, it was as well to do the civil to grandpapa
Croesus. I have no time myself; so I must do it by deputy."

Now Sir Omicron in those days was a great physician.

And so Caroline returned to Hadley; but no bells rang now to greet her coming. Little more
than six months had passed since those breakfast speeches had been spoken, in which so much
golden prosperity had been promised to bride and bridegroom; and now that vision of gold was
at an end; that solid, substantial prosperity had melted away. The bridal dresses of the maids
had hardly lost their gloss, and yet all that well-grounded happiness was gone.

"So, you are come back," said Mr. Bertram.

"Yes, sir," said Caroline, in a low voice. "I have made a mistake in life, and I must hope
that you will forgive me."

"Such mistakes are very foolish. The sooner you unmake it the better."

"There will be no unmaking this mistake, sir, never--never--never. But I blame no one but myself."

"Nonsense! you will of course go back to your husband."

"Never, Mr. Bertram--never! I will obey him, or you, or both, if that be possible, in all things
but in that. But in that I can obey no one."

"Psha!" said Mr. Bertram. Such was Lady Harcourt's first greeting on her return to Hadley.

Neither Miss Baker nor Adela said much to her on the matter on the first day of her arrival.
Her aunt, indeed, never spoke openly to her on the subject. It seemed to be understood between
them that it should be dropped. And there was occasionally a weight of melancholy about Lady
Harcourt, amounting in appearance almost to savage sternness, which kept all inquiry aloof.
Even her grandfather hesitated to speak to her about her husband, and allowed her to live unmolested
in the quiet, still, self-controlling mood which she seemed to have adopted with a determined
purpose.

For the first fortnight she did not leave the house. At the expiration of that time, on one
fine sunny Sunday morning she came down dressed for church. Miss Baker remarked that the very
clothes she wore were things that had belonged to her before her marriage, and were all of
them of the simplest that a woman can wear without making herself conspicuous before the world.
All her jewelry she had laid aside, and every brooch, and every ring that had come to her as
a married woman, or as a girl about to be married--except that one ring from which an iron
fate would not allow her to be parted. Ah, if she could but have laid aside that also!

And then she went to church. There were the same persons there to stare at her now, in her
quiet wretchedness, who were there before staring at her in her--triumph may I say? No, there
had been no triumph; little even then, except wretchedness; but that misery had not been so
open to the public eye.

She went through it very well; and seemed to suffer even less than did her aunt. She had done
nothing to spread abroad among the public of Hadley that fiction as to Sir Omicron's opinion
which her lord had been sedulous to disseminate in London. She had said very little about herself,
but she had at any rate said nothing false. Nor had she acted falsely; or so as to give false
impressions. All that little world now around her knew that she had separated herself from
her grand husband; and most of them had heard that she had no intention of returning to him.

She had something, therefore, to bear as she sat out that service; and she bore it well. She
said her prayers, or seemed to say them, as though unconscious that she were in any way a mark
for other women's eyes. And when the sermon was over, she walked home with a steady, even step;
whereas Miss Baker trembled at every greeting she received, and at every step she heard.

On that afternoon, Caroline opened her heart to Adela. Hitherto little had passed between them,
but those pressings of the hand, those mute marks of sympathy which we all know so well how
to give when we long to lighten the sorrows which are too deep to be probed by words. But on
this evening after their dinner, Caroline called Adela into her room, and then there was once
more confidence between them.

"No, no, Adela, I will never go back to him." Caroline went on protesting; "you will not ask
me to do that?"

"Those whom God has joined together, let not man put asunder," said Adela, solemnly.

"Ah, yes; those whom God has joined. But did God join us?"

"Oh, Caroline; do not speak so."

"But, Adela, do not misunderstand me. Do not think that I want to excuse what I have done;
or even to escape the penalty. I have destroyed myself as regards this world. All is over for
me here. When I brought myself to stand at that altar with a man I never loved; whom I knew
I never could love--whom I never tried, and never would try to love--when I did that, I put
myself beyond the pale of all happines. Do not think that I hope for any release." And Lady
Harcourt looked stern enough in her resolution to bear all that fate could bring on her.

"Caroline, God will temper the wind to the shorn lamb, now as always if you will ask him."

"I hope so; I hope so, Adela."

"Say that you trust so."

"I do trust. I trust in this--that He will do what is best. Oh, Adela! if you could know what
the last month has been; since he came to the house!"

"Ah! why did he ever come?"

"Why, indeed! Did a man ever behave so madly?"

The man she here alluded was Sir Henry Harcourt, not Mr. Bertram.

"But I am glad of it, dearest; very glad. Is it not better so? The truth has been spoken now.
I have told him all."

"You mean Sir Henry?"

"Yes, I told him all before I left. But it was nothing new, Adela. He knew it before. He never
dreamed that I loved him. He knew, he must have known that I hated him."

"Oh, Caroline, Caroline! do not speak like that."

"And would not you have hated him had you been tied to him? Now that sin will be over. I shall
hate him no longer now."

"Such hatred is a crime. Say what you will, he is still your husband."

"I deny it. What! when he called me by that name, was he my husband then? Was that a husband's
usage? I must carry his name, and wearily walk with that burden to the grave. Such is my penalty
for that day's sin. I must abandon all hope of living as other women live. I shall have no
shoulder on which to lean, hear no words of love when I am sick, have no child to comfort me.
I shall be alone, and yet not master of myself. This I must bear because I was false to my
own heart. But yet he is not my husband. Listen to me, Adela; sooner than return to him again,
I would put an end to all this world's misery at once. That would be sinful, but the sin would
be lighter than that other sin."

When she spoke in this way, Adela no longer dared to suggest to her that she and Sir Henry
might even yet again live together. In Adela's own mind, that course, and that alone, would
have been the right one. She looked on such unions as being literally for better or for worse;
and failing to reach the better, she would have done her best, with God's assistance, to bear
the worst. But then Adela Gauntlet could never have placed herself in the position which Lady
Harcourt now filled.

But greatly as they differed, still there was confidence between them. Caroline could talk
to her, and to her only. To her grandfather she was all submission; to her aunt she was gentle
and affectionate; but she never spoke of her fate with either of them. And so they went on
till Adela left them in July; and then the three that were left behind lived together as quiet
a household as might have been found in the parish of Hadley, or perhaps in the county of Middlesex.

During this time Lady Harcourt had received two letters from her husband, in both of which
he urged her to return to him. In answer to the first, she assured him, in the civilest words
which she knew how to use, that such a step was impossible; but, at the same time, she signified
her willingness to obey him in any other particular, and suggested that as they must live apart,
her present home with her grandfather would probably be thought to be the one most suitable
for her. In answer to the second, she had simply told him that she must decline any further
correspondence with him as to the possibility of her return.

His next letter was addressed to Mr. Bertram. In this he did not go into the matter of their
difference at all, but merely suggested that he should be allowed to call at Hadley--with the
object of having an interview with Mr. Bertram himself.

"There," said the old man, when he found himself alone with his granddaughter; "read that."
And Caroline did read it. "What am I to say to that?"

"What do you think you ought to say, sir?"

"I suppose I must see him. He'll bring an action against me else, for keeping his wife from
him. Mind, I tell you, you'll have to go back to him."

"No, sir! I shall not do that," said Caroline, very quietly, with something almost like a smile
on her face. And then she left him, and he wrote his answer to Sir Henry.

And then Sir Henry came down to Hadley. A day had been named, and Caroline was sore put to
it to know how she might best keep out of the way. At last she persuaded her aunt to go up
to London with her for the day. This they did, both of them fearing, as they got out of the
train and returned to it, that they might unfortunately meet the man they so much dreaded.
But fortune was not so malicious to them; and when they returned to Hadley they found that
Sir Henry had also returned to London.

"He speaks very fair," said Mr. Bertram, who sent for Caroline to come to him alone in the
dining-room.

"Does he, sir?"

"He is very anxious that you should go back."

"Ah, sir, I cannot do that."

"He says you shall have the house in Eaton Square to yourself for the next three months."

"I shall never go back to Eaton Square, sir."

"Or he will take a small place for you anywhere at the sea-side that you may choose."

"I shall want no place if you will allow me to remain here."

"But he has all your money, you know--your fortune is now his."

"Well, sir!"

"And what do you mean to do?"

"I will do what you bid me--except going back to him."

The old man sat silent for awhile, and then again he spoke.

"Well, I don't suppose you know your own mind, as yet."

"Oh, sir! indeed I do."

"I say I suppose you don't. Don't interrupt me--I have suggested this: that you should remain
here six months, and that then he should come again and see--"

"You, sir."

"Well--see me, if I'm alive: at the end of that time you'll have to go back to him. Now, good-night."

And so it was settled; and for the next six months the same dull, dreary life went on in the
old house at Hadley.

CHAPTER VIII.

CAIRO.

Men and women, or I should rather say ladies and gentlemen, used long ago, when they gave signs
of weakness about the chest, to be sent to the south of Devonshire; after that, Madeira came
into fashion; but now they are all despatched to Grand Cairo. Cairo has grown to be so near
home, that it will soon cease to be beneficial, and then the only air capable of revigorating
the English lungs will be that of Labuan or Jeddo.

But at the present moment, Grand Cairo has the vogue. Now it had so happened during the last
winter, and especially in the trying month of March, that Arthur Wilkinson's voice had become
weak; and he had a suspicious cough, and was occasionally feverish, and perspired o'nights;
and on these accounts the Sir Omicron of the Hurst Staple district ordered him off to Grand Cairo.

This order was given in October, with reference to the coming winter, and in the latter end
of November, Arthur Wilkinson started for the East. Two articles he had first to seek--the
one being a necessary, and the other a luxury--and both he found. These were a curate and a
companion. The Reverend Gabriel Gilliflower was his curate; and of him we need only hope that
he prospered well, and lived happily under the somewhat stern surveillance of his clerical
superior, Mrs. Wilkinson. His companion was George Bertram.

About the end of November they started through France, and got on board the P. and O. Company's
vessel at Marseilles. It is possible that there may be young ladies so ignorant as not to know
that the P. and O. is the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and therefore the
matter is now explained. In France they did not stop long enough to do more than observe how
much better the railway carriages are there than in England, how much dearer the hotels are
in Paris than in London, and how much worse they are in Marseilles than in any other known
town in the world.

Nor need much be said of their journey thence to Alexandria. Of Malta, I should like to write
a book, and may perhaps do so some day; but I shall hardly have time to discuss its sunlight,
and fortifications, and hospitality, and old magnificence, in the fag-end of a third volume;
so we will pass on to Alexandria.

Oh, Alexandria! mother of sciences! once the favoured seat of the earth's learning! Oh, Alexandria!
beloved by the kings! It is of no use. No man who has seen the Alexandria of the present day
can keep a seat on a high horse when he speaks of that most detestable of cities. How may it
fitly be described? May we not say that it has all the filth of the East, without any of that
picturesque beauty with which the East abounds; and that it has also the eternal, grasping,
solemn love of lucre which pervades our western marts, but wholly unredeemed by the society,
the science, and civilization of the West?

Alexandria is fast becoming a European city; but its Europeans are from Greece and the Levant!
"Auri sacra fames!" is the motto of modern Greece. Of Alexandria it should be, "Auri fames
sacrissima!" Poor Arabs! poor Turks! giving way on all sides to wretches so much viler than
yourselves, what a destiny is before you!

"What income," I asked a resident in Alexandria, "what income should an Englishman have to
live here comfortably?" "To live here comfortably, you should say ten thousand a year, and
then let him cut his throat first!" Such was my friend's reply.

But God is good, and Alexandria will become a place less detestable than at present. Fate and
circumstances must Anglicize it in spite of the huge French consulate, in spite of legions
of greedy Greeks; in spite even of sand, musquitos, bugs, and dirt, of winds from India, and
of thieves from Cyprus.

The P. and O. Company will yet be the lords of Egypt; either that or some other company or
set of men banded together to make Egypt a highway. It is one stage on our road to the East;
and the time will soon come when of all the stages it will neither be the slowest nor the least
comfortable. The railway from Alexandria to Suez is now all opened within ten miles; will be
all opened before these pages can be printed. This railway belongs to the viceroy of Egypt;
but his passengers are the Englishmen of India, and his paymaster is an English company.

But, for all that, I do not recommend any of my friends to make a long sojourn at Alexandria.

Bertram and Wilkinson did not do so, but passed on speedily to Cairo. They went to the Pharos
and to Pompey's Pillar; inspected Cleopatra's Needle, and the newly excavated so-called Greek
church; watched the high spirits of one set of passengers going out to India--young men free
of all encumbrances, and pretty girls full of life's brightest hopes--and watched also the
morose, discontented faces of another set returning home, burdened with babies and tawny-coloured
nurses, with silver rings in their toes--and then they went off to Cairo.

There is no romance now, gentle readers, in this journey from Alexandria to Cairo; nor was
there much when it was taken by our two friends. Men now go by railway, and then they went
by the canal boat. It is very much like English travelling, with this exception, that men dismount
from their seats, and cross the Nile in a ferry-boat, and that they pay five shillings for
their luncheon instead of sixpence. This ferry does, perhaps, afford some remote chance of
adventure, as was found the other day, when a carriage was allowed to run down the bank, in
which was sitting a native prince, the heir to the pasha's throne. On that occasion the adventure
was important, and the prince was drowned. But even this opportunity for incident will soon
disappear; for Mr. Brunel, or Mr. Stephenson, or Mr. Locke, or some other British engineering
celebrity, is building a railway bridge over the Nile, and then the modern traveller's heart
will be contented, for he will be able to sleep all the way from Alexandria to Cairo.

Mr. Shepheard's hotel at Cairo is to an Englishman the centre of Egypt, and there our two friends
stopped. And certainly our countrymen have made this spot more English than England itself.
If ever John Bull reigned triumphant anywhere; if he ever shows his nature plainly marked by
rough plenty, coarseness, and good intention, he does so at Shepheard's hotel. If there be
anywhere a genuine, old-fashioned John Bull landlord now living, the landlord of the hotel
at Cairo is the man. So much for the strange new faces and outlandish characters which one
meets with in one's travels.

I will not trouble my readers by a journey up the Nile; nor will I even take them up a pyramid.
For do not fitting books for such purposes abound at Mr. Mudie's? Wilkinson and Bertram made
both the large tour and the little one in proper style. They got as least as far as Thebes,
and slept a night under the shade of King Cheops.

One little episode on their road from Cairo to the Pyramids, I will tell. They had joined a
party of which the conducting spirit was a missionary clergyman, who had been living in the
country for some years, and therefore knew its ways. No better conducting spirit for such a
journey could have been found; for he joined economy to enterprise, and was intent that everything
should be seen, and that everything should be seen cheaply.

Old Cairo is a village some three miles from the city, higher up the river; and here, close
to the Nilometer, by which the golden increase of the river is measured, tourists going to
the Pyramids are ferried over the river. The tourists are ferried over, as also are the donkeys
on which the tourists ride. Now here arose a great financial question. The reis or master of
the ferry-boat to which the clerical guide applied was a mighty man, some six feet high, graced
with a turban, as Arabs are; erect in his bearing, with bold eye, and fine, free, supple limbs--a
noble reis for that Nile ferry-boat. But, noble as he was, he wanted too many piastres--twopence-halfpenny
a head too much for each donkey, with its rider.

And then there arose a great hubbub. The ordinary hubbub at this spot is worse than the worst
confusion of any other Babel. For the traffic over the Nile is great, and for every man, woman,
and child, for every horse and every ass, for every bundle of grass, for every cock and for
every hen, a din of twenty tongues is put in motion, and a perpetual fury rages, as the fury
of a hurricane. But the hubbub about the missionary's piastres rose higher than all the other
hubbubs. Indeed, those who were quarrelling before about their own affairs came and stood round
in a huge circle, anxious to know how the noble reis and his clerical opponent would ultimately
settle this stiff financial difficulty.

In half an hour neither side would yield one point; but then at last the Egyptian began to
show that, noble as he looked, he was made of stuff compressible. He gradually gave up, para
by para, till he allowed donkeys, men, and women to clamber over the sides of his boat at the
exact price named by him of the black coat. Never did the church have a more perfect success.

But the battle was not yet over. No sooner was the vessel pushed off into the stream, than
the noble reis declared that necessity compelled him to demand the number of piastres originally
named by him. He regretted it, but he assured the clergyman that he had no other alternative.

And now how did it behove an ardent missionary to act in such a contest with a subtle Egyptian?
How should the eloquence of the church prevail over this Eastern Mammon? It did prevail very
signally. The soldier of peace, scorning further argument in words with such a crafty reis,
mindful of the lessons of his youth, raised his right hand, and with one blow between the eyes,
laid the Arab captain prostrate on his own deck.

"There," said he, turning to Wilkinson, "that is what we call a pastoral visitation in this
country. We can do nothing without it."

The poor reis picked himself up, and picked up also his turban, which had been knocked off,
and said not a word more about the piastres. All the crew worked with double diligence at their
oars, and the party, as they disembarked from the boat, were treated with especial deference.
Even the donkeys were respected. In Egypt the donkeys of a man are respected, ay, and even
his donkey-boys, when he shows himself able and willing to knock down all those around him.

A great man there, a native, killed his cook one morning in a rage; and a dragoman, learned
in languages, thus told the story to an Englishman:--"De sahib, him vera respecble man. Him
kill him cook, Solyman, this morning. Oh, de sahib particklar respecble!" After all, it may
be questioned whether this be not a truer criterion of respectability than that other one of
keeping a gig.

Oh, those pyramid guides! foul, false, cowardly, bullying thieves! A man who goes to Cairo
must see the Pyramids. Convention, and the laws of society as arranged on that point, of course
require it. But let no man, and, above all, no woman, assume that the excursion will be in
any way pleasurable. I have promised that I will not describe such a visit, but I must enter
a loud, a screeching protest against the Arab brutes--the schieks being the very worst of the
brutes--who have these monuments in their hands. Their numbers, the filthiness of their dress--or
one might almost say no dress--their stench, their obscene indecency, their clattering noise,
their rapacity, exercised without a moment's intercession; their abuse, as in this wise: "Very
bad English-man; dam bad; dam, dam, dam! Him want to take all him money to the grave; but no,
no, no! Devil hab him, and money too!" This, be it remembered, from a ferocious, almost blackened
Arab, with his face within an inch of your own. And then their flattery, as in this wise: "Good
English-man--very good!"--and then a tawny hand pats your face, and your back, and the calves
of your leg--"Him gib poor Arab one shilling for himself--yes, yes, yes! and then Arab no let
him tumble down and break all him legs--yes, yes; break all him legs." And then the patting
goes on again. These things, I say, put together, make a visit to the Pyramids no delightful
recreation. My advice to my countrymen who are so unfortunate as to visit them is this: Let
the ladies remain below--not that they ever will do so, if the gentlemen who are with them
ascend--and let the men go armed with stout sticks, and mercilessly belabour any Arab who attempts
either to bully or to wheedle.

Let every Englishman remember this also, that the ascent is not difficult, though so much noise
is made about the difficulty as naturally to make a man think that it is so. And let this also
be remembered, that nothing is to be gained by entering the pyramid except dirt, noise, stench,
vermin, abuse, and want of air. Nothing is to be seen there--nothing to be heard. A man may
sprain his ankle, and certainly will knock his head. He will encounter no other delights but these.

But he certainly will come out a wiser man than he went in. He will then be wise enough to
know how wretched a place is the interior of a pyramid--an amount of wisdom with which no teaching
of mine will imbue him.

Bertram and Wilkinson were sitting beneath the pyramid, with their faces toward the desert,
enjoying the cool night air, when they first began to speak of Adela Gauntlet. Hitherto Arthur
had hardly mentioned her name. They had spoken much of his mother, much of the house at Hurst
Staple, and much also of Lady Harcourt, of whose separation from her husband they were of course
aware; but Arthur had been shy of mentioning Adela's name.

They had been speaking of Mrs. Wilkinson, and the disagreeable position in which the vicar
found himself in his own house; when, after sitting silent for a moment, he said, "After all,
George, I sometimes think that it would have been better for me to have married."

"Of course it would--or rather, I should say, will be better. It is what you will do when you
return."

"I don't know about my health now."

"Your health will be right enough after this winter. I don't see much the matter with it."

"I am better, certainly;" and then there was another pause.

"Arthur," continued Bertram, "I only wish that I had open before me the same chance in life
that you have--the same chance of happiness."

"Do not despair, George. A short time cures all our wounds."

"Yes; a short time does cure them all--and then comes chaos."

"I meant a short time in this world."

"Well, all things are possible; but I do not understand how mine are to be cured. They have
come too clearly from my own folly."

"From such folly," said Arthur, "as always impedes the working of human prudence."

"Do you remember, Arthur, my coming to you the morning after the degrees came down--when you
were so low in spirits because you had broken down--when I was so full of triumph?"

"I remember the morning well; but I do not remember any triumph on your part."

"Ah! I was triumphant--triumphant in my innermost heart. I thought then that all the world
must give way to me, because I had taken a double-first. And now--I have given way before all
the world. What have I done with all the jewels of my youth? Thrown them before swine!"

"Come, George; you are hardly seven-and-twenty yet."

"No, hardly; and I have no profession, no fortune, no pursuit, and no purpose. I am here, sitting
on the broken stone of an old tomb, merely because it is as well for me to be here as elsewhere.
I have made myself to be one as to whose whereabouts no man need make inquiry--and no woman.
If that black, one-eyed brute, whom I thrashed a-top of the pyramid, had stuck his knife in
me, who would have been the worse for it? You, perhaps--for six weeks or so."

"You know there are many would have wept for you."

"I know but one. She would have wept, while it would be ten times better that she should rejoice.
Yes, she would weep; for I have marred her happiness as I have marred my own. But who cares
for me, of whose care I can be proud? Who is anxious for me, whom I can dare to thank, whom
I may dare to love?"

"Do we not love you at Hurst Staple?"

"I do not know. But I know this, that you ought to be ashamed of me. I think Adela Gauntlet
is my friend; that is, if in our pig-headed country a modest girl may love a man who is neither
her brother nor her lover."

"I am sure she is," said Arthur; and then there was another pause. "Do you know," he continued,
"I once thought--"

"Thought what?"

"That you were fond of Adela."

"So I am, heartily fond of her."

"But I mean more than that."

"You once thought that I would have married her if I could. That is what you mean."

"Yes," said Wilkinson, blushing to his eyes. But it did not matter; for no one could see him.

"Well, I will make a clean breast of it, Arthur. Men can talk here, sitting in the desert,
who would be as mute as death at home in England. Yes; there was once a moment, once one moment,
in which I would have married her--a moment in which I flattered myself that I could forget
Caroline Waddington. Ah! if I could tell you how Adela behaved!"

"How did she behave? Tell me--what did she say?" said Arthur, with almost feverish anxiety.

"She bade me remember, that those who dare to love must dare to suffer. She told me that the
wounded stag, 'that from the hunter's aim has ta'en a hurt,' must endure to live, 'left and
abandoned of his velvet friends.'--And she told me true. I have not all her courage; but I
will take a lesson from her, and learn to suffer--quietly, without a word, if that be possible."

"Then you did propose to her?"

"No; hardly that. I cannot tell what I said myself; but 'twas thus she answered me."

"But what do you mean by taking a lesson from her? Has she any such suffering?"

"Nay! You may ask her. I did not."

"But you said so just now; at any rate you left me to infer it. Is there any one whom Adela
Gauntlet really loves?"

George Bertram did not answer the question at once. He had plighted his word to her as her
friend that he would keep her secret; and then, moreover, that secret had become known to him
by mere guesses. He had no right, by any law, to say it as a fact that Adela Gauntlet was not
heart-whole. But still he thought that he would say so. Why should he not do something towards
making these two people happy?

"Do you believe that Adela is really in love with any one?" repeated Arthur.

"If I tell you that, will you tell me this--Are you in love with any one--you yourself?"

The young clergyman was again ruby red up to his forehead. He could dare to talk about Adela,
but hardly about himself.

"I in love!" he said at last. "You know that I have been obliged to keep out of that kind of
thing. Circumstanced as I have been, I could not marry."

"But that does not keep a man from falling in love."

"Does not it?" said Arthur, rather innocently.

"That has not preserved me--nor, I presume, has it preserved you. Come, Arthur, be honest;
if a man with thirty-nine articles round his neck can be honest. Out with the truth at once.
Do you love Adela, or do you not?"

But the truth would not come out so easily. Whether it was the thirty-nine articles, or the
natural modesty of the man's disposition, I will not say; but he did not find himself at the
moment able to give a downright answer to this downright question. He would have been well
pleased that Bertram should know the whole truth; but the task of telling it went against the
grain with him.

"If you do, and do not tell her so," continued Bertram, when he found that he got no immediate
reply, "I shall think you--. But no; a man must be his own judge in such matters, and of all
men I am the least fit to be a judge of others. But I would that it might be so, for both your
sakes."

"Why, you say yourself that she likes some one else."

"I have never said so. I have said nothing like it. There; when you get home, do you yourself
ask her whom she loves. But remember this--if it should chance that she should say that it
is you, you must be prepared to bear the burden, whatever may be urged to the contrary at the
vicarage. And now we will retire to roost in this hole of ours."

Arthur had as yet made no reply to Bertram's question; but as he crept along the base of the
pyramid, feeling his steps among the sand and loose stones, he did manage to say a word or
two of the truth.

"God bless you, George. I do love her--very dearly." And then the two cousins understood each
other.

It has been said that Alexandria has nothing of an Eastern town but its filth. This cannot
at all be said of Cairo. It may be doubted whether Bagdad itself is more absolutely oriental
in its appurtenances. When once the Englishman has removed himself five hundred yards from
Shepheard's hotel, he begins to feel that he is really in the East. Within that circle, although
it contains one of the numerous huge buildings appropriated to the viceroy's own purposes,
he is still in Great Britain. The donkey-boys curse in English, instead of Arabic; the men
you meet sauntering about, though they do wear red caps, have cheeks as red; and the road is
broad and macadamized, and Britannic. But anywhere beyond that circle Lewis might begin to paint.

Cairo is a beautiful old city; so old in the realities of age that it is crumbling into dust
on every side. From time to time the houses are patched up, but only patched; and, except on
the Britannic soil above alluded to, no new houses are built. It is full of romance, of picturesque
oriental wonders, of strange sights, strange noises, and strange smells. When one is well in
the town, every little narrow lane, every turn--and the turns are incessant--every mosque and
every shop creates fresh surprise. But I cannot allow myself to write a description of Cairo.

How the dervishes there spun and shook, going through their holy exercises with admirable perseverance,
that I must tell. This occurred towards the latter end of the winter, when Wilkinson and Bertram
had nearly completed their sojourn in Cairo. Not but what the dervishes had roared out their
monotonous prayer to Allah, duly every Friday, at 1 P.M., with as much precision as a service
in one of your own cathedrals; but our friends had put the thing off, as hardly being of much
interest, and at last went there when they had only one Friday left for the performance.

I believe that, as a rule, a Mahomedan hates a Christian: regarding him merely as Christian,
he certainly does so. Had any tidings of confirmed success on the part of the rebels in India
reached the furthermost parts of the Turkish empire, no Christian life would have been safe
there. The horrid outrage perpetrated at Jaffa, and the massacre at Jeddah, sufficiently show
us what we might have expected. In Syria no Christian is admitted within a mosque, for his
foot and touch are considered to carry pollution.

But in Egypt we have caused ourselves to be better respected: we thrash the Arabs and pay them,
and therefore they are very glad to see us anywhere. And even the dervishes welcome us to their
most sacred rites, with excellent coffee, and a loan of rush-bottomed chairs. Now, when it
is remembered that a Mahomedan never uses a chair, it must be confessed that this is very civil.
Moreover, let it be said to their immortal praise, that the dervishes of Cairo never ask for
backsheish. They are the only people in the country that do not.

So Bertram and Wilkinson had their coffee with sundry other travelling Britons who were there;
and then each, with his chair in his hand went into the dervishes' hall. This was a large,
lofty, round room, the roof of which was in the shape of a cupola; on one side, that which
pointed towards Mecca, and therefore nearly due east, there was an empty throne, or tribune,
in which the head of the college, or dean of the chapter of dervishes, located himself on his
haunches. He was a handsome, powerful man, of about forty, with a fine black beard, dressed
in a flowing gown, and covered by a flat-topped black cap.

By degrees, and slowly, in came the college of the dervishes, and seated themselves as their
dean was seated; but they sat on the floor in a circle, which spread away from the tribune,
getting larger and larger in its dimensions as fresh dervishes came in. There was not much
attention to regularity in their arrival, for some appeared barely in time for the closing scene.

The commencement was tame enough. Still seated, they shouted out a short prayer to Allah a
certain number of times. The number was said to be ninety-nine. But they did not say the whole
prayer at once, though it consisted of only three words. They took the first word ninety-nine
times; and then the second; and then the third. The only sound to be recognized was that of
Allah; but the deep guttural tone in which this was groaned out by all the voices together,
made even that anything but a distinct word.

And so this was completed, the circle getting ever larger and larger. And it was remarked that
men came in as dervishes who belonged to various ordinary pursuits and trades; there were soldiers
in the circle, and, apparently, common labourers. Indeed, any one may join; though I presume
he would do so with some danger were it discovered that he were not a Mahomedan.

Those who specially belonged to the college had peculiar gowns and caps, and herded together
on one side of the circle; and it appeared to our friends, that throughout the entertainment
they were by far the least enthusiastic of the performers.

When this round of groaning had been completed--and it occupied probably half an hour--a young
lad, perhaps of seventeen years, very handsome, and handsomely dressed in a puce-coloured cloak,
or rather petticoat, with a purple hat on his head, in shape like an inverted flower-pot, slipped
forth from near the tribune into the middle of the circle, and began to twirl. After about
five or six minutes, two other younger boys, somewhat similarly dressed, did the same, and
twirled also; so that there were three twirling together.

But the twirling of the elder boy was by far the more graceful. Let any young lady put out
both her hands, so as to bring the one to the level of her waist, and the other with the crown
of her head, and then go round and round, as nearly as possible on the same spot; let her do
this so that no raising of either foot shall ever be visible; and let her continue it for fifteen
minutes, without any variation in the attitude of her arms, or any sign of fatigue,--and then
she may go in for a twirling dervish. It is absurd to suppose that any male creature in England
could perform the feat. During this twirling, a little black boy marked the time, by beating
with two sticks on a rude gong.

This dance was kept up at first for fifteen minutes. Then there was another short spell of
howling; then another dance, or twirl; and then the real game began.

The circle had now become so large as to occupy the greater part of the hall, and was especially
swelled by sundry new arrivals at this moment. In particular, there came one swarthy, tall,
wretched-looking creature, with wild eyes, wan face, and black hair of extraordinary length,
who took up his position, standing immediately opposite to the tribune. Other new comers also
stood near him, all of whom were remarkable for the length of their hair. Some of them had
it tied up behind like women, and now proceeded to unloose it.

But at this period considerable toilet preparations were made for the coming work. All those
in the circle who had not come in from the college with gowns and caps, and one or two even
of them, deliberately took off their outer clothing, and tied it up in bundles. These bundles
they removed to various corners, so that each might again find his own clothes. One or two
put on calico dressing-gowns, which appeared to have been placed ready for the purpose; and
among these was the cadaverous man of the black hair.

And then they all stood up, the dean standing also before his tribune, and a deep-toned murmur
went round the circle. This also was the word Allah, as was duly explained to Bertram by his
dragoman; but without such explanation it would have been impossible to detect that any word
was pronounced. Indeed, the sound was of such nature as to make it altogether doubtful from
whence it came. It was like no human voice, or amalgamation of voices; but appeared as though
it came from the very bowels of the earth. At first it was exceedingly low, but it increased
gradually, till at last one might have fancied that the legions of Lucifer were groaning within
the very bowels of Pandemonium.

And also, by slow degrees, a motion was seen to pervade the circle. The men, instead of standing
fixedly on their legs, leaned over, first to the right and then to the left, all swaying backwards
and forwards together in the same direction, so that both sound and motion were as though they
came from one compact body.

And then, as the groan became louder, so did the motion become more violent, till the whole
body heaved backwards and forwards with the regularity of a pendulum and the voice of a steam-engine.
As the excitement became strong, the head of the dervishes walked along the inner circle, exciting
those to more violence who already seemed the most violent. This he did, standing for a few
minutes before each such man, bowing his own head rapidly and groaning deeply; and as he did
so, the man before whom he stood would groan and swing himself with terrible energy. And the
men with the long hair were especially selected.

And by degrees the lateral motion was abandoned, and the dervishes bowed their heads forwards
instead of sideways. No one who has not seen the operation can conceive what men may achieve
in the way of bowing and groaning. They bowed till they swept the floor with their long hair,
bending themselves double, and after each motion bringing themselves up again to an erect posture.
And the dean went backwards and forwards from one to another, urging them on.

By this time the sight was terrible to behold. The perspiration streamed down them, the sounds
came forth as though their very hearts were bursting, their faces were hidden by their dishevelled
locks, whatever clothes they wore were reeking wet. But still they flung themselves about,
the motion becoming faster and faster; and still the sounds came forth as though from the very
depths of Tartarus. And still the venerable dean went backwards and forwards slowly before
them, urging them on, and still urging them on.

But at last, nature with the greater number of them had made her last effort; the dean retired
to his tribune, and the circle was broken up. But those men with the long hair still persevered.
It appeared, both to Bertram and Wilkinson, that with them the effort was now involuntary.
They were carried on by an ecstatic frenzy; either that or they were the best of actors. The
circle had broken up, the dervishes were lying listlessly along the walls, panting with heat,
and nearly lifeless with their exertions; but some four, remaining with their feet fixed in
the old place, still bowed and still howled. "They will die," said Bertram.

"Will they not be stopped?" said Wilkinson to their dragoman.

"Five minutes, five minutes!" said the dragoman. "Look at him--look at him with the black hair!"
And they did look.

Three of them had now fallen, and the one remained still at his task. He swept the ground with
his hair, absolutely striking it with his head; and the sounds came forth from him loudly,
wildly, with broken gasps, with terrible exertion, as though each would be his last, and yet
they did nothing to repress him.

At last it seemed as though the power of fully raising his head had left him, and also that
of lowering it to the ground. But still he made as it were a quarter-circle. His hands were
clutched behind his back, and with this singular motion, and in this singular attitude, he
began to move his feet; and still groaning and half bowing, he made a shuffling progress across
the hall.

The dervishes themselves appeared to take no notice of him. The dean stood tranquil under his
tribune; those who had recovered from their exertions were dressing themselves, the others
lay about collecting their breath. But the eyes of every stranger were on the still moving
black-haired devotee.

On he went, still howling and still swinging his head, right towards the wall of the temple.
His pace was not fast, but it seemed as though he would inevitably knock his own brains out
by the motion of his own head; and yet nobody stopped him.

"He'll kill himself," said Wilkinson.

"No, no, no!" said the dragoman; "him no kill--him head berry hard."

Bertram rushed forward as though to stay the infuriate fanatic, but one or two of the dervishes
who stood around gently prevented him, without speaking a word.

And then the finale came. Crack he went against the wall, rebounded off, and went at it again,
and then again. They were no mock blows, but serious, heavy raps, as from a small battering-ram.
But yet both Bertram and Wilkinson were able to observe that he did not strike the wall, as
he would naturally have done had there been no precaution. Had he struck it with his head in
motion, as was intended to be believed, the blow would have come upon his forehead and temples,
and must probably have killed him; but instead of this, just as he approached the wall, he
butted at it like a ram, and saved his forehead at the expense of his pole. It may probably
be surmised, therefore, that he knew what he was about.

After these three raps, the man stood, still doubled up, but looking as though he were staggered.
And then he went again with his head towards the wall. But the dean, satisfied with what had
been done, now interposed, and this best of dervishes was gently laid on his back upon the
floor, while his long matted hair was drawn from off his face. As he so lay, the sight was
not agreeable to Christian eyes, whatever a true Mahomedan might think of it.

'Twas thus the dervishes practised their religious rites at Cairo. "I wonder how much that
black fellow gets paid every Friday," said Bertram, as he mounted his donkey; "it ought to
be something very handsome."

CHAPTER IX.

THE TWO WIDOWS.

The winter was now nearly over, and the travellers had determined to return to England. Whatever
other good purpose the city of Cairo might or might not serve, it had restored Wilkinson to
health. Bertram was sufficiently weary of living in a country in which the women go about with
their faces hidden by long dirty stripes of calico, which they call veils, and in which that
little which is seen of the ladies by no means creates a wish to see more. And Wilkinson, since
the conversation which they had had at the Pyramids, was anxious to assume his own rights in
the vicarage-house at Hurst Staple. So they decided on returning about the middle of March;
but they decided also on visiting Suez before doing so.

In these days men go from Cairo to Suez as they do from London to Birmingham--by railway; in
those days--some ten or twelve years back, that is--they went in wooden boxes, and were dragged
by mules through the desert.

We cannot stay long at Suez, nor should I carry my reader there, even for a day, seeing how
triste and dull the place is, had not our hero made an acquaintance there which for some time
was likely to have a considerable effect on his future life.

Suez is indeed a triste, unhappy, wretched place. It is a small oriental town, now much be-Europeanized,
and in the process of being be-Anglicized. It is not so Beelzebub-ridden a spot as Alexandria,
nor falling to pieces like Cairo. But it has neither water, air, nor verdure. No trees grow
there, no rivers flow there. Men drink brine and eat goats; and the thermometer stands at eighty
in the shade in winter. The oranges are the only luxury. There is a huge hotel, which contains
long rows of hot cells, and a vast cave in which people eat. The interest of the place consists
in Pharoah's passage over the Red Sea; but its future prosperity will be caused by a transit
of a different nature:--the passage of the English to and from India will turn even Suez into
an important town.

Here the two travellers encountered a flood of Indians on their return home. The boat from
Calcutta came in while they were there, and suddenly all the cells were tenanted, and the cave
was full of spoiled children, tawny nurses, pale languid mothers, and dyspeptic fathers. These
were to be fellow-travellers homewards with Bertram and Wilkinson.

Neither of our friends regarded with favour the crowd which made them even more uncomfortable
than they had been before. As Englishmen in such positions generally do, they kept themselves
aloof and scowled, frowned at the children who whined in the nearest neighbourhood to them,
and listened in disgust to the continuous chatter about punkahs, tiffins, and bungalows.

But close to them, at the end of the long table, at the common dinner, sat two ladies, on whom
it was almost impossible for them to frown. For be it known that at these hotels in Egypt,
a man cannot order his dinner when he pleases. He must breakfast at nine, and dine at six,
as others do--or go without. And whether he dine, or whether he do not, he must pay. The Medes
and Persians were lax and pliable in their laws in comparison with these publicans.

Both George and Arthur would have frowned if they could have done so; but on these two ladies
it was impossible to frown. They were both young, and both pretty. George's neighbour was uncommonly
pretty--was, indeed, one of the prettiest women that he had ever seen;--that any man could
see anywhere. She was full of smiles too, and her smile was heavenly;--was full of words, and
her words were witty. She who sat next Arthur was perhaps less attractive; but she had large
soft eyes, which ever and anon she would raise to his face, and then let fall again to her
plate in a manner which made sparks fly round the heart even of our somewhat sombre young Hampshire
vicar.

The four were soon in full conversation, apparently much to the disgust of two military-looking
gentlemen who sat on the other side of the ladies. And it was evident that the military gentlemen
and the ladies were, or ought to be, on terms of intimacy; for proffers of soup, and mutton,
and wine were whispered low, and little attempts at confidential intercourse were made. But
the proffers were rejected, and the attempts were in vain. The ladies preferred to have their
plates and glasses filled by the strangers, turned their shoulders on their old friends with
but scant courtesy, and were quite indifferent to the frowns which at last clouded those two
military brows.

And the brows of Major Biffin and Captain M'Gramm were clouded. They had been filling the plates
and glasses of these two ladies all the way from Calcutta; they had walked with them every
day on deck, had fetched their chairs, picked up their handkerchiefs, and looked after their
bottled beer at tiffin-time with an assiduity which is more than commendable in such warm latitudes.
And now to be thrown on one side for two travelling Englishmen, one in a brown coat and the
other in a black one--for two muffs, who had never drunk sangaree or sat under a punkah!

This was unpleasant to Major Biffin and Captain M'Gramm. But then why had the major and the
captain boasted of the favours they had daily received, to that soft-looking, superannuated
judge, and to their bilious friend, Dr. O'Shaughnessy? The judge and the doctor had of course
their female allies, and had of course repeated to them all the boasts of the fortunate major
and of the fortunate captain. And was it not equally of course that these ladies should again
repeat the same to Mrs. Cox and Mrs. Price? For she who was so divinely perfect was Mrs. Cox,
and she of the soft, lustrous eyes was Mrs. Price. Those who think that such a course was not
natural know little of voyages home from Calcutta to Southampton.

But the major, who had been the admirer of Mrs. Cox, had done more than this--had done worse,
we may say. The world of the good ship "Lahore," which was bringing them all home, had declared
ever since they had left Point de Galle, that the major and Mrs. Cox were engaged.

Now, had the major, in boasting of his favours, boasted also of his engagement, no harm perhaps
might have come of it. The sweet good-nature of the widow might have overlooked that offence.
But he had boasted of the favours and pooh-poohed the engagement! "Hinc illæ lacrymæ." And
who shall say that the widow was wrong? And as to the other widow, Mrs. Price, she was tired
of Captain M'Gramm. A little fact had transpired about Captain M'Gramm, namely, that he was
going home to his wife. And therefore the two ladies, who had conspired together to be civil
to the two warriors, now conspired together to be uncivil to them. In England such things are
done, as it were, behind the scenes: there these little quarrels are managed in private. But
a passage home from India admits of but little privacy; there is no behind the scenes. The
two widows were used to this, and quarrelled with their military admirers in public without
any compunction.

"Hinc illæ lacrymæ." But the major was not inclined to shed his tears without an effort. He
had pooh-poohed the idea of marrying Mrs. Cox; but like many another man in similar circumstances,
he was probably willing enough to enter into such an arrangement now that the facility of doing
so was taken from him. It is possible that Mrs. Cox, when she turned her pretty shoulder on
Major Biffin, may herself have understood this phasis of human nature.

The major was a handsome man, with well-brushed hair, well-trimmed whiskers, a forehead rather
low, but very symmetrical, a well-shaped nose, and a small, pursy mouth. The worst of his face
was that you could by no means remember it. But he knew himself to be a handsome man, and he
could not understand how he could be laid aside for so ugly a lout as this stranger from England.
Captain M'Gramm was not a handsome man, and he was aware that he fought his battle under the
disadvantage of a wife. But he had impudence enough to compensate him for this double drawback.

During this first dinner, Arthur Wilkinson was not more than coldly civil to Mrs. Price; but
Bertram became after a while warmly civil to Mrs. Cox. It is so very nice to be smiled on by
the prettiest woman in the room; and it was long since he had seen the smile of any pretty
woman! Indeed, for the last eighteen months he had had but little to do with such smiles.

Before dinner was over, Mrs. Cox had explained to Bertram that both she and her friend Mrs.
Price were in deep affliction. They had recently lost their husbands--the one, by cholera;
that was poor dear Cox, who had been collector of the Honourable Company's taxes at Panjabee.
Whereas, Lieutenant Price, of the 71st Native Bengal Infantry, had succumbed to--here Mrs.
Cox shook her head, and whispered, and pointed to the champagne-glass which Bertram was in
the act of filling for her. Poor Cox had gone just eight months; but Price had taken his last
glass within six. And so Bertram knew all about it.

And then there was a great fuss in packing the travellers into the wooden boxes. It seems that
they had all made up their own parties by sixes, that being the number of which one box was
supposed to be capable. But pretty women are capricious, and neither Mrs. Price nor Mrs. Cox
were willing to abide by any such arrangement. When the time came for handing them in, they
both objected to the box pointed out to them by Major Biffin--refused to be lifted in by the
arms of Captain M'Gramm--got at last into another vacant box with the assistance of our friends--summoned
their dingy nurses and babies into the same box (for each was so provided)--and then very prettily
made way for Mr. Bertram and Mr. Wilkinson. And so they went across the desert.

Then they all stayed a night at Cairo, and then they went on to Alexandria. And by the time
that they were embarked in a boat together, on their way to that gallant first-class steamer,
the "Cagliari," they were as intimate as though they had travelled round the world together,
and had been as long about it as Captain Cook.

"What will you take with you, Mrs. Cox?" said Bertram, as he stood up in the boat with the
baby on one arm, while with the other he handed the lady towards the ship's ladder.

"A good ducking," said Mrs. Cox, with a cheery laugh, as at the moment a dashing wave covered
them with its spray. "And I've got it too, with a vengeance. Ha! ha! Take care of the baby,
whatever you do; and if she falls over, mind you go after her." And with another little peal
of silver ringing laughter, she tripped up the side of the ship, and Bertram, with the baby,
followed after her.

"She is such a giddy thing," said Mrs. Price, turning her soft eyes on poor Arthur Wilkinson.
"Oh, laws! I know I shall be drowned. Do hold me." And Arthur Wilkinson did hold her, and nearly
carried her up into the ship. As he did so, his mind would fly off to Adela Gauntlet; but his
arms and legs were not the less at the service of Mrs. Price.

"And now look after the places," said Mrs. Cox; "you haven't a moment to lose. And look here,
Mr. Bertram, mind, I won't sit next to Major Biffin. And, for heaven's sake, don't let us be
near that fellow M'Gramm." And so Bertram descended into the salon to place their cards in
the places at which they were to sit for dinner. "Two and two; opposite to each other," sang
out Mrs. Cox, as he went. There was a sweetness in her voice, a low, mellow cheeriness in her
tone, which, combined with her beauty, went far to atone for the nature of what she said; and
Bertram not unwillingly obeyed her behests.

"Oh, my blessed baby!" said Mrs. Price, as the nurse handed her the child--which, however,
she immediately handed back. "How can I thank you enough, Mr. Wilkinson? What should we have
done without you? I wonder whether it's near tiffin. I am so faint."

"Shall I fetch you anything?" said he.

"If you could get me a glass of porter. But I don't think they'll give it you. They are so
uncivil!"

Arthur went for the beer; but went in vain. The steward said that lunch would be ready at twelve
o'clock.

"They are such brutes!" said Mrs. Price. "Well, I suppose I must wait." And she again turned
her eyes upon Arthur, and he again thought of Adela Gauntlet.

And then there was the ordinary confusion of a starting ship. Men and women were hurrying about
after their luggage, asking all manner of unreasonable questions. Ladies were complaining of
their berths, and servants asking where on hearth they were to sleep. Gentlemen were swearing
that they had been shamefully doubled up--that is, made to lie with two or three men in the
same cabin; and friends were contriving to get commodious seats for dinner. The officers of
the ship were all busy, treating with apparent indifference the thousand questions that were
asked them on every side; and all was bustle, confusion, hurry, and noise.

And then they were off. The pistons of the engine moved slowly up and down, the huge cranks
revolved, and the waters under the bow rippled and gave way. They were off, and the business
of the voyage commenced. The younger people prepared for their flirtations, the mothers unpacked
their children's clothes, and the elderly gentlemen lighted their cigars.

"What very queer women they are!" said Arthur, walking the deck with his cousin.

"But very pretty, and very agreeable. I like them both."

"Don't you think them too free and easy?"

"Ah, you must not judge of them by women who have lived in England, who have always had the
comfort of well-arranged homes. They have been knocked about, ill used, and forced to bear
hardships as men bear them; but still there is about them so much that is charming. They are
so frank!"

"Yes, very frank," said Arthur.

"It is well to see the world on all sides," said George. "For myself, I think that we are lucky
to have come across them--that is, if Major Biffin does not cut my throat."

"I hope Captain M'Gramm won't cut mine. He looked as though he would."

"Did you ever see such an ass as that Biffin? I don't wonder that she has become sick of him;
and then he has behaved so very badly to her. I really do pity her. She has told me all about it."

"And so has Mrs. Price told me all about Captain M'Gramm."

"Has she? Well! It seems that he, Biffin, has taken advantage of her frank, easy manner, and
talked of her to every man in the ship. I think she has been quite right to cut him." And so
they discussed the two ladies.

And at last Mrs. Price got her porter, and Mrs. Cox got her pale ale. "I do like pale ale,"
said she; "I suppose it's vulgar, but I can't help that. What amuses me is, that so many ladies
drink it who are quite ashamed to say they like it."

"They take it for their health's sake," said Bertram.
