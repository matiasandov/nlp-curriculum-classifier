Looking at it from this point of view of the future, there seems to be something radically
wrong at present with the play provided for children of nursery age. In a very few years we
shall surely look back and wonder how we could have endured, for the children, the perverse
reign of the Golliwog dynasty and the despotism of Teddy-bears. More than that, it is pitiful
to hear of nurseries for Catholic children sometimes without shrine or altar or picture of
the Mother of God, and with one of these monsters on every chair. Something even deeper than
the artistic sense must revolt before long against this barbarous rule. The Teddy-bear, if
he has anything to impart, suggests his own methods of life and defence, and the Golliwog,
far worse--limp, hideous, without one characteristic grace, or spark of humour--suggests the
last extremity of what is embodied in the expression "letting oneself go." And these things
are loved! Pity the beautiful soul of the child, made for beautiful things. II y a toujours
en nous quelque chose qui veut ramper, said Pere de Ravignan, and to this the Golliwog makes
strong appeal. "Now we both know," she finished.

THE END
Page and line numbers in these notes refer to the original printed
text.

Obvious punctuation corrections have been applied silently
where applicable.

As much as possible, the original spelling in the
book has been preserved. And yet this pitiable being makes no appeal to the spirit of helpfulness.
Do what you can for him it is impossible to raise him up, the only thing is to go down with
him to his own level and stay there. The Golliwog is at heart a pessimist.

In contrast with this the presence of an altar or nursery shrine, though not a plaything, gives
a different tone to play--a tone of joy and heavenliness that go down into the soul and take
root there to grow into something lasting and beautiful. There are flowers to be brought, and
lights, and small processions, and evening recollection with quietness of devotion, with security
in the sense of heavenly protection, with the realization of the "great cloud of witnesses"
who are around to make play safe and holy, and there is through it all the gracious call to
things higher, to be strong, to be unselfish, to be self-controlled, to be worthy of these
protectors and friends in heaven.

There is another side also to the question of nursery play, and that is what may be called
the play-values of the things provided. Mechanical toys are wonderful, but beyond an artificial
interest which comes mostly from the elders, there is very little lasting delight in them for
children. They belong to the system of over-indulgence and over-stimulation which measures
the value of things by their price. Their worst fault is that they do all there is to be done,
while the child looks on and has nothing to do. The train or motor rushes round and round,
the doll struts about and bleats "papa," "mama," the Teddy-bear growls and dances, and the
owner has but to wind them up, which is very poor amusement. Probably they are better after
they have been over-wound and the mechanical part has given way, and they have come to the
hard use that belongs to their proper position as playthings. If a distinction may be drawn
between toys and playthings, toys are of very little play-value, they stand for fancy play,
to be fiddled with; while playthings stand as symbols of real life, the harder and more primitive
side of life taking the highest rank, and all that they do is really done by the child. This
is the real play-value. Even things that are not playthings at all, sticks and stones and shells,
have this possibility in them. Things which have been found have a history of their own, which
gives them precedence over what comes from a shop; but the highest value of all belongs to
the things which children have made entirely themselves--bows and arrows, catapults, clay marbles,
though imperfectly round, home-made boats and kites. The play-value grows in direct proportion
to the amount of personal share which children have in the making and in the use of their playthings.
And in this we ought cordially to agree with them.

After the nursery age, in the school or school-room, play divides into two lines--organized
games, of which we hear a great deal in school at present, and home play. They are not at all
the same thing. Both have something in their favour. So much has been written of late about
the value of organized games, how they bring out unselfishness, prompt and unquestioning obedience,
playing for one's side and not for oneself, etc., that it seems as if all has been said better
than it could be said again, except perhaps to point out that there is little relaxation in
the battle of life for children who do their best at books indoors and at games out of doors--so
that in self-defence a good many choose an "elective course" between the two lines of advantages
that school offers, and do not attempt to serve two masters; they will do well at books or
games, but not at both. If the interest in games is keen, they require a great deal of will-energy,
as well as physical activity, a great deal of self-control and subordination of personal interest
to the good of the whole. In return for these requirements they give a great deal, this or
that, more or less, according to the character of the game; they give physical control of movement,
quickness of eye and hand, promptitude in decision, observance of right moments, command of
temper, and many other things. In fact, for some games the only adverse criticism to offer
is that they are more of a discipline than real play, and that certainly for younger children
who have no other form of recreation than play, something more restful to the mind and less
definite in purpose is desirable.

For these during playtime some semblance of solitude is exceedingly desirable at school where
the great want is to be sometimes alone. It is good for them not to be always under the pressure
of competition--going along a made road to a definite end--but to have their little moments
of even comparative solitude, little times of silence and complete freedom, if they cannot
be by themselves. Hoops and skipping-ropes without races or counted competitions will give
this, with the possibility of a moment or two to do nothing but live and breathe and rejoice
in air and sunshine. Without these moments of rest the conditions of life at present and the
constitutions for which the new word "nervy" has had to be invented, will give us tempers and
temperaments incapable of repose and solitude. You've spared me the trouble of taking her advice----"

"What
was it?" Margot looked suddenly anxious, and at the same time self-assertive.

"That I should go at once to England--and to you."

Victoria took a step forward, then paused, pale and trembling. "Oh, Stephen!" she cried. "I
take back that advice. I--I've changed my mind. You can't--you can't do it. You would be so
miserable that she'd be wretched, too.

I see now, it's not right to urge people to do things, especially when--one only thinks one
understands. She doesn't love you really. I feel almost sure she cares more for some one else,
if--if it were not for things you have, which she wants. If you're rich, as I suppose you must be,
don't make this sacrifice, which would crush your soul, but give her half of all you have
in the world, so that she can be happy in her own way, and set you free gladly."

As Victoria said these things, she remembered M'Barka, and the prophecy of the sand; a sudden decision
to be made in an instant, which would change her whole life.

"I'll gladly give Miss Lorenzi more than half my money," said Stephen. "I should be happy to
think she had it. But even if you begged me to marry her, Victoria, I would not now. It's gone
beyond that. Her ways and mine must be separate forever."

Margot's face grew eager, and her eyes flamed.

"What I want and insist on," she said, "is that I must have my rights. After all I've hoped
for and expected, I won't be thrown over, and go back to the old, dull life of turning and
twisting every shilling. If you'll settle thirty thousand pounds on me, you are free, so far as I
care. I wouldn't marry a man who hated me, when there's one who adores
me as if I were a saint--and I like him better than ever I did you--a
lot better. I realize that more than I did before."

The suggestion
of Margot Lorenzi as a saint might have made a looker-on smile, but
Victoria and Stephen passed it by, scarcely hearing.

"If I give you
thirty thousand pounds, it will leave me a poor man," he said.

"Oh,
do give her the money and be a poor man," Victoria implored. "I shall
be so happy if we are poor--a thousand times happier than she could
be with millions."

Stephen caught the hand that half unconsciously
the girl held out to him, and pressed it hard. "If you will go back
to your hotel now," he said to Margot, in a quiet voice, "I will call
on you there almost at once, and we can settle our business affairs.
I promise that you shall be satisfied." This word belongs to our
side of the question, not that of the children. It belongs to our side also to see that hoops
are large, and driven with a stick, not a hook, for the sake of straight backs, which are so
easily bent crooked in driving a small hoop with a hook.

In connexion with movement comes the question of dancing. Dancing comes, officially, under
the heading of lessons, most earnest lessons if the professor has profound convictions of its
significance. But dancing belongs afterwards to the playtime of life. We have outlived the
grim puritanical prejudice which condemned it as wrong, and it is generally agreed that there
is almost a natural need for dancing as the expression of something very deep in human nature,
which seems to be demonstrated by its appearance in one form or another, amongst all races
of mankind. There is something in co-ordinated rhythmical movement, in the grace of steps,
in the buoyancy of beautiful dancing which seems to make it a very perfect exercise for children
and young people. But there are dances and dances, steps and steps, and about the really beautiful
there is always a touch of the severe, and a hint of the ideal. Without these, dancing drops
at once to the level of the commonplace and below it. In general, dances which embody some
characteristics of a national life have more beauty than cosmopolitan dances, but they are
only seen in their perfection when performed by dancers of the race to whom their spirit belongs,
or by the class for whom they are intended: which is meant as a suggestion that little girls
should not dance the hornpipe.

In conclusion, the question of play, and playtime and recreation is absorbing more and more
attention in grown-up life. We have heard it said over and over again of late years that we
tire a nation at play, and that "the athletic craze" has gone beyond all bounds. Many facts
are brought forward in support of this criticism from schools, from newspapers, from general
surveys of our national life at present. And those who study more closely the Catholic body
say that we too are sharing in this extreme, and that the Catholic body though small in number
is more responsible and more deserving of reproof if it falls from its ideals, for it has ideals.
It is only Catholic girls who concern us here, but our girls among other girls, and Catholic
women among other women have the privilege as well as the duty of upholding what is highest.
We belong by right to the graver side of the human race, for those who know must be in an emergency
graver, less reckless on the one hand, less panic-stricken on the other, than those who do
not know. We can never be entirely "at play." And if some of us should be for a time carried
away by the current, and momentarily completely "at play," it must be in a wave of reaction
from the long grinding of endurance under the penal times. Cardinal Newman's reminiscences
of the life and ways of "the Roman Catholics" in his youth showy the temper of mind against
which our present excess of play is a reaction.

"A few adherents of the Old Religion, moving silently and sorrowfully about, as memorials of
what had been. 'The Roman Catholics'--not a sect, not even an interest, as men conceived of
it--not a body, however small, representative of the Great Communion abroad, but a mere handful
of individuals, who might be counted, like the pebbles and detritus of the great deluge, and
who, forsooth, merely happened to retain a creed which, in its day indeed, was the profession
of a Church. Here a set of poor Irishmen, coining and going at harvest time, or a colony of
them lodged in a miserable quarter of the vast metropolis. There, perhaps, an elderly person,
seen walking in the streets, grave and solitary, and strange, though noble in bearing, and
said to be of good family, and 'a Roman Catholic.' An old-fashioned house of gloomy appearance,
closed in with high walls, with an iron gate, and yews, and the report attaching to it that
'Roman Catholics' lived there; but who they were, or what they did, or what was meant by calling
them Roman Catholics, no one could tell, though it had an unpleasant sound, and told of form
and superstition. And then, perhaps, as we went to and fro, looking with a boy's curious eyes
through the great city, we might come to-day upon some Moravian chapel, or Quaker's meeting-house,
and to-morrow on a chapel of the 'Roman Catholics': but nothing was to be gathered from it,
except that there were lights burning there, and some boys in white, swinging censers: and
what it all meant could only be learned from books, from Protestant histories and sermons;
but they did not report well of the 'Roman Catholics,' but, on the contrary, deposed that they
had once had power and had abused it. ... Such were the Catholics in England, found in corners,
and alleys, and cellars, and the housetops, or in the recesses of the country; cut off from
the populous world around them, and dimly seen, as if through a mist or in twilight, as ghosts
flitting to and fro, by the high Protestants, the lords of the earth." ("The Second Spring.")

This it is from which we are keeping holiday; but for us it can be only a half holiday, the
sifting process is always at work, the opposition of the world to the Church only sleeps for
a moment, and there are many who tell us that the signs of the times point to new forms of
older conflicts likely to recur, and that we may have to go, as they went on the day of Waterloo,
straight from the dance to the battlefield.

CHAPTER VII.

MATHEMATICS, NATURAL SCIENCE, AND NATURE STUDY.

     "The Arab told me that the stone
(To give it in the language of the dream)
Was "Euclid's Elements"; and "This," said he,
"Is something of more worth"; and at the word
Stretched forth the shell, so beautiful in shape,
In colour so resplendent, with command
That I should hold it to my ear. I did so,
And heard that instant in an unknown tongue,
Which yet I understood, articulate sounds,
A loud prophetic blast of harmony."
              WORDSWORTH, "The Prelude," Bk. V.

Mathematics, natural science, and nature study may be conveniently grouped together, because
in a study of educational aims, in so far as they concern Catholic girls, there is not much
that is distinctive which practically affects these branches; during the years of school life
they stand, more or less, on common ground with others. More advanced studies of natural science
open up burning questions, and as to these, it is the last counsel of wisdom for girls leaving
school or school-room to remember that they have no right to have any opinion at all. It is
well to make them understand that after years of specialized study the really great men of
science, in very gentle tones and with careful utterance, give to the world their formed opinions,
keeping them ever open to readjustment as the results of fresh observations come in year after
year, and new discoveries call for correction and rearrangement of what has been previously
taught. It is also well that they should know that by the time the newest theory reaches the
school-room and textbook it may be already antiquated and perhaps superseded in the observatory
and laboratory, so that in scientific matters the school-room must always be a little "behind
the times."     And likewise that when scientific teaching has to be brought within the compass
of a text-book for young students, it is mere baby talk, as much like the original theory as
a toy engine is like an express locomotive. From which they may conclude that it is wiser to
be listeners or to ask deferential questions than to have light-hearted opinions of their own
on burning questions such as we sometimes hear: "Do you believe in evolution?--I do." "No,
I don't, I think there is very little evidence for it." And that if they are introduced to
a man of science it is better not to ask his opinion about the latest skeleton that has been
discovered, or let him see that they are alarmed lest there might be something wrong with our
pedigree after all, or with the book of Genesis. One would be glad, however, that they should
know the names and something of the works and reputation of the Catholic men of science, as
Ampere, Pasteur, and Wassmann, etc., I Who have been or are European authorities in special
aches of study, so that they may at least be ready with an answer to the frequent assertion
that "Catholics have done nothing for science."

But in connexion with these three subjects, not as to the teaching of them but as to their
place in the education of girls, some points regarding education in general are worth considering:--

1. Mathematics in the curriculum of girls' schools has been the subject of much debate. Cool
and colourless as mathematics are in themselves, they have produced in discussion a good deal
of heat, being put forward to bear the brunt of the controversy as to whether girls were equal
to boys in understanding and capable of following the same course of study, and to enter into
competition with them in all departments of learning. Even taking into consideration many brilliant
achievements and an immense amount of creditable, and even distinguished work, the answer of
those who have no personal bias in the matter for the sake of a Cause--is generally that they
are not. Facts would seem to speak for themselves if only on the ground that the strain of
equal studies is too great for the weaker physical organization. Girls are willing workers,
exceedingly intense when their heart is set upon success; but their staying power is not equal
to their eagerness, and the demands made upon them sometimes leave a mortgage on  their mental
and physical estate which cannot be paid off in the course of a whole lifetime. There was another
path by which Victoria could reach the house. She might have gone, thinking that Stephen knew
best, and that she had no more right than wish to stay, but the tall young woman in grey began
to walk very fast, when she saw that the girl with Stephen was going.

"Be kind enough to stop where you are, Miss Ray. I know you must be Miss Ray," Margot called
out in a loud, sharp voice. She spoke as if Victoria were an inferior, whom she had a right to command.

Surprised
and hurt by the tone, the girl hesitated, looking from the newcomer to Stephen.
At first glance and at a little distance, she had thought the young
woman perfectly beautiful, perhaps the most beautiful creature she
had ever seen--even more glorious than Saidee. There
is more to be gained in recognizing diversities of gifts than in striving to establish a level
of uniformity, and life is richer, not poorer for the setting forth of varied types of excellence.
Competition destroys cooperation, and in striving to prove ability to reach an equal standard
in competition, the wider and more lasting interests which are at stake may be lost sight of,
and in the end sacrificed to limited temporary success.

The success of girls in the field of mathematics is, in general, temporary and limited, it
means much less in their after life than in that of boys. For the few whose calling in life
is teaching, mathematics have some after use; for those, still fewer, who take a real interest
in them, they keep a place in later life; but for the many into whose life-work they do not
enter, beyond the mental discipline which is sometimes evaded, very little remains. The end
of school means for them the end of mathematical study, and the Complete forgetfulness in which
the whole subject is soon buried gives the impression that too much may have been sacrificed
to it. From the point of view of practical value it proves of little use, and as mental discipline
something of more permanent worth might have taken its place to strengthen the reasoning powers.
The mathematical teacher of girls has generally to seek consolation in very rare success for
much habitual disappointment.

The whole controversy about equality in education involves less bitterness to Catholics than
to others, for this reason, that we have less difficulty than those of other persuasions in
accepting a fundamental difference of ideals for girls and boys. Our ideals of family life,
of spheres of action which co-operate and complete each other, without interference or competition,
our masculine and feminine types of holiness amongst canonized saints, give a calmer outlook
upon the questions involved in the discussion. The Church puts equality and inequality upon
such a different footing that the result is harmony without clash of interests, and if in some
countries we are drawn into the arena now, and forced into competition, the very slackness
of interest which is sometimes complained of is an indirect testimony to the truth that we
know of better things. "Yes. I--I'm afraid she's in England now."

"How dreadful! Poor girl, hoping to see you--to have you meet her, maybe, and--you're here. You're
planning to break her heart. It breaks mine to think of it. I couldn't
have you fail."

2. Natural science has of late years assumed a title to which it has no claim, and calls itself
simply "Science"--presumably "for short," but to the great confusion of young minds, or rather
with the effect of contracting their range of vision within very narrow limits, as if theology
and Biblical study, and mental and moral, and historical and political science, had no place
of mention in the rational order where things are studied in their causes.

Inquiry was made in several schools where natural science was taught according to the syllabuses
of the Board of Education. The question was asked, "What is science?"--and without exception
the answers indicated that science was understood to mean the study of the phenomena of the
physical world in their causes. The name "Science" used by itself has been the cause of this,
and has led to the usual consequences of the assumption of unauthorized titles.
