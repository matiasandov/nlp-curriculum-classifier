I attempted to restore one old friend of my father's to the practice of his youth, but failed
though he, unlike my father, had not changed his belief. My father brought me to dine with
Jack Nettleship at Wigmore Street, once inventor of imaginative designs and now a painter of
melodramatic lions. At dinner I had talked a great deal--too much, I imagine, for so young
a man, or may be for any man--and on the way home my father, who had been plainly anxious that
I should make a good impression, was very angry. He said I had talked for effect and that talking
for effect was precisely what one must never do; he had always hated rhetoric and emphasis
and had made me hate it; and his anger plunged me into great dejection. I called at Nettleship's
studio the next day to apologise and Nettleship opened the door himself and received me with
enthusiasm. He had explained to some woman guest that I would probably talk well, being an
Irishman, but the reality had surpassed, etc., etc. I was not flattered, though relieved at
not having to apologise, for I soon discovered that what he really admired was my volubility,
for he himself was very silent. He seemed about sixty, had a bald head, a grey beard, and a
nose, as one of my father's friends used to say, like an opera glass, and sipped cocoa all
the afternoon and evening from an enormous tea cup that must have been designed for him alone,
not caring how cold the cocoa grew. Years before he had been thrown from his horse while hunting
and broken his arm and, because it had been badly set, suffered great pain for along time.
A little whiskey would always stop the pain, and soon a little became a great deal and he found
himself a drunkard, but having signed his liberty away for certain months he was completely
cured. He had acquired, however, the need of some liquid which he could sip constantly. I brought
him an admiration settled in early boyhood, for my father had always said, 'George Wilson was
our born painter but Nettleship our genius,' and even had he shown me nothing I could care
for, I had admired him still because my admiration was in my bones. He showed me his early
designs and they, though often badly drawn, fulfilled my hopes. Something of Blake they certainly
did show, but had in place of Blake's joyous intellectual energy a Saturnian passion and melancholy.
'God creating evil' the death- like head with a woman and a tiger coming from the forehead,
which Rossetti--or was it Browning?--had described 'as the most sublime design of ancient or
modern art' had been lost, but there was another version of the same thought and other designs
never published or exhibited. They rise before me even now in meditation, especially a blind
Titan-like ghost floating with groping hands above the treetops. I wrote a criticism, and arranged
for reproductions with the editor of an art magazine, but after it was written and accepted
the proprietor, lifting what I considered an obsequious caw in the Huxley, Tyndall, Carolus
Duran, Bastien-Lepage rookery, insisted upon its rejection. Nettleship did not mind its rejection,
saying, 'Who cares for such things now? Not ten people,' but he did mind my refusal to show
him what I had written. Though what I had written was all eulogy, I dreaded his judgment for
it was my first art criticism. I hated his big lion pictures, where he attempted an art too
much concerned with the sense of touch, with the softness or roughness, the minutely observed
irregularity of surfaces, for his genius; and I think he knew it. 'Rossetti used to call my
pictures 'pot- boilers,' he said, 'but they are all--all,' and he waved his arms to the canvases,
'symbols.' When I wanted him to design gods and angels and lost spirits once more, he always
came back to the point, 'Nobody would be pleased.' 'Everybody should have a raison d'etre'
was one of his phrases.
