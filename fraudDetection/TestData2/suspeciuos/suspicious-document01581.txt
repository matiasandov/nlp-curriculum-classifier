On Christmas morning Graham found his breakfast-plate pushed back, and in its place lay a superb
sword and belt, fashioned much like the one he had lost in the rescue of his friend. With it
was a genial letter from Hilland, and a little note from Grace, which only said:

"You will find my name engraved upon the sword with Warren's. We have added nothing else, for
the good reason that our names mean everything--more than could be expressed, were the whole
blade covered with symbols, each meaning a volume. You have taught us how you will use the
weapon, my truest and best of friends. GRACE HILLAND."

His eyes lingered on the name so long that his aunt asked: "Why don't you look at your gift?"

He slowly drew the long, keen, shining blade, and saw again the name "Grace Hilland," and for
a time he saw nothing else. Suddenly he turned the sword and on the opposite side was "Warren
Hilland," and he shook his head sadly.

"Alford, what is the matter?" his aunt asked impatiently.

"Why didn't they have their names engraved together?" he muttered slowly, "It's a bad omen.
See, a sword is between their names. I wish they had been together. Oh, I wish Hilland could
be kept out of the field!"

"There it is, Alford," began his aunt, irritably; "you men who don't believe anything are always
the victims of superstition. Bad omen, indeed!"

"Well, I suppose I am a fool; but a strange chill at heart struck me for which I can't account;"
and he sprang up and paced the floor uneasily. "Well," he continued, "I would bury it in my
own heart rather than cause her one hour's sorrow, but I wish their names had been together."
Then he took it up again and said: "Beautiful as it is, it may have to do some stern work,
Grace--work far remote from your nature. All I ask is that it may come between Hilland and
danger again. I wish I had not had that strange, cursed presentiment"

"Oh, Alford! I never saw you in such a mood, and on Christmas morning, too!"

"That is just what I don't like about it--it's not my habit to indulge such fancies, to say
the least. Come what may, however, I dedicate the sword to her service without counting any
cost;" and he kissed her name, and laid the weapon reverently aside.

"You are morbid this morning. Go to the door and see my present to you. You will find no bad
omens on his shining coat."

Graham felt that it was weak to entertain such impressions as had mastered him, and hastened
out. There, pawing the frozen ground, was a horse that satisfied even his fastidious eye. There
was not a white hair in the coal-black coat. In his enthusiasm he forgot his hat, and led the
beautiful creature up and down, observing with exultation his perfect action, clean-cut limbs,
and deep, broad chest. 

The interior of the fortress formed a striking contrast to the scenes
which I had just left behind me.

All was still stern, and noiseless.

"Give me your papers," said Mendoza; "they will be safer in my hands
than in yours."

"This horse is breakfast and dinner both," he shouted, as he galloped down the path.

Then, to the old lady's horror, he dashed through the trees and shrubbery, took a picket-fence
in a flying leap, and circled round the house till Mrs. Mayburn's head was dizzy. Then she
saw him coming toward the door as if he would ride through the house; but the horse stopped
almost instantly, and Graham was on his feet, handing the bridle to the gaping groom.

"Take good care of him," he said to the man, "for he is a jewel."

"Alford," exclaimed his aunt, "could you make no better return for my gift than to frighten
me out of my wits?"

"Dear aunty, you are too well supplied ever to lose them for so slight a cause. I wanted to
show the perfection of your gift, and how well it may serve me. You don't imagine that our
cavalry evolutions are all performed on straight turnpike roads, do you? Now you know that
you have given me an animal that can carry me wherever a horse can go, and so have added much
to my chances of safety. I can skim out of a melee like a bird with Mayburn--for that shall
be his name--where a blundering, stupid horse would break my neck, if I wasn't shot. I saw
at once from his action what he could do. Where on earth did you get such a creature?"

"Well," said the old lady, beaming with triumphant happiness, "I have had agents on the lookout
a long time. The man of whom you had your first horse, then called Firebrand, found him; and
he knew well that he could not impose any inferior animal upon you. Are you really sincere
in saying that such a horse as this adds to your chances of safety?"

"Certainly. That's what I was trying to show you. Did you not see how he would wind in and
out among the trees and shrubbery--how he would take a fence lightly without any floundering?
There is just as much difference among horses as among men. Some are simply awkward, heavy,
and stupid; others are vicious; more are good at times and under ordinary circumstances, but
fail you at a pinch. This horse is thoroughbred and well broken. You must have paid a small
fortune for him."

"I never invested money that satisfied me better."

"It's like you to say so. Well, take the full comfort of thinking how much you have added to
my comfort and prospective well-being. That gallop has already done me a world of good, and
given me an appetite. I'll have another turn across the country after breakfast, and throw
all evil presentiments to the winds."

"Why, now you talk sense. When you are in any more such moods as this morning I shall prescribe
horse."

Before New Year's day Graham had installed his aunt comfortably in rooms adjoining the Hillands',
and had thanked his friends for their gift in a way that proved it to be appreciated. Mrs.
Mayburn had been cautioned never to speak of what he now regarded as a foolish and unaccountable
presentiment, arising, perhaps, from a certain degree of morbidness of mind in all that related
to Grace. Iss was on hand to act as groom, and Graham rode out with Hilland and Grace several
times before his leave expired. Even at that day, when the city was full of gallant men and
fair women, many turned to look as the three passed down the avenue.

Never had Grace looked so radiantly beautiful as when in the brilliant sunshine of a Washington
winter and in the frosty air she galloped over the smooth, hard roads. Hilland was proud of
the almost wondering looks of admiration that everywhere greeted her, and too much in love
to note that the ladies they met looked at him in much the same way. The best that was said
of Graham was that he looked a soldier, every inch of him, and that he rode the finest horse
in the city as if be had been brought up in a saddle. He was regarded by society as reserved,
unsocial, and proud; and at two or three receptions, to which he went because of the solicitation
of his friends, he piqued the vanity of more than one handsome woman by his courteous indifference.

"What is the matter with your husband's friend?" a reigning belle asked Grace. "One might as
well try to make an impression on a paving- stone."

"I think your illustration unhappy," was her quiet reply. "I cannot imagine Mr. Graham at any
one's feet."

"Not even your own?" was the malicious retort.

"Not even my own," and a flash of anger from her dark eyes accompanied her answer.

Still, wherever he went he awakened interest in all natures not dull or sodden. He was felt
to be a presence. There was a consciousness of power in his very attitudes; and one felt instinctively
that he was far removed from the commonplace--that he had had a history which made him different
from other men.

But before this slight curiosity was kindled to any extent, much less satisfied, his leave
of absence expired; and with a sense of deep relief he prepared to say farewell. His friends
expected to see him often in the city; he knew they would see him but seldom, if at all. He
bad made his visit with his aunt, and she understood him. His quiet poise was departing, and
he longed for the stern, fierce excitement of active service.

Before he joined his regiment he spent the day with his friends, and took occasion once, when
alone with Hilland, to make an appeal that was solemn and almost passionate in its earnestness,
adjuring him to remain employed in duties like those which now occupied him. But he saw that
his efforts were vain.

"No, Graham," was Hilland's emphatic reply; "just as soon as there is danger at the front I
shall be with my regiment Now I can do more here."

With Grace he took a short ride in the morning while Hilland was engaged in his duties, and
he looked at the fair woman by his side with the thought that he might never see her again.
It almost seemed as if Grace understood him, for although the rich color mantled in her cheeks
and she abounded in smile and repartee, a look of deep sadness rarely left her eyes.

Once she said abruptly, "Alford, you will come and see us often before the campaign opens?
Oh, I dread this coming campaign. You will come often?"

"I fear not, Grace," he said, gravely and gently, "I will try to come, but not often." Then
he added, with a short, abrupt laugh, "I wish I could break Hilland's leg." In answer to a
look of surprise he continued, "Could not your father procure an order that would keep him
in the city? He would have to obey orders."

"Ah, I understand you," and there was a quick rush of tears to her eyes. "It's of no use. I
have thought of everything, but Warren's heart is set on joining his regiment in the spring."

"I know it. I have said all that I could say to a brother on the subject."

"From the first, Alford, you have tried to make the ordeal of this war less painful to me,
and how well you have succeeded! You have been our good genius. Warren, in his impetuous, chivalrous
feeling, would have gone into it unadvisedly, hastily; and before this might--Oh, I can't even
think of it," she said with a shudder. "But years have passed since your influence guided him
into a wiser and more useful course, and think how much of the time I have been able to be
with him! And it has all been due to you, Alford. But the war seems no nearer its end. It rather
assumes a larger and more threatening aspect Why do not men think of us poor women before they
go to war?"

"You think, then, that even your influence cannot keep him from the field?"

"No, it could not. Indeed, beyond a certain point I dare not exert it. I should be dumb before
questions already asked, 'Why should I shrink when other husbands do not? What would be said
of me here? what by my comrades in the regiment? What would your brave father think, though
he might acquiesce? "Bob Rock! or whatever your name may be, if you have aught to say, say it!"
continued the judge.

"Said it all yesterday," muttered Bob, his face still covered by his hands.

"Yes, but you must say it again to-day. Yesterday was Sunday, and Sunday is a day of rest, and not
of business. I will neither judge you, nor allow you to be judged,
by what you said yesterday. Besides, it was all between ourselves,
for I don't reckon Mr Rivers as any thing; I count him still as a
stranger."

"No, Grace; I've sworn that on the sword you gave me."

"I might have known as much." Then she added earnestly, "Believe me, if you should fall it
would also imbitter my life."

"Yes, you would grieve sincerely; but there would be an infinite difference, an infinite difference.
One question, however, is settled beyond recall. If my life can serve you or Hilland, no power
shall prevent my giving it. There is nothing more to be said: let us speak of something else."

"Yes, Alford, one thing more. Once I misjudged you. Forgive me;" and she caused her horse to
spring into a gallop, resolving that no commonplace words should follow closely upon a conversation
that had touched the most sacred feelings and impulses of each heart.

For some reason there was a shadow over their parting early in the evening, for Graham was
to ride toward the front with the dawn. Even Hilland's genial spirits could not wholly dissipate
it. Graham made heroic efforts, but he was oppressed with a despondency which was wellnigh
overwhelming. He felt that he was becoming unmanned, and in bitter self-censure resolved to
remain with his regiment until the end came, as he believed would be the case with him before
the year closed.

"Alford, remember your promise. We all may need you yet," were his aunt's last words in the
gray of the morning.

CHAPTER XXVI

AN IMPROVISED PICTURE GALLERY

Much to Graham's satisfaction, his regiment, soon after he joined it, was ordered into the
Shenandoah Valley, and given some rough, dangerous picket duty that fully accorded with his
mood. Even Hilland could not expect a visit from him now; and he explained to his friend that
the other officers were taking their leaves of absence, and he, in turn, must perform their
duties. And so the winter passed uneventfully away in a cheerful interchange of letters. Graham
found that the front agreed with him better than Washington, and that his pulse resumed its
former even beat A dash at a Confederate picket post on a stormy night was far more tranquilizing
than an evening in Hilland's luxurious rooms.

With the opening of the spring campaign Hilland joined his regiment, and was eager to remove
by his courage and activity the slightest impression, if any existed, that he was disposed
to shun dangerous service. There was no such impression, however; and he was most cordially
welcomed, for he was a great favorite with both officers and men.

During the weeks that followed, the cavalry was called upon to do heavy work and severe fighting;
and the two friends became more conspicuous than ever for their gallantry. They seemed, however,
to bear charmed lives, for, while many fell or were wounded, they escaped unharmed,

At last the terrific and decisive campaign of Gettysburg opened; and from the war-wasted and
guerilla-infested regions of Virginia the Northern troops found themselves marching through
the friendly and populous North. As the cavalry brigade entered a thriving village in Pennsylvania
the people turned out almost en masse and gave them more than an ovation. The troopers were
tired, hungry, and thirsty; and, since from every doorway was offered a boundless hospitality,
the column came to a halt. The scene soon developed into a picturesque military picnic. Young
maids and venerable matrons, gray-bearded fathers, shy, blushing girls, and eager-eyed children,
all vied with each other in pressing upon their defenders every delicacy and substantial viand
that their town could furnish at the moment. A pretty miss of sixteen, with a peach-like bloom
in her cheeks, might be seen flitting here and there among the bearded troopers with a tray
bearing goblets of milk. When they were emptied she would fly back and lift up white arms to
her mother for more, and the almost equally blooming matron, smiling from the window, would
fill the glasses again to the brim. The magnates of the village with their wives were foremost
in the work, and were passing to and fro with great baskets of sandwiches, while stalwart men
and boys were bringing from neighboring wells and pumps cool, delicious water for the horses.
How immensely the troopers enjoyed it all! No scowling faces and cold looks here. All up and
down the street, holding bridle- reins over their arms or leaning against the flanks of their
horses, they feasted as they had not done since their last Thanksgiving Day at home. Such generous
cups of coffee, enriched with cream almost too thick to flow from the capacious pitchers, and
sweetened not only with snow-white sugar, but also with the smiles of some gracious woman,
perhaps motherly in appearance, perhaps so fair and young that hearts beat faster under the
weather-stained cavalry jackets.

"How pretty it all is!" said a familiar voice to Graham, as he was dividing a huge piece of
cake with his pet Mayburn; and Hilland laid his hand on his friend's shoulder,

"Ah, Hilland, seeing you is the best part of this banquet a la militaire. Yes, it is a heavenly
change after the dreary land we've been marching and fighting in. It makes me feel that I have
a country, and that it's worth all it may cost."

"Look, Graham--look at that little fairy creature in white muslin, talking to that great bearded
pard of a sergeant. Isn't that a picture? Oh, I wish Grace, with her eye for picturesque effects,
could look upon this scene."

"Nonsense, Hilland! as if she would look at anybody or anything but you! See that white-haired
old woman leading that exquisite little girl to yonder group of soldiers. See how they doff
their hats to her. There's another picture for you."

Hilland's magnificent appearance soon attracted half a dozen village belles about him, each
offering some dainty; and one--a black-eyed witch a little bolder than the others--offered
to fasten a rose from her hair in his button-hole.

He entered into the spirit of the occasion with all the zest of his old student days, professed
to be delighted with the favor as she stood on tiptoe to reach the lappet of his coat; and
then he stooped down and pressed his lips to the fragrant petals, assuring the blushing little
coquette, meanwhile, that it was the next best thing to her own red lips.

How vividly in after years Graham would recall him, as he stood there, his handsome head thrown
back, looking the ideal of an old Norse viking, laughing and chatting with the merry, innocent
girls around him, his deep-blue eyes emitting mirthful gleams on every side! According to his
nature, Graham drew off to one side and watched the scene with a smile, as he had viewed similar
ones far back in the years, and far away in Germany. He saw the ripples of laughter that his
friend's words provoked, and recognized the old, easy grace, the light, French-like wit, that
was wholly free from the French double entendre, and he thought: "Would that Grace could see
him now, and she would fall in love with him anew, for her nature is too large for petty jealousy
at a scene like that Oh, Hilland! you and the group around you make the finest picture of this
long improvised gallery of pictures."

Suddenly there was a loud report of a cannon from a hill above the village, and a shell shrieked
over their heads. Hilland's laughing aspect changed instantly. He seemed almost to gather the
young girls in his arms as he hurried them into the nearest doorway, and then with a bound
reached Graham, who held his horse, vaulted into the saddle, and dashed up the street to his
men who were standing in line.

Graham sprang lightly on his horse, for in the scenes resulting from the kaleidoscopic change
that had taken place he would be more at home.

"Mount!" he shouted; and the order, repeated up and down the street, changed the jolly, feasting
troopers of a moment since into veterans who would sit like equestrian statues, if so commanded,
though a hundred guns thundered against them.

From the further end of the village came the wild yell characteristic of the cavalry charges
of the Confederates, while shell after shell shrieked and exploded where had just been unaffected
gayety and hospitality.

The first shot had cleared the street of all except the Union soldiers; and those who dared
to peep from window or door saw, with dismay, that the defenders whom they had so honored and
welcomed were retreating at a gallop from the Rebel charge.

They were soon undeceived, however, for at a gallop the national cavalry dashed into an open
field near by, formed with the precision of machinery, and by the time that the Rebel charge
had wellnigh spent itself in the sabring or capture of a few tardy troopers, Hilland with platoon
after platoon was emerging upon the street again at a sharp trot, which soon developed into
a furious gallop as he dashed against their assailants; and the pretty little coquette, bold
not only in love but in war, saw from a window her ideal knight with her red rose upon his
breast leading a charge whose thunder caused the very earth to tremble; and she clapped her
hands and cheered so loudly as he approached that he looked up, saw her, and for an instant
a sunny smile passed over the visage that had become so stern. Then came the shock of battle.

Graham's company was held in reserve, but for some reason his horse seemed to grow unmanageable;
and sabres had scarcely clashed before he, with the blade on which was engraved "Grace Hilland,"
was at her husband's side, striking blows which none could resist. The enemy could not stand
the furious onset, and gave way slowly, sullenly, and at last precipitately. The tide of battle
swept beyond and away from the village; and its street became quiet again, except for the groans
of the wounded.

Mangled horses, mangled men, some dead, some dying, and others almost rejoicing in wounds that
would secure for them such gentle nurses, strewed the streets that had been the scene of merry
festivity.

The pretty little belle never saw her tawny, bearded knight again. She undoubtedly married
and tormented some well-to-do dry-goods clerk; but a vision of a man of heroic mold, with a
red rose upon his breast, smiling up to her just as he was about to face what might be death,
will thrill her feminine soul until she is old and gray.

That night Graham and Hilland talked and laughed over the whole affair as they sat by a camp-fire.

"It has all turned out as usual," said Graham, ruefully. "You won a victory and no end of glory;
I a reprimand from my colonel."

"If you have received nothing worse than a reprimand you are fortunate," was Hilland's response. "Well,"
said the judge, who did not look over well pleased; "if you all think so, and Bob is agreed,
I calculate we must do as he wishes. I tell you, though, I don't do it willingly. At any rate we must find
the dead man first, and examine Johnny. You were
fearfully rash to-day, Graham. You were not content to fight at my side, but more than once
were between me and the enemy. What the devil makes you so headlong in a fight--you that are
usually so cool and self- controlled?"

Graham's hand rested on a fair woman's name engraved upon his sword, but he replied lightly:
"When you teach me caution in a fight I'll learn."

"Well, excuse me, old fellow, I'm going to write to Grace. May not have a chance very soon
again. I say, Graham, we'll have the battle of the war in a day or two."

"I know it," was the quiet response.

"And we must win, too," Hilland continued, "or the Johnnies will help themselves to Washington,
Baltimore, Philadelphia, and perhaps New York. Every man should nerve himself to do the work
of two. As I was saying, I shall write to Grace that your horse ran away with you and became
uncontrollable until you were directly in front of me, when you seemed to manage him admirably,
and struck blows worthy of the old French duellist who killed a man every morning before breakfast.
I think she'll understand your sudden and amazingly poor horsemanship as well as I do."

She did, and far better.

Hilland's prediction proved true. The decisive battle of Gettysburg was fought, and its bloody
field marked the highest point reached by the crimson tide of the Rebellion. From Cemetery
Ridge it ebbed slowly and sullenly away to the south.

The brigade in which were the friends passed through another fearful baptism of fire in the
main conflict and the pursuit which followed, and were in Virginia again, but with ranks almost
decimated. Graham and Hilland still seemed to bear charmed lives, and in the brief pause in
operations that followed, wrote cheerful letters to those so dear, now again at their seaside
resort. Grace, who for days had been so pale, and in whose dark eyes lurked an ever-present
dread of which she could not speak, smiled again. Her husband wrote in exuberant spirits over
the victory, and signed himself "Lieutenant-Colonel." Graham in his letter said jestingly to
his aunt that he had at last attained his "majority," and that she might therefore look for
a little more discretion on his part.

"How the boys are coming on!" exulted the old major. "They will both wear the stars yet. But
confound it all, why did Meade let Lee escape? He might have finished the whole thing up."

Alas! the immeasurable price of liberty was not yet paid.

One morning Hilland's and Graham's regiments were ordered out on what was deemed but a minor
reconnoissance; and the friends, rested and strong, started in high spirits with their sadly
shrunken forces. But they knew that the remaining handfuls were worth more than full ranks
of untrained, unseasoned men. All grow callous, if not indifferent, to the vicissitudes of
war; and while they missed regretfully many familiar faces, the thought that they had rendered
the enemy's lines more meagre was consoling.

Graham and Hilland rode much of the long day together. They went over all the past, and dwelt
upon the fact that their lives had been so different from what they had planned.

"By the way, Graham," said Hilland, abruptly, "it seems strange to me that you are so indifferent
to women. Don't you expect ever to marry?"

Graham burst into a laugh as he replied: "I thought we had that subject out years ago, under
the apple-tree--that night, you remember, when you talked like a schoolgirl till morning--"

"And you analyzed and philosophized till long after midnight--"

"Well, you knew then that Grace had spoiled me for every one else; and she's been improving
ever since. When I find her equal I'll marry her, if I can."

"Poor, forlorn old bachelor that you are, and ever will be!" cried Hilland. "You'll never find
the equal of Grace Hilland."

"I think I shall survive, Hilland. My appetite is good. As I live, there are some Confederates
in yonder clump of trees;" and he put spurs to his horse on a little private reconnoissance.
The few horsemen vanished, in the thick woods beyond, the moment they saw that they were perceived;
and they were regarded as prowling guerillas only.

That night they bivouacked in a grove where two roads intersected, threw out pickets and patrols,
and kindled their fires, for they did not expect to strike the enemy in force till some time
on the following day.

CHAPTER XXVII

A DREAM

Graham and his friend had bidden each other an early and cordial good- night, for the entire
force under the command of Hilland's colonel was to resume its march with the dawn. Although
no immediate danger was apprehended, caution had been learned by long experience. The detachment
was comparatively small, and it was far removed from any support; and while no hints of the
presence of the enemy in formidable numbers had been obtained during the day, what was beyond
them could not be known with any certainty. Therefore the horses had been carefully rubbed
down, and the saddles replaced. In many instances the bridles also had been put on again, with
the bit merely slipped from the mouth. In all cases they lay or hung within reach of the tired
troopers, who, one after another, were dropping off into the catlike slumber of a cavalry outpost.

As the fires died down, the shadows in the grove grew deeper and more obscure, and all was
quiet, except when the hours came round for the relief of pickets and the men who were patrolling
the roads. Graham remembered the evanescent group of Confederates toward whom he had spurred
during the day. He knew that they were in a hostile region, and that their movements must be
already well known to the enemy if strong in their vicinity. Therefore all his instincts as
a soldier were on the alert. It so happened that he was second in command of his regiment on
this occasion, and he felt the responsibility. He had been his own groom on their arrival at
the grove, and his faithful charger, Mayburn, now stood saddled and bridled by his side, as
he reclined, half dozing, again thinking deeply, by the low, flickering blaze of his fire.
He had almost wholly lost the gloomy presentiments that had oppressed him at the beginning
of the year. Both he and Hilland had passed through so many dangers that a sense of security
was begotten. Still more potent had been the influence of his active out-of-door life. His
nerves were braced, while his soldier's routine and the strong excitement of the campaign had
become a preoccupying habit.

Only those who brood in idleness over the misfortunes and disappointments of life are destroyed
by them. 

Even Parliament, except to a few of the leaders, is no distinction. The member for the shire is
clipped of all his plumage at the moment of his entering that colossal poultry-yard, and must
take his obscure pickings with other unnoticeable fowl. The wisdom of this remoteness became more
and more clear to him; for despite every power that he could put forth as a man, there was
a deeper, stronger manhood within him which acknowledged this woman as sovereign. He foresaw
that his lot would be one of comparative exile, and he accepted it with a calm and inflexible
resolution.

Hearing a step he started up hastily, and saw Hilland approaching from the opposite side of
his fire.

"Ah, Graham, glad you are not asleep," said his friend, throwing himself down on the leaves,
with his head resting on his hands. "Put a little wood on the fire, please; I'm chilly in the
night air, and the dews are so confoundedly heavy."

"Why, Hilland, what's the matter?" Graham asked, as he complied. "You are an ideal cavalryman
at a nap, and can sleep soundly with one eye open. It has seemed to me that you never lost
a wink when there was a chance for it, even under fire."

"Why are you not sleeping?"

"Oh, I have been, after my fashion, dozing and thinking by turns. I always was an owl, you
know. Moreover, I think it behooves us to be on the alert. We are a good way from support if
hard pressed; and the enemy must be in force somewhere to the west of us."

"I've thought as much myself. My horse is ready, as yours is, and I left an orderly holding
him. I suppose you will laugh at me, but I've had a cursed dream; and it has shaken me in spite
of my reason. After all, how often our reason fails us at a pinch! I wish it was morning and
we were on the road. I've half a mind to go out with the patrols and get my blood in circulation.
I would were it not that I feel I should be with my men."

"Where's your colonel?"

"The old war-dog is sleeping like a top. Nothing ever disturbs him, much less a dream. I say,
Graham, I made a good selection in him, didn't I?"

"Yes, but he'll be promoted soon, and you will be in command. What's more, I expect to see
a star on your shoulder in less than six months."

"As I feel to-night, I don't care a picayune for stars or anything else relating to the cursed
war. I'd give my fortune to be able to kiss Grace and tell her I'm well."

"You are morbid, Hilland. You will feel differently to-morrow, especially if there's a chance
for a charge."

"No doubt, no doubt. The shadow of this confounded grove seems as black as death, and it oppresses
me. Why should I, without apparent cause, have had such a dream?"

"Your supper and fatigue may have been the cause. If you don't mind, tell me this grisly vision."

"While you laugh at me as an old woman--you, in whom reason ever sits serene and dispassionate
on her throne, except when you get into a fight."

"My reason's throne is often as rickety as a two-legged stool. No, I won't laugh at you. There's
not a braver man in the service than you. If you feel as you say, there's some cause for it;
and yet so complex is our organism that both cause and effect may not be worthy of very grave
consideration, as I have hinted."

"Think what you please, this was my dream. I had made my dispositions for the night, and went
to sleep as a matter of course. I had not slept an hour by my watch--I looked at it afterward--when
I seemed to hear some one moaning and crying, and I thought I started up wide awake, and I
saw the old library at home--the room you know so well. Every article of furniture was before
me more distinctly than I can see any object now, and on the rug before the open fire Grace
was crouching, while she moaned and wrung her hands and cried as if her heart was breaking.
She was dressed in black--Oh, how white her hands and neck and face appeared against that mournful
black--and, strangest of all, her hair fell around her snowy white, like a silver veil. I started
forward to clasp her in my arms, and then truly awoke, for there was nothing before me but
my drooping horse, a few red coals of my expiring fire, and over all the black, black shadow
of this accursed grove. Oh, for sunlight! Oh, for a gale of wind, that I might breathe freely
again!" and the powerful man sprang to his feet and threw open his coat at his breast.

As he ceased speaking, the silence and darkness of the grove did seem ominous and oppressive,
and Graham's old wretched presentiment of Christmas morning returned, but he strove with all
the ingenuity in his power to reason his friend out of his morbid mood, as he termed it. He
kindled his fire into a cheerful blaze, and Hilland cowered and shivered over it; then looking
up abruptly, he said, "Graham, you and I accepted the belief long ago that man was only highly
organized matter. I must admit to you that my mind has often revolted at this belief; and the
thought that Grace was merely of the earth has always seemed to me sacrilegious. She never
was what you would call a religious girl; but she once had a quiet, simple faith in a God and
a hereafter, and she expected to see her mother again. I fear that our views have troubled
her exceedingly; although with that rare reserve in a woman, she never interfered with one's
strong personal convictions. The shallow woman tries to set everybody right with the weighty
reason, 'Oh, because it IS so; all good people say it is so.' I fear our views have unsettled
hers also. I wish they had not; indeed I wish I could believe somewhat as she did.

"Once, only once, she spoke to me with a strange bitterness, but it revealed the workings of
her mind. I, perhaps, was showing a little too much eagerness in my spirit and preparation
for active service, and she broke out abruptly, 'Oh, yes, you and Alford can rush into scenes
of carnage very complacently. You believe that if the bullet is only sure enough, your troubles
are over forever, as Alford once said. I suppose you are right, for you learned men have studied
into things as we poor women never can. If it's true, those who love as we do should die together.'
It has often seemed that her very love--nay, that mine--was an argument against our belief.
That a feeling so pure, vivid, and unselfish, so devoid of mere earthiness--a feeling that
apparently contains within itself the very essence of immortality--can be instantly blotted
out as a flame is extinguished, has become a terrible thought. Grace Hilland is worthy of an
immortal life, and she has all the capacity for it. It's not her lovely form and face that
I love so much as the lovely something--call it soul, spirit, or what you choose--that will
maintain her charm through all the changes from youth to feeble and withered age. How can I
be sure that the same gentle, womanly spirit may not exist after the final change we call death,
and that to those worthy of immortal life the boon is not given? Reason is a grand thing, and
I know we once thought we settled this question; but reason fails me to-night, or else love
and the intense longings of the heart teach a truer and deeper philosophy--

"You are silent, Graham. You think me morbid--that wishes are fathers of my thoughts. Well,
I'm not. I honestly don't know what the truth is. I only wish to-night that I had the simple
belief in a reunion with Grace which she had with regard to her mother. I fear we have unsettled
her faith; not that we ever urged our views--indeed we have scarcely ever spoken of them--but
there has been before her the ever- present and silent force of example. It was natural for
her to believe that those were right in whom she most believed; and I'm not sure we are right--I'm
not sure. I've not been sure for a long time."

"My dear Warren, you are not well. Exposure to all sorts of weather in this malarial country
is telling on you; and I fear your feelings to- night are the prelude of a fever. You shall
stay and sleep by my fire, and if I hear the slightest suspicious sound I will waken you. You
need not hesitate, for I intend to watch till morning, whether you stay or not."

"Well, Graham, I will. I wish to get through this horrible night in the quickest way possible.
But I'll first go and bring my horse here, so the poor orderly can have a nap."

He soon returned and lay down close to the genial fire, and Graham threw over him his own blankets. 

The judge himself looked very pale. I tried to rise, but sank back in my chair. Without the table
I believe I should have fallen to the ground.
There was a gloomy pause of some moments' duration. At last the judge
broke silence.

"A hard, hard case!" said he. In my blind confidence, I should have rushed into the war, and probably should have been
knocked on the head at Bull Run. How many happy months I've passed with Grace since then!--how
many since you virtually gave your life for me last autumn! You made sure that I took a man's,
not a fool's, part in the war. Oh, Grace and I know it all and appreciate it; and--and--Alford,
if I should fall, I commend Grace to your care."

"Hilland, stop, or you will unman me. This accursed grove is haunted, I half believe; and were
I in command I would order 'Boots and Saddles' to be sounded at once. There, sleep, Warren,
and in the morning you will be your own grand self. Why speak of anything I could do for you
and Grace? How could I serve myself in any surer way? As schoolgirls say, 'I won't speak to
you again.' I'm going to prowl around a little, and see that all is right;" and he disappeared
among the shadowy boles of the trees.

When he returned from his rounds his friend was sleeping, but uneasily, with sudden fits and
starts.
