WOODLAND TALES

        WOODLAND TALES

        THE AUTHOR

        AUTHOR OF "WILD ANIMALS AT HOME," "WILD
        ANIMALS I HAVE KNOWN," "TWO LITTLE SAVAGES,"
        "BIOGRAPHY OF A GRIZZLY," "LIFE
        HISTORIES OF NORTHERN ANIMALS," "ROLF IN
        THE WOODS," "THE BOOK OF WOODCRAFT." It might almost be said that
they were written chiefly for myself, for I not only have had the
pleasure of telling them to the little ones, and enjoying their quick
response, but have also had the greater pleasure of thinking them and
setting them down.

As I write, I look from a loved window, across a landscape that I love, and my eye rests on
a tall beautiful pine planted with my own hands years ago. It is a mass of green fringes, with
gem-like tips of buds and baby cones, beautiful, exquisitely beautiful, whether seen from afar
as a green spire, or viewed close at hand as jewellery. It is beautiful, fragile and--unimportant,
as the world sees it; yet through its wind-waved mass one can get little glimpses of the thing
that backs it all, the storm-defying shaft, the enduring rigid living growing trunk of massive
timber that gives it the nobility of strength, and adds value to the rest; sometimes it must
be sought for, but it always surely is there, ennobling the lesser pretty things.

I hope this tree is a fair image of my fairy tale. I know my child friends will love the piney
fringes and the jewel cones, and they can find the unyielding timber in its underlying truth,
if they seek for it. If they do not, it is enough to have them love the cones.

All are not fairy tales. Other chapters set forth things to see, thing to do, things to go
to, things to know, things to remember. These, sanctified in the blue outdoors, spell "Woodcraft,"
the one pursuit of man that never dies or palls, the thing that in the bygone ages gifted him
and yet again will gift him with the seeing eye, the thinking hand, the body that fails not,
the winged soul that stores up precious memories.

It is hoped that these chapters will show how easy and alluring, and how good a thing it is.

While they are meant for the children six years of age and upward, it is assumed that Mother
(or Father) will be active as a leader; therefore it is addressed, first of all, to the parent,
whom throughout we shall call the "Guide."

Some of these stories date back to my school days, although the first actually published was
"Why the Chicadee Goes Crazy Twice a Year." This in its original form appeared in "Our Animal
Friends" in September, 1893. Others, as "The Fingerboard Goldenrod," "Brook-Brownie," "The
Bluebird," "Diablo and the Dogwood," "How the Violets Came," "How the Indian Summer Came,"
"The Twin Stars," "The Fairy Lamps," "How the Littlest Owl Came," "How the Shad Came," appeared
in slightly different form in the Century Magazine, 1903 and 1904.

My thanks are due to the Authorities of the American Museum who have helped me with specimens
and criticism; to the published writings of Dr. W. J. Holland and Clarence M. Weed for guidance
in insect problems; to Britton and Browne's "Illustrated Flora, U. S. and Canada"; and to the
Nature Library of Doubleday, Page & Co., for light in matters botanic; to Mrs. Daphne Drake
and Mrs. Mary S. Dominick for many valuable suggestions, and to my wife, Grace Gallatin Seton,
for help with the purely literary work.

Also to Oliver P. Medsger, the naturalist of Lincoln High School, Jersey City, N. J., for reading
with critical care those parts of the manuscript that deal with flowers and insects, as well
as for the ballad of the Ox-eye, the story of its coming to America, and the photograph of
the Mecha-meck.

INTRODUCTION

Mother Carey

All-mother! Mater Cara! I have never seen you, but I hungered so to know you that I understood
it when you came, unseen, and silently whispered to me that first time in the long ago.

I cannot tell the children what you look like, Mother Carey, for mortal eye hath never rested
on your face; and yet I can offer them a portrait, O strong Angel of the Wild Things, neither
young nor old--Oh! loving One that neither trembles nor relents!

       *       *       *       *       *

A mink he was, a young mink and foolish. One of a happy brood, who were seeing the world with
their mother--a first glimpse of it. She was anxious and leading, happy and proud, warning,
sniffing, inviting, loving, yet angersome at trivial disobedience, doling out her wisdom in
nips and examples and shrill warnings that all heeded; except this one, the clever fool of
the family, the self-satisfied smart one. He would not be warned, the thing smelt so good.
He plunged ahead. Mother was a fool; he was wiser than Mother. Here was a merry feasting for
him. Then clank! The iron jaws of a trap sprang from the hiding grass, and clutched on his
soft young paws. Screams of pain, futile strainings, writhings, ragings and moanings; bloody
jaws on the trap; the mother distraught with grief, eager to take all the punishment herself,
but helpless and stunned, unable to leave; the little brothers, aghast at this first touch
of passion, this glimpse of reality, skurrying, scared, going and coming, mesmerized, with
glowing eyes and bristling shoulder-fur. And the mother, mad with sorrow, goaded by the screaming,
green-eyed, vacant-minded, despairing--till a new spirit entered into her, the spirit of Cara
the All-mother, Mother Carey the Beneficent, Mother Carey the wise Straightwalker. Then the
mother mink, inspired, sprang on her suffering baby. With all the power of her limbs she sprang
and clutched; with all the power of her love she craunched. His screams were ended; his days
in the land were ended. He had not heeded her wisdom; the family fool was finished. The race
was better, better for the suffering fool mink; better for the suffering mother mink.

The spirit left her; left her limp and broken-hearted. And away on the wind went riding, grimly
riding her empire.

Four swift steeds for riding, has she, the White Wind, the West Wind, the Wet Wind and the
Waking Wind. But mostly she rides the swift West Wind.

She is strong, is Mother Carey, strong, wise, inexorable, calm and direct as an iceberg. And
beneficent; but she loves the strong ones best. She ever favours the wise ones. She is building,
ceaselessly building. The good brick she sets in a place of honour, and the poor one she grinds
into gravel for the workmen to walk on.

She loves you, but far less than she does your race. It may be that you are not wise, and if
it seem best, she will drop a tear and crush you into the dust.

Three others there be of power, like Mother Carey: Maka Ina who is Mother Earth; El Sol, the
Sun in the Sky, and Diablo the Evil Spirit of Disease and Dread. But over all is the One Great
Spirit, the Beginning and the Ruler with these and many messengers, who do His bidding. But
mostly you shall hear of Mother Carey.

It is long ago since first I heard her whisper, and though I hear better now than then, I have
no happier memory than that earliest message.

"Ho Wayseeker," she called, "I have watched your struggle to find the pathway, and I know that
you will love the things that belong to it. Therefore, I will show you the trail, and this
is what it will lead you to: a thousand pleasant friendships that will offer honey in little
thorny cups, the twelve secrets of the underbrush, the health of sunlight, suppleness of body,
the unafraidness of the night, the delight of deep water, the goodness of rain, the story of
the trail, the knowledge of the swamp, the aloofness of knowing,--yea, more, a crown and a
little kingdom measured to your power and all your own.

"But there is a condition attached. When you have found a trail you are thereby ordained a
guide. When you have won a kingdom you must give it to the world or lose it. For those who
have got power must with it bear responsibility; evade the one, the other fades away."

This is the pledge I am trying to keep; I want to be your Guide. I am offering you my little
kingdom.

TALE 1

Blue-eyes, the Snow Child, or The Story of Hepatica

Have you ever seen El Sol, the Chief of the Wonder-workers, brother to Mother Carey? Yes, you
have, though probably you did not know it; at least you could not look him in the face. Well,
I am going to tell you about him, and tell of a sad thing that happened to him, and to some
one whom he loved more than words can tell.

Tall and of blazing beauty was El Sol, the King of the Wonder-workers; his hair was like shining
gold, and stood straight out a yard from his head, as he marched over the hilltops.

Everyone loved him, except a very few, who once had dared to fight him, and had been worsted.
Everyone else loved him, and he liked everybody, without really loving them. Until one day,
as he walked in his garden, he suddenly came on a beautiful white maiden, whom he had never
seen before. Her eyes were of the loveliest blue, her hair was so soft that it floated on the
air, and her robe was white, covered with ferns done in white lace.

He fell deeply in love with her at once, but she waved a warning hand, when he tried to come near.

"Who are you, oh radiant princess? I love you even before I hear you speak."

"I am Snowroba, the daughter of the great King Jackfrost," she said.

"I love you as I never loved any one. Will you marry me? I am the King of the Wonder-workers.
I will make you the Queen."

"No," said she, "I cannot marry you, for it is written that if one of my people marry one of
your people, she will sink down and die in a day."

Then El Sol was very sad. But he said, "May I not see you again?"

"Yes," she answered, "I will meet you here in the morning, for it is pleasant to look on your
beauty," and her voice tinkled sweetly.

So she met him in the morning, and again on the third morning. He loved her madly now, and
though she held back, he seized her in his arms and kissed her tenderly.

Then her arms fell weakly to her sides, and her eyes half closed as she said: "I know now that
the old writing spake truth. I love you, I love you, my love; but you have killed me."

And she sank down, a limp white form, on the leafy ground.

El Sol was wild with grief. He tried to revive her, to bring her back.

She only whispered, "Good-bye, my love. I am going fast. You will see me no more, but come
to this place a year from now. It may be Maka Ina will be kind, and will send you a little
one that is yours and mine."

Her white body melted away, as he bent over it and wept.

He came back every morning, but saw Snowroba no more. One year from that day, as he lingered
sadly over the sacred spot, he saw a new and wonderful flower come forth. Its bloom was of
the tenderest violet blue, and it was full of expression. As he gazed, he saw those eyes again;
the scalding tears dropped from his eyes, and burned its leaves into a blotched and brownish
colour. He remembered, and understood her promise now. He knew that this was their blue-eyed
little one.

In the early springtime we can see it. Three sunny days on the edge of the snowdrift will bring
it forth. The hunterfolk who find it, say that it is just one of the spring flowers, out earlier
than any other, and is called Liverleaf, but we Woodcrafters know better. We know it is Hepatica,
the child of El Sol and Snowroba.

The Story of the White Dawnsinger

or

How the Bloodroot Came

Have you noticed that there are no snow-white birds in our woods during summer? Mother Carey
long ago made it a rule that all snow-white landbirds should go north, when the snow was gone
in the springtime. And they were quite obedient; they flew, keeping just on the south edge
of the melting snow.

But it so happened that one of the sweetest singers of all--the snow-white Dawnsinger with
the golden bill and the ruby legs--was flying northward with his bride, when she sprained her
wing so she could not fly at all.

There was no other help for it; they must stay in that thicket till her wing grew strong again.

The other white birds flew on, but the Dawnsinger waited. He sang his merriest songs to cheer
her. He brought her food: and he warned her when enemies were near.

A moon had come and gone. Now she was well again, and strong on the wing. He was anxious to
go on to their northern home. A second warning came from Mother Carey, "White birds go north."

But the sunny woodside had become very pleasant, food was abundant, and the little white lady
said, "Why should we go north when it is so much nicer right here?"

The Dawnsinger felt the same way, and the next time the warning came, "White birds go north,"
he would not listen at all, and they settled down to a joyful life in the woods.

They did not know anything about the Yellow-eyed Whizz. They never would have known, had they
gone north at their right time. But the Yellow-eyed Whizz was coming. It came, and It always
goes straight after white things in the woods, for brown things It cannot see.

Dawnsinger was high on a tree, praising the light in a glorious song, that he had just made
up, when It singled him out by his whiteness, and pierced him through.

He fell fluttering and dying; and as she flew to him, with a cry of distress, the Yellow-eyed
wicked Whizz struck her down by his side.

The Chewinks scratched leaves over the two white bodies, and--I think--that Mother Carey dropped
a tear on the place.

That was the end of the White Dawnsinger and his bride. Yet every year, at that same place,
as the snow goes, the brown leaves move and part, and up from beneath there comes a beautiful
white flower.

Its bloom threads are yellow like the Dawnsinger's beak, and its stem is ruby like his legs;
all the rest is snow-white like his plumes. It rises, looks about, faces the sun, and sings
a little odour-song, a little aroma-lay. If you look deep down into the open soul of the Dawnsinger
you will see the little golden thoughts he sings about. Then up from the same grave comes another,
just the same, but a little smaller, and for a while they stand up side by side, and praise
the light. But the Wither-bloom that haunts the flowers as the Yellow-eyed Whizz does the birds,
soon finds them out; their song is ended, their white plumes are scattered, and they shrink
back into their grave, to be side by side again.

You can find their little bodies, but deal gently with them, for they are wounded; you may
make them bleed again.

And when you hear the Chewinks scratching in the underbrush, remember they are putting leaves
on the grave of the White Dawnsinger.

       *       *       *       *       *

Surely you have guessed the secret; the flower is the Bloodroot, and the Whizz is the Sharp-shinned
Hawk.

The Prairie-girl with Yellow Hair

Tall and fair was the Prairie-girl. She was not very pretty, but her form was slender and graceful,
and her head was covered with a mass of golden hair that made you see her from afar off. It
has been whispered that she was deeply in love with El Sol, for wherever he went, she turned
her head to look at him; and when she could not see him, she drooped and languished. But he
never seemed to notice her. As she grew older her golden head turned white, and at last the
swish of Mother Carey's horses carried away all her white hair, and left her old, bald, and
ugly. So she pined and died, and Maka Ina buried her poor little body under the grass. But
some say it was Father Time that blew her hair away, and that El Sol had the body cremated.

       *       *       *       *       *

If you look on the lawns or the fields in springtime, you are sure to find the Prairie-girl.
The Guide can show her to you, if you do not know her. But he will call her "Common Dandelion,"
and I do not know of any flower that has so many things for us children to remember.

If you are learning French, you will see how it got the name "Dandelion"; it used to be written
dent de lion; that is, "tooth of a lion"; because its leaves are edged with sharp teeth, like
a lion's jaw.

Its golden-yellow flower is said to open when the Swallows arrive from the south, that is,
in April; and though it blooms chiefly in springtime it keeps on blooming till long after the
Swallows fly away. It certainly thrives as long as the sun shines on it, and fades when the
cold dark season comes. But I have seen it out in November; that is, the Dandelion blooms for
fully nine months. I do not know of any other flower that does; most of them are done in one month.

When the yellow flower is over, its place is taken by a beautiful globe of soft, white plumes;
this is why the story says its golden hair turns white with age. The children believe that
this woolly head will tell you the time of day. You hold it up, then pretend you are Father
Time blowing her hair away, blow a sharp puff with your breath, then another and another, till
the plumes are blown away. If it takes four blows, they say it means four o'clock; but it is
not a very true clock.

Some children make a wish, then blow once and say, "this year"; the second time, "next year";
the third time, "some time"; the fourth time, "never." Then begin all over, and keep on as
long as any plumes are left, to tell when the wish is coming true.

Now pull the head off the stalk. You will find it leaves a long, open tube that sounds like
a trumpet when you blow through it from the small end. If you force your finger into the big
end, and keep pushing, you split the tube into two or three pieces; put these in your mouth
and they will curl up like ringlets. Some children hang these on their ears for ornaments.
Take a stalk for each year of your age; pull its head off. Then you will find that the top
end will go into the bottom and make a ring. Use all the stalks you have gathered, to make
a chain; now throw this chain into a low tree. If it sticks the first time, your wish will
come true this year. Each time it falls puts your wish a year farther away.

This may not be true; but it is a game to play. Some big girls use it, to find out when they
are going to be married.

Now dig up the whole plant, root and all--the gardener will be much obliged to you for doing
so--take it home, and ask the Guide to make the leaves into a salad; you will find it good
to eat; most Europeans eat it regularly, either raw, or boiled as greens.

Last of all, ask the Guide to roast the root, till it is brown and crisp, then grind it in
a coffee-mill, and use it to make coffee. Some people think it better than real coffee; at
any rate, the doctors say it is much healthier, for it is nourishing food, and does not do
one any harm at all. But perhaps you will not like it. You may think all the time you are eating
the body of the poor little Prairie-girl, who died of love.

The Cat's-eye Toad, a Child of Maka Ina

When you were little, O Guide! didn't you delight in the tales of gnomes or nibelungen, those
strange underground creatures that lived hidden from the light, and busied themselves with
precious stones and metals? How unwillingly we gave up those glad beliefs, as we inevitably
grew old and lost our fairyland eyes!

But you must not give up all your joyful creeds; you must keep on believing in the weird underground
dwarfs; for I am going to tell you of one that the cold calculating Professor Science has at
last accepted, and that lives in your own back-yard. That is, the Cat's-eye Toad or Spadefoot.
It is much like a common Toad, but a little smoother, the digging spade on its hind foot is
bigger and its eye, its beautiful gold-stone eye, has the pupil up and down like that of a
Cat, instead of level as in its cousin, the warty Hoptoad. 

Among the pacific warriors in the great 1914-18 struggle there is probably none who did better
work, often under conditions of the gravest peril, than Mr. G.M. TREVELYAN for the Red Cross
in Italy. Disqualified both by age and health from joining the army of attack, he threw himself
into the task--a labour of love--of tending the sick and wounded of that country which he knows
so well and of whose greatest modern hero he is the classic biographer. That the eulogist of
GARIBALDI should hasten to the succour of Italian soldiers was fitting,
and how well he performed the task the records of the Villa Trenta
Hospital, near Udine, and of the ambulance drivers under his command,
abundantly tell.

The story of this beneficent campaign and of much besides is told with too much modesty by Mr. TREVELYAN
himself, in a book entitled Scenes from Italy's War (JACK), which gives a series of the vividest
impressions of the Italian effort, and is remarkable for the best
analysis that I have yet seen of the causes that led to the disaster
of Caporetto.

The pages in which Mr. TREVELYAN paints the portrait of a typical Italian soldier, home sick
and perplexed, are likely to be borrowed by many more pretentious historians of the War for years
to come.

* * * * *

Mr. JOHN HARGRAVE, the author and illustrator of The Great War Brings It Home (CONSTABLE) has already
a wide reputation in the world of Scouts, gained not only by his enthusiasm but by his profound
knowledge of scout-craft. Here he tells us very plainly that the War has brought home to us
the fact that, if we are to make good our losses in the ranks of the young and the fit, we have
got to give our children a better chance of living healthy, wholesome lives. He urges the need
of more outdoor education and as many open-air camps as possible, and shows that, if we are
to carry out such a scheme as he lays in detail before us, scoutmasters and still more scoutmasters
are wanted. With reason he complains that none of these good fellows is paid one halfpenny,
and that nearly all of them are young men who have to get a living. "Offer them," he says, "a
living wage and how gladly would they become national scoutmasters
in charge of national camps."

You may, if you are on the look-out for it, find much that will seem
fantastic in Mr. HARGRAVE'S ideas; his appeal, however, is not to
those of us who, even in a case of great national urgency, cannot
get away from the tyranny of convention.

 The frost draperies of his couch were gone; his white
blanket was burnt into holes. He turned over a little; then the ice on the river cracked like
near-by thunder. When he turned again, it began to slip over the big beaver-dam of Niagara,
but still he did not awake.

The great Er-Beaver in his pond, that men call Lake Erie, flapped his tail, and the waves rolled
away to the shore, and set the ice heaving, cracking, and groaning; but Nana-bo-jou slept on.

Then the Ice-demons pounded the shore of the island with their clubs. They pushed back the
whole river-flood till the channel was dry, then let it rush down like the end of all things,
and they shouted together:

"Nana-bo-jou! Nana-bo-jou! Nana-bo-jou! Wake up!"

But still he slept calmly on.

Then came a soft, sweet voice, more gentle than the mating turtle of Miami. It was in the air,
but it was nowhere, and yet it was in the trees, in the water, and it was in Nana-bo-jou too.
He felt it, and it awoke him. He sat up and looked about. His white blanket was gone; only
a few tatters of it were to be seen in the shady places. In the sunny spots the shreds of the
fringe with its beads had taken root and were growing into little flowers with beady eyes,
Spring Beauties as they are called now. The small voice kept crying: "Awake! the spring is coming!"

Nana-bo-jou said: "Little voice, where are you? Come here."

But the little voice, being everywhere, was nowhere, and could not come at the hero's call.

So he said: "Little voice, you are nowhere because you have no place to live in; I will make
you a home."

So Nana-bo-jou took a curl of birch bark and made a little wigwam, and because the voice came
from the skies he painted the wigwam with blue mud, and to show that it came from the Sunland
he painted a red sun on it. On the floor he spread a scrap of his own white blanket, then for
a fire he breathed into it a spark of life, and said: "Here, little voice, is your wigwam."
The little voice entered and took possession, but Nana-bo-jou had breathed the spark of life
into it. The smoke-vent wings began to move and to flap, and the little wigwam turned into
a beautiful Bluebird with a red sun on its breast and a shirt of white. Away it flew, but every
year it comes as winter wanes, the Bluebird of the spring. The voice still dwells in it, and
we feel that it has lost nothing of its earliest power when we hear it cry: "Awake! the spring
is coming!"

Robin, the Bird that Loves to Make Clay Pots

Everyone knows the Robin; his reddish-brown breast, gray back, white throat, and dark wings
and tail are easily remembered. If you colour the drawing, you will always remember it afterward.
The Robin comes about our houses and lawns; it lets us get close enough to see it. It has a
loud, sweet song. All birds have a song[A]; and all sing when they are happy. As they sing
most of the time, except when they are asleep, or when moulting, they must have a lot of happiness
in their lives.

Here are some things to remember about the Robin. It is one of the earliest of all our birds
to get up in the morning, and it begins to sing long before there is daylight.

Birds that live in the trees, hop; birds that live on the ground, walk or run; but the Robin
lives partly in the trees and partly on the ground, so sometimes he hops and sometimes he runs.

When he alights on a fence or tree, he looks at you and flashes the white spots on the outer
corners of his tail. Again and again he does this. Why? That is his way of letting you know
that he is a Robin. He is saying in signal code--flash and wig-wag--"I'm a Robin, I'm a Robin,
I'm a Robin." So you will not mistake him for some bird that is less loved.

The Robin invented pottery before men did; his nest is always a clay pot set in a little pile
of straws. Sometime, get a Robin's nest after the bird is done with it; dry it well, put it
on the fire very gently; leave it till all the straws are burned away, and then if it does
not go to pieces, you will find you have a pretty good earthen pot.

The Robin loves to make these pots. I have known a cock Robin make several which he did not
need, just for the fun of making them.

A friend of mine said to me once, "Come, and I will show you the nest of a crazy Robin." We
went to the woodshed and there on a beam were six perfectly good Robin nests all in a row;
all of them empty.

"There," said my friend. "All of these six were built by a cock Robin in about ten days or
two weeks. He seemed to do nothing but sing and build nests. Then after finishing the last
one, he disappeared. Wasn't he crazy?"

"No," I said, "not at all. He was not crazy; he was industrious. Let me finish the chapter.
The hen Robin was sitting on the eggs, the cock bird had nothing else to do, so he put in the
time at the two things he did the best and loved the most: singing and nest-building. Then
after the young were hatched in the home nest, he had plenty to do caring for them, so he ceased
both building and singing, for that season."

I have often heard of such things. Indeed, they are rather common, but not often noticed, because
the Robin does not often build all the extra nests in one place.

Do you know the lovely shade called Robin's-egg blue? The next time you see a Robin's nest
with eggs in it you will understand why it was so named and feel for a moment, when first you
see it, that you have found a casket full of most exquisite jewels.

Next to nest-building, singing is the Robin's gift, and the songs that he sings are full of
joy. He says, "cheerup, cheer up, cheerily cheer-up"; and he means it too.

Brook Brownie, or How the Song Sparrow Got His Streaks

  They, every one, applauded when he sang about his deeds.

  And his songs were fairly bubbling o'er with melody and glee.
  But an envious Neighbour splashed with mud our Brownie's coat and vest,
  And then a final handful threw that stuck upon his breast.
  The Brook-bird's mother did her best to wash the stains away;
  But there they stuck, and, as it seems, are very like to stay.

Diablo and the Dogwood

What a glorious thing is the Maytime Dogwood in our woods! How it does sing out its song! More
loudly and clearly it sings than any other spring flower! For it is not one, but a great chorus;
and I know it is singing that "The spring, the very spring is in the land!"

I suppose if one had King Solomon's fayland ears, one might hear the Dogwood music like a lot
of church bells pealing, like the chorus of the cathedral where Woodthrush is the preacher-priest
and the Veeries make responses.

It was Adam's favourite tree, they say, in the Garden of Eden. And it grew so high, flowered
so wonderfully, and gave so much pleasure that Diablo, who is also called the Devil, wanted
to kill it. He made up his mind that he would blight and scatter every shining leaf of its
snowy bloom. So one dark night he climbed a Honey Locust tree near the gate, and swung by his
tail over the wall, intending to tear off all the lovely blossoms. But he got a shock when
he found that every flower was in the shape of a cross, which put them beyond his power to
blight. He was furious at not being able to destroy its beauty, so did the worst he could.
Keeping away from the cross he bit a piece out of the edge of every snowy flower leaf, and
then jumped back to the Honey Locust tree.

The Locust was ashamed when she found that she had helped Diablo to do such a mean bit of mischief,
so she grew a bristling necklace of strong spikes to wear; they were so long and sharp that
no one since, not even Diablo himself, has ever been able to climb that Honey Locust tree.

But it was too late to save the Dogwood bloom. The bites were out, and they never healed up
again, as you can see to this very day.

TALE 9

The Woolly-bear

Do you know the Woolly-bear Caterpillar? It is divided into three parts; the middle one brown,
the two ends black. Everyone notices the Woolly-bear, because it comes out in early spring,
as soon as the frost is over, and crawls on the fences and sidewalks as though they belonged
to it. It does not seem to be afraid of any one or anything. It will march across the road
in front of a motor car, or crawl up the leg of your boot. Sometimes when you brush it off
with your hand, little hairs are left sticking in your fingers, because it is really like a
small porcupine, protected by short spears sticking out of its skin in all directions. Here
at the side of the picture, is one of these hairs seen under a microscope.

Where did the Woolly-bear come from? It was hatched from an egg last summer.

And now what is going to happen? It will stuff itself with rib-grass or other low plants, till
it has grown bigger; then it will get a warning from the All-mother to prepare for the great
change. In some low dry place under a log, stone or fence-rail, it will spin a cocoon with
its own spikey hairs outside for a protector. In this rough hairy coffin it will roll itself
up, for its "little death," as the Indians call it, and Mother Carey will come along with her
sleeping wand, and touch it, so it will go into sound sleep, but for only a few days. One bright
sunny morning old Mother Carey comes around again, touches the Woolly-bear bundle-baby, and
out of it comes the Woolly-bear, only now it is changed like the Prince in the story into a
beautiful Moth called the Tiger-Moth! Out he comes, and if you look up at one end of the coffin
he is leaving, you may see the graveclothes he wore when first he went to sleep. Away he flies
now to seek his beautiful mate, and soon she lays a lot of eggs, from each of which will come
another little Woolly-bear to grow into a big Woolly-bear, and do it all over again.

Cocoons

Everyone loves to go a-hunting. Our forebears were hunters for so many ages that the hunting
spirit is strong in all of us, even though held in check by the horror of giving pain to a
fellow being. But the pleasure of being outdoors, of seeking for hidden treasures, of finding
something that looks at first like old rubbish, and then turns out to be a precious and beautiful
thing, that is ours by right of the old law--finders, keepers. That is a kind of hunting that
every healthy being loves, and there are many ways and chances for you to enjoy it.

Go out any time between October and April, and look in all the low trees and high bushes for
the little natural rag-bundles called "cocoons." Some are bundle-shaped and fast to a twig
their whole length. Some hang like a Santa Claus bag on a Christmas tree; but all may be known
by their hairiness or the strong, close cover of fine gray or brown fibre or silk, without
seams and woven to keep out the wet.

They are so strongly fastened on, that you will have to break the twig to get the bundle down.
If it seems very light, and rattled when you shake it, you will likely see one or more small,
sharp, round holes in it. This means that an insect enemy has destroyed the little creature
sleeping within. If the Cocoon is perfect and seems solid and heavy, take it home, and put
it in a cardboard, or wooden box, which has a wire screen, or gauze cover. Keep it in a light
place, not too dry, till the springtime comes; then one day a miracle will take place. The
case will be cut open from within, and out will come a gorgeous Moth. It is like the dull,
dark grave opening up at the resurrection to let forth a new-born, different being with wings
to fly in the heavens above.

In the drawing I have shown five different kinds of bundle-baby, then at the bottom have added
the jug-handled bundle-baby of the Tomato worm; it does not make a Cocoon but buries itself
in the ground when the time comes for the Great Sleep. Kind Mother Earth protects it as she
does the Hickory Horn-Devil, so it does not need to make a Cocoon at all.

There is a wonderful story about each of these bundle-babies. You will never get weary if you
follow and learn them, for each one differs from the last. Some of them I hope to tell you
in this book, and before we begin I want you to know some of the things that men of science
have learned, and why a Butterfly is not a Moth.

TALE 12

Butterflies and Moths

Do you remember the dear old fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast? How Beauty had to marry the
Beast to save her father's life? But as soon as she had bravely agreed to sacrifice herself--as
soon as she gave the fateful "Yes" the Beast stood up on his hind legs, his horns, hoofs and
hide rolled off, and he was turned back into his true shape, a splendid young Prince whom she
could not help loving; and they lived happy ever after.

Do you know that just such transformations and happy weddings are going on about us all the
time? The Beast is an ugly Caterpillar, the Princess Beauty is the Butterfly or the Moth. And
when the Beast is changed into the Prince Charming and meets with Princess Beauty, they are
just as madly happy as they tell it in the fairy books. I know it, for I have seen the transformation,
and I have seen the pair go off on their wedding flight.

Men of science have been trying to explain these strange transformations, and to discover why
the Prince and Princess do not need to eat or drink, once they have won their highest form,
their life of wings and joy. But they have not got much farther than giving names to the things
we have long loved and seen as children, dividing the winged wonders into two big families
called Butterflies and Moths.

Do you know the difference between a Butterfly and a Moth?

Taken together they make a large group that are called Scale-wings, because they alone among
insects, have scales or tiny feathers like dust on the wings. Butterflies are Scale-wings that
fly by day, and have club-shaped feelers; they mostly fold one wing against the other when
they alight, and in the chrysalis, or bundle-baby stage, they are naked and look like an African
ear-drop.

Moths are Scale-wings that fly by night, and have switch or feather-shaped feelers; they keep
their wings spread open when they alight, and in the bundle-baby stage, they are wrapped in
a cocoon. There are some that do not keep to these rules, but they are rare, and the shape
of the feelers will tell whether it is a Moth or a Butterfly.

All of these Scale-wings are hatched from eggs, and come first, as a worm, grub, or caterpillar;
next as a chrysalis pupa or bundle-baby; last as the winged creature. That is, first a Beast
and last a Beauty. Each of them must at one time be the ugly one, before the great change comes.
But I must tell you a truth that the Fairy Books left out, and which maybe you have guessed--Princess
Beauty too was at one time forced to live and look like a Beast, till she had fought her own
fight, had worked out her own high destiny, and won her way to wings.

The Mourning-cloak Butterfly, or the Camberwell Beauty

There was once a lady who dwelt in Camberwell. She was so good to see that people called her
"The Camberwell Beauty." She dressed so magnificently that her robe was covered with gold,
and spangled with precious stones of most amazing colours. Especially proud was she, of the
row of big blue diamonds that formed the border; and she loved to go forth into the world to
see and be seen; although she knew that the country was full of robbers who would be sure to
steal her jewels if they could. Then she made a clever plan, she kept on the beautiful things
that she loved to dress in, but over all she hung a black velvet mourning cloak which nobody
could possibly want to steal. Then she went up and down the roads as much as she pleased.

       *       *       *       *       *

Well, this story may be not quite true, but it is partly true, and the beautiful lady is known
to-day as the Mourning-cloak Butterfly. There it is, plain to be seen, the black mourning cloak,
but peeping from under it, you can see the golden border and some of the blue diamonds too,
if you look very carefully.

In the North Woods where I spent my young days, the first butterfly to be seen in the springtime
was the Mourning-cloak, and the reason we saw it so early in the season, yes, even in the snowtime,
was because this is one of the Butterflies that sometimes sleep all winter, and so live in
two different seasons.

Its eggs are laid on the willows, elms, or poplars, in early springtime. The young soon hatch,
and eat so much, and grow so fast, that five weeks after the eggs are laid, and three after
they are hatched, the caterpillar is full grown, and hangs itself up as a chrysalis under some
sheltering board or rail. In two weeks more, the wonderful event takes place, the perfect Butterfly
comes forth; and there is another Mourning-cloak to liven the roadside, and amaze us with its
half-hidden beauty.

The Wandering Monarch

Did you ever read the old Greek story of Ulysses, King of Ithaca, the Wandering Monarch, who
for twenty years roamed over sea and land away from home--always trying to get back, but doomed
to keep on travelling, homesick and weary, but still moving on; until his name became a byword
for wandering?

In our own woods and our own fields in America we have a Wandering Monarch--the "Big Red Butterfly"
as we children called it--the "Monarch" as it is named by the butterfly catchers.

It is called the "Wanderer" chiefly because it is the only one of our Butterflies that migrates
like the birds. In the late summer it gathers in great swarms when the bright days are waning,
and flies away to warmer lands. I have often seen it going, yet I do not remember that I ever
saw it come back in the springtime; but it comes, though not in great flocks like those that
went south.

One of the common names of this splendid creature is "Milkweed Butterfly" because its grub
or caterpillar is fond of feeding on the leaves of the common milkweed.

The drawing shows the size and style of the grub; in colour it is yellow or yellowish green
with black bands.

As soon as it is grown big enough and fat enough, the grub hangs itself up as a "chrysalis"
which is a Greek word that may be freely rendered into "golden jewel." The middle drawing shows
its shape; in colour it is of a pale green with spots of gold, or as it has been described
"a green house with golden nails."

After about two weeks the great change takes place, and the bundle-baby or chrysalis opens
to let out the splendid red-brown Butterfly, of nearly the same red as a Cock Robin's breast
in springtime, with lines and embroidery of black and its border set with pearls. Near the
middle of the hind wing is a dark spot like a thickening of one rib. This has been called a
"sachet bag" or "scent-pocket," and though not very ornamental to look at, is of more use to
it than the most beautiful white pearl of the border. For this is the battery of its wireless
telegraph. We think our ships and aeroplanes very far advanced because they can signal miles
away, and yet the Wandering Monarch had an outfit for sending messages long before it was ever
dreamed of by man. Maybe it is not a very strong battery, but it certainly reaches for miles;
and maybe its messages are not very clear, but they serve at least to let the Monarchs know
where their wives are, and how to find them, which is something.

There is one other reason for calling this the Wanderer. Although it is an American by birth,
it has travelled to England and the Philippines and is ever going farther over the world till
at last no doubt it will have seen all lands and possessed them.

It makes old Ulysses look like a very stay-at-home, for his farthest travels never went beyond
the blue Mediterranean, and his whole twenty years of voyaging covered less than the states
east of the Mississippi--much less than our Red Wanderer covers in a single summer.

The Bells of the Solomon Seal

Let us go out into the woods, and look for the Solomon Seal. This is May and we should find
it in some half open place, where it is neither wet nor dry. Here it is! See the string of
bells that hangs from its curving stem. Dig out its roots, wash off the earth, and you will
see the mark of King Solomon's Seal that gives its name to the plant. Now listen to the story
of it all.

King Solomon had the "second sight" that means the deeper sight, the magic eyesight which made
him see through a stone wall, or read men's thoughts. King Solomon had fayland ears; which
means, he could hear all sounds from A to Z; while common ears, like yours and mine, hear only
the middle sounds from K to Q.

Everything that lives and moves is giving out music; every flower that blooms is singing its
song. We cannot hear, our ears are too dull; but King Solomon could. And one day, as he walked
through the woods, he heard a new flower-song that made him stop and listen. It had strange
music with it, and part of that was a chime of golden bells.

The great King sat down on a bank. His fayland eyes could see right into the ground. He saw
the fat fleshy root like a little goblin, reaching its long white fingers down into the soil,
picking out the magic crystals to pack away in its pockets; and he could see the tall stem
like a wood-elf carrying them up, and spreading them upon its flat hands, so they could soak
up the juices of the sun and air. He could see them turning into a wonderful stuff like amber
dew, with a tang like new-cut timber. But it was not yet done, so he could not tell just what
it might be good for. Now it was springtime, and it would be harvest red moon before the little
worker would have the magic healing stored in its treasure bags underground. So to prevent
any one harming or hindering the plant till its work was done, the King took out his seal ring
and stamped seal marks all along the root, where they are unto this day. And then to make it
sure he made the golden bell chimes become visible so every one could see them. There they
hang like a row of ringing bells.

But the King never came back to learn the rest of it, for he had to build the temple; and he
had many wives who took up a great deal of his time. So the world has never found out just
what is the magic power of the plant. But it is there, be sure of that, just as surely as the
peal of golden bells is there, and the marks of the great King's Seal.

TALE 16

The Silver Bells of the False Solomon Seal

Over a month later, the King suddenly remembered that he had not been out to see the plant
whose root he had sealed. He was very busy at the time, as he had the temple to build, and
many wives to look after; so he called Djin, a good goblin, who does hard work and said, "Go
and see that no one has harmed that plant," then told him how to find it.

Away went the good goblin, like a flash. He was a very obedient servant, but not very bright;
and when he came to the woods, he looked all around for the plant with the chime of bells,
for King Solomon had forgotten to say that the bells do not ring after June, and it was now
July. So the goblin looked about for a long time. He did not dare to go back and say he could
not find it--that would have been a terrible crime, so he looked and looked. At last he heard
a little tinkle of bells away off in the woods. He flew to the place, and there was a plant
like the one he sought but its bells were of silver, and all in a bunch instead of a long string.
The good goblin dug down to the big fat root in the ground and found that the seal marks had
grown over--at least he thought they had--for they were nowhere to be seen. So he looked around
for something to help. His eye fell on an acorn cup. He took this, and using it for a seal,
he stamped the root all over.

Then he took a piece of the root and a sprig and flew back to show the King. Solomon smiled
and said: "You did the best you could, but you have marked the wrong root. Listen! This is
not the golden chime, but the chime of silver bells."

That is the story of it and that is why it has ever since been called the False Solomon Seal.

How the Mouse-bird Made Fun of the Brownie

Once there was a conceited Brownie, who thought he could do more things and do them better
than any other of his people. He had not tried yet, for he was very young, but he said he was
going to do them some day!

One morning a sly old Brownie, really making fun of him, said: "Why don't you catch that Phoebe-bird?
It is quite easy if you put a little salt on his tail." Away went Smarty Brownie to try. But
the Phoebe would not sit still, and the Brownie came back saying: "He bobbed his tail so, the
salt would not stay on."

"Well," said the sly old Brownie, "there is a little Mouse-bird whose tail never bobs. You
can easily catch him, for you see, he does not even fly, but crawls like a mouse up the tree,"
and he pointed to a little brown Creeper. By this time the young Brownie knew that the others
were laughing at him, so he said rather hotly, "I'll just show you right now."

He took an acorn cup full of salt, and went after the Mouse-bird. It was at the bottom of the
big tree, creeping up, round and round, as if on a spiral staircase, and the Brownie began
to climb in the same way. But every little while the climber had to stop and rest. This had
strange results, for there is a law in Brownie land, that wherever one of the little people
stops to sit down, or rest, a toadstool must spring up for him to sit on. So the track of the
Brownie up the trunk became one long staircase of toadstool steps, some close, some far apart,
but each showing where the Brownie had rested. They came closer together toward the top where
the Brownie had got tired, but he was coming very near to the Creeper now. He got his pinch
of salt all ready, as his friends down below kept calling and jeering: "Now you've got him,
now is your chance." But just as he was going to leap forward and drop the salt on its tail,
the Creeper gave a tiny little laugh like "Tee-tee-tee," spread its wings, for it could fly
very well, and sailed away to the bottom of the next tree to do the spiral staircase all over
again, while Smarty Brownie was so mad that he jumped to the ground and hid away from his friends
for two days. When he came back he did not talk quite so much as he used to. But to this day
you can see the staircase of toadstools on the tree trunks where the Brownie went up.

The Pot-herb that Sailed with the Pilgrims

"Come," said the Guide, "to-day I am going to show you a Pot-herb that came from England with
the Pilgrim Fathers and spread over the whole of America. There is a story about it that will
keep it ever in your memory."

The Pilgrims had landed in Massachusetts, and slowly made farms for themselves as they cleared
off the forest. They had a very hard time at first, but the Indians helped them; sometimes
with gifts of venison, and sometimes by showing them which things in the woods were good to eat.

There was a Squaw named Monapini, "the Root-digger," who was very clever at finding forest
foods. She became friendly with a white woman named Ruth Pilgrim, and so Ruth's family got
the benefit of it, and always had on the table many good things that came from the woods.

One day, long after the farms were cleared and doing well, the white woman said, "See, Mother
Monapini, thou hast shown me many things, now I have somewhat to show thee. There hath grown
up in our wheat field a small herb that must have come from England with the wheat, for hitherto
I have not seen it elsewhere. We call it lamb's-quarter, for the lamb doth eat it by choice.
Or maybe because we do eat it with a quarter of lamb. Nevertheless it maketh a good pot-herb
when boiled."

The old Indian woman's eyes were fixed on the new plant that was good to eat: and she said,
"Is it very good, oh white sister?"

"Yes, and our medicine men do say that it driveth out the poison that maketh itch and spots
on the skin." After a moment Monapini said, "It looketh to me like the foot of a wild goose."

"Well found," chuckled Ruth, "for sometimes our people do call it by that very name."

"That tells me different," said the Indian.

"What mean you," said Ruth.

"Is not a goose foot very strong, so it never catcheth cold in the icy water?"

"Yes."

"And this hath the shape of a goose foot?"

"Yes."

"Then my Shaman tells that it is by such likeness that the Great Spirit showeth the goose foot
plant to be charged with the driving out of colds."

"It may be so," said the white woman, "but this I know. It is very good and helpeth the whole
body."

The Indian picked a handful of the pot-herbs, then stared hard at the last; a very tall and
strong one.

"What hast thou now, Monapini?" The red woman pointed to the stem of the lamb's-quarter, whereon
were long red streaks, and said: "This I see, that, even as the white-man's herb came over
the sea and was harmless and clean while it was weak, but grew strong and possessed this field,
then was streaked to midheight with blood, so also shall they be who brought it--streaked at
last to the very waist with blood--not the white men's but the dark purple blood of the Indian.
This the voices tell me is in the coming years, that this is what we shall get again for helping
you--destruction in return for kindness. Mine inner eyes have seen it." She threw down the
new pot-herb and glided away, to be seen no more in the settlements of the white men.

And Ruth, as she gazed after her, knew that it was true. Had she not heard her people talking
and planning? For even as the weed seed came with the wheat, so evil spirits came with the
God-fearing Pilgrims, and already these were planning to put the heathens to the sword, when
the Colony was strong enough.

So the Indian woman read the truth in the little pot-herb that sailed and landed with the Pilgrims;
that stands in our fields to this day, streaked with the blood of the passing race--standing,
a thing of remembrance.

How the Red Clover Got the White Mark on Its Leaves

Once upon a time a Bee, a Bug, and a Cow went marching up to Mother Carey's palace in the hemlock
grove, to tell her of their troubles. They complained that food was poor and scarce, and they
were tired of the kinds that grew along the roadsides.

Mother Carey heard them patiently, then she said: "Yes, you have some reason to complain, so
I will send you a new food called Clover. Its flower shall be full of honey for the Bee, its
leaves full of cowfood and its cellar shall be stocked with tiny pudding bags of meal for the
Bug, that is for good little Bug-folks who live underground."

Now the tribes of the Bee, the Bug, and the Cow had a fine time feasting, for the new food
was everywhere.

But Cows are rather stupid you know. They found the new food so good that they kept on munching
everything that had three round leaves, thinking it was Clover, and very soon a lot of them
were poisoned with strange plants that no wise Cow would think of eating.

So Mother Carey called a Busy Brownie, and put him on guard to keep the Cows from eating the
poison plants by mistake.

soon got a bundle of roots like cords, and of different lengths, from two feet to a yard, or more.

"Good," said Akoko; "this is enough and we need not soak them, for it is summer, and the sap
is running. If it were fall we should have to boil them. Now you must scrape them clear of
the brown bark." So Nagami took her knife and worked for an hour, then came with the bundle
saying: "See, Mother, they are smooth, and so white that they have not a brown spot left."
"Good," said Akoko, "now you need some bark of the willow for sewing cord. Let us look along
the river bank."

There they found the round-leafed, or fish-net willow, and stripped off enough of its strong
bark to make a bundle as big as one hand could hold.

This also had to be scraped clear of the brown skin, leaving only the strong whitish inner
bark, which, when split into strips, was good for sewing.

"See, my Nagami, when I was a little girl I had only a bone needle made from the leg of a deer,
but you have easy work; here is a big steel packing needle, which I bought for you from a trader.
This is how you make your basket."

So Akoko began a flat coil with the spruce roots, and sewed it together with the willow bark
for thread, until it was a span wide. And whenever a new root was to be added, she cut both
old piece and new, to a long point, so they would overlap without a bump.

Then the next coil of the spruce roots was laid on, not flat and level, but raised a little.
Also the next, until the walls were as high as four fingers. Then Akoko said, "Good, that is
enough. It is a fine corn basket. But we must give it a red rim for good luck."

So they sought in a sunny place along the shore, and found the fruit of the squawberry or blitum.
"See," said Akoko, "the miscawa. Gather a handful, my Nagami. They make the red basket-dye."

They crushed the rich red berries, saving the red juice in a clam shell, and soaked a few strands
of the white willow bark in the stain. When they were dry, Nagami was taught to add a rim to
her basket, by sewing it over and over as in the picture.

Then Akoko said, "Good, my little Bird-Singer, you have done well, you have made some old black
roots into a beautiful basket."

Crinkleroot; or Who Hid the Salad?

It has long been the custom of the Brownies to have a great feast on the first of the merry
month of May, to celebrate the return of the spring.

One springtime long ago, they got ready as usual. The King of the Brownies had invited all
the leaders; the place for the dinner was chosen in a grove of mandrakes whose flat umbrellas
made a perfect roof, rain or shine. The Bell Bird, whose other name is Wood Thrush, was ringing
his bell, and calling all the Chief Brownies by name.

"Ta-rool-ya! ting-a-ling-ling-ling."

"Oka-lee! ting-a-ling-ling-ling."

"Cherk! ting-a-ling-ling-ling."

"Come to the feasting! ting-a-ling-ling-ling."

A hundred glow worms were told to hurry up with their lights and be ready for that night, and
busy Brownies gathered good things from woods and waters, for the feast.

May Day came bright and beautiful. The busy ones had all the "eats" in the Mandrake Hall, the
glowworms were sleeping soundly to fill their storage batteries ready for the night. It made
the salamanders' mouths water to see so many good things; but they were not asked, so stayed
away. There were dewdrops in acorn cups, and honey on the wax. There were clam shells piled
up with red checkerberries, and caddis worms on the half shell, with spicebush nubbins. A huge
white Mecha-meck was the chief dish, with bog nuts on the side. There were lovely long crinkle
salads. And last, there were gumdrops from the sweet birch, while at each place was a pussy
willow to dust the food over with golden pollen that gave it a pleasant peppery tang. All the
guests were there, and the feast was nearly over, when a terrible thing took place!

Of all the dreaded happenings in the world of beauty there is nothing else so feared as the
forest fire. There is not much danger of it in springtime, but it is possible at any season,
after a long dry spell. Words cannot tell of the horror it spreads, as it comes raging through
the woods destroying all beautiful living things.

And right in the middle of the feast, the dreadful news was carried by a flying Night-bird.

"Fire, Fire, Fire, Fire!" he screamed, and almost at once the smoke came drifting through the
banquet hall, so they knew it was true.

There was mad haste to escape, and only two ways were open. One was to get across some big
stream, and the other was to hide in a cave underground. The birds took the first way, and
the Brownies the second. Every Woodchuck den was just packed with Brownies within a few minutes.
But the busy Brownie who was chief steward and had charge of the feast, had no idea of leaving
all the good things to burn up, if he could help it. First he sent six of his helpers to make
a deep pit for the big Mecha-meck, and while they did that he began hiding all the dishes in
the ground. Last he dug some deep holes and quickly buried all the crinkle salads; then he
ran for his life into a cave.

The raging fire came along. It is too horrible to tell about, for it was sent by the Evil One.
The lovely woods were left black without a living thing. But the very next day, Mother Carey
and Mother Earth and El Sol, set about saving the wreck, and in a marvellously short time actually
had made it green again. The mayflowers came up a second time that year, the violets came back,
and in each place where the Brownies had hid a salad there came up a curious plant that never
had been seen before. It had three saw-edged leaves and a long wand, much like the one carried
by the Chief Steward. I never was able to find out his name for sure, but I think it was Trileaf
or Three-leaves. Anyway, if you dig under his sign and sceptre wand, you will surely find the
salad, and very good indeed it is to eat; it was not hurt in the least by the fire.

But from that day, the Brownies have been very shy of feasting during dry weather in the woods.
They generally have their banquets now in some meadow, and afterward you can tell the place
of the feast by the circle of little toadstools called fairy rings. For you know that wherever
a Brownie sits, a toadstool must spring up for him to sit on.

TALE 23

The Mecha-meck

That fearful time when the forest fire set all the Brownies busy burying their food and dishes
at the feast-hall, you remember it took six of them to carry and hide the Mecha-meck. For it
is a large fat white root as big as a baby, and sometimes it has arms or legs, so that when
Monapini told Ruth Pilgrim about it she called it "Man-of-the-earth."

You remember that the busy Brownie hid all the Crinkle salads, and so saved them; and most
of us have found the Crinkleroot and eaten it since. But how many of us have found the Mecha-meck?
I know only one man who has. We call him the Wise Woodman. He found and dug out the one from
which I made the picture. It was two and a half feet long and weighed fifteen pounds--fifteen
pounds of good food. Think of it! Above it and growing out of its hiding place was a long trailing
vine that looked like a white morning-glory. There is always one of these over the Mecha-meck.
And by that you may find it, if you look along the sunny banks outside of the woods. But still
it is very hard to find. I never yet got one, though I have found many of the crinkle-root
salads. Of course, that is easy to explain, for the busy Brownies buried hundreds of the salads,
but only one of the big fat Mecha-meck.

TALE 24

Dutchman's Breeches

Of course they are not, for no Dutchman I ever saw could wear such tiny things. I will tell
you what they really are and how that came to be.

You remember how the Brownies assembled for the feast on May Day when the Glow worms were the
lamps and the Wood Thrush rang the bell. Well, it so happened that day that a great crowd of
the merrymakers gathered long before the feast was ready, and while they were wondering what
to do someone shouted: "See, how fine and warm the water is where the brook spreads out into
the ditch. Let us have our first swim of the season right now!"

So they all went with a whoop! stripped off their clothes, and into their swimming breeches
with a perfect riot of glee.

Then how they did splash! Some blind folks thought it must be a million early pollywogs splashing.
But the swim ended with another racket when the dinner bell rang.

Each splashing Brownie hopped out and hung up his breeches to dry as he got into his clothes.

Then you remember the fire came along and scared them away. Of course the breeches were wet,
so they didn't get singed; and there you can see them hanging to this day on the first of May.
That is what they really are--Brownies' Breeches. And because the Brownies often swim in a
ditch, they are called ditch-man's breeches; but believe me, they are not Dutchman's breeches
and never could be.

TALE 25

The Seven Sour Sisters

If you look along any half-open bank in the edge of the woods, or even in the woods itself,
you are sure to see one of the Seven Sorrel Sisters, with leaves a little like Clover, only
notched in the end and without the white marks, that the Brownie put on the Clover. There are
seven of them, according to most doctors; five have yellow eyes, one purple, and one white
streaked with blood. Their Latin name means "vinegar" and their Greek name means "acid." "Sorrel"
itself means "Little sour one," so you see they have the reputation of a sour bunch. If you
eat one of the leaves, you will agree that the name was well-chosen, and understand why the
druggists get the tart "salt of lemons" from this family. The French use these Sour Sisters
for their sour soup. But in spite of their unsweetness, they are among the pretty things of
the woods; their forms are delicate and graceful; their eyes are like jewels, and when the
night comes down, they bow their heads, gracefully fold their hands, and sleep like a lot of
tired children.

TALE 26

Self-heal or Blue-curls in the Grass

You should know the history of the lowly little flower called Blue-curls; and you must remember
that flowers have their troubles just as you have. For one thing, flowers must get their pollen
or yellow flower-dust, carried to some other of their kind, or they cannot keep on growing
good seed. And since the flower cannot walk about finding places for its pollen, it generally
makes a bargain with a bee. It says, "If you will carry my pollen to my cousins yonder, I will
give you a sweet sip of nectar." That is where the bees get the stuff for all their honey,
and that is how the pollen is carried.

Well, the modest little Blue-curls long had had a working agreement with the Meadow Bees, and
got on nicely. But one summer Blue-curls became discontented. She saw all the other plants
with wonderful gifts that had power to cure pain and sickness; while she was doing nothing
but live her own easy life, and she felt she was a nobody.

So one day as Mother Carey's slowest steed was swishing over the grass, Blue-curls cried out:
"Mother Carey, Mother Carey, won't you hear me and grant me a gift?"

"What is it, little one?" said the All-mother.

"Oh, Mother Carey, the pansy cures heartache, the monkshood cures canker-lip, the tansy cures
colds, and all the others have some joy and honour of service, but I am good for nothing, Mother
Carey so the wise men despise me. Won't you give me a job? Won't you give me some little power?"

"Little one, such an asking never finds me deaf. I love those who would help. I will give you
a little bit of all healing so that you shall be good medicine, if not the best, for all ills,
and men shall call you 'Self-heal' and 'All-heal' for you shall have all healing in yourself."

And it has been so ever since. So that some who go by looks call the modest little meadow flower,
"Blue-curls in the Grass," but the old herb-men who know her goodness call her "All-heal" or
"Self-heal."

The Four Butterflies You See Every Summer

There are four Butterflies that you are sure to see every summer, on our fields; and remember
that each of them goes through the same changes. First it is an egg, then a greedy grub, next
a hanging bundle-baby, and last a beautiful winged fairy, living a life of freedom and joy.

In the picture I have shown the butterflies life size, but you must add the colour as you get
each one to copy.

The first is the White or Cabbage Butterfly that flits over our gardens all summer long.

It is not a true American, but came from Europe in 1860 and landed at Quebec, from whence it
has spread all over the country. In the drawing I have shown the female; the male is nearly
the same but has only one round dark spot on the front wings. Its grub is a little naked green
caterpillar, that eats very nearly a million dollars' worth of cabbages a year; so it is a
pity it was ever allowed to land in this country. There are moths that we should like to get
rid of, but this is the only butterfly that is a pest.

2nd. The Yellow or Clouded Sulphur Butterfly. You are sure to find it, as soon as you begin
to look for butterflies. This is the one that is often seen in flocks about mud puddles.

When I was a very small boy, I once caught a dozen of them, and made a little beehive to hold
them, thinking that they would settle down and make themselves at home, just like bees or pigeons.
But the grown-ups made me let them fly away, for the Sulphur is a kindly creature, and does
little or no harm.

One of the most beautiful things I ever came across, was, when about ten years old, I saw on
a fence stake ahead of me a big bird that was red, white and blue, with a flaming yellow fan-crest.
Then as I came closer, I knew that it was a red-headed woodpecker, with a Sulphur Butterfly
in his beak; this made the crest; what I thought was blue turned out to be his glossy black
back reflecting the blue sky.

3rd. The next is the Red Admiral or Nettle Butterfly. The "red" part of the name is right,
but why "Admiral"? I never could see unless it was misprint for "Admirable."

This beautiful insect lays its eggs and raises its young on nettles, and where nettles are,
there is the Red Admiral also. And that means over nearly all the world! Its caterpillar is
not very well protected with bristles, not at all when compared with the Woolly-bear, but it
lives in the nettles, and, whether they like it or not, the hospitable nettles with their stings
protect the caterpillar. The crawler may be grateful, but he shows it in a poor way, for he
turns on the faithful nettle, and eats it up. In fact the only food he cares about is nettle-salad,
and he indulges in it several times a day, yes all day long, eating, growing and bursting his
skin a number of times, till he is big enough to hang himself up for the winter, probably in
a nettle. Then next spring he comes forth, in the full dress uniform of a Red Admiral, gold
lace, red sash, silver braid and all.

4th. The last of the four is the Tiger Swallowtail. You are sure to see it some day--the big
yellow butterfly that is striped like a tiger, with peacock's feathers in its train, and two
long prongs, like a swallow-tail, to finish off with. It is found in nearly all parts of the
Eastern States and Canada. I saw great flocks of them on the Slave River of the North.

It is remarkable in that there are both blondes and brunettes among its ladies. The one shown
in the drawing is a blonde. The brunettes are so much darker as to be nearly black; and so
different that at one time everyone thought they were of a different kind altogether.

TALE 28

The Beautiful Poison Caterpillar

The lovely Io Moth is one that you will see early, and never forget, for it is common, and
ranges over all the country from Canada to the Gulf. When you see it, you will be inclined
to spell its name Eye-oh--for it has on each wing a splendid eye like that on a peacock's tail-feather,
while the rest of its dress is brown velvet and gold.

There is a strange chapter in the life of Io, which you should know because it shows that Mother
Carey never gives any wonderful gift to her creatures without also giving with it some equal
burden of sorrow.

This is how it all came about.

Long ago when the little ones of the Io Moth were small, they were, like most caterpillars,
very ugly little things. They felt very badly about it, and so they set out one day for the
great Home Place of Mother Carey in the Whispering Grove of the Ages.

There they prayed, "Dear Mother Carey, we are not of an ugly race, why should we be so ugly
as caterpillars? Will you not make us beautiful, for beauty is one of the best things of all?"

Mother Carey smiled and waved a finger toward a little Brownie, who came with a tray on which
were two cups; one full of bright sparkling pink stuff, and the other with something that looked
like dark green oil. But the glasses were joined at the top, there was but one place to drink,
and that reached both.

Then Mother Carey said, "These are the goblets of life, one is balm and will give you joy,
the other is gall and will give you suffering. You may drink little or much, but you must drink
equally of both. Now what would ye?"

The little ugly creatures whispered together, then one said: "Mother Carey, if we drink, will
it give us beauty?"

"Yes, my children, the red goblet of life will give you beauty, but with it the other will
give you grief."

They whispered together, then all the little crawlers went silently forward, and each took
a long drink of the double goblet.

Then they crawled away, and at once became the most beautiful of all caterpillars, brilliant
jewel-green with stripes of pink, velvet, and gold. Never before were there seen such exquisite
little crawlers.

But now a sad thing happened. They were so beautiful that many creatures became their enemies,
and began to kill them and eat them one after another. They crawled as fast as they could,
and hid away, but many of them were killed by birds and beasts of prey, as well as by big fierce
insects.

They did not know what to do, so next day the few that were left crawled back to the Grove
of Ages, and once more stood before Mother Carey.

"Well, my Beauty-crawlers," she said, "what would you?"

"Oh, Mother Carey, it is fearful, everyone seeks to destroy us. Most of us are killed, and
many of us wounded. Will you not protect us?"

"You drank of the two goblets, my children. I warned you that your beauty would bring terrible
trouble with it."

They bowed their little heads in silent sorrow, for they knew that that was true.

"Now," said the All-Mother, "do you wish to go back and be ugly again?"

They whispered together and said: "No, Mother Carey, it is better to be beautiful and die."

Then Mother Carey looked on them very kindly, and said: "Little ones, I love your brave spirit.
You shall not die. Neither shall you lose your beauty. I will give you a defence that will
keep off all your enemies but one, that is the Long-stinger Wasp, for you must in some way
pay for your loveliness." She waved her wand, and all over each of the Beauty-crawlers, there
came out bunches of sharp stickers like porcupine quills, only they were worse than porcupine
quills for each of the stickers was poisoned at the tip, so that no creature could touch the
Beauty-crawlers without being stung.

The birds and beasts let them alone now, or suffer a terrible punishment from the poison spears.
You children, too, must beware of them; touch them not, they will give you festering wounds.
There is only one creature now that the Beauty-crawlers truly fear; that is the Long-stinger
Wasp. He does indeed take toll of their race, but that is the price they still must pay for
their beauty. Did they not drink of the double goblet?

The Great Splendid Silk-Moth or Samia Cecropia

When I was a very small boy, I saw my father bring in from the orchard a ragged looking thing
like parchment wrapped up with some tangled hair; it was really the bundle-baby of this Moth.
He kept it all winter, and when the spring came, I saw for the first time the great miracle
of the insect world--the rag bundle was split open, and out came this glorious creature with
wings of red and brown velvet, embroidered with silver and spots that looked like precious
stones. It seemed the rarest thing in the world, but I have found out since, that it is one
of our common moths, and any of you can get one, if you take the trouble.

       *       *       *       *       *

Now listen, and you shall hear of what happened long ago to a green crawler who was born to
be a splendid Silk-Moth, but who spoiled it all by a bad temper.

It had been a very cold, wet summer, and one day, when the wind was whispering, he cried out:
"Mother Carey, when I have done with my working life, and go into the Great Sleep, grant that
it may never rain on me for I hate rain, and it has done nothing but pour all summer long."
And he shivered the red knobs on his head with peevishness.

"You silly little green crawler, don't you think I know better than you what is good for you?
Would you like there to be no rain?"

"Yes, I would," said the red-knobbed Samia rebelliously.

"Would you?" said the All-Mother to another green crawler, who hung on a near-by limb.

"Mother Carey, we have had a wet, cold summer, and the rain has been miserable, but I know
you will take care of us."

"Good," said the All-Mother: "then, in this way it shall be. You little Red-Knobs shall have
what you so much wish, you shall hang up in a dry loft where not a drop of dew even shall touch
you in your bundle-baby sleep. And you little Yellow-Knobs shall hang under a limb where every
rain that comes shall drench your outer skin." And she left them.

When the time came to hang up, Red-Knobs was led to a place as dry as could be, under a shed
and swung his bundle-baby hammock from the rafters.

Yellow-Knobs hung up his hammock under a twig in the rose garden.

The winter passed, and the springtime came with the great awakening day. Each of the bundle-babies
awoke from his hammock and broke his bonds. Each found his new wings, and set about shaking
them out to full size and shape. Those of the rain-baby came quickly to their proper form,
and away he flew to rejoice in perfect life. But though the other shook and shook, his wings
would not fluff out. They seemed dried up; they were numbed and of stunted growth.

Shake as he would, the wings stayed small and twisted. And as he struggled, a Butcher-bird
came by. His fierce eye was drawn by the fluttering purple thing. It had no power to escape.
He tore its crumpled wings from its feathery form, and made of it a meal. But before dying
it had time to say, "Oh, Mother Carey, now I know that your way was the best."

The Green Fairy with the Long Train

Some fairies are Brownies and some are Greenies, and of all that really and truly dance in
the moonlight right here in America, Luna Greenie seems the most wonderful; and this is her
history:

Once upon a time there was a seed pearl that dropped from the robe of a green fairy. It stuck
on the leaf of a butternut tree till one warm day Mother Carey, who knows all the wild things
and loves them all, touched it with her magic wand, called Hatch-awake, and out of the seed
pearl came an extraordinarily ugly little dwarf, crawling about on many legs. He was just as
greedy as he was ugly, and he ate leaf after leaf of the butternut tree, and grew so fat that
he burst his skin. Then a new skin grew, and he kept on eating and bursting until he was quite
big. But he had also become wise and gentle; he had learned many things, and was not quite
so greedy now.

Mother Carey, the All-Mother, had been watching him, and knew that now he was ready for the
next step up. She told him to make himself a hammock of rags and leaves, in the butternut tree.
When he had crawled into it, she touched him with her wand, the very same as the one she used
when she sent the Sleeping Beauty into her long sleep. Then that little dwarf went soundly
to sleep, hanging in his hammock.

But the hammock, with its sleeper, landed in a deep bed of leaves, and lay there all winter,
quite safe and warm.

Then when the springtime sun came over the hill, Mother Carey came a-riding on the Warm Wind,
and waving her wand. She stopped and kissed the sleeping bundle-baby, just as the Prince kissed
the Sleeping Beauty, and instantly the baby awoke. Then happened the strangest thing. Out of
that ragged old hammock there came the most wonderful and beautiful Green Fairy ever seen,
with wings and with two trains; and as it came out and looked shyly around, trembling with
new life, Mother Carey whispered, "Go to the butternut grove and see what awaits you there."

So away she went. Oh, how easy and glorious it is to fly! She could remember how once she used
to crawl everywhere. And through the soft sweet night she flew, as she was told, straight to
the butternut grove. As she came near she saw many green fairies--a great crowd of them--gathered
in the moonlight, and dancing round and round in fluttering circles, swooping about and chasing
each other, or hiding in the leaves. They did not feast, for these fairies never eat, and they
drink only honey from flowers. But there was a spirit of great joy over them all. And there
were some there with longer head plumes than those she wore. They seemed stronger and one of
them came with a glad greeting to the new Green Dancer and though she flew away, she was bursting
with joy that he should single her out. He pursued her till he caught her, and hand in hand
they danced together in the moonlight. She was happier than she had known it was possible to
be, and danced all night--that wonderful wedding dance. But she was very tired when morning
was near, and high in the tree she slept so soundly that she never noticed that many seed pearls
that were clustered on the lining of her robe had got loose and rolled into the crevices of
the trunk. There they lay until Mother Carey came to touch them with her magic wand, so each
became a crawler-dwarf, then a bundle-baby, and at last a dancing fairy.

But the Green Dancer did not know that--she knew only that it was a glorious thing to be alive,
and fly, and to dance in the moonlight.

       *       *       *       *       *

You must never fail to watch under the butternut tree on mid-summer nights, for it is quite
possible that you may see the wedding dance of the Luna Greenie and her sisters with the long-trained
robes.

The Wicked Hoptoad and the Little Yellow Dragon

Once upon a time, there was a beautiful little Yellow Dragon, who lived a happy and innocent
life on the high banks of a prattling stream. The Dragon himself was dumb but he loved a merry
noise, and nothing pleased him more than the prattling of the water. Sometimes this pleasant
little Dragon went up stream, where it was noisy, and sometimes he went down stream, where
it was very silent, and rested awhile in little pools. Here it was that he met with his first
enemy, a warty Hoptoad with jealous eyes. That Toad thought that he owned the pools because
he bathed there every springtime, and though it was a kind little Dragon, the Toad hated him,
and began to plot against him.

"Ho! little Yellow Dragon," he said, "you are very wonderful to see, and you must be very clever;
but you haven't got everything you want, have you?"

The Dragon smiled, shook his head, and made silent signs with his lips. Then the Toad understood,
for he said: "Ho-ho, I understand that you cannot speak. But are you happy?"

The Dragon smiled sweetly and nodded, then pointed to the stream.

That made the Toad madder than ever, for he thought it meant that the Dragon was claiming the
whole stream. So the Toad said: "See, Dragon, there is a wonderful food that you have never
tasted, that is a poached egg."

This he said with his heart full of guile, for he knew full well that poached eggs are deadly
poison to Dragons.

The Dragon looked puzzled, and the Toad said, "Have you?"

The Dragon shook his head. "Well," said the Toad, "it is the most delicious thing in the woods;
now you wait and see."

He went hoppity-hop, to a sand-bank where he had seen a Turtle lay its eggs that morning. He
dug out one. He rolled it upon a stone, and split it open with the sharp spur on his heel.
As soon as it was stiffened by the sun heat, he said, "Here now, Dragon, swallow it down, while
I get another for myself."

The poor innocent little Dragon did not know any better. He tried to swallow the poached egg.
The moment he did, it stuck in his throat, and poisoned him. At once his toes sank into the
ground. He turned green all over, and his head was changed into a strange new flower. There
it is to this day, standing silently where it can hear the brook a-prattling. Its body is green
all over, and its head is yellow and its jaws are wide open with a poached egg stuck in its
throat. And that is how it all came about. Some call it Toad Flax, and some call it Butter
and Eggs, but we who know how it happened call it the Dragon and the Poached Egg. 

Intrinsically his idea is sound, and I plead with all my heart for
a fair consideration of his schemes and for help in their development.

Mr. REX BEACH is one of the few prolific writers whose stories increase in power as they increase
in number, and this though they are essentially novels of action
rather than novels of thought.

Of his latest effort, The Winds of Chance (HODDER AND STOUGHTON), one may say that there is
not a tedious page in it. The scene is laid in Yukon, a very vortex of life and colour and
excitement in fiction, whatever it may seem to the actual inhabitants.
The true hero of the story, Napoleon Doret, the French voyageur, wins
his heart's desire in the end and we breathe a sigh of relief. Its body,
they said, was of green velvet with a satin-white throat; it had a long beak--at least an inch
long--a fan-tail of many feathers, two long plumes from its head, "the littlest feet you ever
have seen," and large lustrous eyes that seemed filled with human intelligence. "It jest looked
right at you, and seemed like a fairy looking at you."

The wonder grew. I made a sketch embodying all the points that my companions noted about the
Fairy Bird. The first drawing shows what it looked like, and also gives the exact size they
said it was.

It seemed a cruel wrong that let so many of them see the thing that was of chief interest to
me, yet left me out. It clearly promised a real fairy, an elfin bird, a wonderful messenger
from the land I hungered to believe in.

But at last my turn came. One afternoon two of the boys ran toward me, shouting: "Here it is,
the little Fairy Bird, right in the garden over the honeysuckle. C'mon, quick!"

I rushed to the place, more excited than I can tell. Yes, there it was, hovering over the open
flowers--tiny, wonderful, humming as it swung on misty wings. I made a quick sweep of my insect
net and, marvellous to relate, scooped up the Fairy Bird. I was trembling with excitement now,
not without a sense of wickedness that I should dare to net a fairy--practically an angel.
But I had done it, and I gloated over my captive, in the meshes. Yes, the velvet body and snowy
throat were there, the fan-tail, the plumes and the big dark eyes, but the creature was not
a bird; it was an insect! Dimly now I remembered, and in a few hours, learned, as I had feared,
that I had not captured a young angel or even a fairy--it was nothing but a Humming-bird Moth,
a beautiful insect--common in some regions, scarce in some, such as mine--but perfectly well
known to men of science and never afterward forgotten by any of that eager schoolboy group.

Ribgrass or Whiteman's-Foot

If you live in the country or in a small town, you will not have to go many steps, in summer
time, before you find the little plant known as Ribgrass, Plantain, or Whiteman's-foot. If
you live in a big city, you may find it in any grassy place, but will surely see it, as soon
as you reach the suburbs. It grows on the ground, wherever it can see the sun, and is easily
known by the strong ribs, each with a string in it when you pull the leaf apart. The Indians
call it Whiteman's-foot, not because it is broad and flat, but because it came from Europe
with the white man; it springs up wherever he sets his foot, and it has spread over all America.
Gardeners think it a troublesome weed; but the birds love its seed; canary birds delight in
it; and each plant of the Ribgrass may grow many thousands of seeds in a summer.

How many? Let us see! Take a seed-stalk of the Plantain and you will find it thickly set with
little cups, as in the drawing. Open one of these cups, and you find in it five seeds. Count
the cups; there are two hundred on this stalk, each with about five seeds, that is, one thousand
seeds; but the plant has five or more seed-stalks, some have more (one before me now has seventeen),
but suppose it has only ten; then there are 10,000 seeds each summer from one little plant.
Each seed can grow up into a new plant; and, if each plant were as far from the next as you
can step, the little ones in a row the following summer would reach for nearly six miles; that
is, from the City Hall to the end of Central Park, New York.[B]

On the third year if all had the full number of seed, and all the seed grew into plants, there
would be enough to go more than twice round the world. No wonder it has spread all over the
country.

Jack-in-the-Pulpit

Once upon a time there was a missionary named the Rev. John T. Arum, who set out to preach
to the Indians. He had a good heart but a bitter, biting tongue. He had no respect for the
laws of the Indians, so they killed him, and buried him in the woods. But out of his grave
came a new and wonderful plant, shaped like a pulpit, and right in the middle of it, as usual,
was the Reverend Jack hard at it, preaching away.

If you dig down under the pulpit you will find the preacher's body, or his heart, in the form
of a round root. Taste it and you will believe that the preacher had a terribly biting tongue,
but treat it properly, that is boil it, and you will find out that after all he had a good
little heart inside. Even the Indians have discovered his good qualities and have become very
fond of him.

TALE 35

How the Indian Pipe Came

In the last tale you learned the fate of the Rev. John T. Arum, and the origin of Jack-in-the-Pulpit.
But you must not suppose for a moment that the Indians decided in a hurry to kill the missionary.
No, they had too much sense of fair play for that. They held a great many councils first to
find some way of curbing his tongue, and making him mind his own business. In fact, they got
into the habit of holding a council every few minutes to discuss the question, no matter where
they were or what else they were doing. So that pretty nearly every part of the woods was in
time used for a council ring to discuss the fate of the Rev. John T. Arum.

Of course, you know that no Indian can hold a council without smoking the Peace Pipe, and when
the council is over, he empties out the ashes of the pipe. So that when all those councils
were over, when the matter was settled, when the missionary was buried, and when the warrior
had gone to the ghost land, there came solemnly poking its white bowl and stem from under the
leaves an Indian pipe, at the very spot where the Councillors had emptied the ashes. It is
a beautifully shaped pipe, with a curved and feathered stem, but it has none of the bright
colours of the old Peace Pipe. It cannot have them for this is only a ghost Pipe to show where
the council used to be; and one pipe there is for each council held on that spot, so you see
how many, many councils the Indians had, before they killed the troublesome preacher. Ladywell is, at
any rate, bent on thinking so. . . . It might have been made known to him in a gentle way--but
God disposes.'

'There is nothing to make known--I don't understand,' said Ethelberta,
going from him.

By this time Ladywell had walked round the gravel walks with the two other ladies and Mr. Belmaine,
and they were all turning to come back again.

The young painter had deputed his voice to reply to their remarks, but his understanding continued
poring upon other things. When he came up to Ethelberta, his agitation had left him: she too
was free from constraint; while Neigh was some distance off, carefully examining nothing in
particular in an old fragment of wall.

The little party was now united again as to its persons; though in spirit far otherwise. They went
through the church in general talk, Ladywell sad but serene, and Ethelberta keeping far-removed
both from him and from Neigh. She had at this juncture entered upon that Sphinx-like stage of
existence in which, contrary to her earlier manner, she signified to no one of her ways, plans,
or sensations, and spoke little on any subject at all.

There were occasional smiles now which came only from the face, and speeches from the lips
merely.

The journey home was performed as they had come, Ladywell not accepting the seat in Neigh's
cab which was phlegmatically offered him.

Mrs. Doncastle's acquaintance with Ethelberta had been slight until
this day; but the afternoon's proceeding had much impressed the matron
with her younger friend.

Before they parted she said, with the sort of affability which is
meant to signify the beginning of permanent friendship: 'A friend
of my husband's, Lord Mountclere, has been anxious for some time to
meet you.

He is a great admirer of the poems, and more still of the story-telling invention, and your
power in it. He has been present many times at the Mayfair Hall to hear you. When will you dine
with us to meet him? I know you will like him. Will Thursday be convenient?'

Ethelberta stood for a moment reflecting, and reflecting hoped that Mrs. Doncastle had not noticed
her momentary perplexity.

Crises were becoming as common with her as blackberries; and she had foreseen this one a long
time. It was not that she was to meet Lord Mountclere, for he was only a name and a distant profile
to her: it was that her father would necessarily be present at the meeting, in the most anomalous
position that human nature could endure.

However, having often proved in her disjointed experience that the shortest way out of a difficulty
lies straight through it, Ethelberta decided to dine at the Doncastles',
and, as she murmured that she should have great pleasure in meeting
any friend of theirs, set about contriving how the encounter with
her dearest relative might be made safe and unsuspected.

She bade them adieu blithely; but the thoughts engendered by the invitation stood before her
as sorrowful and rayless ghosts which could not be laid.

Often at such conjunctures as these, when the futility of her great
undertaking was more than usually manifest, did Ethelberta long like
a tired child for the conclusion of the whole matter; when her work
should be over, and the evening come; when she might draw her boat
upon the shore, and in some thymy nook await eternal night with a
placid mind.

28. ETHELBERTA'S--MR. CHICKEREL'S ROOM

The question of Neigh or no Neigh had reached a pitch of insistence
which no longer permitted of dallying, even by a popular beauty.

His character was becoming defined to Ethelberta as something very differently composed from that
of her first imagining.

She had set him down to be a man whose external in excitability owed nothing to self-repression,
but stood as the natural surface of the mass within. Neigh's urban torpor, she said, might have
been in the first instance produced by art, but, were it thus, it had gone so far as to permeate
him.


But the most thrilling thing of all that he saw was one day as the sun went down, a winged
being of dazzling beauty alighted for a moment on his hickory tree. Never had the Horn-devil
seen such a dream of loveliness. Her slender body was clad in rose velvet, and her wings were
shining with gold. The very sight of her made him hate himself, yet he could not resist the
impulse to crawl nearer, to gaze at her beauty.

But her eyes rested a moment on his horrible shape, and she fled in fear, while a voice near
by said: "The Spangled Queen does not love poisonous reptiles." Then the poor little Horn-devil
wished he were dead. He hid away from sight for three days. Hunger however forced him out,
and as he was crawling across a pathway, a man who came along was going to crush him underfoot,
but Mother Carey whispered, "No, don't do it." So the man let him live, but roughly kicked
the worm aside, and bruised him fearfully.

Then came Mother Carey and said: "Well, little ugly worm! Is your spirit strong, or angry?"

The worm said bravely, though feebly: "Mother, Mother Carey, I am trying to be strong. I want
to win."

The breezes were losing their gentle warmth when Mother Carey came to him one day, and said:
"Little one, your trial has been long, but it is nearly over.

"Prepare to sleep now, my little horny one, you have fought a brave fight; your reward is coming.
Because your soul has been made beautiful by your suffering, I will give you a body blazing
with such beauty as shall make all stand in adoration when you pass." Then Mother Earth said,
"Our little one shall have extra care because he has had extra trials." So the tired little
Horn-devil did not even have to make himself a hammock, for Mother Earth received him and he
snuggled into her bosom. As Mother Carey waved her wand, he dropped off asleep. And he slept
for two hundred days.

Then came the great Awakening Day, the resurrection day of the woods. Many new birds arrived.
Many new flowers appeared. Sleepers woke from underground, as Mother Carey's silent trumpeters
went bugling ahead of her, and her winged horse, the Warm Wind, came sweeping across the meadows,
with the white world greening as he came.

The bundle-baby of the Horn-devil woke up. He was cramped and sleepy, but soon awake. Then
he knew that he was a prisoner, bound up in silken cords of strength. But new powers were his
now, he was able to break the cords and crawl out of his hole. He put up his feelers to find
those horrible horns, but they were gone, and his devil form fell off him like a mask. He had
wings, jewelled wings! on his back now. Out he came to fluff the newfound wings awhile, and
when they were spread and supple he flew into the joyful night, one of the noblest of all the
things that fly, gorgeous in gold and velvet, body and wings; filled with the joy of life and
flight, he went careering through the soft splendour of the coming night. And as he flew, he
glimpsed a radiant form ahead, a being like himself, with wings of velvet and gold. At first
he thought it was the Princess of the Hickory Tree, but now his eyes were perfect, and he could
see that this was a younger and more beautiful Spangled Princess than the one of his bygone
life, and all his heart was filled with the blazing fire of love. Fearlessly now he flew to
overtake her; for was she not of his own kind? She sped away, very fast at first, but maybe
she did not go as fast as she could, for soon he was sailing by her side. At first she turned
away a little, but she was not cross or frightened now. She was indeed inclined to play and
tease. Then in their own language, he asked her to marry him, and in their own language she
said, "yes." Away they flew and flew on their wedding flight, high in the trees in the purple
night, glorious in velvet and gold, more happy than these printed words can tell.

The wise men who saw them said, "There go the Royal Citheronia and his bride." And Mother Carey
smiled as she saw their bliss, and remembered the Hickory Horn-devil.

The Purple and Gold of Autumn

There was once an old gentleman named Father Time, and he had four beautiful daughters.

The eldest was called Winter Time. She was tall and pale. She dressed chiefly in white wool
trimmed with wonderful lacework. She was much admired by some, but others considered her very
cold and distant. And most agreed that she was the least winsome of the sisters.

The second one was called Spring Time, and she was dressed in beautiful golden-green satin.
She had a gentle, sunny disposition; some thought her the loveliest.

The third was Summer Time, and her robe was dark-green velvet. She was warm-hearted and most
attractive, full of life and energy, and as unlike the eldest sister as possible.

The youngest was Autumn Time. She certainly was a wonderful creature, with red rosy cheeks,
plump form, and riotous good spirits. Her robes were gorgeous and a little extravagant, for
she wore a new one every day, and of all that she had, the one that she loved the best and
wore the latest was of purple and gold. We can go out in October and see the purple and gold,
and gather some scraps of the robe, for it is on every wayside and every hillside.

Why the Chicadee Goes Crazy Twice a Year

A long time ago, when it was always summer in our woods, the Chicadees lived merrily with their
cousins, and frolicked the whole year round. But one day Mother Carey sent the small birds
a warning that they must move to the South, when the leaves fell from the trees, for hard frost
and snow were coming, and maybe starvation too.

All the cousins of the Chicadees listened to the warning and got ready to go; but Tomtit, their
leader, only laughed and turned a dozen wheels around a twig that served him for a bar.

"Go to the South?" said he. "Not I; I am too happy here; and as for frost and snow, I never
saw any, and I don't believe there are such things."

Very soon the leaves fell from the trees and the Nut-hatches and the King-wrens were so busy
getting ready to go that the Chicadees left off play for a minute, to ask questions. They were
not pleased with the answer they got, for the messenger had said that all of them were to take
a long, long journey that would last for days, and the little King-wrens had actually to go
as far as the Gulf of Mexico. Besides, they were to fly by night, to avoid their enemies, the
Hawks, and the weather at this season was sure to be stormy. So the Chicadees said it was all
nonsense, and went off, singing and chasing one another through the woods, led by Tomtit singing
a new song in which he made fun of the travellers.

        Tom Tom Tiddy-Mouse!
        Hid away in our house,
        Hid his brother in the cellar,
        Wasn't he a silly feller?

But their cousins were quite serious. They picked out wise leaders and formed themselves into
bands. They learned that they must follow their leader, they must twitter as they flew in the
darkness, so as to let those behind know where\he leaders were; they must follow the great
rivers southward; they must wait for a full moon before starting, and never travel by day.

The noisy, rollicking Chicadees continued to make fun of their cousins as they saw them now
gathering in the woods along the river; and at length, when the moon was big, bright, and full,
the cousins arose to the call of the leaders and all flew away in the gloom. The Chicadees
said that all the cousins were crazy, made some good jokes about the Gulf of Mexico, and then
dashed away on their favourite game of tag and tumble through the woods, which, however, did
seem rather quiet now, and bare of leaves; while the weather, too, was certainly turning uncomfortably
cool.

At length the frost and snow really did come, and the Chicadees were in a bad way. Indeed,
they were frightened out of their wits, and dashed hither and thither, seeking in vain for
some one to set them aright on the way to the warm land. They flew wildly about the woods,
till they were truly crazy. I suppose there was not a squirrel-hole or a hollow log in the
neighbourhood that some Chicadee did not enter to inquire if this was the Gulf of Mexico. But
no one could tell anything about it, no one was going that way, and the great river was hidden
under ice and snow.

About this time a messenger from Mother Carey was passing with a message to the Caribou in
the Far North; but all he could tell the Chicadees was that he could not be their guide, as
he had other business. "Besides," he said, "you had the same notice as your cousins whom you
called 'crazy.' And from what I know of Mother Carey, you will probably have to stick it out
here all through the snow, not only now, but in every winter after this; so you may as well
make the best of it."

This was sad news for the Chicadee Tomtits; but they were brave little fellows, and seeing
they could not help themselves, they went about making the best of it. Before a week had gone
by they were in their usual good spirits again, scrambling about the snowy twigs, or chasing
one another as before.

They were glad to remember now that Mother Carey said that winter would end. They told each
other about it so much that even at its beginning, when a fresh blizzard came on, they would
gleefully remark to one another that it was a "sign of spring," and one or another of the flock
would lift his voice in the sweet little chant that we all know so well:

Another would take it up and answer back:

and they would keep on repeating the song until the dreary woods rang again with the good news,
and the wood-people learned to love the brave little bird that sets his face so cheerfully,
to meet so hard a case.

And winter did end. Spring did come at last. And the sign of its coming was when the ice broke
on the stream and the pussy willow came purring out above it. The air was full of the good
news. The Chicadees felt it, and knew it through and through. They went mad with joy, chasing
each other round and round the trees and through the hollow logs, shouting "The spring is here,
the spring is here, Hurree, Hurree, Hurree," and in another week their joyous lives were going
on as before the trouble came.

But to this day, when the chill wind blows through the deserted woods, the Chicadees seem to
lose their wits for a few days, and dart into all sorts of queer places. They may then be found
in great cities, or open prairies, cellars, chimneys, and hollow logs; and the next time you
find one of the wanderers in any out-of-the-way corner, be sure to remember that the Chicadee
goes crazy twice a year, in the fall and in the spring, and probably went into his strange
hole or town in search of the Gulf of Mexico.

The Story of the Quaking Aspen or Poplar

The leaf of the Quaking Asp is like the one marked "a" in the drawing. Its trunk is smooth,
greenish, or whitish, with black knots of bark like "c". All the farmers know it as Popple,
or White Poplar; but the hunters call it Quaking Asp or Aspen.

The name "quaking" was given because it is for ever shaking its leaves; the slightest wind
sets them all rustling. They move so easily because each leaf-stem is like a thin, flat strap
set on edge; while the leaf-stem of such as the oak is nearly round and scarcely rustles at
all. Why does the Quaking Asp do this? No doubt, because it lives in places where the hot dust
falls thick on the leaves at times, and if it did not have some trick of shaking it off, the
leaf would be choked and bent so that the tree could scarcely breathe; for the leaves are the
lungs of the trees. So remember, when the Poplar rustles loudly, it is coughing to clear its
lungs of the dust.

Some trees try to hide their troubles, and quickly cover up their wounds; but the Aspen has
a very touchy skin and, once it is wounded, it shows the scar as long as it lives. We can,
therefore, go to any Aspen tree, and have it tell us the story of its life. Here is the picture
of one. The black marks at the forks (c) are scars of growth; the belts of dots (d) were wounds
given by a sapsucker to rob it of its sap; the flat places (e) show where a Red Squirrel gnawed
off the outer bark.

If a Raccoon climbed the tree (f), or an insect bored into the trunk, we are sure to see a
record of it in this sensitive bark.

Now, last of all, the paper on which this story is printed was likely made out of Aspen wood.

The Witch-hazel

These are the things to make you remember the Witch-hazel; its forked twig was used--nay, still
is used--as a magic rod to show where there is running water underground; that is, where it
is possible to find water by sinking a well. Its nuts are explosive, and go off with a snap,
shooting the seeds that are inside, ten or twenty feet away, when the cold dry days of autumn
come. Third, its curious golden-thread flowers appear in the fall.

As Cracked Jimmy used to sing:-

        Witch-hazel blossoms in the fall,
        To cure the chills and fevers all.
                      --Two Little Savages.

On November 16, 1919, after a sharp frost, I went out in the morning to get some Witch-hazel
flowers for this drawing, and found them blooming away in the cold air, vigorously as ever.
Imagine a flower that can bloom while it is freezing. In the drawing I have shown the flower,
like a 4-lipped cup with four yellow snakes coiling out of it.

But these are not the deadly snakes one hears about. They are rather symbols of old Æsculapius,
the famous healer of the long ago, whose emblem was the cup of life with curling snakes of
wisdom about it. In the Witch-hazel has been found a soothing balm for many an ache and pain.
The Witch-hazel you buy in the drugstores, is made out of the bark of this tree. If you chew
one of the little branches you will know it by the taste.

Near the top is a flower that is finished, its snakes have fled; and at the top of all is a
bud for next year. That is, they are--is, has-been and going-to-be. The nuts are shown in the
corner.

Note, last of all, that it is a sociable little tree; it always goes with a crowd. There are
generally three or four Witch-hazels from one root, and there is always a family of cousins
not far away.

How the Shad Came and How the Chestnut Got Its Burrs

In the woods of Poconic there once roamed a very discontented Porcupine. She was forever fretting.
She complained that everything was wrong, till it was perfectly scandalous, and Wahkonda, the
Great Spirit, getting tired of her grumbling, said:

"You and the world I have made don't seem to fit; one or the other must be wrong. It is easier
to change you. You don't like the trees, you are unhappy on the ground, and think everything
is upside down, therefore I'll turn you inside out, and put you in the water." And so the Porcupine
was turned into a new creature, a fish, called the Shad. That is why he is so full of little
sharp bones.

Then after the old Porcupine had been turned into a Shad, the young ones missed their mother,
and crawled up into a high Chestnut tree to look for her coming. Wahkonda happened to pass
that way, and they all chattered their teeth at him, thinking themselves safe. They were not
wicked, but at heart quite good, only badly brought up; oh, so ill-trained, and some of them
chattered and groaned as Wahkonda came nearer. Then Wahkonda was sorry for them, remembering
that he had taken their mother from them, and said: "You look very well up there, you little
Porkys, so you had better stay there for always, and be part of the Chestnut tree." And he
touched each one with his magic wand and turned it into a burr that grew tight to the tree.
That is how it came about. There they hang like a lot of little Porcupines on the twigs of
the tree. They are spiney and dangerous, utterly without manners, and yet most of them have
a good little heart inside.

TALE 43

How the Littlest Owl Came

After the Great Spirit had made the world and the creatures in it, he made the Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo.
This was like an Owl, but bigger than anything else alive, and his voice was like a river plunging
over a rocky ledge. He was so big that he thought he had done it all himself, and he became
puffed up. He forgot the Great Spirit, who decided to teach him a lesson in this wise:

He called the Blue-jay, the mischief-maker of the woods, and told him what to do. Away went
the Blue-jay to the mountain at the top of which was the Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo making thunder
in his throat. The Blue-jay flew up to his ear, and said: "Pooh, Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo, you don't
call that a big noise! You should hear Niagara; then you would never twitter again."

The Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo was so mad at hearing his big wonderful song called a twitter, that
he said: "Niagara, Niagara! I'm sick of hearing about Niagara. I will go and silence Niagara
with my voice." So he flew to Niagara while the Blue-jay snickered and followed to see the fun.

Now when Niagara Falls was made the Great Spirit said to it, "Flow on for ever." That last
word of the Great Spirit it took up as it rushed on, and never ceases to thunder out "For ever!
For ever! For ever!"

When they came to Niagara the mighty cataract, the Blue-jay said, "Now, Gitchee, you can beat
that I am sure." So Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo began bawling to drown the noise of it, but could not
make himself heard.

"Wa-wa-wa," said the Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo, with great effort and only for a few heart beats.

"For ever, For ever, For ever," thundered the river, steadily, easily, ceaselessly.

"Wa-wa-wa--!" shrieked Gitchee O-kok-o-hoo; but his voice was so utterly lost that he could
not hear it himself, and he began to feel small, and smaller; and as he began to feel small,
a strange thing happened--he began to get small and smaller, until he was no bigger than a
Sparrow; and his voice, instead of being like a great cataract, became like the dropping of
water, just a little

        Tink-tank-tink,
        Tink-tank-tink.

And this is why the Indians give to this smallest of the Owls the name of "The Water-dropping
Bird," who was once the greatest of all creatures, but is now shrunk to be the littlest of
the Owls, because he became proud and forgot the Great Spirit.

The Wood-witch and the Bog-nuts

Once upon a time there was a rich boy, who knew all about the city, and nothing about the woods.
He went for an outing into the wilderness, and got lost. He wandered all day until he was very
tired and hungry. The sun was low when he came to a little pathway. He followed it, and it
led to a small log cabin. When he knocked, an old woman opened the door. He said, "Please,
Ma'am, I am lost and very hungry, will you give me something to eat?"

The old woman looked sharply at his clothes, and knew that he was rich, so she said: "Poor
people are wise, they can take care of themselves in the woods. They don't get lost. But you
rich people are fools, and I wish you would go away."

"I will, if you'll give me something to eat," he answered.

Then the old woman said: "Listen, foolish rich boy, in the woods beside you right now is a
friend who feeds the poor people, maybe she will feed you. She is tall and slim, her eyes are
brownish purple and her hair is green, and by this you may know her--she has five fingers on
one hand and seven on the other. Her house is in the brier thicket; she climbs to the roof
and stands there all day waving her hands, and shouting out in wood-talk, 'There are cocoanuts
in my cellar.'

"Now go and find her, maybe she will feed you. She always feeds us poor folks," and the witch
slammed the door.

The boy was puzzled. As he stood in doubt, there was a loud noise, and his friends arrived.
They brought him the food and comfort that he needed.

Then he said: "I wish to know what that old wood-witch meant by the lady with the purple eyes
and green hair." So he went again to the log cabin and knocked.

When the old woman came, and saw a lot of people about, she was frightened for she knew she
had been unkind. But the boy said: "Now Granny, you needn't be afraid, I want you to show me
the friend that has seven fingers and a cellar full of cocoanuts."

"I'll show you, if you promise to do me no harm," she answered.

"Of course, I'll promise," replied the boy.

Then Granny Wood-witch went hobbling to the nearest thicket and cackled out loud, as she pointed
out a trailing vine that had sometimes five leaflets on a stalk and sometimes seven. "See,
see, that's the lady. See seven fingers on that hand and five on this. Now follow her feet
down and dig in the ground."

They dug and found strings of lovely brown nuts as big as walnuts.

"See, see," chuckled the wood-witch. "See the cocoanuts in the cellar."

       *       *       *       *       *

Go forth and look for it, ye Woodcrafters. You will find it throughout Eastern America on the
edge of every wood. Its flower is like a purple-brown sweet-pea, and is in bloom all summer
long. Follow down its vine, dig out a few of the potatoes or nuts, and try them, raw, boiled,
or if ye wish to eat them as Indian Cake, clean them, cut them in slices, dry till hard, pound
them up into meal, and make a cake the same as you would of oatmeal.

The wild things love them, the Indians love them, and this was the bread of the wood-witch.
The books call it Bog Potato and Ground Nuts. It is the third secret of the woods.

The Mud-dauber Wasp

If you look under the roof of any wooden barn in Eastern America you are likely to see the
nest of the common Mud-wasp.

If you look on warm sunny days along the edge of some mud puddle you are sure to see a curious
steel-blue wasp, with a very thin waist, working away at a lump of mud. She seems to be breathing
hard with her body, as she works with her yellow legs, but she finally goes off laden with
a gob of mud. This is the Mud-wasp at work, building a strong mud-nest for her family. The
nest is the one we have seen hung under the roof of the shed, always put where no rain can
reach it.

In the drawing are two of these nests.

Once the cradle is ready, the mother Wasp goes spider-hunting. Whenever she can find a spider,
she pounces on it, and with her sting, she stabs it in the body, so as to paralyze it, but
not kill it. Then she carries it to the mud cell and packs it in, at the far end. Many spiders
are caught and preserved this way, for they do not usually die though they cannot move.

When the cell is full, the Wasp lays an egg on the last spider, and seals up the opening with
a mud lid.

Very soon the egg hatches out a little white grub which begins on the spider next to him, eating
the legs first, and the body last, so as to keep it alive as long as possible, though of course
the spider has no feeling. Then he eats the next spider, and the next, growing as he eats,
until he nearly fills the cell, and the spiders are all eaten up.

Now the grub goes to sleep, and next spring comes out as a full-grown Mud-wasp to do exactly
as the mother did, though it never saw that Mother or had a lesson from any one in the many
strange things it must do to live.

I went into my boat-house to-day, November 20, 1919, to get a mud nest for this drawing. There
were 86 on the roof; some of them with 20 or 30 cells, and besides there was a lot of paper
nests by other Wasps. The nest I took had two cells, one open and empty, and the other with
a mud lid on tight. This held a long, shiny brown transparent case, in which was a white grub
much too small for the big coat he was wearing. The grub was sound asleep, and would have come
out next spring, as a big steel-blue Mud-wasp had I let him alone. But there are plenty of
Mud-wasps so I fed him to the Chicadees, which likely is what Mother Carey would have done.

TALE 46

The Cicada and the Katydid

Once upon a time, long, long ago, the birds whose job it was to make the woods merry with their
songs, decided to go on strike. They said, "We have sung all day, all springtime, and half
way through the summer, but now we are moulting, the weather is frightfully hot; we need a
rest, and we are going to stop singing, to take a holiday."

Then Dame Nature, who is sometimes called the All-mother, or Mother Carey, said: "Dear me,
this will never do! No songbirds, woods silent all through the dog-days. Now who will be strike-breakers
and volunteer to supply the music till the birds get once more in a good humour?"

Then up at that question got a long-winged insect like a big fly, and a long-legged insect
like a green grasshopper, and both said at once, "I will." Amid low murmurs of "Scab! Scab!"
from many of the Wood-birds.

"You. I forgot that you two had any voices at all!" said Mother Carey.

Then the long-winged creature, whose name is Cicada, began, "True, my voice isn't much, but
I have invented a most successful musical Castanet. Listen!"

Then he began an extraordinary racket like an alarm clock, a threshing machine, and a buzz-saw
all going together. He filled the grove with his noise, and set all the woodfolk laughing with
his funny performance. Though, of course, he didn't mean to be funny; he thought it was fine.

Then as the Cicada ceased, Mother Carey said to the Green Hopper, whose name was Katy, "Now,
Katy, what can you do?"

"I do not brag of my voice, dear Mother," said she, "but I am a thrilling performer on the violin."

Then she humped herself up over a green fiddle that she had under her cloak, and nearly deafened
them with its hoarse screechings.

There was no doubt that these two could make as much noise as a wood full of birds; both were
eager to take sole charge, and a bitter dispute arose as to whose idea it was first.

But Mother Carey settled it by dividing the time. "You," she said to Cicada, "can take charge
of the music by day, and you," she said to the Green one, "must take it up at sundown in place
of the nightingale, and keep it up, till the night breaks, and both of you continue till the
frost comes, or until the birds are back on the job."

That is how it all came about.

But there is considerable feeling yet among the Katies, that they should get all the night
work, and never be seen performing. They think that their ancestor was the original inventor
of this cheap substitute for bird song. And it is made all the worse by a division among themselves.
Some say "she did" and some say "she didn't." If you notice in early August, they are nearly
all shouting, "Katy-did." Then by the end of the month, "Katy-didn't" is stronger. In September
it is still mixed. In October their work is over, the chorus ended, but you hear an occasional
"Katy-did" and finally as late as Indian Summer, which is Hallowe'en, I have heard the last
of the fiddlers rasp out "she did"; and do it in daytime, too, as though to flout the followers
of Cicada. And, if the last word be truth, as they say, we may consider it settled, that Katy
really and truly did. And yet I believe next year the same dispute will arise, and we shall
have the noisy argument all over again.

If you look at the portraits of Cicada, the Hotweather-bug or Locust, and of the Katydid, you
will not see their musical instruments very plainly, but believe me they have them; and you
can hear them any late summer hot-weather time, in any part of the Eastern States and some
parts of southern Canada.

And now let me finish with a secret. Katy is not a lady at all, but a he-one disguised in green
silk stockings, and a green satin dress.

The Digger Wasp that Killed the Cicada

Strange things are done in the realm of Mother Carey; strange things and cruel. At least so
they seem to us, for we do not know the plan that is behind them. We know only that sometimes
love must be cruel. I am going to tell you of a strange happening, that you may see any hot
day in August. And this is how it came about.

At that meeting in the woods when the Cicada and the Katydid undertook to be musicians, while
the birds were on strike, there was one strong insect who gave off an angry "Bizz, Bizz" that
sounded like "Scab, Scab." That was the big yellow-and-black Digger Wasp, the biggest of the
wasps, with a sting that is as bad as that of a baby rattlesnake. And that very day she declared
war on the Cicada and his kind. The Katydids she could not touch, because the Wasp cannot see
at night.

But the Cicada was easy to find. As soon as the day got hot, and that awful buzzing began in
the trees, the Big Digger got her sting ready, and went booming along in the direction of the
sound.

Now Mother Carey had given the Cicada bright eyes and strong wings, and it was his own business
to take care of himself; but he was so pleased with his music that he never saw the fierce
Digger Wasp, till she charged on him. And before he could spread his wings, she had stabbed
him through.

His song died away in a few shrieks, and then the Cicada lay still. But not dead, for the Digger
had stuck her poison dagger into the nerve centre, so that he was paralyzed and helpless, but
still living.

Now the Digger set about a plan. She wanted to get that Cicada body into her den, to feed her
young ones with it. But the Cicada was bigger and heavier than she was, so that she could not
carry it. However, she was bent on doing it, she got all ready, took tight hold with her claws,
then swooped from the tree, flying as strongly as she could, till the weight of the Cicada
brought her to the ground within fifty feet, while the den was fully a hundred feet away. But
the Wasp dragged the Cicada up the trunk of another tree, then took another long sloping flight
as before. One more climb and skid down, brought her to her den--a hole in a bank that she
had dug out; that is why she is called the Digger Wasp. The passage was a foot long and had
a crook in the middle. At the end was a round room an inch and a half high. Here the Digger
left her victim's body and right on its breast, to one side, laid an egg.

This hatched in two or three days, and began to feed on the Cicada. In a week it had eaten
the Cicada and grown to be a big fat grub. Then it spun a cocoon, and made itself into a bundle-baby,
resting all autumn and all winter in that dark den.

But when the spring came with its glorious wakening up, great changes came over the bundle-baby
of the Digger. It threw off the cocoon and its outer skin, and came forth from the gloom into
the sunshine, a big strong Digger Wasp with a sting of its own, and a deadly feud with all
screaming Cicadas. Although it never saw its mother, or got any lessons from her, it goes after
the buzzing hotweather-bugs, when August comes, and treats them exactly as she did.

How the Indian Summer Came

Wahkonda, the Great Spirit, the Ruler of the World, had found pleasure the whole summer long
in making mountains, lakes, and forests. Then when the autumn came, and the leaves fell from
the trees, He lighted His pipe and sat down to look over the things He had made.

As He did so, the north wind arose for Cold Time was coming, and blew the smoke and ashes of
the pipe into His face. Then He said: "Cease your blowing, all ye winds, until I have finished
smoking." So, of course, there was dead calm.

Wahkonda smoked for ten days, and during all that time there were no clouds in the sky, for
there was no wind to bring them; there was unbroken, calm sunny weather. But neither was there
any wind to carry off the smoke, so it hung, as the teepee smoke hangs at sunrise, and it drifted
over the valleys and forests in a blue haze.

Then at last when the Great Spirit finished His smoke and His meditation, He emptied out His
pipe. That was the signal, the north wind broke loose, and came howling down from the hills,
driving the leaves before it, and warning all wild things to be ready, for soon there would
be winter in the woods.

And it hath been so ever since. When the leaves have fallen and before yet the Ice-king is
here, there come, for a little while, the calm dreamy days, when the Great Spirit is smoking
His pipe, and the smoke is on the land. The Red-men call them the Smoking Days, but we call
it Indian Summer.

The North Star, or the Home Star

If you are going to be a Woodcrafter, you must begin by knowing the North Star, because that
is the star which will show you the way home, if you get lost in the woods at night. That is
why the Indians call it the "Home Star."

But first, I must tell you how it came to be, and the story begins a long, long time ago.

In those far-off days, we are told, there were two wonderful hunters, one named Orion, and
the other named Boötes (Bo-o-tees). Orion hunted everything and I shall have to leave him for
another story. Boötes was an ox-driver and only hunted bears to save his cattle. One day he
went after a Mother Bear, that had one little cub.

He chased them up to the top of a mountain so high, that they leaped off into the sky, and
just as they were going, Boötes shot his arrows after them. His very first arrow hit the Little
Bear in the tail--they had long tails in those days--and pinned him to the sky. There he has
hung ever since, swinging round and round, on the arrow in his tail, while his mother runs
bawling around him, with Boötes and his dogs chasing her. He shot arrows into her tail, which
was long and curved, into her body, and into her shoulder. Seven big arrows he shot, and there
they are yet, in the form of a dipper pointing always to the cub who is called the "Little
Bear." The shining head of the big arrow in the end of the Little Bear's tail is called the
North Star or Pole Star. You can always tell which is the North Star, by the two Pointers;
these are the two bright stars that make the outer side of the Dipper on the Big Bear's shoulder.
A line drawn through them, points out the North Star.

The Dipper, that is the Big Bear, goes round and round the Pole Star, once in about twenty-four
hours; so that sometimes the Pointers are over, sometimes under, to left or to right; but always
pointing out the Pole Star or North Star.

This star shows nearly the true north; and, knowing that, a traveller can find his way in any
strange country, so long as he can see this friendly Home Star.

The Pappoose on the Squaw's Back

Now that you know how the Bears and the Big Dipper came, you should know the Indian story of
the Old Squaw.

First find the bright star that is at the bend of the Dipper handle. This is called the "Old
Squaw"; on her back is a tiny star that they call "The Pappoose."

As soon as an Indian boy is old enough to understand, his mother takes him out into the night
when it is calm and clear, and without any moon or any bright lights near, and says, "My child,
yonder is the Old Squaw, the second of the seven stars; she is going over the top of the hill;
on her back she carries her pappoose. Tell me, my child, can you see the pappoose?"

Then the little redskin gazes, and from his mother's hand he takes two pebbles, a big one and
a little one, and he sets them together on her palm, to show how the two stars seem to him.
When the mother is sure that he did see them clearly, she rejoices. She goes to the fire and
drops a pinch of tobacco into it, for incense to carry her message, then looking toward the
sky she says: "Great Spirit, I thank Thee that my child has the eyes of a hunter."

       *       *       *       *       *

These things are not new, O Woodcrafter. The wise men of our race call the Big Star "Mizar"
one of the chariot horses, and the little star "Alcor" or the Rider. In all ages it has been
considered proof of first-class eyes, to see this little star. Can you see it? Have you the
eyes of a hunter?

Orion the Hunter, and His Fight With the Bull

In the 49th Tale I told you there were two giants among the mighty hunters in the sky, Boötes,
whose adventure with the Bears you have already heard, and Orion. (O-ry´-on).

Orion was the most famous of all. In his day men had no guns; they had nothing but clubs, spears,
and arrows to fight with, and the beasts were very big and fierce as well as plentiful, yet
Orion went whenever he was needed, armed chiefly with his club, fought the wild beasts, all
alone, killing them or driving them out, and saving the people, for the joy of doing it. Once
he killed a lion with his club, and ever afterward wore the lion's skin on his arm. Bears were
as nothing to him; he killed them as easily as most hunters would rabbits, but he found his
match, when he went after a ferocious wild Bull as big as a young elephant.

As soon as the Bull saw him, it came rushing at him. It happened to be on the other side of
a stream, and as it plunged in, Orion drew his bow and fired seven quick shots at the Bull's
heart. But the monster was coming head on, and the seven arrows all stuck in its shoulder,
making it madder than ever. So Orion waved his lion skin in his left hand, and with his club
in the right, ran to meet the Bull, as it was scrambling up the bank from the water.

The first whack of the club tumbled the Bull back into the water, but it turned aside, went
to another place, and charged again. And again Orion landed a fearful blow with the club on
the monster's curly forehead.

By this time, all the animals had gathered around to see the big fight, and the gods in heaven
got so interested that they shouted out, "Hold on, that is good enough for us to see. Come
up here."

So they moved the mighty Hunter and the Bull, and the River and all the animals, up to heaven,
and the fight has gone on there ever since.

In the picture I have shown a lot of animals besides Orion and the Bull, but the only things
I want you to look now in the sky, are Orion's belt with the three stars on it, and the Pleiades
on the Bull's shoulder, the seven spots where the seven arrows struck.

And remember these stars cannot be seen in summer, they pass over us in winter time. You can
find Orion by drawing a straight line across the rim of the Dipper, beginning at the inner
or handle side, passing through the outer or Pointers side, and continued for twice the length
of the Dipper, handle and all, this will bring you to Betelgeuze, the big star in the Giant's
right shoulder, below that are the three stars of his belt, sometimes called the "Three Kings."

TALE 52

The Pleiades, that Orion Fired at the Bull

When late autumn comes the Pleiades (Ply'-a-dees) appear in the evening sky to the eastward.
These are the seven shots in the Bull's shoulder, the seven arrows from Orion's bow. The Guide
can locate them by continuing the line of Orion's belt, eight times the length of the belt
to the right, as one faces the Hunter, so Orion must have been very close indeed. At first
they look like a faint light with a few bright pin-points scattered through. Tennyson described
them as:

        Glittering like a swarm of fireflies
        Tangled in a silver braid.

The best time to see them is some clear night about Christmas, when there is no moon, and the
Pleiades are nearly overhead, above the mist and smoke of the horizon, and there are no electric
lights near by.

Study them attentively. Make a tube of your two hands and look through. Look on the ground,
then look back again; look not straight at them, but a little to one side; and at last, mark
down on paper how many you can clearly see, putting a big spot for the big one, and little
spots for the little ones. Poor eyes see nothing but a haze; fairly good eyes see four of the
pin-points; good eyes see five; the best of eyes see seven. I can see seven on a clear winter
night when there are no clouds and no moon. This is as high as you need expect to get, although
it is said that some men in clear air on a mountain top have seen ten, while the telescope
shows that there are 2,000.

In taking these eyesight tests you may use your spectacles if you usually wear them.

Stoutheart and His Black Cravat

Do you know the bird that wears a black cravat, which he changes once a year? It is the English
Sparrow, the commonest of all our birds. His hair is gray, but he must have been red-headed
once, for just back of his ears there is still a band of red; and his collar, maybe, was white
once, but it is very dingy now. His shirt and vest are gray; his coat is brown with black streaks--a
sort of sporting tweed. The new cravat comes when the new feathers grow in late summer; and,
at first, it is barred with gray as if in half mourning for his sins. As the gray tips wear
off, it becomes solid black; that is, in March or April. In summer, it gets rusty and worn
out; so every year he puts on a new one in late August.

The hen sparrow is quite different and wears no cravat. She has a black-and-brown cape of the
sporting pattern, but her dress is everywhere of brownish Quaker gray.

The song of the English Sparrow is loud and short; but he tries to make up, by singing it over
and over again, for many minutes.

He eats many bad bugs, and would be well liked, if he did not steal the nests and the food
of Bluebirds, Woodpeckers, Swallows, and others that are prettier and more useful birds, as
well as far better singers than he is.

But there is much to admire in the Sparrow. I do not know of any bird that is braver, or more
ready to find a way out of trouble; and if he cannot find a way, he cheerfully makes the best
of it.

Some years ago I was at Duluth during a bitterly cold spell of weather. The thermometer registered
20° or 30° below zero, and the blizzard wind was blowing. Oh my, it was cold. But out in the
street were dozens of English Sparrows chirruping and feeding; thriving just as they do in
warmer lands and in fine weather.

When black night came down, colder yet, I wondered what the little stout-hearts would do. Crawl
into some hole or bird-house, maybe? or dive into a snowdrift? as many native birds do.

I found out; and the answer was most unexpected.

In front of the hotel was a long row of electric lights. At nine o'clock, when I chanced to
open the window for a breath of air, my eye fell on these; on every bulb was an English Sparrow
sound asleep with the overarching reflector to turn the storm, and the electric bulb below
him to warm his toes. My hat is off. Our Department of Agriculture may declare war on the Sparrow;
but what is the use? Don't you think that a creature who is not afraid of blizzard or darkness,
and knows how to use electric lights, is going to win its life-battle, and that he surely is
here to stay?

Tracks, and the Stories They Tell

Sometimes, in town, just after rain, when the gutters are wet, and the pavement dry, look for
the tracks of some Dog that walked with wet feet on the pavement. You will find that they are
like "a" in the drawing. A Dog has five toes on his front feet, but only four touch the pavement
as he walks. The claws also touch, and make each a little mark.

Now look for the track of a Cat; it is somewhat like that of the Dog, but it is smaller, softer,
and the claws do not show (b). They are too good to be wasted on a pavement; she keeps them
pulled in, so they are sharp when she has use for them.

Make a drawing of each of these, and make it life size.

When there is dust on the road, or snow, look for Sparrow tracks; they are like "c."

Note how close together the front three toes are. The inner two are really fast together, so
they cannot be separated far and the hind toe is very large. Last of all, note that the tracks
go two and two, because the Sparrow goes "hop hop, hop." These things mean that the Sparrow
is really a tree bird; and you will see that, though often on the ground he gets up into a
tree when he wishes to feel safe.

Look for some Chicken tracks in the dust; they are like "d" in the drawing because the Chicken
does not go "hop, hop, hop" like the Sparrow, but "walk, walk, walk." The Chicken is a ground
bird. Most of the song birds hop like the Sparrow, and most of the game birds walk like a Chicken.
But the Robin (e) goes sometimes hopping and sometimes running, because part of his life is
in the trees, and part on the ground.

TALE 56

A Rabbit's Story of His Life, Written by Himself

Yes, the Rabbit wrote it himself and about himself in the oldest writing on earth, that is
the tracks of his feet.

In February of 1885, one morning after a light snowfall, I went tramping through the woods
north of Toronto, when I came on something that always makes me stop and look--the fresh tracks
of an animal. This was the track of a Cottontail Rabbit and I followed its windings with thrills
of interest. There it began under a little brush pile (a); the bed of brown leaves showing
that he settled there, before the snow-fall began. Now here (b) he leaped out after the snow
ceased, for the tracks are sharp, and sat looking around. See the two long marks of his hind
feet and in front the two smaller prints of his front feet; behind is the mark made by his
tail, showing that he was sitting on it.

Then he had taken alarm at something and dashed off at speed (c), for now his hind feet are
tracking ahead of the front feet, as in most bounding forefoots, and the faster he goes, the
farther ahead those hind feet get.

See now how he dodged about here and there, this way and that, among the trees, as though trying
to escape some dreaded enemy (c, d, e, f).

But what enemy? There are no other tracks, and still the wild jumping went on.

I began to think that the Rabbit was crazy, flying from an imaginary foe; possibly that I was
on the track of a March Hare. But at "g" I found on the trail for the first time a few drops
of blood. That told me that the Rabbit was in real danger but gave no clue to its source.

At "h" I found more blood and at "j" I got a new thrill, for there, plain enough on each side
of the Rabbit track, were finger-like marks, and the truth dawned on me that these were the
prints of great wings. The Rabbit was fleeing from an eagle, a hawk, or an owl. Some twenty
yards farther "k" I found in the snow the remains of the luckless Rabbit partly devoured. Then
I knew that the eagle had not done it, for he would have taken the Rabbit's body away, not
eaten him up there. So it must have been a hawk or an owl. I looked for something to tell me
which, and I got it. Right by the Rabbit's remains was the large twin-toed track (l) that told
me that an owl had been there, and that therefore he was the criminal. Had it been a hawk the
mark would have been as shown in the left lower corner, three toes forward and one back, whereas
the owl usually sets his foot with two toes forward and two backward, as in the sketch. This,
then, I felt sure was the work of an owl. But which owl? There were two, maybe three kinds
in that valley. I wished to know exactly and, looking for further evidence, I found on a sapling
near by a big soft, downy, owlish feather (m) with three brown bars across it; which told me
plainly that a Barred Owl or Hoot Owl had been there recently, and that he was almost certainly
the killer of the Cottontail.

This may sound like a story of Sherlock Holmes among the animals--a flimsy tale of circumstantial
evidence. But while I was making my notes, what should come flying through the woods but the
Owl himself, back to make another meal, no doubt. He alighted on a branch just above my head,
barely ten feet up, and there gave me the best of proof, next to eye witness of the deed, that
all I had gathered from the tracks and signs in the snow was quite true.

I had no camera in those days, but had my sketch book, and as he sat, I made a drawing which
hangs to-day among my pictures that are beyond price.

Here, then, is a chapter of wild life which no man saw, which man could not have seen, for
the presence of a man would have prevented it. And yet we know it was true, for it was written
by the Rabbit himself.

If you have the seeing eye, you will be able to read many strange and thrilling happenings
written for you thus in the snow, the mud, and even the sand and the dust.

The Singing Hawk

Listen, Guide and young folk, I want to add another bird to your list to-day; another secret
of the woods to your learning.

I want you to know the Singing Hawk. Our nature writers nearly always make their hawks scream,
but I want you to know a wonderful Hawk, right in your own woods, that really and truly sings,
and loves to do it.

It is a long time ago since I first met him. I was going past a little ravine north of Toronto,
on a bright warm mid-winter day, when a loud call came ringing down the valley and the bird
that made it, a large hawk, appeared, sailing and singing, kee-o, kee-o, kee-o, kee-o, kee-o,
kee-ye-o, ky-ye-o, ky-oodle, ky-oodle, kee-o, kee-o and on; over and over again, in a wild-wood
tone that thrilled me. He sailed with set wings to a near-by tree, and ceased not his stirring
call; there was no answer from the woods, but there was a vibrant response in my heart. It
moved me through and through. How could it do so much, when it was so simple? I did not know
how to tell it in words, but I felt it in my boyish soul. It expressed all the wild-wood life
and spirit, the joy of living, the happy brightness of the day, the thrill of the coming spring,
the glory of flight; all, all it seemed to voice in its simple ringing, "kee-o, kee-o, kee-o,
kee-yi-o"; never before had I seen a bird so evidently rejoicing in his flight; then singing,
it sailed away from sight; but the song has lingered ever since in the blessed part of my memory.
I often heard it afterward, and many times caught the Blue-jay in a feeble imitation of its
trumpet note. I never forgot the exact timbre of that woodland call; so when at length, long
after, I traced it to what is known in books as the "Red-shouldered Hawk," it was a little
triumph and a little disappointment. The books made it all so commonplace. They say it has
a loud call like "kee-o"; but they do not say that it has a bugle note that can stir your very
soul if you love the wild things, and voices more than any other thing on wings the glory of
flight, the blessedness of being alive.

To-day, as I write, is December 2, 1917; and this morning as I walked in my homeland, a sailing,
splendid hawk came pouring out the old refrain, "kee-yi-o, kee-yi-o, kee-oh." Oh, it was glorious!
I felt little prickles in the roots of my hair as he went over; and I rejoiced above all things
to realize that he sang just as well as, yes maybe a little better than that first one did,
that I heard in the winter woods some forty years ago.

The Fingerboard Goldenrod

"Oh, Mother Carey! All-mother! Lover of us little plants as well as the big trees! Listen to
us little slender Goldenrods.

"We want to be famous, Mother Carey, but our stems are so little and our gold is so small,
that we cannot count in the great golden show of autumn, for that is the glory of our tall
cousins. They do not need us, and they do not want us. Won't you give us a little job all our
own, our very own, for we long to be doing something?"

Then Mother Carey smiled so softly and sweetly and said: "Little slender Goldenrods, I am going
to give you something to do that will win you great honour among all who understand. In the
thick woods the moss on the trunk shows the north side; when the tree is alone and in the open,
the north side is known by its few branches; but on the open prairie, there is no plant that
stands up like a finger post to point the north for travellers, while the sun is hid."

"This, then do, little slender Goldenrods; face the noon sun, and as you stand, throw back
your heads proudly, for you are in service now. Throw back your heads till your golden plumes
are pointing backward to the north--so shall you have an honourable calling and travellers
will be glad that I have made you a fingerboard on the plains."

So the slender Goldenrod and his brothers rejoiced and they stood up straight, facing the noon
sun, and bent backward, throwing out their chests till their golden caps and plumes were pointed
to the north.

And many a traveller, on cloudy days and dark nights, has been cheered by the sight of the
Compass Goldenrod, pointing to the north and helping him to get home.

This does not mean that every one of them points to the north all the time. They do their best
but there are always some a little wrong. Yet you can tell the direction at night or on dark
days if you look at a bed of them that grew out in full sunlight.

"Yon is the north," they keep on singing, all summer long, and even when winter comes to kill
the plant, and end its bloom, the brave little stalk stands up there, in snow to its waist,
bravely pointing out the north, to those who have learned its secret. And not only in winter
storms, but I have even found them still on guard after the battle, when the snow melted in
springtime. Once when I was a boy, I found a whole bank of them by a fence, when the snow went
off in April, and I wrote in their honour this verse:

        Some of them bowed are, and broken
          And battered and lying low
        But the few that are left stand like spearmen staunch
          Each pointing his pike at the foe.

Woodchuck Day, February Second Sixth Secret of the Woods

It was Monapini that told Ruth Pilgrim, and Ruth Pilgrim told the little Pilgrims, and the
little Pilgrims told the little Dutchmen, and the little Dutchmen told it to all the little
Rumours, and the grandchild of one of these little Rumours told it to me, so you see I have
it straight and on good authority, this Sixth Secret of the Woods.

The story runs that every year the wise Woodchuck retires to sleep in his cozy home off the
subway that he made, when the leaves begin to fall, and he has heard the warning. Mother Carey
has sung the death-song of the red leaves; sung in a soft voice that yet reaches the farthest
hills:

        "Gone are the summer birds.
         Hide, hide, ye slow-foots.
         Hide, for the blizzard comes."

And Mother Earth, who is Maka Ina, cries to her own: "Come, hide in my bosom, my little ones."
And the wise Woodchuck waits not till the blizzard comes, but hides while he may make good
housing, and sleeps for three long moons.

But ever on the second sun of the Hunger-moon (and this is the Sixth Secret) he rouses up and
ventures forth. And if so be that the sun is in the sky, and the snow on the bosom of his Mother
Earth, so that his shadow shall appear on it, he goeth back to sleep again for one and a half
moons more--for six long weeks. But if the sky be dark with clouds and the earth all bared
of snow so that no shadow shows, he says, "The blizzard time is over, there is food when the
ground is bare," and ends his sleep.

This is the tale and this much I know is true: In the North, if he venture forth on Woodchuck
Day, he sees both sun and snow, so sleeps again; in the South there is no snow that day, and
he sleeps no more; and in the land between, he sleeps in a cold winter, and in an open winter
rouses to live his life.

These things I have seen, and they fit with the story of Monapini, so you see the little Rumour
told me true.

How the Pine Tree Tells Its Own Story

Suppose you are in the woods, and your woods in Canada, or the Northern States; you would see
at once two kinds of trees: Pines and Hardwoods.

Pines, or Evergreens, have leaves like needles, and are green all the year round; they bear
cones and have soft wood.

The Hardwoods, or Broadleaves, sometimes called Shedders, have broad leaves that are shed in
the fall; they bear nuts or berries and have hard wood.

Remember this, every tree that grows has flowers and seeds; and the tree can always be told
by its seeds, that is, its fruit. If you find a tree with cones on it, you know it belongs
to the Pine family. If you find one with broad leaves and nuts or berries, it belongs to the
Hardwoods.[C]

Of these the Pines always seem to me more interesting.

       *       *       *       *       *

In September, 1002, I had a good chance to study Pine trees in the mountains of Idaho. There
was a small one that had to be cut down, so I made careful drawings of it. It was fourteen
years old, and across the stump it showed one ring of wood for each year of growth, and a circle
of branches on the trunk for each year. Notice that between the branches, the trunk did not
taper; it was an even cylinder, but got suddenly smaller at each knot by the same amount of
wood as was needed by those branches for their wood.

If we begin in the centre of the stump, and at the bottom of the trunk, we find that the little
tree tells us its own story of its life and troubles. Its first year, judging by the bottom
section of the trunk (No. 1) and by the inmost ring, was just ordinary. Next year according
to section 2 and ring 2, it had a fine season and grew nearly twice as much as the first year.
The third year the baby Pine had a very hard time, and nearly died. Maybe it was a dry summer,
so the little tree grew only 2-1/2 inches higher while the ring of wood it added was no thicker
than a sheet of paper. Next year, the fourth, it did better. And the next was about its best
year, for it grew 7-1/2 inches higher, and put on a fine fat ring of wood, as you see.

In its eleventh year, it had some new troubles; either the season was dry, or the trees about
too shady, or maybe disease attacked it. For it grew but a poor shoot on the top, and the ring
of wood on the stump is about the thinnest of all.

Of course, a saw-cut along the second joint showed but thirteen rings, and the third but twelve
while one through the top joint, the one which grew this year, showed but a single ring.

Thus the Pine tree has in itself a record of its whole life; and this is easy to read when
the tree is small; but in later life the lower limbs disappear, and the only complete record
is in the rings of growth that show on the stump. These never fail to tell the truth.

Of course, you are not to go around cutting down trees merely to count their rings and read
their history, but you should look at the rings whenever a new stump gives you a good chance.
Then Hardwoods as well as Pines will spread before you the chapters of their life; one ring
for each year that they have lived.

TALE 61

Blazes

All hunters and Indians have signs to let their people know the way. Some of these signs are
on trees, and are called "Blazes." One of those much used is a little piece of bark chipped
off to show the white wood; it means: "This is the way, or the place." Another sign is like
an arrow, and means: "Over there," or "Go in that direction." No matter what language they
speak, the blazes tell everyone alike. So a blaze is a simple mark that tells us something
without using words or letters, and it depends on where it is placed for part of its meaning.

On the following page are some blazes used in our towns to-day. You will find many more if
you look, some in books; some on the adjoining page.

TALE 62

Totems[D]

A Totem is a simple form used as the emblem or symbol of a man, a group of men, an animal,
or an idea; it does not use or refer to words or letters, so it is the same in all languages.
Unlike the blaze it does not depend on its position for part of its meaning.

Among peoples that cannot read or write, each leading man had a Totem that he used, instead
of writing his name. He put this mark on his property, and at length put it on his shield and
armour to distinguish him in battle. Out of this grew heraldry.

Modern trade-marks are Totems though often spoiled by words or letters added. The Totem continues
in use because it is so easy to see a long way off, and can be understood by all, no matter
what their language. Most of the great railway companies have a Totem and the use of such things
is increasing to-day.

Here in the drawing are some Totems seen daily in our towns. Doubtless you can add to the number.

Symbols

If you have thought much about it, O Guide! you will surely find that, for decoration, it is
better to use a beautiful symbol of anything, rather than a good photograph of it. For the
symbol lets the imagination loose, and the other chains it to the ground; the one is the spirit,
and the other the corpse. These things you cannot tell to the little folks, but you can prove
them to yourself, and you will see why I wish to give some symbols here for use.

There is another reason, one which you can give to them. It is this: Only the highly trained
artist can make a good portrait drawing, while the smallest child, if it sticks to symbols,
is sure, in some degree, of a pleasant success in its very first effort.

These that I give, are copied from Indian art, and whether in colour, in raised modelling,
or in black lines, can be used successfully to decorate anything that you are likely to make.

TALE 64

Sign Language

All men, especially wild men, and some animals have a language of signs. That is, they talk
to each other without making any sounds; using instead, the movements of parts of the body.
This is "eye talk," while words are "ear talk."

Among the animals, horses bob their heads when they are hungry and paw with a front foot when
thirsty or eager to be off. Dogs wag their tails when pleased, and cows shake their heads when
angry.

Policemen, firemen, railway men, and others use signs because there is too much noise to be
heard. School children use signs because they are not allowed to talk in school. Most children
know the signs for "yes" and "no," "come here," "go away," "hurry up," "you can't touch me,"
"hush!", "shame on you!", "up," "down," "word of honour," "swimming," etc.

The traffic policeman is using signs all day long. By a movement of the hand he signals:--stop,
go on, come here, hurry up, wait, turn around, go by, stay back, over there, you look out,
right here, and one or two others.

How many signs can you add to these two lists?

The Language of Hens

Yes; Hens talk somewhat as we do; only they haven't so many words, and don't depend on them
as we have to.

There are only ten words in ordinary hen-talk.

The cluck, cluck of the mother means "Come along, kiddies."

The low kawk of warning, usually for a hawk.

The chuck, chuck of invitation means, "Good food."

The tuk-ut-e-ah-tuk means, "Bless my soul, what is that?"

The cut, cut, get your hair cut, of a Hen that has just laid and is feeling greatly relieved;
no doubt, saying, "Thank goodness, that's done!" or maybe it is a notice to her mate or friend
that "Business is over, let's have some fun. Where are you?"

The soft, long-drawn tawk--tawk--tawk, that is uttered as the Hen strolls about, corresponds
to the whistling of the small boy; that is, it is a mere pastime, expressing freedom from fear
or annoyance.

The long, harsh, crauk, crauk of fear when captured.

The quick clack, clack, clatter when springing up in fear of capture.

The put, put of hunger.

And, of course, the peep, peep of chickens and the cock-a-doodle-doo, which is the song of
the Rooster.

Some Hens may have more; but these given here are hen-talk for mother-love, warning, invitation,
surprise, exultation, cheerfulness, fear, astonishment, and hunger. Not a bad beginning in

Then, after a pause he added, "Mother, what is its tail for? Why is it so big and fluffy? I
know a 'Possum has a tail to hang on a limb with, and a Fish can swim with his tail, but why
is a Gray Squirrel's tail so bushy and soft?"

Alas! Mother didn't know, and couldn't tell where to find out. It was long after, that little
Billie got the answer to his childish, but really important question. The Alligator may use
his tail as a club, the Horse, his tail as a fly-flapper, the Porcupine his tail as a spiked
war-club, the 'Possum his as a hooked hanger, the Fox his as a muffler, the Fish his as a paddle;
but the Gray Squirrel's tail is a parachute, a landeasy. I have seen a Gray Squirrel fall fifty
feet to the ground, but his tail was in good condition; he spread it to the utmost and it landed
him safely right side up.

I remember also a story of a Squirrel that lost his tail by an accident. It didn't seem to
matter much for a while. The stump healed up, and the Squirrel was pert as ever; but one day
he missed his hold in jumping, and fell to the ground. Ordinarily, that would have been a small
matter; but without his tail he was jarred so severely that a dog, who saw him fall, ran up
and killed him before he could recover and climb a tree.

Why a Dog Wags His Tail

There is an old story that the Dog said to the Cat: "Cat, you are a fool; you growl when you
are pleased and wag your tail when you are angry." Which happens to be true; and makes us ask:
Why does a Dog wag his tail to mean friendship?

The fact is, it is part of a wig-wag code, which is doubly interesting now that all our boys
are learning wig-wagging with a white flag. We think that our army people invented this method;
but Woodcraft men know better.

First, notice that any Dog that has any white on his body has at least a little white on the
end of his tail. This is well known; and the reason is that the wild ancestor had a white brush
on the end of his tail; a white flag, indeed; and this was the flag of his signal code.

Suppose, then, that a wild Dog, prowling through the woods, sights some other animal. Instantly
he crouches; for it is good woodcraft to avoid being seen and then watch from your hiding-place.
As the stranger comes near, the crouching Dog sees that it is one of his own kind, and that
it is needless to hide any longer; indeed, that it is impossible to remain hidden. So the moment
the stranger stops and looks at the crouching Dog, the latter stands straight up on all fours,
raises his tail up high, and wags the white tip from side to side in the sign which means,
"Let's be friends."

Every Dog knows the sign, every Dog in every town does it yet; every boy has seen it a thousand
times. We flatter ourselves that we invented the wig-wag code with our little white flag. Maybe
so; but the Dog had it long before we did.

TALE 68

Why the Dog Turns Around Three Times Before Lying Down

Yes, they all do it; the big St. Bernard, the foolish littlest lap Dog, the ragged street Dog;
give them bare boards, or a silken cushion, or snow, three turns around and down they go.

Why? Not so hard to answer as some simple questions. Long, long ago, the wild great-great-grandfather
of the Dog--a yellow creature with black hair sprinkled on his back, sharp ears, light spots
over his eyes, and a white tail-tip--used to live in the woods, or on the prairies. He did
not have a home to which he might return every time he wanted to rest or sleep; so he camped
wherever he found himself, on the plains, in a thicket, or even in some hole in a rock; and
he carried his bedclothes on his back. But he always found it worth while to add a little comfort
by smoothing the grass, the leaves, the twigs, or the pebbles before lying down; and the simplest
way to do this was by curling up, and turning round three times, with the body brushing the
high grass or pebbles into a comfortable shape for a bed.

Yes, and they all do it to-day just the same, big and little, which is only one of the many
proofs that they are descended from the same wild-wood great-grandfather, and still remember
his habits.

The Deathcup of Diablo

The world went very well in those bright days of the long ago, when the wedding of El Sol and
Maka Ina set all living things rejoicing. Green youth and sparkling happiness were everywhere.
Only one there was--Diablo--who found in it poor comfort. He had no pleasure in the growing
grass. The buttercups annoyed him with the gayness of their gold. It was at this time he chewed
their stalks, so that many ever since have been flattened and mangled. And the cherry with
its fragrant bloom he breathed on with his poison breath, so its limbs were burnt and blackened
into horrid canker bumps. And poisonous froth he blew on the sprouting rose leaves, so they
blackened and withered away. The jewel weed, friend of the humming birds, he trampled down,
but it rose so many times and so bravely, that he left the yellow dodder like an herb-worm,
or a root-born leech to suck its blood all summer long, and break it down. Then to trail over
the trunks of trees and suck their life, he left the demon vine, the Poison Ivy with its touch
of burning fire. He put the Snapping Turtle in the beautiful lakes to destroy its harmless
creatures and the Yellow-eyed Whizz he sent, and the Witherbloom with its breath of flame.

And last he made the Deathcup Toadstool, and sowed it in the woods.

He saw the Squirrels eating and storing up the sweet red russula. He saw it furnish food to
mice and deer, so he fashioned the Deathcup Amanita to be like it; and scattered it wherever
good mushrooms grew, a trap for the unwary.

Tall and shapely is the Deathcup; beautiful to look upon and smelling like a mushroom. But
beware of it, a very little is enough, a morsel of the cup; the next night or maybe a day later
the poison pangs set in. Too late perhaps for medicine to help, and Amanita, the Deathcup,
the child of Diablo, has claimed another victim.

How shall we know the deadly Amanita among its kindly cousins, the good mushrooms? Wise men
say by these:--The poison cup from which its springs; the white kid collar on its neck; the
white or yellow gills; and the white spores that fall from its gills if the cup, without the
stem, be laid gills down on a black paper for an hour.

By these things we may know the wan Demon of the woods, but the wisest Guides say to their
tribe:--"Because death lurks in that shapely mushroom, though there are a hundred good for
food, they are much alike, and safety bids you shun them; let them all alone."

So Diablo went on his way rejoicing because he had spoiled so much good food for good folk.

This, the danger of the Deathcup, is the Seventh Secret of the Woods.

Poison Ivy or the Three-Fingered Demon of the Woods

You have been hearing about good fairies and good old Mother Carey and Medicine in the Sky.
Now I am going to warn you against the three-fingered Demon, the wicked snakevine that basks
on stone walls and climbs up the tree trunk, and does more harm than all the other plants,
vines, trees, and bushes put together; for it is not like the Deathcup, easy to see and easy
to let alone.

This is the Poison Ivy. Does it not look poisonous as it crawls snake-like up some trunk, sending
suckers out into the tree to suck the sap; and oozing all over its limbs with poison in tiny
wicked little drops? Sometimes it does not climb but crawls on the ground, but by this ye may
always know it: It has only three fingers on its hand; that is, only three leaflets on each stalk.

The one thing that looks like it, is the Boston Ivy, but that does not grow in the woods, and
the Poison Ivy leaf always has the little bump and bite out on the side of the leaf as you
see in the drawing.

It is known and feared for its power to sting and blister the skin when it is handled or even
touched. The sting begins with an unpleasant itching which gets worse, especially if rubbed,
until it blisters and breaks open with sores which are very hard to heal.

The cause of the sting is a blistering oil, which is found in tiny drops on all parts of the
leaf and branches; it is a fixed oil; that is, it will not dry up, and as long as it is on
the skin, it keeps on burning and blistering, worse and worse.

THE CURE

And this is the cure for the sting of the Demon Vine:--

Anything that will dissolve and remove oil without injuring the skin:--

Hot water, as hot as you can stand it, is good; a little salt in it helps.

Hot soapy water is good.

Hot water with washing soda is good.

A wash of alcohol is good.

But best of all is a wash of strong alcohol in which is a little sugar of lead as an antiseptic.

       *       *       *       *       *

The Guide should remember that three persons out of five are immune from Poison Ivy, while
a few are so sensitive that they are poisoned by flies carrying it to them on their feet. It
can be easily cured if treated at once; if neglected it often becomes very bad and may need
the help of a doctor.

This is the Eighth Secret of the Woods.

TALE 71

The Medicine in the Sky

This is one of the greatest and best secrets of Woodcraft--The Medicine in the Sky.

Let me tell you a story about it. There was once an Indian who left his own people, to live
with the white man, in the East. But the Great Spirit was displeased, for he did not mean the
Indian to live in houses or cities. After a year, the red man came back very thin and sick,
coughing nearly all night, instead of sleeping. He believed himself dying.

The wise old Medicine Man of his tribe said, "You need the Medicine of the Sky." He took it
and got quite well and strong.

Another Indian, who had gone to visit with a distant tribe of red men, came back with some
sickness on his skin that made it very sore. It was far worse than Poison Ivy, for it began
to eat into his flesh. The Medicine Man said, "Sky Medicine will cure you." And it did.

One day a white man, a trader, came with chest protectors to sell to the Indians. He was sure
they needed them, because he did; and, although so well wrapped up, he was always cold. He
suffered whenever the wind blew. The old Medicine Man said, "We don't need your chest pads,
and you would not if you took the Sky Medicine." But of this monstrous accusation I wish to
register an explicit denial, once for all.

Dropping down to Fernandina unmolested after this affair, we were kindly received by the military
and naval commanders,--Colonel Hawley, of the Seventh Connecticut (now Brigadier-General Hawley),
and Lieutenant-Commander Hughes, of the gunboat Mohawk. It turned out very opportunely that
both of these officers had special errands to suggest still farther up the St. Mary's, and
precisely in the region where I wished to go.

Colonel Hawley showed me a letter from the War Department, requesting
him to ascertain the possibility of obtaining a supply of brick for
Fort Clinch from the brickyard which had furnished the original materials,
but which had not been visited since the perilous river-trip of the
Ottawa.

Lieutenant Hughes wished to obtain information for the Admiral respecting
a Rebel steamer,--the Berosa,--said to be lying somewhere up the river,
and awaiting her chance to run the blockade.

I jumped at the opportunity.

Berosa and brickyard,--both were near Wood-stock, the former home
of Corporal Sutton; he was ready and eager to pilot us up the river;
the moon would be just right that evening, setting at 3h.

19m.

A.M.; and our boat was precisely the one to undertake the expedition.

Its double-headed shape was just what was needed in that swift and
crooked stream; the exposed pilot-houses had been tolerably barricaded
with the thick planks from St. Simon's; and we further obtained some
sand-bags from Fort Clinch, through the aid of Captain Sears, the
officer in charge, who had originally suggested the expedition after
brick.

In return for this aid, the Planter was sent back to the wharf at
St. Mary's, to bring away a considerable supply of the same precious
article, which we had observed near the wharf.

Meanwhile the John Adams was coaling from naval supplies, through the kindness of Lieutenant
Hughes; and the Ben De Ford was taking in the lumber which we had yesterday brought down. It
was a great disappointment to be unable to take the latter vessel
up the river; but I was unwillingly convinced that, though the depth
of water might be sufficient, yet her length would be unmanageable
in the swift current and sharp turns.

The Planter must also be sent on a separate cruise, as her weak and disabled machinery made her useless
for my purpose.

Two hundred men were therefore transferred, as before, to the narrow hold of the John Adams,
in addition to the company permanently stationed on board to work
the guns.

       At seven o'clock on the evening of January 29th, beneath a lovely
moon, we steamed up the river.

Never shall I forget the mystery and excitement of that night. I know nothing in life more fascinating
than the nocturnal ascent of an unknown river, leading far into an enemy's country, where
one glides in the dim moonlight between dark hills and meadows, each turn of the channel making it seem
like an inland lake, and cutting you off as by a barrier from all
behind,--with no sign of human life, but an occasional picket-fire
left glimmering beneath the bank, or the yelp of a dog from some low-lying
plantation.

On such occasions every nerve is strained to its utmost tension; all dreams of romance appear
to promise immediate fulfilment; all lights on board the vessel are
obscured, loud voices are hushed; you fancy a thousand men on shore,
and yet see nothing; the lonely river, unaccustomed to furrowing keels,
lapses by the vessel with a treacherous sound; and all the senses
are merged in a sort of anxious trance.

Three tunes I have had in full perfection this fascinating experience;
but that night was the first, and its zest was the keenest.

It will come back to me in dreams, if I live a thousand years.

 You saw her not,
you heard her not, but the sweet healing of her presence will be with you for many after moons.

Bird-nesting in Winter

What good are old bird-nests? These are some of the ends they serve. A Deermouse seeking the
safety of a bramble thicket and a warm house, will make his own nest in the forsaken home of
a Cat-bird. A Gray Squirrel will roof over the open nest of a Crow or Hawk and so make it a
castle in the air for himself. But one of the strangest uses is this: The Solitary Sandpiper
is a bird that cannot build a tree nest for itself and yet loves to give to its eggs the safety
of a high place; so it lays in the old nest of a Robin, or other tree bird, and there its young
are hatched. But this is only in the Far North. There are plenty of old bird-nests left for
other uses, and for you.

Bird-nesting in summer is wicked, cruel, and against the law. But bird-nesting in winter is
good fun and harms no one, if we take only the little nests that are built in forked twigs,
or on rock ledges. For most little birds prefer to make a new nest for themselves each season.

If you get: A Goldfinch, floss nest;

A Phoebe, moss nest;

A Robin, mud nest;

A Vireo, good nest;

A Kingbird, rag nest;

An Oriole, bag nest;

you have six different kinds of beautiful nests that are easily kept for the museum, and you
do no harm in taking them.

The Ox-eye Daisy or Marguerite

Do you know that "Daisy" means "day's eye," because the old country Daisy opens its eyes when
day comes, and shuts them every night. But our Daisy is different and much bigger, so we have
got into the way of calling it "Ox-eye." Some of our young people call it "Love-me; love-me-not,"
because they think it can tell if one is loved. They pull out the white rays of the flower
one by one, saying, "He loves me; he loves me not; he loves me; he loves me not." Then what
they are saying as the last is pulled, settles the question. If the Daisy says "He loves me,"
they take a second Daisy and ask the next question, "Will he marry me?" Then, pulling the rays
as before, "This year, next year, some time, never." And in this way they learn all that the
Daisies know about these important matters.

We call it "our Daisy," but it is not a true native of America. Its home is Europe. The settlers
of New England, missing the flower of their homeland, brought it over and planted it in their
gardens. It spread widely in the North; but it did not reach the South until the time of the
Civil War, when it is said to have gone in with the hay for Sherman's Army, to become a troublesome
weed in the fields.

A Monkey-hunt

We all love to go a-hunting; every one of us in some way; and it is only the dislike of cruelty
and destruction that keeps most of us from hunting animals continually, as our forebears did.

Some of my best days were spent in hunting. The Arabs say, "Allah reckons not against a man's
allotted span the days he spends in the chase."

I hope that I may help many of you to go a-hunting, and to get the good things of it, with
the bad things left out.

Come! Now it is the spring of the year, and just the right time for a Monkey-hunt. We are going
prowling along the brookside where we are pretty sure of finding our game. "See, there is a
Monkey tree and it is full of the big Monkeys!"

"What! That pussy-willow?"

Yes, you think they are only pussy-willows, but wait until you see. We shall take home a band
of the Monkeys, tree and all, and you will learn that a pussy-willow is only a baby Monkey
half done.

Now let us get a branch of live elderberry and one or two limbs of the low red sumac. It is
best to use sumac because it is the only handy wood that one can easily stick a pin through,
or cut. The pieces should be five or six inches long and about half an inch to an inch thick.
They should have as many odd features as possible, knots, bumps, fungus, moss, etc.; all of
which add interest to the picture.

To these we must add a lot of odd bits of dry cane, dry grasses, old flower-stalks, moss, and
gravel, etc., to use for background and foreground in the little jungle we are to make for
our Monkeys to play in. It is delightful to find the new interest that all sorts of queer weeds
take on, when we view them as canes or palms for our little jungle.

Now with the spoils of our hunt, let us go home and preserve the trophies.

Cut off about three inches of the elderberry wood and have it clear of knots; cut a flat ended
ramrod so as just to fit the bore, and force out the pith with one clean sharp push: or else
whittle away the surrounding wood. The latter way gives a better quality of pith.

Now take a piece of the pith about one-third the size of a big pussy-willow, use a very sharp
knife and you will find it easy to whittle it into a Monkey's head about the shape of "a" and "b."

Use a very sharp-pointed, soft black pencil to make the eyes, nose, the line for the mouth
and the shape of the ears; or else wait till the pith is quite dry, then use a fine pen with ink.

If you are skilful with the knife you may cut the ears so that they hang as in "d."

Stick an ordinary pin right down through the crown of the head into a big pussy-willow that
will serve as a body (e). If you glue the head on it is harder to do, but it keeps the body
from being mussed up. Cut two arms of the pith (ff) and two feet (gg), drawing the lines for
the fingers and toes, with the sharp black pencil, or else ink as before.

Cut a long, straight pointed piece of pith for a tail, dip it in boiling water, then bend it
to the right shape "h."

Cut a branch of the sumac so that it is about four inches high, and of the style for a tree;
nail this on a block of wood to make it stand. Sometimes it is easier to bore a hole in the
stand and wedge the branch into that.

Set the Monkey on the limb by driving the pin into it as at "i," or else glueing it on; and
glue on the limbs and tail. Sometimes a little wad of willow-down on the Monkey's crown is
a great help. It hides the pin.

Now set this away for the glue to harden.

Meanwhile take an ordinary cigar box about two inches deep, line it with white paper pasted
in; or else paint it with water colour in Chinese white. Colour the upper part sky colour;
the lower, shaded into green, getting very dark on the bottom. Lay a piece of glass or else
a scrap of an old motor-car window-isinglass on the bottom, and set in a couple of tacks alongside
to hold it; this is for a pool.

Make a mixture of liquid glue, one part; water, five parts; then stir in enough old plaster
of Paris, whitening, or even fine loam to make a soft paste. Build banks of this paste around
the pool and higher toward the back sides. Stick the tree, with its stand and its Monkeys,
in this, to one side; dust powder or rotten wood over the ground to hide its whiteness; or
paint it with water colours.

Use all the various dry grasses, etc., to form a jungle; sticking them in the paste, or glueing
them on.

And your jungle with its Monkeys is complete.

       *       *       *       *       *

Many other things may be used for Monkeys. I have seen good ones made of peanuts, with the
features inked on, and a very young black birch catkin for tail. Beautiful birds also can be
made by using a pith body and bright feathers or silks glued on for plumes. The pith itself
is easily coloured with water colours.

You will be delighted to see what beautiful effects you can get by use of these simple wild
materials, helped with a little imagination.

And the end of the Monkey-hunt will be that you have learned a new kind of hunting, with nothing
but pleasant memories in it, and trophies to show for proof.

The Horsetail and the Jungle

Long, long ago, millions of years ago, this world was much hotter than it is now. Yes, in mid-winter
it was hotter than it is now in mid-summer. Over all Pennsylvania there were huge forests of
things that looked a little like palms, but some looked like pipes with joints, and had wheels
of branches or limb wheels at every joint. They were as tall as some palms, and grew in swamps.

When one of those big joint-wheels fell over, it sank into the mud and was forgotten. So at
last the swamp was filled up solid with their trunks.

Then for some unknown reason all the big joint-trees died, and the sand, mud, and gravel levelled
off the swamp. There they lay, and slowly become blacker and harder under the mud, until they
turned into coal.

That is what we burn to-day, the trunks of the wheel-jointed swamp trees. But their youngest
great-grandchild is still with us, and shows, in its small way, what its great ancestors were like.

You will find it along some railway bank, or in any damp woods. Country people who know it,
call it Joint Grass or Horsetails; the books call it Equisetum. The drawing will show you what
to look for.

Gather a handful and take them home. Then get some of the moss known as ground-pine, a small
piece of glass (the Guide should see that the edges of the glass are well rubbed with a stone,
to prevent cutting the fingers), a cigar box, and white paste or putty, as in the Monkey-hunt.

Make a pool with the glass, and banks around it of the paste. Now cover these banks with the
ground pine; using a little glue on the under side of each piece, but leave an open space without
moss at the back, near the pool. Take a pointed stick and make holes through the moss into
the clay or putty, and in each hole put one of the Horsetails, cutting it off with scissors
if too tall for the top, till you have a thicket of these stems on each side; only make more
on one side than on the other.

       *       *       *       *       *

Now for the grand finish. You must make an extinct monster. Get half a walnut shell; cut a
notch at one end where the neck will be; fill the shell with putty; stick in wooden pegs for
legs, tail, and head. The central stalk of a tulip-tree fruit makes a wonderful sculptured
tail; the unopened buds of dogwood do for legs, also cloves have been used. Any nobby stick
serves for head if you make eyes and teeth on it.

When dry this makes a good extinct monster. Set it on the far bank of the water, and you have
a jungle, the old Pennsylvania jungle of the days when the coal was packed away.

TALE 77

The Woods in Winter

Go out to the nearest chestnut tree, and get half a small burr; trim it neatly. Fill it with
putty; set four wooden pegs in this for legs, a large peg for a head and a long thin one for
a tail. On the head put two little black pins for eyes. Now rub glue on the wooden pegs and
sprinkle them with powdered rotten wood, or fine sand, and you have a Burr Porcupine. Sometimes
carpet tacks are used for legs. You will have to wear strong leather gloves in making this,
it is so much like a real Porcupine.

Now go into your woods and get a handful of common red cedar twigs with leaves on, or other
picturesque branches, some creeping moss of the kind used by flower dealers to pack plants,
various dried grasses, and a few flat or sharp-cornered pebbles. Take these home. Get a cigar
box or a candy-box, some paper, clay or putty and glass, as already described for the Monkey-hunt.
Make a pond with the glass and a bank with the clay and pebbles. Paint the top of the clay,
and tops of the pebbles with the thin glue, and also part of the glass; then sprinkle all with
powdered chalk, whitening, plaster of Paris or talcum powder for snow. Put the Porcupine in
the middle, and you have the "Woods in Winter."

TALE 78

The Fish and the Pond

Go out and get the cone of a Norway Spruce tree, or a White Spruce; this is the body of your
Fish. Cut two round spots of white paper for eyes, glue them on, and when dry, put a black
ink spot in the middle of each. Add a curved piece of paper on each side for gills. Then with
an awl or with the point of the scissors make holes in the sides, in which put fins cut out
of brown paper, fixing them in with glue. Then, with the knife blade, make a long cut in the
back, and split the tail, and in each cut glue a thick piece of brown paper cut fin shape.
When dry, draw lines on these with ink. Now you have a good Fish.

For the pond, take a cigar-box, paint the lower quarter of it dark green, and the upper part
shaded into light blue, for sky. Glue a piece of glass or else carwindow celluloid level across
this near the bottom. This is for water. Hide all the back and side edges of the glass with
clay banks as described in the Monkey-hunt, or with moss glued on. Put a fine black thread
to the Fish's back, another to his tail, and hang him level above the water by fastening the
threads to the top of the box. Label it "Pond Life" or the "Fish at Home."

Smoke Prints of Leaves

Collect one or two leaves that have strongly marked ribs; elm and raspberry are good ones.
Take a piece of paper that is strong, but rather soft, and about as big as this page. Grease,
or oil it all over with paint-oil, butter, or lard. Then hold it, grease-side down, in the
smoke of a candle, close to the flame, moving it about quickly so that the paper won't burn,
until it is everywhere black with soot.

Lay the paper flat on a table, soot-side up, on a piece of blotting paper. Lay the leaf on
this; then, over that, a sheet of paper. Press this down over all the leaf. Lift the leaf and
lay it on a piece of soft, white paper; press it down as before, with a paper over it, on which
you rub with one hand while the other keeps it from slipping; lift the leaf, and on the lower
paper you will find a beautiful line-drawing of the leaf, done in black ink; which, once it
is dry, will never rub out or fade away.

At one corner write down the date and the name of the leaf.

Bird-boxes

You can win honours in Woodcraft if you make a successful bird-box. That is one made by yourself,
and used by some bird to raise its brood in.

There are three kinds of birds that are very ready to use the nesting places you make. These
are the Robin, Wren, and Phoebe. But each bird wants its own kind exactly right, or will not
use it.

First the Robin wants a shelf, as in the picture. It should be hung against a tree or a building,
about ten feet up, and not much exposed to the wind. It should also be in a shady place or
at least not where it gets much sun.

The nails sticking up on the floor are to hold the nest so the wind will not blow it away.
The Phoebe-shelf is much the same only smaller.

The Wren-box should be about four or five inches wide and six inches high inside, with a hole
exactly seven eighths inch wide. If any bigger, the Wren does not like it so well, and other
birds may drive the Wren away. Many Wren-boxes are made of tomato tins, but these are hard
to cut a hole in. The Wren-box should be hung where the sun never shines on it all summer,
as that would make it too hot inside.

TALE 81

A Hunter's Lamp

In the old pioneer days, every hunter used to make himself a lamp, for it was much easier to
make than a candle. It is a good stunt in Woodcraft to make one. Each woodcrafter should have
one of his own handiwork. There are four things needed in it: The bowl, the wick, the wick-holder
and some fat, grease, or oil.

For the bowl a big clam shell does well.

For wick a strip of cotton rag rolled into a cord as thick as a slate pencil, and about two
inches long; a cotton cord will do, or perhaps the fibrous bark of milkweed or other native
stuff is the truly woodcraft thing.

For wick-holder get a piece of brick, stone, or a small clam shell about as big as a half dollar.
Bore a hole through the middle to hold the wick. It is not easy to get the hole through without
splitting the stone, but sometimes one can find a flat pebble already bored. Sometimes one
can make a disc of clay with a hole in it, then burn this hard in a fierce fire, but the most
primitive way is to rub the bump of a small clam shell on a flat stone till it is worn through.

For oil use the fat, grease, lard, or butter of any animal, if it is fresh, that is without
salt in it.

Fill the bowl with the grease, soak the wick in grease and set it in the holder so that half
an inch sticks up; the rest is in the grease. The holder rests on the bottom of the bowl.

Light the end that sticks up. It will burn with a clear, steady light till all the oil is used up.

To have made a lamp that will burn for half an hour is counted an "honour" in Woodcraft, and
may win you a badge if you belong to a Woodcraft Tribe.

TALE 82

The Coon Hunt

Take a little bundle of white rags, or paper, as large as a walnut; call this the "Coon." While
all the young folks hide their eyes or go out of the room, the Guide puts the Coon on some
place, high or low, but in plain view; then, going away from it, shouts "Coon!"

Now the young scouts have to find that Coon, each looking about for himself. As soon as one
sees it, he says nothing, but sits down. Each must find it for himself, then sit down silently,
until all are down. Last down is the "booby"; first down is the winner; and the winner has
the right to place the Coon the second time, if the Guide does not wish to do it.

This is often played indoors and sometimes a thimble is used for the Coon.

TALE 83

The Indian Pot

This is something everyone can make, no matter how young, and each, including the Guide, should
make one.

Get a lump of good stiff clay; yellow is better than blue, only because it is a better colour
when finished.

Work the clay up with water till soft, pick out all stones, lumps, and straws. Then roll it
out like a pancake; use a knife to cut this into laces a foot long and about as thick as a pencil.

Dip your fingers in water, take one of these laces and coil it round and round as in "a," soldering
it together with water rubbed on and into the joints. Keep on adding, shaping and rubbing,
till you have a saucer about three inches across and a quarter of an inch thick. Put this away
in some shady place to set, or harden a little; otherwise it would fall down of its own weight.

After about an hour, wet the rim, and build up on that round and round with laces as before,
until you have turned the saucer into a cup, about four inches across, and, maybe three inches
high. Set this away to stiffen. Then finish the shape, by adding more coils, and drawing it
in a little. When this has stiffened, make a "slip" or cream of clay and water, rub this all
over the pot inside and out; use your fingers and a knife to make it smooth and even. When
this is done, use a sharp point, and draw on the pot any of the Indian designs show in the
sketches, using lines and dots for the shading.

Now set the pot in some shady place to dry. High above the stove in the kitchen is a good place,
so long as it is not too near the stove-pipe. After one day bring it nearer the heat. Then
about the second day, put it in the oven. Last of all, and this is the hardest part to do,
let the Guide put the bone-dry pot right into the fire, deep down into the red coals at night,
and leave it there till next day. In the morning when the fire is dead, the pot should be carefully
lifted out, and, if all is well, it will be of hard ringing red terra cotta.

The final firing is always the hardest thing to do, because the pots are so easily cracked.
If they be drawn out of the fire while they are yet hot, the sudden touch of cold air usually
breaks them into pieces.

Now remember, O Guide! A pot is made of the earth, and holds the things that come out of the
earth to make life, that feed us and keep us. So on it, you should draw the symbols that stand
for these things. At the foot of preceding page you see some of them.

TALE 84

Snowflakes, the Sixfold Gems of Snowroba

You have heard of the lovely Snowroba, white calm beautiful Snowroba, the daughter of King
Jackfrost the Winter King, whose sad history was told in the first Tale. You remember how her
robe was trimmed with white lace and crystal gems, each gem with six points and six facets
and six angles, for that is one of the strange laws of the white Kingdom, the sixfold rule
of gems. I did not give a good portrait of the White Princess, but I can show you how to make
the Jewels which sparkled on her robe.

Take a square of thin white paper three or four inches wide (a). Fold it across (b), and again,
until it is a square (c), half as wide as "a." Mark on it the lines as in "d," and fold it
in three equal parts as in "e." Now with pencil draw the heavy black lines as in "f, g, h."
Cut along these lines with scissors, open out the central piece, and you have your snow-gems
as on facing page.

You can see for yourself that these are true to the gem-law of the White Kingdom, if, when
next the snow comes down, you look for the biggest flakes as they lie on some dark surface.
You will find many patterns all of them beautiful, and all of them fashioned in accordance
with the law.

Are You Alive?

Little boy or girl, are you all alive? Just as alive as an Indian? Can you see like a hawk,
feel like a blind man, hear like an owl? Are you quick as a cat? You do not know! Well, let
us find out in the next eight tales. In these tests 100 is kept in view as a perfect score
in each department, although it is possible in some cases to go over that.

TALE 85

Farsight

1. Hold up a page of this book, and see how far off you can read it. If at 60 inches, measured
with a tapeline from your eye to the book, then your eye number is 60, which is remarkably
good. Very few get as high as 70.

2. Now go out at night and see how many Pleiades you can count; see Tale 52. If you see a mere
haze, your star number is 0; if you see 4 little pin points in the haze, your number is 8;
if you see 6, your number is 12. It came from within the vast girdle of mist, and seemed like the cry
of a myriad of lost souls upon the horizon's verge; it was Dante become
audible: and yet it was but the accumulated cries of innumerable seafowl
at the entrance of the outer bay.

Late that night the Planter arrived. We left St. Simon's on the following morning, reached Fort
Clinch by four o'clock, and there transferring two hundred men to
the very scanty quarters of the John Adams, allowed the larger transport
to go into Fernandina, while the two other vessels were to ascend
the St. Mary's River, unless (as proved inevitable in the end) the
defects in the boiler of the Planter should oblige her to remain behind.

That night I proposed to make a sort of trial-trip up stream, as far
as Township landing, some fifteen miles, there to pay our respects
to Captain Clark's company of cavalry, whose camp was reported to
lie near by.

This was included in Corporal Sutton's programme, and seemed to me
more inviting, and far more useful to the men, than any amount of
mere foraging.

The thing really desirable appeared to be to get them under fire as soon as possible, and to
teach them, by a few small successes, the application of what they had learned in camp-.

I had ascertained that the camp of this company lay five miles from the landing, and was accessible
by two roads, one of which was a lumber-path, not commonly used,
but which Corporal Sutton had helped to construct, and along which
he could easily guide us.

 Now
have the Guide hold a man's watch (open if hunting-cased), near your head; if you can hear
it at 40 inches, measured on a tapeline, and prove that you do, by telling exactly where it
is, in several tries, your hearing number is 40, which is high. If at 20 inches, it is low
(20 pts.); if at 60 inches (60 pts.), it is remarkable. Anything over 50 points means you can
hear like an owl. In this you go by your best ear.

2. Pindrop-test. Sometimes it is difficult to get a good watch-test. Then the trial may be
made with an ordinary, silvered brass stick-pin, 1-1/8 inches long, with small head. Lay the
pin on a block of wood that is exactly half an inch thick. Set this on a smooth polished board,
or table top of hardwood, not more than an inch thick, and with open space under it. Set it
away from the edge of the table so as to be clear of the frame and legs. After the warning
"ready," let the Guide tip the block of wood, so the pin drops from the block to the table
top (half an inch). If you hear it at 35 feet in a perfectly still room, your hearing is normal,
and your hearing number is 35. If 20 feet is your farthest limit of hearing it, your number
is 20, which is low. If you can hear it at 70 feet, your number is 70, which is remarkable.

You can use either the watch-test or the pin-test. If you use both, you add the totals together,
and divide by 2, to get your hearing number.

TALE 88

Feeling

1. Have you got wise fingers like a blind man?

Put 10 nickels, 10 coppers and 10 dimes in a hat or in one hand if you like. Then, while blindfolded,
separate them into three separate piles, all of each kind in a separate pile, within 2 minutes.
If it takes you the full 2 minutes (120 seconds), you are slow, and your feel number is 0.
If you do it without a mistake in 1 minute and 20 seconds, your feel number is 40, one point
for each second you are less than 2 minutes. But you must take off 3 points for every one wrongly
placed, so 3 wrongly placed would reduce your 40 to 31. I have known some little boys on the
East Side of New York to do it in 50 seconds without a mistake, so their feel-number by coins
was 70. That is, 120 seconds minus 50 seconds equals 70. This is the best so far.

2. Now get a quart of corn or beans. Then when blindfolded, and using but one hand, lay out
the corn or beans in "threes"; that is, three at a time laid on the table for 2 minutes. The
Guide may move the piles aside as they are made. Then stop and count all that are exactly three
in a pile (those with more or less do not count at all). If there are 40 piles with 3 in each,
40 is your number, by corn.

3. The last test is: Can you lace your shoes in the dark, or blind-folded, finishing with a
neat double bow knot?

Arrange it so your two shoes together have a total of at least 20 holes or hooks to be used
in the test, i. e., which do not have the lace in them when you begin. Allow 1 point for each
hole or hook, i. e., 20 points, finish the lacing in 2 minutes, in any case stop when the 2
minutes is up; then take off 2 points for each one that is wrongly laced, or not laced. Thus:
Supposing 4 are wrong, take off 4 times 2 from 20, and your blindfold lacing number is 12;
if the number wrong was 10 or more, your lacing number is 0; if you had 3 wrong, your number is 14.

Suppose by these three tests--coins, corn, and laces--you scored 40, 30, and 14; add these
together and they give your feel number; 84.

TALE 89

Quickness

Put down 12 potatoes (or other round things) in a row, each one exactly 6 feet from the last,
and the last 12 feet from a box with a hole in it, just large enough to take in one potato.
Now at the word "go," run and get the first potato, put it through the hole into the box; then
get the second, bring it to the box, and so on, one at each trip. After one minute, stop. Now
multiply the number of potatoes in the box by 10, and you have your quickness number. If you
have 8 in the box, you score 80 points, you are as quick as a cat. Very few get over 80. No
one so far has made 100 points.

TALE 90

Guessing Length

Take two common nails, or other thin bits of metal, and lay them on a table or board, at what
you guess to be exactly one yard (36 inches) apart. Then let the Guide lay the tape-line on
it, and, allowing 20 points for exactly right, take off 1 point for each half inch you are
wrong, over or under. Do not count quarter inches, but go by the nearest half-inch mark. Do
this 5 times, add up the totals, that will give your guessing-length number.

Thus, if your first guess turns out to be 37 inches, that is, 2 half-inches too much, 2 from
20 gives 18 points. Your next guess was 34 inches, that is 4 half-inches too little, 4 from
20 gives 16 points. Your next guess gave 12 points, your next 17, and your last 19. The total,
18 plus 16 plus 12 plus 17 plus 19, equals your number of guessing length or 82.

TALE 91

Aim or Limb-control

Take 25 medium-sized potatoes, and set up a bucket or bag whose mouth is round and exactly
one foot across. Draw a line exactly 10 feet from the bucket or bag. Toe that line, and throw
the potatoes, one by one, into the bag. Those that go in, then bounce out, are counted as in.
Do it four times, then add up all the four totals of those that went in; that gives your aim
or control number.

For example, suppose that in the 4 tries you got 10 in the first time, 15 in the second, 20
in the third, 19 in the fourth. Add these together, it gives your arm-control or aim number as 64.

Now add up all these high numbers:

        Farsight                   88
        Quicksight                 50
        Hearing                    50
        Feeling                    84
        Quickness                  80
        Guessing Length            82
        Aim                        64

        Your aliveness number is  498

But very few can score so high. If you can score 400 you are surely alive; you can see like
a hawk, you can take in at a glance, you can hear like an owl, you can feel like a blind man,
you are quick as a cat, you are a good judge of size, and you can aim true; That is, you are
as alive as an Indian.

TALE 92

A Treasure Hunt

Make 24 little white sticks, each about three inches long, and as thick as a pencil. They are
easy to make of willow shoots, after the bark is peeled off. While the young folk hide their
eyes, the Guide walks off in the woods, ties a white rag on a tall stake or limb, for the point
of beginning. Then, one step apart and in a very crooked line, sets each of the little white
sticks in the ground, standing straight up. Under the last stick should be buried the treasure;
usually a stick of chocolate. This the players are to find by following the sticks.

When the young folk get used to it, the line should be longer, the sticks farther apart, and
the last one may be ten steps from the last but one.

When they are well trained at it, scraps of paper, white beans, corn, or even chalk marks on
trees, instead of sticks, will serve for trail; and still later holes prodded in the ground
with a sharp pointed cane will do.

This game can be played in the snow; in which case, the track of the Guide, when he hides the
treasure, takes the place of the sticks.

Finally it makes a good game for indoors on a rainy day. In which case we use buttons, corn,
or scraps of white cotton for trail sticks. Of course the trail now should be upstairs and
down, and as long and crooked as possible.

TALE 93

Moving Pictures

One of the best developers of imagination is the Moving Picture. Sometimes called Pantomime,
or Dumb-show which means all signs without sounds.

The one who is to put on the "movie" is given a subject and must then stand out on the stage
or Council Ring, and carry all the story to the spectators, without using any sound and with
as few accessories as possible.

The "print between the reels" is supplied by the Guide who simply announces what is needed
to explain.

The following subjects have been used successfully (unless otherwise stated they are for one
actor each):

    Miss Muffet and the Spider--the well-known
      Nursery Rhyme
    Old Mother Hubbard
    Little Jack Horner
    Mary and her Little Lamb
    Red Ridinghood--walk through the woods,
      meeting the wolf, etc.
    Robinson Crusoe--finding the track of a man
      in the sand
    A Barber Shop--shaving a customer (two actors)
    The Man's First Speech at a Dinner
    The Politician who was rotten-egged after vainly
      trying to control a meeting
    Joyride in a Ford Car--ending in a bad upset
      (two actors)
    The Operation--a scene in a hospital following
      the accident (two or more)
    The Professor of Hypnotism and His Subject (two actors)
    The Man who Found a Hair in His Soup
    The Young Lady Finds a Purse, on opening it a mouse
      jumps out and she remembers that it is 1st of April
    A Young Man Telephoning to His Best Girl
    A Man Meeting and Killing a Rattlesnake
    Lighting a Lamp

    Goldilocks and the Three Bears
    William Tell and the Apple (best rendered in caricature
      with a pumpkin and two actors)
    Eliza Crossing the Ice
    The Kaiser Signing His Abdication
    The Judgment of Solomon (three actors)
    Brutus Condemning His Two Sons to Death.

TALE 94

A Natural Autograph Album

If you live in the country, I can show you an old Woodcraft trick. Look for a hollow tree.
Sometimes you can pick one out afar, by the dead top, and sometimes by noting a tree that had
lost one of the biggest limbs years ago. In any case, basswoods, old oaks and chestnuts are
apt to be hollow; while hickories and elms are seldom so, for once they yield to decay at all,
they go down.

Remember that every hollow tree is a tenement house of the woods. It may be the home of a score
of different families. Some of these, like Birds and Bats, are hard to observe, except at nesting
time. But the fourfoots are easier to get at. For them, we will arrange a visitors' book at
the foot of the tree, so that every little creature in fur will write his name, and some passing
thought, as he comes to the tree.

How?

Oh, it is simple; I have often done it. First clear and level the ground around the tree for
three or four feet; then cover it with a coat of dust, ashes, or sand--whichever is easiest
to get; rake and brush it smooth; then wait over one night.

Next morning--most quadrupeds are night-walkers--come back; and you will find that every creature
on four feet that went to the tree tenement-house has left us its trail; that is its track
or trace.

No two animals make the same trail, so that every Squirrel that climbed, every 'Coon or 'Possum,
every Tree-mouse, and every Cottontail that went by, has clearly put himself on record without
meaning to do so; and we who study Woodcraft can read the record, and tell just who passed
by in the night.

TALE 95

The Crooked Stick

Once upon a time there was a girl who was very anxious to know what sort of a husband she should
get; so, of course, she went to the old wood-witch.

The witch asked a few questions, then said to the girl: "You walk straight through that woods,
turn neither to right nor left, and never turn back an inch, and pick me out a straight stick,
the straighter the better; but pick only one, and bring it back."

So the girl set out. Soon she saw a fine-looking stick close at hand; but it had a slight blemish
near one end, so she said: "No; I can do better than that." Then she saw another that was perfect
but for a little curve in the middle, so she passed it by.

Thus she went, seeing many that were nearly perfect; but walking on, seeking one better, till
she was quite through the woods. Then she realized her chances were nearly gone; so she had
to take the only stick she could find, a very crooked one indeed, and brought it to the witch,
saying that she "could have got a much better one had she been more easily satisfied at the
beginning."

The witch took the stick, waved it at the girl and said: "then this is your fortune; through
the woods and through the woods and out with a crooked stick. If you were less hard to please,
you would have better luck; but you will pass many a good man by, and come out with a crooked
stick."

       *       *       *       *       *

Maybe some of our Woodcraft girls can find an initiation in this. Put it just as the witch
did it, but let it be considered a success if the stick is two feet long and nowhere half an
inch out of true line. Let me add a Woodcraft proverb which should also have its mead of comfort--The
Great Spirit can draw a straight line with a crooked stick.

TALE 96

The Animal Dance of Nana-bo-jou

For this we need a Nana-bo-jou; that is, a grown-up who can drum and sing. He has a drum and
drumstick, and a straw or paper club; also two goblins, these are good-sized boys or girls
wearing ugly masks, or at least black hoods with two eyeholes, made as hideous as possible;
and any number of children, from three or four up, for animals. If each has the marks, colours,
etc., of some bird or beast, so much the better.

First, Nana-bo-jou is seen chasing the children around the outside of the circle, trying to
catch one to eat; but failing, thinks he'll try a trick and he says: "Stop, stop, my brothers.
Why should we quarrel? Come, let's hold a council together and I will teach you a new dance."

The animals whisper together and the Coyote comes forward, barks, then says:

"Nana-bo-jou, I am the Coyote. The animals say that they will come to council if you will really
make peace and play no tricks."

"Tricks!" says Nana-bo-jou, "I only want to teach you the new songs from the South."

Then all the animals troop in and sit in a circle. Nana-bo-jou takes his drum and begins to sing:

        "New songs from the South, my brothers,
         Dance to the new songs."

Turning to one, he says: "Who are you and what can you dance?"

The answers are, "I am the Beaver [or whatever it is] and I can dance the Beaver Dance."

"Good! Come and show me how."

So the Beaver dances to the music, slapping the back of his flat right hand, up and under his
left hand for a tail, holding up a stick in both paws to gnaw it, and lumbering along in time
to the music, at the same time imitating the Beaver's waddle.

Nana-bo-jou shouts: "Fine! That is the best Beaver Dance I ever saw. You are wonderful; all
you need to be perfect is wings. Wouldn't you like to have wings so you could fly over the
tree-tops, like the Eagle?"

"Yes," says the Beaver.

"I can make strong medicine and give you wings, if all the animals will help me," says Nana-bo-jou.
"Will you?"

"Yes," they all cry.

"Then all close your eyes tight and cover them with your paws. Don't look until I tell you.
Beaver, close your eyes and dance very fast and I will make magic to give you wings."

All close and cover their eyes. Nana-bo-jou sings very loudly and, rushing on the Beaver, hits
him on the head with the straw club. The Beaver falls dead. The two goblins run in from one
side and drag off the body.

Then Nana-bo-jou shouts: "Look, look, now! See how he flies away! See, there goes the Beaver
over the tree-tops." All look as he points and seem to see the Beaver going.

Different animals and birds are brought out to dance their dances and are killed as before.
Then the Crow comes out, hopping, flopping, cawing. Nana-bo-jou looks at him and says: "You
are too thin. You are no good. You don't need any more wings," and so sends him to sit down.

Then the Coyote comes out to do the Coyote Dance, imitating Coyote, etc.; but he is very suspicious
and, in answer to the questions, says: "No; I don't want wings. The Great Spirit gave me good
legs, so I am satisfied"; then goes back to his seat.

Next the Deer, the Sheep, etc., come out and are killed; while all the rest are persuaded that
the victims flew away. But the Coyote and the Loon have their doubts. They danced in their
turns, but said they didn't want any change. They are satisfied as the Great Spirit made them.
They are slow about hiding their eyes. At last, they peek and realize that it is all a trap
and the Loon shouts: "Nana-bo-jou is killing us! It is all a trick! Fly for your lives!"

As they all run away, Nana-bo-jou pursues the Loon, hitting him behind with the club, which
is the reason that the Loon has no tail and has been lame behind ever since.

The Loon shouts the Loon battle-cry, a high-pitched quavering LUL-L-L-O-O-O and faces Nana-bo-jou;
the animals rally around the Loon and the Coyote to attack the magician. All point their fingers
at him shouting "Wakan Seecha" (or Black Magic). He falls dead in the circle. They bury him
with branches, leaves, or a blanket, and all the animals do their dances around him.

Before beginning, the story of the dance should be told to the audience.

TALE 97

The Caribou Dance

The easiest of our campfire dances to learn, and the best for quick presentation, is the Caribou
Dance. It has been put on for public performance after twenty minutes' rehearsing, with those
who never saw it before, because it is all controlled and called off by the Chief. It does
equally well for indoor gymnasium or for campfire in the woods.

In the way of fixings for this, you need only four pairs of horns and four cheap bows. Real
deer horns may be used, but they are scarce and heavy. It is better to go out where you can
get a few crooked limbs of oak, cedar, hickory or apple tree; and cut eight pairs, as near
like those in the cut as possible, each about two feet long and one inch thick at the butt.
Peel these, for they should be white; round off all sharp points of the branches, then lash
them in pairs, as shown. A pair, of course, is needed for each Caribou. These are held in the
hand and above the head, or in the hand resting on the head.

The four Caribou look best in white. Three or four hunters are needed. They should have bows,
but no arrows. The Chief should have a drum and be able to sing the Muje Mukesin, or other
Indian dance tune. One or two persons who can howl like Wolves should be sent off to one side,
and another that can yell like a Lynx or a Panther on the other side, well away from the ring.
Otherwise the Chief or leader can do the imitations. Now we are ready for

THE DANCE OF THE WHITE CARIBOU

The Chief begins by giving three thumps on his drum to call attention; then says in a loud,
singing voice: "The Caribou have not come on our hunting grounds for three snows. We need meat.
Thus only can we bring them back, by the big medicine of the Caribou Dance, by the power of
the White Caribou."

He rolls his drum, then in turn faces each of the winds, beckoning, remonstrating, and calling
them by name; Kitchi-nodin (West); Keeway-din (North); Wabani-nodin (East); Shawani-nodin (South).
Calling last to the quarter whence the Caribou are to come, finishing the call with a long
KO-KEE-NA. Then as he thumps a slow single beat the four Caribou come in in single file, at
a stately pace timed to the drum. Their heads are high, and they hold the horns on their heads,
with one hand, as they proudly march around. The Chief shouts: "The Caribou, The Caribou!"
After going round once in a sun circle (same way as the sun), they go each to a corner. The
Chief says: "They honour the symbol of the Great Spirit." The drum stops; all four march to
the fire. They bow to it together, heads low, and utter a long bellow.

Then the Chief shouts: "They honour the four Winds, the Messengers."

Then the Caribou back up four paces each, turn suddenly and make a short bow, with a short
bellow, then turn and again face the fire.

The Chief shouts: "Now they live their wild free lives on the plain." He begins any good dance
song and beats double time. The Caribou dance around once in a circle.

The Chief shouts: "Full of life they fight among themselves."

The first and second Caribou, and third and fourth, close in combat. They lower their heads,
lock horns held safely away from the head, snort, kick up the dust, and dance around each other
two or three times.

The music begins again, and they cease fighting and dance in a circle once more.

The music stops. The Chief shouts: "They fight again." Now the first and fourth and second
and third lock horns and fight.

After a round or so the music begins again and they cease fighting and again circle, dancing
as before.

The Chief calls out: "The Wolves are on their track."

Now the howling of Wolves is heard in the distance, from the fellows already posted.

The Caribou rush toward that side and face it in a row, threatening, with horns low, as they
snort, stamp, and kick up the dust.

The Wolf-howling ceases. The Caribou are victorious. The Chief shouts: "They have driven off
the Wolves." They turn away and circle once to the music, holding their heads high.

Now Panther-yelling (or other menacing sound) is heard in the other direction. The Chief shouts:
"But now the Panthers have found them out."

Again the Caribou line up and show fight. When it ceases, the Chief cries out: "They have driven
off the Panther." Now they dance proudly around, heads up, chests out as they step, for they
have conquered every foe.

Then the Chief calls out: "But another, a deadlier enemy comes. The hunters are on their trail."
The hunters appear, crawling very low and carrying bows. They go half around the ring, each
telling those behind by signs, "Here they are; we have found them," "Four big fellows," "Come
on," etc. When they come opposite the Caribou, the first hunter lets off a short "yelp." The
Caribou spring to the opposite side of the ring, and then line up to defy this new noise; but
do not understand it, so gaze as they prance about in fear. The hunters draw their bows together,
and make as though each lets fly an arrow. The first Caribou drops, the others turn in fear
and run around about half of the ring, heads low, and not dancing; then they dash for the timber.
The hunters run forward with yells. The leader holds up the horns. All dance and yell around
the fallen Caribou and then drag it off the scene.

The Chief then says: "Behold, it never fails; the Caribou dance brings the Caribou. It is great
medicine. Now there is meat in the lodge and the children cry no longer."

The Council Robe

The Woodcraft Council Robe is something which every one may have, and should make for himself.
It may be of any shade, of gray, buff, orange, or scarlet. The best ones are of a bright buff.
In size they are about five feet by six feet, and the stuff may be wool, cotton, silk, or a
mixture. My own is of soft or blanket cotton.

The robe is used as a wall banner, a personal robe, or a bed spread, and has for the first
purpose two or more tag-loops sewn on the top. For the second, it has a head-hole or poncho-hole,
an upright slit near one end (hh), and for the last, there are one or two buttons or tie-strings
to close the poncho-hole. These are the useful features of the robe.

The ornamental features are the records on it. While these vary with each owner, the following
usually appear: The Fourfold fire, near the middle; the Woodcraft shield, the owner's totem,
the symbols of each coup and each degree won by the owner.

To this many add a pictographic record of great events or of camps they have visited.

The easiest way to make the robe is to use paints on the cotton fabric.

The favourite way and more beautiful way, is to use appliqués of coloured cloths for the design.

The most beautiful is to embroider in silk or mercerized cotton. But the last is very slow,
and calls for much labour as well as some money.

On the preceding page are shown four different styles of robe; you may choose or adapt which
you please, except that only a Sagamore may use the one with the 24 feathers in the centre.

How the Wren Became King of the Birds

The story is very old, and it may not be true, but this is how they tell it in many countries.

The animals had chosen the lion for their King because his looks and his powers seemed to fit
him best of all for the place. So the birds made up their minds that they also would have a
royal leader.

After a long council it was decided that, in spite of strong opposition from the Ostrich and
his followers, the one with the greatest powers of flight should be King. And away all flew
to see which could go the highest.

One by one they came down tired out, till only two were to be seen in the air: the Eagle and
the Turkey-buzzard still going up. At last they got so high that the Turkey-buzzard froze his
ears off for they were naked. Then he gave it up. The Eagle went still higher to show how strong
he was, then sailed downward to claim the royal honours.

But just as they were about to give him the crown, the Wren hopped off the top of the Eagle's
head, where he had been hiding in the long feathers, and squeaked out, "No matter how high
he was, I was a little bit higher, so I am King."

"You," said the Eagle; "Why I carried you up."

"Nothing to do with it," said the Wren.

"Then let's try it over," said the Eagle.

"No, no," said the Wren, "one try was agreed on, and it's settled now, I was higher than you."

And they have been disputing over it ever since. A boyish feeling, no doubt, and one that time diminishes,
without effacing; yet it is a feeling which lies at the bottom of
many rash actions in war, and of some brilliant ones.

For one, I could never quite outgrow it, though restricted by duty from doing many foolish things
in consequence, and also restrained by reverence for certain confidential advisers whom I
had always at hand, and who considered it their mission to keep me
always on short rations of personal adventure.

Indeed, most of that sort of entertainment in the army devolves upon
scouts detailed for the purpose, volunteer aides-de-camp and newspaper-reporters,--other
officers being expected to be about business more prosaic.

All the excitements of war are quadrupled by darkness; and as I rode along our outer lines
at night, and watched the glimmering flames which at regular intervals starred the opposite river-shore,
the longing was irresistible to cross the barrier of dusk, and see
whether it were men or ghosts who hovered round those dying embers.

I had yielded to these impulses in boat-adventures by night,--for it was a part of my instructions
to obtain all possible information about the Rebel outposts,--and fascinating indeed it was to
glide along, noiselessly paddling, with a dusky guide, through the
endless intricacies of those Southern marshes, scaring the reed-birds,
which wailed and fled away into the darkness, and penetrating several
miles into the ulterior, between hostile fires, where discovery might
be death.

Yet there were drawbacks as to these enterprises, since it is not
easy for a boat to cross still water, even on the darkest night, without
being seen by watchful eyes; and, moreover, the extremes of high and
low tide transform so completely the whole condition of those rivers
that it needs very nice calculation to do one's work at precisely
the right tune.

To vary the experiment, I had often thought of trying a personal reconnoissance by swimming, at
a certain point, whenever circumstances should make it an object.

The opportunity at last arrived, and I shall never forget the glee with which, after several postponements,
I finally rode forth, a little before midnight, on a night which seemed made for the purpose.
 He used to look, not at the flowers, but deep down
into them, and not at the singing bird, but into its eyes, to its little heart; and so he got
an insight better than most others, and he quite gave up collecting birds' eggs.

But the woods were full of mysteries. He used to hear little bursts of song, and when he came
to the place he could find no bird there. Noises and movements would just escape him. In the
woods he saw strange tracks, and one day, at length, he saw a wonderful bird making these very
tracks. He had never seen the bird before, and would have thought it a great rarity had he
not seen its tracks everywhere. So he learned that the woods were full of beautiful creatures
that were skillful and quick to avoid him.

One day, as he passed by a spot for the hundredth time, he found a bird's nest. It must have
been there for long, and yet he had not seen it; and so he learned how blind he was, and he
exclaimed: "Oh, if only I could see, then I might understand these things! If only I knew!
If I could see but for once, how many there are, and how near! If only every bird would wear
over its nest this evening a little lamp to show me!"

The sun was down now; but all at once there was a soft light on the path, and in the middle
of it the brown boy saw a Little Brown Lady in a long robe, and in her hand a rod.

She smiled pleasantly and said: "Little boy, I am the Fairy of this Woods. I have been watching
you for long. I like you. You seem to be different from other boys. Your request shall be granted."

Then she faded away. But at once the whole landscape twinkled over with wonderful little lamps--long
lamps, short lamps, red, blue, and green, high and low, doubles, singles, and groups; wherever
he looked were lamps--twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, here and everywhere, until the forest shone
like the starry sky. He ran to the nearest, yes, a nest; and here and there, each different
kind of lamp stood for another kind of nest. A beautiful purple blaze in a low tangle caught
his eye. He ran to it, and found a nest he had never seen before. It was full of purple eggs,
and there was the rare bird he had seen but once. It was chanting the weird song he had often
heard, but never traced. But the eggs were the marvelous things. His old egg-collecting instinct
broke out. He reached forth to clutch the wonderful prize, and--in an instant all the lights
went out. There was nothing but the black woods about him. Then on the pathway shone again
the soft light. It grew brighter, till in the middle of it he saw the Little Brown Lady--the
Fairy of the Woods. But she was not smiling now. Her face was stern and sad, as she said: "I
fear I set you over-high. I thought you better than the rest. Keep this in mind:

        "Who reverence not the
         lamp of life can never
         see its light."

Then she faded from his view, and he never saw the lamps again.

The Sweetest Sad Song in the Woods

Once a great American poet was asked which he thought was the sweetest voice in the woods.
He said: "The sweetest sound in Nature is the calling of the Screech Owl."

Sometimes, though rarely, it does screech, but the sound it most often makes is the soft mournful
song that it sings in the woods at night, especially in the autumn nights.

It seems to be moaning a lament for the falling leaves, a sad good-bye to the dear dying summer.

Last autumn one sat above my head in the dark October woods, and put his little soul into a
song that seemed to be

        Ohhhh! Ohhhh!
        The leaves are falling:
        Ohhhh! Ohhhh!
        A sad voice calling;
        Ohhhh! Ohhhh!
        The Woodbirds flying;
        Ohhhh! Ohhhh!
        Sweet summer's dying,
        Dying, Dying.

A mist came into my eyes as I listened, and yet I thanked him. "Dear voice in the trees, you
have said the things I felt, and could not say; but voicing my sadness you have given it wings
to fly away."

Springtime, or the Wedding of Maka Ina and El Sol

Oh, that was a stirring, glowing time! All the air, and the underwood seemed throbbed with
pleasant murmuring voices. The streams were laughing, the deep pools smiling, as pussy-willows
scattered catkins on them from above. The oak trees and the birches put on little glad-hangers,
like pennants on a gala ship. The pine trees set up their green candles, one on every big tip-twig.
The dandelions made haste to glint the early fields with gold. The song toads and the peepers
sang in volleys; the blackbirds wheeled their myriad cohorts in the air, a guard of honour
in review. The woodwale drummed. The redbud draped its naked limbs in early festal bloom; and
Rumour the pretty liar smiled and spread the news.

All life was smiling with the frank unselfish smile, that tells of pleasure in another's joy.

The love of love is wider than the world. And one who did not know their speech could yet have
read in their reflected joy a magnitude of joyful happening, could guess that over two beings
of the highest rank, the highest rank of happiness impended.

Yes, all the living world stood still at gaze: the story of the bridegroom, the gracious beauty
of the bride were sung, for the wedding day had come. And Mother Carey, she was there, for
were they not her peers? And the Evil One--he came, but slunk away, for the blessing of the
one Great Oversoul was on them.

Oh, virile, radiant one, El Sol! Oh, Maka Ina! bounteous mother earth, the day of joining hand
in hand passed by. The joy is with us yet; renewed each year, when March is three weeks gone.
Look, then, ye wanderers in the woods! Seek in the skies, seek in the growing green, but find
it mostly in your souls, and sing!

TALE 104

Running the Council

Every good Woodcrafter should know the way of the Council Ring.

Select some quiet level place out of doors; in the woods if possible, for it is so much better
if surrounded by trees.

Make a circle of low seats; the circle should be not less than 12 feet or more than 20 feet
across, depending somewhat on the number to take part.

In the middle prepare for a small fire. At one side is a special seat for the Chief; this is
called the Council Rock.

On very important occasions take white sand or lime, and draw a circle around the fire. Then
from that draw the four lamps and the twelve laws as in Tale 105.

When all is ready with the Guide on the Council Rock, and the Scouts in their seats, the Guide
stands up and says: "Give ear my friends, we are about to hold a council. I appoint such a
one, Keeper of the fire and so-and-so, Keeper of the tally. Now let the Fire-keeper light the
fire."

Next the Tally-keeper calls the roll. After which the business part of the Council is carried
on exactly the same as any ordinary meeting, except that instead of addressing the "Chairman,"
they say, "O Chief"; instead of "yes" they say "ho," instead of "no" they say "wah."

The order of doings in Council is:--

        Opening and fire-lighting
        Roll Call
        Reading and accepting tally of last Council
        Reports of Scouts (things observed or done)
        Left-over business
        New business
        Honours
        Honourable mention
        (For the good of the Tribe) Complaints and suggestions.
          (Here business ends and entertainment begins.)
        Challenges
        Games, contests, etc.
        Close by singing Omaha Prayer (Tale 108)

The Sandpainting of the Fire

When I was staying among the Navaho Indians, I met John Wetherall, the trader. He had spent
half his life among them, and knew more of their ways than any other white man that I met.
He told me that part of the education of Navaho priest was knowing the fifty sandpaintings
of his tribe. A sandpainting is a design made on the ground or floor with dry sands of different
colours--black, white, gray, yellow, red, etc. It looks like a rug or a blanket on the ground,
and is made up of many curious marks which stand for some man, place, thing, or idea. Thus,
the first sandpainting is a map of the world as the Navaho knew it, with rivers and hills that
are important in their history. These sandpaintings cannot be moved; a careless touch spoils
them, and a gust of wind can wipe them out. They endure only in the hearts and memories of
the people who love them.

In the Woodcraft Camp there is but one sandpainting that is much used; that is, the Sandpainting
of the Fourfold Fire. When I make it in camp, I use only white sand or powdered lime; but indoors,
or on paper, I use yellow (or orange) and white.

This is the story of the sandpainting. The fire is the symbol of the Great Spirit; around that
we draw a great circle, as in the diagram.

At each of the four sides we light another fire; these four are called Fortitude, Beauty, Truth,
and Love, and come from the Fire through Spirit, Body, Mind, and Service.

Then from each of these we draw three golden rays. These stand for the twelve laws of Woodcraft,
and they are named in this way:

        Be Brave, Be Silent and Obey;
        Be Clean, Be Strong, Protect Wild Life alway;
        Speak True, Be Reverent, Play Fair as you Strive!
        Be Kind; Be Helpful; Glad you are alive.

And the final painting is as in the drawing. Of course the names are not written on the real
thing though the Woodcraft scout should know them.

The Woodcraft Kalendar

The Woodcraft Kalendar is founded on the Indian way of noting the months. Our own ancestors
called them "Moons" much as the Indians did. Our word "month" was once written "moneth" or
"monath" which meant a "moon or moon's time of lasting." The usual names for the moons to-day
are Latin, but we find we get closer to nature if we call them by their Woodcraft names, and
use the little symbols of the Woodcraft Kalendar.

TALE 107

Climbing the Mountain

Afar in our dry southwestern country is an Indian village; and in the offing is a high mountain,
towering up out of the desert. It is considered a great feat to climb this mountain, so that
all the boys of the village were eager to attempt it. One day the Chief said: "Now boys, you
you may all go to-day and try to climb the mountain. Start right after breakfast, and go each
of you as far as you can. Then when you are tired, come back: but let each one bring me a twig
from the place where he turned."

Away they went full of hope, each feeling that he surely could reach the top.

But soon a fat, pudgy boy came slowly back, and in his hand he held out to the Chief a leaf
of cactus.

The Chief smiled and said: "My boy, you did not reach the foot of the mountain; you did not
even get across the desert."

Later a second boy returned. He carried a twig of sagebrush.

"Well," said the Chief. "You reached the mountain's foot but you did not climb upward."

The next had a cottonwood spray.

"Good," said the Chief; "You got up as far as the springs."

Another came later with some buckthorn. The Chief smiled when he saw it and spoke thus: "You
were climbing; you were up to the first slide rock."

Later in the afternoon, one arrived with a cedar spray, and the old man said: "Well done. You
went half way up."

An hour afterward, one came with a switch of pine. To him the Chief said: "Good; you went to
the third belt; you made three quarters of the climb."

The sun was low when the last returned. He was a tall, splendid boy of noble character. His
hand was empty as he approached the Chief, but his countenance was radiant, and he said: "My
father, there were no trees where I got to; I saw no twigs, but I saw the Shining Sea."

Now the old man's face glowed too, as he said aloud and almost sang: "I knew it. When I looked
on your face, I knew it. You have been to the top. You need no twigs for token. It is written
in your eyes, and rings in your voice. My boy, you have felt the uplift, you have seen the
glory of the mountain."

       *       *       *       *       *

Oh Ye Woodcrafters, keep this in mind, then: the badges that we offer for attainment, are not
"prizes"; prizes are things of value taken by violence from their rightful owners. These are
merely tokens of what you have done, of where you have been. They are mere twigs from the trail
to show how far you got in climbing the mountain.

(By permission from Alice C. Fletcher's "Indian Story and Song.")

Translation:

        Father a needy one stands before thee;
        I that sing am he.

This old Indian prayer is sung by the Council standing in a great circle about the fire with
feet close together, hands and faces uplifted, for it is addressed to the Great Spirit. At
the final bars the hands and faces are lowered to the fire.
