2605. In cases of great emergency, such as the strong kind of apoplexy, and when a surgeon
cannot possibly be obtained for some considerable time, the life of the patient depends almost
entirely upon the fact of his being bled or not. We therefore give instructions how the operation
of bleeding is to be performed, but caution the reader only to attempt it in cases of the greatest
emergency. Place a handkerchief or piece of tape rather but not too tightly round the arm,
about three or four inches above the elbow. This will cause the veins below to swell and become
very evident. If this is not sufficient, the hand should be constantly and quickly opened and
shut for the same purpose. There will now be seen, passing up the middle of the fore-arm, a
vein which, just below the bend of the elbow, sends a branch inwards and outwards, each branch
shortly joining another large vein. It is from the outer branch--that the person is to be bled.
The right arm is the one mostly operated on. The operator should take the lancet in his right
hand, between the thumb and first finger, place the thumb of his left hand on the vein below
the part where he is going to bleed from, and then gently thrust the tip of the lancet into
the vein, and, taking care not to push it too deeply, cut in a gently curved direction, thus
and bring it out, point upwards, at about half an inch from the part of the vein into which
he had thrust it. The vein must be cut lengthways, and not across. When sufficient blood has
been taken away, remove the bandage from above the elbow, and place the thumb of the left hand
firmly over the cut, until all the bleeding ceases. A small pad of lint is then to be put over
the cut, with a larger pad over it, and the two kept in their places by means of a handkerchief
or linen roller bound pretty tightly over them and round the arm.

2606. When a person is bled, he should always be in the standing, or at any rate in the sitting,
position; for if, as is often the case, he should happen to faint, he can, in, most eases at
least, easily be brought to again by the operator placing him flat on his back, and stopping
the bleeding. This is of the greatest importance. It has been recommended, for what supposed
advantages we don't know, to bleed people when they are lying down. Should a person, under
these circumstances, faint, what could be done to bring him to again? The great treatment of
lowering the body of the patient to the flat position cannot be followed here. It is in that
position already, and cannot be placed lower than it at present is--except, as is most likely
to be the case, under the ground.

2607. BLEEDING FROM THE NOSE.--Many children, especially those of a sanguineous temperament,
are subject to sudden discharges of blood from some part of the body; and as all such fluxes
are in general the result of an effort of nature to relieve the system from some overload or
pressure, such discharges, unless in excess, and when likely to produce debility, should not
be rashly or too abruptly checked. In general, these discharges are confined to the summer
or spring months of the year, and follow pains in the head, a sense of drowsiness, languor,
or oppression; and, as such symptoms are relieved by the loss of blood, the hemorrhage should,
to a certain extent, be encouraged. When, however, the bleeding is excessive, or returns too
frequently, it becomes necessary to apply means to subdue or mitigate the amount. For this
purpose the sudden and unexpected application of cold is itself sufficient, in most cases,
to arrest the most active hemorrhage. A wet towel laid suddenly on the back, between the shoulders,
and placing the child in a recumbent posture, is often sufficient to effect the object; where,
however, the effusion resists such simple means, napkins wrung out of cold water must be laid
across the forehead and nose, the hands dipped in cold water, and a bottle of hot water applied
to the feet. If, in spite of these means, the bleeding continues, a little fine wool or a few
folds of lint, tied together by a piece of thread, must be pushed up the nostril from which
the blood flows, to act as a plug and pressure on the bleeding vessel. When the discharge has
entirely ceased, the plug is to be pulled out by means of the thread. To prevent a repetition
of the hemorrhage, the body should be sponged every morning with cold water, and the child
put under a course of steel wine, have open-air exercise, and, if possible, salt-water bathing.
For children, a key suddenly dropped down the back between the skin and clothes, will often
immediately arrest a copious bleeding.

2608. SPITTING OF BLOOD, or hemorrhage from the lungs, is generally known from blood from the
stomach by its being of a brighter colour, and in less quantities than that, which is always
grumous and mixed with the half-digested food. In either case, rest should be immediately enjoined,
total abstinence from stimulants, and a low, poor diet, accompanied with the horizontal position,
and bottles of boiling water to the feet. At the same time the patient should suck through
a quill, every hour, half a wine-glass of water in which 10 or 15 drops of the elixir of vitriol
has been mixed, and, till further advice has been procured, keep a towel wrung out of cold
water on the chest or stomach, according to the seat of the hemorrhage.

Bites and Stings.

2609. BITES AND STINGS may be divided into three kinds:--1. Those of Insects. 2. Those of Snakes.
3. Those of Dogs and other Animals.

2610. 1. The Bites or Stings of Insects, such as gnats, bees, wasps, &c., need cause very little
alarm, and are, generally speaking, easily cured. They are very serious, however, when they
take place on some delicate part of the body, such as near the eye, or in the throat. The treatment
is very simple in most cases; and consists in taking out the sting, if it is left behind, with
a needle, and applying to the part a liniment made of finely-scraped chalk and olive-oil, mixed
together to about the thickness of cream.

2611. Bathing the part bitten with warm turpentine or warm vinegar is also of great use. If
the person feels faint, he should lie quietly on his back, and take a little brandy-and-water,
or sal-volatile and water. When the inside of the throat is the part stung, there is great
danger of violent inflammation taking place. In this case, from eight to twelve leeches should
be immediately put to the outside of the throat, and when they drop off, the part to which
they had been applied should be well fomented with warm water. The inside of the throat is
to be constantly gargled with salt and water. Bits of ice are to be sucked. Rubbing the face
and hands well over with plain olive-oil, before going to bed, will often keep gnats and musquitoes
from biting during the night. Strong scent, such as eau-de-Cologne, will have the same effect.

2612. 2. Bites of Snakes.--These are much more dangerous than the preceding, and require more
powerful remedies. The bites of the different kinds of snakes do not all act alike, but affect
people in different ways.--Treatment of the part bitten. The great thing is to prevent the
poison getting into the blood; and, if possible, to remove the whole of it at once from the
body. A pocket-handkerchief, a piece of tape or cord, or, in fact, of anything that is at hand,
should be tied tightly round the part of the body bitten; if it be the leg or arm, immediately
above the bite, and between it and the heart. The bite should then be sucked several times
by any one who is near. There is no danger in this, provided the person who does it has not
got the skin taken off any part of his mouth. What has been sucked into the mouth should be
immediately spit out again. But if those who are near have sufficient nerve for the operation,
and a suitable instrument, they should cut out the central part bitten, and then bathe the
wound for some time with warm water, to make it bleed freely. The wound should afterwards be
rubbed with a stick of lunar caustic, or, what is better, a solution of this--60 grains of
lunar caustic dissolved in an ounce of water--should be dropped into it. The band should be
kept on the part during the whole of the time that these means are being adopted. The wound
should afterwards be covered with lint dipped in cold water. The best plan, however, to be
adopted, if it can be managed, is the following:--take a common wine-glass, and, holding it
upside down, put a lighted candle or a spirit-lamp into it for a minute or two. This will take
out the air. Then clap the glass suddenly over the bitten part, and it will become attached,
and hold on to the flesh. The glass being nearly empty, the blood containing the poison will,
in consequence, flow into it from the wound of its own accord. This process should be repeated
three or four times, and the wound sucked, or washed with warm water, before each application
of the glass. As a matter of course, when the glass is removed, all the blood should be washed
out of it before it is applied again.--Constitutional Treatment. There is mostly at first great
depression of strength in these cases, and it is therefore requisite to give some stimulant;
a glass of hot brandy-and-water, or twenty drops of sal-volatile, is the best that can be given.
When the strength has returned, and if the patient has not already been sick, a little mustard
in hot water should be given, to make him so. If, on the other hand, as is often the case,
the vomiting is excessive, a large mustard poultice should be placed over the stomach, and
a grain of solid opium swallowed in the form of a pill, for the purpose of stopping it. Only
one of these pills should be given by a non-professional person. In all cases of bites from
snakes, send for a surgeon as quickly as possible, and act according to the above directions
until he arrives. If he is within any reasonable distance, content yourself by putting on the
band, sucking the wound, applying the glass, and, if necessary, giving a little brandy-and-water.

2613. 3. Sociable, and even somewhat frisky, there was a good, sound, human kernel in the woman;
a warmth of love, strong dogmatic religious feeling, and a considerable, but not authoritative,
sense of the proprieties. Of what biographers refer to daintily as "her somewhat voluptuous
style of beauty," judging from the silhouette in Mr. Scott Douglas's invaluable edition, the
reader will be fastidious if he does not approve.

Take her for all in all, I believe she was the best woman Burns encountered.

The pair took a fancy for each other on the spot; Mrs. M'Lehose, in her turn, invited him to
tea; but the poet, in his character of the Old Hawk, preferred a TETE-A- TETE, excused himself
at the last moment, and offered a visit instead. An accident confined him to his room for nearly
a month, and this led to the famous Clarinda and Sylvander correspondence. It was begun in simple
sport; they are already at their fifth or sixth exchange, when Clarinda writes: "It is really curious
so much FUN passing between two persons who saw each other only ONCE;" but it is hardly safe for a
man and woman in the flower of their years to write almost daily, and sometimes in terms too
ambiguous, sometimes in terms too plain, and generally in terms too warm, for mere acquaintance.
The exercise partakes a little of the nature of battering, and danger may be apprehended when
next they meet.
In the first place make the joint, from which the bone has been displaced, perfectly steady,
either by fixing it to some firm object or else by holding it with the hands; then pull the
dislocated bone in a direction towards the place from which it has been thrust, so that, if
it moves at all from its unnatural position, it may have the best chance of returning to its
proper place. Do not, however, pull or press against the parts too violently, as you may, perhaps,
by doing so, rupture blood-vessels, and produce most serious consequences. When you do attempt
to reduce a dislocated bone, do it as quickly as possible after the accident has taken place,
every hour making the operation more difficult. When the patient is very strong, he may be
put into a warm bath until he feels faint, or have sixty drops of antimonial wine given him
every ten minutes until he feels sickish. These two means are of great use in relaxing the
muscles. If the bone has been brought back again to its proper place, keep it there by means
of bandages; and if there is much pain about the joint, apply a cold lotion to it, and keep
it perfectly at rest. The lotion should be, a dessert-spoonful of Goulard's extract, and two
tablespoonfuls of vinegar, mixed in a pint of water. Leeches are sometimes necessary. Unless
the local pain, or general feverish symptoms, are great, the patient's diet should be the same
as usual. Dislocations may be reduced a week, or even a fortnight, after they have taken place.
As, therefore, although the sooner a bone is reduced the better, there is no very great emergency,
and as the most serious consequences may follow improper or too violent treatment, it is always
better for people in these cases to do too little than too much; inasmuch as the good which
has not yet may still be done, whereas the evil that has been done cannot so easily be undone.

2615. FRACTURES OF BONES.--Symptoms. 1. Deformity of the part. 2. Unnatural looseness. 3. A
grating sound when the two ends of the broken bone are rubbed together. 4. Loss of natural
motion and power. In some cases there is also shortening of the limb.--Fracture takes place
from several causes, as a fall, a blow, a squeeze, and sometimes from the violent action of
muscles.--Treatment. In cases where a surgeon cannot be procured immediately after the accident,
the following general rules are offered for the reader's guidance:--The broken limb should
be placed and kept as nearly as possible in its natural position. This is to be done by first
pulling the two portions of the bone in opposite directions, until the limb becomes as long
as the opposite one, and then by applying a splint, and binding it to the part by means of
a roller. When there is no deformity, the pulling is of course unnecessary. If there is much
swelling about the broken part, a cold lotion is to be applied. This lotion (which we will
call Lotion No. 1) may be thus made:--Mix a dessert-spoonful of Goulard's extract and two tablespoonfuls
of vinegar in a pint of water. When the leg or arm is broken, always, if possible, get it to
the same length and form as the opposite limb. The broken part should be kept perfectly quiet.
When a broken limb is deformed, and a particular muscle is on the stretch, place the limb in
such a position as will relax it. This will in most cases cure the deformity. Brandy-and-water,
or sal-volatile and water, are to be given when the patient is faint. Surgical aid should,
of course, be procured as soon as possible.

2616. JOINTS, INJURIES TO.--All kinds of injuries to joints, of whatever description, require
particular attention, in consequence of the violent inflammations which are so liable to take
place in these parts of the body, and which do so much mischief in a little time. The joint
injured should always be kept perfectly at rest; and when it is very painful, and the skin
about it red, swollen, hot, and shining, at the same time that the patient has general feverish
symptoms, such as great thirst and headache--leeches, and when they drop off, warm poppy fomentations,
are to be applied; the No. 1 pills above-mentioned are to be given (two are a dose for a grown
person) with a black draught three hours afterwards. Give also two tablespoonfuls of the fever-mixture
every four hours, and keep the patient on low diet. When the injury and swelling are not very
great, warm applications, with rest, low diet, and a dose of aperient medicine, will be sufficient.
When a joint has received a penetrating wound, it will require the most powerful treatment,
and can only be properly attended to by a surgeon. The patient's friends will have to use their
own judgment to a great extent in these and in many other cases, as to when leeches, fever-mixture,
&c., are necessary. A universal rule, however, without a single exception, is always to rest
a joint well after it has been injured in any way whatever, to purge the patient, and to keep
him on low diet, without beer, unless he has been a very great drinker indeed, in which case
he may still be allowed to take a little; for if the stimulant that a person has been accustomed
to in excess be all taken away at once, he is very likely to have an attack of delirium tremens.
The quantity given should not, however, be much--say a pint, or, at the most, a pint and a
half a day. Rubbing the joint with opodeldoc, or the application of a blister to it, is of
great service in taking away the thickenings, which often remain after all heat, pain, and
redness have left an injured joint. Great care should be observed in not using a joint too
quickly after it has been injured. When the shoulder-joint is the one injured, the arm should
be bound tightly to the body by means of a linen or flannel roller, and the elbow raised; when
the elbow, it should be kept raised in the straight position, on a pillow; when the wrist,
it should be raised on the chest, and suspended in a sling; when the knee, it should be kept
in the straight position; and, lastly, when the ankle, it should be a little raised on a pillow.

2617. BRUISES, LACERATIONS, AND CUTS.--Wherever the bruise may be, or however swollen or discoloured
the skin may become, two or three applications of the extract of lead, kept to the part by
means of lint, will, in an hour or little more, remove all pain, swelling, and tenderness.
Simple or clean cuts only require the edges of the wound to be placed in their exact situation,
drawn close together, and secured there by one or two slips of adhesive plaster. When the wound,
however, is jagged, or the flesh or cuticle lacerated, the parts are to be laid as smooth and
regular as possible, and a piece of lint, wetted in the extract of lead, laid upon the wound,
and a piece of greased lint placed above it to prevent the dressing sticking; the whole covered
over to protect from injury, and the part dressed in the same manner once a day till the cure
is effected.

2618. BRUISES AND THEIR TREATMENT.--The best application for a bruise, be it large or small,
is moist warmth; therefore, a warm bread-and-water poultice in hot moist flannels should be
put on, as they supple the skin. If the bruise be very severe, and in the neighbourhood of
a joint, it will be well to apply ten or a dozen leeches over the whole bruised part, and afterwards
a poultice. But leeches should not be put on young children. If the bruised part be the knee
or the ankle, walking should not be attempted till it can be performed without pain. Inattention
to this point often lays the foundation for serious mischief in these joints, especially in
the case of scrofulous persons. In all conditions of bruises occurring in children, whether
swellings or abrasions, no remedy is so quick or certain of effecting a cure as the pure extract
of lead applied to the part.

Burns and Scalds.

2619. BURNS AND SCALDS being essentially the same in all particulars, and differing only in
the manner of their production, may be spoken of together. As a general rule, scalds are less
severe than burns, because the heat of water, by which scalds are mostly produced, is not,
even when it is boiling, so intense as that of flame; oil, however, and other liquids, whose
boiling-point is high, produce scalds of a very severe nature. Burns and scalds have been divided
into three classes. The first class comprises those where the burn is altogether superficial,
and merely reddens the skin; the second, where the injury is greater, and we get little bladders
containing a fluid (called serum) dotted over the affected part; in the third class we get,
in the case of burns, a charring, and in that of scalds, a softening or pulpiness, perhaps
a complete and immediate separation of the part. This may occur at once, or in the course of
a little time. The pain from the second kind of burns is much more severe than that in the
other two, although the danger, as a general rule, is less than it is in the third class. These
injuries are much more dangerous when they take place on the trunk than when they happen on
the arms or legs. The danger arises more from the extent of surface that is burnt than from
the depth to which the burn goes. This rule, of course, has certain exceptions; because a small
burn on the chest or belly penetrating deeply is more dangerous than a more extensive but superficial
one on the arm or leg. When a person's clothes are in flames, the best way of extinguishing
them is to wind a rug, or some thick material, tightly round the whole of the body.

2620. Treatment of the First Class of Burns and Scalds.--Of the part affected.--Cover it immediately
with a good coating of common flour, or cotton-wool with flour dredged well into it. The great
thing is to keep the affected surface of the skin from the contact of the air. The part will
shortly get well, and the skin may or may not peel off.--Constitutional Treatment. Three hours
after the pills give a black draught. If there are general symptoms of fever, such as hot skin,
thirst, headache, &c. &c., two tablespoonfuls of fever-mixture are to be given every four hours.

2621. Second Class. Local Treatment.--As the symptoms of these kinds of burns are more severe
than those of the first class, so the remedies appropriate to them are more powerful. Having,
as carefully as possible, removed the clothes from the burnt surface, and taking care not to
break the bladders, spread the following liniment (No. 1) on a piece of linen or lint--not
the fluffy side--and apply it to the part: the liniment should be equal parts of lime-water
and linseed-oil, well mixed. If the burn is on the trunk of the body, it is better to use a
warm linseed-meal poultice. After a few days dress the wound with Turner's cerate. If the burn
is at the bend of the elbow, place the arm in the straight position; for if it is bent, the
skin, when healed, will be contracted, and the arm, in all probability, always remain in the
same un natural position. This, indeed, applies to all parts of the body; therefore, always
place the part affected in the most stretched position possible.--Constitutional Treatment.
The same kind of treatment is to be used as for the first class, only it must be more powerful.
Stimulants are move often necessary, but must be given with great caution. If, as is often
the case, there is great irritability and restlessness, a dose of opium (paregoric, in doses
of from sixty to a hundred drops, according to age, is best) is of great service. The feverish
symptoms will require aperient medicines and the fever mixture. A drink made of about a tablespoonful
of cream of tartar and a little lemon-juice, in a quart of warm water, allowed to cool, is
a very nice one in these cases. The diet throughout should not be too low, especially if there
is much discharge from the wound. After a few days it is often necessary to give wine, ammonia,
and strong beef-tea. These should be had recourse to when the tongue gets dry and dark, and
the pulse weak and frequent. If there should be, after the lapse of a week or two, pain over
one particular part of the belly, a blister should be put on it, and a powder of mercury and
chalk-grey powder, and Dover's powder (two grains of the former and five of the latter) given
three times a day. Affections of the head and chest also frequently occur as a consequence
of these kinds of burns, but no one who is not a medical man can treat them.

2622. Third Class.--These are so severe as to make it impossible for a non-professional person
to be of much service in attending to them. When they occur, a surgeon should always be sent
for. Until he arrives, however, the following treatment should be adopted:--Place the patient
full-length on his back, and keep him warm. Apply fomentations of flannels wrung out of boiling
water and sprinkled with spirits of turpentine to the part, and give wine and sal-volatile
in such quantities as the prostration of strength requires; always bearing in mind the great
fact that you have to steer between two quicksands--death from present prostration and death
from future excitement, which will always be increased in proportion to the amount of stimulants
given. Give, therefore, only just as much as is absolutely necessary to keep life in the body.

2623. CONCUSSION OF BRAIN--STUNNING.--This may be caused by a blow or a fall.--Symptoms. Cold
skin; weak pulse; almost total insensibility; slow, weak breathing; pupil of eye sometimes
bigger, sometimes smaller, than natural; inability to move; unwillingness to answer when spoken
to. These symptoms come on directly after the accident.--Treatment. Place the patient quietly
on a warm bed, send for a surgeon, and do nothing else for the first four or six hours. After
this time the skin will become hot, the pulse full, and the patient feverish altogether. Give
a black draught three hours after the pill, and two tablespoonfuls of the above-mentioned fever-mixture
every four hours. Keep on low diet. Leeches are sometimes to be applied to the head. These
cases are often followed by violent inflammation of the brain. They can, therefore, only be
attended to properly throughout by a surgeon. The great thing for people to do in these cases
is--nothing; contenting themselves with putting the patient to bed, and waiting the arrival
of a surgeon.

2624. THE CHOLERA AND AUTUMNAL COMPLAINTS.--To oppose cholera, there seems no surer or better
means than cleanliness, sobriety, and judicious ventilation. Where there is dirt, that is the
place for cholera; where windows and doors are kept most jealously shut, there cholera will
find easiest entrance; and people who indulge in intemperate diet during the hot days of autumn
are actually courting death. To repeat it, cleanliness, sobriety, and free ventilation almost
always defy the pestilence; but, in case of attack, immediate recourse should be had to a physician.
The faculty say that a large number of lives have been lost, in many seasons, solely from delay
in seeking medical assistance. They even assert that, taken early, the cholera is by no means
a fatal disorder. The copious use of salt is recommended on very excellent authority. Other
autumnal complaints there are, of which diarrhoea is the worst example. They come on with pain,
flatulence, sickness, with or without vomiting, followed by loss of appetite, general lassitude,
and weakness. If attended to at the first appearance, they may soon be conquered; for which
purpose it is necessary to assist nature in throwing off the contents of the bowels, which
may be one by means of the following prescription:--Take of calomel 3 grains, rhubarb 8 grains;
mix and take it in a little honey or jelly, and repeat the dose three times, at the intervals
of four or five hours. The next purpose to be answered is the defence of the lining membrane
of the intestines from their acrid contents, which will be best effected by drinking copiously
of linseed tea, or of a drink made by pouring boiling water on quince-seeds, which are of a
very mucilaginous nature; or, what is still better, full draughts of whey. If the complaint
continue after these means have been employed, some astringent or binding medicine will be
required, as the subjoined:--Take of prepared chalk 2 drachms, cinnamon-water 7 oz., syrup
of poppies 1 oz.; mix, and take 3 tablespoonfuls every four hours. Should this fail to complete
the cure, 1/2 oz. of tincture of catechu, or of kino, may be added to it, and then it will
seldom fail; or a teaspoonful of the tincture of kino alone, with a little water, every three
hours, till the diarrhoea is checked. While any symptoms of derangement are present, particular
attention must be paid to the diet, which should be of a soothing, lubricating, and light nature,
as instanced in veal or chicken broth, which should contain but little salt. Rice, batter,
and bread puddings will be generally relished, and be eaten with advantage; but the stomach
is too much impaired to digest food of a more solid nature. Indeed, we should give that organ,
together with the bowels, as little trouble as possible, while they are so incapable of acting
in their accustomed manner. Much mischief is frequently produced by the absurd practice of
taking tincture of rhubarb, which is almost certain of aggravating that species of disorder
of which we have now treated; for it is a spirit as strong as brandy, and cannot fail of producing
harm upon a surface which is rendered tender by the formation and contact of vitiated bile.
But our last advice is, upon the first appearance of such symptoms as are above detailed, have
immediate recourse to a doctor, where possible.

2625. TO CURE A COLD.--Put a large teacupful of linseed, with 1/4 lb. of sun raisins and 2
oz. of stick liquorice, into 2 quarts of soft water, and let it simmer over a slow fire till
reduced to one quart; add to it 1/4 lb. of pounded sugar-candy, a tablespoonful of old rum,
and a tablespoonful of the best white-wine vinegar, or lemon-juice. The rum and vinegar should
be added as the decoction is taken; for, if they are put in at first, the whole soon becomes
flat and less efficacious. The dose is half a pint, made warm, on going to bed; and a little
may be taken whenever the cough is troublesome. The worst cold is generally cured by this remedy
in two or three days; and, if taken in time, is considered infallible.

2626. COLD ON THE CHEST.--A flannel dipped in boiling water, and sprinkled with turpentine,
laid on the chest as quickly as possible, will relieve the most severe cold or hoarseness.

2627. SUBSTANCES IN THE EYE.--To remove fine particles of gravel, lime, &c., the eye should
be syringed with lukewarm water till free from them. Be particular not to worry the eye, under
the impression that the substance is still there, which the enlargement of some of the minute
vessels makes the patient believe is actually the case.

2628. SORE EYES.--Incorporate thoroughly, in a glass mortar or vessel, one part of strong citron
ointment with three parts of spermaceti ointment. Use the mixture night and morning, by placing
a piece of the size of a pea in the corner of the eye affected, only to be used in cases of
chronic or long-standing inflammation of the organ, or its lids.

2629. LIME IN THE EYE.--Bathe the eye with a little weak vinegar-and-water, and carefully remove
any little piece of lime which may be seen, with a feather. If any lime has got entangled in
the eyelashes, carefully clear it away with a bit of soft linen soaked in vinegar-and-water.
Violent inflammation is sure to follow; a smart purge must be therefore administered, and in
all probability a blister must be applied on the temple, behind the ear, or nape of the neck.

2630. STYE IN THE EYE.--Styes are little abscesses which form between the roots of the eyelashes,
and are rarely larger than a small pea. The best way to manage them is to bathe them frequently
with warm water, or in warm poppy-water, if very painful. When they have burst, use an ointment
composed of one part of citron ointment and four of spermaceti, well rubbed together, and smear
along the edge of the eyelid. Give a grain or two of calomel with 5 or 8 grains of rhubarb,
according to the age of the child, twice a week. The old-fashioned and apparently absurd practice
of rubbing the stye with a ring, is as good and speedy a cure as that by any process of medicinal
application; though the number of times it is rubbed, or the quality of the ring and direction
of the strokes, has nothing to do with its success. The pressure and the friction excite the
vessels of the part, and cause an absorption of the effused matter under the eyelash. The edge
of the nail will answer as well as a ring.

2631. INFLAMMATION OF THE EYELIDS.--The following ointment has been found very beneficial in
inflammations of the eyeball and edges of the eyelids:--Take of prepared calomel, 1 scruple;
spermaceti ointment, 1/2 oz. Mix them well together in a glass mortar; apply a small quantity
to each corner of the eye every night and morning, and also to the edges of the lids, if they
are affected. If this should not eventually remove the inflammation, elder-flower water may
be applied three or four times a day, by means of an eye-cup. He kept a full diary while he
was thus upon his journeys, but it is feared that these notes have
been destroyed.

If their value were in any respect such as we have reason to expect from the man's character, this
would be a loss not easy to exaggerate. Howard, the celebrated
philanthropist (says a writer), used to fast one day in every week. Napoleon, when he felt
his system unstrung, suspended his wonted repast, and took his exercise on horseback.

Fits.

2633. Fits come on so suddenly, often without even the slightest warning, and may prove fatal
so quickly, that all people should be acquainted at least with their leading symptoms and treatment,
as a few moments, more or less, will often decide the question between life and death. The
treatment, in very many cases at least, to be of the slightest use, should be immediate, as
a person in a fit (of apoplexy for instance) may die while a surgeon is being fetched from
only the next street. We shall give, as far as the fact of our editing a work for non-professional
readers will permit, the peculiar and distinctive symptoms of all kind of fits, and the immediate
treatment to be adopted in each case.

2634. APOPLEXY.--These fits may be divided into two kinds--the strong and the weak.

2635. 1. The strong kind.--These cases mostly occur in stout, strong, short-necked, bloated-faced
people, who are in the habit of living well.--Symptoms. The patient may or may not have had
headache, sparks before his eyes, with confusion of ideas and giddiness, for a day or two before
the attack. When it takes place, he falls down insensible; the body becomes paralyzed, generally
more so on one side than the other; the face and head are hot, and the blood-vessels about
them swollen; the pupils of the eyes are larger than natural, and the eyes themselves are fixed;
the mouth is mostly drawn down at one corner; the breathing is like loud snoring; the pulse
full and hard.--Treatment. Place the patient immediately in bed, with his head well raised;
take off everything that he has round his neck, and bleed freely and at once from the arm.
If you have not got a lancet, use a penknife or anything suitable that may be at hand. Apply
warm mustard poultices to the soles of the feet and the insides of the thighs and legs; put
two drops of castor oil, mixed up with eight grains of calomel, on the top of the tongue, as
far back as possible; a most important part of the treatment being to open the bowels as quickly
and freely as possible. The patient cannot swallow; but these medicines, especially the oil,
will be absorbed into the stomach altogether independent of any voluntary action. If possible,
throw up a warm turpentine clyster (two tablespoonfuls of oil of turpentine in a pint of warm
gruel), or, if this cannot be obtained, one composed of about a quart of warm salt-and-water
and soap. Cut off the hair, and apply rags dipped in weak vinegar-and-water, or weak gin-and-water,
or even simple cold water, to the head. If the blood-vessels about the head and neck are much
swollen, put from eight to ten leeches on the temple opposite to the paralyzed side of the
body. Always send for a surgeon immediately, and act according to the above rules, doing more
or less, according to the means at hand, and the length of time that must necessarily elapse
until he arrives. A pint, or even a quart of blood in a very strong person, may be taken away.
When the patient is able to swallow, give him the No. 1 pills, and the No. 1 mixture directly.
Keep the patient's head well raised, and cool as above. Give very low diet indeed: gruel, arrowroot,
and the like. When a person is recovering, he should have blisters applied to the nape of the
neck, his bowels should be kept well open, light diet given, and fatigue, worry, and excess
of all kinds avoided.

2636. 2. The weak kind.--Symptoms. These attacks are more frequently preceded by warning symptoms
than the first kind. The face is pale, the pulse weak, and the body, especially the hands and
legs, cold. After a little while, these symptoms sometimes alter to those of the first class
in a mild degree.--Treatment. At first, if the pulse is very feeble indeed, a little brandy-and-water
or sal-volatile must be given. Mustard poultices are to be put, as before, to the soles of
the foot and the insides of the thighs and legs. Warm bricks, or bottles filled with warm water,
are also to be placed under the armpits. When the strength has returned, the body become warmer,
and the pulse fuller and harder, the head should be shaved, and wet rags applied to it, as
before described. Leeches should be put, as before, to the temple opposite the side paralyzed;
and the bowels should be opened as freely and as quickly as possible. Bleeding from the arm
is often necessary in these cases, but a non-professional person should never have recourse
to it. Blisters may be applied to the nape of the neck at once. The diet in those cases should
not be so low as in the former--indeed, it is often necessary, in a day or so after one of
these attacks, to give wine, strong beef-tea, &c., according to the condition of the patient's
strength.

2637. Distinctions between Apoplexy and Epilepsy.--1. Apoplexy mostly happens in people over
thirty, whereas epilepsy generally occurs under that ago; at any rate for the first time. A
person who has epileptic fits over thirty, has generally suffered from them for some years.
2. Again, in apoplexy, the body is paralyzed; and, therefore, has not the convulsions which
take place in epilepsy. 3. The peculiar snoring will also distinguish apoplexy from epilepsy.

2638. Distinctions between Apoplexy and Drunkeness.--1. The known habits of the person. 2.
The fact of a person who was perfectly sober and sensible a little time before, being found
in a state of insensibility. 3. The absence, in apoplexy, of the smell of drink on applying
the nose to the mouth. 4. A person in a fit of apoplexy cannot be roused at all; in drunkenness
he mostly can, to a certain extent.

2639. Distinction between Apoplexy and Hysteria.--Hysterics mostly happen in young, nervous,
unmarried women; and are attended with convulsions, sobbing, laughter, throwing about of the
body, &c. &c.

2640. Distinction between Apoplexy and Poisoning by Opium.--It is exceedingly difficult to
distinguish between these two cases. In poisoning by opium, however, we find the particular
smell of the drug in the patient's breath. We should also, in forming our opinion, take into
consideration the person's previous conduct--whether he has been low and desponding for some
time before, or has ever talked about committing suicide.

2641. EPILEPSY.--Falling Sickness.--Those fits mostly happen, at any rate for the first time,
to young people, and are more common in boys than girls. They are produced by numerous causes.--Symptoms.
The fit may be preceded by pains in the head, palpitations, &c. &c.; but it mostly happens
that the person falls down insensible suddenly, and without any warning whatever. The eyes
are distorted, so that only their whites can be seen; there is mostly foaming from the mouth;
the fingers are clinched; and the body, especially on one side, is much agitated; the tongue
is often thrust out of the mouth. When the fit goes off, the patient feels drowsy and faint,
and often sleeps soundly for some time.--Treatment. During the fit, keep the patient flat on
his back, with his head slightly raised, and prevent him from doing any harm to himself; dash
cold water into his face, and apply smelling-salts to his nose; loosen his shirt collar, &c.;
hold a piece of wood about as thick as a finger--the handle of a tooth-brush or knife will
do as well--between the two rows of teeth, at the back part of the mouth. This will prevent
the tongue from being injured. A teaspoonful of common salt thrust into the patient's mouth,
during the fit, is of much service. The after-treatment of these fits is various, and depends
entirely upon their causes. A good general rule, however, is always to keep the bowels well
open, and the patient quiet, and free from fatigue, worry, and excess of all kinds.

2642. Fainting Fits are sometimes very dangerous, and at others perfectly harmless; the question
of danger depending altogether upon the causes which have produced them, and which are exceedingly
various. For instance, fainting produced by disease of the heart is a very serious symptom
indeed; whereas, that arising from some slight cause, such as the sight of blood, &c., need
cause no alarm whatever. The symptoms of simple fainting are so well known that it would be
quite superfluous to enumerate them here. The treatment consists in laying the patient at full
length upon his back, with his head upon a level with the rest of his body, loosening everything
about the neck, dashing cold water into the face, and sprinkling vinegar and water about the
mouth; applying smelling-salts to the nose; and, when the patient is able to swallow, in giving
a little warm brandy-and-water, or about 20 drops of sal-volatile in water. 

The English were the English indeed, but the French were only the Armagnacs, whom, with Joan of
Arc at their head, they had beaten back from under their ramparts not two years before. Such
public sentiment as they had centred about their dear Duke of Burgundy, and the dear Duke had
no more urgent business than to keep out of their neighbourhood. . . . At least, and whether he
liked it or not, our disreputable troubadour was tubbed and swaddled
as a subject of the English crown. The fits themselves
are mostly preceded by great depression of spirits, shedding of tears, sickness, palpitation
of the heart, &c. A pain, as if a nail were being driven in, is also often felt at one particular
part of the head. In almost all cases, when a fit is coming on, pain is felt on the left side.
This pain rises gradually until it reaches the throat, and then gives the patient a sensation
as if she had a pellet there, which prevents her from breathing properly, and, in fact, seems
to threaten actual suffocation. The patient now generally becomes insensible, and faints; the
body is thrown about in all directions, froth issues from the mouth, incoherent expressions
are uttered, and fits of laughter, crying, or screaming, take place. When the fit is going
off, the patient mostly cries bitterly, sometimes knowing all, and at others nothing, of what
has taken place, and feeling general soreness all over the body. Treatment during the fit.
Place the body in the same position as for simple fainting, and treat, in other respects, as
directed in the article on Epilepsy. Always well loosen the patient's stays; and, when she
is recovering, and able to swallow, give 20 drops of sal volatile in a little water. The after-treatment
of these cases is very various. If the patient is of a strong constitution, she should live
on plain diet, take plenty of exercise, and take occasional doses of castor oil, or an aperient
mixture, such as that described as "No. 1," in previous numbers. If, as is mostly the case,
the patient is weak and delicate, she will require a different mode of treatment altogether.
Good nourishing diet, gentle exercise, cold baths, occasionally a dose of No. 3 myrrh and aloes
pills at night, and a dose of compound iron pills twice a day. [As to the myrrh and aloes pills
(No. 3), 10 grains made into two pills are a dose for a full-grown person.

2644. LIVER COMPLAINT AND SPASMS.--A very obliging correspondent recommends the following,
from personal experience:--Take 4 oz. of dried dandelion root, 1 oz. of the best ginger, 1/4
oz. of Columba root; braise and boil all together in 3 pints of water till it is reduced to
a quart: strain, and take a wine-glassful every four hours. Our correspondent says it is a
"safe and simple medicine for both liver complaint and spasms."

2645. LUMBAGO.--A "new and successful mode" of treating lumbago, advocated by Dr. Day, is a
form of counter-irritation, said to have been introduced into this country by the late Sir
Anthony Carlisle, and which consists in the instantaneous application of a flat iron button,
gently heated in a spirit-lamp, to the skin. Dr. Corrigan published, about three years ago,
an account of some cases very successfully treated by nearly similar means. Dr. Corrigan's
plan was, however, to touch the surface of the part affected, at intervals of half an inch,
as lightly and rapidly as possible. Dr. Day has found greater advantages to result from drawing
the flat surface of the heated button lightly over the affected part, so as to act on a greater
extent of surface. The doctor speaks so enthusiastically of the benefit to be derived from
this practice, that it is evidently highly deserving attention.

2646. PALPITATION OF THE HEART.--Where palpitation occurs as symptomatic of indigestion, the
treatment must be directed to remedy that disorder; when it is consequent on a plethoric state,
purgatives will be effectual. In this case the patient should abstain from every kind of diet
likely to produce a plethoric condition of body. Animal food and fermented liquor must be particularly
avoided. Too much indulgence in sleep will also prove injurious. When the attacks arise from
nervous irritability, the excitement must be allayed by change of air and a tonic diet. Should
the palpitation originate from organic derangement, it must be, of course, beyond domestic
management. Luxurious living, indolence, and tight-lacing often produce this affection: such
cases are to be conquered with a little resolution.

2648. The symptoms of poisoning may be known for the most part from those of some diseases,
which they are very like, from the fact of their coming on immediately after eating or drinking
something; whereas those of disease come on, in most cases at least, by degrees, and with warnings.
The back part of the throat should be well tickled with a feather, or two of the fingers thrust
down it, to induce vomiting. The cases where vomiting must not be used are those where the
skin has been taken off, and the parts touched irritated and inflamed by the poison taken,
and where the action of vomiting would increase the evil. Full instructions are given in the
article on each particular poison as to where emetics are or are not to be given. The best
and safest way of emptying the stomach is by means of the stomach-pump, as in certain cases
the action of vomiting is likely to increase the danger arising from the swollen and congested
condition of the blood-vessels of the head, which often takes place. In the hands, however,
of any one else than a surgeon, it would be not only useless, but harmful, as a great deal
of dexterity, caution, and experience are required to use it properly. After having made these
brief introductory remarks, we shall now proceed to particulars.

2649. Sulphuric Acid, or Oil of Vitriol (a clear, colourless liquid, of an oily appearance).--Symptoms
in those who have swallowed it. When much is taken, these come on immediately. There is great
burning pain, extending from the mouth to the stomach; vomiting of a liquid of a dark coffee-colour,
often mixed with shreds of flesh and streaks of blood; the skin inside the mouth is taken off;
and the exposed surface is at first white, and after a time becomes brownish. There are sometimes
spots of a brown colour round the lips and on the neck, caused by drops of the acid falling
on these parts. There is great difficulty of breathing, owing to the swelling at the back part
of the mouth. After a time there is much depression of strength, with a quick, weak pulse,
and cold, clammy skin. The face is pale, and has a very anxious look. When the acid swallowed
has been greatly diluted in water, the same kind of symptoms occur, only in a milder degree.--Treatment.
Give a mixture of magnesia in milk-and-water, or, if this cannot be obtained, of finely powdered
chalk, or whiting, or even of the plaster torn down from the walls or ceiling, in milk-and-water.
The mixture should be nearly as thick as cream, and plenty of it given. As well as this, simple
gruel, milk, or thick flour-and-water, are very useful, and should be given in large quantities.
Violent inflammation of the parts touched by the acid is most likely to take place in the coarse
of a little time, and can only be properly attended to by a surgeon; but if one cannot be obtained,
leeches, the fever-mixtures (the recipe for which appears repeatedly in previous paragraphs),
thick drinks, such as barley-water, gruel, arrowroot, &c., must be had recourse to, according
to the symptoms of each particular case and the means at hand. The inflamed condition of the
back part of the mouth requires particular attention. When the breathing is very laboured and
difficult in consequence, from fifteen to twenty leeches are to be immediately applied to the
outside of the throat, and when they drop off, warm poppy fomentations constantly kept to the
part. When the pain over the stomach is very great, the same local treatment is necessary;
but if it is only slight, a good mustard poultice will be sufficient without the leeches. In
all these cases, two tablespoonfuls of the fever-mixture should be given every four hours,
and only gruel or arrowroot allowed to be eaten for some days.

2650. Nitric Acid, commonly known as Aqua Fortis, or Red Spirit of Nitre (a straw-coloured
fluid, of the consistence of water, and which gives off dense white fumes on exposure to the
air).--Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it. Much the same as in the case of sulphuric
acid. In this case, however, the surface touched by the acid becomes yellowish. The tongue
is mostly much swollen.--Treatment. The same as for sulphuric acid.

2651. Muriatic Acid, Spirit of Salt (a thin yellow fluid, emitting dense white fumes on exposure
to the air).--This is not often taken as a poison. The symptoms and treatment are much the
same as those of nitric acid.

N.B.--In no case of poisoning by these three acids should emetics ever be given.

2652. Oxalic Acid, commonly called Salt of Lemons.--This poison may be taken by mistake for
Epsom salts, which it is a good deal like. It may be distinguished from them by its very acid
taste and its shape, which is that of needle-formed crystals, each of which, if put into a
drop of ink, will turn it to a reddish brown, whereas Epsom salts will not change its colour
at all. When a large dose of this poison has been taken, death takes place very quickly indeed.--Symptoms
produced in those who have swallowed it. A hot, burning, acid taste is felt in the act of swallowing,
and vomiting of a greenish-brown fluid is produced, sooner or later, according to the quantity
and strength of the poison taken. There is great tenderness felt over the stomach, followed
by clammy perspirations and convulsions; the legs are often drawn up, and there is generally
stupor, from which the patient, however, can easily be roused, and always great prostration
of strength. The pulse is small and weak, and the breathing faint.--Treatment. Chalk or magnesia,
made into a cream with water, should be given in large quantities, and afterwards the emetic
draught above prescribed, or some mustard-and-water, if the draught cannot be got. The back
part of the throat to be tickled with a feather, to induce vomiting. Arrowroot, gruel, and
the like drinks, are to be taken. When the prostration of strength is very great and the body
cold, warmth is to be applied to it, and a little brandy-and-water, or sal-volatile and water,
given.

2653. Prussic Acid (a thin, transparent, and colourless liquid, with a peculiar smell, which
greatly resembles that of bitter almonds).--Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it.
These come on immediately after the poison has been taken, and may be produced by merely smelling
it. The patient becomes perfectly insensible, and falls down in convulsions--his eyes are fixed
and staring, the pupils being bigger than natural, the skin is cold and clammy, the pulse scarcely
perceptible, and the breathing slow and gasping.--Treatment. Very little can be done in these
cases, as death takes place so quickly after the poison has been swallowed, when it takes place
at all. The best treatment--which should always be adopted in all cases, even though the patient
appears quite dead-is to dash quantities of cold water on the back, from the top of the neck
downwards. Placing the patient under a pump, and pumping on him, is the best way of doing this.
Smelling-salts are also to be applied to the nose, and the chest well rubbed with a camphor
liniment.

2654. ALKALIS: Potash, Soda, and Ammonia, or common Smelling-Salts, with their principal preparations--Pearlash,
Soap Lees, Liquor Potassae, Nitre, Sal Prunella, Hartshorn, and Sal--Volatile.--Alkalis are
seldom taken or given with the view of destroying life. They may, however, be swallowed by
mistake.--Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed them. There is at first a burning,
acrid taste in, and a sensation of tightness round, the throat, like that of strangling; the
skin touched is destroyed; retching mostly followed by actual vomiting, then sets in; the vomited
matters often containing blood of a dark brown colour, with little shreds of flesh here and
there, and always changing vegetable blue colours green. There is now great tenderness over
the whole of the belly. After a little while, great weakness, with cold, clammy sweats, a quick
weak pulse, and purging of bloody matters, takes place. The brain, too, mostly becomes affected.--Treatment.
Give two tablespoonfuls of vinegar or lemon-juice in a glassful of water every few minutes
until the burning sensation is relieved. Any kind of oil or milk may also be given, and will
form soap when mixed with the poison in the stomach. Barley-water, gruel, arrowroot, linseed-tea,
&c., are also very useful, and should be taken constantly, and in large quantities. If inflammation
should take place, it is to be treated by applying leeches and warm poppy fomentations to the
part where the pain is most felt, and giving two tablespoonfuls of the fever mixture every
four hours. The diet in all these cases should only consist of arrowroot or gruel for the first
few days, and then of weak broth or beef-tea for some time after.

2655. When very strong fumes of smelling-salts have in any way been inhaled, there is great
difficulty of breathing, and alarming pain in the mouth and nostrils. In this case let the
patient inhale the steam of warm vinegar, and treat the feverish symptoms as before.

2656. Arsenic.--Mostly seen under the form of white arsenic, or fly-powder, and yellow arsenic,
or king's yellow.--Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it. These vary very much,
according to the form and dose in which the poison has been taken. There is faintness, depression,
and sickness, with an intense burning pain in the region of the stomach, which gets worse and
worse, and is increased by pressure. There is also vomiting of dark brown matter, sometimes
mixed with blood; and mostly great thirst, with a feeling of tightness round, and of burning
in, the throat. Purging also takes place, the matters brought away being mixed with blood.
The pulse is small and irregular, and the skin sometimes cold and clammy, and at others hot.
The breathing is painful. Convulsions and spasms often occur.--Treatment. Give a couple of
teaspoonfuls of mustard in a glass of water, to bring on or assist vomiting, and also use the
other means elsewhere recommended for the purpose. A solution, half of lime-water and half
of linseed-oil, well mixed, may be given, as well as plenty of arrowroot, gruel, or linseed-tea.
Simple milk is also useful. A little castor-oil should be given, to cleanse the intestines
of all the poison, and the after-symptoms treated on general principles.

2657. Corrosive Sublimate.--Mostly seen in the form of little heavy crystalline masses, which
melt in water, and have a metallic taste. It is sometimes seen in powder. This is a most powerful
poison.--Symptoms. These mostly come on immediately after the poison has been taken. There
is a coppery taste experienced in the act of swallowing, with a burning heat, extending from
the top of the throat down to the stomach; and also a feeling of great tightness round the
throat. In a few minutes great pain is felt over the region of the stomach, and frequent vomiting
of long, stringy white masses, mixed with blood, takes place. There is also mostly great purging.
The countenance is generally pale and anxious; the pulse always small and frequent; the skin
cold and clammy, and the breathing difficult. Convulsions and insensibility often occur, and
are very bad symptoms indeed. Thoreau is dry, priggish, and selfish. It is profit he is after
in these intimacies; moral profit, certainly, but still profit to himself. If you will be the
sort of friend I want, he remarks naively, "my education cannot dispense with your society."
His education! as though a friend were a dictionary. And with all this, not one word about pleasure,
or laughter, or kisses, or any quality of flesh and blood. It was not inappropriate, surely, that
he had such close relations with the fish. We can understand the friend already quoted, when he
cried: "As for taking his arm, I would as soon think of taking the arm of an elm-tree!"

As a matter of fact he experienced but a broken enjoyment in his intimacies.
 The diet should also be the same. If the patient
recovers, great soreness of the gums is almost certain to take place. The simplest, and at
the same time one of the best modes of treatment, is to wash them well three or four times
a day with brandy-and-water.

2658. Calomel.--A heavy white powder, without taste, and insoluble in water. It has been occasionally
known to destroy life.--Symptoms. Much the same as in the case of corrosive sublimate.--Treatment.
The same as for corrosive sublimate. If the gums are sore, wash them, as recommended in the
case of corrosive sublimate, with brandy-and-water three or four times a day, and keep the
patient on fluids, such as arrowroot, gruel, broth, or beef-tea, according to the other symptoms.
Eating hard substances would make the gums more sore and tender.
