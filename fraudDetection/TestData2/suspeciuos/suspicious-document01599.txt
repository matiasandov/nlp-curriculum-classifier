In the middle of the village we halted before a small, neat house, which I was told was General
Blood's headquarters. The General himself met us on the threshold; a well-proportioned, kindly-looking
man about 50 years of age, evidently a genuine soldier and an Irishman, as I soon detected
by his speech. He received us very courteously, and as I had little time at my disposal, we
at once entered into our discussion. It would serve little purpose to set down all the details
of our interview, especially as nothing final was decided, since whatever the General said
was subject to Lord Kitchener's approval, whilst I myself had to submit everything to my Commandant-General.
General Blood promised, however, to stop sending out the women with their proclamations, and
also the officers on similar missions, and the Red Cross question was also satisfactorily settled.
The kaffir question, however, was left unsettled, although General Blood promised to warn the
kaffir tribes round Lydenburg not to interfere in the War and not to leave the immediate vicinity
of their kraals. (Only the night before two burghers named Swart had been murdered at Doornkoek
by some kaffirs, who pretended to have done this by order of the English). The interview lasted
about an hour, and besides us two, Colonel Curran and my secretary, Lieutenant Malan, were
present. General Blood and his staff conducted us as far as Potloodspruit, where we took leave.
The white flag was replaced by the rifle, and we returned to our respective duties.

CHAPTER XLIII.

MRS. BOTHA'S BABY AND THE "TOMMY."

In September, 1901, after having organized the commandos north of Lydenburg, I went back with
my suite to join my burghers at Olifant's River, which I reached at the beginning of September.
The enemy had left General Muller alone after the affair with the Hussars. Reports were coming
in from across the railway informing us that much fighting was going on in the Orange Free
State and Cape Colony, and that the burghers were holding their own. This was very satisfactory
news to us, especially as we had not received any tidings for over a month. I again sent in
a report to our Commandant-General relating my adventures.

We had much difficulty in getting the necessary food for the commandos, the enemy having repeatedly
crossed the country between Roos Senekal, Middelburg, and Rhenosterkop, destroying and ravaging
everything. I therefore resolved to split up my forces, the corps known by the name of the
"Rond Commando" taking one portion through the enemy's lines to Pilgrimsrust, North of Lydenburg,
where food was still abundant. Fighting-General Muller was left behind with the Boksburg Police
and the Middelburg Commando, the Johannesburg corps going with me to Pilgrim's Rest, where
I had my temporary headquarters. We had plenty of mealies in this district and also enough
cattle to kill, so that we could manage to subsist on these provisions. We had long since dispensed
with tents, but the rains in the mountain regions of Pilgrim's Rest and the Sabi had compelled
us to find the burghers shelter. At the alluvial diggings at Pilgrim's Rest we found a great
quantity of galvanized iron plates and deals, which, when cut into smaller pieces, could be
used for building. We found a convenient spot in the mountains between Pilgrim's Rest and Kruger's
Post, where some hundreds of iron or zinc huts were soon erected, affording excellent cover
for the burghers.

Patrols were continually sent out round Lydenburg, and whenever possible we attacked the enemy,
keeping him well occupied. We succeeded in getting near his outposts from time to time and
occasionally capturing some cattle. This seemed to be very galling to the English, and towards
the end of September we found they were receiving reinforcements at Lydenburg. This had soon
become a considerable force, in fact in November they crossed the Spekboom River in great numbers,
and at Kruger's Post came upon our outposts, when there was some fighting. The enemy did not
go any further that night. The following day we had to leave these positions and the other
side took them and camped there. Next day they moved along Ohrigstad River with a strong mounted
force and a good many empty waggons, evidently to collect the women-folk in that place. I had
to proceed by a circuitous route in order to get ahead of the enemy. The road led across a
steep mountain and through thickly grown kloofs, which prevented us from reaching the enemy
until they had burnt all the houses, destroyed the seed plants, and loaded the families on
their carts, after which they withdrew to the camp at Kruger's Post. We at once charged the
enemy's rearguard, and a heavy fight followed, which, however, was of short duration. The English
fled, leaving some dead and wounded behind, also some dozens of helmets and "putties" which
had got entangled in the trees. We also captured a waggon loaded with provisions and things
that had been looted, such as women's clothes and rugs, a case of Lee-Metford ammunition and
a number of uniforms. Some days after the enemy tried to get through to Pilgrim's Rest, but
had to retire before our rifle fire. They managed, however, to get to Roosenkrans, where a
fight of only some minutes ensued, when they retired to Kruger's Post. They only stopped there
for a few days, marching back to Lydenburg at night time just when we had carefully planned
a night attack. We destroyed the Spekboom River bridge shortly after, thus preventing the enemy's
return from Lydenburg to Kruger's Post in a single night. Although there is a drift through
the river it cannot be passed in the dark without danger, especially with guns and carts, without
which no English column will march. Every fortnight I personally proceeded with my adjutants
through the enemy's lines near Lydenburg to see how the commando in the South were getting
on and to arrange matters.

The month of November, 1901, passed without any remarkable incidents. We organized some expeditions
to the Delagoa Bay Railway, but without much success, and during one of these the burghers
succeeded in laying a mine near Hector's Spruit Station during the night. They were lying in
ambush next day waiting for a train to come along when a "Tommy" went down the line and noticed
some traces of the ground having been disturbed which roused his suspicions. He saw the mine
and took the dynamite out. Two burghers who were lying in the long grass shouted "Hands up."
Tommy threw his rifle down and with his hands up in the air ran up to the burghers saying,
before they could speak, "I say, did you hear the news that Mrs. Botha gave birth to a son
in Europe?"

They could not help laughing, and the "Tommy," looking very innocent, answered:

"I am not telling you a fib."

One of the burghers coaxed him by telling him they did not doubt his word, only the family
news had come so prematurely.

"Well," returned "Tommy," "Oi thought you blokes would be interested in your boss's family,
that's why I spoke."

The courteous soldier was sent back with instructions to get some better clothes, for those
he had on his back were all torn and dirty and they were not worth taking.

The expedition was now a failure, for the enemy had been warned and the sentries were doubled
along the line.

In December, 1901, we tried an attack on a British convoy between Lydenburg and Machadodorp.
I took a mounted commando and arrived at Schvemones Cleft after four days' marching through
the Sabinek via Cham Sham, an arduous task, as we had to go over the mountains and through
some rivers. Some of my officers went out scouting in order to find the best place for an attack
on the convoy. The enemy's blockhouses were found to be so close together on the road along
which the convoy had to pass as to make it very difficult to get at it. But having come such
a long way nobody liked to go back without having at least made an effort. We therefore marched
during the night and found some hiding places along the road where we waited, ready to charge
anything coming along. At dawn next day I found the locality to be very little suitable for
the purpose we had in view, but if we were now to move the enemy would notice our presence
from the blockhouses. We would, therefore, either have to lie low till dusk or make an attack
after all. We had already captured several of the enemy's spies, whom we kept prisoners so
as not to be betrayed. Towards the afternoon the convoy came by and we charged on horseback.
The English, who must have seen us coming, were ready to receive our charge and poured a heavy
fire into us from ditches and trenches and holes in the ground. We managed to dislodge the
enemy's outerflanks and to make several prisoners, but could not reach the carts on account
of the heavy fire from a regiment of infantry escorting the waggons. I thought the taking of
the convoy would cost more lives than it was worth, and gave orders to cease firing. We lost
my brave adjutant, Jaapie Oliver, while Captain Giel Joubert and another burgher were wounded.
On the other side Captain Merriman and ten men were wounded. I do not know how many killed he had.

We went back to Schoeman's Kloof the same day, where we buried our comrades and attended to
the wounded. The blockhouses and garrisons along the convoy road were now fortified with entrenchments
and guns, and we had to abandon our plan of further attacks. It was raining fast all the time
we were out on this expedition, which caused us serious discomfort. We had very few waterproofs,
and, all the houses in the district having been burnt down, there was no shelter for man or
beast. We slowly retired on Pilgrim's Rest, having to cross several swollen rivers.

On our arrival at Sabi I received the sad tidings that four burghers named Stoltz had been
cruelly murdered by kaffirs at Witriver. Commandant Du Toit had gone there with a patrol and
found the bodies in a shocking condition, plundered and cut to pieces with assegais, and, according
to the trace, the murderers had come from Nelspruit Station.

Another report came from General Muller at Steenkampsberg. He informed me that he had stormed
a camp during the night of the 16th December, but had been forced to retire after a fierce
fight, losing 25 killed and wounded, amongst whom was the valiant Field-Cornet J. J. Kriege.
The enemy's losses were also very heavy, being 31 killed and wounded, including Major Hudson.

It should not be imagined that we had to put up with very primitive arrangements in every respect.
Where we were now stationed, to the north of Lydenburg, we even had telephonic communication
between Spitskop and Doornhoek, with call-offices at Sabi and Pilgrim's Rest. The latter place
is in the centre of the diggers' population here, and a moderate-sized village. There are a
few hundred houses in it, and it is situated 30 miles north-east of Lydenburg. Here are the
oldest goldfields known in South Africa, having been discovered in 1876. This village had so
far been permanently in our possession. General Buller had been there with his force in 1900
but had not caused any damage, and the enemy had not returned since. The mines and big stamp-batteries
were protected by us and kept in order by neutral persons under the management of Mr. Alex.
Marshall. We established a hospital there under the supervision of Dr. A. Neethling. About
forty families were still in residence and there was enough food, although it was only simple
fare and not of great variety. Yet people seemed to be very happy and contented so long as
they were allowed to live among their own people.

CHAPTER XLIV.

THE LAST CHRISTMAS OF THE WAR.

December, 1901, passed without any important incident. We only had a few insignificant outpost
skirmishes with the British garrison at Witklip to the south of Lydenburg. Both belligerents
in this district attempted to annoy each other as much as possible by blowing up each other's
mills and storehouses. Two of the more adventurous spirits amongst my scouts, by name Jordaan
and Mellema, succeeded in blowing up a mill in the Lydenburg district used by the British for
grinding corn, and the enemy very soon retaliated by blowing up one of our mills at Pilgrim's
Rest. As the Germans say, "Alle gute dingen sind drei." Several such experiences and the occasional
capture of small droves of British cattle were all the incidents worth mentioning. It was in
this comparatively quiet manner that the third year of our campaign came to a termination.
The War was still raging and our lot was hard, but we did not murmur. We decided rather to
extract as much pleasure and amusement out of the Christmas festivities as the extraordinary
circumstances in which we found ourselves rendered possible.

The British for the time being desisted from troubling us, and our stock and horses being in
excellent condition, we arranged to hold a sort of gymkhana on Christmas Day. In the sportive
festivities of the day many interesting events took place. Perhaps the most noteworthy of these
were a mule race, for which nine competitors entered, and a ladies' race, in which six fair
pedestrians took part. The spectacle of nine burly, bearded Boers urging their asinine steeds
to top speed by shout and spur provoked quite as much honest laughter as any theatrical farce
ever excited. We on the grand stand were but a shaggy and shabby audience, but we were in excellent
spirits and cheered with tremendous gusto the enterprising jockey who won this remarkable "Derby."
Shabby as we were, we subscribed £115 in prizes. After the sports I have just described the
company retired to a little tin church at Pilgrim's Rest, and there made merry by singing hymns
and songs round a little Christmas tree.

Later in the evening a magic-lantern, which we had captured from the British, was brought into
play, and with this we regaled 90 of our juvenile guests. The building was crowded and the
utmost enthusiasm reigned. The ceremony was opened by the singing of hymns and the making of
speeches, a harmonium adding largely to the enjoyment of the evening. I felt somewhat nervous
when called upon to address the gathering, for the children were accompanied by their mothers,
and these stared at me with expectant eyes as if they would say, "See, the General is about
to speak; his words are sure to be full of wisdom." It was in vain that the minority in the House
found fault with the Speaker for allowing the queen’s prerogative to be called in question. The majority
had the nation at its back; and finding this to be the case Elizabeth, who knew when to give
way, yielded with grace. When a deputation of the Commons waited upon her and expressed the
gratitude of the House at her concession, she replied in words full of kindness and dignity, thanking
the Commons for having pointed out her error, and calling God to
witness that she had never cherished anything but what tended to her
people’s good, "Though you have had," she assured them, "and may have,
many princes more mighty and wise sitting in this seat, yet you never
had, or ever shall have, any that will be more careful and loving."

(M840)

These were the last words addressed by the queen to her people, and their truth was borne out by
her conduct throughout her long reign. Under her the country had become united and prosperous. By
the citizens of London she was especially beloved, for they always found in her a supporter of
trade and commerce. If the Hanseatic towns behaved unfairly to the merchant adventurers Elizabeth
promptly retaliated upon the merchants of the Steelyard. She had threatened to close the Steelyard
altogether in 1578, when English merchants were ordered to quit Hamburg, and twenty years later
(1598), when fresh difficulties had arisen, the threat was carried
out.(1757)

The queen rarely left London to make one of her many gorgeous
progresses from country house to country house or returned home without
some notice being sent to the city to allow of its inhabitants taking
"the comfort of behoulding her royall persone."(1758) Her love of
personal admiration and of handsome men continued to the last.

As late as November, 1602, she commanded the mayor and aldermen and a number of the "best and
most grave" citizens to attend her from Chelsea to Westminster, and the mayor, knowing her weakness,
ordered the livery companies to choose the "most grave and comlie" members to join the procession.(1759)
In the early morning of the 24th March, 1603, she died at Richmond,
to the sincere regret of the citizens no less than of the nation at
large.

Just about this time rumours of various kinds were spread abroad. From several sources we heard
daily that the War was about to end, that the English had evacuated the country because their
funds were exhausted, that Russia and France had intervened, and that Lord Kitchener had been
captured by De Wet and liberated on condition that he and his troops left South Africa immediately.
It was even said that General Botha had received an invitation from the British Government
to come and arrange a Peace on "independence" lines.

Nobody will doubt that we on the veldt were desperately anxious to hear the glad tidings of
Peace. We were weary of the fierce struggle, and we impatiently awaited the time when the Commandant-General
and the Government should order us to sheathe the sword.

But the night of the Old Year left us engaged in the fierce conflict of hostilities, and the
dawn of the New Year found us still enveloped in the clouds of war--clouds whose blackness
was relieved by no silver lining.

CHAPTER XLV.

MY LAST DAYS ON THE VELDT.

The first month of 1902 found the storm of death and destruction still unabated, and the prospect
appeared as dark as at the commencement of the previous year. Our hand, however, was on the
plough, and there was no looking back. My instructions were, "Go forward and persevere."

To the south of Lydenburg, where a section of my commando under General Muller was operating,
the enemy kept us very busy, for they had one or more columns engaged. We, to the north of
Lydenburg, had a much calmer time of it than our brethren to the south of that place, for there
the British were pursuing their policy of exhausting our people with unsparing hand. I attribute
the fact that we in the north were left comparatively undisturbed to the mountainous nature
of the country. It would have been impossible for the British to have captured us or to have
invaded our mountain recesses successfully without a tremendous force, and, obviously, the
British had no such force at their disposal. Probably also the British had some respect for
the prowess of my commando. An English officer afterwards told me in all seriousness that the
British Intelligence Department had information that I was prowling round to the north of Lydenburg
with 4,000 men and two cannons, and that my men were so splendidly fortified that our position
was unconquerable. Of course, it was not in my interest to enlighten him upon the point. I
was a prisoner-of-war when this amusing information was given me, and I simply answered: "Yes,
your intelligence officers are very smart fellows." The officer then inquired, with an assumption
of candour and innocence, whether it was really a fact that we had still cannon in the field.
To this I retorted: "What would you think if I put a similar question to a British officer
who had fallen into my hands?" At this he bit his thumb and stammered: "I beg your pardon;
I did not mean to--er--insult you." He was quite a young chap this, a conceited puppy, affecting
the "haw-haw," which seems to be epidemic in the British Army. His hair was parted down the
centre, in the manner so popular among certain British officers, and this style of hair-dressing
came to be described by the Boers as "middel-paadje" (middle-path). As a matter of fact, my
men only numbered as many hundreds as the thousands attributed to me by the British. As for
cannons, they simply existed in the imagination of the British Intelligence Department.

Affairs were daily growing more critical. Since the beginning of the year we had made several
attempts at destroying the Delagoa Bay Railway, but the British had constructed so formidable
a network of barbed wire, and their blockhouses were so close together and strongly garrisoned,
that hitherto our attempts had been abortive. The line was also protected by a large number
of armoured trains.

In consequence of our ill-success in this enterprise, we turned our attention to other directions.
We reconnoitred the British garrisons in the Lydenburg district with the object of striking
at their weakest point. A number of my officers and men proceeded under cover of darkness right
through the British outposts, and gained the Lydenburg village by crawling on their hands and
knees. On their return journey they were challenged and fired on several times, and managed
only with difficulty to return to camp unhurt. The object of the reconnaissance was, however,
accomplished. They reported to me that the village was encompassed with barbed wire, and that
a number of blockhouses had been built round it, and also that various large houses of the
village had been barricaded and were strongly occupied. My two professional scouts, Jordaan
and Mellema, had also reconnoitred the village from another direction, and had brought back
confirmatory information and the news that Lydenburg was occupied by about 2,000 British soldiers,
consisting of the Manchester Regiment and the First Royal Irish, together with a corps of "hands-uppers"
under the notorious Harber. Three other Boer spies scouting about the forts on the Crocodile
Heights also brought in discouraging reports.

At the Council of War which then took place, and over which I presided, these reports were
discussed, and we agreed to attack the two blockhouses nearest the village, and thereafter
to storm the village itself. I should mention that it was necessary for us to capture the blockhouses
before attempting to take the village itself, for had we left them intact we should have run
the danger of having our retreat cut off.

The attack was to take place next night, and as we approached the British lines on horseback,
between Spekboom River and Potloodspruit, we dismounted, and proceeded cautiously on foot.
One of the objective blockhouses was on the waggon path to the north of the village, and the
other was 1,000 yards to the east of Potloodspruit. Field-Cornet Young, accompanied by Jordaan
and Mellema, crept up to within 10 feet of one of these blockhouses, and brought me a report
that the barbed wire network which surrounded it rendered an assault an impossible task in
the darkness. Separating my commando of 150 men into two bodies, I placed them on either side
of the blockhouse, sending, in the meanwhile, four men to cut down the wire fences. These men
had instructions to give us a signal when they had achieved this object, so that we could then
proceed to storm the fort. It would have been sacrificing many in vain to have attempted to
proceed without effecting the preliminary operation of fence cutting, since, if we had stormed
a blockhouse without first removing the wire, we should have become entangled in the fences
and have offered splendid targets to the enemy at a very short range, and our losses would,
without doubt, have been considerable.

My fence-cutters stuck doggedly to their task despite the fact that they were being fired upon
by the sentries on guard. It was a long and weary business, but we patiently waited, lying
on the ground. Towards 2 o'clock in the morning the officer in command of the wire-cutters
returned to us, stating that they had accomplished their object in cutting the first wire barrier,
but had come across another which it would require several hours to cut through. The sentries
had, in the meantime, grown unpleasantly vigilant, and were now frequently firing on our men.
They were often so close that at one time, in the darkness, they might have knocked up against
the Boers who were cutting their fences.

It being very nearly 3 o'clock, it appeared to me that the attempt would be ineffectual owing
to the approach of daylight, and we were forced to retire before the rays of the rising sun
lit the heavens and exposed us to the well-aimed fire of the British. I therefore resolved,
after consulting my officers, to retire quietly, and to renew my attempt a week later at another
point. We returned to camp much disappointed, but consoled ourselves with the hope that success
would attend our next efforts.

CHAPTER XLVI.

I AM AMBUSHED AND CAPTURED.

I may say that the barbed wire fences by which the blockhouses were encompassed, constituted
very formidable obstacles to our attacks. Our men were comparatively few, and we could not
afford to lose any of them in futile attempts to capture strongly garrisoned British forts.
Moreover, there were many other ways of inflicting damage on the enemy that did not lay us
open to so much danger.

Heavy and continuous rains had been experienced for some time, and the rivers and spruits were
greatly swollen. The whole of the Lydenburg district, in which we were operating, was besides
enveloped in a thick mist, and both these causes rendered reconnoitring very difficult and
perilous, as we never knew how near the enemy's patrols might be.

About the 15th of January, 1902, I obtained information that our Government were being chased
all over the country, and had now encamped at Windhoek near Dullstroom, to the south of Lydenburg.
At the same time I received an order from Acting-President Schalk Burger, stating that he wished
to see me. This latter intelligence was very acceptable, for I was anxious to renew acquaintance
with the President, and with a personal friend of mine, Mr. J. C. Krojk, who was attached to
the Field Government. Therefore, on receiving this instruction, I set out from Pilgrim's Rest
accompanied by Adjutants Nel, Coetzee, Bester, and Potgieter, for the place where the Government
were encamped. I little expected as I rode along that this would be my last and most fateful
expedition.
