At night the wild libeccio still rose, with floods of rain and lightning poured upon the waste.
I thought of the Florentine patrol. Is he out in it, and where?

At last there came a lull. When we rose on the fourth morning, the sky was sulky, spent and
sleepy after storm--the air as soft and tepid as boiled milk or steaming flannel. We drove
along the shore to Porto Venere, passing the arsenals and dockyards, which have changed the
face of Spezzia since Shelley knew it. This side of the gulf is not so rich in vegetation as
the other, probably because it lies open to the winds from the Carrara mountains. The chestnuts
come down to the shore in many places, bringing with them the wild mountain-side. To make up
for this lack of luxuriance, the coast is furrowed with a succession of tiny harbours, where
the fishing-boats rest at anchor. There are many villages upon the spurs of hills, and on the
headlands naval stations, hospitals, lazzaretti, and prisons. A prickly bindweed (the Smilax
sarsaparilla) forms a feature in the near landscape, with its creamy odoriferous blossoms,
coral berries, and glossy thorned leaves.

A turn of the road brought Porto Venere in sight, and on its grey walls flashed a gleam of
watery sunlight. The village consists of one long narrow street, the houses on the left side
hanging sheer above the sea. Their doors at the back open on to cliffs with drop about fifty
feet upon the water. A line of ancient walls, with medieval battlements and shells of chambers
suspended midway between earth and sky, runs up the rock behind the town; and this wall is
pierced with a deep gateway above which the inn is piled. We had our lunch in a room opening
upon the town-gate, adorned with a deep-cut Pisan arch enclosing images and frescoes--a curious
episode in a place devoted to the jollity of smugglers and seafaring folk. The whole house
was such as Tintoretto loved to paint--huge wooden rafters; open chimneys with pent-house canopies
of stone, where the cauldrons hung above logs of chestnut; rude low tables spread with coarse
linen embroidered at the edges, and laden with plates of fishes, fruit, quaint glass, big-bellied
jugs of earthenware, and flasks of yellow wine. The people of the place were lounging round
in lazy attitudes. There were odd nooks and corners everywhere; unexpected staircases with
windows slanting through the thickness of the town-wall; pictures of saints; high-zoned serving
women, on whose broad shoulders lay big coral beads; smoke-blackened roofs, and balconies that
opened on the sea. The house was inexhaustible in motives for pictures.

We walked up the street, attended by a rabble rout of boys--diavoli scatenati--clean, grinning,
white-teethed, who kept incessantly shouting, "Soldo, soldo!" I do not know why these sea-urchins
are so far more irrepressible than their land brethren. But it is always thus in Italy. They
take an imperturbable delight in noise and mere annoyance. I shall never forget the sea-roar
of Porto Venere, with that shrill obbligato, "Soldo, soldo, soldo!" rattling like a dropping
fire from lungs of brass.

At the end of Porto Venere is a withered and abandoned city, climbing the cliffs of S. Pietro;
and on the headland stands the ruined church, built by Pisans with alternate rows of white
and black marble, upon the site of an old temple of Venus. This is a modest and pure piece
of Gothic architecture, fair in desolation, refined and dignified, and not unworthy in its
grace of the dead Cyprian goddess. Through its broken lancets the sea-wind whistles and the
vast reaches of the Tyrrhene gulf are seen. Samphire sprouts between the blocks of marble,
and in sheltered nooks the caper hangs her beautiful purpureal snowy bloom.

The headland is a bold block of white limestone stained with red. It has the pitch of Exmoor
stooping to the sea near Lynton. To north, as one looks along the coast, the line is broken
by Porto Fino's amethystine promontory; and in the vaporous distance we could trace the Riviera
mountains, shadowy and blue. The sea came roaring, rolling in with tawny breakers; but, far
out, it sparkled in pure azure, and the cloud-shadows over it were violet. Where Corsica should
have been seen, soared banks of fleecy, broad-domed alabaster clouds.

This point, once dedicated to Venus, now to Peter--both, be it remembered, fishers of men--is
one of the most singular in Europe. The island of Palmaria, rich in veined marbles, shelters
the port; so that outside the sea rages, while underneath the town, reached by a narrow strait,
there is a windless calm. It was not without reason that our Lady of Beauty took this fair
gulf to herself; and now that she has long been dispossessed, her memory lingers yet in names.
For Porto Venere remembers her, and Lerici is only Eryx. There is a grotto here, where an inscription
tells us that Byron once "tempted the Ligurian waves." It is just such a natural sea-cave as
might have inspired Euripides when he described the refuge of Orestes in "Iphigenia."

VI.--LERICI.

Libeccio at last had swept the sky clear. The gulf was ridged with foam-fleeced breakers, and
the water churned into green, tawny wastes. But overhead there flew the softest clouds, all
silvery, dispersed in flocks. It is the day for pilgrimage to what was Shelley's home.

After following the shore a little way, the road to Lerici breaks into the low hills which
part La Spezzia from Sarzana. The soil is red, and overgrown with arbutus and pinaster, like
the country around Cannes. Through the scattered trees it winds gently upwards, with frequent
views across the gulf, and then descends into a land rich with olives--a genuine Riviera landscape,
where the mountain-slopes are hoary, and spikelets of innumerable light-flashing leaves twinkle
against a blue sea, misty-deep. The walls here are not unfrequently adorned with bas-reliefs
of Carrara marble--saints and madonnas very delicately wrought, as though they were love-labours
of sculptors who had passed a summer on this shore. San Terenzio is soon discovered low upon
the sands to the right, nestling under little cliffs; and then the high-built castle of Lerici
comes in sight, looking across the bay to Porto Venere--one Aphrodite calling to the other,
with the foam between. The village is piled around its cove with tall and picturesquely-coloured
houses; the molo and the fishing-boats lie just beneath the castle. There is one point of the
descending carriage road where all this gracefulness is seen, framed by the boughs of olive
branches, swaying, wind-ruffled, laughing the many-twinkling smiles of ocean back from their
grey leaves. Here Erycina ridens is at home. And, as we stayed to dwell upon the beauty of
the scene, came women from the bay below--barefooted, straight as willow wands, with burnished
copper bowls upon their heads. These women have the port of goddesses, deep-bosomed, with the
length of thigh and springing ankles that betoken strength no less than elasticity and grace.
The hair of some of them was golden, rippling in little curls around brown brows and glowing
eyes. Pale lilac blent with orange on their dress, and coral beads hung from their ears.
