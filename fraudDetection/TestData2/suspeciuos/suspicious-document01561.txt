CHAPTER I. AN INVITATION FOR TOM AND HUCK

     [Note: Strange as the incidents of this story are, they
     are not inventions, but facts--even to the public confession
     of the accused.  I take them from an old-time Swedish
     criminal trial, change the actors, and transfer the scenes
     to America.  I have added some details, but only a couple of
     them are important ones. -- M. T.]

WELL, it was the next spring after me and Tom Sawyer set our old nigger Jim free, the time
he was chained up for a runaway slave down there on Tom's uncle Silas's farm in Arkansaw. The
frost was working out of the ground, and out of the air, too, and it was getting closer and
closer onto barefoot time every day; and next it would be marble time, and next mumbletypeg,
and next tops and hoops, and next kites, and then right away it would be summer and going in
a-swimming. It just makes a boy homesick to look ahead like that and see how far off summer
is. Yes, and it sets him to sighing and saddening around, and there's something the matter
with him, he don't know what. But anyway, he gets out by himself and mopes and thinks; and
mostly he hunts for a lonesome place high up on the hill in the edge of the woods, and sets
there and looks away off on the big Mississippi down there a-reaching miles and miles around
the points where the timber looks smoky and dim it's so far off and still, and everything's
so solemn it seems like everybody you've loved is dead and gone, and you 'most wish you was
dead and gone too, and done with it all.

Don't you know what that is? It's spring fever. That is what the name of it is. And when you've
got it, you want--oh, you don't quite know what it is you DO want, but it just fairly makes
your heart ache, you want it so! It seems to you that mainly what you want is to get away;
get away from the same old tedious things you're so used to seeing and so tired of, and set
something new. That is the idea; you want to go and be a wanderer; you want to go wandering
far away to strange countries where everything is mysterious and wonderful and romantic. And
if you can't do that, you'll put up with considerable less; you'll go anywhere you CAN go,
just so as to get away, and be thankful of the chance, too.

Well, me and Tom Sawyer had the spring fever, and had it bad, too; but it warn't any use to
think about Tom trying to get away, because, as he said, his Aunt Polly wouldn't let him quit
school and go traipsing off somers wasting time; so we was pretty blue. We was setting on the
front steps one day about sundown talking this way, when out comes his aunt Polly with a letter
in her hand and says:

"Tom, I reckon you've got to pack up and go down to Arkansaw--your aunt Sally wants you."

I 'most jumped out of my skin for joy. I reckoned Tom would fly at his aunt and hug her head
off; but if you believe me he set there like a rock, and never said a word. It made me fit
to cry to see him act so foolish, with such a noble chance as this opening up. Why, we might
lose it if he didn't speak up and show he was thankful and grateful. But he set there and studied
and studied till I was that distressed I didn't know what to do; then he says, very ca'm, and
I could a shot him for it:

"Well," he says, "I'm right down sorry, Aunt Polly, but I reckon I got to be excused--for the
present."

His aunt Polly was knocked so stupid and so mad at the cold impudence of it that she couldn't
say a word for as much as a half a minute, and this gave me a chance to nudge Tom and whisper:

"Ain't you got any sense? Sp'iling such a noble chance as this and throwing it away?"

But he warn't disturbed. He mumbled back:

"Huck Finn, do you want me to let her SEE how bad I want to go? Why, she'd begin to doubt,
right away, and imagine a lot of sicknesses and dangers and objections, and first you know
she'd take it all back. You lemme alone; I reckon I know how to work her."

Now I never would 'a' thought of that. But he was right. Tom Sawyer was always right--the levelest
head I ever see, and always AT himself and ready for anything you might spring on him. By this
time his aunt Polly was all straight again, and she let fly. She says:

"You'll be excused! YOU will! Well, I never heard the like of it in all my days! The idea of
you talking like that to ME! Now take yourself off and pack your traps; and if I hear another
word out of you about what you'll be excused from and what you won't, I lay I'LL excuse you--with
a hickory!"

She hit his head a thump with her thimble as we dodged by, and he let on to be whimpering as
we struck for the stairs. Up in his room he hugged me, he was so out of his head for gladness
because he was going traveling. And he says:

"Before we get away she'll wish she hadn't let me go, but she won't know any way to get around
it now. After what she's said, her pride won't let her take it back."

Tom was packed in ten minutes, all except what his aunt and Mary would finish up for him; then
we waited ten more for her to get cooled down and sweet and gentle again; for Tom said it took
her ten minutes to unruffle in times when half of her feathers was up, but twenty when they
was all up, and this was one of the times when they was all up. Then we went down, being in
a sweat to know what the letter said.

She was setting there in a brown study, with it laying in her lap. We set down, and she says:

"They're in considerable trouble down there, and they think you and Huck'll be a kind of diversion
for them--'comfort,' they say. Much of that they'll get out of you and Huck Finn, I reckon.
There's a neighbor named Brace Dunlap that's been wanting to marry their Benny for three months,
and at last they told him point blank and once for all, he COULDN'T; so he has soured on them,
and they're worried about it. I reckon he's somebody they think they better be on the good
side of, for they've tried to please him by hiring his no-account brother to help on the farm
when they can't hardly afford it, and don't want him around anyhow. Who are the Dunlaps?"

"They live about a mile from Uncle Silas's place, Aunt Polly--all the farmers live about a
mile apart down there--and Brace Dunlap is a long sight richer than any of the others, and
owns a whole grist of niggers. He's a widower, thirty-six years old, without any children,
and is proud of his money and overbearing, and everybody is a little afraid of him. I judge
he thought he could have any girl he wanted, just for the asking, and it must have set him
back a good deal when he found he couldn't get Benny. Why, Benny's only half as old as he is,
and just as sweet and lovely as--well, you've seen her. Poor old Uncle Silas--why, it's pitiful,
him trying to curry favor that way--so hard pushed and poor, and yet hiring that useless Jubiter
Dunlap to please his ornery brother."

"What a name--Jubiter! Where'd he get it?"

"It's only just a nickname. I reckon they've forgot his real name long before this. He's twenty-seven,
now, and has had it ever since the first time he ever went in swimming. The school teacher
seen a round brown mole the size of a dime on his left leg above his knee, and four little
bits of moles around it, when he was naked, and he said it minded him of Jubiter and his moons;
and the children thought it was funny, and so they got to calling him Jubiter, and he's Jubiter
yet. He's tall, and lazy, and sly, and sneaky, and ruther cowardly, too, but kind of good-natured,
and wears long brown hair and no beard, and hasn't got a cent, and Brace boards him for nothing,
and gives him his old clothes to wear, and despises him. Jubiter is a twin."

"What's t'other twin like?"

"Just exactly like Jubiter--so they say; used to was, anyway, but he hain't been seen for seven
years. He got to robbing when he was nineteen or twenty, and they jailed him; but he broke
jail and got away--up North here, somers. They used to hear about him robbing and burglaring
now and then, but that was years ago. He's dead, now. At least that's what they say. They don't
hear about him any more."

"What was his name?"

"Jake."

There wasn't anything more said for a considerable while; the old lady was thinking. At last
she says:

"The thing that is mostly worrying your aunt Sally is the tempers that that man Jubiter gets
your uncle into."

Tom was astonished, and so was I. Tom says:

"Tempers? Uncle Silas? Land, you must be joking! I didn't know he HAD any temper."

"Works him up into perfect rages, your aunt Sally says; says he acts as if he would really
hit the man, sometimes."

"Aunt Polly, it beats anything I ever heard of. Why, he's just as gentle as mush."

"Well, she's worried, anyway. Says your uncle Silas is like a changed man, on account of all
this quarreling. And the neighbors talk about it, and lay all the blame on your uncle, of course,
because he's a preacher and hain't got any business to quarrel. Your aunt Sally says he hates
to go into the pulpit he's so ashamed; and the people have begun to cool toward him, and he
ain't as popular now as he used to was."

"Well, ain't it strange? Why, Aunt Polly, he was always so good and kind and moony and absent-minded
and chuckle-headed and lovable--why, he was just an angel! What CAN be the matter of him, do
you reckon?"

CHAPTER II. JAKE DUNLAP

WE had powerful good luck; because we got a chance in a stern-wheeler from away North which
was bound for one of them bayous or one-horse rivers away down Louisiana way, and so we could
go all the way down the Upper Mississippi and all the way down the Lower Mississippi to that
farm in Arkansaw without having to change steamboats at St. Louis; not so very much short of
a thousand miles at one pull.

A pretty lonesome boat; there warn't but few passengers, and all old folks, that set around,
wide apart, dozing, and was very quiet. We was four days getting out of the "upper river,"
because we got aground so much. But it warn't dull--couldn't be for boys that was traveling,
of course.

From the very start me and Tom allowed that there was somebody sick in the stateroom next to
ourn, because the meals was always toted in there by the waiters. By and by we asked about
it--Tom did and the waiter said it was a man, but he didn't look sick.

"Well, but AIN'T he sick?"

"I don't know; maybe he is, but 'pears to me he's just letting on."

"What makes you think that?"

"Because if he was sick he would pull his clothes off SOME time or other--don't you reckon
he would? Well, this one don't. At least he don't ever pull off his boots, anyway."

"The mischief he don't! Not even when he goes to bed?"

"No."

It was always nuts for Tom Sawyer--a mystery was. If you'd lay out a mystery and a pie before
me and him, you wouldn't have to say take your choice; it was a thing that would regulate itself.
Because in my nature I have always run to pie, whilst in his nature he has always run to mystery.
People are made different. And it is the best way. Tom says to the waiter:

"What's the man's name?"

"Phillips."

"Where'd he come aboard?"

"I think he got aboard at Elexandria, up on the Iowa line."

"What do you reckon he's a-playing?"

"I hain't any notion--I never thought of it."

I says to myself, here's another one that runs to pie.

"Anything peculiar about him?--the way he acts or talks?"

"No--nothing, except he seems so scary, and keeps his doors locked night and day both, and
when you knock he won't let you in till he opens the door a crack and sees who it is."

"By jimminy, it's int'resting! I'd like to get a look at him. Say--the next time you're going
in there, don't you reckon you could spread the door and--"

"No, indeedy! He's always behind it. He would block that game."

Tom studied over it, and then he says:

"Looky here. You lend me your apern and let me take him his breakfast in the morning. I'll
give you a quarter."

The boy was plenty willing enough, if the head steward wouldn't mind. Tom says that's all right,
he reckoned he could fix it with the head steward; and he done it. He fixed it so as we could
both go in with aperns on and toting vittles.

He didn't sleep much, he was in such a sweat to get in there and find out the mystery about
Phillips; and moreover he done a lot of guessing about it all night, which warn't no use, for
if you are going to find out the facts of a thing, what's the sense in guessing out what ain't
the facts and wasting ammunition? I didn't lose no sleep. I wouldn't give a dern to know what's
the matter of Phillips, I says to myself.

Well, in the morning we put on the aperns and got a couple of trays of truck, and Tom he knocked
on the door. The man opened it a crack, and then he let us in and shut it quick. By Jackson,
when we got a sight of him, we 'most dropped the trays! and Tom says:

"Why, Jubiter Dunlap, where'd YOU come from?"

Well, the man was astonished, of course; and first off he looked like he didn't know whether
to be scared, or glad, or both, or which, but finally he settled down to being glad; and then
his color come back, though at first his face had turned pretty white. So we got to talking
together while he et his breakfast. And he says:

"But I aint Jubiter Dunlap. I'd just as soon tell you who I am, though, if you'll swear to
keep mum, for I ain't no Phillips, either."

Tom says:

"We'll keep mum, but there ain't any need to tell who you are if you ain't Jubiter Dunlap."

"Why?"

"Because if you ain't him you're t'other twin, Jake. You're the spit'n image of Jubiter."

"Well, I'm Jake. But looky here, how do you come to know us Dunlaps?"

Tom told about the adventures we'd had down there at his uncle Silas's last summer, and when
he see that there warn't anything about his folks--or him either, for that matter--that we
didn't know, he opened out and talked perfectly free and candid. He never made any bones about
his own case; said he'd been a hard lot, was a hard lot yet, and reckoned he'd be a hard lot
plumb to the end. He said of course it was a dangerous life, and--He give a kind of gasp, and
set his head like a person that's listening. We didn't say anything, and so it was very still
for a second or so, and there warn't no sounds but the screaking of the woodwork and the chug-chugging
of the machinery down below.

Then we got him comfortable again, telling him about his people, and how Brace's wife had been
dead three years, and Brace wanted to marry Benny and she shook him, and Jubiter was working
for Uncle Silas, and him and Uncle Silas quarreling all the time--and then he let go and laughed.

"Land!" he says, "it's like old times to hear all this tittle-tattle, and does me good. It's
been seven years and more since I heard any. How do they talk about me these days?"

"Who?"

"The farmers--and the family."

"Why, they don't talk about you at all--at least only just a mention, once in a long time."

"The nation!" he says, surprised; "why is that?"

"Because they think you are dead long ago."

"No! Are you speaking true?--honor bright, now." He jumped up, excited.

"Honor bright. There ain't anybody thinks you are alive."

"Then I'm saved, I'm saved, sure! I'll go home. They'll hide me and save my life. You keep
mum. Swear you'll keep mum--swear you'll never, never tell on me. Oh, boys, be good to a poor
devil that's being hunted day and night, and dasn't show his face! I've never done you any
harm; I'll never do you any, as God is in the heavens; swear you'll be good to me and help
me save my life."

We'd a swore it if he'd been a dog; and so we done it. Well, he couldn't love us enough for
it or be grateful enough, poor cuss; it was all he could do to keep from hugging us.

We talked along, and he got out a little hand-bag and begun to open it, and told us to turn
our backs. We done it, and when he told us to turn again he was perfectly different to what
he was before. He had on blue goggles and the naturalest-looking long brown whiskers and mustashes
you ever see. His own mother wouldn't 'a' knowed him. He asked us if he looked like his brother
Jubiter, now.

"No," Tom said; "there ain't anything left that's like him except the long hair."

"All right, I'll get that cropped close to my head before I get there; then him and Brace will
keep my secret, and I'll live with them as being a stranger, and the neighbors won't ever guess
me out. What do you think?"

Tom he studied awhile, then he says:

"Well, of course me and Huck are going to keep mum there, but if you don't keep mum yourself
there's going to be a little bit of a risk--it ain't much, maybe, but it's a little. I mean,
if you talk, won't people notice that your voice is just like Jubiter's; and mightn't it make
them think of the twin they reckoned was dead, but maybe after all was hid all this time under
another name?"

"By George," he says, "you're a sharp one! You're perfectly right. I've got to play deef and
dumb when there's a neighbor around. If I'd a struck for home and forgot that little detail--However,
I wasn't striking for home. I was breaking for any place where I could get away from these
fellows that are after me; then I was going to put on this disguise and get some different
clothes, and--"

He jumped for the outside door and laid his ear against it and listened, pale and kind of panting.
Presently he whispers:

"Sounded like cocking a gun! Lord, what a life to lead!"

Then he sunk down in a chair all limp and sick like, and wiped the sweat off of his face.

CHAPTER III. A DIAMOND ROBBERY

FROM that time out, we was with him 'most all the time, and one or t'other of us slept in his
upper berth. He said he had been so lonesome, and it was such a comfort to him to have company,
and somebody to talk to in his troubles. We was in a sweat to find out what his secret was,
but Tom said the best way was not to seem anxious, then likely he would drop into it himself
in one of his talks, but if we got to asking questions he would get suspicious and shet up
his shell. It turned out just so. It warn't no trouble to see that he WANTED to talk about
it, but always along at first he would scare away from it when he got on the very edge of it,
and go to talking about something else. The way it come about was this: He got to asking us,
kind of indifferent like, about the passengers down on deck. We told him about them. But he
warn't satisfied; we warn't particular enough. He told us to describe them better. Tom done
it. At last, when Tom was describing one of the roughest and raggedest ones, he gave a shiver
and a gasp and says:

"Oh, lordy, that's one of them! They're aboard sure--I just knowed it. I sort of hoped I had
got away, but I never believed it. Go on."

Presently when Tom was describing another mangy, rough deck passenger, he give that shiver
again and says:

"That's him!--that's the other one. If it would only come a good black stormy night and I could
get ashore. You see, they've got spies on me. They've got a right to come up and buy drinks
at the bar yonder forrard, and they take that chance to bribe somebody to keep watch on me--porter
or boots or somebody. If I was to slip ashore without anybody seeing me, they would know it
inside of an hour."

So then he got to wandering along, and pretty soon, sure enough, he was telling! He was poking
along through his ups and downs, and when he come to that place he went right along. He says:

"It was a confidence game. We played it on a julery-shop in St. Louis. What we was after was
a couple of noble big di'monds as big as hazel-nuts, which everybody was running to see. We
was dressed up fine, and we played it on them in broad daylight. We ordered the di'monds sent
to the hotel for us to see if we wanted to buy, and when we was examining them we had paste
counterfeits all ready, and THEM was the things that went back to the shop when we said the
water wasn't quite fine enough for twelve thousand dollars."

"Twelve-thousand-dollars!" Tom says. "Was they really worth all that money, do you reckon?"

"Every cent of it."

"And you fellows got away with them?"

"As easy as nothing. I don't reckon the julery people know they've been robbed yet. But it
wouldn't be good sense to stay around St. Louis, of course, so we considered where we'd go.
One was for going one way, one another, so we throwed up, heads or tails, and the Upper Mississippi
won. We done up the di'monds in a paper and put our names on it and put it in the keep of the
hotel clerk, and told him not to ever let either of us have it again without the others was
on hand to see it done; then we went down town, each by his own self--because I reckon maybe
we all had the same notion. I don't know for certain, but I reckon maybe we had."

"What notion?" Tom says.

"To rob the others."

"What--one take everything, after all of you had helped to get it?"

"Cert'nly."

It disgusted Tom Sawyer, and he said it was the orneriest, low-downest thing he ever heard
of. But Jake Dunlap said it warn't unusual in the profession. Said when a person was in that
line of business he'd got to look out for his own intrust, there warn't nobody else going to
do it for him. And then he went on. He says:

"You see, the trouble was, you couldn't divide up two di'monds amongst three. If there'd been
three--But never mind about that, there warn't three. I loafed along the back streets studying
and studying. And I says to myself, I'll hog them di'monds the first chance I get, and I'll
have a disguise all ready, and I'll give the boys the slip, and when I'm safe away I'll put
it on, and then let them find me if they can. So I got the false whiskers and the goggles and
this countrified suit of clothes, and fetched them along back in a hand-bag; and when I was
passing a shop where they sell all sorts of things, I got a glimpse of one of my pals through
the window. It was Bud Dixon. I was glad, you bet. I says to myself, I'll see what he buys.
So I kept shady, and watched. Now what do you reckon it was he bought?"

"Whiskers?" said I.

"No."

"Goggles?"

"No."

"Oh, keep still, Huck Finn, can't you, you're only just hendering all you can. What WAS it
he bought, Jake?"

"You'd never guess in the world. It was only just a screwdriver--just a wee little bit of a
screwdriver."

"Well, I declare! What did he want with that?"
