Peter

"No, Antone, I have told thee many times, no, thou shalt not sell it until I am gone."

"But I need money; what good is that old fiddle to thee? The very crows laugh at thee when
thou art trying to play. Thy hand trembles so thou canst scarce hold the bow. Thou shalt go
with me to the Blue to cut wood to-morrow. See to it thou art up early."

"What, on the Sabbath, Antone, when it is so cold? I get so very cold, my son, let us not go
to-morrow."

"Yes, to-morrow, thou lazy old man. Do not I cut wood upon the Sabbath? Care I how cold it
is? Wood thou shalt cut, and haul it too, and as for the fiddle, I tell thee I will sell it
yet." Antone pulled his ragged cap down over his low heavy brow, and went out. The old man
drew his stool up nearer the fire, and sat stroking his violin with trembling fingers and muttering,
"Not while I live, not while I live."

Five years ago they had come here, Peter Sadelack, and his wife, and oldest son Antone, and
countless smaller Sadelacks, here to the dreariest part of south-western Nebraska, and had
taken up a homestead. Antone was the acknowledged master of the premises, and people said he
was a likely youth, and would do well. That he was mean and untrustworthy every one knew, but
that made little difference. His corn was better tended than any in the county, and his wheat
always yielded more than other men's.

Of Peter no one knew much, nor had any one a good word to say for him. He drank whenever he
could get out of Antone's sight long enough to pawn his hat or coat for whiskey. Indeed there
were but two things he would not pawn, his pipe and his violin. He was a lazy, absent minded
old fellow, who liked to fiddle better than to plow, though Antone surely got work enough out
of them all, for that matter. In the house of which Antone was master there was no one, from
the little boy three years old, to the old man of sixty, who did not earn his bread. Still
people said that Peter was worthless, and was a great drag on Antone, his son, who never drank,
and was a much better man than his father had ever been. Peter did not care what people said.
He did not like the country, nor the people, least of all he liked the plowing. He was very
homesick for Bohemia. Long ago, only eight years ago by the calendar, but it seemed eight centuries
to Peter, he had been a second violinist in the great theatre at Prague. He had gone into the
theatre very young, and had been there all his life, until he had a stroke of paralysis, which
made his arm so weak that his bowing was uncertain. Then they told him he could go. Those were
great days at the theatre. He had plenty to drink then, and wore a dress coat every evening,
and there were always parties after the play. He could play in those days, ay, that he could!
He could never read the notes well, so he did not play first; but his touch, he had a touch
indeed, so Herr Mikilsdoff, who led the orchestra, had said. Sometimes now Peter thought he
could plow better if he could only bow as he used to. He had seen all the lovely women in the
world there, all the great singers and the great players. He was in the orchestra when Rachel
played, and he heard Liszt play when the Countess d'Agoult sat in the stage box and threw the
master white lilies. Once, a French woman came and played for weeks, he did not remember her
name now. He did not remember her face very well either, for it changed so, it was never twice
the same. But the beauty of it, and the great hunger men felt at the sight of it, that he remembered.
Most of all he remembered her voice. He did not know French, and could not understand a word
she said, but it seemed to him that she must be talking the music of Chopin. And her voice,
he thought he should know that in the other world. The last night she played a play in which
a man touched her arm, and she stabbed him. As Peter sat among the smoking gas jets down below
the footlights with his fiddle on his knee, and looked up at her, he thought he would like
to die too, if he could touch her arm once, and have her stab him so. Peter went home to his
wife very drunk that night. Even in those days he was a foolish fellow, who cared for nothing
but music and pretty faces.

It was all different now. He had nothing to drink and little to eat, and here, there was nothing
but sun, and grass, and sky. He had forgotten almost everything, but some things he remembered
well enough. He loved his violin and the holy Mary, and above all else he feared the Evil One,
and his son Antone.

The fire was low, and it grew cold. Still Peter sat by the fire remembering. He dared not throw
more cobs on the fire; Antone would be angry. He did not want to cut wood tomorrow, it would
be Sunday, and he wanted to go to mass. Antone might let him do that. He held his violin under
his wrinkled chin, his white hair fell over it, and he began to play "Ave Maria." His hand
shook more than ever before, and at last refused to work the bow at all. He sat stupefied for
a while, then arose, and taking his violin with him, stole out into the old sod stable. He
took Antone's shot-gun down from its peg, and loaded it by the moonlight which streamed in
through the door. He sat down on the dirt floor, and leaned back against the dirt wall. He
heard the wolves howling in the distance, and the night wind screaming as it swept over the
snow. Near him he heard the regular breathing of the horses in the dark. He put his crucifix
above his heart, and folding his hands said brokenly all the Latin he had ever known, "Pater
noster, qui in cælum est." Then he raised his head and sighed, "Not one kreutzer will Antone
pay them to pray for my soul, not one kreutzer, he is so careful of his money, is Antone, he
does not waste it in drink, he is a better man than I, but hard sometimes. He works the girls
too hard, women were not made to work so. But he shall not sell thee, my fiddle, I can play
thee no more, but they shall not part us. We have seen it all together, and we will forget
it together, the French woman and all." He held his fiddle under his chin a moment, where it
had lain so often, then put it across his knee and broke it through the middle. He pulled off
his old boot, held the gun between his knees with the muzzle against his forehead, and pressed
the trigger with his toe.

In the morning Antone found him stiff, frozen fast in a pool of blood. They could not straighten
him out enough to fit a coffin, so they buried him in a pine box. Before the funeral Antone
carried to town the fiddle-bow which Peter had forgotten to break. Antone was very thrifty,
and a better man than his father had been. To-night there was hot liquor in the glass and hot
blood in the heart; to-night they danced. To-night he was a man, with a man's rights and a
man's power.

"You go away to-morrow?"

"Yes, we have stayed longer than we thought to now."

"You not come back any more?"

"No, I expect not.

The Sentimentality of William Tavener

It takes a strong woman to make any sort of success of living in the West, and Hester undoubtedly
was that. When people spoke of William Tavener as the most prosperous farmer in McPherson County,
they usually added that his wife was a "good manager." She was an executive woman, quick of
tongue and something of an imperatrix. The only reason her husband did not consult her about
his business was that she did not wait to be consulted.

It would have been quite impossible for one man, within the limited sphere of human action,
to follow all Hester's advice, but in the end William usually acted upon some of her suggestions.
When she incessantly denounced the "shiftlessness" of letting a new threshing machine stand
unprotected in the open, he eventually built a shed for it. When she sniffed contemptuously
at his notion of fencing a hog corral with sod walls, he made a spiritless beginning on the
structure--merely to "show his temper," as she put it--but in the end he went off quietly to
town and bought enough barbed wire to complete the fence. When the first heavy rains came on,
and the pigs rooted down the sod wall and made little paths all over it to facilitate their
ascent, he heard his wife relate with relish the story of the little pig that built a mud house,
to the minister at the dinner table, and William's gravity never relaxed for an instant. Silence,
indeed, was William's refuge and his strength.

William set his boys a wholesome example to respect their mother. People who knew him very
well suspected that he even admired her. He was a hard man towards his neighbors, and even
towards his sons; grasping, determined and ambitious.

There was an occasional blue day about the house when William went over the store bills, but
he never objected to items relating to his wife's gowns or bonnets. So it came about that many
of the foolish, unnecessary little things that Hester bought for boys, she had charged to her
personal account.

One spring night Hester sat in a rocking chair by the sitting room window, darning socks. She
rocked violently and sent her long needle vigorously back and forth over her gourd, and it
took only a very casual glance to see that she was wrought up over something. William sat on
the other side of the table reading his farm paper. If he had noticed his wife's agitation,
his calm, clean-shaven face betrayed no sign of concern. He must have noticed the sarcastic
turn of her remarks at the supper table, and he must have noticed the moody silence of the
older boys as they ate. When supper was but half over little Billy, the youngest, had suddenly
pushed back his plate and slipped away from the table, manfully trying to swallow a sob. But
William Tavener never heeded ominous forecasts in the domestic horizon, and he never looked
for a storm until it broke.

After supper the boys had gone to the pond under the willows in the big cattle corral, to get
rid of the dust of plowing. Hester could hear an occasional splash and a laugh ringing clear
through the stillness of the night, as she sat by the open window. She sat silent for almost
an hour reviewing in her mind many plans of attack. But she was too vigorous a woman to be
much of a strategist, and she usually came to her point with directness. At last she cut her
thread and suddenly put her darning down, saying emphatically:

"William, I don't think it would hurt you to let the boys go to that circus in town to-morrow."

William continued to read his farm paper, but it was not Hester's custom to wait for an answer.
She usually divined his arguments and assailed them one by one before he uttered them.

"You've been short of hands all summer, and you've worked the boys hard, and a man ought use
his own flesh and blood as well as he does his hired hands. We're plenty able to afford it,
and it's little enough our boys ever spend. I don't see how you can expect 'em to be steady
and hard workin', unless you encourage 'em a little. I never could see much harm in circuses,
and our boys have never been to one. Oh, I know Jim Howley's boys get drunk an' carry on when
they go, but our boys ain't that sort, an' you know it, William. The animals are real instructive,
an' our boys don't get to see much out here on the prairie. It was different where we were
raised, but the boys have got no advantages here, an' if you don't take care, they'll grow
up to be greenhorns."

Hester paused a moment, and William folded up his paper, but vouchsafed no remark. His sisters
in Virginia had often said that only a quiet man like William could ever have lived with Hester
Perkins. Secretly, William was rather proud of his wife's "gift of speech," and of the fact
that she could talk in prayer meeting as fluently as a man. He confined his own efforts in
that line to a brief prayer at Covenant meetings.

Hester shook out another sock and went on.

"Nobody was ever hurt by goin' to a circus. Why, law me! I remember I went to one myself once,
when I was little. I had most forgot about it. It was over at Pewtown, an' I remember how I
had set my heart on going. I don't think I'd ever forgiven my father if he hadn't taken me,
though that red clay road was in a frightful way after the rain. I mind they had an elephant
and six poll parrots, an' a Rocky Mountain lion, an' a cage of monkeys, an' two camels. My!
but they were a sight to me then!"

Hester dropped the black sock and shook her head and smiled at the recollection. She was not
expecting anything from William yet, and she was fairly startled when he said gravely, in much
the same tone in which he announced the hymns in prayer meeting:

"No, there was only one camel. The other was a dromedary."

She peered around the lamp and looked at him keenly.

"Why, William, how come you to know?"

William folded his paper and answered with some hesitation, "I was there, too."

Hester's interest flashed up.--"Well, I never, William! To think of my finding it out after
all these years! Why, you couldn't have been much bigger'n our Billy then. It seems queer I
never saw you when you was little, to remember about you. But then you Back Creek folks never
have anything to do with us Gap people. But how come you to go? Your father was stricter with
you than you are with your boys."

"I reckon I shouldn't 'a gone," he said slowly, "but boys will do foolish things. I had done
a good deal of fox hunting the winter before, and father let me keep the bounty money. I hired
Tom Smith's Tap to weed the corn for me, an' I slipped off unbeknownst to father an' went to
the show."

Hester spoke up warmly: "Nonsense, William! It didn't do you no harm, I guess. You was always
worked hard enough. It must have been a big sight for a little fellow. That clown must have
just tickled you to death."

William crossed his knees and leaned back in his chair.

"I reckon I could tell all that fool's jokes now. Sometimes I can't help thinkin' about 'em
in meetin' when the sermon's long. I mind I had on a pair of new boots that hurt me like the
mischief, but I forgot all about 'em when that fellow rode the donkey. I recall I had to take
them boots off as soon as I got out of sight o' town, and walked home in the mud barefoot."

"O poor little fellow!" Hester ejaculated, drawing her chair nearer and leaning her elbows
on the table. "What cruel shoes they did use to make for children. I remember I went up to
Back Creek to see the circus wagons go by. They came down from Romney, you know. The circus
men stopped at the creek to water the animals, an' the elephant got stubborn an' broke a big
limb off the yellow willow tree that grew there by the toll house porch, an' the Scribners
were 'fraid as death he'd pull the house down. But this much I saw him do; he waded in the
creek an' filled his trunk with water, and squirted it in at the window and nearly ruined Ellen
Scribner's pink lawn dress that she had just ironed an' laid out on the bed ready to wear to
the circus."

"I reckon that must have been a trial to Ellen," chuckled William, "for she was mighty prim
in them days."

Hester drew her chair still nearer William's. Since the children had begun growing up, her
conversation with her husband had been almost wholly confined to questions of economy and expense.
Their relationship had become purely a business one, like that between landlord and tenant.
In her desire to indulge her boys she had unconsciously assumed a defensive and almost hostile
attitude towards her husband. No debtor ever haggled with his usurer more doggedly than did
Hester with her husband in behalf of her sons. The strategic contest had gone on so long that
it had almost crowded out the memory of a closer relationship. This exchange of confidences
to-night, when common recollections took them unawares and opened their hearts, had all the
miracle of romance. They talked on and on; of old neighbors, of old familiar faces in the valley
where they had grown up, of long forgotten incidents of their youth--weddings, picnics, sleighing
parties and baptizings. For years they had talked of nothing else but butter and eggs and the
prices of things, and now they had as much to say to each other as people who meet after a
long separation.

When the clock struck ten, William rose and went over to his walnut secretary and unlocked
it. From his red leather wallet he took out a ten dollar bill and laid it on the table beside
Hester.

"Tell the boys not to stay late, an' not to drive the horses hard," he said quietly, and went
off to bed.

Hester blew out the lamp and sat still in the dark a long time. She left the bill lying on
the table where William had placed it. She had a painful sense of having missed something,
or lost something; she felt that somehow the years had cheated her.

The little locust trees that grew by the fence were white with blossoms. Their heavy odor floated
in to her on the night wind and recalled a night long ago, when the first whip-poor-Will of
the Spring was heard, and the rough, buxom girls of Hawkins Gap had held her laughing and struggling
under the locust trees, and searched in her bosom for a lock of her sweetheart's hair, which
is supposed to be on every girl's breast when the first whip-poor-Will sings. Two of those
same girls had been her bridesmaids. Hester had been a very happy bride. She rose and went
softly into the room where William lay. He was sleeping heavily, but occasionally moved his
hand before his face to ward off the flies. Hester went into the parlor and took the piece
of mosquito net from the basket of wax apples and pears that her sister had made before she
died. One of the boys had brought it all the way from Virginia, packed in a tin pail, since
Hester would not risk shipping so precious an ornament by freight. She went back to the bed
room and spread the net over William's head.

Then she sat down by the bed and listened to his deep, regular breathing until she heard the
boys returning. She went out to meet them and warn them not to waken their father.

"I'll be up early to get your breakfast, boys. Your father says you can go to the show." As
she handed the money to the eldest, she felt a sudden throb of allegiance to her husband and
said sharply, "And you be careful of that, an' don't waste it. Your father works hard for his
money."

The boys looked at each other in astonishment and felt that they had lost a powerful ally.

The Namesake

Seven of us, students, sat one evening in Hartwell's studio on the Boulevard St. Michel. We
were all fellow-countrymen; one from New Hampshire, one from Colorado, another from Nevada,
several from the farm lands of the Middle West, and I myself from California. Lyon Hartwell,
though born abroad, was simply, as every one knew, "from America." He seemed, almost more than
any other one living man, to mean all of it--from ocean to ocean. When he was in Paris, his
studio was always open to the seven of us who were there that evening, and we intruded upon
his leisure as often as we thought permissible.

Although we were within the terms of the easiest of all intimacies, and although the great
sculptor, even when he was more than usually silent, was at all times the most gravely cordial
of hosts, yet, on that long remembered evening, as the sunlight died on the burnished brown
of the horse-chestnuts below the windows, a perceptible dullness yawned through our conversation.

We were, indeed, somewhat low in spirit, for one of our number, Charley Bentley, was leaving
us indefinitely, in response to an imperative summons from home. To-morrow his studio, just
across the hall from Hartwell's, was to pass into other hands, and Bentley's luggage was even
now piled in discouraged resignation before his door. The various bales and boxes seemed literally
to weigh upon us as we sat in his neighbor's hospitable rooms, drearily putting in the time
until he should leave us to catch the ten o'clock express for Dieppe.

The day we had got through very comfortably, for Bentley made it the occasion of a somewhat
pretentious luncheon at Maxim's. There had been twelve of us at table, and the two young Poles
were thirsty, the Gascon so fabulously entertaining, that it was near upon five o'clock when
we put down our liqueur glasses for the last time, and the red, perspiring waiter, having pocketed
the reward of his arduous and protracted services, bowed us affably to the door, flourishing
his napkin and brushing back the streaks of wet, black hair from his rosy forehead. Our guests
having betaken themselves belated to their respective engagements, the rest of us returned
with Bentley--only to be confronted by the depressing array before his door. A glance about
his denuded rooms had sufficed to chill the glow of the afternoon, and we fled across the hall
in a body and begged Lyon Hartwell to take us in.

Bentley had said very little about it, but we all knew what it meant to him to be called home.
Each of us knew what it would mean to himself, and each had felt something of that quickened
sense of opportunity which comes at seeing another man in any way counted out of the race.
Never had the game seemed so enchanting, the chance to play it such a piece of unmerited, unbelievable
good fortune.

It must have been, I think, about the middle of October, for I remember that the sycamores
were almost bare in the Luxembourg Gardens that morning, and the terrace about the queens of
France were strewn with crackling brown leaves. The fat red roses, out the summer long on the
stand of the old flower woman at the corner, had given place to dahlias and purple asters.
First glimpses of autumn toilettes flashed from the carriages; wonderful little bonnets nodded
at one along the Champs-Elysées; and in the Quarter an occasional feather boa, red or black
or white, brushed one's coat sleeve in the gay twilight of the early evening. The crisp, sunny
autumn air was all day full of the stir of people and carriages and of the cheer of salutations;
greetings of the students, returned brown and bearded from their holiday, gossip of people
come back from Trouville, from St. Valery, from Dieppe, from all over Brittany and the Norman
coast. Everywhere was the joyousness of return, the taking up again of life and work and play.

I had felt ever since early morning that this was the saddest of all possible seasons for saying
good-by to that old, old city of youth, and to that little corner of it on the south shore
which since the Dark Ages themselves--yes, and before--has been so peculiarly the land of the
young.

I can recall our very postures as we lounged about Hartwell's rooms that evening, with Bentley
making occasional hurried trips to his desolated workrooms across the hall--as if haunted by
a feeling of having forgotten something--or stopping to poke nervously at his perroquets, which
he had bequeathed to Hartwell, gilt cage and all. Our host himself sat on the couch, his big,
bronze-like shoulders backed up against the window, his shaggy head, beaked nose, and long
chin cut clean against the gray light.

Our drowsing interest, in so far as it could be said to be fixed upon anything, was centered
upon Hartwell's new figure, which stood on the block ready to be cast in bronze, intended as
a monument for some American battlefield. He called it "The Color Sergeant." It was the figure
of a young soldier running, clutching the folds of a flag, the staff of which had been shot
away. We had known it in all the stages of its growth, and the splendid action and feeling
of the thing had come to have a kind of special significance for the half dozen of us who often
gathered at Hartwell's rooms--though, in truth, there was as much to dishearten one as to inflame,
in the case of a man who had done so much in a field so amazingly difficult; who had thrown
up in bronze all the restless, teeming force of that adventurous wave still climbing westward
in our own land across the waters. We recalled his "Scout," his "Pioneer," his "Gold Seekers,"
and those monuments in which he had invested one and another of the heroes of the Civil War
with such convincing dignity and power.

"Where in the world does he get the heat to make an idea like that carry?" Bentley remarked
morosely, scowling at the clay figure. "Hang me, Hartwell, if I don't think it's just because
you're not really an American at all, that you can look at it like that."

The big man shifted uneasily against the window. "Yes," he replied smiling, "perhaps there
is something in that. My citizenship was somewhat belated and emotional in its flowering. I've
half a mind to tell you about it, Bentley." He rose uncertainly, and, after hesitating a moment,
went back into his workroom, where he began fumbling among the litter in the corners.

At the prospect of any sort of personal expression from Hartwell, we glanced questioningly
at one another; for although he made us feel that he liked to have us about, we were always
held at a distance by a certain diffidence of his. There were rare occasions--when he was in
the heat of work or of ideas--when he forgot to be shy, but they were so exceptional that no
flattery was quite so seductive as being taken for a moment into Hartwell's confidence. Even
in the matter of opinions--the commonest of currency in our circle--he was niggardly and prone
to qualify. No man ever guarded his mystery more effectually. There was a singular, intense
spell, therefore, about those few evenings when he had broken through this excessive modesty,
or shyness, or melancholy, and had, as it were, committed himself.

When Hartwell returned from the back room, he brought with him an unframed canvas which he
put on an easel near his clay figure. We drew close about it, for the darkness was rapidly
coming on. Despite the dullness of the light, we instantly recognized the boy of Hartwell's
"Color Sergeant." It was the portrait of a very handsome lad in uniform, standing beside a
charger impossibly rearing. Not only in his radiant countenance and flashing eyes, but in every
line of his young body there was an energy, a gallantry, a joy of life, that arrested and challenged
one.

"Yes, that's where I got the notion," Hartwell remarked, wandering back to his seat in the
window. "I've wanted to do it for years, but I've never felt quite sure of myself. I was afraid
of missing it. He was an uncle of mine, my father's half-brother, and I was named for him.
He was killed in one of the big battles of Sixty-four, when I was a child. I never saw him--never
knew him until he had been dead for twenty years. And then, one night, I came to know him as
we sometimes do living persons--intimately, in a single moment."

He paused to knock the ashes out of his short pipe, refilled it, and puffed at it thoughtfully
for a few moments with his hands on his knees. Then, settling back heavily among the cushions
and looking absently out of the window, he began his story. As he proceeded further and further
into the experience which he was trying to convey to us, his voice sank so low and was sometimes
so charged with feeling, that I almost thought he had forgotten our presence and was remembering
aloud. Even Bentley forgot his nervousness in astonishment and sat breathless under the spell
of the man's thus breathing his memories out into the dusk.

"It was just fifteen years ago this last spring that I first went home, and Bentley's having
to cut away like this brings it all back to me.

"I was born, you know, in Italy. My father was a sculptor, though I dare say you've not heard
of him. He was one of those first fellows who went over after Story and Powers,--went to Italy
for 'Art,' quite simply; to lift from its native bough the willing, iridescent bird. Their
story is told, informingly enough, by some of those ingenuous marble things at the Metropolitan.
My father came over some time before the outbreak of the Civil War, and was regarded as a renegade
by his family because he did not go home to enter the army. His half-brother, the only child
of my grandfather's second marriage, enlisted at fifteen and was killed the next year. I was
ten years old when the news of his death reached us. My mother died the following winter, and
I was sent away to a Jesuit school, while my father, already ill himself, stayed on at Rome,
chipping away at his Indian maidens and marble goddesses, still gloomily seeking the thing
for which he had made himself the most unhappy of exiles.

"He died when I was fourteen, but even before that I had been put to work under an Italian
sculptor. He had an almost morbid desire that I should carry on his work, under, as he often
pointed out to me, conditions so much more auspicious. He left me in the charge of his one
intimate friend, an American gentleman in the consulate at Rome, and his instructions were
that I was to be educated there and to live there until I was twenty-one. After I was of age,
I came to Paris and studied under one master after another until I was nearly thirty. Then,
almost for the first time, I was confronted by a duty which was not my pleasure.

"My grandfather's death, at an advanced age, left an invalid maiden sister of my father's quite
alone in the world. She had suffered for years from a cerebral disease, a slow decay of the
faculties which rendered her almost helpless. I decided to go to America and, if possible,
bring her back to Paris, where I seemed on my way toward what my poor father had wished for me.

"On my arrival at my father's birthplace, however, I found that this was not to be thought
of. To tear this timid, feeble, shrinking creature, doubly aged by years and illness, from
the spot where she had been rooted for a lifetime, would have been little short of brutality.
To leave her to the care of strangers seemed equally heartless. There was clearly nothing for
me to do but to remain and wait for that slow and painless malady to run its course. I was
there something over two years.

"My grandfather's home, his father's homestead before him, lay on the high banks of a river
in Western Pennsylvania. The little town twelve miles down the stream, whither my great-grandfather
used to drive his ox-wagon on market days, had become, in two generations, one of the largest
manufacturing cities in the world. For hundreds of miles about us the gentle hill slopes were
honeycombed with gas wells and coal shafts; oil derricks creaked in every valley and meadow;
the brooks were sluggish and discolored with crude petroleum, and the air was impregnated by
its searching odor. The great glass and iron manufactories had come up and up the river almost
to our very door; their smoky exhalations brooded over us, and their crashing was always in
our ears. I was plunged into the very incandescence of human energy. But, though my nerves
tingled with the feverish, passionate endeavor which snapped in the very air about me, none
of these great arteries seemed to feed me; this tumultuous life did not warm me. On every side
were the great muddy rivers, the ragged mountains from which the timber was being ruthlessly
torn away, the vast tracts of wild country, and the gulches that were like wounds in the earth;
everywhere the glare of that relentless energy which followed me like a searchlight and seemed
to scorch and consume me. I could only hide myself in the tangled garden, where the dropping
of a leaf or the whistle of a bird was the only incident.

"The Hartwell homestead had been sold away little by little, until all that remained of it
was garden and orchard. The house, a square brick structure, stood in the midst of a great
garden which sloped toward the river, ending in a grassy bank which fell some forty feet to
the water's edge. The garden was now little more than a tangle of neglected shrubbery; damp,
rank, and of that intense blue-green peculiar to vegetation in smoky places where the sun shines
but rarely, and the mists form early in the evening and hang late in the morning.

"I shall never forget it as I saw it first, when I arrived there in the chill of a backward
June. The long, rank grass, thick and soft and falling in billows, was always wet until midday.
The gravel walks were bordered with great lilac-bushes, mock-orange, and bridal-wreath. Back
of the house was a neglected rose garden, surrounded by a low stone wall over which the long
suckers trailed and matted. They had wound their pink, thorny tentacles, layer upon layer,
about the lock and the hinges of the rusty iron gate. Even the porches of the house, and the
very windows, were damp and heavy with growth: wistaria, clematis, honeysuckle, and trumpet
vine. The garden was grown up with trees, especially that part of it which lay above the river.
The bark of the old locusts was blackened by the smoke that crept continually up the valley,
and their feathery foliage, so merry in its movement and so yellow and joyous in its color,
seemed peculiarly precious under that somber sky. There were sycamores and copper beeches;
gnarled apple-trees, too old to bear; and fall pear-trees, hung with a sharp, hard fruit in
October; all with a leafage singularly rich and luxuriant, and peculiarly vivid in color. The
oaks about the house had been old trees when my great-grandfather built his cabin there, more
than a century before, and this garden was almost the only spot for miles along the river where
any of the original forest growth still survived. The smoke from the mills was fatal to trees
of the larger sort, and even these had the look of doomed things--bent a little toward the
town and seemed to wait with head inclined before that on-coming, shrieking force.

"About the river, too, there was a strange hush, a tragic submission--it was so leaden and
sullen in its color, and it flowed so soundlessly forever past our door.

"I sat there every evening, on the high veranda overlooking it, watching the dim outlines of
the steep hills on the other shore, the flicker of the lights on the island, where there was
a boat-house, and listening to the call of the boatmen through the mist. The mist came as certainly
as night, whitened by moonshine or starshine. The tin water-pipes went splash, splash, with
it all evening, and the wind, when it rose at all, was little more than a sighing of the old
boughs and a troubled breath in the heavy grasses.

"At first it was to think of my distant friends and my old life that I used to sit there; but
after awhile it was simply to watch the days and weeks go by, like the river which seemed to
carry them away.

"Within the house I was never at home. Month followed month, and yet I could feel no sense
of kinship with anything there. Under the roof where my father and grandfather were born, I
remained utterly detached. The somber rooms never spoke to me, the old furniture never seemed
tinctured with race. This portrait of my boy uncle was the only thing to which I could draw
near, the only link with anything I had ever known before.

"There is a good deal of my father in the face, but it is my father transformed and glorified;
his hesitating discontent drowned in a kind of triumph. From my first day in that house, I
continually turned to this handsome kinsman of mine, wondering in what terms he had lived and
had his hope; what he had found there to look like that, to bound at one, after all those years,
so joyously out of the canvas.

"From the timid, clouded old woman over whose life I had come to watch, I learned that in the
backyard, near the old rose garden, there was a locust-tree which my uncle had planted. After
his death, while it was still a slender sapling, his mother had a seat built round it, and
she used to sit there on summer evenings. His grave was under the apple-trees in the old orchard.

"My aunt could tell me little more than this. There were days when she seemed not to remember
him at all.

"It was from an old soldier in the village that I learned the boy's story. Lyon was, the old
man told me, but fourteen when the first enlistment occurred, but was even then eager to go.
He was in the court-house square every evening to watch the recruits at their drill, and when
the home company was ordered off he rode into the city on his pony to see the men board the
train and to wave them good-by. The next year he spent at home with a tutor, but when he was
fifteen he held his parents to their promise and went into the army. He was color sergeant
of his regiment and fell in a charge upon the breastworks of a fort about a year after his
enlistment.

"The veteran showed me an account of this charge which had been written for the village paper
by one of my uncle's comrades who had seen his part in the engagement. It seems that as his
company were running at full speed across the bottom lands toward the fortified hill, a shell
burst over them. This comrade, running beside my uncle, saw the colors waver and sink as if
falling, and looked to see that the boy's hand and forearm had been torn away by the exploding
shrapnel. The boy, he thought, did not realize the extent of his injury, for he laughed, shouted
something which his comrade did not catch, caught the flag in his left hand, and ran on up
the hill. They went splendidly up over the breastworks, but just as my uncle, his colors flying,
reached the top of the embankment, a second shell carried away his left arm at the arm-pit,
and he fell over the wall with the flag settling about him.

"It was because this story was ever present with me, because I was unable to shake it off,
that I began to read such books as my grandfather had collected upon the Civil War. I found
that this war was fought largely by boys, that more men enlisted at eighteen than at any other
age. When I thought of those battlefields--and I thought of them much in those days--there
was always that glory of youth above them, that impetuous, generous passion stirring the long
lines on the march, the blue battalions in the plain. The bugle, whenever I have heard it since,
has always seemed to me the very golden throat of that boyhood which spent itself so gaily,
so incredibly.

"I used often to wonder how it was that this uncle of mine, who seemed to have possessed all
the charm and brilliancy allotted to his family and to have lived up its vitality in one splendid
hour, had left so little trace in the house where he was born and where he had awaited his
destiny. Look as I would, I could find no letters from him, no clothing or books that might
have been his. He had been dead but twenty years, and yet nothing seemed to have survived except
the tree he had planted. It seemed incredible and cruel that no physical memory of him should
linger to be cherished among his kindred,--nothing but the dull image in the brain of that
aged sister. I used to pace the garden walks in the evening, wondering that no breath of his,
no echo of his laugh, of his call to his pony or his whistle to his dogs, should linger about
those shaded paths where the pale roses exhaled their dewy, country smell. Sometimes, in the
dim starlight, I have thought that I heard on the grasses beside me the stir of a footfall
lighter than my own, and under the black arch of the lilacs I have fancied that he bore me company.

"There was, I found, one day in the year for which my old aunt waited, and which stood out
from the months that were all of a sameness to her. On the thirtieth of May she insisted that
I should bring down the big flag from the attic and run it up upon the tall flagstaff beside
Lyon's tree in the garden. Embrasures may be made either direct or oblique, according as the fire
is required to be perpendicular or oblique to the parapet.

A coverport is a small outwork of any convenient form, erected immediately in front of a gateway,
to screen it from the enemy's fire.

A counterguard is a more extensive work, constructed in front of a part of the fortress itself,
or of some other outwork of greater importance, which it is intended to cover. These are sometimes
called coverfaces, from their situation and object; but the former term is most commonly used.

Sometimes
outworks, called tenaillons, consisting of one long and one short face, are placed on each side
of the demi-lune of a front of fortification, for the purpose of prolonging the siege. (Fig. 41.)

Small,
or demi-tenaillons, are frequently so arranged as to cover only one-half
of the demi-lune, and then a bonnet constructed in front of the salient
of the demi-lune.

  (Fig.42.) In this case the bonnet is flanked by the short faces of
the demi-tenaillons; these short faces are themselves flanked by the
demi-lune, while the bastions flank the long faces.

A horn-work consists of a front of fortification, and two wings resting on the faces of bastions of
a front of the fortress. It sometimes has also a demi-lune or bonnet, as in the case of demi-tenaillons.
(Fig. 43.)

  A crown-work consists of two fronts of fortification,
  and two wings. (Fig. 44.) It is sometimes made double, and even triple.

These

works are also employed as advanced works, and placed entirely in front of the glacis. They
have generally been added to a fortress for the purpose of occupying some important piece of
ground not included within the limits of the main work.

They may be constructed with covered ways, and sometimes it may be found advantageous to secure them
by retrenchments.

A detached work may be made in any form deemed best suited to the site. Being but remotely connected
with the fortress, the latter will exercise but slight influence on the character of its plan
or construction.

They are usually of limited extent and slight relief, partaking much of the nature of field-works.[45]

[Footnote
45: The general principles of permanent fortification may be best learned from the writings
of Cormontaigne, St. Paul de Noizet, and Laurillard-Fallot. A list of valuable books of reference
on the several branches of military engineering will be given at the close of the next chapter.]

CHAPTER
XIV.

FIELD-ENGINEERING.

Field-Engineering includes the making of military reconnaissances,
temporary fortifications, and military roads; the planning and construction
of military bridges; the attack and defence of military works;--in
fine, all the various duties of engineer troops, either in the operations
of a campaign, or in the dispositions on the battle-field.

Military reconnaissance.--By this term is meant an examination of
a portion of the theatre of war, to ascertain its military character
and resources. If the examination be made of a large district of country,
and for an entire campaign, the reconnaissance is general; if made
for collecting detailed information respecting a proposed line of
march, the passage of a river, the position of an enemy, &c., it is
termed special. It was the same feeling that artists know when we, rarely, achieve truth in our work;
the feeling of union with some great force, of purpose and security, of being glad that we
have lived. For the first time I felt the pull of race and blood and kindred, and felt beating
within me things that had not begun with me. It was as if the earth under my feet had grasped
and rooted me, and were pouring its essence into me. I sat there until the dawn of morning,
and all night long my life seemed to be pouring out of me and running into the ground."

Hartwell drew a long breath that lifted his heavy shoulders, and then let them fall again.
He shifted a little and faced more squarely the scattered, silent company before him. The darkness
had made us almost invisible to each other, and, except for the occasional red circuit of a
cigarette end traveling upward from the arm of a chair, he might have supposed us all asleep.

"And so," Hartwell added thoughtfully, "I naturally feel an interest in fellows who are going
home. It's always an experience."

No one said anything, and in a moment there was a loud rap at the door,--the concierge, come
to take down Bentley's luggage and to announce that the cab was below. Bentley got his hat
and coat, enjoined Hartwell to take good care of his perroquets, gave each of us a grip of
the hand, and went briskly down the long flights of stairs. We followed him into the street,
calling our good wishes, and saw him start on his drive across the lighted city to the Gare
St. Lazare.

The Joy of Nelly Deane

Nell and I were almost ready to go on for the last act of "Queen Esther," and we had for the
moment got rid of our three patient dressers, Mrs. Dow, Mrs. Freeze, and Mrs. Spinny. Nell
was peering over my shoulder into the little cracked looking-glass that Mrs. Dow had taken
from its nail on her kitchen wall and brought down to the church under her shawl that morning.
When she realized that we were alone, Nell whispered to me in the quick, fierce way she had:

"Say, Peggy, won't you go up and stay with me to-night? Scott Spinny's asked to take me home,
and I don't want to walk up with him alone."

"I guess so, if you'll ask my mother."

"Oh, I'll fix her!" Nell laughed, with a toss of her head which meant that she usually got
what she wanted, even from people much less tractable than my mother.

In a moment our tiring-women were back again. The three old ladies--at least they seemed old
to us--fluttered about us, more agitated than we were ourselves. It seemed as though they would
never leave off patting Nell and touching her up. They kept trying things this way and that,
never able in the end to decide which way was best. They wouldn't hear to her using rouge,
and as they powdered her neck and arms, Mrs. Freeze murmured that she hoped we wouldn't get
into the habit of using such things. Mrs. Spinny divided her time between pulling up and tucking
down the "illusion" that filled in the square neck of Nelly's dress. She didn't like things
much low, she said; but after she had pulled it up, she stood back and looked at Nell thoughtfully
through her glasses. While the excited girl was reaching for this and that, buttoning a slipper,
pinning down a curl, Mrs. Spinny's smile softened more and more until, just before Esther made
her entrance, the old lady tiptoed up to her and softly tucked the illusion down as far as
it would go.

"She's so pink; it seems a pity not," she whispered apologetically to Mrs. Dow.

Every one admitted that Nelly was the prettiest girl in Riverbend, and the gayest--oh, the
gayest! When she was not singing, she was laughing. When she was not laid up with a broken
arm, the outcome of a foolhardy coasting feat, or suspended from school because she ran away
at recess to go buggy-riding with Guy Franklin, she was sure to be up to mischief of some sort.
Twice she broke through the ice and got soused in the river because she never looked where
she skated or cared what happened so long as she went fast enough. After the second of these
duckings our three dressers declared that she was trying to be a Baptist despite herself.

Mrs. Spinny and Mrs. Freeze and Mrs. Dow, who were always hovering about Nelly, often whispered
to me their hope that she would eventually come into our church and not "go with the Methodists";
her family were Wesleyans. But to me these artless plans of theirs never wholly explained their
watchful affection. They had good daughters themselves,--except Mrs. Spinny, who had only the
sullen Scott,--and they loved their plain girls and thanked God for them. But they loved Nelly
differently. They were proud of her pretty figure and yellow-brown eyes, which dilated so easily
and sparkled with a kind of golden effervescence. They were always making pretty things for
her, always coaxing her to come to the sewing-circle, where she knotted her thread, and put
in the wrong sleeve, and laughed and chattered and said a great many things that she should
not have said, and somehow always warmed their hearts. I think they loved her for her unquenchable
joy.

All the Baptist ladies liked Nell, even those who criticized her most severely, but the three
who were first in fighting the battles of our little church, who held it together by their
prayers and the labor of their hands, watched over her as they did over Mrs. Dow's century-plant
before it blossomed. They looked for her on Sunday morning and smiled at her as she hurried,
always a little late, up to the choir. When she rose and stood behind the organ and sang "There
Is a Green Hill," one could see Mrs. Dow and Mrs. Freeze settle back in their accustomed seats
and look up at her as if she had just come from that hill and had brought them glad tidings.

It was because I sang contralto, or, as we said, alto, in the Baptist choir that Nell and I
became friends. She was so gay and grown up, so busy with parties and dances and picnics, that
I would scarcely have seen much of her had we not sung together. She liked me better than she
did any of the older girls, who tried clumsily to be like her, and I felt almost as solicitous
and admiring as did Mrs. Dow and Mrs. Spinny. I think even then I must have loved to see her
bloom and glow, and I loved to hear her sing, in "The Ninety and Nine,"

  But one was out on the hills away

in her sweet, strong voice. Nell had never had a singing lesson, but she had sung from the
time she could talk, and Mrs. Dow used fondly to say that it was singing so much that made
her figure so pretty.

After I went into the choir it was found to be easier to get Nelly to choir practice. If I
stopped outside her gate on my way to church and coaxed her, she usually laughed, ran in for
her hat and jacket, and went along with me. The three old ladies fostered our friendship, and
because I was "quiet," they esteemed me a good influence for Nelly. This view was propounded
in a sewing-circle discussion and, leaking down to us through our mothers, greatly amused us.
Dear old ladies! It was so manifestly for what Nell was that they loved her, and yet they were
always looking for "influences" to change her.

The "Queen Esther" performance had cost us three months of hard practice, and it was not easy
to keep Nell up to attending the tedious rehearsals. Some of the boys we knew were in the chorus
of Assyrian youths, but the solo cast was made up of older people, and Nell found them very
poky. We gave the cantata in the Baptist church on Christmas eve, "to a crowded house," as
the Riverbend "Messenger" truly chronicled. The country folk for miles about had come in through
a deep snow, and their teams and wagons stood in a long row at the hitch-bars on each side
of the church door. It was certainly Nelly's night, for however much the tenor--he was her
schoolmaster, and naturally thought poorly of her--might try to eclipse her in his dolorous
solos about the rivers of Babylon, there could be no doubt as to whom the people had come to
hear--and to see.

After the performance was over, our fathers and mothers came back to the dressing-rooms--the
little rooms behind the baptistry where the candidates for baptism were robed--to congratulate
us, and Nell persuaded my mother to let me go home with her. This arrangement may not have
been wholly agreeable to Scott Spinny, who stood glumly waiting at the baptistry door; though
I used to think he dogged Nell's steps not so much for any pleasure he got from being with
her as for the pleasure of keeping other people away. Dear little Mrs. Spinny was perpetually
in a state of humiliation on account of his bad manners, and she tried by a very special tenderness
to make up to Nelly for the remissness of her ungracious son.

Scott was a spare, muscular fellow, good-looking, but with a face so set and dark that I used
to think it very like the castings he sold. He was taciturn and domineering, and Nell rather
liked to provoke him. Her father was so easy with her that she seemed to enjoy being ordered
about now and then. That night, when every one was praising her and telling her how well she
sang and how pretty she looked, Scott only said, as we came out of the dressing-room:

"Have you got your high shoes on?"

"No; but I've got rubbers on over my low ones. Mother doesn't care."

"Well, you just go back and put 'em on as fast as you can."

Nell made a face at him and ran back, laughing. Her mother, fat, comfortable Mrs. Deane, was
immensely amused at this.

"That's right, Scott," she chuckled. "You can do enough more with her than I can. She walks
right over me an' Jud."

Scott grinned. If he was proud of Nelly, the last thing he wished to do was to show it. When
she came back he began to nag again. "What are you going to do with all those flowers? They'll
freeze stiff as pokers."

"Well, there won't none of your flowers freeze, Scott Spinny, so there!" Nell snapped. She
had the best of him that time, and the Assyrian youths rejoiced. They were most of them high-school
boys, and the poorest of them had "chipped in" and sent all the way to Denver for Queen Esther's
flowers. There were bouquets from half a dozen townspeople, too, but none from Scott. Scott
was a prosperous hardware merchant and notoriously penurious, though he saved his face, as
the boys said, by giving liberally to the church.

"There's no use freezing the fool things, anyhow. You get me some newspapers, and I'll wrap
'em up." Scott took from his pocket a folded copy of the Riverbend "Messenger" and began laboriously
to wrap up one of the bouquets. When we left the church door he bore three large newspaper
bundles, carrying them as carefully as if they had been so many newly frosted wedding-cakes,
and left Nell and me to shift for ourselves as we floundered along the snow-burdened sidewalk.

Although it was after midnight, lights were shining from many of the little wooden houses,
and the roofs and shrubbery were so deep in snow that Riverbend looked as if it had been tucked
down into a warm bed. The companies of people, all coming from church, tramping this way and
that toward their homes and calling "Good night" and "Merry Christmas" as they parted company,
all seemed to us very unusual and exciting.

When we got home, Mrs. Deane had a cold supper ready, and Jud Deane had already taken off his
shoes and fallen to on his fried chicken and pie. He was so proud of his pretty daughter that
he must give her her Christmas presents then and there, and he went into the sleeping-chamber
behind the dining-room and from the depths of his wife's closet brought out a short sealskin
jacket and a round cap and made Nelly put them on.

Mrs. Deane, who sat busy between a plate of spice cake and a tray piled with her famous whipped-cream
tarts, laughed inordinately at his behavior.

"Ain't he worse than any kid you ever see? He's been running to that closet like a cat shut
away from her kittens. I wonder Nell ain't caught on before this. I did think he'd make out
now to keep 'em till Christmas morning; but he's never made out to keep anything yet."

That was true enough, and fortunately Jud's inability to keep anything seemed always to present
a highly humorous aspect to his wife. Mrs. Deane put her heart into her cooking, and said that
so long as a man was a good provider she had no cause to complain. Other people were not so
charitable toward Jud's failing. I remember how many strictures were passed upon that little
sealskin and how he was censured for his extravagance. But what a public-spirited thing, after
all, it was for him to do! How, the winter through, we all enjoyed seeing Nell skating on the
river or running about the town with the brown collar turned up about her bright cheeks and
her hair blowing out from under the round cap! "No seal," Mrs. Dow said, "would have begrudged
it to her. Why should we?" This was at the sewing-circle, when the new coat was under grave
discussion.

At last Nelly and I got up-stairs and undressed, and the pad of Jud's slippered feet about
the kitchen premises--where he was carrying up from the cellar things that might freeze--ceased.
He called "Good night, daughter," from the foot of the stairs, and the house grew quiet. But
one is not a prima donna the first time for nothing, and it seemed as if we could not go to
bed. Our light must have burned long after every other in Riverbend was out. The muslin curtains
of Nell's bed were drawn back; Mrs. Deane had turned down the white counterpane and taken off
the shams and smoothed the pillows for us. But their fair plumpness offered no temptation to
two such hot young heads. We could not let go of life even for a little while. We sat and talked
in Nell's cozy room, where there was a tiny, white fur rug--the only one in Riverbend--before
the bed; and there were white sash curtains, and the prettiest little desk and dressing-table
I had ever seen. It was a warm, gay little room, flooded all day long with sunlight from east
and south windows that had climbing-roses all about them in summer. About the dresser were
photographs of adoring high-school boys; and one of Guy Franklin, much groomed and barbered,
in a dress-coat and a boutonnière. I never liked to see that photograph there. The home boys
looked properly modest and bashful on the dresser, but he seemed to be staring impudently all
the time.

I knew nothing definite against Guy, but in Riverbend all "traveling-men" were considered worldly
and wicked. He traveled for a Chicago dry-goods firm, and our fathers didn't like him because
he put extravagant ideas into our mothers' heads. He had very smooth and nattering ways, and
he introduced into our simple community a great variety of perfumes and scented soaps, and
he always reminded me of the merchants in Cæsar, who brought into Gaul "those things which
effeminate the mind," as we translated that delightfully easy passage.

Nell was silting before the dressing-table in her nightgown, holding the new fur coat and rubbing
her cheek against it, when I saw a sudden gleam of tears in her eyes. "You know, Peggy," she
said in her quick, impetuous way, "this makes me feel bad. I've got a secret from my daddy."

I can see her now, so pink and eager, her brown hair in two springy braids down her back, and
her eyes shining with tears and with something even softer and more tremulous.

"I'm engaged, Peggy," she whispered, "really and truly."

She leaned forward, unbuttoning her nightgown, and there on her breast, hung by a little gold
chain about her neck, was a diamond ring--Guy Franklin's solitaire; every one in Riverbend
knew it well.

"I'm going to live in Chicago, and take singing lessons, and go to operas, and do all those
nice things--oh, everything! I know you don't like him, Peggy, but you know you are a kid.
You'll see how it is yourself when you grow up. He's so different from our boys, and he's just
terribly in love with me. And then, Peggy,"--flushing all down over her soft shoulders,--"I'm
awfully fond of him, too. Awfully."

"Are you, Nell, truly?" I whispered. She seemed so changed to me by the warm light in her eyes
and that delicate suffusion of color. I felt as I did when I got up early on picnic mornings
in summer, and saw the dawn come up in the breathless sky above the river meadows and make
all the cornfields golden.

"Sure I do, Peggy; don't look so solemn. It's nothing to look that way about, kid. It's nice."
She threw her arms about me suddenly and hugged me.

"I hate to think about your going so far away from us all, Nell."

"Oh, you'll love to come and visit me. Just you wait."

She began breathlessly to go over things Guy Franklin had told her about Chicago, until I seemed
to see it all looming up out there under the stars that kept watch over our little sleeping
town. We had neither of us ever been to a city, but we knew what it would be like. We heard
it throbbing like great engines, and calling to us, that far-away world. Even after we had
opened the windows and scurried into bed, we seemed to feel a pulsation across all the miles
of snow. The winter silence trembled with it, and the air was full of something new that seemed
to break over us in soft waves. In that snug, warm little bed I had a sense of imminent change
and danger. I was somehow afraid for Nelly when I heard her breathing so quickly beside me,
and I put my arm about her protectingly as we drifted toward sleep.

       *       *       *       *       *

In the following spring we were both graduated from the Riverbend high school, and I went away
to college. My family moved to Denver, and during the next four years I heard very little of
Nelly Deane. My life was crowded with new people and new experiences, and I am afraid I held
her little in mind. I heard indirectly that Jud Deane had lost what little property he owned
in a luckless venture in Cripple Creek, and that he had been able to keep his house in Riverbend
only through the clemency of his creditors. Guy Franklin had his route changed and did not
go to Riverbend any more. He married the daughter of a rich cattle-man out near Long Pine,
and ran a dry-goods store of his own. Mrs. Dow wrote me a long letter about once a year, and
in one of these she told me that Nelly was teaching in the sixth grade in the Riverbend school.

"Dear Nelly does not like teaching very well. The children try her, and she is so pretty it
seems a pity for her to be tied down to uncongenial employment. Scott is still very attentive,
and I have noticed him look up at the window of Nelly's room in a very determined way as he
goes home to dinner. Scott continues prosperous; he has made money during these hard times
and now owns both our hardware stores. He is close, but a very honorable fellow. Nelly seems
to hold off, but I think Mrs. Spinny has hopes. Nothing would please her more. If Scott were
more careful about his appearance, it would help. He of course gets black about his business,
and Nelly, you know, is very dainty. People do say his mother does his courting for him, she
is so eager. If only Scott does not turn out hard and penurious like his father! We must all
have our schooling in this life, but I don't want Nelly's to be too severe. She is a dear girl,
and keeps her color."

Mrs. Dow's own schooling had been none too easy. Her husband had long been crippled with rheumatism,
and was bitter and faultfinding. Her daughters had married poorly, and one of her sons had
fallen into evil ways. But her letters were always cheerful, and in one of them she gently
remonstrated with me because I "seemed inclined to take a sad view of life."

In the winter vacation of my senior year I stopped on my way home to visit Mrs. Dow. The first
thing she told me when I got into her old buckboard at the station was that "Scott had at last
prevailed," and that Nelly was to marry him in the spring. As a preliminary step, Nelly was
about to join the Baptist church. "Just think, you will be here for her baptizing! How that
will please Nelly! She is to be immersed to-morrow night."

I met Scott Spinny in the post-office that morning, and he gave me a hard grip with one black
hand. There was something grim and saturnine about his powerful body and bearded face and his
strong, cold hands. I wondered what perverse fate had driven him for eight years to dog the
footsteps of a girl whose charm was due to qualities naturally distasteful to him. It still
seems strange to me that in easy-going Riverbend, where there were so many boys who could have
lived contentedly enough with my little grasshopper, it was the pushing ant who must have her
and all her careless ways.

By a kind of unformulated etiquette one did not call upon candidates for baptism on the day
of the ceremony, so I had my first glimpse of Nelly that evening. The baptistry was a cemented
pit directly under the pulpit rostrum, over which we had our stage when we sang "Queen Esther."
I sat through the sermon somewhat nervously. After the minister, in his long, black gown, had
gone down into the water and the choir had finished singing, the door from the dressing-room
opened, and, led by one of the deacons, Nelly came down the steps into the pool. Oh, she looked
so little and meek and chastened! Her white cashmere robe clung about her, and her brown hair
was brushed straight back and hung in two soft braids from a little head bent humbly. As she
stepped down into the water I shivered with the cold of it, and I remembered sharply how much
I had loved her. She went down until the water was well above her waist, and stood white and
small, with her hands crossed on her breast, while the minister said the words about being
buried with Christ in baptism. Then, lying in his arm, she disappeared under the dark water.
"It will be like that when she dies," I thought, and a quick pain caught my heart. The choir
began to sing "Washed in the Blood of the Lamb" as she rose again, the door behind the baptistry
opened, revealing those three dear guardians, Mrs. Dow, Mrs. Freeze, and Mrs. Spinny, and she
went up into their arms.

I went to see Nell next day, up in the little room of many memories. Such a sad, sad visit!
She seemed changed--a little embarrassed and quietly despairing. We talked of many of the old
Riverbend girls and boys, but she did not mention Guy Franklin or Scott Spinny, except to say
that her father had got work in Scott's hardware store. She begged me, putting her hands on
my shoulders with something of her old impulsiveness, to come and stay a few days with her.
But I was afraid--afraid of what she might tell me and of what I might say. When I sat in that
room with all her trinkets, the foolish harvest of her girlhood, lying about, and the white
curtains and the little white rug, I thought of Scott Spinny with positive terror and could
feel his hard grip on my hand again. I made the best excuse I could about having to hurry on
to Denver; but she gave me one quick look, and her eyes ceased to plead. I saw that she understood
me perfectly. We had known each other so well. Just once, when I got up to go and had trouble
with my veil, she laughed her old merry laugh and told me there were some things I would never
learn, for all my schooling.

The next day, when Mrs. Dow drove me down to the station to catch the morning train for Denver,
I saw Nelly hurrying to school with several books under her arm. She had been working up her
lessons at home, I thought. She was never quick at her books, dear Nell.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was ten years before I again visited Riverbend. I had been in Rome for a long time, and
had fallen into bitter homesickness. One morning, sitting among the dahlias and asters that
bloom so bravely upon those gigantic heaps of earth-red ruins that were once the palaces of
the Cæsars, I broke the seal of one of Mrs. Dow's long yearly letters. It brought so much sad
news that I resolved then and there to go home to Riverbend, the only place that had ever really
been home to me. Mrs. Dow wrote me that her husband, after years of illness, had died in the
cold spell last March. "So good and patient toward the last," she wrote, "and so afraid of
giving extra trouble." There was another thing she saved until the last. She wrote on and on,
dear woman, about new babies and village improvements, as if she could not bear to tell me;
and then it came:

"You will be sad to hear that two months ago our dear Nelly left us. It was a terrible blow
to us all. I cannot write about it yet, I fear. I wake up every morning feeling that I ought
to go to her. She went three days after her little boy was born. The baby is a fine child and
will live, I think, in spite of everything. He and her little girl, now eight years old, whom
she named Margaret, after you, have gone to Mrs. Spinny's. She loves them more than if they
were her own. It seems as if already they had made her quite young again. I wish you could
see Nelly's children."

Ah, that was what I wanted, to see Nelly's children! The wish came aching from my heart along
with the bitter homesick tears; along with a quick, torturing recollection that flashed upon
me, as I looked about and tried to collect myself, of how we two had sat in our sunny seat
in the corner of the old bare school-room one September afternoon and learned the names of
the seven hills together. In that place, at that moment, after so many years, how it all came
back to me--the warm sun on my back, the chattering girl beside me, the curly hair, the laughing
yellow eyes, the stubby little finger on the page! I felt as if even then, when we sat in the
sun with our heads together, it was all arranged, written out like a story, that at this moment
I should be sitting among the crumbling bricks and drying grass, and she should be lying in
the place I knew so well, on that green hill far away.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mrs. Dow sat with her Christmas sewing in the familiar sitting-room, where the carpet and the
wall-paper and the table-cover had all faded into soft, dull colors, and even the chromo of
Hagar and Ishmael had been toned to the sobriety of age. In the bay-window the tall wire flower-stand
still bore its little terraces of potted plants, and the big fuchsia and the Martha Washington
geranium had blossomed for Christmas-tide. Mrs. Dow herself did not look greatly changed to
me. Her hair, thin ever since I could remember it, was now quite white, but her spare, wiry
little person had all its old activity, and her eyes gleamed with the old friendliness behind
her silver-bowed glasses. Her gray house-dress seemed just like those she used to wear when
I ran in after school to take her angel-food cake down to the church supper.

The house sat on a hill, and from behind the geraniums I could see pretty much all of Riverbend,
tucked down in the soft snow, and the air above was full of big, loose flakes, falling from
a gray sky which betokened settled weather. Indoors the hard-coal burner made a tropical temperature,
and glowed a warm orange from its isinglass sides. We sat and visited, the two of us, with
a great sense of comfort and completeness. I had reached Riverbend only that morning, and Mrs.
Dow, who had been haunted by thoughts of shipwreck and suffering upon wintry seas, kept urging
me to draw nearer to the fire and suggesting incidental refreshment. We had chattered all through
the winter morning and most of the afternoon, taking up one after another of the Riverbend
girls and boys, and agreeing that we had reason to be well satisfied with most of them. Finally,
after a long pause in which I had listened to the contented ticking of the clock and the crackle
of the coal, I put the question I had until then held back:

"And now, Mrs. Dow, tell me about the one we loved best of all. Since I got your letter I've
thought of her every day. Tell me all about Scott and Nelly."

The tears flashed behind her glasses, and she smoothed the little pink bag on her knee.

"Well, dear, I'm afraid Scott proved to be a hard man, like his father. But we must remember
that Nelly always had Mrs. Spinny. I never saw anything like the love there was between those
two. After Nelly lost her own father and mother, she looked to Mrs. Spinny for everything.
When Scott was too unreasonable, his mother could 'most always prevail upon him. She never
lifted a hand to fight her own battles with Scott's father, but she was never afraid to speak
up for Nelly. And then Nelly took great comfort of her little girl. Such a lovely child!"

"Had she been very ill before the little baby came?"

"No, Margaret; I'm afraid 't was all because they had the wrong doctor. I feel confident that
either Doctor Tom or Doctor Jones could have brought her through. But, you see, Scott had offended
them both, and they'd stopped trading at his store, so he would have young Doctor Fox, a boy
just out of college and a stranger. He got scared and didn't know what to do. Mrs. Spinny felt
he wasn't doing right, so she sent for Mrs. Freeze and me. It seemed like Nelly had got discouraged.
Scott would move into their big new house before the plastering was dry, and though 't was
summer, she had taken a terrible cold that seemed to have drained her, and she took no interest
in fixing the place up. Mrs. Spinny had been down with her back again and wasn't able to help,
and things was just anyway. We won't talk about that, Margaret; I think 't would hurt Mrs.
Spinny to have you know. She nearly died of mortification when she sent for us, and blamed
her poor back. We did get Nelly fixed up nicely before she died. I prevailed upon Doctor Tom
to come in at the last, and it 'most broke his heart. 'Why, Mis' Dow,' he said, 'if you'd only
have come and told me how 't was, I'd have come and carried her right off in my arms.'"

"Oh, Mrs. Dow," I cried, "then it needn't have been?"

Mrs. Dow dropped her needle and clasped her hands quickly. "We mustn't look at it that way,
dear," she said tremulously and a little sternly; "we mustn't let ourselves. We must just feel
that our Lord wanted her then, and took her to Himself. When it was all over, she did look
so like a child of God, young and trusting, like she did on her baptizing night, you remember?"

I felt that Mrs. Dow did not want to talk any more about Nelly then, and, indeed, I had little
heart to listen; so I told her I would go for a walk, and suggested that I might stop at Mrs.
Spinny's to see the children.

Mrs. Dow looked up thoughtfully at the clock. "I doubt if you'll find little Margaret there
now. It's half-past four, and she'll have been out of school an hour and more. She'll be most
likely coasting on Lupton's Hill. She usually makes for it with her sled the minute she is
out of the school-house door. You know, it's the old hill where you all used to slide. If you
stop in at the church about six o'clock, you'll likely find Mrs. Spinny there with the baby.
I promised to go down and help Mrs. Freeze finish up the tree, and Mrs. Spinny said she'd run
in with the baby, if 't wasn't too bitter. She won't leave him alone with the Swede girl. She's
like a young woman with her first."

Lupton's Hill was at the other end of town, and when I got there the dusk was thickening, drawing
blue shadows over the snowy fields. There were perhaps twenty children creeping up the hill
or whizzing down the packed sled-track. When I had been watching them for some minutes, I heard
a lusty shout, and a little red sled shot past me into the deep snow-drift beyond. The child
was quite buried for a moment, then she struggled out and stood dusting the snow from her short
coat and red woolen comforter. She wore a brown fur cap, which was too big for her and of an
old-fashioned shape, such as girls wore long ago, but I would have known her without the cap.
Mrs. Dow had said a beautiful child, and there would not be two like this in Riverbend. She
was off before I had time to speak to her, going up the hill at a trot, her sturdy little legs
plowing through the trampled snow. When she reached the top she never paused to take breath,
but threw herself upon her sled and came down with a whoop that was quenched only by the deep
drift at the end.

"Are you Margaret Spinny?" I asked as she struggled out in a cloud of snow.

"Yes, 'm." She approached me with frank curiosity, pulling her little sled behind her. "Are
you the strange lady staying at Mrs. Dow's?" I nodded, and she began to look my clothes over
with respectful interest.

"Your grandmother is to be at the church at six o'clock, isn't she?"

"Yes, 'm."

"Well, suppose we walk up there now. It's nearly six, and all the other children are going
home." She hesitated, and looked up at the faintly gleaming track on the hill-slope. "Do you
want another slide? Is that it?" I asked.

"Do you mind?" she asked shyly.

"No. I'll wait for you. Take your time; don't run."

Two little boys were still hanging about the slide, and they cheered her as she came down,
her comforter streaming in the wind.

"Now," she announced, getting up out of the drift, "I'll show you where the church is."

"Shall I tie your comforter again?"

"No, 'm, thanks. I'm plenty warm." She put her mittened hand confidingly in mine and trudged
along beside me.

Mrs. Dow must have heard us tramping up the snowy steps of the church, for she met us at the
door. Every one had gone except the old ladies. A kerosene lamp flickered over the Sunday-school
chart, with the lesson-picture of the Wise Men, and the little barrel-stove threw out a deep
glow over the three white heads that bent above the baby. There the three friends sat, patting
him, and smoothing his dress, and playing with his hands, which made theirs look so brown.

"You ain't seen nothing finer in all your travels," said Mrs. Spinny, and they all laughed.

They showed me his full chest and how strong his back was; had me feel the golden fuzz on his
head, and made him look at me with his round, bright eyes. He laughed and reared himself in
my arms as I took him up and held him close to me. He was so warm and tingling with life, and
he had the flush of new beginnings, of the new morning and the new rose. He seemed to have
come so lately from his mother's heart! It was as if I held her youth and all her young joy.
As I put my cheek down against his, he spied a pink flower in my hat, and making a gleeful
sound, he lunged at it with both fists.

"Don't let him spoil it," murmured Mrs. Spinny. "He loves color so--like Nelly."

"I'm one o' Mis' Ericson's tenants. Look after one of her places. "Will you go with me to-night?"
"Not to-night," she whispered. "Sit here and talk to me to-night. I don't want to go anywhere
to-night.

                                        McClure's, August 1912

Consequences

Henry Eastman, a lawyer, aged forty, was standing beside the Flatiron building in a driving
November rainstorm, signaling frantically for a taxi. It was six-thirty, and everything on
wheels was engaged. The streets were in confusion about him, the sky was in turmoil above him,
and the Flatiron building, which seemed about to blow down, threw water like a mill-shoot.
Suddenly, out of the brutal struggle of men and cars and machines and people tilting at each
other with umbrellas, a quiet, well-mannered limousine paused before him, at the curb, and
an agreeable, ruddy countenance confronted him through the open window of the car.

"Don't you want me to pick you up, Mr. Eastman? I'm running directly home now."

Eastman recognized Kier Cavenaugh, a young man of pleasure, who lived in the house on Central
Park South, where he himself had an apartment.

"Don't I?" he exclaimed, bolting into the car. "I'll risk getting your cushions wet without
compunction. I came up in a taxi, but I didn't hold it. Bad economy. I thought I saw your car
down on Fourteenth Street about half an hour ago."

The owner of the car smiled. He had a pleasant, round face and round eyes, and a fringe of
smooth, yellow hair showed under the rim of his soft felt hat. "With a lot of little broilers
fluttering into it? You did. I know some girls who work in the cheap shops down there. I happened
to be down-town and I stopped and took a load of them home. I do sometimes. Saves their poor
little clothes, you know. Their shoes are never any good."

Eastman looked at his rescuer. "Aren't they notoriously afraid of cars and smooth young men?"
he inquired.

Cavenaugh shook his head. "They know which cars are safe and which are chancy. They put each
other wise. You have to take a bunch at a time, of course. The Italian girls can never come
along; their men shoot. The girls understand, all right; but their fathers don't. One gets
to see queer places, sometimes, taking them home."

Eastman laughed drily. "Every time I touch the circle of your acquaintance, Cavenaugh, it's
a little wider. You must know New York pretty well by this time."

"Yes, but I'm on my good behavior below Twenty-third Street," the young man replied with simplicity.
"My little friends down there would give me a good character. They're wise little girls. They
have grand ways with each other, a romantic code of loyalty. You can find a good many of the
lost virtues among them."

The car was standing still in a traffic block at Fortieth Street, when Cavenaugh suddenly drew
his face away from the window and touched Eastman's arm. "Look, please. You see that hansom
with the bony gray horse--driver has a broken hat and red flannel around his throat. Can you
see who is inside?"

Eastman peered out. The hansom was just cutting across the line, and the driver was making
a great fuss about it, bobbing his head and waving his whip. He jerked his dripping old horse
into Fortieth Street and clattered off past the Public Library grounds toward Sixth Avenue.
"No, I couldn't see the passenger. Someone you know?"

"Could you see whether there was a passenger?" Cavenaugh asked.

"Why, yes. A man, I think. I saw his elbow on the apron. No driver ever behaves like that unless
he has a passenger."

"Yes, I may have been mistaken," Cavenaugh murmured absent-mindedly. Ten minutes or so later,
after Cavenaugh's car had turned off Fifth Avenue into Fifty-eighth Street, Eastman exclaimed,
"There's your same cabby, and his cart's empty. He's headed for a drink now, I suppose." The
driver in the broken hat and the red flannel neck cloth was still brandishing the whip over
his old gray. He was coming from the west now, and turned down Sixth Avenue, under the elevated.

Cavenaugh's car stopped at the bachelor apartment house between Sixth and Seventh Avenues where
he and Eastman lived, and they went up in the elevator together. They were still talking when
the lift stopped at Cavenaugh's floor, and Eastman stepped out with him and walked down the
hall, finishing his sentence while Cavenaugh found his latch-key. When he opened the door,
a wave of fresh cigarette smoke greeted them. Cavenaugh stopped short and stared into his hallway.
"Now how in the devil--!" he exclaimed angrily.

"Someone waiting for you? Oh, no, thanks. I wasn't coming in. I have to work to-night. Thank
you, but I couldn't." Eastman nodded and went up the two flights to his own rooms.

Though Eastman did not customarily keep a servant he had this winter a man who had been lent
to him by a friend who was abroad. Rollins met him at the door and took his coat and hat.

"Put out my dinner clothes, Rollins, and then get out of here until ten o'clock. I've promised
to go to a supper to-night. I shan't be dining. I've had a late tea and I'm going to work until
ten. You may put out some kumiss and biscuit for me."

Rollins took himself off, and Eastman settled down at the big table in his sitting-room. He
had to read a lot of letters submitted as evidence in a breach of contract case, and before
he got very far he found that long paragraphs in some of the letters were written in German.
He had a German dictionary at his office, but none here. Rollins had gone, and anyhow, the
bookstores would be closed. He remembered having seen a row of dictionaries on the lower shelf
of one of Cavenaugh's bookcases. Cavenaugh had a lot of books, though he never read anything
but new stuff. Eastman prudently turned down his student's lamp very low--the thing had an
evil habit of smoking--and went down two flights to Cavenaugh's door.

The young man himself answered Eastman's ring. He was freshly dressed for the evening, except
for a brown smoking jacket, and his yellow hair had been brushed until it shone. He hesitated
as he confronted his caller, still holding the door knob, and his round eyes and smooth forehead
made their best imitation of a frown. When Eastman began to apologize, Cavenaugh's manner suddenly
changed. He caught his arm and jerked him into the narrow hall. "Come in, come in. Right along!"
he said excitedly. "Right along," he repeated as he pushed Eastman before him into his sitting-room.
"Well I'll--" he stopped short at the door and looked about his own room with an air of complete
mystification. The back window was wide open and a strong wind was blowing in. Cavenaugh walked
over to the window and stuck out his head, looking up and down the fire escape. When he pulled
his head in, he drew down the sash.

"I had a visitor I wanted you to see," he explained with a nervous smile. "At least I thought
I had. He must have gone out that way," nodding toward the window.

"Call him back. I only came to borrow a German dictionary, if you have one. Can't stay. Call
him back."

Cavenaugh shook his head despondently. "No use. He's beat it. Nowhere in sight."

"He must be active. Has he left something?" Eastman pointed to a very dirty white glove that
lay on the floor under the window.

"Yes, that's his." Cavenaugh reached for his tongs, picked up the glove, and tossed it into
the grate, where it quickly shriveled on the coals. Eastman felt that he had happened in upon
something disagreeable, possibly something shady, and he wanted to get away at once. Cavenaugh
stood staring at the fire and seemed stupid and dazed; so he repeated his request rather sternly,
"I think I've seen a German dictionary down there among your books. May I have it?"

Cavenaugh blinked at him. "A German dictionary? Oh, possibly! Those were my father's. I scarcely
know what there is." He put down the tongs and began to wipe his hands nervously with his handkerchief.

Eastman went over to the bookcase behind the Chesterfield, opened the door, swooped upon the
book he wanted and stuck it under his arm. He felt perfectly certain now that something shady
had been going on in Cavenaugh's rooms, and he saw no reason why he should come in for any
hang-over. "Thanks. I'll send it back to-morrow," he said curtly as he made for the door.

Cavenaugh followed him. "Wait a moment. I wanted you to see him. You did see his glove," glancing
at the grate.

Eastman laughed disagreeably. "I saw a glove. That's not evidence. Do your friends often use
that means of exit? Somewhat inconvenient."

Cavenaugh gave him a startled glance. "Wouldn't you think so? For an old man, a very rickety
old party? The ladders are steep, you know, and rusty." He approached the window again and
put it up softly. In a moment he drew his head back with a jerk. He caught Eastman's arm and
shoved him toward the window. "Hurry, please. Look! Down there." He pointed to the little patch
of paved court four flights down.

The square of pavement was so small and the walls about it were so high, that it was a good
deal like looking down a well. Four tall buildings backed upon the same court and made a kind
of shaft, with flagstones at the bottom, and at the top a square of dark blue with some stars
in it. At the bottom of the shaft Eastman saw a black figure, a man in a caped coat and a tall
hat stealing cautiously around, not across the square of pavement, keeping close to the dark
wall and avoiding the streak of light that fell on the flagstones from a window in the opposite
house. Seen from that height he was of course fore-shortened and probably looked more shambling
and decrepit than he was. He picked his way along with exaggerated care and looked like a silly
old cat crossing a wet street. When he reached the gate that led into an alley way between
two buildings, he felt about for the latch, opened the door a mere crack, and then shot out
under the feeble lamp that burned in the brick arch over the gateway. The door closed after him.

"He'll get run in," Eastman remarked curtly, turning away from the window. "That door shouldn't
be left unlocked. Any crook could come in. I'll speak to the janitor about it, if you don't
mind," he added sarcastically.

"Wish you would." Cavenaugh stood brushing down the front of his jacket, first with his right
hand and then with his left. "You saw him, didn't you?"

"Enough of him. Seems eccentric. I have to see a lot of buggy people. They don't take me in
any more. But I'm keeping you and I'm in a hurry myself. Good night."

Cavenaugh put out his hand detainingly and started to say something; but Eastman rudely turned
his back and went down the hall and out of the door. He had never felt anything shady about
Cavenaugh before, and he was sorry he had gone down for the dictionary. In five minutes he
was deep in his papers; but in the half hour when he was loafing before he dressed to go out,
the young man's curious behavior came into his mind again.

Eastman had merely a neighborly acquaintance with Cavenaugh. He had been to a supper at the
young man's rooms once, but he didn't particularly like Cavenaugh's friends; so the next time
he was asked, he had another engagement. He liked Cavenaugh himself, if for nothing else than
because he was so cheerful and trim and ruddy. A good complexion is always at a premium in
New York, especially when it shines reassuringly on a man who does everything in the world
to lose it. It encourages fellow mortals as to the inherent vigor of the human organism and
the amount of bad treatment it will stand for. "Footprints that perhaps another," etc.

Cavenaugh, he knew, had plenty of money. He was the son of a Pennsylvania preacher, who died
soon after he discovered that his ancestral acres were full of petroleum, and Kier had come
to New York to burn some of the oil. He was thirty-two and was still at it; spent his life,
literally, among the breakers. His motor hit the Park every morning as if it were the first
time ever. He took people out to supper every night. He went from restaurant to restaurant,
sometimes to half-a-dozen in an evening. The head waiters were his hosts and their cordiality
made him happy. They made a life-line for him up Broadway and down Fifth Avenue. Cavenaugh
was still fresh and smooth, round and plump, with a lustre to his hair and white teeth and
a clear look in his round eyes. He seemed absolutely unwearied and unimpaired; never bored
and never carried away.

Eastman always smiled when he met Cavenaugh in the entrance hall, serenely going forth to or
returning from gladiatorial combats with joy, or when he saw him rolling smoothly up to the
door in his car in the morning after a restful night in one of the remarkable new roadhouses
he was always finding. Eastman had seen a good many young men disappear on Cavenaugh's route,
and he admired this young man's endurance.

To-night, for the first time, he had got a whiff of something unwholesome about the fellow--bad
nerves, bad company, something on hand that he was ashamed of, a visitor old and vicious, who
must have had a key to Cavenaugh's apartment, for he was evidently there when Cavenaugh returned
at seven o'clock. Probably it was the same man Cavenaugh had seen in the hansom. He must have
been able to let himself in, for Cavenaugh kept no man but his chauffeur; or perhaps the janitor
had been instructed to let him in. In either case, and whoever he was, it was clear enough
that Cavenaugh was ashamed of him and was mixing up in questionable business of some kind.

Eastman sent Cavenaugh's book back by Rollins, and for the next few weeks he had no word with
him beyond a casual greeting when they happened to meet in the hall or the elevator. One Sunday
morning Cavenaugh telephoned up to him to ask if he could motor out to a roadhouse in Connecticut
that afternoon and have supper; but when Eastman found there were to be other guests he declined.

       *       *       *       *       *

On New Year's eve Eastman dined at the University Club at six o'clock and hurried home before
the usual manifestations of insanity had begun in the streets. When Rollins brought his smoking
coat, he asked him whether he wouldn't like to get off early.

"Yes, sir. But won't you be dressing, Mr. Eastman?" he inquired.

"Not to-night." Eastman handed him a bill. "Bring some change in the morning. There'll be fees."

Rollins lost no time in putting everything to rights for the night, and Eastman couldn't help
wishing that he were in such a hurry to be off somewhere himself. When he heard the hall door
close softly, he wondered if there were any place, after all, that he wanted to go. From his
window he looked down at the long lines of motors and taxis waiting for a signal to cross Broadway.
He thought of some of their probable destinations and decided that none of those places pulled
him very hard. The night was warm and wet, the air was drizzly. Vapor hung in clouds about
the Times Building, half hid the top of it, and made a luminous haze along Broadway. While
he was looking down at the army of wet, black carriage-tops and their reflected headlights
and tail-lights, Eastman heard a ring at his door. He deliberated. If it were a caller, the
hall porter would have telephoned up. It must be the janitor. When he opened the door, there
stood a rosy young man in a tuxedo, without a coat or hat.

"Pardon. Should I have telephoned? I half thought you wouldn't be in."

Eastman laughed. "Come in, Cavenaugh. You weren't sure whether you wanted company or not, eh,
and you were trying to let chance decide it? That was exactly my state of mind. Let's accept
the verdict." When they emerged from the narrow hall into his sitting-room, he pointed out
a seat by the fire to his guest. He brought a tray of decanters and soda bottles and placed
it on his writing table.

Cavenaugh hesitated, standing by the fire. "Sure you weren't starting for somewhere?"

"Do I look it? No, I was just making up my mind to stick it out alone when you rang. Have one?"
he picked up a tall tumbler.

"Yes, thank you. I always do."

Eastman chuckled. "Lucky boy! So will I. I had a very early dinner. New York is the most arid
place on holidays," he continued as he rattled the ice in the glasses. "When one gets too old
to hit the rapids down there, and tired of gobbling food to heathenish dance music, there is
absolutely no place where you can get a chop and some milk toast in peace, unless you have
strong ties of blood brotherhood on upper Fifth Avenue. But you, why aren't you starting for
somewhere?"

The young man sipped his soda and shook his head as he replied:

"Oh, I couldn't get a chop, either. I know only flashy people, of course." He looked up at
his host with such a grave and candid expression that Eastman decided there couldn't be anything
very crooked about the fellow. His smooth cheeks were positively cherubic.

"Well, what's the matter with them? Aren't they flashing to-night?"

"Only the very new ones seem to flash on New Year's eve. The older ones fade away. Maybe they
are hunting a chop, too."

"Well"--Eastman sat down--"holidays do dash one. I was just about to write a letter to a pair
of maiden aunts in my old home town, up-state; old coasting hill, snow-covered pines, lights
in the church windows. That's what you've saved me from."

Cavenaugh shook himself. "Oh, I'm sure that wouldn't have been good for you. Pardon me," he
rose and took a photograph from the bookcase, a handsome man in shooting clothes. "Dudley,
isn't it? Did you know him well?"

"Yes. An old friend. Terrible thing, wasn't it? I haven't got over the jolt yet."

"His suicide? Yes, terrible! Did you know his wife?"

"Slightly. Well enough to admire her very much. She must be terribly broken up. I wonder Dudley
didn't think of that."

Cavenaugh replaced the photograph carefully, lit a cigarette, and standing before the fire
began to smoke. "Would you mind telling me about him? I never met him, but of course I'd read
a lot about him, and I can't help feeling interested. It was a queer thing."

Eastman took out his cigar case and leaned back in his deep chair. "In the days when I knew
him best he hadn't any story, like the happy nations. Everything was properly arranged for
him before he was born. He came into the world happy, healthy, clever, straight, with the right
sort of connections and the right kind of fortune, neither too large nor too small. He helped
to make the world an agreeable place to live in until he was twenty-six. Then he married as
he should have married. His wife was a Californian, educated abroad. Beautiful. You have seen
her picture?"

Cavenaugh nodded. "Oh, many of them."

"She was interesting, too. Though she was distinctly a person of the world, she had retained
something, just enough of the large Western manner. She had the habit of authority, of calling
out a special train if she needed it, of using all our ingenious mechanical contrivances lightly
and easily, without over-rating them. She and Dudley knew how to live better than most people.
Their house was the most charming one I have ever known in New York. You felt freedom there,
and a zest of life, and safety--absolute sanctuary--from everything sordid or petty. A whole
society like that would justify the creation of man and would make our planet shine with a
soft, peculiar radiance among the constellations. You think I'm putting it on thick?"

The young man sighed gently. "Oh, no! One has always felt there must be people like that. I've
never known any."

"They had two children, beautiful ones. After they had been married for eight years, Rosina
met this Spaniard. He must have amounted to something. She wasn't a flighty woman. She came
home and told Dudley how matters stood. He persuaded her to stay at home for six months and
try to pull up. They were both fair-minded people, and I'm as sure as if I were the Almighty,
that she did try. But at the end of the time, Rosina went quietly off to Spain, and Dudley
went to hunt in the Canadian Rockies. I met his party out there. I didn't know his wife had
left him and talked about her a good deal. I noticed that he never drank anything, and his
light used to shine through the log chinks of his room until all hours, even after a hard day's
hunting. When I got back to New York, rumors were creeping about. Dudley did not come back.
He bought a ranch in Wyoming, built a big log house and kept splendid dogs and horses. One
of his sisters went out to keep house for him, and the children were there when they were not
in school. He had a great many visitors, and everyone who came back talked about how well Dudley
kept things going.

"He put in two years out there. Then, last month, he had to come back on business. A trust
fund had to be settled up, and he was administrator. I saw him at the club; same light, quick
step, same gracious handshake. He was getting gray, and there was something softer in his manner;
but he had a fine red tan on his face and said he found it delightful to be here in the season
when everything is going hard. The Madison Avenue house had been closed since Rosina left it.
He went there to get some things his sister wanted. That, of course, was the mistake. He went
alone, in the afternoon, and didn't go out for dinner--found some sherry and tins of biscuit
in the sideboard. He shot himself sometime that night. There were pistols in his smoking-room.
They found burnt out candles beside him in the morning. The gas and electricity were shut off.
I suppose there, in his own house, among his own things, it was too much for him. He left no
letters."

Cavenaugh blinked and brushed the lapel of his coat. "I suppose," he said slowly, "that every
suicide is logical and reasonable, if one knew all the facts."

Eastman roused himself. "No, I don't think so. I've known too many fellows who went off like
that--more than I deserve, I think--and some of them were absolutely inexplicable. I can understand
Dudley; but I can't see why healthy bachelors, with money enough, like ourselves, need such
a device. It reminds me of what Dr. Johnson said, that the most discouraging thing about life
is the number of fads and hobbies and fake religions it takes to put people through a few years
of it."

"Dr. Johnson? The specialist? Oh, the old fellow!" said Cavenaugh imperturbably. "Yes, that's
interesting. Still, I fancy if one knew the facts--Did you know about Wyatt?"

"I don't think so."

"You wouldn't, probably. He was just a fellow about town who spent money. He wasn't one of
the forestieri, though. Had connections here and owned a fine old place over on Staten Island.
He went in for botany, and had been all over, hunting things; rusts, I believe. He had a yacht
and used to take a gay crowd down about the South Seas, botanizing. He really did botanize,
I believe. I never knew such a spender--only not flashy. He helped a lot of fellows and he
was awfully good to girls, the kind who come down here to get a little fun, who don't like
to work and still aren't really tough, the kind you see talking hard for their dinner. Nobody
knows what becomes of them, or what they get out of it, and there are hundreds of new ones
every year. He helped dozens of 'em; it was he who got me curious about the little shop girls.
Well, one afternoon when his tea was brought, he took prussic acid instead. He didn't leave
any letters, either; people of any taste don't. They wouldn't leave any material reminder if
they could help it. His lawyers found that he had just $314.72 above his debts when he died.
He had planned to spend all his money, and then take his tea; he had worked it out carefully."

Eastman reached for his pipe and pushed his chair away from the fire. "That looks like a considered
case, but I don't think philosophical suicides like that are common. I think they usually come
from stress of feeling and are really, as the newspapers call them, desperate acts; done without
a motive. You remember when Anna Karenina was under the wheels, she kept saying, 'Why am I here?'"

Cavenaugh rubbed his upper lip with his pink finger and made an effort to wrinkle his brows.
"May I, please?" reaching for the whiskey. "But have you," he asked, blinking as the soda flew
at him, "have you ever known, yourself, cases that were really inexplicable?"

"A few too many. I was in Washington just before Captain Jack Purden was married and I saw
a good deal of him. Popular army man, fine record in the Philippines, married a charming girl
with lots of money; mutual devotion. It was the gayest wedding of the winter, and they started
for Japan. They stopped in San Francisco for a week and missed their boat because, as the bride
wrote back to Washington, they were too happy to move. They took the next boat, were both good
sailors, had exceptional weather. After they had been out for two weeks, Jack got up from his
deck chair one afternoon, yawned, put down his book, and stood before his wife. 'Stop reading
for a moment and look at me.' She laughed and asked him why. 'Because you happen to be good
to look at.' He nodded to her, went back to the stern and was never seen again. Must have gone
down to the lower deck and slipped overboard, behind the machinery. It was the luncheon hour,
not many people about; steamer cutting through a soft green sea. That's one of the most baffling
cases I know. His friends raked up his past, and it was as trim as a cottage garden. If he'd
so much as dropped an ink spot on his fatigue uniform, they'd have found it. He wasn't emotional
or moody; wasn't, indeed, very interesting; simply a good soldier, fond of all the pompous
little formalities that make up a military man's life. What do you make of that, my boy?"

Cavenaugh stroked his chin. "It's very puzzling, I admit. Still, if one knew everything----"

"But we do know everything. His friends wanted to find something to help them out, to help
the girl out, to help the case of the human creature."

"Oh, I don't mean things that people could unearth," said Cavenaugh uneasily. "But possibly
there were things that couldn't be found out."

Eastman shrugged his shoulders. "It's my experience that when there are 'things' as you call
them, they're very apt to be found. There is no such thing as a secret. To make any move at
all one has to employ human agencies, employ at least one human agent. Even when the pirates
killed the men who buried their gold for them, the bones told the story."

Cavenaugh rubbed his hands together and smiled his sunny smile.

"I like that idea. It's reassuring. If we can have no secrets, it means that we can't, after
all, go so far afield as we might," he hesitated, "yes, as we might."

Eastman looked at him sourly. "Cavenaugh, when you've practised law in New York for twelve
years, you find that people can't go far in any direction, except--" He thrust his forefinger
sharply at the floor. "Even in that direction, few people can do anything out of the ordinary.
Our range is limited. Skip a few baths, and we become personally objectionable. The slightest
carelessness can rot a man's integrity or give him ptomaine poisoning. We keep up only by incessant
cleansing operations, of mind and body. What we call character, is held together by all sorts
of tacks and strings and glue."

Cavenaugh looked startled. "Come now, it's not so bad as that, is it? I've always thought that
a serious man, like you, must know a lot of Launcelots." When Eastman only laughed, the younger
man squirmed about in his chair. He spoke again hastily, as if he were embarrassed. "Your military
friend may have had personal experiences, however, that his friends couldn't possibly get a
line on. He may accidentally have come to a place where he saw himself in too unpleasant a
light. I believe people can be chilled by a draft from outside, somewhere."

"Outside?" Eastman echoed. "Ah, you mean the far outside! Ghosts, delusions, eh?"

Cavenaugh winced. "That's putting it strong. Why not say tips from the outside? Delusions belong
to a diseased mind, don't they? There are some of us who have no minds to speak of, who yet
have had experiences. I've had a little something in that line myself and I don't look it, do I?"

Eastman looked at the bland countenance turned toward him. "Not exactly. What's your delusion?"

"It's not a delusion. It's a haunt."

The lawyer chuckled. "Soul of a lost Casino girl?"

"No; an old gentleman. A most unattractive old gentleman, who follows me about."

"Does he want money?"

Cavenaugh sat up straight. "No. I wish to God he wanted anything--but the pleasure of my society!
I'd let him clean me out to be rid of him. He's a real article. You saw him yourself that night
when you came to my rooms to borrow a dictionary, and he went down the fire-escape. You saw
him down in the court."

"Well, I saw somebody down in the court, but I'm too cautious to take it for granted that I
saw what you saw. Why, anyhow, should I see your haunt? If it was your friend I saw, he impressed
me disagreeably. How did you pick him up?"

Cavenaugh looked gloomy. "That was queer, too. Charley Burke and I had motored out to Long
Beach, about a year ago, sometime in October, I think. We had supper and stayed until late.
When we were coming home, my car broke down. We had a lot of girls along who had to get back
for morning rehearsals and things; so I sent them all into town in Charley's car, and he was
to send a man back to tow me home. I was driving myself, and didn't want to leave my machine.
We had not taken a direct road back; so I was stuck in a lonesome, woody place, no houses about.
I got chilly and made a fire, and was putting in the time comfortably enough, when this old
party steps up. He was in shabby evening clothes and a top hat, and had on his usual white
gloves. How he got there, at three o'clock in the morning, miles from any town or railway,
I'll leave it to you to figure out. He surely had no car. When I saw him coming up to the fire,
I disliked him. He had a silly, apologetic walk. His teeth were chattering, and I asked him
to sit down. He got down like a clothes-horse folding up. I offered him a cigarette, and when
he took off his gloves I couldn't help noticing how knotted and spotty his hands were. He was
asthmatic, and took his breath with a wheeze. 'Haven't you got anything--refreshing in there?'
he asked, nodding at the car. When I told him I hadn't, he sighed. 'Ah, you young fellows are
greedy. You drink it all up. You drink it all up, all up--up!' he kept chewing it over."

Cavenaugh paused and looked embarrassed again. "The thing that was most unpleasant is difficult
to explain. The old man sat there by the fire and leered at me with a silly sort of admiration
that was--well, more than humiliating. 'Gay boy, gay dog!' he would mutter, and when he grinned
he showed his teeth, worn and yellow--shells. I remembered that it was better to talk casually
to insane people; so I remarked carelessly that I had been out with a party and got stuck.

"'Oh yes, I remember,' he said, 'Flora and Lottie and Maybelle and Marcelline, and poor Kate.'

"He had named them correctly; so I began to think I had been hitting the bright waters too hard.

"Things I drank never had seemed to make me woody; but you can never tell when trouble is going
to hit you. I pulled my hat down and tried to look as uncommunicative as possible; but he kept
croaking on from time to time, like this: 'Poor Kate! Splendid arms, but dope got her. She
took up with Eastern religions after she had her hair dyed. Got to going to a Swami's joint,
and smoking opium. Temple of the Lotus, it was called, and the police raided it.'

"This was nonsense, of course; the young woman was in the pink of condition. I let him rave,
but I decided that if something didn't come out for me pretty soon, I'd foot it across Long
Island. There wasn't room enough for the two of us. I got up and took another try at my car.
He hopped right after me.

"'Good car,' he wheezed, 'better than the little Ford.'

"I'd had a Ford before, but so has everybody; that was a safe guess.

"'Still,' he went on, 'that run in from Huntington Bay in the rain wasn't bad. Arrested for
speeding, he-he.'

"It was true I had made such a run, under rather unusual circumstances, and had been arrested.
When at last I heard my life-boat snorting up the road, my visitor got up, sighed, and stepped
back into the shadow of the trees. I didn't wait to see what became of him, you may believe.
That was visitation number one. What do you think of it?"

Cavenaugh looked at his host defiantly. Eastman smiled.

"I think you'd better change your mode of life, Cavenaugh. Had many returns?" he inquired.

"Too many, by far." The young man took a turn about the room and came back to the fire. Standing
by the mantel he lit another cigarette before going on with his story:

"The second visitation happened in the street, early in the evening, about eight o'clock. I
was held up in a traffic block before the Plaza. My chauffeur was driving. Old Nibbs steps
up out of the crowd, opens the door of my car, gets in and sits down beside me. He had on wilted
evening clothes, same as before, and there was some sort of heavy scent about him. Such an
unpleasant old party! A thorough-going rotter; you knew it at once. This time he wasn't talkative,
as he had been when I first saw him. He leaned back in the car as if he owned it, crossed his
hands on his stick and looked out at the crowd--sort of hungrily.

"I own I really felt a loathing compassion for him. We got down the avenue slowly. I kept looking
out at the mounted police. But what could I do? Have him pulled? I was afraid to. I was awfully
afraid of getting him into the papers.

"'I'm going to the New Astor,' I said at last. 'Can I take you anywhere?'

"'No, thank you,' says he. 'I get out when you do. I'm due on West 44th. I'm dining to-night
with Marcelline--all that is left of her!'

"He put his hand to his hat brim with a grewsome salute. Such a scandalous, foolish old face
as he had! When we pulled up at the Astor, I stuck my hand in my pocket and asked him if he'd
like a little loan.

"'No, thank you, but'--he leaned over and whispered, ugh!--'but save a little, save a little.
Forty years from now--a little--comes in handy. Save a little.'

"His eyes fairly glittered as he made his remark. I jumped out. I'd have jumped into the North
River. When he tripped off, I asked my chauffeur if he'd noticed the man who got into the car
with me. He said he knew someone was with me, but he hadn't noticed just when he got in. Want
to hear any more?"

Cavenaugh dropped into his chair again. His plump cheeks were a trifle more flushed than usual,
but he was perfectly calm. Eastman felt that the young man believed what he was telling him.

"Of course I do. It's very interesting. I don't see quite where you are coming out though."

Cavenaugh sniffed. "No more do I. I really feel that I've been put upon. I haven't deserved
it any more than any other fellow of my kind. Doesn't it impress you disagreeably?"

"Well, rather so. Has anyone else seen your friend?"

"You saw him."

"We won't count that. As I said, there's no certainty that you and I saw the same person in
the court that night. Has anyone else had a look in?"

"People sense him rather than see him. He usually crops up when I'm alone or in a crowd on
the street. He never approaches me when I'm with people I know, though I've seen him hanging
about the doors of theatres when I come out with a party; loafing around the stage exit, under
a wall; or across the street, in a doorway. To be frank, I'm not anxious to introduce him.
The third time, it was I who came upon him. In November my driver, Harry, had a sudden attack
of appendicitis. I took him to the Presbyterian Hospital in the car, early in the evening.
When I came home, I found the old villain in my rooms. I offered him a drink, and he sat down.
It was the first time I had seen him in a steady light, with his hat off.

"His face is lined like a railway map, and as to color--Lord, what a liver! His scalp grows
tight to his skull, and his hair is dyed until it's perfectly dead, like a piece of black cloth."

Cavenaugh ran his fingers through his own neatly trimmed thatch, and seemed to forget where
he was for a moment.

"I had a twin brother, Brian, who died when we were sixteen. I have a photograph of him on
my wall, an enlargement from a kodak of him, doing a high jump, rather good thing, full of
action. It seemed to annoy the old gentleman. He kept looking at it and lifting his eyebrows,
and finally he got up, tip-toed across the room, and turned the picture to the wall.

"'Poor Brian! Fine fellow, but died young,' says he.

"Next morning, there was the picture, still reversed."

"Did he stay long?" Eastman asked interestedly.

"Half an hour, by the clock."

"Did he talk?"

"Well, he rambled."

"What about?"

Cavenaugh rubbed his pale eyebrows before answering.

"About things that an old man ought to want to forget. His conversation is highly objectionable.
Of course he knows me like a book; everything I've ever done or thought. But when he recalls
them, he throws a bad light on them, somehow. Things that weren't much off color, look rotten.
He doesn't leave one a shred of self-respect, he really doesn't. That's the amount of it."
The young man whipped out his handkerchief and wiped his face.

"You mean he really talks about things that none of your friends know?"

"Oh, dear, yes! Recalls things that happened in school. Anything disagreeable. Funny thing,
he always turns Brian's picture to the wall."

"Does he come often?"

"Yes, oftener, now. Of course I don't know how he gets in down-stairs. The hall boys never
see him. But he has a key to my door. I don't know how he got it, but I can hear him turn it
in the lock."

"Why don't you keep your driver with you, or telephone for me to come down?"

"He'd only grin and go down the fire escape as he did before. He's often done it when Harry's
come in suddenly. Everybody has to be alone sometimes, you know. Besides, I don't want anybody
to see him. He has me there."

"But why not? Why do you feel responsible for him?"

Cavenaugh smiled wearily. "That's rather the point, isn't it? Why do I? But I absolutely do.
That identifies him, more than his knowing all about my life and my affairs."

Eastman looked at Cavenaugh thoughtfully. "Well, I should advise you to go in for something
altogether different and new, and go in for it hard; business, engineering, metallurgy, something
this old fellow wouldn't be interested in. See if you can make him remember logarithms."

Cavenaugh sighed. "No, he has me there, too. People never really change; they go on being themselves.
But I would never make much trouble. Why can't they let me alone, damn it! I'd never hurt anybody,
except, perhaps----"

"Except your old gentleman, eh?" Eastman laughed. "Seriously, Cavenaugh, if you want to shake
him, I think a year on a ranch would do it. He would never be coaxed far from his favorite
haunts. He would dread Montana."

Cavenaugh pursed up his lips. "So do I!"

"Oh, you think you do. Try it, and you'll find out. A gun and a horse beats all this sort of
thing. Besides losing your haunt, you'd be putting ten years in the bank for yourself. I know
a good ranch where they take people, if you want to try it."

"Thank you. I'll consider. Do you think I'm batty?"

"No, but I think you've been doing one sort of thing too long. You need big horizons. Get out
of this."

Cavenaugh smiled meekly. He rose lazily and yawned behind his hand. "It's late, and I've taken
your whole evening." He strolled over to the window and looked out. "Queer place, New York;
rough on the little fellows. Don't you feel sorry for them, the girls especially? I do. What
a fight they put up for a little fun! Why, even that old goat is sorry for them, the only decent
thing he kept."

Eastman followed him to the door and stood in the hall, while Cavenaugh waited for the elevator.
When the car came up Cavenaugh extended his pink, warm hand. "Good night."

The cage sank and his rosy countenance disappeared, his round-eyed smile being the last thing
to go.

       *       *       *       *       *

Weeks passed before Eastman saw Cavenaugh again. One morning, just as he was starting for Washington
to argue a case before the Supreme Court, Cavenaugh telephoned him at his office to ask him
about the Montana ranch he had recommended; said he meant to take his advice and go out there
for the spring and summer.

When Eastman got back from Washington, he saw dusty trunks, just up from the trunk room, before
Cavenaugh's door. Next morning, when he stopped to see what the young man was about, he found
Cavenaugh in his shirt sleeves, packing.

"I'm really going; off to-morrow night. You didn't think it of me, did you?" he asked gaily.

"Oh, I've always had hopes of you!" Eastman declared. "But you are in a hurry, it seems to me."

"Yes, I am in a hurry." Cavenaugh shot a pair of leggings into one of the open trunks. "I telegraphed
your ranch people, used your name, and they said it would be all right. By the way, some of
my crowd are giving a little dinner for me at Rector's to-night. Couldn't you be persuaded,
as it's a farewell occasion?" Cavenaugh looked at him hopefully.

Eastman laughed and shook his head. "Sorry, Cavenaugh, but that's too gay a world for me. I've
got too much work lined up before me. I wish I had time to stop and look at your guns, though.
You seem to know something about guns. You've more than you'll need, but nobody can have too
many good ones." He put down one of the revolvers regretfully. "I'll drop in to see you in
the morning, if you're up."

"I shall be up, all right. I've warned my crowd that I'll cut away before midnight."

"You won't, though," Eastman called back over his shoulder as he hurried down-stairs.

The next morning, while Eastman was dressing, Rollins came in greatly excited.

"I'm a little late, sir. I was stopped by Harry, Mr. Cavenaugh's driver. Mr. Cavenaugh shot
himself last night, sir."

Eastman dropped his vest and sat down on his shoe-box. "You're drunk, Rollins," he shouted.
"He's going away to-day!"

"Yes, sir. Harry found him this morning. Ah, he's quite dead, sir. Harry's telephoned for the
coroner. Harry don't know what to do with the ticket."

Eastman pulled on his coat and ran down the stairway. Cavenaugh's trunks were strapped and
piled before the door. Harry was walking up and down the hall with a long green railroad ticket
in his hand and a look of complete stupidity on his face.

"What shall I do about this ticket, Mr. Eastman?" he whispered. "And what about his trunks?
He had me tell the transfer people to come early. They may be here any minute. Yes, sir. I
brought him home in the car last night, before twelve, as cheerful as could be."

"Be quiet, Harry. Where is he?"

"In his bed, sir."

Eastman went into Cavenaugh's sleeping-room. When he came back to the sitting-room, he looked
over the writing table; railway folders, time-tables, receipted bills, nothing else. He looked
up for the photograph of Cavenaugh's twin brother. There it was, turned to the wall. Eastman
took it down and looked at it; a boy in track clothes, half lying in the air, going over the
string shoulders first, above the heads of a crowd of lads who were running and cheering. The
face was somewhat blurred by the motion and the bright sunlight. Eastman put the picture back,
as he found it. Had Cavenaugh entertained his visitor last night, and had the old man been
more convincing than usual? "Well, at any rate, he's seen to it that the old man can't establish
identity. What a soft lot they are, fellows like poor Cavenaugh!" Eastman thought of his office
as a delightful place.

                                      McClure's, November 1915

The Bookkeeper's Wife

Nobody but the janitor was stirring about the offices of the Remsen Paper Company, and still
Percy Bixby sat at his desk, crouched on his high stool and staring out at the tops of the
tall buildings flushed with the winter sunset, at the hundreds of windows, so many rectangles
of white electric light, flashing against the broad waves of violet that ebbed across the sky.
His ledgers were all in their places, his desk was in order, his office coat on its peg, and
yet Percy's smooth, thin face wore the look of anxiety and strain which usually meant that
he was behind in his work. He was trying to persuade himself to accept a loan from the company
without the company's knowledge. As a matter of fact, he had already accepted it. His books
were fixed, the money, in a black-leather bill-book, was already inside his waistcoat pocket.

He had still time to change his mind, to rectify the false figures in his ledger, and to tell
Stella Brown that they couldn't possibly get married next month. There he always halted in
his reasoning, and went back to the beginning.

The Remsen Paper Company was a very wealthy concern, with easy, old-fashioned working methods.
They did a longtime credit business with safe customers, who never thought of paying up very
close on their large indebtedness. From the payments on these large accounts Percy had taken
a hundred dollars here and two hundred there until he had made up the thousand he needed. So
long as he stayed by the books himself and attended to the mail-orders he couldn't possibly
be found out. He could move these little shortages about from account to account indefinitely.
He could have all the time he needed to pay back the deficit, and more time than he needed.

Although he was so far along in one course of action, his mind still clung resolutely to the
other. He did not believe he was going to do it. He was the least of a sharper in the world.
Being scrupulously honest even in the most trifling matters was a pleasure to him. He was the
sort of young man that Socialists hate more than they hate capitalists. He loved his desk,
he loved his books, which had no handwriting in them but his own. He never thought of resenting
the fact that he had written away in those books the good red years between twenty-one and
twenty-seven. He would have hated to let any one else put so much as a pen-scratch in them.
He liked all the boys about the office; his desk, worn smooth by the sleeves of his alpaca
coat; his rulers and inks and pens and calendars. He had a great pride in working economics,
and he always got so far ahead when supplies were distributed that he had drawers full of pencils
and pens and rubber bands against a rainy day.

Percy liked regularity: to get his work done on time, to have his half-day off every Saturday,
to go to the theater Saturday night, to buy a new necktie twice a month, to appear in a new
straw hat on the right day in May, and to know what was going on in New York. He read the morning
and evening papers coming and going on the elevated, and preferred journals of approximate
reliability. He got excited about ballgames and elections and business failures, was not above
an interest in murders and divorce scandals, and he checked the news off as neatly as he checked
his mail-orders. In short, Percy Bixby was like the model pupil who is satisfied with his lessons
and his teachers and his holidays, and who would gladly go to school all his life. He had never
wanted anything outside his routine until he wanted Stella Brown to marry him, and that had
upset everything.

It wasn't, he told himself for the hundredth time, that she was extravagant. Not a bit of it.
She was like all girls. Moreover, she made good money, and why should she marry unless she
could better herself? The trouble was that he had lied to her about his salary. There were
a lot of fellows rushing Mrs. Brown's five daughters, and they all seemed to have fixed on
Stella as first choice and this or that one of the sisters as second. Mrs. Brown thought it
proper to drop an occasional hint in the presence of these young men to the effect that she
expected Stella to "do well." It went without saying that hair and complexion like Stella's
could scarcely be expected to do poorly. Most of the boys who went to the house and took the
girls out in a bunch to dances and movies seemed to realize this. They merely wanted a whirl
with Stella before they settled down to one of her sisters. It was tacitly understood that
she came too high for them. Percy had sensed all this through those slumbering instincts which
awake in us all to befriend us in love or in danger.

But there was one of his rivals, he knew, who was a man to be reckoned with. Charley Greengay
was a young salesman who wore tailor-made clothes and spotted waistcoats, and had a necktie
for every day in the month. His air was that of a young man who is out for things that come
high and who is going to get them. Mrs. Brown was ever and again dropping a word before Percy
about how the girl that took Charley would have her flat furnished by the best furniture people,
and her china-closet stocked with the best ware, and would have nothing to worry about but
nicks and scratches. It was because he felt himself pitted against this pulling power of Greengay's
that Percy had brazenly lied to Mrs. Brown, and told her that his salary had been raised to
fifty a week, and that now he wanted to get married.

When he threw out this challenge to Mother Brown, Percy was getting thirty-five dollars a week,
and he knew well enough that there were several hundred thousand young men in New York who
would do his work as well as he did for thirty.

These were the factors in Percy's present situation. He went over them again and again as he
sat stooping on his tall stool. He had quite lost track of time when he heard the janitor call
good night to the watchman. Without thinking what he was doing, he slid into his overcoat,
caught his hat, and rushed out to the elevator, which was waiting for the janitor. The moment
the car dropped, it occurred to him that the thing was decided without his having made up his
mind at all. The familiar floors passed him, ten, nine, eight, seven. By the time he reached
the fifth, there was no possibility of going back; the click of the drop-lever seemed to settle
that. The money was in his pocket. Now, he told himself as he hurried out into the exciting
clamor of the street, he was not going to worry about it any more.

       *       *       *       *       *

When Percy reached the Browns' flat on 123d Street that evening he felt just the slightest
chill in Stella's greeting. He could make that all right, he told himself, as he kissed her
lightly in the dark three-by-four entrance-hall. Percy's courting had been prosecuted mainly
in the Bronx or in winged pursuit of a Broadway car. When he entered the crowded sitting-room
he greeted Mrs. Brown respectfully and the four girls playfully. They were all piled on one
couch, reading the continued story in the evening paper, and they didn't think it necessary
to assume more formal attitudes for Percy. They looked up over the smeary pink sheets of paper,
and handed him, as Percy said, the same old jolly:

"Hullo, Perc'! Come to see me, ain't you? So flattered!"

"Any sweet goods on you, Perc'? Anything doing in the bong-bong line to-night?"

"Look at his new neckwear! Say, Perc', remember me. That tie would go lovely with my new tailored
waist."

"Quit your kiddin', girls!" called Mrs. Brown, who was drying shirt-waists on the dining-room
radiator. "And, Percy, mind the rugs when you're steppin' round among them gum-drops."

Percy fired his last shot at the recumbent figures, and followed Stella into the dining-room,
where the table and two large easy-chairs formed, in Mrs. Brown's estimation, a proper background
for a serious suitor. 

Don't talk to dis nigger 'bout patrollers. They run me many a time. You had to have a pass wid
your name on it, who you b'long to, where gwine to, and de date you expected back. If they
find your pass was to Mr. James' and they ketch you at Mr. Rabb's, then you got a floggin',
sure and plenty. Maj. Bell was a kind master and would give us Saturday. Us would go fishin'
or rabbit huntin' sometime.

"Us had two doctors, Doctor Furman and Doctor Davis. White folks care for you when you sick.
I didn't have no money in slavery time, didn't have no use for none. Us had no quarters, houses
just here and dere on de place, 'round de spring where us got water.

"My Marster went to de old war and was a major. He had brass buttons, butterflies on his shoulders,
and all dat, when he come back.

"De Yankees come. Fust thing they look for was money.

They put a pistol right in my forehead and say: 'I got to have your money, where is it?' Dere was
a gal, Caroline, who had some money; they took it away from her. They took de geese, de chickens
and all dat was worth takin' off de place, stripped it.

Took all de meat out de smoke-house, corn out de crib, cattle out de pasture, burnt de gin-house
and cotton. When they left, they shot some cows and hogs and left them lying right dere. Dere
was a awful smell round dere for weeks after.

"Somethin' d'rected me, when I was free, to go work where I was born, on de Martin place. I married
Mary Douglas, a good-lookin' wench.

A Yankee took a fancy to her and she went off wid de Yankee. She stayed a long time, then come
back, but I'd done got Preacher Rice to marry me to Louvinia then.

Dis second wife was a good gal. I raised ten chillun by her, but I's outlived them all but
Manuel, Clara and John. When Louvinia passed out, I got Magistrate Smith to jine me and Nancy.
She's still livin'. Home sick now, can't do nothin'.

"White people been good to me.

I've been livin' in dis home, free of rent, given me for life by Mr. Jim Smith, 'cause I was
his faithful servant twenty years.

"Many times I's set up in de gallery of de old brick church on Little River. They had a special
catechism for de slaves, dat asked us who made you, what He made you out of, and what He made
you for? I ain't forgot de answers to dis day.

"Marster Major give us Chris'mas day and a pass to visit 'bout but we sho' had to be back and

"I got my name after freedom. My pappy b'long to Mr. David R. Evans. His name was Steve; wasn't

me Lewis Evans.
"I b'longs to de Baptist church. Am trustin' in de Lord. He gives
me a conscience and I knows when I's doin' right and when de devil

'Swing Low, Sweet Chariot, Jesus Gwine Carry Me Home.' Ain't got many
more days to stay. I knows I'm gwine Home."

PHILLIP EVANS EX-SLAVE 85 YEARS OLD.

Phillip Evans,

for many white families in Winnsboro. Neither Phillip nor his boy
can work. The wife nurses occasionally.

Percy spent a night of torment, lying tense on his bed in the dark, and figuring out how long
it would take him to pay back the money he was advancing to himself. Any fool could do it in
five years, he reasoned, but he was going to do it in three. The trouble was that his expensive
courtship had taken every penny of his salary. With competitors like Charley Greengay, you
had to spend money or drop out. Certain birds, he reflected ruefully, are supplied with more
attractive plumage when they are courting, but nature hadn't been so thoughtful for men. When
Percy reached the office in the morning he climbed on his tall stool and leaned his arms on
his ledger. He was so glad to feel it there that he was faint and weak-kneed.

       *       *       *       *       *

Oliver Remsen, Junior, had brought new blood into the Remsen Paper Company. He married shortly
after Percy Bixby did, and in the five succeeding years he had considerably enlarged the company's
business and profits. He had been particularly successful in encouraging efficiency and loyalty
in the employees. From the time he came into the office he had stood for shorter hours, longer
holidays, and a generous consideration of men's necessities. He came out of college on the
wave of economic reform, and he continued to read and think a good deal about how the machinery
of labor is operated. He knew more about the men who worked for him than their mere office records.

Young Remsen was troubled about Percy Bixby because he took no summer vacations--always asked
for the two weeks' extra pay instead. Other men in the office had skipped a vacation now and
then, but Percy had stuck to his desk for five years, had tottered to his stool through attacks
of grippe and tonsilitis. He seemed to have grown fast to his ledger, and it was to this that
Oliver objected. He liked his men to stay men, to look like men and live like men. He remembered
how alert and wide-awake Bixby had seemed to him when he himself first came into the office.
He had picked Bixby out as the most intelligent and interested of his father's employees, and
since then had often wondered why he never seemed to see chances to forge ahead. Promotions,
of course, went to the men who went after them. When Percy's baby died, he went to the funeral,
and asked Percy to call on him if he needed money. Once when he chanced to sit down by Bixby
on the elevated and found him reading Bryce's "American Commonwealth," he asked him to make
use of his own large office library. Percy thanked him, but he never came for any books. Oliver
wondered whether his bookkeeper really tried to avoid him.

One evening Oliver met the Bixbys in the lobby of a theater. He introduced Mrs. Remsen to them,
and held them for some moments in conversation. When they got into their motor, Mrs. Remsen said:

"Is that little man afraid of you, Oliver? He looked like a scared rabbit."

Oliver snapped the door, and said with a shade of irritation:

"I don't know what's the matter with him. He's the fellow I've told you about who never takes
a vacation. I half believe it's his wife. She looks pitiless enough for anything."

"She's very pretty of her kind," mused Mrs. Remsen, "but rather chilling. One can see that
she has ideas about elegance."

"Rather unfortunate ones for a bookkeeper's wife. I surmise that Percy felt she was overdressed,
and that made him awkward with me. I've always suspected that fellow of good taste."

After that, when Remsen passed the counting-room and saw Percy screwed up over his ledger,
he often remembered Mrs. Bixby, with her cold, pale eyes and long lashes, and her expression
that was something between indifference and discontent. She rose behind Percy's bent shoulders
like an apparition.

One spring afternoon Remsen was closeted in his private office with his lawyer until a late
hour. As he came down the long hall in the dusk he glanced through the glass partition into
the counting-room, and saw Percy Bixby huddled up on his tall stool, though it was too dark
to work. Indeed, Bixby's ledger was closed, and he sat with his two arms resting on the brown
cover. He did not move a muscle when young Remsen entered.

"You are late, Bixby, and so am I," Oliver began genially as he crossed to the front of the
room and looked out at the lighted windows of other tall buildings. "The fact is, I've been
doing something that men have a foolish way of putting off. I've been making my will."

"Yes, sir." Percy brought it out with a deep breath.

"Glad to be through with it," Oliver went on. "Mr. Melton will bring the paper back to-morrow,
and I'd like to ask you to be one of the witnesses."

"I'd be very proud, Mr. Remsen."

"Thank you, Bixby. Good night." Remsen took up his hat just as Percy slid down from his stool.

"Mr. Remsen, I'm told you're going to have the books gone over."

"Why, yes, Bixby. Don't let that trouble you. I'm taking in a new partner, you know, an old
college friend. Just because he is a friend, I insist upon all the usual formalities. But it
is a formality, and I'll guarantee the expert won't make a scratch on your books. Good night.
You'd better be coming, too." Remsen had reached the door when he heard "Mr. Remsen!" in a
desperate voice behind him. He turned, and saw Bixby standing uncertainly at one end of the
desk, his hand still on his ledger, his uneven shoulders drooping forward and his head hanging
as if he were seasick. Remsen came back and stood at the other end of the long desk. It was
too dark to see Bixby's face clearly.

"What is it, Bixby?"

"Mr. Remsen, five years ago, just before I was married, I falsified the books a thousand dollars,
and I used the money." Percy leaned forward against his desk, which took him just across the chest.

"What's that, Bixby?" Young Remsen spoke in a tone of polite surprise. He felt painfully embarrassed.

"Yes, sir. I thought I'd get it all paid back before this. I've put back three hundred, but
the books are still seven hundred out of true. I've played the shortages about from account
to account these five years, but an expert would find 'em in twenty-four hours."

"I don't just understand how--" Oliver stopped and shook his head.

"I held it out of the Western remittances, Mr. Remsen. They were coming in heavy just then.
I was up against it. I hadn't saved anything to marry on, and my wife thought I was getting
more money than I was. Since we've been married, I've never had the nerve to tell her. I could
have paid it all back if it hadn't been for the unforeseen expenses."

Remsen sighed.

"Being married is largely unforeseen expenses, Percy. There's only one way to fix this up:
I'll give you seven hundred dollars in cash to-morrow, and you can give me your personal note,
with the understanding that I hold ten dollars a week out of your pay-check until it is paid.
I think you ought to tell your wife exactly how you are fixed, though. You can't expect her
to help you much when she doesn't know."

       *       *       *       *       *

That night Mrs. Bixby was sitting in their flat, waiting for her husband. She was dressed for
a bridge party, and often looked with impatience from her paper to the Mission clock, as big
as a coffin and with nothing but two weights dangling in its hollow framework. Percy had been
loath to buy the clock when they got their furniture, and he had hated it ever since. Stella
had changed very little since she came into the flat a bride. Then she wore her hair in a Floradora
pompadour; now she wore it hooded close about her head like a scarf, in a rather smeary manner,
like an Impressionist's brush-work. She heard her husband come in and close the door softly.
While he was taking off his hat in the narrow tunnel of a hall, she called to him:

"I hope you've had something to eat down-town. You'll have to dress right away." Percy came
in and sat down. She looked up from the evening paper she was reading. "You've no time to sit
down. We must start in fifteen minutes."

He shaded his eyes from the glaring overhead light.

"I'm afraid I can't go anywhere to-night. I'm all in."

Mrs. Bixby rattled her paper, and turned from the theatrical page to the fashions.

"You'll feel better after you dress. We won't stay late."

Her even persistence usually conquered her husband. She never forgot anything she had once
decided to do. Her manner of following it up grew more chilly, but never weaker. To-night there
was no spring in Percy. He closed his eyes and replied without moving:

"I can't go. You had better telephone the Burks we aren't coming. I have to tell you something
disagreeable."

Stella rose.

"I certainly am not going to disappoint the Burks and stay at home to talk about anything disagreeable."

"You're not very sympathetic, Stella."

She turned away.

"If I were, you'd soon settle down into a pretty dull proposition. We'd have no social life
now if I didn't keep at you."

Percy roused himself a little.

"Social life? Well, we'll have to trim that pretty close for a while. I'm in debt to the company.
We've been living beyond our means ever since we were married."

"We can't live on less than we do," Stella said quietly. "No use in taking that up again."

Percy sat up, clutching the arms of his chair.

"We'll have to take it up. I'm seven hundred dollars short, and the books are to be audited
to-morrow. I told young Remsen and he's going to take my note and hold the money out of my
pay-checks. He could send me to jail, of course."

Stella turned and looked down at him with a gleam of interest.

"Oh, you've been playing solitaire with the books, have you? And he's found you out! I hope
I'll never see that man again. Sugar face!" She said this with intense acrimony. Her forehead
flushed delicately, and her eyes were full of hate. Young Remsen was not her idea of a "business
man."

Stella went into the other room. When she came back she wore her evening coat and carried long
gloves and a black scarf. This she began to arrange over her hair before the mirror above the
false fireplace. Percy lay inert in the Morris chair and watched her. Yes, he understood; it
was very difficult for a woman with hair like that to be shabby and to go without things. Her
hair made her conspicuous, and it had to be lived up to. It had been the deciding factor in
his fate.

Stella caught the lace over one ear with a large gold hairpin. She repeated this until she
got a good effect. Then turning to Percy, she began to draw on her gloves.

"I'm not worrying any, because I'm going back into business," she said firmly. "I meant to,
anyway, if you didn't get a raise the first of the year. I have the offer of a good position,
and we can live in an apartment hotel."

Percy was on his feet in an instant.

"I won't have you grinding in any office. That's flat."

Stella's lower lip quivered in a commiserating smile. "Oh, I won't lose my health. Charley
Greengay's a partner in his concern now, and he wants a private secretary."

Percy drew back.

"You can't work for Greengay. He's got too bad a reputation. You've more pride than that, Stella."

The thin sweep of color he knew so well went over Stella's face.

"His business reputation seems to be all right," she commented, working the kid on with her
left hand.

"What if it is?" Percy broke out. "He's the cheapest kind of a skate. He gets into scrapes
with the girls in his own office. The last one got into the newspapers, and he had to pay the
girl a wad."

"He don't get into scrapes with his books, anyway, and he seems to be able to stand getting
into the papers. I excuse Charley. His wife's a pill."

"I suppose you think he'd have been all right if he'd married you," said Percy, bitterly.

"Yes, I do." Stella buttoned her glove with an air of finishing something, and then looked
at Percy without animosity. "Charley and I both have sporty tastes, and we like excitement.
You might as well live in Newark if you're going to sit at home in the evening. You oughtn't
to have married a business woman; you need somebody domestic. There's nothing in this sort
of life for either of us."

"That means, I suppose, that you're going around with Greengay and his crowd?"

"Yes, that's my sort of crowd, and you never did fit into it. You're too intellectual. I've
always been proud of you, Percy. You're better style than Charley, but that gets tiresome.
You will never burn much red fire in New York, now, will you?"

Percy did not reply. He sat looking at the minute-hand of the eviscerated Mission clock. His
wife almost never took the trouble to argue with him.

"You're old style, Percy," she went on. "Of course everybody marries and wishes they hadn't,
but nowadays people get over it. Some women go ahead on the quiet, but I'm giving it to you
straight. I'm going to work for Greengay. I like his line of business, and I meet people well.
Now I'm going to the Burks'."

Percy dropped his hands limply between his knees.

"I suppose," he brought out, "the real trouble is that you've decided my earning power is not
very great."

"That's part of it, and part of it is you're old-fashioned." Stella paused at the door and
looked back. "What made you rush me, anyway, Percy?" she asked indulgently. "What did you go
and pretend to be a spender and get tied up with me for?"

"I guess everybody wants to be a spender when he's in love," Percy replied.

Stella shook her head mournfully.

"No, you're a spender or you're not. Greengay has been broke three times, fired, down and out,
black-listed. But he's always come back, and he always will. You will never be fired, but you'll
always be poor." She turned and looked back again before she went out.

       *       *       *       *       *

Six months later Bixby came to young Oliver Remsen one afternoon and said he would like to
have twenty dollars a week held out of his pay until his debt was cleared off.

Oliver looked up at his sallow employee and asked him how he could spare as much as that.

"My expenses are lighter," Bixby replied. "My wife has gone into business with a ready-to-wear
firm. She is not living with me any more."

Oliver looked annoyed, and asked him if nothing could be done to readjust his domestic affairs.
Bixby said no; they would probably remain as they were.

"But where are you living, Bixby? How have you arranged things?" the young man asked impatiently.

"I'm very comfortable. I live in a boarding-house and have my own furniture. There are several
fellows there who are fixed the same way. Their wives went back into business, and they drifted
apart."

With a baffled expression Remsen stared at the uneven shoulders under the skin-fitting alpaca
desk coat as his bookkeeper went out. He had meant to do something for Percy, but somehow,
he reflected, one never did do anything for a fellow who had been stung as hard as that.

                                             Century, May 1916

Ardessa

The grand-mannered old man who sat at a desk in the reception-room of "The Outcry" offices
to receive visitors and incidentally to keep the time-book of the employees, looked up as Miss
Devine entered at ten minutes past ten and condescendingly wished him good morning. He bowed
profoundly as she minced past his desk, and with an indifferent air took her course down the
corridor that led to the editorial offices. Mechanically he opened the flat, black book at
his elbow and placed his finger on D, running his eye along the line of figures after the name
Devine. "It's banker's hours she keeps, indeed," he muttered. What was the use of entering
so capricious a record? Nevertheless, with his usual preliminary flourish he wrote 10:10 under
this, the fourth day of May.

The employee who kept banker's hours rustled on down the corridor to her private room, hung
up her lavender jacket and her trim spring hat, and readjusted her side combs by the mirror
inside her closet door. Glancing at her desk, she rang for an office boy, and reproved him
because he had not dusted more carefully and because there were lumps in her paste. When he
disappeared with the paste-jar, she sat down to decide which of her employer's letters he should
see and which he should not.

Ardessa was not young and she was certainly not handsome. The coquettish angle at which she
carried her head was a mannerism surviving from a time when it was more becoming. She shuddered
at the cold candor of the new business woman, and was insinuatingly feminine.

Ardessa's employer, like young Lochinvar, had come out of the West, and he had done a great
many contradictory things before he became proprietor and editor of "The Outcry." Before he
decided to go to New York and make the East take notice of him, O'Mally had acquired a punctual,
reliable silver-mine in South Dakota. This silent friend in the background made his journalistic
success comparatively easy. He had figured out, when he was a rich nobody in Nevada, that the
quickest way to cut into the known world was through the printing-press. He arrived in New
York, bought a highly respectable publication, and turned it into a red-hot magazine of protest,
which he called "The Outcry." He knew what the West wanted, and it proved to be what everybody
secretly wanted. In six years he had done the thing that had hitherto seemed impossible: built
up a national weekly, out on the news-stands the same day in New York and San Francisco; a
magazine the people howled for, a moving-picture film of their real tastes and interests.

O'Mally bought "The Outcry" to make a stir, not to make a career, but he had got built into
the thing more than he ever intended. It had made him a public man and put him into politics.
He found the publicity game diverting, and it held him longer than any other game had ever
done. He had built up about him an organization of which he was somewhat afraid and with which
he was vastly bored. On his staff there were five famous men, and he had made every one of
them. At first it amused him to manufacture celebrities. He found he could take an average
reporter from the daily press, give him a "line" to follow, a trust to fight, a vice to expose,--this
was all in that good time when people were eager to read about their own wickedness,--and in
two years the reporter would be recognized as an authority. Other people--Napoleon, Disraeli,
Sarah Bernhardt--had discovered that advertising would go a long way; but Marcus O'Mally discovered
that in America it would go all the way--as far as you wished to pay its passage. Any human
countenance, plastered in three-sheet posters from sea to sea, would be revered by the American
people. The strangest thing was that the owners of these grave countenances, staring at their
own faces on newsstands and billboards, fell to venerating themselves; and even he, O'Mally,
was more or less constrained by these reputations that he had created out of cheap paper and
cheap ink.

Constraint was the last thing O'Mally liked. The most engaging and unusual thing about the
man was that he couldn't be fooled by the success of his own methods, and no amount of "recognition"
could make a stuffed shirt of him. No matter how much he was advertised as a great medicine-man
in the councils of the nation, he knew that he was a born gambler and a soldier of fortune.
He left his dignified office to take care of itself for a good many months of the year while
he played about on the outskirts of social order. He liked being a great man from the East
in rough-and-tumble Western cities where he had once been merely an unconsidered spender.

O'Mally's long absences constituted one of the supreme advantages of Ardessa Devine's position.
When he was at his post her duties were not heavy, but when he was giving balls in Goldfield,
Nevada, she lived an ideal life. She came to the office every day, indeed, to forward such
of O'Mally's letters as she thought best, to attend to his club notices and tradesmen's bills,
and to taste the sense of her high connections. The great men of the staff were all about her,
as contemplative as Buddhas in their private offices, each meditating upon the particular trust
or form of vice confided to his care. Thus surrounded, Ardessa had a pleasant sense of being
at the heart of things. It was like a mental massage, exercise without exertion. She read and
she embroidered. Her room was pleasant, and she liked to be seen at ladylike tasks and to feel
herself a graceful contrast to the crude girls in the advertising and circulation departments
across the hall. The younger stenographers, who had to get through with the enormous office
correspondence, and who rushed about from one editor to another with wire baskets full of letters,
made faces as they passed Ardessa's door and saw her cool and cloistered, daintily plying her
needle. But no matter how hard the other stenographers were driven, no one, not even one of
the five oracles of the staff, dared dictate so much as a letter to Ardessa. Like a sultan's
bride, she was inviolate in her lord's absence; she had to be kept for him.

Naturally the other young women employed in "The Outcry" offices disliked Miss Devine. They
were all competent girls, trained in the exacting methods of modern business, and they had
to make good every day in the week, had to get through with a great deal of work or lose their
position. O'Mally's private secretary was a mystery to them. Her exemptions and privileges,
her patronizing remarks, formed an exhaustless subject of conversation at the lunch-hour. Ardessa
had, indeed, as they knew she must have, a kind of "purchase" on her employer.

When O'Mally first came to New York to break into publicity, he engaged Miss Devine upon the
recommendation of the editor whose ailing publication he bought and rechristened. That editor
was a conservative, scholarly gentleman of the old school, who was retiring because he felt
out of place in the world of brighter, breezier magazines that had been flowering since the
new century came in. He believed that in this vehement world young O'Mally would make himself
heard and that Miss Devine's training in an editorial office would be of use to him.

When O'Mally first sat down at a desk to be an editor, all the cards that were brought in looked
pretty much alike to him. Ardessa was at his elbow. She had long been steeped in literary distinctions
and in the social distinctions which used to count for much more than they do now. She knew
all the great men, all the nephews and clients of great men. She knew which must be seen, which
must be made welcome, and which could safely be sent away. She could give O'Mally on the instant
the former rating in magazine offices of nearly every name that was brought in to him. She
could give him an idea of the man's connections, of the price his work commanded, and insinuate
whether he ought to be met with the old punctiliousness or with the new joviality. She was
useful in explaining to her employer the significance of various invitations, and the standing
of clubs and associations. At first she was virtually the social mentor of the bullet-headed
young Westerner who wanted to break into everything, the solitary person about the office of
the humming new magazine who knew anything about the editorial traditions of the eighties and
nineties which, antiquated as they now were, gave an editor, as O'Mally said, a background.

Despite her indolence, Ardessa was useful to O'Mally as a social reminder. She was the card
catalogue of his ever-changing personal relations. O'Mally went in for everything and got tired
of everything; that was why he made a good editor. After he was through with people, Ardessa
was very skilful in covering his retreat. She read and answered the letters of admirers who
had begun to bore him. When great authors, who had been dined and fêted the month before, were
suddenly left to cool their heels in the reception-room, thrown upon the suave hospitality
of the grand old man at the desk, it was Ardessa who went out and made soothing and plausible
explanations as to why the editor could not see them. She was the brake that checked the too-eager
neophyte, the emollient that eased the severing of relationships, the gentle extinguisher of
the lights that failed. When there were no longer messages of hope and cheer to be sent to
ardent young writers and reformers, Ardessa delivered, as sweetly as possible, whatever messages
were left.

In handling these people with whom O'Mally was quite through, Ardessa had gradually developed
an industry which was immensely gratifying to her own vanity. Not only did she not crush them;
she even fostered them a little. She continued to advise them in the reception-room and "personally"
received their manuscripts long after O'Mally had declared that he would never read another
line they wrote. She let them outline their plans for stories and articles to her, promising
to bring these suggestions to the editor's attention. She denied herself to nobody, was gracious
even to the Shakspere-Bacon man, the perpetual-motion man, the travel-article man, the ghosts
which haunt every magazine office. The writers who had had their happy hour of O'Mally's favor
kept feeling that Ardessa might reinstate them. She answered their letters of inquiry in her
most polished and elegant style, and even gave them hints as to the subjects in which the restless
editor was or was not interested at the moment: she feared it would be useless to send him
an article on "How to Trap Lions," because he had just bought an article on "Elephant-Shooting
in Majuba Land," etc.

So when O'Mally plunged into his office at 11:30 on this, the fourth day of May, having just
got back from three-days' fishing, he found Ardessa in the reception-room, surrounded by a
little court of discards. This was annoying, for he always wanted his stenographer at once.
Telling the office boy to give her a hint that she was needed, he threw off his hat and topcoat
and began to race through the pile of letters Ardessa had put on his desk. When she entered,
he did not wait for her polite inquiries about his trip, but broke in at once.

"What is that fellow who writes about phossy jaw still hanging round here for? I don't want
any articles on phossy jaw, and if I did, I wouldn't want his."

"He has just sold an article on the match industry to 'The New Age,' Mr. O'Mally," Ardessa
replied as she took her seat at the editor's right.

"Why does he have to come and tell us about it? We've nothing to do with 'The New Age.' And
that prison-reform guy, what's he loafing about for?"

Ardessa bridled.

"You remember, Mr. O'Mally, he brought letters of introduction from Governor Harper, the reform
Governor of Mississippi."

O'Mally jumped up, kicking over his waste-basket in his impatience.

"That was months ago. I went through his letters and went through him, too. He hasn't got anything
we want. I've been through with Governor Harper a long while. We're asleep at the switch in
here. And let me tell you, if I catch sight of that causes-of-blindness-in-babies woman around
here again, I'll do something violent. Clear them out, Miss Devine! Clear them out! We need
a traffic policeman in this office. Have you got that article on 'Stealing Our National Water
Power' ready for me?"

"Mr. Gerrard took it back to make modifications. He gave it to me at noon on Saturday, just
before the office closed. I will have it ready for you to-morrow morning, Mr. O'Mally, if you
have not too many letters for me this afternoon," Ardessa replied pointedly.

"Holy Mike!" muttered O'Mally, "we need a traffic policeman for the staff, too. Gerrard's modified
that thing half a dozen times already. Why don't they get accurate information in the first place?"

He began to dictate his morning mail, walking briskly up and down the floor by way of giving
his stenographer an energetic example. The Russian commander, however, made no sign of surrender;
but the admirals, seeing that his fire had ceased, and further defence was unavailing, hoisted
the white flag at 1.35 P.M., upon which the works were given up on honorable terms."
 He knew his correspondence was not enough to keep her busy, so when he was
in town he made her type his own breezy editorials and various articles by members of his staff.

Transcribing editorial copy is always laborious, and the only way to make it easy is to farm
it out. This Ardessa was usually clever enough to do. When she returned to her own room after
O'Mally had gone out to lunch, Ardessa rang for an office boy and said languidly, "James, call
Becky, please."

In a moment a thin, tense-faced Hebrew girl of eighteen or nineteen came rushing in, carrying
a wire basket full of typewritten sheets. She was as gaunt as a plucked spring chicken, and
her cheap, gaudy clothes might have been thrown on her. She looked as if she were running to
catch a train and in mortal dread of missing it. While Miss Devine examined the pages in the
basket, Becky stood with her shoulders drawn up and her elbows drawn in, apparently trying
to hide herself in her insufficient open-work waist. Her wild, black eyes followed Miss Devine's
hands desperately. Ardessa sighed.

"This seems to be very smeary copy again, Becky. You don't keep your mind on your work, and
so you have to erase continually."

Becky spoke up in wailing self-vindication.

"It ain't that, Miss Devine. It's so many hard words he uses that I have to be at the dictionary
all the time. Look! Look!" She produced a bunch of manuscript faintly scrawled in pencil, and
thrust it under Ardessa's eyes. "He don't write out the words at all. He just begins a word,
and then makes waves for you to guess."

"I see you haven't always guessed correctly, Becky," said Ardessa, with a weary smile. "There
are a great many words here that would surprise Mr. Gerrard, I am afraid."

"And the inserts," Becky persisted. "How is anybody to tell where they go, Miss Devine? It's
mostly inserts; see, all over the top and sides and back."

Ardessa turned her head away.

"Don't claw the pages like that, Becky. You make me nervous. Mr. Gerrard has not time to dot
his i's and cross his t's. That is what we keep copyists for. I will correct these sheets for
you,--it would be terrible if Mr. O'Mally saw them,--and then you can copy them over again.
It must be done by to-morrow morning, so you may have to work late. See that your hands are
clean and dry, and then you will not smear it."

"Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Miss Devine. Will you tell the janitor, please, it's all right if I
have to stay? He was cross because I was here Saturday afternoon doing this. He said it was
a holiday, and when everybody else was gone I ought to--"

"That will do, Becky. Yes, I will speak to the janitor for you. You may go to lunch now."

Becky turned on one heel and then swung back.

"Miss Devine," she said anxiously, "will it be all right if I get white shoes for now?"

Ardessa gave her kind consideration.

"For office wear, you mean? No, Becky. With only one pair, you could not keep them properly
clean; and black shoes are much less conspicuous. Tan, if you prefer."

Becky looked down at her feet. They were too large, and her skirt was as much too short as
her legs were too long.

"Nearly all the girls I know wear white shoes to business," she pleaded.

"They are probably little girls who work in factories or department stores, and that is quite
another matter. Since you raise the question, Becky, I ought to speak to you about your new
waist. Don't wear it to the office again, please. Those cheap open-work waists are not appropriate
in an office like this. They are all very well for little chorus girls."

"But Miss Kalski wears expensive waists to business more open than this, and jewelry--"

Ardessa interrupted. Her face grew hard.

"Miss Kalski," she said coldly, "works for the business department. You are employed in the
editorial offices. There is a great difference. You see, Becky, I might have to call you in
here at any time when a scientist or a great writer or the president of a university is here
talking over editorial matters, and such clothes as you have on to-day would make a bad impression.
Nearly all our connections are with important people of that kind, and we ought to be well,
but quietly, dressed."

"Yes, Miss Devine. Thank you," Becky gasped and disappeared. Heaven knew she had no need to
be further impressed with the greatness of "The Outcry" office. During the year and a half
she had been there she had never ceased to tremble. She knew the prices all the authors got
as well as Miss Devine did, and everything seemed to her to be done on a magnificent scale.
She hadn't a good memory for long technical words, but she never forgot dates or prices or
initials or telephone numbers.

Becky felt that her job depended on Miss Devine, and she was so glad to have it that she scarcely
realized she was being bullied. Besides, she was grateful for all that she had learned from
Ardessa; Ardessa had taught her to do most of the things that she was supposed to do herself.
Becky wanted to learn, she had to learn; that was the train she was always running for. Her
father, Isaac Tietelbaum, the tailor, who pressed Miss Devine's skirts and kept her ladylike
suits in order, had come to his client two years ago and told her he had a bright girl just
out of a commercial high school. He implored Ardessa to find some office position for his daughter.
Ardessa told an appealing story to O'Mally, and brought Becky into the office, at a salary
of six dollars a week, to help with the copying and to learn business routine. When Becky first
came she was as ignorant as a young savage. She was rapid at her shorthand and typing, but
a Kafir girl would have known as much about the English language. Nobody ever wanted to learn
more than Becky. She fairly wore the dictionary out. She dug up her old school grammar and
worked over it at night. She faithfully mastered Miss Devine's fussy system of punctuation.

There were eight children at home, younger than Becky, and they were all eager to learn. They
wanted to get their mother out of the three dark rooms behind the tailor shop and to move into
a flat up-stairs, where they could, as Becky said, "live private." The young Tietelbaums doubted
their father's ability to bring this change about, for the more things he declared himself
ready to do in his window placards, the fewer were brought to him to be done. "Dyeing, Cleaning,
Ladies' Furs Remodeled"--it did no good.

Rebecca was out to "improve herself," as her father had told her she must. Ardessa had easy
way with her. It was one of those rare relationships from which both persons profit. The more
Becky could learn from Ardessa, the happier she was; and the more Ardessa could unload on Becky,
the greater was her contentment. She easily broke Becky of the gum-chewing habit, taught her
to walk quietly, to efface herself at the proper moment, and to hold her tongue. Becky had
been raised to eight dollars a week; but she didn't care half so much about that as she did
about her own increasing efficiency. The more work Miss Devine handed over to her the happier
she was, and the faster she was able to eat it up. She tested and tried herself in every possible
way. She now had full confidence that she would surely one day be a high-priced stenographer,
a real "business woman."

Becky would have corrupted a really industrious person, but a bilious temperament like Ardessa's
couldn't make even a feeble stand against such willingness. Ardessa had grown soft and had
lost the knack of turning out work. Sometimes, in her importance and serenity, she shivered.
What if O'Mally should die, and she were thrust out into the world to work in competition with
the brazen, competent young women she saw about her everywhere? She believed herself indispensable,
but she knew that in such a mischanceful world as this the very powers of darkness might rise
to separate her from this pearl among jobs.

When Becky came in from lunch she went down the long hall to the wash-room, where all the little
girls who worked in the advertising and circulation departments kept their hats and jackets.
There were shelves and shelves of bright spring hats, piled on top of one another, all as stiff
as sheet-iron and trimmed with gay flowers. At the marble wash-stand stood Rena Kalski, the
right bower of the business manager, polishing her diamond rings with a nail-brush.

"Hullo, kid," she called over her shoulder to Becky. "I've got a ticket for you for Thursday
afternoon."

Becky's black eyes glowed, but the strained look on her face drew tighter than ever.

"I'll never ask her, Miss Kalski," she said rapidly. "I don't dare. I have to stay late to-night
again; and I know she'd be hard to please after, if I was to try to get off on a week-day.
I thank you, Miss Kalski, but I'd better not."

Miss Kalski laughed. She was a slender young Hebrew, handsome in an impudent, Tenderloin sort
of way, with a small head, reddish-brown almond eyes, a trifle tilted, a rapacious mouth, and
a beautiful chin.

"Ain't you under that woman's thumb, though! Call her bluff. She isn't half the prima donna
she thinks she is. On my side of the hall we know who's who about this place."

The business and editorial departments of "The Outcry" were separated by a long corridor and
a great contempt. Miss Kalski dried her rings with tissue-paper and studied them with an appraising
eye.

"Well, since you're such a 'fraidy-calf,'" she went on, "maybe I can get a rise out of her
myself. Now I've got you a ticket out of that shirt-front, I want you to go. I'll drop in on
Devine this afternoon."

When Miss Kalski went back to her desk in the business manager's private office, she turned
to him familiarly, but not impertinently.

"Mr. Henderson, I want to send a kid over in the editorial stenographers' to the Palace Thursday
afternoon. She's a nice kid, only she's scared out of her skin all the time. Miss Devine's
her boss, and she'll be just mean enough not to let the young one off. Would you say a word
to her?"

The business manager lit a cigar.

"I'm not saying words to any of the high-brows over there. Try it out with Devine yourself.
You're not bashful."

Miss Kalski shrugged her shoulders and smiled.

"Oh, very well." She serpentined out of the room and crossed the Rubicon into the editorial
offices. She found Ardessa typing O'Mally's letters and wearing a pained expression.

"Good afternoon, Miss Devine," she said carelessly. "Can we borrow Becky over there for Thursday
afternoon? We're short."

Miss Devine looked piqued and tilted her head.

"I don't think it's customary, Miss Kalski, for the business department to use our people.
We never have girls enough here to do the work. Of course if Mr. Henderson feels justified--"

"Thanks awfully, Miss Devine,"--Miss Kalski interrupted her with the perfectly smooth, good-natured
tone which never betrayed a hint of the scorn every line of her sinuous figure expressed,--"I
will tell Mr. Henderson. Perhaps we can do something for you some day." Whether this was a
threat, a kind wish, or an insinuation, no mortal could have told. Miss Kalski's face was always
suggesting insolence without being quite insolent. As she returned to her own domain she met
the cashier's head clerk in the hall. "That Devine woman's a crime," she murmured. The head
clerk laughed tolerantly.

That afternoon as Miss Kalski was leaving the office at 5:15, on her way down the corridor
she heard a typewriter clicking away in the empty, echoing editorial offices. She looked in,
and found Becky bending forward over the machine as if she were about to swallow it.

"Hello, kid. Do you sleep with that?" she called. She walked up to Becky and glanced at her
copy. "What do you let 'em keep you up nights over that stuff for?" she asked contemptuously.
"The world wouldn't suffer if that stuff never got printed."

Rebecca looked up wildly. Not even Miss Kalski's French pansy hat or her ear-rings and landscape
veil could loosen Becky's tenacious mind from Mr. Gerrard's article on water power. She scarcely
knew what Miss Kalski had said to her, certainly not what she meant.

"But I must make progress already, Miss Kalski," she panted.

Miss Kalski gave her low, siren laugh.

"I should say you must!" she ejaculated.

       *       *       *       *       *

Ardessa decided to take her vacation in June, and she arranged that Miss Milligan should do
O'Mally's work while she was away. Miss Milligan was blunt and noisy, rapid and inaccurate.
It would be just as well for O'Mally to work with a coarse instrument for a time; he would
be more appreciative, perhaps, of certain qualities to which he had seemed insensible of late.
Ardessa was to leave for East Hampton on Sunday, and she spent Saturday morning instructing
her substitute as to the state of the correspondence. At noon O'Mally burst into her room.
All the morning he had been closeted with a new writer of mystery-stories just over from England.

"Can you stay and take my letters this afternoon, Miss Devine? You 're not leaving until to-morrow."

Ardessa pouted, and tilted her head at the angle he was tired of.

"I'm sorry, Mr. O'Mally, but I've left all my shopping for this afternoon. I think Becky Tietelbaum
could do them for you. I will tell her to be careful."

"Oh, all right." O'Mally bounced out with a reflection of Ardessa's disdainful expression on
his face. Saturday afternoon was always a half-holiday, to be sure, but since she had weeks
of freedom when he was away--However--

At two o'clock Becky Tietelbaum appeared at his door, clad in the sober office suit which Miss
Devine insisted she should wear, her note-book in her hand, and so frightened that her fingers
were cold and her lips were pale. She had never taken dictation from the editor before. It
was a great and terrifying occasion.

"Sit down," he said encouragingly. He began dictating while he shook from his bag the manuscripts
he had snatched away from the amazed English author that morning. Presently he looked up.

"Do I go too fast?"

"No, sir," Becky found strength to say.

At the end of an hour he told her to go and type as many of the letters as she could while
he went over the bunch of stuff he had torn from the Englishman. He was with the Hindu detective
in an opium den in Shanghai when Becky returned and placed a pile of papers on his desk.

"How many?" he asked, without looking up.

"All you gave me, sir."

"All, so soon? Wait a minute and let me see how many mistakes." He went over the letters rapidly,
signing them as he read. "They seem to be all right. I thought you were the girl that made
so many mistakes."

Rebecca was never too frightened to vindicate herself.

"Mr. O'Mally, sir, I don't make mistakes with letters. It's only copying the articles that
have so many long words, and when the writing isn't plain, like Mr. Gerrard's. I never make
many mistakes with Mr. Johnson's articles, or with yours I don't."

O'Mally wheeled round in his chair, looked with curiosity at her long, tense face, her black
eyes, and straight brows.

"Oh, so you sometimes copy articles, do you? How does that happen?"

"Yes, sir. Always Miss Devine gives me the articles to do. It's good practice for me."

"I see." O'Mally shrugged his shoulders. He was thinking that he could get a rise out of the
whole American public any day easier than he could get a rise out of Ardessa. "What editorials
of mine have you copied lately, for instance?"

Rebecca blazed out at him, reciting rapidly:

"Oh, 'A Word about the Rosenbaums,' 'Useless Navy-Yards,' 'Who Killed Cock Robin'--"

"Wait a minute." O'Mally checked her flow. "What was that one about--Cock Robin?"

"It was all about why the secretary of the interior dismissed--"

"All right, all right. Copy those letters, and put them down the chute as you go out. Come
in here for a minute on Monday morning."

Becky hurried home to tell her father that she had taken the editor's letters and had made
no mistakes. On Monday she learned that she was to do O'Mally's work for a few days. He disliked
Miss Milligan, and he was annoyed with Ardessa for trying to put her over on him when there
was better material at hand. With Rebecca he got on very well; she was impersonal, unreproachful,
and she fairly panted for work. Everything was done almost before he told her what he wanted.
She raced ahead with him; it was like riding a good modern bicycle after pumping along on an
old hard tire.

On the day before Miss Devine's return O'Mally strolled over for a chat with the business office.

"Henderson, your people are taking vacations now, I suppose? Could you use an extra girl?"

"If it's that thin black one, I can."

O'Mally gave him a wise smile.

"It isn't. To be honest, I want to put one over on you. I want you to take Miss Devine over
here for a while and speed her up. I can't do anything. She's got the upper hand of me. I don't
want to fire her, you understand, but she makes my life too difficult. It's my fault, of course.
I've pampered her. Give her a chance over here; maybe she'll come back. You can be firm with
'em, can't you?"

Henderson glanced toward the desk where Miss Kalski's lightning eye was skimming over the printing-house
bills that he was supposed to verify himself.

"Well, if I can't, I know who can," he replied, with a chuckle.

"Exactly," O'Mally agreed. "I'm counting on the force of Miss Kalski's example. Miss Devine's
all right, Miss Kalski, but she needs regular exercise. She owes it to her complexion. I can't
discipline people."

Miss Kalski's only reply was a low, indulgent laugh.

O'Mally braced himself on the morning of Ardessa's return. He told the waiter at his club to
bring him a second pot of coffee and to bring it hot. He was really afraid of her. When she
presented herself at his office at 10:30 he complimented her upon her tan and asked about her
vacation. Then he broke the news to her.

"We want to make a few temporary changes about here, Miss Devine, for the summer months. The
business department is short of help. Henderson is going to put Miss Kalski on the books for
a while to figure out some economies for him, and he is going to take you over. Meantime I'll
get Becky broken in so that she could take your work if you were sick or anything."

Ardessa drew herself up.

"I've not been accustomed to commercial work, Mr. O'Mally. I've no interest in it, and I don't
care to brush up in it."

"Brushing up is just what we need, Miss Devine." O'Mally began tramping about his room expansively.
"I'm going to brush everybody up. I'm going to brush a few people out; but I want you to stay
with us, of course. You belong here. Don't be hasty now. Go to your room and think it over."

Ardessa was beginning to cry, and O'Mally was afraid he would lose his nerve. He looked out
of the window at a new sky-scraper that was building, while she retired without a word.

At her own desk Ardessa sat down breathless and trembling. The one thing she had never doubted
was her unique value to O'Mally. She had, as she told herself, taught him everything. She would
say a few things to Becky Tietelbaum, and to that pigeon-breasted tailor, her father, too!
The worst of it was that Ardessa had herself brought it all about; she could see that clearly
now. She had carefully trained and qualified her successor. Why had she ever civilized Becky?
Why had she taught her manners and deportment, broken her of the gum-chewing habit, and made
her presentable? In her original state O'Mally would never have put up with her, no matter
what her ability.

Ardessa told herself that O'Mally was notoriously fickle; Becky amused him, but he would soon
find out her limitations. The wise thing, she knew, was to humor him; but it seemed to her
that she could not swallow her pride. Ardessa grew yellower within the hour. Over and over
in her mind she bade O'Mally a cold adieu and minced out past the grand old man at the desk
for the last time. But each exit she rehearsed made her feel sorrier for herself. She thought
over all the offices she knew, but she realized that she could never meet their inexorable
standards of efficiency.

While she was bitterly deliberating, O'Mally himself wandered in, rattling his keys nervously
in his pocket. He shut the door behind him.

"Now, you're going to come through with this all right, aren't you, Miss Devine? I want Henderson
to get over the notion that my people over here are stuck up and think the business department
are old shoes. That's where we get our money from, as he often reminds me. You'll be the best-paid
girl over there; no reduction, of course. You don't want to go wandering off to some new office
where personality doesn't count for anything." He sat down confidentially on the edge of her
desk. "Do you, now, Miss Devine?"

Ardessa simpered tearfully as she replied.

"Mr. O'Mally," she brought out, "you'll soon find that Becky is not the sort of girl to meet
people for you when you are away. I don't see how you can think of letting her."

"That's one thing I want to change, Miss Devine. You're too soft-handed with the has-beens
and the never-was-ers. You're too much of a lady for this rough game. Nearly everybody who
comes in here wants to sell us a gold-brick, and you treat them as if they were bringing in
wedding presents. Becky is as rough as sandpaper, and she'll clear out a lot of dead wood."
O'Mally rose, and tapped Ardessa's shrinking shoulder. "Now, be a sport and go through with
it, Miss Devine. I'll see that you don't lose. Henderson thinks you'll refuse to do his work,
so I want you to get moved in there before he comes back from lunch. I've had a desk put in
his office for you. Miss Kalski is in the bookkeeper's room half the time now."

Rena Kalski was amazed that afternoon when a line of office boys entered, carrying Miss Devine's
effects, and when Ardessa herself coldly followed them. After Ardessa had arranged her desk,
Miss Kalski went over to her and told her about some matters of routine very good-naturedly.
Ardessa looked pretty badly shaken up, and Rena bore no grudges.

"When you want the dope on the correspondence with the paper men, don't bother to look it up.
I've got it all in my head, and I can save time for you. If he wants you to go over the printing
bills every week, you'd better let me help you with that for a while. I can stay almost any
afternoon. It's quite a trick to figure out the plates and over-time charges till you get used
to it. I've worked out a quick method that saves trouble."

When Henderson came in at three he found Ardessa, chilly, but civil, awaiting his instructions.
He knew she disapproved of his tastes and his manners, but he didn't mind. What interested
and amused him was that Rena Kalski, whom he had always thought as cold-blooded as an adding-machine,
seemed to be making a hair-mattress of herself to break Ardessa's fall.

At five o'clock, when Ardessa rose to go, the business manager said breezily:

"See you at nine in the morning, Miss Devine. We begin on the stroke."

Ardessa faded out of the door, and Miss Kalski's slender back squirmed with amusement.

"I never thought to hear such words spoken," she admitted; "but I guess she'll limber up all
right. The atmosphere is bad over there. They get moldy."

       *       *       *       *       *

After the next monthly luncheon of the heads of departments, O'Mally said to Henderson, as
he feed the coat-boy:

"By the way, how are you making it with the bartered bride?"

Henderson smashed on his Panama as he said:

"Any time you want her back, don't be delicate."

But O'Mally shook his red head and laughed.

"Oh, I'm no Indian giver!"

                                             Century, May 1918

Her Boss

Paul Wanning opened the front door of his house in Orange, closed it softly behind him, and
stood looking about the hall as he drew off his gloves.

Nothing was changed there since last night, and yet he stood gazing about him with an interest
which a long-married man does not often feel in his own reception hall. The rugs, the two pillars,
the Spanish tapestry chairs, were all the same. The Venus di Medici stood on her column as
usual and there, at the end of the hall (opposite the front door), was the full-length portrait
of Mrs. Wanning, maturely blooming forth in an evening gown, signed with the name of a French
painter who seemed purposely to have made his signature indistinct. Though the signature was
largely what one paid for, one couldn't ask him to do it over.

In the dining room the colored man was moving about the table set for dinner, under the electric
cluster. The candles had not yet been lighted. Wanning watched him with a homesick feeling
in his heart. They had had Sam a long while, twelve years, now. His warm hall, the lighted
dining-room, the drawing room where only the flicker of the wood fire played upon the shining
surfaces of many objects--they seemed to Wanning like a haven of refuge. It had never occurred
to him that his house was too full of things. He often said, and he believed, that the women
of his household had "perfect taste." He had paid for these objects, sometimes with difficulty,
but always with pride. He carried a heavy life-insurance and permitted himself to spend most
of the income from a good law practise. He wished, during his life-time, to enjoy the benefits
of his wife's discriminating extravagance.

Yesterday Wanning's doctor had sent him to a specialist. Today the specialist, after various
laboratory tests, had told him most disconcerting things about the state of very necessary,
but hitherto wholly uninteresting, organs of his body.

The information pointed to something incredible; insinuated that his residence in this house
was only temporary; that he, whose time was so full, might have to leave not only his house
and his office and his club, but a world with which he was extremely well satisfied--the only
world he knew anything about.

Wanning unbuttoned his overcoat, but did not take it off. He stood folding his muffler slowly
and carefully. What he did not understand was, how he could go while other people stayed. Sam
would be moving about the table like this, Mrs. Wanning and her daughters would be dressing
upstairs, when he would not be coming home to dinner any more; when he would not, indeed, be
dining anywhere.

Sam, coming to turn on the parlor lights, saw Wanning and stepped behind him to take his coat.

"Good evening, Mr. Wanning, sah, excuse me. You entahed so quietly, sah, I didn't heah you."

The master of the house slipped out of his coat and went languidly upstairs.

He tapped at the door of his wife's room, which stood ajar.

"Come in, Paul," she called from her dressing table.

She was seated, in a violet dressing gown, giving the last touches to her coiffure, both arms
lifted. They were firm and white, like her neck and shoulders. She was a handsome woman of
fifty-five,--still a woman, not an old person, Wanning told himself, as he kissed her cheek.
She was heavy in figure, to be sure, but she had kept, on the whole, presentable outlines.
Her complexion was good, and she wore less false hair than either of her daughters.

Wanning himself was five years older, but his sandy hair did not show the gray in it, and since
his mustache had begun to grow white he kept it clipped so short that it was unobtrusive. His
fresh skin made him look younger than he was. Not long ago he had overheard the stenographers
in his law office discussing the ages of their employers. They had put him down at fifty, agreeing
that his two partners must be considerably older than he--which was not the case. Wanning had
an especially kindly feeling for the little new girl, a copyist, who had exclaimed that "Mr.
Wanning couldn't be fifty; he seemed so boyish!"

Wanning lingered behind his wife, looking at her in the mirror.

"Well, did you tell the girls, Julia?" he asked, trying to speak casually.

Mrs. Wanning looked up and met his eyes in the glass. "The girls?"

She noticed a strange expression come over his face.

"About your health, you mean? Yes, dear, but I tried not to alarm them. They feel dreadfully.
I'm going to have a talk with Dr. Seares myself. These specialists are all alarmists, and I've
often heard of his frightening people."

She rose and took her husband's arm, drawing him toward the fireplace.

"You are not going to let this upset you, Paul? If you take care of yourself, everything will
come out all right. You have always been so strong. One has only to look at you."

"Did you," Wanning asked, "say anything to Harold?"

"Yes, of course. I saw him in town today, and he agrees with me that Seares draws the worst
conclusions possible. He says even the young men are always being told the most terrifying
things. Usually they laugh at the doctors and do as they please. You certainly don't look like
a sick man, and you don't feel like one, do you?"

She patted his shoulder, smiled at him encouragingly, and rang for the maid to come and hook
her dress.

When the maid appeared at the door, Wanning went out through the bathroom to his own sleeping
chamber. He was too much dispirited to put on a dinner coat, though such remissness was always
noticed. He sat down and waited for the sound of the gong, leaving his door open, on the chance
that perhaps one of his daughters would come in.

When Wanning went down to dinner he found his wife already at her chair, and the table laid
for four.

"Harold," she explained, "is not coming home. He has to attend a first night in town."

A moment later their two daughters entered, obviously "dressed." They both wore earrings and
masses of hair. The daughters' names were Roma and Florence,--Roma, Firenze, one of the young
men who came to the house often, but not often enough, had called them. Tonight they were going
to a rehearsal of "The Dances of the Nations,"--a benefit performance in which Miss Roma was
to lead the Spanish dances, her sister the Grecian.

The elder daughter had often been told that her name suited her admirably. She looked, indeed,
as we are apt to think the unrestrained beauties of later Rome must have looked,--but as their
portrait busts emphatically declare they did not. Her head was massive, her lips full and crimson,
her eyes large and heavy-lidded, her forehead low. At costume balls and in living pictures
she was always Semiramis, or Poppea, or Theodora. Barbaric accessories brought out something
cruel and even rather brutal in her handsome face. The men who were attracted to her were somehow
afraid of her.

Florence was slender, with a long, graceful neck, a restless head, and a flexible mouth--discontent
lurked about the corners of it. Her shoulders were pretty, but her neck and arms were too thin.
Roma was always struggling to keep within a certain weight--her chin and upper arms grew persistently
more solid--and Florence was always striving to attain a certain weight. Wanning used sometimes
to wonder why these disconcerting fluctuations could not go the other way; why Roma could not
melt away as easily as did her sister, who had to be sent to Palm Beach to save the precious
pounds.

"I don't see why you ever put Rickie Allen in charge of the English country dances," Florence
said to her sister, as they sat down. "He knows the figures, of course, but he has no real style."

Roma looked annoyed. Rickie Allen was one of the men who came to the house almost often enough.

"He is absolutely to be depended upon, that's why," she said firmly.

"I think he is just right for it, Florence," put in Mrs. Wanning. "It's remarkable he should
feel that he can give up the time; such a busy man. He must be very much interested in the
movement."

Florence's lip curled drolly under her soup spoon. She shot an amused glance at her mother's
dignity.

"Nothing doing," her keen eyes seemed to say.

Though Florence was nearly thirty and her sister a little beyond, there was, seriously, nothing
doing. With so many charms and so much preparation, they never, as Florence vulgarly said,
quite pulled it off. They had been rushed, time and again, and Mrs. Wanning had repeatedly
steeled herself to bear the blow. But the young men went to follow a career in Mexico or the
Philippines, or moved to Yonkers, and escaped without a mortal wound.

Roma turned graciously to her father.

"I met Mr. Lane at the Holland House today, where I was lunching with the Burtons, father.
He asked about you, and when I told him you were not so well as usual, he said he would call
you up. He wants to tell you about some doctor he discovered in Iowa, who cures everything
with massage and hot water. It sounds freakish, but Mr. Lane is a very clever man, isn't he?"

"Very," assented Wanning.

"I should think he must be!" sighed Mrs. Wanning. "How in the world did he make all that money,
Paul? He didn't seem especially promising years ago, when we used to see so much of them."

"Corporation business. He's attorney for the P. L. and G.," murmured her husband.

"What a pile he must have!" Florence watched the old negro's slow movements with restless eyes.
"Here is Jenny, a Contessa, with a glorious palace in Genoa that her father must have bought
her. Surely Aldrini had nothing. Have you seen the baby count's pictures, Roma? They're very
cunning. I should think you'd go to Genoa and visit Jenny."

"We must arrange that, Roma. It's such an opportunity." Though Mrs. Wanning addressed her daughter,
she looked at her husband. "You would get on so well among their friends. When Count Aldrini
was here you spoke Italian much better than poor Jenny. I remember when we entertained him,
he could scarcely say anything to her at all."

Florence tried to call up an answering flicker of amusement upon her sister's calm, well-bred
face. She thought her mother was rather outdoing herself tonight,--since Aldrini had at least
managed to say the one important thing to Jenny, somehow, somewhere. Jenny Lane had been Roma's
friend and schoolmate, and the Count was an ephemeral hope in Orange. Mrs. Wanning was one
of the first matrons to declare that she had no prejudices against foreigners, and at the dinners
that were given for the Count, Roma was always put next him to act as interpreter.

Roma again turned to her father.

"If I were you, dear, I would let Mr. Lane tell me about his doctor. New discoveries are often
made by queer people."

Roma's voice was low and sympathetic; she never lost her dignity.

Florence asked if she might have her coffee in her room, while she dashed off a note, and she
ran upstairs humming "Bright Lights" and wondering how she was going to stand her family until
the summer scattering. Why could Roma never throw off her elegant reserve and call things by
their names? She sometimes thought she might like her sister, if she would only come out in
the open and howl about her disappointments.

Roma, drinking her coffee deliberately, asked her father if they might have the car early,
as they wanted to pick up Mr. Allen and Mr. Rydberg on their way to rehearsal.

Wanning said certainly. Heaven knew he was not stingy about his car, though he could never
quite forget that in his day it was the young men who used to call for the girls when they
went to rehearsals.

"You are going with us, Mother?" Roma asked as they rose.

"I think so dear. Your father will want to go to bed early, and I shall sleep better if I go
out. I am going to town tomorrow to pour tea for Harold. We must get him some new silver, Paul.
I am quite ashamed of his spoons."

Harold, the only son, was a playwright--as yet "unproduced"--and he had a studio in Washington
Square.

A half-hour later, Wanning was alone in his library. He would not permit himself to feel aggrieved.
What was more commendable than a mother's interest in her children's pleasures? Moreover, it
was his wife's way of following things up, of never letting die grass grow under her feet,
that had helped to push him along in the world. She was more ambitious than he,--that had been
good for him. He was naturally indolent, and Julia's childlike desire to possess material objects,
to buy what other people were buying, had been the spur that made him go after business. It
had, moreover, made his house the attractive place he believed it to be.

"Suppose," his wife sometimes said to him when the bills came in from Céleste or Mme. Blanche,
"suppose you had homely daughters; how would you like that?"

He wouldn't have liked it. When he went anywhere with his three ladies, Wanning always felt
very well done by. He had no complaint to make about them, or about anything. That was why
it seemed so unreasonable--He felt along his back incredulously with his hand. Harold, of course,
was a trial; but among all his business friends, he knew scarcely one who had a promising boy.

The house was so still that Wanning could hear a faint, metallic tinkle from the butler's pantry.
Old Sam was washing up the silver, which he put away himself every night.

Wanning rose and walked aimlessly down the hall and out through the dining-room.

"Any Apollinaris on ice, Sam? I'm not feeling very well tonight."

The old colored man dried his hands.

"Yessah, Mistah Wanning. Have a little rye with it, sah?"

"No, thank you, Sam. That's one of the things I can't do any more. I've been to see a big doctor
in the city, and he tells me there's something seriously wrong with me. My kidneys have sort
of gone back on me."

It was a satisfaction to Wanning to name the organ that had betrayed him, while all the rest
of him was so sound.

Sam was immediately interested. He shook his grizzled head and looked full of wisdom.

"Don't seem like a gen'leman of such a temperate life ought to have anything wrong thar, sah."

"No, it doesn't, does it?"

Wanning leaned against the china closet and talked to Sam for nearly half an hour. The specialist
who condemned him hadn't seemed half so much interested. There was not a detail about the examination
and the laboratory tests in which Sam did not show the deepest concern. He kept asking Wanning
if he could remember "straining himself" when he was a young man.

"I've knowed a strain like that to sleep in a man for yeahs and yeahs, and then come back on
him, 'deed I have," he said, mysteriously. "An' again, it might be you got a floatin' kidney,
sah. Aftah dey once teah loose, dey sometimes don't make no trouble for quite a while."

When Wanning went to his room he did not go to bed. He sat up until he heard the voices of
his wife and daughters in the hall below. His own bed somehow frightened him. In all the years
he had lived in this house he had never before looked about his room, at that bed, with the
thought that he might one day be trapped there, and might not get out again. He had been ill,
of course, but his room had seemed a particularly pleasant place for a sick man; sunlight,
flowers,--agreeable, well-dressed women coming in and out.

Now there was something sinister about the bed itself, about its position, and its relation
to the rest of the furniture.

II

The next morning, on his way downtown, Wanning got off the subway train at Astor Place and
walked over to Washington Square. He climbed three flights of stairs and knocked at his son's
studio. Harold, dressed, with his stick and gloves in his hand, opened the door. He was just
going over to the Brevoort for breakfast. He greeted his father with the cordial familiarity
practised by all the "boys" of his set, clapped him on the shoulder and said in his light,
tonsilitis voice:

"Come in, Governor, how delightful! I haven't had a call from you in a long time."

He threw his hat and gloves on the writing table. He was a perfect gentleman, even with his father.

Florence said the matter with Harold was that he had heard people say he looked like Byron,
and stood for it.

What Harold would stand for in such matters was, indeed, the best definition of him. When he
read his play "The Street Walker" in drawing rooms and one lady told him it had the poetic
symbolism of Tchekhov, and another said that it suggested the biting realism of Brieux, he
never, in his most secret thoughts, questioned the acumen of either lady. Harold's speech,
even if you heard it in the next room and could not see him, told you that he had no sense
of the absurd,--a throaty staccato, with never a downward inflection, trustfully striving to
please.

"Just going out?" his father asked. "I won't keep you. Your mother told you I had a discouraging
session with Seares?"

"So awfully sorry you've had this bother, Governor; just as sorry as I can be. No question
about it's coming out all right, but it's a downright nuisance, your having to diet and that
sort of thing. And I suppose you ought to follow directions, just to make us all feel comfortable,
oughtn't you?" Harold spoke with fluent sympathy.

Wanning sat down on the arm of a chair and shook his head. "Yes, they do recommend a diet,
but they don't promise much from it."

Harold laughed precipitately. "Delicious! All doctors are, aren't they? So profound and oracular!
The medicine-man; it's quite the same idea, you see; with tom-toms."

Wanning knew that Harold meant something subtle,--one of the subtleties which he said were
only spoiled by being explained--so he came bluntly to one of the issues he had in mind.

"I would like to see you settled before I quit the harness, Harold."

Harold was absolutely tolerant.

He took out his cigarette case and burnished it with his handkerchief.

"I perfectly understand your point of view, dear Governor, but perhaps you don't altogether
get mine. Isn't it so? I am settled. What you mean by being settled, would unsettle me, completely.
I'm cut out for just such an existence as this; to live four floors up in an attic, get my
own breakfast, and have a charwoman to do for me. I should be awfully bored with an establishment.
I'm quite content with a little diggings like this."

Wanning's eyes fell. Somebody had to pay the rent of even such modest quarters as contented
Harold, but to say so would be rude, and Harold himself was never rude. Wanning did not, this
morning, feel equal to hearing a statement of his son's uncommercial ideals.

"I know," he said hastily. "But now we're up against hard facts, my boy. I did not want to
alarm your mother, but I've had a time limit put on me, and it's not a very long one."

Harold threw away the cigarette he had just lighted in a burst of indignation.

"That's the sort of thing I consider criminal, Father, absolutely criminal! What doctor has
a right to suggest such a thing? Seares himself may be knocked out tomorrow. What have laboratory
tests got to do with a man's will to live? The force of that depends upon his entire personality,
not on any organ or pair of organs."

Harold thrust his hands in his pockets and walked up and down, very much stirred. "Really,
I have a very poor opinion of scientists. They ought to be made serve an apprenticeship in
art, to get some conception of the power of human motives. Such brutality!"

Harold's plays dealt with the grimmest and most depressing matters, but he himself was always
agreeable, and he insisted upon high cheerfulness as the correct tone of human intercourse.

Wanning rose and turned to go. There was, in Harold, simply no reality, to which one could
break through. The young man took up his hat and gloves.

"Must you go? Let me step along with you to the sub. The walk will do me good."

Harold talked agreeably all the way to Astor Place. His father heard little of what he said,
but he rather liked his company and his wish to be pleasant.

Wanning went to his club for luncheon, meaning to spend the afternoon with some of his friends
who had retired from business and who read the papers there in the empty hours between two
and seven. He got no satisfaction, however. When he tried to tell these men of his present
predicament, they began to describe ills of their own in which he could not feel interested.
Each one of them had a treacherous organ of which he spoke with animation, almost with pride,
as if it were a crafty business competitor whom he was constantly outwitting. Each had a doctor,
too, for whom he was ardently soliciting business. They wanted either to telephone their doctor
and make an appointment for Wanning, or to take him then and there to the consulting room.
When he did not accept these invitations, they lost interest in him and remembered engagements.
He called a taxi and returned to the offices of McQuiston, Wade, and Wanning.

Settled at his desk, Wanning decided that he would not go home to dinner, but would stay at
the office and dictate a long letter to an old college friend who lived in Wyoming. He could
tell Douglas Brown things that he had not succeeded in getting to any one else. Brown, out
in the Wind River mountains, couldn't defend himself, couldn't slap Wanning on the back and
tell him to gather up the sunbeams.

He called up his house in Orange to say that he would not be home until late. Roma answered
the telephone. He spoke mournfully, but she was not disturbed by it.

"Very well, Father. Don't get too tired," she said in her well modulated voice.

When Wanning was ready to dictate his letter, he looked out from his private office into the
reception room and saw that his stenographer in her hat and gloves, and furs of the newest
cut, was just leaving.

"Goodnight, Mr. Wanning," she said, drawing down her dotted veil.

Had there been important business letters to be got off on the night mail, he would have felt
that he could detain her, but not for anything personal. Miss Doane was an expert legal stenographer,
and she knew her value. The slightest delay in dispatching office business annoyed her. Letters
that were not signed until the next morning awoke her deepest contempt. She was scrupulous
in professional etiquette, and Wanning felt that their relations, though pleasant, were scarcely
cordial.

As Miss Doane's trim figure disappeared through the outer door, little Annie Wooley, the copyist,
came in from the stenographers' room. Her hat was pinned over one ear, and she was scrambling
into her coat as she came, holding her gloves in her teeth and her battered handbag in the
fist that was already through a sleeve.

"Annie, I wanted to dictate a letter. You were just leaving, weren't you?"

"Oh, I don't mind!" she answered cheerfully, and pulling off her old coat, threw it on a chair.
"I'll get my book."

She followed him into his room and sat down by a table,--though she wrote with her book on
her knee.

Wanning had several times kept her after office hours to take his private letters for him,
and she had always been good-natured about it. On each occasion, when he gave her a dollar
to get her dinner, she protested, laughing, and saying that she could never eat so much as that.

She seemed a happy sort of little creature, didn't pout when she was scolded, and giggled about
her own mistakes in spelling. She was plump and undersized, always dodging under the elbows
of taller people and clattering about on high heels, much run over. She had bright black eyes
and fuzzy black hair in which, despite Miss Doane's reprimands, she often stuck her pencil.
She was the girl who couldn't believe that Wanning was fifty, and he had liked her ever since
he overheard that conversation.

Tilting back his chair--he never assumed this position when he dictated to Miss Doane--Wanning
began: "To Mr. D. E. Brown, South Forks, Wyoming."

He shaded his eyes with his hand and talked off a long letter to this man who would be sorry
that his mortal frame was breaking up. He recalled to him certain fine months they had spent
together on the Wind River when they were young men, and said he sometimes wished that like
D. E. Brown, he had claimed his freedom in a big country where the wheels did not grind a man
as hard as they did in New York. He had spent all these years hustling about and getting ready
to live the way he wanted to live, and now he had a puncture the doctors couldn't mend. What
was the use of it?

Wanning's thoughts were fixed on the trout streams and the great silver-firs in the canyons
of the Wind River Mountains, when he was disturbed by a soft, repeated sniffling. He looked
out between his fingers. Little Annie, carried away by his eloquence, was fairly panting to
make dots and dashes fast enough, and she was sopping her eyes with an unpresentable, end-of-the-day
handkerchief.

Wanning rambled on in his dictation. Why was she crying? What did it matter to her? He was
a man who said good-morning to her, who sometimes took an hour of the precious few she had
left at the end of the day and then complained about her bad spelling. When the letter was
finished, he handed her a new two dollar bill.

"I haven't got any change tonight; and anyhow, I'd like you to eat a whole lot. I'm on a diet,
and I want to see everybody else eat."

Annie tucked her notebook under her arm and stood looking at the bill which she had not taken
up from the table.

"I don't like to be paid for taking letters to your friends, Mr. Wanning," she said impulsively.
"I can run personal letters off between times. It ain't as if I needed the money," she added
carelessly.

"Get along with you! Anybody who is eighteen years old and has a sweet tooth needs money, all
they can get."

Annie giggled and darted out with the bill in her hand.

Wanning strolled aimlessly after her into the reception room.

"Let me have that letter before lunch tomorrow, please, and be sure that nobody sees it." He
stopped and frowned. "I don't look very sick, do I?"

"I should say you don't!" Annie got her coat on after considerable tugging. "Why don't you
call in a specialist? My mother called a specialist for my father before he died."

"Oh, is your father dead?"

"I should say he is! He was a painter by trade, and he fell off a seventy-foot stack into the
East River. Mother couldn't get anything out of the company, because he wasn't buckled. He
lingered for four months, so I know all about taking care of sick people. I was attending business
college then, and sick as he was, he used to give me dictation for practise. He made us all
go into professions; the girls, too. He didn't like us to just run."

Wanning would have liked to keep Annie and hear more about her family, but it was nearly seven
o'clock, and he knew he ought, in mercy, to let her go. She was the only person to whom he
had talked about his illness who had been frank and honest with him, who had looked at him
with eyes that concealed nothing. When he broke the news of his condition to his partners that
morning, they shut him off as if he were uttering indecent ravings. All day they had met him
with a hurried, abstracted manner. McQuiston and Wade went out to lunch together, and he knew
what they were thinking, perhaps talking, about. Wanning had brought into the firm valuable
business, but he was less enterprising than either of his partners.

III

In the early summer Wanning's family scattered. Roma swallowed her pride and sailed for Genoa
to visit the Contessa Jenny. Harold went to Cornish to be in an artistic atmosphere. Mrs. Wanning
and Florence took a cottage at York Harbor where Wanning was supposed to join them whenever
he could get away from town. He did not often get away. He felt most at ease among his accustomed
surroundings. He kept his car in the city and went back and forth from his office to the club
where he was living. Old Sam, his butler, came in from Orange every night to put his clothes
in order and make him comfortable.

Wanning began to feel that he would not tire of his office in a hundred years. Although he
did very little work, it was pleasant to go down town every morning when the streets were crowded,
the sky clear, and the sunshine bright. From the windows of his private office he could see
the harbor and watch the ocean liners come down the North River and go out to sea.

While he read his mail, he often looked out and wondered why he had been so long indifferent
to that extraordinary scene of human activity and hopefulness. How had a short-lived race of
beings the energy and courage valiantly to begin enterprises which they could follow for only
a few years; to throw up towers and build sea-monsters and found great businesses, when the
frailest of the materials with which they worked, the paper upon which they wrote, the ink
upon their pens, had more permanence in this world than they? All this material rubbish lasted.
The linen clothing and cosmetics of the Egyptians had lasted. It was only the human flame that
certainly, certainly went out. Other things had a fighting chance; they might meet with mishap
and be destroyed, they might not. But the human creature who gathered and shaped and hoarded
and foolishly loved these things, he had no chance--absolutely none. Wanning's cane, his hat,
his topcoat, might go from beggar to beggar and knock about in this world for another fifty
years or so; but not he.

In the late afternoon he never hurried to leave his office now. Wonderful sunsets burned over
the North River, wonderful stars trembled up among the towers; more wonderful than anything
he could hurry away to. One of his windows looked directly down upon the spire of Old Trinity,
with the green churchyard and the pale sycamores far below. Wanning often dropped into the
church when he was going out to lunch; not because he was trying to make his peace with Heaven,
but because the church was old and restful and familiar, because it and its gravestones had
sat in the same place for a long while. He bought flowers from the street boys and kept them
on his desk, which his partners thought strange behavior, and which Miss Doane considered a
sign that he was failing.

But there were graver things than bouquets for Miss Doane and the senior partner to ponder over.

The senior partner, McQuiston, in spite of his silvery hair and mustache and his important
church connections, had rich natural taste for scandal.--After Mr. Wade went away for his vacation,
in May, Wanning took Annie Wooley out of the copying room, put her at a desk in his private
office, and raised her pay to eighteen dollars a week, explaining to McQuiston that for the
summer months he would need a secretary. This explanation satisfied neither McQuiston nor Miss
Doane.

Annie was also paid for overtime, and although Wanning attended to very little of the office
business now, there was a great deal of overtime. Miss Doane was, of course, 'above' questioning
a chit like Annie; but what was he doing with his time and his new secretary, she wanted to know?

If anyone had told her that Wanning was writing a book, she would have said bitterly that it
was just like him. In his youth Wanning had hankered for the pen. When he studied law, he had
intended to combine that profession with some tempting form of authorship. Had he remained
a bachelor, he would have been an unenterprising literary lawyer to the end of his days. It
was his wife's restlessness and her practical turn of mind that had made him a money-getter.
His illness seemed to bring back to him the illusions with which he left college.

As soon as his family were out of the way and he shut up the Orange house, he began to dictate
his autobiography to Annie Wooley. It was not only the story of his life, but an expression
of all his theories and opinions, and a commentary on the fifty years of events which he could
remember.

Fortunately, he was able to take great interest in this undertaking. He had the happiest convictions
about the clear-cut style he was developing and his increasing felicity in phrasing. He meant
to publish the work handsomely, at his own expense and under his own name. He rather enjoyed
the thought of how greatly disturbed Harold would be. He and Harold differed in their estimates
of books. All the solid works which made up Wanning's library, Harold considered beneath contempt.
Anybody, he said, could do that sort of thing.

When Wanning could not sleep at night, he turned on the light beside his bed and made notes
on the chapter he meant to dictate the next day.

When he returned to the office after lunch, he gave instructions that he was not to be interrupted
by telephone calls, and shut himself up with his secretary.

After he had opened all the windows and taken off his coat, he fell to dictating. He found
it a delightful occupation, the solace of each day. Often he had sudden fits of tiredness;
then he would lie down on the leather sofa and drop asleep, while Annie read "The Leopard's
Spots" until he awoke.

Like many another business man Wanning had relied so long on stenographers that the operation
of writing with a pen had become laborious to him. When he undertook it, he wanted to cut everything
short. But walking up and down his private office, with the strong afternoon sun pouring in
at his windows, a fresh air stirring, all the people and boats moving restlessly down there,
he could say things he wanted to say. It was like living his life over again.

He did not miss his wife or his daughters. He had become again the mild, contemplative youth
he was in college, before he had a profession and a family to grind for, before the two needs
which shape our destiny had made of him pretty much what they make of every man.

At five o'clock Wanning sometimes went out for a cup of tea and took Annie along. He felt dull
and discouraged as soon as he was alone. So long as Annie was with him, he could keep a grip
on his own thoughts. They talked about what he had just been dictating to her. She found that
he liked to be questioned, and she tried to be greatly interested in it all.

After tea, they went back to the office. Occasionally Wanning lost track of time and kept Annie
until it grew dark. He knew he had old McQuiston guessing, but he didn't care. One day the
senior partner came to him with a reproving air.

"I am afraid Miss Doane is leaving us, Paul. She feels that Miss Wooley's promotion is irregular."

"How is that any business of hers, I'd like to know? She has all my legal work. She is always
disagreeable enough about doing anything else."

McQuiston's puffy red face went a shade darker.

"Miss Doane has a certain professional pride; a strong feeling for office organization. She
doesn't care to fill an equivocal position. I don't know that I blame her. She feels that there
is something not quite regular about the confidence you seem to place in this inexperienced
young woman."

Wanning pushed back his chair.

"I don't care a hang about Miss Doane's sense of propriety. I need a stenographer who will
carry out my instructions. I've carried out Miss Doane's long enough. I've let that schoolma'am
hector me for years. She can go when she pleases."

That night McQuiston wrote to his partner that things were in a bad way, and they would have
to keep an eye on Wanning. He had been seen at the theatre with his new stenographer.

That was true. Wanning had several times taken Annie to the Palace on Saturday afternoon. When
all his acquaintances were off motoring or playing golf, when the down-town offices and even
the streets were deserted, it amused him to watch a foolish show with a delighted, cheerful
little person beside him.

Beyond her generosity, Annie had no shining merits of character, but she had the gift of thinking
well of everything, and wishing well. When she was there Wanning felt as if there were someone
who cared whether this was a good or a bad day with him. Old Sam, too, was like that. While
the old black man put him to bed and made him comfortable, Wanning could talk to him as he
talked to little Annie. Even if he dwelt upon his illness, in plain terms, in detail, he did
not feel as if he were imposing on them.

People like Sam and Annie admitted misfortune,--admitted it almost cheerfully. Annie and her
family did not consider illness or any of its hard facts vulgar or indecent. It had its place
in their scheme of life, as it had not in that of Wanning's friends.

Annie came out of a typical poor family of New York. Of eight children, only four lived to
grow up. In such families the stream of life is broad enough, but runs shallow. In the children,
vitality is exhausted early. The roots do not go down into anything very strong. Illness and
deaths and funerals, in her own family and in those of her friends, had come at frequent intervals
in Annie's life. Since they had to be, she and her sisters made the best of them. There was
something to be got out of funerals, even, if they were managed right. They kept people in
touch with old friends who had moved uptown, and revived kindly feelings.

Annie had often given up things she wanted because there was sickness at home, and now she
was patient with her boss. What he paid her for overtime work by no means made up to her what
she lost.

Annie was not in the least thrifty, nor were any of her sisters. She had to make a living,
but she was not interested in getting all she could for her time, or in laying up for the future.
Girls like Annie know that the future is a very uncertain thing, and they feel no responsibility
about it. The present is what they have--and it is all they have. If Annie missed a chance
to go sailing with the plumber's son on Saturday afternoon, why, she missed it. As for the
two dollars her boss gave her, she handed them over to her mother. Now that Annie was getting
more money, one of her sisters quit a job she didn't like and was staying at home for a rest.
That was all promotion meant to Annie.

The first time Annie's boss asked her to work on Saturday afternoon, she could not hide her
disappointment. He suggested that they might knock off early and go to a show, or take a run
in his car, but she grew tearful and said it would be hard to make her family understand. Wanning
thought perhaps he could explain to her mother. He called his motor and took Annie home.

When his car stopped in front of the tenement house on Eighth Avenue, heads came popping out
of the windows for six storys up, and all the neighbor women, in dressing sacks and wrappers,
gazed down at the machine and at the couple alighting from it. A motor meant a wedding or the
hospital.

The plumber's son, Willy Steen, came over from the corner saloon to see what was going on,
and Annie introduced him at the doorstep.

Mrs. Wooley asked Wanning to come into the parlor and invited him to have a chair of ceremony
between the folding bed and the piano.

Annie, nervous and tearful, escaped to the dining-room--the cheerful spot where the daughters
visited with each other and with their friends. The parlor was a masked sleeping chamber and
store room.

The plumber's son sat down on the sofa beside Mrs. Wooley, as if he were accustomed to share
in the family councils. Mrs. Wooley waited expectant and kindly. She looked the sensible, hard-working
woman that she was, and one could see she hadn't lived all her life on Eighth Avenue without
learning a great deal.

Wanning explained to her that he was writing a book which he wanted to finish during the summer
months when business was not so heavy. He was ill and could not work regularly. His secretary
would have to take his dictation when he felt able to give it; must, in short, be a sort of
companion to him. He would like to feel that she could go out in his car with him, or even
to the theater, when he felt like it. It might have been better if he had engaged a young man
for this work, but since he had begun it with Annie, he would like to keep her if her mother
was willing.

Mrs. Wooley watched him with friendly, searching eyes. She glanced at Willy Steen, who, wise
in such distinctions, had decided that there was nothing shady about Annie's boss. He nodded
his sanction.

"I don't want my girl to conduct herself in any such way as will prejudice her, Mr. Wanning,"
she said thoughtfully. "If you've got daughters, you know how that is. You've been liberal
with Annie, and it's a good position for her. It's right she should go to business every day,
and I want her to do her work right, but I like to have her home after working hours. I always
think a young girl's time is her own after business hours, and I try not to burden them when
they come home. I'm willing she should do your work as suits you, if it's her wish; but I don't
like to press her. The good times she misses now, it's not you nor me, sir, that can make them
up to her. These young things has their feelings."

"Oh, I don't want to press her, either," Wanning said hastily. "I simply want to know that
you understand the situation. I've made her a little present in my will as a recognition that
she is doing more for me than she is paid for."

"That's something above me, sir. We'll hope there won't be no question of wills for many years
yet," Mrs. Wooley spoke heartily. "I'm glad if my girl can be of any use to you, just so she
don't prejudice herself."

The plumber's son rose as if the interview were over.

"It's all right, Mama Wooley, don't you worry," he said.

He picked up his canvas cap and turned to Wanning. "You see, Annie ain't the sort of girl that
would want to be spotted circulating around with a monied party her folks didn't know all about.
She'd lose friends by it."

After this conversation Annie felt a great deal happier. She was still shy and a trifle awkward
with poor Wanning when they were outside the office building, and she missed the old freedom
of her Saturday afternoons. But she did the best she could, and Willy Steen tried to make it
up to her.

In Annie's absence he often came in of an afternoon to have a cup of tea and a sugar-bun with
Mrs. Wooley and the daughter who was "resting." As they sat at the dining-room table, they
discussed Annie's employer, his peculiarities, his health, and what he had told Mrs. Wooley
about his will.

Mrs. Wooley said she sometimes felt afraid he might disinherit his children, as rich people
often did, and make talk; but she hoped for the best. Whatever came to Annie, she prayed it
might not be in the form of taxable property.

IV

Late in September Wanning grew suddenly worse. "I married in a negro church when I was young. I
married Frank Fair who came from Newberry County, S.C. After the ceremony, the neighbors gave
me a nice dinner at the church.

"I don't remember anything about Lincoln or Jeff Davis, but I think Booker Washington is a leading
colored man and has done good.

"I joined the church when I was nine years old, because my father
and mother belonged, and so many young people were joining.

I think everybody ought to join a church."

=Source:= Eugenia Fair (76). He helps me some 'cause I can't work
except jest a little 'round de house.

"I don't know much 'bout de war times. All I know is what I told you
befo'.

I 'member when de war quit and freedom come. Most of de slaves had
to find work where dey could.

Some had to work as share-croppers, some fer wages, and later on,
some rented small plots of land.

Many niggers since de war moved to town and worked as day hands, such as carpenters, janitors,
dray drivers and de like.

"De old time folks had blacksmith shops on de farm and made most of de tools dey used. Dey had
plenty to eat. We never wanted fer nothing and always lived good.

I had it better den dan I does now.

"In slavery when de patrollers rode up and down de roads, once a nigger
boy stole out to see his gal, all dressed up to kill.

De patrollers found him at his gal's house and started to take off
his coat so dey could whip him; but he said, 'Please don't let my
gal see under my coat, 'cause I got on a bosom and no shirt'.

(The custom was to wear stiff, white bosoms held up around the neck when no shirt was on. This
gave the appearance of a shirt.)

"My sister-in-law and mother-in-law both come from Virginia but I don't 'member anything dey said 'bout
dat country. My sister-in-law went back dere atter freedom come, but her mama died here.

"Us slaves went to de white folks' church at Cross Roads, and our
mistress made us go.

She often would teach us to read and write at home when we would
try to learn.

Mistress had a nigger driver fer her carriage, and when he drove he wore a high beaver hat
and a long coat. Our white folks had a big kitchen way off from de house. Dey had a big wide
fireplace where dey cooked over de fire in skillets.

My mistress had me to work in de house, kind of a house-girl, and
she made me keep clean and put large ear rings in my ears so I would
look good.

When Christmas come, Marse and Mistress always give de slaves good things to eat. Dey had lots of
cows, and dey give us good butter and milk, molasses, meats and other
good things to eat.

We always worked on week days except Saturdays, and sometimes on
dat day until 12 o'clock.

We always had Christmas and Easter holidays.

"We had corn-shuckings and cotton-pickings. De niggers would sing: 'Job, Job, farm in a row;
Job, Job, farm in a row'. Sometimes on moonlight nights we had pender pullings and when we got
through we had big suppers, always wid good potatoes or pumpkin pies,
de best eating ever.

We made corn bread wid plenty of milk, eggs and lard, and sometimes wid sweet potatoes, de
best corn bread in de world.

'Simmon bread was made wid sifted 'simmon juice cooked wid flour.

"I married first time to Joe Todd, and had a big wedding what my mistress
give me in her back yard. She had a big shoat killed fer de wedding
dinner. My mistress den was Miss Cornelia Ervin. When I married de
second time, I married in town to West Farrow, in de colored people's
Baptist church, by Rev. West Rutherford, a nigger preacher, de pastor.
My second husband died, too, a few years ago.

"I can't 'member much
'bout old songs, but a Baptist song was: 'Down to de water, River
of Jordon; Down to de water, River of Jordon; Dere my Savior was baptized.'

Another
version went thus:

"Come along, come along, my dear loving brother,
Come along and let's go home; Down into de River where my Savior was
baptized.'

"De present generation of niggers ain't like de ones when
I come along. Dey don't work like I did.

McQuiston raised his hand warningly.

"That will do, young lady. But when you get another place, remember this: it is never your
duty to entertain or to provide amusement for your employer."

He gave Annie a look which she did not clearly understand, although she pronounced him a nasty
old man as she hustled on her hat and jacket.

When Annie reached home she found Willy Steen sitting with her mother and sister at the dining-room
table. This was the first day that Annie had gone to the office since Wanning's death, and
her family awaited her return with suspense.

"Hello yourself," Annie called as she came in and threw her handbag into an empty armchair.

"You're off early, Annie," said her mother gravely. "Has the will been read?"

"I guess so. Yes, I know it has. Miss Wilson got it out of the safe for them. The son came
in. He's a pill."

"Was nothing said to you, daughter?"

"Yes, a lot. Please give me some tea, mother." Annie felt that her swagger was failing.

"Don't tantalize us, Ann," her sister broke in. "Didn't you get anything?"

"I got the mit, all right. And some back talk from the old man that I'm awful sore about."

Annie dashed away the tears and gulped her tea.

Gradually her mother and Willy drew the story from her. Willy offered at once to go to the
office building and take his stand outside the door and never leave it until he had punched
old Mr. McQuiston's face. He rose as if to attend to it at once, but Mrs. Wooley drew him to
his chair again and patted his arm.

"It would only start talk and get the girl in trouble, Willy. When it's lawyers, folks in our
station is helpless. I certainly believed that man when he sat here; you heard him yourself.
Such a gentleman as he looked."

Willy thumped his great fist, still in punching position, down on his knee.

"Never you be fooled again, Mama Wooley. You'll never get anything out of a rich guy that he
ain't signed up in the courts for. Rich is tight. There's no exceptions."

Annie shook her head.

"I didn't want anything out of him. He was a nice, kind man, and he had his troubles, I guess.
He wasn't tight."

"Still," said Mrs. Wooley sadly, "Mr. Wanning had no call to hold out promises. I hate to be
disappointed in a gentleman. You've had confining work for some time, daughter; a rest will
do you good."

PART II

REVIEWS AND ESSAYS

Mark Twain

If there is anything which should make an American sick and disgusted at the literary taste
of his country, and almost swerve his allegiance to his flag it is that controversy between
Mark Twain and Max O'Rell, in which the Frenchman proves himself a wit and a gentleman and
the American shows himself little short of a clown and an all around tough. The squabble arose
apropos of Paul Bourget's new book on America, "Outre Mer," a book which deals more fairly
and generously with this country than any book yet written in a foreign tongue. Mr. Clemens
did not like the book, and like all men of his class, and limited mentality, he cannot criticise
without becoming personal and insulting. He cannot be scathing without being a blackguard.
He tried to demolish a serious and well considered work by publishing a scurrilous, slangy
and loosely written article about it. In this article Mr. Clemens proves very little against
Mr. Bourget and a very great deal against himself. He demonstrates clearly that he is neither
a scholar, a reader or a man of letters and very little of a gentleman. His ignorance of French
literature is something appalling. Why, in these days it is as necessary for a literary man
to have a wide knowledge of the French masterpieces as it is for him to have read Shakespeare
or the Bible. What man who pretends to be an author can afford to neglect those models of style
and composition. George Meredith, Thomas Hardy and Henry James excepted, the great living novelists
are Frenchmen.

Mr. Clemens asks what the French sensualists can possibly teach the great American people about
novel writing or morality? Well, it would not seriously hurt the art of the classic author
of "Puddin' Head Wilson" to study Daudet, De Maupassant, Hugo and George Sand, whatever it
might do to his morals. Mark Twain is a humorist of a kind. His humor is always rather broad,
so broad that the polite world can justly call it coarse. He is not a reader nor a thinker
nor a man who loves art of any kind. He is a clever Yankee who has made a "good thing" out
of writing. He has been published in the North American Review and in the Century, but he is
not and never will be a part of literature. The association and companionship of cultured men
has given Mark Twain a sort of professional veneer, but it could not give him fine instincts
or nice discriminations or elevated tastes. His works are pure and suitable for children, just
as the work of most shallow and mediocre fellows. House dogs and donkeys make the most harmless
and chaste companions for young innocence in the world. Mark Twain's humor is of the kind that
teamsters use in bantering with each other, and his laugh is the gruff "haw-haw" of the backwoodsman.
He is still the rough, awkward, good-natured boy who swore at the deck hands on the river steamer
and chewed uncured tobacco when he was three years old. Thoroughly likeable as a good fellow,
but impossible as a man of letters. It is an unfortunate feature of American literature that
a hostler with some natural cleverness and a great deal of assertion receives the same recognition
as a standard American author that a man like Lowell does. The French academy is a good thing
after all. It at least divides the sheep from the goats and gives a sheep the consolation of
knowing that he is a sheep.

It is rather a pity that Paul Bourget should have written "Outre Mer," thoroughly creditable
book though it is. Mr. Bourget is a novelist, and he should not content himself with being
an essayist, there are far too many of them in the world already. He can develop strong characters,
invent strong situations, he can write the truth and he should not drift into penning opinions
and platitudes. When God has made a man a creator, it is a great mistake for him to turn critic.
It is rather an insult to God and certainly a very great wrong to man.

                           Nebraska State Journal, May 5, 1895

I got a letter last week from a little boy just half-past seven who had just read "Huckleberry
Finn" and "Tom Sawyer." He said: "If there are any more books like them in the world, send
them to me quick." I had to humbly confess to him that if there were any others I had not the
good fortune to know of them. What a red-letter-day it is to a boy, the day he first opens
"Tom Sawyer." I would rather sail on the raft down the Missouri again with "Huck" Finn and
Jim than go down the Nile in December or see Venice from a gondola in May. Certainly Mark Twain
is much better when he writes of his Missouri boys than when he makes sickley romances about
Joan of Arc. And certainly he never did a better piece of work than "Prince and Pauper." One
seems to get at the very heart of old England in that dearest of children's books, and in its
pages the frail boy king, and his gloomy sister Mary who in her day wrought so much woe for
unhappy England, and the dashing Princess Elizabeth who lived to rule so well, seem to live
again. A friend of Mr. Clemens' once told me that he said he wrote that book so that when his
little daughters grew up they might know that their tired old jester of a father could be serious
and gentle sometimes.

                                    The Home Monthly, May 1897

William Dean Howells

Certainly now in his old age Mr. Howells is selecting queer titles for his books. A while ago
we had that feeble tale, "The Coast of Bohemia," and now we have "My Literary Passions." "Passions,"
literary or otherwise, were never Mr. Howells' forte and surely no man could be further from
even the coast of Bohemia.

Apropos of "My Literary Passions" which has so long strung out in the Ladies' Home Journal
along with those thrilling articles about how Henry Ward Beecher tied his necktie and what
kind of coffee Mrs. Hall Cain likes, why did Mr. Howells write it? Doesn't Mr. Howells know
that at one time or another every one raves over Don Quixote, imitates Heine, worships Tourgueneff
and calls Tolstoi a prophet? Does Mr. Howells think that no one but he ever had youth and enthusiasm
and aspirations? Doesn't he know that the only thing that makes the world worth living in at
all is that once, when we are young, we all have that great love for books and impersonal things,
all reverence and dream? We have all known the time when Porthos, Athos and d'Artagan were
vastly more real and important to us than the folks who lived next door. We have all dwelt
in that country where Anna Karenina and the Levins were the only people who mattered much.
We have all known that intoxicating period when we thought we "understood life," because we
had read Daudet, Zola and Guy de Maupassant, and like Mr. Howells we all looked back rather
fondly upon the time when we believed that books were the truth and art was all. After a while
books grow matter of fact like everything else and we always think enviously of the days when
they were new and wonderful and strange. That's a part of existence. We lose our first keen
relish for literature just as we lose it for ice-cream and confectionery. The taste grows older,
wiser and more subdued. We would all wear out of very enthusiasm if it did not. But why should
Mr. Howells tell the world this common experience in detail as though it were his and his alone.
He might as well write a detailed account of how he had the measles and the whooping cough.
It was all right and proper for Mr. Howells to like Heine and Hugo, but, in the words of the
circus clown, "We've all been there."

The Shakespeare society of New York, which is really about the only useful literary organization
in this country, is making vigorous efforts to redress an old wrong and atone for a long neglect.
Sunday, Sept. 22, it held a meeting at the Poe cottage on Kingsbridge road near Fordham, for
the purpose of starting an organized movement to buy back the cottage, restore it to its original
condition and preserve it as a memorial of Poe. So it has come at last. After helping build
monuments to Shelley, Keats and Carlyle we have at last remembered this man, the greatest of
our poets and the most unhappy. I am glad that this movement is in the hands of American actors,
for it was among them that Poe found his best friends and warmest admirers. Some way he always
seemed to belong to the strolling Thespians who were his mother's people.

Among all the thousands of life's little ironies that make history so diverting, there is none
more paradoxical than that Edgar Poe should have been an American. Look at his face. Had we
ever another like it? He must have been a strange figure in his youth, among those genial,
courtly Virginians, this handsome, pale fellow, violent in his enthusiasm, ardent in his worship,
but spiritually cold in his affections. Now playing heavily for the mere excitement of play,
now worshipping at the shrine of a woman old enough to be his mother, merely because her voice
was beautiful; now swimming six miles up the James river against a heavy current in the glaring
sun of a June midday. He must have seemed to them an unreal figure, a sort of stage man who
was wandering about the streets with his mask and buskins on, a theatrical figure who had escaped
by some strange mischance into the prosaic daylight. His speech and actions were unconsciously
and sincerely dramatic, always as though done for effect. He had that nervous, egotistic, self-centered
nature common to stage children who seem to have been dazzled by the footlights and maddened
by the applause before they are born. It was in his blood. With the exception of two women
who loved him, lived for him, died for him, he went through life friendless, misunderstood,
with that dense, complete, hopeless misunderstanding which, as Amiel said, is the secret of
that sad smile upon the lips of the great. Men tried to befriend him, but in some way or other
he hurt and disappointed them. He tried to mingle and share with other men, but he was always
shut from them by that shadow, light as gossamer but unyielding as adamant, by which, from
the beginning of the world, art has shielded and guarded and protected her own, that God-concealing
mist in which the heroes of old were hidden, immersed in that gloom and solitude which, if
we could but know it here, is but the shadow of God's hand as it falls upon his elect.

We lament our dearth of great prose. With the exception of Henry James and Hawthorne, Poe is
our only master of pure prose. We lament our dearth of poets. With the exception of Lowell,
Poe is our only great poet. Poe found short story writing a bungling makeshift. He left it
a perfect art. He wrote the first perfect short stories in the English language. He first gave
the short story purpose, method, and artistic form. In a careless reading one can not realize
the wonderful literary art, the cunning devices, the masterly effects that those entrancing
tales conceal. They are simple and direct enough to delight us when we are children, subtle
and artistic enough to be our marvel when we are old. To this day they are the wonder and admiration
of the French, who are the acknowledged masters of craft and form. How in his wandering, laborious
life, bound to the hack work of the press and crushed by an ever-growing burden of want and
debt, did he ever come upon all this deep and mystical lore, this knowledge of all history,
of all languages, of all art, this penetration into the hidden things of the East? As Steadman
says, "The self training of genius is always a marvel." The past is spread before us all and
most of us spend our lives in learning those things which we do not need to know, but genius
reaches out instinctively and takes only the vital detail, by some sort of spiritual gravitation
goes directly to the right thing.

Poe belonged to the modern French school of decorative and discriminating prose before it ever
existed in France. He rivalled Gautier, Flaubert and de Maupassant before they were born. He
clothed his tales in a barbaric splendor and persuasive unreality never before heard of in
English. No such profusion of color, oriental splendor of detail, grotesque combinations and
mystical effects had ever before been wrought into language. There are tales as grotesque,
as monstrous, unearthly as the stone griffens and gargoyles that are cut up among the unvisited
niches and towers of Notre Dame, stories as poetic and delicately beautiful as the golden lace
work chased upon an Etruscan ring. He fitted his words together as the Byzantine jewelers fitted
priceless stones. He found the inner harmony and kinship of words. Where lived another man
who could blend the beautiful and the horrible, the gorgeous and the grotesque in such intricate
and inexplicable fashion? Who could delight you with his noun and disgust you with his verb,
thrill you with his adjective and chill you with his adverb, make you run the whole gamut of
human emotions in a single sentence? Sitting in that miserable cottage at Fordham he wrote
of the splendor of dream palaces beyond the dreams of art. He hung those grimy walls with dream
tapestries, paved those narrow halls with black marble and polished onyx, and into those low-roofed
chambers he brought all the treasured imagery of fancy, from the "huge carvings of untutored
Egypt" to "mingled and conflicting perfumes, reeking up from strange convolute censers, together
with multitudinous, flaring and flickering tongues of purple and violet fire." Hungry and ragged
he wrote of Epicurean feasts and luxury that would have beggared the purpled pomp of pagan
Rome and put Nero and his Golden House to shame.

And this mighty master of the organ of language, who knew its every stop and pipe, who could
awaken at will the thin silver tones of its slenderest reeds or the solemn cadence of its deepest
thunder, who could make it sing like a flute or roar like a cataract, he was born into a country
without a literature. He was of that ornate school which usually comes last in a national literature,
and he came first. American taste had been vitiated by men like Griswold and N. P. Willis until
it was at the lowest possible ebb. Willis was considered a genius, that is the worst that could
possibly be said. In the North a new race of great philosophers was growing up, but Poe had
neither their friendship nor encouragement. He went indeed, sometimes, to the chilly salon
of Margaret Fuller, but he was always a discord there. He was a mere artist and he had no business
with philosophy, he had no theories as to the "higher life" and the "true happiness." He had
only his unshapen dreams that battled with him in dark places, the unborn that struggled in
his brain for birth. What time has an artist to learn the multiplication table or to talk philosophy?
He was not afraid of them. He laughed at Willis, and flung Longfellow's lie in his teeth, the
lie the rest of the world was twenty years in finding. He scorned the obtrusive learning of
the transcendentalists and he disliked their hard talkative women. He left them and went back
to his dream women, his Berenice, his Ligeia, his Marchesa Aphrodite, pale and cold as the
mist maidens of the North, sad as the Norns who weep for human woe.

The tragedy of Poe's life was not alcohol, but hunger. He died when he was forty, when his
work was just beginning. Thackeray had not touched his great novels at forty, George Eliot
was almost unknown at that age. Hugo, Goethe, Hawthorne, Lowell and Dumas all did their great
work after they were forty years old. Poe never did his great work. He could not endure the
hunger. This year the Drexel Institute has put over sixty thousand dollars into a new edition
of Poe's poems and stories. He himself never got six thousand for them altogether. If one of
the great and learned institutions of the land had invested one tenth of that amount in the
living author forty years ago we should have had from him such works as would have made the
name of this nation great. But he sold "The Masque of the Red Death" for a few dollars, and
now the Drexel Institute pays a publisher thousands to publish it beautifully. It is enough
to make Satan laugh until his ribs ache, and all the little devils laugh and heap on fresh
coals. I don't wonder they hate humanity. It's so dense, so hopelessly stupid.

Only a few weeks before Poe's death he said he had never had time or opportunity to make a
serious effort. All his tales were merely experiments, thrown off when his day's work as a
journalist was over, when he should have been asleep. All those voyages into the mystical unknown,
into the gleaming, impalpable kingdom of pure romance from which he brought back such splendid
trophies, were but experiments. He was only getting his tools into shape getting ready for
his great effort, the effort that never came.

Bread seems a little thing to stand in the way of genius, but it can. The simple sordid facts
were these, that in the bitterest storms of winter Poe seldom wrote by a fire, that after he
was twenty-five years old he never knew what it was to have enough to eat without dreading
tomorrow's hunger. Chatterton had only himself to sacrifice, but Poe saw the woman he loved
die of want before his very eyes, die smiling and begging him not to give up his work. They
saw the depths together in those long winter nights when she lay in that cold room, wrapped
in Poe's only coat, he, with one hand holding hers, and with the other dashing off some of
the most perfect masterpieces of English prose. And when he would wince and turn white at her
coughing, she would always whisper: "Work on, my poet, and when you have finished read it to
me. I am happy when I listen." O, the devotion of women and the madness of art! They are the
two most awesome things on earth, and surely this man knew both to the full.

I have wondered so often how he did it. How he kept his purpose always clean and his taste
always perfect. How it was that hard labor never wearied nor jaded him, never limited his imagination,
that the jarring clamor about him never drowned the fine harmonies of his fancy. His discrimination
remained always delicate, and from the constant strain of toil his fancy always rose strong
and unfettered. Without encouragement or appreciation of any sort, without models or precedents
he built up that pure style of his that is without peer in the language, that style of which
every sentence is a drawing by Vedder. Elizabeth Barrett and a few great artists over in France
knew what he was doing, they knew that in literature he was making possible a new heaven and
a new earth. But he never knew that they knew it. He died without the assurance that he was
or ever would be understood. And yet through all this, with the whole world of art and letters
against him, betrayed by his own people, he managed to keep that lofty ideal of perfect work.
What he suffered never touched or marred his work, but it wrecked his character. Poe's character
was made by his necessity. He was a liar and an egotist; a man who had to beg for bread at
the hands of his publishers and critics could be nothing but a liar, and had he not had the
insane egotism and conviction of genius, he would have broken down and written the drivelling
trash that his countrymen delighted to read. Poe lied to his publishers sometimes, there is
no doubt of that, but there were two to whom he was never false, his wife and his muse. He
drank sometimes too, when for very ugly and relentless reasons he could not eat. And then he
forgot what he suffered. For Bacchus is the kindest of the gods after all. When Aphrodite has
fooled us and left us and Athene has betrayed us in battle, then poor tipsy Bacchus, who covers
his head with vine leaves where the curls are getting thin, holds out his cup to us and says,
"forget." It's poor consolation, but he means it well.

The Transcendentalists were good conversationalists, that in fact was their principal accomplishment.
They used to talk a great deal of genius, that rare and capricious spirit that visits earth
so seldom, that is wooed by so many, and won by so few. They had grand theories that all men
should be poets, that the visits of that rare spirit should be made as frequent and universal
as afternoon calls. O, they had plans to make a whole generation of little geniuses. But she
only laughed her scornful laughter, that deathless lady of the immortals, up in her echoing
chambers that are floored with dawn and roofed with the spangled stars. And she snatched from
them the only man of their nation she had ever deigned to love, whose lips she had touched
with music and whose soul with song. In his youth she had shown him the secrets of her beauty
and his manhood had been one pursuit of her, blind to all else, like Anchises, who on the night
that he knew the love of Venus, was struck sightless, that he might never behold the face of
a mortal woman. For Our Lady of Genius has no care for the prayers and groans of mortals, nor
for their hecatombs sweet of savor. Many a time of old she has foiled the plans of seers and
none may entreat her or take her by force. She favors no one nation or clime. She takes one
from the millions, and when she gives herself unto a man it is without his will or that of
his fellows, and he pays for it, dear heaven, he pays!

Yes, "and the immortal stars awake again." None may thwart the unerring justice of the gods,
not even the Transcendentalists. What matter that one man's life was miserable, that one man
was broken on the wheel? His work lives and his crown is eternal. That the work of his age
was undone, that is the pity, that the work of his youth was done, that is the glory. The man
is nothing. There are millions of men. The work is everything. There is so little perfection.
We lament our dearth of poets when we let Poe starve. We are like the Hebrews who stoned their
prophets and then marvelled that the voice of God was silent. We will wait a long time for
another. There are Griswold and N. P. Willis, our chosen ones, let us turn to them. Their names
are forgotten. God is just. They are,

  "Gathered unto death without a dawn.
  And the immortal stars awake again."

                                 The Courier, October 12, 1895

You can afford to give a little more care and attention to this imaginative boy of yours than
to any of your other children. His nerves are more finely strung and all his life he will need
your love more than the others. Be careful to get him the books he likes and see that they
are good ones. Get him a volume of Poe's short stories. I know many people are prejudiced against
Poe because of the story that he drank himself to death. But that myth has been exploded long
ago. Poe drank less than even the average man of his time. No, the most artistic of all American
story tellers did not die because he drank too much, but because he ate too little. And yet
we, his own countrymen who should be so proud of him, are not content with having starved him
and wronged him while he lived, we must even go on slandering him after he has been dead almost
fifty years. But get his works for this imaginative boy of yours and he will tell you how great
a man the author of "The Gold Bug" and "The Masque of the Red Death" was. Children are impartial
critics and sometimes very good ones. They do not reason about a book, they just like it or
dislike it intensely, and after all that is the conclusion of the whole matter. I am very sure
that "The Fall of the House of Usher," "The Pit and the Pendulum" and "The Black Cat" will
give this woolgathering lad of yours more pleasure than a new bicycle could.

Walt Whitman

Speaking of monuments reminds one that there is more talk about a monument to Walt Whitman,
"the good, gray poet." Just why the adjective good is always applied to Whitman it is difficult
to discover, probably because people who could not understand him at all took it for granted
that he meant well. If ever there was a poet who had no literary ethics at all beyond those
of nature, it was he. He was neither good nor bad, any more than are the animals he continually
admired and envied. He was a poet without an exclusive sense of the poetic, a man without the
finer discriminations, enjoying everything with the unreasoning enthusiasm of a boy. He was
the poet of the dung hill as well as of the mountains, which is admirable in theory but excruciating
in verse. In the same paragraph he informs you that, "The pure contralto sings in the organ
loft," and that "The malformed limbs are tied to the table, what is removed drop horribly into
a pail." No branch of surgery is poetic, and that hopelessly prosaic word "pail" would kill
a whole volume of sonnets. Whitman's poems are reckless rhapsodies over creation in general,
some times sublime, some times ridiculous. He declares that the ocean with its "imperious waves,
commanding" is beautiful, and that the fly-specks on the walls are also beautiful. Such catholic
taste may go in science, but in poetry their results are sad. The poet's task is usually to
select the poetic. Whitman never bothers to do that, he takes everything in the universe from
fly-specks to the fixed stars. His "Leaves of Grass" is a sort of dictionary of the English
language, and in it is the name of everything in creation set down with great reverence but
without any particular connection.

But however ridiculous Whitman may be there is a primitive elemental force about him. He is
so full of hardiness and of the joy of life. He looks at all nature in the delighted, admiring
way in which the old Greeks and the primitive poets did. He exults so in the red blood in his
body and the strength in his arms. He has such a passion for the warmth and dignity of all
that is natural. He has no code but to be natural, a code that this complex world has so long
outgrown. He is sensual, not after the manner of Swinbourne and Gautier, who are always seeking
for perverted and bizarre effects on the senses, but in the frank fashion of the old barbarians
who ate and slept and married and smacked their lips over the mead horn. He is rigidly limited
to the physical, things that quicken his pulses, please his eyes or delight his nostrils. There
is an element of poetry in all this, but it is by no means the highest. If a joyous elephant
should break forth into song, his lay would probably be very much like Whitman's famous "song
of myself." It would have just about as much delicacy and deftness and discriminations. He says:

"I think I could turn and live with the animals. They are so placid and self-contained, I stand
and look at them long and long. They do not sweat and whine about their condition. They do
not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins. They do not make me sick discussing their
duty to God. Not one is dissatisfied nor not one is demented with the mania of many things.
Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago. Not one is respectable
or unhappy, over the whole earth." And that is not irony on nature, he means just that, life
meant no more to him. He accepted the world just as it is and glorified it, the seemly and
unseemly, the good and the bad. He had no conception of a difference in people or in things.
All men had bodies and were alike to him, one about as good as another. To live was to fulfil
all natural laws and impulses. To be comfortable was to be happy. To be happy was the ultimatum.
He did not realize the existence of a conscience or a responsibility. He had no more thought
of good or evil than the folks in Kipling's Jungle book.

And yet there is an undeniable charm about this optimistic vagabond who is made so happy by
the warm sunshine and the smell of spring fields. A sort of good fellowship and whole-heartedness
in every line he wrote. His veneration for things physical and material, for all that is in
water or air or land, is so real that as you read him you think for the moment that you would
rather like to live so if you could. For the time you half believe that a sound body and a
strong arm are the greatest things in the world. Perhaps no book shows so much as "Leaves of
Grass" that keen senses do not make a poet. When you read it you realize how spirited a thing
poetry really is and how great a part spiritual perceptions play in apparently sensuous verse,
if only to select the beautiful from the gross.

Henry James

Their mania for careless and hasty work is not confined to the lesser men. Howells and Hardy
have gone with the crowd. Now that Stevenson is dead I can think of but one English speaking
author who is really keeping his self-respect and sticking for perfection. Of course I refer
to that mighty master of language and keen student of human actions and motives, Henry James.
In the last four years he has published, I believe, just two small volumes, "The Lesson of
the Master" and "Terminations," and in those two little volumes of short stories he who will
may find out something of what it means to be really an artist. The framework is perfect and
the polish is absolutely without flaw. They are sometimes a little hard, always calculating
and dispassionate, but they are perfect. I wish James would write about modern society, about
"degeneracy" and the new woman and all the rest of it. Not that he would throw any light on
it. He seldom does; but he would say such awfully clever things about it, and turn on so many
side-lights. And then his sentences! If his character novels were all wrong one could read
him forever for the mere beauty of his sentences. He never lets his phrases run away with him.
They are never dull and never too brilliant. He subjects them to the general tone of his sentence
and has his whole paragraph partake of the same predominating color. You are never startled,
never surprised, never thrilled or never enraptured; always delighted by that masterly prose
that is as correct, as classical, as calm and as subtle as the music of Mozart.

                                The Courier, November 16, 1895

It is strange that from "Felicia" down, the stage novel has never been a success. Henry James'
"Tragic Muse" is the only theatrical novel that has a particle of the real spirit of the stage
in it, a glimpse of the enthusiasm, the devotion, the exaltation and the sordid, the frivolous
and the vulgar which are so strangely and inextricably blended in that life of the green room.
For although Henry James cannot write plays he can write passing well of the people who enact
them. He has put into one book all those inevitable attendants of the drama, the patronizing
theatre goer who loves it above all things and yet feels so far superior to it personally;
the old tragedienne, the queen of a dying school whose word is law and whose judgments are
to a young actor as the judgments of God; and of course there is the girl, the aspirant, the
tragic muse who beats and beats upon those brazen doors that guard the unapproachable until
one fine morning she beats them down and comes into her kingdom, the kingdom of unborn beauty
that is to live through her. It is a great novel, that book of the master's, so perfect as
a novel that one does not realize what a masterly study it is of the life and ends and aims
of the people who make plays live.

Harold Frederic

    "THE MARKET-PLACE." Harold Frederic. $1.50. New York: F. A.
    Stokes & Co. Pittsburg: J. R. Weldin & Co.

Unusual interest is attached to the posthumous work of that great man whose career ended so
prematurely and so tragically. The story is a study in the ethics and purposes of money-getting,
in the romantic element in modern business. In it finance is presented not as being merely
the province of shrewdness, or greediness, or petty personal gratification, but of great projects,
of great brain-battles, a field for the exercising of talent, daring, imagination, appealing
to the strength of a strong man, filling the same place in men's lives that was once filled
by the incentives of war, kindling in man the desire for the leadership of men. The hero of
the story, "Joel Thorpe," is one of those men, huge of body, keen of brain, with cast iron
nerves, as sound a heart as most men, and a magnificent capacity for bluff. He has lived and
risked and lost in a dozen countries, been almost within reach of fortune a dozen times, and
always missed her until, finally, in London, by promoting a great rubber syndicate he becomes
a multi-millionaire. He marries the most beautiful and one of the most impecunious peeresses
in England and retires to his country estate. There, as a gentleman of leisure, he loses his
motive in life, loses power for lack of opportunity, and grows less commanding even in the
eyes of his wife, who misses the uncompromising, barbaric strength which took her by storm
and won her. Finally he evolves a gigantic philanthropic scheme of spending his money as laboriously
as he made it.

Mr. Frederic says:

    "Napoleon was the greatest man of his age--one of the
    greatest men of all ages--not only in war but in a hundred
    other ways. He spent the last six years of his life at St.
    Helena in excellent health, with companions that he talked
    freely to, and in all the extraordinarily copious reports of
    his conversations there, we don't get a single sentence
    worth repeating. The greatness had entirely evaporated from
    him the moment he was put on an island where he had nothing
    to do."

It is very fitting that Mr. Frederic's last book should be in praise of action, the thing that
makes the world go round; of force, however misspent, which is the sum of life as distinguished
from the inertia of death. In the forty-odd years of his life he wrote almost as many pages
as Balzac, most of it mere newspaper copy, it is true, read and forgotten, but all of it vigorous
and with the stamp of a strong man upon it. And he played just as hard as he worked--alas,
it was the play that killed him! The young artist who illustrated the story gave to the pictures
of "Joel Thorpe" very much the look of Harold Frederic himself, and they might almost stand
for his portraits. I fancy the young man did not select his model carelessly. In this big,
burly adventurer who took fortune and women by storm, who bluffed the world by his prowess
and fought his way to the front with battle-ax blows, there is a great deal of Harold Frederic,
the soldier of fortune, the Utica milk boy who fought his way from the petty slavery of a provincial
newspaper to the foremost ranks of the journalists of the world and on into literature, into
literature worth the writing. The man won his place in England much as his hero won his, by
defiance, by strong shoulder blows, by his self-sufficiency and inexhaustible strength, and
when he finished his book he did not know that his end would be so much less glorious than
his hero's, that it would be his portion not to fall manfully in the thick of the combat and
the press of battle, but to die poisoned in the tent of Chryseis. For who could foresee a tragedy
so needless, so blind, so brutal in its lack of dignity, or know that such strength could perish
through such insidious weakness, that so great a man could be stung to death by a mania born
in little minds?

In point of execution and literary excellence, both "The Market Place" and "Gloria Mundi" are
vastly inferior to "The Damnation of Theron Ware," or that exquisite London idyl, "March Hares."
The first 200 pages of "Theron Ware" are as good as anything in American fiction, much better
than most of it. They are not so much the work of a literary artist as of a vigorous thinker,
a man of strong opinions and an intimate and comprehensive knowledge of men. The whole work,
despite its irregularities and indifference to form, is full of brain stuff, the kind of active,
healthful, masterful intellect that some men put into politics, some into science and a few,
a very few, into literature. Both "Gloria Mundi" and "The Market Place" bear unmistakable evidences
of the slack rein and the hasty hand. Both of them contain considerable padding, the stamp
of the space writer. They are imperfectly developed, and are not packed with ideas like his
earlier novels. Their excellence is in flashes; it is not the searching, evenly distributed
light which permeates his more careful work. There were, as we know too well, good reasons
why Mr. Frederic should work hastily. He needed a large income and he worked heroically, writing
many thousands of words a day to obtain it. From the experience of the ages we have learned
to expect to find, coupled with great strength, a proportionate weakness, and usually it devours
the greater part, as the seven lean kine devoured the seven fat in Pharaoh's vision. Achilles
was a god in all his nobler parts, but his feet were of the earth and to the earth they held
him down, and he died stung by an arrow in the heel.

Kate Chopin

    "THE AWAKENING." Kate Chopin. $1.25. Chicago: H. S. Stone &
    Co. Pittsburg: J. R. Weldin & Co.

A Creole "Bovary" is this little novel of Miss Chopin's. Not that the heroine is a creole exactly,
or that Miss Chopin is a Flaubert--save the mark!--but the theme is similar to that which occupied
Flaubert. There was, indeed, no need that a second "Madame Bovary" should be written, but an
author's choice of themes is frequently as inexplicable as his choice of a wife. It is governed
by some innate temperamental bias that cannot be diagrammed. This is particularly so in women
who write, and I shall not attempt to say why Miss Chopin has devoted so exquisite and sensitive,
well-governed a style to so trite and sordid a theme. She writes much better than it is ever
given to most people to write, and hers is a genuinely literary style; of no great elegance
or solidity; but light, flexible, subtle and capable of producing telling effects directly
and simply. The story she has to tell in the present instance is new neither in matter nor
treatment. "Edna Pontellier," a Kentucky girl, who, like "Emma Bovary," had been in love with
innumerable dream heroes before she was out of short skirts, married "Leonce Pontellier" as
a sort of reaction from a vague and visionary passion for a tragedian whose unresponsive picture
she used to kiss. She acquired the habit of liking her husband in time, and even of liking
her children. Though we are not justified in presuming that she ever threw articles from her
dressing table at them, as the charming "Emma" had a winsome habit of doing, we are told that
"she would sometimes gather them passionately to her heart, she would sometimes forget them."
At a creole watering place, which is admirably and deftly sketched by Miss Chopin, "Edna" met
"Robert Lebrun," son of the landlady, who dreamed of a fortune awaiting him in Mexico while
he occupied a petty clerical position in New Orleans. "Robert" made it his business to be agreeable
to his mother's boarders, and "Edna," not being a creole, much against his wish and will, took
him seriously. "Robert" went to Mexico but found that fortunes were no easier to make there
than in New Orleans. He returns and does not even call to pay his respects to her. She encounters
him at the home of a friend and takes him home with her. She wheedles him into staying for
dinner, and we are told she sent the maid off "in search of some delicacy she had not thought
of for herself, and she recommended great care in the dripping of the coffee and having the
omelet done to a turn."

Only a few pages back we were informed that the husband, "M. Pontellier," had cold soup and
burnt fish for his dinner. Such is life. The lover of course disappointed her, was a coward
and ran away from his responsibilities before they began. He was afraid to begin a chapter
with so serious and limited a woman. She remembered the sea where she had first met "Robert."
Perhaps from the same motive which threw "Anna Keraninna" under the engine wheels, she threw
herself into the sea, swam until she was tired and then let go.

    "She looked into the distance, and for a moment the old
    terror flamed up, then sank again. She heard her father's
    voice, and her sister Margaret's. She heard the barking of
    an old dog that was chained to the sycamore tree. The spurs
    of the cavalry officer clanged as he walked across the
    porch. There was a hum of bees, and the musky odor of pinks
    filled the air."

"Edna Pontellier" and "Emma Bovary" are studies in the same feminine type; one a finished and
complete portrayal, the other a hasty sketch, but the theme is essentially the same. Both women
belong to a class, not large, but forever clamoring in our ears, that demands more romance
out of life than God put into it. Mr. G. Barnard Shaw would say that they are the victims of
the over-idealization of love. They are the spoil of the poets, the Iphigenias of sentiment.
The unfortunate feature of their disease is that it attacks only women of brains, at least
of rudimentary brains, but whose development is one-sided; women of strong and fine intuitions,
but without the faculty of observation, comparison, reasoning about things. Probably, for emotional
people, the most convenient thing about being able to think is that it occasionally gives them
a rest from feeling. Now with women of the "Bovary" type, this relaxation and recreation is
impossible. They are not critics of life, but, in the most personal sense, partakers of life.
They receive impressions through the fancy. With them everything begins with fancy, and passions
rise in the brain rather than in the blood, the poor, neglected, limited one-sided brain that
might do so much better things than badgering itself into frantic endeavors to love. For these
are the people who pay with their blood for the fine ideals of the poets, as Marie Delclasse
paid for Dumas' great creation, "Marguerite Gauthier." These people really expect the passion
of love to fill and gratify every need of life, whereas nature only intended that it should
meet one of many demands. They insist upon making it stand for all the emotional pleasures
of life and art, expecting an individual and self-limited passion to yield infinite variety,
pleasure and distraction, to contribute to their lives what the arts and the pleasurable exercise
of the intellect gives to less limited and less intense idealists. So this passion, when set
up against Shakespeare, Balzac, Wagner, Raphael, fails them. They have staked everything on
one hand, and they lose. They have driven the blood until it will drive no further, they have
played their nerves up to the point where any relaxation short of absolute annihilation is
impossible. Every idealist abuses his nerves, and every sentimentalist brutally abuses them.
And in the end, the nerves get even. Nobody ever cheats them, really. Then "the awakening"
comes. Sometimes it comes in the form of arsenic, as it came to "Emma Bovary," sometimes it
is carbolic acid taken covertly in the police station, a goal to which unbalanced idealism
not infrequently leads. "Edna Pontellier," fanciful and romantic to the last, chose the sea
on a summer night and went down with the sound of her first lover's spurs in her ears, and
the scent of pinks about her. And next time I hope that Miss Chopin will devote that flexible,
iridescent style of hers to a better cause.

Stephen Crane

    "WAR IS KIND." Stephen Crane. $2.50. New York: F. A. Stokes
    & Co. Pittsburg: J. R. Weldin & Co.

This truly remarkable book is printed on dirty gray blotting paper, on each page of which is
a mere dot of print over a large I of vacancy. There are seldom more than ten lines on a page,
and it would be better if most of those lines were not there at all. Either Mr. Crane is insulting
the public or insulting himself, or he has developed a case of atavism and is chattering the
primeval nonsense of the apes. His "Black Riders," uneven as it was, was a casket of polished
masterpieces when compared with "War Is Kind." And it is not kind at all, Mr. Crane; when it
provokes such verses as these, it is all that Sherman said it was.

The only production in the volume that is at all coherent is the following, from which the
book gets its title:

  Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind,
  Because your lover threw wild hands toward the sky,
  And the affrighted steed ran on alone.
                  Do not weep,
                  War is kind.

  Hoarse booming drums of the regiment,
  Little souls who thirst for fight,
      These men were born to drill and die.
  The unexplained glory flies above them.
  Great is the battle-god, great, and his kingdom--
      A field where a thousand corpses lie.

  Do not weep, babe, for war is kind,
  Because your father tumbled in the yellow trenches,
  Raged at the breast, gulped and died.
                  Do not weep,
                  War is kind.

  Swift-blazing flag of the regiment,
  Eagle with crest of red and gold,
      These men were born to drill and die.
  Point for them the virtue of slaughter,
  Make plain to them the excellence of killing,
      And a field where a thousand corpses lie.

  Mother whose heart hung humble as a button
  On the bright, splendid shroud of your son,
                  Do not weep,
                  War is kind.

Of course, one may have objections to hearts hanging like humble buttons, or to buttons being
humble at all, but one should not stop to quarrel about such trifles with a poet who can perpetrate
the following:

  Thou art my love,
  And thou art the beard
  On another man's face--
  Woe is me.

  Thou art my love,
  And thou art a temple,
  And in this temple is an altar,
  And on this temple is my heart--
  Woe is me.

  Thou art my love,
  And thou art a wretch.
  Let these sacred love-lies choke thee.
  For I am come to where I know your lies as truth
  And your truth as lies--
  Woe is me.

Now, if you please, is the object of these verses animal, mineral or vegetable? Is the expression,
"Thou art the beard on another man's face," intended as a figure, or was it written by a barber?
Certainly, after reading this, "Simple Simon" is a ballade of perfect form, and "Jack and Jill"
or "Hickity, Pickity, My Black Hen," are exquisite lyrics. But of the following what shall be said:

  Now let me crunch you
  With full weight of affrighted love.
  I doubted you
  --I doubted you--
  And in this short doubting
  My love grew like a genie
  For my further undoing.

  Beware of my friends,
  Be not in speech too civil,
  For in all courtesy
  My weak heart sees specters,
  Mists of desire
  Arising from the lips of my chosen;
  Be not civil.

This is somewhat more lucid as evincing the bard's exquisite sensitiveness:

  Ah, God, the way your little finger moved
  As you thrust a bare arm backward.
  And made play with your hair
  And a comb, a silly gilt comb
  --Ah, God, that I should suffer
  Because of the way a little finger moved.

Mr. Crane's verselets are illustrated by some Bradley pictures, which are badly drawn, in bad
taste, and come with bad grace. On page 33 of the book there are just two lines which seem
to completely sum up the efforts of both poet and artist:

  "My good friend," said a learned bystander,
  "Your operations are mad."

Yet this fellow Crane has written short stories equal to some of Maupassant's.

                                Pittsburg Leader, June 3, 1899

After reading such a delightful newspaper story as Mr. Frank Norris' "Blix," it is with assorted
sensations of pain and discomfort that one closes the covers of another newspaper novel, "Active
Service," by Stephen Crane. If one happens to have some trifling regard for pure English, he
does not come forth from the reading of this novel unscathed. The hero of this lurid tale is
a newspaper man, and he edits the Sunday edition of the New York "Eclipse," and delights in
publishing "stories" about deformed and sightless infants. "The office of the 'Eclipse' was
at the top of an immense building on Broadway. It was a sheer mountain to the heights of which
the interminable thunder of the streets rose faintly. The Hudson was a broad path of silver
in the distance." This leaves little doubt as to the fortunate journal which had secured Rufus
Coleman as its Sunday editor. Mr. Coleman's days were spent in collecting yellow sensations
for his paper, and we are told that he "planned for each edition as for a campaign." The following
elevating passage is one of the realistic paragraphs by which Mr. Crane makes the routine of
Coleman's life known to us:

    Suddenly there was a flash of light and a cage of bronze,
    gilt and steel dropped magically from above. Coleman yelled
    "Down!" * * * A door flew open. Coleman stepped upon the
    elevator. "Well, Johnnie," he said cheerfully to the lad who
    operated the machine, "is business good?" "Yes, sir, pretty
    good," answered the boy, grinning. The little cage sank
    swiftly. Floor after floor seemed to be rising with
    marvelous speed; the whole building was winging straight
    into the sky. There was soaring lights, figures and the
    opalescent glow of ground glass doors marked with black
    inscriptions. Other lights were springing heavenward. All
    the lofty corridors rang with cries. "Up!" "Down!" "Down!"
    "Up!!" The boy's hand grasped a lever and his machine obeyed
    his lightest movement with sometimes an unbalancing
    swiftness.

Later, when Coleman reached the street, Mr. Crane describes the cable cars as marching like
panoplied elephants, which is rather far, to say the least. The gentleman's nights were spent
something as follows:

    "In the restaurant he first ordered a large bottle of
    champagne. The last of the wine he finished in somber mood
    like an unbroken and defiant man who chews the straw that
    litters his prison house. During his dinner he was
    continually sending out messenger boys. He was arranging a
    poker party. Through a window he watched the beautiful
    moving life of upper Broadway at night, with its crowds and
    clanging cable cars and its electric signs, mammoth and
    glittering like the jewels of a giantess.

    "Word was brought to him that poker players were arriving.
    He arose joyfully, leaving his cheese. In the broad hall,
    occupied mainly by miscellaneous people and actors, all deep
    in leather chairs, he found some of his friends waiting.
    They trooped upstairs to Coleman's rooms, where, as a
    preliminary, Coleman began to hurl books and papers from the
    table to the floor. A boy came with drinks. Most of the men,
    in order to prepare for the game, removed their coats and
    cuffs and drew up the sleeves of their shirts. The electric
    globes shed a blinding light upon the table. The sound of
    clinking chips arose; the elected banker spun the cards,
    careless and dextrous."

The atmosphere of the entire novel is just that close and enervating. Every page is like the
next morning taste of a champagne supper, and is heavy with the smell of stale cigarettes.
There is no fresh air in the book and no sunlight, only the "blinding light shed by the electric
globes." If the life of New York newspaper men is as unwholesome and sordid as this, Mr. Crane,
who has experienced it, ought to be sadly ashamed to tell it. Next morning when Coleman went
for breakfast in the grill room of his hotel he ordered eggs on toast and a pint of champagne
for breakfast and discoursed affably to the waiter.

    "May be you had a pretty lively time last night, Mr.
    Coleman?"

    "Yes, Pat," answered Coleman. "I did. It was all because of
    an unrequitted affection, Patrick." The man stood near, a
    napkin over his arm. Coleman went on impressively. "The ways
    of the modern lover are strange. Now, I, Patrick, am a
    modern lover, and when, yesterday, the dagger of
    disappointment was driven deep into my heart, I immediately
    played poker as hard as I could, and incidentally got
    loaded. This is the modern point of view. I understand on
    good authority that in old times lovers used to languish.
    That is probably a lie, but at any rate we do not, in these
    times, languish to any great extent. We get drunk. Do you
    understand Patrick?"

    The waiter was used to a harangue at Coleman's breakfast
    time. He placed his hand over his mouth and giggled.
    "Yessir."

    "Of course," continued Coleman, thoughtfully. "It might be
    pointed out by uneducated persons that it is difficult to
    maintain a high standard of drunkenness for the adequate
    length of time, but in the series of experiments which I am
    about to make, I am sure I can easily prove them to be in
    the wrong."

    "I am sure, sir," said the waiter, "the young ladies would
    not like to be hearing you talk this way."

    "Yes; no doubt, no doubt. The young ladies have still quite
    medieval ideas. They don't understand. They still prefer
    lovers to languish."

    "At any rate, sir, I don't see that your heart is sure
    enough broken. You seem to take it very easy."

    "Broken!" cried Coleman. "Easy? Man, my heart is in
    fragments. Bring me another small bottle."

After this Coleman went to Greece to write up the war for the "Eclipse," and incidentally to
rescue his sweetheart from the hands of the Turks and make "copy" of it. Very valid arguments
might be advanced that the lady would have fared better with the Turks. On the voyage Coleman
spent all his days and nights in the card room and avoided the deck, since fresh air was naturally
disagreeable to him. For all that he saw of Greece or that Mr. Crane's readers see of Greece
Coleman might as well have stayed in the card room of the steamer, or in the card room of his
New York hotel for that matter. Wherever he goes he carries the atmosphere of the card room
with him and the "blinding glare of the electrics." In Greece he makes love when he has leisure,
but he makes "copy" much more ardently, and on the whole is quite as lurid and sordid and showy
as his worst Sunday editions. Some good bits of battle descriptions there are, of the "Red
Badge of Courage" order, but one cannot make a novel of clever descriptions of earthworks and
poker games. The book concerns itself not with large, universal interests or principles, but
with a yellow journalist grinding out yellow copy in such a wooden fashion that the Sunday
"Eclipse" must have been even worse than most. In spite of the fact that Mr. Crane has written
some of the most artistic short stories in the English language, I begin to wonder whether,
blinded by his youth and audacity, two qualities which the American people love, we have not
taken him too seriously. It is a grave matter for a man in good health and with a bank account
to have written a book so coarse and dull and charmless as "Active Service." Compared with
this "War was kind," indeed.

Frank Norris

A new and a great book has been written. The name of it is "McTeague, a Story of San Francisco,"
and the man who wrote it is Mr. Frank Norris. The great presses of the country go on year after
year grinding out commonplace books, just as each generation goes on busily reproducing its
own mediocrity. When in this enormous output of ink and paper, these thousands of volumes that
are yearly rushed upon the shelves of the book stores, one appears which contains both power
and promise, the reader may be pardoned some enthusiasm. Excellence always surprises: we are
never quite prepared for it. In the case of "McTeague, a Story of San Francisco," it is even
more surprising than usual. In the first place the title is not alluring, and not until you
have read the book, can you know that there is an admirable consistency in the stiff, uncompromising
commonplaceness of that title. In the second place the name of the author is as yet comparatively
unfamiliar, and finally the book is dedicated to a member of the Harvard faculty, suggesting
that whether it be a story of San Francisco or Dawson City, it must necessarily be vaporous,
introspective and chiefly concerned with "literary" impressions. Mr. Norris is, indeed, a "Harvard
man," but that he is a good many other kinds of a man is self-evident. His book is, in the
language of Mr. Norman Hapgood, the work of "a large human being, with a firm stomach, who
knows and loves the people."

In a novel of such high merit as this, the subject matter is the least important consideration.
Every newspaper contains the essential material for another "Comedie Humaine." In this case
"McTeague," the central figure, happens to be a dentist practicing in a little side street
of San Francisco. The novel opens with this description of him:

    "It was Sunday, and, according to his custom on that day,
    McTeague took his dinner at two in the afternoon at the car
    conductor's coffee joint on Polk street. He had a thick,
    gray soup, heavy, underdone meat, very hot, on a cold plate;
    two kinds of vegetables; and a sort of suet pudding, full of
    strong butter and sugar. Once in his office, or, as he
    called it on his sign-board, 'Dental Parlors,' he took off
    his coat and shoes, unbuttoned his vest, and, having crammed
    his little stove with coke, he lay back in his operating
    chair at the bay window, reading the paper, drinking steam
    beer, and smoking his huge porcelain pipe while his food
    digested; crop-full, stupid and warm."

McTeague had grown up in a mining camp in the mountains. He remembered the years he had spent
there trundling heavy cars of ore in and out of the tunnel under the direction of his father.
For thirteen days out of each fortnight his father was a steady, hard-working shift-boss of
the mine. Every other Sunday he became an irresponsible animal, a beast, a brute, crazed with
alcohol. His mother cooked for the miners. Her one ambition was that her son should enter a
profession. He was apprenticed to a traveling quack dentist and after a fashion, learned the
business.

    "Then one day at San Francisco had come the news of his
    mother's death; she had left him some money--not much, but
    enough to set him up in business; so he had cut loose from
    the charlatan and had opened his 'Dental Parlors' on Polk
    street, an 'accommodation street' of small shops in the
    residence quarter of the town. Here he had slowly collected
    a clientele of butcher boys, shop girls, drug clerks and car
    conductors. He made but few acquaintances. Polk street
    called him the 'doctor' and spoke of his enormous strength.
    For McTeague was a young giant, carrying his huge shock of
    blonde hair six feet three inches from the ground; moving
    his immense limbs, heavy with ropes of muscle, slowly,
    ponderously. His hands were enormous, red, and covered with
    a fell of stiff yellow hair; they were as hard as wooden
    mallets, strong as vices, the hands of the old-time car boy.
    Often he dispensed with forceps and extracted a refractory
    tooth with his thumb and finger. His head was square-cut,
    angular; the jaw salient: like that of the carnivora.

    "But for one thing McTeague would have been perfectly
    contented. Just outside his window was his signboard--a
    modest affair--that read: 'Doctor McTeague. Dental Parlors.
    Gas Given;' but that was all. It was his ambition, his
    dream, to have projecting from that corner window a huge
    gilded tooth, a molar with enormous prongs, something
    gorgeous and attractive. He would have it some day, but as
    yet it was far beyond his means."

Then Mr. Norris launches into a description of the street in which "McTeague" lives. He presents
that street as it is on Sunday, as it is on working days; as it is in the early dawn when the
workmen are going out with pickaxes on their shoulders, as it is at ten o'clock when the women
are out purchasing from the small shopkeepers, as it is at night when the shop girls are out
with the soda-fountain tenders and the motor cars dash by full of theatre-goers, and the Salvationists
sing before the saloon on the corner. In four pages he reproduces the life in a by-street of
a great city, the little tragedy of the small shopkeeper. There are many ways of handling environment--most
of them bad. When a young author has very little to say and no story worth telling, he resorts
to environment. It is frequently used to disguise a weakness of structure, as ladies who paint
landscapes put their cows knee-deep in water to conceal the defective drawing of the legs.
But such description as one meets throughout Mr. Norris' book is in itself convincing proof
of power, imagination and literary skill. It is a positive and active force, stimulating the
reader's imagination, giving him an actual command, a realizing sense of this world into which
he is suddenly transplanted. It gives to the book perspective, atmosphere, effects of time
and distance, creates the illusion of life. This power of mature, and accurate and comprehensive
description is very unusual among the younger American writers. Most of them observe the world
through a temperament, and are more occupied with their medium than the objects they see. And
temperament is a glass which distorts most astonishingly. But this young man sees with a clear
eye, and reproduces with a touch firm and decisive, strong almost to brutalness. Yet this hand
that can depict so powerfully the brute strength and brute passions of a "McTeague," can deal
very finely and adroitly with the feminine element of his story. This is his portrait of the
little Swiss girl, "Trina," whom the dentist marries:

    "Trina was very small and prettily made. Her face was round
    and rather pale; her eyes long and narrow and blue, like the
    half-opened eyes of a baby; her lips and the lobes of her
    tiny ears were pale, a little suggestive of anaemia. But it
    was to her hair that one's attention was most attracted.
    Heaps and heaps of blue-black coils and braids, a royal
    crown of swarthy bands, a veritable sable tiara, heavy,
    abundant and odorous. All the vitality that should have
    given color to her face seemed to have been absorbed by that
    marvelous hair: It was the coiffure of a queen that shadowed
    the temples of this little bourgeoise."

The tragedy of the story dates from a chance, a seeming stroke of good fortune, one of those
terrible gifts of the Danai. A few weeks before her marriage "Trina" drew $5 000 from a lottery
ticket. From that moment her passion for hoarding money becomes the dominant theme of the story,
takes command of the book and its characters. After their marriage the dentist is disbarred
from practice. They move into a garret where she starves her husband and herself to save that
precious hoard. She sells even his office furniture, everything but his concertina and his
canary bird, with which he stubbornly refuses to part and which are destined to become very
important accessories in the property room of the theatre where this drama is played. This
removal from their first home is to this story what Gervaise's removal from her shop is to
L'Assommoir; it is the fatal episode of the third act, the sacrifice of self-respect, the beginning
of the end. From that time the money stands between "Trina" and her husband. Outraged and humiliated,
hating her for her meanness, demoralized by his idleness and despair, he begins to abuse her.
The story becomes a careful and painful study of the disintegration of this union, a penetrating
and searching analysis of the degeneration of these two souls, the woman's corroded by greed,
the man's poisoned by disappointment and hate.

And all the while this same painful theme is placed in a lower key. Maria, the housemaid who
took care of "McTeague's" dental parlors in his better days, was a half-crazy girl from somewhere
in Central America, she herself did not remember just where. But she had a wonderful story
about her people owning a dinner service of pure gold with a punch bowl you could scarcely
lift, which rang like a church bell when you struck it. On the strength of this story "Zercow,"
the Jew junk man, marries her, and believing that she knows where this treasure is hidden,
bullies and tortures her to force her to disclose her secret. At last "Maria" is found with
her throat cut, and "Zercow" is picked up by the wharf with a sack full of rusty tin cans,
which in his dementia he must have thought the fabled dinner service of gold.

From this it is a short step to "McTeague's" crime. He kills his wife to get possession of
her money, and escapes to the mountains. While he is on his way south, pushing toward Mexico,
he is overtaken by his murdered wife's cousin and former suitor. Both men are half mad with
thirst, and there in the desert wastes of Death's Valley, they spring to their last conflict.
The cousin falls, but before he dies he slips a handcuff over "McTeague's" arm, and so the
author leaves his hero in the wastes of Death's Valley, a hundred miles from water, with a
dead man chained to his arm. As he stands there the canary bird, the survivor of his happier
days, to which he had clung with stubborn affection, begins "chittering feebly in its little
gilt prison." It reminds one a little of Stevenson's use of poor "Goddedaal's" canary in "The
Wrecker." It is just such sharp, sure strokes that bring out the high lights in a story and
separate excellence from the commonplace. They are at once dramatic and revelatory. Lacking
them, a novel which may otherwise be a good one, lacks its chief reason for being. The fault
with many worthy attempts at fiction lies not in what they are, but in what they are not.

Mr. Norris' model, if he will admit that he has followed one, is clearly no less a person than
M. Zola himself. Yet there is no discoverable trace of imitation in his book. He has simply
taken a method which has been most successfully applied in the study of French life and applied
it in studying American life, as one uses certain algebraic formulae to solve certain problems.
It is perhaps the only truthful literary method of dealing with that part of society which
environment and heredity hedge about like the walls of a prison. It is true that Mr. Norris
now and then allows his "method" to become too prominent, that his restraint savors of constraint,
yet he has written a true story of the people, courageous, dramatic, full of matter and warm
with life. He has addressed himself seriously to art, and he seems to have no ambition to be
clever. His horizon is wide, his invention vigorous and bold, his touch heavy and warm and
human. This man is not limited by literary prejudices: he sees the people as they are, he is
close to them and not afraid of their unloveliness. He has looked at truth in the depths, among
men begrimed by toil and besotted by ignorance, and still found her fair. "McTeague" is an
achievement for a young man. It may not win at once the success which it deserves, but Mr.
Norris is one of those who can afford to wait.

                                    The Courier, April 8, 1899

If you want to read a story that is all wheat and no chaff, read "Blix." Last winter that brilliant
young Californian, Mr. Norris, published a remarkable and gloomy novel, "McTeague," a book
deep in insight, rich in promise and splendid in execution, but entirely without charm and
as disagreeable as only a great piece of work can be. And now this gentleman, who is not yet
thirty, turns around and gives us an idyll that sings through one's brain like a summer wind
and makes one feel young enough to commit all manner of indiscretions. It may be that Mr. Norris
is desirous of showing us his versatility and that he can follow any suit, or it may have been
a process of reaction. I believe it was after M. Zola had completed one of his greatest and
darkest novels of Parisian life that he went down to the seaside and wrote "La Reve," a book
that every girl should read when she is eighteen, and then again when she is eighty. Powerful
and solidly built as "McTeague" is, one felt that there method was carried almost too far,
that Mr. Norris was too consciously influenced by his French masters. But "Blix" belongs to
no school whatever, and there is not a shadow of pedantry or pride of craft in it from cover
to cover. "Blix" herself is the method, the motives and the aim of the book. The story is an
exhalation of youth and spring; it is the work of a man who breaks loose and forgets himself.
Mr. Norris was married only last summer, and the march from "Lohengrin" is simply sticking
out all over "Blix." It is the story of a San Francisco newspaper man and a girl. The newspaper
man "came out" in fiction, so to speak, in the drawing room of Mr. Richard Harding Davis, and
has languished under that gentleman's chaperonage until he has come to be regarded as a fellow
careful of nothing but his toilet and his dinner. Mr. Davis' reporters all bathed regularly
and all ate nice things, but beyond that their tastes were rather colorless. I am glad to see
one red-blooded newspaper man, in the person of "Landy Rivers," of San Francisco, break into
fiction; a real live reporter with no sentimental loyalty for his "paper," and no Byronic poses
about his vices, and no astonishing taste about his clothes, and no money whatever, which is
the natural and normal condition of all reporters. "Blix" herself was just a society girl,
and "Landy" took her to theatres and parties and tried to make himself believe he was in love
with her. But it wouldn't work, for "Landy" couldn't love a society girl, not though she were
as beautiful as the morning and terrible as an army with banners, and had "round full arms,"
and "the skin of her face was white and clean, except where it flushed into a most charming
pink upon her smooth, cool cheeks." For while "Landy Rivers" was at college he had been seized
with the penchant for writing short stories, and had worshiped at the shrines of Maupassant
and Kipling, and when a man is craft mad enough to worship Maupassant truly and know him well,
when he has that tingling for technique in his fingers, not Aphrodite herself, new risen from
the waves, could tempt him into any world where craft was not lord and king. So it happened
that their real love affair never began until one morning when "Landy" had to go down to the
wharf to write up a whaleback, and "Blix" went along, and an old sailor told them a story and
"Blix" recognized the literary possibilities of it, and they had lunch in a Chinese restaurant,
and "Landy" because he was a newspaper man and it was the end of the week, didn't have any
change about his clothes, and "Blix" had to pay the bill. And it was in that green old tea
house that "Landy" read "Blix" one of his favorite yarns by Kipling, and she in a calm, off-handed
way, recognized one of the fine, technical points in it, and "Landy" almost went to pieces
for joy of her doing it. And whilst they waited for his answer, a mighty battle was fought out
within his soul. The power so suddenly, so unexpectedly, thrust within his reach, and offered
him if he would but open his hands to grasp it, dazzled him for one little moment. As in a
flash he saw himself Lord of Babbiano. He beheld a proud career of knightly deeds that should
cause his name and that of Babbiano to ring throughout the length and breadth of Italy. From the obscure
state that it was, his patriotism and his skill as a condottiero should render it one of the
great Italian powers--the rival of Florence, of Venice or Milan. He had a vision of widened territories,
and of neighbouring lords becoming vassals to his might. He saw himself wresting Romagna mile
by mile from the sway of the ribald Borgia, hunting him to the death as he was wont to hunt the
boar in the marshes of Commachio, or driving him into the very Vatican to seek shelter within his
father's gates--the last strip of soil that he would leave him to lord it over. He dreamt of a Babbiano
courted by the great republics, and the honour of its alliance craved by them that they might
withstand the onslaughts of French and Spaniard.

                                 All this he saw in that fleeting vision of his, and Temptation caught
his martial spirit in a grip of steel.

And then another picture rose before his eyes.

What would he do in times of peace? His was a soul that pined in palaces. He was born to the
camp, and not to the vapid air of courts. In exchange for this power that was offered him what must
he give? His glorious liberty. Become their lord in many things, to be their slave in more. Nominally
to rule, but actually to be ruled, until, should he fail to do his rulers' will, there would
be some night another meeting such as this, in which men would plot
to encompass his downfall and to supplant him as he was invited to
supplant Gian Maria.

Lastly, he bethought him of the man whose power he was bidden to usurp. His own cousin, his father's
sister's son, in whose veins ran the same blood as in his own.

He raised his head at last, and met those anxious faces on which the fitful light was casting harsh
shadows. The pale ghost of a smile hovered for a second on the corners of his stern mouth.

"I
thank you, sirs, for the honour you have done me," he made answer slowly, "an honour of which
I fear I am all unworthy."

In strenuous chorus their voices rose to contradict him.

"At least, then, an honour which I cannot accept."

There was a moment's silence, and their faces from eager that they had been, grew downcast to
the point of sullenness.

"But why, my lord?" cried old Fabrizio at last, his arms outstretched
towards the Count, his voice quivering with intensity. "Santissima
Vergine! Why?"

"Because--to give you but one reason out of many--the
man you ask me to overthrow and supplant is of my own blood." And
but that his tone was calm they might have held that he rebuked them.

"I
had thought," hazarded seriously the gay Fanfulla, "that with such
a man as your Excellency, patriotism and the love of Babbiano would
have weighed even more than the ties of blood." The important point is that a man
considerably under thirty could take up a subject so grim and unattractive, and that, for the
mere love of doing things well, he was able to hold himself down to the task of developing
it completely, that he was able to justify this quack's existence in literature, to thrust
this hairy, blonde dentist with the "salient jaw of the carnivora," in amongst the immortals.

It was after M. Zola had completed one of the greatest and gloomiest of his novels of Parisian
life, that he went down by the sea and wrote "La Reve," that tender, adolescent story of love
and purity and youth. So, almost simultaneously with "McTeague," Mr. Norris published "Blix,"
another San Francisco story, as short as "McTeague" was lengthy, as light as "McTeague" was
heavy, as poetic and graceful as "McTeague" was somber and charmless. Here is a man worth waiting
on; a man who is both realist and poet, a man who can teach

    "Not only by a comet's rush,
  But by a rose's birth."

Yet unlike as they are, in both books the source of power is the same, and, for that matter,
it was even the same in his first book, "Moran of the Lady Letty." Mr. Norris has dispensed
with the conventional symbols that have crept into art, with the trite, half-truths and circumlocutions,
and got back to the physical basis of things. He has abjured tea-table psychology, and the
analysis of figures in the carpet and subtile dissections of intellectual impotencies, and
the diverting game of words and the whole literature of the nerves. He is big and warm and
sometimes brutal, and the strength of the soil comes up to him with very little loss in the
transmission. His art strikes deep down into the roots of life and the foundation of Things
as They Are--not as we tell each other they are at the tea-table. But he is realistic art,
not artistic realism. He is courageous, but he is without bravado.

He sees things freshly, as though they had not been seen before, and describes them with singular
directness and vividness, not with morbid acuteness, with a large, wholesome joy of life. Nowhere
is this more evident than in his insistent use of environment. I recall the passage in which
he describes the street in which McTeague lives.

Mr. Norris approaches things on their physical side; his characters are personalities of flesh
before they are anything else, types before they are individuals. Especially is this true of
his women. In this grasp of the element of things, this keen, clean, frank pleasure at color
and odor and warmth, this candid admission of the negative of beauty, which is co-existent
with and inseparable from it, lie much of his power and promise. Here is a man catholic enough
to include the extremes of physical and moral life, strong enough to handle the crudest colors
and darkest shadows. Here is a man who has an appetite for the physical universe, who loves
the rank smells of crowded alley-ways, or the odors of boudoirs, or the delicate perfume exhaled
from a woman's skin; who is not afraid of Pan, be he ever so shaggy, and redolent of the herd.

Structurally, where most young novelists are weak, Mr. Norris is very strong. He has studied
the best French masters, and he has adopted their methods quite simply, as one selects an algebraic
formula to solve his particular problem. As to his style, that is, as expression always is,
just as vigorous as his thought compels it to be, just as vivid as his conception warrants.
If God Almighty has given a man ideas, he will get himself a style from one source or another.
Mr. Norris, fortunately, is not a conscious stylist. He has too much to say to be exquisitely
vain about his medium. He has the kind of brain stuff that would vanquish difficulties in any
profession, that might be put to building battleships, or solving problems of finance, or to
devising colonial policies. Let us be thankful that he has put it to literature. Let us be
thankful, moreover, that he is not introspective and that his intellect does not devour itself,
but feeds upon the great race of man, and, above all, let us rejoice that he is not a "temperamental"
artist, but something larger, for a great brain and an assertive temperament seldom dwell together.

There are clever men enough in the field of American letters, and the fault of most of them
is merely one of magnitude; they are not large enough; they travel in small orbits, they play
on muted strings. They sing neither of the combats of Atriedes nor the labors of Cadmus, but
of the tea-table and the Odyssey of the Rialto. Flaubert said that a drop of water contained
all the elements of the sea, save one--immensity. Mr. Norris is concerned only with serious
things, he has only large ambitions. His brush is bold, his color is taken fresh from the kindly
earth, his canvas is large enough to hold American life, the real life of the people. He has
come into the court of the troubadours singing the song of Elys, the song of warm, full nature.
He has struck the true note of the common life. He is what Mr. Norman Hapgood said the great
American dramatist must be: "A large human being, with a firm stomach, who knows and loves
the people."

When I Knew Stephen Crane

It was, I think, in the spring of '94 that a slender, narrow-chested fellow in a shabby grey
suit, with a soft felt hat pulled low over his eyes, sauntered into the office of the managing
editor of the Nebraska State Journal and introduced himself as Stephen Crane. He stated that
he was going to Mexico to do some work for the Bacheller Syndicate and get rid of his cough,
and that he would be stopping in Lincoln for a few days. Later he explained that he was out
of money and would be compelled to wait until he got a check from the East before he went further.
I was a Junior at the Nebraska State University at the time, and was doing some work for the
State Journal in my leisure time, and I happened to be in the managing editor's room when Mr.
Crane introduced himself. I was just off the range; I knew a little Greek and something about
cattle and a good horse when I saw one, and beyond horses and cattle I considered nothing of
vital importance except good stories and the people who wrote them. This was the first man
of letters I had ever met in the flesh, and when the young man announced who he was, I dropped
into a chair behind the editor's desk where I could stare at him without being too much in
evidence.

Only a very youthful enthusiasm and a large propensity for hero worship could have found anything
impressive in the young man who stood before the managing editor's desk. He was thin to emaciation,
his face was gaunt and unshaven, a thin dark moustache straggled on his upper lip, his black
hair grew low on his forehead and was shaggy and unkempt. His grey clothes were much the worse
for wear and fitted him so badly it seemed unlikely he had ever been measured for them. He
wore a flannel shirt and a slovenly apology for a necktie, and his shoes were dusty and worn
gray about the toes and were badly run over at the heel. I had seen many a tramp printer come
up the Journal stairs to hunt a job, but never one who presented such a disreputable appearance
as this story-maker man. He wore gloves, which seemed rather a contradiction to the general
slovenliness of his attire, but when he took them off to search his pockets for his credentials,
I noticed that his hands were singularly fine; long, white, and delicately shaped, with thin,
nervous fingers. I have seen pictures of Aubrey Beardsley's hands that recalled Crane's very
vividly.

At that time Crane was but twenty-four, and almost an unknown man. Hamlin Garland had seen
some of his work and believed in him, and had introduced him to Mr. Howells, who recommended
him to the Bacheller Syndicate. "The Red Badge of Courage" had been published in the State
Journal that winter along with a lot of other syndicate matter, and the grammatical construction
of the story was so faulty that the managing editor had several times called on me to edit
the copy. In this way I had read it very carefully, and through the careless sentence-structure
I saw the wonder of that remarkable performance. But the grammar certainly was bad. I remember
one of the reporters who had corrected the phrase "it don't" for the tenth time remarked savagely,
"If I couldn't write better English than this, I'd quit."

Crane spent several days in the town, living from hand to mouth and waiting for his money.
I think he borrowed a small amount from the managing editor. He lounged about the office most
of the time, and I frequently encountered him going in and out of the cheap restaurants on
Tenth Street. When he was at the office he talked a good deal in a wandering, absent-minded
fashion, and his conversation was uniformly frivolous. If he could not evade a serious question
by a joke, he bolted. I cut my classes to lie in wait for him, confident that in some unwary
moment I could trap him into serious conversation, that if one burned incense long enough and
ardently enough, the oracle would not be dumb. I was Maupassant mad at the time, a malady particularly
unattractive in a Junior, and I made a frantic effort to get an expression of opinion from
him on "Le Bonheur." "Oh, you're Moping, are you?" he remarked with a sarcastic grin, and went
on reading a little volume of Poe that he carried in his pocket. At another time I cornered
him in the Funny Man's room and succeeded in getting a little out of him. We were taught literature
by an exceedingly analytical method at the University, and we probably distorted the method,
and I was busy trying to find the least common multiple of Hamlet and the greatest common divisor
of Macbeth, and I began asking him whether stories were constructed by cabalistic formulae.
At length he sighed wearily and shook his drooping shoulders, remarking:

"Where did you get all that rot? Yarns aren't done by mathematics. You can't do it by rule
any more than you can dance by rule. You have to have the itch of the thing in your fingers,
and if you haven't,--well, you're damned lucky, and you'll live long and prosper, that's all."--And
with that he yawned and went down the hall.

Crane was moody most of the time, his health was bad and he seemed profoundly discouraged.
Even his jokes were exceedingly drastic. He went about with the tense, preoccupied, self-centered
air of a man who is brooding over some impending disaster, and I conjectured vainly as to what
it might be. Though he was seemingly entirely idle during the few days I knew him, his manner
indicated that he was in the throes of work that told terribly on his nerves. His eyes I remember
as the finest I have ever seen, large and dark and full of lustre and changing lights, but
with a profound melancholy always lurking deep in them. They were eyes that seemed to be burning
themselves out.

As he sat at the desk with his shoulders drooping forward, his head low, and his long, white
fingers drumming on the sheets of copy paper, he was as nervous as a race horse fretting to
be on the track. Always, as he came and went about the halls, he seemed like a man preparing
for a sudden departure. Now that he is dead it occurs to me that all his life was a preparation
for sudden departure. I remember once when he was writing a letter he stopped and asked me
about the spelling of a word, saying carelessly, "I haven't time to learn to spell."

Then, glancing down at his attire, he added with an absent-minded smile, "I haven't time to
dress either; it takes an awful slice out of a fellow's life."

He said he was poor, and he certainly looked it, but four years later when he was in Cuba,
drawing the largest salary ever paid a newspaper correspondent, he clung to this same untidy
manner of dress, and his ragged overalls and buttonless shirt were eyesores to the immaculate
Mr. Davis, in his spotless linen and neat khaki uniform, with his Gibson chin always freshly
shaven. When I first heard of his serious illness, his old throat trouble aggravated into consumption
by his reckless exposure in Cuba, I recalled a passage from Maeterlinck's essay, "The Pre-Destined,"
on those doomed to early death: "As children, life seems nearer to them than to other children.
They appear to know nothing, and yet there is in their eyes so profound a certainty that we
feel they must know all.--In all haste, but wisely and with minute care do they prepare themselves
to live, and this very haste is a sign upon which mothers can scarce bring themselves to look."
I remembered, too, the young man's melancholy and his tenseness, his burning eyes, and his
way of slurring over the less important things, as one whose time is short.

I have heard other people say how difficult it was to induce Crane to talk seriously about
his work, and I suspect that he was particularly averse to discussions with literary men of
wider education and better equipment than himself, yet he seemed to feel that this fuller culture
was not for him. Perhaps the unreasoning instinct which lies deep in the roots of our lives,
and which guides us all, told him that he had not time enough to acquire it.

Men will sometimes reveal themselves to children, or to people whom they think never to see
again, more completely than they ever do to their confreres. From the wise we hold back alike
our folly and our wisdom, and for the recipients of our deeper confidences we seldom select
our equals. The soul has no message for the friends with whom we dine every week. It is silenced
by custom and convention, and we play only in the shallows. It selects its listeners willfully,
and seemingly delights to waste its best upon the chance wayfarer who meets us in the highway
at a fated hour. There are moments too, when the tides run high or very low, when self-revelation
is necessary to every man, if it be only to his valet or his gardener. At such a moment, I
was with Mr. Crane.

The hoped for revelation came unexpectedly enough. It was on the last night he spent in Lincoln.
I had come back from the theatre and was in the Journal office writing a notice of the play.
It was eleven o'clock when Crane came in. He had expected his money to arrive on the night
mail and it had not done so, and he was out of sorts and deeply despondent. He sat down on
the ledge of the open window that faced on the street, and when I had finished my notice I
went over and took a chair beside him. Quite without invitation on my part, Crane began to
talk, began to curse his trade from the first throb of creative desire in a boy to the finished
work of the master. The night was oppressively warm; one of those dry winds that are the curse
of that country was blowing up from Kansas. The white, western moonlight threw sharp, blue
shadows below us. The streets were silent at that hour, and we could hear the gurgle of the
fountain in the Post Office square across the street, and the twang of banjos from the lower
verandah of the Hotel Lincoln, where the colored waiters were serenading the guests. The drop
lights in the office were dull under their green shades, and the telegraph sounder clicked
faintly in the next room. In all his long tirade, Crane never raised his voice; he spoke slowly
and monotonously and even calmly, but I have never known so bitter a heart in any man as he
revealed to me that night. It was an arraignment of the wages of life, an invocation to the
ministers of hate.

Incidentally he told me the sum he had received for "The Red Badge of Courage," which I think
was something like ninety dollars, and he repeated some lines from "The Black Riders," which
was then in preparation. He gave me to understand that he led a double literary life; writing
in the first place the matter that pleased himself, and doing it very slowly; in the second
place, any sort of stuff that would sell. And he remarked that his poor was just as bad as
it could possibly be. He realized, he said, that his limitations were absolutely impassable.
"What I can't do, I can't do at all, and I can't acquire it. I only hold one trump."

He had no settled plans at all. He was going to Mexico wholly uncertain of being able to do
any successful work there, and he seemed to feel very insecure about the financial end of his
venture. The thing that most interested me was what he said about his slow method of composition.
He declared that there was little money in story-writing at best, and practically none in it
for him, because of the time it took him to work up his detail. Other men, he said, could sit
down and write up an experience while the physical effect of it, so to speak, was still upon
them, and yesterday's impressions made to-day's "copy." But when he came in from the streets
to write up what he had seen there, his faculties were benumbed, and he sat twirling his pencil
and hunting for words like a schoolboy.

I mentioned "The Red Badge of Courage," which was written in nine days, and he replied that,
though the writing took very little time, he had been unconsciously working the detail of the
story out through most of his boyhood. His ancestors had been soldiers, and he had been imagining
war stories ever since he was out of knickerbockers, and in writing his first war story he
had simply gone over his imaginary campaigns and selected his favorite imaginary experiences.
He declared that his imagination was hide bound; it was there, but it pulled hard. After he
got a notion for a story, months passed before he could get any sort of personal contract with
it, or feel any potency to handle it. "The detail of a thing has to filter through my blood,
and then it comes out like a native product, but it takes forever," he remarked. I distinctly
remember the illustration, for it rather took hold of me.

I have often been astonished since to hear Crane spoken of as "the reporter in fiction," for
the reportorial faculty of superficial reception and quick transference was what he conspicuously
lacked. His first newspaper account of his shipwreck on the filibuster "Commodore" off the
Florida coast was as lifeless as the "copy" of a police court reporter. It was many months
afterwards that the literary product of his terrible experience appeared in that marvellous
sea story "The Open Boat," unsurpassed in its vividness and constructive perfection.

At the close of our long conversation that night, when the copy boy came in to take me home,
I suggested to Crane that in ten years he would probably laugh at all his temporary discomfort.
Again his body took on that strenuous tension and he clenched his hands, saying, "I can't wait
ten years, I haven't time."

The ten years are not up yet, and he has done his work and gathered his reward and gone. Was
ever so much experience and achievement crowded into so short a space of time? A great man
dead at twenty-nine! That would have puzzled the ancients. Edward Garnett wrote of him in The
Academy of December 17, 1899: "I cannot remember a parallel in the literary history of fiction.
Maupassant, Meredith, Henry James, Mr. Howells and Tolstoy, were all learning their expression
at an age where Crane had achieved his and achieved it triumphantly." He had the precocity
of those doomed to die in youth. I am convinced that when I met him he had a vague premonition
of the shortness of his working day, and in the heart of the man there was that which said,
"That thou doest, do quickly."

At twenty-one this son of an obscure New Jersey rector, with but a scant reading knowledge
of French and no training, had rivaled in technique the foremost craftsmen of the Latin races.
In the six years since I met him, a stranded reporter, he stood in the firing line during two
wars, knew hairbreadth 'scapes on land and sea, and established himself as the first writer
of his time in the picturing of episodic, fragmentary life. His friends have charged him with
fickleness, but he was a man who was in the preoccupation of haste. He went from country to
country, from man to man, absorbing all that was in them for him. He had no time to look backward.
He had no leisure for camaraderie. He drank life to the lees, but at the banquet table where
other men took their ease and jested over their wine, he stood a dark and silent figure, sombre
as Poe himself, not wishing to be understood; and he took his portion in haste, with his loins
girded, and his shoes on his feet, and his staff in his hand, like one who must depart quickly.

On the Art of Fiction

One is sometimes asked about the "obstacles" that confront young writers who are trying to
do good work. I should say the greatest obstacles that writers today have to get over, are
the dazzling journalistic successes of twenty years ago, stories that surprised and delighted
by their sharp photographic detail and that were really nothing more than lively pieces of
reporting. The whole aim of that school of writing was novelty--never a very important thing
in art. They gave us, altogether, poor standards--taught us to multiply our ideas instead of
to condense them. They tried to make a story out of every theme that occurred to them and to
get returns on every situation that suggested itself. They got returns, of a kind. But their
work, when one looks back on it, now that the novelty upon which they counted so much is gone,
is journalistic and thin. The especial merit of a good reportorial story is that it shall be
intensely interesting and pertinent today and shall have lost its point by tomorrow.

Art, it seems to me, should simplify. That, indeed, is very nearly the whole of the higher
artistic process; finding what conventions of form and what detail one can do without and yet
preserve the spirit of the whole--so that all that one has suppressed and cut away is there
to the reader's consciousness as much as if it were in type on the page. Millet had done hundreds
of sketches of peasants sowing grain, some of them very complicated and interesting, but when
he came to paint the spirit of them all into one picture, "The Sower," the composition is so
simple that it seems inevitable. All the discarded sketches that went before made the picture
what it finally became, and the process was all the time one of simplifying, of sacrificing
many conceptions good in themselves for one that was better and more universal.

Any first rate novel or story must have in it the strength of a dozen fairly good stories that
have been sacrificed to it. A good workman can't be a cheap workman; he can't be stingy about
wasting material, and he cannot compromise. Writing ought either to be the manufacture of stories
for which there is a market demand--a business as safe and commendable as making soap or breakfast
foods--or it should be an art, which is always a search for something for which there is no
market demand, something new and untried, where the values are intrinsic and have nothing to
do with standardized values. The courage to go on without compromise does not come to a writer
all at once--nor, for that matter, does the ability. Both are phases of natural development.
In the beginning the artist, like his public, is wedded to old forms, old ideals, and his vision
is blurred by the memory of old delights he would like to recapture.
