I have shown that slavery was regarded as a political, moral, and social evil, by the founders
of this Republic, and by able Southern statesmen within thirty years; that their anxious query
has been, "what is to be done with it?" We are now asked to discredit those men, and give ear
to a modern creed, that slavery is not only necessary, but beneficent--a divine ordinance--and
that Southern non-slaveholders, even, are prosperous and elevated just in proportion to the
number of slaves owned by their neighbors.

Not such, sir, were the "speculations" of the fathers of the Republic; nor is the world to
be deceived by such assumptions. Decree and carry out what non-intercourse you will; surround
yourselves with barriers as impassable as the Chinese wall, or the great gulf between Dives
and Lazarus, still the evidences of your condition will exist on the imperishable pages of
history, in the records left by the mighty and venerated dead; and the attempt to establish
the belief that slavery is a universal blessing will be received but as an aggression upon
the credulity of mankind.

Forty years ago, a slave Territory applied for admission to the Union as a State. The friends
of freedom objected that its reception would be contrary to the policy of our Government. "Admit
it," it was urged, "with its present Constitution, and we will consent to a line of demarkation,
north of which slavery shall never pass." This was solemnly agreed to before the whole world;
and this compact, forced upon the country by the slave power, was claimed by it as a great
triumph of slavery. Men at the North felt that this was a great aggression, a great outrage
upon freedom; yet, to give quiet and restore harmony, they submitted, consoled by the national
pledge that slavery should be extended no further, and believing that the nation might joyously
look forward to long years of happiness and repose. But despotism is ever restless and grasping;
but twenty-five years rolled by--a very short period in the life of a nation--ere Texas was
admitted to the Union, that slavery propagandists could have a wider field for their operations.
As everybody foresaw, war ensued; and the best blood of the nation fattened the soil of Mexico.
More than two hundred millions of treasure were expended, and many thousand valuable lives
sacrificed. All over this land, "the sky was hung with blackness;" "mourning was spread over
the mountain tops." Territory enough was obtained to make four large States, well adapted to
the productive labor of human chattels, and this territory was blackened over with slavery.
Such a triumph ought to have satisfied the most grasping of the friends of this "peculiar institution;"
but the world should have known that nothing short of universal dominion would satisfy the
slave owner and slave breeder. Less than ten years after the annexation of Texas, it was discovered
by Southern men that there was a Territory west of Missouri, wherein the peculiar institution
of the South could be made profitable; but by a solemn league and covenant this land had been,
for more than a third of a century, consecrated to freedom. This bond of national faith, this
pledge of national honor, stood in the road of their ambition.

But men whose lives are but a series violations of the dearest rights that God has bestowed
on man cannot be expected to be bound by pledges of national faith and national honor. This
time-honored compact was annulled, the barrier between freedom and slavery broken down. The
whole country was astounded at the perfidy of the act.

But the climax was not reached. The Territory was overrun with desperadoes; ruffians from adjoining
States usurped the rights of actual settlers, stuffed ballot-boxes with illegal votes, and
elected members of their own lawless bands to the Legislature, to enact laws by which every
friend of freedom might be driven from the country.

Innocent and unoffending men were murdered in cold blood, houses were consumed with fire, hamlets
laid in smoking ruins, homeless and houseless innocents, women and tender children, were driven
forth, exposed to the winds and storms of heaven.

All these wrongs, all these outrages, all these crimes of blood and deeds of horror, were committed
to plant the accursed institution on the soil that had been, by a great national act, dedicated
to freedom. But violence and arson, bloodshed and murder, failed. The black banner of slavery
is trailing in the dust. The stars and stripes wave triumphantly over a free and joyous people.
The heretofore invincible is conquered. I have borrowed the word "aggression" to express the
conduct of the South toward the North. I do not intend to make the charge without the specifications.

1. I charge upon slavery, that the enforcement of the Missouri compromise was an aggression
upon the North.

2. I charge the annexation of Texas, whereby the Mexican war was brought upon the country,
more than two hundred millions of money were spent, and many thousand lives sacrificed, as
an aggression.

3. I charge that the adoption of the fugitive slave law, with many of its odious and obnoxious
provisions, was an aggression upon the people of the North.

4. I charge that the decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case was an aggression
upon the North. It was a decision made for the benefit of slavery, and to deprive the people
of the free States of their equal rights in the Territories.

5. I charge that the repeal of the Missouri compromise line was an outrageous aggression upon
the rights of the North; disreputable to the nation, and dishonorable to the party engaged
in it; one that has brought in its train innumerable woes, and created an excitement that will
not be allayed during the present generation.

6. I charge that the murders, robberies, and arsons, in Kansas, were aggressions of slavery.

All these things I have charged as aggressions of slavery are national aggressions, for which
the slavery party, having control of the administration of this Government, are responsible.
I charge them as direct, positive aggressions, on the rights of the free people of the North.
In addition to these great national aggressions, there are numerous similar infringements upon
the rights of individuals of the North--of tarring and feathering, of whipping--acts of such
barbarity and cruelty, that it would chill a man's blood to hear them recited.

Recently, a whole community of moral, peaceable citizens were driven from their homes, compelled
to abandon their property, and seek refuge in a free State, from the violence of slaveholders.
There are, no doubt, many good and humane men in slave States, who deprecate these wrongs;
but they dare not utter a word--every mouth must be stopped, every lip must be sealed, every
voice must be hushed, all must be silent as the grave--the most inexorable despotism reigns
supreme.
