It would be desirable to concentrate the chief events of the siege of Ostend so that they might
be presented to the reader's view in a single mass.  But this is impossible.  The siege was
essentially the war--as already observed--and it was bidding fair to protract itself to such
an extent that a respect for chronology requires the attention to be directed for a moment
to other topics.

The invasion of Ireland under Aquila, so pompously heralded as almost to suggest another grand
armada, had sailed in the beginning of the winter, and an army of six thousand men had been
landed at Kinsale.  Rarely had there been a better opportunity for the Celt to strike for his
independence.  Shane Mac Neil had an army on foot with which he felt confident of exterminating
the Saxon oppressor, even without the assistance of his peninsular allies; while the queen's
army, severely drawn upon as it had been for the exigencies of Vere and the States, might be
supposed unable to cope with so formidable a combination.  Yet Montjoy made short work of Aquila
and Tyrone.  The invaders, shut up in their meagre conquest, became the besieged instead of
the assailants. Tyrone made a feeble attempt to relieve his Spanish allies, but was soon driven
into his swamps, the peasants would not rise; in spite of proclamations and golden mountains
of promise, and Aquila was soon glad enough to sign a capitulation by which he saved a portion
of his army. "To bed then, if it must be!" and she slammed the casement.

"For her I might as well not exist!" thought Prince Andrew while he listened to her voice, for
some reason expecting yet fearing that she might say something about
him.

"There she is again! As if it were on purpose," thought he.

In his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful thoughts and hopes, contrary
to the whole tenor of his life, that unable to explain his condition to himself he lay down
and fell asleep at once.

CHAPTER III

Next morning, having taken leave of no one but the count, and not waiting for the ladies to appear,
Prince Andrew set off for home.

It was already the beginning of June when on his return journey he drove into the birch forest
where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and memorable an impression on him. In the forest
the harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before, for now all
was thick, shady, and dense, and the young firs dotted about in the forest did not jar on
the general beauty but, lending themselves to the mood around, were delicately green with
fluffy young shoots.

The whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, but only a small cloud had scattered
some raindrops lightly, sprinkling the road and the sappy leaves.

The left side of the forest was dark in the shade, the right side glittered in the sunlight, wet and shiny
and scarcely swayed by the breeze. Everything was in blossom, the nightingales trilled, and
their voices reverberated now near, now far away.

"Yes, here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed," thought Prince Andrew. "But where
is it?" he again wondered, gazing at the left side of the road, and
without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the very oak he
sought. The old oak, quite transfigured, spreading out a canopy of
sappy dark-green foliage, stood rapt and slightly trembling in the
rays of the evening sun. Neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor
old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now. Through the
hard century-old bark, even where there were no twigs, leaves had
sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have
produced.

"Yes, it is the same oak," thought Prince Andrew, and all
at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy
and renewal. All the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his
memory. Austerlitz with the lofty heavens, his wife's dead reproachful
face, Pierre at the ferry, that girl thrilled by the beauty of the
night, and that night itself and the moon, and.... all this rushed
suddenly to his mind.

"No, life is not over at thirty-one!" Prince
Andrew suddenly decided finally and decisively.  But he
had no intention of marching through Brussels, Ghent, and Bruges, to the Flemish coast.  His
old antagonist, the Admiral of Arragon, lay near Thienen in an entrenched camp, with a force
of at least fifteen thousand men, while the archduke, leaving Rivas in command before Ostend,
hovered in the neighbourhood of Brussels, with as many troops as could be spared from the various
Flemish garrisons, ready to support the admiral.

But Maurice tempted the admiral in vain with the chances of a general action.  That warrior,
remembering perhaps too distinctly his disasters at Nieuport, or feeling conscious that his
military genius was more fitly displayed in burning towns and villages in neutral territory,
robbing the peasantry, plundering gentlemen's castles and murdering the proprietors, than it
was like to be in a pitched battle with the first general of the age, remained sullenly within
his entrenchments.  His position was too strong and his force far too numerous to warrant an
attack by the stadholder upon his works.  After satisfying himself, therefore, that there was
no chance of an encounter in Brabant except at immense disadvantage, Maurice rapidly counter-marched
towards the lower Meuse, and on the 18th July laid siege to Grave.  The position and importance
of this city have been thoroughly set before the reader in a former volumes It is only necessary,
therefore, to recal the fact that, besides being a vital possession for the republic, the place
was in law the private property of the Orange family, having been a portion of the estate of
Count de Buren, afterwards redeemed on payment of a considerable sum of money by his son-in-law,
William the Silent, confirmed to him at the pacification of Ghent, and only lost to his children
by the disgraceful conduct of Captain Hamart, which had cost that officer his head.  Maurice
was determined at least that the place should not now slip through his fingers, and that the
present siege should be a masterpiece.  His forts, of which he had nearly fifty, were each
regularly furnished with moat, drawbridge, and bulwark.  His counterscarp and parapet, his
galleries, covered ways and mines, were as elaborate, massive, and artistically finished as
if he were building a city instead of besieging one. Buzanval, the French envoy, amazed at
the spectacle, protested that his works "were rather worthy of the grand Emperor of the Turks
than of, a little commonwealth, which only existed through the disorder of its enemies and
the assistance of its friends;" but he admitted the utility of the stadholder's proceedings
to be very obvious.

While the prince calmly sat before Grave, awaiting the inexorable hour for burghers and garrison
to surrender, the great Francis Mendoza, Admiral of Arragon, had been completing the arrangements
for his exchange.  A prisoner after the Nieuport battle, he had been assigned by Maurice, as
will be recollected, to his cousin, young Lewis Gunther, whose brilliant services as commander
of the cavalry had so much contributed to the victory.  The amount of ransom for so eminent
a captive could not fail to be large, and accordingly the thrifty Lewis William had congratulated
his brother on being able, although so young, thus to repair the fortunes of the family by
his military industry to a greater extent than had yet been accomplished by any of the race.
Subsequently, the admiral had been released on parole, the sum of his ransom having been fixed
at nearly one hundred thousand Flemish crowns. By an agreement now made by the States, with
consent of the Nassau family, the prisoner was definitely released, on condition of effecting
the exchange of all prisoners of the republic, now held in durance by Spain in any part of
the world.  This was in lieu of the hundred thousand crowns which were to be put into the impoverished
coffers of Lewis Gunther.  It may be imagined, as the hapless prisoners afterwards poured in--not
only from the peninsula, but from more distant regions, whither they had been sent by their
cruel taskmasters, some to relate their sufferings in the horrible dungeons of Spain, where
they had long been expiating the crime of defending their fatherland, others to relate their
experiences as chained galley-slaves in the naval service of their bitterest enemies, many
with shorn heads and long beards like Turks, many with crippled limbs, worn out with chains
and blows, and the squalor of disease and filth--that the hatred for Spain and Rome did not
glow any less fiercely within the republic, nor the hereditary love for the Nassaus, to whose
generosity these poor victims were indebted for their deliverance, become fainter, in consequence
of these revelations.  It was at first vehemently disputed by many that the admiral could be
exchanged as a prisoner of war, in respect to the manifold murders and other crimes which would
seem to authorize his trial and chastisement by the tribunals of the republic.  But it was
decided by the States that the sacred aegis of military law must be held to protect even so
bloodstained a criminal as he, and his release was accordingly effected.  Not long afterwards
he took his departure for Spain, where his reception was not enthusiastic.

From this epoch is to be dated a considerable reform in the laws regulating the exchange of
prisoners of war.--[Grotius]

While Maurice was occupied with the siege of Grave, and thus not only menacing an important
position, but spreading, danger and dismay over all Brabant and Flanders, it was necessary
for the archduke to detach so large a portion of his armies to observe his indefatigable and
scientific enemy, as to much weaken the vigour of the operations before Ostend. Moreover, the
execrable administration of his finances, and the dismal delays and sufferings of that siege;
had brought about another mutiny--on the whole, the most extensive, formidable, and methodical
of all that had hitherto occurred in the Spanish armies.

By midsummer, at least three thousand five hundred veterans, including a thousand of excellent
cavalry, the very best soldiers in the service, had seized the city of Hoogstraaten.  Here
they established themselves securely, and strengthened the fortifications; levying contributions
in corn, cattle, and every other necessary, besides wine, beer, and pocket- money, from the
whole country round with exemplary regularity.  As usual, disorder assumed the forms of absolute
order.  Anarchy became the best organized of governments; and it would have been difficult
to find in the world--outside the Dutch commonwealth--a single community where justice appeared
to be so promptly administered as in this temporary republic, founded upon rebellion and theft.

For; although a brotherhood of thieves, it rigorously punished such of its citizens as robbed
for their own, not for the public good.  The immense booty swept daily from the granges, castles;
and villages of Flanders was divided with the simplicity of early Christians, while the success
and steadiness of the operations paralyzed their sovereign, and was of considerable advantage
to the States.

Albert endeavoured in vain to negotiate with the rebels.  Nuncius Frangipani went to them in
person, but was received with calm derision. Pious exhortations might turn the keys of Paradise,
but gold alone, he was informed, would unlock the gates of Hoogstraaten.  In an evil hour the
cardinal-archduke was tempted to try the effect of sacerdotal thunder.  The ex-archbishop of
Toledo could not doubt that the terrors of the Church would make those brown veterans tremble
who could confront so tranquilly the spring-tides of the North Sea, and the batteries of Vere
and Nassau.  So he launched a manifesto, as highly spiced as a pamphlet of Marnig, and as severe
as a sentence of Torquemada.  Entirely against the advice of the States-General of the obedient
provinces, he denounced the mutineers as outlaws and accursed.  He called on persons of every
degree to kill any of them in any way, at any time, or in any place, promising that the slayer
of a private soldier should receive a reward of "ten crowns for each head" brought in, while
for a subaltern officer's head one hundred crowns were offered; for that of a superior officer
two hundred, and for that of the Eletto or chief magistrate, five hundred crowns.  Should the
slayer be himself a member of the mutiny, his crime of rebellion was to be forgiven, and the
price of murder duly paid.  All judges, magistrates, and provost-marshals were ordered to make
inventories of the goods, moveable and immoveable, of the mutineers, and of the clothing and
other articles belonging to their wives and children, all which property was to be brought
in and deposited in the hands of the proper functionaries of the archduke's camp, in order
that it might be duly incorporated into the domains of his Highness.

The mutineers were not frightened.  The ban was an anachronism.  If those Spaniards and Italians
had learned nothing by their much campaigning in the land of Calvinism, they had at least unlearned
their faith in bell, book, and candle.  It happened, too, that among their numbers were to
be found pamphleteers as ready and as unscrupulous as the scribes of the archduke.

So there soon came forth and was published to the world, in the name of the Eletto and council
of Hoogstraaten, a formal answer to the ban.

"If scolding and cursing be payment," said the magistrates of the mutiny, "then we might give
a receipt in full for our wages.  The ban is sufficient in this respect; but as these curses
give no food for our bellies nor clothes for our backs, not preventing us, therefore, who have
been fighting so long for the honour and welfare of the archdukes from starving with cold and
hunger, we think a reply necessary in order to make manifest how much reason these archdukes
have for thundering forth all this choler and fury, by which women and children may be frightened,
but at which no soldier will feel alarm.

"When it is stated," continued the mutineers, "that we have deserted our banners just as an
attempt was making by the archduke to relieve Grave, we can only reply that the assertion proves
how impossible it is to practise arithmetic with disturbed brains.  Passion is a bad schoolmistress
for the memory, but, as good friends, we will recal to the recollection of your Highness that
it was not your Highness, but the Admiral of Arragon, that commanded the relieving force before
that city.

"'Tis very true that we summon your Highnesses, and levy upon your provinces, in order to obtain
means of living; for in what other quarter should we make application.  Your Highnesses give
us nothing except promises; but soldiers are not chameleons, to live on such air. According
to every principle of law, creditors have a lien on the property of their debtors.

"As to condemning to death as traitors and scoundrels those who don't desire to be killed,
and who have the means of killing such as attempt to execute the sentence; this is hardly in
accordance with the extraordinary wisdom which has always characterized your Highnesses.

"As, to the confiscation of our goods, both moveable and immoveable, we would simply make this
observation:

"Our moveable goods are our swords alone, and they can only be moved by ourselves.  They are
our immoveable goods as well; for should any one but ourselves undertake to move them, we assure
your Highnesses that they will prove too heavy to be handled.

"As to the official register and deposit ordained of the money, clothing, and other property
belonging to ourselves, our wives and children, the work may be done without clerks of inventory.
Certainly, if the domains of your Highnesses have no other sources of revenue than the proceeds
of this confiscation, wherewith to feed the ostrich-like digestions of those about you, 'tis
to be feared that ere long they will be in the same condition as were ours, when we were obliged
to come together in Hoogstraaten to devise means to keep ourselves, our wives, and children
alive.  And at that time we were an unbreeched people, like the Indians-- saving your Highnesses'
reverence--and the climate here is too cold for such costume. Occasionally the whistle of a huntsman,
the snort of a horse, the crack of a whip, or the whine of a straggling hound could be heard.

When
they had gone a little less than a mile, five more riders with dogs appeared out of the mist, approaching
the Rostovs. In front rode a fresh-looking, handsome old man with a large gray mustache.

"Good morning, Uncle!" said Nicholas, when the old man drew near.

"That's it. Come on!... I was sure of it," began "Uncle." (He was a distant relative of the
Rostovs', a man of small means, and their neighbor.) "I knew you
wouldn't be able to resist it and it's a good thing you're going.

That's it! Come on!" (This was "Uncle's" favorite expression.) "Take the covert at once, for my
Girchik says the Ilagins are at Korniki with their hounds. That's it. Come on!... They'll take
the cubs from under your very nose."

"That's where I'm going. Shall we join up our packs?" asked Nicholas.

The hounds were joined into one pack, and "Uncle" and Nicholas rode
on side by side.

Natasha, muffled up in shawls which did not hide her eager face and shining eyes, galloped up
to them. She was followed by Petya who always kept close to her,
by Michael, a huntsman, and by a groom appointed to look after her.

Petya, who was laughing, whipped and pulled at his horse. Natasha sat easily and confidently
on her black Arabchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand.

"Uncle" looked round disapprovingly at Petya and Natasha. He did not like to combine frivolity with the
serious business of hunting.

"Good morning, Uncle! We are going too!" shouted Petya.

"Good morning, good morning! But don't go overriding the hounds,"
said "Uncle" sternly.

"Nicholas, what a fine dog Trunila is! He knew
me," said Natasha, referring to her favorite hound.

"In the first
place, Trunila is not a 'dog,' but a harrier," thought Nicholas, and
looked sternly at his sister, trying to make her feel the distance
that ought to separate them at that moment. Natasha understood it.

"You
mustn't think we'll be in anyone's way, Uncle," she said. "We'll go
to our places and won't budge."

"A good thing too, little countess,"
said "Uncle," "only mind you don't fall off your horse," he added,
"because--that's it, come on!--you've nothing to hold on to."

Maurice had written to them from his camp before Grave, and at first they were disposed to
treat him with as little courtesy as they had shown the Nuncius; for they put the prince's
letter on a staff, and fired at it as a mark, assuring the trumpeter who brought it that they
would serve him in the same manner should he venture thither again.  Very soon afterwards,
however, the Eletto and council, reproving the folly of their subordinates, opened negotiations
with the stadholder, who, with the consent of the States, gave them preliminary permission
to take refuge under the guns of Bergenop-Zoom, should they by chance be hard pressed.

Thus throughout Europe a singular equilibrium of contending forces seemed established.  Before
Ostend, where the chief struggle between imperialism and republicanism had been proceeding
for more than a year with equal vigour, there seemed no possibility of a result.  The sands
drank up the blood of the combatants on both sides, month after month, in summer; the pestilence
in town and camp mowed down Catholic and Protestant with perfect impartiality during the winter,
while the remorseless ocean swept over all in its wrath, obliterating in an hour the patient
toil of months.

In Spain, in England, and Ireland; in Hungary, Germany, Sweden, and Poland, men wrought industriously
day by day and year by year, to destroy each other, and to efface the products of human industry,
and yet no progress could fairly be registered.  The Turk was in Buda, on the right bank of
the Danube, and the Christian in Pest, on the left, while the crescent; but lately supplanted
by the cross, again waved in triumph over Stuhlweissenberg, capital city of the Magyars.  The
great Marshal Biron, foiled in his stupendous treachery, had laid down his head upon the block;
the catastrophe following hard upon the madcap riot of Lord Essex in the Strand and his tragic
end.  The troublesome and restless favourites of Henry and of Elizabeth had closed their stormy
career, but the designs of the great king and the great queen were growing wider and wilder,
more false and more fantastic than ever, as the evening shadows of both were lengthening.

But it was not in Europe nor in Christendom: alone during that twilight epoch of declining
absolutism, regal and sacerdotal, and the coming glimmer of freedom, religious and commercial,
that the contrast between the old and new civilizations was exhibiting itself.

The same fishermen and fighting men, whom we have but lately seen sailing forth from Zeeland
and Friesland to confront the dangers of either pole, were now contending in the Indian seas
with the Portuguese monopolists of the tropics.

A century long, the generosity of the Roman pontiff in bestowing upon others what was not his
property had guaranteed to the nation of Vasco de Gama one half at least of the valuable possessions
which maritime genius, unflinching valour, and boundless cruelty had won and kept.  But the
spirit of change was abroad in the world.  Potentates and merchants under the equator had been
sedulously taught that there were no other white men on the planet but the Portuguese and their
conquerors the Spaniards, and that the Dutch--of whom they had recently heard, and the portrait
of whose great military chieftain they had seen after the news of the Nieuport battle had made
the circuit of the earth--were a mere mob of pirates and savages inhabiting the obscurest of
dens.  They were soon, however, to be enabled to judge for themselves as to the power and the
merits of the various competitors for their trade.

Early in this year Andreas Hurtado de Mendoza with a stately fleet of galleons and smaller
vessels, more than five-and-twenty in all, was on his way towards the island of Java to inflict
summary vengeance upon those oriental rulers who had dared to trade with men forbidden by his
Catholic Majesty and the Pope.

The city of Bantam was the first spot marked out for destruction, and it so happened that a
Dutch skipper, Wolfert Hermann by name, commanding five trading vessels, in which were three
hundred men, had just arrived in those seas to continue the illicit commerce which had aroused
the ire of the Portuguese.  His whole force both of men and of guns was far inferior to that
of the flag-ship alone of Mendoza.  But he resolved to make manifest to the Indians that the
Batavians were not disposed to relinquish their promising commercial relations with them, nor
to turn their backs upon their newly found friends in the hour of danger.  To the profound
astonishment of the Portuguese admiral the Dutchman with his five little trading ships made
an attack on the pompous armada, intending to avert chastisement from the king of Bantam. 
It was not possible for Wolfert to cope at close quarters with his immensely superior adversary,
but his skill and nautical experience enabled him to play at what was then considered long
bowls with extraordinary effect.  The greater lightness and mobility of his vessels made them
more than a match, in this kind of encounter, for the clumsy, top-heavy, and sluggish marine
castles in which Spain and Portugal then went forth to battle on the ocean.  It seems almost
like the irony of history, and yet it is the literal fact, that the Dutch galleot of that day--hardly
changed in two and a half centuries since--"the bull-browed galleot butting through the stream,"--[Oliver
Wendell Holmes]--was then the model clipper, conspicuous among all ships for its rapid sailing
qualities and ease of handling.  So much has the world moved, on sea and shore, since those
simple but heroic days.  And thus Wolfert's swift-going galleots circled round and round the
awkward, ponderous, and much-puzzled Portuguese fleet, until by well-directed shots and skilful
manoeuvring they had sunk several ships, taken two, run others into the shallows, and, at last,
put the whole to confusion.  After several days of such fighting, Admiral Mendoza fairly turned
his back upon his insignificant opponent, and abandoned his projects upon Java.  Bearing away
for the Island of Amboyna with the remainder of his fleet, he laid waste several of its villages
and odoriferous spice-fields, while Wolfert and his companions entered Bantam in triumph, and
were hailed as deliverers.  And thus on the extreme western verge of this magnificent island
was founded the first trading settlement of the Batavian republic in the archipelago of the
equator--the foundation-stone of a great commercial empire which was to encircle the earth.

Meantime Wolfert Hermann was not the only Hollander cruising in those seas able to convince
the Oriental mind that all Europeans save the Portuguese were not pirates and savages, and
that friendly intercourse with other foreigners might be as profitable as slavery to the Spanish
crown.

Captain Nek made treaties of amity and commerce with the potentates of Ternate, Tydor, and
other Molucca islands.  The King of Candy on the Island of Ceylon, lord of the odoriferous
fields of cassia which perfume those tropical seas, was glad to learn how to exchange the spices
of the equator for the thousand fabrics and products of western civilization which found their
great emporium in Holland. Who is right and who is wrong? No one! But if you are alive--live:
tomorrow you'll die as I might have died an hour ago. And is it worth tormenting oneself, when one
has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity?"

But at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections, she suddenly came into
his mind as she was at the moments when he had most strongly expressed his insincere love for
her, and he felt the blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break
and tear whatever came to his hand. "Why did I tell her that 'Je vous aime'?" he kept repeating
to himself. And when he had said it for the tenth time, Molibre's
words: "Mais que diable alloit-il faire dans cette galere?" occurred
to him, and he began to laugh at himself. But when
was Jacob Heemskerk ever known to shrink from an encounter-- whether from single-handed combat
with a polar bear, or from leading a forlorn hope against a Spanish fort, or from assailing
a Portuguese armada.  The carrack, more than one thousand tons burthen, carried seventeen guns,
and at least eight times as many men as he commanded. Nevertheless, after a combat of but brief
duration Heemskerk was master of the carrack: He spared the lives of his seven hundred prisoners,
and set them on shore before they should have time to discover to what a handful of Dutchmen
they had surrendered.  Then dividing about a million florins' worth of booty among his men,
who doubtless found such cruising among the spice-islands more attractive than wintering at
the North Pole, he sailed in the carrack for Macao, where he found no difficulty in convincing
the authorities of the celestial empire that the friendship of the Dutch republic was worth
cultivating.  There was soon to be work in other regions for the hardy Hollander--such as was
to make the name of Heemskerk a word to conjure with down to the latest posterity.  Meantime
he returned to his own country to take part in the great industrial movements which were to
make this year an epoch in commercial history.

The conquerors of Mendoza and deliverers of Bantam had however not paused in their work.  From
Java they sailed to Banda; and on those volcanic islands of nutmegs and cloves made, in the
name of their commonwealth, a treaty with its republican antipodes.  For there was no king
to be found in that particular archipelago, and the two republics, the Oriental and the Germanic,
dealt with each other with direct and becoming simplicity.  Their convention was in accordance
with the commercial ideas of the day, which assumed monopoly as the true basis of national
prosperity.  It was agreed that none but Dutchmen should ever purchase the nutmegs of Banda,
and that neither nation should harbour refugees from the other.  Other articles, however; showed
how much farther, the practice of political and religious liberty had advanced than had any
theory of commercial freedom.  It was settled that each nation should judge its own citizens
according to its own laws, that neither should interfere by force with the other in regard
to religious matters, but that God should be judge over them all.  Here at least was progress
beyond the system according to which the Holy Inquisition furnished the only enginry of civilization.
The guardianship assumed by Holland over these children of the sun was at least an improvement
on the tyranny which roasted them alive if they rejected religious dogmas which they could
not comprehend, and which proclaimed with fire, sword, and gibbet that the Omnipotent especially
forbade the nutmeg trade to all but the subjects, of the most Catholic king.

In Atsgen or Achim, chief city of Sumatra, a treaty was likewise made with the government of
the place, and it was arranged that the king of Atsgen should send over an embassy to the distant
but friendly republic. Thus he might judge whether the Hollanders were enemies of all the world,
as had been represented to him, or only of Spain; whether their knowledge of the arts and sciences,
and their position among the western nations entitled them to respect, and made their friendship
desirable; or whether they were only worthy of the contempt which their royal and aristocratic
enemies delighted to heap upon their heads.  The envoys sailed from Sumatra on board the same
little fleet which, under the command of Wolfert Hermann, had already done such signal service,
and on their way to Europe they had an opportunity of seeing how these republican sailors could
deal with their enemies on the ocean.

Off St. Helena an immense Portuguese carrack richly laden and powerfully armed, was met, attacked,
and overpowered by the little merchantmen with their usual audacity and skill.  A magnificent
booty was equitably divided among the captors, the vanquished crew were set safely on shore;
and the Hollanders then pursued their home voyage without further adventures.

The ambassadors; with an Arab interpreter, were duly presented to Prince Maurice in the lines
before the city of Grave.  Certainly no more favourable opportunity could have been offered
them for contrasting the reality of military power, science, national vigour; and wealth, which
made the republic eminent among the nations, with the fiction of a horde of insignificant and
bloodthirsty savages which her enemies had made so familiar at the antipodes.  Not only were
the intrenchments bastions, galleries, batteries, the discipline and equipment of the troops,
a miracle in the eyes of these newly arrived Oriental ambassadors, but they had awakened the
astonishment of Europe, already accustomed to such spectacles.  Evidently the amity of the
stadholder and his commonwealth was a jewel of price, and the King of Achim would have been
far more barbarous than he had ever deemed the Dutchmen to be, had he not well heeded the lesson
which he had sent so far to learn.

The chief of the legation, Abdulzamar, died in Zeeland, and was buried with honourable obsequies
at Middleburg, a monument being raised to his memory.  The other envoys returned to Sumatra,
fully determined to maintain close relations with the republic.

There had been other visitors in Maurice's lines before Grave at about the same period.  Among
others, Gaston Spinola, recently created by the archduke Count of Bruay, had obtained permission
to make a visit to a wounded relative, then a captive in the republican camp, and was hospitably
entertained at the stadholder's table.  Maurice, with soldierly bluntness, ridiculed the floating
batteries, the castles on wheels, the sausages, and other newly-invented machines, employed
before Ostend, and characterized them as rather fit to catch birds with than to capture a city,
defended by mighty armies and fleets.

"If the archduke has set his heart upon it, he had far better try to buy Ostend," he observed.

"What is your price?"  asked the Italian; "will you take 200,000 ducats?"

"Certainly not less than a million and a half," was the reply; so highly did Maurice rate the
position and advantages of the city.  He would venture to prophesy, he added, that the siege
of Ostend would last as long as the siege of Troy.

"Ostend is no Troy," said Spinola with a courtly flourish, "although there are certainly not
wanting an Austrian Agamemnon, a Dutch Hector, and an Italian Achilles."  The last allusion
was to the speaker's namesake and kinsman, the Marquis Anibrose Spinola, of whom much was to
be heard in the world from that time forth.

Meantime, although so little progress had been made at Ostend, Maurice had thoroughly done
his work before Grave.  On the 18th September the place surrendered, after sixty days' siege,
upon the terms usually granted by the stadholder. But, above all, the French will be here any day
now, so what are we waiting for? I ask just one thing of you, cousin," she went on, "arrange for
me to be taken to Petersburg. Whatever I may be, I can't live under Bonaparte's rule."

"Oh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from?

On the contrary..."

"I won't submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If you don't want to do this..."

"But
I will, I'll give the order at once."

The princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with. Muttering to herself, she
sat down on a chair.

"But you have been misinformed," said Pierre. "Everything is quiet in the city and there is not the
slightest danger. See! I've just been reading..." He showed her the broadsheet. "Count Rostopchin
writes that he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter Moscow."

"Oh, that count of yours!" said the princess malevolently. "He is a hypocrite, a rascal who has
himself roused the people to riot. Didn't he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, 'whoever
it might be, should be dragged to the lockup by his hair'? (How silly!)
'And honor and glory to whoever captures him,' he says. This is what
his cajolery has brought us to! Barbara Ivanovna told me the mob near
killed her because she said something in French."

"Oh, but it's so...
You take everything so to heart," said Pierre, and began laying out
his cards for patience.

Although that patience did come out, Pierre
did not join the army, but remained in deserted Moscow ever in the
same state of agitation, irresolution, and alarm, yet at the same
time joyfully expecting something terrible.

The Hollanders did not very much favour this species of war-craft, both by reason of the difficulty
of procuring the gang, and because to a true lover of the ocean and of naval warfare the galley
was about as clumsy and amphibious a production as could be hoped of human perverseness. High
where it should be low.  Exposed, flat, and fragile, where elevation and strength were indispensable--encumbered
and top-heavy where it should be level and compact, weak in the waist, broad at stem and stern,
awkward in manoeuvre, helpless in rough weather, sluggish under sail, although possessing the
single advantage of being able to crawl over a smooth sea when better and faster ships were
made stationary by absolute calm, the galley was no match for the Dutch galleot, either at
close quarters or in a breeze.

Nevertheless for a long time there had been a certain awe produced by the possibility of some
prodigious but unknown qualities in these outlandish vessels, and already the Hollanders had
tried their hand at constructing them.  On a late occasion a galley of considerable size, built
at Dort, had rowed past the Spanish forts on the Scheld, gone up to Antwerp, and coolly cut
out from the very wharves of the city a Spanish galley of the first class, besides seven war
vessels of lesser dimensions, at first gaining advantage by surprise, and then breaking down
all opposition in a brilliant little fight.  The noise of the encounter summoned the citizens
and garrison to the walls, only to witness the triumph achieved by Dutch audacity, and to see
the victors dropping rapidly down the river, laden with booty and followed by their prizes.
Nor was the mortification of these unwilling spectators diminished when the clear notes of
a bugle on board the Dutch galley brought to their ears the well-known melody of "Wilhelmus
of Nassau," once so dear to every, patriotic heart in Antwerp, and perhaps causing many a renegade
cheek on this occasion to tingle with shame.

Frederic Spinola, a volunteer belonging to the great and wealthy Genoese family of that name,
had been performing a good deal of privateer work with a small force of galleys which he kept
under his command at Sluys. He had succeeded in inflicting so much damage upon the smaller
merchantmen of the republic, and in maintaining so perpetual a panic in calm weather among
the seafaring multitudes of those regions, that he was disposed to extend the scale of his
operations.  On a visit to Spain he had obtained permission from Government to employ in this
service eight great galleys, recently built on the Guadalquivir for the Royal Navy. He was
to man and equip them at his own expense, and was to be allowed the whole of the booty that
might result from his enterprise.  Early in the autumn he set forth with his eight galleys
on the voyage to Flanders, but, off Cezimbra, on the Portuguese coast, unfortunately fell in
with Sir Robert Mansell, who; with a compact little squadron of English frigates, was lying
in wait for the homeward-bound India fleet on their entrance to Lisbon.  An engagement took
place, in which Spinola lost two of his galleys.  His disaster might have been still greater,
had not an immense Indian carrack, laden with the richest merchandize, just then hove in sight,
to attract his conquerors with a hope of better prize- money than could be expected from the
most complete victory over him and his fleet.

With the remainder of his vessels Spinola crept out of sight while the English were ransacking
the carrack.  On the 3rd of October he had entered the channel with a force which, according
to the ideas of that day, was still formidable.  Each of his galleys was of two hundred and
fifty slave power, and carried, beside the chain-gang, four hundred fighting men.  His flag-ship
was called the St. Lewis; the names of the other vessels being the St. Philip, the Morning
Star, the St. John, the Hyacinth, and the Padilla.  The Trinity and the Opportunity had been
destroyed off Cezimbra.  Now there happened to be cruising just then in the channel, Captain
Peter Mol, master of the Dutch war-ship Tiger, and Captain Lubbertson, commanding the Pelican.
These two espied the Spanish squadron, paddling at about dusk towards the English coast, and
quickly gave notice to Vice-Admiral John Kant, who in the States' ship Half-moon, with three
other war-galleots, was keeping watch in that neighbourhood. It was dead calm as the night
fell, and the galleys of Spinola, which had crept close up to the Dover cliffs, were endeavouring
to row their way across in the darkness towards the Flemish coast, in the hope of putting unobserved
into the Gut of Sluys.  All went well with Spinola till the moon rose; but, with the moon,
sprang up a steady breeze, so that the galleys lost all their advantage.  Nearly off Gravelines
another States' ship, the Mackerel, came in sight, which forthwith attacked the St: Philip,
pouring a broadside into her by which fifty men were killed. Drawing off from this assailant,
the galley found herself close to the Dutch admiral in the Half-moon, who, with all sail set,
bore straight down upon her, struck her amidships with a mighty crash, carrying off her mainmast
and her poop, and then, extricating himself with difficulty from the wreck, sent a tremendous
volley of cannon-shot and lesser missiles straight into the waist where sat the chain-gang.
A howl of pain and terror rang through the air, while oars and benches, arms, legs, and mutilated
bodies, chained inexorably together, floated on the moonlit waves.  An instant later, and another
galleot bore down to complete the work, striking with her iron prow the doomed St. Philip so
straightly and surely that she went down like a stone, carrying with her galley slaves, sailors,
and soldiers, besides all the treasure brought by Spinola for the use of his fleet.

The Morning Star was the next galley attacked, Captain Sael, in a stout galleot, driving at
her under full sail, with the same accuracy and solidity of shock as had been displayed in
the encounter with the St. Philip and with the same result.  The miserable, top-heavy monster
galley was struck between mainmast and stern, with a blow which carried away the assailant's
own bowsprit and fore-bulwarks, but which--completely demolished the stem of the galley, and
crushed out of existence the greater portion of the live machinery sitting chained and rowing
on the benches.  And again, as the first enemy hauled off from its victim, Admiral pant came
up once more in the Half-moon, steered straight at the floundering galley, and sent her with
one crash to the bottom.  It was not very scientific practice perhaps.  It was but simple butting,
plain sailing, good steering, and the firing of cannon at short pistol-shot. But after all,
the work of those unsophisticated Dutch skippers was done very thoroughly, without flinching,
and, as usual, at great odds of men and guns.  Two more of the Spanish galleys were chased
into the shallows near Gravelines, where they went to pieces.  Another was wrecked near Calais.
The galley which bore Frederic Spinola himself and his fortunes succeeded in reaching Dunkirk,
whence he made his way discomfited, to tell the tale of his disaster to the archduke at Brussels.
During the fight the Dutch admiral's boats had been active in picking up such of the drowning
crews, whether galley-slaves or soldiers, as it was possible to save.  But not more than two
hundred were thus rescued, while by far the greater proportion of those on board, probably
three thousand in number, perished, and the whole fleet, by which so much injury was to have
been inflicted on Dutch commerce, was, save one damaged galley, destroyed. Yet scarcely any
lives were lost by the Hollanders, and it is certain that the whole force in their fleet did
not equal the crew of a single one of the enemy's ships.  Neither Spinola nor the archduke
seemed likely to make much out of the contract. "A matchless people!" he repeated with a sigh.

"So
you want to smell gunpowder?" he said to Pierre. "Yes, it's a pleasant smell. I have the honor to
be one of your wife's adorers.

Is she well? My quarters are at your service."

And as often happens with old people, Kutuzov began looking about absent-mindedly as if forgetting
all he wanted to say or do.

Then, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew Kaysarov, his adjutant's brother.

"Those
verses... those verses of Marin's... how do they go, eh? Those he wrote about Gerakov: 'Lectures
for the corps inditing'... Recite them, recite them!" said he, evidently preparing to laugh.

Kaysarov recited.... Kutuzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of the verses.

When Pierre had left Kutuzov, Dolokhov came up to him and took his hand.

"I am very glad to meet you here, Count," he said aloud, regardless of the presence of strangers
and in a particularly resolute and solemn tone. "On the eve of a day when God alone knows who
of us is fated to survive, I am glad of this opportunity to tell
you that I regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us and
should wish you not to have any ill feeling for me.

I beg you to forgive me."

Pierre looked at Dolokhov with a smile, not knowing what to say to him. With tears in his eyes Dolokhov
embraced Pierre and kissed him.

Boris said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to Pierre and proposed that
he should ride with him along the line.

"It will interest you," said he.

"Yes, very much," replied Pierre.

Half an hour later Kutuzov left for Tatarinova, and Bennigsen and
his suite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along the
line.

CHAPTER XXIII

From Gorki, Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which, when they had looked at it
from the hill, the officer had pointed out as being the center of our position and where rows
of fragrant new-mown hay lay by the riverside. They rode across that bridge into the village of
Borodino and thence turned to the left, passing an enormous number of troops and guns, and
came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging. This was the redoubt, as yet unnamed, which
afterwards became known as the Raevski Redoubt, or the Knoll Battery,
but Pierre paid no special attention to it.

He did not know that it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on the plain of
Borodino.

They then crossed the hollow to Semenovsk, where the soldiers were dragging away the last logs from
the huts and barns. Then they rode downhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten
down as if by hail, following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows of the plowed
land, and reached some fleches * which were still being dug.
* A kind of entrenchment.

At the fleches Bennigsen stopped and began
looking at the Shevardino Redoubt opposite, which had been ours the
day before and where several horsemen could be descried. The officers
said that either Napoleon or Murat was there, and they all gazed eagerly
at this little group of horsemen. Pierre also looked at them, trying
to guess which of the scarcely discernible figures was Napoleon. At
last those mounted men rode away from the mound and disappeared.

Bennigsen
spoke to a general who approached him, and began explaining the whole
position of our troops. Pierre listened to him, straining each faculty
to understand the essential points of the impending battle, but was
mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the
task. He could make nothing of it. Bennigsen stopped speaking and,
noticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly said to him:

"I don't
think this interests you?"

"On the contrary it's very interesting!"
replied Pierre not quite truthfully.

From the fleches they rode still
farther to the left, along a road winding through a thick, low-growing
birch wood. In the middle of the wood a brown hare with white feet
sprang out and, scared by the tramp of the many horses, grew so confused
that it leaped along the road in front of them for some time, arousing
general attention and laughter, and only when several voices shouted
at it did it dart to one side and disappear in the thicket. After
going through the wood for about a mile and a half they came out on
a glade where troops of Tuchkov's corps were stationed to defend the
left flank.

Here, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great
deal and with much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders
of great military importance.  Then, until the tide fell again, there was brief repose.

And so the dreary winter faded away at last into chill and blustering spring.  On the 13th
of April a hurricane, such as had not occurred since the siege began; raged across the ocean,
deluging and shattering the devoted town.  The waters rose over dyke and parapet, and the wind
swept from the streets and ramparts every living thing.  Not a soldier or sailor could keep
his feet, the chief tower of the church was blown into the square, chimneys and windows crashed
on all sides, and the elements had their holiday, as if to prove how helpless a thing was man,
however fierce and determined, when the powers of Nature arose in their strength. It was as
if no siege existed, as if no hostile armies had been lying nearly two years long close to
each other, and losing no opportunity to fly at each other's throats.  The strife of wind and
ocean gave a respite to human rage.

It was but a brief respite.  At nightfall there was a lull in the tempest, and the garrison
crept again to the ramparts.  Instantly the departing roar of the winds and waters were succeeded
by fainter but still more threatening sounds, and the sentinels and the drums and trumpets
to rally the garrison, when the attack came.  The sleepless Spaniards were already upon them.
In the Porcupine fort, a blaze of wickerwork and building materials suddenly illuminated the
gathering gloom of night; and the loud cries of the assailants, who had succeeded in kindling
this fire by their missiles, proclaimed the fierceness of the attack.  Governor Dorp was himself
in the fort, straining every nerve to extinguish the flames, and to hold this most important
position.  He was successful.  After a brief but bloody encounter the Spaniards were repulsed
with heavy loss.  All was quiet again, and the garrison in the Porcupine were congratulating
themselves on their victory when suddenly the ubiquitous Philip Fleeting plunged, with a face
of horror, into the governor's quarters, informing him that the attack on the redoubt had been
a feint, and that the Spaniards were at that very moment swarming all over the three external
forts, called the South Square, the West Square, and the Polder.  These points, which have
been already described, were most essential to the protection of the place, as without them
the whole counterscarp was in danger.  It was to save those exposed but vital positions that
Sir Francis Vere had resorted to the slippery device of the last Christmas Eve but one.

Dorp refused to believe the intelligence.  The squares were well guarded, the garrison ever
alert.  Spaniards were not birds of prey to fly up those perpendicular heights, and for beings
without wings the thing was impossible.  He followed Fleming through the darkness, and was
soon convinced that the impossible was true.  The precious squares were in the hands of the
enemy.  Nimble as monkeys, those yellow jerkined Italians, Walloons, and Spaniards--stormhats
on their heads and swords in their teeth--had planted rope-ladders, swung themselves up the
walls by hundreds upon hundreds, while the fight had been going on at the Porcupine, and were
now rushing through the forts grinning defiance, yelling and chattering with fierce triumph,
and beating down all opposition.  It was splendidly done.  The discomfited Dorp met small bodies
of his men, panic-struck, reeling out from their stronghold, wounded, bleeding, shrieking for
help and for orders.  It seemed as if the Spaniards had dropped from the clouds.  The Dutch
commandant did his best to rally the fugitives, and to encourage those who had remained. All
night long the furious battle raged, every inch of ground being contested; for both Catholics
and Hollanders knew full well that this triumph was worth more than all that had been gained
for the archduke in eighteen months of siege.  Pike to pike, breast to breast, they fought
through the dark April night; the last sobs of the hurricane dying unheard, the red lanterns
flitting to and fro, the fireworks hissing in every direction of earth and air, the great wicker
piles, heaped up with pitch and rosin, flaming over a scene more like a dance of goblins than
a commonplace Christian massacre.  At least fifteen hundred were killed-- besiegers and besieged--during
the storming of the forts and the determined but unsuccessful attempt of the Hollanders to
retake them. And when at last the day had dawned, and the Spaniards could see the full extent
of their victory, they set themselves with--unusual alacrity to killing such of the wounded
and prisoners as were in their hands, while, at the same time, they turned the guns of their
newly acquired works upon the main counterscarp of the town.

Yet the besieged--discomfited but undismayed lost not a moment in strengthening their inner
works, and in doing their best, day after day, by sortie, cannonade, and every possible device,
to prevent the foe from obtaining full advantage of his success.  The triumph was merely a
local one, and the patient Hollanders soon proved to the enemy that the town was not gained
by carrying the three squares, but that every inch of the place was to be contested as hotly
as those little redoubts had been. Ostend, after standing nearly two years of siege, was not
to be carried by storm.  A goodly slice of it had been pared off that April night, and was
now in possession of the archduke, but this was all.  Meantime the underground work was resumed
on both sides.

Frederic Spinola, notwithstanding the stunning defeat sustained by him in the preceding October,
had not lost heart while losing all his ships. On the contrary, he had been busy during the
winter in building other galleys.  Accordingly, one fine morning in May, Counsellor Flooswyk,
being on board a war vessel convoying some empty transports from Ostend, observed signs of
mischief brewing as he sailed past the Gut of Sluys; and forthwith gave notice of what he had
seen to Admiral Joost de Moor, commanding the blockading squadron.  The counsellor was right.
Frederic Spinola meant mischief.  It was just before sunrise of a beautiful summer's day. 
The waves were smooth--not a breath of wind stirring--and De Moor, who had four little war-ships
of Holland, and was supported besides by a famous vessel called the Black Galley of Zeeland,
under Captain Jacob Michelzoon, soon observed a movement from Sluys.

Over the flat and glassy surface of the sea, eight galleys of the largest size were seen crawling
slowly, like vast reptiles, towards his .. position.  Four lesser vessels followed in the wake
of the great galleys. The sails of the admiral's little fleet flapped idly against the mast.
He could only placidly await the onset.  The Black Galley, however, moved forward according
to her kind; and was soon vigorously attacked by two galleys of the enemy.  With all the force
that five hundred rowers could impart, these two huge vessels ran straight into the Zeeland
ship, and buried their iron prows in her sides.  Yet the Black Galley was made of harder stuff
than were those which had gone down in the channel the previous autumn under the blows of John
Kant.  Those on board her, at least, were made of tougher material than were galley-slaves
and land- soldiers.  The ramming was certainly not like that of a thousand horse- power of
steam, and there was no very great display of science in the encounter; yet Captain Jacob Michelzoon,
with two enemy's ships thus stuck to his sides, might well have given himself up for lost.
The disproportion of ships and men was monstrous.  Beside the chain-gang, each of Spinola's
ships was manned by two hundred soldiers, while thirty- six musketeers from the Flushing garrison
were the only men-at-arms in De Moor's whole squadron.  But those amphibious Zeelanders and
Hollanders, perfectly at home in the water, expert in handling vessels, and excellent cannoneers,
were more than a match for twenty times their number of landsmen.  It was a very simple-minded,
unsophisticated contest.  The attempt to board the Black Galley was met with determined resistance,
but the Zeeland sailors clambered like cats upon the bowsprits of the Spanish galleys, fighting
with cutlass and handspike, while a broadside or two was delivered with terrible effect into
the benches of the chained and wretched slaves.  Captain Michelzoon was killed, but his successor,
Lieutenant Hart, although severely wounded, swore that he would blow up his ship with his own
hands rather than surrender.  The decks of all the vessels ran with blood, but at last the
Black Galley succeeded in beating off her assailants; the Zeelanders, by main force, breaking
off the enemy's bowsprits, so that the two ships of Spinola were glad to sheer off, leaving
their stings buried in the enemy's body.

Next, four galleys attacked the stout little galleot of Captain Logier, and with a very similar
result.  Their prows stuck fast in the bulwarks of the ship, but the boarders soon found themselves
the boarded, and, after a brief contest, again the iron bowsprits snapped like pipe-stems,
and again the floundering and inexperienced Spaniards shrank away from the terrible encounter
which they had provoked.  Soon afterwards, Joost de Moor was assailed by three galleys.  He
received them, however, with cannonade and musketry so warmly that they willingly obeyed a
summons from Spinola, and united with the flag-ship in one more tremendous onset upon the Black
Galley of Zeeland.  And it might have gone hard with that devoted ship, already crippled in
the previous encounter, had not Captain Logier fortunately drifted with the current near enough
to give her assistance, while the other sailing ships lay becalmed and idle spectators.  At
last Spinola, conspicuous by his armour, and by magnificent recklessness of danger, fell upon
the deck of his galley, torn to pieces with twenty-four wounds from a stone gun of the Black
Galley, while at nearly the same, moment a gentle breeze began in the distance to ruffle the
surface of the waters.  More than a thousand men had fallen in Spinola's fleet, inclusive of
the miserable slaves, who were tossed overboard as often as wounds made them a cumbrous part
of the machinery, and the galleys, damaged, discomfited, laden with corpses and dripping with
blood, rowed off into Sluys as speedily as they could move, without waiting until the coming
wind should bring all the sailing ships into the fight, together with such other vessels under
Haultain as might be cruising in the distance.  They succeeded in getting into the Gut of Sluys,
and so up to their harbour of refuge.  Meantime, baldheaded, weather-beaten Joost de Moor--farther
pursuit being impossible--piped all hands on deck, where officers and men fell on their knees,
shouting in pious triumph the 34th Psalm: "I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall
continually be in my mouth .  .  .  .  .  O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His
name together."  So rang forth the notes of humble thanksgiving across the placid sea.  And
assuredly those hardy mariners, having gained a victory with their little vessels over twelve
ships and three thousand men--a numerical force of at least ten times their number,--such as
few but Dutchmen could have achieved; had a right to give thanks to Him from whom all blessings
flow.

Thus ended the career of Frederic Spinola, a wealthy, gallant, high-born, brilliant youth,
who might have earned distinction, and rendered infinitely better service to the cause of Spain
and the archdukes, had he not persuaded himself that he had a talent for seamanship.  Certainly,
never was a more misplaced ambition, a more unlucky career.  Not even in that age of rash adventure,
when grandees became admirals and field- marshals because they were grandees, had such incapacity
been shown by any restless patrician.  Frederic Spinola, at the age of thirty-two, a landsman
and a volunteer, thinking to measure himself on blue water with such veterans as John Rant,
Joost de Moor, and the other Dutchmen and Zeelanders whom it was his fortune to meet, could
hardly escape the doom which so rapidly befel him. 

Oh, but the cushion for the countess!"

"Wait a moment, I'll fetch it," said Mademoiselle Bourienne, and she left the room.

They both sat silent, with an occasional glance at one another.

"Yes, Princess," said Nicholas at last with a sad smile, "it doesn't seem long ago since we
first met at Bogucharovo, but how much water has flowed since then!
In what distress we all seemed to be then, yet I would give much to
bring back that time... but there's no bringing it back."

Princess
Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones as he
said this. She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of
his words which would explain his feeling for her.

"Yes, yes," said
she, "but you have no reason to regret the past, Count.

The herring-smacks and other coasters, besides the transports passing to and from Ostend, sailed
thenceforth unmolested by any galleys from Sluys. One unfortunate sloop, however, in moving
out from the beleaguered city, ran upon some shoals before getting out of the Gullet and thus
fell a prize to the besiegers.  She was laden with nothing more precious than twelve wounded
soldiers on their way to the hospitals at Flushing. These prisoners were immediately hanged,
at the express command of the archduke, because they had been taken on the sea where, according
to his highness, there were no laws of war.

The stadholder, against his will--for Maurice was never cruel--felt himself obliged to teach
the cardinal better jurisprudence and better humanity for the future.  In order to show him
that there was but one belligerent law on sea and on land, he ordered two hundred Spanish prisoners
within his lines to draw lots from an urn in which twelve of the tickets were inscribed with
the fatal word gibbet.  Eleven of the twelve thus marked by ill luck were at once executed.
The twelfth, a comely youth, was pardoned at the intercession of a young girl.  It is not stated
whether or not she became his wife.  It is also a fact worth mentioning, as illustrating the
recklessness engendered by a soldier's life, that the man who drew the first blank sold it
to one of his comrades and plunged his hand again into the fatal urn.  Whether he succeeded
in drawing the gibbet at his second trial has not been recorded.  When these executions had
taken place in full view of the enemy's camp, Maurice formally announced that for every prisoner
thenceforth put to death by the archduke two captives from his own army should be hanged. 
These stern reprisals, as usual, put an end to the foul system of martial murder.

Throughout the year the war continued to be exclusively the siege of Ostend.  Yet the fierce
operations, recently recorded, having been succeeded by a period of comparative languor, Governor
Dorp at last obtained permission to depart to repair his broken health.  He was succeeded in
command of the forces within the town by Charles Van der Noot, colonel of the Zeeland regiment
which had suffered so much in the first act of the battle of Nieuport.  Previously to this
exchange, however, a day of solemn thanksgiving and prayer was set apart on the anniversary
of the beginning of the siege.  Since the 5th of July, 1601, two years had been spent by the
whole power of the enemy in the attempt to reduce this miserable village, and the whole result
thus far had been the capture of three little external forts.  There seemed cause for thanksgiving.

Philip Fleming, too, obtained a four weeks' holiday--the first in eleven years--and went with
his family outside the pestiferous and beleaguered town.  He was soon to return to his multifarious
duties as auditor, secretary, and chronicler of the city, and unattached aide-de-camp to the
commander-in-chief, whoever that might be; and to perform his duty with the same patient courage
and sagacity that had marked him from the beginning.  "An unlucky cannon-ball of the enemy,"
as he observes, did some damage at this period to his diary, but it happened at a moment when
comparatively little was doing, so that the chasm was of less consequence.

"And so I, Philip Fleming, auditor to the Council of War," he says with homely pathos, "have
been so continually employed as not to have obtained leave in all these years to refresh, for
a few days outside this town, my troubled spirit after such perpetual work, intolerable cares,
and slavery, having had no other pleasure allotted me than with daily sadness, weeping eyes,
and heavy yearnings to tread the ramparts, and, like a poor slave laden with fetters, to look
at so many others sailing out of the harbour in order to feast their souls in other provinces
with green fields and the goodly works of God.  And thus it has been until it has nearly gone
out of my memory how the fruits of the earth, growing trees, and dumb beasts appear to mortal eye."

He then, with whimsical indignation, alludes to a certain author who pleaded in excuse for
the shortcomings of the history of the siege the damage done to his manuscripts by a cannon-ball.
"Where the liar dreamt of or invented his cannon-ball," he says, "I cannot tell, inasmuch as
he never saw the city of Ostend in his life; but the said cannon-ball, to my great sorrrow,
did come one afternoon through my office, shot from the enemy's great battery, which very much
damaged not his memoirs but mine; taking off the legs and arms at the same time of three poor
invalid soldiers seated in the sun before my door and killing them on the spot, and just missing
my wife, then great with child, who stood by me with faithfulness through all the sufferings
of the bloody siege and presented me twice during its continuance, by the help of Almighty
God, with young Amazons or daughters of war."

And so honest Philip Fleming went out for a little time to look at the green trees and the
dumb creatures feeding in the Dutch pastures. Meantime the two armies--outside and within Ostend--went
moiling on in their monotonous work; steadily returning at intervals, as if by instinct, to
repair the ruin which a superior power would often inflict in a half-hour on the results of
laborious weeks. 

Why has he taken on himself such a responsibility?"

Again Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced several times up and down the room in silence, and
then, suddenly and unexpectedly, went up to Balashev and with a slight smile, as confidently, quickly,
and simply as if he were doing something not merely important but
pleasing to Balashev, he raised his hand to the forty-year-old Russian
general's face and, taking him by the ear, pulled it gently, smiling
with his lips only.

To have one's ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor
at the French court.

"Well, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why don't you say anything?" said he, as
if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to be the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself,
Napoleon. "Are the horses ready for the general?" he added, with a slight inclination of his
head in reply to Balashev's bow. "Let him have mine, he has a long way to go!"

The letter taken by Balashev was the last Napoleon sent to Alexander. Every detail of the interview
was communicated to the Russian monarch, and the war began...

CHAPTER VIII

After his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went to Petersburg, on business as
he told his family, but really to meet Anatole Kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter.
On reaching Petersburg he inquired for Kuragin but the latter had
already left the city.

                         Pierre had warned
            his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on his track. Anatole Kuragin
promptly obtained an appointment from the Minister of War and went
to join the army in Moldavia. While in Petersburg Prince Andrew met
Kutuzov, his former commander who was always well disposed toward
him, and Kutuzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army
in Moldavia, to which the old general had been appointed commander
in chief. So Prince Andrew, having received an appointment on the
headquarters staff, left for Turkey.

Prince Andrew did not think
it proper to write and challenge Kuragin.

"His Excellency" meant Maurice of Nassau, with whom formal articles of compact had been arranged.
It had become necessary for the archduke, notwithstanding the steady drain of the siege of
Ostend, to detach a considerable army against this republic and to besiege them in their capital
of Hoogstraaten.  With seven thousand foot and three thousand cavalry Frederic Van den Berg
took the field against them in the latter part of July.  Maurice, with nine thousand five hundred
infantry and three thousand horse, lay near Gertruydenberg.  When united with the rebel "squadron,"
two thousand five hundred strong, he would dispose of a force of fifteen thousand veterans,
and he moved at once to relieve the besieged mutineers.  His cousin Frederic, however, had
no desire to measure himself with the stadholder at such odds, and stole away from him in the
dark without beat of drum.  Maurice entered Hoogstraaten, was received with rapture by the
Spanish and Italian veterans, and excited the astonishment of all by the coolness with which
he entered into the cage of these dangerous serpents--as they called themselves--handling them,
caressing them, and being fondled by them in return.  But the veterans knew a soldier when
they saw one, and their hearts warmed to the prince--heretic though he were--more than they
had ever done to the unfrocked bishop who, after starving them for years, had doomed them to
destruction in this world and the next.

The stadholder was feasted and honoured by the mutineers during his brief visit to Hoogatraaten,
and concluded with them a convention, according to which that town was to be restored to him,
while they were to take temporary possession of the city of Grave.  They were likewise to assist,
with all their strength, in his military operations until they should make peace on their own
terms with the archduke.  For two weeks after such treaty they were not to fight against the
States, and meantime, though fighting on the republican side, they were to act as an independent
corps and in no wise to be merged in the stadholder's forces.  So much and no more had resulted
from the archduke's excommunication of the best part of his army.  He had made a present of
those troops to the enemy.  He had also been employing a considerable portion of his remaining
forces in campaigning against their own comrades.  While at Grave, the mutineers, or the "squadron"
as they were now called, were to be permitted to practise their own religious rites, without
offering however, any interference with the regular Protestant worship of the place.  When
they should give up Grave, Hoogstraaten was to be restored to them if still in possession of
the States and they were to enter into no negotiations with the archduke except with full knowledge
of the stadholder.

There were no further military, operations of moment during the rest of the year.

Much, more important, however, than siege, battle, or mutiny, to human civilization, were the
steady movements of the Dutch skippers and merchants at this period.  The ears of Europe were
stunned with the clatter of destruction going on all over Christendom, and seeming the only
reasonable occupation of Christians; but the little republic; while fighting so heroically
against the concentrated powers of despotism in the West, was most industriously building up
a great empire in the East. In the new era just dawning, production was to become almost as
honourable and potent, a principle as destruction.

The voyages among the spicy regions of the equator--so recently wrested from their Catholic
and Faithful Majesties by Dutch citizens who did not believe in Borgia--and the little treaties
made with petty princes and commonwealths, who for the first time ware learning that there
were other white men in the world beside the Portuguese, had already led to considerable results.
Before the close of, the previous year that great commercial corporation had been founded--an
empire within an empire; a republic beneath a republic--a counting-house company which was
to organize armies, conquer kingdoms, build forts and cities, make war and peace, disseminate
and exchange among the nations of the earth the various products of civilization, more perfectly
than any agency hitherto known, and bring the farthest disjoined branches of the human family
into closer, connection than had ever existed before.  That it was a monopoly, offensive to
true commercial principles, illiberal, unjust, tyrannical; ignorant of the very rudiments of
mercantile philosophy; is plain enough.  For the sages of the world were but as clowns, at
that period, in economic science.

Was not the great financier of the age; Maximilian de Bethune, at that very moment exhausting
his intellect in devices for the prevention of all international commerce even in Europe? 
"The kingdom of France," he groaned, "is stuffed full of the manufactures of our neighbours,
and it is incredible what a curse to us are these wares.  The import of all foreign goods has
now been forbidden under very great penalties."  As a necessary corollary to this madhouse
legislation an edict was issued, prohibiting the export of gold and silver from France, on
pain, not only of confiscation of those precious metals, but of the whole fortune of such as
engaged in or winked at the traffic.  The king took a public oath never to exempt the culprits
from the punishment thus imposed, and, as the thrifty Sully had obtained from the great king
a private grant of all those confiscations, and as he judiciously promised twenty-five per
cent. thereof to the informer, no doubt he filled his own purse while impoverishing the exchequer.

The United States, not enjoying the blessings, of a paternal government, against which they
had been fighting almost half a century, could not be expected to rival the stupendous folly
of such political economy, although certainly not emancipated from all the delusions of the age. 

"Sir," he said, "permit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not be here."

The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre. But when they had convinced
themselves that this man in the white hat was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the
slope of the trench with a shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up and down
the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard, their feeling of hostile distrust
gradually began to change into a kindly and bantering sympathy, such
as soldiers feel for their dogs, cocks, goats, and in general for
the animals that live with the regiment.

The men soon accepted Pierre into their family, adopted him, gave him a nickname ("our gentleman"),
and made kindly fun of him among themselves.  Merchants arriving at the
different Indian ports would often find that their own countrymen had been too quick for them,
and that other fleets had got the wind out of their sails, that the eastern markets had been
stripped, and that prices had gone up to a ruinous height, while on the other hand, in the
Dutch cities, nutmegs and cinnamon, brocades and indigo, were as plentiful as red herrings.
It was hardly to be expected at that day to find this very triumph of successful traffic considered
otherwise than as a grave misfortune, demanding interference on the part of the only free Government
then existing in the world.  That already free competition and individual enterprise, had made
such progress in enriching the Hollanders and the Javanese respectively with a superfluity
of useful or agreeable things, brought from the farthest ends of the earth, seemed to the eyes
of that day a condition of things likely to end in a general catastrophe.  With a simplicity,
amazing only to those who are inclined to be vain of a superior wisdom-- not their own but
that of their wisest contemporaries--one of the chief reasons for establishing the East India
Company was stated to be the necessity of providing against low prices of Oriental productions
in Europe.

But national instinct is often wiser than what is supposed to be high national statesmanship,
and there can be no doubt that the true foundation of the East India Company was the simple
recognition of an iron necessity.  Every merchant in Holland knew full well that the Portuguese
and Spaniards could never be driven out of their commercial strongholds under the equator,
except by a concentration of the private strength and wealth, of the mercantile community.
The Government had enough on its hands in disputing, inch by inch, at so prodigious an expenditure
of blood and treasure, the meagre territory with which nature had endowed the little commonwealth.
Private organisation, self-help; union of individual purses and individual brains, were to
conquer an empire at the antipodes if it were to be won at all.  By so doing, the wealth of
the nation and its power to maintain the great conflict with the spirit of the past might be
indefinitely increased, and the resources of Spanish despotism proportionally diminished. 
It was not to be expected of Jacob Heemskerk, Wolfert Hermann, or Joris van Spilberg, indomitable
skippers though they were, that each, acting on his own responsibility or on that of his supercargo,
would succeed every day in conquering a whole Spanish fleet and dividing a million or two of
prize- money among a few dozen sailors.  Better things even than this might be done by wholesome
and practical concentration on a more extended scale.

So the States-General granted a patent or charter to one great company with what, for the time,
was an enormous paid-up capital, in order that the India trade might be made secure and the
Spaniards steadily confronted in what they had considered their most impregnable possessions. Sonya
burst into sobs and ran from the room.

Natasha went to the table and without a moment's reflection wrote
that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all
the morning.

In this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings
were at an end; that availing herself of the magnanimity of Prince
Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her freedom, she begged
Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her if she had been
to blame toward her, but that she could not be his wife.

  The chamber of Amsterdam
was to have one half of the whole interest, the chamber of Zeeland one fourth; the chambers
of the Meuse, namely, Delft, Rotterdam, and the north quarter; that is to say, Hoorn and Enkhuizen,
each a sixteenth.  All the chambers were to be governed by the directors then serving, who
however were to be allowed to die out, down to the number of twenty for Amsterdam, twelve for
Zeeland, and seven for each of the other chambers.  To fill a vacancy occurring among the directors,
the remaining members of the board were to nominate three candidates, from whom the estates
of the province should choose one.  Each director was obliged, to have an interest in the company
amounting to at least six thousand florins, except the directors for Hoorn and Enkhuizen, of
whom only three thousand should be required. The general assembly of these chambers should
consist of seventeen directors, eight for Amsterdam, four for Zeeland, two for the Meuse, and
two for the north quarter; the seventeenth being added by turns from the chambers of Zeeland,
the Meuse, and the north quarter.  This assembly was to be held six years at Amsterdam, and
then two years in Zeeland.  The ships were always to return to the port from which they had
sailed.  All the inhabitants of the provinces had the right, within a certain time, to take
shares in the company.  Any province or city subscribing for forty thousand florins or upwards
might appoint an agent to look after its affairs. 

"Who can tell, your honor?" replied the hussar reluctantly.

"From the direction, it must be the enemy," repeated Rostov.
"It may be he or it may be nothing," muttered the hussar. "It's dark...
Steady!" he cried to his fidgeting horse.  No ships, artillery, or other munitions of war
belonging to the Company were to be used in service of the country without permission of the
Company.  The admiralty was to have a certain proportion of the prizes conquered from the enemy.

The directors should not be liable in property or person for the debts of the Company.  The
generals of fleets returning home were to make reports on the state of India to the States.

Notification; of the union of all India companies with this great corporation was duly sent
to the fleets cruising in those regions, where it arrived in the course of the year 1603.

Meantime the first fleet of the Company, consisting of fourteen vessels under command of Admiral
Wybrand van Warwyk, sailed before the end of 1602, and was followed towards the close of 1603
by thirteen other ships, under Stephen van der Hagen?

The equipment of these two fleets cost two million two hundred thousand florins.
