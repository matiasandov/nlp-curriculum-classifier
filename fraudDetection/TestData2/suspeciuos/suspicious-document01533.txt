CLARA HOPGOOD

CHAPTER I

About ten miles north-east of Eastthorpe lies the town of Fenmarket, very like Eastthorpe generally;
and as we are already familiar with Eastthorpe, a particular description of Fenmarket is unnecessary.
There is, however, one marked difference between them.  Eastthorpe, it will be remembered,
is on the border between the low uplands and the Fens, and has one side open to soft, swelling
hills.  Fenmarket is entirely in the Fens, and all the roads that lead out of it are alike
level, monotonous, straight, and flanked by deep and stagnant ditches.  The river, also, here
is broader and slower; more reluctant than it is even at Eastthorpe to hasten its journey to
the inevitable sea.  During the greater part of the year the visitor to Fenmarket would perhaps
find it dull and depressing, and at times, under a grey, wintry sky, almost unendurable; but
nevertheless, for days and weeks it has a charm possessed by few other landscapes in England,
provided only that behind the eye which looks there is something to which a landscape of that
peculiar character answers. Thus as they commenced by their own authority, so they destroyed
all by their own proper hands.

It may be that Almighty God permits that one shall be the executioner of the other for his evil
deeds, that both may give place to his most holy gospel which, by
the hands of the Spaniards, and by order of the most happy, catholic,
and unconquered Emperor and King of Spain, Charles V of glorious memory,
father of your Majesty, was sent to these blind and barbarous gentiles.

  Clara, the
elder, was about five-and-twenty, fair, with rather light hair worn flat at the side of her
face, after the fashion of that time.  Her features were tolerably regular.  It is true they
were somewhat marred by an uneven nasal outline, but this was redeemed by the curved lips of
a mouth which was small and rather compressed, and by a definite, symmetrical and graceful
figure.  Her eyes were grey, with a curious peculiarity in them.  Ordinarily they were steady,
strong eyes, excellent and renowned optical instruments.  Over and over again she had detected,
along the stretch of the Eastthorpe road, approaching visitors, and had named them when her
companions could see nothing but specks. Occasionally, however, these steady, strong, grey
eyes utterly changed.  They were the same eyes, the same colour, but they ceased to be mere
optical instruments and became instruments of expression, transmissive of radiance to such
a degree that the light which was reflected from them seemed insufficient to account for it.
It was also curious that this change, though it must have been accompanied by some emotion,
was just as often not attended by any other sign of it.  Clara was, in fact, little given to
any display of feeling.

Madge, four years younger than her sister, was of a different type altogether, and one more
easily comprehended.  She had very heavy dark hair, and she had blue eyes, a combination which
fascinated Fenmarket.  Fenmarket admired Madge more than it was admired by her in return, and
she kept herself very much to herself, notwithstanding what it considered to be its temptations.
If she went shopping she nearly always went with her sister; she stood aloof from all the small
gaieties of the town; walked swiftly through its streets, and repelled, frigidly and decisively,
all offers, and they were not a few, which had been made to her by the sons of the Fenmarket
tradesfolk.  Fenmarket pronounced her 'stuck-up,' and having thus labelled her, considered
it had exhausted her.  The very important question, Whether there was anything which naturally
stuck up? Fenmarket never asked.  It was a great relief to that provincial little town in 1844,
in this and in other cases, to find a word which released it from further mental effort and
put out of sight any troublesome, straggling, indefinable qualities which it would otherwise
have been forced to examine and name.  Madge was certainly stuck-up, but the projection above
those around her was not artificial.  Both she and her sister found the ways of Fenmarket were
not to their taste.  The reason lay partly in their nature and partly in their history.

Mrs Hopgood was the widow of the late manager in the Fenmarket branch of the bank of Rumbold,
Martin & Rumbold, and when her husband died she had of course to leave the Bank Buildings.
As her income was somewhat straitened, she was obliged to take a small house, and she was now
living next door to the 'Crown and Sceptre,' the principal inn in the town.  There was then
no fringe of villas to Fenmarket for retired quality; the private houses and shops were all
mixed together, and Mrs Hopgood's cottage was squeezed in between the ironmonger's and the
inn.  It was very much lower than either of its big neighbours, but it had a brass knocker
and a bell, and distinctly asserted and maintained a kind of aristocratic superiority.

Mr Hopgood was not a Fenmarket man.  He came straight from London to be manager.  He was in
the bank of the London agents of Rumbold, Martin & Rumbold, and had been strongly recommended
by the city firm as just the person to take charge of a branch which needed thorough reorganisation.
He succeeded, and nobody in Fenmarket was more respected.  He lived, however, a life apart
from his neighbours, excepting so far as business was concerned.  He went to church once on
Sunday because the bank expected him to go, but only once, and had nothing to do with any of
its dependent institutions.  He was a great botanist, very fond of walking, and in the evening,
when Fenmarket generally gathered itself into groups for gossip, either in the street or in
back parlours, or in the 'Crown and Sceptre,' Mr Hopgood, tall, lean and stately, might be
seen wandering along the solitary roads searching for flowers, which, in that part of the world,
were rather scarce.  He was also a great reader of the best books, English, German and French,
and held high doctrine, very high for those days, on the training of girls, maintaining that
they need, even more than boys, exact discipline and knowledge.  Boys, he thought, find health
in an occupation; but an uncultivated, unmarried girl dwells with her own untutored thoughts,
which often breed disease.  His two daughters, therefore, received an education much above
that which was usual amongst people in their position, and each of them--an unheard of wonder
in Fenmarket--had spent some time in a school in Weimar.  Mr Hopgood was also peculiar in his
way of dealing with his children.  He talked to them and made them talk to him, and whatever
they read was translated into speech; thought, in his house, was vocal.

Mrs Hopgood, too, had been the intimate friend of her husband, and was the intimate friend
of her daughters.  She was now nearly sixty, but still erect and graceful, and everybody could
see that the picture of a beautiful girl of one-and-twenty, which hung opposite the fireplace,
had once been her portrait.  She had been brought up, as thoroughly as a woman could be brought
up, in those days, to be a governess.  The war prevented her education abroad, but her father,
who was a clergyman, not too rich, engaged a French emigrant lady to live in his house to teach
her French and other accomplishments.  She consequently spoke French perfectly, and she could
also read and speak Spanish fairly well, for the French lady had spent some years in Spain.
Mr Hopgood had never been particularly in earnest about religion, but his wife was a believer,
neither High Church nor Low Church, but inclined towards a kind of quietism not uncommon in
the Church of England, even during its bad time, a reaction against the formalism which generally
prevailed.  When she married, Mrs Hopgood did not altogether follow her husband.  She never
separated herself from her faith, and never would have confessed that she had separated herself
from her church.  But although she knew that his creed externally was not hers, her own was
not sharply cut, and she persuaded herself that, in substance, his and her belief were identical.
As she grew older her relationship to the Unseen became more and more intimate, but she was
less and less inclined to criticise her husband's freedom, or to impose on the children a rule
which they would certainly have observed, but only for her sake. Every now and then she felt
a little lonely; when, for example, she read one or two books which were particularly her own;
when she thought of her dead father and mother, and when she prayed her solitary prayer.  Mr
Hopgood took great pains never to disturb that sacred moment.  Indeed, he never for an instant
permitted a finger to be laid upon what she considered precious.  He loved her because she
had the strength to be what she was when he first knew her and she had so fascinated him. 
He would have been disappointed if the mistress of his youth had become some other person,
although the change, in a sense, might have been development and progress.  He did really love
her piety, too, for its own sake.  It mixed something with her behaviour to him and to the
children which charmed him, and he did not know from what other existing source anything comparable
to it could be supplied.  Mrs Hopgood seldom went to church.  The church, to be sure, was horribly
dead, but she did not give that as a reason.  She had, she said, an infirmity, a strange restlessness
which prevented her from sitting still for an hour.  She often pleaded this excuse, and her
husband and daughters never, by word or smile, gave her the least reason to suppose that they
did not believe her.

CHAPTER II

Both Clara and Madge went first to an English day-school, and Clara went straight from this
school to Germany, but Madge's course was a little different.  She was not very well, and it
was decided that she should have at least a twelvemonth in a boarding-school at Brighton before
going abroad.  It had been very highly recommended, but the head-mistress was Low Church and
aggressive.  Mr Hopgood, far away from the High and Low Church controversy, came to the conclusion
that, in Madge's case, the theology would have no effect on her.  It was quite impossible,
moreover, to find a school which would be just what he could wish it to be.  Madge, accordingly,
was sent to Brighton, and was introduced into a new world.  She was just beginning to ask herself
WHY certain things were right and other things were wrong, and the Brighton answer was that
the former were directed by revelation and the latter forbidden, and that the 'body' was an
affliction to the soul, a means of 'probation,' our principal duty being to 'war' against it.

Madge's bedroom companion was a Miss Selina Fish, daughter of Barnabas Fish, Esquire, of Clapham,
and merchant of the City of London.  Miss Fish was not traitorous at heart, but when she found
out that Madge had not been christened, she was so overcome that she was obliged to tell her
mother.  Miss Fish was really unhappy, and one cold night, when Madge crept into her neighbour's
bed, contrary to law, but in accordance with custom when the weather was very bitter, poor
Miss Fish shrank from her, half-believing that something dreadful might happen if she should
by any chance touch unbaptised, naked flesh.  Mrs Fish told her daughter that perhaps Miss
Hopgood might be a Dissenter, and that although Dissenters were to be pitied, and even to be
condemned, many of them were undoubtedly among the redeemed, as for example, that man of God,
Dr Doddridge, whose Family Expositor was read systematically at home, as Selina knew.  Then
there were Matthew Henry, whose commentary her father preferred to any other, and the venerable
saint, the Reverend William Jay of Bath, whom she was proud to call her friend.  Miss Fish,
therefore, made further inquiries gently and delicately, but she found to her horror that Madge
had neither been sprinkled nor immersed!  Perhaps she was a Jewess or a heathen!  This was
a happy thought, for then she might be converted.  Selina knew what interest her mother took
in missions to heathens and Jews; and if Madge, by the humble instrumentality of a child, could
be brought to the foot of the Cross, what would her mother and father say?  What would they
not say?  Fancy taking Madge to Clapham in a nice white dress--it should be white, thought
Selina- -and presenting her as a saved lamb!

The very next night she began, -

'I suppose your father is a foreigner?'

'No, he is an Englishman.'

'But if he is an Englishman you must have been baptised, or sprinkled, or immersed, and your
father and mother must belong to church or chapel.  I know there are thousands of wicked people
who belong to neither, but they are drunkards and liars and robbers, and even they have their
children christened.'

'Well, he is an Englishman,' said Madge, smiling.

'Perhaps,' said Selina, timidly, 'he may be--he may be--Jewish. Mamma and papa pray for the
Jews every morning.  They are not like other unbelievers.'

'No, he is certainly not a Jew.'

'What is he, then?'

'He is my papa and a very honest, good man.'

'Oh, my dear Madge! honesty is a broken reed.  I have heard mamma say that she is more hopeful
of thieves than honest people who think they are saved by works, for the thief who was crucified
went to heaven, and if he had been only an honest man he never would have found the Saviour
and would have gone to hell.  Your father must be something.'

'I can only tell you again that he is honest and good.'

Selina was confounded.  She had heard of those people who were NOTHING, and had always considered
them as so dreadful that she could not bear to think of them.  The efforts of her father and
mother did not extend to them; they were beyond the reach of the preacher--mere vessels of
wrath.  If Madge had confessed herself Roman Catholic, or idolator, Selina knew how to begin.
She would have pointed out to the Catholic how unscriptural it was to suppose that anybody
could forgive sins excepting God, and she would at once have been able to bring the idolator
to his knees by exposing the absurdity of worshipping bits of wood and stone; but with a person
who was nothing she could not tell what to do.  She was puzzled to understand what right Madge
had to her name.  Who had any authority to say she was to be called Madge Hopgood?  She determined
at last to pray to God and again ask her mother's help.

She did pray earnestly that very night, and had not finished until long after Madge had said
her Lord's Prayer.  This was always said night and morning, both by Madge and Clara.  They
had been taught it by their mother.  It was, by the way, one of poor Selina's troubles that
Madge said nothing but the Lord's Prayer when she lay down and when she rose; of course, the
Lord's Prayer was the best--how could it be otherwise, seeing that our Lord used it?--but those
who supplemented it with no petitions of their own were set down as formalists, and it was
always suspected that they had not received the true enlightenment from above.  Selina cried
to God till the counterpane was wet with her tears, but it was the answer from her mother which
came first, telling her that however praiseworthy her intentions might be, argument with such
a DANGEROUS infidel as Madge would be most perilous, and she was to desist from it at once.
Mrs Fish had by that post written to Miss Pratt, the schoolmistress, and Selina no doubt would
not be exposed to further temptation.  Mrs Fish's letter to Miss Pratt was very strong, and
did not mince matters.  She informed Miss Pratt that a wolf was in her fold, and that if the
creature were not promptly expelled, Selina must be removed into safety.  Miss Pratt was astonished,
and instantly, as her custom was, sought the advice of her sister, Miss Hannah Pratt, who had
charge of the wardrobes and household matters generally. Miss Hannah Pratt was never in the
best of tempers, and just now was a little worse than usual.  It was one of the rules of the
school that no tradesmen's daughters should be admitted, but it was very difficult to draw
the line, and when drawn, the Misses Pratt were obliged to admit it was rather ridiculous.
There was much debate over an application by an auctioneer.  He was clearly not a tradesman,
but he sold chairs, tables and pigs, and, as Miss Hannah said, used vulgar language in recommending
them.  However, his wife had money; they lived in a pleasant house in Lewes, and the line went
outside him.  But when a druggist, with a shop in Bond Street, proposed his daughter, Miss
Hannah took a firm stand.  What is the use of a principle, she inquired severely, if we do
not adhere to it? On the other hand, the druggist's daughter was the eldest of six, who might
all come when they were old enough to leave home, and Miss Pratt thought there was a real difference
between a druggist and, say, a bootmaker.

'Bootmaker!' said Miss Hannah with great scorn.  'I am surprised that you venture to hint the
remotest possibility of such a contingency.'

At last it was settled that the line should also be drawn outside the druggist.  Miss Hannah,
however, had her revenge.  A tanner in Bermondsey with a house in Bedford Square, had sent
two of his children to Miss Pratt's seminary.  Their mother found out that they had struck
up a friendship with a young person whose father compounded prescriptions for her, and when
she next visited Brighton she called on Miss Pratt, reminded her that it was understood that
her pupils would 'all be taken from a superior class in society,' and gently hinted that she
could not allow Bedford Square to be contaminated by Bond Street.  Miss Pratt was most apologetic,
enlarged upon the druggist's respectability, and more particularly upon his well-known piety
and upon his generous contributions to the cause of religion.  This, indeed, was what decided
her to make an exception in his favour, and the piety also of his daughter was 'most exemplary.'
However, the tanner's lady, although a shining light in the church herself, was not satisfied
that a retail saint could produce a proper companion for her own offspring, and went away leaving
Miss Pratt very uncomfortable.

'I warned you,' said Miss Hannah; 'I told you what would happen, and as to Mr Hopgood, I suspected
him from the first.  Besides, he is only a banker's clerk.'

'Well, what is to be done?'

'Put your foot down at once.'  Miss Hannah suited the action to the word, and put down, with
emphasis, on the hearthrug a very large, plate-shaped foot cased in a black felt shoe.

'But I cannot dismiss them.  Don't you think it will be better, first of all, to talk to Miss
Hopgood?  Perhaps we could do her some good.'

'Good!  Now, do you think we can do any good to an atheist?  Besides, we have to consider our
reputation.  Whatever good we might do, it would be believed that the infection remained.'

'We have no excuse for dismissing the other.'

'Excuse! none is needed, nor would any be justifiable.  Excuses are immoral.  Say at once--of
course politely and with regret--that the school is established on a certain basis.  It will
be an advantage to us if it is known why these girls do not remain.  I will dictate the letter,
if you like.'

Miss Hannah Pratt had not received the education which had been given to her younger sister,
and therefore, was nominally subordinate, but really she was chief.  She considered it especially
her duty not only to look after the children's clothes, the servants and the accounts, but
to maintain TONE everywhere in the establishment, and to stiffen her sister when necessary,
and preserve in proper sharpness her orthodoxy, both in theology and morals.

Accordingly, both the girls left, and both knew the reason for leaving.  The druggist's faith
was sorely tried.  If Miss Pratt's had been a worldly seminary he would have thought nothing
of such behaviour, but he did not expect it from one of the faithful.  The next Sunday morning
after he received the news, he stayed at home out of his turn to make up any medicines which
might be urgently required, and sent his assistant to church.

As to Madge, she enjoyed her expulsion as a great joke, and her Brighton experiences were the
cause of much laughter.  She had learned a good deal while she was away from home, not precisely
what it was intended she should learn, and she came back with a strong, insurgent tendency,
which was even more noticeable when she returned from Germany.  Neither of the sisters lived
at the school in Weimar, but at the house of a lady who had been recommended to Mrs Hopgood,
and by this lady they were introduced to the great German classics. She herself was an enthusiast
for Goethe, whom she well remembered in his old age, and Clara and Madge, each of them in turn,
learned to know the poet as they would never have known him in England.  Even the town taught
them much about him, for in many ways it was expressive of him and seemed as if it had shaped
itself for him.  It was a delightful time for them.  They enjoyed the society and constant
mental stimulus; they loved the beautiful park; not a separate enclosure walled round like
an English park, but suffering the streets to end in it, and in summer time there were excursions
into the Thuringer Wald, generally to some point memorable in history, or for some literary
association.  The drawback was the contrast, when they went home, with Fenmarket, with its
dulness and its complete isolation from the intellectual world.  At Weimar, in the evening,
they could see Egmont or hear Fidelio, or talk with friends about the last utterance upon the
Leben Jesu; but the Fenmarket Egmont was a travelling wax-work show, its Fidelio psalm tunes,
or at best some of Bishop's glees, performed by a few of the tradesfolk, who had never had
an hour's instruction in music; and for theological criticism there were the parish church
and Ram Lane Chapel.  They did their best; they read their old favourites and subscribed for
a German as well as an English literary weekly newspaper, but at times they were almost beaten.
Madge more than Clara was liable to depression.

No Fenmarket maiden, other than the Hopgoods, was supposed to have any connection whatever,
or to have any capacity for any connection with anything outside the world in which 'young
ladies' dwelt, and if a Fenmarket girl read a book, a rare occurrence, for there were no circulating
libraries there in those days, she never permitted herself to say anything more than that it
was 'nice,' or it was 'not nice,' or she 'liked it' or did 'not like it;' and if she had ventured
to say more, Fenmarket would have thought her odd, not to say a little improper.  The Hopgood
young women were almost entirely isolated, for the tradesfolk felt themselves uncomfortable
and inferior in every way in their presence, and they were ineligible for rectory and brewery
society, not only because their father was merely a manager, but because of their strange ways.
Mrs Tubbs, the brewer's wife, thought they were due to Germany.  From what she knew of Germany
she considered it most injudicious, and even morally wrong, to send girls there.  She once
made the acquaintance of a German lady at an hotel at Tunbridge Wells, and was quite shocked.
She could see quite plainly that the standard of female delicacy must be much lower in that
country than in England.  Mr Tubbs was sure Mrs Hopgood must have been French, and said to
his daughters, mysteriously, 'you never can tell who Frenchwomen are.'

'But, papa,' said Miss Tubbs, 'you know Mrs Hopgood's maiden name; we found that out.  It was
Molyneux.'

'Of course, my dear, of course; but if she was a Frenchwoman resident in England she would
prefer to assume an English name, that is to say if she wished to be married.'

Occasionally the Miss Hopgoods were encountered, and they confounded Fenmarket sorely.  On
one memorable occasion there was a party at the Rectory:  it was the annual party into which
were swept all the unclassifiable odds-and-ends which could not be put into the two gatherings
which included the aristocracy and the democracy of the place.  Miss Clara Hopgood amazed everybody
by 'beginning talk,' by asking Mrs Greatorex, her hostess, who had been far away to Sidmouth
for a holiday, whether she had been to the place where Coleridge was born, and when the parson's
wife said she had not, and that she could not be expected to make a pilgrimage to the birthplace
of an infidel, Miss Hopgood expressed her surprise, and declared she would walk twenty miles
any day to see Ottery St Mary.  Still worse, when somebody observed that an Anti-Corn-Law lecturer
was coming to Fenmarket, and the parson's daughter cried 'How horrid!'  Miss Hopgood talked
again, and actually told the parson that, so far as she had read upon the subject--fancy her
reading about the Corn- Laws!--the argument was all one way, and that after Colonel Thompson
nothing new could really be urged.

'What is so--' she was about to say 'objectionable,' but she recollected her official position
and that she was bound to be politic--'so odd and unusual,' observed Mrs Greatorex to Mrs Tubbs
afterwards, 'is not that Miss Hopgood should have radical views.  Mrs Barker, I know, is a
radical like her husband, but then she never puts herself forward, nor makes speeches.  I never
saw anything quite like it, except once in London at a dinner-party.  Lady Montgomery then
went on in much the same way, but she was a baronet's wife; the baronet was in Parliament;
she received a good deal and was obliged to entertain her guests.'

Poor Clara! she was really very unobtrusive and very modest, but there had been constant sympathy
between her and her father, not the dumb sympathy as between man and dog, but that which can
manifest itself in human fashion.

CHAPTER III

Clara and her father were both chess-players, and at the time at which our history begins,
Clara had been teaching Madge the game for about six months.

'Check!' said Clara.

'Check! after about a dozen moves.  It is of no use to go on; you always beat me.  I should
not mind that if I were any better now than when I started.  It is not in me.'

'The reason is that you do not look two moves ahead.  You never say to yourself, "Suppose I
move there, what is she likely to do, and what can I do afterwards?"'

'That is just what is impossible to me.  I cannot hold myself down; the moment I go beyond
the next move my thoughts fly away, and I am in a muddle, and my head turns round.  I was not
born for it.  I can do what is under my nose well enough, but nothing more.'

'The planning and the forecasting are the soul of the game.  I should like to be a general,
and play against armies and calculate the consequences of manoeuvres.'

'It would kill me.  I should prefer the fighting.  Besides, calculation is useless, for when
I think that you will be sure to move such and such a piece, you generally do not.'

'Then what makes the difference between the good and the bad player?'

'It is a gift, an instinct, I suppose.'

'Which is as much as to say that you give it up.  You are very fond of that word instinct;
I wish you would not use it.'

'I have heard you use it, and say you instinctively like this person or that.'

'Certainly; I do not deny that sometimes I am drawn to a person or repelled from him before
I can say why; but I always force myself to discover afterwards the cause of my attraction
or repulsion, and I believe it is a duty to do so.  If we neglect it we are little better than
the brutes, and may grossly deceive ourselves.'

At this moment the sound of wheels was heard, and Madge jumped up, nearly over-setting the
board, and rushed into the front room.  It was the four-horse coach from London, which, once
a day, passed through Fenmarket on its road to Lincoln.  It was not the direct route from London
to Lincoln, but the Defiance went this way to accommodate Fenmarket and other small towns.
It slackened speed in order to change horses at the 'Crown and Sceptre,' and as Madge stood
at the window, a gentleman on the box-seat looked at her intently as he passed.  In another
minute he had descended, and was welcomed by the landlord, who stood on the pavement.  Clara
meanwhile had taken up a book, but before she had read a page, her sister skipped into the
parlour again, humming a tune.

'Let me see--check, you said, but it is not mate.'

She put her elbows on the table, rested her head between her hands, and appeared to contemplate
the game profoundly.

'Now, then, what do you say to that?'

It was really a very lucky move, and Clara, whose thoughts perhaps were elsewhere, was presently
most unaccountably defeated.  Madge was triumphant.

'Where are all your deep-laid schemes?  Baffled by a poor creature who can hardly put two and
two together.'

'Perhaps your schemes were better than mine.'

'You know they were not.  I saw the queen ought to take that bishop, and never bothered myself
as to what would follow.  Have you not lost your faith in schemes?'

'You are very much mistaken if you suppose that, because of one failure, or of twenty failures,
I would give up a principle.'

'Clara, you are a strange creature.  Don't let us talk any more about chess.'

Madge swept all the pieces with her hand into the box, shut it, closed the board, and put her
feet on the fender.

'You never believe in impulses or in doing a thing just because here and now it appears to
be the proper thing to do.  Suppose anybody were to make love to you--oh! how I wish somebody
would, you dear girl, for nobody deserves it more--'  Madge put her head caressingly on Clara's
shoulder and then raised it again.  'Suppose, I say, anybody were to make love to you, would
you hold off for six months and consider, and consider, and ask yourself whether he had such
and such virtues, and whether he could make you happy?  Would not that stifle love altogether?
Would you not rather obey your first impression and, if you felt you loved him, would you not
say "Yes"?'

'Time is not everything.  A man who is prompt and is therefore thought to be hasty by sluggish
creatures who are never half awake, may in five minutes spend more time in consideration than
his critics will spend in as many weeks.  I have never had the chance, and am not likely to
have it.  I can only say that if it were to come to me, I should try to use the whole strength
of my soul.  Precisely because the question would be so important, would it be necessary to
employ every faculty I have in order to decide it.  I do not believe in oracles which are supposed
to prove their divinity by giving no reasons for their commands.'

'Ah, well, I believe in Shakespeare.  His lovers fall in love at first sight.'

'No doubt they do, but to justify yourself you have to suppose that you are a Juliet and your
friend a Romeo.  They may, for aught I know, be examples in my favour.  However, I have to
lay down a rule for my own poor, limited self, and, to speak the truth, I am afraid that great
men often do harm by imposing on us that which is serviceable to themselves only; or, to put
it perhaps more correctly, we mistake the real nature of their processes, just as a person
who is unskilled in arithmetic would mistake the processes of anybody who is very quick at
it, and would be led away by them.  Shakespeare is much to me, but the more he is to me, the
more careful I ought to be to discover what is the true law of my own nature, more important
to me after all than Shakespeare's.'

'Exactly.  I know what the law of mine is.  If a man were to present himself to me, I should
rely on that instinct you so much despise, and I am certain that the balancing, see-saw method
would be fatal. It would disclose a host of reasons against any conclusion, and I should never
come to any.'

Clara smiled.  Although this impetuosity was foreign to her, she loved it for the good which
accompanied it.

'You do not mean to say you would accept or reject him at once?'

'No, certainly not.  What I mean is that in a few days, perhaps in a shorter time, something
within me would tell me whether we were suited to one another, although we might not have talked
upon half-a- dozen subjects.'

'I think the risk tremendous.'

'But there is just as much risk the other way.  You would examine your friend, catalogue him,
sum up his beliefs, note his behaviour under various experimental trials, and miserably fail,
after all your scientific investigation, to ascertain just the one important point whether
you loved him and could live with him.  Your reason was not meant for that kind of work.  If
a woman trusts in such matters to the faculty by which, when she wishes to settle whether she
is to take this house or that, she puts the advantages of the larger back kitchen on one side
and the bigger front kitchen on the other, I pity her.'

Mrs Hopgood at this moment came downstairs and asked when in the name of fortune they meant
to have the tea ready.

CHAPTER IV

Frank Palmer, the gentleman whom we saw descend from the coach, was the eldest son of a wholesale
and manufacturing chemist in London. He was now about five-and-twenty, and having just been
admitted as a partner, he had begun, as the custom was in those days, to travel for his firm.
The elder Mr Palmer was a man of refinement, something more than a Whig in politics, and an
enthusiastic member of the Broad Church party, which was then becoming a power in the country.
He was well-to-do, living in a fine old red-brick house at Stoke Newington, with half-a-dozen
acres of ground round it, and, if Frank had been born thirty years later, he would probably
have gone to Cambridge or Oxford.  In those days, however, it was not the custom to send boys
to the Universities unless they were intended for the law, divinity or idleness, and Frank's
training, which was begun at St Paul's school, was completed there.  He lived at home, going
to school in the morning and returning in the evening.  He was surrounded by every influence
which was pure and noble.  Mr Maurice and Mr Sterling were his father's guests, and hence it
may be inferred that there was an altar in the house, and that the sacred flame burnt thereon.
Mr Palmer almost worshipped Mr Maurice, and his admiration was not blind, for Maurice connected
the Bible with what was rational in his friend.  'What! still believable:  no need then to
pitch it overboard:  here after all is the Eternal Word!'  It can be imagined how those who
dared not close their eyes to the light, and yet clung to that book which had been so much
to their forefathers and themselves, rejoiced when they were able to declare that it belonged
to them more than to those who misjudged them and could deny that they were heretics.  The
boy's education was entirely classical and athletic, and as he was quick at learning and loved
his games, he took a high position amongst his school-fellows.  He was not particularly reflective,
but he was generous and courageous, perfectly straightforward, a fair specimen of thousands
of English public-school boys.  As he grew up, he somewhat disappointed his father by a lack
of any real interest in the subjects in which his father was interested.  Mr Palmer, senior,
sometimes recoiled into intolerance and orthodoxy, and bewildered his son who, to use one of
his own phrases, 'hardly knew where his father was.'  Partly the reaction was due to the oscillation
which accompanies serious and independent thought, but mainly it was caused by Mr Palmer's
discontent with Frank's appropriation of a sentiment or doctrine of which he was not the lawful
owner.  Frank, however, was so hearty, so affectionate, and so cheerful, that it was impossible
not to love him dearly.

In his visits to Fenmarket, Frank had often noticed Madge, for the 'Crown and Sceptre' was
his headquarters, and Madge was well enough aware that she had been noticed.  He had inquired
casually who it was who lived next door, and when the waiter told him the name, and that Mr
Hopgood was formerly the bank manager, Frank remembered that he had often heard his father
speak of a Mr Hopgood, a clerk in a bank in London, as one of his best friends.  He did not
fail to ask his father about this friend, and to obtain an introduction to the widow. He had
now brought it to Fenmarket, and within half an hour after he had alighted, he had presented it.

Mrs Hopgood, of course, recollected Mr Palmer perfectly, and the welcome to Frank was naturally
very warm.  It was delightful to connect earlier and happier days with the present, and she
was proud in the possession of a relationship which had lasted so long.  Clara and Madge, too,
were both excited and pleased.  To say nothing of Frank's appearance, of his unsnobbish, deferential
behaviour which showed that he understood who they were and that the little house made no difference
to him, the girls and the mother could not resist a side glance at Fenmarket and the indulgence
of a secret satisfaction that it would soon hear that the son of Mr Palmer, so well known in
every town round about, was on intimate terms with them.

Madge was particularly gay that evening.  The presence of sympathetic people was always a powerful
stimulus to her, and she was often astonished at the witty things and even the wise things
she said in such company, although, when she was alone, so few things wise or witty occurred
to her.  Like all persons who, in conversation, do not so much express the results of previous
conviction obtained in silence as the inspiration of the moment, Madge dazzled everybody by
a brilliancy which would have been impossible if she had communicated that which had been slowly
acquired, but what she left with those who listened to her, did not always seem, on reflection,
to be so much as it appeared to be while she was talking.  Still she was very charming, and
it must be confessed that sometimes her spontaneity was truer than the limitations of speech
more carefully weighed.

'What makes you stay in Fenmarket, Mrs Hopgood?  How I wish you would come to London!'

'I do not wish to leave it now; I have become attached to it; I have very few friends in London,
and lastly, perhaps the most convincing reason, I could not afford it.  Rent and living are
cheaper here than in town.'

'Would you not like to live in London, Miss Hopgood?'

Clara hesitated for a few seconds.

'I am not sure--certainly not by myself.  I was in London once for six months as a governess
in a very pleasant family, where I saw much society; but I was glad to return to Fenmarket.'

'To the scenery round Fenmarket,' interrupted Madge; 'it is so romantic, so mountainous, so
interesting in every way.'

'I was thinking of people, strange as it may appear.  In London nobody really cares for anybody,
at least, not in the sense in which I should use the words.  Men and women in London stand
for certain talents, and are valued often very highly for them, but they are valued merely
as representing these talents.  Now, if I had a talent, I should not be satisfied with admiration
or respect because of it. No matter what admiration, or respect, or even enthusiasm I might
evoke, even if I were told that my services had been immense and that life had been changed
through my instrumentality, I should feel the lack of quiet, personal affection, and that,
I believe, is not common in London.  If I were famous, I would sacrifice all the adoration
of the world for the love of a brother--if I had one--or a sister, who perhaps had never heard
what it was which had made me renowned.'

'Certainly,' said Madge, laughing, 'for the love of SUCH a sister. But, Mr Palmer, I like London.
I like the people, just the people, although I do not know a soul, and not a soul cares a brass
farthing about me.  I am not half so stupid in London as in the country.  I never have a thought
of my own down here.  How should I?  But in London there is plenty of talk about all kinds
of things, and I find I too have something in me.  It is true, as Clara says, that nobody is
anything particular to anybody, but that to me is rather pleasant. I do not want too much of
profound and eternal attachments.  They are rather a burden.  They involve profound and eternal
attachment on my part; and I have always to be at my best; such watchfulness and such jealousy!
I prefer a dressing-gown and slippers and bonds which are not so tight.'

'Madge, Madge, I wish you would sometimes save me the trouble of laboriously striving to discover
what you really mean.'

Mrs Hopgood bethought herself that her daughters were talking too much to one another, as they
often did, even when guests were present, and she therefore interrupted them.

'Mr Palmer, you see both town and country--which do you prefer?'

'Oh!  I hardly know; the country in summer-time, perhaps, and town in the winter.'

This was a safe answer, and one which was not very original; that is to say, it expressed no
very distinct belief; but there was one valid reason why he liked being in London in the winter.

'Your father, I remember, loves music.  I suppose you inherit his taste, and it is impossible
to hear good music in the country.'

'I am very fond of music.  Have you heard "St Paul?"  I was at Birmingham when it was first
performed in this country.  Oh! it IS lovely,' and he began humming 'Be thou faithful unto death.'

Frank did really care for music.  He went wherever good music was to be had; he belonged to
a choral society and was in great request amongst his father's friends at evening entertainments.
He could also play the piano, so far as to be able to accompany himself thereon.  He sang to
himself when he was travelling, and often murmured favourite airs when people around him were
talking.  He had lessons from an old Italian, a little, withered, shabby creature, who was
not very proud of his pupil.  'He is a talent,' said the Signor, 'and he will amuse himself;
good for a ballad at a party, but a musician? no!' and like all mere 'talents' Frank failed
in his songs to give them just what is of most value--just that which separates an artistic
performance from the vast region of well-meaning, respectable, but uninteresting commonplace.
There was a curious lack in him also of correspondence between his music and the rest of himself.
As music is expression, it might be supposed that something which it serves to express would
always lie behind it; but this was not the case with him, although he was so attractive and
delightful in many ways.  There could be no doubt that his love for Beethoven was genuine,
but that which was in Frank Palmer was not that of which the sonatas and symphonies of the
master are the voice.  He went into raptures over the slow movement in the C minor Symphony,
but no C minor slow movement was discernible in his character.

'What on earth can be found in "St Paul" which can be put to music?' said Madge.  'Fancy a
chapter in the Epistle to the Romans turned into a duet!'

'Madge!  Madge!  I am ashamed of you,' said her mother.

'Well, mother,' said Clara, 'I am sure that some of the settings by your divinity, Handel,
are absurd.  "For as in Adam all die" may be true enough, and the harmonies are magnificent,
but I am always tempted to laugh when I hear it.'

Frank hummed the familiar apostrophe 'Be not afraid.'

'Is that a bit of "St Paul"?' said Mrs Hopgood.

'Yes, it goes like this,' and Frank went up to the little piano and sang the song through.

'There is no fault to be found with that,' said Madge, 'so far as the coincidence of sense
and melody is concerned, but I do not care much for oratorios.  Better subjects can be obtained
outside the Bible, and the main reason for selecting the Bible is that what is called religious
music may be provided for good people.  An oratorio, to me, is never quite natural.  Jewish
history is not a musical subject, and, besides, you cannot have proper love songs in an oratorio,
and in them music is at its best.'

Mrs Hopgood was accustomed to her daughter's extravagance, but she was, nevertheless, a little
uncomfortable.

'Ah!' said Frank, who had not moved from the piano, and he struck the first two bars of 'Adelaide.'

'Oh, please,' said Madge, 'go on, go on,' but Frank could not quite finish it.

She was sitting on the little sofa, and she put her feet up, lay and listened with her eyes
shut.  There was a vibration in Mr Palmer's voice not perceptible during his vision of the
crown of life and of fidelity to death.

'Are you going to stay over Sunday?' inquired Mrs Hopgood.

'I am not quite sure; I ought to be back on Sunday evening.  My father likes me to be at home
on that day.'

'Is there not a Mr Maurice who is a friend of your father?'

'Oh, yes, a great friend.'

'He is not High Church nor Low Church?'

'No, not exactly.'

'What is he, then?  What does he believe?'

'Well, I can hardly say; he does not believe that anybody will be burnt in a brimstone lake
for ever.'

'That is what he does not believe,' interposed Clara.

'He believes that Socrates and the great Greeks and Romans who acted up to the light that was
within them were not sent to hell.  I think that is glorious, don't you?'

'Yes, but that also is something he does not believe.  What is there in him which is positive?
What has he distinctly won from the unknown?'

'Ah, Miss Hopgood, you ought to hear him yourself; he is wonderful. I do admire him so much;
I am sure you would like him.'

'If you do not go home on Saturday,' said Mrs Hopgood, 'we shall be pleased if you will have
dinner with us on Sunday; we generally go for a walk in the afternoon.'

Frank hesitated, but at that moment Madge rose from the sofa.  Her hair was disarranged, and
she pushed its thick folds backward.  It grew rather low down on her forehead and stood up
a little on her temples, a mystery of shadow and dark recess.  If it had been electrical with
the force of a strong battery and had touched him, he could not have been more completely paralysed,
and his half-erect resolution to go back on Saturday was instantly laid flat.

'Thank you, Mrs Hopgood,' looking at Madge and meeting her eyes, 'I think it very likely I
shall stay, and if I do I will most certainly accept your kind invitation.'

CHAPTER V

Sunday morning came, and Frank, being in the country, considered himself absolved from the
duty of going to church, and went for a long stroll.  At half-past one he presented himself
at Mrs Hopgood's house.

'I have had a letter from London,' said Clara to Frank, 'telling me a most extraordinary story,
and I should like to know what you think of it.  A man, who was left a widower, had an only
child, a lovely daughter of about fourteen years old, in whose existence his own was completely
wrapped up.  She was subject at times to curious fits of self-absorption or absence of mind,
and while she was under their influence she resembled a somnambulist rather than a sane human
being awake.  Her father would not take her to a physician, for he dreaded lest he should be
advised to send her away from home, and he also feared the effect which any recognition of
her disorder might have upon her.  He believed that in obscure and half-mental diseases like
hers, it was prudent to suppress all notice of them, and that if he behaved to her as if she
were perfectly well, she would stand a chance of recovery.  Moreover, the child was visibly
improving, and it was probable that the disturbance in her health would be speedily outgrown.
One hot day he went out shopping with her, and he observed that she was tired and strange in
her manner, although she was not ill, or, at least, not so ill as he had often before seen
her.  The few purchases they had to make at the draper's were completed, and they went out
into the street.  He took her hand-bag, and, in doing so, it opened and he saw to his horror
a white silk pocket- handkerchief crumpled up in it, which he instantly recognised as one which
had been shown him five minutes before, but he had not bought. The next moment a hand was on
his shoulder.  It was that of an assistant, who requested that they would both return for a
few minutes.  As they walked the half dozen steps back, the father's resolution was taken.
"I am sixty," he thought to himself, "and she is fourteen."  They went into the counting-house
and he confessed that he had taken the handkerchief, but that it was taken by mistake and that
he was about to restore it when he was arrested.  The poor girl was now herself again, but
her mind was an entire blank as to what she had done, and she could not doubt her father's
statement, for it was a man's handkerchief and the bag was in his hands.  The draper was inexorable,
and as he had suffered much from petty thefts of late, had determined to make an example of
the first offender whom he could catch.  The father was accordingly prosecuted, convicted and
sentenced to imprisonment.  When his term had expired, his daughter, who, I am glad to say,
never for an instant lost her faith in him, went away with him to a distant part of the country,
where they lived under an assumed name.  About ten years afterwards he died and kept his secret
to the last; but he had seen the complete recovery and happy marriage of his child.  It was
remarkable that it never occurred to her that she might have been guilty, but her father's
confession, as already stated, was apparently so sincere that she could do nothing but believe
him.  You will wonder how the facts were discovered.  After his death a sealed paper disclosing
them was found, with the inscription, "Not to be opened during my daughter's life, and if she
should have children or a husband who may survive her, it is to be burnt."  She had no children,
and when she died as an old woman, her husband also being dead, the seal was broken.'

'Probably,' said Madge, 'nobody except his daughter believed he was not a thief.  For her sake
he endured the imputation of common larceny, and was content to leave the world with only a
remote chance that he would ever be justified.'

'I wonder,' said Frank, 'that he did not admit that it was his daughter who had taken the handkerchief,
and excuse her on the ground of her ailment.'

'He could not do that,' replied Madge.  'The object of his life was to make as little of the
ailment as possible.  What would have been the effect on her if she had been made aware of
its fearful consequences?  Furthermore, would he have been believed?  And then-- awful thought,
the child might have suspected him of attempting to shield himself at her expense!  Do you
think you could be capable of such sacrifice, Mr Palmer?'

Frank hesitated.  'It would--'

'The question is not fair, Madge,' said Mrs Hopgood, interrupting him.  'You are asking for
a decision when all the materials to make up a decision are not present.  It is wrong to question
ourselves in cold blood as to what we should do in a great strait; for the emergency brings
the insight and the power necessary to deal with it. I often fear lest, if such-and-such a
trial were to befall me, I should miserably fail.  So I should, furnished as I now am, but
not as I should be under stress of the trial.'

'What is the use,' said Clara, 'of speculating whether we can, or cannot, do this or that?
It IS now an interesting subject for discussion whether the lie was a sin.'

'No,' said Madge, 'a thousand times no.'

'Brief and decisive.  Well, Mr Palmer, what do you say?'

'That is rather an awkward question.  A lie is a lie.'

'But not,' broke in Madge, vehemently, 'to save anybody whom you love.  Is a contemptible little
two-foot measuring-tape to be applied to such an action as that?'

'The consequences of such a philosophy, though, my dear,' said Mrs Hopgood, 'are rather serious.
The moment you dispense with a fixed standard, you cannot refuse permission to other people
to dispense with it also.'

'Ah, yes, I know all about that, but I am not going to give up my instinct for the sake of
a rule.  Do what you feel to be right, and let the rule go hang.  Somebody, cleverer in logic
than we are, will come along afterwards and find a higher rule which we have obeyed, and will
formulate it concisely.'

'As for my poor self,' said Clara, 'I do not profess to know, without the rule, what is right
and what is not.  We are always trying to transcend the rule by some special pleading, and
often in virtue of some fancied superiority.  Generally speaking, the attempt is fatal.'

'Madge,' said Mrs Hopgood, 'your dogmatic decision may have been interesting, but it prevented
the expression of Mr Palmer's opinion.'

Madge bent forward and politely inclined her head to the embarrassed Frank.

'I do not know what to say.  I have never thought much about such matters.  Is not what they
call casuistry a science among Roman Catholics?  If I were in a difficulty and could not tell
right from wrong, I should turn Catholic, and come to you as my priest, Mrs Hopgood.'

'Then you would do, not what you thought right yourself, but what I thought right.  The worth
of the right to you is that it is your right, and that you arrive at it in your own way.  Besides,
you might not have time to consult anybody.  Were you never compelled to settle promptly a
case of this kind?'

'I remember once at school, when the mathematical master was out of the class-room, a boy named
Carpenter ran up to the blackboard and wrote "Carrots" on it.  That was the master's nickname,
for he was red-haired.  Scarcely was the word finished, when Carpenter heard him coming along
the passage.  There was just time partially to rub out some of the big letters, but CAR remained,
and Carpenter was standing at the board when "Carrots" came in.  He was an excitable man, and
he knew very well what the boys called him.

'"What have you been writing on the board, sir?"

'"Carpenter, sir."

'The master examined the board.  The upper half of the second R was plainly perceptible, but
it might possibly have been a P.  He turned round, looked steadily at Carpenter for a moment,
and then looked at us.  Carpenter was no favourite, but not a soul spoke.

'"Go to your place, sir."

'Carpenter went to his place, the letters were erased and the lesson was resumed.  I was greatly
perplexed; I had acquiesced in a cowardly falsehood.  Carrots was a great friend of mine, and
I could not bear to feel that he was humbugged, so when we were outside I went up to Carpenter
and told him he was an infernal sneak, and we had a desperate fight, and I licked him, and
blacked both his eyes.  I did not know what else to do.'

The company laughed.

'We cannot,' said Madge, 'all of us come to terms after this fashion with our consciences,
but we have had enough of these discussions on morality.  Let us go out.'

They went out, and, as some relief from the straight road, they turned into a field as they
came home, and walked along a footpath which crossed the broad, deep ditches by planks.  They
were within about fifty yards of the last and broadest ditch, more a dyke than a ditch, when
Frank, turning round, saw an ox which they had not noticed, galloping after them.

'Go on, go on,' he cried, 'make for the plank.'

He discerned in an instant that unless the course of the animal could be checked it would overtake
them before the bridge could be reached. The women fled, but Frank remained.  He was in the
habit of carrying a heavy walking-stick, the end of which he had hollowed out in his schooldays
and had filled up with lead.  Just as the ox came upon him, it laid its head to the ground,
and Frank, springing aside, dealt it a tremendous, two-handed blow on the forehead with his
knobbed weapon.  The creature was dazed, it stopped and staggered, and in another instant Frank
was across the bridge in safety.  There was a little hysterical sobbing, but it was soon over.

'Oh, Mr Palmer,' said Mrs Hopgood, 'what presence of mind and what courage!  We should have
been killed without you.'

'The feat is not original, Mrs Hopgood.  I saw it done by a tough little farmer last summer
on a bull that was really mad.  There was no ditch for him though, poor fellow, and he had
to jump a hedge.'

'You did not find it difficult,' said Madge, 'to settle your problem when it came to you in
the shape of a wild ox.'

'Because there was nothing to settle,' said Frank, laughing; 'there was only one thing to be done.'

'So you believed, or rather, so you saw,' said Clara.  'I should have seen half-a-dozen things
at once--that is to say, nothing.'

'And I,' said Madge, 'should have settled it the wrong way:  I am sure I should, even if I
had been a man.  I should have bolted.'

Frank stayed to tea, and the evening was musical.  He left about ten, but just as the door
had shut he remembered he had forgotten his stick.  He gave a gentle rap and Madge appeared.
She gave him his stick.

'Good-bye again.  Thanks for my life.'

Frank cursed himself that he could not find the proper word.  He knew there was something which
might be said and ought to be said, but he could not say it.  Madge held out her hand to him,
he raised it to his lips and kissed it, and then, astonished at his boldness, he instantly
retreated.  He went to the 'Crown and Sceptre' and was soon in bed, but not to sleep.  Strange,
that the moment we lie down in the dark, images, which were half obscured, should become so
intensely luminous!  Madge hovered before Frank with almost tangible distinctness, and he felt
his fingers moving in her heavy, voluptuous tresses.  Her picture at last became almost painful
to him and shamed him, so that he turned over from side to side to avoid it.  He had never
been thrown into the society of women of his own age, for he had no sister, and a fire was
kindled within him which burnt with a heat all the greater because his life had been so pure.
At last he fell asleep and did not wake till late in the morning.  He had just time to eat
his breakfast, pay one more business visit in the town, and catch the coach due at eleven o'clock
from Lincoln to London.  As the horses were being changed, he walked as near as he dared venture
to the windows of the cottage next door, but he could see nobody. When the coach, however,
began to move, he turned round and looked behind him, and a hand was waved to him.  He took
off his hat, and in five minutes he was clear of the town.  It was in sight a long way, but
when, at last, it disappeared, a cloud of wretchedness swept over him as the vapour sweeps
up from the sea.  What was she doing? talking to other people, existing for others, laughing
with others! There were miles between himself and Fenmarket.  Life! what was life? A few moments
of living and long, dreary gaps between.  All this, however, is a vain attempt to delineate
what was shapeless.  It was an intolerable, unvanquishable oppression.  This was Love; this
was the blessing which the god with the ruddy wings had bestowed on him. It was a relief to
him when the coach rattled through Islington, and in a few minutes had landed him at the 'Angel.'

CHAPTER VI

There was to be a grand entertainment in the assembly room of the 'Crown and Sceptre' in aid
of the County Hospital.  Mrs Martin, widow of one of the late partners in the bank, lived in
a large house near Fenmarket, and still had an interest in the business.  She was distinctly
above anybody who lived in the town, and she knew how to show her superiority by venturing
sometimes to do what her urban neighbours could not possibly do.  She had been known to carry
through the street a quart bottle of horse physic although it was wrapped up in nothing but
brown paper.  On her way she met the brewer's wife, who was more aggrieved than she was when
Mrs Martin's carriage swept past her in the dusty, narrow lane which led to the Hall.  Mrs
Martin could also afford to recognise in a measure the claims of education and talent.  A gentleman
came from London to lecture in the town, and showed astonished Fenmarket an orrery and a magic
lantern with dissolving views of the Holy Land.  The exhibition had been provided in order
to extinguish a debt incurred in repairing the church, but the rector's wife, and the brewer's
wife, after consultation, decided that they must leave the lecturer to return to his inn. 
Mrs Martin, however, invited him to supper.  Of course she knew Mr Hopgood well, and knew that
he was no ordinary man.  She knew also something of Mrs Hopgood and the daughters, and that
they were no ordinary women.  She had been heard to say that they were ladies, and that Mr
Hopgood was a gentleman; and she kept up a distant kind of intimacy with them, always nodded
to them whenever she met them, and every now and then sent them grapes and flowers.  She had
observed once or twice to Mrs Tubbs that Mr Hopgood was a remarkable person, who was quite
scientific and therefore did not associate with the rest of the Fenmarket folk; and Mrs Tubbs
was much annoyed, particularly by a slight emphasis which she thought she detected in the 'therefore,'
for Mr Tubbs had told her that one of the smaller London brewers, who had only about fifty
public-houses, had refused to meet at dinner a learned French chemist who had written books.
Mrs Martin could not make friends with the Hopgoods, nor enter the cottage.  It would have
been a transgression of that infinitely fine and tortuous line whose inexplicable convolutions
mark off what is forbidden to a society lady.  Clearly, however, the Hopgoods could be requested
to co-operate at the 'Crown and Sceptre;' in fact, it would be impolitic not to put some of
the townsfolk on the list of patrons. So it came about that Mrs Hopgood was included, and that
she was made responsible for the provision of one song and one recitation.  For the song it
was settled that Frank Palmer should be asked, as he would be in Fenmarket.  Usually he came
but once every half year, but he had not been able, so he said, to finish all his work the
last time.  The recitation Madge undertook.

The evening arrived, the room was crowded and a dozen private carriages stood in the 'Crown
and Sceptre' courtyard.  Frank called for the Hopgoods.  Mrs Hopgood and Clara sat with presentation
tickets in the second row, amongst the fashionable folk; Frank and Madge were upon the platform.
Frank was loudly applauded in 'Il Mio Tesoro,' but the loudest applause of the evening was
reserved for Madge, who declaimed Byron's 'Destruction of Sennacherib' with much energy.  She
certainly looked very charming in her red gown, harmonising with her black hair.  The men in
the audience were vociferous for something more, and would not be contented until she again
came forward.  The truth is, that the wily young woman had prepared herself beforehand for
possibilities, but she artfully concealed her preparation.  Looking on the ground and hesitating,
she suddenly raised her head as if she had just remembered something, and then repeated Sir
Henry Wotton's 'Happy Life.'  She was again greeted with cheers, subdued so as to be in accordance
with the character of the poem, but none the less sincere, and in the midst of them she gracefully
bowed and retired.  Mrs Martin complimented her warmly at the end of the performance, and inwardly
debated whether Madge could be asked to enliven one of the parties at the Hall, and how it
could, at the same time, be made clear to the guests that she and her mother, who must come
with her, were not even acquaintances, properly so called, but were patronised as persons of
merit living in the town which the Hall protected.  Mrs Martin was obliged to be very careful.
She certainly was on the list at the Lord Lieutenant's, but she was in the outer ring, and
she was not asked to those small and select little dinners which were given to Sir Egerton,
the Dean of Peterborough, Lord Francis, and his brother, the county member.  She decided, however,
that she could make perfectly plain the conditions upon which the Hopgoods would be present,
and the next day she sent Madge a little note asking her if she would 'assist in some festivities'
at the Hall in about two months' time, which were to be given in celebration of the twenty-first
birthday of Mrs Martin's third son.  The scene from the 'Tempest,' where Ferdinand and Miranda
are discovered playing chess, was suggested, and it was proposed that Madge should be Miranda,
and Mr Palmer Ferdinand.  Mrs Martin concluded with a hope that Mrs Hopgood and her eldest
daughter would 'witness the performance.'

Frank joyously consented, for amateur theatricals had always attracted him, and in a few short
weeks he was again at Fenmarket. He was obliged to be there for three or four days before the
entertainment, in order to attend the rehearsals, which Mrs Martin had put under the control
of a professional gentleman from London, and Madge and he were consequently compelled to make
frequent journeys to the Hall.

At last the eventful night arrived, and a carriage was hired next door to take the party. 
They drove up to the grand entrance and were met by a footman, who directed Madge and Frank
to their dressing- rooms, and escorted Mrs Hopgood and Clara to their places in the theatre.
They had gone early in order to accommodate Frank and Madge, and they found themselves alone.
They were surprised that there was nobody to welcome them, and a little more surprised when
they found that the places allotted to them were rather in the rear. Presently two or three
fiddlers were seen, who began to tune their instruments.  Then some Fenmarket folk and some
of the well-to-do tenants on the estate made their appearance, and took seats on either side
of Mrs Hopgood and Clara.  Quite at the back were the servants. At five minutes to eight the
band struck up the overture to 'Zampa,' and in the midst of it in sailed Mrs Martin and a score
or two of fashionably-dressed people, male and female.  The curtain ascended and Prospero's
cell was seen.  Alonso and his companions were properly grouped, and Prospero began, -

   'Behold, Sir King,
The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.'

The audience applauded him vigorously when he came to the end of his speech, but there was
an instantaneous cry of 'hush!' when Prospero disclosed the lovers.  It was really very pretty.
Miranda wore a loose, simple, white robe, and her wonderful hair was partly twisted into a
knot, and partly strayed down to her waist.  The dialogue between the two was spoken with much
dramatic feeling, and when Ferdinand came to the lines -

   'Sir, she is mortal,
But by immortal Providence she's mine,'

old Boston, a worthy and wealthy farmer, who sat next to Mrs Hopgood, cried out 'hear, hear!'
but was instantly suppressed.

He put his head down behind the people in front of him, rubbed his knees, grinned, and then
turned to Mrs Hopgood, whom he knew, and whispered, with his hand to his mouth, -

'And a precious lucky chap he is.'

Mrs Hopgood watched intently, and when Gonzalo invoked the gods to drop a blessed crown on
the couple, and the applause was renewed, and Boston again cried 'hear, hear!' without fear
of check, she did not applaud, for something told her that behind this stage show a drama was
being played of far more serious importance.

The curtain fell, but there were loud calls for the performers.  It rose, and they presented
themselves, Alonso still holding the hands of the happy pair.  The cheering now was vociferous,
more particularly when a wreath was flung at the feet of the young princess, and Ferdinand,
stooping, placed it on her head.

Again the curtain fell, the band struck up some dance music and the audience were treated to
'something light,' and roared with laughter at a pretty chambermaid at an inn who captivated
and bamboozled a young booby who was staying there, pitched him overboard; 'wondered what he
meant;' sang an audacious song recounting her many exploits, and finished with a pas-seul.

The performers and their friends were invited to a sumptuous supper, and the Fenmarket folk
were not at home until half-past two in the morning.  On their way back, Clara broke out against
the juxtaposition of Shakespeare and such vulgarity.

'Much better,' she said, 'to have left the Shakespeare out altogether.  The lesson of the sequence
is that each is good in its way, a perfectly hateful doctrine to me.

Frank and Madge were, however, in the best of humours, especially Frank, who had taken a glass
of wine beyond his customary very temperate allowance.

'But, Miss Hopgood, Mrs Martin had to suit all tastes; we must not be too severe upon her.'

There was something in this remark most irritating to Clara; the word 'tastes,' for example,
as if the difference between Miranda and the chambermaid were a matter of 'taste.'  She was
annoyed too with Frank's easy, cheery tones for she felt deeply what she said, and his mitigation
and smiling latitudinarianism were more exasperating than direct opposition.

'I am sure,' continued Frank, 'that if we were to take the votes of the audience, Miranda would
be the queen of the evening;' and he put the crown which he had brought away with him on her
head again.

Clara was silent.  In a few moments they were at the door of their house.  It had begun to
rain, and Madge, stepping out of the carriage in a hurry, threw a shawl over her head, forgetting
the wreath.  It fell into the gutter and was splashed with mud.  Frank picked it up, wiped
it as well as he could with his pocket-handkerchief, took it into the parlour and laid it on
a chair.

CHAPTER VII

The next morning it still rained, a cold rain from the north-east, a very disagreeable type
of weather on the Fenmarket flats.  Madge was not awake until late, and when she caught sight
of the grey sky and saw her finery tumbled on the floor--no further use for it in any shape
save as rags--and the dirty crown, which she had brought upstairs, lying on the heap, the leaves
already fading, she felt depressed and miserable.  The breakfast was dull, and for the most
part all three were silent.  Mrs Hopgood and Clara went away to begin their housework, leaving
Madge alone.

'Madge,' cried Mrs Hopgood, 'what am I to do with this thing?  It is of no use to preserve
it; it is dead and covered with dirt.'

'Throw it down here.'

She took it and rammed it into the fire.  At that moment she saw Frank pass.  He was evidently
about to knock, but she ran to the door and opened it.

'I did not wish to keep you waiting in the wet.'

'I am just off but I could not help calling to see how you are. What! burning your laurels,
the testimony to your triumph?'

'Triumph! rather transitory; finishes in smoke,' and she pushed two or three of the unburnt
leaves amongst the ashes and covered them over.  He stooped down, picked up a leaf, smoothed
it between his fingers, and then raised his eyes.  They met hers at that instant, as she lifted
them and looked in his face.  They were near one another, and his hands strayed towards hers
till they touched.  She did not withdraw; he clasped the hand, she not resisting; in another
moment his arms were round her, his face was on hers, and he was swept into self-forgetfulness.
Suddenly the horn of the coach about to start awoke him, and he murmured the line from one
of his speeches of the night before -

'But by immortal Providence she's mine.'

She released herself a trifle, held her head back as if she desired to survey him apart from
her, so that the ecstasy of union might be renewed, and then fell on his neck.

The horn once more sounded, she let him out silently, and he was off. Mrs Hopgood and Clara
presently came downstairs.

'Mr Palmer came in to bid you good-bye, but he heard the coach and was obliged to rush away.'

'What a pity,' said Mrs Hopgood, 'that you did not call us.'

'I thought he would be able to stay longer.'

The lines which followed Frank's quotation came into her head, -

'Sweet lord, you play me false.'
      'No, my dearest love,
   I would not for the world.'

'An omen,' she said to herself; '"he would not for the world."'

She was in the best of spirits all day long.  When the housework was over and they were quiet
together, she said, -

'Now, my dear mother and sister, I want to know how the performance pleased you.'

'It was as good as it could be,' replied her mother, 'but I cannot think why all plays should
turn upon lovemaking.  I wonder whether the time will ever come when we shall care for a play
in which there is no courtship.'

'What a horrible heresy, mother,' said Madge.

'It may be so; it may be that I am growing old, but it seems astonishing to me sometimes that
the world does not grow a little weary of endless variations on the same theme.'

'Never,' said Madge, 'as long as it does not weary of the thing itself, and it is not likely
to do that.  Fancy a young man and a young woman stopping short and exclaiming, "This is just
what every son of Adam and daughter of Eve has gone through before; why should we proceed?"
Besides, it is the one emotion common to the whole world; we can all comprehend it.  Once more,
it reveals character. In Hamlet and Othello, for example, what is interesting is not solely
the bare love.  The natures of Hamlet and Othello are brought to light through it as they would
not have been through any other stimulus.  I am sure that no ordinary woman ever shows what
she really is, except when she is in love.  Can you tell what she is from what she calls her
religion, or from her friends, or even from her husband?'

'Would it not be equally just to say women are more alike in love than in anything else?  Mind,
I do not say alike, but more alike.  Is it not the passion which levels us all?'

'Oh, mother, mother! did one ever hear such dreadful blasphemy?  That the loves, for example,
of two such cultivated, exquisite creatures as Clara and myself would be nothing different
from those of the barmaids next door?'

'Well, at anyrate, I do not want to see MY children in love to understand what they are--to
me at least.'

'Then, if you comprehend us so completely--and let us have no more philosophy--just tell me,
should I make a good actress?  Oh! to be able to sway a thousand human beings into tears or
laughter!  It must be divine.'

'No, I do not think you would,' replied Clara.

'Why not, miss?  YOUR opinion, mind, was not asked.  Did I not act to perfection last night?'

'Yes.'

'Then why are you so decisive?'

'Try a different part some day.  I may be mistaken.'

'You are very oracular.'

She turned to the piano, played a few chords, closed the instrument, swung herself round on
the music stool, and said she should go for a walk.

CHAPTER VIII

It was Mr Palmer's design to send Frank abroad as soon as he understood the home trade.  It
was thought it would be an advantage to him to learn something of foreign manufacturing processes.
Frank had gladly agreed to go, but he was now rather in the mood for delay. Mr Palmer conjectured
a reason for it, and the conjecture was confirmed when, after two or three more visits to Fenmarket,
perfectly causeless, so far as business was concerned, Frank asked for the paternal sanction
to his engagement with Madge.  Consent was willingly given, for Mr Palmer knew the family well;
letters passed between him and Mrs Hopgood, and it was arranged that Frank's visit to Germany
should be postponed till the summer.  He was now frequently at Fenmarket as Madge's accepted
suitor, and, as the spring advanced, their evenings were mostly spent by themselves out of
doors.  One afternoon they went for a long walk, and on their return they rested by a stile.
Those were the days when Tennyson was beginning to stir the hearts of the young people in England,
and the two little green volumes had just become a treasure in the Hopgood household.  Mr Palmer,
senior, knew them well, and Frank, hearing his father speak so enthusiastically about them,
thought Madge would like them, and had presented them to her.  He had heard one or two read
aloud at home, and had looked at one or two himself, but had gone no further.  Madge, her mother,
and her sister had read and re-read them.

'Oh,' said Madge, 'for that Vale in Ida.  Here in these fens how I long for something that
is not level!

Go on with it, Frank.'

'I cannot.'

'But you know OEnone?'

'I cannot say I do.  I began it--'

'Frank, how could you begin it and lay it down unfinished?  Besides, those lines are some of
the first; you MUST remember -

"Behind the valley topmost Gargarus Stands up and takes the morning."'

'No, I do not recollect, but I will learn them; learn them for your sake.'

'I do not want you to learn them for my sake.'

'But I shall.'

She had taken off her hat and his hand strayed to her neck.  Her head fell on his shoulder
and she had forgotten his ignorance of OEnone. Presently she awoke from her delicious trance
and they moved homewards in silence.  Frank was a little uneasy.

'I do greatly admire Tennyson,' he said.

'What do you admire?  You have hardly looked at him.'

'I saw a very good review of him.  I will look that review up, by the way, before I come down
again.  Mr Maurice was talking about it.'

Madge had a desire to say something, but she did not know what to say, a burden lay upon her
chest.  It was that weight which presses there when we are alone with those with whom we are
not strangers, but with whom we are not completely at home, and she actually found herself
impatient and half-desirous of solitude.  This must be criminal or disease, she thought to
herself, and she forcibly recalled Frank's virtues.  She was so far successful that when they
parted and he kissed her, she was more than usually caressing, and her ardent embrace, at least
for the moment, relieved that unpleasant sensation in the region of the heart.  When he had
gone she reasoned with herself.  What a miserable counterfeit of love, she argued, is mere
intellectual sympathy, a sympathy based on books!  What did Miranda know about Ferdinand's
'views' on this or that subject?  Love is something independent of 'views.'  It is an attraction
which has always been held to be inexplicable, but whatever it may be it is not 'views.'  She
was becoming a little weary, she thought, of what was called 'culture.'  These creatures whom
we know through Shakespeare and Goethe are ghostly.  What have we to do with them?  It is idle
work to read or even to talk fine things about them.  It ends in nothing.  What we really have
to go through and that which goes through it are interesting, but not circumstances and character
impossible to us.  When Frank spoke of his business, which he understood, he was wise, and
some observations which he made the other day, on the management of his workpeople, would have
been thought original if they had been printed.  The true artist knows that his hero must be
a character shaping events and shaped by them, and not a babbler about literature.  Frank,
also, was so susceptible. He liked to hear her read to him, and her enthusiasm would soon be
his.  Moreover, how gifted he was, unconsciously, with all that makes a man admirable, with
courage, with perfect unselfishness!  How handsome he was, and then his passion for her!  She
had read something of passion, but she never knew till now what the white intensity of its
flame in a man could be.  She was committed, too, happily committed; it was an engagement.

Thus, whenever doubt obtruded itself, she poured a self-raised tide over it and concealed it.
Alas! it could not be washed away; it was a little sharp rock based beneath the ocean's depths,
and when the water ran low its dark point reappeared.  She was more successful, however, than
many women would have been, for, although her interest in ideas was deep, there was fire in
her blood, and Frank's arm around her made the world well nigh disappear; her surrender was
entire, and if Sinai had thundered in her ears she would not have heard.  She was destitute
of that power, which her sister possessed, of surveying herself from a distance.  On the contrary,
her emotion enveloped her, and the safeguard of reflection on it was impossible to her.

As to Frank, no doubt ever approached him.  He was intoxicated, and beside himself.  He had
been brought up in a clean household, knowing nothing of the vice by which so many young men
are overcome, and woman hitherto had been a mystery to him.  Suddenly he found himself the
possessor of a beautiful creature, whose lips it was lawful to touch and whose heartbeats he
could feel as he pressed her to his breast.  It was permitted him to be alone with her, to
sit on the floor and rest his head on her knees, and he had ventured to capture one of her
slippers and carry it off to London, where he kept it locked up amongst his treasures.  If
he had been drawn over Fenmarket sluice in a winter flood he would not have been more incapable
of resistance.

Every now and then Clara thought she discerned in Madge that she was not entirely content,
but the cloud-shadows swept past so rapidly and were followed by such dazzling sunshine that
she was perplexed and hoped that her sister's occasional moodiness might be due to parting
and absence, or the anticipation of them.  She never ventured to say anything about Frank to
Madge, for there was something in her which forbade all approach from that side.  Once when
he had shown his ignorance of what was so familiar to the Hopgoods, and Clara had expected
some sign of dissatisfaction from her sister, she appeared ostentatiously to champion him against
anticipated criticism.  Clara interpreted the warning and was silent, but, after she had left
the room with her mother in order that the lovers might be alone, she went upstairs and wept
many tears.  Ah! it is a sad experience when the nearest and dearest suspects that we are aware
of secret disapproval, knows that it is justifiable, throws up a rampart and becomes defensively
belligerent.  From that moment all confidence is at an end.  Without a word, perhaps, the love
and friendship of years disappear, and in the place of two human beings transparent to each
other, there are two who are opaque and indifferent.  Bitter, bitter! If the cause of separation
were definite disagreement upon conduct or belief, we could pluck up courage, approach and
come to an understanding, but it is impossible to bring to speech anything which is so close
to the heart, and there is, therefore, nothing left for us but to submit and be dumb.

CHAPTER IX

It was now far into June, and Madge and Frank extended their walks and returned later.  He
had come down to spend his last Sunday with the Hopgoods before starting with his father for
Germany, and on the Monday they were to leave London.

Wordsworth was one of the divinities at Stoke Newington, and just before Frank visited Fenmarket
that week, he had heard the Intimations of Immortality read with great fervour.  Thinking that
Madge would be pleased with him if she found that he knew something about that famous Ode,
and being really smitten with some of the passages in it, he learnt it, and just as they were
about to turn homewards one sultry evening he suddenly began to repeat it, and declaimed it
to the end with much rhetorical power.

'Bravo!' said Madge, 'but, of all Wordsworth's poems, that is the one for which I believe I
care the least.'

Frank's countenance fell.

'Oh, me!  I thought it was just what would suit you.'

'No, not particularly.

But the very title--Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood--is unmeaning
to me, and as for the verse which is in everybody's mouth -

"Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;"

and still worse the vision of "that immortal sea," and of the children who "sport upon the
shore," they convey nothing whatever to me.  I find though they are much admired by the clergy
of the better sort, and by certain religiously-disposed people, to whom thinking is distasteful
or impossible.  Because they cannot definitely believe, they fling themselves with all the
more fervour upon these cloudy Wordsworthian phrases, and imagine they see something solid
in the coloured fog.'

It was now growing dark and a few heavy drops of rain began to fall, but in a minute or two
they ceased.  Frank, contrary to his usual wont, was silent.  There was something undiscovered
in Madge, a region which he had not visited and perhaps could not enter.  She discerned in
an instant what she had done, and in an instant repented.  He had taken so much pains with
a long piece of poetry for her sake:  was not that better than agreement in a set of propositions?
Scores of persons might think as she thought about the ode, who would not spend a moment in
doing anything to gratify her. It was delightful also to reflect that Frank imagined she would
sympathise with anything written in that temper.  She recalled what she herself had said when
somebody gave Clara a copy in 'Parian' of a Greek statue, a thing coarse in outline and vulgar.
Clara was about to put it in a cupboard in the attic, but Madge had pleaded so pathetically
that the donor had in a measure divined what her sister loved, and had done her best, although
she had made a mistake, that finally the statue was placed on the bedroom mantelpiece.  Madge's
heart overflowed, and Frank had never attracted her so powerfully as at that moment.  She took
his hand softly in hers.

'Frank,' she murmured, as she bent her head towards him, 'it is really a lovely poem.'

Suddenly there was a flash of forked lightning at some distance, followed in a few seconds
by a roll of thunder increasing in intensity until the last reverberation seemed to shake the
ground. They took refuge in a little barn and sat down.  Madge, who was timid and excited in
a thunderstorm, closed her eyes to shield herself from the glare.

The tumult in the heavens lasted for nearly two hours and, when it was over, Madge and Frank
walked homewards without speaking a word for a good part of the way.

'I cannot, cannot go to-morrow,' he suddenly cried, as they neared the town.

'You SHALL go,' she replied calmly.

'But, Madge, think of me in Germany, think what my dreams and thoughts will be--you here--hundreds
of miles between us.'

She had never seen him so shaken with terror.

'You SHALL go; not another word.'

'I must say something--what can I say?  My God, my God, have mercy on me!'

'Mercy! mercy!' she repeated, half unconsciously, and then rousing herself, exclaimed, 'You
shall not say it; I will not hear; now, good-bye.'

They had come to the door; he went inside; she took his face between her hands, left one kiss
on his forehead, led him back to the doorway and he heard the bolts drawn.  When he recovered
himself he went to the 'Crown and Sceptre' and tried to write a letter to her, but the words
looked hateful, horrible on the paper, and they were not the words he wanted.  He dared not
go near the house the next morning, but as he passed it on the coach he looked at the windows.
Nobody was to be seen, and that night he left England.

'Did you hear,' said Clara to her mother at breakfast, 'that the lightning struck one of the
elms in the avenue at Mrs Martin's yesterday evening and splintered it to the ground?'

CHAPTER X

In a few days Madge received the following letter:-

'FRANKFORT, O. M., HOTEL WAIDENBUSCH.

'My dearest Madge,--I do not know how to write to you.  I have begun a dozen letters but I
cannot bring myself to speak of what lies before me, hiding the whole world from me.  Forgiveness!
how is any forgiveness possible?  But Madge, my dearest Madge, remember that my love is intenser
than ever.  What has happened has bound you closer to me.  I IMPLORE you to let me come back.
I will find a thousand excuses for returning, and we will marry.  We had vowed marriage to
each other and why should not our vows be fulfilled?  Marriage, marriage AT ONCE.  You will
not, you CANNOT, no, you CANNOT, you must see you cannot refuse.  My father wishes to make
this town his headquarters for ten days.  Write by return for mercy's sake.--Your ever devoted

'FRANK.'

The reply came only a day late.

'My dear Frank,--Forgiveness!  Who is to be forgiven?  Not you.  You believed you loved me,
but I doubted my love, and I know now that no true love for you exists.  We must part, and
part forever.  Whatever wrong may have been done, marriage to avoid disgrace would be a wrong
to both of us infinitely greater.  I owe you an expiation; your release is all I can offer,
and it is insufficient.  I can only plead that I was deaf and blind.  By some miracle, I cannot
tell how, my ears and eyes are opened, and I hear and see.  It is not the first time in my
life that the truth has been revealed to me suddenly, supernaturally, I may say, as if in a
vision, and I know the revelation is authentic.  There must be no wavering, no half- measures,
and I absolutely forbid another letter from you.  If one arrives I must, for the sake of my
own peace and resolution, refuse to read it.  You have simply to announce to your father that
the engagement is at an end, and give no reasons.--Your faithful friend

'MADGE HOPGOOD.'

Another letter did come, but Madge was true to her word, and it was returned unopened.

For a long time Frank was almost incapable of reflection.  He dwelt on an event which might
happen, but which he dared not name; and if it should happen!  Pictures of his father, his
home his father's friends, Fenmarket, the Hopgood household, passed before him with such wild
rapidity and intermingled complexity that it seemed as if the reins had dropped out of his
hands and he was being hurried away to madness.

He resisted with all his might this dreadful sweep of the imagination, tried to bring himself
back into sanity and to devise schemes by which, although he was prohibited from writing to
Madge, he might obtain news of her.  Her injunction might not be final. There was but one hope
for him, one possibility of extrication, one necessity--their marriage.  It MUST be.  He dared
not think of what might be the consequences if they did not marry.

Hitherto Madge had given no explanation to her mother or sister of the rupture, but one morning--nearly
two months had now passed--Clara did not appear at breakfast.

'Clara is not here,' said Mrs Hopgood; 'she was very tired last night, perhaps it is better
not to disturb her.'

'Oh, no! please let her alone.  I will see if she still sleeps.'

Madge went upstairs, opened her sister's door noiselessly, saw that she was not awake, and
returned.  When breakfast was over she rose, and after walking up and down the room once or
twice, seated herself in the armchair by her mother's side.  Her mother drew herself a little
nearer, and took Madge's hand gently in her own.

'Madge, my child, have you nothing to say to your mother?'

'Nothing.'

'Cannot you tell me why Frank and you have parted?  Do you not think I ought to know something
about such an event in the life of one so close to me?'

'I broke off the engagement:  we were not suited to one another.'

'I thought as much; I honour you; a thousand times better that you should separate now than
find out your mistake afterwards when it is irrevocable.  Thank God, He has given you such
courage!  But you must have suffered--I know you must;' and she tenderly kissed her daughter.

'Oh, mother! mother!' cried Madge, 'what is the worst--at least to-- you--the worst that can
happen to a woman?'

Mrs Hopgood did not speak; something presented itself which she refused to recognise, but she
shuddered.  Before she could recover herself Madge broke out again, -

'It has happened to me; mother, your daughter has wrecked your peace for ever!'

'And he has abandoned you?'

'No, no; I told you it was I who left him.'

It was Mrs Hopgood's custom, when any evil news was suddenly communicated to her, to withdraw
at once if possible to her own room. She detached herself from Madge, rose, and, without a
word, went upstairs and locked her door.  The struggle was terrible.  So much thought, so much
care, such an education, such noble qualities, and they had not accomplished what ordinary
ignorant Fenmarket mothers and daughters were able to achieve!  This fine life, then, was a
failure, and a perfect example of literary and artistic training had gone the way of the common
wenches whose affiliation cases figured in the county newspaper.  She was shaken and bewildered.
She was neither orthodox nor secular.  She was too strong to be afraid that what she disbelieved
could be true, and yet a fatal weakness had been disclosed in what had been set up as its substitute.
She could not treat her child as a sinner who was to be tortured into something like madness
by immitigable punishment, but, on the other hand, she felt that this sorrow was unlike other
sorrows and that it could never be healed.  For some time she was powerless, blown this way
and that way by contradictory storms, and unable to determine herself to any point whatever.
She was not, however, new to the tempest.  She had lived and had survived when she thought
she must have gone down. She had learned the wisdom which the passage through desperate straits
can bring.  At last she prayed and in a few minutes a message was whispered to her.  She went
into the breakfast-room and seated herself again by Madge.  Neither uttered a word, but Madge
fell down before her, and, with a great cry, buried her face in her mother's lap.  She remained
kneeling for some time waiting for a rebuke, but none came.  Presently she felt smoothing hands
on her head and the soft impress of lips.  So was she judged.

CHAPTER XI

It was settled that they should leave Fenmarket.  Their departure caused but little surprise.
They had scarcely any friends, and it was always conjectured that people so peculiar would
ultimately find their way to London.  They were particularly desirous to conceal their movements,
and therefore determined to warehouse their furniture in town, to take furnished apartments
there for three months, and then to move elsewhere.  Any letters which might arrive at Fenmarket
for them during these three months would be sent to them at their new address; nothing probably
would come afterwards, and as nobody in Fenmarket would care to take any trouble about them,
their trace would become obliterated.  They found some rooms near Myddelton Square, Pentonville,
not a particularly cheerful place, but they wished to avoid a more distant suburb, and Pentonville
was cheap. Fortunately for them they had no difficulty whatever in getting rid of the Fenmarket
house for the remainder of their term.

For a little while London diverted them after a fashion, but the absence of household cares
told upon them.  They had nothing to do but to read and to take dismal walks through Islington
and Barnsbury, and the gloom of the outlook thickened as the days became shorter and the smoke
began to darken the air.  Madge was naturally more oppressed than the others, not only by reason
of her temperament, but because she was the author of the trouble which had befallen them.
Her mother and Clara did everything to sustain and to cheer her. They possessed the rare virtue
of continuous tenderness.  The love, which with many is an inspiration, was with them their
own selves, from which they could not be separated; a harsh word could not therefore escape
from them.  It was as impossible as that there should be any failure in the pressure with which
the rocks press towards the earth's centre.  Madge at times was very far gone in melancholy.
How different this thing looked when it was close at hand; when she personally was to be the
victim!  She had read about it in history, the surface of which it seemed scarcely to ripple;
it had been turned to music in some of her favourite poems and had lent a charm to innumerable
mythologies, but the actual fact was nothing like the poetry or mythology, and threatened to
ruin her own history altogether.  Nor would it be her own history solely, but more or less
that of her mother and sister.

Had she believed in the common creed, her attention would have been concentrated on the salvation
of her own soul; she would have found her Redeemer and would have been comparatively at peace;
she would have acknowledged herself convicted of infinite sin, and hell would have been opened
before her, but above the sin and the hell she would have seen the distinct image of the Mediator
abolishing both. Popular theology makes personal salvation of such immense importance that,
in comparison therewith, we lose sight of the consequences to others of our misdeeds.  The
sense of cruel injustice to those who loved her remained with Madge perpetually.

To obtain relief she often went out of London for the day; sometimes her mother and sister
went with her; sometimes she insisted on going alone.  One autumn morning, she found herself
at Letherhead, the longest trip she had undertaken, for there were scarcely any railways then.
She wandered about till she discovered a footpath which took her to a mill-pond, which spread
itself out into a little lake.  It was fed by springs which burst up through the ground.  She
watched at one particular point, and saw the water boil up with such force that it cleared
a space of a dozen yards in diameter from every weed, and formed a transparent pool just tinted
with that pale azure which is peculiar to the living fountains which break out from the bottom
of the chalk.  She was fascinated for a moment by the spectacle, and reflected upon it, but
she passed on.  In about three-quarters of an hour she found herself near a church, larger
than an ordinary village church, and, as she was tired, and the gate of the church porch was
open, she entered and sat down.  The sun streamed in upon her, and some sheep which had strayed
into the churchyard from the adjoining open field came almost close to her, unalarmed, and
looked in her face.  The quiet was complete, and the air so still, that a yellow leaf dropping
here and there from the churchyard elms--just beginning to turn--fell quiveringly in a straight
path to the earth.  Sick at heart and despairing, she could not help being touched, and she
thought to herself how strange the world is--so transcendent both in glory and horror; a world
capable of such scenes as those before her, and a world in which such suffering as hers could
be; a world infinite both ways.  The porch gate was open because the organist was about to
practise, and in another instant she was listening to the Kyrie from Beethoven's Mass in C.
She knew it; Frank had tried to give her some notion of it on the piano, and since she had
been in London she had heard it at St Mary's, Moorfields.  She broke down and wept, but there
was something new in her sorrow, and it seemed as if a certain Pity overshadowed her.

She had barely recovered herself when she saw a woman, apparently about fifty, coming towards
her with a wicker basket on her arm.  She sat down beside Madge, put her basket on the ground,
and wiped her face with her apron.

'Marnin' miss! its rayther hot walkin', isn't it?  I've come all the way from Darkin, and I'm
goin' to Great Oakhurst.  That's a longish step there and back again; not that this is the
nearest way, but I don't like climbing them hills, and then when I get to Letherhead I shall
have a lift in a cart.'

Madge felt bound to say something as the sunburnt face looked kind and motherly.

'I suppose you live at Great Oakhurst?'

'Yes.  I do:  my husband, God bless him! he was a kind of foreman at The Towers, and when he
died I was left alone and didn't know what to be at, as both my daughters were out and one
married; so I took the general shop at Great Oakhurst, as Longwood used to have, but it don't
pay for I ain't used to it, and the house is too big for me, and there isn't nobody proper
to mind it when I goes over to Darkin for anything.'

'Are you going to leave?'

'Well, I don't quite know yet, miss, but I thinks I shall live with my daughter in London.
She's married a cabinetmaker in Great Ormond Street:  they let lodgings, too.  Maybe you know
that part?'

'No, I do not.'

'You don't live in London, then?'

'Yes, I do.  I came from London this morning.'

'The Lord have mercy on us, did you though!  I suppose, then, you're a-visitin' here.  I know
most of the folk hereabouts.'

'No:  I am going back this afternoon.'

Her interrogator was puzzled and her curiosity stimulated.  Presently she looked in Madge's face.

'Ah! my poor dear, you'll excuse me, I don't mean to be forward, but I see you've been a-cryin':
there's somebody buried here.'

'No.'

That was all she could say.  The walk from Letherhead, and the excitement had been too much
for her and she fainted.  Mrs Caffyn, for that was her name, was used to fainting fits.  She
was often 'a bit faint' herself, and she instantly loosened Madge's gown, brought out some
smelling-salts and also a little bottle of brandy and water. Something suddenly struck her.
She took up Madge's hand:  there was no wedding ring on it.

Presently her patient recovered herself.

'Look you now, my dear; you aren't noways fit to go back to London to-day.  If you was my child
you shouldn't do it for all the gold in the Indies, no, nor you sha'n't now.  I shouldn't have
a wink of sleep this night if I let you go, and if anything were to happen to you it would
be me as 'ud have to answer for it.'

'But I must go; my mother and sister will not know what has become of me.'

'You leave that to me; I tell you again as you can't go.  I've been a mother myself, and I
haven't had children for nothing.  I was just a- goin' to send a little parcel up to my daughter
by the coach, and her husband's a-goin' to meet it.  She'd left something behind last week
when she was with me, and I thought I'd get a bit of fresh butter here for her and put along
with it.  They make better butter in the farm in the bottom there, than they do at Great Oakhurst.
A note inside now will get to your mother all right; you have a bit of something to eat and
drink here, and you'll be able to walk along of me just into Letherhead, and then you can ride
to Great Oakhurst; it's only about two miles, and you can stay there all night.'

Madge was greatly touched; she took Mrs Caffyn's hands in hers, pressed them both and consented.
She was very weary, and the stamp on Mrs Caffyn's countenance was indubitable; it was evidently
no forgery, but of royal mintage.  They walked slowly to Letherhead, and there they found the
carrier's cart, which took them to Great Oakhurst.

CHAPTER XII

Mrs Caffyn's house was a roomy old cottage near the church, with a bow-window in which were
displayed bottles of 'suckers,' and of Day & Martin's blacking, cotton stuffs, a bag of nuts
and some mugs, cups and saucers.  Inside were salt butter, washing-blue, drapery, treacle,
starch, tea, tobacco and snuff, cheese, matches, bacon, and a few drugs, such as black draught,
magnesia, pills, sulphur, dill- water, Dalby's Carminative, and steel-drops.  There was also
a small stock of writing-paper, string and tin ware.  A boy was behind the counter.  When Mrs
Caffyn was out he always asked the customers who desired any article, the sale of which was
in any degree an art, to call again when she returned.  He went as far as those things which
were put up in packets, such as what were called 'grits' for making gruel, and he was also
authorised to venture on pennyworths of liquorice and peppermints, but the sale of half-a-dozen
yards of cotton print was as much above him as the negotiation of a treaty of peace would be
to a messenger in the Foreign Office.  In fact, nobody, excepting children, went into the shop
when Mrs Caffyn was not to be seen there, and, if she had to go to Dorking or Letherhead on
business, she always chose the middle of the day, when the folk were busy at their homes or
in the fields.  Poor woman! she was much tried.  Half the people who dealt with her were in
her debt, but she could not press them for her money.  During winter-time they were discharged
by the score from their farms, but as they were not sufficiently philosophic, or sufficiently
considerate for their fellows to hang or drown themselves, they were obliged to consume food,
and to wear clothes, for which they tried to pay by instalments during spring, summer and autumn.
Mrs Caffyn managed to make both ends meet by the help of two or three pigs, by great economy,
and by letting some of her superfluous rooms.  Great Oakhurst was not a show place nor a Spa,
but the Letherhead doctor had once recommended her to a physician in London, who occasionally
sent her a patient who wanted nothing but rest and fresh air.  She also, during the shooting-season,
was often asked to find a bedroom for visitors to The Towers.

She might have done better had she been on thoroughly good terms with the parson.  She attended
church on Sunday morning with tolerable regularity.  She never went inside a dissenting chapel,
and was not heretical on any definite theological point, but the rector and she were not friends.
She had lived in Surrey ever since she was a child, but she was not Surrey born.  Both her
father and mother came from the north country, and migrated southwards when she was very young.
They were better educated than the southerners amongst whom they came; and although their daughter
had no schooling beyond what was obtainable in a Surrey village of that time, she was distinguished
by a certain superiority which she had inherited or acquired from her parents.  She was never
subservient to the rector after the fashion of her neighbours; she never curtsied to him, and
if he passed and nodded she said 'Marnin', sir,' in just the same tone as that in which she
said it to the smallest of the Great Oakhurst farmers.  Her church-going was an official duty
incumbent upon her as the proprietor of the only shop in the parish.  She had nothing to do
with church matters except on Sunday, and she even went so far as to neglect to send for the
rector when one of her children lay dying.  She was attacked for the omission, but she defended
herself.

'What was the use when the poor dear was only seven year old?  What call was there for him
to come to a blessed innocent like that?  I did tell him to look in when my husband was took,
for I know as before we were married there was something atween him and that gal Sanders. 
He never would own up to me about it, and I thought as he might to a clergyman, and, if he
did, it would ease his mind and make it a bit better for him afterwards; but, Lord! it warn't
no use, for he went off and we didn't so much as hear her name, not even when he was a-wandering.
I says to myself when the parson left, "What's the good of having you?"'

Mrs Caffyn was a Christian, but she was a disciple of St James rather than of St Paul.  She
believed, of course, the doctrines of the Catechism, in the sense that she denied none, and
would have assented to all if she had been questioned thereon; but her belief that 'faith,
if it hath not works, is dead, being alone,' was something very vivid and very practical.

Her estimate, too, of the relative values of the virtues and of the relative sinfulness of
sins was original, and the rector therefore told all his parishioners that she was little better
than a heathen. The common failings in that part of the country amongst the poor were Saturday-night
drunkenness and looseness in the relations between the young men and young women.  Mrs Caffyn's
indignation never rose to the correct boiling point against these crimes.  The rector once
ventured to say, as the case was next door to her, -

'It is very sad, is it not, Mrs Caffyn, that Polesden should be so addicted to drink.  I hope
he did not disturb you last Saturday night.  I have given the constable directions to look
after the street more closely on Saturday evening, and if Polesden again offends he must be
taken up.'

Mrs Caffyn was behind her own counter.  She had just served a customer with two ounces of Dutch
cheese, and she sat down on her stool.  Being rather a heavy woman she always sat down when
she was not busy, and she never rose merely to talk.

'Yes, it is sad, sir, and Polesden isn't no particular friend of mine, but I tell you what's
sad too, sir, and that's the way them people are mucked up in that cottage.  Why, their living
room opens straight on the road, and the wind comes in fit to blow your head off, and when
he goes home o' nights, there's them children a- squalling, and he can't bide there and do
nothing.'

'I am afraid, though, Mrs Caffyn, there must be something radically wrong with that family.
I suppose you know all about the eldest daughter?'

'Yes, sir, I HAVE heard it:  it wouldn't be Great Oakhurst if I hadn't, but p'r'aps, sir, you've
never been upstairs in that house, and yet a house it isn't.  There's just two sleeping-rooms,
that's all; it's shameful, it isn't decent.  Well, that gal, she goes away to service.  Maybe,
sir, them premises at the farm are also unbeknown to you.  In the back kitchen there's a broadish
sort of shelf as Jim climbs into o' nights, and it has a rail round it to keep you from a-
falling out, and there's a ladder as they draws up in the day as goes straight up from that
kitchen to the gal's bedroom door.  It's downright disgraceful, and I don't believe the Lord
A'mighty would be marciful to neither of US if we was tried like that.'

Mrs Caffyn bethought herself of the 'us' and was afraid that even she had gone a little too
far; 'leastways, speaking for myself, sir,' she added.

The rector turned rather red, and repented his attempt to enlist Mrs Caffyn.

'If the temptations are so great, Mrs Caffyn, that is all the more reason why those who are
liable to them should seek the means which are provided in order that they may be overcome.
I believe the Polesdens are very lax attendants at church, and I don't think they ever communicated.'

Mrs Polesden at that moment came in for an ounce of tea, and as Mrs Caffyn rose to weigh it,
the rector departed with a stiff 'good- morning,' made to do duty for both women.

CHAPTER XIII

Mrs Caffyn persuaded Madge to go to bed at once, after giving her 'something to comfort her.'
In the morning her kind hostess came to her bedside.

'You've got a mother, haven't you--leastways, I know you have, because you wrote to her.'

'Yes.'

'Well, and you lives with her and she looks after you?'

'Yes.'

'And she's fond of you, maybe?'

'Oh, yes.'

'That's a marcy; well then, my dear, you shall go back in the cart to Letherhead, and you'll
catch the Darkin coach to London.'

'You have been very good to me; what have I to pay you?'

'Pay?  Nothing! why, if I was to let you pay, it would just look as if I'd trapped you here
to get something out of you.  Pay! no, not a penny.'

'I can afford very well to pay, but if it vexes you I will not offer anything.  I don't know
how to thank you enough.'

Madge took Mrs Caffyn's hand in hers and pressed it firmly.

'Besides, my dear,' said Mrs Caffyn, smoothing the sheets a little, 'you won't mind my saying
it, I expex you are in trouble.  There's something on your mind, and I believe as I knows pretty
well what it is.'

Madge turned round in the bed so as no longer to face the light; Mrs Caffyn sat between her
and the window.

'Look you here, my dear; don't you suppose I meant to say anything to hurt you.  The moment
I looked on you I was drawed to you like; I couldn't help it.  I see'd what was the matter,
but I was all the more drawed, and I just wanted you to know as it makes no difference. That's
like me; sometimes I'm drawed that way and sometimes t'other way, and it's never no use for
me to try to go against it.  I ain't a-going to say anything more to you; God-A'mighty, He's
above us all; but p'r'aps you may be comm' this way again some day, and then you'll look in.'

Madge turned again to the light, and again caught Mrs Caffyn's hand, but was silent.

The next morning, after Madge's return, Mrs Cork, the landlady, presented herself at the sitting-room
door and 'wished to speak with Mrs Hopgood for a minute.'

'Come in, Mrs Cork.'

'Thank you, ma'am, but I prefer as you should come downstairs.'

Mrs Cork was about forty, a widow with no children.  She had a face of which it was impossible
to recollect, when it had been seen even a dozen times, any feature except the eyes, which
were steel-blue, a little bluer than the faceted head of the steel poker in her parlour, but
just as hard.  She lived in the basement with a maid, much like herself but a little more human.
Although the front underground room was furnished Mrs Cork never used it, except on the rarest
occasions, and a kind of apron of coloured paper hung over the fireplace nearly all the year.
She was a woman of what she called regular habits.  No lodger was ever permitted to transgress
her rules, or to have meals ten minutes before or ten minutes after the appointed time.  She
had undoubtedly been married, but who Cork could have been was a marvel. Why he died, and why
there were never any children were no marvels. At two o'clock her grate was screwed up to the
narrowest possible dimensions, and the ashes, potato peelings, tea leaves and cabbage stalks
were thrown on the poor, struggling coals.  No meat, by the way, was ever roasted--it was considered
wasteful--everything was baked or boiled.  After half-past four not a bit of anything that
was not cold was allowed till the next morning, and, indeed, from the first of April to the
thirty-first of October the fire was raked out the moment tea was over.  Mrs Hopgood one night
was not very well and Clara wished to give her mother something warm.  She rang the bell and
asked for hot water.  Maria came up and disappeared without a word after receiving the message.
Presently she returned.

'Mrs Cork, miss, wishes me to tell you as it was never understood as 'ot water would be required
after tea, and she hasn't got any.'

Mrs Hopgood had a fire, although it was not yet the thirty-first of October, for it was very
damp and raw.  She had with much difficulty induced Mrs Cork to concede this favour (which
probably would not have been granted if the coals had not yielded a profit of threepence a
scuttleful), and Clara, therefore, asked if she could not have the kettle upstairs.  Again
Maria disappeared and returned.

'Mrs Cork says, miss, as it's very ill-convenient as the kettle is cleaned up agin to-morrow,
and if you can do without it she will be obliged.'

It was of no use to continue the contest, and Clara bethought herself of a little 'Etna' she
had in her bedroom.  She went to the druggist's, bought some methylated spirit, and obtained
what she wanted.

Mrs Cork had one virtue and one weakness.  Her virtue was cleanliness, but she persecuted the
'blacks,' not because she objected to dirt as dirt, but because it was unauthorised, appeared
without permission at irregular hours, and because the glittering polish on varnished paint
and red mahogany was a pleasure to her. She liked the dirt, too, in a way, for she enjoyed
the exercise of her ill-temper on it and the pursuit of it to destruction.  Her weakness was
an enormous tom-cat which had a bell round its neck and slept in a basket in the kitchen, the
best-behaved and most moral cat in the parish.  At half-past nine every evening it was let
out into the back-yard and vanished.  At ten precisely it was heard to mew and was immediately
admitted.  Not once in a twelvemonth did that cat prolong its love making after five minutes
to ten.

Mrs Hopgood went upstairs to her room, Mrs Cork following and closing the door.

'If you please, ma'am, I wish to give you notice to leave this day week.'

'What is the matter, Mrs Cork?'

'Well, ma'am, for one thing, I didn't know as you'd bring a bird with you.'

It was a pet bird belonging to Madge.

'But what harm does the bird do?  It gives no trouble; my daughter attends to it.'

'Yes, ma'am, but it worrits my Joseph--the cat, I mean.  I found him the other mornin' on the
table eyin' it, and I can't a-bear to see him urritated.'

'I should hardly have thought that a reason for parting with good lodgers.'

Mrs Hopgood had intended to move, as before explained, but she did not wish to go till the
three months had expired.

'I don't say as that is everything, but if you wish me to tell you the truth, Miss Madge is
not a person as I like to keep in the house. I wish you to know'--Mrs Cork suddenly became
excited and venomous-- 'that I'm a respectable woman, and have always let my apartments to
respectable people, and do you think I should ever let them to respectable people again if
it got about as I had had anybody as wasn't respectable? But the spies of Chalco Chima saw everything
without being seen themselves and gave notice to Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz. Chalco Chima then
divided his men into two parts and stationed them at the sides of the road where the orejones
would pass. When Tupac Atao came onwards, they attacked him to such purpose that scarcely any one
escaped, Tupac Atao himself was taken, badly wounded, by whom Chalco
Chima was informed that Huascar would follow him with only a squadron
of 5000 men, while the rest of his army remained in Huanacu-pampa.

Chalco Chima sent this information to Quiz-quiz, who was at a little distance, that they might
unite forces. He told him that Tupac Atao was taken, that Huascar was expected with a small
force, and that Quiz-quiz was wanted that both might take this enemy on the flanks. This was
done. They divided their forces, placing them on both sides as in the attack on Tupac Atao. A short
time after they entered the ravine, Huascar and his men came upon the dead bodies of the men of
Tupac Atao who, being known to Huascar he wished to turn back, understanding that they were
all dead and that there must have been some ambush. But it was too late, for he was surrounded
by his enemies. Then he was attacked by the troops of Chalco Chima.

When he tried to fly from those who fell upon his rear, he fell into the hands of Quiz-quiz who was
waiting for him lower down. Those of Chalco Chima and those of Quiz-quiz fought with great ferocity,
sparing none, and killing them all. Chalco Chima, searching for Huascar, saw him in his litter
and seized him by the hands, and pulled him out of his litter. Thus was taken prisoner the unfortunate
Huascar Inca, twelfth and last tyrant of the Inca Sovereigns of Peru, falling into the power
of another greater and more cruel tyrant than himself, his people defeated, killed, and scattered.

Placing
Huascar in safe durance with a sufficient guard, Chalco Chima went
on in the Inca's litter and detached 5000 of his men to advance towards
the other troops remaining on the plain of Huanacu-pampa.

He ordered that all the rest should follow Quiz-quiz, and that when
he let fall the screen, they should attack.

He executed this stratagem because his enemies thought that he was Huascar returning victorious,
so they waited. He advanced and arrived where the troops of Huascar were waiting for their lord,
who, when they saw him, still thought that it was Huascar bringing his enemies as prisoners.
When Chalco Chima was quite near, he let loose a prisoner who had been wounded, who went to the
Inca troops. He told them what had happened, that it was Chalco Chima, and that he could kill
them all by this stratagem. When this was known, and that Chalco Chima would presently order them
to be attacked with his whole force, for he had let the screen fall, which was to be the sign,
the Inca troops gave way and took to flight, which was what Chalco Chima intended. The troops
of Atahualpa pursued, wounding and killing with excessive cruelty and ferocity, continuing the slaughter,
with unheard of havock, as far as the bridge of Cotabamba. As the bridge was narrow and all
could not cross it, many jumped into the water from fear of their ferocious pursuers, and were drowned.
The troops of Atahualpa crossed the river, continuing the pursuit and rejoicing in their victory.
During the pursuit they captured Titu Atauchi, the brother of Huascar. Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz
arrived at some houses called Quiuipay, about half a league from Cuzco, where they placed Huascar as a
prisoner with a sufficient guard. Here they encamped and established their head-quarters.

The soldiers of Chalco Chima went to get a view of Cuzco from the hill of Yauina overlooking
the city, where they heard the mourning and lamentation of the inhabitants, and returned to
inform Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz. Those captains sent a messenger to Cuzco to tell the inhabitants
not to mourn, for that there was nothing to fear, it being well known that this was a war between
two brothers for the gratification of their own passions. If any of them had helped Huascar
they had not committed a crime, for they were bound to serve their Inca; and if there was any
fault he would remit and pardon it, in the name of the great Lord Atahualpa. Presently he would
order them all to come out and do reverence to the statue of Atahualpa, called Ticci Ccapac which
means "Lord of the World."

The people of Cuzco consulted together, and resolved to come forth and obey the commands of
Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz.

They came according to their ayllus and, on arriving at Quiuipay, they seated themselves in
that order. Presently the troops of Atahualpa, fully armed, surrounded all those who had come
from Cuzco. They took Huanca Auqui, Ahua Panti, and Paucar Usna, who had led the army against
them in the battle at Tumipampa. Then they took Apu Chalco Yupanqui and Rupaca, Priests of the
Sun, because these had given the fringe to Huascar. These being prisoners Quiz-quiz rose and
said--"Now you know of the battles you have fought with me on the road, and the trouble you have
caused me. You always raised Huascar to be Inca, who was not the heir. You treated evilly the
Inca Atahualpa whom the Sun guards, and for these things you deserve death. But using you with
humanity, I pardon you in the name of my Lord Atahualpa, whom may the Sun prosper."

But that they might not be without any punishment, he ordered them to be given some blows with
a great stone on the shoulders, and he killed the most culpable. Then he ordered that all
should be tied by the knees, with their faces towards Caxamarca or Huamachuco where Atahualpa
was, and he made them pull out their eyelashes and eyebrows as an offering to the new Inca.
All the orejones, inhabitants of Cuzco, did this from fear, saying in a loud voice, "Long live!
Live for many years Atahualpa our Inca, may our father the Sun increase his life!"

Araua Ocllo, the mother of Huascar, and his wife Chucuy Huypa, were there, and were dishonoured
and abused by Quiz-quiz. In a loud voice the mother of Huascar said to her son, who was a prisoner,
"O unfortunate! thy cruelties and evil deeds have brought you to this state. Did I not tell you
not to be so cruel, and not to kill nor ill-treat the messengers of your brother Atahualpa." Having
said these words she came to him, and gave him a blow in the face.

Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz then sent a messenger to Atahualpa, letting him know all that had
happened, and that they had made prisoners of Huascar and many others, and asking for further
orders.

After Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz had sent off the messengers to Atahualpa, they caused the
prisoners to be brought before them, and in the presence of all, and of the mother and wife of
Huascar, they declared, addressing themselves to the mother of Huascar,
that she was the concubine and not the wife of Huayna Ccapac, and
that, being his concubine, she had borne Huascar, also that she was
a vile woman and not a Coya.

The troops of Atahualpa raised a shout of derision, and some said to the orejones, pointing
their fingers at Huascar--"Look there at your lord! who said that in the battle he would turn
fire and water against his enemies?" Huascar was then tied hand and foot on a bed of ropes of straws.
The orejones, from shame, lowered their heads. Presently Quiz-quiz asked Huascar, "Who of these
made you lord, there being others better and more valiant than you, who might have been chosen?"
Araua Ocllo, speaking to her son, said, "You deserve all this my son as I told you, and all comes from
the cruelty with which you treated your own relations." Huascar replied, "Mother! there is now
no remedy, leave us," and he addressed himself to the priest Chalco
Yupanqui, saying--"Speak and answer the question asked by Quiz-quiz."

The priest said to Quiz-quiz, "I raised him to be lord and Inca by command of his father Huayna
Ccapac, and because he was son of a Coya" (which is what we should call Infanta). Then Chalco Chima
was indignant, and called the priest a deceiver and a liar. Huascar answered to Quiz-quiz,
"Leave off these arguments.

This is a question between me and my brother, and not between the parties of Hanan-cuzco and
Hurin-cuzco. We will investigate it, and you have no business to meddle between us on this
point."

Enraged at the answer Chalco Chima ordered Huascar to be taken back to prison, and said to the Incas,
to re-assure them, that they could now go back to the city as they were pardoned. The orejones
returned, invoking Viracocha in loud voices with these words--"O Creator! thou who givest life
and favour to the Incas where art thou now? Why dost thou allow such persecution to come upon
us? Wherefore didst thou exalt us, if we are to come to such an end?" Saying these words they
beat their cloaks in token of the curse that had come upon them all.

When Atahualpa knew what had happened, from the messengers of Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz, he ordered
one of his relations named Cusi Yupanqui to go to Cuzco, and not to leave a relation or friend of Huascar
alive. This Cusi Yupanqui arrived at Cuzco, and Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz delivered the prisoners
to him. He made inquiries touching all that Atahualpa had ordered. He then caused poles to be
fixed on both sides of the road, extending not more than a quarter of a league along the way
to Xaquixahuana. Next he brought out of the prison all the wives
of Huascar, including those pregnant or lately delivered.

He ordered them to be hung to these poles with their children, and he ordered the pregnant
to be cut open, and the stillborn to be hung with them.

Then he caused the sons of Huascar to be brought out and hung to
the poles.

Among the sons of Huayna Ccapac who were prisoners there was one named Paullu Tupac. When they were
going to kill him, he protested saying, it was unreasonable that he should be killed, because
he had previously been imprisoned by Huascar; and on this ground he was released and escaped
death. Yet the reason that he was imprisoned by Huascar was because he had been found with
one of the Inca's wives. He was only given very little to eat, the
intention being that he should die in prison.

The woman with whom he was taken was buried alive. The wars coming on he escaped, and what has
been related took place.

After this the lords and ladies of Cuzco who were found to have been friends of Huascar were
seized and hanged on the poles. Then there was an examination of all the houses of deceased
Incas, to see which had been on the side of Huascar, and against Atahualpa. They found that
the house of Tupac Inca Yupanqui had sided with Huascar. Cusi Yupanqui committed the punishment
of the house to Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz. They seized the steward of the house, and the
mummy of Tupac Inca, and those of his family and hung them all, and
they burnt the body of Tupac Inca outside the town and reduced it
to ashes.

And to destroy the house completely, they killed many mama cunas and servants, so that none were
left of that house except a few of no account. Besides this they ordered all the Chachapoyas
and Cañaris to be killed, and their Curaca named Ulco Colla, who they said had rebelled against
the two brothers.

All these murders and cruelties were perpetrated in the presence of Huascar to torment him. They
murdered over 80 sons and daughters of Huascar, and what he felt most cruelly was the murder,
before his eyes, of one of his sisters named Coya Miro, who had a son of Huascar in her arms,
and another in her womb; and another very beautiful sister named Chimbo Cisa. Breaking his heart
at the sight of such cruelty and grief which he was powerless to prevent, he cried, with a
sigh, "Oh Pachayachachi Viracocha, thou who showed favour to me for so short a time, and honoured
me and gave me life, dost thou see that I am treated in this way, and seest thou in thy presence
what I, in mine, have seen and see."

Some of the concubines of Huascar escaped from this cruelty and calamity,
because they had neither borne a child nor were pregnant, and because
they were beautiful.

They say that they were kept to be taken to Atahualpa. Among those who escaped were Doña Elvira
Chonay, daughter of Cañar Ccapac, Doña Beatriz Carnamaruay, daughter
of the Curaca of Chinchay-cocha, Doña Juana Tocto, Doña Catalina Usica,
wife, that was, of Don Paullu Tupac, and mother of Don Carlos, who
are living now.

In this way the line and lineage of the unfortunate tyrant Huascar,
the last of the Incas, was completely annihilated.

LXVIII.

NEWS OF THE SPANIARDS COMES TO ATAHUALPA.

Atahualpa was at Huamachuco celebrating great festivals for his victories,
and he wished to proceed to Cuzco and assume the fringe in the House
of the Sun, where all former Incas had received it When he was about
to set out there came to him two Tallanas Indians, sent by the Curacas
of Payta and Tumbez, to report to him that there had arrived by sea,
which they call cocha, a people with different clothing, and with
beards, and that they brought animals like large sheep.

The chief of them was believed to be Viracocha, which means the god
of these people, and he brought with him many Viracochas, which is
as much as to say "gods."

They said this of the Governor Don Francisco Pizarro, who had arrived with 180 men and some horses
which they called sheep.

As the account in detail is left for the history of the Spaniards,
which will form the Third Part to come after this, I will only here
speak briefly of what passed between the Spaniards and Atahualpa.

When this became known to Atahualpa he rejoiced greatly, believing it to be the Viracocha coming,
as he had promised when he departed, and as is recounted in the beginning
of this history.

Atahualpa gave thanks that he should have come in his time, and he sent back the messengers
with thanks to the Curacas for sending the news, and ordering them
to keep him informed of what might happen.

He resolved not to go to Cuzco until he had seen what this arrival
was, and what the Viracochas intended to do.

He sent orders to Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz to lose no time in bringing Huascar to Caxamarca,
where he would go to await their arrival, for he had received news
that certain Viracochas had arrived by sea, and he wished to be there
to see what they were like.

As no further news came, because the Spaniards were forming a station
at Tangarara, Atahualpa became careless and believed that they had
gone.

For, at another time, when he was marching with his father, in the wars of Quito, news came to Huayna
Ccapac that the Viracocha had arrived on the coast near Tumbez, and then they had gone away.
This was when Don Francisco Pizarro came on the first discovery,
and returned to Spain for a concession, as will be explained in its
place.

As the subject of which this chapter treats belongs to the Third Part (the history of the Spaniards),
I shall here only give a summary of what happened to Atahualpa. Although Atahualpa was careless
about the Spaniards they did not miss a point, and when they heard where Atahualpa was, they
left Tangarara and arrived at Caxamarca. When Atahualpa knew that the Viracochas were near,
he left Caxamarca and went to some baths at a distance of half a
league that he might, from there, take the course which seemed best.

As he found that they were not gods as he had been made to think at first, he prepared his warriors
to resist the Spaniards. Finally he was taken prisoner by Don Francisco Pizarro, the Friar, Vicente
Valverde, having first made a certain demand, in the square of Caxamarca.

Don Francisco Pizarro knew of the disputes there had been between Atahualpa and Huascar, and that
Huascar was a prisoner in the hands of the captains of Atahualpa, and he urged Atahualpa to have
his brother brought as quickly as possible. Huascar was being brought to Caxamarca by Atahualpa's order,
as has already been said. Chalco Chima obeying this order, set out with Huascar and the captains
and relations who had escaped the butchery of Cusi Yupanqui. Atahualpa asked Don Francisco Pizarro
why he wanted to see his brother.

Pizarro replied that he had been informed that Huascar was the elder
and principal Lord of that land and for that reason he wished to see
him, and he desired that he should come.

Atahualpa feared that if Huascar came alive, the Governor Don Francisco Pizarro would be informed
of what had taken place, that Huascar would be made Lord, and that he would lose his state. Being
sagacious, he agreed to comply with Pizarro's demand, but sent off a messenger to the captain
who was bringing Huascar, with an order to kill him and all the prisoners. The messenger started
and found Huascar at Antamarca, near Yana-mayu. He gave his message to the captain of the guard
who was bringing Huascar as a prisoner.

Directly the captain heard the order of Atahualpa he complied with it.

He killed Huascar, cut the body up, and threw it into the river Yana-mayu.

He also killed the rest of the brothers, relations, and captains who
were with him as prisoners, in the year 1533.

Huascar had lived 40 years. He succeeded his father at the age of 31 and reigned for 9 years.
His wife was Chucuy Huypa by whom he had no male child.

He left no lineage or ayllu, and of those who are now living, one
only, named Don Alonso Titu Atauchi is a nephew of Huascar, son of
Titu Atauchi who was murdered with Huascar.

He alone sustains the name of the lineage of Huascar called the Huascar Ayllu. In this river of
Yana-mayu Atahualpa had fixed his boundary pillars when he first rebelled, saying that from
thence to Chile should be for his brother Huascar, and from the Yana-mayu onwards should be his.
Thus with the death of Huascar there was an end to all the Incas of Peru and all their line and
descent which they held to be legitimate, without leaving man or woman who could have a claim
on this country, supposing them to have been natural and legitimate lords of it, in conformity
with their own customs and tyrannical laws.

For this murder of Huascar, and for other good and sufficient causes, the Governor Don Francisco
Pizarro afterwards put Atahualpa to death. He was a tyrant against the natives of this country
and against his brother Huascar. He had lived 36 years. He was not Inca of Peru, but a tyrant.
He was prudent, sagacious, and valiant, as I shall relate in the Third Part, being events which
belong to the deeds of the Spaniards.

It suffices to close this Second Part by completing the history of the deeds of the 12 Inca tyrants
who reigned in this kingdom of Peru from Manco Ccapac the first to
Huascar the twelfth and last tyrant.

IT IS NOTEWORTHY HOW THESE
INCAS WERE TYRANTS AGAINST THEMSELVES, BESIDES BEING SO AGAINST THE
NATIVES OF THE LAND.  He walked
with her down the churchyard path to her carriage, assisted her into it, saluted her father
and mother, and then went home with his own people.

The evening came, he sang with Cecilia, and it was observed, and he himself observed it, how
completely their voices harmonised.  He was not without a competitor, a handsome young baritone,
who was much commended.  When he came to the end of his performance everybody said what a pity
it was that the following duet could not also be given, a duet which Cecilia knew perfectly
well.  She was very much pressed to take her part with him, but she steadily refused, on the
ground that she had not practised it, that she had already sung once, and that she was engaged
to sing once more with her cousin.  Frank was sitting next to her, and she added, so as to
be heard by him alone, 'He is no particular favourite of mine.'

There was no direct implication that Frank was a favourite, but an inference was possible,
and at least it was clear that she preferred to reserve herself for him.  Cecilia's gifts,
her fortune, and her gay, happy face had made many a young fellow restless, and had brought
several proposals, none of which had been accepted.  All this Frank knew, and how could he
repress something more than satisfaction when he thought that perhaps he might have been the
reason why nobody as yet had been able to win her.  She always called him Frank, for although
they were not first cousins, they were cousins.  He generally called her Cecilia, but she was
Cissy in her own house.  He was hardly close enough to venture upon the more familiar nickname,
but to-night, as they rose to go to the piano, he said, and the baritone sat next to her, -

'Now, CISSY, once more.'

She looked at him with just a little start of surprise, and a smile spread itself over her
face.  After they had finished, and she never sang better, the baritone noticed that she seemed
indisposed to return to her former place, and she retired with Frank to the opposite corner
of the room.

'I wonder,' she said, 'if being happy in a thing is a sign of being born to do it.  If it is,
I am born to be a musician.'

'I should say it is; if two people are quite happy in one another's company, it is as a sign
they were born for one another.'

'Yes, if they are sure they are happy.  It is easier for me to be sure that I am happier with
a thing than with a person.'

'Do you think so?  Why?'

'There is the uncertainty whether the person is happy with me.  I cannot be altogether happy
with anybody unless I know I make him happy.'

'What kind of person is he with whom you COULD be without making him happy?'

The baritone rose to the upper F with a clash of chords on the piano, and the company broke
up.  Frank went home with but one thought in his head--the thought of Cecilia.

His bedroom faced the south-west, its windows were open, and when he entered, the wind, which
was gradually rising, struck him on the face and nearly forced the door out of his hand; the
fire in his blood was quenched, and the image of Cecilia receded.  He looked out, and saw reflected
on the low clouds the dull glare of the distant city.  Just over there was Great Ormond Street,
and underneath that dim, red light, like the light of a great house burning, was Madge Hopgood.
He lay down, turning over from side to side in the vain hope that by change of position he
might sleep.  After about an hour's feverish tossing, he just lost himself, but not in that
oblivion which slumber usually brought him.  He was so far awake that he saw what was around
him, and yet, he was so far released from the control of his reason that he did not recognise
what he saw, and it became part of a new scene created by his delirium.  The full moon, clearing
away the clouds as she moved upwards, had now passed round to the south, and just caught the
white window-curtain farthest from him.  He half- opened his eyes, his mad dream still clung
to him, and there was the dead Madge before him, pale in death, and holding a child in her
arms!  He distinctly heard himself scream as he started up in affright; he could not tell where
he was; the spectre faded and the furniture and hangings transformed themselves into their
familiar reality.  He could not lie down again, and rose and dressed himself. He was not the
man to believe that the ghost could be a revelation or a prophecy, but, nevertheless, he was
once more overcome with fear, a vague dread partly justifiable by the fact of Madge, by the
fact that his father might soon know what had happened, that others also might know, Cecilia
for example, but partly also a fear going beyond all the facts, and not to be accounted for
by them, a strange, horrible trembling such as men feel in earthquakes when the solid rock
shakes, on which everything rests.

CHAPTER XVII

When Frank came downstairs to breakfast the conversation turned upon his return to Germany.
He did not object to going, although it can hardly be said that he willed to go.  He was in
that perilous condition in which the comparison of reasons is impossible, and the course taken
depends upon some chance impulse of the moment, and is a mere drift.  He could not leave, however,
in complete ignorance of Madge, and with no certainty as to her future.  He resolved therefore
to make one more effort to discover the house.  That was all which he determined to do.  What
was to happen when he had found it, he did not know.  He was driven to do something, which
could not be of any importance, save for what must follow, but he was unable to bring himself
even to consider what was to follow.  He knew that at Fenmarket one or other of the sisters
went out soon after breakfast to make provision for the day, and perhaps, if they kept up this
custom, he might be successful in his search.  He accordingly stationed himself in Great Ormond
Street at about half-past nine, and kept watch from the Lamb's Conduit Street end, shifting
his position as well as he could, in order to escape notice.  He had not been there half an
hour when he saw a door open, and Madge came out and went westwards.  She turned down Devonshire
Street as if on her way to Holborn.  He instantly ran back to Theobalds Road, and when he came
to the corner of Devonshire Street she was about ten yards from him, and he faced her.  She
stopped irresolutely, as if she had a mind to return, but as he approached her, and she found
she was recognised, she came towards him.

'Madge, Madge,' he cried, 'I want to speak to you.  I must speak with you.'

'Better not; let me go.'

'I say I MUST speak to you.'

'We cannot talk here; let me go.'

'I must!  I must! come with me.'

She pitied him, and although she did not consent she did not refuse. He called a cab, and in
ten minutes, not a word having been spoken during those ten minutes, they were at St Paul's.
The morning service had just begun, and they sat down in a corner far away from the worshippers.

'Oh, Madge,' he began, 'I implore you to take me back.  I love you. I do love you, and--and--I
cannot leave you.'

She was side by side with the father of her child about to be born. He was not and could not
be as another man to her, and for the moment there was the danger lest she should mistake this
secret bond for love.  The thought of what had passed between them, and of the child, his and
hers, almost overpowered her.

'I cannot,' he repeated.  'I OUGHT not.  What will become of me?'

She felt herself stronger; he was excited, but his excitement was not contagious.  The string
vibrated, and the note was resonant, but it was not a note which was consonant with hers, and
it did not stir her to respond.  He might love her, he was sincere enough to sacrifice himself
for her, and to remain faithful to her, but the voice was not altogether that of his own true
self.  Partly, at least, it was the voice of what he considered to be duty, of superstition
and alarm. She was silent.

'Madge,' he continued, 'ought you to refuse?  You have some love for me.  Is it not greater
than the love which thousands feel for one another.  Will you blast your future and mine, and,
perhaps, that of someone besides, who may be very dear to you?  OUGHT you not, I say, to listen?'

The service had come to an end, the organist was playing a voluntary, rather longer than usual,
and the congregation was leaving, some of them passing near Madge and Frank, and casting idle
glances on the young couple who had evidently come neither to pray nor to admire the architecture.
Madge recognised the well-known St Ann's fugue, and, strange to say, even at such a moment
it took entire possession of her; the golden ladder was let down and celestial visitors descended.
When the music ceased she spoke.

'It would be a crime.'

'A crime, but I--'  She stopped him.

'I know what you are going to say.  I know what is the crime to the world; but it would have
been a crime, perhaps a worse crime, if a ceremony had been performed beforehand by a priest,
and the worst of crimes would be that ceremony now.  I must go.'  She rose and began to move
towards the door.

He walked silently by her side till they were in St Paul's churchyard, when she took him by
the hand, pressed it affectionately and suddenly turned into one of the courts that lead towards
Paternoster Row.  He did not follow her, something repelled him, and when he reached home it
crossed his mind that marriage, after such delay, would be a poor recompense, as he could not
thereby conceal her disgrace.

CHAPTER XVIII

It was clear that these two women could not live in London on seventy-five pounds a year, most
certainly not with the prospect before them, and Clara cast about for something to do.  Marshall
had a brother-in-law, a certain Baruch Cohen, a mathematical instrument maker in Clerkenwell,
and to him Marshall accidentally one day talked about Clara, and said that she desired an occupation.
Cohen himself could not give Clara any work, but he knew a second-hand bookseller, an old man
who kept a shop in Holborn, who wanted a clerk, and Clara thus found herself earning another
pound a week.  With this addition she and her sister could manage to pay their way and provide
what Madge would want.  The hours were long, the duties irksome and wearisome, and, worst of
all, the conditions under which they were performed, were not only as bad as they could be,
but their badness was of a kind to which Clara had never been accustomed, so that she felt
every particle of it in its full force.  The windows of the shop were, of course, full of books,
and the walls were lined with them. In the middle of the shop also was a range of shelves,
and books were stacked on the floor, so that the place looked like a huge cubical block of
them through which passages had been bored.  At the back the shop became contracted in width
to about eight feet, and consequently the central shelves were not continued there, but just
where they ended, and overshadowed by them were a little desk and a stool.  All round the desk
more books were piled, and some manoeuvring was necessary in order to sit down.  This was Clara's
station. Occasionally, on a brilliant, a very brilliant day in summer, she could write without
gas, but, perhaps, there were not a dozen such days in the year.  By twisting herself sideways
she could just catch a glimpse of a narrow line of sky over some heavy theology which was not
likely to be disturbed, and was therefore put at the top of the window, and once when somebody
bought the Calvin Joann.  Opera Omnia, 9 vol. folio, Amst. 1671--it was very clear that afternoon--she
actually descried towards seven o'clock a blessed star exactly in the middle of the gap the
Calvin had left.

The darkness was very depressing, and poor Clara often shut her eyes as she bent over her day-book
and ledger, and thought of the Fenmarket flats where the sun could be seen bisected by the
horizon at sun-rising and sun-setting, and where even the southern Antares shone with diamond
glitter close to the ground during summer nights. She tried to reason with herself during the
dreadful smoke fogs; she said to herself that they were only half-a-mile thick, and she carried
herself up in imagination and beheld the unclouded azure, the filthy smother lying all beneath
her, but her dream did not continue, and reality was too strong for her.  Worse, perhaps, than
the eternal gloom was the dirt.  She was naturally fastidious, and as her skin was thin and
sensitive, dust was physically a discomfort.  Even at Fenmarket she was continually washing
her hands and face, and, indeed, a wash was more necessary to her after a walk than food or
drink.  It was impossible to remain clean in Holborn for five minutes; everything she touched
was foul with grime; her collar and cuffs were black with it when she went home to her dinner,
and it was not like the honest, blowing road-sand of Fenmarket highways, but a loathsome composition
of everything disgusting which could be produced by millions of human beings and animals packed
together in soot.  It was a real misery to her and made her almost ill.  However, she managed
to set up for herself a little lavatory in the basement, and whenever she had a minute at her
command, she descended and enjoyed the luxury of a cool, dripping sponge and a piece of yellow
soap.  The smuts began to gather again the moment she went upstairs, but she strove to arm
herself with a little philosophy against them. 'What is there in life,' she moralised, smiling
at her sermonising, 'which once won is for ever won?  It is always being won and always being
lost.'  Her master, fortunately, was one of the kindest of men, an old gentleman of about sixty-five,
who wore a white necktie, clean every morning.  He was really a GENTLEman in the true sense
of that much misused word, and not a mere TRADESman; that is to say, he loved his business,
not altogether for the money it brought him, but as an art.  He was known far and wide, and
literary people were glad to gossip with him.  He never pushed his wares, and he hated to sell
them to anybody who did not know their value.  He amused Clara one afternoon when a carriage
stopped at the door, and a lady inquired if he had a Manning and Bray's History of Surrey.
Yes, he had a copy, and he pointed to the three handsome, tall folios.

'What is the price?'

'Twelve pounds ten.'

'I think I will have them.'

'Madam, you will pardon me, but, if I were you, I would not.  I think something much cheaper
will suit you better.  If you will allow me, I will look out for you and will report in a few
days.'

'Oh! very well,' and she departed.

'The wife of a brassfounder,' he said to Clara; 'made a lot of money, and now he has bought
a house at Dulwich and is setting up a library. Somebody has told him that he ought to have
a county history, and that Manning and Bray is the book.  Manning and Bray!  What he wants
is a Dulwich and Denmark Hill Directory.  No, no,' and he took down one of the big volumes,
blew the dust off the top edges and looked at the old book-plate inside, 'you won't go there
if I can help it.'  He took a fancy to Clara when he found she loved literature, although what
she read was out of his department altogether, and his perfectly human behaviour to her prevented
that sense of exile and loneliness which is so horrible to many a poor creature who comes up
to London to begin therein the struggle for existence.  She read and meditated a good deal
in the shop, but not to much profit, for she was continually interrupted, and the thought of
her sister intruded itself perpetually.

Madge seldom or never spoke of her separation from Frank, but one night, when she was somewhat
less reserved than usual, Clara ventured to ask her if she had heard from him since they parted.

'I met him once.'

'Madge, do you mean that he found out where we are living, and that he came to see you?'

'No, it was just round the corner as I was going towards Holborn.'

'Nothing could have brought him here but yourself,' said Clara, slowly.

'Clara, you doubt?'

'No, no!  I doubt you?  Never!'

'But you hesitate; you reflect.  Speak out.'

'God forbid I should utter a word which would induce you to disbelieve what you know to be
right.  It is much more important to believe earnestly that something is morally right than
that it should be really right, and he who attempts to displace a belief runs a certain risk,
because he is not sure that what he substitutes can be held with equal force.  Besides, each
person's belief, or proposed course of action, is a part of himself, and if he be diverted
from it and takes up with that which is not himself, the unity of his nature is impaired, and
he loses himself.'

'Which is as much as to say that the prophet is to break no idols.'

'You know I do not mean that, and you know, too, how incapable I am of defending myself in
argument.  I never can stand up for anything I say.  I can now and then say something, but,
when I have said it, I run away.'

'My dearest Clara,' Madge put her arm over her sister's shoulder as they sat side by side,
'do not run away now; tell me just what you think of me.'

Clara was silent for a minute.

'I have sometimes wondered whether you have not demanded a little too much of yourself and
Frank.  It is always a question of how much. There is no human truth which is altogether true,
no love which is altogether perfect.  You may possibly have neglected virtue or devotion such
as you could not find elsewhere, overlooking it because some failing, or the lack of sympathy
on some unimportant point, may at the moment have been prominent.  Frank loved you, Madge.'

Madge did not reply; she withdrew her arm from her sister's neck, threw herself back in her
chair and closed her eyes.  She saw again the Fenmarket roads, that summer evening, and she
felt once more Frank's burning caresses.  She thought of him as he left St Paul's, perhaps
broken-hearted.  Stronger than every other motive to return to him, and stronger than ever,
was the movement towards him of that which belonged to him.

At last she cried out, literally cried, with a vehemence which startled and terrified Clara, -

'Clara, Clara, you know not what you do!  For God's sake forbear!' She was again silent, and
then she turned round hurriedly, hid her face, and sobbed piteously.  It lasted, however, but
for a minute; she rose, wiped her eyes, went to the window, came back again, and said, -

'It is beginning to snow.'

The iron pillar bolted to the solid rock had quivered and resounded under the blow, but its
vibrations were nothing more than those of the rigid metal; the base was unshaken and, except
for an instant, the column had not been deflected a hair's-breadth.

CHAPTER XIX

Mr Cohen, who had obtained the situation indirectly for Clara, thought nothing more about it
until, one day, he went to the shop, and he then recollected his recommendation, which had
been given solely in faith, for he had never seen the young woman, and had trusted entirely
to Marshall.  He found her at her dark desk, and as he approached her, she hastily put a mark
in a book and closed it.

'Have you sold a little volume called After Office Hours by a man named Robinson?'

'I did not know we had it.  I have never seen it.'

'I do not wonder, but I saw it here about six months ago; it was up there,' pointing to a top
shelf.  Clara was about to mount the ladder, but he stopped her, and found what he wanted.
Some of the leaves were torn.

'We can repair those for you; in about a couple of days it shall be ready.'

He lingered a little, and at that moment another customer entered. Clara went forward to speak
to him, and Cohen was able to see that it was the Heroes and Hero Worship she had been studying,
a course of lectures which had been given by a Mr Carlyle, of whom Cohen knew something.  As
the customer showed no signs of departing, Cohen left, saying he would call again.

Before sending Robinson's After Office Hours to the binder, Clara looked at it.  It was made
up of short essays, about twenty altogether, bound in dark-green cloth, lettered at the side,
and published in 1841.  They were upon the oddest subjects:  such as, Ought Children to learn
Rules before Reasons?  The Higher Mathematics and Materialism.  Ought We to tell Those Whom
We love what We think about Them?  Deductive Reasoning in Politics.  What Troubles ought We
to Make Known and What ought We to Keep Secret:  Courage as a Science and an Art.

Clara did not read any one essay through, she had no time, but she was somewhat struck with
a few sentences which caught her eye; for example--'A mere dream, a vague hope, ought in some
cases to be more potent than a certainty in regulating our action.  The faintest vision of
God should be more determinative than the grossest earthly assurance.'

'I knew a case in which a man had to encounter three successive trials of all the courage and
inventive faculty in him.  Failure in one would have been ruin.  The odds against him in each
trial were desperate, and against ultimate victory were overwhelming. Nevertheless, he made
the attempt, and was triumphant, by the narrowest margin, in every struggle.  That which is
of most value to us is often obtained in defiance of the laws of probability.'

'What is precious in Quakerism is not so much the doctrine of the Divine voice as that of the
preliminary stillness, the closure against other voices and the reduction of the mind to a
condition in which it can LISTEN, in which it can discern the merest whisper, inaudible when
the world, or interest, or passion, are permitted to speak.'

'The acutest syllogiser can never develop the actual consequences of any system of policy,
or, indeed, of any change in human relationship, man being so infinitely complex, and the interaction
of human forces so incalculable.'

'Many of our speculative difficulties arise from the unauthorised conception of an OMNIPOTENT
God, a conception entirely of our own creation, and one which, if we look at it closely, has
no meaning. This continued some days, during which the Inca lost some men. While the battle was
proceeding, Michi and those of Chinchay-suyu turned, desolating and destroying everything
in the land of the Cayambis.

They were so furious that they did not leave anything standing, making the very earth to tremble.
When Huayna Ccapac knew that his detachment was near the fortress, he feigned a flight. The Cayambis,
not aware of what was happening in their rear, came out of the fortress
in pursuit of the Inca.

When the Cayambis were at some distance from their stronghold, the Chinchay-suyus, commanded
by Michi, came in sight. These met with no resistance in the fortress as the Cayambis were outside,
following Huayna Ccapac. They easily entered it and set it on fire in several parts, killing or capturing
all who were inside.

The Cayambis were, by this time, fighting with the army of Huayna Ccapac. When they saw their fortress
on fire they lost hope and fled from the battle field towards a lake which was near, thinking
that they could save themselves by hiding among the beds of reeds. But Huayna Ccapac followed them
with great rapidity. In order that none might escape he gave instructions that the lake should
be surrounded. In that lake, and the swamps on its borders, the troops of Huayna Ccapac, he
fighting most furiously in person, made such havock and slaughter, that the lake was coloured
with the blood of the dead Cayambis. From that time forward the lake has been called Yahuar-cocha,
which means the "lake of blood," from the quantity that was there shed.

It is to be noted that in the middle of this lake there was an islet
with two willow trees, up which some Cayambis climbed, and among them
their two chiefs named Pinto and Canto, most valiant Indians.  It is indeed a very unpleasant
discovery.  If he has done anything well which was worth doing, or has made himself a name,
he may be treated by women with respect or adulation, but any passable boy of twenty is really
more interesting to them, and, unhappily, there is perhaps so much of the man left in him that
he would rather see the eyes of a girl melt when she looked at him than be adored by all the
drawing-rooms in London as the author of the greatest poem since Paradise Lost, or as the conqueror
of half a continent.  Baruch's life during the last nineteen years had been such that he was
still young, and he desired more than ever, because not so blindly as he desired it when he
was a youth, the tender, intimate sympathy of a woman's love.  It was singular that, during
all those nineteen years, he should not once have been overcome.  It seemed to him as if he
had been held back, not by himself, but by some external power, which refused to give any reasons
for so doing. There was now less chance of yielding than ever; he was reserved and self-respectful,
and his manner towards women distinctly announced to them that he knew what he was and that
he had no claims whatever upon them.  He was something of a philosopher, too; he accepted,
therefore, as well as he could, without complaint, the inevitable order of nature, and he tried
to acquire, although often he failed, that blessed art of taking up lightly and even with a
smile whatever he was compelled to handle.  'It is possible,' he said once, 'to consider death
too seriously.'  He was naturally more than half a Jew; his features were Jewish, his thinking
was Jewish, and he believed after a fashion in the Jewish sacred books, or, at anyrate, read
them continuously, although he had added to his armoury defensive weapons of another type.
In nothing was he more Jewish than in a tendency to dwell upon the One, or what he called God,
clinging still to the expression of his forefathers although departing so widely from them.
In his ethics and system of life, as well as in his religion, there was the same intolerance
of a multiplicity which was not reducible to unity.  He seldom explained his theory, but everybody
who knew him recognised the difference which it wrought between him and other men.  There was
a certain concord in everything he said and did, as if it were directed by some enthroned but
secret principle.

He had encountered no particular trouble since his wife's death, but his life had been unhappy.
He had no friends, much as he longed for friendship, and he could not give any reasons for
his failure.  He saw other persons more successful, but he remained solitary.  Their needs
were not so great as his, for it is not those who have the least but those who have the most
to give who most want sympathy.  He had often made advances; people had called on him and had
appeared interested in him, but they had dropped away.  The cause was chiefly to be found in
his nationality.  The ordinary Englishman disliked him simply as a Jew, and the better sort
were repelled by a lack of geniality and by his inability to manifest a healthy interest in
personal details.  Partly also the cause was that those who care to speak about what is nearest
to them are very rare, and most persons find conversation easy in proportion to the remoteness
of its topics from them.  Whatever the reasons may have been, Baruch now, no matter what the
pressure from within might be, generally kept himself to himself.  It was a mistake and he
ought not to have retreated so far upon repulse.  A word will sometimes, when least expected,
unlock a heart, a soul is gained for ever, and at once there is much more than a recompense
for the indifference of years.

After the death of his wife, Baruch's affection spent itself upon his son Benjamin, whom he
had apprenticed to a firm of optical instrument makers in York.  The boy was not very much
like his father.  He was indifferent to that religion by which his father lived, but he inherited
an aptitude for mathematics, which was very necessary in his trade.  Benjamin also possessed
his father's rectitude, trusted him, and looked to him for advice to such a degree that even
Baruch, at last, thought it would be better to send him away from home in order that he might
become a little more self-reliant and independent.  It was the sorest of trials to part with
him, and, for some time after he left, Baruch's loneliness was intolerable.  It was, however,
relieved by a visit to York perhaps once in four or five months, for whenever business could
be alleged as an excuse for going north, he managed, as he said, 'to take York on his way.'

The day after he met Clara he started for Birmingham, and although York was certainly not 'on
his way,' he pushed forward to the city and reached it on a Saturday evening.  He was to spend
Sunday there, and on Sunday morning he proposed that they should hear the cathedral service,
and go for a walk in the afternoon.  To this suggestion Benjamin partially assented.  He wished
to go to the cathedral in the morning, but thought his father had better rest after dinner.
Baruch somewhat resented the insinuation of possible fatigue consequent on advancing years.

'What do you mean?' he said; 'you know well enough I enjoy a walk in the afternoon; besides,
I shall not see much of you, and do not want to lose what little time I have.'

About three, therefore, they started, and presently a girl met them, who was introduced simply
as 'Miss Masters.'

'We are going to your side of the water,' said the son; 'you may as well cross with us.'

They came to a point where a boat was moored, and a man was in it. There was no regular ferry,
but on Sundays he earned a trifle by taking people to the opposite meadow, and thus enabling
them to vary their return journey to the city.  When they were about two-thirds of the way
over, Benjamin observed that if they stood up they could see the Minster.  They all three rose,
and without an instant's warning-- they could not tell afterwards how it happened--the boat
half capsized, and they were in eight or nine feet of water.  Baruch could not swim and went
down at once, but on coming up close to the gunwale he caught at it and held fast.  Looking
round, he saw that Benjamin, who could swim well, had made for Miss Masters, and, having caught
her by the back of the neck, was taking her ashore.  The boatman, who could also swim, called
out to Baruch to hold on, gave the boat three or four vigorous strokes from the stern, and
Baruch felt the ground under his feet.  The boatman's little cottage was not far off, and,
when the party reached it, Benjamin earnestly desired Miss Masters to take off her wet clothes
and occupy the bed which was offered her. He himself would run home--it was not half-a-mile--and,
after having changed, would go to her house and send her sister with what was wanted.  He was
just off when it suddenly struck him that his father might need some attention.

'Oh, father--' he began, but the boatman's wife interposed.

'He can't be left like that, and he can't go home; he'll catch his death o' cold, and there
isn't but one more bed in the house, and that isn't quite fit to put a gentleman in.  Howsomever,
he must turn in there, and my husband, he can go into the back-kitchen and rub himself down.
You won't do yourself no good, Mr Cohen,' addressing the son, whom she knew, 'by going back;
you'd better stay here and get into bed with your father.'

In a few minutes the boatman would have gone on the errand, but Benjamin could not lose the
opportunity of sacrificing himself for Miss Masters.  He rushed off, and in three-quarters
of an hour had returned with the sister.  Having learned, after anxious inquiry, that Miss
Masters, so far as could be discovered, had not caught a chill, he went to his father.

'Well, father, I hope you are none the worse for the ducking,' he said gaily.  'The next time
you come to York you'd better bring another suit of clothes with you.'

Baruch turned round uneasily and did not answer immediately.  He had had a narrow escape from
drowning.

'Nothing of much consequence.  Is your friend all right?'

'Oh, yes; I was anxious about her, for she is not very strong, but I do not think she will
come to much harm.  I made them light a fire in her room.'

'Are they drying my clothes?'

'I'll go and see.'

He went away and encountered the elder Miss Masters, who told him that her sister, feeling
no ill effects from the plunge, had determined to go home at once, and in fact was nearly ready.
Benjamin waited, and presently she came downstairs, smiling.

'Nothing the matter.  I owe it to you, however, that I am not now in another world.'

Benjamin was in an ecstasy, and considered himself bound to accompany her to her door.

Meanwhile, Baruch lay upstairs alone in no very happy temper.  He heard the conversation below,
and knew that his son had gone.  In all genuine love there is something of ferocious selfishness.
The perfectly divine nature knows how to keep it in check, and is even capable--supposing it
to be a woman's nature--of contentment if the loved one is happy, no matter with what or with
whom; but the nature only a little less than divine cannot, without pain, endure the thought
that it no longer owns privately and exclusively that which it loves, even when it loves a
child, and Baruch was particularly excusable, considering his solitude.  Nevertheless, he had
learned a little wisdom, and, what was of much greater importance, had learned how to use it
when he needed it.  It had been forced upon him; it was an adjustment to circumstances, the
wisest wisdom.  It was not something without any particular connection with him; it was rather
the external protection built up from within to shield him where he was vulnerable; it was
the answer to questions which had been put to HIM, and not to those which had been put to other
people.  So it came to pass that, when he said bitterly to himself that, if he were at that
moment lying dead at the bottom of the river, Benjamin would have found consolation very near
at hand, he was able to reflect upon the folly of self-laceration, and to rebuke himself for
a complaint against what was simply the order of Nature, and not a personal failure.

His self-conquest, however, was not very permanent.  When he left York the next morning, he
fancied his son was not particularly grieved, and he was passive under the thought that an
epoch in his life had come, that the milestones now began to show the distance to the place
to which he travelled, and, still worse, that the boy who had been so close to him, and upon
whom he had so much depended, had gone from him.

There is no remedy for our troubles which is uniformly and progressively efficacious.  All
that we have a right to expect from our religion is that gradually, very gradually, it will
assist us to a real victory.  After each apparent defeat, if we are bravely in earnest, we
gain something on our former position.  Baruch was two days on his journey back to town, and
as he came nearer home, he recovered himself a little.  Suddenly he remembered the bookshop
and the book for which he had to call, and that he had intended to ask Marshall something about
the bookseller's new assistant.

CHAPTER XX

Madge was a puzzle to Mrs Caffyn.  Mrs Caffyn loved her, and when she was ill had behaved like
a mother to her.  The newly-born child, a healthy girl, was treated by Mrs Caffyn as if it
were her own granddaughter, and many little luxuries were bought which never appeared in Mrs
Marshall's weekly bill.  Naturally, Mrs Caffyn's affection moved a response from Madge, and
Mrs Caffyn by degrees heard the greater part of her history; but why she had separated herself
from her lover without any apparent reason remained a mystery, and all the greater was the
mystery because Mrs Caffyn believed that there were no other facts to be known than those she
knew.  She longed to bring about a reconciliation.  It was dreadful to her that Madge should
be condemned to poverty, and that her infant should be fatherless, although there was a gentleman
waiting to take them both and make them happy.

'The hair won't be dark like yours, my love,' she said one afternoon, soon after Madge had
come downstairs and was lying on the sofa.  'The hair do darken a lot, but hers will never
be black.  It's my opinion as it'll be fair.'

Madge did not speak, and Mrs Caffyn, who was sitting at the head of the couch, put her work
and her spectacles on the table.  It was growing dusk; she took Madge's hand, which hung down
by her side, and gently lifted it up.  Such a delicate hand, Mrs Caffyn thought.  She was proud
that she had for a friend the owner of such a hand, who behaved to her as an equal.  It was
delightful to be kissed--no mere formal salutations--by a lady fit to go into the finest drawing-room
in London, but it was a greater delight that Madge's talk suited her better than any she had
heard at Great Oakhurst.  It was natural she should rejoice when she discovered, unconsciously
that she had a soul, to which the speech of the stars, though somewhat strange, was not an
utterly foreign tongue.

She retained her hold on Madge's hand.

'May be,' she continued, 'it'll be like its father's.  In our family all the gals take after
the father, and all the boys after the mother.  I suppose as HE has lightish hair?'

Still Madge said nothing.

'It isn't easy to believe as the father of that blessed dear could have been a bad lot.  I'm
sure he isn't, and yet there's that Polesden gal at the farm, she as went wrong with Jim, a
great ugly brute, and she herself warnt up to much, well, as I say, her child was the delicatest
little angel as I ever saw.  It's my belief as God-a-mighty mixes Hisself up in it more nor
we think.  But there WAS nothing amiss with him, was there, my sweet?'

Mrs Caffyn inclined her head towards Madge.

'Oh, no!  Nothing, nothing.'

'Don't you think, my dear, if there's nothing atwixt you, as it was a flyin' in the face of
Providence to turn him off?  You were reglarly engaged to him, and I have heard you say he
was very fond of you.  I suppose there were some high words about something, and a kind of
a quarrel like, and so you parted, but that's nothing.  It might all be made up now, and it
ought to be made up.  What was it about?'

'There was no quarrel.'

'Well, of course, if you don't like to say anything more to me, I won't ask you.  I don't want
to hear any secrets as I shouldn't hear. I speak only because I can't abear to see you here
when I believe as everything might be put right, and you might have a house of your own, and
a good husband, and be happy for the rest of your days.  It isn't too late for that now. Huascar
built edifices where he was born, and in Cuzco he erected the houses
of Amaru-cancha, where is now the monastery of the "Name of Jesus,"
and others on the Colcampata, where Don Carlos lives, the son of Paulo.

After

that he summoned Cusi Tupac Yupanqui, and the other principal orejones who had come with the
body of his father, and who were of the lineage of Inca Yupanqui
and therefore relations of the mother of Atahualpa.

He asked them why they had not brought Atahualpa with them, saying that doubtless they had
left him there, that he might rebel at Quito, and that when he did so, they would kill their Inca
at Cuzco. The orejones, who had been warned of this suspicion, answered that they knew nothing
except that Atahualpa remained at Quito, as he had stated publicly, that he might not be poor
and despised among his relations in Cuzco.

Huascar, not believing what they said, put them to the torture, but
he extracted nothing further from them.

Huascar considered the harm that these orejones had done, and that
he never could be good friends with them or be able to trust them,
so he caused them to be put to death.

This gave rise to great lamentation in Cuzco and hatred of Huascar among the Hanan-cuzcos, to
which party the deceased belonged.

Seeing this Huascar publicly said that he divorced and separated himself from relationship with
the lineages of the Hanan-cuzcos because they were for Atahualpa who was a traitor, not having
come to Cuzco to do homage. Then he declared war with Atahualpa and assembled troops to send
against him. Meanwhile Atahualpa sent his messengers to Huascar with presents, saying that he
was his vassal, and as such he desired to know how he could serve the Inca.

If I felt aversion my course would be clear, but there is no aversion; on the contrary, our
affection for one another is sufficient for a decent household and decent existence undisturbed
by catastrophes.  No brighter sunlight is obtained by others far better than myself.  Ought
I to expect a refinement of relationship to which I have no right?  Our claims are always beyond
our deserts, and we are disappointed if our poor, mean, defective natures do not obtain the
homage which belongs to those of ethereal texture.  It will be a life with no enthusiasms nor
romance, perhaps, but it will be tolerable, and what may be called happy, and my child will
be protected and educated.  My child! what is there which I ought to put in the balance against
her?  If our sympathy is not complete, I have my own little oratory:  I can keep the candles
alight, close the door, and worship there alone.'

So she mused, and her foes again ranged themselves over against her. There was nothing to support
her but something veiled, which would not altogether disclose or explain itself.  Nevertheless,
in a few minutes, her enemies had vanished, like a mist before a sudden wind, and she was once
more victorious.  Precious and rare are those divine souls, to whom that which is aerial is
substantial, the only true substance; those for whom a pale vision possesses an authority they
are forced unconditionally to obey.

CHAPTER XXI

Mrs Caffyn was unhappy, and made up her mind that she would talk to Frank herself.  She had
learned enough about him from the two sisters, especially from Clara, to make her believe that,
with a very little management, she could bring him back to Madge.  The difficulty was to see
him without his father's knowledge.  At last she determined to write to him, and she made her
son-in-law address the envelope and mark it private.  This is what she said:-

'DEAR SIR,--Although unbeknown to you, I take the liberty of telling you as M. H. is alivin'
here with me, and somebody else as I think you ought to see, but perhaps I'd better have a
word or two with you myself, if not quite ill-convenient to you, and maybe you'll be kind enough
to say how that's to be done to your obedient, humble servant,

'MRS CAFFYN.'

She thought this very diplomatic, inasmuch as nobody but Frank could possibly suspect what
the letter meant.  It went to Stoke Newington, but, alas! he was in Germany, and poor Mrs Caffyn
had to wait a week before she received a reply.  Frank of course understood it. Although he
had thought about Madge continually, he had become calmer.  He saw, it is true, that there
was no stability in his position, and that he could not possibly remain where he was.  Had
Madge been the commonest of the common, and his relationship to her the commonest of the common,
he could not permit her to cast herself loose from him for ever and take upon herself the whole
burden of his misdeed.  But he did not know what to do, and, as successive considerations and
reconsiderations ended in nothing, and the distractions of a foreign country were so numerous,
Madge had for a time been put aside, like a huge bill which we cannot pay, and which staggers
us.  We therefore docket it, and hide it in the desk, and we imagine we have done something.
Once again, however, the flame leapt up out of the ashes, vivid as ever.  Once again the thought
that he had been so close to Madge, and that she had yielded to him, touched him with peculiar
tenderness, and it seemed impossible to part himself from her.  To a man with any of the nobler
qualities of man it is not only a sense of honour which binds him to a woman who has given
him all she has to give.  Separation seems unnatural, monstrous, a divorce from himself; it
is not she alone, but it is himself whom he abandons.  Frank's duty, too, pointed imperiously
to the path he ought to take, duty to the child as well as to the mother.  He determined to
go home, secretly; Mrs Caffyn would not have written if she had not seen good reason for believing
that Madge still belonged to him.  He made up his mind to start the next day, but when the
next day came, instructions to go immediately to Hamburg arrived from his father.  There were
rumours of the insolvency of a house with which Mr Palmer dealt; inquiries were necessary which
could better be made personally, and if these rumours were correct, as Mr Palmer believed them
to be, his agency must be transferred to some other firm.  There was now no possibility of
a journey to England.  For a moment he debated whether, when he was at Hamburg, he could not
slip over to London, but it would be dangerous.  Further orders might come from his father,
and the failure to acknowledge them would lead to evasion, and perhaps to discovery.  He must,
therefore, content himself with a written explanation to Mrs Caffyn why he could not meet her,
and there should be one more effort to make atonement to Madge.  This was what went to Mrs
Caffyn, and to her lodger:-

'DEAR MADAM,--Your note has reached me here.  I am very sorry that my engagements are so pressing
that I cannot leave Germany at present. I have written to Miss Hopgood.  There is one subject
which I cannot mention to her--I cannot speak to her about money.  Will you please give me
full information?  I enclose 20 pounds, and I must trust to your discretion.  I thank you heartily
for all your kindness.--Truly yours,

'FRANK PALMER.'

'MY DEAREST MADGE,--I cannot help saying one more word to you, although, when I last saw you,
you told me that it was useless for me to hope.  I know, however, that there is now another
bond between us, the child is mine as well as yours, and if I am not all that you deserve,
ought you to prevent me from doing my duty to it as well as to you?  It is true that if we
were to marry I could never right you, and perhaps my father would have nothing to do with
us, but in time he might relent, and I will come over at once, or, at least, the moment I have
settled some business here, and you shall be my wife. Do, my dearest Madge, consent.'

When he came to this point his pen stopped.  What he had written was very smooth, but very
tame and cold.  However, nothing better presented itself; he changed his position, sat back
in his chair, and searched himself, but could find nothing.  It was not always so. Some months
ago there would have been no difficulty, and he would not have known when to come to an end.
The same thing would have been said a dozen times, perhaps, but it would not have seemed the
same to him, and each succeeding repetition would have been felt with the force of novelty.
He took a scrap of paper and tried to draft two or three sentences, altered them several times
and made them worse.  He then re-read the letter; it was too short; but after all it contained
what was necessary, and it must go as it stood.  She knew how he felt towards her.  So he signed
it after giving his address at Hamburg, and it was posted.

Three or four days afterwards Mrs Marshall, in accordance with her usual custom, went to see
Madge before she was up.  The child lay peacefully by its mother's side and Frank's letter
was upon the counterpane.  The resolution that no letter from him should be opened had been
broken.  The two women had become great friends and, within the last few weeks, Madge had compelled
Mrs Marshall to call her by her Christian name.

'You've had a letter from Mr Palmer; I was sure it was his handwriting when it came late last
night.'

'You can read it; there is nothing private in it.'

She turned round to the child and Mrs Marshall sat down and read. When she had finished she
laid the letter on the bed again and was silent.

'Well?' said Madge.  'Would you say "No?"'

'Yes, I would.'

'For your own sake, as well as for his?'

Mrs Marshall took up the letter and read half of it again.

'Yes, you had better say "No."  You will find it dull, especially if you have to live in London.'

'Did you find London dull when you came to live in it?'

'Rather; Marshall is away all day long.'

'But scarcely any woman in London expects to marry a man who is not away all day.'

'They ought then to have heaps of work, or they ought to have a lot of children to look after;
but, perhaps, being born and bred in the country, I do not know what people in London are.
Recollect you were country born and bred yourself, or, at anyrate, you have lived in the country
for the most of your life.'

'Dull! we must all expect to be dull.'

'There's nothing worse.  I've had rheumatic fever, and I say, give me the fever rather than
what comes over me at times here.  If Marshall had not been so good to me, I do not know what
I should have done with myself.'

Madge turned round and looked Mrs Marshall straight in the face, but she did not flinch.

'Marshall is very good to me, but I was glad when mother and you and your sister came to keep
me company when he is not at home.  It tired me to have my meals alone:  it is bad for the
digestion; at least, so he says, and he believes that it was indigestion that was the matter
with me.  I should be sorry for myself if you were to go away; not that I want to put that
forward.  Maybe I should never see much more of you:  he is rich:  you might come here sometimes,
but he would not like to have Marshall and mother and me at his house.'

Not a word was spoken for at least a minute.

Suddenly Mrs Marshall took Madge's hand in her own hands, leaned over her, and in that kind
of whisper with which we wake a sleeper who is to be aroused to escape from sudden peril, she
said in her ear, -

'Madge, Madge:  for God's sake leave him!'

'I have left him.'

'Are you sure?'

'Quite.'

'For ever?'

'For ever!'

Mrs Marshall let go Madge's hand, turned her eyes towards her intently for a moment, and again
bent over her as if she were about to embrace her.  A knock, however, came at the door, and
Mrs Caffyn entered with the cup of coffee which she always insisted on bringing before Madge
rose.  After she and her daughter had left, Madge read the letter once more.  There was nothing
new in it, but formally it was something, like the tolling of the bell when we know that our
friend is dead.  There was a little sobbing, and then she kissed her child with such eagerness
that it began to cry. 

Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa.

Having been seen by his Excellency he said that it may be known if the said history was in conformity
with the information and evidence, which has been taken from the
Indians and other persons of this city and in other parts, and he
ordered that Doctor Loarte, Alcalde of the court of his Majesty should
cause to appear before him the principal and most intelligent Indians
of the twelve ayllus or lineages of the twelve Incas and other persons
who may be summoned, and being assembled before me, the present Secretary,
the said history shall be read and declared to them by an interpreter
in the language of the said Indians, that each one may understand
and discuss it among themselves, whether it is conformable to the
truth as they know it.

  He was once assistant
minister to Irving, but was now heretical, and had a congregation of his own creating at Woolwich.

Baruch called at the shop and found Clara once more alone.  The book was packed up and had
being lying ready for him for two or three days.  He wanted to speak, but hardly knew how to
begin.  He looked idly round the shelves, taking down one volume after another, and at last
he said, -

'I suppose nobody but myself has ever asked for a copy of Robinson?'

'Not since I have been here.'

'I do not wonder at it; he printed only two hundred and fifty; he gave away five-and-twenty,
and I am sure nearly two hundred were sold as wastepaper.'

'He is a friend of yours?'

'He was a friend; he is dead; he was an usher in a private school, although you might have
supposed, from the title selected, that he was a clerk.  I told him it was useless to publish,
and his publishers told him the same thing.'

'I should have thought that some notice would have been taken of him; he is so evidently worth it.'

'Yes, but although he was original and reflective, he had no particular talent.  His excellence
lay in criticism and observation, often profound, on what came to him every day, and he was
valueless in the literary market.  A talent of some kind is necessary to genius if it is to
be heard.  So he died utterly unrecognised, save by one or two personal friends who loved him
dearly.  He was peculiar in the depth and intimacy of his friendships.  Few men understand
the meaning of the word friendship.  They consort with certain companions and perhaps very
earnestly admire them, because they possess intellectual gifts, but of friendship, such as
we two, Morris and I (for that was his real name) understood it, they know nothing.'

'Do you believe, that the good does not necessarily survive?'

'Yes and no; I believe that power every moment, so far as our eyes can follow it, is utterly
lost.  I have had one or two friends whom the world has never known and never will know, who
have more in them than is to be found in many an English classic.  I could take you to a little
dissenting chapel not very far from Holborn where you would hear a young Welshman, with no
education beyond that provided by a Welsh denominational college, who is a perfect orator and
whose depth of insight is hardly to be matched, save by Thomas A Kempis, whom he much resembles.
When he dies he will be forgotten in a dozen years. Besides, it is surely plain enough to everybody
that there are thousands of men and women within a mile of us, apathetic and obscure, who,
if, an object worthy of them had been presented to them, would have shown themselves capable
of enthusiasm and heroism. Huge volumes of human energy are apparently annihilated.'

'It is very shocking, worse to me than the thought of the earthquake or the pestilence.'

'I said "yes and no" and there is another side.  The universe is so wonderful, so intricate,
that it is impossible to trace the transformation of its forces, and when they seem to disappear
the disappearance may be an illusion.  Moreover, "waste" is a word which is applicable only
to finite resources.  If the resources are infinite it has no meaning.'

Two customers came in and Baruch was obliged to leave.  When he came to reflect, he was surprised
to find not only how much he had said, but what he had said.  He was usually reserved, and
with strangers he adhered to the weather or to passing events.  He had spoken, however, to
this young woman as if they had been acquainted for years.  Clara, too, was surprised.  She
always cut short attempts at conversation in the shop.  Frequently she answered questions and
receipted and returned bills without looking in the faces of the people who spoke to her or
offered her the money.  But to this foreigner, or Jew, she had disclosed something she felt.
She was rather abashed, but presently her employer, Mr Barnes, returned and somewhat relieved her.

'The gentleman who bought After Office Hours came for it while you were out?'

'Oh! what, Cohen?  Good fellow Cohen is; he it was who recommended you to me.  He is brother-in-law
to your landlord.'  Clara was comforted; he was not a mere 'casual,' as Mr Barnes called his
chance customers.

CHAPTER XXIII

About a fortnight afterwards, on a Sunday afternoon, Cohen went to the Marshalls'.  He had
called there once or twice since his mother- in-law came to London, but had seen nothing of
the lodgers.  It was just about tea-time, but unfortunately Marshall and his wife had gone
out.  Mrs Caffyn insisted that Cohen should stay, but Madge could not be persuaded to come
downstairs, and Baruch, Mrs Caffyn and Clara had tea by themselves.  Baruch asked Mrs Caffyn
if she could endure London after living for so long in the country.

'Ah! my dear boy, I have to like it.'

'No, you haven't; what you mean is that, whether you like it, or whether you do not, you have
to put up with it.'

'No, I don't mean that.  Miss Hopgood, Cohen and me, we are the best of friends, but whenever
he comes here, he allus begins to argue with me.  Howsomever, arguing isn't everything, is
it, my dear?  There's some things, after all, as I can do and he can't, but he's just wrong
here in his arguing that wasn't what I meant.  I meant what I said, as I had to like it.'

'How can you like it if you don't?'

'How can I?  That shows you're a man and not a woman.  Jess like you men.  YOU'D do what you
didn't like, I know, for you're a good sort-- and everybody would know you didn't like it--but
what would be the use of me a-livin' in a house if I didn't like it?--with my daughter and
these dear, young women?  If it comes to livin', you'd ten thousand times better say at once
as you hate bein' where you are than go about all day long, as if you was a blessed saint and
put upon.'

Mrs Caffyn twitched at her gown and pulled it down over her knees and brushed the crumbs off
with energy.  She continued, 'I can't abide people who everlastin' make believe they are put
upon.  Suppose I were allus a-hankering every foggy day after Great Oakhurst, and yet a-tellin'
my daughter as I knew my place was here; if I was she, I should wish my mother at Jericho.'

'Then you really prefer London to Great Oakhurst?' said Clara.

'Why, my dear, of course I do.  Don't you think it's pleasanter being here with you and your
sister and that precious little creature, and my daughter, than down in that dead-alive place?
Not that I don't miss my walk sometimes into Darkin; you remember that way as I took you once,
Baruch, across the hill, and we went over Ranmore Common and I showed you Camilla Lacy, and
you said as you knew a woman who wrote books who once lived there?  You remember them beech-woods?
Ah, it was one October!  Weren't they a colour--weren't they lovely?'

Baruch remembered them well enough.  Who that had ever seen them could forget them?

'And it was I as took you!  You wouldn't think it, my dear, though he's always a-arguin', I
do believe he'd love to go that walk again, even with an old woman, and see them heavenly beeches.
But, Lord, how I do talk, and you've neither of you got any tea.'

'Have you lived long in London, Miss Hopgood?' inquired Baruch.

'Not very long.'

'Do you feel the change?'

'I cannot say I do not.'

'I suppose, however, you have brought yourself to believe in Mrs Caffyn's philosophy?'

'I cannot say that, but I may say that I am scarcely strong enough for mere endurance, and
I therefore always endeavour to find something agreeable in circumstances from which there
is no escape.'

The recognition of the One in the Many had as great a charm for Baruch as it had for Socrates,
and Clara spoke with the ease of a person whose habit it was to deal with principles and generalisations.

'Yes, and mere toleration, to say nothing of opposition, at least so far as persons are concerned,
is seldom necessary.  It is generally thought that what is called dramatic power is a poetic
gift, but it is really an indispensable virtue to all of us if we are to be happy.'

Mrs Caffyn did not take much interest in abstract statements.  'You remember,' she said, turning
to Baruch, 'that man Chorley as has the big farm on the left-hand side just afore you come
to the common?  He wasn't a Surrey man:  he came out of the shires.'

'Very well.'

'He's married that Skelton girl; married her the week afore I left. There isn't no love lost
there, but the girl's father said he'd murder him if he didn't, and so it come off.  How she
ever brought herself to it gets over me.  She has that big farm-house, and he's made a fine
drawing-room out of the livin' room on the left-hand side as you go in, and put a new grate
in the kitchen and turned that into the livin' room, and they does the cooking in the back
kitchen, but for all that, if I'd been her, I'd never have seen his face no more, and I'd have
packed off to Australia.'

'Does anybody go near them?'

'Near them! of course they do, and, as true as I'm a-sittin' here, our parson, who married
them, went to the breakfast.  It isn't Chorley as I blame so much; he's a poor, snivellin'
creature, and he was frightened, but it's the girl.  She doesn't care for him no more than
me, and then again, although, as I tell you, he's such a poor creature, he's awful cruel and
mean, and she knows it.  But what was I a-goin' to say?  Never shall I forget that wedding.
You know as it's a short cut to the church across the farmyard at the back of my house.  The
parson, he was rather late--I suppose he'd been giving himself a finishin' touch--and, as it
had been very dry weather, he went across the straw and stuff just at the edge like of the
yard. There was a pig under the straw--pigs, my dear,' turning to Clara, 'nuzzle under the
straw so as you can't see them.  Just as he came to this pig it started up and upset him, and
he fell and straddled across its back, and the Lord have mercy on me if it didn't carry him
at an awful rate, as if he was a jockey at Epsom races, till it come to a puddle of dung water,
and then down he plumped in it.  You never see'd a man in such a pickle!  I heer'd the pig
a-squeakin' like mad, and I ran to the door, and I called out to him, and I says, "Mr Ormiston,
won't you come in here?" and though, as you know, he allus hated me, he had to come.  Mussy
on us, how he did stink, and he saw me turn up my nose, and he was wild with rage, and he called
the pig a filthy beast.  I says to him as that was the pig's way and the pig didn't know who
it was who was a-ridin' it, and I took his coat off and wiped his stockings, and sent to the
rectory for another coat, and he crept up under the hedge to his garden, and went home, and
the people at church had to wait for an hour.  I was glad I was goin' away from Great Oakhurst,
for he never would have forgiven me.'

There was a ring at the front door bell, and Clara went to see who was there.  It was a runaway
ring, but she took the opportunity of going upstairs to Madge.

'She has a sister?' said Baruch.

'Yes, and I may just as well tell you about her now--leastways what I know--and I believe as
I know pretty near everything about her. You'll have to be told if they stay here.  She was
engaged to be married, and how it came about with a girl like that is a bit beyond me, anyhow,
there's a child, and the father's a good sort by what I can make out, but she won't have anything
more to do with him.'

'What do you mean by "a girl like that."'

'She isn't one of them as goes wrong; she can talk German and reads books.'

'Did he desert her?'

'No, that's just it.  She loves me, although I say it, as if I was her mother, and yet I'm
just as much in the dark as I was the first day I saw her as to why she left that man.'

Mrs Caffyn wiped the corners of her eyes with her apron.

'It's gospel truth as I never took to anybody as I've took to her.'

After Baruch had gone, Clara returned.

'He's a curious creature, my dear,' said Mrs Caffyn, 'as good as gold, but he's too solemn
by half.  It would do him a world of good if he'd somebody with him who'd make him laugh more.
He CAN laugh, for I've seen him forced to get up and hold his sides, but he never makes no
noise.  He's a Jew, and they say as them as crucified our blessed Lord never laugh proper.

CHAPTER XXIV

Baruch was now in love.  He had fallen in love with Clara suddenly and totally.  His tendency
to reflectiveness did not diminish his passion:  it rather augmented it.  The men and women
whose thoughts are here and there continually are not the people to feel the full force of
love.  Those who do feel it are those who are accustomed to think of one thing at a time, and
to think upon it for a long time. 'No man,' said Baruch once, 'can love a woman unless he loves
God.' 'I should say,' smilingly replied the Gentile, 'that no man can love God unless he loves
a woman.'  'I am right,' said Baruch, 'and so are you.'

But Baruch looked in the glass:  his hair, jet black when he was a youth, was marked with grey,
and once more the thought came to him-- this time with peculiar force--that he could not now
expect a woman to love him as she had a right to demand that he should love, and that he must
be silent.  He was obliged to call upon Barnes in about a fortnight's time.  He still read
Hebrew, and he had seen in the shop a copy of the Hebrew translation of the Moreh Nevochim
of Maimonides, which he greatly coveted, but could not afford to buy. Like every true book-lover,
he could not make up his mind when he wished for a book which was beyond his means that he
ought once for all to renounce it, and he was guilty of subterfuges quite unworthy of such
a reasonable creature in order to delude himself into the belief that he might yield.  For
example, he wanted a new overcoat badly, but determined it was more prudent to wait, and a
week afterwards very nearly came to the conclusion that as he had not ordered the coat he had
actually accumulated a fund from which the Moreh Nevochim might be purchased.  When he came
to the shop he saw Barnes was there, and he persuaded himself he should have a quieter moment
or two with the precious volume when Clara was alone.  Barnes, of course, gossiped with everybody.

He therefore called again in the evening, about half an hour before closing time, and found
that Barnes had gone home.  Clara was busy with a catalogue, the proof of which she was particularly
anxious to send to the printer that night.  He did not disturb her, but took down the Maimonides,
and for a few moments was lost in revolving the doctrine, afterwards repeated and proved by
a greater than Maimonides, that the will and power of God are co-extensive:  that there is
nothing which might be and is not.  It was familiar to Baruch, but like all ideas of that quality
and magnitude--and there are not many of them--it was always new and affected him like a starry
night, seen hundreds of times, yet for ever infinite and original.

But was it Maimonides which kept him till the porter began to put up the shutters?  Was he
pondering exclusively upon God as the folio lay open before him?  He did think about Him, but
whether he would have thought about Him for nearly twenty minutes if Clara had not been there
is another matter.

'Do you walk home alone?' he said as she gave the proof to the boy who stood waiting.

'Yes, always.'

'I am going to see Marshall to-night, but I must go to Newman Street first.  I shall be glad
to walk with you, if you do not mind diverging a little.'

She consented and they went along Oxford Street without speaking, the roar of the carriages
and waggons preventing a word.

They turned, however, into Bloomsbury, and were able to hear one another.  He had much to say
and he could not begin to say it.  There was a great mass of something to be communicated pent
up within him, and he would have liked to pour it all out before her at once.  It is just at
such times that we often take up as a means of expression and relief that which is absurdly
inexpressive and irrelevant.

'I have not seen your sister yet; I hope I may see her this evening.'

'I hope you may, but she frequently suffers from headache and prefers to be alone.'

'How do you like Mr Barnes?'

The answer is not worth recording, nor is any question or answer which was asked or returned
for the next quarter of an hour worth recording, although they were so interesting then.  When
they were crossing Bedford Square on their return Clara happened to say amongst other commonplaces,
-

'What a relief a quiet space in London is.'

'I do not mind the crowd if I am by myself.'

'I do not like crowds; I dislike even the word, and dislike "the masses" still more.  I do
not want to think of human beings as if they were a cloud of dust, and as if each atom had
no separate importance.  London is often horrible to me for that reason.  In the country it
was not quite so bad.'

'That is an illusion,' said Baruch after a moment's pause.

'I do not quite understand you, but if it be an illusion it is very painful. Returning to the Inca,
that he might name some one else, they found that he was dead. While the orejones stood in
suspense about the succession, Cusi Tupac Yupanqui said: "Take care of the body, for I go to Tumipampa
to give the fringe to Ninan Cuyoche." But when he arrived at Tumipampa he found that Ninan
Cuyoche was also dead of the small-pox pestilence[119].

[Note 119: Ninan Cuyoche is said by Cobos to have been legitimate,
a son of the first wife Cusi Rimay Huaco, who is said by Sarmiento
and others not to have borne a male heir.]

Seeing this Cusi Tupac
Yupanqui said to Araua Ocllo--"Be not sad, O Coya! go quickly to Cuzco,
and say to your son Huascar that his father named him to be Inca when
his own days were over."

He appointed two orejones to accompany her, with orders to say to the Incas of Cuzco that they
were to give the fringe to Huascar.

Cusi Tupac added that he would make necessary arrangements and would presently follow them
with the body of Huayna Ccapac, to enter Cuzco with it in triumph, the order of which had been
ordained by the Inca on the point of death, on a staff.

Huayna Ccapac died at Quito at the age of 80 years.

He left more than 50 sons. He succeeded at the age of 20, and reigned
60 years.

He was valiant though cruel.

He left a lineage or ayllu called Tumipampa Ayllu.

At present the heads of it, now living, are Don Diego Viracocha Inca, Don Garcia Inguil Tupac,
and Gonzalo Sayri. To this ayllu are joined the sons of Paulu Tupac, son of Huayna Ccapac. They
are Hanan-cuzcos.

Huayna Ccapac died in the year 1524 of the nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ, the invincible Emperor
Charles V of glorious memory being King of Spain, father of your Majesty, and the Pope was Paul
III.

The body of Huayna Ccapac was found by the Licentiate Polo in a house where it was kept concealed,
in the city of Cuzco.

It was guarded by two of his servants named Hualpa Titu and Sumac
Yupanqui.

His idol or guauqui was called Huaraqui Inca.

It was a great image of gold, which has not been found up to the present time.

LXIII

THE LIFE OF HUASCAR, THE LAST INCA, AND OF ATAHUALPA.

Huayna Ccapac being dead, and the news having reached Cuzco, they
raised Titu Cusi Hualpa Inti Illapa, called Huascar, to be Inca.

He was called Huascar because he was born in a town called Huascar-quihuar, four and a half
leagues from Cuzco. Those who remained at Tumipampa embalmed the body of Huayna Ccapac, and
collected the spoils and captives taken in his wars, for a triumphal
entry into the capital.

It is to be noted that Atahualpa, bastard
son of Huayna Ccapac by Tocto Coca, his cousin, of the lineage of
Inca Yupanqui, had been taken to that war by his father to prove him.
He first went against the Pastos, and came back a fugitive, for which
his father rated him severely. Owing to this Atahualpa did not appear
among the troops, and he spoke to the Inca orejones of Cuzco in this
manner. "My Lords! you know that I am a son of Huayna Ccapac and that
my father took me with him, to prove me in the war.  She turned the conversation towards some indifferent
subject, and in a few minutes they were at Great Ormond Street.  Baruch would not go in as
he had intended; he thought it was about to rain, and he was late.  As he went along he became
calmer, and when he was fairly indoors he had passed into a despair entirely inconsistent--superficially--with
the philosopher Baruch, as inconsistent as the irrational behaviour in Bedford Square.  He
could well enough interpret, so he believed, Miss Hopgood's suppression of him.  Ass that he
was not to see what he ought to have known so well, that he was playing the fool to her; he,
with a grown-up son, to pretend to romance with a girl!  At that moment she might be mocking
him, or, if she was too good for mockery, she might be contriving to avoid or to quench him.
The next time he met her, he would be made to understand that he was PITIED, and perhaps he
would then learn the name of the youth who was his rival, and had won her.  He would often
meet her, no doubt, but of what value would anything he could say be to her.  She could not
be expected to make fine distinctions, and there was a class of elderly men, to which of course
he would be assigned, but the thought was too horrible.

Perhaps his love for Clara might be genuine; perhaps it was not.  He had hoped that as he grew
older he might be able really to SEE a woman, but he was once more like one of the possessed.
It was not Clara Hopgood who was before him, it was hair, lips, eyes, just as it was twenty
years ago, just as it was with the commonest shop-boy he met, who had escaped from the counter,
and was waiting at an area gate.  It was terrible to him to find that he had so nearly lost
his self-control, but upon this point he was unjust to himself, for we are often more distinctly
aware of the strength of the temptation than of the authority within us, which falteringly,
but decisively, enables us at last to resist it.

Then he fell to meditating how little his studies had done for him. What was the use of them?
They had not made him any stronger, and he was no better able than other people to resist temptation.
After twenty years continuous labour he found himself capable of the vulgarest, coarsest faults
and failings from which the remotest skiey influence in his begetting might have saved him.

Clara was not as Baruch.  No such storm as that which had darkened and disheartened him could
pass over her, but she could love, perhaps better than he, and she began to love him.  It was
very natural to a woman such as Clara, for she had met a man who had said to her that what
she believed was really of some worth.  Her father and mother had been very dear to her; her
sister was very dear to her, but she had never received any such recognition as that which
had now been offered to her:  her own self had never been returned to her with such honour.
She thought, too--why should she not think it?--of the future, of the release from her dreary
occupation, of a happy home with independence, and she thought of the children that might be.
She lay down without any misgiving.  She was sure he was in love with her; she did not know
much of him, certainly, in the usual meaning of the word, but she knew enough.  She would like
to find out more of his history; perhaps without exciting suspicion she might obtain it from
Mrs Caffyn.

CHAPTER XXV

Mr Frank Palmer was back again in England.  He was much distressed when he received that last
letter from Mrs Caffyn, and discovered that Madge's resolution not to write remained unshaken.
He was really distressed, but he was not the man upon whom an event, however deeply felt at
the time, could score a furrow which could not be obliterated.  If he had been a dramatic personage,
what had happened to him would have been the second act leading to a fifth, in which the Fates
would have appeared, but life seldom arranges itself in proper poetic form.  A man determines
that he must marry; he makes the shop-girl an allowance, never sees her or her child again,
transforms himself into a model husband, is beloved by his wife and family; the woman whom
he kissed as he will never kiss his lawful partner, withdraws completely, and nothing happens
to him.

Frank was sure he could never love anybody as he had loved Madge, nor could he cut indifferently
that other cord which bound him to her. Nobody in society expects the same paternal love for
the offspring of a housemaid or a sempstress as for the child of the stockbroker's or brewer's
daughter, and nobody expects the same obligations, but Frank was not a society youth, and Madge
was his equal.  A score of times, when his fancy roved, the rope checked him as suddenly as
if it were the lasso of a South American Gaucho.  But what could he do? that was the point.
There were one or two things which he could have done, perhaps, and one or two things which
he could not have done if he had been made of different stuff; but there was nothing more to
be done which Frank Palmer could do.  After all, it was better that Madge should be the child's
mother than that it should belong to some peasant.  At least it would be properly educated.
As to money, Mrs Caffyn had told him expressly that she did not want it.  That might be nothing
but pride, and he resolved, without very clearly seeing how, and without troubling himself
for the moment as to details, that Madge should be entirely and handsomely supported by him.
Meanwhile it was of great importance that he should behave in such a manner as to raise no
suspicion.  He did not particularly care for some time after his return from Germany to go
out to the musical parties to which he was constantly invited, but he went as a duty, and wherever
he went he met his charming cousin.  They always sang together; they had easy opportunities
of practising together, and Frank, although nothing definite was said to him, soon found that
his family and hers considered him destined for her.  He could not retreat, and there was no
surprise manifested by anybody when it was rumoured that they were engaged.  His story may
as well be finished at once.  He and Miss Cecilia Morland were married.  A few days before
the wedding, when some legal arrangements and settlements were necessary, Frank made one last
effort to secure an income for Madge, but it failed.  Mrs Caffyn met him by appointment, but
he could not persuade her even to be the bearer of a message to Madge.  He then determined
to confess his fears.  To his great relief Mrs Caffyn of her own accord assured him that he
never need dread any disturbance or betrayal.

'There are three of us,' she said, 'as knows you--Miss Madge, Miss Clara and myself--and, as
far as you are concerned, we are dead and buried.  I can't say as I was altogether of Miss
Madge's way of looking at it at first, and I thought it ought to have been different, though
I believe now as she's right, but,' and the old woman suddenly fired up as if some bolt from
heaven had kindled her, 'I pity you, sir--you, sir, I say--more nor I do her.  You little know
what you've lost, the blessedest, sweetest, ah, and the cleverest creature, too, as ever I
set eyes on.'

'But, Mrs Caffyn,' said Frank, with much emotion, 'it was not I who left her, you know it was
not, and, and even--'

The word 'now' was coming, but it did not come.

'Ah,' said Mrs Caffyn, with something like scorn, 'I know, yes, I do know.  It was she, you
needn't tell me that, but, God-a-mighty in heaven, if I'd been you, I'd have laid myself on
the ground afore her, I'd have tore my heart out for her, and I'd have said, "No other woman
in this world but you"--but there, what a fool I am!  Goodbye, Mr Palmer.'

She marched away, leaving Frank very miserable, and, as he imagined, unsettled, but he was
not so.  The fit lasted all day, but when he was walking home that evening, he met a poor friend
whose wife was dying.

'I am so grieved,' said Frank 'to hear of your trouble--no hope?'

'None, I am afraid.'

'It is very dreadful.'

'Yes, it is hard to bear, but to what is inevitable we must submit.'

This new phrase struck Frank very much, and it seemed very philosophic to him, a maxim, for
guidance through life.  It did not strike him that it was generally either a platitude or an
excuse for weakness, and that a nobler duty is to find out what is inevitable and what is not,
to declare boldly that what the world oftentimes affirms to be inevitable is really evitable,
and heroically to set about making it so.  Even if revolt be perfectly useless, we are not
particularly drawn to a man who prostrates himself too soon and is incapable of a little cursing.

As it was impossible to provide for Madge and the child now, Frank considered whether he could
not do something for them in the will which he had to make before his marriage.  He might help
his daughter if he could not help the mother.

But his wife would perhaps survive him, and the discovery would cause her and her children
much misery; it would damage his character with them and inflict positive moral mischief. 
The will, therefore, did not mention Madge, and it was not necessary to tell his secret to
his solicitor.

The wedding took place amidst much rejoicing; everybody thought the couple were most delightfully
matched; the presents were magnificent; the happy pair went to Switzerland, came back and settled
in one of the smaller of the old, red brick houses in Stoke Newington, with a lawn in front,
always shaved and trimmed to the last degree of smoothness and accuracy, with paths on whose
gravel not the smallest weed was ever seen, and with a hot-house that provided the most luscious
black grapes.  There was a grand piano in the drawing-room, and Frank and Cecilia became more
musical than ever, and Waltham Lodge was the headquarters of a little amateur orchestra which
practised Mozart and Haydn, and gave local concerts.  A twelvemonth after the marriage a son
was born and Frank's father increased Frank's share in the business.  Mr Palmer had long ceased
to take any interest in the Hopgoods.  He considered that Madge had treated Frank shamefully
in jilting him, but was convinced that he was fortunate in his escape.  It was clear that she
was unstable; she probably threw him overboard for somebody more attractive, and she was not
the woman to be a wife to his son.

One day Cecilia was turning out some drawers belonging to her husband, and she found a dainty
little slipper wrapped up in white tissue paper.  She looked at it for a long time, wondering
to whom it could have belonged, and had half a mind to announce her discovery to Frank, but
she was a wise woman and forbore.  It lay underneath some neckties which were not now worn,
two or three silk pocket handkerchiefs also discarded, and some manuscript books containing
school themes.  She placed them on the top of the drawers as if they had all been taken out
in a lump and the slipper was at the bottom.

'Frank my dear,' she said after dinner, 'I emptied this morning one of the drawers in the attic.
I wish you would look over the things and decide what you wish to keep.  I have not examined
them, but they seem to be mostly rubbish.'

He went upstairs after he had smoked his cigar and read his paper. There was the slipper! 
It all came back to him, that never-to-be- forgotten night, when she rebuked him for the folly
of kissing her foot, and he begged the slipper and determined to preserve it for ever, and
thought how delightful it would be to take it out and look at it when he was an old man.  Even
now he did not like to destroy it, but Cecilia might have seen it and might ask him what he
had done with it, and what could he say?  Finally he decided to burn it. There was no fire,
however, in the room, and while he stood meditating, Cecilia called him.  He replaced the slipper
in the drawer.  He could not return that evening, but he intended to go back the next morning,
take the little parcel away in his pocket and burn it at his office.  At breakfast some letters
came which put everything else out of mind.  The first thing he did that evening was to revisit
the garret, but the slipper had gone.  Cecilia had been there and had found it carefully folded
up in the drawer.  She pulled it out, snipped and tore it into fifty pieces, carried them downstairs,
threw them on the dining-room fire, sat down before it, poking them further and further into
the flames, and watched them till every vestige had vanished.  Frank did not like to make any
inquiries; Cecilia made none, and thence-forward no trace existed at Waltham Lodge of Madge
Hopgood.

CHAPTER XXVI

Baruch went neither to Barnes's shop nor to the Marshalls for nearly a month.  One Sunday morning
he was poring over the Moreh Nevochim, for it had proved too powerful a temptation for him,
and he fell upon the theorem that without God the Universe could not continue to exist, for
God is its Form.  It was one of those sayings which may be nothing or much to the reader. 
Whether it be nothing or much depends upon the quality of his mind.

There was certainly nothing in it particularly adapted to Baruch's condition at that moment,
but an antidote may be none the less efficacious because it is not direct.  It removed him
to another region.  It was like the sight and sound of the sea to the man who has been in trouble
in an inland city.  His self-confidence was restored, for he to whom an idea is revealed becomes
the idea, and is no longer personal and consequently poor.

His room seemed too small for him; he shut his book and went to Great Ormond Street.  He found
there Marshall, Mrs Caffyn, Clara and a friend of Marshall's named Dennis.

'Where is your wife?' said Baruch to Marshall.

'Gone with Miss Madge to the Catholic chapel to hear a mass of Mozart's.'

'Yes,' said Mrs Caffyn.  'I tell them they'll turn Papists if they do not mind.  They are always
going to that place, and there's no knowing, so I've hear'd, what them priests can do.  They
aren't like our parsons.  Catch that man at Great Oakhurst a-turnin' anybody.'

'I suppose,' said Baruch to Clara, 'it is the music takes your sister there?'

'Mainly, I believe, but perhaps not entirely.'

'What other attraction can there be?'

'I am not in the least disposed to become a convert.  Once for all, Catholicism is incredible
and that is sufficient, but there is much in its ritual which suits me.  There is no such intrusion
of the person of the minister as there is in the Church of England, and still worse amongst
dissenters.  In the Catholic service the priest is nothing; it is his office which is everything;
he is a mere means of communication.  The mass, in so far as it proclaims that miracle is not
dead, is also very impressive to me.'

'I do not quite understand you,' said Marshall, 'but if you once chuck your reason overboard,
you may just as well be Catholic as Protestant.  Nothing can be more ridiculous than the Protestant
objection, on the ground of absurdity, to the story of the saint walking about with his head
under his arm.'

The tea things had been cleared away, and Marshall was smoking.  Both he and Dennis were Chartists,
and Baruch had interrupted a debate upon a speech delivered at a Chartist meeting that morning
by Henry Vincent.

Frederick Dennis was about thirty, tall and rather loose-limbed.  He wore loose clothes, his
neck-cloth was tied in a big, loose knot, his feet were large and his boots were heavy.  His
face was quite smooth, and his hair, which was very thick and light brown, fell across his
forehead in a heavy wave with just two complete undulations in it from the parting at the side
to the opposite ear.  It had a trick of tumbling over his eyes, so that his fingers were continually
passed through it to brush it away.  He was a wood engraver, or, as he preferred to call himself,
an artist, but he also wrote for the newspapers, and had been a contributor to the Northern
Star.  He was well brought up and was intended for the University, but he did not stick to
his Latin and Greek, and as he showed some talent for drawing he was permitted to follow his
bent.  His work, however, was not of first-rate quality, and consequently orders were not abundant.
This was the reason why he had turned to literature.  When he had any books to illustrate he
lived upon what they brought him, and when there were no books he renewed his acquaintance
with politics.  If books and newspapers both failed, he subsisted on a little money which had
been left him, stayed with friends as long as he could, and amused himself by writing verses
which showed much command over rhyme.

'I cannot stand Vincent,' said Marshall, 'he is too flowery for me, and he does not belong
to the people.  He is middle-class to the backbone.'

'He is deficient in ideas,' said Dennis.

'It is odd,' continued Marshall, turning to Cohen, 'that your race never takes any interest
in politics.'

'My race is not a nation, or, if a nation, has no national home.  It took an interest in politics
when it was in its own country, and produced some rather remarkable political writing.'

'But why do you care so little for what is going on now?'

'I do care, but all people are not born to be agitators, and, furthermore, I have doubts if
the Charter will accomplish all you expect.'

'I know what is coming'--Marshall took the pipe out of his mouth and spoke with perceptible
sarcasm--'the inefficiency of merely external remedies, the folly of any attempt at improvement
which does not begin with the improvement of individual character, and that those to whom we
intend to give power are no better than those from whom we intend to take it away.  All very
well, Mr Cohen.  My answer is that at the present moment the stockingers in Leicester are earning
four shillings and sixpence a week. Huanca Auqui fled, those of Atahualpa following in pursuit
as far as Caxamarca, where Huanca Auqui met a large reinforcement sent by Huascar in support.
Huanca Auqui ordered them to march against Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz
while he remained at Caxamarca.

The troops sent by Huanca Auqui were Chachapoyas and many others, the whole numbering 10,000.
They met the enemy and fought near Caxamarca. But the Chachapoyas
were defeated and no more than 3000 escaped.

Huanca Auqui then fled towards Cuzco, followed by the army of Atahualpa.

In the province of Bombon[121], Huanca Auqui found a good army composed of all nations, which
Huascar had sent to await his enemies there, who were coming in pursuit. Those of Atahualpa arrived
and a battle was fought for two days without either party gaining an advantage. But on the
third day Huanca Auqui was vanquished by Quiz-quiz and Chalco Chima.

[Note 121: Correctly Pumpu.]

Huanca Auqui escaped from the rout and came to Xauxa, where he found
a further reinforcement of many Indians, Soras, Chancas, Ayamarcas,
and Yanyos, sent by his brother.

With these he left Xauxa and encountered the pursuing enemy at a
place called Yanamarca.

Here a battle was fought not less stubbornly than the former one. Finally, as fortune was against
Huanca Auqui, he was again defeated by Chalco Chima, the adventurous captain of the army of
Atahualpa.

The greater part of the forces of Huanca Auqui was killed. He himself fled, never stopping until
he reached Paucaray. Here he found a good company of orejones of Cuzco, under a captain named Mayta
Yupanqui who, on the part of Huascar, rebuked Huanca Auqui, asking
how it was possible for him to have lost so many battles and so many
men, unless he was secretly in concert with Chalco Chima.

He answered that the accusation was not true, that he could not have
done more; and he told Mayta Yupanqui to go against their enemy, and
see what power he brought.

He said that Atahualpa was determined to advance if they could not
hinder his captains.

Then Mayta Yupanqui went on to encounter Chalco Chima, and met him at the bridge of Anco-yacu where
there were many skirmishes, but finally the orejones were defeated[122].

As the fortune of Huascar and his captains, especially of Huanca Auqui, was so inferior to that
of Atahualpa and his adventurous and dexterous captains Chalco Chima
and Quiz-quiz, one side meeting with nothing that did not favour them,
the other side with nothing that was not against them, such terrible
fear took possession of Huanca Auqui and the other Inca captains after
the battle of Anco-yacu bridge, that they fled without stopping to
Vilcas, 20 and more leagues from Anco-yacu, on the road to Cuzco.

Over the satisfaction that the captains of Atahualpa felt at the glory of so many victories
that they had won, there came the news sent by Atahualpa that he had come in person to Caxamarca
and Huamachuco, that he had been received as Inca by all the nations he had passed, and that
he had assumed the fringe and the Ccapac-uncu. He was now called Inca of all the land, and it
was declared that there was no other Inca but him. He ordered his captains to march onwards
conquering, until they encountered Huascar. They were to give him battle, conquer him like the
rest, and if possible take him prisoner. Atahualpa was so elated by his victories, and assumed
such majesty, that he did not cease to talk of his successes, and
no one dared to raise his eyes before him.

For those who had business with him he appointed a lieutenant called "Inca Apu," which means "the
Inca's lord," who was to take his place by the Inca when he was seated. Those who had business
transacted it with him, entering with a load on their backs, and
their eyes on the ground, and thus they spoke of their business with
the Apu.

He then reported to Atahualpa, who decided what was to be done. Atahualpa was very cruel, he
killed right and left, destroyed, burnt, and desolated whatever opposed him. From Quito to
Huamachuco he perpetrated the greatest cruelties, robberies, outrages, and tyrannies that had
ever been done in that land.

When Atahualpa arrived at Huamachuco, two principal lords of his house came to offer sacrifice
to the huaca of Huamachuco for the success that had attended their cause. These orejones went,
made the sacrifice, and consulted the oracle.

They received an answer that Atahualpa would have an unfortunate end, because he was such a cruel
tyrant and shedder of so much human blood.

They delivered this reply of the devil to Atahualpa. It enraged him against the oracle, so
he called out his guards and went to where the huaca was kept. Having surrounded the place,
he took a halberd of gold in his hand, and was accompanied by the two officers of his household
who had made the sacrifice. When he came to where the idol was, an old man aged a hundred years
came out, clothed in a dress reaching down to the ground, very woolly and covered with sea shells.
He was the priest of the oracle who had made the reply

.  What would be the use
of giving them poor creatures votes? Why, there isn't one of them as wouldn't hold up his hand
for anybody as would give him a shilling.  Quite right of 'em, too, for the one thing they
have to think about from morning to night is how to get a bit of something to fill their bellies,
and they won't fill them by voting.'

'But what would you do for them?'

'Ah! that beats me!  Hang somebody, but I don't know who it ought to be.  There's a family
by the name of Longwood, they live just on the slope of the hill nigh the Dower Farm, and there's
nine of them, and the youngest when I left was a baby six months old, and their living- room
faces the road so that the north wind blows in right under the door, and I've seen the snow
lie in heaps inside.  As reg'lar as winter comes Longwood is knocked off--no work.  I've knowed
them not have a bit of meat for weeks together, and him a-loungin' about at the corner of the
street.  Wasn't that enough to make him feel as if somebody ought to be killed?  And Marshall
and Dennis say as the proper thing to do is to give him a vote, and prove to him there was
never no Abraham nor Isaac, and that Jonah never was in a whale's belly, and that nobody had
no business to have more children than he could feed.  And what goes on, and what must go on,
inside such a place as Longwood's, with him and his wife, and with them boys and gals all huddled
together--But I'd better hold my tongue.  We'll let the smoke out of this room, I think, and
air it a little.'

She opened the window, and Baruch rose and went home.

Whenever Mrs Caffyn talked about the labourers at Great Oakhurst, whom she knew so well, Clara
always felt as if all her reading had been a farce, and, indeed, if we come into close contact
with actual life, art, poetry and philosophy seem little better than trifling. When the mist
hangs over the heavy clay land in January, and men and women shiver in the bitter cold and
eat raw turnips, to indulge in fireside ecstasies over the divine Plato or Shakespeare is surely
not such a virtue as we imagine it to be.

CHAPTER XXVII

Baruch sat and mused before he went to bed.  He had gone out stirred by an idea, but it was
already dead.  Then he began to think about Clara.  Who was this Dennis who visited the Marshalls
and the Hopgoods?  Oh! for an hour of his youth!  Fifteen years ago the word would have come
unbidden if he had seen Clara, but now, in place of the word, there was hesitation, shame.
He must make up his mind to renounce for ever.  But, although this conclusion had forced itself
upon him overnight as inevitable, he could not resist the temptation when he rose the next
morning of plotting to meet Clara, and he walked up and down the street opposite the shop door
that evening nearly a quarter of an hour, just before closing time, hoping that she might come
out and that he might have the opportunity of overtaking her apparently by accident.  At last,
fearing he might miss her, he went in and found she had a companion whom he instantly knew,
before any induction, to be her sister.  Madge was not now the Madge whom we knew at Fenmarket.
She was thinner in the face and paler.  Nevertheless, she was not careless; she was even more
particular in her costume, but it was simpler.  If anything, perhaps, she was a little prouder.
She was more attractive, certainly, than she had ever been, although her face could not be
said to be handsomer.  The slight prominence of the cheek-bone, the slight hollow underneath,
the loss of colour, were perhaps defects, but they said something which had a meaning in it
superior to that of the tint of the peach.  She had been reading a book while Clara was balancing
her cash, and she attempted to replace it.  The shelf was a little too high, and the volume
fell upon the ground.  It contained Shelley's Revolt of Islam.

'Have you read Shelley?' said Baruch.

'Every line--when I was much younger.'

'Do you read him now?'

'Not much.  I was an enthusiast for him when I was nineteen, but I find that his subject matter
is rather thin, and his themes are a little worn.  He was entirely enslaved by the ideals of
the French Revolution.  Take away what the French Revolution contributed to his poetry, and
there is not much left.'

'As a man he is not very attractive to me.'

'Nor to me; I never shall forgive his treatment of Harriet.'

'I suppose he had ceased to love her, and he thought, therefore, he was justified in leaving her.'

Madge turned and fixed her eyes, unobserved, on Baruch.  He was looking straight at the bookshelves.
There was not, and, indeed, how could there be, any reference to herself.

'I should put it in this way,' she said, 'that he thought he was justified in sacrificing a
woman for the sake of an IMPULSE.  Call this a defect or a crime--whichever you like--it is
repellent to me. It makes no difference to me to know that he believed the impulse to be divine.'

'I wish,' interrupted Clara, 'you two would choose less exciting subjects of conversation;
my totals will not come right.'

They were silent, and Baruch, affecting to study a Rollin's Ancient History, wondered, especially
when he called to mind Mrs Caffyn's report, what this girl's history could have been.  He presently
recovered himself, and it occurred to him that he ought to give some reason why he had called.
Before, however, he was able to offer any excuse, Clara closed her book.

'Now, it is right,' she said, 'and I am ready.'

Just at that moment Barnes appeared, hot with hurrying.

'Very sorry, Miss Hopgood, to ask you to stay for a few minutes.  I recollected after I left
that the doctor particularly wanted those books sent off to-night.  I should not like to disappoint
him.  I have been to the booking-office, and the van will be here in about twenty minutes.
If you will make out the invoice and check me, I will pack them.'

'I will be off,' said Madge.  'The shop will be shut if I do not make haste.'

'You are not going alone, are you?' said Baruch.  'May I not go with you, and cannot we both
come back for your sister?'

'It is very kind of you.'

Clara looked up from her desk, watched them as they went out at the door and, for a moment,
seemed lost.  Barnes turned round.

'Now, Miss Hopgood.'  She started.

'Yes, sir.'

'Fabricius, J. A.  Bibliotheca Ecclesiastica in qua continentur.'

'I need not put in the last three words.'

'Yes, yes.'  Barnes never liked to be corrected in a title.  'There's another Fabricius Bibliotheca
or Bibliographia.  Go on--Basili opera ad MSS. codices, 3 vols.'

Clara silently made the entries a little more scholarly.  In a quarter of an hour the parcel
was ready and Cohen returned.

'Your sister would not allow me to wait.  She met Mrs Marshall; they said they should have
something to carry, and that it was not worth while to bring it here.  I will walk with you,
if you will allow me. We may as well avoid Holborn.'

They turned into Gray's Inn, and, when they were in comparative quietude, he said, -

'Any Chartist news?' and then without waiting for an answer, 'By the way, who is your friend
Dennis?'

'He is no particular friend of mine.  He is a wood-engraver, and writes also, I believe, for
the newspapers.'

'He can talk as well as write.'

'Yes, he can talk very well.'

'Do you not think there was something unreal about what he said?'

'I do not believe he is actually insincere.  I have noticed that men who write or read much
often appear somewhat shadowy.'

'How do you account for it?'

'What they say is not experience.'

'I do not quite understand.  A man may think much which can never become an experience in your
sense of the word, and be very much in earnest with what he thinks; the thinking is an experience.'

'Yes, I suppose so, but it is what a person has gone through which I like to hear.  Poor Dennis
has suffered much.  You are perhaps surprised, but it is true, and when he leaves politics
alone he is a different creature.'

'I am afraid I must be very uninteresting to you?'

'I did not mean that I care for nothing but my friend's aches and pains, but that I do not
care for what he just takes up and takes on.'

'It is my misfortune that my subjects are not very--I was about to say--human.  Perhaps it
is because I am a Jew.'

'I do not know quite what you mean by your "subjects," but if you mean philosophy and religion,
they are human.'

'If they are, very few people like to hear anything about them.  Do you know, Miss Hopgood,
I can never talk to anybody as I can to you.'

Clara made no reply.  A husband was to be had for a look, for a touch, a husband whom she could
love, a husband who could give her all her intellect demanded.  A little house rose before
her eyes as if by Arabian enchantment; there was a bright fire on the hearth, and there were
children round it; without the look, the touch, there would be solitude, silence and a childless
old age, so much more to be feared by a woman than by a man.  Baruch paused, waiting for her
answer, and her tongue actually began to move with a reply, which would have sent his arm round
her, and made them one for ever, but it did not come.  Something fell and flashed before her
like lightning from a cloud overhead, divinely beautiful, but divinely terrible.

'I remember,' she said, 'that I have to call in Lamb's Conduit Street to buy something for
my sister.  I shall just be in time.'  Baruch went as far as Lamb's Conduit Street with her.
He, too, would have determined his own destiny if she had uttered the word, but the power to
proceed without it was wanting and he fell back.  He left her at the door of the shop.  She
bid him good-bye, obviously intending that he should go no further with her, and he shook hands
with her, taking her hand again and shaking it again with a grasp which she knew well enough
was too fervent for mere friendship.  He then wandered back once more to his old room at Clerkenwell.
The fire was dead, he stirred it, the cinders fell through the grate and it dropped out all
together.  He made no attempt to rekindle it, but sat staring at the black ashes, not thinking,
but dreaming.  Thirty years more perhaps with no change!  The last chance that he could begin
a new life had disappeared.  He cursed himself that nothing drove him out of himself with Marshall
and his fellowmen; that he was not Chartist nor revolutionary; but it was impossible to create
in himself enthusiasm for a cause.  He had tried before to become a patriot and had failed,
and was conscious, during the trial, that he was pretending to be something he was not and
could not be.  There was nothing to be done but to pace the straight road in front of him,
which led nowhere, so far as he could see.

CHAPTER XXVIII

A month afterwards Marshall announced that he intended to pay a visit.

'I am going,' he said, 'to see Mazzini.  Who will go with me?'

Clara and Madge were both eager to accompany him.  Mrs Caffyn and Mrs Marshall chose to stay
at home.

'I shall ask Cohen to come with us,' said Marshall.  'He has never seen Mazzini and would like
to know him.'  Cohen accordingly called one Sunday evening, and the party went together to
a dull, dark, little house in a shabby street of small shops and furnished apartments.  When
they knocked at Mazzini's door Marshall asked for Mr --- for, even in England, Mazzini had
an assumed name which was always used when inquiries were made for him.  They were shown upstairs
into a rather mean room, and found there a man, really about forty, but looking older.  He
had dark hair growing away from his forehead, dark moustache, dark beard and a singularly serious
face. It was not the face of a conspirator, but that of a saint, although without that just
perceptible touch of silliness which spoils the faces of most saints.  It was the face of a
saint of the Reason, of a man who could be ecstatic for rational ideals, rarest of all endowments.
It was the face, too, of one who knew no fear, or, if he knew it, could crush it.  He was once
concealed by a poor woman whose house was surrounded by Austrian soldiers watching for him.
He was determined that she should not be sacrificed, and, having disguised himself a little,
walked out into the street in broad daylight, went up to the Austrian sentry, asked for a light
for his cigar and escaped.  He was cordial in his reception of his visitors, particularly of
Clara, Madge and Cohen, whom he had not seen before.

'The English,' he said, after some preliminary conversation, 'are a curious people.  As a nation
they are what they call practical and have a contempt for ideas, but I have known some Englishmen
who have a religious belief in them, a nobler belief than I have found in any other nation.
There are English women, also, who have this faith, and one or two are amongst my dearest friends.'

'I never,' said Marshall, 'quite comprehend you on this point.  I should say that we know as
clearly as most folk what we want, and we mean to have it.'

'That may be, but it is not Justice, as Justice which inspires you. Those of you who have not
enough, desire to have more, that is all.'

'If we are to succeed, we must preach what the people understand.'

'Pardon me, that is just where you and I differ.  Whenever any real good is done it is by a
crusade; that is to say, the cross must be raised and appeal be made to something ABOVE the
people.  No system based on rights will stand.  Never will society be permanent till it is
founded on duty.  If we consider our rights exclusively, we extend them over the rights of
our neighbours.  If the oppressed classes had the power to obtain their rights to-morrow, and
with the rights came no deeper sense of duty, the new order, for the simple reason that the
oppressed are no better than their oppressors, would be just as unstable as that which preceded
it.'

'To put it in my own language,' said Madge, 'you believe in God.'

Mazzini leaned forward and looked earnestly at her.

'My dear young friend, without that belief I should have no other.'

'I should like, though,' said Marshall, 'to see the church which would acknowledge you and
Miss Madge, or would admit your God to be theirs.'

'What is essential,' replied Madge, 'in a belief in God is absolute loyalty to a principle
we know to have authority.'

'It may, perhaps,' said Mazzini, 'be more to me, but you are right, it is a belief in the supremacy
and ultimate victory of the conscience.'

'The victory seems distant in Italy now,' said Baruch.  'I do not mean the millennial victory
of which you speak, but an approximation to it by the overthrow of tyranny there.'

'You are mistaken; it is far nearer than you imagine.'

'Do you obtain,' said Clara, 'any real help from people here?  Do you not find that they merely
talk and express what they call their sympathy?'

'I must not say what help I have received; more than words, though, from many.'

'You expect, then,' said Baruch, 'that the Italians will answer your appeal?'

'If I had no faith in the people, I do not see what faith could survive.'

'The people are the persons you meet in the street.'

'A people is not a mere assemblage of uninteresting units, but it is not a phantom.  A spirit
lives in each nation which is superior to any individual in it.  It is this which is the true
reality, the nation's purpose and destiny, it is this for which the patriot lives and dies.'

'I suppose,' said Clara, 'you have no difficulty in obtaining volunteers for any dangerous
enterprise?'

'None.  You would be amazed if I were to tell you how many men and women at this very moment
would go to meet certain death if I were to ask them.'

'Women?'

'Oh, yes; and women are of the greatest use, but it is rather difficult to find those who have
the necessary qualifications.'

'I suppose you employ them in order to obtain secret information?'

'Yes; amongst the Austrians.'

The party broke up.  Baruch manoeuvred to walk with Clara, but Marshall wanted to borrow a
book from Mazzini, and she stayed behind for him.  Madge was outside in the street, and Baruch
could do nothing but go to her.  She seemed unwilling to wait, and Baruch and she went slowly
homewards, thinking the others would overtake them. The conversation naturally turned upon Mazzini.

'Although,' said Madge, 'I have never seen him before, I have heard much about him and he makes
me sad.'

'Why?'

'Because he has done something worth doing and will do more.'

'But why should that make you sad?'

'I do not think there is anything sadder than to know you are able to do a little good and
would like to do it, and yet you are not permitted to do it.  Mazzini has a world open to him
large enough for the exercise of all his powers.'

'It is worse to have a desire which is intense but not definite, to be continually anxious
to do something, you know not what, and always to feel, if any distinct task is offered, your
incapability of attempting it.'

'A man, if he has a real desire to be of any service, can generally gratify it to some extent;
a woman as a rule cannot, although a woman's enthusiasm is deeper than a man's.  You can join
Mazzini to- morrow, I suppose, if you like.'

'It is a supposition not quite justifiable, and if I were free to go I could not.'

'Why?'

'I am not fitted for such work; I have not sufficient faith.  When I see a flag waving, a doubt
always intrudes.  Long ago I was forced to the conclusion that I should have to be content
with a life which did not extend outside itself.'

'I am sure that many women blunder into the wrong path, not because they are bad, but simply
because--if I may say so--they are too good.'

'Maybe you are right.  The inability to obtain mere pleasure has not produced the misery which
has been begotten of mistaken or baffled self-sacrifice.  But do you mean to say that you would
like to enlist under Mazzini?'

'No!'

Baruch thought she referred to her child, and he was silent.

'You are a philosopher,' said Madge, after a pause.  'Have you never discovered anything which
will enable us to submit to be useless?'

'That is to say, have I discovered a religion? for the core of religion is the relationship
of the individual to the whole, the faith that the poorest and meanest of us is a person. 
That is the real strength of all religions.'

'Well, go on; what do you believe?'

'I can only say it like a creed; I have no demonstration, at least none such as I would venture
to put into words.  Perhaps the highest of all truths is incapable of demonstration and can
only be stated. Perhaps, also, the statement, at least to some of us, is a sufficient demonstration.
I believe that inability to imagine a thing is not a reason for its non-existence.  If the
infinite is a conclusion which is forced upon me, the fact that I cannot picture it does not
disprove it.  I believe, also, in thought and the soul, and it is nothing to me that I cannot
explain them by attributes belonging to body.  That being so, the difficulties which arise
from the perpetual and unconscious confusion of the qualities of thought and soul with those
of body disappear.  Our imagination represents to itself souls like pebbles, and asks itself
what count can be kept of a million, but number in such a case is inapplicable.  I believe
that all thought is a manifestation of the Being, who is One, whom you may call God if you
like, and that, as It never was created, It will never be destroyed.'

'But,' said Madge, interrupting him, 'although you began by warning me not to expect that you
would prove anything, you can tell me whether you have any kind of basis for what you say,
or whether it is all a dream.'

'You will be surprised, perhaps, to hear that mathematics, which, of course, I had to learn
for my own business, have supplied something for a foundation.  They lead to ideas which are
inconsistent with the notion that the imagination is a measure of all things.  Mind, I do not
for a moment pretend that I have any theory which explains the universe.  It is something,
however, to know that the sky is as real as the earth.'

They had now reached Great Ormond Street, and parted.  Clara and Marshall were about five minutes
behind them.  Madge was unusually cheerful when they sat down to supper.

'Clara,' she said, 'what made you so silent to-night at Mazzini's?' Clara did not reply, but
after a pause of a minute or two, she asked Mrs Caffyn whether it would not be possible for
them all to go into the country on Whitmonday?  Whitsuntide was late; it would be warm, and
they could take their food with them and eat it out of doors.

'Just the very thing, my dear, if we could get anything cheap to take us; the baby, of course,
must go with us.

'I should like above everything to go to Great Oakhurst.'

'What, five of us--twenty miles there and twenty miles back! Besides, although I love the place,
it isn't exactly what one would go to see just for a day.  No!  Letherhead or Mickleham or
Darkin would be ever so much better.  They are too far, though, and, then, that man Baruch
must go with us.  He'd be company for Marshall, and he sticks up in Clerkenwell and never goes
nowhere.  You remember as Marshall said as he must ask him the next time we had an outing.'

Clara had not forgotten it.

'Ah,' continued Mrs Caffyn, 'I should just love to show you Mickleham.'

Mrs Caffyn's heart yearned after her Surrey land.  The man who is born in a town does not know
what it is to be haunted through life by lovely visions of the landscape which lay about him
when he was young.  The village youth leaves the home of his childhood for the city, but the
river doubling on itself, the overhanging alders and willows, the fringe of level meadow, the
chalk hills bounding the river valley and rising against the sky, with here and there on their
summits solitary clusters of beech, the light and peace of the different seasons, of morning,
afternoon and evening, never forsake him.  To think of them is not a mere luxury; their presence
modifies the whole of his life.

'I don't see how it is to be managed,' she mused; 'and yet there's nothing near London as I'd
give two pins to see.  There's Richmond as we went to one Sunday; it was no better, to my way
of thinking, than looking at a picture.  I'd ever so much sooner be a-walking across the turnips
by the footpath from Darkin home.'

'Couldn't we, for once in a way, stay somewhere over-night?'

'It might as well be two,' said Mrs Marshall; 'Saturday and Sunday.'

'Two,' said Madge; 'I vote for two.'

'Wait a bit, my dears, we're a precious awkward lot to fit in-- Marshall and his wife me and
you and Miss Clara and the baby; and then there's Baruch, who's odd man, so to speak; that's
three bedrooms.  We sha'n't do it--Otherwise, I was a-thinking--'

'What were you thinking?' said Marshall.

'I've got it,' said Mrs Caffyn, joyously.  'Miss Clara and me will go to Great Oakhurst on
the Friday.  We can easy enough stay at my old shop.  Marshall and Sarah, Miss Madge, the baby
and Baruch can go to Letherhead on the Saturday morning.  The two women and the baby can have
one of the rooms at Skelton's, and Marshall and Baruch can have the other.  Then, on Sunday
morning, Miss Clara and me we'll come over for you, and we'll all walk through Norbury Park.
That'll be ever so much better in many ways.  Miss Clara and me, we'll go by the coach. They were
to advance five marches beyond the fortress and, at a fixed time,
return towards it, desolating and destroying.

The Inca, with the rest of his army marched direct to the attack
of the fortress, and began to fight with great fury.

  We aren't like some folk as messes about up to Hampstead every Sunday,
and spends a fortune on shrimps and donkeys.  No; when I go away, it IS away, maybe it's only
for a couple of days, where I can see a blessed ploughed field; no shrimps nor donkeys for me.'

CHARTER XXIX

So it was settled, and on the Friday Clara and Mrs Caffyn journeyed to Great Oakhurst.  They
were both tired, and went to bed very early, in order that they might enjoy the next day. 
Clara, always a light sleeper, woke between three and four, rose and went to the little casement
window which had been open all night.  Below her, on the left, the church was just discernible,
and on the right, the broad chalk uplands leaned to the south, and were waving with green barley
and wheat.  Underneath her lay the cottage garden, with its row of beehives in the north-east
corner, sheltered from the cold winds by the thick hedge.  It had evidently been raining a
little, for the drops hung on the currant bushes, but the clouds had been driven by the south-westerly
wind into the eastern sky, where they lay in a long, low, grey band.  Not a sound was to be
heard, save every now and then the crow of a cock or the short cry of a just-awakened thrush.
High up on the zenith, the approach of the sun to the horizon was proclaimed by the most delicate
tints of rose-colour, but the cloud-bank above him was dark and untouched, although the blue
which was over it, was every moment becoming paler.  Clara watched; she was moved even to tears
by the beauty of the scene, but she was stirred by something more than beauty, just as he who
was in the Spirit and beheld a throne and One sitting thereon, saw something more than loveliness,
although He was radiant with the colour of jasper and there was a rainbow round about Him like
an emerald to look upon.  In a few moments the highest top of the cloud-rampart was kindled,
and the whole wavy outline became a fringe of flame.  In a few moments more the fire just at
one point became blinding, and in another second the sun emerged, the first arrowy shaft passed
into her chamber, the first shadow was cast, and it was day.  She put her hands to her face;
the tears fell faster, but she wiped them away and her great purpose was fixed.  She crept
back into bed, her agitation ceased, a strange and almost supernatural peace overshadowed her
and she fell asleep not to wake till the sound of the scythe had ceased in the meadow just
beyond the rick-yard that came up to one side of the cottage, and the mowers were at their
breakfast. 

The oaths being taken the reading was commenced in sum and substance. There was read on that
and following days from their fable of the creation to the end of the history of the Incas.
As it was read, so it was interpreted into their language, chapter
by chapter.  In the morning Mrs Caffyn was
so busy with her old friends that she rather tired herself, and in the evening Clara went for
a stroll.  She did not know the country, but she wandered on until she came to a lane which
led down to the river.  At the bottom of the lane she found herself at a narrow, steep, stone
bridge.  She had not been there more than three or four minutes before she descried two persons
coming down the lane from Letherhead.  When they were about a couple of hundred yards from
her they turned into the meadow over the stile, and struck the river-bank some distance below
the point where she was.  It was impossible to mistake them; they were Madge and Baruch.  They
sauntered leisurely; presently Baruch knelt down over the water, apparently to gather something
which he gave to Madge.  They then crossed another stile and were lost behind the tall hedge
which stopped further view of the footpath in that direction.

'The message then was authentic,' she said to herself.  'I thought I could not have misunderstood
it.'

On Sunday morning Clara wished to stay at home.  She pleaded that she preferred rest, but Mrs
Caffyn vowed there should be no Norbury Park if Clara did not go, and the kind creature managed
to persuade a pig- dealer to drive them over to Letherhead for a small sum, notwithstanding
it was Sunday.  The whole party then set out; the baby was drawn in a borrowed carriage which
also took the provisions, and they were fairly out of the town before the Letherhead bells
had ceased ringing for church.  It was one of the sweetest of Sundays, sunny, but masses of
white clouds now and then broke the heat.  The park was reached early in the forenoon, and
it was agreed that dinner should be served under one of the huge beech trees at the lower end,
as the hill was a little too steep for the baby-carriage in the hot sun.

'This is very beautiful,' said Marshall, when dinner was over, 'but it is not what we came
to see. He then followed the course of the river in search of the sea, seeking
for people to conquer, for he had information that in that direction
the country was well peopled.

On this road the army of the Inca was in great peril, suffering from scarcity of water, for the
troops had to cross extensive tracts of sand.

One day, at dawn, the Inca army found itself surrounded by an immense
crowd of people, not knowing who they were.

In fear of the unknown enemy, the troops began to retreat towards
the Inca.
Madge pleaded that it was she who ought to remain behind, but at last gave way for her sister
looked really fatigued.

'There's a dear child,' said Clara, when Madge consented to go.  'I shall lie on the grass
and perhaps go to sleep.'

'It is a pity,' said Baruch to Madge as they went away, 'that we are separated; we must come
again.'

'Yes, I am sorry, but perhaps it is better she should be where she is; she is not particularly
strong, and is obliged to be very careful.'

In due time they all came to the famous yews, and sat down on one of the seats overlooking
that wonderful gate in the chalk downs through which the Mole passes northwards.

'We must go,' said Marshall, 'a little bit further and see the oak.'

'Not another step,' said his wife.  'You can go it you like.'

'Content; nothing could be pleasanter than to sit here,' and he pulled out his pipe; 'but really,
Miss Madge, to leave Norbury without paying a visit to the oak is a pity.'

He did not offer, however, to accompany her.

'It is the most extraordinary tree in these parts,' said Baruch; 'of incalculable age and with
branches spreading into a tent big enough to cover a regiment.  Marshall is quite right.'

'Where is it?'

'Not above a couple of hundred yards further; just round the corner.'

Madge rose and looked.

'No; it is not visible here; it stands a little way back.  If you come a little further you
will catch a glimpse of it.'

She followed him and presently the oak came in view.  They climbed up the bank and went nearer
to it.  The whole vale was underneath them and part of the weald with the Sussex downs blue
in the distance. Baruch was not much given to raptures over scenery, but the indifference of
Nature to the world's turmoil always appealed to him.

'You are not now discontented because you cannot serve under Mazzini?'

'Not now.'

There was nothing in her reply on the face of it of any particular consequence to Baruch. 
She might simply have intended that the beauty of the fair landscape extinguished her restlessness,
or that she saw her own unfitness, but neither of these interpretations presented itself to him.

'I have sometimes thought,' continued Baruch, slowly, 'that the love of any two persons in
this world may fulfil an eternal purpose which is as necessary to the Universe as a great revolution.'

Madge's eyes moved round from the hills and they met Baruch's.  No syllable was uttered, but
swiftest messages passed, question and answer.  There was no hesitation on his part now, no
doubt, the woman and the moment had come.  The last question was put, the final answer was
given; he took her hand in his and came closer to her.

'Stop!' she whispered, 'do you know my history?'

He did not reply, but fell upon her neck.  This was the goal to which both had been journeying
all these years, although with much weary mistaking of roads; this was what from the beginning
was designed for both!  Happy Madge! happy Baruch!  There are some so closely akin that the
meaning of each may be said to lie in the other, who do not approach till it is too late. 
They travel towards one another, but are waylaid and detained, and just as they are within
greeting, one of them drops and dies.

They left the tree and went back to the Marshalls, and then down the hill to Mrs Caffyn and
Clara.  Clara was much better for her rest, and early in the evening the whole party returned
to Letherhead, Clara and Mrs Caffyn going on to Great Oakhurst.  Madge kept close to her sister
till they separated, and the two men walked together.  On Whitmonday morning the Letherhead
people came over to Great Oakhurst. He then ordered the old man's body, the idol, and its house
to be burnt, and the cinders to be scattered in the air. He then levelled the hill, though it
was very large, where that oracle, idol or huaca of the devil stood.

All this being made known to Chalco Chima and Quiz-quiz, they celebrated festivals and rejoicings,
and then resumed their march towards Cuzco. Huascar received reports of all that had happened,
and mourned over the great number of men he had lost.

He clearly saw that there only remained the remedy of going forth
in person to try his fortune, which had hitherto been so adverse.
In preparation he kept some fasts--for these gentiles also have a
certain kind of fasting, made many sacrifices to the idols and oracles
of Cuzco, and sought for replies.  Baruch Cohen loves me.'

'Do you love him?'

'Yes.'

'Without a shadow of a doubt?'

'Without a shadow of a doubt.'

Clara put her arm round her sister, kissed her tenderly and said, -

'Then I am perfectly happy.'

'Did you suspect it?'

'I knew it.'

Mrs Caffyn called them; it was time to be moving, and soon afterwards those who had to go to
London that afternoon left for Letherhead. Clara stood at the gate for a long time watching
them along the straight, white road.  They came to the top of the hill; she could just discern
them against the sky; they passed over the ridge and she went indoors.  In the evening a friend
called to see Mrs Caffyn, and Clara went to the stone bridge which she had visited on Saturday.
The water on the upper side of the bridge was dammed up and fell over the little sluice gates
under the arches into a clear and deep basin about forty or fifty feet in diameter.  The river,
for some reason of its own, had bitten into the western bank, and had scooped out a great piece
of it into an island.  The main current went round the island with a shallow, swift ripple,
instead of going through the pool, as it might have done, for there was a clear channel for
it. The centre and the region under the island were deep and still, but at the farther end,
where the river in passing called to the pool, it broke into waves as it answered the appeal,
and added its own contribution to the stream, which went away down to the mill and onwards
to the big Thames.  On the island were aspens and alders. The floods had loosened the roots
of the largest tree, and it hung over heavily in the direction in which it had yielded to the
rush of the torrent, but it still held its grip, and the sap had not forsaken a single branch.
Every one was as dense with foliage as if there had been no struggle for life, and the leaves
sang their sweet song, just perceptible for a moment every now and then in the variations of
the louder music below them.  It is curious that the sound of a weir is never uniform, but
is perpetually changing in the ear even of a person who stands close by it.  One of the arches
of the bridge was dry, and Clara went down into it, stood at the edge and watched that wonderful
sight--the plunge of a smooth, pure stream into the great cup which it has hollowed out for
itself.  Down it went, with a dancing, foamy fringe playing round it just where it met the
surface; a dozen yards away it rose again, bubbling and exultant.

She came up from the arch and went home as the sun was setting.  She found Mrs Caffyn alone.

'I have news to tell you,' she said.  'Baruch Cohen is in love with my sister, and she is in
love with him.'

'The Lord, Miss Clara!  I thought sometimes that perhaps it might be you; but there, it's better,
maybe, as it is, for--'

'For what?'

'Why, my dear, because somebody's sure to turn up who'll make you happy, but there aren't many
men like Baruch.  You see what I mean, don't you?  He's always a-reading books, and, therefore,
he don't think so much of what some people would make a fuss about.  Not as anything of that
kind would ever stop me, if I were a man and saw such a woman as Miss Madge.  He's really as
good a creature as ever was born, and with that child she might have found it hard to get along,
and now it will be cared for, and so will she be to the end of their lives.'

The evening after their return to Great Ormond Street, Mazzini was surprised by a visit from
Clara alone.

'When I last saw you,' she said, 'you told us that you had been helped by women.  I offer myself.'

'But, my dear madam, you hardly know what the qualifications are.  To begin with, there must
be a knowledge of three foreign languages, French, German and Italian, and the capacity and
will to endure great privation, suffering and, perhaps, death.'

'I was educated abroad, I can speak German and French.  I do not know much Italian, but when
I reach Italy I will soon learn.'

'Pardon me for asking you what may appear a rude question.  Is it a personal disappointment
which sends you to me, or love for the cause? It is not uncommon to find that young women,
when earthly love is impossible, attempt to satisfy their cravings with a love for that which
is impersonal.'

'Does it make any difference, so far as their constancy is concerned?'

'I cannot say that it does.  The devotion of many of the martyrs of the Catholic church was
repulsion from the world as much as attraction to heaven.  You must understand that I am not
prompted by curiosity.  If you are to be my friend, it is necessary that I should know you
thoroughly.'

'My motive is perfectly pure.'

They had some further talk and parted.  After a few more interviews, Clara and another English
lady started for Italy.  Madge had letters from her sister at intervals for eighteen months,
the last being from Venice.  Then they ceased, and shortly afterwards Mazzini told Baruch that
his sister-in-law was dead. 

Then Sinchi Rocca, the second Inca, having an older legitimate son named Manco Sapaca who, according
to the law he and his father had made, was entitled to the succession,
deprived him and nominated Lloqui Yupanqui the second son for his
successor.


It was sublime, but let us reverence also the Eternal Christ who is for ever being crucified
for our salvation.'

'Father,' said a younger Clara to Baruch some ten years later as she sat on his knee, 'I had
an Aunt Clara once, hadn't I?'

'Yes, my child.'

'Didn't she go to Italy and die there?'

'Yes.'

'Why did she go?'

'Because she wanted to free the poor people of Italy who were slaves.'
