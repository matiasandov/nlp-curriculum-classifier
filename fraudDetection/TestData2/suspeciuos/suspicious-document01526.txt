One day as I was quietly dining with Captain Holder, of the Cambria (a vessel just arrived
from England), one of my men came in with the startling news that three live gorillas had been
brought, one of them full grown. I had not long to wait; in they came. First, a very large
adult female, bound hand and foot; then her female child, screaming terribly; and lastly, a
vigorous young male, also tightly bound. The female had been ingeniously secured by the negroes
to a strong stick, the wrists bound to the upper part and the ankles to the lower, so that
she could not reach to tear the cords with her teeth. It was dark, and the scene was one so
wild and strange that I shall never forget it. The fiendish countenances of the Calibanish
trio, one of them distorted by pain, for the mother gorilla was severely wounded, were lit
up by the ruddy glare of native torches. The thought struck me, what would I not give to have
the group in London for a few days!

The young male I secured by a chain which I had in readiness, and gave him henceforth the name
of Tom. We untied his hands and feet; to show his gratitude for this act of kindness he immediately
made a rush at me, screaming with all his might; happily the chain was made fast, and I took
care afterwards to keep out of his way. The old mother gorilla was in an unfortunate plight.
She had an arm broken and a wound in the chest, besides being dreadfully beaten on the head.
She groaned and roared many times during the night, probably from pain.

I noticed next day, and on many occasions, that the vigorous young male whenever he made a
rush at any one and missed his aim, immediately ran back. This corresponds with what is known
of the habits of the large males in their native woods; when attacked they make a furious rush
at their enemy, break an arm or tear his bowels open, and then beat a retreat, leaving their
victim to shift for himself.

The wounded female died in the course of the next day; her moanings were more frequent in the
morning, and they gradually became weaker as her life ebbed out. Her death was like that of
a human being, and afflicted me more than I could have thought possible. Her child clung to
her to the last, and tried to obtain milk from her breast after she was dead. I photographed
them both when the young one was resting in its dead mother's lap. I kept the young one alive
for three days after its mother's death. It moaned at night most piteously. I fed it on goat's
milk, for it was too young to eat berries. It died the fourth day, having taken an unconquerable
dislike to the milk. It had, I think, begun to know me a little. As to the male, I made at
least a dozen attempts to photograph the irascible little demon, but all in vain. The pointing
of the camera towards him threw him into a perfect rage, and I was almost provoked to give
him a sound thrashing. The day after, however, I succeeded with him, taking two views, not
very perfect, but sufficient for my object.

I must now relate how these three animals were caught, premising that the capture of the female
was the first instance of an adult gorilla being taken alive. The place where they were found
was on the left bank of the Fernand Vaz, about thirty miles above my village. At this part
a narrow promontory projects into the river. Old McB. (aside to PHIL) Say something for me,
Phil, can't ye?--I hav'n't a word.

Mr. Carv.

(rising with a quicker motion than usual) Bless me! bless me!--here is a revolution! and a counter
revolution!--Here's news will make you all in as great astonishment as I own I am.

Old McB. What is it?

Randal. I'm made for life--I don't care what comes.

Honor. Nor I: so it is not to touch you, I'm happy.

Catty. Oh! your honour, spake quick, this time--I beg pardon!

Mr. Carv. Then I have to confess that for once I have been deceived and mistaken in my judgment of
a man; and what is more, of a man's circumstances completely--O'Blaney.

Old McB. What of his circumstances, oh! sir, in the name of mercy?

Mr. Carv. Bankrupt, at this instant all under seizure to the supervisor. Mr. Gerald O'Blaney
has fled the country.

Old McB. Then, Honor, you are without a penny; for all her fortune, 500l., was in his hands.

Randal. Then I'm as happy to have her without a penny--happier I am to prove my love pure.

Catty. God bless you for my own son! That's our way of thinking, Mr. McBride--you see it was
not for the fortune.

Honor. Oh! Phil, didn't I tell you her heart was right?

Catty. We will work hard--cheer up, McBrides. Now the Roonies and McBrides has joined, you'll
see we'll defy the world and O'Blaney, the chate of chates.

Honor. Randal's own mother!

Catty. Ay, now, we are all one family--now pull together. Don't be cast down, Phil dear. I'll never
call you flourishing Phil again, so don't be standing on pride. Suppose your shister has not
a pinny, she's better than the best, and I'll love her and fold her to my ould warm heart, and
the daughter of my heart she is now.

Honor. Oh, mother!--for you are my mother now--and happy I am to have a mother in you.

Mr. Carv. I protest it makes me almost--almost--blow my nose.
Catty. Why, then, you're a good cratur. But who tould you I was a
vixen, dear--plase your honour?

Mr. Carv. Your friend that is gone.

Catty.
O'Blaney?

Randal. Frind! He never was frind to none--least of all
to hisself.

Catty. Oh! the double-distilled villain!--he tould your
honour I was a vixen, and fond of law. Now would you believe what
I'm going to till you? he tould me of his honour--

Mr. Carv. Of me,
his patron?

Catty. Of you, his patron, sir. He tould me your honour--which
is a slander, as we all here can witness, can't we? by his honour's
contempt of Pat Coxe--yet O'Blaney said you was as fond and proud
of having informers about you as a rat-catcher is of rats.

Mr. Carv.
Mistress Catherine Rooney, and all you good people,--there is a great
deal of difference between obtaining information and encouraging common
informers.

Catty. There is, I'm sinsible. (Aside to her son) Then
he's a good magistrate--except a little pompous, mighty good. (Aloud
to Mr. CARVER) Then I beg your honour's pardon for my bad behaviour,
and bad language and all. 'Twas O'Blaney's fau't--but he's down, and
don't trample on the fallen.

Old McB. Don't defind O'Blaney! Oh!
the villain, to rob me of all my hard arnings. Mrs. Catty, I thank
you as much as a heavy heart can, for you're ginerous; and you, Randal,
for your--

Randal. Is it for loving her, when I can't help it?--who
could?

Old McB. (sighing deeply) But still it goes against the father's
heart to see his child, his pride, go pinnyless out of his house.

Phil.
Then, sir, father dear, I have to tell you she is not pennyless.--But
I would not tell you before, that Randal, and Catty too, might show
themselves what they are. Honor is not pennyless: the three hundred
you gave me to lodge with O'Blaney is safe here. (Opening his pocket-book.)--When
I was going to him with it as you ordered, by great luck, I was stopped
by this very quarrel and riot in Ballynavogue:--he was the original
cause of kicking up the riot, and was summoned before your honour,--and
here's the money.

Old McB. Oh, she's not pinnyless! Well, I never
saw money with so much pleasure, in all my long days, nor could I
think I'd ever live to give it away with half so much satisfaction
as this minute. I here give it, Honor, to Randal Rooney and you:--and
bless ye, child, with the man of your choice, who is mine now.

Mrs.
Carv. He used to twist the
chain round and round the post, to which it was attached until it became quite short and then
pressed with his feet the lower part of the post until he had nearly done the business.

As I have before related, I took photographs of Tom, and succeeded very well. These photographs
I was unwilling to send home, and kept them until I should have completed my whole series of
photographs of African subjects. They are now, unfortunately, lost forever; for they were left
behind in the bush during my hurried retreat from Ashango-land, as will be related in the sequel.

When the last boat which took on board the Captain and the live animals left the shore for
the vessel, I trembled for the safety of the cargo, for the surf was very rough. The negroes,
however, could have managed to get her safely through if they had not been too careful. They
were nervous at having a white man on board, and did not seize the proper moment to pass the
breakers; their hesitation was very near proving fatal, for a huge billow broke over them and
filled the boat. It did not, happily, upset, but they had to return. Captain Berridge thus
escaped with a wetting, and the Potamochoerus and eagles were half drowned. As to poor Tom,
the bath, instead of cooling his courage, made him more violent than ever. He shouted furiously,
and as soon as I opened the door of his cage he pounced on the bystanders, clinging to them
and screaming. A present of a banana, which he ate voraciously, quieted him down, and the passage
was again tried in the afternoon with a better result.

THE CLOUD

By PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY

    I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,
      From the seas and the streams;
    I bear light shade for the leaves when laid
      In their noonday dreams.
    From my wings are shaken the dews that waken
      The sweet buds every one,
    When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,
      As she dances about the sun.
    I wield the flail of the lashing hail,
      And whiten the green plains under;
    And then again I dissolve it in rain,
      And laugh as I pass in thunder.

    I sift the snow on the mountains below,
      And their great pines groan aghast;
    And all the night 'tis my pillow white,
      While I sleep in the arms of the blast.
    Sublime on the towers of my skyey bowers
      Lightning, my pilot, sits,
    In a cavern under is fettered the thunder;
      It struggles and howls by fits.
    Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,
      This pilot is guiding me,
    Lured by the love of the genii that move
      In the depths of the purple sea;
    Over the rills and the crags and the hills,
      Over the lakes and the plains,
    Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,
      The spirit he loves remains;
    And I all the while bask in heaven's blue smile,
      Whilst he is dissolving in rains.

    The sanguine sunrise, with his meteor eyes,
      And his burning plumes outspread,
    Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,
      When the morning star shines dead.
    As, on the jag of a mountain crag
      Which an earthquake rocks and swings,
    An eagle, alit, one moment may sit
      In the light of its golden wings;
    And when sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,
      Its ardors of rest and of love,
    And the crimson pall of eve may fall
      From the depth of heaven above,
    With wings folded I rest on mine airy nest,
      As still as a brooding dove.

    That orbed maiden with white fire laden,
      Whom mortals call the moon,
    Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor
      By the midnight breezes strewn;
    And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,
      Which only the angels hear,
    May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof,
      The stars peep behind her and peer;
    And I laugh to see them whirl and flee,
      Like a swarm of golden bees,
    When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,
      Till the calm rivers, lakes, and seas,
    Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,
      Are each paved with the moon and these.

    I bind the sun's throne with a burning zone,
      And the moon's with a girdle of pearl;
    The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim,
      When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl.
    From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,
      Over a torrent sea,
    Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof,
      The mountains its columns be.
    The triumphal arch, through which I march,
      With hurricane, fire, and snow,
    When the powers of the air are chained to my chair,
      Is the million-colored bow;
    The sphere-fire above its soft colors wove,
      While the moist earth was laughing below.

    I am the daughter of earth and water,
      And the nursling of the sky;
    I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;
      I change, but I cannot die.
    For after the rain, when, with never a stain,
      The pavilion of heaven is bare,
    And the winds and sunbeams, with their convex gleams,
      Build up the blue dome of air,--
    I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,
      And out of the caverns of rain,
    Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,
      I rise and upbuild it again.

BRUTE NEIGHBORS

By HENRY DAVID THOREAU

     NOTE.--The author of this sketch, Henry David Thoreau, who lived
     from 1817 to 1862, was one of the oddest of American men of genius.
     He was educated at Harvard University, but he did not care, in the
     common phrase, to "turn his learning to practical account;" that
     is, save for a short time when he taught school, he did not make it
     earn his living for him. His theory was that life and energy were
     being wasted when a man spent in working more time than he
     absolutely needed to in order to provide himself with necessities;
     and this theory he carried out in his own life. While he lived in
     Concord, he did odd jobs at carpentering, surveying, and gardening,
     and worked for a time at his father's trade of pencil making.
     However, he contended that a man was doing himself an injustice if
     he kept on at that work after he had reached the point where he
     could make no further improvement in his pencils.

     From 1845 to 1847 Thoreau lived as a hermit in a hut which he had
     built on the shore of Walden Pond, and the simple life he led there
     gave him plenty of leisure for the things he liked best--the study
     of nature, the grappling with philosophical problems, and the
     society of friends. The result of the two years at Walden Pond was
     his best book, Walden, or Life in the Woods, a work which is
     distinguished for its peculiarly truthful and sympathetic studies
     of nature.

     Thoreau refused to perform any of the ordinary duties of a citizen;
     he never voted, he never paid taxes. Once he was arrested because
     he refused to pay his taxes, and was thrown into jail; his friends
     remonstrated with him, but still he refused to pay. However, when
     his friends paid the sum he made no objections to accepting his
     release, nor did he in the future make any objections when his
     friends quietly paid his taxes.

     The Pond in Winter and Winter Animals, which are contained in
     this volume, are also from Thoreau.

Why do precisely these objects which we behold make a world? Why has man just these species
of animals for his neighbors; as if nothing but a mouse could have filled this crevice? I suspect
that Pilpay & Co. have put animals to their best use, for they are all beasts of burden, in
a sense, made to carry some portion of our thoughts.

The mice which haunted my house were not the common ones, which are said to have been introduced
into the country, but a wild native kind not found in the village. I sent one to a distinguished
naturalist, and it interested him much. When I was building, one of these had its nest underneath
the house, and before I had laid the second floor, and swept out the shavings, would come out
regularly at lunch time and pick up the crumbs at my feet. It probably had never seen a man
before; and it soon became quite familiar, and would run over my shoes and up my clothes. It
could readily ascend the sides of the room by short impulses, like a squirrel, which it resembled
in its motions. At length, as I leaned with my elbow on the bench one day, it ran up my clothes,
and along my sleeve, and round and round the paper which held my dinner, while I kept the latter
close, and dodged and played at bo-peep with it; and when at last I held still a piece of cheese
between my thumb and finger, it came and nibbled it, sitting in my hand, and afterward cleaned
its face and paws, like a fly, and walked away.

A phoebe soon built in my shed, and a robin for protection in a pine which grew against the
house. In June the partridge (Tetrao umbellus), which is so shy a bird, led her brood past
my windows, from the woods in the rear to the front of my house, clucking and calling to them
like a hen, and in all her behavior proving herself the hen of the woods. The young suddenly
disperse on your approach, at a signal from the mother, as if a whirlwind had swept them away,
and they so exactly resemble the dried leaves and twigs that many a traveler has placed his
foot in the midst of a brood, and heard the whir of the old bird as she flew off, and her anxious
calls and mewing, or seen her trail her wings to attract his attention, without suspecting
their neighborhood. The parent will sometimes roll and spin round before you in such a dishabille,
that you cannot, for a few moments, detect what kind of creature it is. The young squat still
and flat, often running their heads under a leaf, and mind only their mother's directions given
from a distance, nor will your approach make them run again and betray themselves. You may
even tread on them, or have your eyes on them for a minute, without discovering them. I have
held them in my open hand at such a time, and still their only care, obedient to their mother
and their instinct, was to squat there without fear or trembling. So perfect is this instinct,
that once, when I had laid them on the leaves again, and one accidentally fell on its side,
it was found with the rest in exactly the same position ten minutes afterward. They are not
callow like the young of most birds, but more perfectly developed and precocious even than
chickens. The remarkably adult yet innocent expression of their open and serene eyes is very
memorable. All intelligence seems reflected in them. They suggest not merely the purity of
infancy, but a wisdom clarified by experience. Such an eye was not born when the bird was,
but is coeval with the sky it reflects. The woods do not yield another such gem. The traveler
does not often look into such a limpid well. The ignorant or reckless sportsman often shoots
the parent at such a time, and leaves these innocents to fall a prey to some prowling beast
or bird, or gradually mingle with the decaying leaves which they so much resemble. It is said
that when hatched by a hen they will directly disperse on some alarm, and are so lost, for
they never hear the mother's call which gathers them again. These were my hens and chickens.

It is remarkable how many creatures live wild and free though secret in the woods, and still
sustain themselves in the neighborhood of towns, suspected by hunters only. How retired the
otter manages to live there! He grows to be four feet long, as big as a small boy, perhaps
without any human being getting a glimpse of him. I formerly saw the raccoon in the woods behind
where my house is built, and probably still heard their whinnering at night. Commonly I rested
an hour or two in the shade at noon, after planting, and ate my lunch, and read a little by
a spring which was the source of a swamp and of a brook, oozing from under Brister's Hill,
half a mile from my field. The approach to this was through a succession of descending grassy
hollows, full of young pitch pines, into a larger wood about the swamp. There, in a very secluded
and shaded spot, under a spreading white pine, there was yet a clean firm sward to sit on.
I had dug out the spring and made a well of clear gray water, where I could dip up a pailful
without roiling it, and thither I went for this purpose almost every day in midsummer, when
the pond was warmest. Thither, too, the woodcock led her brood, to probe the mud for worms,
flying but a foot above them down the bank, while they ran in a troop beneath; but at last,
spying me, she would leave her young and circle round and round me, nearer and nearer till
within four or five feet, pretending broken wings and legs, to attract my attention, and get
off her young, who would already have taken up their march, with faint wiry peep, single file
through the swamp, as she directed. Or I heard the peep of the young when I could not see the
parent bird. There too the turtledoves sat over the spring, or fluttered from bough to bough
of the soft white pines over my head; or the red squirrel, coursing down the nearest bough,
was particularly familiar and inquisitive. You only need sit still long enough in some attractive
spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit themselves to you by turns.

I was witness to events of a less peaceful character. One day when I went out to my wood pile,
or rather my pile of stumps, I observed two large ants, the one red, the other much larger,
nearly half an inch long, and black, fiercely contending with one another. Having once got
hold they never let go, but struggled and wrestled and rolled on the chips incessantly. Looking
further, I was surprised to find that the chips were covered with such combatants, that it
was not a duellum, but a bellum, a war between two races of ants, the red always pitted against
the black, and frequently two red ones to one black. The legions of these Myrmidons covered
all the hills and vales in my wood yard, and the ground was already strewn with the dead and
dying, both red and black. It was the only battle which I have ever witnessed, the only battlefield
I ever trod while the battle was raging; internecine war; the red republicans on the one hand,
and the black imperialists on the other. On every side they were engaged in deadly combat,
yet without any noise that I could hear, and human soldiers never fought so resolutely. I watched
a couple that were fast locked in each other's embraces, in a little sunny valley amid the
chips, now at noonday prepared to fight till the sun went down, or life went out. The smaller
red champion had fastened himself like a vise to his adversary's front, and through all the
tumblings on that field never for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the
root, having already caused the other to go by the board; while the stronger black one dashed
him from side to side, and, as I saw on looking nearer, had already divested him of several
of his members. They fought with more pertinacity than bulldogs. Neither manifested the least
disposition to retreat. It was evident that their battle-cry was "Conquer or die." In the meanwhile
there came along a single red ant on the hillside of this valley, evidently full of excitement,
who either had despatched his foe, or had not yet taken part in the battle; probably the latter,
for he had lost none of his limbs; whose mother had charged him to return with his shield or
upon it. Or perchance he was some Achilles, who had nourished his wrath apart, and had now
come to avenge or rescue his Patroclus. He saw this unequal combat from afar--for the blacks
were nearly twice the size of the red--he drew near with rapid pace till he stood on his guard
within half an inch of the combatants; then, watching his opportunity, he sprang upon the black
warrior, and commenced his operations near the root of his right fore-leg, leaving the foe
to select among his own members; and so there were three united for life, as if a new kind
of attraction had been invented which put all other locks and cements to shame. I should not
have wondered by this time to find that they had their respective musical bands stationed on
some eminent chip, and playing their national airs the while, to excite the slow and cheer
the dying combatants. The same to you, sir, and kindly. I beg your pardon for not knowing--would
it be the drum-major, sir?

Mr. H. No offence, my gude lass; I am Andrew Hope, and drum-major. I met some of my men in the
street coming down, and they told me they could not have beds here.

Biddy. No, sir, plase your honour, only five that's in the room yonder: if you'd be plased to walk
up, and you'll get your dinner immediately, your honour, as fast as can be dished, your honour.

Mr.
H. No hurry, my gude lass. But I would willingly see the beds for my poor fellows, that has had
a sair march.

Biddy. Why then, if your honour would take a fool's advice, you'd not be looking at them beds,
to be spoiling your dinner--since, good or bad, all the looking at 'em in the wide world won't
mend 'em one feather, sure.

Mr. H. My gude girl, that's true. Still I'd like ever to face the worst.

Biddy. Then it's up that ladder you'll go.

Mr. H. No stairs?

Biddy. Oh, there are stairs--but they are burnt and coming down, and you'll find the ladder
safest and best; only mind the little holes in the floor, if you plase, your honour.

[Mr. HOPE ascends the ladder while she speaks, and goes into the bedchamber above.

BIDDY, sola.

Well, I'm ashamed of my life, when a stranger and foreigner's reviewing our house, though I'm
only the girl in it, and no ways answerable. It frets me for my country forenent them Scotch and
English. (Mr. HOPE descends the ladder.) Then I'm sorry it's not better for your honour's self,
and men. But there's a new inn to be opened the 25th, in this town; and if you return this way,
I hope things will be more agreeable and proper. But you'll have no bad dinner, your honour, any way;--there's
Scotch broth, and Scotch hash, and fried eggs and bacon, and a turkey, and a boiled leg of
mutton and turnips, and pratees the best, and well boiled; and I hope, your honour, that's
enough for a soldier's dinner, that's not nice.

Mr. H. Enough for a soldier's dinner! ay, gude truth, my lass; and more than enough for Andrew
Hope, who is no ways nice. But, tell me, have you no one to help you here, to dress all this?

Biddy. Sorrow one, to do a hand's turn for me but myself, plase your honour; for the daughter
of the house is too fine to put her hand to any thing in life: but she's in the room there within,
beyond, if you would like to see her--a fine lady she is!

Mr. H. A fine lady, is she? Weel, fine or coarse, I shall like to see her,--and weel I may and must,
for I had a brother once I luved as my life; and four years back that brother fell sick here,
on his road to the north, and was kindly tended here at the inn at Bannow; and he charged me,
puir lad, on his death-bed, if ever fate should quarter me in Bannow, to inquire for his gude
friends at the inn, and to return them his thanks; and so I'm fain to do, and will not sleep till I've
done so.--But tell me first, my kind lassy,--for I see you are a kind lassy,--tell me, has
not this house had a change of fortune, and fallen to decay of late?
for the inn at Bannow was pictured to me as a bra' neat place.

Biddy.
Ah! that was, may-be, the time the Larkens had it?

Mr. H. The Larkens!--that
was the very name: it warms my heart to hear the sound of it.

Biddy.
Ay, and quite another sort of an inn this was, I hear talk, in their
time,--and quite another guess sort, the Larkens from these Gallaghers.

Mr.
H. And what has become of the Larkens, I pray?

Biddy. They are still
living up yonder, by the bush of Bannow, in a snug little place of
a cabin--that is, the Widow Kelly.

Mr. H. Kelly!--but I am looking
for Larken.

Biddy. Oh, Larken! that's Kelly: 'tis all one--she was
a Kelly before she was married, and in this country we stick to the
maiden's name throughout.

Mr. H. The same in our country--often.

Biddy.
Indeed! and her daughter's name is Mabel, after the Kellys; for you
might have noticed, if it ever happened your honour to hear it, an
ould song of Mabel Kelly--Planxty Kelly. Then the present Mabel is
as sweet a cratur as ever the ould Mabel Kelly was--but I must mind
the pratees. (She goes to lift a pot off the fire.)

Mr. H. Hold!
my gude girl, let me do that for you; mine is a strong haund.

Biddy.
I thank your honour,--it's too much trouble entirely for a jantleman
like you; but it's always the best jantleman has the laste pride.--Then
them Kellys is a good race, ould and young, and I love 'em, root and
branch. Besides Mabel the daughter, there's Owen the son, and as good
a son he is--no better! He got an edication in the beginning, till
the troubles came across his family, and the boy, the child, for it's
bare fifteen he is this minute, give up all his hopes and prospects,
the cratur! to come home and slave for his mother. A few years before
I lived in the woods there was what was called a "winged cat" in one of the farmhouses in Lincoln
nearest the pond, Mr. Gilian Baker's. When I called to see her in June, 1842, she was gone
a-hunting in the woods, as was her wont (I am not sure whether it was a male or female, and
so use the more common pronoun), but her mistress told me that she came into the neighborhood
a little more than a year before, in April, and was finally taken into their house; that she
was of a dark brownish gray color, with a white spot on her throat, and white feet, and had
a large bushy tail like a fox; that in the winter the fur grew thick and flatted out along
her sides, forming strips ten or twelve inches long by two and a half wide, and under her chin
like a muff, the upper side loose, the under matted like felt, and in the spring these appendages
dropped off. They gave me a pair of her "wings," which I keep still. There is no appearance
of a membrane about them. Some thought it was part flying-squirrel or some other wild animal,
which is not impossible, for, according to naturalists, prolific hybrids have been produced
by the union of the marten and domestic cat. This would have been the right kind of cat for
me to keep, if I had kept any; for why should not a poet's cat be winged as well as his horse?

In the fall the loon (Colymbus glacialis) came, as usual, to moult and bathe in the pond, making
the woods ring with his wild laughter before I had risen. At rumor of his arrival all the Milldam
sportsmen are on the alert, in gigs and on foot, two by two and three by three, with patent
rifles and conical balls and spyglasses. They come rustling through the woods like autumn leaves,
at least ten men to one loon. Some station themselves on this side of the pond, some on that,
for the poor bird cannot be omnipresent; if he dive here he must come up there. But now the
kind October wind rises, rustling the leaves and rippling the surface of the water, so that
no loon can be heard or seen, though his foes sweep the pond with spyglasses, and make the
woods resound with their discharges. The waves generally rise and dash angrily, taking sides
with all waterfowl, and our sportsmen must beat a retreat to town and shop and unfinished jobs.
But they were too often successful. When I went to get a pail of water early in the morning
I frequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a few rods. If I endeavored
to overtake him in a boat, in order to see how he would manoeuvre, he would dive and be completely
lost, so that I did not discover him again sometimes till the latter part of the day. But I
was more than a match for him on the surface. He commonly went off in a rain.

As I was paddling along the north shore one very calm October afternoon, for such days especially
they settle on to the lakes, like the milkweed down, having looked in vain over the pond for
a loon, suddenly one, sailing out from the shore toward the middle a few rods in front of me,
set up his wild laugh and betrayed himself. I pursued with a paddle and he dived, but when
he came up I was nearer than before. He dived again, but I miscalculated the direction he would
take, and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface this time, for I had helped
to widen the interval; and again he laughed long and loud, and with more reason than before.

He manoeuvred so cunningly that I could not get within half a dozen rods of him. Each time,
when he came to the surface, turning his head this way and that, he coolly surveyed the water
and the land, and apparently chose his course so that he might come up where there was the
widest expanse of water, and at the greatest distance from the boat. It was surprising how
quickly he made up his mind and put his resolve into execution. He led me at once to the widest
part of the pond, and could not be driven from it. While he was thinking one thing in his brain,
I was endeavoring to divine his thought in mine. It was a pretty game, played on the smooth
surface of the pond, a man against a loon. Suddenly your adversary's checker disappears beneath
the board, and the problem is to place yours nearest to where his will appear again. Sometimes
he would come up unexpectedly on the opposite side of me, having apparently passed directly
under the boat. So long-winded was he and so unweariable, that when he had swum furthest he
would immediately plunge again, nevertheless; and then no wit could divine where in the deep
pond, beneath the smooth surface, he might be speeding his way like a fish, for he had time
and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in its deepest part.

It is said that loons have been caught in the New York lakes eighty feet beneath the surface,
with hooks set for trout--though Walden is deeper than that. How surprised must the fishes
be to see this ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding his way amid their schools! Yet
he appeared to know his course as surely under water as on the surface, and swam much faster
there. Once or twice I saw a ripple where he approached the surface, just put his head out
to reconnoitre, and instantly dived again. I found that it was as well for me to rest on my
oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where he would rise; for again and
again, when I was straining my eyes over the surface one way, I would suddenly be startled
by his unearthly laugh behind me. But why, after displaying so much cunning, did he invariably
betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh? Did not his white breast enough betray
him? He was indeed a silly loon, I thought. I could commonly hear the splash of the water when
he came up, and so also detected him. But after an hour he seemed as fresh as ever, dived as
willingly and swam yet further than at first. It was surprising to see how serenely he sailed
off with unruffled breast when he came to the surface, doing all the work with his webbed feet
beneath. His usual note was this demoniac laughter, yet somewhat like that of a waterfowl;
but occasionally, when he had balked me most successfully and come up a long way off, he uttered
a long-drawn unearthly howl, probably more like that of a wolf than any bird; as when a beast
puts his muzzle to the ground and deliberately howls. This was his looming--perhaps the wildest
sound that is ever heard here, making the woods ring far and wide. I concluded that he laughed
in derision of my efforts, confident of his own resources. Though the sky was by this time
overcast, the pond was so smooth that I could see where he broke the surface when I did not
hear him. His white breast, the stillness of the air, and the smoothness of the water were
all against him. At length, having come up fifty rods off, he uttered one of those prolonged
howls, as if calling on the god of loons to aid him, and immediately there came a wind from
the east and rippled the surface, and filled the whole air with misty rain, and I was impressed
as if it were the prayer of the loon answered, and his god was angry with me; and so I left
him disappearing far away on the tumultuous surface.

ODE TO A SKYLARK

By PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY

     NOTE.--There are a few places in the United States where the
     skylark has been naturalized, but most of us have never heard it
     sing. In Europe, however, and especially in Great Britain, it is
     very common; and despite the fact that it is dull of plumage, there
     are few birds which are more universally loved. For the song which
     it pours forth as it soars upward in spiral curves and floats in
     the air is wonderfully sweet and cheerful. Strangely enough, this
     bird, which seems to like best to sing when far, far above the
     earth, does not refuse to sing when confined in a cage.

          Hail to thee, blithe spirit!--
            Bird thou never wert--
          That from heaven, or near it,
            Pourest thy full heart
    In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.

          Higher still and higher
            From the earth thou springest
          Like a cloud of fire;
            The blue deep thou wingest,
    And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.

          In the golden lightning
            Of the sunken sun,
          O'er which clouds are brightening,
            Thou dost float and run;
    Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.

          The pale purple even
            Melts around thy flight;
          Like a star of heaven
            In the broad day-light,
    Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight.

          Keen as are the arrows
            Of that silver sphere
          Whose intense lamp narrows
            In the white dawn clear,
    Until we hardly see, we feel that it is there.

          All the earth and air
            With thy voice is loud,
          As, when night is bare,
            From one lonely cloud
    The moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflowed.

          What thou art we know not;
            What is most like thee?
          From rainbow clouds there flow not
            Drops so bright to see.
    As from thy presence showers a rain of melody.

          Like a poet hidden
            In the light of thought,
          Singing hymns unbidden,
            Till the world is wrought
    To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not;

          Like a high-born maiden
            In a palace tower,
          Soothing her love-laden
            Soul in secret hour
    With music sweet as love, which overflows her bower:

          Like a glowworm golden
            In a dell of dew,
          Scattering unbeholden
            Its aërial hue
    Among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view:

          Like a rose embowered
            In its own green leaves,
          By warm winds deflowered,
            Till the scent it gives
    Makes faint with too much sweet these heavy-winged thieves.

          Sound of vernal showers
            On the twinkling grass,
          Rain-awakened flowers,
            All that ever was
    Joyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass.

          Teach us, sprite or bird,
            What sweet thoughts are thine:
          I have never heard
            Praise of love or wine
    That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.

          Chorus Hymenæal,
            Or triumphal chaunt,
          Matched with thine would be all
            But an empty vaunt,
    A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.

          What objects are the fountains
            Of thy happy strain?
          What fields, or waves, or mountains?
            What shapes of sky or plain?
    What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?

          With thy clear, keen joyance
            Languor cannot be:
          Shadow of annoyance
            Never came near thee:
    Thou lovest; but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.

          Waking or asleep,
            Thou of death must deem
          Things more true and deep
            Than we mortals dream,
    Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream!

          We look before and after,
            And pine for what is not;
          Our sincerest laughter
            With some pain is fraught;
    Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.

          Yet if we could scorn
            Hate, and pride, and fear;
          If we were things born
            Not to shed a tear,
    I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.

          Better than all measures
            Of delightful sound,
          Better than all treasures
            That in books are found,
    Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!

          Teach me half the gladness
            That thy brain must know,
          Such harmonious madness
            From my lips would flow,
    The world should listen then, as I am listening now!

THE POND IN WINTER

By HENRY DAVID THOREAU

After a still winter night I awoke with the impression that some question had been put to me,
which I had been endeavoring in vain to answer in my sleep, as what--how--when--where? But
there was dawning Nature, in whom all creatures live, looking in at my broad windows with serene
and satisfied face, and no question on her lips. I awoke to an answered question, to Nature
and daylight. The snow lying deep on the earth dotted with young pines, and the very slope
of the hill on which my house is placed, seemed to say, Forward! Nature puts no question and
answers none which we mortals ask. She has long ago taken her resolution. "O Prince, our eyes
contemplate with admiration and transmit to the soul the wonderful and varied spectacle of
this universe. The night veils without doubt a part of this glorious creation; but day comes
to reveal to us this great work, which extends from earth even into the plains of the ether."

Then to my morning work. First I take an axe and pail and go in search of water if that be
not a dream. After a cold and snowy night it needed a divining rod to find it. Every winter
the liquid and trembling surface of the pond, which was so sensitive to every breath, and reflected
every light and shadow, becomes solid to the depth of a foot or a foot and a half, so that
it will support the heaviest teams, and perchance the snow covers it to an equal depth, and
it is not to be distinguished from any level field. Like the marmots in the surrounding hills,
it closes its eyelids and becomes dormant for three months or more. Standing on the snow-covered
plain, as if in a pasture amid the hills, I cut my way first through a foot of snow, and then
a foot of ice, and open a window under my feet, where, kneeling to drink, I look down into
the quiet parlor of the fishes, pervaded by a softened light as through a window of ground
glass, with its bright sanded floor the same as in summer; there a perennial waveless serenity
reigns as in the amber twilight sky, corresponding to the cool and even temperament of the
inhabitants. Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.

Early in the morning, while all things are crisp with frost, men come with fishing reels and
slender lunch, and let down their fine lines through the snowy field to take pickerel and perch;
wild men, who instinctively follow other fashions and trust other authorities than their townsmen,
and by their goings and comings stitch towns together in parts where else they would be ripped.
They sit and eat their luncheon in stout fearnaughts on the dry oak leaves on the shore, as
wise in natural lore as the citizen is in artificial. They never consulted with books, and
know and can tell much less than they have done. The things which they practice are said not
yet to be known. Here is one fishing for pickerel with grown perch for bait. You look into
his pail with wonder as into a summer pond, as if he kept summer locked up at home, or knew
where she had retreated. How, pray, did he get these in mid-winter? Oh, he got worms out of
rotten logs since the ground froze, and so he caught them. His life itself passes deeper in
Nature than the studies of naturalist penetrate; himself a subject for the naturalist. The
latter raises the moss and bark gently with his knife in search of insects; the former lays
open logs to their core with his axe, and moss and bark fly far and wide. He gets his living
by barking trees. Such a man has some right to fish, and I love to see Nature carried out in
him. The perch swallows the grubworm, the pickerel swallows the perch, and the fisherman swallows
the pickerel; and so all the chinks in the scale of being are filled.

When I strolled around the pond in misty weather I was sometimes amused by the primitive mode
which some ruder fisherman had adopted. He would perhaps have placed alder branches over the
narrow holes in the ice, which were four or five rods apart and an equal distance from the
shore, and having fastened the end of the line to a stick to prevent its being pulled through,
have passed the slack line over a twig of the alder, a foot or more above the ice, and tied
a dry oak leaf to it, which, being pulled down, would show when he had a bite. These alders
loomed through the mist at regular intervals as you walked halfway round the pond.

Ah, the pickerel of Walden! when I see them lying on the ice, or in the well which the fisherman
cuts in the ice, making a little hole to admit the water, I am always surprised by their rare
beauty, as if they were fabulous fishes, they are so foreign to the streets, even to the woods,
foreign as Arabia to our Concord life. They possess a quite dazzling and transcendent beauty
which separates them by a wide interval from the cadaverous cod and haddock whose fame is trumpeted
in our streets. They are not green like the pines, nor any gray like the stones, nor blue like
the sky; but they have, to my eyes, if possible, yet rarer colors, like flowers and precious
stones, as if they were the pearls, the animalized nuclei or crystals of the Walden water.
They, of course, are Walden all over and all through; are themselves small Waldens in the animal
kingdom, Waldenses. It is surprising that they are caught here--that in this deep and capacious
spring, far beneath the rattling teams and chaises and tinkling sleighs that travel the Walden
road, this great gold and emerald fish swims. I never chanced to see its kind in any market;
it would be the cynosure of all eyes there. Easily, with a few conclusive quirks, they give
up their watery ghosts, like a mortal translated before his time to the thin air of heaven.

SALMON FISHING

By RUDYARD KIPLING

California and I, crying for salmon, reached Portland, and the real-estate man to whom I had
been intrusted by "Portland" the insurance man, met us in the street saying that fifteen miles
away, across country, we should come upon a place called Clackamas where we might perchance
find what we desired. And California, his coat-tails flying in the wind, ran to a livery stable
and chartered a wagon and team forthwith. I could push the wagon about with one hand, so light
was its structure. The team was purely American--that is to say, almost human in its intelligence
and docility. Some one said that the roads were not good on the way to Clackamas and warned
us against smashing the springs. "Portland," who had watched the preparations, finally reckoned
"he'd come along, too," and under heavenly skies we three companions of a day set forth; California
carefully lashing our rods into the carriage, and the bystanders overwhelming us with directions
as to the sawmills we were to pass, the ferries we were to cross, and the signposts we were
to seek signs from. Half a mile from this city of fifty thousand souls we struck (and this
must be taken literally), a plank road that would have been a disgrace to an Irish village.

Then six miles of macadamized road showed us that the team could move. A railway ran between
us and the banks of the Willamette, and another above us through the mountains. All the land
was dotted with small townships, and the roads were full of farmers in their town wagons, bunches
of tow-haired, boggle-eyed urchins sitting in the hay behind. The men generally looked like
loafers, but their women were all well dressed. Brown hussar braiding on a tailor-made jacket
does not, however, consort with hay wagons. Then we struck into the woods along what California
called a "camina reale,"--a good road,--and Portland a "fair track." It wound in and out among
fire-blackened stumps, under pine trees, along the corners of log-fences, through hollows which
must be hopeless marsh in winter, and up absurd gradients. But nowhere throughout its length
did I see any evidence of road-making. There was a track,--you couldn't well get off it,--and
it was all you could do to stay on it. The dust lay a foot thick in the blind ruts, and under
the dust we found bits of planking and bundles of brushwood that sent the wagon bounding into
the air. Sometimes we crashed through bracken; anon where the blackberries grew rankest we
found a lonely little cemetery, the wooden rails all awry, and the pitiful stumpy headstones
nodding drunkenly at the soft green mulleins. Then with oaths and the sound of rent underwood
a yoke of mighty bulls would swing down a "skid" road, hauling a forty-foot log along a ready
made slide.

A valley full of wheat and cherry trees succeeded, and halting at a house we bought ten pound
weight of luscious black cherries for something less than a rupee and got a drink of icy-cold
water for nothing, while the untended team browsed sagaciously by the roadside. Once we found
a wayside camp of horse dealers lounging by a pool, ready for a sale or a swap, and once two
sun-tanned youngsters shot down a hill on Indian ponies, their full creels banging from their
high-pommeled saddles. They had been fishing, and were our brethren therefore. We shouted aloud
in chorus to scare a wild cat; we squabbled over the reasons that had led a snake to cross
a road; we heaved bits of bark at a venturesome chipmunk, who was really the little gray squirrel
of India and had come to call on me; we lost our way and got the wagon so beautifully fixed
on a steep road that we had to tie the two hind-wheels to get it down. Above all, California
told tales of Nevada and Arizona, of lonely nights spent out prospecting, of the slaughter
of deer and the chase of men; of woman, lovely woman, who is a firebrand in a western city,
and leads to the popping of pistols, and of the sudden changes and chances of fortune, who
delights in making the miner or the lumberman a quadruplicate millionaire, and in "busting"
the railroad king. That was a day to be remembered, and it had only begun when we drew rein
at a tiny farmhouse on the banks of the Clackamas and sought horse-feed and lodging ere we
hastened to the river that broke over a weir not over a quarter of a mile away.

Imagine a stream seventy yards broad divided by a pebbly island, running over seductive riffles
and swirling into deep, quiet pools where the good salmon goes to smoke his pipe after meals.
Set such a stream amid fields of breast-high crops surrounded by hills of pine, throw in where
you please quiet water, log-fenced meadows, and a hundred foot bluff to keep the scenery from
growing too monotonous, and you will get some faint notion of the Clackamas.

Portland had no rod. He held the gaff and the whiskey. California sniffed, upstream and downstream
across the racing water, chose his ground, and let the gaudy spoon drop in the tail of a riffle.
I was getting my rod together when I heard the joyous shriek of the reel and the yells of California,
and three feet of shining silver leaped into the air far across the water. The forces were
engaged. The salmon tore up-stream, the tense line cutting the water like a tide-rip behind
him, and the light bamboo bowed to breaking. What happened after I cannot tell. California
swore and prayed, and Portland shouted advice, and I did all three for what appeared to be
half a day, but was in reality a little over a quarter of an hour, and sullenly our fish came
home with spurts of temper, dashes head-on, and sarabands in the air; but home to the bank
came he, and the remorseless reel gathered up the thread of his life inch by inch. We landed
him in a little bay, and the spring weight checked him at eleven and a half pounds. Eleven
and a half pounds of fighting salmon! We danced a war dance on the pebbles, and California
caught me around the waist in a hug that went near to breaking my ribs, while he shouted: "Partner!
Partner! This is glory! Now you catch your fish! Twenty-four years I've waited for this!"

I went into that icy-cold river and made my cast just above a weir, and all but foul-hooked
a blue and black water-snake with a coral mouth who coiled herself on a stone and hissed maledictions.
The next cast--ah, the pride of it, the regal splendor of it! the thrill that ran down from
finger-tip to toe! The water boiled. He broke for the fly and got it! There remained enough
sense in me to give him all he wanted when he jumped not once but twenty times before the upstream
flight that ran my line out to the last half-dozen turns, and I saw the nickeled reelbar glitter
under the thinning green coils. My thumb was burned deep when I strove to stopper the line,
but I did not feel it till later, for my soul was out in the dancing water praying for him
to turn ere he took my tackle away. The prayer was heard. As I bowed back, the butt of the
rod on my left hip-bone and the top joint dipping like unto a weeping willow, he turned, and
I accepted each inch of slack that I could by any means get in as a favor from on high. There
be several sorts of success in this world that taste well in the moment of enjoyment, but I
question whether the stealthy theft of line from an able-bodied salmon who knows exactly what
you are doing and why you are doing it is not sweeter than any other victory within human scope.
Like California's fish, he ran at me head-on and leaped against the line, but the Lord gave
me two hundred and fifty pairs of fingers in that hour. The banks and the pine trees danced
dizzily around me, but I only reeled as for life--reeled for hours, and at the end of the reeling
continued to give him the butt while he sulked in a pool. California was farther up the reach,
and with the corner of my eye I could see him casting with long casts and much skill. Then
he struck, and my fish broke for the weir at the same instant, and down the reach went California
and I, reel answering reel, even as the morning stars sung together.

The first wild enthusiasm of capture had died away. We were both at work now in deadly earnest
to prevent the lines fouling, to stall off a downstream rush for deep water just above the
weir, and at the same time to get the fish into the shallow bay downstream that gave the best
practicable landing. Portland bade us both be of good heart, and volunteered to take the rod
from my hands. I would rather have died among the pebbles than surrender the right to play
and land my first salmon, weight unknown, on an eight-ounce rod. I heard California, at my
ear it seemed, gasping: "He's a fighter from Fightersville, sure!" as his fish made a fresh
break across the stream. I saw Portland fall off a log fence, break the overhanging bank, and
clatter down to the pebbles all sand and landing net, and I dropped on a log to rest for a moment.

As I drew breath the weary hands slackened their hold, and I forgot to give him the butt. A
wild scutter in the water, a plunge and a break for the head-waters of the Clackamas was my
reward, and the hot toil of reeling-in with one eye under the water and the other on the top
joint of the rod, was renewed. Worst of all, I was blocking California's path to the little
landing bay aforesaid, and he had to halt and tire his prize where he was. "The father of all
salmon!" he shouted. "For the love of heaven, get your trout to bank, Johnny Bull." But I could
do no more. Even the insult failed to move me. The rest of the game was with the salmon. He
suffered himself to be drawn, skipping with pretended delight at getting to the haven where
I fain would have him. Yet no sooner did he feel shoal water under his ponderous belly than
he backed like a torpedo boat, and the snarl of the reel told me that my labor was in vain.
A dozen times at least this happened ere the line hinted that he had given up the battle and
would be towed in. He was towed. The landing net was useless for one of his size, and I would
not have him gaffed. I stepped into the shallows and heaved him out with a respectful hand
under the gill, for which kindness he battered me about the legs with his tail, and I felt
the strength of him and was proud. California had taken my place in the shallows, his fish
hard held. I was up on the bank lying full length on the sweet-scented grass, gasping in company
with my first salmon caught, played, and landed on an eight-ounce rod. My hands were cut and
bleeding. I was dripping with sweat, spangled like harlequin with scales, wet from the waist
down, nose peeled by the sun, but utterly, supremely, and consummately happy. He, the beauty,
the daisy, the darling, my Salmon Bahadur, weighed twelve pounds, and I had been seven and
thirty minutes bringing him to bank! He had been lightly hooked on the angle of the right jaw,
and the hook had not wearied him. That hour I sat among princes and crowned heads--greater
than them all. Below the bank we heard California scuffling with his salmon, and swearing Spanish
oaths. Portland and I assisted at the capture, and the fish dragged the spring-balance out
by the roots. It was only constructed to weigh up to fifteen pounds. We stretched the three
fish on the grass,--the eleven-and-a-half, the twelve, and the fifteen-pounder, and we swore
an oath that all who came after should merely be weighed and put back again.

How shall I tell the glories of that day so that you may be interested? Again and again did
California and I prance down that little reach to the little bay, each with a salmon in tow,
and land him in the shallows. Then Portland took my rod, and caught some ten-pounders, and
my spoon was carried away by an unknown leviathan. Each fish, for the merits of the three that
had died so gamely, was hastily hooked on the balance and flung back, Portland recording the
weight in a pocketbook, for he was a real-estate man. Each fish fought for all he was worth,
and none more savagely than the smallest--a game little six-pounder. At the end of six hours
we added up the list. Total: 16 fish, aggregate weight, 142 lbs. The score in detail runs something
like this--it is only interesting to those concerned: 15, 11-1/2, 12, 10, 9-3/4, 8, and so
forth; as I have said, nothing under six pounds, and three ten-pounders.

Very solemnly and thankfully we put up our rods--it was glory enough for all time--and returned
weeping in each other's arms--weeping tears of pure joy--to that simple, barelegged family
in the packing-case house by the waterside.

WINTER ANIMALS

By HENRY DAVID THOREAU

When the ponds were firmly frozen, they afforded not only new and shorter routes to many points,
but new views from their surfaces of the familiar landscape around them. When I crossed Flint's
Pond, after it was covered with snow, though I had often paddled about and skated over it,
it was so unexpectedly wide and so strange that I could think of nothing but Baffin's Bay.
The Lincoln hills rose up around me at the extremity of a snowy plain, in which I did not remember
to have stood before; and the fishermen, at an indeterminable distance over the ice, moving
slowly about with their wolfish dogs, passed for sealers or Esquimaux, or in misty weather
loomed like fabulous creatures, and I did not know whether they were giants or pygmies. I took
this course when I went to lecture in Lincoln in the evening, traveling in no road and passing
no house between my hut and the lecture room. In Goose Pond, which lay in my way, a colony
of muskrats dwelt, and raised their cabins high above the ice, though none could be seen abroad
when I crossed it. Walden, being like the rest usually bare of snow, or with only shallow and
interrupted drifts on it, was my yard, where I could walk freely when the snow was nearly two
feet deep on a level elsewhere and the villagers were confined to their streets. There, far
from the village street, and, except at very long intervals, from the jingle of sleigh bells,
I slid and skated, as in a vast moose-yard well trodden, overhung by oak woods and solemn pines
bent down with snow or bristling with icicles.

For sounds in winter nights, and often in winter days, I heard the forlorn but melodious note
of a hooting owl indefinitely far; such a sound as the frozen earth would yield if struck with
a suitable plectrum, the very lingua vernacula of Walden Wood, and quite familiar to me at
last, though I never saw the bird while it was making it. I seldom opened my door in a winter
evening without hearing; Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer hoo, sounded sonorously, and the first three syllables
accented somewhat like how der do; or sometimes hoo hoo only. One night in the beginning of
winter, before the pond froze over, about nine o'clock, I was startled by the loud honking
of a goose, and, stepping to the door, heard the sound of their wings like a tempest in the
woods as they flew low over my house. They passed over the pond toward Fair Haven, seemingly
deterred from settling by my light, their commodore honking all the while with a regular beat.
Suddenly an unmistakable cat-owl from very near me, with the most harsh and tremendous voice
I ever heard from any inhabitant of the woods, responded at regular intervals to the goose,
as if determined to expose and disgrace this intruder from Hudson's Bay by exhibiting a greater
compass and volume of voice in a native, and boo-hoo him out of Concord horizon. "What do you
mean by alarming the citadel at this time of night consecrated to me? Do you think I am ever
caught napping at such an hour, and that I have not got lungs and a larynx as well as yourself?
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo!" It was one of the most thrilling discords I ever heard. And yet,
if you had a discriminating ear, there were in it the elements of a concord such as these plains
never saw nor heard.

I also heard the whooping of the ice in the pond, my great bedfellow in that part of Concord,
as if it were restless in its bed and would fain turn over, were troubled with flatulency and
bad dreams; or I was waked by the cracking of the ground by the frost, as if some one had driven
a team against my door, and in the morning would find a crack in the earth a quarter of a mile
long and a third of an inch wide.

Sometimes I heard the foxes as they ranged over the snow crust, in moonlight nights, in search
of a partridge or other game, barking raggedly and demoniacally like forest dogs, as if laboring
with some anxiety, or seeking expression, struggling for light and to be dogs outright and
run freely in the streets; for if we take the ages into our account, may there not be a civilization
going on among brutes as well as men? They seemed to me to be rudimental, burrowing men, still
standing on their defence, awaiting their transformation. Sometimes one came near to my window,
attracted by my light, barked a vulpine curse at me, and then retreated.

Usually the red squirrel (Sciurus Hudsonius) waked me in the dawn, coursing over the roof and
up and down the sides of the house, as if sent out of the woods for this purpose. In the course
of the winter I threw out half a bushel of ears of sweet corn, which had not got ripe, on to
the snow crust by my door, and was amused by watching the motions of the various animals which
were baited by it. In the twilight and the night the rabbits came regularly and made a hearty
meal. All day long the red squirrels came and went, and afforded me much entertainment by their
manoeuvres. One would approach at first warily through the shrub-oaks, running over the snow
crust by fits and starts like a leaf blown by the wind, now a few paces this way, with wonderful
speed and waste of energy, making inconceivable haste with his "trotters," as if it were for
a wager, and now as many paces that way, but never getting on more than half a rod at a time;
and then suddenly pausing with a ludicrous expression and a gratuitous somerset, as if all
the eyes in the universe were fixed on him--for all the motions of a squirrel, even in the
most solitary recesses of the forest, imply spectators as much as those of a dancing girl--wasting
more time in delay and circumspection than would have sufficed to walk the whole distance--I
never saw one walk--and then suddenly, before you could say Jack Robinson, he would be in the
top of a young pitch-pine, winding up his clock and chiding all imaginary spectators, soliloquizing
and talking to all the universe at the same time--for no reason that I could ever detect, or
he himself was aware of, I suspect.

At length he would reach the corn, and selecting a suitable ear, brisk about in the same uncertain
trigonometrical way to the topmost stick of my wood-pile, before my window, where he looked
me in the face, and there sit for hours, supplying himself with a new ear from time to time,
nibbling at first voraciously and throwing the half-naked cobs about; till at length he grew
more dainty still and played with his food, tasting only the inside of the kernel, and the
ear, which was held balanced over the stick by one paw, slipped from his careless grasp and
fell to the ground, when he would look over at it with a ludicrous expression of uncertainty,
as if suspecting that it had life, with a mind not made up whether to get it again, or a new
one, or be off; now thinking of corn, then listening to hear what was in the wind. So the little
impudent fellow would waste many an ear in a forenoon; till at last, seizing some longer and
plumper one, considerably bigger than himself, and skilfully balancing it, he would set out
with it to the woods, like a tiger with a buffalo, by the same zigzag course and frequent pauses,
scratching along with it as if it were too heavy for him and falling all the while, making
its fall a diagonal between a perpendicular and horizontal, being determined to put it through
at any rate--a singularly frivolous and whimsical fellow--and so he would get off with it to
where he lived, perhaps carry it to the top of a pine tree forty or fifty rods distant, and
I would afterward find the cobs strewed about the woods in various directions.

At length the jays arrived, whose discordant screams were heard long before, as they were warily
making their approach an eighth of a mile off; and in a stealthy and sneaking manner they flit
from tree to tree, nearer and nearer, and pick up the kernels which the squirrels have dropped.
Then, sitting on a pitch-pine bough, they attempt to swallow in their haste a kernel which
is too big for their throats and chokes them; and after great labor they disgorge it, and spend
an hour in the endeavor to crack it by repeated blows with their bills. They were manifestly
thieves, and I had not much respect for them; but the squirrels, though at first shy, went
to work as if they were taking what was their own.

Meanwhile also came the chickadees in flocks, which, picking up the crumbs the squirrels had
dropped, flew to the nearest twig, and, placing them under their claws, hammered away at them
with their little bills, as if it were an insect in the bark, till they were sufficiently reduced
for their slender throats. A little flock of these titmice came daily to pick a dinner out
of my wood pile, or the crumbs at my door, with faint flitting lisping notes, like the tinkling
of icicles in the grass, or else with sprightly day day day, or more rarely, in spring-like
days, a wiry summery phe-be from the wood-side. They were so familiar that at length one alighted
on an armful of wood which I was carrying in, and pecked at the sticks without fear. O'BLANEY
alone.

O'Bla. Then I wonder that ould Matthew McBride is not here yet. But is not this Pat Coxe coming up
yonder? Ay. Well, Pat, what success with Catty?

Enter PAT COXE, panting.

Take breath, man alive--What of Catty?

Pat. Catty! Oh, murder! No time to be talking of Catty now! Sure the shupervizor's come to town.

O'Bla.
Blood!--and the malt that has not paid duty in the cellar! Run, for your life, to the back-yard,
give a whistle to call all the boys that's ricking o' the turf, away with 'em to the cellar,
out with every sack of malt that's in it, through the back-yard, throw all into the middle
of the turf-stack, and in the wink of an eye build up the rick over all, snoog (snug).

Pat. I'll engage we'll have it done in a crack. [Exit PAT.

O'Bla. (calling after him) Pat! Pat Coxe! man!

Re-enter PAT.

O'Bla. Would there be any fear of any o' the boys informin?

Pat. Sooner cut their ears off! [Exit PAT.

Enter Old McBRIDE, at the opposite side.

Old McB. (speaking in a slow, drawling brogue) Would Mr. Gerald O'Blaney, the counsellor, be
within?

O'Bla. (quick brogue) Oh, my best friend, Matthew McBride, is it you, dear? Then here's Gerald
O'Blaney, always at your sarvice. But shake hands; for of all men in Ireland, you are the man
I was aching to lay my eyes on. And in the fair did ye happen to meet Carver of Bob's Fort?

Old
McB. (speaking very slowly) Ay. did I--and he was a-talking to me, and I was a-talking to him--and
he's a very good gentleman, Mr. Carver of Bob's Fort--so he is--and a gentleman that knows
how things should be; and he has been giving of me, Mr. O'Blaney,
a great account of you, and how you're thriving in the world--and
so as that.

O'Bla. Nobody should know that better than Mr. Carver of Bob's Fort--he knows all my affairs. He is
an undeniable honest gentleman, for whom I profess the highest regard.

Old McB. Why then he has a great opinion of you too, counsellor--for he has been advising of,
and telling of me, O'Blaney, of your proposhal, sir--and very sinsible I am of the honour done
by you to our family, sir--and condescension to the likes of us--though, to be sure, Honor McBride,
though she is my daughter, is a match for any man.

O'Bla. Is a match for a prince--a Prince Ragent even. So no more about condescension, my good Matthew,
for love livels all distinctions.

Old McB. That's very pretty of you to say so, sir; and I'll repeat it to Honor.

O'Bla. Cupid is the great liveller, after all, and the only democrat Daity on earth I'd bow to--for
I know you are no democrat, Mr. McBride, but quite and clane the contrary way.

Old McB. Quite and clane and stiff, I thank my God; and I'm glad, in spite of the vowel before
your name, Mr. O'Blaney, to hear you are of the same kidney.

O'Bla. I'm happy to find myself agreeable to you, sir.

Old McB. But, however agreeable to me, as I won't deny, it might be, sir, to see my girl made
into a gentlewoman by marriage, I must observe to you--

O'Bla. And I'll keep her a jaunting car to ride about the country; and in another year, as my
fortune's rising, my wife should rise with it into a coach of her own.

Old McB. Oh! if I'd live to see my child, my Honor, in a coach of
her own!

I'd be too happy--oh, I'd die contint!

O'Bla. (aside) No fear!--(Aloud) And why should not she ride in her own coach, Mistress Counsellor
O'Blaney, and look out of the windows down upon the Roonies, that have the insolence to look
up to her?

Old McB. Ah! you know that, then. That's all that's against us, sir, in this match.

O'Bla. But if you are against Randal, no fear.

Old McB. I am against him--that is, against his family, and all his seed, breed, and generation.
But I would not break my daughter's heart if I could help it.

O'Bla. Wheugh!--hearts don't break in these days, like china.

Old McB.

This is my answer, Mr. O'Blaney, sir: you have my lave, but you must have hers too.

O'Bla. I would not fear to gain that in due time, if you would stand my friend in forbidding her
the sight of Randal.

Old McB. I will with pleasure, that--for tho' I won't force her to marry to plase me, I'll forbid
her to marry to displase me; and when I've said it, whatever it is, I'll be obeyed. (Strikes his
stick on the ground.)

O'Bla. That is all I ax.

Old McB. But now what settlement, counshillor, will you make on my girl?

O'Bla. A. hundred a year--I wish to be liberal--Mr. Carver will see to that--he knows all my affairs,
as I suppose he was telling you.

Old McB. He was--I'm satisfied, and I'm at a word myself always. You heard me name my girl's portion,
sir?

O'Bla. I can't say--I didn't mind--'twas no object to me in life.

Old McB. (in a very low, mysterious tone, and slow brogue) Then five hundred guineas is some
object to most men.

O'Bla. Certainly, sir; but not such an object as your daughter to me: since we are got upon business,
however, best settle all that out of the way, as you say at once. Of the five hundred, I have
two in my hands already, which you can make over to me with a stroke of a pen. (Rising quickly, and
getting pen, ink, and books.)

Old McB. (speaking very slowly) Stay a hit--no hurry--in life. In business--'tis always most haste,
worse speed.

O'Bla. Take your own time, my good Matthew--I'll be as slow as you plase--only love's quick.

Old
McB. Slow and sure--love and all--fast bind, fast find--three and two, what does that make?

O'Bla. It used to make five before I was in love.

Old McB. And will the same after you're married and dead. What am I thinking of? A score of bullocks
I had in the fair--half a score sold in my pocket, and owing half--that's John Dolan, twelve pound
tin--and Charley Duffy nine guineas and thirteen tin pinnies and a five-penny bit: stay, then, put
that to the hundred guineas in the stocking at home.

O'Bla. (aside) How he makes my mouth water: (Aloud) May be, Matthew, I could, that am used to
it, save you the trouble of counting?

Old McB. No trouble in life to me ever to count my money--only I'll trouble you, sir, if you
please, to lock that door; bad to be chinking and spreading money with doors open, for walls has
ears and eyes.

O'Bla. True for you. (Rising, and going to lock the doors.)

[Old McBRIDE with great difficulty, and very slowly, draws out of his pocket his bag of money--looking
first at one door, and then at the other, and going to try whether they are locked, before
he unties his bag.]

Old McB. (spreads and counts his money and notes) See me now, I wrote on some scrap somewhere 59l.
in notes--then hard cash, twinty pounds--rolled up silver and gould, which is scarce--but of
a hundred pounds there's wanting fourteen pounds odd, I think, or something that way; for Phil
and I had our breakfast out of a one pound note of Finlay's, and I put the change somewhere--besides
a riband for Honor, which make a deficiency of fourteen pounds seven shillings and two pence--that's
what's deficient--count it which way you will.

O'Bla. (going to sweep the money off the table) Oh! never mind the deficiency--I'll take it for
a hundred plump.

Old McB. (stopping him) Plump me no plumps--I'll have it exact, or not at all--I'll not part it, so
let me see it again.

O'Bla. (aside with a deep sigh, almost a groan) Oh! when I had had it in my fist--almost: but
'tis as hard to get money out of this man as blood out of a turnip;
and I'll be lost to-night without it.

Old McB. 'Tis not exact--and I'm exact: I'll put it all up again--(he puts it deliberately into
the bag again, thrusting the bag into his pocket)--I'll make it up at home my own way, and
send it in to you by Phil in an hour's time; for I could not sleep sound with so much in my
house--bad people about--safer with you in town. Mr. Carver says, you are as good as the Bank
of Ireland--there's no going beyond that. (Buttoning up his pockets.) So you may unlock the doors
and let me out now--I'll send Phil with all to you, and you'll give him a bit of a receipt
or a token, that would do.

O'Bla. I shall give a receipt by all means--all regular: short accounts make long friends.
(Unlocks the door.)

Old McB. True, sir, and I'll come in and see about the settlements in the morning, if Honor is
agreeable.

O'Bla. I shall make it my business to wait upon the young lady myself on the wings of love;
and I trust I'll not find any remains of Randal Rooney in her head.

Old McB. Not if I can help it, depend on that.

(They shake hands.)

O'Bla. Then, fare ye well, father-in-law--that's meat and drink to me: would not ye take a
glass of wine then?

Old McB. Not a drop--not a drop at all--with money about me: I must be in a hurry home.

O'Bla.

That's true--so best: recommind me kindly to Miss Honor, and say a great dale about my impatience--and
I'll be expicting Phil, and won't shut up till he comes the night.

Old McB. No, don't; for he'll be with you before night-fall. [Exit McBRIDE.

O'Bla. (calling) Dan! open the door, there: Dan! Joe! open the door smart for Mr. McBride!
(O'BLANEY rubbing his hands.) Now I think I may pronounce myself made for life--success to my parts!--and
here's Pat too! Well, Pat Coxe, what news of the thing in hand?

Enter PAT COXE.

Pat. Out of hand clane! that job's nately done. The turf-rick, sir, 's built up cliver, with the malt
snug in the middle of its stomach--so were the shupervishor a conjuror even, barring he'd dale
with the ould one, he'd never suspict a sentence of it.

O'Bla. Not he--he's no conjuror: many's the dozen tricks I played him afore now.
Pat. But, counshillor, there's the big veshel in the little passage--I
got a hint from a friend, that the shuper got information of the spirits
in that from some villain.

O'Bla. And do you think I don't know a
trick for that, too?

Pat. No doubt: still, counshillor, I'm in dread
of my life that that great big veshel won't be implied in a hurry.

O'Bla.
Won't it? but you'll see it will, though; and what's more, them spirits
will turn into water for the shupervisor.

Pat. Water! how?

O'Bla.
Asy--the ould tan-pit that's at the back of the distillery.

Pat.
I know--what of it?

O'Bla. A sacret pipe I've got fixed to the big
veshel, and the pipe goes under the wall for me into the tan-pit,
and a sucker I have in the big veshel, which I pull open by a string
in a crack, and lets all off all clane into the tan-pit.

Pat. That's
capital!--but the water?

O'Bla. From the pump, another pipe--and
the girl's pumping asy, for she's to wash to-morrow, and knows nothing
about it; and so the big veshel she fills with water, wondering what
ails the water that it don't come--and I set one boy and another to
help her--and the pump's bewitched, and that's all:--so that's settled.

Pat.
And cliverly. Oh! counshillor, we are a match for the shuper any day
or night.

O'Bla. For him and all his tribe, coursing officers and
all. I'd desire no better sport than to hear the whole pack in full
cry after me, and I doubling, and doubling, and safe at my form at
last. With you, Pat, my precious, to drag the herring over the ground
previous to the hunt, to distract the scent, and defy the nose of
the dogs.

Pat. Then I am proud to sarve you, counshillor.

O'Bla.
I know you are, and a very honest boy. And what did you do for me,
with Catty Rooney?

Pat. The best.--Oh! it's I blarny'd Catty to the
skies, and then egged her on, and aggravated her against the McBrides,
till I left her as mad as e'er a one in Bedlam--up to any thing! And
full tilt she's off to Flaherty's, the publican, in her blue jock--where
she'll not be long afore she kicks up a quarrel, I'll engage; for
she's sarching the house for Honor McBride, who is not in it--and
giving bad language, I warrant, to all the McBride faction, who is
in it, drinking. Oh! trust Catty's tongue for breeding a riot! In
half an hour, I'll warrant, you'll have as fine a fight in town as
ever ye seen or hard.

O'Bla. That's iligantly done, Pat. But I hope
Randal Rooney is in it?

Pat. In the thick of it he is, or will be.
So I hope your honour did not forgit to spake to Mr. Carver about
that little place for me?

O'Bla. Forgit!--Do I forgit my own name,
do you think? Sooner forgit that then my promises.

Pat. Oh! I beg
your honour's pardon--I would not doubt your word; and to make matters
sure, and to make Catty cockahoop, I tould her, and swore to her,
there was not a McBride in the town but two, and there's twinty, more
or less.

O'Bla. And when she sees them twinty, more or less, what
will she think?--Why would you say that?--she might find you out in
a lie next minute, Mr. Overdo. 'Tis dangerous for a young man to be
telling more lies than is absolutely requisite. The lie superfluous
brings many an honest man, and, what's more, many a cliver fellow,
into a scrape--and that's your great fau't, Pat.

Pat. Which, sir?

O'Bla.
That, sir. I don't see you often now take a glass too much. But, Pat,
I hear you often still are too apt to indulge in a lie too much.

Pat.
Lie! Is it I?--Whin upon my conscience, I niver to my knowledge tould
a lie in my life, since I was born, excipt it would be just to skreen
a man, which is charity, sure,--or to skreen myself, which is self-defence,
sure--and that's lawful; or to oblige your honour, by particular desire,
and that can't be helped, I suppose.

O'Bla. I am not saying again
all that--only (laying his hand on PAT'S shoulder as he is going out)
against another time, all I'm warning you, young man, is, you're too
apt to think there never can be lying enough. Now too much of a good
thing is good for nothing. [Exit O'BLANEY.

PAT, alone.

Pat. There's
what you may call the divil rebuking sin--and now we talk of the like,
as I've heard my mudther say, that he had need of a long spoon that
ates wid the divil--so I'll look to that in time. But whose voice
is that I hear coming up stairs? I don't believe but it's Mr. Carver--only
what should bring him back agin, I wonder now? Here he is, all out
of breath, coming.

Enter Mr. CARVER.

Mr. Carv. Pray, young man,
did you happen to see--(panting for breath) Bless me, I've ridden
so fast back from Bob's Fort!

Pat. My master, sir, Mr. O'Blaney,
is it? Will I run?

Mr. Carv. No, no--stand still till I have breath.--What
I want is a copy of a letter I dropped some where or other--here I
think it must have been, when I took out my handkerchief--a copy of
a letter to his Excellency--of great consequence. (Mr. CARVER sits
down and takes breath.)

Pat. (searching about with officious haste)
If it's above ground, I'll find it. What's this?--an old bill: that
is not it. Would it be this, crumpled up?--"To His Excellency the
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland."

Mr. Carv. (snatching) No farther, for
your life!

Pat. Well then I was lucky I found it, and proud.

Mr.
Carv. And well you may be, young man; for I can assure you, on this
letter the fate of Ireland may depend. (Smoothing the letter on his
knee.)

Pat. I wouldn't doubt it--when it's a letter of your honour's--I
know your honour's a great man at the castle. And plase your honour,
I take this opportunity of tanking your honour for the encouragement
I got about that little clerk's place--and here's a copy of my hand-writing
I'd wish to show your honour, to see I'm capable--and a scholard.

Mr.
Carv. Hand-writing! Bless me, young man, I have no time to look at
your hand-writing, sir. With the affairs of the nation on my shoulders--can
you possibly think?--is the boy mad?--that I've time to revise every
poor scholar's copy-book?

Pat. I humbly beg your honour's pardon,
but it was only becaase I'd wish to show I was not quite so unworthy
to be under (whin you've time) your honour's protection, as promised.

Mr.
Carv. My protection?--you are not under my protection, sir:--promised
clerk's place?--I do not conceive what you are aiming at, sir.

Pat.
The little clerk's place, plase your honour--that my master, Counshillor
O'Blaney, tould me he spoke about to your honour, and was recommending
me for to your honour.

Mr. Carv. Never--never heard one syllable
about it, till this moment.

Pat. Oh! murder:--but I expict your honour's
goodness will--

Mr. Carv. To make your mind easy, I promised to appoint
a young man to that place, a week ago, by Counsellor O'Blaney's special
recommendation. So there must be some mistake.

[Exit Mr. CARVER.]

PAT,
alone.

Pat. Mistake? ay, mistake on purpose. So he never spoke! so
he lied!--my master that was praching me! And oh, the dirty lie he
tould me! Now I can't put up with that, when I was almost perjuring
myself for him at the time. Oh, if I don't fit him for this! And he
got the place given to another!--then I'll git him as well sarved,
and out of this place too--seen-if-I-don't! He is cunning enough,
but I'm cuter nor he--I have him in my power, so I have! and I'll
give the shupervizor a scent of the malt in the turf-stack--and a
hint of the spirits in the tan-pit--and it's I that will like to stand
by innocent, and see how shrunk O'Blaney's double face will look forenent
the shupervizor, when all's found out, and not a word left to say,
but to pay--ruined hand and foot! Then that shall be, and before nightfall.
Oh! one good turn desarves another--in revenge, prompt payment while
you live!

[Exit.]

SCENE II.

McBRIDE'S Cottage.

MATTHEW McBRIDE
and HONOR. (MATTHEW with a little table before him, at dinner.)

Old
McB. (pushing his plate from him) I'll take no more--I'm done. [He
sighs.]

Honor. Then you made but a poor dinner, father, after being
at the fair, and up early, and all!--Take this bit from my hands,
father dear.

Old McB. (turning away sullenly) I'll take nothing from
you, Honor, but what I got already enough--and too much of--and that's
ungratitude.

Honor. Ungratitude, father! then you don't see my heart.

Old
McB. I lave that to whoever has it, Honor: 'tis enough for me, I see
what you do--and that's what I go by.

Honor. Oh, me! and what did
I do to displase you, father? This case is not like the last one, where the tree has provided
food and shelter for the ants, but rather one where the ant has taken possession of the tree,
and brought with it the scale insects; but I believe that its presence must be beneficial.
I have cut into some dozens of the trumpet trees, and never could find one that was not tenanted
by ants. I noticed three different species, all, as far as I know, confined to the trumpet
tree, and all farming scale insects. As in the bull's-horn thorn, there is never more than
one species of ant on the same tree.

In some species of evergreen shrub there is a direct provision of houses for the ants. In each
leaf, at the base of the laminæ, the petiole, or stalk, is furnished with a couple of pouches,
divided from each other by the midrib. Into each of these pouches there is an entrance from
the lower side of the leaf. I noticed them first in Northern Brazil, in the province of Maranham;
and afterwards at Para. Every pouch was occupied by a nest of small black ants; and if the
leaf was shaken ever so little, they would rush out and scour all over it in search of the
aggressor. I must have tested some hundreds of leaves, and never shook one without the ants
coming out, excepting one sickly-looking plant at Para. In many of the pouches I noticed the
eggs and young ants, and in some I saw a few dark-colored scale insects or plant lice; but
my attention had not been at that time directed to the latter as supplying the ants with food,
and I did not examine a sufficient number of pouches to determine whether they were constant
occupants of the nests or not; but my experience since with the trumpet trees would lead me
to expect that they were. If so, we have an instance of two insects and a plant living together,
and all benefited by the companionship. The leaves of the plant are guarded by the ants; the
ants are provided with houses by the plant, and food by the scale insects and plant lice; and
the latter are effectually protected by the ants in their common habitation.

Amongst the numerous plants that do not provide houses, but attract ants to their leaves and
flower buds by means of glands secreting a honey-like liquid, are many orchids, and I think
all the species of passion flowers. I had the common red passion flower growing over the front
on my verandah, where it was continually under my notice. It had honey-secreting glands on
its young leaves and on the sepals of the flower buds. For two years I noticed that the glands
were constantly attended by a small ant, and, night and day, every young leaf and every flower
bud had a few on them. They did not sting, but attacked and bit my finger when I touched the
plant. I have no doubt that the primary object of these honey-glands was to attract the ants,
and keep them about the most tender and vulnerable parts of the plant, to prevent them being
injured; and I further believe that one of the principal enemies that they serve to guard against
in tropical America is the leaf-cutting ant, as I have noticed that the latter are very much
afraid of the small black ants.

On the third year after I had noticed the attendance of the ants on my passion flower, I found
that the glands were not so well looked after as before, and soon discovered that a number
of scale insects had established themselves on the stems, and that the ants had in a great
measure transferred their attentions to them. An ant would stand over a scale insect and stroke
it alternately on each side with its antennas, whereupon every now and then a clear drop of
honey would exude from a pore on the back of the scale insect and be imbibed by the ant. Here
it was clear that the scale insect was competing successfully with the leaves and sepals for
the attendance and protection of the ants, and was successful either through the fluid it furnished
being more attractive or more abundant. I have, from these facts, been led to the conclusion
that the use of honey-secreting glands in plants is to attract insects that will protect the
flower buds and leaves from being injured by herbivorous insects and mammals; but I do not
mean to infer that this is the use of all glands, for many of the small appendicular bodies,
called "glands" by botanists, do not secrete honey. The common dog-rose of England is furnished
with glands on the stipules, and in other species they are more numerous, until in the wild
rose of the northern counties the leaves are thickly edged, and the fruit and sepals covered
with stalked glands. I have only observed the wild roses in the north of England, but there
I have never seen insects attending the glands. These glands, however, do not secrete honey;
but a dark, resinous, sticky liquid, that probably is useful by being distasteful to both insects
and mammals.

THE FAMILY OF MICHAEL AROUT[314-1]

From the French of EMILE SOUVESTRE

September 15th, Eight O'clock.--This morning, while I was arranging my books, Mother Genevieve
came in and brought me the basket of fruit I buy of her every Sunday. For nearly twenty years
that I have lived in this quarter I have dealt in her little fruit shop. Perhaps I should be
better served elsewhere, but Mother Genevieve has but little custom; to leave her would do
her harm and cause her unnecessary pain. It seems to me that the length of our acquaintance
has made me incur a sort of tacit obligation to her; my patronage has become her property.

She has put the basket upon my table, and as I wanted her husband, who is a joiner, to add
some shelves to my bookcase, she has gone downstairs again immediately to send him to me.

At first I did not notice either her looks or the sound of her voice; but, now that I recall
them, it seems to me that she was not as jovial as usual. Can Mother Genevieve be in trouble
about anything?

Poor woman! All her best years were subject to such bitter trials that she might think she
had received her full share already. Were I to live a hundred years I should never forget the
circumstances which first made her known to me and which obtained her my respect.

It was at the time of my first settling in the faubourg. I had noticed her empty fruit shop,
which nobody came into, and being attracted by its forsaken appearance I made my little purchases
in it. I have always instinctively preferred the poor shops; there is less choice in them,
but it seems to me that my purchase is a sign of sympathy with a brother in poverty. These
little dealings are almost always an anchor of hope to those whose very existence is in peril--the
only means by which some orphan gains a livelihood. There the aim of the tradesman is not to
enrich himself, but to live! The purchase you make of him is more than an exchange--it is a
good action.

Mother Genevieve at that time was still young, but had already lost that fresh bloom of youth
which suffering causes to wither so soon among the poor. Her husband, a clever joiner, gradually
left off working to become, according to the picturesque expression of the workshops, "a worshipper
of Saint Monday." The wages of the week, which was always reduced to two or three working days,
were completely dedicated by him to the worship of this god of the Barriers,[315-2] and Genevieve
was obliged herself to provide for all the wants of the household.

One evening, when I went to make some trifling purchases of her, I heard a sound of quarreling
in the back shop. There were the voices of several women, among which I distinguished that
of Genevieve, broken by sobs. On looking further in, I perceived the fruit-woman with a child
in her arms, and kissing it, while a country nurse seemed to be claiming her wages from her.
The poor woman, who without doubt had exhausted every explanation and every excuse, was crying
in silence, and one of her neighbors was trying in vain to appease the countrywoman. Excited
by that love of money which the evils of a hard peasant life but too well excuse, and disappointed
by the refusal of her expected wages, the nurse was launching forth in recriminations, threats,
and abuse. In spite of myself, I listened to the quarrel, not daring to interfere, and not
thinking of going away, when Michael Arout appeared at the shop door.

The joiner had just come from the Barrier, where he had passed part of the day at the public-house.
His blouse, without a belt, and untied at the throat, showed none of the noble stains of work;
in his hand he held his cap, which he had just picked up out of the mud; his hair was in disorder,
his eye fixed, and the pallor of drunkenness in his face. He came reeling in, looked wildly
around him, and called Genevieve.

She heard his voice, gave a start, and rushed into the shop; but at the sight of the miserable
man, who was trying in vain to steady himself, she pressed the child in her arms and bent over
it with tears.

The countrywoman and the neighbor had followed her.

"Come! come! do you intend to pay me, after all?" cried the former in a rage.

"Ask the master for the money," ironically answered the woman from the next door, pointing
to the joiner, who had just fallen against the counter.

The countrywoman looked at him.

"Ah! he is the father," returned she. "Well, what idle beggars! not to have a penny to pay
honest people, and get tipsy with wine in that way."

The drunkard raised his head.

"What! what!" stammered he; "who is it that talks of wine? I've had nothing but brandy! But
I am going back again to get some wine! Wife, give me your money; there are some friends waiting
for me at the wine shop."

Genevieve did not answer; he went round the counter, opened the till, and began to rummage in it.

"You see where the money of the house goes!" observed the neighbor to the countrywoman; "how
can the poor unhappy woman pay you when he takes all?"

"Is that my fault?" replied the nurse angrily. "They owe it to me and somehow or other they
must pay me!"

And letting loose her tongue, as those women out of the country do, she began relating at length
all the care she had taken of the child and all the expense it had been to her. In proportion
as she recalled all she had done, her words seemed to convince her more than ever of her rights
and to increase her anger. The poor mother, who no doubt feared that her violence would frighten
the child, returned into the back shop and put it into its cradle.

Whether it is that the countrywoman saw in this act a determination to escape her claims, or
that she was blinded by passion, I cannot say; but she rushed into the next room, where I heard
the sounds of quarreling, with which the cries of the child were soon mingled. The joiner,
who was still rummaging in the till, was startled and raised his head.

At the same moment Genevieve appeared at the door, holding in her arms the baby that the countrywoman
was trying to tear from her. She ran toward the counter, and throwing herself behind her husband
cried:

"Michael, defend your son!"

The drunken man quickly stood up erect, like one who awakes with a start.

"My son!" stammered he; "what son?"

His looks fell upon the child; a vague ray of intelligence passed over his features.

"Robert," resumed he; "it is Robert!"

He tried to steady himself on his feet, that he might take the baby, but he tottered. The nurse
approached him in a rage.

"My money, or I shall take the child away!" cried she. "It is I who have fed and brought it
up: if you don't pay me for what has made it live, it ought to be the same to you as if it
were dead. I shall not go until I have my due or the baby."

"And what would you do with him?" murmured Genevieve, pressing Robert against her bosom.

"Take it to the Foundling!" replied the countrywoman harshly; "the hospital is a better mother
than you are, for it pays for the food of its little ones."

At the word "Foundling," Genevieve had exclaimed aloud in horror. With her arms wound round
her son, whose head she hid in her bosom, and her two hands spread over him, she had retreated
to the wall, and remained with her back against it, like a lioness defending her young ones.
The neighbor and I contemplated this scene, without knowing how we could interfere. As for
Michael, he looked at us by turns, making a visible effort to comprehend it all. When his eye
rested upon Genevieve and the child, it lit up with a gleam of pleasure; but when he turned
toward us, he again became stupid and hesitating.

At last, apparently making a prodigious effort, he cried out, "Wait!"

And going to a tub full of water, he plunged his face into it several times.

Every eye was turned upon him; the countrywoman herself seemed astonished. At length he raised
his dripping head. This ablution had partly dispelled his drunkenness; he looked at us for
a moment, then he turned to Genevieve, and his face brightened up.

"Robert!" cried he, going up to the child and taking him in his arms. "Ah! give him me, wife;
I must look at him."

The mother seemed to give up his son to him with reluctance, and stayed before him with her
arms extended, as if she feared the child would have a fall. The nurse began again in her turn
to speak, and renewed her claims, this time threatening to appeal to law. At first Michael
listened to her attentively, and when he comprehended her meaning he gave the child back to
its mother.

"How much do we owe you?" asked he.

The countrywoman began to reckon up the different expenses, which amounted to nearly 30 francs.
The joiner felt to the bottom of his pockets, but could find nothing. His forehead became contracted
by frowns; low curses began to escape him. All of a sudden he rummaged in his breast, drew
forth a large watch, and holding it up above his head--

"Here it is--here's your money!" cried he with a joyful laugh; "a watch, number one! I always
said it would keep for a drink on a dry day; but it is not I who will drink it, but the young
one. Ah! ah! ah! go and sell it for me, neighbor, and if that is not enough, I have my earrings.
Eh! Genevieve, take them off for me; the earrings will square all! They shall not say you have
been disgraced on account of the child--no, not even if I must pledge a bit of my flesh! My
watch, my earrings, and my ring--get rid of all of them for me at the goldsmith's; pay the
woman and let the little fool go to sleep. Give him me, Genevieve; I will put him to bed."

And taking the baby from the arms of his mother, he carried him with a firm step to his cradle.

It was easy to perceive the change which took place in Michael from this day. He cut all his
old drinking acquaintances. He went early every morning to his work, and returned regularly
in the evening to finish the day with Genevieve and Robert. Very soon he would not leave them
at all, and he hired a place near the fruit shop and worked in it on his own account.

They would soon have been able to live in comfort, had it not been for the expenses which the
child required. Everything was given up to his education. He had gone through the regular school
training, had studied mathematics, drawing, and the carpenter's trade, and had only begun to
work a few months ago. Till now, they had been exhausting every resource which their laborious
industry could provide to push him forward in his business; but, happily, all these exertions
had not proved useless; the seed had brought forth its fruits, and the days of harvest were
close by.

While I was thus recalling these remembrances to my mind, Michael had come in and was occupied
in fixing shelves where they were wanted.

During the time I was writing the notes of my journal, I was also scrutinizing the joiner.

The excesses of his youth and the labor of his manhood have deeply marked his face; his hair
is thin and gray, his shoulders stooping, his legs shrunken and slightly bent. There seems
a sort of weight in his whole being. His very features have an expression of sorrow and despondency.
He answered my questions by monosyllables, and like a man who wishes to avoid conversation.
From whence is this dejection, when one would think he had all he could wish for? I should
like to know!

Ten O'clock.--Michael is just gone downstairs to look for a tool he has forgotten. I have at
last succeeded in drawing from him the secret of his and Genevieve's sorrow. Their son Robert
is the cause of it!

Not that he has turned out ill after all their care--not that he is idle and dissipated; but
both were in hopes he would never leave them any more. The presence of the young man was to
have renewed and made glad their lives once more; his mother counted the days, his father prepared
everything to receive their dear associate in their toils; and at the moment when they were
thus about to be repaid for all their sacrifices, Robert had suddenly informed them that he
had just engaged himself to a contractor at Versailles.

Every remonstrance and every prayer were useless; he brought forward the necessity of initiating
himself into all the details of an important contract, the facilities he should have in his
new position of improving himself in his trade, and the hopes he had of turning his knowledge
to advantage. At last, when his mother, having come to the end of her arguments, began to cry,
he hastily kissed her and went away that he might avoid any further remonstrances.

He had been absent a year, and there was nothing to give them hopes of his return. His parents
hardly saw him once a month, and then he only stayed a few moments with them.

"I have been punished where I had hoped to be rewarded," Michael said to me just now. "I had
wished for a saving and industrious son, and God has given me an ambitious and avaricious one!
I had always said to myself that when once he was grown up we should have him always with us,
to recall our youth and to enliven our hearts. His mother was always thinking of getting him
married and having children again to care for. You know women always will busy themselves about
others. As for me, I thought of him working near my bench and singing his new songs; for he
has learned music and is one of the best singers at the Orphéon. A dream, sir, truly! Directly
the bird was fledged, he took to flight, and remembers neither father nor mother. Yesterday,
for instance, was the day we expected him; he should have come to supper with us. No Robert
to-day either! He has had some plan to finish, or some bargain to arrange, and his old parents
are put down last in the accounts, after the customer's and the joiner's work. Ah! if I could
have guessed how it would have turned out! Fool! to have sacrificed my likings and my money,
for nearly twenty years, to the education of a thankless son! Was it for this I took the trouble
to cure myself of drinking, to break with my friends, to become an example to the neighborhood?
The jovial good fellow has made a goose of himself. Oh! if I had to begin again! No, no! you
see women and children are our bane. They soften our hearts; they lead us a life of hope and
affection; we pass a quarter of our lives in fostering the growth of a grain of corn which
is to be everything to us in our old age, and when the harvest-time comes--good night, the
ear is empty!"

While he was speaking, Michael's voice became hoarse, his eye fierce, and his lips quivered.
I wished to answer him, but I could only think of commonplace consolations, and I remained
silent. The joiner pretended he wanted a tool and left me.

Poor father! Ah! I know those moments of temptation when virtue has failed to reward us and
we regret having obeyed her! Who has not felt this weakness in hours of trial, and who has
not uttered, at least once, the mournful exclamation of Brutus?

But if virtue is only a word, what is there then in life which is true and real? No, I will
not believe that goodness is in vain! It does not always give the happiness we had hoped for,
but it brings some other. In the world everything is ruled by order and has its proper and
necessary consequences, and virtue cannot be the sole exception to the general law. If it had
been prejudicial to those who practice it, experience would have avenged them; but experience
has, on the contrary, made it more universal and more holy. We only accuse it of being a faithless
debtor because we demand an immediate payment, and one apparent to our senses. We always consider
life as a fairy tale, in which every good action must be rewarded by a visible wonder. We do
not accept as payment a peaceful conscience, self-content, or a good name among men--treasures
that are more precious than any other, but the value of which we do not feel till after we
have lost them!

Michael is come back and returned to his work. His son had not yet arrived.

By telling me of his hopes and his grievous disappointments, he became excited; he unceasingly
went over again the same subject, always adding something to his griefs. He has just wound
up his confidential discourse by speaking to me of a joiner's business which he had hoped to
buy and work to good account with Robert's help. The present owner had made a fortune by it,
and after thirty years of business he was thinking of retiring to one of the ornamental cottages
in the outskirts of the city, a usual retreat for the frugal and successful workingman. Michael
had not indeed the 2,000 francs which must be paid down; but perhaps he could have persuaded
Master Benoit to wait. Robert's presence would have been a security for him, for the young
man could not fail to insure the prosperity of a workshop; besides science and skill, he had
the power of invention and bringing to perfection. His father had discovered among his drawings
a new plan for a staircase, which had occupied his thoughts for a long time; and he even suspected
him of having engaged himself to the Versailles contractor for the very purpose of executing
it. The youth was tormented by this spirit of invention, and while devoting his mind to study
he had not time to listen to his feelings.

Michael told me all this with a mixed feeling of pride and vexation. I saw he was proud of
the son he was abusing, and that his very pride made him more sensible of that son's neglect.

Six O'clock P. M.--I have just finished a happy day. How many events have happened within a
few hours, and what a change for Genevieve and Michael!

He had just finished fixing the shelves and telling me of his son, while I laid the cloth for
my breakfast.

Suddenly we heard hurried steps in the passage, the door opened, and Genevieve entered with
Robert. The joiner gave a start of joyful surprise, but he repressed it immediately, as if
he wished to keep up the appearance of displeasure.

The young man did not appear to notice it, but threw himself into his arms in an open-hearted
manner which surprised me. Genevieve, whose face shone with happiness, seemed to wish to speak,
and to restrain herself with difficulty.

I told Robert I was glad to see him, and he answered me with ease and civility.

"I expected you yesterday," said Michael Arout rather dryly.

"Forgive me, father," replied the young workman, "but I had business at St. Germain's. I was
not able to come back till it was very late, and then the master kept me."

The joiner looked at his son sideways, and then took up his hammer again.

"All right," muttered he in a grumbling tone; "when we are with other people we must do as
they wish; but there are some who would like better to eat brown bread with their own knife
than partridges with the silver fork of a master."

"And I am one of those, father," replied Robert merrily; "but, as the proverb says, 'you must
shell the peas before you can eat them.' It was necessary that I should first work in a great
workshop--"

"To go on with your plan of the staircase," interrupted Michael, ironically.

"You must now say M. Raymond's plan, father," replied Robert, smiling.

"Why?"

"Because I have sold it to him."

The joiner, who was planing a board, turned round quickly.

"Sold it!" cried he, with sparkling eyes.

"For the reason that I was not rich enough to give it him."

Michael threw down the board and tool.

"There he is again!" resumed he angrily; "his good genius puts an idea into his head which
would have made him known, and he goes and sells it to a rich man, who will take all the honor
of it himself."

"Well, what harm is there done?" asked Genevieve.

"What harm!" cried the joiner in a passion. "You understand nothing about it--you are a woman;
but he--he knows well that a true workman never gives up his own inventions for money, no more
than a soldier would give up his cross. That is his glory; he is bound to keep it for the honor
it does him! Ah! thunder! if I had ever made a discovery, rather than put it up at auction
I would have sold one of my eyes! Don't you see that a new invention is like a child to a workman?
He takes care of it, he makes a way for it in the world, and it is only poor creatures who
sell it."

Robert colored a little.

"You will think differently, father," said he, "when you know why I sold my plan."

"Yes, and you will thank him for it," added Genevieve, who could no longer keep silence.

"Never!" replied Michael.

"But, wretched man!" cried she, "he only sold it for our sakes!"

The joiner looked at his wife and son with astonishment. The latter related how he had entered
into a negotiation with Master Benoit, who had positively refused to sell his business unless
one-half of the 2,000 francs were first paid down. It was in the hopes of obtaining this sum
that he had gone to work with the contractor at Versailles; he had had an opportunity of trying
his invention and of finding a purchaser. Thanks to the money he received for it, he had just
concluded the bargain with Benoit, and had brought his father the key of the new work-yard.

This explanation was given by the young workman with so much modesty and simplicity that I
was quite affected by it. Genevieve cried; Michael pressed his son to his heart, and seemed
to ask his pardon for having unjustly accused him.

All was now explained with honor to Robert. The conduct which his parents had ascribed to indifference
really sprang from affection; he had neither obeyed the voice of ambition nor of avarice, nor
even the nobler inspiration of inventive genius; his whole motive and single aim had been the
happiness of Genevieve and Michael. The day for proving his gratitude had come, and he had
returned them sacrifice for sacrifice!

After the explanation and exclamations of joy were over, all three were about to leave me;
but the cloth being laid, I added three more places, and kept them to breakfast.

The meal was prolonged: the fare was only tolerable, but the overflowings of affection made
it delicious. Never had I better understood the unspeakable charm of family love. What calm
enjoyment in that happiness which is always shared with others; in that community of interests
which unites such various feeling; in that association of existences which forms one single
being of so many! What is man without those home affections which, like so many roots, fix
him firmly in the earth and permit him to imbibe all the juices of life? Energy, happiness--does
it not all come from them? Without family life where would man learn to love, to associate,
to deny himself? A community in little, is it not this which teaches us how to live in the
great one? Such is the holiness of home, that to express our relation with God we have been
obliged to borrow the words invented for our family life. Men have named themselves the sons
of a heavenly Father!

Ah! let us carefully preserve these chains of domestic union; do not let us unbind the human
sheaf and scatter its ears to all the caprices of chance and of the winds; but let us rather
enlarge this holy law; let us carry the principles and the habits of home beyond its bounds;
and, let us realize the prayer of the Apostle of the Gentiles when he exclaimed to the new-born
children of Christ:

"Be ye like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind."

ON THE RECEIPT OF MY MOTHER'S PICTURE

By WILLIAM COWPER

INTRODUCTORY NOTE

Before we read this beautiful little poem, let us prepare ourselves by learning something about
the author.

William Cowper, the son of an English clergyman, was born in 1731. He was a delicate, sensitive
little boy whose life was made miserable by his companions in play and at school. So timid
was he that the larger boys tyrannized over him shamefully, and the smaller ones teased him
as much as they liked. When his mother died, William was but six years old, and the shrinking
little lad was placed in a large boarding school where the other boys were cruel and heartless.
At least, so they seemed to the frightened newcomer. Probably they were no more cruel and heartless
than most strong and healthy youngsters who are accustomed to give and take without whimpering.
Young Cowper was merely the strange lad whose timid and hesitating manner seemed to call for
discipline. Years afterwards, still remembering the agony of these years, he wrote of one big
boy in particular.

"His savage treatment of me impressed such a dread of his figure upon my mind that I well remember
of being afraid to lift my eyes up higher than to his knees, and that I knew him better by
his shoe-buckles than by any other part of his dress."

At ten he was removed to Westminster School, where he made some good friends. Here, too, he
took a more manly stand, played football and cricket with the other boys, and redeemed himself
from some of his weakness. But he had numerous spells of moodiness and sadness, during which
he hid himself from his fellows and refused to join their plays even. He was unusually intelligent,
distinguished himself in his studies, and became a favorite with his teachers.

Among his friends here was Warren Hastings, who long years afterwards, as governor of India,
was convicted of cruelty and extortion. Cowper showed the loyalty of his nature by refusing
utterly to believe in the guilt of his old friend.

William's father wished to make a lawyer of his son, and when the boy had finished at Westminster
he was sent to study law in London. If he had been unhappy in school, he became even more so
now, for there was nothing in the legal profession to attract him. Instead of reading law he
read literature; instead of writing legal papers he wrote poems and sketches. Finally, however,
he became a lawyer, but he could never bring himself to practice his profession.

At one time he was given a clerkship, but in preparation for it he was asked to take an examination
before the bar at the House of Lords. Here his old nervousness and timidity overpowered him,
and he failed to appear; in fact, he ran away, planning to kill himself, but at the last moment
his courage again failed him. After this, his mind gave way, and he was for a time in an asylum.
In fact, at intervals thereafter, he had attacks of despondency and moodiness, of fear and
discouragement, which showed how seriously his mind was affected.

So far this is not a very attractive picture; but it is one side of the great poet's character.
That there was another we knew, for he made the most loyal friends, who opened their homes
to him and were ever willing to care for him.

At one time he was engaged to be married, but an attack of insanity prevented the union, though
it did not destroy the ardent friendship of the lovers. Cowper could never wholly throw off
the fear of the future. "Day and night," he once wrote, "I was upon the rack, lying down in
horror and rising up in despair."

His most attached friends, the Unwins, were deeply religious people, and at their house Cowper
spent his happiest years. It was a great shock to him when Mr. Unwin was thrown from a horse
and killed. From that time a succession of kind friends aided him, watched him through his
periods of despair and provided for his simple wants. He was passionately fond of pets, and
was happiest in caring for his rabbits, cats and other animals. He liked gardening, too, and
spent a great deal of energy upon his plants.

Cowper was one of the finest correspondents that ever wrote, and his graceful and humorous
letters are still read with pleasure by all who know them. Strangely enough, his gloominess
rarely found its way into his poetry, which often was highly amusing, as you know who have
read John Gilpin. The Task is his greatest poem, though there are many short ones of great beauty.

Cowper was sincere and honest, and used good judgment in everything that did not concern himself.
Occasionally he became dissatisfied with the style of poetry then most popular, because it
was written so strictly according to rule and because heart and nature were all forgotten.
What he wrote was different; putting his truthful eyes on birds and flowers, on fine scenery
and on noble men and women, he wrote exactly as he saw, and let his fine sentiment and loving
heart find gracious expression. The result was that he led the way for Wordsworth, the greater
man, who brought our poetry back from the bonds of formality and made it beautiful, sincere
and true.

The final years of Cowper were sad ones. Mrs. Unwin was stricken with paralysis, and the poet
repaid her years of care and protection by an unfailing attention that lasted till she died.
It is said that after the one heart-breaking cry he uttered when he saw her dead body, he never
again mentioned her name, though he lived for four years. His end came peacefully enough, in
April, 1800.

When Cowper was fifty-six years old his cousin sent to him from Norfolk a picture of his mother,
who had then been dead for half a century. How vivid a recollection of her loving care remained
to the saddened man may be seen in the poem.

MY MOTHER'S PICTURE

OUT OF NORFOLK, THE GIFT OF MY COUSIN, ANN BODHAM

    O that those lips had language! Life has passed
    With me but roughly since I heard thee last.
    Those lips are thine,--thy own sweet smile I see,
    The same that oft in childhood solaced me;
    Voice only fails, else how distinct they say,
    "Grieve not, my child; chase all thy fears away!"
    The meek intelligence of those dear eyes
    (Blest be the art that can immortalize,--
    The art that baffles time's tyrannic claim
    To quench it!) here shines on me still the same.

    Faithful remembrancer of one so dear!
    O welcome guest, though unexpected here!
    Who bid'st me honor with an artless song,
    Affectionate, a mother lost so long.
    I will obey,--not willingly alone.
    But gladly, as[335-1] the precept were her own;
    And, while that face renews my filial grief,
    Fancy shall weave a charm for my relief,--
    Shall steep me in Elysian[335-2] revery,
    A momentary dream that thou art she.

      My mother! when I learned that thou wast dead,
    Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?
    Hovered thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son,--
    Wretch even then, life's journey just begun?
    Perhaps thou gavest me, though unfelt, a kiss;
    Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss--
    Ah, that maternal smile! it answers--Yes.
    I heard the bell tolled on thy burial day;
    I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away;
    And, turning from my nursery window, drew
    A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu!
    But was it such?--It was.--Where thou art gone
    Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown;
    May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore,
    The parting word shall pass my lips no more.
    Thy maidens, grieved themselves at my concern,
    Oft gave me promise of thy quick return;
    What ardently I wished I long believed,
    And, disappointed still, was still deceived,--
    By expectation every day beguiled,
    Dupe of to-morrow even from a child.
    Thus many a sad to-morrow came and went,
    Till, all my stock of infant sorrow spent,
    I learned at last submission to my lot;
    But, though I less deplored thee, ne'er forgot.

    Where once we dwelt our name is heard no more;
    Children not thine have trod my nursery floor;
    And where the gardener Robin, day by day,
    Drew me to school along the public way,
    Delighted with my bauble coach, and wrapt
    In scarlet mantle warm, and velvet capped,
    'Tis now become a history little known,
    That once we call'd the pastoral house[337-3] our own.
    Shortlived possession! but the record fair,
    That memory keeps of all thy kindness there,
    Still outlives many a storm, that has effaced
    A thousand other themes less deeply traced.
    Thy nightly visits to my chamber made,
    That thou mightst know me safe and warmly laid;
    Thy morning bounties ere I left my home,
    The biscuit, or confectionery plum;
    The fragrant waters on my cheeks bestow'd
    By thy own hand, till fresh they shone and glow'd;
    All this, and more endearing still than all,
    Thy constant flow of love, that knew no fall,
    Ne'er roughen'd by those cataracts and breaks,
    That humour[338-4] interposed too often makes;
    All this still legible in memory's page,
    And still to be so to my latest age,
    Adds joy to duty, makes me glad to pay
    Such honours to thee as my numbers[338-5] may;
    Perhaps a frail memorial, but sincere,
    Not scorn'd in Heaven, though little noticed here.
    Could Time, his flight reversed, restore the hours,
    When, playing with thy vesture's tissued[338-6] flowers,
    The violet, the pink, the jessamine,
    I prick'd them into paper with a pin,[338-7]
    (And thou wast happier than myself the while--
    Wouldst softly speak, and stroke my head and smile,)--
    Could those few pleasant days again appear,
    Might one wish bring them, would I wish them here?
    I would not trust my heart,--the dear delight
    Seems so to be desired, perhaps I might.
    But no,--what here we call our life is such,
    So little to be loved, and thou so much,
    That I should ill requite thee to constrain
    Thy unbound spirit into bounds again.

      Thou--as a gallant bark, from Albion's[339-8] coast,
    (The storms all weathered and the ocean crossed,)
    Shoots into port at some well-havened isle,
    Where spices breathe and brighter seasons smile;
    There sits quiescent on the floods, that show
    Her beauteous form reflected clear below,
    While airs impregnated with incense play
    Around her, fanning light her streamers gay,--
    So thou, with sails how swift! hast reached the shore
    "Where tempests never beat nor billows roar":
    And thy loved consort[339-9] on the dangerous tide
    Of life long since has anchored by thy side.
    But me,[339-10] scarce hoping to attain the rest,
    Always from port withheld, always distressed,--
    Me[339-10] howling blasts drive devious, tempest-tossed,
    Sails ripped, seams opening wide, and compass lost;[339-11]
    And day by day some current's thwarting force
    Sets me more distant from a prosperous course.
    Yet O, the thought that thou art safe, and he!--[339-12]
    That thought is joy, arrive what may to me.
    My boast is not that I deduce my birth
    From loins enthroned,[339-13] and rulers of the earth;
    But higher far my proud pretensions rise,--
    The son of parents passed into the skies.
    And now, farewell!--Time, unrevoked,[340-14] has run
    His wonted course; yet what I wished is done.
    By contemplation's help, not sought in vain,
    I seem to have lived my childhood o'er again,--
    To have renewed the joys that once were mine,
    Without the sin of violating thine;
    And, while the wings of fancy still are free,
    And I can view this mimic show of thee,
    Time has but half succeeded in his theft,--
    Thyself removed, thy power to soothe me left.

THOSE EVENING BELLS

By THOMAS MOORE

    Those evening bells! those evening bells.
    How many a tale their music tells,
    Of youth, and home, and that sweet time
    When last I heard their soothing chime!

    Those joyous hours are passed away;
    And many a heart that once was gay,
    Within the tomb now darkly dwells,
    And hears no more those evening bells.

    And so 'twill be when I am gone--
    That tuneful peal will still ring on;
    While other bards shall walk these dells,
    And sing your praise, sweet evening bells.

ANNABEL LEE

By EDGAR ALLAN POE

    It was many and many a year ago,
      In a kingdom by the sea,
    That a maiden lived, whom you may know
      By the name of Annabel Lee;
    And this maiden she lived with no other thought
      Than to love, and be loved by me.

    I was a child and she was a child,
      In this kingdom by the sea;
    But we loved with a love that was more than love,
      I and my Annabel Lee,--
    With a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven
      Coveted her and me.

    And this was the reason that long ago,
      In this kingdom by the sea,
    A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
      My beautiful Annabel Lee;
    So that her highborn kinsmen came,
      And bore her away from me,
    To shut her up in a sepulchre,
      In this kingdom by the sea.

    The angels, not so happy in heaven,
      Went envying her and me.
    Yes! that was the reason (as all men know)
      In this kingdom by the sea,
    That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
      Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

    But our love it was stronger by far than the love
      Of those who were older than we,
      Of many far wiser than we;
    And neither the angels in heaven above,
      Nor the demons down under the sea,
    Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
      Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
    For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
      Of the beautiful Annabel Lee,

    And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
      Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
    And so, all the night-tide I lie down by the side
      Of my darling, my darling, my life, and my bride,
    In her sepulchre there by the sea,
      In her tomb by the sounding sea.

THE THREE FISHERS

By CHARLES KINGSLEY

    Three fishers went sailing out into the west--
      Out into the west as the sun went down;
    Each thought on the woman who loved him the best,
      And the children stood watching them out of the town;
    For men must work, and women must weep;
    And there's little to earn, and many to keep,
      Though the harbor bar be moaning.

    Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower,
      And trimmed the lamps as the sun went down;
    And they looked at the squall, and they looked at the shower,
      And the night rack came rolling up, ragged and brown;
    But men must work, and women must weep,--
    Though storms be sudden, and waters deep,
      And the harbor bar be moaning.

    Three corpses lay out on the shining sands
      In the morning gleam as the tide went down,
    And the women are weeping and wringing their hands,
      For those who will never come back to the town;
    For men must work, and women must weep,
    And the sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep,--
      And good-bye to the bar and its moaning.

THE REAPER'S DREAM

By THOMAS BUCHANAN READ

    The road was lone; the grass was dank
    With night-dews on the briery bank
    Whereon a weary reaper sank.
    His garb was old; his visage tanned;
    The rusty sickle in his hand
    Could find no work in all the land.

    He saw the evening's chilly star
    Above his native vale afar;
    A moment on the horizon's bar
    It hung, then sank, as with a sigh;
    And there the crescent moon went by,
    An empty sickle down the sky.

    To soothe his pain, Sleep's tender palm
    Laid on his brow its touch of balm;
    His brain received the slumberous calm;
    And soon that angel without name,
    Her robe a dream, her face the same,
    The giver of sweet visions came. 

    They were at this moment surrounded by numbers
    of her friends and of his, who were
    watching the effect produced by this interview.
    His father, satisfied by the admiration
    he saw in Count Albert's countenance, when
    they both took off their masks, approached and whispered, "the Countess
Christina."

    Count Altenberg grew pale, and for
    a moment stood in silent consternation.
    The lady smiled with an air of
    haughty superiority, which in some degree
    relieved him, by calling his
    own pride to his aid, and by convincing him that tenderness, or feminine
timidity, which he would have most dreaded to wound, were not the
characteristics of her mind.

    He instantly asked permission to
    pay his respects to her at her father's
    palace the ensuing day. She changed colour--darted
    a penetrating glance at the Count;
    and after an incomprehensible and quick
    alternation of pleasure and pain in her countenance, she replied,
that "she consented to grant Count Albert Altenberg that interview
which he and their mutual friends desired."

    She then retired with friends from
    the assembly.
    
    In spite of the haughtiness of her demeanour,
    it had been obvious that she had desired
    to make an impression upon Count Albert; and all who knew her agreed
that she had never on any occasion been seen to exert herself so much
to shine and please.

    She shone, but had not pleased. The
    father, however, was content; an interview
    was promised--he trusted to the
    charms and talents of the Countess--he
    trusted to her flattering desire to captivate,
    and with impatience and confidence, he waited for the event of the
succeeding day.

    Some intervening hours, a night of
    feverish and agonizing suspense, would
    have been spared to Count Albert,
    had he at this time known any
    thing of an intrigue--an intrigue
    which an artful enemy had been carrying on, with design to mortify,
disgrace, and ruin his house.

    The plan was worthy of him by whom
    it was formed--M. de Tourville--a person,
    between whom and Count Albert there seemed
    an incompatibility of character, and
    even of manner; an aversion openly, indiscreetly
    shown by the Count, even from his boyish years, but cautiously concealed
on the part of M. de Tourville, masked in courtly smiles and a diplomatic
air of perfect consideration.

    Fear mixed with M. de Tourville's dislike.
    He was aware that if Count Albert continued
    in confidence with the hereditary prince, he
    would, when the prince should assume
    the reins of government, become, in
    all probability, his prime minister, and then adieu to all M. de
Tourville's hopes of rising to favour and fortune.

    Fertile in the resources of intrigue,
    gallant and political, he combined
    them, upon this occasion, with exquisite address.
    When the Countess Christina was first
    presented at court, he had observed
    that the Prince was struck by her beauty.

    M. de Tourville took every means that
    a courtier well knows how to
    employ, to flatter the taste by which he
    hoped to benefit. In secret he insinuated
    into the lady's ear that she was admired
    by the prince.

    M. de Tourville knew her to be of an aspiring
    character, and rightly judged that
    ambition was her strongest passion.
    When once the hope of captivating the
    prince had been suggested to her, she
    began to disdain the proposed alliance with the house of Altenberg;
but she concealed this disdain, till she could show it with security:
she played her part with all the ability, foresight, and consummate
prudence, of which ambition, undisturbed by love, is capable.

    Many obstacles opposed her views:
    the projected marriage with Count
    Albert Altenberg--the certainty that
    the reigning prince would never
    consent to his son's forming an alliance
    with the daughter of a subject.

    But the old Prince was dying, and the
    Lady Christina calculated, that till
    his decease, she could protract the time
    appointed for her marriage with Count Albert.
    The young Prince might then break off
    the projected match, prevail upon the Emperor to create her a Princess
of the empire, and then, without derogating from his rank, or giving
offence to German ideas of propriety, he might gratify his passion,
and accomplish the fulness of her ambition.

    Determined to take no counsel but
    her own, she never opened her scheme
    to any of her friends, but pursued her
    plan secretly, in concert with M. de Tourville,
    whom she considered but as a humble instrument
    devoted to her service.

    He all the while considering her merely
    as a puppet, played by his art, to secure
    at once the purposes of his interest
    and of his hatred. He thought he foresaw
    that Count Albert would never yield his
    intended bride peaceably to his prince--he knew nothing of the Count's
attachment in England--the Lady Christina was charming--the alliance
highly advantageous to the house of Altenberg--the breaking off such
a marriage, and the disappointment of a passion which he thought the
young Countess could not fail to inspire, would, as M. de Tourville
hoped, produce an irreparable breach between the Prince and his favourite.

    On Count Albert's return from England, symptoms
    of alarm and jealousy had appeared in
    the Prince, unmarked by all but by the Countess
    Christina, and by the confidant, who
    was in the secret of his passion.
    

    So far M. de Tourville's scheme had
    prospered, and from the character of
    the hereditary Prince, it was likely
    to succeed in its ultimate view. He
    was a Prince of good dispositions,
    but wanting in resolution and civil courage: capable of resisting
the allurements of pleasure for a certain time, but soon weary of
painful endurance in any cause; with a taste for virtue, but destitute
of that power to bear and forbear, without which there is no virtue:
a hero, when supported by a stronger mind, such as that of his friend,
Count Albert; but relaxing and sinking at once, when exposed to the
influence of a flatterer such as M. de Tourville: subject to exquisite
shame and self-reproach, when he had acted contrary to his own idea
of right; yet, from the very same weakness that made him err, disposed
to be obstinate in error.

    M. de Tourville argued well from his
    knowledge of his character, that
    the Prince, enamoured as he was of
    the charms of the fair Christina,
    would not long be able to resist
    his passion; and that if once he broke through his sense of honour,
and declared that passion to the destined bride of his friend, he
would ever afterwards shun and detest the man whom he had injured.

    All this M. de Tourville had admirably
    well combined: no man understood
    and managed better the weaknesses
    of human nature, but its strength
    he could not so well estimate;
    and as for generosity, as he could not believe in its sincerity,
he was never prepared for its effects.

    The struggles which the Prince made against
    his passion were greater, and of longer
    duration, than M. de Tourville had expected.
    If Count Albert had continued absent,
    the Prince might have been brought
    more easily to betray him; but his return recalled, in the midst
of love and jealousy, the sense of respect he had for the superior
character of this friend of his early days: he knew the value of a
friend--even at the moment he yielded his faith to a flatterer.

     He could not at once forfeit the esteem of the being who esteemed him
     most--he could not sacrifice the interest, and as he thought, the
happiness, of the man who loved him best.

     The attachment his favourite had shown him, his truth, his confiding
     openness of temper, the pleasure in his countenance when he saw him
     first upon his return from England, all these operated on the heart
     of the Prince, and no declaration of his passion had been made
     at the time when the appointed interview took place between Count
     Albert and the Countess Christina at her father's palace. Her
     friends not doubting that her marriage was on the eve of its accomplishment,
     had no scruple, even in that court of etiquette, in permitting the
     affianced lovers to have as private a conference as each seemed to
     desire. The lady's manner was this morning most alarmingly gracious.

     Count Albert was, however, struck by a difference in her air the
moment she was alone with him, from what it had been whilst in the
presence of her friends.

     All that he might without vanity have interpreted as marking a desire
     to please, to show him favour, and to evince her approbation, at
     least, of the choice her friends had made for her, vanished the moment
     they withdrew. What her motives might be, Count Altenberg could
     not guess; but the hope he now felt, that she was not really
     inclined to consider him with partiality, rendered it more easy to
     enter into that explanation, upon which he was, at all events,
     resolved. With all the delicacy due to her sex, with all the deference
     due to her character, and all the softenings by which politeness
     can soothe and conciliate pride, he revealed to the Countess
     Christina the real state of his affections: he told her the whole
     truth, concluding, by repeating the assurance of his belief, that
     her charms and merit would be irresistible to any heart that was disengaged.

The
     lady heard him in astonishment: for this turn of fate she had been
     wholly unprepared--the idea of his being attached to another had
     never once presented itself to her imagination; she had never calculated
on the possibility that her alliance should be declined by any individual
of a family less than sovereign.

     She possessed, however, pride of character superior to her pride of
     rank, and strength of mind suited to the loftiness of her ambition.
     With dignity in her air and countenance, after a pause of reflection,
she replied, "Count Albert Altenberg is, I find, equal to the high
character I have heard of him: deserving of my esteem and confidence,
by that which can alone command esteem and merit confidence--sincerity.

     His example has recalled me to my nobler self, and he has, in this
     moment, rescued me from the labyrinth of a diplomatist. Count Albert's
     sincerity I--little accustomed to imitation, but proud to follow
     in what is good and great--shall imitate. Know then, sir, that my
     heart, like your own, is engaged: and that you may be convinced I
     do not mock your ear with the semblance of confidence, I shall, at
     whatever hazard to myself, trust to you my secret. My affections
     have a high object--are fixed upon him, whose friend and favourite
     Count Albert Altenberg deservedly is.

     I should scorn myself--no throne upon earth could raise me in my
     own opinion, if I could deceive or betray the man who has treated
     me with such sincerity."
     
     Relieved at once by this explanation, and admiring the manner in which
     it was made, mingled joy and admiration were manifest in his countenance;
and the lady forgave him the joy, in consideration of the tribute
he paid to her superiority.

     Admiration was a tribute he was most willing to yield at this moment,
     when released from that engagement to love, which it had been impossible
     for him to fulfil.
     
     The Countess recalled his attention to her affairs and to his own.

Without his making any inquiry, she told him all that had been done,
and all that yet remained to be done, for the accomplishment of her
hopes: she had been assured, she said, by one now in the favour and
private confidence of the hereditary prince, that his inclination
for her was--painfully and with struggles, which, in her eyes, made
his royal heart worthy her conquest--suppressed by a sense of honour
to his friend.

"This conflict would now cease," Count Albert said. "It should be his immediate care to relieve
his Prince from all difficulty on his account."

"By what means?" the Countess asked.

"Simply by informing him of the truth--as far as I am concerned. Your secret, madam, is safe--your
confidence sacred.

Of all that concerns myself--my own attachment, and the resignation of any pretensions that might
interfere with his, he shall immediately be acquainted with the whole truth."

The Countess coloured, and repeating the words, "the whole truth," looked disconcerted, and in
great perplexity replied, that Count Albert's speaking to the Prince directly--his immediate resignation
of his pretensions--would, perhaps, defeat her plans.

This was not the course she had intended to pursue--far from that which M. de Tourville had
pointed out. After some moments' reflection, she said, "I abide by the truth--speak to the prince--be
it so: I trust to your honour and discretion to speak to him in such
terms as not to implicate me, to commit my delicacy, or to derogate
from my dignity.

We shall see then whether he loves me as I desire to be loved. If he does, he will free me, at
once, from all difficulty with my friends, for he will speak en prince--and not speak in vain;
if he loves me not, I need not tell you, sir, that you are equally free. My friends shall be
convinced that I will never be the bride of any other man."

After the explanation with the Lady Christina, Count Albert lost no
time; he went instantly to the palace.

In his way thither, he was met by one of the pages, who told him the Prince desired to see
him immediately. He found the Prince alone. Advancing to meet him, with great effort in his
manner to command his emotion, the Prince said, "I have sent for
you, Count Albert, to give you a proof that the friendship of Princes
is not, in every instance, so vain a thing as it is commonly believed
to be.

Mine for you has withstood strong temptation:--you come from the Countess Christina, I believe,
and can measure, better than any one, the force of that temptation.

Know, that in your absence it has been my misfortune to become passionately enamoured of your destined
bride; but I have never, either by word or look, directly or indirectly, infringed on what
I felt to be due to your friendship and to my own honour. Never did I give her the slightest intimation
of my passion, never attempted to take any of the advantages which my situation might be supposed
to give."

Count Albert had just received the most convincing testimony corroborating
these assertions--he was going to express his sense of the conduct
of his Prince, and to explain his own situation, but the Prince went
on speaking with the eagerness of one who fears his own resolution,
who has to say something which he dreads that he should not be able
to resume or finish, if his feelings should meet with any interruption.

"And

now let me, as your friend and prince, congratulate you, Count Albert, on your happiness; and, with
the same sincerity, I request that your marriage may not be delayed, and that you will take your
bride immediately away from my father's court. Time will, I hope, render her presence less dangerous;
time will, I hope, enable me to enjoy your society in safety; and
when it shall become my duty to govern this state, I shall hope for
the assistance of your talents and integrity, and shall have deserved,
in some degree, your attachment."

   
    

The Count, in the strongest manner, expressed his gratitude to his Prince for these proofs of
his regard, given under circumstances the most trying to the human heart. He felt, at this instant,
exquisite pleasure in revealing to his highness the truth, in showing
him that the sacrifice he had so honourably, so generously determined
to make, was not requisite, that their affections were fixed on different
objects, that before Count Albert had any idea of the prince's attachment
to the Lady Christina, it had been his ardent wish, his determination,
at all hazards, to break off engagements which he could not fulfil.

The Prince was in rapturous joy--all his ease of manner towards his friend returned instantly,
his affection and confidence flowed in full tide. Proud of himself, and happy in the sense
of the imminent danger from which he had escaped, he now described
the late conflicts his heart had endured with the eloquence of self-complacency,
and with that sense of relief which is felt in speaking on the most
interesting of all subjects to a faithful friend from whom a secret
has been painfully concealed.

The Prince now threw open every thought, every feeling of his mind. Count Altenberg rose higher
than ever in his favour: not the temporary favourite of the moment--the companion of pleasures--the
flatterer of present passion or caprice; but the friend in whom there is certainty of sympathy,
and security of counsel.

The Prince, confiding in Count Albert's zeal and superior powers, now took advice from him,
and made a confidant no longer of M. de Tourville. The very means which that intriguing courtier
had taken to undermine the Count thus eventually proved the cause
of establishing more firmly his credit.

The plain sincerity of the Count, and the generous magnanimity of the lady, at once disconcerted
and destroyed the artful plan of the diplomatist.

M. de Tourville's disappointment when he heard from the Countess Christina the result of her interview
with Count Albert, and the reproaches which in that moment of vexation he could not refrain
from uttering against the lady for having departed from their plan, and having trusted to the
Count, unveiled to her the meanness of his character and the baseness of his designs. She plainly
saw that his object had been not to assist her love, but to gratify his own hate: not merely
to advance his own fortune--that, she knew, must be the first object of every courtier--but
"to rise upon the ruins of another's fame;" and this, she determined,
should never be accomplished by her assistance, or with her connivance.

She put Count Albert on his guard against this insidious enemy.

The Count, grateful to the lady, yet biassed neither by hope of her
future favour nor by present desire to please, firm in honour and
loyalty to the Prince who asked his counsel, carefully studied the
character of the Countess Christina, to determine whether she possessed
the qualities fit for the high station to which love was impatient
that she should be elevated.

When he was convinced that her character was such as was requisite to ensure the private happiness
of the prince, to excite him to the attainment of true glory--then,
and not till then, he decidedly advised the marriage, and zealously
offered any assistance in his power to promote the union.

   The hereditary Prince about this time
      became, by the death of his father,
    sole master of his actions; but it was not
      prudent to begin his government with an act in open defiance of the
prejudices or customs of his country.

By these customs, he could not marry any woman under the rank of a Princess; and the Emperor
had been known to refuse conferring this rank, even on favourites of powerful potentates, by whom
he had been in the most urgent manner solicited.

Count Albert Altenberg stood high in the esteem of the Emperor, at whose court he had spent some
time; and his prince now commissioned him to go to Vienna, and endeavour to move the Emperor
to concede this point in his favour. This embassy was a new and terrible delay to the Count's
anxious desire of returning to England. But he had offered his services, and he gave them generously.
He repaired to Vienna, and persevering through many difficulties,
at length succeeded in obtaining for the Countess the rank of Princess.

The attachment of the Prince was then publicly declared--the marriage was solemnized--all approved
of the Prince's choice--all--except the envious, who never approve of the happy. Count Albert
received, both from the Prince and Princess, the highest marks of esteem and favour. M. de
Tourville, detected and despised, retired from court in disgrace
and in despair.

Immediately after his marriage, the Prince declared his intention of appointing Count Albert
Altenberg his prime minister; but before he entered on the duties
of his office and the very moment that he could be spared by his Prince,
he asked and obtained permission to return to England, to the lady
on whom his affections were fixed.

The old Count, his father, satisfied with the turn which affairs had taken, and gratified in
his utmost ambition by seeing his son minister of state, now willingly permitted him to follow his
own inclination in the choice of a wife. "And," concluded Count Albert, "my father rejoices
that my heart is devoted to an Englishwoman: having himself married
an English lady, he knows, from experience, how to appreciate the
domestic merits of the ladies of England; he is prepossessed in their
favour.

He agrees, indeed, with foreigners of every nation, who have had opportunities of judging, and
who all allow that--next to their own countrywomen--the English are the most charming and
the most amiable women in the world."

When the Count had finished, and had pronounced this panegyric of
a nation, while he thought only of an individual, he paused, anxious
to know what effect his narrative had produced on Mr. and Mrs. Percy.

He was gratified both by their words and looks, which gave him full
assurance of their entire satisfaction.

"And since he had done them the honour of appealing to their opinion,
they might be permitted to add their complete approbation of every
part of his conduct, in the difficult circumstances in which he had
been placed.

They were fully sensible of the high honour that such a man as Count Altenberg conferred on
their daughter by his preference. As to the rest, they must refer him to Caroline herself."
Mr. Percy said with a grave voice, but with a smile from which the Count augured well, "that even
for the most advantageous and, in his opinion, desirable connexion,
he would not influence his daughter's inclination.--Caroline must
decide."

The Count, with all the persuasive tenderness and energy of truth
and love, pleaded his own cause, and was heard by Caroline with a
modest, dignified, ingenuous sensibility, which increased his passion.

Her partiality was now heightened by her conviction of the strength and steadiness of his attachment;
but whilst she acknowledged how high he stood in her esteem, and did not attempt to conceal
the impression he had made on her heart, yet he saw that she dreaded to yield to the passion
which must at last require from her the sacrifice of her home, country,
friends, and parents.

As long as the idea of being united to him was faint and distant, so was the fear of the sacrifices
that union might demand; but now, the hope, the fear, the certainty, at once pressed on her heart
with the most agitating urgency. The Count as far as possible relieved her mind by the assurance, that
though his duty to his Prince and his father, that though all his
private and public connexions and interests obliged him to reside
some time in Germany, yet that he could occasionally visit England,
that he should seize every opportunity of visiting a country he preferred
to all others; and, for his own sake, he should cultivate the friendship
of her family, as each individual was in different ways suited to
his taste and stood high in his esteem.

Caroline listened with fond anxiety to these hopes: she was willing to believe in promises which
she was convinced were made with entire sincerity; and when her affections
had been wrought to this point, when her resolution was once determined,
she never afterwards tormented the man to whom she was attached, with
wavering doubts and scruples.

Count Altenberg's promise to his prince obliged him to return at an appointed time. Caroline wished
that time had been more distant; she would have delighted in spending the spring-time of love
in the midst of those who had formed till now all the happiness of her life--with her parents,
to whom she owed every thing, to whom her gratitude was as warm, as strong, as her affection--with
her beloved sister, who had sympathized so tenderly in all her sorrow,
and who ardently wished to have some time allowed to enjoy her happiness.

Caroline felt all this, but she felt too deeply to display feeling: sensible of what the duty
and honour of Count Altenberg demanded, she asked for no delay.

The first letters that were written to announce her intended marriage were to Mrs. Hungerford
and to Lady Jane Granville

.


Up I got, was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray, but this time stuck to my
purpose; and set myself, with all my strength and caution, to paddle after the unsteered Hispaniola.
Once I shipped a sea so heavy that I had to stop and bail, with my heart fluttering like a
bird; but gradually I got into the way of the thing, and guided my coracle among the waves,
with only now and then a blow upon her bows and a dash of foam in my face.

I was now gaining rapidly on the schooner. I could see the brass glisten on the tiller as it
banged about; and still no soul appeared upon her decks. I could not choose but suppose she
was deserted. If not, the men were lying drunk below, where I might batten them down, perhaps,
and do what I chose with the ship.

For some time she had been doing the worst thing possible for me--standing still. She headed
nearly due south, yawing, of course, all the time. Each time she fell off her sails partly
filled, and these brought her in a moment right to the wind again. I have said this was the
worst thing possible for me; for helpless as she looked in this situation, with the canvas
cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling and banging on the deck, she still continued
to run away from me, not only with the speed of the current, but by the whole amount of her
leeway, which was naturally great.

But now at last I had my chance. The breeze fell for some seconds very low, and the current
gradually turning her, the Hispaniola revolved slowly round her center, and at last presented
me her stern, with the cabin window still gaping open, and the lamp over the table still burning
on into the day.

The mainsail hung drooped like a banner. She was stock-still, but for the current.

For the last little while I had even lost; but now, redoubling my efforts, I began once more
to overhaul the chase.

I was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap; she filled on the port
tack and was off again, stooping and skimming like a swallow.

My first impulse was one of despair, but my second was toward joy. Round she came till she
was broadside on to me--round still till she had covered a half, and then two thirds, and then
three quarters of the distance that separated us. I could see the waves boiling white under
her forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle.

And then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time to think--scarce time to act
and save myself. I was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came stooping over the
next. The bowsprit was over my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under
water. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodged between the stay and the
brace; and as I still clung there panting a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged
down upon and struck the coracle, and that I was left without retreat on the Hispaniola.

I had scarce gained a position on the bowsprit, when the flying jib flapped and filled upon
the other tack, with a report like a gun. The schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse;
but next moment, the other sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle.

This had nearly tossed me off into the sea; and now I lost no time, crawled back along the
bowsprit, and tumbled head foremost on the deck.

I was on the lee side of the forecastle, and the mainsail, which was still drawing, concealed
from me a certain portion of the after-deck. Not a soul was to be seen. The planks, which had
not been swabbed since the mutiny, bore the print of many feet; and an empty bottle, broken
by the neck, tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers.

Suddenly the Hispaniola came right into the wind. The jibs behind me cracked aloud; the rudder
slammed to; the whole ship gave a sickening heave and shudder, and at the same moment the main-boom
swung inboard, the sheet groaning in the blocks, and showed me the lee after-deck.

There were the two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap on his back, as stiff as a handspike, with
his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix, and his teeth showing through his open lips;
Israel Hands propped against the bulwarks, his chin on his chest, his hands lying open before
him on the deck, his face as white, under its tan, as a tallow candle.

For awhile the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse, the sails filling, now on
one tack, now on another, and the boom swinging to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under
the strain. Now and again, too, there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark,
and a heavy blow of the ship's bows against the swell: so much heavier weather was made of
it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made, lopsided coracle, now gone to the bottom
of the sea.

At every jump of the schooner red-cap slipped to and fro; but--what was ghastly to behold--neither
his attitude nor his fixed teeth-disclosing grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage.
At every jump, too, Hands appeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the
deck, his feet sliding ever the farther out, and the whole body canting toward the stern, so
that his face became, little by little, hid from me; and at last I could see nothing beyond
his ear and the frayed ringlet of one whisker.

At the same time, I observed, around both of them, splashes of dark blood upon the planks,
and began to feel sure that they had killed each other in their drunken wrath.

While I was thus looking and wondering, in a calm moment, when the ship was still, Israel Hands
turned partly round, and, with a low moan, writhed himself back to the position in which I
had seen him first. The moan, which told of pain and deadly weakness, and the way in which
his jaw hung open, went right to my heart. But when I remembered the talk I had overheard from
the apple barrel, all pity left me.

I walked aft until I reached the mainmast.

"Come aboard, Mr. Hands," I said ironically.

He rolled his eyes round heavily; but he was too far gone to express surprise. All he could
do was to utter one word: "Brandy."

It occurred to me there was no time to lose; and, dodging the boom as it once more lurched
across the deck, I slipped aft, and down the companion stairs into the cabin.

It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy. All the lockfast places had been
broken open in quest of the chart. The floor was thick with mud, where ruffians had sat down
to drink or consult after wading in the marshes round their camp. The bulkheads, all painted
in clear white, and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands. Dozens of empty
bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship. One of the doctor's medical
books lay open on the table, half of the leaves gutted out, I suppose, for pipe-lights. In
the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber.

I went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles a most surprising number
had been drunk out and thrown away. Certainly, since the mutiny began, not a man of them could
ever have been sober. Foraging about I found a bottle with some brandy left, for Hands; and
for myself I routed out some biscuit, some pickled fruits, a great bunch of raisins, and a
piece of cheese. With these I came on deck, put down my own stock behind the rudder head, and
well out of the coxswain's reach, went forward to the waterbreaker, and had a good, deep drink
of water, and then, and not till then, gave Hands the brandy.

He must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth.

"Ay," said he, "by thunder, but I wanted some o' that!"

I had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat.

"Much hurt?" I asked him.

He grunted, or, rather, I might say, he barked.

"If that doctor was aboard," he said, "I'd be right enough in a couple of turns; but I don't
have no manner of luck, you see, and that's what's the matter with me. As for that swab, he's
good and dead, he is," he added, indicating the man with the red cap. "He warn't no seaman,
anyhow. And where mought you have come from?"

"Well," said I, "I've come aboard to take possession of this ship, Mr. Hands; and you'll please
regard me as your captain until further notice."

He looked at me sourly enough, but said nothing. Some of the color had come back into his cheeks,
though he still looked very sick, and still continued to slip out and settle down as the ship
banged about.

"By the bye," I continued, "I can't have these colors, Mr. Hands; and, by your leave, I'll
strike 'em. Better none than these."

And, again dodging the boom, I ran to the color lines, handed down their cursed black flag,
and chucked it overboard.

"God save the king!" said I, waving my cap.

He watched me keenly and slyly, his chin all the while on his breast.

"I reckon," he said at last--"I reckon, Cap'n Hawkins, you'll kind of want to get ashore, now.
S'pose we talks."

"Why, yes," says I, "with all my heart, Mr. Hands. Say on." And I went back to my meal with
a good appetite.

"This man," he began, nodding feebly at the corpse--"O'Brien were his name--a rank Irelander--this
man and me got the canvas on her, meaning for to sail her back. Well, he's dead now, he is--as
dead as bilge; and who's to sail this ship, I don't see. Without I gives you a hint, you ain't
that man, as far's I can tell. Now, look here, you gives me food and drink, and an old scarf
or ankecher to tie my wound up, you do; and I'll tell you how to sail her; and that's about
square all round, I take it.

"I'll tell you one thing," says I: "I'm not going back to Captain Kidd's anchorage. I mean
to get into North Inlet, and beach her quietly there."

"To be sure you did," he cried. "Why, I ain't such an infernal lubber, after all. I can see,
can't I? I've tried my fling, I have, and I've lost, and it's you has the wind of me. North
Inlet? Why, I haven't no chi'ce, not I! I'd help you sail her up to Execution Dock, by thunder!
so I would."

Well, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this. We struck our bargain on the spot.
In three minutes I had the Hispaniola sailing easily before the wind along the coast of Treasure
Island, with good hopes of turning the northern point ere noon, and beating down again as far
as North Inlet before high water, when we might beach her safely, and wait till the subsiding
tide permitted us to land.

Then I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest, where I got a soft silk handkerchief
of my mother's. With this, and with my aid, Hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received
in the thigh, and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy,
he began to pick up visibly, sat straighter up, spoke louder and clearer, and looked in every
way another man.

The breeze served us admirably. We skimmed before it like a bird, the coast of the island flashing
by, and the view changing every minute. Soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside
low, sandy country, sparsely dotted with dwarf pines, and soon we were beyond that again, and
had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the north.

I was greatly elated with my new command, and pleased with the bright, sunshiny weather and
these different prospects of the coast. I had now plenty of water and good things to eat, and
my conscience, which had smitten me hard for my desertion, was quieted by the great conquest
I had made. I should, I think, have had nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain
as they followed me derisively about the deck, and the odd smile that appeared continually
on his face. It was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weakness--a haggard,
old man's smile; but there was besides that, a grain of derision, a shadow of treachery in
his expression as he craftily watched, and watched, and watched me at my work.

The wind, serving us to a desire, now hauled into the west. We could run so much the easier
from the northeast corner of the island to the mouth of the North Inlet. Only, as we had no
power to anchor, and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time
hung on our hands.

The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to; after a good many trials I succeeded, and we both
sat in silence over another meal.

"Cap'n," said he, at length, with that same uncomfortable smile, "here's my old shipmate, O'Brien;
s'pose you was to heave him overboard. I ain't partic'lar as a rule, and I don't take no blame
for settling his hash; but I don't reckon him ornamental, now, do you?"

"I'm not strong enough, and I don't like the job; and there he lies, for me," said I.

"This here's an unlucky ship--this Hispaniola, Jim," he went on, blinking. "There's a power
of men been killed in this Hispaniola--a sight o' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me
took ship to Bristol. I never seen sich dirty luck, not I. There was this here O'Brien, now--he's
dead, ain't he? Well, now, I'm no scholar, and you're a lad as can read and figure; and, to
put it straight, do you take it as a dead man is dead for good, or do he come alive again?"

"You can kill the body, Mr. Hands, but not the spirit; you must know that already," I replied.
"O'Brien there is in another world, and maybe watching us."

"Ah!" says he. "Well, that's unfort'nate--appears as if killing parties was a waste of time.
Howsomever, sperrits don't reckon for much, by what I've seen. I'll chance it with the sperrits,
Jim. And now, you've spoke up free, and I'll take it kind if you'd step down into that there
cabin and get me a--well, a--shiver my timbers! I can't hit the name on't; well, you get me
a bottle of wine, Jim--this here brandy's too strong for my head."

Now, the coxswain's hesitation seemed to be unnatural; and as for the notion of his preferring
wine to brandy, I entirely disbelieved it. The whole story was a pretext. He wanted me to leave
the deck--so much was plain; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine. His eyes never
met mine; they kept wandering to and fro, up and down, now with a look to the sky, now with
a flitting glance upon the dead O'Brien. All the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue
out in the most guilty, embarrassed manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent
on some deception. I was prompt with my answer, however, for I saw where my advantage lay;
and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily conceal my suspicions to the end.

"Some wine?" I said. "Far better. Will you have white or red?"

"Well, I reckon it's about the blessed same to me, shipmate," he replied; "so it's strong and
plenty of it, what's the odds?"

"All right," I answered. "I'll bring you port, Mr. Hands. But I'll have to dig for it."

With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could, slipped off my shoes, ran
quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the forecastle ladder and popped my head out of
the fore companion. I knew he would not expect to see me there; yet I took every precaution
possible; and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true.

He had risen from his position to his hands and knees; and though his leg obviously hurt him
pretty sharply when he moved--for I could hear him stifle a groan--yet it was at a good, rattling
rate that he trailed himself across the deck. In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers,
and picked out a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a short dirk, discolored to the hilt
with blood. He looked upon it for a moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point
upon his hand, and then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundled back again
into his old place against the bulwark.

That was all that I required to know. Israel could move about; he was now armed; and if he
had been at so much trouble to get rid of me, it was plain that I was meant to be the victim.
What he would do afterward--whether he would try to crawl right across the island from North
Inlet to the camp among the swamps, or whether he would fire Long Tom, trusting that his own
comrades might come first to help him, was, of course, more than I could say.

Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point, since in that our interests jumped together,
and that was in the disposition of the schooner. We both desired to have her stranded safe
enough, in a sheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be got off again with
as little labor and danger as might be; and until that was done I considered that my life would
certainly be spared.

While I was thus turning the business over in my mind, I had not been idle with my body. I
had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once more into my shoes, and laid my hand at random on
a bottle of wine, and now, with this for an excuse, I made my reappearance on the deck.

Hands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a bundle, and with his eyelids lowered,
as though he were too weak to bear the light. He looked up, however, at my coming, knocked
the neck off the bottle, like a man who had done the same thing often, and took a good swig,
with his favorite toast of "Here's luck!" Then he lay quiet for a little, and then, pulling
out a stick of tobacco, begged me to cut him a quid.

"Cut me a junk o' that," says he, "for I haven't no knife, and hardly strength enough, so be
as I had. Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I've missed stays! Cut me a quid, as'll likely be the last,
lad; for I'm for my long home, and no mistake."

"Well," said I, "I'll cut you some tobacco; but if I was you and thought myself so badly, I
would go to my prayers, like a Christian man."

"Why?" said he. "Now, you tell me why."

"Why?" I cried. "You were asking me just now about the dead. You've broken your trust; you've
lived in sin and lies and blood; there's a man you killed lying at your feet this moment; and
you ask me why! For God's mercy, Mr. Hands, that's why."

I spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket, and designed,
in his ill thoughts, to end me with. He, for his part, took a great draught of the wine, and
spoke with the most unusual solemnity.

"For thirty years," he said, "I've sailed the seas, and seen good and bad, better and worse,
fair weather and foul, provisions running out, knives going, and what not. Well, now I tell
you, I never seen good come o' goodness yet. Him as strikes first is my fancy; dead men don't
bite; them's my views--amen, so be it. And now, you look here," he added, suddenly changing
his tone, "we've had about enough of this foolery. The tide's made good enough by now. You
just take my orders, Cap'n Hawkins, and we'll sail slap in and be done with it."

All told, we had scarce two miles to run; but the navigation was delicate, the entrance to
this northern anchorage was not only narrow and shoal, but lay east and west, so that the schooner
must be nicely handled to be got in. I think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I am very
sure that Hands was an excellent pilot; for we went about and about, and dodged in, shaving
the banks, with a certainty and a neatness that was a pleasure to behold.

Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us. The shores of North Inlet
were as thickly wooded as those of the southern anchorage; but the space was longer and narrower,
and more like, what in truth it was, the estuary of a river.

Right before us, at the southern end, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation.
It had been a great vessel of three masts, but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of
the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed, and on the deck of
it shore bushes had taken root, and now flourished thick with flowers. It was a sad sight,
but it showed us that the anchorage was calm.

"Now," said Hands, "look there; there's a pet bit for to beach a ship in. Fine flat sand, never
a catspaw, trees all around of it, and flowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship."

"And once beached," I inquired, "how shall we get her off again?"

"Why, so," he replied: "you take a line ashore there on the other side at low water; take a
turn about one o' them big pines; bring it back, take a turn round the capstan, and lie-to
for the tide. Come high water, all hands take a pull upon the line, and off she comes as sweet
as natur'. And now, boy, you stand by. We're near the bit now, and she's too much way on her.
Starboard a little--so--steady--starboard--larboard a little--steady--steady!"

So he issued his commands, which I breathlessly obeyed; till, all of a sudden, he cried: "Now,
my hearty, luff!" And I put the helm hard up, and the Hispaniola swung round rapidly, and ran
stem on for the low wooded shore.

The excitement of these last maneuvers had somewhat interfered with the watch I had kept hitherto,
sharply enough, upon the coxswain. Even then I was still so much interested, waiting for the
ship to touch, that I had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head, and stood craning
over the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before the bows. I might
have fallen without a struggle for my life, had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me, and
made me turn my head. Perhaps I had heard a creak, or seen his shadow moving with the tail
of my eye; perhaps it was an instinct like a cat's; but, sure enough, when I looked round,
there was Hands, already halfway toward me, with the dirk in his right hand.

We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met; but while mine was the shrill cry of terror,
his was a roar of fury like a charging bull's. At the same instant he threw himself forward,
and I leaped sideways toward the bows. As I did so I let go of the tiller, which sprang sharp
to leeward; and I think this saved my life, for it struck Hands across the chest and stopped
him, for the moment, dead.

Before he could recover, I was safe out of the corner where he had me trapped, with all the
deck to dodge about. Just forward of the mainmast I stopped, drew a pistol from my pocket,
took a cool aim, though he had already turned and was once more coming directly after me, and
drew the trigger. The hammer fell, but there followed neither flash nor sound; the priming
was useless with sea-water. I cursed myself for my neglect. Why had not I, long before, reprimed
and reloaded my only weapons? Then I should not have been as now, a mere fleeing sheep before
this butcher.

Wounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his grizzled hair tumbling over
his face, and his face itself as red as a red ensign with his haste and fury. I had no time
to try my other pistol, nor, indeed, much inclination, for I was sure it would be useless.
One thing I saw plainly: I must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedily hold me
boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so nearly boxed me in the stern. Once so caught,
and nine or ten inches of the bloodstained dirk would be my last experience on this side of
eternity. I placed my palms against the mainmast, which was of a goodish bigness, and waited,
every nerve upon the stretch.

Seeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused; and a moment or two passed in feints on his part,
and corresponding movements upon mine. It was such a game as I had often played at home about
the rocks of Black Hill Cove; but never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly beating
heart as now. Still, as I say, it was a boy's game, and I thought I could hold my own at it,
against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh. Indeed, my courage had begun to rise so high
that I allowed myself a few darting thoughts on what would be the end of the affair; and while
I saw certainly that I could spin it out for long, I saw no hope of any ultimate escape.

Well, while things stood thus, suddenly the Hispaniola struck, staggered, ground for an instant
in the sand, and then, swift as a blow, canted over to the port side, till the deck stood at
an angle of forty-five degrees, and about a puncheon of water splashed into the scupperholes,
and lay in a pool between the deck and bulwark.

We were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us rolled, almost together, into the scuppers;
the dead red-cap, with his arms still spread out, tumbled stiffly after us. So near were we,
indeed, that my head came against the coxswain's foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle.
Blow and all, I was the first afoot again; for Hands had got involved with the dead body. The
sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on; I had to find some new
way of escape, and that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me. Quick as thought
I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand, and did not draw a breath till
I was seated on the crosstrees.

I had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a foot below me, as I pursued
my upward flight; and there stood Israel Hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to
mine, a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment.

Now that I had a moment to myself, I lost no time in changing the priming of my pistol, and
then, having one ready for service, and to make assurance doubly sure, I proceeded to draw
the load of the other, and recharge it afresh from the beginning.

My new employment struck Hands all of a heap; he began to see the dice going against him; and
after an obvious hesitation, he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds, and, with the
dirk in his teeth, began slowly and painfully to mount. It cost him no end of time and groans
to haul his wounded leg behind him; and I had quietly finished my arrangements before he was
much more than a third of the way up. Then, with a pistol in either hand, I addressed him.

"One more step, Mr. Hands," said I, "and I'll blow your brains out! Dead men don't bite, you
know," I added, with a chuckle.

He stopped instantly. I could see by the working of his face that he was trying to think, and
the process was so slow and laborious that, in my new-found security, I laughed aloud. Then
with a swallow or two, he spoke, his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity.
In order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth, but, in all else, he remained unmoved.

"Jim," says he, "I reckon we're fouled, you and me, and we'll have to sign articles. I'd have
had you but for that there lurch: but I don't have no luck, not I; and I reckon I'll have to
strike, which comes hard, you see, for a master mariner to a ship's younker like you, Jim."

I was drinking in his words and smiling away, as conceited as a cock upon a wall, when, all
in a breath back went his right hand over his shoulder. Something sang like an arrow through
the air; I felt a blow and then a sharp pang, and there I was pinned by the shoulder to the
mast. In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment--I scarce can say it was by my own volition,
and I am sure it was without a conscious aim--both my pistols went off, and both escaped out
of my hands. They did not fall alone; with a choked cry, the coxswain loosed his grasp upon
the shrouds, and plunged head first into the water.

     Stevenson was not one of the men who can write only one sort of
     thing. The numerous little poems contained in the first volume of
     this series show his sympathetic knowledge of children, while his
     essays prove that he could handle serious subjects in a most
     masterly manner. The extract from Treasure Island which you have
     just been reading displays his skill in still another field--the
     writing of stories of pure adventure.

     One of the striking things in all Stevenson's writings is his power
     of vivid description, his ability to make us see things. Nor does
     he make us wait while he gives us page-long descriptions; he
     suggests pictures to us with a few words. It may be safely said of
     descriptions, when they are part of a story, that those which are
     given in the fewest words, if those few words are the right ones,
     are most effective. Stevenson fully grasped this fact, and that is
     the reason he is able to bring all his scenes before us so vividly,
     without wearying our patience.

JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER[381-1]

By GRACE E. SELLON

Near the town of Haverhill, Massachusetts, in the old homestead of his father's family, the
poet John Greenleaf Whittier was born December 17, 1807. Like all the other children who generation
after generation had come to live in this Quaker dwelling, he was brought up in simple, useful
ways, and was early given his full share of the duties about the farm. No matter how sharply
the cold of the harsh New England winter pierced his homespun clothes, the snow must be shoveled
from the paths, firewood must be brought, the stalls in the barn must be littered, and, worst
task of all for him, seven cows must be milked. Yet there was plenty of fun to be had, too.
When the snow fell so heavily that it blocked all the roads and closed in tightly about the
house, the two Whittier boys found it exciting work to dig their way to the outside world.

When the early twilight fell and passed into night, the boys with their sisters joined the
group gathered about the great hearth, and there listened to stories of Indians, witches and
Christian martyrs, and to many another weird or adventurous tale told by the older members
of the family. While they were being thus entertained, the blaze of the red logs went roaring
up the chimney,

    "The house-dog on his paws outspread
    Laid to the fire his drowsy head,
    The cat's dark silhouette on the wall
    A couchant tiger's seemed to fall;
    And, for the winter fireside meet,
    Between the andirons' straddling feet,
    The mug of cider simmered slow,
    The apples sputtered in a row,
    And, close at hand, the basket stood
    With nuts from brown October's wood."

All too soon this pleasant time came to an end, and the boys must go to their bare, unheated
room upstairs. There, the poet has written,

    "Within our beds awhile we heard
    The wind that round the gables roared,
    With now and then a ruder shock,
    Which made our very bedsteads rock.
    We heard the loosened clapboards tost,
    The board-nails snapping in the frost;
    And on us, through the unplastered wall,
    Felt the lightsifted snowflakes fall;
    But sleep stole on, as sleep will do
    When hearts are light and life is new;
    Faint and more faint the murmurs grew,
    Till in the summer-land of dreams
    They softened to the sound of streams.
    Low stir of leaves, and dip of oars,
    And lapsing waves on quiet shores."

In the warm season, though there was much to do in helping plant and harvest the crops, there
were good times to be had in climbing to the top of Job's hill, next to the house, where the
friendly oxen were pastured, or in gathering berries or nuts, or in watching the birds, bees
and squirrels as they worked or played about their homes. It was these delights of his childhood
that the poet was calling to remembrance when he wrote The Barefoot Boy, which may be found
elsewhere in these volumes.

Probably there are few country lads to-day who know so little as did the Whittier boys of the
common sights and pleasures of city life. The strict Quaker belief regarding children's amusement
barred them from most of the enjoyment familiar to the young people in the great world that
lay beyond their home. So little were they acquainted with the forbidden attractions at the
circus that one time when President Monroe visited Haverhill, Greenleaf (as the poet was known
in his home), looking next day for traces of the presence of the great man, whom he had not
been allowed to see, came upon the tracks of an elephant that had been in town with a traveling
menagerie, and in his ignorance believed that these were the footsteps of the famous visitor.
The theater, so the children were taught, was to be shunned as a place of wickedness. Once
when Greenleaf was visiting in Boston he was asked to go to a play by a lady whom he met in
the home where he was staying. When he found that the lady was an actress, he became so much
afraid of being led into sinful ways that, not daring to remain longer, he started off at once
for home.

Though young Whittier was a wide-awake boy and eager to learn, there was only the district
school, held for a few weeks each winter, for him to attend. Yet an opportunity was not lacking
for bringing to light his poetic gift. One of his schoolmasters, who lived for part of the
term in the Whittier home, used to read to the family from various interesting books, and one
night chose for their entertainment a volume of Burns's poems. As the lines of the much-loved
Scotch poet fell from the reader's lips, the young boy listened as he had never before listened
in his life. His own power awakened and responded warmly to that of the older poet. From that
hour, whether he was at home or at school, he found great pleasure in writing verses, which
he often showed to his young friends. Thus it was that his older sister Mary was able, all
unknown to him, to send off one of his poems to the Newburyport Free Press. When the paper
containing the verses came, the young poet read the lines over and over again, almost too dazed
to recognize them as his own. This contribution was followed by another made to the same paper.
By this time the editor's interest had been so much aroused that, learning from the postman
of the author's whereabouts, he traveled to Haverhill to visit him. This editor was no other
than William Lloyd Garrison, who later became famous as a leader of the cause of abolition.
He urged strongly that the boy's education be continued. Perhaps his words would have counted
for nothing, however, had it not been that somewhat later the editor of the Haverhill Gazette,
in which some of young Whittier's verses had been published, entreated the boy's parents to
send him to the new Haverhill Academy. His father's consent having been gained, Greenleaf learned
from a man who worked on the farm how to make slippers, and thus he became able to pay his
own expenses during a term at the Academy. By teaching school in the winter, and by helping
to keep the books of a Haverhill merchant, he was able to provide for a second term. Thus was
completed his regular schooling.

In the meanwhile his friend Garrison had kept an eye on him, and at the close of 1825 secured
for him the editorship of The American Manufacturer, a weekly magazine published in Boston.
Young Whittier entered with great interest into the work, contributing articles on politics
and temperance as well as numerous poems. Though he received only nine dollars a week, he was
able, when called back to Haverhill in 1829, by his father's illness, to give about one half
of what he had earned to help remove the mortgage on the farm.

He remained at home until his father's death in 1830, editing for a time the Haverhill Gazette
and sending to the New England Review, of Hartford, Connecticut, various poems and articles.
So much favor did these find with the editor, George D. Prentice, that he invited the young
writer to fill his position during a temporary absence. The offer was highly complimentary,
for the Review was the principal political journal in Connecticut supporting Henry Clay. However,
Whittier was well prepared for the work, for he had become acquainted with the leaders and
with the chief interests of the Whig party while editing the Manufacturer, and was himself
an enthusiastic follower of Clay. His common sense and shrewd but kindly reading of human nature,
united with a high sense of honor and justice, enabled him to fill this responsible position
with marked success until his failing health forced him to give it up in January, 1832.

There was much reason for Whittier to look for success in political life, for his editorial
work had made him widely known as a man of sane and practical views, and he was so highly regarded
in the district where he lived that had he reached the required age of twenty-five, he would
in all probability have been made a candidate for Congress in 1832. Thus it was that although
he had published more than a hundred favorably received poems between 1828 and 1832, he wrote
in the latter year: "My prospects are too good to be sacrificed for any uncertainty. I have
done with poetry and literature."

A far nobler mission, however, and greater usefulness than he could have planned for himself
lay before Whittier. It was not political success that was to draw forth the greatness of his
nature. The strong and fearless interest with which his friend Garrison had begun to champion
the abolition of slavery in the United States appealed to him, he felt with all his heart that
the cause was right, and, closing his eyes to the bright promise of political success, he chose
to unite himself with the scorned and mistreated upholders of freedom. After thorough consideration
and study, he wrote and published in 1833 the pamphlet Justice and Expediency, in which he
set forth fully the arguments against slavery. This was the first of his strong and stirring
protests against oppression. From that time until the close of the Civil War his fervent, fearless
love of liberty voiced itself through ringing verses, in constant appeals to the conscience
of the nation. The greatness of this influence, as it worked silently in men's hearts, who
can estimate?

Whittier's part in the anti-slavery struggle was not always a quiet one. On one occasion, when
in company with a famous but unpopular English reformer he was to address an audience on the
subject of abolition, he was attacked by a mob while passing quietly along the street with
a friend, and narrowly escaped being tarred and feathered. Somewhat later he was set upon in
another town by a crowd armed with sticks and stones and other missiles, from which he fled
with more haste than dignity. It was while he was editor of the Freeman that Pennsylvania Hall,
where the Philadelphia Abolitionists held their meetings, was burned by a mob, and the papers
from Whittier's editorial room in this building were used to help start the blaze.

In 1836 the farm at Haverhill had been sold, and a cottage was bought in Amesbury near the
Quaker meetinghouse. It was in this quiet place, under the loving care of his mother and sister,
that Whittier made his home after resigning his position with the Freeman. These two women
were in their way as unselfishly devoted to the cause of freedom as was the poet himself, for
they encouraged his loyalty and bore privation uncomplainingly. In the darkest hour of their
need, when it seemed as if their home must be mortgaged, Whittier was invited to become a contributor
to the Atlantic Monthly, then being founded, and thus the long period of want was brought to
an end.

After the death of his mother, in the following year (1858), Whittier's association with his
sister Elizabeth became even closer than before, though they had always shared each other's
hopes and interests with unusual sympathy and understanding. When she died, in 1864, it seemed
to him that part of his life had gone with her. It was with this grief still fresh in his mind
that he wrote the best known of his poems, Snow-Bound, A Winter Idyl, in which he pictures
in the most simple and lifelike manner the quiet loveliness of his childhood home. With especial
tenderness he tells of the much-loved sister, and lets his mingled grief and hope of reunion
be seen:

    "As one who held herself a part
    Of all she saw, and let her heart
      Against the household bosom lean,
    Upon the motley-braided mat
    Our youngest and our dearest sat,
    Lifting her large, sweet, asking eyes,
    Now bathed within the fadeless green
    And holy peace of Paradise.
    Oh, looking from some heavenly hill,
      Or from the shade of saintly palms,
      Or silver reach of river calms,
    Do those large eyes behold me still?
    With me one little year ago:--
    The chill weight of the winter snow
      For months upon her grave has lain;
    And now, when summer south-winds blow,
      And brier and harebell bloom again,
    I tread the pleasant paths we trod,
    I see the violet-sprinkled sod,
    Whereon she leaned, too frail and weak,
    The hillside flowers she loved to seek,
    Yet following me where'er I went
    With dark eyes full of love's content.
    The birds are glad; the brier-rose fills
    The air with sweetness; all the hills
    Stretch green to June's unclouded sky;
    But still I wait with ear and eye
    For something gone which should be nigh,
    A loss in all familiar things,
    In flower that blooms, and bird that sings.
    And yet, dear heart! remembering thee,
      Am I not richer than of old?
    Safe in thy immortality,
      What change can reach the wealth I hold?
      What chance can mar the pearl and gold
    Thy love hath left in trust with me? Then
    entering his house, he took off his
      hat, and gave it to one of his attendants.
    His secretary, Temple, had run down
      stairs to meet him, inquiring what
    was the cause of the disturbance.

"Only,"
    said Lord Oldborough, "that I have
    served the people, but never bent
      to them."
    
      "Curse them! they are not worth serving.

Oh! I thought they'd have taken my lord's life that minute," cried his faithful servant Rodney.
"The sight left my eyes. I thought he was gone for ever. Thank God! he's safe. Take off my
lord's coat--I can't--for the soul of me. Curse those ungrateful people!"

"Do not curse them, my good Rodney," said Lord Oldborough, smiling. "Poor people, they are not ungrateful,
only mistaken. Those who mislead them are to blame. The English are a fine people. Even an
English mob, you see, is generous, and just, as far as it knows."

Lord Oldborough was sound asleep this night, before any other individual
in the house had finished talking of the dangers he had escaped.

The civil and military courage shown by the minister in the sudden attack upon his character and
person were such as to raise him again at once to his former height in public esteem. His enemies
were obliged to affect admiration. The Greenwich party, foiled in this attempt, now disavowed
it. News of a victory effaced the memory of the late disappointment. Stocks rose--addresses
for a change of ministry were quashed--addresses of thanks and congratulation poured in--Lord
Oldborough gave them to Mr. Temple to answer, and kept the strength of his attention fixed upon
the great objects which were essential to the nation and the sovereign he served.

Mr. Falconer saw that the storm had blown over, the darkness was past--Lord
Oldborough, firm and superior, stood bright in power, and before him
the commissioner bent more obsequious, more anxious than ever.

    Anxious he might well be--unhappy father! the life,
    perhaps, of one of his sons, his honour, certainly,
    at stake--the fortune of another--his existence
    ruined!

And what hopes of propitiating him, who had so suffered by the favour
he had already shown, who had been betrayed by one of the family and
disgraced by another.

The commissioner's only hope was in the recollection of the words,
"I pity you from my soul, sir," which burst from Lord Oldborough even
at the moment when he had most reason to be enraged against Colonel
Falconer.

Following up this idea, and working on the generous compassion, of
which, but for this indication, he should not have supposed the stern
Lord Oldborough to be susceptible, the commissioner appeared before
him every day the image of a broken-hearted father.

In silence Lord Oldborough from time to time looked at him; and by
these looks, more than by all the promises of all the great men who
had ever spoken to him, Mr. Falconer was reassured; and, as he told
Mrs. Falconer, who at this time was in dreadful anxiety, he felt certain
that Lord Oldborough would not punish him for the faults of his sons--he
was satisfied that his place and his pension would not he taken from
him--and that, at least in fortune, they should not be utterly ruined.

In this security the commissioner showed rather more than his customary degree of strength
of mind, and more knowledge of Lord Oldborough's character than he had upon most other occasions
evinced.

Things were in this state, when, one morning, after the minister had given orders that no one
should be admitted, as he was dictating some public papers of consequence to Mr. Temple, the
Duke of Greenwich was announced. His grace sent in a note to signify that he waited upon Lord
Oldborough by order of his majesty; and that, if this hour were not convenient, he begged to
have the hour named at which his grace could be admitted. His grace was admitted instantly. Mr.
Temple retired--for it was evident this was to be a secret conference. His grace of Greenwich
entered with the most important solemnity--infinitely more ceremonious
than usual; he was at last seated, and, after heavy and audible sighs,
still hesitated to open his business.

Through the affected gloom and dejection of his countenance Lord Oldborough saw a malicious pleasure
lurking, whilst, in a studied exordium, he spoke of the infinite reluctance with which he had
been compelled, by his majesty's express orders, to wait upon his lordship on a business the
most painful to his feelings. As being a public colleague--as a near and dear connexion--as
a friend in long habits of intimacy with his lordship, he had prayed his majesty to be excused;
but it was his majesty's pleasure: he had only now to beg his lordship to believe that it was with
infinite concern, &c. Lord Oldborough, though suffering under this circumlocution, never condescended
to show any symptom of impatience; but allowing his grace to run the changes on the words and forms
of apology, when these were exhausted, his lordship simply said, that "his majesty's pleasure
of course precluded all necessity for apology."

His grace was vexed to find Lord Oldborough still unmoved--he was
sure this tranquillity could not long endure: he continued, "A sad
business, my lord--a terrible discovery--I really can hardly bring
myself to speak--"

Lord Oldborough gave his grace no assistance.

"My private regard," he repeated.

A smile of contempt on Lord Oldborough's countenance.

"Your lordship's hitherto invulnerable public integrity--"

A glance of indignation from Lord Oldborough.

"Hitherto invulnerable!--your grace will explain."

"Let these--these fatal notes--letters--unfortunately got into the hands of a leading, impracticable
member of opposition, and by him laid--Would that I had been apprised, or could have conceived
it possible, time enough to prevent that step; but it was done before I had the slightest intimation--laid
before his majesty--"

Lord Oldborough calmly received the letters from his grace.

"My own handwriting, and private seal, I perceive."

The duke sighed--and whilst Lord Oldborough drew out, opened, and
read the first letter in the parcel, his grace went on--"This affair
has thrown us all into the greatest consternation.

It is to be brought before parliament immediately--unless a resignation should take place--which
we should all deplore. The impudence, the inveteracy of that fellow, is astonishing--no silencing
him. We might hush up the affair if his majesty had not been apprised; but where the interest of
the service is concerned, his majesty is warm."

"His majesty!" cried Lord Oldborough: "His majesty could not, I trust, for a moment imagine these
letters to be I mine?"

"But for the hand and seal which I understood your lordship to acknowledge, I am persuaded his
majesty could not have believed it."

"Believed! My king! did he believe it?" cried Lord Oldborough. His agitation was for a moment
excessive, uncontrollable. "No! that I will never credit, till I have it from his own lips."
Then commanding himself, "Your grace will have the goodness to leave
these letters with me till to-morrow."

His grace, with infinite politeness and regret, was under the necessity of refusing this request.
His orders were only to show the letters to his lordship, and then
to restore them to the hands of the member of opposition who had laid
them before his majesty.

Lord Oldborough took off the cover of one of the letters, on which was merely the address and seal.
The address was written also at the bottom of the letter enclosed, therefore the cover could
not be of the least importance. The duke could not, Lord Oldborough said, refuse to leave this
with him.

To this his grace agreed--protesting that he was far from wishing to make difficulties. If there
were any thing else he could do--any thing his lordship would wish to have privately insinuated
or publicly said--

His lordship, with proud thanks, assured the duke he did not wish
to have any thing privately insinuated; and whatever it was necessary
to say or do publicly, he should do himself, or give orders to have
done.

His lordship entered into no farther explanation.

The duke at last was obliged to take his leave, earnestly hoping
and trusting that this business would terminate to his lordship's
entire satisfaction.

     
     
     No sooner was the duke gone than Lord Oldborough rang for his carriage.

"Immediately--and
     Mr. Temple, instantly."
     
     Whilst his carriage was coming to the door, in the shortest manner possible
     Lord Oldborough stated the facts to his secretary, that letters
     had been forged in his lordship's name, promising to certain persons
     promotion in the army--and navy--gratification--and pensions. Some
     were addressed to persons who had actually obtained promotion, shortly
     after the time of these letters; others contained reproaches for
     having been ill-used. Even from the rapid glance Lord Oldborough
     had taken of these papers, he had retained the names of several
     of the persons to whom they were addressed--and the nature of the
promotion obtained.

They were persons who could have had no claim upon an honest minister.

His lordship left a list of them with Mr. Temple--also the cover of
the letter, on which was a specimen of the forged writing and the
private seal.

"I am going to the king. In my absence, Mr. Temple, think for me--I know you feel for me. The
object is to discover the authors of this forgery."

"My lord, may I consult with Mr. Alfred Percy?"

"Yes--with no other person."

It was not Lord Oldborough's day for doing business with the king. He was late--the king was
going out to ride. His majesty received the minister as usual; but notwithstanding the condescension
of his majesty's words and manner, it was evident to Lord Oldborough's penetration, that there was
a coldness and formality in the king's countenance.

"I beg I may not detain your majesty--I see I am late," said Lord Oldborough.

"Is the business urgent, my lord?"

"No, sir; for it concerns principally myself: it can, therefore, wait your majesty's leisure at
any hour your majesty may appoint."

The king dismounted instantly.

"This moment, my lord, I am at leisure for any business that concerns your lordship."

The king returned to the palace--Lord Oldborough followed, and all
the spectators on foot and horseback were left full of curiosity.

Notwithstanding the condescension of his majesty's words and manner, and the polite promptitude
to attend to any business that concerned his lordship, it was evident to Lord Oldborough's
penetration that there was an unusual coldness and formality in the king's countenance and
deportment, unlike the graciousness of his reception when satisfied and pleased. As soon as the
business of the day had been gone through, Lord Oldborough said he must now beg his majesty's
attention on a subject which principally concerned himself. The king looked as one prepared to
hear, but determined to say as little as possible.

Lord Oldborough placed himself so as to give the king the advantage of the light, which he did not
fear to have full on his own countenance.

"Sir, certain letters, signed with my name, and sealed with my seal,
have, I am informed, been laid before your majesty."

"Your lordship has been rightly informed."

"I trust--I hope that your majesty--"

At the firm assertion, in the tone with which Lord Oldborough pronounced,
I trust--his majesty's eye changed--and moved away from Lord Oldborough's,
when he, with respectful interrogation of tone, added, "I hope your
majesty could not believe those letters to be mine."

"Frankly, my lord," said the king, "the assertions, the insinuations of no man, or set of men,
of any rank or weight in my dominions, could by any imaginable means have induced me to conceive
it possible that such letters had been written by your lordship. Not for one moment could
my belief have been compelled by any evidence less strong than your lordship's handwriting
and seal.

I own, I thought I knew your lordship's seal and writing; but I now see that I have been deceived,
and I rejoice to see it."

"I thank your majesty. I cannot feel surprise that a forgery and a counterfeit which, at first view,
compelled my own belief of their being genuine, should, for a moment, have deceived you, sir;
but, I own, I had flattered myself that my sovereign knew my heart and character, yet better than
my seal and signature."

"Undoubtedly, my lord."

"And I should have hoped that, if your majesty had perused those letters, no assertions could
have been necessary, on my part, to convince you, sir, that they could not be mine. I have now
only to rejoice that your majesty is undeceived; and that I have
not intruded unnecessarily with this explanation.

I am fully sensible, sir, of your goodness, in having thus permitted me to make, as early as
possible, this assertion of my innocence. For the proofs of it, and for the detection of the
guilty, I am preparing; and I hope to make these as clear to you, sir, as your majesty's assurance
of the pleasure you feel in being undeceived is satisfactory--consolatory to me," concluded
Lord Oldborough, with a bow of profound yet proud respect.

"My lord," said the king, "I have no doubt that this affair will redound to your honour, and
terminate to your lordship's entire satisfaction."

The very phrase used by the Duke of Greenwich.

"As to myself, your lordship can have no farther anxiety; but I wish
your lordship's endeavours to detect and bring proofs home to the
guilty may be promptly successful--for the gratification of your own
feelings, and the satisfaction of the public mind, before the matter
should be brought forward in parliament."

His majesty bowed, and as Lord Oldborough retired, he added some
gracious phrases, expressive of the high esteem he felt for the minister,
and the interest he had always, and should always take, in whatever
could contribute to his public and private--satisfaction--(again).

To
an eye and ear less practised in courts than this minister's, all
that had been said would have been really satisfactory: but Lord Oldborough
discerned a secret embarrassment in the smile, a constraint in the
manner, a care, an effort to be gracious in the language, a caution,
a rounding of the periods, a recurrence to technical phrases of compliment
and amity, a want of the free fluent language of the heart; language
which, as it flows, whether from sovereign or subject, leaves a trace
that the art of courtier or of monarch cannot imitate. In all attempts
at such imitation, there is a want, of which vanity and even interest
is not always sensible, but which feeling perceives instantly. Lord
Oldborough felt it--and twice, during this audience, he was on the
point of offering his resignation, and twice, exerting strong power
over himself, he refrained.

He saw plainly that he was not where
he had been in the king's confidence; that his enemies had been at
work, and, in some measure, had succeeded; that suspicions had been
infused into the king's mind. That his king had doubted him, his majesty
had confessed--and Lord Oldborough discerned that there was no genuine
joy at the moment his majesty was undeceived, no real anxiety for
his honour, only the ostensible manifestation suitable to the occasion--repeatable--or
recordable.

Still there was nothing of which he could complain; every
expression, if written down or repeated, must have appeared proper
and gracious from the sovereign to his minister; and for that minister
to resign at such a moment, from pride or pique, would have been fatal
to the dignity, perhaps to the integrity, of his character.

Lord
Oldborough reasoned thus as he stood in the presence of the king,
and compelled himself, during the whole audience, and to the last
parting moment, to preserve an air and tone of calm, respectful self-possession.

CHAPTER
XXXVIII.

During Lord Oldborough's absence, his faithful secretary
had been active in his service. Mr. Temple went immediately to his
friend Alfred Percy. Alfred had just returned fatigued from the courts,
and was resting himself, in conversation with his wife and Caroline.

"I
am sorry to disturb you, Alfred," said Mr. Temple, "but I must take
you away from these ladies to consult you on particular business."

"Oh!
let the particular business wait till he has rested himself," said
Mrs. Percy, "unless it be a matter of life and death."

"Life and
death!" cried Lady Frances Arlington, running in at the open door--"Yes,
it is a matter of life and death!--Stay, Mr. Temple! Mr. Percy! going
the moment I come into the room--Impossible!"

"Impossible it would
be," said Mr. Temple, "in any other case; but--"

"'When a lady's
in the case, You know all other things give place,'"

cried Lady Frances.
"So, positively, gentlemen, I stop the way. But, Mr. Temple, to comfort
you--for I never saw a man, gallant or ungallant, look so impatient--I
shall not be able to stay above a moment--Thank you, Mrs. Percy, I
can't sit down--Mrs. Crabstock, the crossest of Crabstocks and stiffest
of pattern-women, is in the carriage waiting for me. Give me joy--I
have accomplished my purpose, and without Lady Jane Granville's assistance--obtained
a permit to go with Lady Trant, and made her take me to Lady Angelica's
last night. Grand conversazione!--Saw the German baron! Caught both
the profiles--have 'em here--defy you not to smile. Look," cried her
ladyship, drawing out of her reticule a caricature, which she put
into Caroline's hand; and, whilst she was looking at it, Lady Frances
went on speaking rapidly. "Only a sketch, a scrawl in pencil, while
they thought I was copying a Sonnet to Wisdom--on the worst bit of
paper, too, in the world--old cover of a letter I stole from Lady
Trant's reticule while she was at cards. Mr. Temple, you shall see
my chef-d'oeuvre by and by; don't look at the reverse of the medal,
pray. His wife was of so gentle and tactful a nature that their home was always a well-ordered
and pleasant place of rest for the busy doctor, where unwelcome visitors and other annoyances
were not allowed to take his time. Yet he was never too much occupied to find pleasure in what
interested his wife and his three children.

During all these years when the profession of medicine had been of chief concern to him, and
even before he had begun his medical studies, he had occasionally written poems that won a
good deal of praise from friends, but brought no widespread notice. From his very earliest
years he could feel very keenly and remember the melody of verse. "The low, soft chirp of the
little bird heard in the nest, while his mother is brooding over him," he has written, "lives
in his memory, I doubt not, through all the noisy carols of the singing season; so I remember
the little songs my mother sang to me when I was old enough to run about, and had not outgrown
the rhymes of the nursery." He enjoyed writing poems for the yearly meetings held by his college
class long after their graduation, and he made several contributions to the Harvard Collegian.
Just once in these early years had his fame traveled far, and that was the occasion when he
wrote Old Ironsides. The frigate Constitution that had served the country so well was to be
done away with as a useless vessel. Learning of this, Holmes penned in haste the stanzas that
stirred the nation's feelings and saved the old boat from destruction.

It came, then, as a surprise to the American people, when upon the founding of the Atlantic
Monthly in 1857, the name of Holmes was signed to the articles that probably were most popular
of all published in that magazine, to which the greatest literary men in the country were contributing.
The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table, was the title of the delightful series of humorous essays
in which the author seemed really to be talking to his readers. A sort of story bound the numbers
together. In the fourth issue appeared, perhaps, the best poem written by Holmes--The Chambered
Nautilus. This was a favorite with him and was one of those poems of which he said: "I did
not write it, but it was written through me," for he believed it to be a work of inspiration.

The Autocrat, which is Holmes' greatest work, was followed by two similar but inferior series,
The Professor at the Breakfast Table and The Poet at the Breakfast Table. Between the last
two series he had published in 1861 his novel Elsie Venner, followed in 1867 by The Guardian
Angel, and in 1885 by A Mortal Antipathy. The first of these novels is considerably the best,
but none of them ranks high, for they all deal with unusual people who because of weird inherited
traits of mind are forced to go through strange if not impossible experiences.

Still another kind of writing was attempted by Holmes. In 1878 he completed a biography of
his intimate friend, the historian Motley, and in 1884 wrote a life of Emerson. These are not,
however, among his best productions. Over the Teacups, similar to the Breakfast Table papers,
appeared in 1890, and was his last important work.

In 1886, accompanied by his daughter, he spent four months in Europe, chiefly in England. The
warm welcome and high honor given him by the English people were very gratifying to the aged
professor. He was always at his best when talking, and so brilliant and easy was his wit that
had not politeness forbidden he could have entertained a roomful of people during a whole evening.
This fact as well as his literary achievements made him popular everywhere.

On the occasion when he received a degree of honor from Cambridge University, the young collegemen
greeted him by singing at the tops of their voices a song of "Holmes, sweet Holmes;" and on
a similar occasion at Oxford one of the students, making good use of the title of a poem especially
known to Holmes' young readers, asked from the gallery whether the Doctor had come in the "One-Hoss
Shay." It is likely that the worthy old gentleman was quite as pleased with this hearty good
will as with the more dignified tributes received during his memorable visit.

After 1890, Holmes wrote only occasionally. Yet he continued to take his usual walks and to
answer a part of his large correspondence, leaving the rest to a secretary. Now and then he
would go to a concert or to a dinner among friends, and in other ways he showed himself remarkably
active. In fact, he had not become feeble in mind or body when death quietly came to him, October
7th, 1894.

Though the brightness of his wit makes Holmes one of the most entertaining of writers it is
his deep kindness that gives to what he has written an even greater power and attractiveness.
More than all else, he tried both in his writings and in his everyday living to drive away
the shadows of all kinds of suffering, and to share with others the cheerfulness of his own
genial nature.

    "Long be it ere the table shall be set
    For the last breakfast of the Autocrat,
    And love repeat with smiles and tears thereat
    His own sweet songs that time shall not forget."[405-1]

     even the polite lies of society and the common and apparently
     harmless lies of business life, are always and wholly wrong?

FOOTNOTES:

[406-1] The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table is the most famous and the best of the prose works
of Oliver Wendell Holmes. It consists of a series of rambling talks on a great variety of subjects,
addressed to the people who sit at his table in a boarding house. Holmes himself is the "Autocrat,"
and his sparkling talks are full of wit and wisdom. Among those who regularly sit at the Autocrat's
table is a schoolboy, whom he calls Benjamin Franklin, and to whom he tells this beautiful
story of the Cubes of Truth.

[406-2] When the old Greek hero, Hercules, was a youth, and nearing manhood, two women appeared
to him, both offering beautiful gifts. One of the women was Duty, the other Pleasure. Hercules
chose to accept the gifts of Duty and to follow her. The opportunity to make this choice did
not come till he was old enough to understand. In Holmes' beautiful allegory the cubes and
spheres are presented long before that time, even in early childhood.

[407-3] The schoolmistress is one of the most lovable of the characters introduced by Mr. Holmes
into The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table. At first she appears only at intervals, but in the
book her love story and her marriage to the Autocrat afford the chief interest.

THE LOST CHILD

By JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL

    I wandered down the sunny glade
      And ever mused, my love, of thee;
    My thoughts, like little children, played,
      As gayly and as guilelessly.

    If any chanced to go astray,
      Moaning in fear of coming harms,
    Hope brought the wanderer back alway,
      Safe nestled in her snowy arms.

    From that soft nest the happy one
      Looked up at me and calmly smiled;
    Its hair shone golden in the sun,
      And made it seem a heavenly child.

    Dear Hope's blue eyes smiled mildly down.
      And blest it with a love so deep,
    That, like a nursling of her own,
      It clasped her neck and fell asleep.

JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL

By GRACE E. SELLON

Down the street, about a mile from the center of Cambridge, Massachusetts, stands a square,
three-story colonial dwelling house, sheltered by pines and great English elms and surrounded
by flowering shrubs. In this home, for many years known as Elmwood, the great American poet
and essayist was born February 22, 1819, and it was here that he lived during the greater part
of his life. In the woods and meadows that lay about Elmwood in the poet's childhood he spent
much time, for he liked especially to be out-of-doors; and so it was that in his earliest years
he began to feel the great love for flowers, birds and trees that made him able in later life
to show to the readers of his poems how much beauty there is in the very commonest things of
nature.

However, all of the things he liked were not out-of-doors. In his father's library were more
than three thousand books, and he began when only a small boy to choose for himself favorite
authors. He seems to have been unusually fond of books, for in a little note written when he
was eight years old,--his first letter, so far as any one knows,--he tells his brother, "I
read French stories," and adds in a postscript, "I have got three books." The next year, in
a letter to the same brother he writes, "I have got quite a library."

After learning his letters and other simple things at an elementary school, Lowell was sent
when about nine years old to a higher school, where he was thoroughly taught Latin, and otherwise
prepared for his entrance into Harvard College in 1834. He was then only fifteen years of age,
yet he had such decided tastes in his studies that he was not always willing to give attention
to the work required in his college courses, but would follow his own inclinations in his reading.
The result was, that though he gained such a reputation among his class-mates for appreciation
of literature and ability in original composition that he was made one of the editors of Harvardiana,
the college paper, and was chosen in his senior year to write the class poem, yet he was looked
upon with growing disapproval by his instructors, because of his irregular ways. At length,
it is told, he completely disgraced himself, on the day he was chosen class poet, by rising
at the close of the evening prayer service and bowing solemnly to right and left. As punishment
for this and all preceding misconduct, he was sent to Concord to continue his studies under
a private teacher, and was not allowed to return to Harvard until after classday. Nevertheless,
he wrote his poem and later had it printed, for his friends, in a little pamphlet.

After receiving his degree from Harvard in 1838, Lowell decided upon the law as the profession
most suitable for him to follow, for at that time a literary career in the United States held
out no assurance of a living, even to the best writers. In the preceding year he had written
to his intimate friend Shackford: "I thought your brother Charles was studying law. I intend
to study that myself, and probably shall be Chief Justice of the United States." This modest
prediction, however, was not to be fulfilled, for after completing a course at the Harvard
Law School in 1840 and practicing with but slight interest and success for two years, he gave
up the law for a more congenial occupation.

His letters to his confidants "Shack" and Loring during the years at college show his aspiration
to become a poet. He reports from time to time his progress in verse making and comments more
or less favorably on his "effusions." This writing of pottery--as it pleased him to call it--continued
with more serious interest after his graduation, so that in 1840 he was ready to publish a
volume of verse entitled "A Year's Life."

The same year was marked by another event of special importance,--his engagement to Maria White,
a young woman who was herself a poet and who was deeply interested in all the movements of
thought that were making toward freedom and justice before the Civil War. Her influence upon
Lowell was to strengthen greatly his confidence in his own best powers as a man and a poet
and to help develop in him the broad, kind democratic feeling for his fellow-men that most
endears him to his readers. This growth of the poet's character seems the more remarkable when
it is considered that his father, a Unitarian minister, was a man who, though most generous
and well-meaning in his regard for others, was well enough content with conditions in his country
to feel little sympathy with the reforms then being urged for securing fuller liberty and equality.
In his new enthusiasm Lowell turned away from the influence of his younger days and became
devoted to the cause of abolition.

In 1842, after abandoning the law, he founded a magazine, The Pioneer, which, however, was
issued only three times. After this unsuccessful venture he went back to his poetry, and late
in 1843 published a second volume of verse. In the following year appeared his first critical
studies in prose, Conversations on Some of the Old Poets. This work, like most of the first
book of poems, Lowell found in later life to be unworthy of reprinting.

The income from his writings, though small, was sufficient for him to marry in 1844; and not
long after this event he became a regular contributor to the Anti-Slavery Standard. In this
appeared the first series of the Biglow Papers, in which, through vigorous prose and verse,
largely in the Yankee dialect of Hosea Biglow, he protested against the evils that brought
on the Mexican War. The collected numbers of the series were published in 1848 and shared the
popularity of two other of Lowell's greatest works, produced in the same year,--the Fable for
Critics and The Vision of Sir Launfal, a beautiful narrative poem filled with the spirit of
Christian brotherhood.

It was not long after this that Lowell began to feel that his work as a writer for the abolitionist
cause was narrowing in its effect. For "red-hot" reform he had no liking. It seemed to him
that the hope of his cause lay not so much in treating others harshly as in living according
to the high principles that the reformers professed. "The longer I live," he wrote, "the more
am I convinced that the world must be healed by degrees. I see why Jesus came eating meat and
drinking wine and companying with publicans and sinners. He preached the highest doctrine,
but he lived the life of other men.... Let us sow the best seed we have ... and convert other
men by our crops, not by drubbing them with our hoes or putting them under our harrows." He
decided, then, to take life in a more leisurely way and let the poetic power that he considered
his best gift express itself freely.

In 1851, accompanied by his wife and his two children, Lowell visited Europe. The months spent
abroad gave him much wished-for opportunities for study and observation, but they were darkened
by the death of his son Walter. Close upon this sorrow came the death of Mrs. Lowell in the
following year (1853), after the return of the family to Elmwood. From that time for many months
the poet could find relief from his keen sense of loss only in his literary work, and in the
companionship of his daughter Mabel, the only one of his four children who had lived.

Some lectures on the English poets given at the Lowell institute in 1854-55 found so much favor
with the authorities at Harvard College that soon afterward he was appointed to succeed Longfellow
as professor of foreign languages and literatures. After a period of study in Europe, he assumed
charge of classes at Harvard in 1856, and for sixteen years continued in this work, bringing
to it with most remarkable success all the warmth and sincerity and broad scope of his own
interest in the subjects that he taught. Not many months afterward he was still further honored
by being given the editorship of the newly founded Atlantic Monthly, a position that he held
until 1861. The year 1857 was made memorable also by his marriage to Miss Frances Dunlap, a
much-valued friend and the governess of his daughter. In 1864 he became joint editor of the
North American Review, and in this magazine continued the second series of the Biglow Papers,
begun in the Atlantic Monthly, the series in which is expressed his finest power as a poet-patriot.
Of the same excellence is the famous Commemoration Ode written for memorial ceremonies held
at Harvard College in honor of the students who had fallen during the war. Among other contributions
to these periodicals were numerous studies of poets and poetry--essays that rank among the
best of their kind. Thus did Lowell prove himself to possess a rare combination of the powers
of original composition and of criticism.

So ably had he served the best interests of his country through his writings, that in 1877
he was appointed Minister of the United States to Spain, and served here until 1880, when he
was sent as Minister to England. These high trusts, it proved, had not been wrongly placed.
Lowell's devotion to the truest American principles, together with his large experience in
public affairs, made him a most successful diplomat. He was given high honors by British universities,
and he made many friends in England.

After his return to America in 1885 he withdrew gradually from his former active life. Occasionally
he wrote and lectured, and several times he made trips to England where he always received
a cordial welcome. It was in his much loved Elmwood that death came to him August 12, 1891.

Lowell was a man of wide learning, and has a prominent place in American literature for his
exceptional critical ability and delightful wit, and for the artistic excellence of both his
prose and poetry; but the secret of his power lies not so much in these things as in the sincerity
and vigor of thought that rise above all bookishness, and in the warm human feeling that reached
out for the love of his fellow-men rather than for fame and distinction. Probably that which
most endears him to his countrymen is the quality he attributes to others in these words of
admiration: "I am sure that both the President (Hayes) and his wife have in them that excellent
new thing we call Americanism, which, I suppose, is that 'dignity of human nature' which the
philosophers of the last century were always seeking and never finding, and which, after all,
consists, perhaps, in not thinking yourself either better or worse than your neighbors by reason
of any artificial distinction. As I sat behind them at the concert the other night, I was profoundly
touched by the feelings of this kingship without mantle and crown from the property-room of
the old world. Their dignity was in their very neighborliness, instead of in their distance."
Certainly in the realm of American literature, there is no one better entitled than Lowell
to this "kingship without mantle and crown."

A CHILD'S THOUGHT OF GOD

By ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING

    They say that God lives very high,
      But if you look above the pines
    You cannot see our God, and why?

    And if you dig down in the mines
      You never see Him in the gold;
    Though, from Him, all that's glory shines.

    God is so good, He wears a fold
      Of heaven and earth across His face--
    Like secrets kept, for love, untold.

    But still I feel that His embrace
      Slides down by thrills, through all things made,
    Through sight and sound of every place.

    As if my tender mother laid
      On my shut lids, her kisses' pressure,
    Half-waking me at night, and said,
      "Who kissed you through the dark, dear guesser?"

ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING

Round the young life of Elizabeth Barrett was so much of illness and dreariness, that we have
accustomed ourselves to thinking joy came to her only with her marriage, and we forget, often,
that her childhood was not unhappy. Few children, it would seem, were ever born with greater
promise of a bright life. Her father was wealthy and generous; she had brothers and sisters
near her in age and congenial in tastes, and she was, at least, a fairly strong, active child.

She was born on March 6, 1806, at Coxhoe Hall, in the county of Durham, and when she was but
three years old, her father removed to Hope End, in Herefordshire. The estate which he purchased
there was a beautiful one, and the house, with its Turkish windows and Oriental-looking decorations,
was most picturesque. That the scenery which surrounded her in her youth made on Elizabeth
an impression which remained with her all her life is shown clearly in various passages in
her poems:

        "Green the land is where my daily
        Steps in jocund childhood played,
        Dimpled close with hill and valley,
        Dappled very close with shade;
    Summer-snow of apple-blossoms running up from glade to glade."

Of all the brothers and sisters, Elizabeth was her father's favorite, and he encouraged her
constantly in her precocious studies and in her childish attempts at composition. Long before
she was able to read Homer in the original, she came upon Pope's translation of the Iliad,
and it took a rare hold upon her. She showed its influence and her own bent toward poetry by
composing, before she was fourteen, an epic on the "Battle of Marathon," of which her father,
to whom it was dedicated, thought so highly that he had it printed and circulated it among
his friends. But she also showed the influence of her beloved Iliad in a much more childish
way, of which she has written delightfully in a poem called Hector in the Garden. A great flower
bed, roughly shaped like a man and bordered about with turf, was made for her, and this she
named after Hector, the Trojan hero and her great favorite.

    "Eyes of gentianellas azure,
    Staring, winking at the skies;
    Nose of gillyflowers and box;
    Scented grasses put for locks,
    Which a little breeze at pleasure
    Set a-waving round his eyes."

    "Brazen helm of daffodillies,
    With a glitter toward the light;
    Purple violets for the mouth,
    Breathing perfumes west and south;
    And a sword of flashing lilies,
    Holden ready for the fight."

    "And a breastplate made of daisies,
    Closely fitting, leaf on leaf;
    Periwinkles interlaced
    Drawn for belt about the waist;
    While the brown bees, humming praises,
    Shot their arrows round the chief."

It was natural enough that Elizabeth should have wanted to begin the study of Greek; and with
the help of her father and of Mr. Boyd, a blind friend of her father's, she became a most proficient
Greek scholar.

When she was fifteen years old she met with an accident which deprived her in part of the out-of-door
life and rambles which she had loved, and threw her more than ever upon her books for company.
Impatient because a horse which she desired to ride was not ready just when she wanted it,
she went out into the field and attempted to saddle it herself. She fell, with the saddle on
top of her; and while this did not leave her the invalid she later became, it weakened her
and made her an easy prey to the troubles which afterward came upon her.

That Pope, as well as Homer, left his mark on Miss Barrett was shown by her first published
volume, which was brought out when she was about twenty. It was entitled An Essay on Mind,
and Other Poems, and the poem which gave its name to the book was quite after the manner of
Pope. This poem, while remarkable for a girl of Miss Barrett's age, contained little freshness
or originality, and she spoke of it afterwards as having been "long repented of as worthy of
all repentance."

In 1828 Mrs. Barrett died, and left Elizabeth, the eldest of the ten children, with much of
the responsibility of the family. Since her death came before her daughter reached fame or
began that voluminous correspondence from which have been gathered most of the facts of her
life, little can be known of the mother's character, or of her influence on her daughter. That
Miss Barrett was devotedly attached to her mother, however, is to be seen from a sentence in
one of her letters. "Her memory," she says, "is more precious to me than any earthly blessing
left behind!"

The beloved home at Hope End was sold in 1832, owing, apparently to some fall in the family
fortunes, and the Barretts removed to Sidmouth, in Devonshire. The life there was uneventful,
as the life at Hope End had been. Miss Barrett, in writing later of herself, declared that
"a bird in a cage would have as good a story." But she was by no means idle, for her Greek
studies and her writing kept her busy and happy. While at Sidmouth, she brought out a translation
of the Prometheus Bound of Æschylus, a version with which she was so dissatisfied that she
later replaced it, in her collected works, with another.

For three years the Barretts lived at Sidmouth, and their removal to London, in 1835, made
important changes in Elizabeth's life. Her health, never good since her fifteenth year, broke
down, and from some date shortly after the arrival in London she became an apparently hopeless
invalid, confined to her room and often to her bed. Some compensation for this confinement,
however, she found in the new friends, few, indeed, but devoted and congenial, who were admitted
to her sick room. Chief among these friends of her earlier London years were John Kenyon, a
distant cousin, and Mary Russell Mitford, author of Our Village. Miss Mitford made the acquaintance
of Miss Barrett in one of the latter's rare appearances in society, and she has left an account
of the meeting and a description of Miss Barrett which is famous.

"She was certainly one of the most interesting persons that I had ever seen. Everybody who
then saw her said the same; so that it is not merely the impression of my partiality or my
enthusiasm. Of a slight, delicate figure, with a shower of dark curls falling on either side
of a most expressive face, large tender eyes, richly fringed by dark eyelashes, a smile like
a sunbeam, and such a look of youthfulness that I had some difficulty in persuading a friend
... that the translatress of the Prometheus of Æschylus, the authoress of the Essay on Mind,
was old enough to be introduced into company,--in technical language, was 'out.'"

Although Miss Mitford was nineteen years older than Miss Barrett, the friendship which sprang
up between them was most close, and lasted until Miss Mitford's death in 1855. Their correspondence
was constant and voluminous, as was that, in fact, of Miss Barrett with all of her intimate
friends. These letters of hers from her sick room are no more remarkable for number than for
brightness and vivacity. Little mention is made of her ailments, except when her friends have
specifically demanded news of her health, and the letters deal rather with literary than with
other subjects. This was, of course, most natural; the invalid could have little news to communicate
from her couch to her friends in the outer world. Her literary activity, too, increased, and
she began to contribute to magazines poems of various kinds, which attracted much attention.
Not all comment on them was favorable; the people declared that some of them were Sphinx-like--too
difficult, if not impossible, of interpretation. But every one realized that here was a real
poet, one of striking individuality, and, for a woman, most remarkable learning.

By the autumn of 1838, her health had become so much worse that the doctor ordered removal
to a warmer climate, and she was taken to Torquay, where she remained for three years. Her
father and her brothers and sisters visited her there from time to time, but her constant companion
was her brother Edward, who had all her life been her favorite. What little good Torquay seemed
to be doing her was more than overbalanced by a tragedy which occurred in the summer of 1840.
Her brother, with two of his friends, went for a sail in a small boat, intending to be absent
only until evening. When they did not return, inquiry was set on foot, and it was learned that
a small boat had been seen to founder in Babbicombe Bay. The fears caused by this report became
certainty three days later, on the recovery of the bodies. The effect on Miss Barrett may be
partially imagined. Not only had she lost her best-loved companion, but she was haunted by
the morbid feeling that she had caused his death, since he had come to Torquay only to be with
her. Twelve years afterward she wrote: "I have lived heart to heart with my husband these five
years. Don't send me away, after allowing me to waste my time 'ere--which is of value to me,
let me tell yer, whatever yours is!--like this!... Well, well, there's
'ard people in this world?

I'm going, Sir ... I 'ave sufficient dignity to take a 'int ... You 'aven't got even a trifle
to spare an old University Scholar in redooced circumstances then?... Ah, it's easy to see
you ain't been at a University yourself--you ain't got the hair of it! Farewell, Sir, and may
your lot in life be 'appier than--All right, don't hexcite yourself. During the spring and summer of 1841 she was able to resume work
on translations, compositions, plans for new poems. Indeed, it was this which saved her, for
she wrote some time later to a friend--"I do believe I should be mad at this moment, if I had
not forced back the current of rushing recollections by work, work, work."

After her return to London in the autumn of 1841, her life went on as before--or rather, stood
still as before. From her couch she continued to send forth the poems which were bringing her
ever-increasing fame, and the letters which were binding her friends closer to her. But an
event was drawing nearer, which was from the first an event and not an episode in Miss Barrett's
life. In January, 1845, we find her writing "And I had a letter from Browning the poet last
night, which threw me into ecstasies--Browning, the author of Paracelsus, and the king of mystics;"
and a little later she says, "I am getting deeper and deeper into correspondence with Robert
Browning, poet and mystic, and we are growing to be the truest friends."

Robert Browning had felt and expressed great admiration for Miss Barrett's poems and an allusion
to himself in her Lady Geraldine's Courtship gave him an excuse for addressing her. Their correspondence
flourished, and they rapidly passed from regarding each other as mere acquaintances, to looking
upon each other as friends. In fact, there seems to have been from the very first an almost
mystical attraction between them. Miss Barrett might have contented herself all her life with
this delightfully personal and literary correspondence, but Browning soon grew impatient and
expressed his desire to see her. I thought you was as soft-edded a young mug as you look. Open
that door, will yer; I want to get out of this 'ole!"

Here he leaves you with every indication of disgust and disappointment, and you will probably
hear him indulging in unclassical vituperation on the landing.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

The Baron is delighted with MONTAGU WILLIAMS's third volume of Reminiscences, published by
MACMILLAN & Co. His cheery after-dinner conversational style of telling capital stories is
excellent. He is not writing a book, he is talking to us; he is telling us a series of good
things, and, quoth the Baron, let me advise you to light your cigar and sit down in your armchair
before the fire, as not only do you not wish to interrupt him, even with a query, but you
feel inclined to say, as the children do when, seated round you in
the wintry twilight, they have been listening to a story which has
deeply interested them--"Go on, please, tell us another!"

The following interpolated "aside," most characteristic of MONTAGU WILLIAMS's life-like conversational
manner of telling a story, occurs at page 8, where giving an account of a robbery, of which he
himself was the victim, and telling how a thief asked to be shown
up to his, the narrator's room, he says, "The porter, like a fool,
gave his consent."

The interpolated "like a fool," carries the jury, tells the whole story, and wins admiration for the
sufferer, who is the real hero of the tale. But beyond the book's merit as an interesting
and amusing companion, it contains some valuable practical suggestions
for relieving the ordinary distress in the poorest districts which
ought to receive attention in the highest quarters. 'Look at this--and
this--and this,' throwing down all my disadvantages. To which he did not answer by a single
compliment, but simply that he had not then to choose, and that I might be right or he might
be right, he was not there to decide; but that he loved me, and should to his last hour.* *
* He preferred, he said, of free and deliberate choice, to be allowed to sit only an hour a
day by my side, to the fulfilment of the brightest dream which should exclude me, in any possible
world."

What Robert Browning wanted so much, it was a foregone conclusion that he would have; and Miss
Barrett was at last brought to consent to an engagement. But the difficulties were just begun.
Mr. Barrett, adored as he was by his daughter, was more than a little tyrannical, especially
with his favorite daughter. His family all well knew that he would never under any circumstances
be brought to consent to the marriage of any of his children; and he had, moreover, in the
case of Elizabeth, the appearance of reason on his side, in that she was, in the opinion of
her family and of most of her medical advisers, a hopeless invalid, unfit to be moved. "A life
passed between a bed and a sofa, and avoiding too frequent and abrupt transitions even from
one to the other, was the only life she could expect on this earth." Browning believed otherwise,
and events showed that he was right.

In the autumn of 1845, the doctors advised that Miss Barrett be taken to Italy, declaring,
in fact, that her life depended upon it. Some of her brothers or sisters could easily have
accompanied her; there was no lack of money, and the journey was actually planned. For no apparent
reason, however, Mr. Barrett refused his consent--said that his daughter should not leave his
house. In vain the family argued; in vain a generous friend offered to accompany Miss Barrett,
paying all expenses. He was brutally firm. Much hurt by this selfishness and disregard for
her life, Miss Barrett promised Browning that if she lived through the winter and were no worse
in the following year, she would marry him without her father's consent, for which they knew
it was useless to ask. Accordingly, on September 12, 1846, she walked out of her father's house,
accompanied only by her maid, was married and returned home. One week later she joined her
husband, and they set out for Italy, their future home. Mr. Barrett never forgave his daughter,
and his unrelenting anger was a deep sorrow to her, in the midst of her great life happiness.

The Brownings went first to Pisa, and from there to Florence, which they afterward regarded
as their home, though they made many excursions and spent seasons elsewhere. Mrs. Browning
grew so much better that a friend said to her, "You are not improved, you are transformed;"
and while she was never strong and was often very ill, she never again sank back to the state
in which she had been before her marriage. The happiness which shows in her letters is wonderful.
"As for me," she writes, "when I am so good as to let myself be carried upstairs, and so angelical
as to sit still on the sofa, and so considerate, moreover, as not to put my foot into a puddle,
why my duty is considered done to a perfection, which is worthy of all adoration." And again,
"If I could open my heart to you in all seriousness, you would see nothing there but a sort
of enduring wonder of happiness."

Mrs. Browning, like her husband, loved Italy, and especially Florence, and many of her poems,
notably the Casa Guidi Windows, deal with Italian subjects. Of the poems published after her
marriage, however, none are more exquisite than the series of Sonnets from the Portuguese.
These sonnets, which are not translations, and to which the name From the Portuguese was given
simply as a blind, describe her uncertainty and her joy in the love which was hers.

In 1849 another joy came to her. On March 9th of that year a son, Robert Wiedeman Barrett Browning
was born, and from that time on her letters, quite like the letters of any unliterary mother,
are full of the wonderful doings of this child. Not that her interest in things literary flagged
in the least; she read everything which the libraries of Italy afforded, or which her friends
could send to her--novels, for which she confessed to a great liking; poems, political pamphlets,
newspapers, all that came to her hand. Her longest and greatest poem, Aurora Leigh, was written
during her Italian years. While the story of the poem is in no sense autobiographical, the
heroine is in her beliefs and her ideals Mrs. Browning's self, and this was the poem by which
she felt herself most willing to be judged.

Broken by several trips to England and by excursions to the most beautiful parts of Italy,
the years slipped by in uneventful happiness. Many friends visited the Brownings, and all came
away wondering and delighted at the perfect family life they had been allowed to witness. Frail
always, Mrs. Browning was spoken of by acquaintances in her later years as seeming "scarce
embodied at all."

In June, 1861, Mrs. Browning had an attack of bronchial trouble and on the night of the twenty-ninth,
alone in the room with her husband, she died; and one writer says "none ever saw Browning upon
earth again, but only a splendid surface." Mrs. Browning was buried at Florence, the city she
had loved. Upon the wall of Casa Guidi, the building in which she had lived, the citizens,
grateful for her love and understanding of them, placed a marble tablet in her memory.

The wonderful thing about Elizabeth Barrett Browning is that from her weakness should have
come poems of such strength. There was nothing morbid in the words which came from her hushed,
darkened sick room. Indeed, her spirit was never tamed, and she herself confessed that one
of her faults was "head-longness;" that she snatched parcels open instead of untying the string,
and tore letters instead of cutting them. In Browning's poems, which contain numerous beautiful
allusions to her, there is nothing more beautiful and more descriptive than the lines--

    "O lyric love, half angel and half bird,
    And all a wonder and a wild desire." 

He found the dean and his lady tete-a-tete.

Their raised voices suddenly stopped short as he entered.

The dean gave an angry look at his servant as Alfred came into the
room.

"Your servants," said Alfred, "told me that you were not at home,
but I told them that I knew the dean would be at home to an old friend."

"You

are very good,--(said Buckhurst)--you do me a great deal of honour," said the dean.

Two different manners appeared in the same person: one natural--belonging to his former, the other
assumed, proper, as he thought, for his present self, or rather for his present situation.

"Won't
you be seated? I hope all our friends--" Mrs. Buckhurst, or, as she was called, Mrs. Dean Falconer,
made divers motions, with a very ugly chin, and stood as if she thought there ought to be
an introduction. The dean knew it, but being ashamed to introduce her, determined against it.
Alfred stood in suspension, waiting their mutual pleasure.

"Won't you sit down, sir?" repeated the dean.

Down plumped Mrs. Falconer directly, and taking out her spectacles,
as if to shame her husband, by heightening the contrast of youth and
age, deliberately put them on; then drawing her table nearer, settled
herself to her work.

Alfred, who saw it to be necessary, determined to use his best address
to conciliate the lady.

"Mr. Dean, you have never yet done me the
honour to introduce me to Mrs. Falconer."

"I thought--I thought we
had met before--since--Mrs. Falconer, Mr. Alfred Percy." This was the inimitable Don Quixote, which gives
the burlesque adventures of the self-styled "Knight of the Rueful Countenance." This book was
not intended to satirize knight-errantry itself, for that had long before died out in Spain.
What it did aim to do was to make ridiculous the romances of chivalry over which all Spain
at the time of Cervantes seemed to have gone mad. How well Cervantes succeeded in his aim may
be known from the fact that after the appearance of his masterpiece, no new romance of chivalry
was published in Spain.

The hero of this great work, Don Quixote, is presented as the most courteous and affable of
gentlemen, wise on all points except those pertaining to chivalry. It was not only, however,
the masterly drawing of the characters of Don Quixote and his squire, Sancho Panza, which made
the book popular; the inexhaustible fund of humor has made it to the present day a book which
every one delights to read.

The following selections from Don Quixote describe some of the typical adventures of the gallant
"Knight of the Rueful Countenance," and will serve to give the reader an idea of the book.

DON QUIXOTE PREPARES TO SET OUT ON HIS ADVENTURES

In a village of La Mancha there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance
in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla[433-1]
of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays,
and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest
of it went in a doublet of fine cloth, and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays,
while on week days he made a brave figure in his best homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper
past forty, a niece under twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle
the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this gentlemen of ours was bordering on
fifty, he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman.
They will have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for here there is some difference of
opinion among the authors who write on the subject), although from reasonable conjectures it
seems plain that he was called Quixana. This, however, is of but little importance to our tale;
it will be enough not to stray a hair's breadth from the truth in the telling of it. 

Opinion obtained freedom for women; by opinion they may be again enslaved. It is therefore the interest
of the female world, and of society, that women should be deterred by the dread of shame from
passing the bounds of discretion. No false lenity, no partiality in favour of amusing talents
or agreeable manners, should admit of exceptions which become dangerous examples of impunity.
The rank and superior understanding of a delinquent ought not to be considered in mitigation,
but as aggravating circumstances.

In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion that ever madman in this
world hit upon, and that was that he fancied it was right and requisite, as well for the support
of his own honor as for the service of his country, that he should make a knight-errant of
himself, roaming the world over in full armor and on horseback in quest of adventures, and
putting in practice himself all that he had read of as being the usual practices of knights-errant;
righting every kind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in the issue,
he was to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself crowned by the might
of his arm Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so, led away by the intense enjoyment he found
in these pleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith to put his scheme into execution.

The first thing he did was to clean up some armor that had belonged to his great-grandfather,
and had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner eaten with rust and covered with mildew. Accept
my sincere thanks, inimitable Gabrielle! for having taken off my hands a lover, who really
has half-wearied me to death. If you had dealt more frankly with me, I could, however, have
saved you much superfluous trouble and artifice. I now perfectly comprehend the cause of poor
R----'s strange silence some months ago; he was then under the influence of your charms, and
it was your pleasure to deceive me even when there was no necessity for dissimulation.
 The ease with which he had knocked it to pieces
disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that danger he set to work again, fixing bars
of iron on the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, not caring to try
any more experiments with it, he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most perfect construction.

He next proceeded to inspect his hack, which surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus[435-3] of
Alexander or the Babieca of the Cid.[435-4] Four days were spent in thinking what name to give
him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse belonging to a knight so
famous, and one with such merits of his own, should be without some distinctive name, and he
strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant,
and what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a new character, he
should take a new name, and that it should be a distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting
the new order and calling he was about to follow. "In conclusion, Sir, you 'ave doubtless done
me the hinjustice to expect, from all I 'ave said, that my hobjick in obtaining this interview
was to ask you for pecuniary assistance?" (Here you reflect with remorse that a suspicion to
this effect has certainly crossed your mind). "Nothing of the sort or kind, I do assure you.
A little 'uming sympathy, the relief of pouring out my sorrers upon
a feeling art, a few kind encouraging words, is all I arsk, and that,
Sir, the first sight of your kind friendly face told me I should not
lack.

Pore as I am, I still 'ave my pride, the pride of a English gentleman, and if you was to orfer
me a sovereign as you sit there, I should fling it in the fire--ah, I should--'urt and indignant
at the hinsult!"
 Recollecting, however, that the valiant Amadis[436-6] was not content to call
himself curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make
it famous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to add on the
name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote of La Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described
accurately his origin and country, and did honor to it in taking his surname from it.
