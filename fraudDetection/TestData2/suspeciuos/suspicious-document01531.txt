The situation continues to be critical, and must be so until the fate of Ladysmith is decided.
Our own men are justifying to the full the confidence reposed in them; what men can do they
will accomplish. But the Boers are fighting stubbornly, and may be able to wear out Sir Redvers
Buller's force before their own resistance collapses. We at home must wait patiently, hoping
for the best but prepared for fresh efforts. At least we ought all now to realise that the
splendid behaviour of our soldiers in the field lays upon us as citizens the duty of securing
for the future the best possible treatment of those who are so generous of their lives.

THE ELEVENTH HOUR

February 1st, 1900

If on Tuesday the Bank of England had announced that it could not meet its obligations I imagine
that there would have been a certain amount of uneasiness in the City and elsewhere, and that
some at least of the rich men to be found in London would have put their heads together to
see what could be done to meet a grave emergency.

On Tuesday a failure was indeed announced--a failure which must involve the Bank of England
and most of the great banking and trading corporations of this country. But no one seems to
have taken action upon it, and I see no visible sign of general alarm. That was Lord Salisbury's
explanation and defence of the failure of his Government in the diplomacy which preceded the
war, in the preparations for the war, and in the conduct of the war. It was a declaration of
bankruptcy--a plain statement by the Government that it cannot govern. The announcement was
not made to Parliament with closed doors and the reporters excluded. It was made to the whole
world, to the British Nation, and to all the rivals of Great Britain. Parliament did not take
any action upon the declaration. No committee of both Houses was formed to consider how without
delay to make a Government that can govern. The ordinary normal routine of public and private
life goes on. Thus in the crisis of the Nation's fate we are ungoverned and unled, and to all
appearance we are content to be so, and the leader-writers trained in the tradition of respectable
formalism interpret the Nation's apathy as fortitude.

Lord Salisbury's confession of impotence was true. From the beginning to the end of this business
the Government has lacked the manliness to do its plain duty. In the first half of July, before
the official reports of the Bloemfontein conference were published, everyone but the disciples
of Mr. Morley knew that the only honourable course, after the Government's declaration prior
to the conference and after what there took place, was to insist on the acceptance by the South
African Republic of the Bloemfontein proposals and to back up that insistence by adequate military
preparations. It is admitted that this was not done, and what is the excuse now made? Mr. Balfour
told the House of Commons on Tuesday, January 30th, that if in August a vote of credit had
been demanded "we should not have been able to persuade the House that the necessity for the
vote was pressing and urgent." The Government charged with the defence of the Empire excuses
itself for not having made preparations for that task on the ground that perhaps the House
of Commons would not have given its approval. Yet the Government had a great majority at its
back, and there is no instance in recent times of a vote of credit having been rejected by
the House of Commons. The fate of the latter is briefly recorded in the two words, "not seconded."
Mr. Morris was a man of distinguished ability, great personal influence, and undoubted patriotism,
but, out of all that assemblage--comprising, as it did, such admitted friends of centralism
as Hamilton, King, Wilson, Randolph, Pinckney, and others--there was not one to sustain him in the
proposition to incorporate into the Constitution that theory which now predominates, the theory
on which was waged the late bloody war, which was called a "war for
the Union."

It failed for want of a second, and does not even appear in the official journal of the Convention.
The very fact that such a suggestion was made would be unknown to us but for the record kept
by Mr. Madison.

The extracts which have been given, in treating of special branches of the subject, from the writings
and speeches of the framers of the Constitution and other statesmen of that period, afford
ample proof of their entire and almost unanimous accord with the principles which have been established
on the authority of the Constitution itself, the acts of ratification by the several States,
and other attestations of the highest authority and validity. I am well aware that isolated expressions
may be found in the reports of debates on the General and State Conventions and other public
bodies, indicating the existence of individual opinions seemingly inconsistent with these principles;
that loose and confused ideas were sometimes expressed with regard to sovereignty, the relations
between governments and people, and kindred subjects; and that, while the plan of the Constitution
was under discussion, and before it was definitely reduced to its present shape, there were earnest
advocates in the Convention of a more consolidated system, with a stronger central government.
But these expressions of individual opinion only prove the existence of a small minority of
dissentients from the principles generally entertained, and which finally prevailed in the formation
of the Constitution. None of these ever avowed such extravagances of doctrine as are promulgated
in this generation. No statesman of that day would have ventured to risk his reputation by
construing an obligation to support the Constitution as an obligation
to adhere to the Federal Government--a construction which would have
insured the sweeping away of any plan of union embodying it, by a
tempest of popular indignation from every quarter of the country.

None of them suggested such an idea as that of the amalgamation of the people of the States into
one consolidated mass--unless it was suggested by Mr. Gouverneur Morris in the proposition above
referred to, in which he stood alone among the delegates of twelve sovereign States assembled
in convention.

As to the features of centralism, or nationalism, which they did advocate, all the ability of
this little minority of really gifted men failed to secure the incorporation of any one of
them into the Constitution, or to obtain their recognition by any of the ratifying States. On the
contrary, the very men who had been the leading advocates of such theories, on failing to secure
their adoption, loyally accepted the result, and became the ablest and most efficient supporters
of the principles which had prevailed. Thus, Mr. Hamilton, who had favored the plan of a President
and Senate, both elected to hold office for life (or during good behavior), with a veto power
in Congress on the action of the State Legislatures, became, through
the "Federalist," in conjunction with his associates, Mr. Madison
and Mr. Jay, the most distinguished expounder and advocate of the
Constitution, as then proposed and afterward ratified, with all its
Federal and State-rights features.

In the ninth number of that remarkable series of political essays, he quotes, adopts, and applies
to the then proposed Constitution, Montesquieu's description of a "CONFEDERATE REPUBLIC,"
a term which he (Hamilton) repeatedly employs.

In the eighty-first number of the same series, replying to apprehensions expressed by some that
a State might be brought before the Federal courts to answer as defendant in suits instituted
against her, he repels the idea in these plain and conclusive terms. Unless, therefore, there
is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the Convention, it will remain with the States,
and the danger intimated must be merely ideal.... The contracts between a nation and individuals
are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force.
They confer no right of action, independent of the sovereign will. To what purpose would it
be to authorize suits against States for the debts they owe? How could recoveries be enforced?
 Any new Cabinet, except one containing Mr. Morley or Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman,
would be given a chance. The House of Commons would wait a few weeks to see how it bore itself.
If there were prompt evidences of knowledge and will in the measures adopted, even though half
the Ministers or all of them except Lord Rosebery were new men, there would soon be a feeling
of confidence, and the Nation, knowing that it was led, would respond with enthusiasm. In that
case Great Britain might make a good fight, though no one who knows the state of our preparations
and those of the rest of the world will make a sanguine prediction as to the result.

TRY, TRY, TRY AGAIN

February 8th, 1900

Sir Redvers Buller on Monday set out on his third attempt to relieve Ladysmith. He appears
to have made a feint against the Boer position north of Potgieter's Drift, and, while there
attracting the attention of the Boers by the concentrated fire of many guns, to have pushed
a force of infantry and artillery across the river to the right of Potgieter's Drift. This
force, of which the infantry belongs to Lyttelton's brigade, carried and defended against counter
attack a hill called Vaal Krantz, at the eastern end of the Brakfontein ridge. To the east
of Vaal Krantz runs a good road to Ladysmith, along which the distance from the Tugela to Sir
George's White's outposts is about ten miles. To the east again of the road is a hill called
Dorn Kop. Here the Boers have an artillery position which seems to command Vaal Krantz, and
they probably have the usual infantry trenches. The Boer position then faces the Tugela and
runs from Spion Kop on the west, the Boer left, to Dorn Kop on the east, the Boer right. Sir
Redvers Buller's attack is an attempt to pierce the centre of this position.

To break the centre of an enemy's line, to pour your forces into and through the gap, and then
roll up the more important of his divided wings, is an operation which if it can be successfully
executed makes a decisive victory; if followed up it ruins the enemy's army. But it is in modern
conditions the most difficult form of attack. The long range of modern weapons, of guns that
kill at two miles and of rifles that kill at a mile--to take a moderate estimate of their power--enables
the defender to concentrate upon any attack against his centre the fire of all the rifles in
his front line for a couple of miles, and of all the guns standing on a length of four miles.
A similar concentration of fire is only occasionally and temporary possible for the assailant,
though if it should happen that the ground exposes a point of the defender's line to such concentric
fire, while it protects some points held by the assailant, the attack would have a prospect
of success. But the moment the point of attack is recognised by the defender he will collect
every available battery and rifleman from all parts of his line and place them on that portion
of his front which commands the path of the assailant. To prevent this the assailant must engage
the defender along his whole line so that all the defending forces are fully occupied and there
are none to spare for the critical point or region.

Sir Redvers Buller's task is rendered harder by the fact that his own troops before they can
attack must cross the Tugela. He has two bridges at the point here supposed to have been selected
for the main attack, but troops can hardly cross a bridge at a quicker rate than a brigade
an hour, and as the Boers ride faster than the British infantry can walk, and as the British
troops south of the river cannot effectually engage the Boers, it will not have been easy so
to occupy the enemy along the whole front as to prevent his massing guns and rifles--at any
rate rifles--to defend his centre.

So much for the initial difficulties, which seem by a combination of feint and surprise to
have been so far overcome on Monday that the advanced British troops effected a lodgment in
the centre of the Boer position, from which a counter-attack failed to eject them. The next
thing is, as the British force is brought across the river, to attack one of the Boer wings
while containing or keeping back the other. Before this, can be done the enemy's centre must
really be pierced, so that troops can be poured through the gap to turn the flank of one of
the enemy's divided halves. This piercing is most difficult in the conditions of to-day, for
the enemy by establishing a new firing line behind the point carried by our troops may be able
to enclose in a semicircle of fire the party that has made its way into the position. Against
such an enveloping fire it is a hard task to make headway.

All these aspects of his problem a General thinks out before he starts; he does not make his
attempt unless and until he sees his way to meet the various difficulties, both those inherent
in the nature of the operation and those that arise from the local conditions and from the
character of the particular enemy. The difficulties are therefore not reasons why General Buller
should not succeed, but their consideration may help to show why with the best previous deliberation
and with the bravest of troops he may perhaps not be able to break the Boer resistance.

There is one feature of his task that is perhaps not fully appreciated by the public. In order
to relieve Ladysmith he must thoroughly defeat and drive away the Boer army--must, so to speak
break its back. For, supposing he could clear a road to Ladysmith and march there, leaving
the Boer army in position on one or both sides of his road, his position on reaching the place
would be that he would have to fight his way back again, and that unless he could then defeat
the Boers his Army would be lost, for it would be cut off from its supplies. The relief of
Ladysmith and the complete defeat of the Boer army are therefore synonymous terms. There is,
however, a sense in which a partial defeat of the Boers would be of use. If the Boer army,
though not driven off, were yet fully absorbed in its struggle with Sir Redvers Bullet and
had drawn to its assistance some portion of the force investing Ladysmith, it might be possible
for Sir George White to make a sortie and to break through the investing lines. To that case,
however, the term "the relief of Ladysmith" could hardly be correctly applied.

How far Sir George White can co-operate with Sir Redvers Buller depends partly upon the mobility
of his force. His horses after three months in Ladysmith can hardly be in much condition, even
supposing that they have not already begun to be used as food for the troops. Supposing there
are horses enough for the field guns, and that the naval guns and mountain guns were destroyed
at the last moment before the sortie. The men and the field artillery would then have to make
a night attack, followed by a march of about seven miles in trying conditions, and by a second
attack in which they would join hands with Sir Redvers Buller. This does not imply exertions
impossible to troops like Sir George White's, and such a move perhaps offers the best way out
of the difficulties of the situation. If in that case Sir George White made for the north side
of Dorn Kop a part of the Boer army would probably be destroyed, and the loss which the British
force would have suffered would thus to some extent be made up for. It is presumed that Sir
Redvers Buller and Sir George White, who are able to communicate with one another, have a cipher
which enables them to inform each other without informing the enemy.

Any plan which will unite Sir George White's force, or the bulk of it, with that of Sir Redvers
Buller on the Tugela will simplify the whole problem of the War. Lord Roberts is preparing
for an advance in force from the Orange River, which will sooner or later transfer the centre
of gravity to the western theatre of War, in which the British troops will not be confronted
by the difficulties of an unknown or very imperfectly known mountainous region. The movements
now taking place in the Cape Colony are the preliminaries to that advance. The method, the
only right method, is to use the reinforcements that have arrived--the sixth and seventh divisions--to
secure a preponderance first at one point and then at another, instead of distributing them
evenly over the whole area and the various points of contact. The idea would seem to be, first,
to strengthen General French until he has crushed the Boer force with which he is dealing,
then to use his troops to secure the defeat of the Boers who are opposing Sir William Gatacre,
and then to cross the Orange River with three divisions and deal a blow against the Boer army
that is now between the Riet River and Kimberley. This plan of beating in detail the Boer forces
in the western theatre of war, if carried out so as to lead in each case to a crushing defeat
of the Boers, would be the prelude to a collision between the main Boer army and a British
force its superior in every respect. The first certain evidence that some such idea is at the
foundation of the new operations may be hailed as the beginning of victory. For the present
it is enough to know that the departure of Lord Roberts from Cape Town augurs the opening of
an energetic campaign with that unity of direction in a strong hand which is the first element
of success in war.

A COMMANDER

February 15th, 1900

In war, as in other great enterprises, the first element of success is unity of direction in
a strong hand. The reason is that whenever the co-operation of large numbers is involved the
needful concentration of purpose can be supplied only by the head man, the leader or director.
Concentration of purpose means in war the arrangement in due perspective of all the various
objectives, the selection of the most important of them, the distribution of forces according
to the importance of the blows to be delivered, of which some one is always decisive. To the
decisive point, then, the bulk of the forces are directed, and at other points small forces
are left to make shift as well as they can, unless, indeed, there is a superabundance of force--not
a common phenomenon.

The same principle of concentration prescribes that action when once begun should, at any rate
at the decisive point, be sudden, rapid, and continuous. These fundamental ideas are illustrated
by the practice of all the great commanders, and there is perhaps no better definition of a
great commander than one whose action illustrates the simple principles of war. Lord Roberts
is once more revealing to his countrymen the nature of these principles. The tangled mass of
the war has suddenly become simplified, and there is clearness where there was confusion.

The Commander-in-Chief reached Cape Town on January 10th, and found large forces dispersed
over a front of two or three hundred miles, the reinforcements at sea, and the transport still
in a state very like confusion. By February 6th, two or three weeks earlier than was anticipated
by those at home who had the most perfect confidence in him, he was on his way to the front,
enabling those at home to draw the certain inference that all was ready, the divisions assembled,
and the transport in order. While he was travelling the six hundred miles from Cape Town to
the Modder River various preliminary moves which he had ordered were in course of execution.
There had been a large display of British infantry near Colesberg, covering the withdrawal
of General French and the cavalry division. This had the effect of causing the Boers to reinforce
Colesberg, probably by detachments from Magersfontein. The British infantry, however, was there
only to lure the Boers; it was composed of parts of the sixth division on the way further north,
and only a small infantry force was left to hold the reinforced Boers in check. The next move
was a reconnaissance in force from Modder River to Koodoosberg Drifts, which drew Commandant
Cronje's attention and some of his troops to his right flank. The reconnaissance had the further
object of inspiriting the Highland Brigade which had been so badly damaged at Magersfontein,
and of establishing good relations between these troops and their new commander, General Mac
Donald. On their return to camp a short address from Lord Roberts had the effect upon them
that Napoleon's proclamations used to produce on the French troops. A day or two was spent
in completing the organisation of the force at Modder River, where a new division, the ninth,
had been formed probably of troops brought up from the communications. The mounted infantry
were also brigaded, as had been those at Orange River Station. Meantime various movements had
been going on of which the details as yet are unreported. Two infantry divisions, the sixth
and seventh, the last two from England, were moving towards the Riet River to the East of Jacobsdal.
The point or points from which they started are not known, nor the direction of their march,
which was screened by the cavalry division and perhaps also by a brigade of mounted infantry.
At any rate on Sunday, the 11th inst., Hannay's brigade of mounted infantry from Orange River,
on the march to Ramdam, had to cover its right flank against a party of Boers. Ramdam is not
to be found, but if it is on the Riet above Jacobsdal the probability is that Hannay's brigade
was covering the right flank of the infantry divisions.

On Monday French with his cavalry brigade seized a drift or ford across the Riet ten or a dozen
miles above Jacobsdal, and the two infantry divisions were so close behind him that on Tuesday
Lord Roberts could report them both encamped beyond the river. On Tuesday French was off again
to the north with a cavalry brigade, a mounted infantry brigade, and a horse artillery brigade,
a second cavalry brigade, under Colonel Gordon moving on his right. By half-past five French
was across the Modder River, having forced a drift and seized the hills beyond so as to secure
the passage for the infantry, while Gordon had seized two drifts further to the west. Between
them the two cavalry commanders had captured five Boer laagers, and the slightness of the opposition
they encounter proves that the Boers were completely surprised. On Wednesday morning the sixth
division was on the march to follow the cavalry, and the seventh division was to take the same
direction on Wednesday afternoon.

These are all the facts reported until now, Thursday afternoon. Let us see what they mean.
First of all, Lord Roberts has chosen his objective, the Boer force before Kimberley, on the
right flank of the Boer front Stormberg--Colesberg--Magersfontein. A blow delivered here and
followed by a march into the Free State places Lord Roberts on the communications of the Boers
now at Stormberg and Colesberg and between the two halves of the Boer army, of which one is
on the border of Cape Colony and the other in Natal. The objective, therefore, has been chosen
with strategical insight. In the next place forces have been concentrated for the blow. Lord
Roberts has four infantry divisions, a cavalry brigade, and at least one brigade of mounted
infantry, his total strength amounting to at least fifty thousand men. Then there has been
a skilful and successful attempt to distract the enemy's attention, to conceal from him the
nature of the movement and the force to be employed, and last, but not least, there has been
the suddenness and the rapidity of movement essential to surprise. These are the proofs of
that breadth and simplicity of conception and of that mastery in execution which are the marks
of the best generalship.

But there is in the best work more than breadth of mind and strength of hand. The details fit
in with the design and repay the closest scrutiny. The march of twenty-five thousand men round
Jacobsdal towards the Modder tactically turns the Boer position at Magersfontein, so that it
need not be carried by a frontal attack. But it also places the British force on the direct
line of the Boer communications with Bloemfontein, and if Commandant Cronje values these communications
he must either make a precipitate retreat by Boshof, offering his flank during the process
to attack by French, or must attack the sixth and seventh divisions on their march from the
Riet to the Modder. But in either case he has to reckon with the Guards and ninth divisions
which are not mentioned in the telegrams, but which are assuredly not idle. Lord Methuen has
long held a crossing on to the peninsula or Doab between the two rivers, and the advance of
a division into this peninsula must compel the prompt evacuation of Jacobsdal or bring about
the ruin of any Boer force there, while at the same time it would increase the weight of troops
that intervene between Magersfontein and Bloemfontein. A single division is a more than ample
force to cover the British railhead at Modder River. Commandant Cronje may elect to fight where
he is, which would be to court disaster, for he would be attacked from the east in great force,
with no retreat open except to the west away from his base, and with a considerable river,
the Vaal, to cross. Such a retreat after a lost battle and under the pressure of pursuit would
be ruin to his army. He may move off by Boshof, but that would be impracticable unless the
start were made soon after the first news of the British advance. On Wednesday he would have
only the mounted troops to deal with; even on Thursday (to-day) the sixth division could hardly
be used with effect on the north bank of the Modder, but on Friday he would have the sixth
and seventh divisions to reckon with. Probably his best course would be to retire before he
can be attacked to Barkly, on the right bank of the Vaal. In any case, the real property of the
Church belonged to it, without prejudice to anybody, through the strongest legal and most
legitimate of property titles, the last will and testament of thousands
of the dead, its founders and benefactors. His decision has been
taken before now, or this opinion would have been suppressed out of deference to the anxiety
of those who imagine that strategical advice is telegraphed from London to the Boer headquarters.
