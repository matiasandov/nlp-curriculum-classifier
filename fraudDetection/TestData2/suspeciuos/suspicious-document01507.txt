This year the campaign took place not in August but in July. By the middle of June it was known
that Abercromby was coming. Even then Montcalm and his regulars were ready, but nothing else
was. Every one knew that Ticonderoga was the key to the south of Canada; yet the fort was not
ready, though the Canadian engineers had been tinkering at it for two whole summers. These
engineers were, in fact, friends of Bigot, and had found that they could make money by spinning
the work out as long as possible, charging for good material and putting in bad, and letting
the gang plunder the stores on the way to the fort. Montcalm had arranged everything in 1756,
and there was no good reason why Ticonderoga should not have been in perfect order in 1758,
when the fate of Canada was hanging on its strength. But it was not. It had not even been rightly
planned. The engineers were fools as well as knaves. When the proper French army engineers
arrived, having been sent out at the last moment, they were horrified at the mess that had
been made of the work. But it was too late then. Montcalm and Abercromby were both advancing;
and Montcalm would have to make up with the lives of his men for all that the knaves and fools
had done against him.

Bad as this was, there was a still worse trouble. Vaudreuil now thought he saw a chance for
another raid which would please the Canadians and hurt Montcalm. So he actually took away 1,600
men in June and sent them off to the Mohawk valley, farther west, under Levis, who ought to
have known better than to have allowed himself to be flattered into taking command. This came
near to wrecking the whole defence. But the owls did not see, and the foxes did not care.

Meanwhile, Montcalm was hurrying his little handful of regulars to the front. He was to leave
on June 24. On the night of the 23rd Vaudreuil sent a long string of foolish orders, worded
in such a way by some of his foxy parasites that the credit for any victory would come to himself,
while the blame for any failure would rest on Montcalm. This was more than flesh and blood
could endure. Once before Montcalm had tried to open Vaudreuil's eyes to the mischief that
was going on. He was in an agony of remorse and doubt. It kept him sober longer than he had
been for five years, for he was a professed drunkard and idler, scarcely considered responsible.
He could not be sure that he had experienced aught which he seemed to remember--he hoped it
was all only his drunken fancy, for what could have been the fate
of the child subject to the freaks of his imbecile folly!

He was reassured to hear no rumors of a lost child, and yet so definite were the images of his recollection
that they must needs constrain his credulity.

He felt it in the nature of a rescue one day when, as he chanced to join a group of gossips loitering
around the fire of the forge, he heard the smith ask casually: "Who is that thar baby visitin'
at Peter Petrie 's over yander acrost Storm Mounting?" His 3,000 harassed regulars were working almost night and day. The fort was patched
up until nothing more could be done without pulling it down and building a new fort; and an
entrenched camp was dug in front of it. Meanwhile Montcalm's little army, though engaged in
all this work, was actually making such a show of force about the valley between the lakes
that it checked the British, who now gave up their plan of seizing a forward position in the
valley as a cover for the advance of the main body later on. Montcalm, with 3,000 toil-worn
soldiers, had out-generalled Abercromby and Howe with 15,000 fresh ones. He had also gained
four priceless days.

But on July 5 the British advanced in force. It had been a great sight the year before, when
Montcalm had gone south along Lake George with 5,000 men; but how much more magnificent now,
when Abercromby came north with 15,00 men, all eager for this Armageddon of the West. Perhaps
there never has been any other occasion on which the pride and pomp of glorious war have been
set in a scene of such wonderful peace and beauty. The midsummer day was perfectly calm. Not
a cloud was in the sky. The lovely lake shone like a burnished mirror. The forest-clad mountains
never looked greener or cooler; nor did their few bare crags or pinnacles ever stand out more
clearly against the endless blue sky than when those thousand boats rowed on to what 15,000
men thought certain victory. The procession of boats was wide enough to stretch from shore
to shore; yet it was much longer than its width. On each side went the Americans, 9,000 men
in blue and buff. In the centre came 6,000 British regulars in scarlet and gold, among them
a thousand kilted Highlanders of the splendid 'Black Watch,' led by their major, Duncan Campbell
of Inverawe, whose weird had told him a year before that he should fight and fall at a place
with what was then to him an unknown name--Ticonderoga. The larger boats were in the rear,
lashed together, two by two, with platforms laid across them for artillery.

And so the brave array advanced. The colours fluttered gallantly with the motion of the boats.
The thousands of brilliant scarlet uniforms showed gaily between the masses of more sober blue.
The drums were beating, the bugles blowing, the bagpipes screaming defiance to the foe; and
every echo in the surrounding hills was roused to send its own defiance back.

The British halted for the night a few miles short of the north end of the lake. Next morning;
the 6th, they set out again in time to land about noon within four miles of Ticonderoga in
a straight line. There were two routes by which an army could march from Lake George to Lake
Champlain. The first, the short way, was to go eastward across the four-mile valley. The second
was twice as far, north and then east, all the way round through the woods. Since the valley
road led to a bridge which Montcalm had blown up, Lord Howe went round through the woods with
a party of rangers to see if that way would do. While he was pushing ahead the French reconnoitring
party, which, from under cover, had been following the British movements the day before, was
trying to find its own way back to Montcalm through the same woods. Its Indian guides had run
away in the night, scared out of their wits by the size of the British army. It was soon lost
and, circling round, came between Howe and Abercromby. Suddenly the rangers and the French
met in the dense forest. 'Who goes there?' shouted a Frenchman. 'Friends!' answered a British
soldier in perfect French. But the uniforms told another tale and both sides fired. The French
were soon overpowered by numbers, and the fifty or so survivors were glad to scurry off into
the bush. But they had dealt one mortal blow. Lord Howe had fallen, and, with him, the head
and heart of the whole British force.

Abercromby, a helpless leader, pottered about all the next day, not knowing what to do. Meanwhile
Montcalm kept his men hard at work, and by night he was ready and hopeful. He had just written
to his friend Doreil, the commissary of war at Quebec: 'We have only eight days' provisions.
I have no Canadians and no Indians. The British have a very strong army. But I do not despair.
My soldiers are good. From the movements of the British I can see they are in doubt. If they
are slow enough to let me entrench the heights of Ticonderoga, I shall beat them.' He had ended
his dispatch to Vaudreuil with similar words: 'If they only let me entrench the heights I shall
beat them.' And now, on the night of the 7th, he actually was holding the heights with his
3,000 French regulars against the total British force of 15,000. Could he win on the 8th?
