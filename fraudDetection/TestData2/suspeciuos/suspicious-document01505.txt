In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the American colonies, from Massachusetts to South
Carolina, were at intervals subject to visitations of pirates, who were wont to appear suddenly
upon the coasts, to pillage a settlement or attack trading vessels and as suddenly to take
flight to their strongholds. Captain Kidd was long celebrated in prose and verse, and only
within a few years have credulous people ceased to seek his buried treasures. The arch-villain,
Blackbeard, was a terror to Virginians and Carolinians until Spotswood, of "Horseshoe" fame,
took the matter in hand, and sent after him lieutenant Maynard, who, slaying the pirate in
hand to hand conflict, returned with his head at the bowsprit.[1] Lapse of time has cast a
romantic and semi-mythologic glamor around these depredators, and it is in many instances at
this day extremely difficult to distinguish fact from fiction. The unprotected situation of
many settlements along the seaboard colonies rendered them an easy prey to rapacious sea rovers,
but it might have been expected that the Maryland shores of the Chesapeake bay would be free
from their harassings. The province, however, it seems was not to enjoy such good fortune,
for in the printed annals of her life appears the name of one man, who has been handed down
from generation to generation as a "pirate," a "rebel" and an "ungrateful villain," and other
equally complimentary epithets have been applied to him. The original historians of Maryland
based their ideas about him upon some of the statements made by those whom he had injured or
attacked, and who differed from him in political creed. The later history writers have been
satisfied to follow such authors as Bozman, McMahon and McSherry, or to copy them directly,
without consulting original records. To the general reader, therefore, who relies upon these
authorities, Richard Ingle is "a pirate and rebel" still.[2]

A thorough defence of him would be almost impossible in view of the comparative scarcity of
records and the complicated politics of his time. In a review of his relations with Maryland,
however, and by a presentation of all the facts, some light may be thrown upon his general
character, and explanations, if not a defence, of his acts may be made.

Richard Ingle's name first appears in the records of Maryland under date of March 23rd, 1641/2,
when he petitioned the Assembly against Giles Brent touching the serving of an execution by
the sheriff. He had come to the province a few weeks before, bringing in his vessel Captain
Thomas Cornwallis, one of the original council, the greatest man in Maryland at that time,
who had been spending some months in England.[3] Between the time of his arrival and the date
of his petition Ingle had no doubt been plying his business, tobacco trading, in the inlets
and rivers of the province. No further record of him in Maryland this year has been preserved,
but Winthrop wrote that on May 3rd, 1642, "The ship Eleanor of London one Mr. || Inglee ||
master arrived at Boston she was laden with tobacco from Virginia, and having been about 14
days at sea she was taken with such a tempest, that though all her sails were down and made
up, yet they were blown from the yards and she was laid over on one side two and a half hours,
so low as the water stood upon her deck and the sea over-raking her continually and the day
was as dark as if it had been night, and though they had cut her masts, yet she righted not
till the tempest assuaged. She staid here till the 4th of the (4) and was well fitted with
masts, sails, rigging and victuals at such reasonable rates as that the master was much affected
with his entertainment and professed that he never found the like usage in Virginia where he
had traded these ten years."[4] Although his name is given an additional e and there are some
few seeming discrepancies, the facts taken together point to the probability of his being Richard
Ingle on his return voyage to England. Next year he was again in Maryland, and, as attorney
for Mr. Penniston and partners, sued widow Cockshott for debts incurred by her husband. The
next entry in the "Provincial Records" under this date, March 6th, 1642/3, is an attachment
against William Hardige in case of Captain Cornwallis.[5] This William Hardige, who was afterward
one of Ingle's chief accusers, was very frequently involved in suits for debts to Cornwallis,
and others. About the middle of the month of January, 1643/4, the boatswain of the "Reformation"
brought against Hardige a suit for tobacco, returnable February 1st. Three days afterward a
warrant was issued to William Hardige, a tailor, for the arrest of Ingle for high treason,
and Captain Cornwallis was bidden to aid Hardige, and the matter was to be kept secret.[6]
Ingle was arrested and given into the custody of Edward Parker, the sheriff, by the lieutenant
general of the province, Giles Brent, who also seized Ingle's goods and ship, until he should
clear himself, and placed on board, under John Hampton, a guard ordered to allow no one to
come on the ship without a warrant from the lieutenant general.[7] Then was published, and
as the records seem to show, fixed on the vessel's mainmast the following proclamation.[8]

"These are to publish & pclaym to all psons as well seamen as others, that Richard Ingle, m^r
of his ship, is arrested upon highe treason to his Ma^ty; & therefore to require all psons
to be aiding & assisting to his Lo^ps officers in the seizing of his ship, & not to offer any
resistance or contempt hereunto, nor be any otherwaise aiding or assisting to the said Richard
Ingle upon perl of highe treason to his Ma^ty."

Notwithstanding this proclamation Ingle escaped in the following manner. Parker had no prison,
and, consequently, had to keep personal guard over his prisoner. He supposed, "from certain
words spoken by the Secretary," that Brent and the council had agreed to let Ingle go on board
his vessel, and when Captain Cornwallis and Mr. Neale came from the council meeting and carried
Ingle to the ship, he accompanied them.[9] Arrived on board Cornwallis said "All is peace,"
and persuaded the commanding officer to bid his men lay down their arms and disperse, and then
Ingle and his crew regained possession of the ship. Under such circumstances the sheriff could
not prevent his escape, especially when a member of the council and the most influential men
in the province had assisted the deed by their acts or presence. Besides it was afterwards
said that William Durford, John Durford, and Fred. Johnson, at the instigation of Ingle, beat
and wounded some of the guard, though this charge does not appear to have been substantiated.[10]

On January 20th, 1643/4, the following warrant was issued to the sheriff.[11]

    "I doe hereby require (in his Ma^ties name) Richard
    Ingle, mariner to yield his body to Rob Ellyson, Sheriff
    of this County, before the first of ffebr next, to
    answer to such crimes of treason, as on his Ma^ties
    behalfe shalbe obiected ag^st him, upon his utmost perl,
    of the Law in that behalfe. And I doe further require
    all psons that can say or disclose any matter of treason
    ag^st the said Richard Ingle to informe his Lo^ps
    Attorny of it some time before the said Court to the end
    it may be then & there prosequuted

        G. BRENT."

Ingle, however, was not again arrested, though he still remained in the neighborhood of St.
Mary's, for on January 30th his vessel was riding at anchor in St. George's river, and mention
is made of him in the records as being in the province. For nearly two months the Ingle question
was agitated and for the sake of clearness an account will be given of the acts concerning
him in the order of their occurrence.

The information given by Hardige to Lewger which had caused Ingle's arrest was: that in March
or April, 1642, he heard Ingle, who was then at Kent Island, and at other times in St. Mary's,
say, that he was "Captain of Gravesend for the Parliament against the King;" that he heard
Ingle say that in February of that year he had been bidden in the King's name to come ashore
at Accomac, in Virginia, but he, in the parliament's name had refused to do so, and had threatened
to cut off the head of any one who should come on his ship.[12] On January 29th, Hardige and
others were summoned to appear and to give evidence of--here the pirate enters--"pyratical
& treasonable offences" of Ingle. On February 1st, the sheriff impannelled a jury of which
Robert Vaughan was chosen foreman, and witnesses were sworn, among them Hardige who "being
excepted at as infamous," by Capt. Cornwallis, "was not found so."[13] John Lewger, the attorney-general,
having stated that the Court had power to take cognizance of treason out of the province in
order to determine where the offender should be tried, presented three bills for the jury to
consider. The first bill included the second charge brought by Hardige, the second ordered
the jury to inquire "if on the 20th of November and some daies afore & since in the 17 yea
of his Ma^ties reigne at Gravesend in Comit Kent in England" the accused "not having the feare
of God before his eies, but instigated thereunto by the instigation of the divill & example
of other traitors of his Ma^tie traiterously & as an enemy did levie war & beare armes ag^st
his ma^tie and accept & exercise the comand & captainship of the town of Gravesend," and by
the third bill they were to inquire if Ingle did not, on April 5th in the eighteenth year of
Charles' reign, on his vessel in the Potomac river, near St. Clement's island, say, "that Prince
Rupert was a rogue or rascall." If the rest of the testimony was no stronger or more conclusive
than that of Hardige, it is not surprising that the jury replied to all the bills "Ignoramus."[14]
Another jury was impannelled to investigate the charge of Ingle's having broken from the sheriff,
and they returned a like finding. In the afternoon the first jury were given two more bills,
first, to find "whether in April 1643 Ingle, being then at Mattapanian,[15] St. Clement's hundred,
said 'that Prince Rupert was Prince Traitor & Prince rogue and if he had him aboard his ship
he would whip him at the capstan.'" This bill met the fate of the others, but the second charging
him with saying "that the king (meaning o^r Gover L. K. Charles) was no king neither would
be no king, nor could be no king unless he did ioine with the Parlam^t," caused the jury to
disagree and no verdict having been reached at 7 P. M., they adjourned until the following
Saturday.[16] On that day, February 3rd, at the request of the attorney-general the jury were
discharged and the bill given to another jury who returned it "Ignoramus."[17] In spite of
the unanimity of all the juries in finding no true indictment, another warrant was issued for
the arrest, by Parker or Ellyson, of Ingle for high treason, and after a fruitless attempt
to secure by another jury a different finding, Ingle was impeached on February 8th, for having
on January 20th, 1643/4, committed assaults upon the vessels, guns, goods, and person of one
Bishop, and upon being reproached for these acts, having threatened to beat down the dwellings
of people and even of Giles Brent, and for "the said crimes of pyracie, mutinie, trespasse,
contempt & misdemeanors & every of them severally."[18] If Ingle did commit these depredations
he was, no doubt instigated by the proceedings instituted on that day against him, and moreover
by the fact that Henry Bishop had been among the witnesses to be summoned against him.

Nothing more was done in the matter, for from a copy of a certificate to Ingle under date of
February 8th, it is learned that "Upon certaine complaints exhibited by his Lo^ps attorny ag^st
M^r R. Ingle the attending & psequution whereof was like to cause great demurrage to the ship
& other damages & encumbrances in the gathering of his debts it was demanded by his Lo^ps said
attorny on his Lo^ps behalfe that the said R. I. deposite in the country to his Lo^ps use one
barrell of powder & 400 l of shott to remaine as a pledge that the said R. I. shall by himself
or his attorny appeare at his Lo^ps Co^rt at S. Maries on or afore the first of ffebr next
to answere to all such matters as shalbe then and there obiected ag^st him * * * * and upon
his appearance the said powder & shott or the full value of it at the then rate of the country
to be delivered to him his attorny or assigne upon demand."[19]

What a change of policy, from charging a man with treason, the penalty for which was death,
to offering him the right of bail for the appearance of his attorney, if necessary, to meet
indefinite charges! In view of all the facts, it seems probable that the Maryland authorities
were committed to the King's cause by the commission granted by him to Leonard Calvert in 1643,
and by their action in seizing Ingle; that after his arrest it was thought to be injudicious
to go to extremes, and that they made little resistance to, if they did not connive at, his
escape. Certainly, efforts to recapture him must have been very feeble, for when the sheriff
demanded the tobacco and cask due him from the defendant for summoning juries, witnesses, &c.,
it was found that Ingle had left in the hands of the Secretary the required amount.[20] In
arresting Ingle for uttering treasonable words, the palatine government was not only placing
itself upon the side of King Charles, but was preparing to do what he had been prevented from
doing a few months before. For when at his command some persons who had acted treasonably were
condemned to death, parliament declared that "all such indictments and proceedings thereon
were unjust and illegal; and that if any man was executed or suffered hurt, for any thing he
had done by their order, the like punishment should be inflicted by death or otherwise, upon
such prisoners as were, or should be, taken by their forces," and their lives were saved.[21]
The authorities of Maryland themselves show why Ingle was allowed to escape. On March 16th,
Lewger showed that "whereas Richard Ingle was obnoxious to divers suits & complaints of his
Lo^p for divers and sundry crimes all w^ch upon composition for the publique good & safety
were suspended ag^st the said Richard Ingle assuming to leave in the country to the publique
need at this time," powder and shot, but he had not paid the composition and had left without
paying custom dues, which were required for the proper discharge of his ship "by the law &
custom of all Ports," he prayed that all of Ingle's goods, debts, &c., might be sequestered
until he should clear himself.[22] Under the circumstances, the grave charges pending against
him, as there is no proof that he had known the terms of composition, a crew and vessel being
at his command, it is not surprising that he sailed away from danger, without attending to
the formality of clearing, and leaving unpaid debts, for Lewger claimed 600 pounds of tobacco
from him, as payment for some plate and a scimitar, for which Cornwallis went security.[23]
There is a touch of seeming sarcasm in the suggestion that the deposit by Ingle of ammunition
would have relieved the public need, for he would have been that much less dangerous, and the
government would have been so much the more prepared to resist him.

But how were those who assisted him treated? On January 30th, Thomas Cornwallis, James Neale,
Edward Parker and John Hampton, were impeached for having rescued him, and thereby of being
accessories to high treason. Cornwallis made answer, "that he did well understand the matters
charged ag^st the said Richard Ingle to be of no importance but suggested of mean malice of
the ---- William hardige, as hath appeared since in that the grand enquest found not so much
probability in the accusations, as that it was fitt to putt him to his triall" and "he supposed
& understood no other but that the said rich. Ingle went aboard w^th the licence and consent
of the L. G. & Counsell & of the officer in whose custody he was & as to the escape & rescuous
in manner as is charged he is no way accessory to it & therefore prayeth to be dismissed."[24]
The judgment was delayed, but Cornwallis was anxious to be at once discharged. The lieutenant
general and the attorney general, therefore, having consulted together, found Cornwallis guilty,
and fined him one thousand pounds of tobacco, though at the request of the accused the fine
was respited until the last day of the month, when Brent ordered the sheriff "to levie 1000
lbs tob. on any goods or debts" of Capt. Tho. Cornwallis "for so much adjudged by way of fine
unto the Lord Propriet^r ag^st him at the Court held on the 9^th ffeb last."[25] This fine,
which was to be given to the attorney of Tho. Wyatt, commander of Kent Island, in payment of
Lord Baltimore's debt to him, Cornwallis afterward acknowledged he had paid.[26]

Neale did not make his appearance before the court, though he seems to have been in St. Mary's,
and was suspended from the council for his contempt. On February 11th, being accused of having
begged Ingle from the sheriff, he denied all the charges, and in a few days was restored to
his seat in the council, upon the eve of Brent's departure for Kent Island.[27] Parker said
Ingle had escaped against his will, and he was discharged, while Hampton escaped prosecution,
presumably, for there is no further record of action in the case against him.[28]

But it would have been bad policy for the authorities to allow the matter to drop without apparent
effort on their part to punish somebody, and Cornwallis had to bear the brunt of their attacks.
The feeling against him was so strong, according to his own statements, that besides paying
a fine, the highest "that could by law be laid upon him," he was compelled for personal safety
to take ship with Ingle for England, where the doughty captain testified before a parliamentary
committee of Cornwallis' devotion to its cause, and of the losses he had sustained in its behalf.[29]

The lieutenant governor, and council, may have congratulated themselves about the departure
of Ingle and Cornwallis, but that mariner and trader was preparing to return to Maryland. On
August 26th, 1644, certain persons trading to Virginia petitioned the House of Commons to allow
them to transport ammunition, clothes, and victuals, custom free, to the plantations of the
Chesapeake, which were at that time loosely classed under the one name--Virginia. The Commons
granted to the eight[30] vessels mentioned in the petition, the right of carrying victuals,
clothes, arms, ammunition, and other commodities, "for the supply and Defence and Relief of
the Planters," and referred the latter part of the petition, asking power to interrupt the
Hollanders and other strange traders, to the House of Lords.[31] It is hardly necessary to
say at this point that the planters to be relieved and defended by the cargoes of the vessels,
were planters not at enmity with the parliament. For vessels from London were used in the interests
of parliament, while those from Bristol were the King's ships. De Vries, the celebrated Dutchman,
who has left such acute observations about the early colonists, wrote that while visiting Virginia
in 1644 he saw two London ships chase a fly-boat to capture it, and it was reported in Massachusetts
that a captured Indian had given as a reason for the Indian massacre, on April 18th, 1644,
"that they did it because they saw the English took up all their lands, * * * and they took
this season for that they understood that they were at war in England, and began to go to war
among themselves, for they had seen a fight in the river between a London ship, which was for
the parliament, and a Bristol ship, which was for the King."[32]

Among the ships commissioned by the parliament, which were armed, was the "Reformation," of
which Ingle was still master. He was in London in October, 1644, receiving cargo, and Cornwallis
entrusted to him goods, valued at 200 pounds sterling.[33] The vessel soon afterwards sailed,
and was in Maryland in February. In the province, at that time, affairs were in a very unsettled
condition. The energetic Claiborne, who was also called by Maryland authorities a pirate and
a rebel, but who was a much better man than is generally supposed, and whose life ought to
be especially studied, was still pushing his claims to Kent Island, and Leonard Calvert had
been compelled to visit Virginia more than once during the winter in trying to prevent his
actions. The Indians were aroused and prone to take advantage of disputes between the factions
in the province, while the colonists themselves were in a state of unrest. At this juncture
Ingle appeared. Streeter wrote of his coming, "several vessels appeared in the harbor, from
which an armed force disembarked, (Feb. 14, 1645,) under the command of Capt. Richard Ingle,
St. Mary's was taken; many of the members were prisoners; the Governor was a fugitive in Virginia;
and the Province in the hands of a force, professing to act, and probably acting, under authority
of Parliament."[34] There is no authority given for the first part of this statement, though
it is not improbable, and is partly substantiated by the exaggerated charges against Ingle,
made by the Assembly of 1649, and the references to him in proclamations. There is no mention
in the provincial records of Calvert's having being forced out of the province, but, on the
contrary, Calvert in his commission to Hill in 1646 stated that "at this present, I have occasion,
for his lordship's service to be absent out the said province," and says nothing at all about
Ingle. The rebellion has been called "Claiborne's and Ingle's," and, although association with
Claiborne would not have been dishonorable to any one, historical accuracy seems to call for
a distinction. In Greene's proclamation of pardon given in March, 1647/8; in the letter written
by the Assembly to Lord Baltimore in April, 1649; in the Proprietor's commissions for the great
seal, for muster master general, for commander of Kent Island, respectively, in 1648; and in
his letter to Stone in 1649, the rebellion is attributed to the instigation of Ingle.[35] In
the commission to Governor Stone, of August, 1648, is the statement, "so as such pardon or
pardons extend not to the pardoning of William Clayborne heretofore of the isle of Kent in
our said province of Maryland and now or late of Virginia or of his complices in their late
rebellion against our rights and dominion in and over the said province nor of Richard Ingle
nor John Durford mariner," and in the act of Oblivion, in April, 1650, pardon is granted to
all excepting "Richard Ingle and John Darford Marryners, and such others of the Isle of Kent"
as were not pardoned by Leonard Calvert.[36] In these two instances alone is any kind of an
opportunity offered for connecting the two names, even here they are separated, and the distinction
is made greater by the fact that in a commission concerning Hill, also of August, 1648, and
in other places, Claiborne is mentioned with no reference at all to Ingle.[37] It is probable,
in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that Ingle and Claiborne never planned any concerted
action, but that each took advantage of the other's deeds, to further his own interests.

To return to the year 1645. The rebellion supposed to have been originated by Ingle, was according
to statements of the Assembly of 1649, continued by his accomplices, and during it "most of
your Lordships Royal friends here were spoiled of their whole Estate and sent away as banished
persons out of the Province those few that remained were plundered and deprived in a manner
of all Livelyhood and subsistance only Breathing under that intollerable Yoke which they were
forced to bear under those Rebells."[38] The people were tendered an oath against Lord Baltimore,
which all the Roman Catholics refused to take, except William Thompson, about whom there is
some doubt.[39] Ingle, himself, said that he had been able to take some places from the papists
and malignants, and with goods taken from them had relieved the well-affected to parliament.
Further on in this paper it will be seen that Roman Catholics' property was attacked under
Ingle's auspices, but that the bad treatment of them did not continue long and was not very
severe, may be inferred from the fact that in 1646, there were enough members of the council,
who were Roman Catholics, in the province to elect Hill governor. In this connection ought
to be mentioned the report, by an uncertain author, concerning the Maryland mission, written
in 1670. The report is devoted principally to an account of a miracle which, strange to say,
had not been recorded, as far as is known, although twenty-four years had elapsed since it
had occurred. "It has been established by custom and usage of the Catholics," the uncertain
author wrote, "who live in Maryland, during the whole night of the 31st of July following the
festival of St. Ignatius, to honor with a salute of cannon their tutelar guardian and patron
saint. Therefore, in the year 1646, mindful of the solemn custom, the anniversary of the holy
father being ended, they wished the night also consecrated to the honor of the same, by the
continual discharge of artillery. At the time, there were in the neighborhood certain soldiers,
unjust plunderers, Englishmen indeed by birth, of the heterodox faith, who, coming the year
before with a fleet, had invaded with arms, almost the entire colony, had plundered, burnt,
and finally, having abducted the priests and driven the Governor himself into exile, had reduced
it to a miserable servitude. These had protection in a certain fortified citadel, built for
their own defence, situated about five miles from the others; but now, aroused by the nocturnal
report of the cannon, the day after, that is on the first of August, rush upon us with arms,
break into the houses of the Catholics, and plunder whatever there is of arms or powder."[40]
Now this statement bears upon the face of it a contradiction, for the restriction upon the
Roman Catholics could not have been very great, since they were allowed to retain, up to August,
1646, the powder and cannon necessary to fire continual salutes, moreover, when next day the
soldiers came to their dwellings, nothing seems to have been taken except the ammunition, and
this was done no doubt to prevent any further alarm, that a body of troops situated as they
were might reasonably have felt at hearing artillery discharges five miles away.

Many writers have stated that good Fathers White and Fisher were carried off to England by
Ingle, but from the records of the Jesuits at Stonyhurst, it is learned that Father White was
seized "by a band of soldiers," "and carried to England in chains," and also that in "1645
This year the colony was attacked by a party of 'rowdies' or marauders and the missioners were
carried off to Virginia."[41] These extracts serve to show what was the confusion existing
in the minds of contemporaries of Ingle, and the extreme difficulty, therefore, of finding
the real truth. But in the sworn statements preserved in the Maryland records, some facts may
be found. Within a few days of the events at St. Mary's resulting in partial subversion of
Baltimore's government, the "Reformation" was riding at the mouth of St. Inigoes' creek, near
which was situated the "Cross," the manor house of Cornwallis, who, when he had been obliged
in 1644 to leave Maryland, had left his house and property in the hands of Cuthbert Fenwick,
his attorney.[42] Fenwick was intending to go to Accomac, Virginia, and sent Thomas Harrison,
a servant, who had been bought from Ingle by Cornwallis, and a fellow servant, Edw. Matthews,
to help Andrew Monroe to bring a small pinnace nearer the house.[43] In the pinnace were clothes,
bedding, and other goods, the property of Fenwick. Monroe refused to bring the pinnace, and
waited until Ingle came into the creek;[44] and allowed the pinnace to be captured, (if that
may be called a capture to which consent was given,) and plundered. Fenwick said that the pinnace
was plundered by "Richard Ingle or his associates;"[45] another witness said that Ingle "seized
or plundered" the pinnace, and Monroe was employed by him in his acts against the province,
and while in command of another pinnace assisted in the pillaging of Copley's house at Portoback.[46]
Matthews as well as other servants were held captives on the "Reformation," and Harrison took
up arms for Ingle and afterwards left the province and fled to Accomac. Fenwick went on board,
no doubt to protest against such acts, and when he returned to the shore was seized by a party
of men under John Sturman, who seems to have been a leader in the rebellion, and carried back
to the vessel where he was kept prisoner.[47] In the meantime Thomas Sturman, John Sturman,
coopers, and William Hardwick, a tailor, led a party to sack the dwelling of Cornwallis, who,
in a petition to the Governor and Council in 1652, described it as "a Competent Dwelling house,
furnished with plate, Linnen hangings, beding brass pewter and all manner of Household Stuff
worth at least a thousand pounds." In the same petition he said that the party "plundered and
Carryed away all things in It, pulled downe and burnt the pales about it, killed and destroyed
all the Swine and Goates and killed or mismarked allmost all the Cattle, tooke or dispersed
all the Servants, Carryed away a Great quantity of Sawn Boards from the pitts, and ript up
Some floors of the house. And having by these Violent and unlawfull Courses forst away my Said
Attorny the Said Thomas and John Sturman possest themselves of the Complts house as theire
owne, dwelt in it Soe long as they please and at their departing tooke the locks from the doors
and y^e Glass from the windowes and in fine ruined his whole Estate to the damage of the Complt
at least two or three thousand pounds."[48] It may be well to bear in mind that Cornwallis
in this petition, which was against the two Sturmans and Hardwick, who did not deny the allegations,
but claimed the statute of limitation, no mention is made of Ingle, save that on his ship Fenwick
was detained.[49]

In the latter part of the year 1645 began the era of petitions, which should be taken with
allowance, for the age has been characterized as one of perjury, and in the representations
by both parties in Maryland politics, advantage was taken of every slight point to strengthen
their respective positions, and from internal evidence it seems that some statements were garbled,
to say the least about them. The opening of this era was marked by the presentation, December
25th, 1645, by the committee of plantations, to the House of Lords, the following statements
and suggestions, viz: that many had complained of the tyranny of recusants in Maryland, "who
have seduced and forced many of his Majesty's subjects from their religion;" that by a certificate
from the Judge of the Admiralty grounded upon the deposition of witnesses taken in that Court:
Leonard Calvert, late Governor there, had a commission from Oxford to seize such persons, ships
and goods as belonged to any of London; which he registered, proclaimed, and endeavored to
put in execution at Virginia; and that one Brent, his deputy Governor, had seized upon a ship,
empowered under a commission derived from the Parliament, because she was of London, and afterward
not only tampered with the crew thereof to carry her to Bristol, then in hostility against
the Parliament, but also tendered them an oath against the Parliament; the committee under
these circumstances recommended that the province should be settled in the hands of protestants.[50]
This was the first part of the determined effort to deprive the great Cecil Calvert of his
charter of Maryland, which Richard Ingle continued so vigorously in after years. He was probably
in England at that time, for he refers to the action of the Lords in regard to the settling
of the Maryland government, in his petition of February 24th, 1645/6, to the House of Lords.
To this petition was appended a statement on behalf of Cornwallis, which will explain it. Cornwallis
said that on Ingle's return to England, to cover up his defalcation in the matter of 200 pounds
worth of goods, he had complained to the committee for examinations against Cornwallis as an
enemy to the State. The matter was given a full hearing, and when it was left to the law and
the defendant was granted the right of having witnesses in Maryland examined, Ingle had him
arrested upon two feigned actions to the value of 15,000 pounds sterling. Some friends succeeded
in rescuing him from prison, and then Ingle sent the following petition to the House of Lords,
which had the effect of stopping for the time proceedings against him.[51] Having done so he
carried the prosecution no further. The petition is somewhat lengthy, but it should be read
as it is eminently characteristic of the man.[52]

"The humble petition of Richard Ingle, showing That whereas the petitioner, having taken the
covenant, and going out with letters of marque, as Captain of the ship Reformation, of London,
and sailing to Maryland, where, finding the Governor of that Province to have received a commission
from Oxford to seize upon all ships belonging to London, and to execute a tyrannical power
against the Protestants, and such as adhered to the Parliament, and to press wicked oaths upon
them, and to endeavor their extirpation, the petitioner, conceiving himself, not only by his
warrant, but in his fidelity to the Parliament, to be conscientiously obliged to come to their
assistance, did venture his life and fortune in landing his men and assisting the said well
affected Protestants against the said tyrannical government and the Papists and malignants.
It pleased God to enable him to take divers places from them, and to make him a support to
the said well affected. But since his return to England, the said Papists and malignants, conspiring
together, have brought fictitious acts against him, at the common law, in the name of Thomas
Cornwallis and others for pretended trespass, in taking away their goods, in the parish of
St. Christopher's, London, which are the very goods that were by force of war justly and lawfully
taken from these wicked Papists and malignants in Maryland, and with which he relieved the
poor distressed Protestants there, who otherwise must have starved, and been rooted out.

"Now, forasmuch as your Lordships in Parliament of State, by the order annexed, were pleased
to direct an ordinance to be framed for the settlement of the said province of Maryland, under
the Committee of Plantations, and for the indemnity of the actors in it, and for that such
false and feigned actions for matters of war acted in foreign parts, are not tryable at common
law, but, if at all, before the Court and Marshall; and for that it would be a dangerous example
to permit Papists and malignants to bring actions of trespass or otherwise against the well
affected for fighting for the Parliament.

"The petitioner most humbly beseecheth your Lordships to be pleased to direct that this business
may be heard before your Lordships at the bar, or to refer it to a committee to report the
true state of the case and to order that the said suits against the petitioner at the common
law may be staid, and no further proceeded in."

It is not known how this matter was settled, but in 1647, September 8th, Ingle transferred
to Cornwallis "for divers good and valuable causes" the debts, bills, &c., belonging to him,
and made him his attorney to collect the same. Among the items in the inventory appended to
the power of attorney were "A Bill and note of John Sturman's, the one dated the 10th of April
1645 for Satisfaction of tenn pounds of powder the other dated the 4th of April 1645 for 900
l of Tob & Caske," and "an acknowledgem^t of Cap^t William Stone dated the 10th of April 1645
for a receipt of a Bill of Argall Yardley's Esq, for 9860 l of Tobacco and Caske,"[53] which
show that the mercantile interests of Ingle were not subservient to his supposed warlike measures.
A consideration of the statements by Cornwallis and of those by Ingle, proves that the latter
must have had considerable influence in the Parliament, and that he was prepared to stand by
and defend all his actions, and the similarity to his petition of ideas and even of words in
certain places, would safely allow the conjecture that Ingle had something to do in the report
of 1645 already mentioned. It is curious also to compare his reference to the ill-treatment
of the Protestants, and the mention of the hardships of Baltimore's adherents, made by the
Assembly of 1649. There is no record of the presence of Ingle in Maryland after the spring
of 1645, though the rebellion which he was accused of instigating continued some months longer.[54]
For continuity, a rapid sketch of the history of Maryland during the next two years must be given.

For fourteen months the province was without a settled government. In March, 1645/6, the Virginian
Assembly in view of the secret flight into Maryland of Lieutenant Stillwell, and others, enacted
that "Capt. Tho. Willoughby, Esq., and Capt. Edward Hill be hereby authorized to go to Maryland
or Kent to demand the return of such persons who are alreadie departed from the colony. And
to follow such further instructions as shall be given them by the Governor and Council."[55]
After Hill had arrived in Maryland he was elected governor by the members of the council, who,
notwithstanding Ingle's rebellion, were in the province. The right of the council to elect
Hill was afterwards disputed, but one word must be said in regard to this. The reason for disputing
the right was that the councilors could elect only a member of the council to be governor.
In the commission to Leonard Calvert in 1637, no such restriction was made,[56] in the commission
of 1642 the restriction occurs, and in the commission of 1644, which has been preserved in
two copies, the same provision was made.[57] As Lord Baltimore himself had confused ideas about
this commission, it is not surprising that the council thought they were doing right in electing
Hill. Even if the council had no right to act thus, Hill had stronger claims to the governorship.
In Lord Baltimore's commission to Leonard Calvert, of September 18th, 1644, is the provision:[58]
"and lastly whereas our said Lieutenant may happen to dye or be absent from time to time out
of the said province of Maryland, before we can have notice to depute another in his place
we do therefore hereby grant unto him full power and Authority from time to time in such Cases
to Nominate elect and appoint such an able person inhabiting and residing within our said province
of Maryl^d, as he in his discretion shall make choice of & think fit to be our Lieutenant Governor,
&c." Such is the command as recorded in the Council Proceedings of Maryland. But Baltimore,
in 1648, in a commission to the Governor and council in Maryland, wrote that Leonard Calvert
had no right to appoint any person in his stead "unless such persons were of our privy council
there,"[59] although he recognized the validity of Leonard's death-bed appointment by witnesses
of Governor Greene. He, to be sure, was a member of the council, but this fact was not mentioned
in the preamble of the commission, in which the words, with some slight changes in tense and
mood, are almost identical with those in the preamble of the commission of July 30th, 1646,
from Calvert to Hill, which, notwithstanding doubts to the contrary, must have been genuine.
For Lord Baltimore, in the commission of 1648 seems to have acknowledged that his brother had
granted the commission to Hill,[60] who, in a letter to Calvert, said that he had promised
him one-half the customs and rents, the remuneration stipulated in his commission. Hill, not
knowing that Calvert was dead, wrote him a letter, dated June 18th, 1647, urging the payment
of his dues, and the next day Greene, the new Governor, replied that he did not understand
the matter, but that if Hill would send an attorney "full satisfaction should be given him."
When Hill wrote next he waived the authority of Calvert, and based his claim upon the right
of the council to elect him, and in this way placed himself upon an illegal footing, which
circumstance was taken advantage of for a time by the Maryland authorities. But finally at
a court held June 10th, 1648,[61] one year after Calvert's death, a claim from Hill was presented
"for Arrears of what consideration was Covenanted unto him by Leonard Calvert, Esq., for his
Service in the office of Governor of this Province, being the half of his Ldps rents for the
year 1646 & the half of the Customes for the Same yeare." It was ordered by the court, "that
ye half of that yeares Customes as far as it hath not already been received by Capt. Hill shall
be paid unto him by the Ld Prop^rs Attorny out of the first profitts which shall be receivable
to his Ldp * * * his Ldps Receiver shall accompt & pay unto Cap^t Edward Hill or his assignes
the one halfe of his Ldps rents due at Christmas next in Lieu of the S^d rents of the yeare
1646 which were otherwise disposed of to his Ldps use." There is, however, one fact which must
not be lost sight of in regard to Leonard Calvert's commission to Hill. If it was executed
by a member of the council, and therefore was a forgery, for in the records Calvert's name
is signed to it, and the place of the seal is noted, it is not at all likely that it would
have been allowed by Calvert on his return, and by his immediate successors, to be preserved
and copied into the records. If all other proof failed this last would establish the validity
of Hill's commission.

But Calvert, who, throughout his whole career as governor of Maryland, showed unchanging devotion
to his brother's interests, gathered in Virginia a body of soldiers and returned at the end
of 1646 to St. Mary's, where he easily repossessed himself of that part of the country, though
Kent Island remained still in possession of Claiborne's forces. Thus was ended what has been
called Ingle's rebellion, in which the loss of the lord proprietor's personal estate "was in
truth so small as that it was not Considerable when it was come in Ballance with the Safety
of the Province which as the then present Condition of things stood, hung upon so ticklish
a pin as that unless such a disposition had been made thereof an absolute ruin and subversion
of the whole Province would inevitably have followed."[62] Another proof of Hill's regular
appointment is that Calvert on the 29th of December, soon after his return, re-assembled the
Assembly, which Hill had summoned and adjourned, and proceeded with it to enact laws.[63] Although
a later Assembly in 1648 protested against the laws passed by this Assembly, the proprietor
recognized them as valid, and wrote in 1649 that it had been "lawfully continued" by his brother
"ffor although the first Sumons were issued by one who was not our Lawfull Lieutenant there,
yet being afterwards approved of by one that was, it is all one, as to the proceedings afterward
as if at first they had issued from a lawfull Governor."[64] The writer is no lawyer, but it
seems, that, if the Assembly of Hill was "lawfully continued" and "approved" by Calvert, the
recognition by Baltimore must have been legally retroactive, and, therefore, that the laws
passed before Calvert's return must have been legally valid, saving of course the proprietor's
dissent. Leonard Calvert having spent some months in settling the affairs of the province died,
June 9th, 1647, and Greene ruled in his stead. In the following March, Ingle's name again appears
in the records. The governor, on March 4th, 1648, proclaimed pardon to all except Richard Ingle,
and in August of the same year the lord proprietor issued, besides his commissions to Governor
Stone, to the council and to secretary Thomas Hatton, commissions, for the Great Seal, for
muster master general, and for commander of the Isle of Kent. John Price was made muster master
general for his "great Fidelity unto us in that Occasion of the late insurrection and Rebellion
in our said province was begun there by that Notorious Villain Richard Ingle and his Complices,"
and Robert Vaughan was appointed commander of Kent for the same reason.[65] Then in 1650 was
passed the act of Oblivion, excepting Ingle, Durford, and some of the Isle of Kent. In 1649,
Baltimore granted to James Lindsey and Richard Willan certain lands, and directed that in the
grants should be inserted the notice "of their singular and approved worth courage and fidelity
(in Ingle's insurrection) to the end a memory of their merit and of his (the Proprietor) sense
thereof may remain upon record to the honour of them and their posterity forever."[66]

An investigation into Ingle's doings at this time may explain the bitter terms in which he
is mentioned in the official records of Maryland, and also why upon him was foisted the chief
responsibility for the disturbances. During the year 1646, Lord Baltimore was engaged in defending
his charter, against the justice of which such grave charges had been brought by Ingle and
others, in the winter of 1645/6. On January 23rd, 1646/7, application in Baltimore's behalf,
was made to the House of Lords, that the depositions of witnesses made before the Admiralty
Court in regard to Maryland should be read. In a few weeks Baltimore begged that the actions
looking to the repeal of his charter might be delayed, and on the same day certain merchants
in London, who were interested in the Virginia trade, requested that the ordinance should be
sent to the Commons, for Baltimore's petition was intended only to cause delay.[67] The matter
was stayed for the time, but by December, 1649, Ingle had sent to the Council of State a petition
and remonstrance against the government of Lord Baltimore's colony. The hearing, which was
referred to the Committee of the Admiralty, was postponed until January 10th, 1650, when Baltimore's
agent requested it to be deferred until the 16th. Witnesses were summoned and upon Baltimore's
appearance, he was ordered to make answer in writing to Ingle by the 30th. On January 29th
the matter was again postponed until February 6th, "in respect of extraordinary occasions not
permitting them to hear the same to-morrow." Delay followed delay until March 1st, when Ingle
was "unprovided to prove" the charges against Lord Baltimore for misconduct in the government
of Maryland, but on the 15th of the same month, "after several debates of the business depending
between Capt. Ingle and Lord Baltimore, touching a commission granted to Leonard Calvert, *
* * by the late King at Oxford in 1643" the advocate for the State and the attorney general
were directed to examine the validity of the original charter to Cecil, Lord Baltimore. Allusion
to this matter was again made in the records, but nothing showing its result unless it be the
order of the Council of State, of December 23d, 1651, that Lord Baltimore should be allowed
to "pursue his cause according to law."[68]

Ingle seems to have been at this time in the service of what was once a parliament, but which
had been reduced in 1648, by Pride's purge, to about sixty members. In February, 1650, he informed
the Council of State that on board two ships, the "'Flower de Luce' and the 'Thomas and John,'
were persons bound to Virginia, who were enemies of the Commonwealth." The vessels were stayed
for over a month, when they were allowed to sail down to Gravesend, where, before they left
for Virginia, the mayor and justices were to "take the superscription of passengers and mariners
not to engage against the Commonwealth."[69] In April of this year the Council of State ordered
the payment to Ingle of £30 sterling for services and care in keeping Captain Gardner, who
had been arrested for treason, in having tried to betray Portland Castle.[70] He again comes
into notice in 1653, by some letters written by him to Edward Marston. He had been cast away
by shipwreck in the Downs, and was then at Dover, where he had been very ill. Having heard
that two prizes which he had helped to secure, had been condemned and that the rest of the
men had obtained their shares, he wrote to secure the eleven shares due him, and told Marston
to send one part to his wife, and the other to him. On November 14th, he again wrote that he
had received no answer although "I have written you every post these 3 weeks, having been sick
my want of money is great."[71] This is the last fact, which can at present be found, about
Richard Ingle, who first came into notice demanding tobacco debts, and is discovered, at last
demanding prize money. These two acts were typical of the man, he was always on the lookout
for gain and yet remained a staunch adherent to the Long Parliament, which did so much to strengthen
English liberties, but whose acts led to such extreme measures as those which culminated in
the execution of the self-willed unfortunate Charles I.

By a careful consideration of all the facts, it will be seen that the acts of Richard Ingle
are in some cases legendary, and as such naturally have become more heinous with every successive
account. The endeavor has been in this paper to give an unprejudiced historical account of
his life, but in view of the mis-statements about him, it still remains to sum up, and examine
the specific charges against him. He is accused of having stolen the silver seal of the province.
Lord Baltimore's own statements, however, concerning it are doubtful. "Whereas our great seal
of the said province of Maryland was treacherously and violently taken away from thence by
Richard Ingle or his complices in or about February,[72] 1644/5," he wrote in August, 1648.
Nothing had been said according to the records up to that time in Maryland about the loss of
the seal. On the contrary, in a commission given by Governor Greene on July 4th, 1647, over
a year before the proprietor's commission for the great seal, are the words, "Given under my
hand and the Seal of the province."[73] and in the proclamation of March 4th, 1648, Greene
promised pardon "under my hand and the seal of the province,"[74] to all out of the province
except Ingle, who should confess their faults before a certain date.

It may be urged against these facts that "under my hand and the seal of the province," was
mere legal phraseology. But those which have been given are the only two instances of the use
of the term from 1646 to 1648, and are both preceded and followed by commissions, &c., ending
"and this shall be your commission," or "given at St. Mary's," in which, if the term was merely
technical language, why was it not more frequently used? Again, it may be said that it was
a temporary seal. If it were, it is strange that no mention is made of the fact in the records
of the province, or in Lord Baltimore's commission for the new seal. It was hoped and desired
that in this paper no occasion would arise to make accusations against any of Ingle's opponents,
but historic truth now requires it to be done. It must be remembered that Baltimore was in
constant danger of losing his charter, in a great measure, on account of Ingle's activity against
him. Upon his authority alone is based the charge against Ingle about the seal, but of how
much value is the authority of one who, at the very same time and in a commission sent out
with that of the seal, wrote that Leonard Calvert "was limited by our commission to him not
to appoint" any person governor "unless such person were of our privy council there,"[75] although
no such limitation as to the governor's right was made in any of the commissions to Leonard
Calvert so this clause in the lord proprietor's commission resolves itself into a Machiavellian
statement. It is hardly credible that Lord Baltimore could have made such a statement from
ignorance, for no one knew the commission better than the author of it. But notwithstanding
the evidence against Lord Baltimore, the writer has too high an opinion of his character to
attribute to him the diplomatic lie. Lord Baltimore was no doubt influenced a great deal, by
what was reported to him concerning Maryland, so the blame must rest upon his informers. Still
if these persons would resort to such methods in one case, they would be likely to do so in
other instances. Whoever was the author of the statement, it throws doubt upon other supposed
facts of this period, and leads to the conclusion that the commission for a new seal was one
of the reconstructive acts of the proprietor, on a par with the treatment of Hill.

Ingle has been charged with the destruction of the records of the province. What was Baltimore's
opinion? "We understand" he wrote in 1651, "that in the late Rebellion there One thousand Six
hundred Forty and four most of the Records of that province being then lost or embezzled."[76]
This hearsay statement of Lord Baltimore may have been based upon the testimony in 1649, of
Thomas Hatton, Secretary of the province, of the receipt of books from Mr. Bretton, who "delivered
to me this Book, and another lesser Book with a Parchment Cover, divers of the Leaves thereof
being cut or torn out, and many of them being lost and much worn out and defaced together with
divers other Papers and Writings bound together in a Bundle,"[77] and swore that they were
all the documents belonging to the secretary or register which could be found, "except some
Warrants, and some Draughts of Mr. Hill's Time." All the records, therefore, were not destroyed,
but in 1649, there were in existence papers belonging to the Hill regime. But greater proofs
against the vandalism of Ingle are the records themselves, or the copies of them, which could
not have been made if the originals had been destroyed, and which have at last been deposited
where thieves do not break through nor steal. There have been preserved among the records up
to 1647, the original proprietary record books, liber Z., 1637-1644 and liber P. R., 1642 to
February 12, 1645. The Council Proceedings, 1636-1657, the Assembly Proceedings, 1638-1658,
and liber F., 1636-1642, proprietary records, have been handed down in copies. The loss of
liber F., 1636-1642, can no more be attributed to Ingle than can the loss of liber K., 1692-1694,
which was made fifty years after Ingle's time. Both of these, as well as records of later years,
have been preserved in copies only, but a brief study of the Calendar of State Archives, prefixed
to the Acts of Assembly, will demonstrate that the destruction of records by Ingle could not
have been so great as has been supposed. But did he destroy any? There are gaps in the records,
that exist between February 14, 1645, when the rebellion occurred, and December, 1646, when
Calvert returned, but it is not likely that under the existing circumstances very great care
was taken of the records of these twenty-two months, and moreover there is no proof that Ingle
was in the province after 1645, for he was probably in London in December of that year, and
certainly in the following February. His appointing Cornwallis his attorney for collecting
Maryland and Virginia debts would also lead one to believe that he did not return to the province.
Some of the records of the Hill government, however, were in existence in 1649, but as far
as is known have since disappeared. Ingle certainly did not destroy them, and indeed to a man
engaged in the tobacco trade, there were few inducements to waste his time, and that of his
men cutting up records.

It is difficult to understand why Lord Baltimore should have called Ingle an "ungrateful villain,"
for the reception the latter met at St. Mary's in 1644, was not calculated to inspire one with
gratitude. The compensation offered Ingle might have been deemed liberal, but the Maryland
authorities acknowledged that they had to make this offer for the public good and safety, and,
therefore, no particular credit can be given them for kindness towards the troublesome mariner.
But the relations between Ingle and Cornwallis are rather perplexing. The latter accused Ingle
of not returning the value of goods entrusted to him, and also of landing, during his absence,
"some men near his house," and rifling "him to the value of 2,500 l at least."[78] All this
was done after Cornwallis had showed his devotion to Parliament, by releasing Ingle. It must
be remembered in connection with the devotion to Parliament, that Ingle was doing the great
carrying trade for Cornwallis. Besides, after Ingle had made him his attorney, he went to Maryland
and there sued three men for the pillage and destruction of his property, without implicating
Ingle. In the absence of full records concerning these two men, it is unfair to judge either
of them harshly in this matter.

The indefinite allusion to Ingle's piracy in 1644 was not sustained, but in 1649 he was again
called "pirate." The definition of piracy has undergone many changes within the past three
hundred years. From robbery committed upon the high seas, it has come to mean, "acts of violence
done upon the ocean or unappropriated lands or within the territory of a state through descent
from the sea, by a body of men acting independently of any political or organized society."[79]
The pirate has also been held as an enemy, whom the whole human race can oppress. These definitions
are from the international standpoint. What was the English law at the time of Ingle? The treatment
of pirates was regulated by the Act of Parliament, made in the reign of Henry VIII.,[80] and
Sir Leoline Jenkins, on September 2d, 1668, at a session of the Admiralty, said, "now robbery
as 'tis distinguished from thieving or larceny, implies not only the actual taking away of
my goods, while I am, as we say, in peace, but also the putting me in fear, by taking them
away by force and arms out of my hands, or in my sight and presence, when this is done upon
the sea, without a lawful commission of war or reprisals, it is downright Piracy."[81] In the
Assembly of March, 1638, piracy was defined as follows: "William dawson with divers others
did assault the vessels of Capt. Thomas Cornwaleys his company feloniously and as pyrates &
robbers to take the said vessels and did discharge divers peices charged wi^th bulletts & shott
against the said Thomas Cornwaleys, &c."[82] Granted, although it is doubtful, that Ingle seized
the pinnace, riding in St. Inigoes' creek, he was not, therefore, a pirate. According to the
testimony, he used no force, for the one in charge of the pinnace allowed him to take it; and
the act was not committed on the high seas. His acts on the land were rather contradictory,
if one reads the testimony. In 1647, for instance, a certain Walter Beane[83] at the request
of Cuthbert Fenwick, said that during the plundering time, with the consent of Fenwick, he
paid Ingle some tobacco, which was due Fenwick or Cornwallis. Ingle then gave him the following,
"Received of Walter Beane five hund^r Thirty Eight pounds of Tob for a debt th^t the s^d Walter
Beane did owe to Cuthbert ffenwick. Witness my hand,

    RICH^D. INGLE."

Beane stated also that sometime before Ingle came, he paid six hogsheads of tobacco to Fenwick
for Cornwallis, and that Ingle, upon his arrival, sent eleven men to fetch the hogsheads and
other tobacco; that when Beane refused to give them up, Ingle was notified, and sent a note
threatening extreme measures, and Beane was thus forced to give up the tobacco. Does it not
seem curious that Ingle should give a receipt for one batch of tobacco, and within a short
time have other tobacco forcibly seized? Of course the authorities of Maryland might have considered
such acts piratical. But they were not. Ingle had a commission from Parliament, to relieve
the planters in Maryland, by furnishing them arms, &c. He found the government of Maryland
at enmity with Parliament, which was the actual government of England at that time, and assisted
the friends of Parliament in Maryland. Even if he exceeded the provisions of his letter of
marque he was responsible to Parliament alone.[84] That the English authorities did not disapprove
of his conduct is shown by the weight attached to his statements, and by the fact that he was
afterwards in the service of the Commonwealth.

As to Ingle's having been a "rebel," the facts all point to his participation in the beginning
of a rebellion, caused probably, by those dissatisfied with Leonard Calvert's rule, more probably
by the influence of William Claiborne, who in spite of condemnatory acts by the Maryland Assembly,
and the vacillating measures of Charles I., insisted for many years upon his right to Kent
Island. But rebellion is viewed in different ways: by those against whom it is made, with horror
and detestation; by those who make it, with pride and ofttimes with devotion. If Ingle led
on the rebellion, he was acting in Maryland, only as Cromwell afterwards did on a larger scale,
in England, and as Bacon, the brave and noble, did in Virginia, and to be placed in the same
category with many, who will be handed down to future generations as rebels, will be no discredit
to the first Maryland rebel.
