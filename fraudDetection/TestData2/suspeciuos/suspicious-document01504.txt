THE COLLABORATORS.

By Robert S. Hichens

1896

I.

"Why shouldn't we collaborate?" said Henley in his most matter-of-fact way, as Big Ben gave
voice to the midnight hour. "Everybody does it nowadays. Two heads may be really better than
one, although I seldom believe in the truth of accepted sayings. Your head is a deuced good
one, Andrew; but--now don't get angry--you are too excitable and too intense to be left quite
to yourself, even in book-writing, much less in the ordinary affairs of life. I think you were
born to collaborate, and to collaborate with me. You can give me everything I lack, and I can
give you a little of the sense of humour, and act as a drag upon the wheel."

"None of the new humour, Jack; that shall never appear in a book with my name attached to it.
Dickens I can tolerate. He is occasionally felicitous. The story of 'The Dying Clown,' for
instance, crude as it is it has a certain grim tragedy about it. But the new humour came from
the pit, and should go--to the Sporting Times."

"Now, don't get excited. The book is not in proof yet--perhaps never will be. You need not
be afraid. My humour will probably be old enough. But what do you y to the idea?"

Andrew Trenchard sat for awhile in silent consideration. His legs were stretched out, and his
slippered feet rested on the edge of the brass fender. A nimbus of smoke surrounded his swarthy
features, his shock of black hair, his large, rather morose, dark eyes. He was a man of about
twenty-five, with an almost horribly intelligent face, so observant that he tried people, so
acute that he frightened them. His intellect was never for a moment at rest, unless in sleep.
He devoured himself with his own emotions, and others with his analysis of theirs. His mind
was always crouching to spring, except when it was springing. He lived an irregular life, and
all horrors had a subtle fascination for him. As Henley had remarked, he possessed little sense
of humour, but immense sense of evil and tragedy and sorrow. He seldom found time to calmly
regard the drama of life from the front. He was always at the stage-door, sending in his card,
and requesting admittance behind the scenes. What was on the surface only interested him in
so far as it indicated what was beneath, and in all mental matters his normal procedure was
that of the disguised detective. Stupid people disliked him. Clever people distrusted him while
they admired him. The mediocre suggested that he was liable to go off his head, and the profound
predicted for him fame, tempered by suicide.

Most people considered him interesting, and a few were sincerely attached to him. Among these
last was Henley, who had been his friend at Oxford, and had taken rooms in the same house with
him in Smith's Square, Westminster. Both the young men were journalists. Henley, who, as he
had acknowledged, possessed a keen sense of humour, and was not so much ashamed of it as he
ought to have been, wrote--very occasionally--for Punch, and more often for Fun, was dramatic
critic of a lively society paper, and "did" the books--in a sarcastic vein--for a very unmuzzled
"weekly," that was libellous by profession and truthful by oversight. Trenchard, on the other
hand, wrote a good deal of very condensed fiction, and generally placed it; contributed brilliant
fugitive articles to various papers and magazines, and was generally spoken of by the inner
circle of the craft as "a rising man," and a man to be afraid of. Henley was full of common-sense,
only moderately introspective, facile, and vivacious. He might be trusted to tincture a book
with the popular element, and yet not to spoil it; for his literary sense was keen, despite
his jocular leaning toward the new humour. He lacked imagination; but his descriptive powers
were racy, and he knew instinctively what was likely to take, and what would be caviare to
the general.

Trenchard, as he considered the proposition now made to him, realized that Henley might supply
much that he lacked in any book that was written with a view to popular success. There could
be no doubt of it.

"But we should quarrel inevitably and doggedly," he said at last. "If I can not hold myself
in, still less can I be held in. We should tear one another in pieces. When I write, I feel
that what I write must be, however crude, however improper or horrible it may seem. You would
want to hold me back."

"My dear boy, I should more than want to--I should do it. In collaboration, no man can be a
law unto himself. That must be distinctly understood before we begin. I don't wish to force
the proposition on you. Only we are both ambitious devils. We are both poor. We are both determined
to try a book. Have we more chance of succeeding if we try one together? I believe so. You
have the imagination, the grip, the stern power to evolve the story, to make it seem inevitable,
to force it step by step on its way. I can lighten that way. I can plant a few flowers--they
shall not be peonies, I promise you--on the roadside. And I can, and, what is more, will, check
you when you wish to make the story impossibly horrible or fantastic to the verge of the insane.
Now, you needn't be angry. This book, if we write it, has got to be a good book, and yet a
book that will bring grist to the mill. That is understood."

Andrew's great eyes flashed in the lamplight.

"The mill," he said. "Sometimes I feel inclined to let it stop working. Who would care if one
wheel ceased to turn? There are so many others."

"Ah, that's the sort of thing I shall cut out of the book!" cried Henley, turning the soda-water
into his whisky with a cheerful swish.

"We will be powerful, but never morbid; tragic, if you like, but not without hope. We need
not aspire too much; but we will not look at the stones in the road all the time. And the dunghills,
in which those weird fowl, the pessimistic realists, love to rake, we will sedulously avoid.
Cheer up, old fellow, and be thankful that you possess a corrective in me."

Trenchard's face lightened in a rare smile as, with a half-sigh, he said:

"I believe you are right, and that I need a collaborator, an opposite, who is yet in sympathy
with me. Yes; either of us might fail alone; together we should succeed."

"Will succeed, my boy!"

"But not by pandering to the popular taste," added Andrew in his most sombre tones, and with
a curl of his thin, delicately-moulded lips. "I shall never consent to that."

"We will not call it pandering. But we must hit the taste of the day, or we shall look a couple
of fools."

"People are always supposed to look fools when, for once, they are not fools," said Andrew.

"Possibly. But now our bargain is made. Strike hands upon it. Henceforth we are collaborators
as well as friends."

Andrew extended his long, thin, feverish hand, and, as Henley held it for a moment, he started
at the intense, vivid, abnormal personality its grasp seemed to reveal. To collaborate with
Trenchard was to collaborate with a human volcano.

"And now for the germ of our book," he said, as the clock struck one. "Where shall we find it?"

Trenchard leaned forward in his chair, with his hands pressed upon the arms.

"Listen, and I will give it you," he said.

And, almost until the dawn and the wakening of the slumbering city, Henley sat and listened,
and forgot that his pipe was smoked out, and that his feet were cold. Trenchard had strange
powers, and could enthral as he could also repel.

*****

"It is a weird idea, and it is very powerful," Henley said at last. "But you stop short at
the critical moment. Have you not devised a dénouement?"

"Not yet. That is where the collaboration will come in. You must help me. We must talk it over.
I am in doubt."

He got up and passed his hands nervously through his thick hair.

"My doubt has kept me awake so many nights!" he said, and his voice was rather husky and worn.

Henley looked at him almost compassionately.

"How intensely you live in your fancies!"

"My fancies?" said Andrew, with a sudden harsh accent, and darting a glance of curious watchfulness
upon his friend. "My---- Yes, yes. Perhaps I do. Perhaps I try to. Some people have souls that
must escape from their environment, their miserable life-envelope, or faint. Many of us labour
and produce merely to create an atmosphere in which we ourselves may breathe for awhile and
be happy. Damn this London, and this lodging, and this buying bread with words! I must create
for myself an atmosphere. DOMINI-CANN.

Landholders in Lonsdale South of the Sands.--In his History of Lancashire, Baines states (vol. i.
chap. iv.) that a return of the principal landholders in Lonsdale South of the Sands, in the
time of James I., has been kept; but he does not state where the return is registered, nor
whether it was in a private or public form.

In fact, it is impossible to make any reference to the return, from
the brief mention made of it by Baines.

Perhaps some one of your Lancashire correspondents may be acquainted
with the sources of the learned historian's information.

If so, it would much oblige your correspondent to be directed to them, as also to any of the Lancashire
genealogical authorities referring to the district of Lonsdale South of the Sands.

Rotation of the Earth.--Has the experiment which about two years ago was much talked of, for
demonstrating the rotation of the earth by means of a pendulum, been
satisfactorily carried out and proved?

And if so, where is the best place for finding an account of it?

The diagram by Mr. Little in the Illustrated London News does not
seem to explain the matter very fully.

Nelson and Wellington.--The following statement has been going the round of the American newspapers
since the death of the Duke of Wellington. Is it true?--"Lord Nelson was the eighteenth in descent
from King Edward I., and {331} the Duke of Wellington was descended from the same monarch."

Are White Cats deaf?--White cats are reputed to be "hard of hearing." I have known many instances,
and in all stupidity seemed to accompany the deafness. Can any instances be given of white cats
possessing the function of hearing in anything like perfection?

Arms in Dugdale's "Warwickshire," &c.--In Dugdale's
Warwickshire (1656), p. 733. fig. 21., is a coat of arms from the
Prior's Lodgings at Maxstoke, viz. Or, fretty of ten pieces sa. with
a canton gu. And in Shaw's Hist. of Staffordshire, vol. i. p. *210.,
is the notice of a similar coat from Armitage Church, near Rugeley,
extracted out of Church Notes, by Wyrley the herald, taken about 1597:
viz. "Rugeley as before, impaling O. fretty of ... S. with a canton
G. Query if ..."

Dugdale gives another coat, p. 111. fig. 12., from
the windows of Trinity Church, Coventry; viz. Arg. on a chev. sa.
three stars of the first. There is a mitre over this coat.

Can any
of the correspondents of "N. & Q." assign the family names to these
arms? Does the mitre necessarily imply a bishop or mitred abbot; and,
if not, does it belong to John de Ruggeley, who was Abbot of Merevale
(not far from Coventry) temp. Hen. VI., one branch of whose family
bore--Arg. on a chev. sa. three mullets of the first. Their hero was a man of strong intellect, of physical
beauty, full at first of the joy of life, chivalrous, a believer in the innate goodness of
human nature. Believing in goodness, he believed also ardently in influence. In fact, he was
a worshipper of influence, and his main passion was to seize upon the personalities of others,
and impose his own personality upon them. He loved to make men and women see with his eyes
and hear with his ears, adopt his theories as truth, take his judgment for their own. All that
he thought was--to him. He never doubted himself, therefore he could not bear that those around
him should not think with him, act towards men and women as he acted, face life as he faced
it. Yet he was too subtle ever to be dogmatic. He never shouted in the market-place. He led
those with whom he came in contact as adroitly as if he had been evil, and to the influence
of others he was as adamant.

Events brought into his life a woman, complex, subtle too, with a naturally noble character
and fine understanding, a woman who, like so many women, might have been anything, and was
far worse than nothing--a hopeless, helpless slave, the victim of the morphia habit, which
had gradually degraded her, driven her through sloughs of immorality, wrecked a professional
career which at one time had been almost great, shattered her constitution, though not all
her still curious beauty, and ruined her, to all intents and purposes, body and soul. The man
and the woman met, and in a flash the man saw what she had been, what she might have been,
what, perhaps, in spite of all, she still was, somewhere, somehow. In her horrible degradation,
in her dense despair, she fascinated him. He could only see the fire bursting out of the swamp.
He could only feel on his cheek the breath of the spring in the darkness of the charnel-house.
He knew that she gave to him his great lifework. Her monstrous habit he simply could not comprehend.
It was altogether as fantastic to him as absolute virtue sometimes seems to absolute vice.
He looked upon it, and felt as little kinship with it as a saint might feel with a vampire.
To him it was merely a hideous and extraordinary growth, which had fastened like a cancer upon
a beautiful and wonderful body, and which must be cut out. He was profoundly interested.

He loved the woman. Seeing her governed entirely by a vice, he made the very common mistake
of believing her to have a weak personality, easily falling, perhaps for that very reason as
easily lifted to her feet. He resolved to save her, to devote all his powers, all his subtlety,
all his intellect, all his strong force of will, to weaning this woman from her fatal habit.
She was a married woman, long ago left, to kill herself if she would, by the husband whose
happiness she had wrecked. He took her to live with him. For her sake he defied the world,
and set himself to do angel's work when people believed him at the devil's. He resolved to
wrap her, to envelop her in his influence, to enclose her in his strong personality. Here,
at last, was a grand, a noble opportunity for the legitimate exercise of his master passion.
He was confident of victory.

But his faith in himself was misplaced. This woman, whom he thought so weak, was yet stronger
than he. Although he could not influence her, he began to find that she could influence him.
At first he struggled with her vice, which he could not understand. He thought himself merely
horrified at it; then he began to lose the horror in wonder at its power. Its virility, as
it were, fascinated him just a little. A vice so overwhelmingly strong seemed to him at length
almost glorious, almost God-like. There was a sort of humanity about it. Yes, it was like a
being who lived and who conquered.

The woman loved him, and he tried to win her from it; but her passion for it was greater than
her passion for him, greater than had been her original passion for purity, for health, for
success, for homage, for all lovely and happiness-making things. Her passion for it was so
great that it roused the man's curiosity at last; it made him hold his breath, and stand in
awe, and desire furtively to try just once for himself what its dominion was like, to test
its power as one may test the power of an electric battery. He dared not do this openly, for
fear the fact of his doing so might drive the woman still farther on the downward path. So
in secret he tasted the fascinations of her vice, once--and again--and yet again. But still
he struggled for her while he was ceasing to struggle for himself. Still he combated for her
the foe who was conquering him. Very strange, very terrible was his position in that London
house with her, isolated from the world. For his friends had dropped him. Even those who were
not scandalized at his relations with this woman had ceased to come near him. They found him
blind and deaf to the ordinary interests of life. He never went out anywhere, unless occasionally
with her to some theatre. He never invited anyone to come and see him. At first the woman absorbed
all his interest, all his powers of love--and then at last the woman and her vice, which was
becoming his too. By degrees he sank lower and lower, but he never told the woman the truth,
and he still urged her to give up her horrible habit, which now he loved. And she laughed in
his face, and asked him if a human creature who had discovered a new life would be likely to
give it up. "A new death," he murmured, and then, looking in a mirror near to him, saw his
lips curved in the thin, pale smile of the hypocrite.

So far the two young men had written. They worked hard, but their industry was occasionally
interrupted by the unaccountable laziness of Andrew, who, after toiling with unremitting fury
for some days, and scarcely getting up from his desk, would disappear, and perhaps not return
for several nights. Henley remonstrated with him, but in vain.

"But what do you do, my dear fellow?" he asked. "What becomes of you?"

"I go away to think out what is coming. The environment I seek helps me," answered Andrew,
with a curious, gleaming smile. "I return full of fresh copy."

This was true enough. He generally mysteriously departed when the book was beginning to flag,
and on his reappearance he always set to work with new vigour and confidence. 

Burke informs us that William Cann, Esq., was Mayor of Bristol in 1648, and that his son, Sir Robert
Cann, also Mayor, and afterwards M.P. for that city, was knighted by Charles II. in 1662, and created
a Baronet, September 13th in the same year. You invented the woman,
her character, her appearance. You named her Olive Beauchamp."

"Olive Beauchamp," Andrew repeated, with a strange lingering over the two words, which he pronounced
in a very curious voice that trembled, as if with some keen emotion, love or hate. "Yes; I
named her as you say."

"Then, as the man in the play remarks, 'Where do I come in?'" Henley asked, half laughing,
half vexed. "Upon my word, I shall have some compunction in putting my name below yours on
the title-page when the book is published, if it ever is."

Andrew's lips twitched once or twice uneasily. Then he said, "You need not have any such compunction.
The greatest chapter will probably be written by you."

"Which chapter do you mean?"

"That which winds the story up--that which brings the whole thing to its legitimate conclusion.
You must write the dénouement."

"I doubt if I could. And then we have not even now decided what it is to be."

"We need not bother about that yet. It will come. Fate will decide it for us."

"What do you mean, Andrew? How curiously you talk about the book sometimes--so precisely as
if it were true!"

Trenchard smiled again, struck a match, and lit his pipe.

"It seems true to me--when I am writing it," he answered. "I have been writing it these last
two days and nights when I have been away, and now I can go forward, if you agree to the new
development which I suggest."

It was night. He had been absent for some days, and had just returned. Henley, meanwhile, had
been raging because the book had come to a complete standstill. He himself could do nothing
at it, since they had reached a dead-lock, and had not talked over any new scenes, or mutually
decided upon the turn events were now to take. He felt rather cross and sore.

"You can go forward," he said: "yes, after your holiday. You might at least tell me when you
are going."

"I never know myself," Andrew said rather sadly.

He was looking very white and worn, and his eyes were heavy.

"But I have thought some fresh material out. My idea is this: The man now becomes such a complete
slave to the morphia habit that concealment of the fact is scarcely possible. And, indeed,
he ceases to desire to conceal it from the woman. The next scene will be an immensely powerful
one--that in which he tells her the truth."

"You do not think it would be more natural if she found it out against his will? It seems to
me that what he had concealed so long he would try to hide for ever."

"No," Andrew said emphatically; "that would not be so."

"But----"

"Look here," the other interrupted, with some obvious irritability; "let me tell you what I
have conceived, and raise any objections afterwards if you wish to raise them. He would tell
her the truth himself. He would almost glory in doing so. That is the nature of the man. We
have depicted his pride in his own powers, his temptation, his struggle--his fall, as it would
be called----"

"As it would be called."

"Well, well!--his fall, then. And now comes the moment when his fall is complete. He bends
the neck finally beneath his tyrant, and then he goes to the woman and he tells her the truth."

"But explain matters a little more. Do you mean that he is glad, and tells almost with triumph;
or that he is appalled, and tells her with horror?"

"Ah! That is where the power of the scene lies. He is appalled. He is like a man plunged at
last into hell without hope of future redemption. He tells her the truth with horror."

"And she?"

"It is she who triumphs. Look here: it will be like this."

Andrew leaned forward across the table that stood between their two worn armchairs. His thin,
feverish-looking hands, with the fingers strongly twisted together, rested upon it. His dark
eyes glittered with excitement.

"It will be like this. It is evening--a dark, dull evening, like the day before yesterday,
closing in early, throttling the afternoon prematurely, as it were. A drizzling rain falls
softly, drenching everything--the sodden leaves of the trees on the Embankment, the road, which
is heavy with clinging yellow mud, the stone coping of the wall that skirts the river.

"And the river heaves along. Its gray, dirty waves are beaten up by a light, chilly wind, and
chase the black barges with a puny, fretful, sinister fury, falling back from their dark, wet
sides with a hiss of baffled hatred. Yes, it is dreary weather.

"Do you know, Henley, as I know, the strange, subtle influence of certain kinds of weather?
There are days on which I could do great deeds merely because of the way the sun is shining.
There are days, there are evenings, when I could commit crimes merely because of the way the
wind is whispering, the river is sighing, the dingy night is clustering around me. There can
be an angel in the weather, or there can be a devil. On this evening I am describing there
is a devil in the night!

"The lights twinkle through the drizzling rain, and they are blurred, as bright eyes are blurred,
and made dull and ugly, by tears. Two or three cabs roll slowly by the houses on the Embankment..
A few people hurry past along the slippery, shining pavement. But as the night closes in there
is little life outside those tall, gaunt houses that are so near the river! And in one of those
houses the man comes down to the woman to tell her the truth.

"There is a devil in the weather that night, as I said, and that devil whispers to the man,
and tells him that it is now his struggle must end finally, and the new era of unresisted yielding
to the vice begin. In the sinister darkness, in the diminutive, drenching mist of rain, he
speaks, and the man listens, and bows his head and answers 'yes!' It is over. He has fallen
finally. He is resolved, with a strange, dull obstinacy that gives him a strange, dull pleasure--do
you see?--to go down to the room below, and tell the woman that she has conquered him--that
his power of will is a reed which can be crushed--that henceforth there shall be two victims
instead of one. He goes down."

Andrew paused a moment. His lips were twitching again. He looked terribly excited. Henley listened
in silence. He had lost all wish to interrupt.

"He goes down into the room below where the woman is, with her dark hair, and her dead-white
face, and her extraordinary eyes--large, luminous, sometimes dull and without expression, sometimes
dilated, and with an unnatural life staring out of them. She is on the sofa near the fire.
He sits down beside her. His head falls into his hands, and at first he is silent. He is thinking
how he will tell her. She puts her soft, dry hand on his, and she says: 'I am very tired to-night.
Do not begin your evening sermon. Let me have it to-morrow. How you must love me to be so persistent!
and how you must love me to be so stupid as to think that your power of will can break the
power of such a habit as mine!'

"Then he draws his hand away from hers, and he lifts his head from his hands, and he tells
her the truth. She leans back against a cushion staring at him in silence, devouring him with
her eyes, which have become very bright and eager and searching. Presently he stops.

"'Go on,' she says, 'go on. Tell me more. Tell me all you feel. Tell me how the habit stole
upon you, and came to you again and again, and stayed with you. Tell me how you first liked
it, and then loved it, and how it was something to you, and then much, and then everything.
Go on! go on!'

"And he catches her excitement. He conceals nothing from her. All the hideous, terrible, mental
processes he has been through, he details to her, at first almost gloating over his own degradation.
He even exaggerates, as a man exaggerates in telling a story to an eager auditor. He is carried
away by her strange fury of listening. He lays bare his soul; he exposes its wounds; he sears
them with red-hot irons for her to see. And then at last all is told. He can think of no more
details. He has even embellished the abominable truth. So he is silent, and he looks at her."

"And what does she do?" asked Henley, with a catch in his voice as he spoke. Undoubtedly in
relating a fictitious narrative Andrew had a quite abnormal power of making it appear true
and real.

"She looks at him, and then she bursts out laughing. Her eyes shine with triumph. She is glad;
she is joyous with the joy of a lost soul when it sees that other souls are irrevocably lost
too; she laughs, and she says nothing."

"And the man?"

Andrew's eyes suddenly dilated. He leaned forward and laid his hand on Henley's arm.

"Ah, the man! that is my great idea. As she laughs his heart is changed. His love for her suddenly
dies. Its place is taken by hatred. He realizes then, for the first time, while he hears her
laugh, what she has done to him. He knows that she has ruined him, and that she is proud of
it--that she is rejoicing in having won him to destruction. He sees that his perdition is merely
a feather in her cap. He hates her. Oh, how he hates her!--hates her!"

The expression on Andrew's face became terrible as he spoke--cruel, malignant, almost fiendish.
Henley turned cold, and shook off his hand abruptly.

"That is horrible!" he said. "I object to that. The book will be one of unrelieved gloom."

"The book!" said Andrew.

"Yes. You behave really as if the story were true, as if everything in it were ordained--inevitable."

"It seems so to me; it is so. What must be, must be. If you are afraid of tragedy, you ought
never to have joined me in starting upon such a story. Even what has never happened must be
made to seem actual to be successful. The art of fiction is to imitate truth with absolute
fidelity, not to travesty it. In such circumstances the man's love would be changed to hatred."

"Yes, if the woman's demeanour were such as you have described. But why should she be so callous?
I do not think that is natural."

"You do not know the woman," began Andrew harshly. Then he stopped speaking abruptly, and a
violent flush swept over his face.

"I know her as well as you do, my dear fellow," rejoined Henley, laughing. "How you manage
to live in your dreams! You certainly do create an atmosphere for yourself with a vengeance,
and for me too. I believe you have an abnormal quantity of electricity concealed about you
somewhere, and sometimes you give me a shock and carry me out of myself. If this is collaboration,
it is really a farce. From the very first you have had things all your own way. You have talked
me over to your view upon every single occasion; but now I am going to strike. I object to
the conduct you have devised for Olive. It will alienate all sympathy from her; it is the behaviour
of a devil."

"It is the behaviour of a woman," said Andrew, with a cold cynicism that seemed to cut like
a knife.

"How can you tell? How can you judge of women so surely?"

"I study all strange phenomena, women among the rest."

"Have you ever met an Olive Beauchamp, then, in real life?" said Henley.

The question was put more than half in jest; but Trenchard received it with a heavy frown.

"Don't let us quarrel about the matter," he said, "I can only tell you this; and mind, Jack,
I mean it. It is my unalterable resolve. Either the story must proceed upon the lines that
I have indicated, or I cannot go on with it at all. It would be impossible for me to write
it differently."

"And this is collaboration, is it?" exclaimed the other, trying to force a laugh, though even
his good-nature could scarcely stand Trenchard's trampling demeanour.

"I can't help it. I cannot be inartistic and untrue to Nature even for the sake of a friend."

"Thank you. Well, I have no desire to ruin your work, Andrew; but it is really useless for
this farce to continue. Do what you like, and let us make no further pretence of collaborating.
I cannot act as a drag upon such a wheel as yours. I will not any longer be a dead-weight upon
you. Our temperaments evidently unfit us to be fellow-workers; and I feel that your strength
and power are so undeniable that you may, perhaps, be able to carry this weary tragedy through,
and by sheer force make it palatable to the public. I will protest no more; I will only cease
any longer to pretend to have a finger in this literary pie."

Andrew's morose expression passed away like a cloud. He got up and laid his hand upon Henley's
shoulder.

"You make me feel what a beast I am," he said. "But I can't help it. I was made so. Do forgive
me, Jack. I have taken the bit between my teeth, I know. But--this story seems to me no fiction;
it is a piece of life, as real to me as those stars I see through the window-pane are real
to me--as my own emotions are real to me. Jack, this book has seized me. Believe me, if it
is written as I wish, it will make an impression upon the world that will be great. The mind
of the world is given to me like a sheet of blank paper. I will write upon it with my heart's
blood. But"--and here his manner became strangely impressive, and his sombre, heavy eyes gazed
deeply into the eyes of his friend--"remember this! You will finish this book. I feel that;
I know it. I cannot tell you why. But so it is ordained. Let me write as far as I can, Jack,
and let me write as I will. But do not let us quarrel. The book is ours, not mine. And--don't--don't
take away your friendship from me."

The last words were said with an outburst of emotion that was almost feminine in intensity.
Henley felt deeply moved, for, as a rule, Andrew's manner was not specially affectionate, or
even agreeable.

"It is all right, old fellow," he said, in the embarrassed English manner which often covers
so much that might with advantage be occasionally revealed. "Go on in your own way. I believe
you are a genius, and I am only trying to clip the wings that may carry you through the skies.
Go on in your own way, and consult me only when you feel inclined."

Andrew took his hand and pressed it in silence.

III.

It was some three weeks after this that one afternoon Trenchard laid down his pen at the conclusion
of a chapter, and, getting up, thrust his hands into his pockets and walked to the window.

The look-out was rather dreary. A gray sky leaned over the great, barrack-like church that
gives an ecclesiastical flavour to Smith's Square. A few dirty sparrows fluttered above the
gray pavement--feverish, unresting birds, Trenchard named them silently, as he watched their
meaningless activity, their jerky, ostentatious deportment, with lacklustre, yet excited, eyes.
How gray everything looked, tame, colourless, indifferent! The light was beginning to fade
stealthily out of things. The gray church was gradually becoming shadowy. In answer to a query
from a worthy farmer, "to what cause he attributed the present depressed state of agriculture?"
Cobden unhesitatingly replied, "to over-production." Cross-questioning of this kind would speedily
prove the emptiness and ignorance of the man.]

JOLLY FATHER JOE

A TALE FROM "THE GOLDEN LEGEND," IN HONOUR OF THE B.V.M., TO BE READ ESPECIALLY ON THE 15TH
OF AUGUST, BEING THE FESTIVAL OF HER ASSUMPTION.

In olden times, when monks and friars, and priests of all degrees, About the land were cluster'd thick
as swarms of summer bees, And, like the bees on sunny days, were wont abroad to roam, To gather,
as they went along, sweet provender for home,

Bright blazed the
abbey's kitchen fire, the larder well was stored, And merrily the
beards wagg'd round the refectorial board.

What layman dare declare that they led not a life divine, Who sat
in state to dine off plate, and quaff the rosy wine?

Good men, and true as bricks were they, to every Church decree; Because as kings were called "The
State,"[K] they said "the Church are we;" And then all men believed "The Church" could pardon
every sin; And foul as was the outward stain, wash white the soul within.

No marvel that they prosper'd so, for then, as in our times, Sins
ever were most plentiful--their traffic was in crimes; And as each
man who pardon sought, became the Church's debtor, Each wicked deed
their store would feed, the worse it was the better.

For they'd a regular tariff, as we've Sir Robert Peel's, Stating so much for him who "lies, swears,
murders, stabs, or steals;" And p'rhaps a thousand items more, as "not attending mass," "Ogling
the girls," "neglecting shrift," and others we'll let pass.

However, all a duty paid for priestly absolution, According to the culprit's sex, rank, purse,
or constitution. Such was the pleasant state of things, some centuries ago, With holy men throughout
the land and jolly Father Joe.

"A round, fat, oily man of God," as ever sang a psalm, Or closed a penitential fee devoutly in
his palm, Was Father Joe; and he also, when psalms and prayers were done, In festive scene, with smile
serene, aye cheerfully made one.

Fond of a jest, he'd do his best good-humour to provoke, Fill up his
glass, extol some lass, and crack some convent joke; Nor heed the
frown or looks cast down of atrabilious friars, Till his gills grew
red, and his laughing head look'd a rose amid the briers.

Right well
he knew each roast and stew, and chose the choicest dishes, And the
bill of fare, as well as prayer, with its venison, game, and fishes;
Were he living now he might, I vow, with his culinary knowledge, Have
writ a book, or been a cook, or fellow of a college.

In those old
days the wealthy knew such qualities to prize, And our good priest
much favour found in lords' and ladies' eyes; For seldom in their
ancient halls a sumptuous feast was dressing, But Father Joe that
way would go thereon to "ask a blessing." As he neared Cheyne Row, he saw in front of him the figure of a man leaning over
the low stone wall, with his face buried in his hands. On hearing his approaching footsteps
the man lifted himself up, turned round, and preceded him along the pavement with a sort of
listless stride which seemed to Henley strangely familiar. He hastened his steps, and on coming
closer recognised that the man was Trenchard; but, just as he was about to hail him, Trenchard
crossed the road to one of the houses opposite, inserted a key in the door, and disappeared
within, shutting the door behind him.

Henley paused a moment opposite to the house. It was of a dull red colour, and had a few creepers
straggling helplessly about it, looking like a torn veil that can only partially conceal a
dull, heavy face.

"Andrew seems at home here," he thought, gazing up at the blind, tall windows, which showed
no ray of light. "I wonder----"

And then, still gazing at the windows, he recalled the description of the house where Olive
Beauchamp lived in their book.

"He took it from this," Henley said to himself. Yes, that was obvious. Trenchard had described
the prison-house of despair, where the two victims of a strange, desolating habit shut themselves
up to sink, with a curious minuteness. He had even devoted a paragraph to the tall iron gate,
whose round handle he had written of as "bald, and exposed to the wind from the river, the
paint having long since been worn off it." In the twilight Henley bent down and examined the
handle of the gate. The paint seemed to have been scraped from it.

"How curiously real that book has become to me!" he muttered. "I could almost believe that
if I knocked upon that door, and was let in, I should find Olive Beauchamp stretched on a couch
in the room that lies beyond those gaunt, shuttered windows."

He gave a last glance at the house, and as he did so he fancied that he heard a slight cry
come from it to him. He listened attentively and heard nothing more. Then he walked away toward
home.

When he reached his room, he found upon his table the envelope which Trenchard had directed
to him. He opened it, and unwrapped the key from the inclosed sheet of note-paper, on which
were written these words:

     "Dear Jack,

     "I am off again. And this time I can't say when I shall be
     back. In any case, I have completed my part of the book, and
     leave the finishing of it in your hands. This is the key of
     the drawer in which I have locked the manuscript. You have
     not seen most of the last volume. Read it, and judge for
     yourself whether the dénouement can be anything but
     utterly tragic. I will not outline to you what I have
     thought of for it. If you have any difficulty about the
     finale, I shall be able to help you with it even if you do
     not see me again for some time. By the way, what nonsense
     that saying is, 'Dead men tell no tales!' Half the best
     tales in the world are told, or at least completed, by dead
     men.

    "Yours ever,

     "A. T."

Henley laid this note down and turned cold all over. It was the concluding sentence which had
struck a chill through his heart. He took the key in his hand, went down to Trenchard's room,
unlocked the drawer in his writing-table, and took out the manuscript. What did Andrew mean
by that sinister sentence? A tale completed by a dead man! Henley sat down by the fire with
the manuscript in his hands and began to read. He was called away to dinner; but immediately
afterward he returned to his task, and till late into the night his glance travelled down the
closely-written sheets one after the other, until the light from the candles grew blurred and
indistinct, and his eyes ached. But still he read on. The power and gloom of Andrew's narrative
held him in a vice, and then he was searching for a clue in the labyrinth of words. At last
he came to the final paragraph, and then to the final sentence:

"But at length he laid his hand upon the door that divided him from Fate."

Henley put the sheet down carefully upon the table. It was three o'clock in the morning, and
the room seemed full of a strange, breathless cold, the peculiar chilliness that precedes the
dawn. The fire was burning brightly enough, yet the warmth it emitted scarcely seemed to combat
the frosty air that penetrated from without, and Henley shivered as he rose from his seat.
His brows were drawn together, and he was thinking deeply. A light seemed slowly struggling
into his soul. That last sentence of Tren-chard's connected itself with what he had seen in
the afternoon on the Chelsea Embankment. "He laid his hand upon the door that divided him from
Fate." 

Query: Which reading is the correct one? Coleridge refers to the Manchester Philosophical Transactions
for a description of this phenomenon; but, as the earlier volumes of these are scarce, perhaps
some of your correspondents would copy the description from the volume which contains it, or
furnish one from some authentic source.

MINOR QUERIES.

Cann Family.--Can any of your correspondents enlighten
me as to the origin of this family name; and if of foreign extraction,
as I suspect, in what county of England they first settled? There
is a village in Dorsetshire called Cann St. Rumbold. Possibly this
may afford some clue.

At last, when it was dawn, he went up to bed tired out, after leaving a written direction to
the servant not to call him in the morning. When he awoke and looked at his watch it was past
two o'clock in the afternoon. He sprang out of bed, dressed, and after a hasty meal, half breakfast,
half lunch, set out towards Chelsea. The day was bright and cold. The sun shone on the river
and sparkled on the windows of the houses on the Embankment. Many people were about, and they
looked cheerful. The weight of depression that had settled upon Henley was lifted. He thought
of the strange, yet illuminating, idea that had occurred to him in the night, and now, in broad
daylight, it seemed clothed in absurdity. He laughed at it. Yet he quickened his steps toward
the red house with the tarnished iron gate and the tattered creepers.

But long before he reached it he met a boy sauntering along the thoroughfare and shouting newspapers.
He sang out unflinchingly in the gay sunshine, "Murder! Murder!" and between his shouts he
whistled a music-hall song gaily in snatches. Henley stopped him and bought a paper. He opened
the paper in the wind, which seemed striving to prevent him, and cast his eyes over the middle
pages. Then suddenly he dropped it to the ground with a white face, and falteringly signed
to a cabman. The dénouement was written. The previous night, in a house on the Chelsea Embankment,
a woman had been done to death, and the murderer had crept out and thrown himself into the
gray, hurrying river.

The woman's name was Olive Beauchamp.

THE END.
