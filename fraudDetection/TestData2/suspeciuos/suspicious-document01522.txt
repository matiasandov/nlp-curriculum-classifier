Next came Sandy--merry of heart--a humpback laddie from Aberdeen.  His parents had gone down
with the steerage of a great ocean liner, and society had cared for him until the first horror
of the tragedy had passed; then some one fortunately had mentioned Saint Margaret's, and society
was relieved of its burden.  In the year he had spent here his Aberdonian burr had softened
somewhat and a number of American colloquialisms had crept into his speech; but for all that
he was "the braw canny Scot"--as the House Surgeon always termed him--and he objected to kisses.
So the good-morning greeting was a hearty hand-shake between the two--comrade fashion.

"It wad be a bonnie day i' Aberdeen," he reminded her, blithely.  "But 'tis no the robins there
'at wad be singin'."

"Shall I guess?"

"Na, I'll tell ye.  Laverocks!"

"Really, Sandy?"  And then she suddenly remembered something.  "Now you guess what you're going
to have for supper to-night."

"Porridge?"

"No; scones!"

"Bully!"  And Sandy clapped his hands ecstatically.

Beside Sandy lay Susan--smart, shrewd, and American, with braced legs and back, and a philosophy
that failed her only on Trustee Days.  But as calendars are not kept in Ward C no one knew
what this day was; and consequently Susan was grinning all over her pinched, gnome-like little
face.  Margaret MacLean kissed her on both cheeks; the Susan-kind hunger for affection, but
the world rarely finds it out and therefore gives sparingly.

"Guess yer couldn't guess what I dreamt last night, Miss Peggie?"

"About the aunt?"  This was a mythical relation of Susan's who lived somewhere and who was
supposed to turn up some day and claim Susan with open arms.  She was the source of many dreams
and of much interested conversation and heated argument in the ward, and the children had her
pictured down to the smallest detail of person and clothes.

"No, 'tain't my aunt this time.  I dreamt you was gettin' married, Miss Peggie."  And Susan
giggled delightedly.

"An' goin' away?"  This was groaned out in chorus from the two cots following Susan's, wherein
lay James and John--fellow-Apostles of pain--bound closely together in that spiritual brotherhood.
They were sitting up, holding hands and staring at Margaret with wide, anguish-filled eyes.

"Of course I'm not going away, little brothers; and I'm not going to get married.  Does any
one ever get married in Saint Margaret's?"

The Apostles thought very hard about it for a moment; but as it had never happened before,
of course it never would now, and Miss Peggie was safe.

The whole ward smiled again.  But in that moment Margaret MacLean remembered what the House
Surgeon had said, and wondered.  Was she building up for them an ultimate discontent in trying
to make life happy and full for them now?  Could not minds like theirs be taught to walk alone,
after all?  And then she laughed to herself for worrying. Why should the children ever have
to do without her--unless--unless something came to them far better--like Susan's mythical
aunt?  The children need never leave Saint Margaret's as long as they lived, and she never
should; and she passed on to the next cot, content that all was well.

As she stooped over the bed a pair of thin little arms flew out and clasped themselves tightly
about her neck; a head with a shock of red curls buried itself in the folds of the gray uniform.
This was Bridget--daughter of the Irish sod, oldest of the ward, general caretaker and best
beloved; although it should be added in justice to both Bridget and Margaret MacLean that the
former had no consciousness of it, and the latter took great care to hide it.

It was Bridget who read to the others when no one else could; it was Bridget who remembered
some wonderful story to tell on those days when Sandy's back was particularly bad or the Apostles
grew over-despondent; and it was Bridget who laughed and sang on the gray days when the sun
refused to be cheery.  Undoubtedly it was because of all these things that her cot was in the
center of Ward C.

Concerning Bridget herself, hers was a case of arsenical poisoning, slowly absorbed while winding
daisy-stems for an East Broadway manufacturer of cheap artificial flowers.  She had done this
for three years--since she was five--thereby helping her mother to support themselves and two
younger children.  She was ten now and the Senior Surgeon had already reckoned her days.

In the shadow of Bridget's cot was Rosita's crib--Rosita being the youngest, the most sensitive,
and the most given to homesickness.  This last was undoubtedly due to the fact that she was
the only child in the incurable ward blessed in the matter of a home.  Her parents were honest-working
Italians who adored her, but who were too ignorant and indulgent to keep her alive.  They came
every Sunday, and sat out the allotted time for visitors beside her crib, while the other children
watched in a silent, hungry-eyed fashion.

Margaret MacLean passed her with a kiss and went on to Peter--Peter--seven years old--congenital
hip disease--and all boy.

"Hello, you!" he shouted, squirming under the kiss that he would not have missed for anything.

"Hello, you!" answered back the administering nurse, and then she asked, solemnly, "How's Toby?"

"He's--he's fine.  That soap the House Surgeon give me cured his fleas all up."

Toby was even more mythical than Susan's aunt; she was based on certain authentic facts, whereas
Toby was solely the creation of a dog-adoring little brain.  But no one was ever inconsiderate
enough to hint at his airy fabrication; and Margaret MacLean always inquired after him every
morning with the same interest that she bestowed on the other occupants of Ward C.

Last in the ward came Michael, a diminutive Russian exile with valvular heart trouble and a
most atrocious vocabulary.  The one seemed as incurable as the other.  Margaret MacLean had
wrestled with the vocabulary on memorable occasions--to no avail; and although she had long
since discovered it was a matter of words and not meanings with him, it troubled her none the
less.  And because Michael came the nearest to being the black sheep of this sanitary fold
she showed for him always an unfailing gentleness.

"Good morning, dear," she said, running her fingers through the perpendicular curls that bristled
continuously.

"Goot mornun, tear," he mimicked, mischievously; and then he added, with an irresistible smile,
"Und Got-tam-you."

"Oh, Michael, don't you remember, the next time you were going to say 'God bless you'?"

"Awright--next time."

Margaret MacLean sighed unconsciously.  Michael's "next time" was about as reliable as the
South American mañana; and he seemed as much an alien now as the day he was brought into the
ward.  And then, because she believed that kindness was the strongest weapon for victory in
the end, she did the thing Michael loved best.

Ward C was turned into a circus menagerie, and Margaret MacLean and her assistant were turned
into keepers.  Together they set about the duties for the day with great good-humor.  Two seals,
a wriggling hippopotamus, a roaring polar bear, a sea-serpent of surprising activities, two
teeth-grinding alligators, a walrus, and a baby elephant were bathed with considerable difficulty
and excitement.  It was Sandy who insisted on being the elephant in spite of a heated argument
from the other animals that, having a hump, he ought to be a camel.  They forgave him later,
however, when he squirted forth his tooth-brush water and trumpeted triumphantly, thereby causing
the entire menagerie to squirm about and bellow in great glee.

At this point the head keeper had to turn them all back instantly into children, and she delivered
a firm but gentle lecture on the inconsiderateness of soaking a freshly changed bed.

Sandy broke into penitent tears; and because tears were never allowed to dampen the atmosphere
of Ward C when they could possibly be dammed, Margaret MacLean did the "best-of-all-things."
She pushed the cribs and cots all together into a "special" with observation-cars; then, changing
into an engineer, and with a call to Toby to jump aboard, she swung herself into the caboose-rocker
and opened the throttle.  The bell rang; the whistle tooted; and the engine gave a final snort
and puff, bounding away countryward where spring had come.

Those of you who live where you can always look out on pleasant places, or who can travel at
will into them, may find it hard to understand how wearisome and stupid it grows to be always
in one room with an encompassing sky-line of roof-tops and chimneys, or may fail to sound the
full depths of wonder and delight over the ride that Ward C took that memorable day.

The engineer pointed out everything--meadows full of flowers, trees full of birds, gardens
new planted, and corn-fields guarded by scarecrows.  She slowed up at the barnyards that the
children might hear the crowing cocks and clucking hens with their new-hatched broods, and
see the neighboring pastures with their flocks of sheep and tiny lambs.

"A ken them weel--hoo the wee creepits bleeted hame i' Aberdeen!" shouted Sandy, bleeting for
the whole pastureful.

And when they came to the smallest of mountain brooks the engineer followed it, down, down,
until it had grown into a stream with cowslipped banks; and on and on until it had grown into
a river with little boats and sandy shore and leaping fish.  Here the engineer stopped the
train; and every one who wanted to--and there were none who did not--went paddling; and some
went splashing about just as if they could swim.

Back in the "special," they climbed a hilltop, slowly, so that the engineer could point out
each farm and pasture and stream in miniature that they had seen close by. 

The garden is behind, washed by a fine branch of the river, which encircles a wild and thickly wooded
island, and on every side new and interesting prospects appear. The river is a mile across,
and of great depth, and, for the same distance above the Falls, is
one sheet of foam.

We sauntered down in the evening to the river side, and the rapids lost nothing by a closer inspection.
My bedroom looked directly upon them; I could watch the smoke of
the Fall, as I lay on my pillow; and with the wild roar of the cataract
sounding in my ears, I closed my first day at Niagara.

The following morning proved fine, and we devoted the forenoon, of course, to the Falls. Lake
Erie had just broken up, and the icebergs came crushing down the
rapids, in a way highly interesting.

My friends being quite at home in all the mazes of the river side, conducted me by a wild and
rugged route to the edge of the Table-rock, when, upon emerging from
a tangled brake, I beheld the Horse-shoe or great British Fall, pouring
down its volume of ice and water, at the distance of a few feet from
where we stood.

The rock felt to me as though it vibrated, and a large mass did in fact lately give way, soon
after a party had retired from the precarious stance. It is limestone, full of ugly fissures
and rents. A narrow wooden staircase conducts adventurous travellers to the bottom of the Fall,
where a sort of entrance is generally effected to a short distance under the sheet, and for
which performance a certificate in due form is served out.

The stair was at this time under repair, and the accumulation of
ice below perfectly reconciled me to wave pretensions to such slippery
honours.

At some distance below the Fall, and opposite to the American staircase, there is a ferry,
to which a safe and most romantic carriage-road has been lately formed,
out of the solid rock, at no small labour and expense.

When a similar accommodation shall have been provided upon the American side, it is expected
to prove a lucrative concern, but at the present foot-passengers only can be landed in the
States. The little skiff had just put off, with a party from the Canada shores, and got involved
in streams of ice, in a way somewhat hazardous, and which rendered it impossible for the boatmen
to return. The scene from the ferry is indeed magnificent, the Horseshoe, the American Fall, and
Goat Island being all in view, with the great pool or basin eddying
in fearful and endless turmoil.

In the evening I walked up the river side towards the village of
Chippeway, to visit a natural curiosity upon Mr. C.'s estate.

A spring surcharged with sulphuretted hydrogen gas rises within a
few paces of the river.

A small building is erected over it, and when a candle is applied to a tube in a barrel, which
encloses the spring, a brilliant and powerful light is evolved.

Close adjoining are the remains of extensive mills burnt by the Americans during last war.

The nurse nodded.

"Then all I have to say is that I consider it an extremely idiotic performance which had better
be stopped.  Children should not be indulged."

And he went away muttering something about the poor always remaining poor with their foolish
notions of throwing away money; and Margaret MacLean went back to the book of faery-tales.
But as she was looking for the place Sandy grunted forth stubbornly:

"A'm no wantin' ony scones the nicht, so ye maun na fetch them."

And Peter piped out, "Trusterday, ain't it, Miss Peggie?"

"Yes, dear.  Now shall we go on with the story?"

She had read to where the rat was demanding the passport when she recognized the President's
step outside the door.  In another moment he was standing beside her chair, looking at the
book on her knee.

"Humph! faery-tales!  Is that not very foolish?  Don't you think, Miss Margaret, it would be
more suitable to their condition in life if you should select--hmm--something like Pilgrim's
Progress or Lives of the Saints and Martyrs?  Something that would be a preparation--so to
speak--for the future."  He stood facing her now, his back to the children.

"Excuse me"--she was smiling up at him--"but I thought this was a better preparation."

The President frowned.  He was a much-tried man--a man of charitable parts, who directed or
presided over thirty organizations.  It took him nearly thirty days each month--with the help
of two private secretaries and a luxurious office--to properly attend to all the work resulting
therefrom; and the matters in hand were often so trying and perplexing that he had to go abroad
every other year to avoid a nervous breakdown.

"I think we took up this matter at one of the business meetings," he went on, patiently, "and
some arrangement was made for one of the trustees to come and read the Bible and teach the
children their respective creeds and catechisms."

Margaret MacLean nodded.  "There was; Miss N----"--and she named the Youngest and Prettiest
Trustee--"generally comes an hour before the meeting and reads to them; but to-day she was
detained by a--tango tea, I believe.  That's why I chose this."  Her eyes danced unconsciously
as she tapped the book.

The President looked at her sharply.  "I should think, my dear young lady, that you, of all
persons, would realize what a very serious thing life is to any one in this condition.  Instead
of that I fear at times that you are--shall I say--flippant?"  He turned about and looked at
the children.  "How do you do?" he asked, kindly.

"Thank you, sir, we are very well, sir," they chorused in reply.  Saint Margaret's was never
found wanting in politeness.

The President left; and the nurse in charge of Ward C went on with the reading.

A group filled the doorway; it was the voice of the Oldest Trustee that floated in.  "This,
my dear, is the incurable ward; we are very much interested in it."

They stood just over the threshold--the Oldest Trustee in advance, her figure commanding and
unbent, for all her seventy years, and her lorgnette raised.  As she was speaking a little
gray wisp of a woman detached herself from the group and moved slowly down the row of cots.

"Yes," continued the Oldest Trustee, "we have two cases of congenital hip disease and three
of spinal tuberculosis--that is one of them in the second crib."  Her eyes moved on from Sandy
to Rosita.  "And the fifth patient has such a dreadful case of rheumatism.  Sad, isn't it,
in so young a child?  Yes, the Senior Surgeon says it is absolutely incurable."

Margaret MacLean closed the book with a bang; for five minutes the children had been looking
straight ahead with big, conscious eyes, hearing not a word.  Rebellion gripped at her heart
and she rose quickly and went over to the group.

"Wouldn't you like to come in and talk to the children?  They are rather sober this afternoon;
perhaps you could make them laugh."

"Yes, wouldn't you like to go in?" put in the Oldest Trustee.  "They are very nice children."

But the visitors shrank back an almost infinitesimal distance; and one said, hesitatingly:

"I'm afraid we wouldn't know quite what to say to them."

"Perhaps you would like to see the new pictures for the nurses' room?" the nurse in charge
suggested, wistfully.

The Oldest Trustee glanced at her with a hint of annoyance.  "We have already seen them.  I
think you must have forgotten, my dear, that it was I who gave them."

With flashing cheeks Margaret MacLean fled from Ward C.  If she had stayed long enough to watch
the little gray wisp of a woman move quietly from cot to cot, patting each small hand and asking,
tenderly, "And what is your name, dearie?" she might have carried with her a happier feeling.
At the door of the board-room she ran into the House Surgeon.

"Is it as bad as all that?" he asked after one good look at her.

"It's worse--a hundred times worse!"  She tossed her head angrily.  "Do you know what is going
to happen some day?  I shall forget who I am--and who they are and what they have done for
me--and say things they will never forgive.  My mind-string will just snap, that's all; and
every little pestering, forbidden thought that has been kicking its heels against self-control
and sense-of-duty all these years will come tumbling out and slip off the edge of my tongue
before I even know it is there."

"They are some hot little thoughts, I wager," laughed the House Surgeon.

And then, from the far end of the cross-corridor, came the voice of the Oldest Trustee, talking
to the group:

". . . such a very sweet girl--never forgets her place or her duty. She was brought here from
the Foundling Asylum when she was a baby, in almost a dying condition.  Every one thought it
was an incurable case; the doctors still shake their heads over her miraculous recovery.  Of
course it took years; and she grew up in the hospital."

With a look of dumb, battling anger the nurse in charge of Ward C turned from the House Surgeon--her
hands clenched--while the voice of the Oldest Trustee came back to them, still exhibiting:

"No, we have never been able to find out anything about her parentage; undoubtedly she was
abandoned.  We named her 'Margaret MacLean,' after the hospital and the superintendent who
was here then.  Yes, indeed--a very, very sad--"

When the Oldest Trustee reached the boardroom it was empty, barring the primroses, which were
guilelessly nodding in the green Devonshire bowl on the President's desk.

IV

CURABLES AND INCURABLES

No one who entered the board-room that late afternoon remembered that it was May Eve; and even
had he remembered, it would have amounted to nothing more than the mental process of association.
It would not have given him the faintest presentiment that at that very moment the Little People
were busy pressing their cloth-o'-dream mantles and reblocking their wishing-caps; that the
instant the sun went down the spell would be off the faery raths, setting them free all over
the world, and that the gates of Tir-na-n'Og would be open wide for mortals to wander back
again.  No, not one of the board remembered; the trustees sat looking straight at the primroses
and saw nothing, felt nothing, guessed nothing.

They were not unusual types of trustees who served on the board of Saint Margaret's.  You could
find one or more of them duplicated in the directors' book of nearly any charitable institution,
if you hunted for them; the strange part was, perhaps, that they were gathered together in
a single unit of power.  Besides the Oldest and the Meanest Trustees, there were the Executive,
the Social, the Disagreeable, the Busiest, the Dominating, the Calculating, the Petty, and
the Youngest and Prettiest.  She came fluttering in a minute late from her tea; and right after
her came the little gray wisp of a woman, who sat down in a chair by the door so unpretentiously
as to make it appear as though she did not belong among them.  When the others saw her they
nodded distantly: they had just been talking about her.

It seemed that she was the widow of the Richest Trustee.  The board had elected her to fill
her husband's place lest the annual check of ten thousand--a necessary item on Saint Margaret's
books--might not be forthcoming; and this was her first meeting.  It was, in fact, her first
visit to the hospital.  She could never bear to come during her husband's trusteeship because,
children having been denied her, she had wished to avoid them wherever and whenever she could,
and spare herself the pain their suggestion always brought her.  She would not have come now,
but that her husband's memory seemed to require it of her.

For years gossip had been busy with the wife of the Richest Trustee--as the widow she did not
relax her hold.  What the trustees said that day they only repeated from gossip: the little
gray wisp of a woman was a nonentity--nothing more--with the spirit of a mouse.  She held no
position in society, and what she did with her time or her money no one knew.  The trustees
smiled inwardly and reckoned silently with themselves; at least they would never need to fear
opposition from her on any matter of importance.

The last person of all to enter the boardroom was the Senior Surgeon. The President had evidently
waited for him, for he nodded to the House Surgeon to close the doors the moment he came.

Now the Senior Surgeon was a man who used capitals for Surgery, Science, and Self, unconsciously
eliminating them elsewhere.  He had begun in Saint Margaret's as house surgeon; and he had
grown to be considered by many of his own profession the leading man of his day. The trustees
were as proud of him as they were of the hospital, and it has never been recorded in the traditions
of Saint Margaret's that the Senior Surgeon had ever asked for anything that went ungranted.
He seldom attended a board meeting; consequently when he came in at five-thirty there was an
audible rustle of excitement and the raising of anticipatory eyebrows.

When the President called the meeting to order every trustee was present, as well as the heads
of the four wards, the Superintendent, and the two surgeons.  The Senior Surgeon sat next to
the President; the House Surgeon sat where he could watch equally well the profiles of the
Youngest and Prettiest Trustee and Margaret MacLean.  His heart had always been inclined to
intermit; or--as he put it to himself--he adored them both in quite opposite ways; and which
way was the better and more endurable he had never been able to decide.

"In view of the fact," said the President, rising, "that the Senior Surgeon can be with us
but a short time this afternoon, and that he has a grave and vital issue to present to you,
we will postpone the regular reports until the end of the meeting and take up at once the business
in hand."  He paused a moment, feeling the dramatic value of his next remark.  "For some time
the Senior Surgeon has seriously questioned the--hmm--advisability of continuing the incurable
ward.  He wishes very much to bring the matter before you, and he is prepared to give you his
reasons for so doing.  Afterward, I think it would be wise for us to discuss the matter very
informally."  He bowed to the Senior Surgeon and sat down.

The Meanest Trustee snapped his teeth together in an expression of grim satisfaction.  "That
ward is costing a lot of unnecessary expense, I think," he barked out, sharply, "and it's being
run with altogether too free a hand."  And he looked meaningly toward Margaret MacLean.

No one paid any particular attention to his remark; they were too deeply engrossed in the Senior
Surgeon.  And the House Surgeon, watching, saw the profile of the Youngest and Prettiest Trustee
become even prettier as it blushed and turned in witching eagerness toward the man who was
rising to address the meeting.  The other profile had turned rigid and white as a piece of marble.

Now the Senior Surgeon could do a critical major operation in twenty minutes; and he could
operate on critical issues quite as rapidly. Speed was his creed; therefore he characteristically
attacked the subject in hand without any prefatory remarks.

"Ladies and gentlemen of the board, the incurable ward is doing nothing.  I can see no possible
reason or opportunity for further observation or experimentation there.  Every case in it at
the present time, as well as every Case that is likely to come to us, is as a sealed document
as far as science is concerned. From the increasing facility of migrating now-a-days even from one
end of the world to another, Niagara has lost somewhat of that mysterious
halo with which it was wont to be enveloped; but still it must ever
be Niagara.

The most eloquent descriptions, I should think, must prove inadequate
to convey a just conception of the scene.

Nor can the pencil, I imagine, ever do it justice.

A cataract may be said, as regards the painter's art, to differ from
all other objects in nature.

  Because it happened
once--here in this hospital--is no reason for believing that it will ever happen again."

"Oh yes, it is!" persisted Margaret MacLean.  "There is just as much reason for believing as
for not believing.  Every one of those children, in the ward now might--yes, they might--be
a case in a thousand; and no one has any right to take that thousandth of a chance away from them."

"You are talking nonsense--stupid, irrational nonsense."  And the Senior Surgeon glared at her.
