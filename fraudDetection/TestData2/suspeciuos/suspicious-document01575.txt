Other well-adapted early determinates such as Oregon Spring and Santiam may disappoint you.
Unless fertigated, they'll set and ripen some fruit but may become stunted in midsummer. However,
a single indeterminate Fantastic Hybrid will cover a 6-to 7-foot-diameter circle, and grow
and ripen tomatoes until frost with only a minimum of water. I think Stupice (ABL, TSC) and
Early Cascade are also quite workable (and earlier than Fantastic in Washington).

My Own Garden Plan

This chapter illustrates and explains my own dry garden. Any garden plan is a product of compromises
and preferences; mine is not intended to become yours. But, all modesty aside, this plan results
from 20 continuous years of serious vegetable gardening and some small degree of regional wisdom.

My wife and I are what I dub "vegetablitarians." Not vegetarians, or lacto-ovo vegetarians
because we're not ideologues and eat meat on rare, usually festive occasions in other peoples'
houses. But over 80 percent of our calories are from vegetable, fruit, or cereal sources and
the remaining percentage is from fats or dairy foods. The purpose of my garden is to provide
at least half the actual calories we eat year-round; most of the rest comes from home-baked
bread made with freshly ground whole grains. I put at least one very large bowl of salad on
the table every day, winter and summer. I keep us in potatoes nine months a year and produce
a year's supply of onions or leeks. To break the dietary monotony of November to April, I grow
as wide an assortment of winter vegetables as possible and put most produce departments to
shame from June through September, when the summer vegies are "on."

The garden plan may seem unusually large, but in accordance with Solomon's First Law of Abundance,
there's a great deal of intentional waste. My garden produces two to three times the amount
of food needed during the year so moochers, poachers, guests, adult daughters accompanied by
partners, husbands, and children, mistakes, poor yields, and failures of individual vegetables
are inconsequential. Besides, gardening is fun.

My garden is laid out in 125-foot-long rows and one equally long raised bed. Each row grows
only one or two types of vegetables. The central focus of my water-wise garden is its irrigation
system. Two lines of low-angle sprinklers, only 4 feet apart, straddle an intensively irrigated
raised bed running down the center of the garden. The sprinklers I use are Naans, a unique
Israeli design that emits very little water and throws at a very low angle (available from
TSC and some garden centers). Their maximum reach is about 18 feet; each sprinkler is about
12 feet from its neighbor. On the garden plan, the sprinklers are indicated by a circle surrounding
an "X." Readers unfamiliar with sprinkler system design are advised to study the irrigation
chapter in Growing Vegetables West of the Cascades.

On the far left side of the garden plan is a graphic representation of the uneven application
of water put down by this sprinkler system. The 4-foot-wide raised bed gets lots of water,
uniformly distributed. Farther away, the amount applied decreases rapidly. About half as much
irrigation lands only 6 feet from the edge of the raised bed as on the bed itself. Beyond that
the amount tapers off to insignificance. During summer's heat the farthest 6 feet is barely
moistened on top, but no water effectively penetrates the dry surface. Crops are positioned
according to their need for or ability to benefit from supplementation. For convenient description
I've numbered those rows.

The Raised Bed

Crops demanding the most water are grown on the raised bed. These include a succession of lettuce
plantings designed to fill the summer salad bowl, summer spinach, spring kohlrabi, my celery
patch, scallions, Chinese cabbages, radishes, and various nursery beds that start overwintered
crops for transplanting later. Perhaps the bed seems too large just for salad greens. But one
entire meal every day consists largely of fresh, raw, high-protein green leaves; during summer,
looseleaf or semiheading lettuce is our salad item of choice. And our individual salad bowls
are larger than most families of six might consider adequate to serve all of them together.

If water were severely rationed I could irrigate the raised bed with hose and nozzle and dry
garden the rest, but as it is, rows 1, 2, 7, and 8 do get significant but lesser amounts from
the sprinklers. Most of the rows hold a single plant family needing similar fertilization and
handling or, for convenience, that are sown at the same time.

Row 1

The row's center is about 3 feet from the edge of the raised bed. In March I sow my very first
salad greens down half this row--mostly assorted leaf lettuce plus some spinach--and six closely
spaced early Seneca Hybrid zucchini plants. The greens are all cut by mid-June; by mid-July
my better-quality Yellow Crookneck squash come on, so I pull the zucchini. Then I till that
entire row, refertilize, and sow half to rutabagas. The nursery bed of leek seedlings has gotten
large enough to transplant at this time, too. These go into a trench dug into the other half
of the row. The leeks and rutabagas could be reasonably productive located farther from the
sprinklers, but no vegetables benefit more from abundant water or are more important to a self-sufficient
kitchen. Rutabagas break the winter monotony of potatoes; leeks vitally improve winter salads,
and leeky soups are a household staple from November through March.

Row 2: Semi-Drought Tolerant Brassicas

Row 2 gets about half the irrigation of row 1 and about one-third as much as the raised bed,
and so is wider, to give the roots more room. One-third of the row grows savoy cabbage, the
rest, Brussels sprouts. These brassicas are spaced 4 feet apart and by summer's end the lusty
sprouts form a solid hedge 4 feet tall.

Row 3: Kale

Row 3 grows 125 feet of various kales sown in April. There's just enough overspray to keep
the plants from getting gnarly. I prefer kale to not get very stunted, if only for aesthetics:
on my soil, one vanity fertigation about mid-July keeps this row looking impressive all summer.
Other gardens with poorer soil might need more support. This much kale may seem an enormous
oversupply, but between salads and steaming greens with potatoes we manage to eat almost all
the tender small leaves it grows during winter.

Row 4: Root Crops

Mostly carrots, a few beets. No irrigation, no fertigation, none needed. One hundred carrots
weighing in at around 5 pounds each and 20-some beets of equal magnitude make our year's supply
for salads, soups, and a little juicing.

Row 5: Dry-Gardened Salads

This row holds a few crowns of French sorrel, a few feet of parsley. Over a dozen giant kohlrabi
are spring sown, but over half the row grows endive. I give this row absolutely no water. Again,
when contemplating the amount of space it takes, keep in mind that this endive and kohlrabi
must help fill our salad bowls from October through March.

Row 6: Peas, Overwintered Cauliflower, and All Solanaceae
