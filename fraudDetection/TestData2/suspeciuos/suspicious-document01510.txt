Burckhardt had seen Palmyra and Baalbek, the slopes of Lebanon and the valley of the Orontes,
Lake Huleh, and the sources of the Jordan; he had discovered many ancient sites; and his observations
had led especially to the discovery of the site of the far-famed Apamoea, although both he
and his publisher were mistaken in their application of the data obtained. His excursions in
the Auranitis were equally rich, even though coming after Seetzen's, in those geographical
and archæological details which represent the actual condition of a country, and throw a light
upon the comparative geography of every age.

Leaving Damascus in 1813, Burckhardt visited the Dead Sea, the valley of Akâba, and the ancient
port of Azcongater, districts which in our own day are traversed by parties of English, with
their Murray, Cook, or Bædeker in their hands; but which then were only to be visited at the
risk of life. In a lateral valley, the traveller came upon the ruins of Petra, the ancient
capital of Arabia Petræa.

At the end of the year Burckhardt was at Cairo. Judging it best not to join the caravan which
was just starting for Fezzan, he felt a great inclination to visit Nubia, a country rich in
attractions for the historian, geographer, and archæologist. Nubia, the cradle of Egyptian
civilization, had only been visited, since the days of the Portuguese Alvares, by Poncet and
Lenoir Duroule, both Frenchmen, at the close of the seventeenth century, at the opening of
the eighteenth by Bruce, whose narrative had so often been doubted, and by Norden, who had
not penetrated beyond Derr.

In 1813 Burckhardt explored Nubia proper, including Mahass and Kemijour. This expedition cost
him only forty-two francs, a very paltry sum in comparison with the price involved in the smallest
attempt at an African journey in our own day; but we must not forget that Burckhardt was content
to live upon millet-seed, and that his entire cortége consisted of two dromedaries.

Two Englishmen, Mr. Legh and Mr. Smelt, were travelling in the country at the same time, scattering
gold and presents as they passed, and thus rendering the visits of their successors costly.

Burckhardt crossed the cataracts of the Nile. "A little farther on," says the narrative, "near
a place called Djebel-Lamoule, the Arab guides practise a curious extortion." This is their
plan of proceeding. They halt, descend from their camels, and arrange a little heap of sand
and pebbles, in imitation of a Nubian tomb. This they, call "preparing the grave for the traveller"
and follow up the demonstration by an imperious demand for money. Burckhardt having watched
his guide commence this operation, began quietly to imitate him, and then said, "Here is thy
grave; as we are brothers, it is but fair that we should be buried together." The Arab could
not help laughing, both graves were simultaneously destroyed, and remounting the camels, the
cavalcade proceeded, better friends than before. The Arab quoted a saying from the Koran: "No
human being knows in what spot of the earth he will find his grave."

Burckhardt had hoped to get as far as Dingola, but was obliged to rest satisfied with collecting
information about the country and the Mamelukes, who had taken refuge there after the massacre
of their army by order of the viceroy of Egypt.

The attention of the traveller was frequently directed to the ruins of temples and ancient
cities, than which none are more curious than those of Isambul.

"The temple on the banks of the Nile is approached by an avenue flanked by six colossal figures,
which measure six feet and a half from the ground to the knees. They are representations of
Isis and Osiris, in various attitudes. The sides and capitals of the pillars are covered with
paintings or hieroglyphic carvings, in which Burckhardt thought a very ancient style was to
be traced. All these are hewn out of the rock, and the faces appear to have been painted yellow,
with black hair. Two hundred yards from this temple are the ruins of a still larger monument,
consisting of four enormous figures, so deeply buried in the sand that it is impossible to
say whether they are in a standing or sitting posture."

These descriptions of antiquities, which in our own day are accurately known by drawings and
photographs, have, however, little value for us; and are merely interesting as indicating the
state of the ruins when Burckhardt visited them, and enabling us to judge how far the depredations
of the Arabs have since changed them.

Burckhardt's first excursion was limited to the borders of the Nile, a narrow space made up
of little valleys, which debouched into the river. The traveller estimated the population of
the country at 100,000, distributed over a surface of fertile land 450 miles in length, by
a quarter of a mile in width.

"The men," says the narrative, "are, as a rule, muscular, rather shorter than the Egyptians,
having little beard or moustache, usually merely a pointed beard under the chin. I was as sure
of it;--oh, as sure of it as I am that I've got you now. And then it came;--like a great thunderclap."

"A
thunderclap, Mary!"
"Well;--yes. I wasn't quite sure at first. You might have been laughing
at me;--mightn't you?" Women share the same physical advantages, are pretty as a
rule, and well made; their appearance is gentle and pleasing, and they are modest in behaviour.
M. Denon has underrated the Nubians, but it must not be forgotten that their physique varies
in different districts. Where there is much land to cultivate, they are well developed; but
in districts where arable land is a mere strip, the people diminish in vigour, and are sometimes
walking skeletons."

The whole country groaned under the yoke of the Kashefs, who were descendants of the commander
of the Bosniacs, and paid only a small annual tribute to Egypt, which, however, was sufficient
to serve as a pretext for oppressing the unfortunate fellaheen. Burckhardt cites a curious
example of the insolence with which the Kashefs behaved.

"Hassan Kashef," he says, was in need of barley for his horses. Accompanied by his slaves,
he walked into the fields, and there met the owner of a fine plot of barley. "How badly you
cultivate your land," said he. "Here you plant barley in a field where you might have reaped
an excellent crop of water-melons of double the value. See, here are some melon-seeds (offering
a handful to the peasant proprietor); sow your field with these; and you, slaves, tear up this
bad barley and bring it to me."

In March, 1814, after a short rest, Burckhardt undertook a fresh exploration, not this time
of the banks of the Nile, but of the Nubian desert. Justly conceiving poverty to be his surest
safe guard, he dismissed his servant, sold his camel, and contenting himself with one ass,
joined a caravan of poor traders. Very little;--except that in the course of her bridal tour she
did gradually find words to give him a true and accurate account of all her own feelings from the
time at which he first asked her to walk with him across the bridge over the Dill and look
at the old place.

It would be useless to enumerate the names of the bridges, hills, and valleys in this desert.
We will rather summarize the traveller's report of the physical aspect of the country.

Bruce, who had explored it, paints it in too gloomy colours, and exaggerates the difficulties
of the route. If Burckhardt is to be credited, the country is less barren than that between
Aleppo and Bagdad, or Damascus and Medina. The Nubian desert is not merely a plain of sand,
where nothing interrupts the dreary monotony. It is interspersed with rocks, some not less
than 300 feet in height, and shaded by thickets of acacias or date-trees. The shelter of these
trees is, however, unavailing against the vertical rays of the sun, which explains an Arabic
proverb, "Rely upon the favour of the great and the shade of an acacia."

At Ankheyre, or Wady-Berber, the caravan reached the Nile, after passing Shigre, one of the
best mountain springs. One danger only is to be feared in crossing the desert; that of finding
the wells at Nedjeym dry; and, unless the traveller should lose his way, which, however, with
trustworthy guides, is little likely to happen, no serious obstacle arises.

It would appear, therefore, that the sufferings experienced by Bruce must have been greatly
exaggerated, although the narrative of the Scotch traveller is generally trustworthy. The natives
of the province of Berber appear to be identical with the Barbarins of Bruce, the Barabas mentioned
by D'Anville, and the Barauras spoken of by Poncet. They are a well-made race, and different
in feature from the negroes. They maintain their purity of descent by marrying only with the
women of their own or of kindred tribes. Curious as is the picture Burckhardt draws of the
character and manners of this tribe, it is not at all edifying. It would be difficult to convey
an idea of the corruption and degradation of the Berbers. The little town of Wady-Berber, a
commercial centre, the rendezvous for caravans, and a depôt for slaves, is a regular resort
of banditti.

Burckhardt, who had trusted to the protection of the merchants of Daraou, found that he had
made a great mistake in so doing. They sought every means of plundering him, chased him out
of their company, and forced him to seek refuge with the guides and donkey-drivers, who cordially
welcomed him.

Upon the 10th of April a fine was levied upon the caravan by the Mek of Damer, which lies a
little south of the tributary Mogren (called Mareb by Bruce). This is a well-kept and cleanly
Fakir village, which contrasts agreeably with the ruins and filth of Berber. The Fakirs give
themselves up to the practices of sorcery, magic, and charlatanism. One of them, it is said,
could even make a lamb bleat in the stomach of the man who had stolen and eaten it! These ignorant
people have entire faith in such fables, and it must be reluctantly admitted that the fact
contributes not a little to the peace of the town and the prosperity of the country.

From Damer, Burckhardt proceeded to Shendy, where he passed a month, during which time no one
suspected him to be an infidel. Shendy had grown in importance since Bruce's visit, and now
consisted of about a thousand houses. Considerable trade was carried on--grass, slaves, and
cattle taking the place of specie. The principal marketable commodities were gum, ivory, gold,
and ostrich feathers.

According to Burckhardt, the number of slaves sold yearly at Shendy amounts to 5000; 2500 of
these are for Arabia, 400 for Egypt, 1000 for Dongola and the districts of the Red Sea.

The traveller employed his time during his stay at Sennaar in collecting information about
that kingdom. Amongst other curious things, he was told that the king having one day invited
the ambassador of Mehemet Ali to a cavalry review, which he considered rather formidable, the
envoy in his turn begged the king to witness part of the Turkish artillery exercises. But at
the outset of the performance--at the discharge of two small mounted guns--cavalry, infantry,
spectators, courtiers, and the king himself, fled in terror.

Burckhardt sold his wares, and then, worn out by the persecutions of the Egyptian merchants
who were his companions, he joined the caravan at Suakin, intending to traverse the unknown
district between that town and Shendy. From Suakin he meant to set out for Mecca, hoping to
find the Hadji useful to him in the realization of his projects.

"The Hadji," he says, "form one powerful body, and every member is protected, because if one
is attacked the whole number take up arms." The caravan which Burckhardt now joined consisted
of 150 merchants and 300 slaves. Two hundred camels were employed to convey heavy bales of
"danmour," a stuff manufactured in Sennaar, and cargoes of tobacco.

The first object of interest to the travellers was the Atbara, a tributary of the Nile, whose
banks, with their verdant trees, were grateful to the eye after the sandy desert. The course
of the river was followed as far as the fertile district of Taka. During the journey the white
skin of the pretended sheik Ibrahim (it will be remembered that this was the name assumed by
Burckhardt) attracted much attention from the female population, who were little accustomed
to the sight of Arabs.

"One day," relates the traveller, "a girl of the country, of whom I had been buying onions,
offered to give me an extra quantity if I would remove my turban, and show her my head. I demanded
eight more onions, which she immediately produced. As I removed my turban, and exposed my white
and close-shaven head to view, she sprang back in horror and dismay. I asked her jokingly if
she would not like a husband with a similar head, to which she replied with much energy, and
many expressions of disgust, that she would prefer the ugliest slave ever brought from Darfur."

Just before Goz Radjeh was reached, Burckhardt's attention was attracted to a building, which
he was told was either a church or temple, the same word having the two meanings. He at once
proceeded in that direction, hoping to examine it, but his companions stopped him, saying,
"It is surrounded by bands of robbers; you cannot go a hundred steps without danger of attack."

Burckhardt was unable to decide whether it was an Egyptian temple, or a monument of the empire
of Axum.

At last the caravan entered the fertile district of Tak or El Gasch, a wide watered plain,
whose soil is wonderfully fertile, but which for two months in the year is uninhabited. Grain
is plentiful and is sold in Jeddah for twenty per cent. more than the best Egyptian millet.

The inhabitants, who are called Hadendoa, are treacherous, dishonest, and bloodthirsty; and
their women are almost as degraded as those of Shendy and Berber.

Upon leaving Taka, the road to Suakin and the shores of the Red Sea lay over a chain of chalk
hills. At Schenterab granite is found. The hills presented few difficulties, and the caravan
reached Suakin in safety upon the 26th May. But Burckhardt's troubles were not yet at an end.
The Emir and Aga combined to plunder him, and treated him as the lowest of slaves, until he
produced the firman which he had received from Mehemet Ali and Ibrahim Pasha. This changed
the face of affairs. Instead of being thrown into prison the traveller was invited to the Aga's,
who offered him a present of a young slave. M. Vivien de Saint Martin writes of this expedition,
"This journey of from twenty to twenty-five days, between the Nile and the Red Sea, was the
first ever undertaken by a European. The observations collected, as to the settled or nomad
tribes of these districts are invaluable for Europe. Burckhardt's narrative is of increasing
interest, and few can compare with it for instruction and interest."

Upon the 7th of July Burckhardt succeeded in embarking in a boat, and eleven days later he
reached Jeddah, which serves as a harbour to Mecca. Jeddah is built upon the sea-shore, and
is surrounded by a wall, which, insufficient as it would be against artillery, protects it
perfectly from the attacks of the Wahabees, who have been nicknamed the "Puritans of Islamism."
These people are a distinct sect, who claim to restore Mahomedanism to its primitive simplicity.

"The entrance to the town, upon the side nearest the sea," says Burckhardt, "is protected by
a battery which overlooks the entire fort, and is surmounted by one enormous piece of artillery
capable of discharging a five-hundred pound shot, which is so renowned throughout the Arabian
Gulf, that its reputation alone is enough to protect Jeddah."

The greatest drawback to this city is its want of fresh water, which is brought from small
wells two miles distant. Without gardens, vegetables, or date-trees, Jeddah, in spite of its
population of twelve or fifteen thousand (a number which is doubled in the pilgrimage season)
presents a strange appearance. The population is the reverse of autochthonous; it is composed
of natives of Hadramaut and Yemen, Indians from Surat and Bombay, and Malays who come as pilgrims
and settle in the town. Burckhardt introduces many anecdotes of interest into his account of
the manners, mode of living, price of commodities, and number of traders in the place.

Speaking of the singular customs of the natives of Jeddah, he says:--"It is the almost universal
custom for everybody to swallow a cup full of ghee or melted butter in the morning. After this
they take coffee, which they regard as a strong tonic; and they are so accustomed to this habit
from their earliest years, that they feel greatly inconvenienced if they discontinue it. The
higher classes are satisfied with drinking the cup of butter, but the lower classes add another
half cup, which they draw up through the nostrils, imagining that they thus prevent bad air
entering the body by those apertures."

The traveller left Jeddah for Tayf on the 24th of August. The road winds over mountains and
across valleys of romantic beauty and luxuriant verdure. Burckhardt was taken for an English
spy at Tayf, and, although he was well received by the Pasha, he had no liberty, and could
not carry on his observations.

Tayf, it appears, is famous for the beauty of its gardens; roses and grapes are sent from it
into all the districts of Hedjaz. This town had a considerable trade, and was very prosperous
before it was plundered by the Wahabees.

The surveillance to which he was subjected hastened Burckhardt's departure, and upon the 7th
of September he started for Mecca. Well versed in the study of the Koran, and acquainted with
all the practices of Islamism, he was prepared to act the part of a pilgrim. His first care
was to dress himself in accordance with the law prescribed for the faithful who enter Mecca--in
the "ihram," or pieces of cloth without seam, one covering the loins, the other thrown over
the neck and shoulders. The pilgrim's first duty is to proceed to the temple, without waiting
even to procure a lodging. This Burckhardt did not fail to do, observing at the same time the
rites and ceremonies prescribed in such cases, of which he gives many interesting particulars;
we cannot, however, dwell upon them here.

"Mecca," says Burckhardt, "may be called a pretty town. Every house has a terrace built of
stone, and sloping in such a way as to allow water to run down the gutters into the street.
Low walls with parapets conceal these terraces; for, as everywhere else in the East, it is
not thought right for a man to appear there; he would be accused of spying upon the women,
who spend much of their time upon the terrace of the house, engaged in domestic work, drying
corn, hanging out linen, &c."

The only public place in the city is the large court of the Grand Mosque. Trees are rare; not
a garden enlivens the view, and the scene depends for animation upon the well-stocked shops
which abound during the pilgrimage. With the exception of four or five large houses belonging
to the administration, two colleges, which have since been converted into warehouses for corn,
and the mosque with the few buildings and colleges connected with it, Mecca can boast of no
public buildings, and cannot compete in this respect with other cities in the East of the same
size.

The streets are unpaved; and as drains are unknown, water collects in puddles, and the accumulation
of mud is inconceivable. For a water supply the natives trust to heaven, catching the rain
in cisterns, for that obtained from the wells is so foul that it is impossible to drink it.

In the centre of the town, where the valley widens a little, the mosque known as Beithóu'llah,
or El Haram, is situated. This edifice owes its fame to the Kaaba which is enclosed in it,
for other Eastern towns can boast of mosques equally large and more beautiful. El Haram is
situated in an oblong space, surrounded on the eastern side by a quadruple colonnade, and by
a triple one on the other. The columns are connected by pointed arches, upon each four stand
little domes constructed of mortar and whitened outside. Some of these columns are of white
marble, granite, or porphyry, but the greater part are of the common stone found among the
mountains of Mecca.

The Kaaba has been so often ruined and restored that no trace of a remote antiquity remains.
It was in existence before this mosque was built.

The traveller says, "The Kaaba is placed upon an inclined base some two feet high, and its
roof being flat, it presents the appearance at a little distance of a perfect cube. The only
door by which it can be entered, and which is opened two or three times a year, is on the north
side, about seven feet above the ground, for which reason one cannot enter except by means
of a wooden staircase. The famous 'black stone' is enshrined at the north-eastern corner of
the Kaaba, near the door, and forms one of the angles of the building four or five feet above
the floor of the court. It is difficult to ascertain the exact nature of this stone, as its
surface has been completely worn and reduced to its present condition by the kisses and worshipping
touches bestowed upon it by countless millions of pilgrims. The Kaaba is entirely covered with
black silk, which envelopes its sides, leaving the roof exposed. This veil or curtain is called
'the Kesoua,' and is renewed yearly during the pilgrimage. It is brought from Cairo, where
it is manufactured at the expense of the Viceroy."

Up to the time of Burckhardt no such detailed account of Mecca and her sanctuary had been given
to the world. For this reason we shall insert extracts from the original narrative; extracts
which might indeed be multiplied, for they include circumstantial accounts of the sacred well,
called Zemzem, water from which is considered as an infallible remedy for every complaint.
The traveller speaks also of the "Gate of Salvation," of the Makam Ibrahim, a monument containing
the stone upon which Abraham sat when he was engaged in building the Kaaba, and where the marks
of his knees may still be seen, and of all the buildings enclosed within the temple precincts.

Judging from Burckhardt's minute and complete description, these spots still retain their former
physiognomy. The same number of pilgrims chant the same songs; the men only are no longer the
same. His accounts of the feast of the pilgrimage and the holy enthusiasm of the faithful,
are followed by a picture which brings before us, in the most sombre colours, the effects of
this great gathering of men, attracted from every part of the world.

"The termination of the pilgrimage," he says, "lends a very different aspect to the mosque.
Illness and death, consequent upon the great fatigues undergone during the voyage, are accelerated
by the scanty covering afforded by the Ihram, the unhealthy dwellings of Mecca, the bad food,
and frequent absolute dearth of provisions. The temple is filled with corpses brought thither
to receive the prayers of the Iman, or with sick persons who insist upon being carried, as
their last hours approach, to the colonnade, hoping to be saved by the sight of the Kaaba,
or in any case to have the consolation of expiring within the sacred precincts. One sees poor
pilgrims, sinking under illness and hunger, dragging their weary bodies along the colonnade;
and when they no longer have the strength to stretch out a hand to the passer-by, they place
a little jar beside the mat upon which they are laid, to receive what charity may bestow upon
them. As they feel the last moment approach, they cover themselves with their ragged clothes,
and very often a day passes before it is ascertained that they are dead."

We will conclude our extracts from Burckhardt's account of Mecca with his opinion of the inhabitants.

"Although the natives of Mecca possess grand qualities, although they are pleasant, hospitable,
cheerful and proud, they openly transgress the Koran by drinking, gambling, and smoking. Deceit
and perjury are no longer looked upon as crimes by them; they do not ignore the scandal such
vices bring upon them; but while each individually exclaims against the corruption of manners,
none reform themselves."

Upon the 15th of January, 1815, Burckhardt left Mecca with a caravan of pilgrims on their way
to visit the tomb of the prophet. The journey to Medina, like that between Mecca and Jeddah,
was accomplished at night, and afforded little opportunity for observation. In the winter night-travelling
is less comfortable than travelling by day. A valley called Wady-Fatme, but generally known
as El-Wadi, was crossed; it abounded in shrubs and date-trees, and was well cultivated in the
eastern portion. The club goes on without much change, Mr. Masters being very regular in his attendance,
undeterred by the grandeur of his new household.

And Larry is always there,--with increased spirit, for he has dined two or three times lately
at Hampton Wick, having met young Hampton at the Squire's house at Bragton. On this point Fred
Botsey was for a time very jealous;--but he found that Larry's popularity was not to be shaken,
and now is very keen in pushing an intimacy with the owner of Chowton Farm. Perhaps the most
stirring event in the neighbourhood has been the retirement of Captain Glomax from the post
of Master. When the season was over he made an application to Lord Rufford respecting certain
stable and kennel expenses, which that nobleman snubbed very bluntly. Each little plot
is surrounded by a wall of mud or stone, and the cultivators live in hamlets or isolated cabins
among the trees. The principal stream flows through a grove near the market; beside it rises
a little mosque, shaded by large chestnuts. I had seen none before in the Hedjaz."

Burckhardt was thirteen days in reaching Medina. But this rather long journey was not lost
time to him; he collected much information about the Arabs and the Wahabees. At Medina, as
at Mecca, the pilgrim's first duty is to visit the tomb and mosque of Mahomet; but the ceremonies
attending the visit are much easier and shorter, and the traveller performed them in a quarter
of an hour.

Burckhardt's stay at Mecca had already been prejudicial to him. At Medina he was attacked by
intermittent fever, which increased in violence, and was accompanied by violent sickness. This
soon so reduced him, that he could no longer rise from his carpet without the assistance of
his slave, "a poor fellow who by nature and habit was more fit to tend camels than to take
care of his worn-out and enfeebled master."

Burckhardt being detained at Medina for more than three months by a fever, due to bad climate,
the detestable quality of the water, and the prevalence of infectious illnesses, was forced
to relinquish his project of crossing the desert to Akabah, in order to reach Yanibo as quickly
as possible, and from thence embark for Egypt.

"Next to Aleppo," he says, "Medina is the best-built town I have seen in the East. It is entirely
of stone, the houses being generally three stories high, with flat tops. As they are not whitewashed,
and the stone is brown in colour, the streets, which are very narrow, have usually a sombre
appearance. They are often only two or three paces wide. At the present time Medina looks desolate
enough; the houses are falling into ruins. Their owners, who formerly derived a considerable
profit from the inroad of pilgrims, find their revenues diminishing, as the Wahabees forbid
visitors to the tomb of the prophet, alleging that he was but a mere mortal. The possession
which places Medina on a par with Mecca is the Grand Mosque, containing the tomb of Mahomet.
This is smaller than that at Mecca, but is built upon the same plan, in a large square courtyard,
surrounded on all sides by covered galleries, and having a small building in the centre. The
famous tomb, surrounded by an iron railing painted green, is near the eastern corner. It is
of good workmanship, in imitation of filagree, and interlaced with inscriptions in copper.
Four doors, of which three lead into this enclosure, are kept constantly shut. Permission to
enter is freely accorded to persons of rank, and others can purchase permission of the principal
eunuchs for about fifteen piasters. In the interior are hangings which surround the tomb, and
are only a few feet from it." According to the historian of Medina, these hangings cover a
square edifice, built of black stones, and supported upon two columns, in the interior of which
are the sepulchres of Mahomet and his two eldest disciples, Abou-Bekr and Omar. He also states
that these sepulchres are deep holes, and that the coffin which contains the ashes of Mahomet
is covered with silver, and surmounted by a marble slab with the inscription, "In the name
of God, give him thy pity." The fables which were spread throughout Europe as to the tomb of
the prophet being suspended in mid air, are unknown in the Hedjaz. The mosque was robbed of
a great part of its treasures by the Wahabees, but there is some ground for believing that
they had been forestalled by the successive guardians of the tomb.

Many other interesting details of Medina, and its inhabitants, surroundings, and the haunts
of pilgrims, are to be found in Burckhardt's narrative. But we have given sufficient extracts
to induce the reader who desires further information respecting the manners and customs of
the Arabs, which have not changed, to refer to the book itself.

Upon the 21st of April, 1815, Burckhardt joined a caravan which conducted him to Yembo, where
the plague was raging. The traveller at once fell ill and became so weak that it was impossible
for him to resort to a country place. To embark was equally impossible; all the vessels which
were ready to start were crowded with soldiers. He was compelled to remain eighteen days in
the unhealthy little town, before he could obtain a passage in a small vessel which took him
to Cosseir, and thence to Egypt.

Upon his return to Cairo Burckhardt heard of his father's death. The traveller's constitution
had been sorely tried by illness, and he was unable to attempt the ascent of Mount Sinai until
1816. The study of natural history, the publication of his diary, and his correspondence, occupied
him until 1817, at which time he expected to go with a caravan to Fezzan. Unfortunately he
succumbed to a sudden attack of fever, his last words being, "Write and tell my mother that
my last thought was of her."

Burckhardt was an accomplished traveller; well-informed, exact to minuteness, patient, courageous,
and endowed with an upright and energetic character. His writings are of great value; the narrative
of his voyage in Arabia--of which he unfortunately could not explore the interior--is so complete
and precise, that owing to it that country was then better known than many in Europe.

In writing to his father from Cairo on the 13th of March, 1817, he says, "I have never said
a word about what I have seen and met with that my conscience did not entirely justify; I did
not expose myself to so much danger in order to write a romance!"

The explorers who have succeeded him in the same countries unanimously testify to his exactness,
and agree in praising his fidelity, knowledge, and sagacity.

"Few travellers," says the Revue Germanique, "have enjoyed in a like degree the faculty of
observation. That is a rare gift of nature, like all eminent qualities. He possessed a sort
of intuition which discerned the truth, apart from his own observations, and thus information
given by him from hearsay has a value that seldom attaches to statements of that nature. "You
weren't a fool when you took me out through the orchard and caught me when I jumped over the
wall. Do you remember when you asked me, all of a sudden, whether I should like to be your wife?
You weren't a fool then."
"But you knew what was coming."

While the Biblical countries occupied the attention of Seetzen and Burckhardt, India, the birthplace
of most of the European languages, was about to command the attention of students of language,
literature, and religion, as well as of geography. For the present our concern is with those
problems of physical geography, which the conquests and studies of the India Company were about
to solve by degrees.

In a preceding volume we have related how the Portuguese rule was established in India. The
union of Portugal with Spain, in 1599, led to the fall of the Portuguese colonies, which came
into the possession of the English and Dutch. England soon afterwards granted a monopoly of
the commerce of India to a Company which was destined to play an important part in history.

At this time Akbar, the great Mogul emperor, the seventh descendant of Timour Leng, had established
a vast empire in Hindustan and Bengal, upon the ruins of the Rajpoot kingdoms. Owing to the
personal qualities of Akbar, which had gained for him the surname of the Benefactor of Man,
that empire was at the height of its glory. The same brilliant course was pursued by Shah Jehan;
but Akbar's grandson, Aurung Zeb, inspired by an insatiable ambition, assassinated his brothers,
imprisoned his father, and seized the reins of government. While the Mogul Empire was in the
enjoyment of profound peace, a clever adventurer laid the foundations of the Mahratta Empire.
The religious intolerance of Aurung Zeb, and his crafty policy, led to the insurrection of
the Rajpoots, and a struggle, which by draining the resources of the empire, shook his power.
The death of the great usurper was followed by the decadence of the empire.

Up to this period the India Company had been unable to add to the narrow strip of territory
which they possessed at the ports, but it was now to benefit by the conflict between the nabobs
and rajahs of Hindustan. It was not, however, until after the taking of Madras, in 1746, by
La Bourdonnais, and the struggle against Dupleix, that the influence and dominion of the English
Company was materially increased.
