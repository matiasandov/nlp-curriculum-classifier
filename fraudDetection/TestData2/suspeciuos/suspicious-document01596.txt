CHAPTER I.

INFANCY.

King Charles the Second was the son and successor of King Charles the First. These two are
the only kings of the name of Charles that have appeared, thus far, in the line of English
sovereigns. Nor is it very probable that there will soon be another. The reigns of both these
monarchs were stained and tarnished with many vices and crimes, and darkened by national disasters
of every kind, and the name is thus connected with so many painful associations in the minds
of men, that it seems to have been dropped, by common consent, in all branches of the royal family.

The reign of Charles the First, as will be seen by the history of his life in this series,
was characterized by a long and obstinate contest between the king and the people, which brought
on, at last, a civil war, in which the king was defeated and taken prisoner, and in the end
beheaded on a block, before one of his own palaces. During the last stages of this terrible
contest, and before Charles way himself taken prisoner, he was, as it were, a fugitive and
an outlaw in his own dominions. His wife and family were scattered in various foreign lands,
his cities and castles were in the hands of his enemies, and his oldest son, the prince Charles,
was the object of special hostility. The prince incurred, therefore, a great many dangers,
and suffered many heavy calamities in his early years. He lived to see these calamities pass
away, and, after they were gone, he enjoyed, so far as his own personal safety and welfare
were concerned, a tranquil and prosperous life. The storm, however, of trial and suffering
which enveloped the evening of his father's days, darkened the morning of his own. The life
of Charles the First was a river rising gently, from quiet springs, in a scene of verdure and
sunshine, and flowing gradually into rugged and gloomy regions, where at last it falls into
a terrific abyss, enveloped in darkness and storms. That of Charles the Second, on the other
hand, rising in the wild and rugged mountains where the parent stream was engulfed, commences
its course by leaping frightfully from precipice to precipice, with turbid and foaming waters,
but emerges at last into a smooth and smiling land, and flows through it prosperously to the sea.

Prince Charles's mother, the wife of Charles the First, was a French princess. Her name was
Henrietta Maria. She was unaccomplished, beautiful, and very spirited woman. She was a Catholic,
and the English people, who were very decided in their hostility to the Catholic faith, were
extremely jealous of her. They watched all her movements with the utmost suspicion. They were
very unwilling that an heir to the crown should arise in her family. The animosity which they
felt against her husband the king, which was becoming every day more and more bitter, seemed
to be doubly inveterate and intense toward her. They published pamphlets, in which they called
her a daughter of Heth, a Canaanite, and an idolatress, and expressed hopes that from such
a worse than pagan stock no progeny should ever spring.

Henrietta was at this time--1630--twenty-one years of age, and had been married about four
years. She had had one son, who had died a few days after his birth. Of course, she did not
lead a very happy life in England. The situation is about 150 yards from the Hudson, of which, and
the surrounding country it commands an extensive view. The whole is enclosed by a stone wall,
with an area of several acres, interspersed with gravel walks, green plats, and full-grown trees.

Note.--All
our readers may not be aware that the remains of Two Literary Colleges still exist in London:
Gresham College and Sion College--or we should say of one of them. The first was founded and
endowed by that excellent citizen Sir Thomas Gresham. He was much opposed by the university of Cambridge,
which endeavoured to prevent the establishment of a rival institution.

(This was two centuries and a half ago.) He devised by will, his house in Bishopsgate street, to
be converted into habitations and lecture-rooms for seven professors or lecturers on seven
liberal sciences, who were to receive a salary out of the revenues of the Royal Exchange. Gresham
College was subsequently converted into the modern general excise-office; but the places are still
continued, with a double salary for the loss of apartments, and the lectures are delivered
gratuitously twice a day in a small room in the Royal Exchange, during term-time. The will of
the founder has not, however, been actually carried into execution. As we hate "solemn farce"
and "ignorance in stilts," we hope "scrutiny will not be stone blind" in this matter. A more
useful man than Sir Thomas Gresham is not to be found in British biography, and it is painful
to see his good intentions frustrated.

Sion College is situated near London Wall, to the south of Fore-street.
It was founded in 1623 by the rector of St. Dunstan's in the west,
for the London clergy. The
star was doubtless Venus, which, in certain circumstances, is often bright enough to be seen
when the sun is above the horizon. The populace of London, however, who were not in those days
very profound astronomers, regarded the shining of the star as a supernatural occurrence altogether,
and as portending the future greatness and glory of the prince whose natal day it thus unexpectedly
adorned.

Preparations were made for the baptism of the young prince in July. The baptism of a prince
is an important affair, and there was one circumstance which gave a peculiar interest to that
of the infant Charles. The Reformation had not been long established in England, and this happened
to be the first occasion on which an heir to the English crown had been baptized since the
Liturgy of the English Church had been arranged. There is a chapel connected with the palace
of St. James, as is usual with royal palaces in Europe, and even, in fact, with the private
castles and mansions of the higher nobility. The baptism took place there. On such occasions
it is usual for certain persons to appear as sponsors, as they are called, who undertake to
answer for the safe and careful instruction of the child in the principles of the Christian
faith. This is, of course, mainly a form, the real function of the sponsors being confined,
as it would appear, to making magnificent presents to their young godchild, in acknowledgment
of the distinguished honor conferred upon them by their designation to the office which they
hold. The sponsors, on this occasion, were certain royal personages in France, the relatives
of the queen. They could not appear personally, and so they appointed proxies from among the
higher nobility of England, who appeared at the baptism in their stead, and made the presents
to the child. One of these proxies was a duchess, whose gift was a jewel valued at a sum in
English money equal to thirty thousand dollars.

The oldest son of a king of England receives the title of Prince of Wales; and there was an
ancient custom of the realm, that an infant prince of Wales should be under the care, in his
earliest years, of a Welsh nurse, so that the first words which he should learn to speak might
be the vernacular language of his principality. Such a nurse was provided for Charles. Rockers
for his cradle were appointed, and many other officers of his household, all the arrangements
being made in a very magnificent and sumptuous manner. It is the custom in England to pay fees
to the servants by which a lady or gentleman is attended, even when a guest in private dwellings;
and some idea may be formed of the scale on which the pageantry of this occasion was conducted,
from the fact that one of the lady sponsors who rode to the palace in the queen's carriage,
which was sent for her on this occasion, paid a sum equal to fifty dollars each to six running
footmen who attended the carriage, and a hundred dollars to the coachman; while a number of
knights who came on horseback and in armor to attend upon the carriage, as it moved to the
palace, received each a gratuity of two hundred and fifty dollars. The state dresses on the
occasion of this baptism were very costly and splendid, being of white satin trimmed with crimson.

The little prince was thus an object of great attention at the very commencement of his days,
His mother had his portrait painted, and sent it to her mother in France. She did not, however,
in the letters which accompanied the picture, though his mother, praise the beauty of her child.
She said, in fact, that he was so ugly that she was ashamed of him, though his size and plumpness,
she added, atoned for the want of beauty. And then he was so comically serious and grave in
the expression of his countenance! the queen said she verily believed that he was wiser than
herself.

As the young prince advanced in years, the religious and political difficulties in the English
nation increased, and by the time that he had arrived at an age when he could begin to receive
impressions from the conversation and intercourse of those around him, the Parliament began
to be very jealous of the influence which his mother might exert. They were extremely anxious
that he should be educated a Protestant, and were very much afraid that his mother would contrive
to initiate him secretly into the ideas and practices of the Catholic faith.

She insisted that she did not attempt to do this, and perhaps she did not; but in those days
it was often considered right to make false pretensions and to deceive, so far as this was
necessary to promote the cause of true religion. The queen did certainly make some efforts
to instill Catholic principles into the minds of some of her children; for she had other children
after the birth of Charles. She gave a daughter a crucifix one day, which is a little image
of Christ upon the cross, made usually of ivory, or silver, or gold, and also a rosary, which
is a string of beads, by means of which the Catholics are assisted to count their prayers.
Henrietta gave these things to her daughter secretly, and told her to hide them in her pocket,
and taught her how to use them. The Parliament considered such attempts to influence the minds
of the royal children as very heinous sins, and they made such arrangements for secluding the
young prince Charles from his mother, and putting the others under the guidance of Protestant
teachers and governors, as very much interfered with Henrietta's desires to enjoy the society
of her children. Since England was a Protestant realm, a Catholic lady, in marrying an English
king, ought not to have expected, perhaps, to have been allowed to bring up her children in
her own faith; still, it must have been very hard for a mother to be forbidden to teach her
own children what she undoubtedly believed was the only possible means of securing for them
the favor and protection of Heaven.

There is in London a vast storehouse of books, manuscripts, relics, curiosities, pictures,
and other memorials of by-gone days, called the British Museum. Among the old records here
preserved are various letters written by Henrietta, and one or two by Charles, the young prince,
during his childhood. Here is one, for instance, written by Henrietta to her child, when the
little prince was but eight years of age, chiding him for not being willing to take his medicine.
He was at that time under the charge of Lord Newcastle.

"CHARLES,--I am sorry that I must begin my first letter with chiding
you, because I hear that you will not take phisicke, I hope it was
onlie for this day, and that to-morrow you will do it for if you will
not, I must come to you, and make you take it, for it is for your
health. I have given order to mi Lord of Newcastle to send mi word
to-night whether you will or not. Therefore I hope you will not give
me the paines to goe; and so I rest, your affectionate mother,
                                       HENRIETTE MARIE."

The letter was addressed

"To MI DEARE SONNE the Prince."

The queen must have taken special pains with this her first letter to her son, for, with all
its faults of orthography, it is very much more correct than most of the epistles which she
attempted to write in English. She was very imperfectly acquainted with the English language,
using, as she almost always did, in her domestic intercourse, her own native tongue.

Time passed on, and the difficulties and contests between King Charles and his people and Parliament
became more and more exciting and alarming. One after another of the king's most devoted and
faithful ministers was arrested, tried, condemned, and beheaded, notwithstanding all the efforts
which their sovereign master could make to save them. Parties were formed, and party spirit
ran very high. Tumults were continually breaking out about the palaces, which threatened the
personal safety of the king and queen. Henrietta herself was a special object of the hatred
which these outbreaks expressed. The king himself was half distracted by the overwhelming difficulties
of his position. Bad as it was in England, it was still worse in Scotland. There was an actual
rebellion there, and the urgency of the danger in that quarter was so great that Charles concluded
to go there, leaving the poor queen at home to take care of herself and her little ones as
well as she could, with the few remaining means of protection yet left at her disposal.

There was an ancient mansion, called Oatlands, not very far from London, where the queen generally
resided during the absence of her husband. It was a lonely place, on low and level ground,
and surrounded by moats filled with water, over which those who wished to enter passed by draw
bridges. Henrietta chose this place for her residence because she thought she should be safer
there from mobs and violence. She kept the children all there except the Prince of Wales, who
was not allowed to be wholly under her care. He, how ever, often visited his mother, and she
sometimes visited him.

During the absence of her husband, Queen Henrietta was subjected to many severe and heavy trials.
Her communications with him were often interrupted and broken. She felt a very warm interest
in the prosperity and success of his expedition, and sometimes the tidings she received from
him encouraged her to hope that all might yet be well. Here, for instance, is a note which
she addressed one day to an officer who had sent her a letter from the king, that had come
enclosed to him. It is written in a broken English, which shows how imperfectly the foreign
lady had learned the language of her adopted country. They who understand the French language
will be interested in observing that most of the errors which the writer falls into are those
which result naturally from the usages of her mother tongue.

Queen Henrietta to Sir Edward Nicholas.

"MAISTRE NICHOLAS,--I have reseaved your letter, and that you send me
from the king, which writes me word he as been vere well reseaved in
Scotland; that both the armi and the people have shewed a creat joy
to see the king, and such that theay say was never seen before. Pray
God it may continue.
                                   Your friend, HENRIETTE MARIE R."

At one time during the king's absence in Scotland the Parliament threatened to take the queen's
children all away from her, for fear, as they said, that she would make papists of them. This
danger alarmed and distressed the queen exceedingly. She declared that she did not intend or
desire to bring up her children in the Catholic faith. She knew this was contrary to the wish
of the king her husband, as well as of the people of England. In order to diminish the danger
that the children would be taken away, she left Oatlands herself, and went to reside at other
palaces, only going occasionally to visit her children. Though she was thus absent from them
in person, her heart was with them all the time, and she was watching with great solicitude
and anxiety for any indications of a design on the part of her enemies to come and take them away.

At last she received intelligence that an armed force was ordered to assemble one night in
the vicinity of Oatlands to seize her children, under the pretext that the queen was herself
forming plans for removing them out of the country and taking them to France. Henrietta was
a lady of great spirit and energy, and this threatened danger to her children aroused all her
powers. She sent immediately to all the friends about her on whom she could rely, and asked
them to come, armed and equipped, and with as many followers as they could muster, to the park
at Oatlands that night. There were also then in and near London a number of officers of the
army, absent from their posts on furlough. She sent similar orders to these. All obeyed the
summons with eager alacrity. The queen mustered and armed her own household, too, down to the
lowest servants of the kitchen. By these means quite a little army was collected in the park
at Oatlands, the separate parties coming in, one after another, in the evening and night. This
guard patrolled the grounds till morning, the queen herself animating them by her presence
and energy. The children, whom the excited mother was thus guarding, like a lioness defending
her young, were all the time within the mansion, awaiting in infantile terror some dreadful
calamity, they scarcely knew what, which all this excitement seemed to portend.

The names and ages of the queen's children at this time were as follows:

Charles, prince of Wales, the subject of this story, eleven.

Mary, ten. Young as she was, she was already married, having been espoused a short time before
to William, prince of Orange, who was one year older than herself.

James, duke of York, seven. He became afterward King James II.

Elizabeth, six.

Henry, an infant only a few months old.

The night passed away without any attack, though a considerable force assembled in the vicinity,
which was, however, soon after disbanded. The queen's fears were, nevertheless, not allayed.
She began to make arrangements for escaping from the kingdom in ease it should become necessary
to do so. She sent a certain faithful friend and servant to Portsmouth with orders to get some
vessels ready, so that she could fly there with her children and embark at a moment's notice,
if these dangers and alarms should continue.

She did not, however, have occasion to avail herself of these preparations. Affairs seemed
to take a more favorable turn. The king came back from Scotland. He was received by his people,
on his arrival, with apparent cordiality and good will. The queen was, of course, rejoiced
to welcome him home, and she felt relieved and protected by his presence. The city of London,
which had been the main seat of disaffection and hostility to the royal family, began to show
symptoms of returning loyalty and friendly regard. In reciprocation for this, the king determined
on making a grand entry into the city, to pay a sort of visit to the authorities. He rode,
on this occasion, in a splendid chariot of state, with the little prince by his side. Queen
Henrietta came next, in an open carriage of her own, and the other children, with other carriages,
followed in the train. A long cortege of guards and attendants, richly dressed and magnificently
mounted, preceded and followed the royal family, while the streets were lined with thousands
of spectators, who waved handkerchiefs and banners, and shouted God save the king! In the midst
of this scene of excitement and triumph, Henrietta rode quietly along, her anxieties relieved,
her sorrows and trials ended, and her heart bounding with happiness and hope. She was once
more, as she conceived, reunited to her husband and her children, and reconciled to the people
of her realm. She thought her troubles were over Alas! they had, on the contrary, scarcely begun.

CHAPTER II.

PRINCE CHARLES'S MOTHER.

The indications and promises of returning peace and happiness which gave Prince Charles's mother
so much animation and hope after the return of her husband from Scotland were all very superficial
and fallacious. The real grounds of the quarrel between the king and his Parliament, and of
the feelings of alienation and ill will cherished toward the queen, were all, unfortunately,
as deep and extensive as ever; and the storm, which lulled treacherously for a little time,
broke forth soon afterward anew, with a frightful violence which it was evident that nothing
could withstand. This new onset of disaster and calamity was produced in such a way that Henrietta
had to reproach herself with being the cause of its coming.

She had often represented to the king that, in her opinion, one main cause of the difficulties
he had suffered was that he did not act efficiently and decidedly, and like a man, in putting
down the opposition manifested against him on the part of his subjects; and now, soon after
his return from Scotland, on some new spirit of disaffection showing itself in Parliament,
she urged him to act at once energetically and promptly against it. She proposed to him to
take an armed force with him, and proceed boldly to the halls where the Parliament was assembled,
and arrest the leaders of the party who were opposed to him. There were five of them who were
specially prominent. The queen believed that if these five men were seized and imprisoned in
the Tower, the rest would be intimidated and overawed, and the monarch's lost authority and
power would be restored again.

The king was persuaded, partly by the dictates of his own judgment, and partly by the urgency
of the queen, to make the attempt. The circumstances of this case, so far as the action of
the king was concerned in them, are fully related in the history of Charles the First. Here
we have only to speak of the queen, who was left in a state of great suspense and anxiety in
her palace at Whitehall while her husband was gone on his dangerous mission.

The plan of the king to make this irruption into the great legislative assembly of the nation
had been kept, so they supposed, a very profound secret, lest the members whom he was going
to arrest should receive warning of their danger and fly. When the time arrived, the king bade
Henrietta farewell, saying that she might wait there an hour, and if she received no ill news
from him during that time, she might be sure that he had been successful, and that he was once
more master of his kingdom. The queen remained in the apartment where the king had left her,
looking continually at the watch which she held before her, and counting the minutes impatiently
as the hands moved slowly on. She had with her one confidential friend, the Lady Carlisle,
who sat with her and seemed to share her solicitude, though she had not been entrusted with
the secret. The time passed on. No ill tidings came; and at length the hour fully expired,
and Henrietta, able to contain herself no longer, exclaimed with exultation, "Rejoice with
me; the hour is gone. From this time my husband is master of his realm. His enemies in Parliament
are all arrested before this time, and his kingdom is henceforth his own."

It certainly is possible for kings and queens to have faithful friends, but there are so many
motives and inducements to falsehood and treachery in court, that it is not possible, generally,
for them to distinguish false friends from true. The Lady Carlisle was a confederate with some
of the very men whom Charles had gone to arrest. On receiving this intimation of their danger,
she sent immediately to the houses of Parliament, which were very near at hand, and the obnoxious
members received warning in time to fly. The hour had indeed elapsed, but the king had met
with several unexpected delays, both in his preparations for going, and on his way to the House
of Commons, so that when at last he entered, the members were gone. His attempt, however, unsuccessful
as it was, evoked a general storm of indignation and anger, producing thus all the exasperation
which was to have been expected from the measure, without in any degree accomplishing its end.
The poor queen was overwhelmed with confusion and dismay when she learned the result. She had
urged her husband forward to an extremely dangerous and desperate measure, and then by her
thoughtless indiscretion had completely defeated the end. A universal and utterly uncontrollable
excitement burst like a clap of thunder upon the country as this outrage, as they termed it,
of the king became known, and the queen was utterly appalled at the extent and magnitude of
the mischief she had done.

The mischief was irremediable. The spirit of resentment and indignation which the king's action
had aroused, expressed itself in such tumultuous and riotous proceedings as to render the continuance
of the royal family in London no longer safe. They accordingly removed up the river to Hampton
Court, a famous palace on the Thames, not many miles from the city. There they remained but
a very short time. The dangers which beset them were evidently increasing. It was manifest
that the king must either give up what he deemed the just rights and prerogatives of the crown,
or prepare to maintain them by war. The queen urged him to choose the latter alternative. To
raise the means for doing this, she proposed that she should herself leave the country, taking
with her, her jewels, and such other articles of great value as could be easily carried away,
and by means of them and her personal exertions, raise funds and forces to aid her husband
in the approaching struggle.

The king yielded to the necessity which seemed to compel the adoption of this plan. He accordingly
set off to accompany Henrietta to the shore. She took with her the young Princess Mary; in
fact, the ostensible object of her journey was to convey her to her young husband, the Prince
of Orange, in Holland. In such infantile marriages as theirs, it is not customary, though the
marriage ceremony be performed, for the wedded pair to live together till they arrive at years
a little more mature.

The queen was to embark at Dover. Dover was in those days the great port of egress from England
to the Continent. There was, and is still, a great castle on the cliffs to guard the harbor
and the town. These cliffs are picturesque and high, falling off abruptly in chalky precipices
to the sea. Among them at one place is a sort of dell, by which there is a gradual descent
to the water. King Charles stood upon the shore when Henrietta sailed away, watching the ship
as it receded from his view, with tears in his eyes. With all the faults, characteristic of
her nation, which Henrietta possessed, she was now his best and truest friend, and when she
was gone he felt that he was left desolate and alone in the midst of the appalling dangers
by which he was environed.

The king went back to Hampton Court. Parliament sent him a request that he would come and reside
nearer to the capital, and enjoined upon him particularly not to remove the young Prince of
Wales. In the mean time they began to gather together their forces, and to provide munitions
of war. The king did the same. He sent the young prince to the western part of the kingdom,
and retired himself to the northward, to the city of York, which he made his head-quarters.
In a word, both parties prepared for war.

In the mean time, Queen Henrietta was very successful in her attempts to obtain aid for her
husband in Holland. Her misfortunes awakened pity, with which, through her beauty, and the
graces of her conversation and address, there was mingled a feeling analogous to love. Then,
besides, there was something in her spirit of earnest and courageous devotion to her husband
in the hours of his calamity that won for her a strong degree of admiration and respect.

There are no efforts which are so efficient and powerful in the accomplishment of their end
as those which a faithful wife makes to rescue and save her husband. The heart, generally so
timid, seems to be inspired on such occasions with a preternatural courage, and the arm, at
other times so feeble and helpless, is nerved with unexpected strength. Every one is ready
to second and help such efforts, and she who makes them is surprised at her success, and wonders
at the extent and efficiency of the powers which she finds herself so unexpectedly able to wield.

The queen interested all classes in Holland in her plans, and by her personal credit, and the
security of her diamonds and rubies, she borrowed large sums of money from the government,
from the banks, and from private merchants. The sums which she thus raised amounted to two
millions of pounds sterling, equal to nearly ten millions of dollars. While these negotiations
were going on she remained in Holland, with her little daughter, the bride, under her care,
whose education she was carrying forward all the time with the help of suitable masters; for,
though married, Mary was yet a child. The little husband was going on at the same time with
his studies too.

Henrietta remained in Holland a year. She expended a part of her money in purchasing military
stores and supplies for her husband, and then set sail with them, and with the money not expended,
to join the king. The voyage was a very extraordinary one. A great gale of wind began to blow
from the northeast soon after the ships left the port, which increased in violence for nine
days, until at length the sea was lashed to such a state of fury that the company lost all
hope of ever reaching the land. The queen had with her a large train of attendants, both ladies
and gentlemen; and there were also in her suit a number of Catholic priests, who always accompanied
her as the chaplains and confessors of her household. These persons had all been extremely
sick, and had been tied into their beds on account of the excessive rolling of the ship, and
their own exhaustion and helplessness. The danger increased, until at last it became so extremely
imminent that all the self-possession of the passengers was entirely gone. In such protracted
storms, the surges of the sea strike the ship with terrific force, and vast volumes of water
fall heavily upon the decks, threatening instant destruction--the ship plunging awfully after
the shock, as if sinking to rise no more. At such moments, the noble ladies who accompanied
the queen on this voyage would be overwhelmed with terror, and they filled the cabins with
their shrieks of dismay. All this time the queen herself was quiet and composed. She told the
ladies not to fear, for "queens of England were never drowned."

At one time, when the storm was at its height, the whole party were entirely overwhelmed with
consternation and terror. Two of the ships were engulfed and lost. The queen's company thought
that their own was sinking. They came crowding into the cabin where the priests were lying,
sick and helpless, and began all together to confess their sins to them, in the Catholic mode,
eager in these their last moments, as they supposed, to relieve their consciences in any way
from the burdens of guilt which oppressed them. The queen herself did not participate in these
fears. She ridiculed the absurd confessions, and rebuked the senseless panic to which the terrified
penitents were yielding; and whenever any mitigation of the violence of the gale made it possible
to do any thing to divert the minds of her company, she tried to make amusement out of the
odd and strange dilemmas in which they were continually placed, and the ludicrous disasters
and accidents which were always befalling her servants and officers of state, in their attempts
to continue the etiquette and ceremony proper in attendance upon a queen, and from which even
the violence of such a storm, and the imminence of such danger, could not excuse them. After
a fortnight of danger, terror, and distress, the ships that remained of the little squadron
succeeded in getting back to the port from which they had sailed.

The queen, however, did not despair. After a few days of rest and refreshment she set sail
again, though it was now in the dead of winter. The result of this second attempt was a prosperous
voyage, and the little fleet arrived in due time at Burlington, on the English coast, where
the queen landed her money and her stores. She had, however, after all, a very narrow escape,
for she was very closely pursued on her voyage by an English squadron. They came into port
the night after she had landed, and the next morning she was awakened by the crashing of cannon
balls and the bursting of bomb shells in the houses around her, and found, on hastily rising,
that the village was under a bombardment from the ships of her enemies. She hurried on some
sort of dress, and sallied forth with her attendants to escape into the fields. This incident
is related fully in the history of her husband, Charles the First; but there is one circumstance,
not there detailed, which illustrates very strikingly that strange combination of mental greatness
and energy worthy of a queen, with a simplicity of affections and tastes which we should scarcely
expect in a child, that marked Henrietta's character. She had a small dog. Its name was Mike.
They say it was an ugly little animal, too, in all eyes but her own. This dog accompanied her
on the voyage, and landed with her on the English shore. On the morning, however, when she
fled from her bed to escape from the balls and bomb shells of the English ships, she recollected,
after getting a short distance from the house, that Mike was left behind. She immediately returned,
ran up to her chamber again, seized Mike, who was sleeping unconsciously upon her bed, and
bore the little pet away from the scene of ruin which the balls and bursting shells were making,
all astonished, no doubt, at so hurried and violent an abduction. The party gained the open
fields, and seeking shelter in a dry trench, which ran along the margin of a field, they crouched
there together till the commander of the ships was tired of firing.

The queen's destination was York, the great and ancient capital of the north of England York
was the head quarters of King Charles's army, though he himself was not there at this time.
As soon as news of the queen's arrival reached York, the general in command there sent down
to the coast a detachment of two thousand men to escort the heroine, and the stores and money
which she had brought, to her husband's capital. At the head of this force she marched in triumph
across the country, with a long train of ordnance and baggage wagons loaded with supplies.
There were six pieces of cannon, and two hundred and fifty wagons loaded with the money which
she had obtained in Holland. The whole country was excited with enthusiasm at the spectacle.
The enthusiasm was increased by the air and bearing of the queen, who, proud and happy at this
successful result of all her dangers and toils, rode on horseback at the head of her army like
a general, spoke frankly to the soldiers, sought no shelter from the sun and rain, and ate
her meals, like the rest of the army, in a bivouac in the open field. She had been the means,
in some degree, of leading the king into his difficulties, by the too vigorous measures she
had urged him to take in the case of the attempted parliamentary arrest. She seems to have
been determined to make that spirit of resolution and energy in her, which caused the mischief
then, atone for it by its efficient usefulness now. She stopped on her march to summon and
take a town, which had been hitherto in the hands of her husband's enemies, adding thus the
glory of a conquest to the other triumphs of the day.

In fact, the queen's heart was filled with pride and pleasure at this conclusion of her enterprise,
as is very manifest from the frequent letters which she wrote to her husband at the time. The
king's cause revived. They gradually approached each other in the operations which they severally
conducted, until at last the king, after a great and successful battle, set off at the head
of a large escort to come and meet his wife. They met in the vale of Keynton, near Edgehill,
which is on the southern borders of Warwickshire, near the center of the island. The meeting
was, of course, one of the greatest excitement and pleasure. Charles praised the high courage
and faithful affection of his devoted wife, and she was filled with happiness in enjoying the
love and gratitude of her husband.

The pressure of outward misfortune and calamity has always the same strong tendency as was
manifest in this case to invigorate anew all the ties of conjugal and domestic affection, and
thus to create the happiness which it seems to the world to destroy. In the early part of Charles
and Henrietta's married life, while every thing external went smoothly and prosperously with
them, they were very far from being happy. They destroyed each other's peace by petty disputes
and jars about things of little consequence, in which they each had scarcely any interest except
a desire to carry the point and triumph over the other. King Charles himself preserved a record
of one of these disputes. The queen had received, at the time of her marriage, certain estates,
consisting of houses and lands, the income of which was to be at her disposal, and she wished
to appoint certain treasurers to take charge of this property. She had made out a list of these
officers in consultation with her mother. She gave this list to Charles one night, after he
was himself in bed. He said he would look at it in the morning, but that she must remember
that, by the marriage treaty, he was to appoint those officers. She said, in reply, that a
part of those whom she had named were English. The king said that he would look at the paper
in the morning, and such of the English names as he approved he would confirm, but that he
could not appoint any Frenchmen. The queen answered that she and her mother had selected the
men whom she had named, and she would not have any body else. Charles rejoined that the business
was not either in her power or her mother's, and if she relied on such an influence to effect
her wishes, he would not appoint any body that she recommended. The queen was very much hurt
at this, and began to be angry. She said that if she could not put in whom she chose, to have
the care of her property, she would not have any such property. He might take back her houses
and lands, and allow her what he pleased in money in its stead. Charles replied by telling
her to remember whom she was speaking to; that he could not be treated in that manner; and
then the queen, giving way to lamentations and tears, said she was wretched and miserable;
every thing that she wanted was denied her, and whatever she recommended was refused on the
very account of her recommendation. Charles tried to speak, but she would not hear; she went
on with her lamentations and complaints, interrupted only by her own sobs of passion and grief.

The reader may perhaps imagine that this must have been an extreme and unusual instance of
dissension between this royal pair; but it was not. Cases of far greater excitement and violence
sometimes occurred. The French servants and attendants, whom the queen very naturally preferred,
and upon whom the king was as naturally inclined to look with suspicion and ill will, were
a continual source of disagreement between them. At last, one afternoon, the king, happening
to come into that part of the palace at Whitehall where the queen's apartments were situated,
and which was called "the queen's side", found there a number of her gentlemen and lady attendants
in a great frolic, capering and dancing in a way which the gay Frenchmen probably considered
nothing extraordinary, but which King Charles regarded as very irreverent and unsuitable conduct
to be witnessed in the presence of an English queen. He was very much displeased. He advanced
to Henrietta, took her by the arm, conducted her sternly to his own side of the palace, brought
her into one of his own apartments, and locked the door. He then sent an officer to direct
all the French servants and attendants in the queen's apartments to leave the palace immediately,
and repair to Somerset House, which was not far distant, and remain there till they received
further orders. The officer executed these commands in a very rough manner. The French women
shrieked and cried, and filled the court yard of the palace with their clamor; but the officer
paid no regard to this noise. He turned them all out of the apartments, and locked the doors
after them.

The queen was rendered quite frantic with vexation and rage at these proceedings. She flew
to the windows to see and to bid farewell to her friends, and to offer them expressions of
her sympathy. The king pulled her away, telling her to be quiet and submit, for he was determined
that they should go. The queen was determined that she would not submit. She attempted to open
the windows; the king held them down. Excited now to a perfect frenzy in the struggle, she
began to break out the panes with her fist, while Charles exerted all his force to restrain
and confine her, by grasping her wrists and endeavoring to force her away. What a contrast
between the low and sordid selfishness and jealousy evinced in such dissensions as these, and
the lofty and heroic devotedness and fidelity which this wife afterward evinced for her husband
in the harassing cares the stormy voyages, and the martial exposures and fatigues which she
endured for his sake! And yet, notwithstanding this great apparent contrast, and the wide difference
in the estimation which mankind form of the conduct of the actor in these different scenes,
still we can see that it is, after all, the impulse of the same lofty and indomitable spirit
which acted in both. The soul itself of the queen was not altered, nor even the character of
her action. The change was in the object and aim. In the one case she was contending against
the authority of a husband, to gain petty and useless victories in domestic strife; in the
other, the same spirit and energy were expended in encountering the storms and tempests of
outward adversity to sustain her husband and protect her children. Thus the change was a change
of circumstances rather than of character.

The change was, however, none the less important on that account in its influence on the king.
It restored to him the affection and sympathy of his wife, and filled his heart with inward
happiness. It was a joyous change to him, though it was produced by sufferings and sorrows;
for it was the very pressure of outward calamity that made his wife his friend again, and restored
his domestic peace. In how many thousand instances is the same effect produced in a still more
striking manner, though on a less conspicuous stage, than in the case of this royal pair! And
how many thousands of outwardly prosperous families there are, from which domestic peace and
happiness are gone, and nothing but the pressure from without of affliction or calamity can
ever restore them!

In consequence, in a great measure, of Henrietta's efficient help, the king's affairs greatly
improved, and, for a time, it seemed as if he would gain an ultimate and final victory over
his enemies, and recover his lost dominion. He advanced to Oxford, and made his head quarters
there, and commenced the preparations for once more getting possession of the palaces and fortresses
of London. He called together a Parliament at Oxford; some members came, and were regularly
organized in the two houses of Lords and Commons, while the rest remained at London and continued
their sittings there. Thus there were two governments, two Parliaments, and two capitals in
England, and the whole realm was rent and distracted by the respective claims of these contending
powers over the allegiance of the subjects and the government of the realm.

CHAPTER III.

QUEEN HENRIETTA'S FLIGHT.

The brightening of the prospects in King Charles's affairs which was produced, for a time,
by the queen's vigorous and energetic action, proved to be only a temporary gleam after all.
The clouds and darkness soon returned again, and brooded over his horizon more gloomily than
ever. The Parliament raised and organized new and more powerful armies. The great Republican
general, Oliver Cromwell, who afterward became so celebrated as the Protector in the time of
the Commonwealth, came into the field, and was very successful in all his military plans. Other
Republican generals appeared in all parts of the kingdom, and fought with great determination
and great success, driving the armies of the king before them wherever they moved, and reducing
town after town, and castle after castle, until it began to appear evident that the whole kingdom
would soon fall into their hands.

In the mean time, the family of the queen were very much separated from each other, the children
having been left in various places, exposed each to different privations and dangers. Two or
three of them were in London in the hands of their father's enemies. Mary, the young bride
of the Prince of Orange, was in Holland. Prince Charles, the oldest son, who was now about
fourteen years of age, was at the head of one of his father's armies in the west of England.
Of course, such a boy could not be expected to accomplish any thing as a general, or even to
exercise any real military command. He, however, had his place at the head of a considerable
force, and though there were generals with him to conduct all the operations, and to direct
the soldiery, they were nominally the lieutenants of the prince, and acted, in all cases, in
their young commander's name. Their great duty was, however, after all, to take care of their
charge; and the army which accompanied Charles was thus rather an escort and a guard, to secure
his safety, than a force from which any aid was to be expected in the recovery of the kingdom.

The queen did every thing in her power to sustain the sinking fortunes of her husband, but
in vain. At length, in June, 1644, she found herself unable to continue any longer such warlike
and masculine exposures and toils. It became necessary for her to seek some place of retreat,
where she could enjoy, for a time at least, the quiet and repose now essential to the preservation
of her life. Oxford was no longer a place of safety. The Parliament had ordered her impeachment
on account of her having brought in arms and munitions of war from foreign lands, to disturb,
as they said, the peace of the kingdom. The Parliamentary armies were advancing toward Oxford,
and she was threatened with being shut up and besieged there. She accordingly left Oxford,
and went down to the sea- coast to Exeter, a strongly fortified place, on a hill surrounded
in part by other hills, and very near the sea. There was a palace within the walls, where the
queen thought she could enjoy, for a time at least, the needed seclusion and repose. The king
accompanied her for a few miles on her journey, to a place called Abingdon, which is in the
neighborhood of Oxford, and there the unhappy pair bade each other farewell, with much grief
and many tears. They never met again.

Henrietta continued her sorrowful journey alone. She reached the sea- coast in the south-western
part of England, where Exeter is situated, and shut herself up in the place of her retreat.
She was in a state of great destitution, for Charles's circumstances were now so reduced that
he could afford her very little aid. She sent across the Channel to her friends in France,
asking them to help her. They sent immediately the supplies that she needed--articles of clothing,
a considerable sum of money, and a nurse. She retained the clothing and the nurse, and a little
of the money; the rest she sent to Charles. She was, however, now herself tolerably provided
for in her new home, and here, a few weeks afterward, her sixth child was born. It was a daughter.

The queen's long continued exertions and exposures had seriously impaired her health, and she
lay, feeble and low, in her sick chamber for about ten days, when she learned to her dismay
that one of the Parliamentary generals was advancing at the head of his army to attack the
town which she had made her refuge. This general's name was Essex. The queen sent a messenger
out to meet Essex, asking him to allow her to withdraw from the town before he should invest
it with his armies. She said that she was very weak and feeble, and unable to endure the privations
and alarms which the inhabitants of a besieged town have necessarily to bear; and she asked
his permission, therefore, to retire to Bristol, till her health should be restored. Essex
replied that he could not give her permission to retire from Exeter; that, in fact, the object
of his coming there was to escort her to London, to bring her before Parliament, to answer
to the charge of treason.

The queen perceived immediately that nothing but the most prompt and resolute action could
enable her to escape the impending danger. She had but little bodily strength remaining, but
that little was stimulated and renewed by the mental resolution and energy which, as is usual
in temperaments like hers, burned all the brighter in proportion to the urgency of the danger
which called it into action. She rose from her sick bed, and began to concert measures for
making her escape. She confided her plan to three trusty friends, one gentleman, one lady,
and her confessor, who, as her spiritual teacher and guide, was her constant companion. She
disguised herself and these her attendants, and succeeded in getting through the gates of Exeter
without attracting any observation. This was before Essex arrived. She found, however, before
she went far, that the van of the army was approaching, and she had to seek refuge in a hut
till her enemies had passed. She concealed herself among some straw, her attendants seeking
such other hiding places as were at hand. It was two days before the bodies of soldiery had
all passed so as to make it safe for the queen to come out of her retreat. The hut would seem
to have been uninhabited, as the accounts state that she remained all this time without food,
though this seems to be an almost incredible degree of privation and exposure for an English
queen. At any rate, she remained during all this time in a state of great mental anxiety and
alarm, for there were parties of soldiery constantly going by, with a tumult and noise which
kept her in continual terror. Their harsh and dissonant voices, heard sometimes in angry quarrels
and sometimes in mirth, were always frightful. In fact, for a helpless woman in a situation
like that of the queen, the mood of reckless and brutal mirth in such savages was perhaps more
to be dreaded than that of their anger.

At one time the queen overheard a party of these soldiers talking about her. They knew that
to get possession of the papist queen was the object of their expedition. They spoke of getting
her head and carrying it to London, saying that Parliament had offered a reward of fifty thousand
crowns for it, and expressed the savage pleasure which it would give them to secure this prize,
by imprecations and oaths.

They did not, however, discover their intended victim. After the whole army passed, the queen
ventured cautiously forth from her retreat; the little party got together again, and, still
retaining their disguises, moved on over the road by which the soldiers had come, and which
was in the shocking condition that a road and a country always exhibit where an army has been
marching. Faint and exhausted with sickness, abstinence, and the effects of long continued
anxiety and fear, the queen had scarcely strength to go on. She persevered, however, and at
length found a second refuge in a cabin in a wood. She was going to Plymouth, which is forty
or fifty miles from Exeter, to the south-west, and is the great port and naval station of the
English, in that quarter of the island.

She stopped at this cabin for a little time to rest, and to wait for some other friends and
members of her household from the palace in Exeter to join her. Those friends were to wait
until they found that the queen succeeded in making her escape, and then they were to follow,
each in a different way, and all assuming such disguises as would most effectually help to
conceal them. There was one of the party whom it must have been somewhat difficult to disguise.
It was a dwarf, named Geoffrey Hudson, who had been a long time in the service of Henrietta
as a personal attendant and messenger. It was the fancy of queens and princesses in those days
to have such personages in their train. The oddity of the idea pleased them, and the smaller
the dimensions of such a servitor, the greater was his value. In modern times all this is changed.
Tall footmen now, in the families of the great, receive salaries in proportion to the number
of inches in their stature, and the dwarfs go to the museums, to be exhibited, for a price,
to the common wonder of mankind.

The manner in which Sir Geoffrey Hudson was introduced into the service of the queen was as
odd as his figure. It was just after she was married, and when she was about eighteen years
old. She had two dwarfs then already, a gentleman and a lady, or, as they termed it then, a
cavalier and a dame, and, to carry out the whimsical idea, she had arranged a match between
these two, and had them married. Now there was in her court at that time a wild and thoughtless
nobleman, a great friend and constant companion of her husband Charles the First, named Buckingham.
An account of his various exploits is given in our history of Charles the First. Buckingham
happened to hear of this Geoffrey Hudson, who was then a boy of seven or eight years of age,
living with his parents somewhere in the interior of England. He sent for him, and had him
brought secretly to his house, and made an arrangement to have him enter the service of the
queen, without, however, saying any thing of his design to her. He then invited the queen and
her husband to visit him at his palace; and when the time for luncheon arrived, one day, he
conducted the party into the dining saloon to partake of some refreshment. There was upon the
table, among other viands, what appeared to be a large venison pie. The company gathered around
the table, and a servant proceeded to cut the pie, and on his breaking and raising a piece
of the crust, out stepped the young dwarf upon the table, splendidly dressed and armed, and,
advancing toward the queen, he kneeled before her, and begged to be received into her train.
Her majesty was very much pleased with the addition itself thus made to her household, as well
as diverted by the odd manner in which her new attendant was introduced into her service.

The youthful dwarf was then only eighteen inches high, and he continued so until he was thirty
years of age, when, to every body's surprise, he began to grow. He grew quite rapidly, and,
for a time, there was a prospect that he would be entirely spoiled, as his whole value had
consisted thus far in his littleness. He attained the height of three feet and a half, and
there the mysterious principle of organic expansion, the most mysterious and inexplicable,
perhaps, that is exhibited in all the phenomena of life, seemed to be finally exhausted, and,
though he lived to be nearly seventy years of age, he grew no more.

Notwithstanding the bodily infirmity, whatever it may have been, which prevented his growth,
the dwarf possessed a considerable degree of mental capacity and courage. He did not bear,
however, very good- naturedly, the jests and gibes of which he was the continual object, from
the unfeeling courtiers, who often took pleasure in teasing him and in getting him into all
sorts of absurd and ridiculous situations. At last his patience was entirely exhausted, and
he challenged one of his tormentors, whose name was Crofts, to a duel. Crofts accepted the
challenge, and, being determined to persevere in his fun to the end, appeared on the battle
ground armed only with a squirt. This raised a laugh, of course, but it did not tend much to
cool the injured Lilliputian's anger. He sternly insisted on another meeting, and with real
weapons. Crofts had expected to have turned off the whole affair in a joke, but he found this
could not be done; and public opinion among the courtiers around him compelled him finally
to accept the challenge in earnest. The parties met on horseback, to put them more nearly on
an equality. They fought with pistols. Crofts was killed upon the spot.

After this Hudson was treated with more respect. He was entrusted by the queen with many commissions,
and sometimes business was committed to him which required no little capacity, judgment, and
courage. He was now, at the time of the queen's escape from Exeter, of his full stature, but
as this was only three and a half feet, he encountered great danger in attempting to find his
way out of the city and through the advancing columns of the army to rejoin the queen. He persevered,
however, and reached her safely at last in the cabin in the wood. The babe, not yet two weeks
old, was necessarily left behind. She was left in charge of Lady Morton, whom the queen appointed
her governess. Lady Morton was young and beautiful. She was possessed of great strength and
energy of character, and she devoted herself with her whole soul to preserving the life and
securing the safety of her little charge.

The queen and her party had to traverse a wild and desolate forest, many miles in extent, on
the way to Plymouth. The name of it was Dartmoor Forest. Lonely as it was, however, the party
was safer in it than in the open and inhabited country, which was all disturbed and in commotion,
as every country necessarily is in time of civil war. As the queen drew near to Plymouth, she
found that, for some reason, it would not be safe to enter that town, and so the whole party
went on, continuing their journey farther to the westward still.

Now there is one important sea-port to the westward of Plymouth which is called Falmouth, and
near it, on a high promontory jutting into the sea, is a large and strong castle, called Pendennis
Castle. This castle was, at the time of the queen's escape, in the hands of the king's friends,
and she determined, accordingly, to seek refuge there. The whole party arrived here safely
on the 29th of June. They were all completely worn out and exhausted by the fatigues, privations,
and exposures of their terrible journey.

The queen had determined to make her escape as soon as possible to France. She could no longer
be of any service to the king in England; her resources were exhausted, and her personal health
was so feeble that she must have been a burden to his cause, and not a help, if she had remained.
There was a ship from Holland in the harbor. The Prince of Orange, it will be recollected,
who had married the queen's oldest daughter, was a prince of Holland, and this vessel was under
his direction. Some writers say it was sent to Falmouth by him to be ready for his mother-in-law,
in case she should wish to make her escape from England. Others speak of it as being there
accidentally at this time. However this may be, it was immediately placed at Queen Henrietta's
disposal, and she determined to embark in it on the following morning. She knew very well that,
as soon as Essex should have heard of her escape, parties would be scouring the country in
all directions in pursuit of her, and that, although the castle where she had found a temporary
refuge was strong, it was not best to incur the risk of being shut up and besieged in it.

She accordingly embarked, with all her company, on board the Dutch ship on the very morning
after her arrival, and immediately put to sea. They made all sail for the coast of France,
intending to land at Dieppe. Dieppe is almost precisely east of Falmouth, two or three hundred
miles from it, up the English Channel. As it is on the other side of the Channel, it would
lie to the south of Falmouth, were it not that both the French and English coasts trend here
to the northward.

Some time before they arrived at their port, they perceived some ships in the offing that seemed
to be pursuing them. They endeavored to escape, but their pursuers gained rapidly upon them,
and at length fired a gun as a signal for the queen's vessel to stop. The ball came bounding
over the water toward them, but did no harm. Of course there was a scene of universal commotion
and panic on board the queen's ship. Some wanted to fire back upon the pursuers, some wished
to stop and surrender, and others shrieked and cried, and were overwhelmed with uncontrollable
emotions of terror.

In the midst of this dreadful scene of confusion, the queen, as was usual with her in such
emergencies, retained all her self-possession, and though weak and helpless before, felt a
fresh strength and energy now, which the imminence itself of the danger seemed to inspire.
She was excited, it is true, as well as the rest, but it was, in her case, the excitement of
courage and resolution, and not of senseless terror and despair. She ascended to the deck;
she took the direct command of the ship; she gave instructions to the pilot how to steer; and,
though there was a storm coming on, she ordered every sail to be set, that the ship might be
driven as rapidly as possible through the water. She forbade the captain to fire back upon
their pursuers, fearing that such firing would occasion delay; and she gave distinct and positive
orders to the captain, that so soon as it should appear that all hope of escape was gone, and
that they must inevitably fall into the hands of their enemies, he was to set fire to the magazine
of gunpowder, in order that they might all be destroyed by the explosion.

In the mean time all the ships, pursuers and pursued, were rapidly nearing the French coast.
The fugitives were hoping to reach their port. They were also hoping every moment to see some
friendly French ships appear in sight to rescue them. To balance this double hope, there was
a double fear. There were their pursuers behind them, whose shots were continually booming
over the water, threatening them with destruction, and there was a storm arising which, with
the great press of sail that they were carrying, brought with it a danger, perhaps, more imminent
still.

It happened that these hopes and fears were all realized, and nearly at the same time. A shot
struck the ship, producing a great shock, and throwing all on board into terrible consternation.
It damaged the rigging, bringing down the rent sails and broken cordage to the deck, and thus
stopped the vessel's way. At the same moment some French vessels came in sight, and, as soon
as they understood the case, bore down full sail to rescue the disabled vessel. The pursuers,
changing suddenly their pursuit to flight, altered their course and moved slowly away. The
storm, however, increased, and, preventing them from making the harbor of Dieppe, drove them
along the shore, threatening every moment to dash them upon the rocks and breakers. At length
the queen's vessel succeeded in getting into a rocky cove, where they were sheltered from the
winds and waves, and found a chance to land. The queen ordered out the boat, and was set ashore
with her attendants on the rocks. She climbed over them, wet as they were with the dashing
spray, and slippery with sea weed. The little party, drenched with the rain, and exhausted
and forlorn, wandered along the shore till they came to a little village of fishermen's huts.
The queen went into the first wretched cabin which offered itself, and lay down upon the straw
in the corner for rest and sleep.

The tidings immediately spread all over the region that the Queen of England had landed on
the coast, and produced, of course, universal excitement. The gentry in the neighborhood flocked
down the next morning, in their carriages, to offer Henrietta their aid. They supplied her
wants, invited her to their houses, and offered her their equipages to take her wherever she
should decide to go. What she wanted was seclusion and rest. When bed-time came, a ladder was
placed against a sort of high platform along one side of the kitchen; we mounted and found
a bed, concealed from the view of those below by a dusty muslin curtain. We lay there, between
heaven and earth--the dirty earth of the brick floor and the sooty heaven of the ceiling--listening
until midnight to the boisterous songs, and loud, angry disputes in the room adjoining. Thus
ended our first day in Lyons.

Five weary days, each of them containing a month of torturing suspense, have since passed. Our lodging-place
grew so unpleasant that we preferred wandering all day through the misty, muddy, smoky streets,
taking refuge in the covered bazaars when it rained heavily. The gloom of every thing around
us, entirely smothered down the lightness of heart which made us laugh over our embarrassments
at Vienna. When at evening, the dull, leaden hue of the clouds seemed to make the air dark and cold
and heavy, we walked beside the swollen and turbid Rhone, under an avenue of leafless trees, the
damp soil chilling our feet and striking a numbness through our frames,
and then I knew what those must feel who have no hope in their destitution,
and not a friend in all the great world, who is not wretched as themselves.

I prize the lesson, though the price of it is hard.

"This morning," I said to B----, "will terminate our suspense." I felt cheerful in spite of myself;
and this was like a presentiment of coming good luck. To pass the time till the mail arrived
we climbed to the chapel of Fourvières, whose walls are covered with votive offerings to a miraculous
picture of the Virgin.

But at the precise hour we were at the Post Office.

What an intensity of suspense can be felt in that minute, while the
clerk is looking over the letters!

And what a lightning-like shock of joy when it did come, and was opened with eager, trembling
hands, revealing the relief we had almost despaired of! The city did not seem less gloomy, for
that was impossible, but the faces of the crowd which had appeared cold and suspicious, were
now kind and cheerful. we came home to our lodgings with changed feelings, and Madame Ferrand
must have seen the joy in our faces, for she greeted us with an unusual smile.

We leave to-morrow morning for Chalons. I do not feel disposed to describe Lyons particularly, although
I have become intimately acquainted with every part of it, from Presqu' isle Perrache to Croix Rousse.
I know the contents of every shop in the Bazaar, and the passage of the Hotel Dieu--the title
of every volume in the bookstores in the Place Belcour--and the countenance of every boot-block and
apple-woman on the Quais on both sides of the river. I have walked up the Saone to Pierre Seise--down
the Rhone to his muddy marriage--climbed the Heights of Fourvières, and promenaded in the Cours
Napoleon! Why, men have been presented with the freedom of cities, when they have had far less
cause for such an honor than this!

CHAPTER XLIV.
TRAVELING IN BURGUNDY--THE MISERIES OF A COUNTRY DILIGENCE.

Paris,
Feb. 6, 1840.--Every letter of the date is traced with an emotion
of joy, for our dreary journey is over. They were entrusted to
the charge of some of the nobility, and lived in one of the London palaces. James was a very
thoughtful and considerate boy, and had been enough with his father in his campaigns to understand
something of the terrible dangers with which the family were surrounded. The other children
were too young to know or care about them, and played blindman's buff and hide and go seek
in the great saloons of the palace with as much infantile glee as if their father and mother
were as safe and happy as ever.

Though they felt thus no uneasiness and anxiety for themselves, their exiled mother mourned
for them, and was oppressed by the most foreboding fears for their personal safety. She thought,
however, still more frequently of the babe, and felt a still greater solicitude for her, left
as she had been, at so exceedingly tender an age, in a situation of the most extreme and imminent
danger. She felt somewhat guilty in having yielded her reluctant consent, for political reasons,
to have her other children educated in what she believed a false system of religious faith,
and she now prayed earnestly to God to spare the life of this her last and dearest child, and
vowed in her anguish that, if the babe were ever restored to her, she would break through all
restrictions, and bring her up a true believer. This vow she afterward earnestly fulfilled.

The child, it will be recollected, was left, when Henrietta escaped from Exeter, in the care
of the Countess of Morton, a young and beautiful, and also a very intelligent and energetic
lady. The child had a visit from its father soon after its mother left it. King Charles, as
soon as he heard that Essex was advancing to besiege Exeter, where he knew that the queen had
sought refuge, and was, of course, exposed to fall into his power, hastened with an army to
her rescue. He arrived in time to prevent Essex from getting possession of the place. He, in
fact, drove the besieger away from the town, and entered it himself in triumph. The queen was
gone, but he found the child.

The king gazed upon the little stranger with a mixture of joy and sorrow. He caused it to be
baptized, and named it Henrietta Anne. The name Henrietta was from the mother; Anne was the
name of Henrietta's sister-in-law in Paris, who had been very kind to her in all her troubles.
The king made ample arrangements for supplying Lady Morton with money out of the revenues of
the town of Exeter, and, thinking that the child would be as safe in Exeter as any where, left
her there, and went away to resume again his desperate conflicts with his political foes.

Lady Morton remained for some time at Exeter, but the king's cause every where declined. His
armies were conquered, his towns were taken, and he was compelled at last to give himself up
a prisoner. Exeter, as well as all the other strongholds in the kingdom, fell into the hands
of the parliamentary armies. They sent Lady Morton and the little Henrietta to London, and
soon afterward provided them with a home in the mansion at Oatlands, where the queen herself
and her other children had lived before. It was a quiet and safe retreat, but Lady Morton was
very little satisfied with the plan of remaining there. She wished very much to get the babe
back to its mother again in Paris. She heard, at length, of rumors that a plan was forming
by the Parliament to take the child out of her charge, and she then resolved to attempt an
escape at all hazards.

Henrietta Anne was now two years old, and was beginning to talk a little. When asked what was
her name, they had taught her to attempt to reply princess, though she did not succeed in uttering
more than the first letters of the word, her answer being, in fact, prah. Lady Morton conceived
the idea of making her escape across the country in the disguise of a beggar woman, changing,
at the same time, the princess into a boy. She was herself very tall, and graceful, and beautiful,
and it was hard for her to make herself look old and ugly. She, however, made a hump for her
back out of a bundle of linen, and stooped in her gait to counterfeit age. She dressed herself
in soiled and ragged clothes, disfigured her face by reversing the contrivances with which
ladies in very fashionable life are said sometimes to produce artificial youth and beauty,
and with the child in a bundle on her back, and a staff in her hand, she watched for a favorable
opportunity to escape stealthily from the palace, in the forlorn hope of walking in that way
undetected to Dover, a march of fifty miles, through a country filled with enemies.

Little Henrietta was to be a boy, and as people on the way might ask the child its name, Lady
Morton was obliged to select one for her which would fit, in some degree, her usual reply to
such a question. She chose the name Pierre, which sounds, at least, as much like prah as princess
does. The poor child, though not old enough to speak distinctly, was still old enough to talk
a great deal. She was very indignant at the vile dress which she was compelled to wear, and
at being called a beggar boy. She persisted in telling every body whom she met that she was
not a boy, nor a beggar, nor Pierre, but the princess saying it all, however, very fortunately,
in such an unintelligible way, that it only alarmed Lady Morton, without, however, attracting
the attention of those who heard it, or giving them any information.

Contrary to every reasonable expectation, Lady Morton succeeded in her wild and romantic attempt.
She reached Dover in safety. She made arrangements for crossing in the packet boat, which then,
as now, plied from Dover to Calais. She landed at length safely on the French coast, where
she threw off her disguise, resumed her natural grace and beauty, made known her true name
and character, and traveled in ease and safety to Paris. The excitement and the intoxicating
joy which Henrietta experienced when she got her darling child once more in her arms, can be
imagined, perhaps, even by the most sedate American mother; but the wild and frantic violence
of her expressions of it, none but those who are conversant with the French character and French
manners can know.

It was not very far from the time of little Henrietta's escape from her father's enemies in
London, though, in fact, before it, that Prince Charles made his escape from the island too.
His father, finding that his cause was becoming desperate, gave orders to those who had charge
of his son to retreat to the southwestern coast of the island, and if the Republican armies
should press hard upon him there, he was to make his escape, if necessary, by sea.

The southwestern part of England is a long, mountainous promontory, constituting the county
of Cornwall. It is a wild and secluded region, and the range which forms it seems to extend
for twenty or thirty miles under the sea, where it rises again to the surface, forming a little
group of islands, more wild and rugged even than the land. These are the Scilly Isles. They
lie secluded and solitary, and are known chiefly to mankind through the ships that seek shelter
among them in storms. Prince Charles retreated from post to post through Cornwall, the danger
becoming more and more imminent every day, till at last it became necessary to fly from the
country altogether. He embarked on board a vessel, and went first to the Scilly Isles.

From Scilly he sailed eastward toward the coast of France. He landed first at the island of
Jersey, which, though it is very near the French coast, and is inhabited by a French population,
is under the English government. Here the prince met with a very cordial reception, as the
authorities were strongly attached to his father's cause. Jersey is a beautiful isle and, far
enough south to enjoy a genial climate, where flowers bloom and fruits ripen in the warm sunbeams,
which are here no longer intercepted by the driving mists and rains which sweep almost perceptibly
along the hill sides and fields of England.

Prince Charles did not, however, remain long in Jersey. His destination was Paris. He passed,
therefore, across to the main land, and traveled to the capital. He was received with great
honors at his mother's new home, in the palace of the Louvre, as a royal prince, and heir apparent
to the British crown. He was now sixteen. The adventures which he met with on his arrival will
be the subject of the next chapter.

James, the Duke of York, remained still in London. He continued there for two years, during
which time his father's affairs went totally to ruin. The unfortunate king, after his armies
were all defeated, and his cause was finally given up by his friends, and he had surrendered
himself a prisoner to his enemies, was taken from castle to castle, every where strongly guarded
and very closely confined. At length, worn down with privations and sufferings, and despairing
of all hope of relief, he was taken to London to be tried for his life. James, in the mean
time, with his brother, the little Duke of Gloucester, and his sister Elizabeth, were kept
in St. James's Palace, as has already been stated, under the care of an officer to whom they
had been given in charge.

The queen was particularly anxious to have James make his escape. He was older than the others,
and in case of the death of Charles, would be, of course, the next heir to the crown. He did,
in fact, live till after the close of his brother's reign, and succeeded him, under the title
of James the Second. His being thus in the direct line of succession made his father and mother
very desirous of effecting his rescue, while the Parliament were strongly desirous, for the
same reason, of keeping him safely. His governor received, therefore, a special charge to take
the most effectual precautions to prevent his escape, and, for this purpose, not to allow of
his having any communication whatever with his parents or his absent friends. The governor
took all necessary measures to prevent such intercourse, and, as an additional precaution,
made James promise that he would not receive any letter from any person unless it came through him.

James's mother, however, not knowing these circumstances, wrote a letter to him, and sent it
by a trusty messenger, directing him to watch for some opportunity to deliver it unobserved.
Now there is a certain game of ball, called tennis, which was formerly a favorite amusement
in England and on the Continent of Europe, and which, in fact, continues to be played there
still. It requires an oblong enclosure, surrounded by high walls, against which the balls rebound.
Such an enclosure is called a tennis court. It was customary to build such tennis courts in
most of the royal palaces. There was one at St. James's Palace, where the young James, it seems,
used sometimes to play. [Footnote: It was to such a tennis court at Versailles that the great
National Assembly of France adjourned when the king excluded them from their hall, at the commencement
of the great Revolution, and where they took the famous oath not to separate till they had
established a constitution, which has been so celebrated in history as the Oath of the Tennis
Court.] Strangers had the opportunity of seeing the young prince in his coming and going to
and from this place of amusement, and the queen's messenger determined to offer him the letter
there. He accordingly tendered it to him stealthily, as he was passing, saying, "Take this;
it is from your mother."

James drew back, replying, "I can not take it. I have promised that I will not."

The messenger reported to the queen that he offered the letter to James, and that he refused
to receive it. His mother was very much displeased, and wondered what such a strange refusal
could mean.

Although James thus failed to receive his communication, he was allowed at length, once or
twice, to have an interview with his father, and in these interviews the king recommended to
him to make his escape, if he could, and to join his mother in France. James determined to
obey this injunction, and immediately set to work to plan his escape. He was fifteen years
of age, and, of course, old enough to exercise some little invention.

He was accustomed, as we have already stated, to join the younger children in games of hide
and go seek. He began now to search for the most recondite hiding places, where he could not
be found, and when he had concealed himself in such a place, he would remain there for a very
long time, until his playmates had given up the search in despair. Then, at length, after having
been missing for half an hour, he would reappear of his own accord. He thought that by this
plan he should get the children and the attendants accustomed to his being for a long time
out of sight, so that, when at length he should finally disappear, their attention would not
be seriously attracted to the circumstance until he should have had time to get well set out
upon his journey.

He had, like his mother, a little dog, but, unlike her, he was not so strongly attached to
it as to be willing to endanger his life to avoid a separation. When the time arrived, therefore,
to set out on his secret journey, he locked the dog up in his room, to prevent its following
him, and thus increasing the probability of his being recognized and brought back. He then
engaged his brother and sister and his other playmates in the palace in a game of hide and
go seek. He went off ostensibly to hide, but, instead of doing so, he stole out of the palace
gates in company with a friend named Banfield, and a footman. It was in the rear of the palace
that he made his exit, at a sort of postern gate, which opened upon an extensive park. After
crossing the park, the party hurried on through London, and then directed their course down
the River Thames toward Gravesend, a port near the mouth of the river, where they intended
to embark for Holland. They had taken the precaution to disguise themselves. James wore a wig,
which, changing the color and appearance of his hair, seemed to give a totally new expression
to his face. He substituted other clothes, too, for those which he was usually accustomed to
wear. The whole party succeeded thus in traversing the country without detection. They reached
Gravesend, embarked on board a vessel there, and sailed to Holland, where James joined the
Prince of Orange and his sister, and sent word to his mother that he had arrived there in safety.

His little brother and sister were left behind. They were too young to fly themselves, and
too old to be conveyed away, as little Henrietta had been, in the arms of another. They had,
however, the mournful satisfaction of seeing their father just before his execution, and of
bidding him a last farewell. The king, when he was condemned to die, begged to be allowed to
see these children. They were brought to visit him in the chamber where he was confined. His
parting interview with them, and the messages of affection and farewell which he sent to their
brothers and sisters, and to their mother, constitute one of the most affecting scenes which
the telescope of history brings to our view, in that long and distant vista of the past, which
it enables us so fully to explore. The little Gloucester was too young to understand the sorrows
of the hour, but Elizabeth felt them in all their intensity. She was twelve years old. When
brought to her father, she burst into tears, and wept long and bitterly. Her little brother,
sympathizing in his sister's sorrow, though not comprehending its cause, wept bitterly too.
Elizabeth was thoughtful enough to write an account of what took place at this most solemn
farewell as soon as it was over. Her account is as follows:

"What the king said to me on the 29th of January, 1648, the last time I had the happiness to
see him.

"He told me that he was glad I was come, for, though he had not time to say much, yet somewhat
he wished to say to me, which he could not to another, and he had feared 'the cruelty' was
too great to permit his writing. 'But, darling,' he added, 'thou wilt forget what I tell thee.'
Then, shedding an abundance of tears, I told him that I would write down all he said to me.
'He wished me,' he said, 'not to grieve and torment myself for him, for it was a glorious death
he should die, it being for the laws and religion of the land.' He told me what books to read
against popery. He said 'that he had forgiven all his enemies, and he hoped God would forgive
them also;' and he commanded us, and all the rest of my brothers and sisters, to forgive them
too. Above all, he bade me tell my mother 'that his thoughts had never strayed from her, and
that his love for her would be the same to the last;' withal, he commanded me (and my brother)
to love her and be obedient to her. He desired me 'not to grieve for him, for he should die
a martyr, and that he doubted not but God would restore the throne to his son, and that then
we should be all happier than we could possibly have been if he had lived.'

"Then taking my brother Gloucester on his knee, he said, 'Dear boy, now will they cut off thy
father's head.' Upon which the child looked very steadfastly upon him. 'Heed, my child, what
I say; they will cut off my head, and perhaps make thee a king; but, mark what I say! You must
not be a king as long as your brothers Charles and James live; therefore, I charge you, do
not be made a king by them.' At which the child, sighing deeply, replied, 'I will be torn in
pieces first.' And these words, coining so unexpectedly from so young a child, rejoiced my
father exceedingly. And his majesty spoke to him of the welfare of his soul, and to keep his
religion, commanding him to fear God, and he would provide for him; all which the young child
earnestly promised to do."

After the king's death the Parliament kept these children in custody for some time, and at
last they became somewhat perplexed to know what to do with them. It was even proposed, when
Cromwell's Republican government had become fully established, to bind them out apprentices,
to learn some useful trade. This plan was, however, not carried into effect. They were held
as prisoners, and sent at last to Carisbrooke Castle, where their father had been confined.
Little Henry, too young to understand his sorrows, grew in strength and stature, like any other
boy; but Elizabeth pined and sunk under the burden of her woes. She mourned incessantly her
father's cruel death, her mother's and her brother's exile, and her own wearisome and hopeless
captivity. "Little Harry", as she called him, and a Bible, which her father gave her in his
last interview with her, were her only companions. She lingered along for two years after her
father's death, until at length the hectic flush, the signal of approaching dissolution, appeared
upon her cheek, and an unnatural brilliancy brightened in her eyes. They sent her father's
physician to see if he could save her. His prescriptions did no good. One day the attendants
came into her apartment and found her sitting in her chair, with her cheek resting upon the
Bible which she had been reading, and which she had placed for a sort of pillow on the table,
to rest her weary head upon when her reading was done. She was motionless. They would have
thought her asleep, but her eyes were not closed. She was dead. The poor child's sorrows and
sufferings were ended forever.

The stern Republicans who now held dominion over England, men of iron as they were, could not
but be touched with the unhappy fate of this their beautiful and innocent victim; and they
so far relented from the severity of the policy which they had pursued toward the ill-fated
family as to send the little Gloucester, after his sister's death, home to his mother.

CHAPTER V.

THE PRINCE'S RECEPTION AT PARIS.

So complicated a story as that of the family of Charles can not be related, in all its parts,
in the exact order of time; and having now shown under what circumstances the various members
of the family made their escape from the dangers which threatened them in England, we return
to follow the adventures of Prince Charles during his residence on the Continent, and, more
particularly in this chapter, to describe his reception by the royal family of France. He was
one of the first of the children that escaped, having arrived in France in 1646. His father
was not beheaded until two years afterward.

In order that the reader may understand distinctly the situation in which Charles found himself
on his arrival at Paris, we must first describe the condition of the royal family of France
at this time. They resided sometimes at Fontainebleau, a splendid palace in the midst of a
magnificent park about forty miles from the city. Henrietta, it will be recollected, was the
sister of a king of France. This king was Louis XIII. He died, however, not far from the time
of Queen Henrietta's arrival in the country, leaving his little son Louis, then five years
old, heir to the crown. The little Louis of course became king immediately, in name, as Louis
XIV., and in the later periods of his life he attained to so high a degree of prosperity and
power, that he has been, ever since his day, considered one of the most renowned of all the
French kings. He was, of course, Prince Charles's cousin. At the period of Prince Charles's
arrival, however, he was a mere child, being then about eight years old. Of course, he was
too young really to exercise any of the powers of the government. His mother, Anne of Austria,
was made regent, and authorized to govern the country until the young king should arrive at
a suitable age to exercise his hereditary powers in his own name. Anne of Austria had been
always very kind to Henrietta, and had always rendered her assistance whenever she had been
reduced to any special extremity of distress. It was she who had sent the supplies of money
and clothing to Henrietta when she fled, sick and destitute, to Exeter, vainly hoping to find
repose and the means of restoration there.

Besides King Louis XIII., who had died, Henrietta had another brother, whose name was Gaston,
duke of Orleans. The Duke of Orleans had a daughter, who was styled the Duchess of Montpensier,
deriving the title from her mother. She was, of course, also a cousin of Prince Charles. Her
father, being brother of the late king, and uncle of the present one, was made lieutenant general
of the kingdom, having thus the second place, that is, the place next to the queen, in the
management of the affairs of the realm. Thus the little king commenced his reign by having
in his court his mother as queen regent, his uncle lieutenant general, and his aunt, an exiled
queen from a sister realm, his guest. He had also in his household his brother Philip, younger
than himself, his cousin the young Duchess of Montpensier, and his cousin the Prince Charles.
The family relationship of all these individuals will be made more clear by being presented
in a tabular form, as follows:

ROYAL FAMILY OF FRANCE IN THE TIME OF LOUIS XIV.

          Louis XIII.                   Louis XIV.
          Anne of Austria.              Philip, 8 years old.

HENRY IV  Gaston, duke of Orleans.      Duchess of Montpensier Duchess of Montpensier.

          Henrietta Maria.              Prince Charles, 16.
          King Charles I.

In the above table, the first column contains the name of Henry IV., the second those of three
of his children, with the persons whom they respectively married, and the third the four grandchildren,
who, as cousins, now found themselves domesticated together in the royal palaces of France.

The young king was, as has already been said, about eight years old at the time of Prince Charles's
arrival. The palace in which he resided when in the city was the Palace Royal, which was then,
and has been ever since, one of the most celebrated buildings in the world. It was built at
an enormous expense, during a previous reign, by a powerful minister of state, who was, in
ecclesiastical rank, a cardinal, and his mansion was named, accordingly, the Palace Cardinal.
It had, however, been recently taken as a royal residence, and its name changed to Palace Royal.
Here the queen regent had her grand apartments of state, every thing being as rich as the most
lavish expenditure could make it. She had one apartment, called an oratory, a sort of closet
for prayer, which was lighted by a large window, the sash of which was made of silver. The
interior of the room was ornamented with the most costly paintings and furniture, and was enriched
with a profusion of silver and gold. The little king had his range of apartments too, with
a whole household of officers and attendants as little as himself. These children were occupied
continually with ceremonies, and pageants, and mock military parades, in which they figured
in miniature arms and badges of authority, and with dresses made to imitate those of real monarchs
and ministers of state. Every thing was regulated with the utmost regard to etiquette and punctilio,
and without any limits or bounds to the expense. Thus, though the youthful officers of the
little monarch's household exercised no real power, they displayed all the forms and appearances
of royalty with more than usual pomp and splendor. It was a species of child's play, it is
true, but it was probably the most grand and magnificent child's play that the world has ever
witnessed. It was into this extraordinary scene that Prince Charles found himself ushered on
his arrival in France.

At the time of the prince's arrival the court happened to be residing, not at Paris, but at
Fontainebleau. Fontainebleau, as has already been stated, is about forty miles from Paris,
to the southward. There is a very splendid palace and castle there, built originally in very
ancient times. There is a town near, both the castle and the town being in the midst of a vast
park and forest, one of the most extended and magnificent royal domains in Europe. This forest
has been reserved as a hunting ground for the French kings from a very early age. It covers
an area of forty thousand acres, being thus many miles in extent. The royal family were at
this palace at the time of Prince Charles's arrival, celebrating the festivities of a marriage.
The prince accordingly, as we shall presently see, went there to join them.

There were two persons who were anticipating the prince's arrival in France with special interest,
his mother, and his young cousin, the Duchess of Montpensier. Her Christian name was Anne Marie
Louisa. [Footnote: She is commonly called, in the annals of the day in which she lived, Mademoiselle,
as she was, par eminence, the young lady of the court. In history she is commonly called Mademoiselle
de Montpensier; we shall call her, in this narrative, simply Anne Maria, as that is, for our
purpose, the most convenient designation.] She was a gay, frivolous, and coquettish girl, of
about nineteen, immensely rich, being the heiress of the vast estates of her mother, who was
not living. Her father, though he was the lieutenant general of the realm, and the former king's
brother, was not rich. His wife, when she died, had bequeathed all her vast estates to her
daughter Anne Maria was naturally haughty and vain, and; as her father was accustomed to come
occasionally to her to get supplies of money, she was made vainer and more self-conceited still
by his dependence upon her. Several matches had been proposed to her, and among them the Emperor
of Germany had been named. He was a widower. His first wife, who had been Anne Maria's aunt,
had just died. As the emperor was a potentate of great importance, the young belle thought
she should prefer him to any of the others who had been proposed, and she made no secret of
this her choice. It is true that he had made no proposal to her, but she presumed that he would
do so after a suitable time had elapsed from the death of his first wife, and Anne Maria was
contented to wait, considering the lofty elevation to which she would attain on becoming his bride.

But Queen Henrietta Maria had another plan. She was very desirous to obtain Anne Maria for
the wife of her son Charles. There were many reasons for this. The young lady was a princess
of the royal family of France; she possessed, too, an immense fortune, and was young and beautiful
withal, though not quite so young as Charles himself. He was sixteen, and she was about nineteen.
It is true that Charles was now, in some sense, a fugitive and an exile, destitute of property,
and without a home. Still he was a prince. He was the heir apparent of the kingdoms of England
and Scotland. He was young and accomplished. These high qualifications, somewhat exaggerated,
perhaps, by maternal partiality, seemed quite sufficient to Henrietta to induce the proud duchess
to become the prince's bride.

All this, it must be remembered, took place before the execution of King Charles the First,
and when, of course, the fortunes of the family were not so desperate as they afterward became.
Queen Henrietta had a great many conversations with Anne Maria before the prince arrived, in
which she praised very highly his person and his accomplishments. She narrated to the duchess
the various extraordinary adventures and the narrow escapes which the prince had met with in
the course of his wanderings in England; she told her how dutiful and kind he had been to her
as a son, and how efficient and courageous in his father's cause as a soldier. She described
his appearance and his manners, and foretold how he would act, what tastes and preferences
he would form, and how he would be regarded in the French court. The young duchess listened
to all this with an appearance of indifference and unconcern, which was partly real and partly
only assumed. She could not help feeling some curiosity to see her cousin, but her head was
too full of the grander destination of being the wife of the emperor to think much of the pretensions
of this wandering and homeless exile.

Prince Charles, on his arrival, went first to Paris, where he found his mother. There was an
invitation for them here to proceed to Fontainebleau, where, as has already been stated, the
young king and his court were now residing. They went there accordingly, and were received
with every mark of attention and honor. The queen regent took the young king into the carriage
of state, and rode some miles along the avenue, through the forest, to meet the prince and
his mother when they were coming. They were attended with the usual cortege of carriages and
horsemen, and they moved with all the etiquette and ceremony proper to be observed in the reception
of royal visitors.

When the carriages met in the forest, they stopped, and the distinguished personages contained
in them alighted. Queen Henrietta introduced her son to the queen regent and to Louis, the
French king, and also to other personages of distinction who were in their train. Among them
was Anne Maria. The queen regent took Henrietta and the prince into the carriage with her and
the young king, and they proceeded thus together back to the palace. Prince Charles was somewhat
embarrassed in making all these new acquaintances, in circumstances, too, of so much ceremony
and parade, and the more so, as his knowledge of the French language was imperfect. He could
understand it when spoken, but could not speak it well himself, and he appeared, accordingly,
somewhat awkward and confused. He seemed particularly at a loss in his intercourse with Anne
Maria. She was a little older than himself, and, being perfectly at home, both in the ceremonies
of the occasion and in the language of the company, she felt entirely at her ease herself;
and yet, from her natural temperament and character, she assumed such an air and bearing as
would tend to prevent the prince from being so. In a word, it happened then as it has often
happened since on similar occasions, that the beau was afraid of the belle.

The party returned to the palace. On alighting, the little king gave his hand to his aunt,
the Queen of England, while Prince Charles gave his to the queen regent, and thus the two matrons
were gallanted into the hall. The prince had a seat assigned him on the following day in the
queen regent's drawing room, and was thus regularly instated as an inmate of the royal household.
He remained here several days, and at length the whole party returned to Paris.

Anne Maria, in after years, wrote reminiscences of her early life, which were published after
her death. In this journal she gives an account of her introduction to the young prince, and
of her first acquaintance with him. It is expressed as follows:

"He was only sixteen or seventeen years of age, rather tall, with a fine head, black hair,
a dark complexion, and a tolerably agreeable countenance. But he neither spoke nor understood
French, which was very inconvenient. Nevertheless, every thing was done to amuse him, and,
during the three days that he remained at Fontainebleau, there were hunts and every other sport
which could be commanded in that season. He paid his respects to all the princesses, and I
discovered immediately that the Queen of England wished to persuade me that he had fallen in
love with me. She told me that he talked of me incessantly; that, were she not to prevent it,
he would be in my apartment [Footnote: This means at her residence. The whole suite of rooms
occupied by a family is called, in France, their apartment.] at all hours; that he found me
quite to his taste, and that he was in despair on account of the death of the empress, for
he was afraid that they would seek to marry me to the emperor. I listened to all she said as
became me, but it did not have as much effect upon me as probably she wished."

After spending a few days at Fontainebleau, the whole party returned to Paris, and Queen Henrietta
and the prince took up their abode again in the Palace Royal, or, as it is now more commonly
called, the Palais Royal. Charles was much impressed with the pomp and splendor of the French
court, so different from the rough mode of life to which he had been accustomed in his campaigns
and wanderings in England. The etiquette and formality, however, were extreme, every thing,
even the minutest motions, being regulated by nice rules, which made social intercourse and
enjoyment one perpetual ceremony. But, notwithstanding all this pomp and splendor, and the
multitude of officers and attendants who were constantly on service, there seems to have been,
in the results obtained, a strange mixture of grand parade with discomfort and disorder. At
one time at Fontainebleau, at a great entertainment, where all the princes and potentates that
had been drawn there by the wedding were assembled, the cooks quarreled in the kitchen, and
one of the courses of the supper failed entirely in consequence of their dissensions; and at
another time, as a large party of visitors were passing out through a suite of rooms in great
state, to descend a grand staircase, where some illustrious foreigners, who were present, were
to take their leave, they found the apartments through which they were to pass all dark. The
servants had neglected or forgotten to light them.

These and similar incidents show that there may be regal luxury and state without order or
comfort, as there may be regal wealth and power without any substantial happiness. Notwithstanding
this, however, Prince Charles soon became strongly interested in the modes of life to which
he was introduced at Paris and at Fontainebleau. There were balls, parties, festivities, and
excursions of pleasure without number, his interest in these all being heightened by the presence
of Anne Maria, whom he soon began to regard with a strong degree of that peculiar kind of interest
which princesses and heiresses inspire. In Anne Maria's memoirs of her early life, we have
a vivid description of many of the scenes in which both she herself and Charles were such prominent
actors. She wrote always with great freedom, and in a very graphic manner, so that the tale
which she tells of this period of her life forms a very entertaining narrative.

Anne Maria gives a very minute account of what took place between herself and Charles on several
occasions in the course of their acquaintance, and describes particularly various balls, and
parties, and excursions of pleasure on which she was attended by the young prince. Her vanity
was obviously gratified by the interest which Charles seemed to take in her, but she was probably
incapable of any feelings of deep and disinterested love, and Charles made no impression upon
her heart. She reserved herself for the emperor.

For example, they were all one night invited to a grand ball by the Duchess de Choisy. This
lady lived in a magnificent mansion, called the Hotel de Choisy. Just before the time came
for the party of visitors to go, the Queen of England came over with Charles to the apartments
of Anne Maria. The queen came ostensibly to give the last touches to the adjustment of the
young lady's dress, and to the arrangement of her hair, but really, without doubt, in pursuance
of her policy of taking every occasion to bring the young people together.

"She came," says Anne Maria, in her narrative, "to dress me and arrange my hair herself. She
came for this purpose to my apartments, and took the utmost pains to set me off to the best
advantage, and the Prince of Wales held the flambeau near me to light my toilet the whole time.
I wore black, white, and carnation; and my jewelry was fastened by ribbons of the same colors.
I wore a plume of the same kind; all these had been selected and ordered by my aunt Henrietta.
The queen regent, who knew that I was in my aunt Henrietta's hands, sent for me to come and
see her when I was all ready, before going to the ball. I accordingly went, and this gave the
prince an opportunity to go at once to the Hotel de Choisy, and be ready there to receive me
when I should arrive I found him there at the door, ready to hand me from my coach. I stopped
in a chamber to readjust my hair, and the Prince of Wales again held a flambeau for me. This
time, too, he brought his cousin, Prince Rupert, as an interpreter between us; for, believe
it who will, though he could understand every word I said to him, he could not reply the least
sentence to me in French. When the ball was finished and we retired, the prince followed me
to the porter's lodge of my hotel, [Footnote: In all the great houses in Paris, the principal
buildings of the edifice stand back from the street, surrounding a court yard, which has sometimes
shrubbery and flowers and a fountain in the center. The entrance to this court yard is by a
great gate and archway on the street, with the apartments occupied by the porter, that is,
the keeper of the gate, on one side. The entrance to the porter's lodge is from under the archway.]
and lingered till I entered, and then went his way.

"There was another occasion on which his gallantry to me attracted a great deal of attention.
It was at a great fete celebrated at the Palais Royal. There was a play acted, with scenery
and music, and then a ball. It took three whole days to arrange my ornaments for this night.
The Queen of England would dress me on this occasion, also, with her own hands. My robe was
all figured with diamonds, with carnation trimmings. I wore the jewels of the crown of France,
and, to add to them, the Queen of England lent me some fine ones of her own, which she had
not then sold. The queen praised the fine turn of my shape, my air, the beauty of my complexion,
and the brightness of my light hair. I had a conspicuous seat in the middle of the ballroom,
with the young King of France and the Prince of Wales at my feet I did not feel the least embarrassed,
for, as I had an idea of marrying the emperor, I regarded the Prince of Wales only as an object
of pity."

Things went on in this way for a time, until at last some political difficulties occurred at
Paris which broke in upon the ordinary routine of the royal family, and drove them, for a time,
out of the city. Before these troubles were over, Henrietta and her son were struck down, as
by a blow, by the tidings, which came upon them like a thunderbolt, that their husband and
father had been beheaded. This dreadful event put a stop for a time to every thing like festive
pleasures. The queen left her children, her palace, and all the gay circle of her friends,
and retired to a convent, to mourn, in solitude and undisturbed, her irreparable loss.

CHAPTER VI.

NEGOTIATIONS WITH ANNE MARIA.

Our Prince Charles now becomes, by the death of his father, King Charles the Second, both of
England and of Scotland. That is, he becomes so in theory, according to the principles of the
English Constitution, though, in fact, he is a fugitive and an exile still. Notwithstanding
his exclusion, however, from the exercise of what he considered his right to reign, he was
acknowledged as king by all true Royalists in England, and by all the continental powers. They
would not aid him to recover his throne, but in the courts and royal palaces which he visited
he was regarded as a king, and was treated, in form at least, with all the consideration and
honor which belonged to royalty. Queen Henrietta was overwhelmed with grief and despair when
she learned the dreadful tidings of the execution of her husband. At the time when these tidings
came to her, she was involved, also, in many other sufferings and trials. As was intimated
in the last chapter, serious difficulties had occurred between the royal family of France and
the government and people of the city of Paris, from which a sort of insurrection had resulted,
and the young king and his mother, together with all the principal personages of the court,
had been compelled to fly from the city, in the night, to save their lives. They went in a
train of twenty or thirty carriages, by torch light, having kept their plan a profound secret
until the moment of their departure. The young king was asleep in his bed until the time arrived,
when they took him up and put him into the carriage. Anne Maria, whose rank and wealth gave
her a great deal of influence and power, took sides, in some degree, with the Parisians in
this contest, so that her aunt, the queen regent, considered her as an enemy rather than a
friend. She, however, took her with them in their flight; but Anne Maria, being very much out
of humor, did all she could to tease and torment the party all the way. When they awoke her
and informed her of their proposed escape from Paris, she was, as she says in her memoirs,
very much delighted, for she knew that the movement was very unwise, and would get her aunt,
the queen regent, and all their friends, into serious difficulties.

She dressed herself as quick as she could, came down stairs, and proceeded to enter the queen
regent's coach, saying that she wanted to have one or the other of certain seats--naming the
best places--as she had no idea, she said, of being exposed to cold, or riding uncomfortably
on such a night. There is not so much evil in man as men would have us believe; and it is a happy
comfort to know and feel this.

Leaving our little inn before day break next morning, we crossed the Sorgues, grown muddy since
its infancy at Vaucluse, like many a young soul, whose mountain purity goes out into the soiling
world and becomes sullied forever. The road passed over broad, barren ranges of hills, and
the landscape was destitute of all interest, till we approached Orange. This city is built at
the foot of a rocky height, a great square projection of which seemed to stand in its midst.
As we approached nearer, however, arches and lines of cornice could be discerned, and we recognized
it as the celebrated amphitheatre, one of the grandest Roman relics in the south of France.

I stood at the foot of this great fabric, and gazed up at it in astonishment.

The exterior wall, three hundred and thirty-four feet in length, and rising to the height of one
hundred and twenty-one feet, is still in excellent, preservation, and through its rows of solid
arches one looks on the broken ranges of seats within. On the crag above, and looking as if about
to topple down on it, is a massive fragment of the fortress of the Princes of Orange, razed by
Louis XIV. Passing through the city, we came to the beautiful Roman triumphal arch, which to
my eye is a finer structure than that of Constantino at Rome. It is built of a rich yellow marble and
highly ornamented with sculptured trophies. From the barbaric shields and the letters MARIO, still
remaining, it has been supposed to commemorate the victory of Marius over the barbarians, near Aix.
A frieze, running along the top, on each side, shows, although broken and much defaced by the
weather, the life and action which once marked the struggling figures.

These Roman ruins, scattered through Provence and Languedoc, though inferior in historical interest,
equal in architectural beauty the greater part of those in the Eternal City itself.

The rest of the day the road was monotonous, though varied somewhat by the tall crags of Mornas
and Mont-dragon, towering over the villages of the same name. Night came on as the rock of
Pierrelatte, at whose foot we were to sleep, appeared in the distance, rising like a Gibraltar
from the plain, and we only reached it in time to escape the rain that came down the valley of
the Rhone.
Next day we passed several companies of soldiers on their way to
Africa. One of them was accompanied by a young girl, apparently the
wife of the recruit by whose side she was marching. She wore the tight
blue jacket of the troop, and a red skirt, reaching to the knees,
over her soldier pantaloons; while her pretty face showed to advantage
beneath a small military cap.

"In a short time my father gave me his room, but as nobody knew I was there, I was awoke in
the night by a noise. I drew back my curtain, and was astonished to find my chamber filled
with men in large buff skin collars, and who appeared surprised to see me, and knew me as little
as I did them. I had no change of linen, and when I wanted any thing washed, it was done in
the night, while I was in bed. I had no women to arrange my hair and dress me, which is very
inconvenient. Still I did not lose my gayety, and they were in admiration at my making no complaint;
and it is true that I am a creature that can make the most of every thing, and am greatly above
trifles."

To feel any commiseration for this young lady, on account of the alarm which she may be supposed
to have experienced at seeing all those strange men in her chamber, would be sympathy thrown
away, for her nerves were not of a sensibility to be affected much by such a circumstance as
that. In fact, as the difficulties between the young king's government and the Parisians increased,
Anne Maria played quite the part of a heroine. She went back and forth to Paris in her carriage,
through the mob, when nobody else dared to go. She sometimes headed troops, and escorted ladies
and gentlemen when they were afraid to go alone. Once she relieved a town, and once she took
the command of the cannon of the Bastille, and issued her orders to fire with it upon the troops,
with a composure which would have done honor to any veteran officer of artillery. We can not
go into all these things here in detail, as they would lead us too far away from the subject
of this narrative. We only allude to them, to give our readers some distinct idea of the temperament
and character of the rich and blooming beauty whom young King Charles was wishing so ardently
to make his bride.

During the time that these difficulties continued in Paris, Queen Henrietta's situation was
extremely unhappy. She was shut up in the palace of the Louvre, which became now her prison
rather than her home. She was separated from the royal family; her son, the king, was generally
absent in Holland or in Jersey, and her palace was often surrounded by mobs; whenever she ventured
out in her carriage, she was threatened with violence and outrage by the populace in such a
manner as to make her retreat as soon as possible to the protection of the palace walls. Her
pecuniary means, too, were exhausted. She sold her jewels, from time to time, as long as they
lasted, and then contracted debts which her creditors were continually pressing her to pay.
Her friends at St. Germain's could not help her otherwise than by asking her to come to them.
This she at last concluded to do, and she made her escape from Paris, under the escort of Anne
Maria, who came to the city for the purpose of conducting her, and who succeeded, though with
infinite difficulty, in securing a safe passage for Henrietta through the crowds of creditors
and political foes who threatened to prevent her journey. These troubles were all, however,
at last settled, and in the autumn (1649) the whole party returned again to Paris.

In the mean time the young King Charles was contriving schemes for getting possession of his
realm. It will be recollected that his sister Mary, who married the Prince of Orange, was at
this time residing at the Hague, a city in Holland, near the sea. Charles went often there.
It was a sort of rendezvous for those who had been obliged to leave England on account of their
attachment to his father's fortunes, and who, now that the father was dead, transferred their
loyalty to the son. They felt a very strong desire that Charles's plans for getting possession
of his kingdom should succeed, and they were willing to do every thing in their power to promote
his success. It must not be supposed, however, that they were governed in this by a disinterested
principle of fidelity to Charles himself personally, or to the justice of his cause. Their
own re-establishment in wealth and power was at stake as well as his, and they were ready to
make common cause with him, knowing that they could save themselves from ruin only by reinstating
him.

Charles had his privy council and a sort of court at the Hague, and he arranged channels of
communication, centering there, for collecting intelligence from England and Scotland, and
through these he watched in every way for the opening of an opportunity to assert his rights
to the British crown. He went, too, to Jersey, where the authorities and the inhabitants were
on his side, and both there and at the Hague he busied himself with plans for raising funds
and levying troops, and securing co-operation from those of the people of England who still
remained loyal. Ireland was generally in his favor too, and he seriously meditated an expedition
there. His mother was unwilling to have him engage in these schemes. She was afraid he would,
sooner or later, involve himself in dangers from which he could not extricate himself, and
that he would end by being plunged into the same pit of destruction that had engulfed his father.

Amid all these political schemes, however, Charles did not forget Anne Maria. He was sager
to secure her for his bride; for her fortune, and the power and influence of her connections,
would aid him very much in recovering his throne. Her hope of marrying the Emperor of Germany,
too, was gone, for that potentate had chosen another wife. Charles therefore continued his
attentions to the young lady. She would not give him any distinct and decisive answer, but
kept the subject in a state of perpetual negotiation. She was, in fact, growing more and more
discontented and unhappy in disposition all the time. Her favorite plan of marrying the emperor
had been thwarted, in part, by the difficulties which her friends--her father and her aunt
especially--had contrived secretly to throw in the way, while outwardly and ostensibly they
appeared to be doing all in their power to promote her wishes. They did not wish to have her
married at all, as by this event the management of her vast fortune would pass out of their
hands. She discovered this, their double dealing, when it was too late, and she was overwhelmed
with vexation and chagrin.

Things being in this state, Charles sent a special messenger, at one time, from the Hague,
with instructions to make a formal proposal to Anne Maria, and to see if he could not bring
the affair to a close. The name of this messenger was Lord Germain.

The queen regent and her father urged Anne Maria now to consent to the proposal. They told
her that Charles's prospects were brightening--that they themselves were going to render him
powerful protection--that he had already acquired several allies--that there were whole provinces
in England that were in his favor; and that all Ireland, which was, as it were, a kingdom in
itself, was on his side. Whether they seriously desired that Anne Maria would consent to Charles's
proposals, or only urged, for effect, what they knew very well she would persist in refusing,
it is impossible to ascertain. If this latter were their design, it seemed likely to fail,
for Anne Maria appeared to yield. She was sorry, she said, that the situation of affairs in
Paris was not such as to allow of the French government giving Charles effectual help in gaining
possession of the throne; but still, not withstanding that, she was ready to do what ever they
might think best to command.

Lord Germain then said that he should proceed directly to Holland and escort Charles to France,
and he wanted Anne Maria to give him a direct and positive reply; for if she would really accept
his proposal, he would come at once to court and claim her as his bride; otherwise he must
proceed to Ireland, for the state of his affairs demanded his presence there. But if she would
accept his proposal, he would immediately come to Paris, and have the marriage ceremony performed,
and then he would remain afterward some days with her, that she might enjoy the honors and
distinctions to which she would become entitled as the queen consort of a mighty realm. He
would then, if she liked the plan, take her to Saint Germain's, where his mother, her aunt,
was then residing, and establish her there while he was recovering his kingdom; or, if she
preferred it, she might take up her residence in Paris, where she had been accustomed to live.

To this the young lady replied that the last mentioned plan, that is, that she should continue
to live at Paris after being married to Charles, was one that she could not think of. She should
feel altogether unwilling to remain and enjoy the gayeties and festivities of Paris while her
husband was at the head of his armies, exposed to all the dangers and privations of a camp;
nor should she consider it right to go on incurring the expenses which a lady of her rank and
position must necessarily bear in such a city, while he was perhaps embarrassed and distressed
with the difficulties of providing funds for his own and his followers' necessities. She should
feel, in fact, bound, if she were to become his wife, to do all in her power to assist him;
and it would end, she foresaw, in her having to dispose of all her property, and expend the
avails in aiding him to recover his kingdom. This, she said, she confessed alarmed her. It
was a great sacrifice for her to make, reared as she had been in opulence and luxury. Lord
Germain replied that all this was doubtless true, but then, on the other hand, he would venture
to remind her that there was no other suitable match for her in Europe. He then went on to
name the principal personages. The Emperor of Germany and the King of Spain were both married.
Some other monarch was just about to espouse a Spanish princess. Others whom he named were
too young; others, again, too old; and a certain prince whom he mentioned had been married,
he said, these ten years, and his wife was in excellent health, so that every species of hope
seemed to be cut off in that quarter.

This conversation leading to no decisive result, Lord Germain renewed the subject after a few
days, and pressed Anne Maria for a final answer. She said, now, that she had a very high regard
for Queen Henrietta, and, indeed, a very strong affection for her; so strong that she should
be willing to waive, for Henrietta's sake, all her objections to the disadvantages of Charles's
position; but there was one objection which she felt that she could not surmount, and that
was his religion. He was a Protestant, while she was a Catholic. Charles must remove this difficulty
himself, which, if he had any regard for her, he certainly would be willing to do, since she
would have to make so many sacrifices for him. Lord Germain, however, immediately discouraged
this idea. He said that the position of Charles in respect to his kingdom was such as to render
it impossible for him to change his religious faith. In fact, if he were to do so, he would
be compelled to give up, at once, all hope of ever getting possession of his throne. Anne Maria
knew this very well. The plea, however, made an excellent excuse to defend herself with from
Lord Germain's importunities. She adhered to it, therefore, pertinaciously; the negotiation
was broken off, and Lord Germain went away.

Young adventurers like Charles, who wish to marry great heiresses, have always to exercise
a great deal of patience, and to submit to a great many postponements and delays, even though
they are successful in the end; and sovereign princes are not excepted, any more than other
men, from this necessity. Dependent as woman is during all the earlier and all the later years
of her life, and subjected as she is to the control, and too often, alas! to the caprice and
injustice of man, there is a period--brief, it is true--when she is herself in power; and such
characters as Anne Maria like to exercise their authority, while they feel that they possess
it, with a pretty high hand. Charles seems to have felt the necessity of submitting to the
inconvenience of Anne Maria's capricious delays, and, as long as she only continued to make
excuses and objections instead of giving him a direct and positive refusal, he was led to persevere.
Accordingly, not long after the conversations which his messenger had held with the lady as
already described, he determined to come himself to France, and see if he could not accomplish
something by his own personal exertions. He accordingly advanced to Peronne, which was not
far from the frontier, and sent forward a courier to announce his approach. The royal family
concluded to go out in their carriages to meet him. They were at this time at a famous royal
resort a few leagues from Paris, called Compiegne. Charles was to dine at Compiegne, and then
to proceed on toward Paris, where he had business to transact connected with his political plans.

Anne Maria gives a minute account of the ride of the royal family to meet Charles on his approach
to Compiegne, and of the interview with him, on her part, which attended it. She dressed herself
in the morning, she says, with great care, and had her hair curled, which she seldom did except
on very special occasions. When she entered the carriage to go out to meet the king, the queen
regent, observing her appearance, said archly, "How easy it is to tell when young ladies expect
to meet their lovers." Anne Maria says that she had a great mind to tell her, in reply, that
it was easy, for those who had had a great deal of experience in preparing to meet lovers themselves.
She did not, however, say this, and the forbearance seems to show that there was, after all,
the latent element of discretion and respect for superiors in her character, though it showed
itself so seldom in action.

They rode out several miles to meet the coming king; and when the two parties met, they all
alighted, and saluted each other by the road side, the ladies and gentlemen that accompanied
them standing around. Anne Maria noticed that Charles addressed the king and queen regent first,
and then her. After a short delay they got into their carriages again--King Charles entering
the carriage with their majesties and Anne Maria--and they rode together thus back to Compiegne.

Anne Maria, however, does not seem to have been in a mood to be pleased. She says that Charles
began to talk with the king--Louis XIV.--who was now twelve years old, about the dogs and horses,
and the hunting customs in the country of the Prince of Orange. He talked on these subjects
fluently enough in the French language, but when afterward the queen regent, who would naturally
be interested in a different class of topics, asked him about the affairs of his own kingdom
and his plans for recovering it, he excused himself by saying that he did not speak French
well enough to give her the information. Anne Maria says she determined from that moment not
to conclude the marriage, "for I conceived a very poor opinion of him, being a king, and at
his age, to have no knowledge of his affairs." Such minds as Anne Maria's are seldom very logical;
but such an inference as this, that he was ignorant of his own affairs because he declined
explaining plans whose success depended on secrecy in such a company as that, and in a language
with which, though he could talk about dogs and horses in it, he was still very imperfectly
acquainted, is far too great a jump from premises to conclusion to be honestly made. It is
very evident that Anne Maria was not disposed to be pleased.

They arrived at Compiegne. As the king was going on that evening, dinner was served soon after
they arrived. Anne Maria says he ate no ortolans, a very expensive and rare dish of little
birds, which had been prepared expressly for this dinner in honor of the royal guest, [Footnote:
The ortolan is a very small bird, which is fattened in lamp lighted rooms at great expense,
because it is found to be of a more delicate flavor when excluded from the daylight. They come
from the island of Cyprus, and have been famous in every age of the world as an article of
royal luxury.] "but flung himself upon a piece of beef and a shoulder of mutton, as if there
had been nothing else at table. After dinner, when we were in the drawing room, the queen amused
herself with the other ladies and gentlemen, and left him with me. He was a quarter of an hour
without speaking a word; but I am willing to believe that his silence was the result of respect
rather than any want of passion, though on this occasion, I frankly confess, I could have wished
it less plainly exhibited. After a while, getting tired of his tediousness, I called another
lady to my side, to see if she could not make him talk. She succeeded. Presently one of the
gentlemen of the party came to me and said, 'He kept looking at you all dinner time, and is
looking at you still.' To which I replied, 'He has plenty of time to look at me before he will
please me, if he does not speak.' The gentleman rejoined, 'Oh, he has said tender things enough
to you, no doubt, only you don't like to admit it.' To which I answered, 'Come and seat yourself
by me the next time he is at my side, and hear for yourself how he talks about it." She says
she then went and addressed the king herself, asking him various questions about persons who
were in his suite, and that he answered them all with an air of mere common politeness, without
any gallantry at all.

Finally, the hour for the departure of Charles and his party arrived, and the carriages came
to the door. The French king, together with his mother and Anne Maria, and the usual attendants,
accompanied them some miles into the forest on their way, and then, all alighting, as they
had done when they met in the morning, they took leave of each other with the usual ceremonies
of such occasions. Charles, after bidding King Louis farewell, advanced with Lord Germain,
who was present in his suite at that time, to Anne Maria, and she gives the following rather
petulant account of what passed: "'I believe,' said Charles, 'that my Lord Germain, who speaks
French better than I do, has explained to you my sentiments and my intention. I am your very
obedient servant.' I answered that I was equally his obedient servant. Germain paid me a great
number of compliments, the king standing by. After they were over, the king bowed and departed."

Charles, who had been all his life living roughly in camps, felt naturally ill at ease in the
brilliant scenes of ceremony and splendor which the French court presented; and this embarrassment
was greatly increased by the haughty air and manner, and the ill concealed raillery of the
lady whose favorable regard he was so anxious to secure. His imperfect knowledge of the language,
and his sense of the gloomy uncertainty of his own prospects in life, tended strongly to increase
his distrust of himself and his timidity. We should have wished that he could have experienced
somewhat kinder treatment from the object of his regard, were it not that his character, and
especially his subsequent history, show that he was entirely mercenary and selfish himself
in seeking her hand. If we can ever, in any instance, pardon the caprice and wanton cruelty
of a coquette, it is when these qualities are exercised in thwarting the designs of a heartless
speculator, who is endeavoring to fill his coffers with money by offering in exchange for it
a mere worthless counterfeit of love.

Charles seems to have been totally discouraged by the result of this unfortunate dinner party
at Compiegne. He went to Paris, and from Paris he went to St. Germain's, where he remained
for several months with his mother, revolving in his mind his fallen fortunes, and forming
almost hopeless schemes for seeking to restore them. In the mean time, the wife whom the Emperor
of Germany had married instead of Anne Maria, died, and the young belle sprang immediately
into the excitement of a new hope of attaining the great object of her ambition after all.
The emperor was fifty years of age, and had four children, but he was the Emperor of Germany,
and that made amends for all. Anne Maria immediately began to lay her trains again for becoming
his bride. What her plans were, and how they succeeded, we shall, perhaps, have occasion hereafter
to describe.

Though her heart was thus set upon having the emperor for her husband, she did not like, in
the mean time, quite to give up her younger and more agreeable beau. Besides, her plans of
marrying the emperor might fail, and Charles might succeed in recovering his kingdom. It was
best, therefore, not to bring the negotiation with him to too absolute a close. When the time
arrived, therefore, for Charles to take his departure, she thought she would just ride out
to St. Germain's and pay her respects to Queen Henrietta, and bid the young king good-by.

Neither Queen Henrietta nor her son attempted to renew the negotiation of his suite on the
occasion of this visit. The queen told Anne Maria, on the other hand, that she supposed she
ought to congratulate her on the death of the Empress of Germany, for, though the negotiation
for her marriage with him had failed on a former occasion, she had no doubt it would be resumed
now, and would be successful. Anne Maria replied, with an air of indifference, that she did
not know or think any thing about it. The queen then said that she knew of a young man, not
very far from them, who thought that a king of nineteen years of age was better for a husband
than a man of fifty, a widower with four children, even if he was an emperor. "However," said
she, "we do not know what turn things may take. My son may succeed in recovering his kingdom,
and then, perhaps, if you should be in a situation to do so, you may listen more favorably
to his addresses."

Anne Maria was not to return directly back to Paris. She was going to visit her sisters, who
lived at a little distance beyond. The Duke of York, that is, Henrietta's son James, then fourteen
or fifteen years old, proposed to accompany her. She consented. Charles then proposed to go
too. Anne Maria objected to this, saying that it was not quite proper. She had no objection
to James's going, as he was a mere youth. Queen Henrietta removed her objection by offering
to join the party herself; so they all went together. Anne Maria says that Charles treated
her with great politeness and attention all the way, and paid her many compliments, but made
no attempt to bring up again, in any way, the question of his suit. She was very glad he did
not, she says, for her mind being now occupied with the plan of marrying the emperor, nothing
that he could have said would have done any good.

Thus the question was considered as virtually settled, and King Charles, soon after, turned
his thoughts toward executing the plans which he had been long revolving for the recovery of
his kingdom.

CHAPTER VII

THE ROYAL OAK OF BOSCOBEL.

It was in June, 1650, about eighteen months after the decapitation of his father, that Charles
was ready to set out on his expedition to attempt the recovery of his rights to the English
throne. He was but twenty years of age. He took with him no army, no supplies, no resources.
He had a small number of attendants and followers, personally interested themselves in his
success, and animated also, probably, by some degree of disinterested attachment to him. It
was, however, on the whole, a desperate enterprise. Queen Henrietta, in her retirement at the
Louvre, felt very anxious about the result of it. Charles himself, too, notwithstanding his
own buoyant and sanguine temperament, and the natural confidence and hope pertaining to his
years, must have felt many forebodings. But his condition on the Continent was getting every
month more and more destitute and forlorn. He was a mere guest wherever he went, and destitute
of means as he was, he found himself continually sinking in public consideration. Money as
well as rank is very essentially necessary to make a relative a welcome guest, for any long
time, in aristocratic circles. Charles concluded, therefore, that, all things considered, it
was best for him to make a desperate effort to recover his kingdoms.

His kingdoms were three, England, Scotland, and Ireland. Ireland was a conquered kingdom, Scotland,
like England, had descended to him from his ancestors; for his grandfather, James VI., was
king of Scotland, and being on his mothers side a descendant of an English king, he was, of
course, one of the heirs of the English crown; and on the failure of the other heirs, he succeeded
to that crown, retaining still his own. Thus both kingdoms descended to Charles.

It was only the English kingdom that had really rebelled against, and put to death King Charles's
father. There had been a great deal of difficulty in Scotland, it is true, and the republican
spirit had spread quite extensively in that country. Still, affairs had not proceeded to such
extremities there. The Scotch had, in some degree, joined with the English in resisting Charles
the First, but it was not their wish to throw off the royal authority altogether. They abhorred
episcopacy in the Church, but were well enough contented with monarchy in the state. Accordingly,
soon after the death of the father, they had opened negotiations with the son, and had manifested
their willingness to acknowledge him as their king, on certain conditions which they undertook
to prescribe to him. It is very hard for a king to hold his scepter on conditions prescribed
by his people. Charles tried every possible means to avoid submitting to this necessity. He
found, however, that the only possible avenue of access to England was by first getting some
sort of possession of Scotland; and so, signifying his willingness to comply with the Scotch
demands, he set sail from Holland with his court, moved north ward with his little squadron
over the waters of the German Ocean, and at length made port In the Frith of Cromarty, in the
north of Scotland.

The Scotch government, having but little faith in the royal word of such a youth as Charles
would not allow him to land until he had formally signed their covenant, by which he bound
himself to the conditions which they had thought it necessary to impose. He then landed. But
he found his situation very far from such as comported with his ideas of royal authority and
state. Charles was a gay, dissipated, reckless young man. The men whom he had to deal with
were stern, sedate, and rigid religionists. They were scandalized at the looseness and irregularity
of his character and manners. He was vexed and tormented by what he considered their ascetic
bigotry, by the restraints which they were disposed to put upon his conduct, and the limits
with which they insisted on bounding his authority. Long negotiations and debates ensued, each
party becoming more and more irritated against the other. At last, on one occasion, Charles
lost his patience entirely, and made his escape into the mountains, in hopes to raise an army
there among the clans of wild Highlanders, who, accustomed from infancy to the most implicit
obedience to their chieftains, are always very loyal to their king. The Scotch nobles, however,
not wishing to drive him to extremities, sent for him to come back, and both parties becoming
after this somewhat more considerate and accommodating, they at length came to an agreement,
and proceeding together to Scone, a village some miles north of Edinburgh, they crowned Charles
King of Scotland in a venerable abbey there, the ancient place of coronation for all the monarchs
of the Scottish line.

In the mean time, Cromwell, who was at the head of the republican government of England, knowing
very well that Charles's plan would be to march into England as soon as he could mature his
arrangements for such an enterprise, determined to anticipate this design by declaring war
himself against Scotland, and marching an army there.

Charles felt comparatively little interest in what became of Scotland. His aim was England.
He knew, or supposed that there was a very large portion of the English people who secretly
favored his cause, and he believed that if he could once cross the frontier, even with a small
army, these his secret friends would all rise at once and flock to his standard. Still he attempted
for a time to resist Cromwell in Scotland, but without success. Cromwell penetrated to the
heart of the country, and actually passed the army of Charles. In these circumstances, Charles
resolved to leave Scotland to its fate, and boldly to cross the English frontier, to see what
he could do by raising his standard in his southern kingdom. The army acceded to this plan
with acclamations. The king accordingly put his forces in motion, crossed the frontier, issued
his manifestoes, and sent around couriers and heralds, announcing to the whole population that
their king had come, and summoning all his subjects to arm themselves and hasten to his aid.
This was in the summer of 1651, the year after his landing in Scotland.

It certainly was a very bold and almost desperate measure, and the reader, whether Monarchist
or Republican, can hardly help wishing the young adventurer success. The romantic enterprise
was, however, destined to fail. The people of England were not yet prepared to return to royalty.
Some few of the ancient noble families and country gentlemen adhered to the king's cause, but
they came in to join his ranks very slowly. Those who were in favor of the king were called
Cavaliers. The other party were called Roundheads. Queen Henrietta Maria had given them the
name, on account of their manner of wearing their hair, cut short and close to their heads
all around, while the gay Cavaliers cultivated their locks, which hung in long curls down upon
their shoulders. The Cavaliers, it turned out, were few, while the Roundheads filled the land.

It was, however, impossible for Charles to retreat, since Cromwell was behind him; for Cromwell,
as soon as he found that his enemy had actually gone into England, paused only long enough
to recover from his surprise, and then made all haste to follow him. The two armies thus moved
down through the very heart of England, carrying every where, as they went, universal terror,
confusion, and dismay. The whole country was thrown into extreme excitement. Every body was
called upon to take sides, and thousands were perplexed and undecided which side to take. Families
were divided, brothers separated, fathers and sons were ready to fight each other in their
insane zeal, the latter for the Parliament, the former for the king. The whole country was
filled with rumors, messengers, parties of soldiers going to and fro, and troops of horsemen,
with robberies, plunderings, murders, and other deeds of violence without number, and all the
other elements of confusion and misery which arouse the whole population of a country to terror
and distress, and mar the very face of nature in time of civil war. What dreadful struggles
man will make to gain the pleasure of ruling his fellow man! Along the frontiers of England
and Wales there flows the beautiful River Severn, which widens majestically at its mouth, and
passes by the Bristol Channel to the sea. One of the largest towns upon this river is Worcester.
It was in those days strongly fortified. It stands on the eastern side of the river, with a
great bridge opposite one of the gates leading across the Severn in the direction toward Wales.
There are other bridges on the stream, both above and below, and many towns and villages in
the vicinity, the whole presenting, at ordinary times, a delightful scene of industry and peace.

Worcester is, perhaps, three hundred miles from the frontiers of Scotland, on the way to London,
though somewhat to the westward of the direct route. Charles's destination was the capital.
He pushed on, notwithstanding the difficulties and disappointments which embarrassed his march,
until at last, when he reached the banks of the Severn, he found he could go no further. His
troops and his officers were wearied, faint, and discouraged. His hopes had not been realized,
and while it was obviously dangerous to stop, it seemed still more dangerous to go on. However,
as the authorities of Worcester were disposed to take sides with the king, Charles determined
to stop there for a little time, at all events, to refresh his army, and consider what to do.

He was received in the city with all due honors. He was proclaimed king on the following day,
with great parade and loud acclamations. He established a camp in the neighborhood of the city.
He issued great proclamations, calling upon all the people of the surrounding country to come
and espouse his cause. He established his court, organized his privy council, and, in a word,
perfected, on a somewhat humble scale it is true, all the arrangements proper to the condition
of a monarch in his capital. He began, perhaps, in fact, to imagine himself really a king.
If he did so, however, the illusion was soon dispelled. In one short week Cromwell's army came
on, filling all the avenues of approach to the city, and exhibiting a force far too great,
apparently, either for Charles to meet in battle, or to defend himself from in a siege.

Charles's forces fought several preliminary battles and skirmishes in resisting the attempts
of Cromwell's columns to get possession of the bridges and fords by which they were to cross
the river. These contests resulted always in the same way. The detachments which Charles had
sent forward to defend these points were one after another driven in, while Charles, with his
council of war around him, watched from the top of the tower of a church within the city this
gradual and irresistible advance of his determined enemy, with an anxiety which gradually deepened
into dismay.

The king, finding his situation now desperate, determined to make one final attempt to retrieve
his fallen fortunes. He formed his troops in array, and marched out to give the advancing army
battle. He put himself at the head of a troop of Highlanders, and fought in person with the
courage and recklessness of despair. The officers knew full well that it was a question of
victory or death; for if they did not conquer, they must die, either by wounds on the field
of battle, or else, if taken prisoners, by being hung as traitors, or beheaded in the Tower.
All possibility of escape, entrapped and surrounded as they were in the very heart of the country,
hundreds of miles from the frontiers, seemed utterly hopeless. They fought, therefore, with
reckless and desperate fury, but all was in vain. They were repulsed and driven in on all sides,
and the soldiers fled at length, carrying the officers with them, in tumult and disorder, back
through the gates into the city.

An army flying in confusion to seek refuge in a city can not shut the gates behind them against
their pursuers. In fact, in such a scene of terror and dismay, there is no order, no obedience,
no composure. At the gate where Charles endeavored to get back into the city, he found the
way choked up by a heavy ammunition cart which had been entangled there, one of the oxen that
had been drawing it being killed. The throngs of men &and horsemen were stopped by this disaster.
The king dismounted, abandoned his horse, and made his way through and over the obstruction
as he could. When he got into the city, he found all in confusion there. His men were throwing
away their arms, and pressing onward in their flight. He lightened his own burdens by laying
aside the heaviest of his armor, procured another horse, and rode up and down among his men,
urging and entreating them to form again and face the enemy. He plead the justice of his cause,
their duty to be faithful to their rightful sovereign, and every other argument which was capable
of being expressed in the shouts and vociferations which, in such a scene, constitute the only
kind of communication possible with panic stricken men; and when he found that all was in vain
he said, in despair, that he would rather they would shoot him on the spot than let him live
to witness such an abandonment of his cause by the only friends and followers that had been
left to him.

The powerful influence which these expostulations would otherwise have had, was lost and overborne
in the torrent of confusion and terror which was spreading through all the streets of the city.
The army of Cromwell forced their passage in, and fought their way from street to street, wherever
they found any remaining resistance. Some of the king's troops were hemmed up in corners, and
cut to pieces. Others, somewhat more fortunate, sought protection in towers and bastions, where
they could make some sort of conditions with their victorious enemy before surrendering. Charles
himself, finding that all was lost, made his escape at last from the city, at six o'clock in
the evening, at the head of a troop of horse. He could not, however, endure the thought of
giving up the contest, after all. Again and again, as he slowly retreated, he stopped to face
about, and to urge his men to consent to turn back again and encounter the enemy. Their last
halt was upon a bridge half a mile from the city. Here the king held a consultation with the
few remaining counselors and officers that were with him, surveying, with them, the routed
and flying bodies of men, who were now throwing away their arms and dispersing in all directions,
in a state of hopeless disorganization and despair. The king saw plainly that his cause was
irretrievably ruined, and they all agreed that nothing now remained for them but to make their
escape back to Scotland, if by any possibility that could now be done.

But how should they accomplish this end? To follow the multitude of defeated soldiers would
be to share the certain capture and death which awaited them, and they were themselves all
strangers to the country. To go on inquiring all the way would only expose them to equally
certain discovery and capture. The first thing, however, obviously was to get away from the
crowd. Charles and his attendants, therefore, turned aside from the high road--there were with
the king fifty or sixty officers and noblemen, all mounted men--and moved along in such secluded
by-paths as they could find. The king wished to diminish even this number of followers, but
he could not get any of them to leave him. He complained afterward, in the account which he
gave of these adventures, that, though they would not fight for him when battle was to be given,
he could not get rid of them when the time came for flight.

There was a servant of one of the gentlemen in the company who pretended to know the way, and
he accordingly undertook to guide the party; but as soon as it became dark he got confused
and lost, and did not know what to do. They contrived, however, to get another guide They went
ten miles, attracting no particular attention, for at such a time of civil war a country is
full of parties of men, armed and unarmed, going to and fro, who are allowed generally to move
without molestation, as the inhabitants are only anxious to have as little as possible to say
to them, that they may the sooner be gone. The royal party assumed the air and manner of one
of these bands as long as daylight lasted, and when that was gone they went more securely and
at their ease. After proceeding ten miles, they stopped at an obscure inn, where they took
some drink and a little bread, and then resumed their journey, consulting with one another
as they went as to what it was best to do.

About ten or twelve miles further on there was a somewhat wild and sequestered region, in which
there were two very secluded dwellings, about half a mile from each other. One of these residences
was named Boscobel. The name had been given to it by a guest of the proprietor, at an entertainment
which the latter had given, from the Italian words bosco bello, which mean beautiful grove.
It was in or near a wood, and away from all high roads, having been built, probably, like many
other of the dwellings reared in those days, as a place of retreat. In the preceding reigns
of Charles and Elizabeth, the Catholics, who were called popish recusants, on account of their
refusing to take an oath acknowledging the supremacy of the British sovereign over the English
Church, had to resort to all possible modes of escape from Protestant persecution. They built
these retreats in retired and secluded places, and constructed all sorts of concealed and secure
hiding places within them, in the partitions and walls, where men whose lives were in danger
might be concealed for many days. Boscobel was such a mansion. In fact, one of the king's generals,
the Earl of Derby, had been concealed in it but a short time before. The king inquired particularly
about it, and was induced himself to seek refuge there.

This house belonged to a family of Giffards, one of whom was in the suite of King Charles at
this time. There was another mansion about half a mile distant. This other place had been originally,
in the Catholic days, a convent, and the nuns who inhabited it dressed in white. They were
called, accordingly, the white ladies, and the place itself received the same name, which it
retained after the sisters were gone. Mr. Giffard recommended going to the White Ladies' first.
He wanted, in fact, to contrive some way to relieve the king of the encumbrance of so large
a troop before going to Boscobel.

They went, accordingly, to the White Ladies'. Neither of the houses was occupied at this time
by the proprietors, but were in charge of housekeepers and servants. Among the tenants upon
the estate there were several brothers of the name of Penderel. They were woodmen and farm
servants, living at different places in the neighborhood, and having charge, some of them,
of the houses above described. One of the Penderels was at the White Ladies'. He let the fugitives
in, tired, exhausted, and hungry as they were, with the fatigue of marching nearly all the
night. They sent immediately for Richard Penderel, who lived in a farm house nearby, and for
another brother, who was at Boscobel. They took the king into an inner room, and immediately
commenced the work of effectually disguising him.

They gave him clothes belonging to some of the servants of the family, and destroyed his own.
The king had about his person a watch and some costly decorations, such as orders of knighthood
set in jewels, which would betray his rank if found in his possession. These the king distributed
among his friends, intrusting them to the charge of such as he judged most likely to effect
their escape. They then cut off his hair short all over, thus making him a Roundhead instead
of a Cavalier. They rubbed soot from the fire place over his face, to change the expression
of his features and complexion. They gave him thus, in all respects, as nearly as possible,
the guise of a squalid peasant and laborer of the humblest class, accustomed to the privations
and to the habits of poverty.

In the mean time Richard Penderel arrived. Perhaps an intimation had been given him of the
wishes of the king to be relieved of his company of followers; at any rate, he urged the whole
retinue, as soon as he came to the house to press forward without any delay, as there was a
detachment of Cromwell's forces, he said, at three miles' distance, who might be expected at
any moment to come in pursuit of them Giffard brought Penderel then into the inner room to
which the king had retired. "This is the king," said he. "I commit him to your charge. Take
care of him."

Richard undertook the trust. He told the king that he must immediately leave that place, and
he conducted him secretly, all disguised as he was, out of a postern door, without making known
his design to any of his followers, except the two or three who were in immediate attendance
upon him. He led him away about half a mile into a wood, and, concealing him there, left him
alone, saying he would go and see what intelligence he could obtain, and presently return again.
The troop of followers, in the mean time, from whom the king had been so desirous to get free,
when they found that he was gone, mounted their horses and rode away, to escape the danger
with which Richard had threatened them. But, alas for the unhappy fugitives, they did not get
far in their flight; they were overtaken, attacked, conquered, captured, and treated as traitors.
Some were shot, one was beheaded, and others were shut up in prisons, where they pined in hopeless
privation and suffering for many years. There was, however, one of the king's followers who
did not go away with the rest. It was Lord Wilmot, an influential nobleman, who concealed himself
in the vicinity, and kept near the king in all his subsequent wanderings.

But we must return to the king in the wood. It was about sunrise when he was left there, the
morning after the battle. It rained. The king tried in vain to find a shelter under the trees
of the forest. The trees themselves were soon thoroughly saturated, and they received the driving
rain from the skies only to let the water fall in heavier drops upon the poor fugitive's defenseless
head. Richard borrowed a blanket at a cottage near, thinking that it would afford some protection,
and brought it to his charge. The king folded it up to make a cushion to sit upon; for, worn
out as he was with hard fighting all the day before, and hard riding all the night, he could
not stand; so he chose to use his blanket as a protection from the wet ground beneath him,
and to take the rain upon his head as it fell.

Richard sent a peasant's wife to him presently with some food. Charles, who never had any great
respect for the female sex, was alarmed to find that a woman had been entrusted with such a secret.

"My good woman," said he, "can you be faithful to a distressed Cavalier?"

"Yes, sir," said she; "I will die rather than betray you."

Charles had, in fact, no occasion to fear. Woman is, indeed, communicative and confiding, and
often, in unguarded hours, reveals indiscreetly what it would have been better to have withheld;
but in all cases where real and important trusts are committed to her keeping, there is no
human fidelity which can be more safely relied upon than hers.

Charles remained in the wood all the day, exposed to the pelting of the storm. There was a
road in sight, a sort of by-way leading across the country, and the monarch beguiled the weary
hours as well as he could by watching this road from under the trees, to see if any soldiers
came along. There was one troop that appeared, but it passed directly by, marching heavily
through the mud and rain, the men intent, apparently, only on reaching their journey's end.
When night came on, Richard Penderel returned, approaching cautiously, and, finding all safe,
took the king into the house with him. They brought him to the fire, changed and dried his
clothes, and gave him supper. The homeless monarch once more enjoyed the luxuries of warmth
and shelter.

During all the day, while he had been alone in the wood, he had been revolving in his mind
the strange circumstances of his situation, vainly endeavoring, for many hours, to realize
what seemed at first like a dreadful dream. Could it be really true that he, the monarch of
three kingdoms, so recently at the head of a victorious army, and surrounded by generals and
officers of state, was now a friendless and solitary fugitive, without even a place to hide
his head from the cold autumnal storm? It seemed at first a dream; but it soon became a reality,
and he began to ponder, in every form, the question what he should do. He looked east, west,
north, and south, but could not see, in any quarter, any hope of succor, or any reasonable
prospect of escape. He, however, arrived at the conclusion, before night came on, that it would
be, on the whole, the best plan for him to attempt to escape into Wales.

He was very near the frontier of that country. There was no difficulty to be apprehended on
the road thither, excepting in the crossing of the Severn, which, as has already been remarked,
flows from north to south not far from the line of the frontier. He thought, too, that if he
could once succeed in getting into Wales, he could find secure retreats among the mountains
there until he should be able to make his way to some sea-port on the coast trading with France,
and so find his way back across the Channel. He proposed this plan to Richard in the evening,
and asked him to accompany him as his guide. Richard readily consented, and the arrangements
for the journey were made. They adjusted the king's dress again to complete his disguise, and
Richard gave him a bill-hook--a sort of woodman's tool--to carry in his hand. It was agreed,
also, that his name should be Will Jones so far as there should be any necessity for designating
him by a name in the progress of the journey.

They set out at nine o'clock that same night, in the darkness and rain. They wished to get
to Madely, a town near the river, before the morning. Richard knew a Mr. Woolf there, a friend
of the Royalist cause, who he thought would shelter them, and aid them in getting across the
river. They went on very well for some time, until they came to a stream, a branch of the Severn,
where there was a bridge, and on the other side a mill. The miller happened to be watching
that night at his door. At such times everybody is on the alert, suspecting mischief or danger
in every unusual sight or sound.

Hearing the footsteps, he called out, "Who goes there?"

"Neighbors," replied Richard. The king was silent. He had been previously charged by Richard
not to speak, except when it could not possibly be avoided, as he had not the accent of the
country.

"Stop, then," said the miller, "if you be neighbors." The travelers only pressed forward the
faster for this challenge. "Stop!" repeated the miller, "if you be neighbors, or I will knock
you down;" and he ran out in pursuit of them, armed apparently with the means of executing
his threat. Richard fled, the king closely following him. They turned into a lane, and ran
a long distance, the way being in many places so dark that the king, in following Richard,
was guided only by the sound of his footsteps, and the creaking of the leather dress which
such peasants were accustomed in those days to wear. They crept along, however, as silently,
and yet as rapidly as possible, until at length Richard turned suddenly aside, leaped over
a sort of gap in the hedge, and crouched down in the trench on the other side. Here they remained
for some time, listening to ascertain whether they were pursued. When they found that all was
still, they crept forth from their hiding places, regained the road, and went on their way.

At length they arrived at the town. Richard left the king concealed in an obscure corner of
the street, while he went to the house of Mr. Woolf to see if he could obtain admission. All
was dark and still. He knocked till he had aroused some of the family, and finally brought
Mr. Woolf to the door.

He told Mr. Woolf that he came to ask shelter for a gentleman who was wishing to get into Wales,
and who could not safely travel by day. Mr. Woolf hesitated, and began to ask for further information
in respect to the stranger. Richard said that he was an officer who had made his escape from
the battle of Worcester, "Then," said Mr. Woolf, "I should hazard my life by concealing him,
which I should not be willing to do for any body, unless it were the king." Richard then told
him that it was his majesty. On hearing this, Mr. Woolf decided at once to admit and conceal
the travelers, and Richard went back to bring the king.

When they arrived at the house, they found Mr. Woolf making preparations for their reception.
They placed the king by the fire to warm and dry his clothes, and they gave him such food as
could be provided on so sudden an emergency. As the morning was now approaching, it was necessary
to adopt some plan of concealment for the day, and Mr. Woolf decided upon concealing his guests
in his barn. He said that there were holes and hiding places built in his house, but that they
had all been discovered on some previous search, and, in case of any suspicion or alarm, the
officers would go directly to them all. He took the travelers, accordingly, to the barn, and
concealed them there among the hay. He said that he would himself, during the day, make inquiries
in respect to the practicability of their going on upon their journey, and come and report
to them in the evening.

Accordingly, when the evening came, Mr. Woolf returned, relieved them from their confinement,
and took them back again to the house. His report, however, in respect to the continuance of
their journey, was very unfavorable. He thought it would be impossible, he said, for them to
cross the Severn. The Republican forces had stationed guards at all the bridges, ferries, and
fords, and at every other practicable place of crossing, and no one was allowed to pass without
a strict examination. The country was greatly excited, too, with the intelligence of the king's
escape; rewards were offered for his apprehension, and heavy penalties denounced upon all who
should harbor or conceal him. Under these circumstances, Mr. Woolf recommended that Charles
should go back to Boscobel, and conceal himself as securely as possible there, until some plan
could be devised for effecting his escape from the country.

The king had no alternative but to accede to this plan. He waited at Mr. Woolf's house till
midnight, in order that the movement in the streets of the town might have time entirely to
subside, and then, disappointed and discouraged by the failure of his hopes, he prepared to
set out upon his return. Mr. Woolf made some changes in his disguise, and bathed his face in
a decoction of walnut leaves, which he had prepared during the day, to alter his complexion,
which was naturally very dark and peculiar, and thus exposed him to danger of discovery. When
all was ready, the two travelers bade their kind host farewell, and crept forth again through
the silent streets, to return, by the way they came, back to Boscobel.

They went on very well till they began to approach the branch stream where they had met with
their adventure with the miller. They could not cross this stream by the bridge without going
by the mill again, which they were both afraid to do. The king proposed that they should go
a little way below, and ford the stream. Richard was afraid to attempt this, as he could not
swim; and as the night was dark, and the current rapid, there would be imminent danger of their
getting beyond their depth. Charles said that he could swim, and that he would, accordingly,
go first and try the water. They groped their way down, therefore, to the bank, and Charles,
leaving his guide upon the land, waded in, and soon disappeared from view as he receded from
the shore. He returned, however, after a short time, in safety, and reported the passage practicable,
as the water was only three or four feet deep; so, taking Richard by the hand, he led him into
the stream. It was a dismal and dangerous undertaking, wading thus through a deep and rapid
current in darkness and cold, but they succeeded in passing safely over.

They reached Boscobel before the morning dawned, and Richard, when they arrived, left the king
in the wood while he went toward the house to reconnoiter, and see if all was safe. He found
within an officer of the king's army, a certain Colonel Carlis, who had fled from Worcester
some time after the king had left the field, and, being acquainted with the situation of Boscobel,
had sought refuge there; William Penderel, who had remained in charge of Boscobel, having received
and secreted him when he arrived.

Richard and William brought Colonel Carlis out into the wood to see the king. They found him
sitting upon the ground at the foot of a tree, entirely exhausted. He was worn out with hardship
and fatigue. They took him to the house. They brought him to the fire, and gave him some food.
The colonel drew off his majesty's heavy peasant shoes and coarse stockings. They were soaked
with water and full of gravel. The colonel bathed his feet, which were sadly swollen and blistered,
and, as there were no other shoes in the house which would answer for him to wear, Dame Penderel
warmed and dried those which the colonel had taken off, by filling them with hot ashes from
the fire, and then put them on again.

The king continued to enjoy such sort of comforts as these during the night, but when the morning
drew near it became necessary to look out for some place of concealment. The Penderels thought
that no place within the house would be safe, for there was danger every hour of the arrival
of a band of soldiers, who would not fail to search the mansion most effectually in every part.
There was the wood near by, which was very secluded and solitary; but still they feared that,
in case of a search, the wood would be explored as effectually as the dwelling. Under these
circumstances, Carlis was looking around, perplexed and uncertain, not knowing what to do,
when he perceived some scattered oaks standing by themselves in a field not far from the house,
one of which seemed to be so full and dense in its foliage as to afford some hope of concealment
there. The tree, it seems, had been headed down once or twice, and this pruning had had the
effect, usual in such cases, of making the branches spread and grow very thick and full. The
colonel thought that though, in making a search for fugitives, men might very naturally explore
a thicket or a grove, they would not probably think of examining a detached and solitary tree;
he proposed, accordingly, that the king and himself should climb up into this spreading oak,
and conceal themselves for the day among its branches.

The king consented to this plan. They took some provisions, therefore, as soon as the day began
to dawn, and something to answer the purpose of a cushion, and proceeded to the tree. By the
help of William and Richard the king and the colonel climbed up, and established themselves
in the top. The colonel placed the cushion for the king on the best support among the limbs
that he could find. The bread and cheese, and a small bottle of beer, which Richard and William
had brought for their day's supplies, they suspended to a branch within their reach. The colonel
then seated himself a little above the king, in such a manner that the monarch's head could
rest conveniently in his lap, and in as easy a position as it was possible, under such circumstances,
to attain. Richard and William, then, after surveying the place of retreat all around from
below, in order to be sure that the concealment afforded by the foliage was every where complete,
went away, promising to keep faithful watch during the day and to return in the evening. All
things being thus arranged in the oak, the colonel bade his majesty to close his eyes and go
to sleep, saying that he would take good care that he did not fall. The king followed his directions,
and slept safely for many hours.

In the course of the day the king and Carlis saw, by means of the openings between the leaves,
through which, as through loop holes in a tower, they continually reconnoitered the surrounding
fields, men passing to and fro, some of whom they imagined to be soldiers searching the wood.
They were not, however, themselves molested. They passed the day undisturbed, except by the
incessant anxiety and alarm which they necessarily suffered, and the fatigue and pain, which
must have become almost intolerable before night, from their constrained and comfortless position.
Night, however, came at last, and relieved them from their duress. They descended from the
tree and stole back cautiously to the house, the king resolving that he could not bear such
hardship another day, and that they must, accordingly, find some other hiding place for him
on the morrow. We can scarcely be surprised at this decision. A wild beast could hardly have
endured a second day in such a lair.

Other plans of concealment for the king were accordingly formed that night, and measures were
soon concerted, as we shall see in the next chapter, to effect his escape from the country.
The old tree, however, which had sheltered him so safely, was not forgotten. In after years,
when the monarch was restored to his throne, and the story of his dangers and his escape was
made known throughout the kingdom, thousands of visitors came to look upon the faithful tree
which had thus afforded his majesty its unconscious but effectual protection. Every one took
away a leaf or a sprig for a souvenir, and when, at last, the proprietor found that there was
danger that the whole tree would be carried away unless he interposed, he fenced it in and
tilled the ground around it, to defend it from further mutilation. It has borne the name of
the Royal Oak from that time to the present day, and has been the theme of narrators and poets
without number, who have celebrated its praises in every conceivable form of composition. There
is, however, probably no one of them all who has done more for the wide extension of its fame
among all the ranks and gradations of society than the unknown author of the humble distich,

  "The royal oak, it was the tree,
  That saved his royal majesty."

CHAPTER VIII.

THE KING'S ESCAPE TO FRANCE.

When the king and Carlis came into the house again, on the evening after their wearisome day's
confinement in the tree, Dame Penderel had some chickens prepared for his majesty's supper,
which he enjoyed as a great and unexpected luxury. They showed him, too, the hiding hole, built
in the walls, where the Earl of Derby had been concealed, and where they proposed that he should
be lodged for the night. There was room in it to lay down a small straw pallet for a bed. Three
or four yards from the bridge is an immense abyss, where the waters "incessantly roar," which
goes by the name of Devil's Hole; the tradition of which is, that two lovers were swallowed
up in this frightful gulf. The neighbouring peasants tell a tale of one Deville, a lover, who, through
revenge, plunged his fair mistress into these waters, and afterwards
followed her.

How far this story may get belief, I know not; but such they aver is the truth, while they mournfully
lament the sad affair.--They point out a small hole in the bank where you may hear the waters
dashing with fury against the projecting rocks. This, some imagine to be the noise of infernal
spirits, who have taken up their abode in this tremendous abyss;
while others persist in their opinion, that the lover's name was Deville,
and that it retains his name to this day, in commemoration of the
horrid deed.

I have seen, and taken a view of the frightful place, which may rather be imagined than described.
One part of the water was formerly so narrow, that a wager was laid by a gentleman that he
could span it with the thumb and little finger, and which he would have accomplished, but
his adversary, getting up in the night time, chipped a piece off the rock with a hammer, and thus
won the wager. It is now, however, little more than from a foot and a half, to two feet broad,
excepting at the falls and Devil's Hole. The water runs into the Eden at the distance of about
a mile or two from Staincroft Bridge.

Trout are caught with the line and net in great quantities, and are particularly fine here.

ANECDOTES OF A TAMED PANTHER.

BY MRS. BOWDICH. It was observed,
too, that he apparently spent some time here in exercises of devotion, imploring, probably,
the protection of Heaven, in this his hour of danger and distress. The vows and promises which
he doubtless made were, however, all forgotten, as usual in such cases, when safety and prosperity
came again.

There was a little garden, too, near the house, with an eminence at the further end of it,
where there was an arbor, with a stone table, and seats about it. It was retired, and yet,
being in an elevated position, it answered, like the window of the gallery in the house, the
double purpose of a hiding place and a watch tower. It was far more comfortable, and probably
much more safe, than the wretched nest in the tree of the day before; for, were the king discovered
in the arbor, there would be some chances of escape from detection still remaining, but to
have been found in the tree would have been certain destruction.

In the mean time, the Penderels had had messengers out during the Saturday and Sunday, communicating
with certain known friends of the king in the neighboring towns, and endeavoring to concert
some plan for his escape. They were successful in these consultations, and be fore Sunday night
a plan was formed. It seems there was a certain Colonel Lane, whose wife had obtained a pass
from the authorities of the Republican army to go to Bristol, on the occasion of the sickness
of a relative, and to take with her a man servant. Bristol was a hundred miles to the southward,
near the mouth of the Severn. It was thought that if the king should reach this place, he could,
perhaps, succeed afterward in making his way to the southern coast of England, and embarking
there, at some sea-port, for France. The plan was accordingly formed for Mrs. Lane to go, as
she had designed, on this journey, and to take the king along with her in the guise of her
servant. The arrangements were all made, and the king was to be met in a wood five or six miles
from Boscobel, early on Monday morning, by some trusty friends, who were afterward to conceal
him for a time in their houses, until all things should be ready for the journey.

The king found, however, when the morning approached, that his feet were in such a condition
that he could not walk. They accordingly procured a horse belonging to one of the Penderels,
and put him upon it. The brothers all accompanied him as he went away. They were armed with
concealed weapons, intending, if they we're attacked by any small party, to defend the king
with their lives. They, however, went on without any molestation. It was a dark and rainy night.
Nights are seldom otherwise in England in September. The brothers Penderel, six of them in
all, guided the king along through the darkness and rain, until they were within a mile or
two of the appointed place of meeting, where the king dismounted, for the purpose of walking
the rest of way, for greater safety, and three of the brothers, taking the horse with them,
returned. The rest went on, and, after delivering the king safely into the hands of his friends,
who were waiting at the appointed place to receive him, bade his majesty farewell, and, expressing
their good wishes for the safe accomplishment of his escape, they returned to Boscobel.

They now altered the king's disguise in some degree, to accommodate the change in his assumed
character from that of a peasant of the woods to a respectable farmer's son, such as would
be a suitable traveling attendant for an English dame, and they gave him the new name of William
Jackson in the place of Will Jones. Mrs. Lane's sister's husband was to go with them a part
of the way, and there was another gentleman and lady also of the party, so they were five in
all. The horses were brought to the door when all was ready, just in the edge of the evening,
the pretended attendant standing respectfully by, with his hat under his arm. He was to ride
upon the same horse with Mrs. Lane, the lady being seated on a pillion behind him. The family
assembled to bid the party farewell, none, either of the travelers or of the spectators, except
Mrs. Lane and her brother-in-law, having any idea that the meek looking William Jackson was
any other than what he seemed.

They traveled on day after day, meeting with various adventures, and apparently with narrow
escapes. At one time a shoe was off from the horse's foot, and the king stopped at a blacksmith's
to have it replaced. While the smith was busy at the work, the king, standing by, asked him
what news. "No news," said the smith, "that I know of, since the grand news of beating the
rogues, the Scots, at Worcester." The king asked if any of the English officers who were with
the Scots had been taken since the battle. "Some had been captured," the smith replied, "but
he could not learn that the rogue Charles Stuart had been taken." The king then told him that
if that rogue were taken, he deserved to be hanged more than all the rest, for bringing the
Scots in. "You speak like an honest man," said the smith. Soon after, the work was done, and
Charles led the horse away.

At another time, when the party had stopped for the night, the king, in accordance with his
assumed character, went to the kitchen. They were roasting some meat with a jack, a machine
used much in those days to keep meat, while roasting, in slow rotation before the fire, The
jack had run down. They asked the pretended William Jackson to wind it up. In trying to do
it, he attempted to wind it the wrong way. The cook, in ridiculing, his awkwardness, asked
him what country he came from, that he did not know how to wind up a jack. The king meekly
replied that he was the son of a poor tenant of Colonel Lane's, and that they seldom had meat
to roast at home, and that, when they had it, they did not roast it with a jack. The party
at length arrived safely at their place of destination, which was at the house of a Mrs. Norton,
at a place called Leigh, about three miles from Bristol. Here the whole party were received,
and, in order to seclude the king as much as possible from observation, Mrs. Lane pretended
that he was in very feeble health, and he was, accordingly, a good deal confined to his room.
The disease which they selected for him was an intermittent fever, which came on only at intervals.
This would account for his being sometimes apparently pretty well, and allowed him occasionally,
when tired of being shut up in his room, to come down and join the other servants, and hear
their conversation.

There was an old servant of the family, named Pope, a butler, to whose care the pretended William
Jackson was specially confided. On the following morning after his arrival, Charles, feeling,
notwithstanding his fever, a good appetite after the fatigues of his journey, went down to
get his breakfast, and, while there, some men came in, friends of the servants, and Pope brought
out a luncheon of bread and ale, and placed it before them. While they were eating it, they
began to talk about the battle of Worcester, and one of the men described it so accurately,
that the king perceived that he must have been there. On questioning him more particularly,
the man said that he was a soldier in the king's army, and he began to describe the person
and appearance of the king. Charles was alarmed, and very soon rose and went away. Pope, who
had had, it seems, his suspicions before, was now confirmed in them. He went to Mrs. Lane,
and told her that he knew very well that their stranger guest was the king. She denied most
positively that it was so, but she immediately took measures to communicate the conversation
to Charles. The result of their consultations, and of their inquiries about the character of
Pope for prudence and fidelity, was to admit him to their confidence, and endeavor to secure
his aid. He was faithful in keeping the secret, and he rendered the king afterward a great
deal of very efficient aid.

There was a certain Colonel Wyndham, whose name has become immortalized by his connection with
the king's escape, who lived at a place called Trent, not far from the southern coast of England.
After much deliberation and many inquiries, it was decided that the king should proceed there
while arrangements should be made for his embarkation. When this plan was formed, Mrs. Lane
received a pretended letter from home, saying that her father was taken suddenly and dangerously
sick, and urging her immediate return. They set out accordingly, William having so far recovered
from his fever as to be able to travel again!

During all this time, Lord Wilmot, who has already been mentioned as a fellow fugitive with
Charles from the battle of Worcester, had followed the party of the king in his progress through
the country, under various disguises, and by different modes of travel, keeping near his royal
master all the way, and obtaining stolen interviews with him, from time to time, for consultation.
In this way each rendered the other very essential aid. The two friends arrived at last at
Colonel Wyndham's together. Mrs. Lane and her party here took leave of the king, and returned
northward toward her home.

Colonel Wyndham was a personal acquaintance of the king. He had been an officer under Charles
I., in the civil wars preceding that monarch's captivity and death, and Charles, who, as Prince
of Wales, had made a campaign as will be recollected, in the west of England before he went
to France, had had frequent intercourse with Wyndham, and bad great confidence in his fidelity.
The colonel had been at last shut up in a castle, and had finally surrendered on such conditions
as secured his own liberty and safety. He had, consequently, since been allowed to live quietly
at his own estate in Trent, though he was watched and suspected by the government as a known
friend of the king's. Charles had, of course, great confidence in him. He was very cordially
received into his house, and very securely secreted there.

It would be dangerous for Wyndham himself to do any thing openly in respect to finding a vessel
to convey the king to France. He accordingly engaged a trusty friend to go down to the sea-port
on the coast which was nearest to his residence, and see what he could do. This sea-port was
Lyme, or Lyme-Regis, as it is sometimes called. It was about twenty-five miles from Trent,
where Wyndham resided, toward the southwest, and about the same distance to the eastward of
Exeter, where Charles's mother had some years before sought refuge from her husband's enemies.

Colonel Wyndham's messenger went to Lyme. He found there, pretty soon, the master of a small
vessel, which was accustomed to ply back and forth to one of the ports on the coast of France,
to carry merchandise. The messenger, after making inquiries, and finding that the captain,
if captain he may be called, was the right sort of man for such an enterprise, obtained an
interview with him and introduced conversation by asking when he expected to go back to France.
The captain replied that it would probably be some time before he should be able to make up
another cargo. "How should you like to take some passengers?" said the messenger. "Passengers?"
inquired the captain. "Yes," rejoined the other; "there are two gentlemen here who wish to
cross the Channel privately, and they are willing to pay fifty pounds to be landed at any port
on the other side. Will you take them?"

The captain perceived that it was a serious business. There was a proclamation out, offering
a reward for the apprehension of the king, or Charles Stuart as they called him, and also for
other of the leaders at the battle of Worcester. All persons, too, were strictly prohibited
from taking any one across the Channel; and to conceal the king, or to connive in any way at
his escape, was death. The captain, however, at length agreed to the proposal, influenced as
the colonel's messenger supposed, partly by the amount of his pay, and partly by his interest
in the Royal cause. He agreed to make his little vessel ready without delay.

They did not think it prudent for the king to attempt to embark at Lyme, but there was, a few
miles to the eastward of it, along the shore, a small village named Charmouth, where there
was a creek jutting up from the sea, and a little pier, sufficient for the landing of so small
a vessel as the one they had engaged. It was agreed that, on an appointed day, the king and
Lord Wilmot were to come down to Charmouth, and take up their lodgings at the inn; that in
the night the captain was to sail out of the port of Lyme, in the most private manner possible,
and come to Charmouth; and that the king and Wilmot, who would, in the mean time, be watching
from the inn, when they saw the light of the approaching vessel, should come down to the pier
and embark, and the captain then immediately sail away.

The messenger accordingly went back to Colonel Wyndham's with intelligence of the plan that
he had formed, while the captain of the vessel went to work as privately as possible to lay
in his stores and make his other preparations for sea. He did this with the utmost precaution
and secrecy, and succeeded in deceiving every body but his wife. Wives have the opportunity
to perceive indications of the concealed existence of matters of moment and weight which others
do not enjoy, in studying the countenances of their husbands. A man can easily, through the
day, when surrounded by the world, assume an unconcerned and careless air, though oppressed
with a very considerable mental burden; but when he comes home at night, he instinctively throws
off half his disguise, and conjugal watchfulness and solicitude easily penetrate the remainder.
At least it was so in this case. The captain's dame perceived that her husband was thoughtful
and absent minded. She watched him. She observed some indications that he was making preparations
for sea. She asked him what it meant. He said he did not know how soon he might have a cargo,
and he wanted to be all ready in season. His wife, however, was not satisfied. She watched
him more closely still, and when the appointed night came on which he had agreed to sail, finding
that it was impossible for him to elude her vigilance, he told her plainly, that he was going
across the Channel on private business, but that he should immediately return.

She declared positively that he should not go. She knew, she said, that the business was something
which would end in ruining him and his family, and she was determined that he should not risk
her safety and his own life in any such desperate and treasonable plans. She locked the door
upon him, and when he insisted on being released, she declared that if he did attempt to go,
she would immediately give warning to the authorities, and have him arrested and confined.
So the discomfited captain was compelled to give up his design, and break his appointment at
the Charmouth pier.

In the mean time, the king and Lord Wilmot came down, as had been agreed upon, to Charmouth,
and put up, with many other travelers, at the inn. There was great excitement all over that
part of the country, every one talking about the battle of Worcester, the escape of the king,
and especially about an expedition which Cromwell had been organizing, which was then assembling
on the southern coast. Its destination was the island of Jersey, which had thus far adhered
to the Royalist cause, and which Cromwell was now intending to reduce to subjection to him.
The bustle and movement which all these causes combined to create, made the king and Lord Wilmot
very anxious and uneasy. There were assemblies convened in the villages which they passed through,
and men were haranguing the populace on the victories which had been gained, and on the future
measures to be pursued. In one place the bells were ringing, and bonfires were burning in celebration
of the death of the king, it being rumored and believed that he had been shot.

Our two fugitives, however, arrived safely at the inn, put up their horses, and began to watch
anxiously for the light of the approaching vessel. They watched, of course, in vain. Midnight
came, but no vessel. They waited hour after hour, till at last morning dawned, and they found
that all hope of accomplishing their enterprise must be abandoned. They could not remain where
they were, however, another day, without suspicion; so they prepared to move on and seek temporary
refuge in some other neighboring town, while they could send one of the attendants who came
with them back to Colonel Wyndham's, to see if he could ascertain the cause of the failure.
One or two days were spent in inquiries, negotiations, and delays. The result was, that all
hope of embarking at Lyme had to be abandoned, and it was concluded that the fugitives should
proceed on to the eastward, along the coast, to the care of another Royalist, a certain Colonel
Gunter, who might perhaps find means to send them away from some port in that part of the country.
At any rate, they would, by this plan, escape the excitements and dangers which seemed to environ
them in the neighborhood of Lyme.

It was fortunate that they went away from Charmouth when they did; by doing so they narrowly
escaped apprehension; for that night, while the king's horse was in the stable, a smith was
sent for to set a shoe upon the horse of one of the other travelers. After finishing his work,
he began to examine the feet of the other horses in the stalls, and when he came to the one
which the king had rode, his attention was particularly attracted to the condition and appearance
of the shoes, and he remarked to those who were with him that that horse had come a long journey,
and that of the four shoes, he would warrant that no two had been made in the same county.
This remark was quoted the next day, and the mysterious circumstance, trifling as it was, was
sufficient, in the highly excitable state of the public mind, to awaken attention. People came
to see the horse, and to inquire for the owner, but they found that both had disappeared. They
immediately determined that the stranger must have been the king, or at least some distinguished
personage in disguise, and they sent in search of the party in every direction; but the travelers
had taken such effectual precautions to blind all pursuit that their track could not be followed.

In the mean time, the king journeyed secretly on from the residence of one faithful adherent
to another, encountering many perplexities, and escaping narrowly many dangers, until he came
at last to the neighborhood of Shoreham, a town upon the coast of Sussex. Colonel Gunter had
provided a vessel here. It was a small vessel, bound, with a load of coal, along the coast,
to the westward, to a port called Pool, beyond the Isle of Wight. Colonel Gunter had arranged
it with the master to deviate from his voyage, by crossing over to the coast of France, and
leaving his passengers there. He was then to return, and proceed to his original destination.
Both the owner of the vessel and the master who commanded it were Royalists, but they had not
been told that it was the king whom they were going to convey. In the bargain which had been
made with them, the passengers had been designated simply as two gentlemen of rank who had
escaped from the battle of Worcester. When, however, the master of the vessel saw the king,
he immediately recognized him, having seen him before in his campaigns under his father. This,
however, seemed to make no difference in his readiness to convey the passengers away. He said
that hews perfectly willing to risk his life to save that of his sovereign, and the arrangements
for the embarkation proceeded.

The little vessel--its burden was about sixty tons--was brought into a small cove at Brighthelmstone,
a few miles to the eastward from Shoreham, and run upon the beach, where it was left stranded
when the tide went down. The king and Lord Wilmot went to it by night, ascended its side by
a ladder, went down immediately into the cabin, and concealed themselves there. When the rising
tide had lifted the vessel, with its precious burden, gently from the sand, the master made
easy sail, and coasted along the English shore toward the Isle of Wight, which was the direction
of the voyage which he had originally intended to make. He did not wish the people at Shoreham
to observe any alteration of his course, since that might have awakened suspicion, and possibly
invited pursuit; so they went on for a time to the westward, which was a course that rather
increased than diminished their distance from their place of destination.

It was seven o'clock in the morning when they sailed. There was a gentle October breeze from
the north, which carried them slowly along the shore, and in the afternoon the Isle of Wight
came fully into view. There were four men and a boy on board the ship, constituting the crew.
The master came to the king in the cabin, and proposed to him, as a measure of additional security,
and to prevent the possibility of any opposition on the part of the sailors to the proposed
change in their course which it would now soon be necessary to make, that the king and Lord
Wilmot should propose the plan of going to France to them, asking their interest with the captain
in obtaining his consent, as it had not yet been mentioned to the captain at all; for the sailors
had of course understood that the voyage was only the usual coastwise trip to the port of Pool,
and that these strangers were ordinary travelers, going on that voyage. The master, therefore,
thought that there would be less danger of difficulty if the king were first to gain the sailors
over himself, by promises or rewards, and then all come together to gain the captain's consent,
which could then, at last, with apparent reluctance, be accorded.

This plan was pursued. The two travelers went to the sailors upon the forecastle, and told
them, with an air of honest confidence, that they were not what they seemed. They were merchants,
they said, and were unfortunately a little in debt, and under the necessity of leaving England
for a time. They had some money due to them in Rouen, in France, and they wanted very much
to be taken across the Channel to Dieppe, or some port near Rouen. They made known their condition
to the sailors, they said, because they wanted their intercession with the captain to take
them over, and they gave the sailors a good generous present in money for them to spend in
drink; not so generous, however, as to cast suspicion upon their story of being traders in
distress.

Sailors are easily persuaded by arguments that are enforced by small presents of money. They
consented to the plan, and then the king and Lord Wilmot went to express their wishes to the
captain. He made many objections. It would delay him on his voyage, and lead to many inconveniences.
The passengers, however, urged their request, the sailors seconding them. The wind was fair,
and they could easily run across the Channel, and then, after they landed, the captain could
pursue his course to the place of his destination. The captain finally consented; the helm
was altered, the sails were trimmed, and the little vessel bore away toward its new destination
on the coast of France.

It was now five o'clock in the afternoon. The English coast soon disappeared from the horizon,
and the next morning, at daylight, they could see the French shore. They approached the land
at a little port called Fecamp. The wind, however, failed them before they got quite to the
land, and they had to anchor to wait for a turn of the tide to help them in. In this situation,
they were soon very much alarmed by the appearance of a vessel in the offing, which was coming
also toward the shore. They thought it was a Spanish privateer, and its appearance brought
a double apprehension. There was danger that the privateer would capture them, France and Spain
being then at war. There was danger, also, that the master of their vessel, afraid himself
of being captured, might insist on making all haste back again to the English coast; for the
wind, though contrary so long as they wished to go on into their harbor, was fair for taking
them away. The king and Lord Wilmot consulted together, and came to the conclusion to go ashore
in the little boat. They soon made a bargain with the sailors to row them, and, hastily descending
the vessel's side, they entered the boat, and pushed off over the rolling surges of the Channel.

They were two miles from the shore, but they reached it in safety. The sailors went back to
the vessel. The privateer turned out to be a harmless trader coming into port. The English
vessel recrossed the Channel, and went on to its original port of destination; and Lord Wilmot
and the king, relieved now of all their anxieties and fears, walked in their strange English
dress up into the village to the inn.

CHAPTER IX.

THE RESTORATION.

As the readers of a tale are generally inclined to sympathize with the hero of it, both in
his joys and in his sorrows, whether he is deserving of sympathy or not, they who follow the
adventures of Charles in his wanderings in England after the unfortunate battle of Worcester,
feel ordinarily quite a strong sensation of pleasure at finding him at last safely landed on
the French shore. Charles himself doubtless experienced at first an overwhelming emotion of
exultation and joy at having thus saved himself from the desperate dangers of his condition
in England. On cool reflection, however, he soon perceived that there was but little cause
for rejoicing in his condition and prospects. There were dangers and sufferings enough still
before him, different, it is true, from those in which he had been involved, but still very
dark and threatening in character. He had now, in fact, ten years of privation, poverty, and
exile before him, full of troubles from beginning to end.

The new series of troubles began to come upon him, too, very soon. When he and his companion
went up to the inn, on the morning of their landing, dressed as they were in the guise of Englishmen
of humble rank, and having been put ashore, too, from a vessel which immediately afterward
sailed away, they were taken for English thieves, or fugitives from justice, and refused admission
to the inn. They sent to some gentlemen of the neighborhood, to whom they made themselves known,
so that this difficulty was removed, their urgent wants were supplied, and they were provided
with the means of transportation to Paris. Of course, the mother of the fugitive monarch, yet
almost a boy, was rejoiced to welcome him, but he received no very cordial welcome from any
one else. Now that Charles had finally abandoned England, his adherents there gave up his cause,
of course, as totally lost. The Republicans, with Cromwell at their head, established a very
firm and efficient government, which the nations of the Continent soon began to find that it
would be incumbent on them to respect. For any foreign court to harbor a pretender to the British
crown, when there was an established government in England based on a determination of the
people to abrogate royalty altogether, was to incur very considerable political danger. Charles
soon found that, under these circumstances, he was not likely to be long a very welcome guest
in the French palaces.

He remained, however, in Paris for a short time, endeavoring to find some way to retrieve his
ruined fortunes. Anne Maria was still there, and he attempted to renew his suit to her. She
listened to the entertaining stories which he told of his dangers and escapes in England, and
for a time, as Charles thought, encouraged his attentions. In fact, at one time he really believed
that the affair was all settled, and began to assume that it was so in speaking with her upon
the subject. She, however, at length undeceived him, in a conversation which ended with her
saying that she thought he had better go back to England, and "either get his head broken,
or else have a crown upon it." The fact was, that Anne Maria was now full of a new scheme for
being married to Louis XIV. himself, who, though much younger than she, had attained now to
a marriageable age, and she had no intention of regarding Charles in any other light than as
one of the ordinary crowd of her admirers. She finally extinguished all his hopes by coolly
requesting him not to visit her so frequently.

In addition to his other sources of discomfort. Charles disagreed with his mother. She was
a very decided Catholic, and he a Protestant, from policy it is true, and not principle, but
he was none the less rigid and inflexible on that account. He and his mother disagreed in respect
to the education of the younger children. They were both restricted in their means, too, and
subject to a thousand mortifications from this cause, in the proud and haughty circle in which
they moved. Finally, the king decided to leave Paris altogether, and try to find a more comfortable
refuge in Holland.

His sister and her husband, the Prince of Orange, had always treated him, as well as all the
rest of the family, with great kindness and attention; but now, to complete the catalogue of
his disasters, the Prince of Orange died, the power of the government passed into other hands,
and Mary found herself deprived of influence and honor, and reduced all at once to a private
station. She would have been glad to continue her protection to her brother, but the new government
feared the power of Cromwell. Cromwell sent word to them that England would consider their
harboring of the fugitive as tantamount to a declaration of war; so they notified Charles that
he must leave their dominions, and find, if he could, some other place of retreat. He went
up the Rhine to the city of Cologne, where it is said he found a widow woman, who received
him as a lodger without pay, trusting to his promise to recompense her at some future time.
There is generally little risk in giving credit to European monarchs, expelled by the temporary
triumph of Republicanism from their native realms. They are generally pretty certain of being
sooner or later restored to their thrones.

At any rate, Charles was restored, and his restoration was effected in a manner wholly unexpected
to all mankind. In order that the circumstances may be clearly understood, the reader must
recall it to mind that Charles the First had been deposed and beheaded by the action of a Parliament,
and that this Parliament was, of course, at his death the depository of sovereign power in
England. In a short time, however, the army, with Cromwell at its head, became too strong for
the Parliament. Cromwell assumed the supreme power under the name of the Protector. He dissolved
Parliament, and expelled the members from their seats. He governed the country as protector
for many years, and when at length he died, his son Richard Cromwell attempted to take his
place. Richard did not, however, possess the talent and energy of his father, and he soon found
himself totally inadequate to manage the affairs of government in such stormy times. He was
deposed, and the old Parliament which Cromwell had broken up was restored.

There followed, then, a new contest between the Parliament and the army, with an officer named
Lambert at the head of the latter. The army proved the strongest. Lambert stationed guards
in the streets leading to the Parliament House one day when the members were about to assemble,
and turned the members all back as they came. When the speaker arrived in his carriage, he
ordered his soldiers to take hold of the horses' heads and turn them round, and lead them home
again. Thus there was no actual outward violence, but the members of Parliament were intimidated,
and gave up the attempt to exercise their power, though they still reserved their claim, and
their party was busy all over the kingdom in attempting to restore them to their functions.
In the mean time, the army appointed a sort of council, which they invested with supreme authority.

It does not come within the scope and design of this volume to give a full account of the state
of public affairs during the interregnum between the death of Charles I. and the Restoration
of the monarchy under Charles II., nor of the points of controversy at issue among the various
parties formed. The reader, however, must not suppose that, during this period, there was at
any time what could, with any propriety, be called a republic. A true republic exists only
where the questions of government are fairly and honorably submitted to the whole population,
with a universal disposition to acquiesce peaceably in the decision of the majority, when that
is ascertained. There probably has never been any such state of things as this in any country
of Europe since the Christian era. There certainly was no such state of things in England in
the time of the Commonwealth. There were a great many persons who wished to have it so, and
who called themselves Republicans; but their plan, if that were indeed their plan, was never
tried. Very likely it was not practicable to try it. At any rate, it certainly was not tried.
The sovereignty taken from the Stuart dynasty in the person of Charles I. was never vested
in the people at large. It was seized forcibly by the various powers already existing in the
state, as they found themselves, one after another, able to seize it. The Parliament took,
it from Charles. The army took it from Parliament. Then Oliver Cromwell took it from the army.
He found himself strong enough to hold it as long as he lived, and when he died he delivered
it to his son Richard. Richard could not hold it. The Parliament rose to a sort of supplementary
existence, and took it from Richard, and then the army took it from Parliament again. Finally,
General Monk appeared upon the stage in Scotland, as we shall presently see, marched down through
England, and, with the help of thousands and thousands who were tired of these endless changes,
took it from the army and restored it once more to the Parliament, on condition of their placing
it back again in the hands of the king. He shared her breakfast as he had shared her supper; and immediately
after breakfast, mother and daughter, attended by nurserymaid and
footman, sallied forth to provide proper luxuries for Chloe's accommodation.

First they purchased a sheepskin rug; then a splendid porcelain trough for water, and a porcelain
dish to match, for food; then a spaniel basket, duly lined, and stuffed, and curtained--a splendid
piece of canine upholstery; then a necklace-like collar with silver bells, which was left to have
the address engraved upon the clasp; and then May, finding herself in the vicinity of a hosier and a
shoemaker, bethought herself of a want which undoubtedly had not occurred to any other of
her party, and holding up her own pretty little foot, demanded "tilk tocks and boo thoose for
Tloë."

For two days did Chloe endure the petting and the luxuries. On the third she disappeared. Great was
the consternation in Camden Place. Pretty May cried as she had never been known to cry before;
and papa, mamma, grandmammas, aunts, nursery and house-maids, fretted and wondered, wondered
and fretted, and vented their distress in every variety of exclamation, from the refined language
of the drawing-room to the patois of a Somersetshire kitchen. Rewards were offered, and handbills
dispersed over the town. She was cried, and she was advertised; and at last, giving up every
hope of her recovery, Mrs. Keating wrote to me.

It happened that we received the letter on one of those soft November days, which sometimes intervene
between the rough winds of October and the crisp frosts of Christmas,
and which, although too dirty under foot to be quite pleasant for
walking, are yet, during the few hours that the sun is above the horizon,
mild enough for an open carriage in our shady lanes, strewed as they
are at that period with the yellow leaves of the elm, whilst the hedgerows
are still rich with the tawny foliage of the oak, and the rich colouring
of the hawthorn and the bramble.

It was such weather as the Americans generally enjoy at this season, and call by the pretty name
of the Indian summer. And we resolved to avail ourselves of the fineness of the day to drive
to Ashley End, and inform Mrs. King and Tom (who we felt ought to know) of the loss of Chloe,
and our fear, according with Mrs. Keating's, that she had been stolen; adding our persuasion,
which was also that of Mrs. Keating, that, fall into whatever hands she might, she was too beautiful
and valuable not to ensure good usage.

On the way we were overtaken by the good widow's landlord, returning from hunting, in his red coat
and top-boots, who was also bound to Ashley End. As he rode chatting by the side of the carriage,
we could not forbear telling him our present errand, and the whole story of poor Chloe. How
often, without being particularly uncharitable in judging of our neighbours, we have the gratification
of finding them even better than we had supposed! He blamed us for not having thought well
enough of him to put the whole affair into his management from the first, and exclaimed against
us for fearing that he would compare the preserves and the pheasant-shooting with such an
attachment as had subsisted between his good old tenant and her faithful
dog.

"By Jove!" cried he, "I would have paid the tax myself rather than they should have been parted.
But it's too late to talk of that now, for, of course, the dog is stolen. Eighty miles is too
far even for a spaniel to find its way back!
 Monk, as he approached London, sent
word to Parliament asking that quarters might be provided for him and his army there. Parliament,
desirous of conciliating him and securing his co-operation in sustaining their power, acceded
to this request. The other troops were removed; Monk entered London in triumph, and took possession
of all the strong holds there, holding them nominally under Parliamentary authority Monk still
kept his ultimate designs profoundly secret. No party very strongly opposed him, for no party
knew whether to regard him as an enemy or a friend. The Royalists, however, all over the kingdom,
took new courage, and a general expectation began to pervade the minds of men that the monarchy
was to be restored. The Parliament rescinded the votes which had been most decisive against
the house of Stuart and monarchical rule. The most prominent Republicans were dismissed from
office under various pretexts, and men known to be loyal were appointed in their place. Finally,
the Parliament itself was dissolved, and writs were issued for the election of a new one, more
in accordance with the ancient forms.

When at length this new Parliament assembled, the public mind was in a great fever of excitement,
there being a vague expectation every where that the monarchy was to be restored, while yet
the Restoration was openly spoken of by no one. The first votes which were taken in the House
of Commons indicated a very favorable state of feeling toward monarchy; and at length, a few
days after the opening of the session, it was announced that there was a messenger at the door
with a communication from the king. The announcement was received with the wildest acclamations
of joy. The messenger was immediately ordered to enter. The communication was read, the vast
assembly listening with breathless attention.

It contained, in the first place, a letter, in which the king stated that, having heard that
the people of England had restored the Parliament according to the ancient forms, he hoped
that now the Parliament would go on and complete the good work which had been begun, and heal
the distractions of the kingdom by reinstating him as sovereign in the ancient rights and prerogatives
of the crown.

The second part of the king's communication, and by far the most important part, was what was
called his Declaration, a document in which he announced formally what his intentions were
in case he were restored to the throne. One of these assurances was, that he was ready to forgive
and forget the past, so far as he might himself be supposed to have cause of complaint against
any of his subjects for the part they had taken in the late transactions. He professed his
readiness to grant a free pardon to all, excepting those who should be expressly excluded from
such pardon by the Parliament itself. The Declaration also set forth that, inasmuch as there
was prevailing throughout the country a great diversity of religious opinion, the king, if
restored to his throne, whatever his own religious views or those of his government might be,
would agree that his subjects should be allowed full liberty of conscience in all respects,
and that nobody should be molested in any way on account of his religious faith or usages of
worship.

And, finally, the Declaration contained a covenant on the part of the king, that whereas there
had been great changes of property, arising from fines and confiscations for political offenses
during the period of the Revolution, he would not himself disturb the existing titles to property,
but would leave them to be settled on such principles and in such a way as Parliament should
direct.

The letter from the king, and especially the Declaration, gave the utmost satisfaction. The
latter disarmed those who would otherwise have opposed the return of the king, by quieting
their fears of being disturbed in respect to their liberty or their property. Immediately after
these papers were read, they were ordered to be published, and were sent every where throughout
the kingdom, awakening, wherever they went the greatest demonstrations of joy. The Parliament
passed a vote that the ancient Constitution of the kingdom, of government by king, Lords, and
Commons, ought to be restored, and they went forth in a body into the public places of the
city to proclaim Charles II. king.

Parliament voted immediately a grant of fifty thousand pounds, a sum equal to more than two
hundred thousand dollars, for the king's immediate use, with large sums besides for the other
members of the family, and sent a committee of noblemen to Holland to carry the money and to
invite the king back to his dominions. As soon as tidings of these events reached the Continent,
every body hastened to pay their court to his majesty. From being neglected, destitute, and
wretched, he suddenly found himself elevated to the highest pinnacle of prosperity and fame.
Every body offered him their aid; his court was thronged, and all were ready to do him honor.
The princely mother of one of the young ladies who had rejected the offer of his hand in the
day of his adversity, sent him an intimation that the offer would be accepted if he would renew
it now.

A fleet crossed the Channel to receive the king and convey him to London. His brother James,
the Duke, of York, was placed in command of it as Lord High Admiral of England. The fleet sailed
for Dover. General Monk went to Dover to receive the king at his landing. He escorted him to
London, where the monarch, returning from his long exile, arrived on the twenty-ninth of May,
the very day when he became thirty years of age.

General Monk, whose talent, skill, and consummate management had been the means of effecting
this great change without violence or bloodshed, was rewarded by being made Duke of Albermarle.
This was a very great reward. In fact, no American imagination can conceive of the images of
glory and grandeur which are connected in the mind of an Englishman with the idea of being
made a duke. A duke lives in a palace; he is surrounded by a court; he expends princely revenues;
he reigns, in fact, often, so far as the pomp and pleasure of reigning are concerned, over
quite a little kingdom, and is looked up to by the millions beneath his grade with a reverence
as great, at least, as that with which the ancients looked up to their gods. He is deprived
of nothing which pertains to power but the mere toil, and care, and responsibility of ruling,
so that he has all the sweetness and fragrance of sovereignty without its thorns. In a word,
the seat of an English duke, so far as earthly greatness and glory are concerned, is undoubtedly
the finest which ambition, wealth, and power combined have ever succeeded in carving out for
man. It is infinitely better than a throne.

Some historians maintain that Monk acted on a secret understanding with Charles from the commencement;
that the general was to restore the king, and was then to receive a dukedom for his reward.
Others say that he acted from a simple sense of duty in all that he did, and that the lofty
elevation to which he was raised was a very natural and suitable testimonial of the royal gratitude.
The reader will embrace the one or the other of the two theories, according to the degree of
readiness or of reluctance with which he believes in the existence of conscientious principles
of patriotism and loyalty among the great men who rule the world.

CHAPTER X.

THE MARRIAGE.

During the period of King Charles's days of adversity he made many fruitless attempts to obtain
a wife. He was rejected by all the young ladies to whom he made proposals. Marriages in that
grade of society are almost always mere transactions of business, being governed altogether
by political and prudential considerations. In all Charles's proposals he was aiming simply
at strengthening his own position by means of the wealth or family influence of the bride,
supposing as he did that the honor of being even nominally a queen would be a sufficient equivalent
to the lady. The ladies themselves, however, to whom he addressed himself, or their friends,
thought that the prospect of his being really restored to his throne was very remote and uncertain,
and, in the mean time, the empty name of queen was not worth as much as a rich and powerful
heiress, by becoming his bride, would have to pay for it.

After his restoration, however, all this was changed. There was no longer any difficulty. He
had now only to choose. In fact, one or two who had refused him when he was a fugitive and
an exile thought differently of the case now that he was a king, and one of them, as has already
been said, gave him intimations, through her friends, that if he were inclined to renew his
suit, he would be more successful. Charles rejected these overtures with indignant disdain.

The lady whom he ultimately married was a Portuguese princess. Her father was King of Portugal,
but before his accession to the throne his title had been the Duke of Braganza. The name of
his daughter was Catharine. She is thus known generally in history by the name of Catharine
of Braganza.

It is said that the plan of this marriage originated with Queen Henrietta Maria, and that a
prominent motive with her in promoting the measure was her desire to secure for Charles a Catholic
wife. Catharine of Braganza was a Catholic. Henrietta Maria was deeply interested, and no doubt
conscientiously so, in bringing back her own family and their descendants, and the realm of
England, if possible, to the ancient faith: and this question of the marriage of her son she
justly considered would have a very important bearing on the result.

Queen Henrietta is said to have laid her arrangements in train for opening the negotiation
with the Portuguese princess, at a visit which she made to England in 1660, very soon after
her son's restoration. The Restoration took place in May. The queen's visit to her son was
in October. Of course, after all the long years of danger, privation, and suffering which this
family had endured, the widowed mother felt an intense emotion of joy at finding her children
once more restored to what she considered their just hereditary rights. Charles was on the
English throne. James, the Duke of York, was Lord High Admiral of England, that is, the commander-in-chief
of the naval forces of the realm; and her other children, those who were still living, were
in peace and safety. Of course, her heart was full of maternal pride and joy.

Her son James, the Lord High Admiral, went across the Channel to Dover, with a fleet of the
finest ships that he could select from the whole British navy, to escort his mother to England.
The queen was to embark at Calais. [Footnote: For a view of the famous Calais pier, see History
of Mary Queen of Scots, page 105.] The queen came down to the port from Paris, attended by
many friends, who sympathized with her in the return of her prosperity, and were attracted,
besides, by the grand spectacle which they thought would be presented by the appearance and
maneuvers of the English ships, and the ceremony of the embarkation.

The waters of the English Channel are disturbed by almost perpetual agitations, which bleak
winds and rapid tides, struggling continually together, combine to raise; and many a traveler,
who passes in comfort across the Atlantic, is made miserable by the incessant restlessness
of this narrow sea. At the time, however, when Henrietta Maria crossed it, the waters for once
were calm. The people who assembled upon the pier to witness the embarkation looked over the
expanse before them, and saw it lying smooth, every where, as glass, and reflecting the great
English ships which lay at a little distance from the shore as if it were a mirror. It was
a bright and beautiful October morning. The air seemed perfectly motionless. The English ships
were adorned with countless flags in honor of the occasion, but they all hung down perfectly
lifeless upon the masts and rigging. Scarcely a ripple rolled upon the beach; and so silent
and still was the morning air, that the voices and echoes came from vast distances along the
shore, and the dip of the oars of the boats gliding about in the offing sent its sound for
miles around over the smooth surface of the sea; and when the grand salute was fired at the
embarkation of the queen, the reverberation of the guns was heard distinctly, it was said,
at Dover, a distance of thirty miles.

Even in such a calm as this, however, uncommon as it is, the atmosphere is not perfectly still.
When the royal party were on board the vessels and the sails were set, the fleet did begin
to glide, almost imperceptibly, it is true, away from the shore. In the course of the day they
had receded several miles from the land, and when the dinner hour arrived they found that the
lord admiral had provided a most sumptuous banquet on board. Just before the time, however,
for setting down to the table, the duke found that it was a Catholic fast day, and that neither
his mother nor any of her attendants, being, as they were, all Catholics, could eat any thing
but fish; and, unfortunately, as all James's men were Protestants, they had not thought of
the fast, and they had no fish on board. They, however, contrived to produce a sturgeon for
the queen, and they sat down to the table, the queen to the dish provided for her, and the
others to bread and vegetables, and such other food as the Catholic ritual allowed, while the
duke himself and his brother officers disposed, as well as they could, of the more luxurious
dainties which they had intended for their guests.

With a fair wind, three hours is sufficient for the run from Calais to Dover. It took the Duke
of York two days to get his fleet across in this calm. At length, however, they arrived. The
king was on the pier to receive his mother. Rejoiced as her majesty must have been to be welcomed
by her son under such circumstances, she must have thought mournfully of her departed husband
at the time of her landing, for it was here that he had taken leave of her some years before,
when the troubles of her family were beginning. Charles conducted his mother to the castle.
All the inhabitants of Dover, and of the country around, had assembled to witness the arrival,
and they welcomed the mother back to the land of her husband and her sons with long and loud
acclamations.

There was a great banquet at Dover Castle. Here all the members of the royal family were present,
having been assembled for the occasion. Of course, it was an occasion of great family rejoicing,
mingled undoubtedly, on the part of the queen, with many mournful thoughts and bitter recollections.
The fast was past, and there was, consequently, no difficulty now about partaking of the food
that had been provided; but another difficulty arose, having the same origin, viz., the question
whether the divine blessing should be implored upon the food by a Catholic priest or an Episcopal
chaplain. Neither party could conscientiously acquiesce in the performance of the service by
the other. They settled the important question, or rather it settled itself at last, in the
following manner: When the guests were ready to take their places at table, the king, instead
of asking his mother's spiritual guide to officiate, as both Christian and filial courtesy
required him to have done, called upon his own chaplain. The chaplain said grace. Immediately
afterward, the Catholic priest, thinking that fidelity to his own religious faith required
him to act decidedly, repeated the service in the Catholic form, ending with making the sign
of the cross in a very conspicuous manner over the table. The gentry of Dover, who had been
admitted as spectators of this banquet, were greatly scandalized at this deed. They regarded
the gesture as an act of very wicked and vary dangerous idolatry.

From Dover the queen proceeded with her children to London. Her sons did every thing in their
power to honor their mother's visit; they received her with great parade and pomp, assigned
her a sumptuous residence, and studied every means of amusing her, and of making her visit
a source of pleasure. But they did not succeed. The queen was very unhappy. Every place that
she visited recalled to her mind the memory of her husband, and awakened afresh all her sorrows.
She was distressed, too, by some domestic troubles, which we have not here time to describe.
Then the religious differences between herself and her children, and the questions which were
arising out of them continually, gave her a great deal of pain; she could not but perceive,
moreover, that she was regarded with suspicion and dislike by the people of England on account
of her Catholic faith. Then, besides, notwithstanding her English husband and her English children,
she was herself a French woman still in character, thought, feeling, and language, and she
could not feel really at home north of the Channel. After remaining, therefore, a few months
in London, and arranging some family and business affairs which required her attention, she
determined to return. The king accompanied her to Portsmouth, where she set sail, taking the
little princess Henrietta with her, and went back to France. Among the family affairs, however,
which she arranged, it is said that the marriage of her son, the king, was a special object
of her attention, and that she secretly laid the train which resulted in his espousing Catharine
of Braganza.

According to the accounts given in the chronicles of the times, the negotiations were opened
in the following manner: One day the Portuguese ambassador at London came to a certain high
officer of the king's household, and introduced the subject of his majesty's marriage, saying,
in the course of the conversation, that he thought the Princess Catharine of Portugal would
be a very eligible match, and adding moreover, that he was authorized to say that, with the
lady, very advantageous terms could be offered. Charles said he would think of it. This gave
the ambassador sufficient encouragement to induce him to take another step. He obtained an
audience of Charles the next day, and proposed the subject directly for his consideration.
The ambassador knew very well that the question would turn, in Charles's mind, on the pecuniary
and political advantages of the match; so he stated at once what they would be. He was authorized
to offer, he said, the sum of five hundred thousand pounds [Footnote: Equal to two or three
millions of dollars.] as the princess's portion, and to surrender to the English crown various
foreign possessions, which had, till then, belonged to the Portuguese. One of the principal
of these was the island of Bombay in the East Indies. Another was Tangier, a port in Africa.
The English did not, at that time, hold any East Indian territories. He likewise offered to
convey to the English nation the right of trading with the great South American country of
Brazil, which then pertained to the Portuguese crown.

Charles was very much pleased with these proposals. He immediately consulted his principal
minister of state, Lord Clarendon, the celebrated historian, and soon afterward called a meeting
of his privy council and laid the case before them. Clarendon asked him if he had given up
all thoughts of a Protestant connection. Charles said that he did not know where to look for
a Protestant wife. It was true, in fact, that nearly all the royal families of Europe were
Catholics, and royal bridegrooms must always have royal brides. There were, however, Protestant
princesses in Germany; this was suggested to his majesty, but he replied, with an expression
of contempt, that they were all dull and foggy, and he could not possibly have one of them
for a wife.

The counselors then began to look at the pecuniary and political advantages of the proposed
bargain. They got out their maps, and showed Charles where Bombay, and Tangier, and the other
places offered with the lady as her dowry lay. The statesmen were quite pleased with the prospect
of these acquisitions, and Charles was particularly gratified with the money item. It was twice
as much, they said, as any English king had ever before received as the marriage portion of
a bride. In a word, the proposition was unanimously considered as in every respect entirely
satisfactory, and Charles authorized his ministers to open the negotiations for the marriage
immediately. All this time Charles had never seen the lady, and perhaps had never heard of
her before. Her own individual qualifications, whether of mind or of person, seem to have been
considered a subject not worth inquiring about at all.

Nor ought we to be at all surprised at this. It was not Charles's object, in seeking a wife,
to find some one whom he was to cherish and love, and who was to promote his happiness by making
him the object of her affection in return. His love, so far as such a soul is capable of love,
was to be gratified by other means. He had always some female favorite, chosen from among the
ladies of his court, high in rank, though not high enough to be the wedded wife of the king.
These attachments were not private in any sense, nor was any attempt made to conceal them,
the king being in the habit of bestowing upon the objects of them all the public attentions,
as well as the private intimacy which pertain to wedded life. The king's favorite at the present
time was Lady Castlemaine. She was originally a Mrs. Palmer, but the king had made her husband
Lord Castlemaine for the purpose of giving a title to the wife. Some years afterward he made
her a duchess. She was a prominent lady in the court, being every where received and honored
as the temporary wife of the king. He did not intend, in marrying the Princess Catharine, to
disturb this state of things at all. She was to be in name his wife, but he was to place his
affections where he pleased. She was to have her own palace, her own household, and her own
pleasures, and he, on the other hand, was to continue to have his.

Notwithstanding this, however, Charles seemed to have had some consideration for the personal
appearance of his proposed bride, after all. The Spanish government, as soon as Charles's plan
of espousing Catharine became known, attempted to prevent the match, as it would greatly increase
the strength and influence of Portugal by giving to that country so powerful an ally. Spain
had plenty of money, but no princess in the royal family; and the government therefore proposed
to Charles, that if he would be content to take some Protestant lady for a wife, they would
endow her, and with a portion as great as that which had been offered with Catharine. They,
moreover, represented to Charles that Catharine was out of health, and very plain and repulsive
in her personal appearance, and that, besides, it would be a great deal better for him, for
obvious political reasons, to marry a Protestant princess. The other party replied that Catharine
was not ugly by any means, and they showed Charles her portrait, which, after looking at it
a few minutes, he said was not unhandsome. They reminded him, also, that Catharine was only
the third in succession from the crown of Portugal, so that the chance of her actually inheriting
that realm was not at all to be disregarded. Charles thought this a very important consideration,
and, on the whole, decided that the affair should go on; and commissioners were sent to make
a formal proposal of marriage at the Portuguese court. Charles wrote letters to the mother
of the young lady, and to the young lady herself, expressing the personal interest he felt
in obtaining the princess's hand.

The negotiations thus commenced went on for many months, with no other obstruction than the
complication and intricacy which attend all matrimonial arrangements where the interests of
kingdoms, as well as the personal happiness of the wedded pair, are involved in the issue.
Ambassadors were sent, and contracts and treaties were drawn up, discussed, modified, and finally
signed. A formal announcement of the proposed marriage was made to the English Parliament,
and addresses congratulatory were voted and presented in reply. Arrangements were made for
transferring the foreign possessions promised to the British crown; and, lastly, the money
intended for the dower was collected, tied up in bags, sealed, and deposited safely in the
strong room of the Castle at Lisbon. In fact, every thing went on prosperously to the end,
and when all was thus finally settled, Charles wrote the following letter to his expected bride.

"London, 2d of July, 1661. In the mean time, while I am going further from my most sovereign
good, yet I do not complain as to whither I go; seeking in vain tranquility in my restlessness,
looking to see the beloved person of your majesty in these realms already your own; and that
with the same anxiety with which, after my long banishment, I desired to see myself within
them, and my subjects desiring also to behold me among them.

"The very faithful husband of her majesty, whose hand he kisses.
                        CHARLES REX."

The letter was addressed

"To the QUEEN OF GREAT BRITAIN, my wife and lady, whom God preserve."

Whoever reads this letter attentively will see in it that infallible criterion of hypocrisy
and pretense in professions of regard, viz., extravagant ideas feebly and incoherently expressed.
When the heart dictates what is said, the thoughts are natural, and the language plain; but
in composition like the above, we see a continual striving to say something for effect, which
the writer invents by his ingenuity as he goes on, without any honest impulses from the heart
to guide him. He soars one minute and breaks down the next, in absurd alternations of the sublime
and the ridiculous. How honest Charles was in such professions, and what was the kind of connubial
happiness which he was preparing for his bride, is shown by the fact that he was even now spending
all his time with Lady Castlemaine; and, to reconcile her to his marriage with Catharine, he
had promised her that he would make her one of the ladies of the queen's bed chamber as soon
as she arrived in London, which would give him constant opportunities of being in her society.

We have made very little allusion to Catharine herself, thus far, in the account of these transactions,
because she has had, thus far, nothing to do with them. Every thing has been arranged for her
by her mother, who was an ambitious and masculine woman, and at this time the queen regent
of Portugal. Catharine had been kept shut up, all her days, in the most strict seclusion, and
in the most rigorous subjection to her mother's will. It is said that she had hardly been ten
times out of the palace in her life, since her return to it from the convent where she had
been educated. The innocent and simple hearted maiden looked forward to her marriage as to
a release from a tedious and intolerable bondage. They had shown her King Charles's picture,
and had given her an account of his perilous adventures and romantic escapes, and of the courage
and energy which he had sometimes displayed. And that was all she knew. She had her childlike
ideas of love and of conjugal fidelity and happiness, and believed that she was going to realize
them. As she looked forward, therefore, to the period of her departure for England, she longed
impatiently for the time to come, her heart bounding at every thought of the happy hour with
eager anticipations of delight.

An English nobleman--the Earl of Sandwich--was sent with a squadron to bring the bride to England.
He was received, when he entered the Tagus, with great ceremony. A Portuguese minister went
down the river to meet him in a magnificent barge. The nobleman descended to the lowest step
of the ladder which led down the side of the ship, to receive the minister. They ascended the
ladder together, while the ship fired a salute of twenty or thirty guns. They went into the
cabin, and took seats there, with great ceremony. The minister then rose and made an address
of welcome to the English commander. Lord Sandwich replied, and there was then another thundering
salute of cannon.

All this parade and ceremony was, in this case, as it often is, not an expression of real cordiality,
good will, and good faith, but a substitute for them. The English commander, who had been specially
instructed to bring over the money as well as the bride, found, to his great astonishment and
perplexity, that the queen regent had spent a considerable portion of the money which had been
put away so safely in the bags, and she wished to pay now a part of the dowry in merchandise,
at such prices as she thought reasonable, and to have a year's credit for the remainder. There
was thus thrown upon Lord Sandwich the very heavy responsibility of deciding whether to give
up the object of his expedition, and go back to England without the bride, or to take her without
the money. After very anxious hesitation and suspense, he decided to proceed with his enterprise,
and the preparations were made for the princess's embarkation.

When the day arrived, the queen descended the grand staircase of the palace, and at the foot
of it took leave of her mother. Neither mother nor daughter shed a tear. The princess was conducted
through the streets, accompanied by a long cavalcade and a procession of splendid carriages,
through long lines of soldiers, and under triumphal arches, and over paths strewed with flowers,
while bands of music, and groups of dancers, at various distances along the way, expressed
the general congratulation and joy. When they reached the pier there was a splendid brigantine
or barge ready to receive the bride and her attendants. The Earl of Sandwich, and other English
officers of high rank belonging to the squadron, entered the barge too. The water was covered
with boats, and the shipping in the river was crowded with spectators. The barge moved on to
the ship which was to convey the bridal party, who ascended to the deck by means of a spacious
and beautiful stair constructed upon its side. Salutes were fired by the English ships, and
were echoed by the Portuguese forts on the shore. The princess's brother and the ladies who
had accompanied her on board, to take leave of her there, now bade her farewell, and returned
by the barge to the shore, while the ships weighed anchor and prepared to put to sea.

The wind was, however, contrary, and they were compelled to remain that night in the river;
and as soon as the darkness came on, the whole shore became resplendent with illuminations
at the windows in the city, and with rockets, and fire balls, and fireworks of every kind,
rising from boats upon the water, and from the banks, and heights, and castle battlements all
around upon the land. This gay and splendid spectacle beguiled the night, but the wind continued
unfavorable all the next day, and confined the squadron still to the river. Catharine's mother
sent out a messenger during the day to inquire after her daughter's health and welfare. The
etiquette of royalty did not allow of her coming to see her child.

The fleet, which consisted of fourteen men-of-war, put to sea on the second day. After a long
and stormy passage, the squadron arrived off the Isle of Wight; the Duke of York came out to
meet it there, with five other ships, and they all entered the harbor of Portsmouth together.
As soon as Catharine landed, she wrote immediately to Charles to notify him of her arrival.
The news produced universal excitement in London. The bells were rung, bonfires were made in
the streets, and houses were illuminated. Every body seemed full of joy and pleasure except
the king himself. He seemed to care little about it. He was supping that night with Lady Castlemaine.
It was five days before he set out to meet his bride, and he supped with Lady Castlemaine the
night before he commenced his journey.

Some of Charles's best friends were very much grieved at his pursuing such a course; others
were very indignant; but the majority of the people around him at court were like himself in
character and manners, and were only led to more open irregularity and vice themselves by this
public example of their sovereign. In the mean time, the king moved on to Portsmouth, escorted
by a body of his Life Guards. He found that his intended bride was confined to her bed with
a sort of slow fever. It was the result, they said, of the roughness and discomforts of the
voyage, though we may certainly imagine another cause. Charles went immediately to the house
where she was residing, and was admitted to visit her in her chamber, the many attendants who
were present at the interview watching with great interest every word and look on either side
by which they might judge of the nature of the first impression made by the bride and bridegroom
upon each other. Catharine was not considered beautiful, and it was natural that a degree of
curiosity should be manifested to learn how Charles would regard her.

There are two apparently contradictory accounts of the impression made upon Charles by this
his first sight of his intended bride. Charles wrote a letter to Lord Clarendon, in which he
expressed himself very well satisfied with her. He admitted that she was no beauty, but her
countenance was agreeable, he said, and "her conversation," he added, "as far as I can perceive,
is very good; for she has wit enough, and a very agreeable voice. You would be surprised to
see how well we are acquainted already. In a word, I think myself very happy, and I am confident
that we shall agree very well together. I have not time to say any more. My lord lieutenant
will tell you the rest." At the same time, while writing this in his official communication
to his minister, he said privately to one of his companions on leaving the presence of his
bride, that, "upon his word, they had sent him a bat instead of a woman."

The royal couple were married the next day, first very privately in the Catholic form, and
afterward more openly, in a great hall, and before a large assembly, according to the ritual
of the Church of England. The bride was attired in the English style, her dress being of rose
color, trimmed with knots of blue ribbon. These knots were, after the ceremony, detached from
the dress, and distributed among the company as wedding favors, every lady eagerly pressing
forward to get a share. Magnificent presents were made to the groomsmen and bridesmaids, and
the company dispersed. The queen, still indisposed, went back to her bed and her supper was
served to her there, the king and other members of the household partaking it with her, seated
at the bedside.

A day or two afterward the royal party proceeded to London, in a long train composed of Life
Guards, carriages, horsemen, baggage wagons, and attendants of every grade. The queen's heart
was full of anticipations of happiness. The others, who knew what state of things she was to
find on her arrival there, looked forward to scenes of trouble and woe.

CHAPTER XI.

CHARACTER AND REIGN

Some of the traits of character for which King Charles II. has been most noted among mankind
are well illustrated by his management of the affair of Lady Castlemaine, when the queen arrived
at her new home in Hampton Court. Hampton Court is a very spacious and beautiful palace on
the banks of the Thames, some miles above London, splendidly built, and very pleasantly situated
at a graceful bend of the river. It was magnificently fitted up and furnished for Catharine's
reception. Her suite of apartments were supplied and adorned in the most sumptuous manner.
Her bed, which was a present to Charles, at the time of his restoration, from the States of
Holland, was said to have cost, with all the appurtenances, a sum equal to between thirty and
forty thousand dollars. The hangings were an embroidery of silver on crimson velvet. The other
articles of furniture in the apartment, the mirrors, the richly inlaid cabinets, the toilet
service of massive gold, the canopies, the carved chairs, the curtains, the tapestries, and
the paintings, corresponded in magnificence with the bed, so that Catharine, when she was introduced
to the scene, felt that she had attained to the very summit of human grandeur.

For a few weeks Catharine neither saw nor heard any thing of Lady Castlemaine. She was confined
to her house at the time by the care of an infant, born a few days after the arrival of the
queen. Her husband had the child baptized soon after its birth as his son and heir; but the
mother soon afterward had it baptized again as the son of the king, Charles himself standing
sponsor on the occasion. A violent quarrel followed between Lady Castlemaine and her husband.
She left the house, taking with her all her servants and attendants, and all the plate and
other valuables which she could carry away. The husband, overwhelmed with wretchedness and
shame, abandoned every thing, and went to France, in voluntary exile. His wife then came and
took up her residence at Richmond, which is not far from Hampton Court, so as to be near the
king. In all these proceedings the king himself gave her his continued countenance, encouragement,
and aid.

Although Catharine, in the confiding simplicity of her character, had fully believed, in coming
to London, that Charles would be to her a true and faithful husband, still she had heard the
name of Lady Castlemaine before she left Lisbon. Her mother had once briefly alluded to the
subject, and gave her a warning, charging her to remember the name, and to be on her guard
against the lady herself, and never to tolerate her in her presence on any pretext. Things
were in this state, when, one day, after Catharine had been about six weeks in her new home,
Charles brought in a list of ladies whom he proposed that she should make the ladies of her
household. Catharine took the list, and there, to her surprise and indignation, she saw the
dreaded name of Lady Castlemaine at the head of it.

Very much agitated, she began to prick out the name, and to declare that she could not listen
to any such proposition. Charles was angry, and remonstrated. She persisted, and said that
he must either yield to her in that point, or send her back to Lisbon. Charles was determined
to have his way, and Catharine was overwhelmed with anguish and grief. This lasted two days,
when Charles made his peace with his wife by solemnly promising to give up Lady Castlemaine,
and to have from that time forward nothing more to do with her.

King Charles II. has always been famed for his good nature. This was a specimen of it. He never
liked to quarrel with any body, and was always ready to give up his point, in appearance and
form at least, for the sake of peace and good humor. Accordingly, when he found how immovably
averse his wife was to having Lady Castlemaine for an inmate of her family, instead of declaring
that she must and should submit to his will, he gave up himself, and said that he would think
no more about it, without, however, having the remotest idea of keeping his word. He was only
intending, since he found the resistance so decided on this side of the citadel, to try to
find some other approach.

Accordingly, a short time after this, one evening when the queen was holding a sort of levee
in a brilliant saloon, surrounded by her Portuguese ladies, and receiving English ladies, as
they were one after another presented to her by the king, the company were astonished at seeing
Lady Castlemaine appear with the rest, and, as she advanced, the king presented her to the
queen. To the surprise of every one, Catharine received her as graciously as the rest, and
gave her her hand. The fact was, that Catharine, not being familiar with the sound and pronunciation
of English words, had not understood the name. One of the Portuguese ladies who stood near
her whispered to inquire if she knew that that was Lady Castlemaine. Catharine was stunned
and staggered by the words as by a blow. The blood gushed from her nose, she fell over into
the arms of her attendants in a fainting fit, and was borne out of the room.

There followed, after this scene, a long and dreadful quarrel. Charles accused his wife of
unreasonable and foolish jealousy, and of putting a public insult upon one of the ladies of
his court, whom she was bound to treat with civility and respect, since he chose to have it
so. She, on the other hand, declared that he was cruel and tyrannical in making such demands
upon her, and that she would go back to Portugal rather than submit to such an intolerable
indignity. She criminated Charles, and Charles recriminated and threatened her, and for one
night the palace was filled with the noise and uproar of the quarrel. The ladies and gentlemen
of the household were very glad, they said, that they were not in London, where there would
have been so many more witnesses of the scene.

Some of Charles's counselors and ministers of state were disposed at first to remonstrate with
him for laying commands on his wife, with which, as they expressed it, flesh and blood could
not comply. He, however, peremptorily silenced all their expostulations, and required them,
as they valued his favor, to aid him in effecting his purposes. Good natured as he was, his
determination was fully aroused, and he was now resolved to compel the queen to submit. He
wrote a letter to Lord Clarendon, in which he declared his absolute and unalterable determination
to make Lady Castlemaine "of the queen's bed chamber," and hoped he might be miserable in this
world and in the world to come if he failed in the least degree in what he had undertaken;
and if any one of his friends attempted to thwart or impede him in it in any way, he would
make him repent of it as long as he lived. The king concluded his letter with asking Clarendon
to show it to some others concerned, that they might all understand distinctly what they were
to expect.

Of course, every body, after this, took sides against the queen, and all who had access to
her urged her to comply with the wishes of the king. She begged and prayed to be spared such
an indignity. She remonstrated, sometimes with impetuous passion, and sometimes with silent
grief and bitter tears. She wanted to go back again to Portugal; but this, of course, could
not be. The end of it was, that she was worn out at last. Lady Castlemaine was admitted, and
remained an inmate of her family as long as she retained her place in the king's regard.

Lady Castlemaine was a proud and imperious beauty, who abused the power which she soon found
that she possessed over the king, in a manner to make her an object of hatred to every one
else. She interfered with every thing, and had a vast influence even over the affairs of state.
The king was sometimes out of patience, and attempted resistance, but she soon reduced him
to submission. There was once some question about sending a certain nobleman, who was charged
with some political offenses, to the Tower. She declared that he should not be sent there.
The king rebuked her interference, and they got into a high dispute on the subject, the king
telling her, in the end, that she was an impertinent jade, that meddled with things she had
nothing to do with. To which she replied that he was a great fool, that let fools have the
management of his affairs, and sent his faithful servants to prison. In the end, the lady gained
the victory, and the nobleman went free. Violent quarrels of this kind were very frequent between
these high life lovers, and they always ended in the triumph of Lady Castlemaine. She used
to threaten, as a last resort, that if the king came to an open rupture with her, she would
print the letters that he had written to her, and this always brought him to terms.

These incidents indicate a very extraordinary freedom and familiarity of manners on the part
of Charles, and he probably appears, in all these transactions, to much greater disadvantage
in some respects than he otherwise would have done, on account of the extreme openness and
frankness of his character. He lived, in fact, on the most free and familiar terms with all
around him, jesting continually with every body, and taking jests, with perfect good nature,
from others in return. In fact, his jests, gibes, and frolics kept the whole court continually
in a condition of frivolous gayety and fun, which would have excited the astonishment of all
the serious portion of mankind, if the extreme and universal dissipation and vice which prevailed
had not awakened a far deeper emotion.

In fact, there seemed to be no serious element whatever in the monarch's character. He was,
for instance, very fond of dogs, and cultivated a particular breed, since called King Charles's
spaniels, which he kept at one time in great numbers, and in all stages of age and condition,
in his palace, and in his very bed chamber, making all the apartments around very disagreeable
by the effluvia. Rewards were constantly offered for certain of the king's dogs which had escaped.
They were always escaping. He was attended by these dogs wherever he went, and at his meetings
with his council, while the gravest and most momentous national interests were under discussion,
he would amuse himself by playing with them under the table. He read his speeches at Parliament,
that is, the brief messages with which the sovereign usually opens the session, in a ridiculous
manner, and at church, instead of attending to the service, he would play at peep with Lady
Castlemaine between the curtains which separated his box from that of the ladies of the household.
And yet he pretended to be a firm believer in Christianity; and while he had no objection to
any extreme of vice, he discountenanced infidelity. On one occasion, when a philosophical skeptic
had been enlarging for some time on his objections to the Christian faith, Charles replied
by saying, "My lord, I am a great deal older than your grace, and have heard more arguments
in favor of atheism than you, but I have lived long enough to see that there is nothing in
them, and I hope your grace will."

Charles spent most of his time, at some periods of his reign, in idle amusements, lounging
about his palace, playing at tennis in the tennis court like a boy, and then weighing himself
afterward to see how much he was gaining. In the afternoons and evenings he would loiter in
the rooms of his favorites while they were finishing their dressing, gamble at cards, and often
would get very much intoxicated at wild midnight carousals. He would ramble in the mall and
in the parks, and feed the aquatic birds upon the ponds there, day after day, with all the
interest and pleasure of a truant schoolboy. He roamed about thus in the most free and careless
manner, and accosted people far beneath him in rank in what was considered a undignified way
for a king.

His brother James, the Duke of York, sometimes remonstrated with him on this subject. James
was, of course, so long as the queen, Charles's lawful wife, had no children, the next heir
to the crown. He spent most of his life in the court of his brother, and they were generally
very warm friends to each other. On one of Charles's frolicking excursions, when he was away
far from his palace, without any suitable attendants or guards, James told him that he really
thought his life was not safe in such exposures. Charles replied by telling James not to give
himself any uneasiness. "You may depend upon it," said he, "that nobody will ever think of
killing me to make you king."

The king was not unwilling, too, to take, himself, such jests as he gave. One day, in conversation
with a dissolute member of the court, after they had been joking each other for some time,
he said, "Ah! Shaftesbury, I verily believe you are the wickedest dog in my dominions."

"Yes," replied Shaftesbury, "for a subject, I think I am."

There was a mischievous and unmanageable goat in one of the palace courtyards, whose name was
Old Rowley, and the courtiers considered the beast as affording so just an emblem of the character
of the king, that they gave the king his name. Charles, instead of resenting it, entered into
the jest; and one day, as he was going into the apartment of some of the ladies, be heard them
singing a song, in which he figured ridiculously as the goat. He knocked at the door. They
asked who was there. "Only Old Rowley," said the king.

The king's repartees were some of them really good, and he obtained in his day the reputation
of being quite a wit, while yet all his actions, and the whole of his management of his affairs,
were so utterly unwise and so wholly unworthy of his station, that every one was struck with
the contrast.

Charles had, in fact, very little to do with the public affairs of his kingdom. He liked to
build palaces and ships, and he expended vast sums, not very judiciously, on these plans. Sir
Christopher Wren, the famous architect, planned one of these palaces, and Charles, when he
went to see it, complained that the rooms were too small. Sir Christopher walked about with
a self-important air, looking up at the ceiling, and said that he thought they were high enough.
Sir Christopher was very small in stature. Charles accordingly squatted down as well as he
could, to get his head in as low a position as the architect's, and walked about the room in
that ridiculous attitude, looking up in mimicry of Sir Christopher's manner, and then said,
"Oh, yes, now I think they are high enough."

These building plans, and other similar undertakings, together with the vast amounts which
the king lavished upon his numerous female favorites, exhausted his resources, and kept him
in continual straits for money. He was always urging Parliament to make new grants, and to
lay more taxes, until, as he said himself, he was ashamed to look his Parliament in the face,
he was so continually begging them for supplies. The people caricatured him by the representation
of a poverty stricken man, with his pockets turned inside out, and begging money. At another
time the caricature took the form of a man led along against his will by two women, and threatened
by a third, wearing all the time a countenance expressive of helplessness and distress.

The king bore all these things with the utmost good nature, satisfied, apparently, if he could
only enjoy the pleasures of dissipation and vice, and continue, in his palaces, a perpetual
round of reckless merriment and fun. Some of the stories which are gravely told by the historians
of the day are scarcely credible. For instance, it is said that a thief one day found his way,
in the guise of a gentleman, into one of the royal drawing rooms, and contrived to get a gold
snuff box out of the pocket of one of the noblemen there. Just as he had successfully accomplished
his object, unobserved, as he supposed, he looked up, and saw the king's eyes fastened upon
him. Knowing his majesty's character, the thief had the presence of mind to give him a wink,
with a sly gesture enjoining secrecy. The king nodded assent, and the thief went away with
his prize. When the nobleman missed his snuff box, the king amused himself some time with his
perplexity and surprise, and then told him that it was of no use for him to search for his
snuff box, for a thief had gone off with it half an hour ago. "I saw him," said the king, with
a countenance full of fun, "but I could not do any thing. The rascal made me his confidant,
and, of course, you know, I could not betray him."

Under the government of such a sovereign, it could not be expected that the public affairs
of the realm would have gone on very prosperously. Still, however, they might have been conducted
with ordinary success by his ministers, and perhaps they were, in fact, managed as well as
was usual with the governments of Europe in those days. It happened, however, that three great
public calamities occurred, all of a most marked and signal character, which were, perhaps,
not owing at all to causes for which Charles was responsible, but which have nevertheless connected
such associations in men's minds with this unfortunate reign, as that Englishmen have since
looked back upon it with very little pleasure. These three calamities were the plague, the
fire, and the Dutch invasion.

There have been a great many seasons of plague in London, all inconceivably dreadful; but as
King Charles's fire was first among conflagrations, so his plague was the greatest pestilence
that ever ravaged the city. London was, in those days, in a condition which exactly adapted
it to be the easy prey of pestilence, famine, and fire. The people were crowded together in
vast masses, with no comforts, no cleanliness, no proper organization. The enormous vegetable
and animal accumulations of such a multitude, living more like brutes than men, produced a
continual miasma, which prepared the constitutions of thousands for any infection which might
chance to light among them. Pestilence is, in fact, the rude and dreadful remedy which nature
provides for the human misery which man himself can not or will not cure. When the dictates
of reason and conscience are neglected or disobeyed, and the ills which they might have averted
sink the social state into a condition of degradation and wretchedness so great that the denser
accumulations of the people become vast and corrupted swarms of vermin instead of organized
communities of men, then plague and fever come in as the last resort--half remedy, half retribution--devised
by that mysterious principle which struggles perpetually for the preservation of the human
race, to thin off the excessive accumulation by destroying a portion of the surplus in so frightful
a way as to drive away the rest in terror.

The great plague of London took place in 1665, one year before the fire. The awful scenes which
the whole city presented, no pen can describe. A hundred thousand persons are said to have
died. The houses where cases of the plague existed were marked with a red cross and shut up,
the inmates being all fastened in, to live or die, at the mercy of the infection. Every day
carts rolled through the otherwise silent and desolate streets, men accompanying them to gather
up with pitchforks the dead bodies which had been dragged out from the dwellings, and crying
"Bring out your dead" as they went along. [Footnote: Sometimes the living were pitched into
the cart by mistake instead of the dead. There is a piece of sculpture in the Tottenham Court
road in London intended to commemorate the following case. A Scotch piper, who had been wandering
in homeless misery about the streets, with nothing but his bagpipes and his dog, got intoxicated
at last, as such men always do, if they can, in times of such extreme and awful danger, and
laid down upon the steps of a public building and went to sleep. The cart came along in the
night, by torchlight, and one of the men who attended it, inserting the point of his fork under
the poor vagabond's belt, tossed him into the cart, bagpipes and all. The dog did all he could
to defend his master, but in vain. The cart went thundering on, the men walking along by its
side, examining the ways for new additions to their load. The piper, half awakened by the shock
of his precipitation into the cart, and aroused still more by the joltings of the road, sat
up, attempted in vain to rally his bewildered faculties, looked about him, wondering where
he was, and then instinctively began to play. The men, astonished and terrified at such sounds
from a cart loaded with the dead, fled in all directions, leaving the cart in the middle of
the street alone.

What a mysterious and inconsistent principle is fear. Here are men braving, unconcerned and
at their ease, the most absolutely appalling of all possible human dangers, and yet terrified
out of their senses at an unexpected sound.]Thousands went mad with their uncontrollable terror,
and roamed about the streets in raving delirium, killing themselves, and mothers killing their
children, in an insane and frenzied idea of escaping by that means, somehow or other, from
the dreadful destroyer.

Every body whose reason remained to them avoided all possible contact or communication with
others. Even in the country, in the exchange of commodities, a thousand contrivances were resorted
to, to avoid all personal connection. In one place there was a stone, where those who had any
thing to sell placed their goods and then retreated, while he who wished to buy came up, and,
depositing his money on the stone in the place of the merchandise, took what he had thus bought
away.

The great fire took place in 1666, about a year after the plague, and burned a very large part
of London. It commenced accidentally in a baker's shop, where a great store of fagots had been
collected, and spread so rapidly among the buildings which surrounded the spot that it was
soon entirely beyond control. The city of London was then composed of an immense mass of mean
buildings, crowded densely together, with very narrow streets intervening, and the wind carried
the flames, with inconceivable rapidity, far and wide. The people seemed struck universally
with a sense of terror and despair, and nothing was to be heard but shrieks, outcries, and
wild lamentations. The sky was one vast lurid canopy, like molten brass, day and night, for
four days, while the whole city presented a scene of indescribable and awful din; the cracking
and thundering of the flames, the frenzied screams of the women and children, the terrific
falling of spires, towers, walls, and lofty battlements, the frightful explosions of the houses,
blown up by gunpowder in the vain hope of stopping the progress of the flames, all formed a
scene of grandeur so terrific and dreadful, that they who witnessed the spectacle were haunted
by the recollection of it long afterward, as by a frightful dream. A tall monument was built
upon the spot where the baker's shop stood, to commemorate the calamity. The fire held, in
fact, in the estimation of mankind, the rank of the greatest and most terrible of all conflagrations,
until the burning of Moscow, in the time of Napoleon, in some degree eclipsed its fame.

The Dutch invasion was the third great calamity which signalized King Charles's unfortunate
reign. The ships of the enemy came up the Thames and the Medway, which is a branch of the Thames;
they took possession of a fort at Sheerness, near the mouth of the river, and, after seizing
all the military stores, which had been collected there to an enormous amount, they set fire
to the powder magazine, and blew up the whole fortress with a terrific explosion. The way was
now open to them to London, unless the English could contrive some way to arrest their progress.
They attempted to do this by sinking some ships in the river, and drawing a strong chain across
from one sunken vessel to the other, and fastening the ends to the shores. The Dutch, however,
broke through this obstruction. They seized an opportunity when the tide was setting strongly
up the river, and a fresh wind was blowing; their ships, impelled thus by a double force, broke
through the chains, passed safely between the sunken ships, and came on in triumph up the river,
throwing the city of London into universal consternation. There were several English ships
of war, and several Dutch ships, which had been captured and brought up the Thames as prizes,
lying in the river; these vessels were all seized by the Dutch, and burned; one of the English
ships which they thus destroyed was called the Royal Oak.

Of course, there was now a universal scene of confusion and terror in London. Every body laid
the blame of the calamity upon the king; the money which he had received for building ships,
and other national defenses, he had squandered, they said, upon his guilty pleasures; then
the war, which had resulted in this invasion, was caused by the political mismanagement of
his reign. While the people, however, thus loudly condemned the conduct of their monarch, they
went energetically at work to arrest the progress of their invaders; they sunk other ships
in greater numbers, and built platforms, on which they raised batteries of cannon. At length
the further progress of the enemy was stopped, and the ships were finally compelled to retire.

Among the other events which occurred during the reign of King Charles the Second, and which
tended to connect unfavorable associations with the recollection of it in the minds of men,
was a very extraordinary affair, which is known in history by the name of Titus Oates's Popish
Plot. It was the story of a plot, said to have been formed by the Catholics, to put King Charles
to death, and place his brother James, who, it will be recollected, was a Catholic, upon the
throne in his stead. The story of this plot was told by a man named Titus Oates, and as it
was at first generally believed, it occasioned infinite trouble and difficulty. In after times,
however, the whole story came to be regarded as the fabrication of Oates, without there being
any foundation for it whatever; hence the name of Titus Oates's Popish Plot, by which the affair
has always since been designated in history. The circumstances were these:

Among his other various accomplishments, King Charles was quite a chemist and philosopher.
He had a laboratory where he amused himself with experiments, having, of course, several persons
associated with him, and attendant upon him in these researches. Among these was a man named
Kirby. Mr. Kirby was an intelligent man, of agreeable manners, and of considerable scientific
attainments. Charles devoted, at some periods of his life, a considerable portion of his time
to these researches in experimental philosophy, and he took, likewise, an interest in facilitating
the progress of others in the same pursuits. There was a small society of philosophers that
was accustomed to meet sometimes in Oxford and sometimes in London. The object of this society
was to provide apparatus and other facilities for making experiments, and to communicate to
each other at their meetings the result of their investigations. The king took this society
under his patronage, and made it, as it were, his own. He gave it the name of THE ROYAL SOCIETY,
and granted it a charter, by which it was incorporated as a permanent organization, with the
most ample powers. This association has since become one of the most celebrated learned societies
in the world, and its establishment is one of the very few transactions of King Charles's reign
which have been since remembered with pleasure.

But to return to Mr. Kirby. One day, when the king was walking in the park with a party of
companions and attendants, who were separated more or less from him, as was usual on such occasions,
Mr. Kirby came up to him, and, with a mysterious and earnest air, begged the king not to allow
himself to be separated from the company, for his life, he said, was in danger. "Keep with
your company, sir," said he, "your enemies have a design upon your life. You may be suddenly
shot on this very walk." Charles was not easily frightened, and he received this announcement
with great composure. He asked an explanation, however, and Mr. Kirby informed him that a plot
had been formed by the Catholics to destroy him; that two men had been engaged to shoot him;
and, to make the result doubly sure, another arrangement had been made to poison him. The queen's
physician was the person, he said, who was charged with this latter design. Mr. Kirby said,
moreover, that there was a clergyman, Dr. Tong, who was fully acquainted with all the particulars
of the plot, and that, if the king would grant him an interview that evening, he would make
them all known.

The king agreed to this, and in the evening Dr. Tong was introduced. He had a budget of papers
which he began to open and read, but Charles had not patience to hear them; his mind was full
of a plan which he was contemplating of going to Windsor the next day, to look at some new
decorations which he had ordered for several of the apartments of the palace. He did not believe
in the existence of any plot. It is true that plots and conspiracies were very common in those
days, but false rumors and unfounded tales of plots were more common still. There was so much
excitement in the minds of the community on the subject of the Catholic and Protestant faith,
and such vastly extended interests depended on whether the sovereign belonged to one side or
the other on this question, that every thing relating to the subject was invested with a mysterious
awe, and the most wonderful stories were readily circulated and believed. The public mind was
always particularly sensitive and excitable in such a case as that of Charles and his brother
James at the time of which we are writing, where the reigning monarch, Charles, was of one
religious faith, and his brother James, the next heir, was of the other. The death of Charles,
which might at any time take place, would naturally lead to a religious revolution, and this
kept the whole community in an exceedingly excitable and feverish state. There was a great
temptation to form plots on the one hand, and a great eagerness to discover them on the other;
and any man who could tell a story of treasonable schemes, whether his tale was true or fabricated,
became immediately a personage of great importance.

Charles was well aware of these things, and was accordingly disposed to pay very little attention
to Dr. Tong's papers. He said he had no time to look into them, and so he referred the whole
case to the Lord Treasurer Danby, an officer of his court, whom he requested to examine into
the affair. Dr. Tong, therefore, laid his papers before Danby, while the king went off the
next day to Windsor to examine the new fresco paintings and the other decorations of the palace.

Danby was disposed to regard the story in a very different light from that in which it had
appeared to the king. It is said that there were some charges about to be brought forward against
himself for certain malpractices in his office, and that he was very much pleased, accordingly,
at the prospect of having something come up to attract public attention, and turn it away from
his own misdemeanors. He listened, therefore, with great interest to Dr. Tong's account of
the plot, and made many minute and careful inquiries. Dr. Tong informed him that he had himself
no personal knowledge of the conspiracy; that the papers, which contained all the information
that he was possessed of, had been thrown into the hall of his house from the front door, and
that he did not certainly know by whom, though he suspected, he said, one Titus Oates, who
had formerly been a Catholic priest, and was still so far connected with the Catholics as to
have very favorable opportunities to become acquainted with their designs.

Soon after this Dr. Tong had another interview with the lord treasurer, and informed him that
his surmise had proved true; that it was Titus Oates who had drawn up the papers, and that
he was informed in regard to all the particulars of the plot, but that he did not dare to do
any thing openly in revealing them, for fear that the conspirators would kill him. The lord
treasurer communicated the result of his inquiries to the king, and urged the affair upon his
attention as one of the utmost possible importance. The king himself, however, was very skeptical
on the subject. He laughed at the lord treasurer's earnestness and anxiety. The lord treasurer
wished to have a meeting of the council called, that the case might be laid before them, but
Charles refused. Nobody should know any thing about it, he said, not even his brother. It would
only create excitement and alarm, and perhaps put it into somebody's head to murder him, though
nobody at present had any such design.

But, notwithstanding the king's determination not to give publicity to the story of the plot,
rumors of it gradually transpired, and began to excite attention. The fact that such stories
were in circulation soon came to the knowledge of the Duke of York, and, of course, immediately
arrested his earnest attention. As he was himself a Catholic, and the heir to the crown, any
suspicion of a Catholic plot formed to dethrone his brother necessarily implicated him. He
demanded an examination into the case. In a short time, vague but exaggerated rumors on the
subject began to circulate through the community at large, which awakened, of course, a very
general anxiety and alarm. So great was the virulence of both political and religious animosities
in those days, that no one knew to what scenes of persecution or of massacre such secret conspiracies
might tend Oates, whose only object was to bring himself into notice, and to obtain rewards
for making known the plot which he had pretended to discover, now found, to his great satisfaction,
that the fire which he had kindled was beginning to burn. The meeting of the council was called,
and he was summoned to attend it. Before the time arrived, however, he went to a justice of
the peace, and laid the evidence before him of the existence of the conspiracy, and of all
the details respecting it which he pretended to have discovered. The name of this justice was
Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey. A remarkable circumstance afterward occurred in respect to him, as
will presently be related, which greatly increased and extended the popular excitement in relation
to the pretended plot.

The plot, as Oates invented and detailed it, was on the most magnificent scale imaginable.
The pope himself was at the head of it. The pope, he said, had laid the subject before a society
of learned theologians at Rome, and they had decided that in such a case as that of England,
where the sovereign and a majority of the people had renounced the true religion, and given
themselves up to avowed and open heresy, the monarch lost all title to his crown, and the realms
thus fallen from the faith lapsed to the pope, and were to be reclaimed by him by any mode
which it seemed to him expedient to adopt. Under these circumstances, the pope had assumed
the sovereignty over England, and had commissioned the society of the Jesuits--a very powerful
religious society, extending over most of the countries of Europe--to take possession of the
realm; that, in the prosecution of this plan, the king was to be assassinated, and that a very
large sum of money had been raised and set apart, to be paid to any person who would kill the
king; that an offer of ten thousand pounds had been made to the queen's physician if he would
poison him. The physician had insisted upon fifteen thousand for so great a service, and this
demand had finally been acceded to; and five thousand had actually been paid him in advance.
Besides the murder of the king, a general assassination of the Protestants was to take place.
There were twenty thousand Catholics in London, for instance, who, according to Oates's account
of the plan, were to rise on a preconcerted night, and each one was to kill five Protestants,
which it was thought they could easily do, as the Protestants would be taken wholly by surprise,
and would be unarmed. The revolution being thus effected, the crown was to be offered to Charles's
brother, the Duke of York, as a gift from the pope, and, if he should refuse to accept it on
such conditions as the pope might see fit to impose, he was himself to be immediately assassinated,
and some other disposal to be made of the kingdom.

Oates was examined before the council very closely, and he contradicted himself so much, and
made so many misstatements about absent persons, and the places where he pretended that certain
transactions had taken place, as to prove the falseness of his whole story. The public, however,
knew little or thought little of these proofs. They hated the Catholics, and were eager to
believe and to circulate any thing which tended to excite the public mind against them. The
most extravagant stories were accordingly circulated, and most excessive and universal fears
prevailed, increasing continually by the influence of mutual action and reaction, and of sympathy,
until the whole country was in a state of terror. A circumstance now occurred which added tenfold
to the excitement, and produced, in fact, a general consternation.

This circumstance was the sudden and mysterious death of Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey, the justice
who had taken the depositions of Oates in respect to the conspiracy. He had been missing for
several days, and at length his body was found in a trench, by the side of a field, in a solitary
place not far from London. His own sword had been run into his body, and was remaining in the
wound. His watch and his money were safe in his pocket, showing that he had not been killed
by robbers. This event added greatly to the excitement that prevailed. The story was circulated
that he had been killed by the Catholics for having aided in publishing the discovery of their
plot. They who wished to believe Oates's story found in the justice's death most ample confirmation
of it. The body was brought forward and exhibited to the public gaze in a grand procession,
which moved through the streets of London; and at the funeral guards were stationed, one on
each side of the preacher, while he was delivering the funeral discourse, to impress the people
with a sense of the desperate recklessness of Catholic hate, by the implication that even a
minister of the Gospel, in the exercise of the most solemn of his functions, was not safe without
an effectual guard.

From this time the excitement and commotion went on increasing at a very rapid rate. Oates
himself, of course, became immediately a man of great importance; and to maintain himself in
his new position, he invented continually new stories, each more terrible than the preceding.
New informers, too, began to appear, confirming Oates's statements, and adding new details
of their own, that they might share his distinctions and rewards. These men became continually
more and more bold, in proportion to the increasing readiness of the people to receive their
inventions for truths. They accused persons of higher and higher rank, until at last they dared
to implicate the queen herself in their charges. They knew that, as she was a Catholic, she
was unpopular with the nation at large, and as Charles had so many other lady favorites, they
concluded that he would feel no interest in vindicating her from false aspersions. They accordingly
brought forward accusations against the queen of having joined in the conspiracy, of having
been privy to the plan of murdering the king, and of having actually arranged and directed
the assassination of the justice, Sir Edmondsbury. These charges produced, of course, great
excitement. The people of the country were generally predisposed to believe them true. There
were various investigations of them, and long protracted examinations of the witnesses before
the council and before judicial commissions appointed to inquire into and decide upon the case.
These inquisitions led to debates and disputes, to criminations and recriminations without
number, and they threw the whole court and the whole nation into a state of extreme excitement,
some taking sides against, and some in favor of the queen. Although the popular sentiment was
against her, every fair and candid mind, that attended carefully to the evidence, decided unhesitatingly
in her favor. The stories of the witnesses were utterly inconsistent with each other, and in
many of their details impossible. Still, so great was the public credulity, and so eager the
desire to believe every thing, however absurd, which would arouse and strengthen the anti-Catholic
feeling, that the queen found herself soon the object of extreme and universal odium.

The king, however, much to his credit, refused all belief of these accusations against Catharine,
and strongly defended her cause. He took care to have the witnesses cross examined, and to
have the inconsistencies in their testimony, and the utter impossibility that their statements
could be true, pointed out. He believed, he said, that she was entirely innocent, and that
the whole plan was a conspiracy to effect her destruction. "They think, I suppose," said the
king, "that I should like a new wife, but I will not suffer an innocent woman to be wronged."
He also told one of the ministers of state, in speaking of the subject, that, considering how
hardly he had treated his wife, and how much reason she had for just complaints against him,
it would be an atrocious thing for him to abandon her in such an extremity.

A volume might be filled with stories of the strange and exciting incidents that grew out of
this pretended popish plot. Its consequences extended disastrously through many years, and
involved a vast number of innocent persons in irretrievable ruin. The true character of Oates
and his accomplices was, however, at length fully proved, and they themselves suffered the
fate at last which they had brought upon others. The whole affair was a disgrace to the age.
There is no circumstance connected with it which can be looked upon with any pleasure except
King Charles's fidelity to his injured wife in refusing to abandon her, though he no longer
loved her. His defense of her innocence, involving, as it did, a continuance of the matrimonial
tie, which bound them together when all the world supposed that he wished it sundered, seems
to have resulted from a conscientious sense of duty, and implies certain latent traits of generosity
and nobleness in Charles's character, which, though ordinarily overpowered and nullified by
the influences of folly and vice, still always seem to have maintained their hold, and to come
out to view from time to time, in the course of the gay monarch's life, whenever any emergency
occurred sufficient to call them into action.

The reign of King Charles the Second was signalized by many other untoward and disastrous events
besides those which we have enumerated. There were unfortunate wars, great defeats in naval
battles, unlucky negotiations abroad, and plots and conspiracies, dangerous and disgraceful,
at home. The king, however, took all these things very good naturedly, and allowed them to
interfere very little with his own personal pleasures. Whatever troubles or embarrassments
affected the state, he left the anxiety and care which pertained to them to his ministers and
his council, banishing all solicitude from his own mind, and enjoying himself all the time
with his experiments, his ladies, his dogs, and his perpetual fun.

CHAPTER XII.

THE CONCLUSION.

Time rolled on, and the gay and pleasure-loving king passed through one decade after another
of his career, until at length he came to be over fifty years of age. His health was firm,
and his mental powers vigorous. He looked forward to many years of strength and activity yet
to come, and thus, though he had passed the meridian of his life, he made no preparations to
change the pursuits and habits in which he had indulged himself in his early years.

He died suddenly at last, at the age of fifty-four. His death was almost as sudden as that
of his father, though in a widely different way. The circumstances of his last sickness have
strongly attracted the attention of mankind, on account of the manner in which the dying king
was affected, at last, by remorse at the recollection of his life of reckless pleasure and
sin, and of the acts to which this remorse led him upon his dying bed. The vices and crimes
of monarchs, like those of other men, may be distinguished into two great types, characterized
by the feelings of heart in which they take their origin. Some of these crimes arise from the
malignant passions of the soul, others from the irregular and perverted action of the feelings
of kindness and affection. The errors and follies of Charles, ending at last, as they did,
in the most atrocious sins, were of the latter class. It was in feelings of kindness and good
will toward friends of his own sex that originated that spirit of favoritism, so unworthy of
a monarch, which he so often evinced; and even his irregular and unhallowed attachments of
another kind seem to have been not wholly selfish and sensual. The course of conduct which
he pursued through the whole course of his life toward his female companions, evinced, in many
instances, a sincere attachment to them, and an honest desire to promote their welfare; and
in all the wild recklessness of his life of pleasure and vice, there was seen coming out continually
into view the influence of some conscientious sense of duty, and of a desire to promote the
happiness of those around him, and to do justice to all. These principle were, indeed, too
feeble to withstand the temptations by which they were assailed on every side; still, they
did not cease to exist, and occasions were continually occurring when they succeeded in making
their persuasions heard. In a word, King Charles's errors and sins, atrocious and inexcusable
as they were, sprang from ill-regulated and perverted feelings of love and good will, and not
from selfishness and hate; from the kindly, and not from the malignant propensities of the
soul. It is very doubtful whether this is really any palliation of them, but, at any rate,
mankind generally regard it so, judging very leniently, as they always do, the sins and crimes
which have such an origin.

It is probable that Charles derived whatever moral principle and sensitiveness of conscience
that he possessed from the influence of his mother in his early years. She was a faithful and
devoted Catholic; she honestly and firmly believed that the rites and usages of the Catholic
Church were divinely ordained, and that a careful and honest conformity to them was the only
way to please God and to prepare for heaven. She did all in her power to bring up her children
in this faith, and in the high moral and religious principles of conduct which were, in her
mind, indissolubly connected with it. She derived this spirit, in her turn, from her mother,
Mary de Medici, who was one of the most extraordinary characters of ancient or modern times.
When Henrietta Maria was married to Charles I. and went to England, this Mary de Medici, her
mother, wrote her a letter of counsel and of farewell, which we recommend to our readers' careful
perusal. It is true, we go back to the third generation from the hero of this story to reach
the document, but it illustrates so well the manner in which maternal influence passes down
from age to age, and throws so much light on the strange scenes which occurred at Charles's
death, and is, moreover, so intrinsically excellent, that it well merits the digression. 

By Mary Russell Mitford

One of the most beautiful spots in the north of Hampshire--a part of the country which, from its
winding green lanes, with the trees meeting over head-like a cradle, its winding roads between
coppices, with wide turfy margents on either side, as if left on purpose for the picturesque and
frequent gipsy camp, its abundance of hedgerow timber, and its extensive tracts of woodland,
seems as if the fields were just dug out of the forest, as might have happened in the days
of William Rufus--one of the loveliest scenes in this lovely county is the Great Pond at Ashley
End.

Ashley End is itself a romantic and beautiful village, struggling down a steep hill to a clear
and narrow running stream, which crosses the road in the bottom, crossed in its turn by a picturesque
wooden bridge, and then winding with equal abruptness up the opposite
acclivity, so that the scattered cottages, separated from each other
by long strips of garden ground, the little country inn, and two or
three old-fashioned tenements of somewhat higher pretensions, surrounded
by their own moss-grown orchards, seemed to be completely shut out
from this bustling world, buried in the sloping meadows so deeply
green, and the hanging woods so rich in their various tinting, along
which the slender wreaths of smoke from the old clustered chimneys
went smiling peacefully in the pleasant autumn air.

So profound was the tranquillity, that the slender streamlet which gushed along the valley,
following its natural windings, and glittering in the noonday sun like a thread of silver,
seemed to the unfrequent visiters of that remote hamlet the only trace of life and motion in
the picture.

The source of this pretty brook was undoubtedly the Great Pond, although
there was no other road to it than by climbing the steep hill beyond
the village, and then turning suddenly to the right, and descending
by a deep cart-track, which led between wild banks covered with heath
and feathery broom, garlanded with bramble and briar roses, and gay
with the purple heath-flower and the delicate harebell,* to a scene
even more beautiful and more solitary than the hamlet itself.

* One of the pleasantest moments that I have ever known, was that of the introduction of an
accomplished young American to the common harebell, upon the very spot which I have attempted to
describe.


Receive, my child, these instructions of my lips; begin and finish every day in your oratory,
[Footnote: An oratory is a little closet furnished appropriately for prayer and other exercises
of devotion.] with good thoughts and, in your prayers, ask resolution to conduct your life
according to the laws of God, and not according to the vanities of this world, which is for
all of us but a moment, in which we are suspended over eternity, which we shall pass either
in the paradise of God, or in hell with the malign spirits who work evil.

Remember that you are daughter of the Church by baptism, and that this is, indeed, the first
and highest rank which you have or ever will have, since it is this which will give you entrance
into heaven; your other dignities, coming as they do from the earth, will not go further than
the earth; but those which you derive from heaven will ascend again to their source, and carry
you with them there. Render thanks to heaven each day, to God who has made you a Christian;
estimate this first of benefits as it deserves, and consider all that you owe to the labors
and precious blood of Jesus our Savior; it ought to be paid for by our sufferings, and even
by our blood, if he requires it. Offer your soul and your life to him who has created you by
his puissance, and redeemed you by his goodness and mercy. Pray to him, and pray incessantly
to preserve you by the inestimable gift of his grace, and that it may please him that you sooner
lose your life than renounce him. You are the descendant of St. Louis. I would recall to you,
in this my last adieu, the same instruction that he received from his mother, Queen Blanche,
who said to him often 'that she would rather see him die than to live so as to offend God,
in whom we move, and who is the end of our being'. It was with such precepts that he commenced
his holy career; it was this that rendered him worthy of employing his life and reign for the
good of the faith and the exaltation of the Church. Be, after his example, firm and zealous
for religion, which you have been taught, for the defense of which he, your royal and holy
ancestor, exposed his life, and died faithful to him among the infidels. Never listen to, or
suffer to be said in your presence, aught in contradiction to your belief in God and his only
Son, your Lord and Redeemer. I entreat the Holy Virgin, whose name you bear, to deign to be
the mother of your soul, and in honor of her who is mother of our Lord and Savior, I bid you
adieu again and many times.

I now devote you to God forever and ever; it is what I desire for you from the very depth of
my heart.

Your very good and affectionate mother, MARIA.

From Amiens, the 10th of June, 1625.

The devout sense of responsibility to Almighty God, and the spirit of submission and obedience
to his will, which this letter breathes, descended from the grandmother to the mother, and
were even instilled, in some degree, into the heart of the son. They remained, however, latent
and dormant through the long years of the monarch's life of frivolity and sin, but they revived
and reasserted their dominion when the end came.

The dying scene opened upon the king's vision in a very abrupt and sudden manner. He had been
somewhat unwell during a certain day in February, when he was about fifty-four years of age.
His illness, however, did not interrupt the ordinary orgies and carousals of his palace. It
was Sunday. In the evening a very gay assembly was convened in the apartments, engaged in deep
gaming, and other dissolute and vicious pleasures. The king mingled in these scenes, though
he complained of being unwell. His head was giddy--his appetite was gone--his walk was unsteady.
When the party broke up at midnight, he went into one of the neighboring apartments, and they
prepared for him some light and simple food suitable for a sick man, but he could not take
it. He retired to his bed, but he passed a restless and uneasy night. He arose, however, the
next morning, and attempted to dress himself, but before he finished the work he was suddenly
struck by that grim and terrible messenger and coadjutor of death--apoplexy--as by a blow.
Stunned by the stroke, he staggered and fell.

The dreadful paroxysm of insensibility and seeming death in a case of apoplexy is supposed
to be occasioned by a pressure of blood upon the brain, and the remedy, according to the practice
of those days, was to bleed the patient immediately to relieve this pressure, and to blister
or cauterize the head, to excite a high external action as a means of subduing the disease
within. It was the law of England that such violent remedies could not be resorted to in the
case of the sovereign without authority previously obtained from the council. They were guilty
of high treason who should presume to do so. This was a case, however, which admitted of no
delay. The attendants put their own lives at hazard to serve that of the king. They bled him
with a penknife, and heated the iron for the cautery. The alarm was spread throughout the palace,
producing universal confusion. The queen was summoned, and came as soon as possible to the
scene. She found her husband sitting senseless in a chair, a basin of blood by his side, his
countenance death-like and ghastly, while some of the attendants were attempting to force the
locked jaws apart, that they might administer a potion, and others were applying a red hot
iron to the patient's head, in a desperate endeavor to arouse and bring back again into action
the benumbed and stupefied sensibilities. Queen Catharine was so shocked by the horrid spectacle
that she sank down in a fit of fainting and convulsions, and was borne immediately away back
to her own apartment.

In two hours the patient's suspended faculties began to return. He looked wildly about him,
and asked for the queen. They sent for her. She was not able to come. She was, however, so
far restored as to be able to send a message and an apology, saying that she was very glad
to hear that he was better, and was much concerned that she could not come to see him; she
also added, that for whatever she had done in the course of her life to displease him, she
now asked his pardon, and hoped he would forgive her. The attendants communicated this message
to the king. "Poor lady!" said Charles, "she beg my pardon! I am sure I beg hers, with all
my heart."

Apoplexy fulfills the dread behest of its terrible master Death by dealing its blow once with
a fatal energy, and then retiring from the field, leaving the stunned and senseless patient
to recover in some degree from the first effect of the stroke, but only to sink down and die
at last under the permanent and irretrievable injuries which almost invariably follow.

Things took this course in the case of Charles. He revived from the stupor and insensibility
of the first attack, and lay afterward for several days upon his bed, wandering in mind, helpless
in body, full of restlessness and pain, and yet conscious of his condition. He saw, dimly and
obscurely indeed, but yet with awful certainty, that his ties to earth had been suddenly sundered,
and that there only remained to him now a brief and troubled interval of mental bewilderment
and bodily distress, to last for a few more hours or days, and then he must appear before that
dread tribunal where his last account was to be rendered; and the vast work of preparation
for the solemn judgment was yet to be made. How was this to be done?

Of course, the great palace of Whitehall, where the royal patient was lying, was all in confusion.
Attendants were hurrying to and fro. Councils of physicians were deliberating in solemn assemblies
on the case, and ordaining prescriptions with the formality which royal etiquette required.
The courtiers were thunderstruck and confounded at the prospect of the total revolution which
was about to ensue, and in which all their hopes and prospects might be totally ruined. James,
the Duke of York, seeing himself about to be suddenly summoned to the throne, was full of eager
interest in the preliminary arrangements to secure his safe and ready accession. He was engaged
night and day in selecting officers, signing documents, and stationing guards. Catharine mourned
in her own sick chamber the approaching blow, which was to separate her forever from her husband,
deprive her of her consequence and her rank, and consign her, for the rest of her days to the
pains and sorrows, and the dreadful solitude of heart which pertains to widowhood. The king's
other female intimates, too, of whom there were three still remaining in his court and in his
palace, were distracted with real grief. They may have loved him sincerely; they certainly
gave every indication of true affection for him in this his hour of extremity. They could not
appear at his bedside except at sudden and stolen interviews, which were quickly terminated
by their being required to withdraw; but they hovered near with anxious inquiries, or else
mourned in their apartments with bitter grief. Without the palace the effects were scarcely
less decisive. The tidings spread every where throughout the kingdom, arresting universal attention,
and awakening an anxiety so widely diffused and so intense as almost to amount to a terror.
A Catholic monarch was about to ascend the throne, and no one knew what national calamities
were impending.

In the mean time, the dying monarch lay helpless upon his bed, in the alcove of his apartment,
distressed and wretched. To look back upon the past filled him with remorse, and the dread
futurity, now close at hand, was full of images of terror and dismay. He thought of his wife,
and of the now utterly irreparable injuries which he had done her. He thought of his other
intimates and their numerous children, and of the condition in which they would be left by
his death. If he had been more entirely sensual and selfish in his attachments, he would have
suffered less; but he could not dismiss these now wretched participators in his sins from his
mind. He could do very little now to promote their future welfare, or to atone for the injury
which he had done them; but his anxiety to do so, as well as his utter helplessness in accomplishing
his desire, was evinced by his saying, in his last charge to his brother James, just before
he died, that he hoped he would be kind to his children, and especially not let poor Nelly
starve. [Footnote: Eleanor Gwyn. She was an actress when Charles first became acquainted with her.]

Troubled and distressed with these thoughts, and still more anxious and wretched at the prospect
of his own approaching summons before the bar of God, the fallen monarch lay upon his dying
bed, earnestly desiring, but not daring to ask for, the only possible relief which was now
left to him, the privilege of seeking refuge in the religious hopes and consolations which
his mother, in years now long gone by, had vainly attempted to teach him to love. The way of
salvation through the ministrations and observances of the Catholic service was the only way
of salvation that he could possibly see. It is true that he had been all his life a Protestant,
but Protestantism was to him only a political faith, it had nothing to do with moral accountability
or preparation for heaven. The spiritual views of acceptance with God by simple personal penitence
and faith in the atoning sacrifice of his Son, which lie at the foundation of the system of
the Church of England, he never conceived of. The Church of England was to him a mere empty
form; it was the service of the ancient Catholic faith, disrobed of its sanctions, despoiled
of its authority, and deprived of all its spirit and soul. It was the mere idle form of godless
and heartless men of the world, empty and vain. It had answered his purpose as a part of the
pageantry of state during his life of pomp and pleasure, but it seemed a mockery to him now,
as a means of leading his wretched and ruined soul to a reconciliation with his Maker. Every
thing that was sincere, and earnest, and truly devout, in the duties of piety were associated
in his mind with the memory of his mother; and as death drew nigh, he longed to return to her
fold, and to have a priest, who was clothed with the authority to which her spirit had been
accustomed to bow, come and be the mediator between himself and his Maker, and secure and confirm
the reconciliation.

But how could this be done? It was worse than treason to aid or abet the tainting of the soul
of an English Protestant king with the abominations of popery. The king knew this very well,
and was aware that if he were to make his wishes known, whoever should assist him in attaining
the object of his desire would hazard his life by the act. Knowing, too, in what abhorrence
the Catholic faith was held, he naturally shrank from avowing his convictions; and thus deterred
by the difficulties which surrounded him, he gave himself up to despair, and let the hours
move silently on which were drawing him so rapidly toward the grave. There were, among the
other attendants and courtiers who crowded around his bedside, several high dignitaries of
the Church. At one time five bishops were in his chamber. They proposed repeatedly that the
king should partake of the sacrament. This was a customary rite to be performed upon the dying,
it being considered the symbol and seal of a final reconciliation with God and preparation
for heaven. Whenever the proposal was made, the king declined or evaded it. He said he was
"too weak," or "not now," or "there will be time enough yet;" and thus day after day moved on.

In the mean time, the anxious and unhappy queen had so far recovered that she came to see the
king, and was often at his bedside, watching his symptoms and mourning over his approaching
fate. These interviews were, however, all public, for the large apartment in which the king
was lying was always full. There were ladies of the court, too, who claimed the privilege which
royal etiquette accorded them of always accompanying the queen on these visits to the bedside
of her dying husband. She could say nothing in private; and then, besides, her agitation and
distress were so extreme, that she was incapable of any thing like calm and considerate action.

Among the favorite intimates of the king, perhaps the most prominent was the Duchess of Portsmouth.
The king himself had raised her to that rank. She was a French girl, who came over, originally,
from the Continent with a party of visitors from the French court. Her beauty, her wit, and
her accomplishments soon made her a great favorite with the king, and for many years of his
life she had exerted an unbounded and a guilty influence over him. She was a Catholic. Though
not allowed to come to his bedside, she remained in her apartment overwhelmed with grief at
the approaching death of her lover, and, strange as it may seem, she was earnestly desirous
to obtain for him the spiritual succors which, as a Catholic, she considered essential to his
dying in peace. After repeated and vain endeavors made in other ways to accomplish her object,
she at length sent for the French ambassador to come to her rooms from the king's chamber,
and urged him to do something to save the dying sinner's soul. "He is in heart a Catholic,"
said she. "I am sure he wishes to receive the Catholic sacraments. I can not do any thing,
and the Duke of York is so full of business and excitement that he does not think of it. But
something must be done."

The ambassador went in pursuit of the Duke of York. He took him aside, and with great caution
and secrecy suggested the subject. "You are right," said the duke, "and there is no time to
lose." The duke went to the king's chamber. The English clergymen had just been offering the
king the sacrament once more, and he had declined it again. James asked them to retire from
the alcove, as he wished to speak privately to his majesty. They did so, supposing that he
wished to communicate with him on some business of state.

"Sire," said the duke to his dying brother, "you decline the sacraments of the Protestant Church,
will you receive those of the Catholic?"

The countenance of the dying man evinced a faint though immediate expression of returning animation
and pleasure at this suggestion. "Yes," said he, "I would give every thing in the world to
see a priest."

"I will bring you one," said James.

"Do," said the king, "for God's sake, do; but shall you not expose yourself to danger by it?"

"I will bring you one, though it cost me my life," replied the duke.

This conversation was held in a whisper, to prevent its being overheard by the various groups
in the room. The duke afterward said that he had to repeat his words several times to make
the king comprehend them, his sense of hearing having obviously begun to fail.
