Mrs. Hall very kindly told me that she had called to invite me to seek a retreat with her in
her charming little country house near London. I do not mean that she called it a charming
little retreat, but that every one who speaks of it gives it that character. She told me that
I should there have positive and perfect quiet; and what could attract me more than that? She
said, moreover, that there they had a great many nightingales. Ah, this "bower of roses by
Bendemeer's stream," could I only go there! but I am tied to London by a hundred engagements.
I cannot do it. Nevertheless, I have promised that I will go and spend some time yet, when
Mr. S. leaves London.

In the course of the day I had a note from Mrs. Hall, saying that, as Sir George Smart was
about leaving town, she had not waited for me, but had taken Miss Greenfield to him herself.
She writes that he was really astonished and charmed at the wonderful weight, compass, and
power of her voice. He was also as well pleased with the mind in her singing, and her quickness
in doing and catching all that he told her. Should she have a public opportunity to perform,
he offered to hear her rehearse beforehand. Mrs. Hall says this is a great deal for him, whose
hours are all marked with gold.

LETTER XVI.

MAY 8. It stands on the borders of St. James's Park, opposite to Buckingham Palace, with a
street on the north side, and beautiful gardens on the south, while the park is extended on
the west.

We were received at the door by two stately Highlanders in full costume; and what seemed to
me an innumerable multitude of servants in livery, with powdered hair, repeated our names through
the long corridors, from one to another.

I have only a confused idea of passing from passage to passage, and from hall to hall, till
finally we were introduced into a large drawing room. No person was present, and I was at full
leisure to survey an apartment whose arrangements more perfectly suited my eye and taste than
any I had ever seen before. There was not any particular splendor of furniture, or dazzling
display of upholstery, but an artistic, poetic air, resulting from the arrangement of colors,
and the disposition of the works of virtu with which the room abounded. The great fault in
many splendid rooms, is, that they are arranged without any eye to unity of impression. The
things in them may be all fine in their way, but there is no harmony of result.

People do not often consider that there may be a general sentiment to be expressed in the arrangement
of a room, as well as in the composition of a picture. It is this leading idea which corresponds
to what painters call the ground tone, or harmonizing tint, of a picture. The presence of this
often renders a very simple room extremely fascinating, and the absence of it makes the most
splendid combinations of furniture powerless to please.

The walls were covered with green damask, laid on flat, and confined in its place by narrow
gilt bands, which bordered it around the margin. The chairs, ottomans, and sofas were of white
woodwork, varnished and gilded, covered with the same.

The carpet was of a green ground, bedropped with a small yellow leaf; and in each window a
circular, standing basket contained a whole bank of primroses, growing as if in their native
soil, their pale yellow blossoms and green leaves harmonizing admirably with the general tone
of coloring.

Through the fall of the lace curtains I could see out into the beautiful grounds, whose clumps
of blossoming white lilacs, and velvet grass, seemed so in harmony with the green interior
of the room, that one would think they had been arranged as a continuation of the idea.

One of the first individual objects which attracted my attention was, over the mantel-piece,
a large, splendid picture by Landseer, which I have often seen engraved. It represents the
two eldest children of the Duchess of Sutherland, the Marquis of Stafford, and Lady Blantyre,
at that time Lady Levison Gower, in their childhood. She is represented as feeding a fawn;
a little poodle dog is holding up a rose to her; and her brother is lying on the ground, playing
with an old staghound.

I had been familiar with Landseer's engravings, but this was the first of his paintings I had
ever seen, and I was struck with the rich and harmonious quality of the coloring. There was
also a full-length marble statue of the Marquis of Stafford, taken, I should think, at about
seventeen years of age, in full Highland costume.

When the duchess appeared, I thought she looked handsomer by daylight than in the evening.
She was dressed in white muslin, with a drab velvet basque slashed with satin of the same color.
Her hair was confined by a gold and diamond net on the back part of her head. The delicacy
of his health prevents him from moving in general society, or entering into public life. He
spends much of his time in reading, and devising and executing schemes of practical benevolence
for the welfare of his numerous dependants.

I sought a little private conversation with the duchess in her boudoir, in which I frankly
confessed a little anxiety respecting the arrangements of the day: having lived all my life
in such a shady and sequestered way, and being entirely ignorant of life as it exists in the
sphere in which she moves, such apprehensions were rather natural.

She begged that I would make myself entirely easy, and consider myself as among my own friends;
that she had invited a few friends to lunch, and that afterwards others would call; that there
would be a short address from the ladies of England read by Lord Shaftesbury, which would require
no answer.

I could not but be grateful for the consideration thus evinced. The matter being thus adjusted,
we came back to the drawing room, when the party began to assemble.

The only difference, I may say, by the by, in the gathering of such a company and one with
us, is in the announcing of names at the door; a, custom which I think a good one, saving a
vast deal of the breath we always expend in company, by asking "Who is that? and that?" Then,
too, people can fall into conversation without a formal presentation, the presumption being
that nobody is invited with whom, it is not proper that you should converse. The functionary
who performed the announcing was a fine, stalwart man, in full Highland costume, the duke being
the head of a Highland clan.

The Marquis of Lansdowne now entered. He is about the middle height, with gray hair, blue eyes,
and a mild, quiet dignity of manner. He is one of those who, as Lord Henry Pettes, took a distinguished
part with Clarkson and Wilberforce in the abolition of the slave trade. He has always been
a most munificent patron of literature and art.

There were present, also, Lord John Russell, Mr. Gladstone, and Lord Grenville. The latter
we all thought very strikingly resembled in his appearance the poet Longfellow. My making the
remark introduced the subject of his poetry. The Duchess of Argyle appealed to her two little
boys, who stood each side of her, if they remembered her reading Evangeline to them. It is
a gratification to me that I find by every English fireside traces of one of our American poets.
These two little boys of the Duchess of Argyle, and the youngest son of the Duchess of Sutherland,
were beautiful fair-haired children, picturesquely attired in the Highland costume. There were
some other charming children of the family circle present. The eldest son of the Duke of Argyle
bears the title of the Lord of Lorn, which Scott has rendered so poetical a sound to our ears.

When lunch was announced, the Duke of Sutherland gave me his arm, and led me through a suite
of rooms into the dining hall. Each room that we passed was rich in its pictures, statues,
and artistic arrangements; a poetic eye and taste had evidently presided over all. The table
was beautifully laid, ornamented by two magnificent épergnes, crystal vases supported by wrought
silver standards, filled with the most brilliant hothouse flowers; on the edges of the vases
and nestling among the flowers were silver doves of the size of life. The walls of the room
were hung with gorgeous pictures, and directly opposite to me was a portrait of the Duchess
of Sutherland, by Sir Thomas Lawrence, which has figured largely in our souvenirs and books
of beauty. She is represented with a little child in her arms; this child, now Lady Blantyre,
was sitting opposite to me at table, with a charming little girl of her own, of about the same
apparent age. When one sees such things, one almost fancies this to be a fairy palace, where
the cold demons of age and time have lost their power.

I was seated next to Lord Lansdowne, who conversed much with me about affairs in America. It
seems to me that the great men of the old world regard our country thoughtfully. It is a new
development of society, acting every day with greater and greater power on the old world; nor
is it yet clearly seen what its final results will be. His observations indicated a calm, clear,
thoughtful mind--an accurate observer of life and history.

Meanwhile the servants moved noiselessly to and fro, taking up the various articles on the
table, and offering them to the guests in a peculiarly quiet manner. One of the dishes brought
to me was a plover's nest, precisely as the plover made it, with five little blue speckled
eggs in it. This mode of serving plover's eggs, as I understand it, is one of the fashions
of-the day, and has something quite sylvan and picturesque about it; but it looked so, for
all the world, like a robin's nest that I used to watch out in our home orchard, that I had
it not in my heart to profane the sanctity of the image by eating one of the eggs.

The cuisine of these West End regions appears to be entirely under French legislation, conducted
by Parisian artists, skilled in all subtle and metaphysical combinations of ethereal possibilities,
quite inscrutable to the eye of sense. Her grace's chef, I have heard it said elsewhere, bears
the reputation of being the first artist of his class in England. The profession as thus sublimated
bears the same proportion to the old substantial English cookery that Mozart's music does to
Handel's, or Midsummer Night's Dream to Paradise Lost.

This meal, called lunch, is with the English quite an institution, being apparently a less
elaborate and ceremonious dinner. Every thing is placed upon the table at once, and ladies
sit down without removing their bonnets; it is, I imagine, the most social and family meal
of the day; one in which children are admitted to the table, even in the presence of company.
It generally takes place in the middle of the day, and the dinner, which comes after it, at
eight or nine in the evening, is in comparison only a ceremonial proceeding.

I could not help thinking, as I looked around on so many men whom I had heard of historically
all my life, how very much less they bear the marks of age than men who have been connected
a similar length of time with the movements of our country. This appearance of youthfulness
and alertness has a constantly deceptive influence upon one in England. I cannot realize that
people are as old as history states them to be. In the present company there were men of sixty
or seventy, whom I should have pronounced at the first glance to be fifty.

Generally speaking our working minds seem to wear out their bodies faster; perhaps because
our climate is more stimulating; more, perhaps, from the intenser stimulus of our political
régime, which never leaves any thing long at rest.

The tone of manners in this distinguished circle did not obtrude itself upon my mind as different
from that of highly-educated people in our own country. It appeared simple, friendly, natural,
and sincere. They talked like people who thought of what they were saying, rather than how
to say it. The practice of thorough culture and good breeding is substantially the same through
the world, though smaller conventionalities may differ. All that wealth could command of artistic
knowledge and skill has been expended here to produce a superb result. It fills the entire
centre of the building, extending up to the roof and surmounted by a splendid dome. On three
sides a gallery runs round it supported by pillars. To this gallery you ascend on the fourth
side by a staircase, which midway has a broad, flat landing, from which stairs ascend, on the
right and left, into the gallery. The whole hall and staircase, carpeted with a scarlet footcloth,
give a broad, rich mass of coloring, throwing out finely the statuary and gilded balustrades.
On the landing is a marble statue of a Sibyl, by Rinaldi. The walls are adorned by gorgeous
frescos from Paul Veronese. What is peculiar in the arrangements of this hall is, that although
so extensive, it still wears an air of warm homelikeness and comfort, as if it might be a delightful
place to lounge and enjoy life, amid the ottomans, sofas, pictures, and statuary, which are
disposed here and there throughout.

All this, however, I passed rapidly by as I ascended the staircase, and passed onward to the
picture gallery. This was a room about a hundred feet long by forty wide, surmounted by a dome
gorgeously finished with golden palm, trees and carving. This hall is lighted in the evening
by a row of gaslights placed outside the ground glass of the dome; this light is concentrated
and thrown down by strong reflectors, communicating thus the most brilliant radiance without
the usual heat of gas. This gallery is peculiarly rich in paintings of the Spanish school.
Among them are two superb Murillos, taken from convents by Marshal Soult, during the time of
his career in Spain.

There was a painting by Paul de la Roche of the Earl of Strafford led forth to execution, engravings
of which we have seen in the print shops in America. It is a strong and striking picture, and
has great dramatic effect. But there was a painting in one corner by a Flemish artist, whose
name I do not now remember, representing Christ under examination before Caiaphas. It was a
candle-light scene, and only two faces were very distinct; the downcast, calm, resolute face
of Christ, in which was written a perfect knowledge of his approaching doom, and the eager,
perturbed vehemence of the high priest, who was interrogating him.

The presence of this picture here in the midst of this scene was very affecting to me. The
address will be seen in the Morning Advertiser, which I send you. The company remained a while
after this, walking through the rooms and conversing in different groups, and I talked with
several. Archbishop Whately, I thought, seemed rather inclined to be jocose: he seems to me
like some of our American divines; a man who pays little attention to forms, and does not value
them. There is a kind of brusque humor in his address, a downright heartiness, which reminds
one of western character. If he had been born in our latitude, in Kentucky or Wisconsin, the
natives would have called him Whately, and said he was a real steamboat on an argument. This
is not precisely the kind of man we look for in an archbishop. One sees traces of this humor
in his Historic Doubts concerning the Existence of Napoleon. I conversed with some who knew
him intimately, and they said that he delighted in puns and odd turns of language.

I was also introduced to the Bishop of Oxford, who is a son of Wilberforce. He is a short man,
of very youthful appearance, with bland, graceful, courteous manners. He is much admired as
a speaker. I heard him spoken of as one of the most popular preachers of the day.

I must not forget to say that many ladies of the society of Friends were here, and one came
and put on to my arm a reticule, in which, she said, were carried about the very first antislavery
tracts ever distributed in England. At that time the subject of antislavery was as unpopular
in England as it can be at this day any where in the world, and I trust that a day will come
when the subject will be as popular in South Carolina as it is now in England. People always
glory in the right after they have done it.

After a while the company dispersed over the house to look at the rooms. There are all sorts
of parlors and reception rooms, furnished with the same correct taste. Each room had its predominant
color; among them blue was a particular favorite.

The carpets were all of those small figures I have described, the blue ones being of the same
pattern with the green. The idea, I suppose, is to produce a mass of color of a certain tone,
and not to distract the eye with the complicated pattern. Where so many objects of art and
virtu are to be exhibited, without this care in regulating and simplifying the ground tints,
there would be no unity in the impression. This was my philosophizing on the matter, and if
it is not the reason why it is done, it ought to be. It is as good a theory as most theories,
at any rate.

Before we went away I made a little call on the Lady Constance Grosvenor, and saw the future
Marquis of Westminster, heir to the largest estate in England. His beautiful mother is celebrated
in the annals of the court journal as one of the handsomest ladies in England. His little lordship
was presented to me in all the dignity of long, embroidered clothes, being then, I believe,
not quite a fortnight old, and I can assure you that he demeaned himself with a gravity becoming
his rank and expectations.

There is a more than common interest attached to these children by one who watches the present
state of the world. On the character and education of the princes and nobility of this generation
the future history of England must greatly depend.

The most splendid of England's palaces has this day opened its doors to the slave. Its treasures
of wealth and of art, its prestige of high name and historic memories, have been consecrated
to the acknowledgment of Christianity in that form, wherein, in our day, it is most frequently
denied--the recognition of the brotherhood of the human family, and the equal religious value
of every human soul. A fair and noble hand by this meeting has fixed, in the most public manner,
an ineffaceable seal to the beautiful sentiments of that most Christian document, the letter
of the ladies of Great Britain to the ladies of America. That letter and this public attestation
of it are now historic facts, which wait their time and the judgment of advancing Christianity.

Concerning that letter I have one or two things to say. Nothing can be more false than the
insinuation that has been thrown out in some American papers, that it was a political movement.
It had its first origin in the deep religious feelings of the man whose whole life has been
devoted to the abolition of the white-labor slavery of Great Britain; the man whose eye explored
the darkness of the collieries, and counted the weary steps of the cotton spinners--who penetrated
the dens where the insane were tortured with darkness, and cold, and stripes; and threaded
the loathsome alleys of London, haunts of fever and cholera: this man it was, whose heart was
overwhelmed by the tale of American slavery, and who could find no relief from, this distress
except in raising some voice to the ear of Christianity. Fearful of the jealousy of political
interference, Lord Shaftesbury published an address to the ladies of England, in which he told
them that he felt himself moved by an irresistible impulse to entreat them to raise their voice,
in the name of a common Christianity and womanhood, to their American sisters. The abuse which
has fallen upon him for this most Christian proceeding does not in the least surprise him,
because it is of the kind that has always met him in every benevolent movement. When in the
Parliament of England he was pleading for women in the collieries who were harnessed like beasts
of burden, and made to draw heavy loads through miry and dark passages, and for children who
were taken at three years old to labor where the sun never shines, he was met with determined
and furious opposition and obloquy--accused of being a disorganizer, and of wishing to restore
the dark ages. Very similar accusations have attended all his efforts for the laboring classes
during the long course of seventeen years, which resulted at last in the triumphant passage
of the factory bill.

We in America ought to remember that the gentle remonstrance of the letter of the ladies of
England contains, in the mildest form, the sentiments of universal Christendom. Rebukes much
more pointed are coming back to us even from, our own missionaries. A day is coming when, past
all the temporary currents of worldly excitement, we shall, each of us, stand alone face to
face with the perfect purity of our Redeemer. The thought of such a final interview ought certainly
to modify all our judgments now, that we may strive to approve only what we shall then approve.

LETTER XVII.

MY DEAR C.:--

As to those ridiculous stories about the Duchess of Sutherland, which have found their way
into many of the prints in America, one has only to be here, moving in society, to see how
excessively absurd they are.

All my way through Scotland, and through England, I was associating, from day to day, with
people of every religious denomination, and every rank of life. I have been with, dissenters
and with churchmen; with the national Presbyterian church and the free Presbyterian; with Quakers
and Baptists.

In all these circles I have heard the great and noble of the land freely spoken of and canvassed,
and if there had been the least shadow of a foundation for any such accusations, I certainly
should have heard it recognized in some manner. If in no other, such warm friends as I have
heard speak would have alluded to the subject in the way of defence; but I have actually never
heard any allusion of any sort, as if there was any thing to be explained or accounted for.

As I have before intimated, the Howard family, to which the duchess belongs, is one which has
always been on the side of popular rights and popular reform. Lord Carlisle, her brother, has
been a leader of the people, particularly during the time of the corn-law reformation, and
she has been known to take a wide and generous interest in all these subjects. Every where
that I have moved through Scotland and England I have heard her kindness of heart, her affability
of manner, and her attention to the feelings of others spoken of as marked characteristics.

Imagine, then, what people must think when they find in respectable American prints the absurd
story of her turning her tenants out into the snow, and ordering the cottages to be set on
fire over their heads because they would not go out.

But, if you ask how such an absurd story could ever have been made up, whether there is the
least foundation to make it on, I answer, that it is the exaggerated report of a movement made
by the present Duke of Sutherland's father, in the year 1811, and which was part of a great
movement that passed through, the Highlands of Scotland, when the advancing progress of civilization
began to make it necessary to change the estates from military to agricultural establishments.

Soon after the union of the crowns of England and Scotland, the border chiefs found it profitable
to adopt upon their estates that system, of agriculture to which their hills were adapted,
rather than to continue the maintenance of military retainers. Instead of keeping garrisons,
with small armies, in a district, they decided to keep only so many as could profitably cultivate
the land. The effect of this, of course, was like disbanding an army. It threw many people
out of employ, and forced them to seek for a home elsewhere. Like many other movements which,
in their final results, are beneficial to society, this was at first vehemently resisted, and
had to be carried into effect in some cases by force. As I have said, it began first in the
southern counties of Scotland, soon after the union of the English and Scottish crowns, and
gradually crept northward--one county after another yielding to the change. To a certain extent,
as it progressed northward, the demand for labor in the great towns absorbed the surplus population;
but when it came into the extreme Highlands, this refuge was wanting. Emigration to America
now became the resource; and the surplus population were induced to this by means such as the
Colonization Society now recommends and approves for promoting emigration to Liberia.

The first farm that was so formed on the Sutherland estate was in 1806. The great change was
made in 1811-12, and completed in 1819-20.

The Sutherland estates are in the most northern portion of Scotland. The distance of this district
from the more advanced parts of the kingdom, the total want of roads, the unfrequent communication
by sea, and the want of towns, made it necessary to adopt a different course in regard to the
location of the Sutherland population from that which circumstances had provided in other parts
of Scotland, where they had been removed from the bleak and uncultivable mountains. They had
lots given them near the sea, or in more fertile spots, where, by labor and industry, they
might maintain themselves. They had two years allowed them for preparing for the change, without
payment of rent. Timber for their houses was given, and many other facilities for assisting
their change.

The general agent of the Sutherland estate is Mr. Loch. In a speech of this gentleman in the
House of Commons, on the second reading of the Scotch poor-law bill, June 12, 1845, he states
the following fact with regard to the management of the Sutherland estate during this period,
from 1811 to 1833, which certainly can speak for itself: "I can state as from fact that, from
1811 to 1833, not one sixpence of rent has been received from that county, but, on the contrary,
there has been sent there, for the benefit and improvement of the people, a sum exceeding sixty
thousand pounds."

Mr. Loch goes on in the same speech to say, "There is no set of people more industrious than
the people of Sutherland. Thirty years since they were engaged in illegal distillation to a
very great extent; at the present moment there is not, I believe, an illegal still in the county.
Their morals have improved as those habits have been abandoned; and they have added many hundreds,
I believe thousands, of acres to the land in cultivation since they were placed upon the shore.

"Previous to that change to which I have referred, they exported very few cattle, and hardly
any thing else. They were, also, every now and then, exposed to all the difficulties of extreme
famine. In the years 1812-13, and 1816-17, so great was the misery that it was necessary to
send down oatmeal for their supply to the amount of nine thousand pounds, and that was given
to the people. But, since industrious habits were introduced, and they were settled within
reach of fishing, no such calamity has overtaken them. Their condition was then so low that
they were obliged to bleed their cattle, during the winter, and mix the blood with the remnant
of meal they had, in order to save them from starvation.

"Since then the country has improved so much that the fish, in particular, which they exported,
in 1815, from one village alone, Helmsdale, (which, previous to 1811, did not exist,) amounted
to five thousand three hundred and eighteen barrels of herring, and in 1844 thirty-seven thousand
five hundred and ninety-four barrels, giving employment to about three thousand nine hundred
people. This extends over the whole of the county, in which fifty-six thousand barrels were cured.

"Do not let me be supposed to say that there are not cases requiring attention: it must be
so in a large population; but there can be no means taken by a landlord, or by those under
him, that are not bestowed upon that tenantry.

"It has been said that the contribution by the heritor (the duke) to one kirk session for the
poor was but six pounds. Now, in the eight parishes which are called Sutherland proper, the
amount of the contribution of the Duke of Sutherland to the kirk session is forty-two pounds
a year. That is a very small sum but that sum merely is so given because the landlord thinks
that he can distribute his charity in a more beneficial manner to the people; and the amount
of charity which he gives--and which, I may say, is settled on them, for it is given regularly--is
above four hundred and fifty pounds a year.

"Therefore the statements that have been made, so far from being correct, are in every way
an exaggeration of what is the fact. No portion of the kingdom has advanced in prosperity so
much; and if the honorable member (Mr. S. Crawford) will go down there, I will give him every
facility for seeing the state of the people, and he shall judge with his own eyes whether my
representation be not correct. I could go through a great many other particulars, but I will
not trouble the house now with them. The statements I have made are accurate, and I am quite
ready to prove them in any way that is necessary."

This same Mr. Loch has published a pamphlet, in which he has traced out the effects of the
system pursued on the Sutherland estate, in many very important particulars. It appears from
this that previously to 1811 the people were generally sub-tenants to middle men, who exacted
high rents, and also various perquisites, such as the delivery of poultry and eggs, giving
so many days' labor in harvest time, cutting and carrying peat and stones for building.

Since 1811 the people have become immediate tenants, at a greatly diminished rate of rent,
and released from all these exactions. For instance, in two parishes, in 1812, the rents were
one thousand five hundred and ninety-three pounds, and in 1823 they were only nine hundred
and seventy-two pounds. In another parish the reduction of rents has amounted, on an average,
to thirty-six per cent. Previous to 1811 the houses were turf huts of the poorest description,
in many instances the cattle being kept under the same roof with the family. Since 1811 a large
proportion, of their houses have been rebuilt in a superior manner--the landlord having paid
them for their old timber where it could not be moved, and having also contributed the new
timber, with lime.

Before 1811 all the rents of the estates were used for the personal profit of the landlord;
but since that time, both by the present duke and his father, all the rents have been expended
on improvements in the county, besides sixty thousand pounds more which have been remitted
from. England for the purpose. This money has been spent on churches, school houses, harbors,
public inns, roads, and bridges.

In 1811 there was not a carriage road in the county, and only two bridges. Since that time
four hundred and thirty miles of road have been constructed on the estate, at the expense of
the proprietor and tenants. There is not a turnpike gate in the county, and yet the roads are
kept perfect.

Before 1811 the mail was conveyed entirely by a foot runner, and there was but one post office
in the county; and there was no direct post across the county, but letters to the north and
west were forwarded once a month. A mail coach has since been established, to which the late
Duke of Sutherland contributed more than two thousand six hundred pounds; and since 1834 mail
gigs have been established to convey letters to the north and west coast, towards which the
Duke of Sutherland contributes three hundred pounds a year. There are thirteen post offices
and sub-offices in the county. Before 1811 there was no inn in the county fit for the reception
of strangers. Since that time there have been fourteen inns either built or enlarged by the duke.

Before 1811 there was scarcely a cart on the estate; all the carriage was done on the backs
of ponies. The cultivation of the interior was generally executed with a rude kind of spade,
and there was not a gig in the county. In 1845 there were one thousand one hundred and thirty
carts owned on the estate, and seven hundred and eight ploughs, also forty-one gigs.

Before 1812 there was no baker, and only two shops. In 1845 there were eight bakers and forty-six
grocer's shops, in nearly all of which shoe blacking was sold to some extent, an unmistakable
evidence of advancing civilization.

In 1808 the cultivation of the coast side of Sutherland was so defective that it was necessary
often, in a fall of snow, to cut down the young Scotch firs to feed the cattle on; and in 1808
hay had to be imported. Now the coast side of Sutherland exhibits an extensive district of
land cultivated according to the best principles of modern agriculture; several thousand acres
have been added to the arable land by these improvements.

Before 1811 there were no woodlands of any extent on the estate, and timber had to be obtained
from a distance. Since that time many thousand acres of woodland have been planted, the thinnings
of which, being sold to the people at a moderate rate, have greatly increased their comfort
and improved their domestic arrangements.

Before 1811 there were only two blacksmiths in the county. In 1845 there were forty-two blacksmiths
and sixty-three carpenters. Before 1829 the exports of the county consisted of black cattle
of an inferior description, pickled salmon, and some ponies; but these were precarious sources
of profit, as many died in winter for want of food; for example, in the spring of 1807 two
hundred cows, five hundred cattle, and more than two hundred ponies died in the parish of Kildonan
alone. Since that time the measures pursued by the Duke of Sutherland, in introducing improved
breeds of cattle, pigs, and modes of agriculture, have produced results in exports which tell
their own story. About forty thousand sheep and one hundred and eighty thousand fleeces of
wool are exported annually; also fifty thousand barrels of herring.

The whole fishing village of Helmsdale has been built since that time. It now contains from
thirteen to fifteen curing yards covered with slate, and several streets with houses similarly
built. The herring fishery, which has been mentioned as so productive, has been established
since the change, and affords employment to three thousand nine hundred people.

Since 1811, also, a savings bank has been established in every parish, of which the Duke of
Sutherland is patron and treasurer, and the savings have been very considerable.

The education of the children of the people has been a subject of deep interest to the Duke
of Sutherland. Besides the parochial schools, (which answer, I suppose, to our district schools,)
of which the greater number have been rebuilt or repaired at an expense exceeding what is legally
required for such purposes, the Duke of Sutherland contributes to the support of several schools
for young females, at which sewing and other branches of education are taught; and in 1844
he agreed to establish twelve general assembly schools in such parts of the county as were
without the sphere of the parochial schools, and to build school and schoolmasters' houses,
which will, upon an average, cost two hundred pounds each; and to contribute annually two hundred
pounds in aid of salaries to the teachers, besides a garden and cows' grass; and in 1845 he
made an arrangement with the education committee of the Free church, whereby no child, of whatever
persuasion, will be beyond the reach of moral and religious education.

There are five medical gentlemen on the estate, three of whom receive allowances from the Duke
of Sutherland for attendance on the poor in the districts in which they reside.

An agricultural association, or farmers' club, has been formed under the patronage of the Duke
of Sutherland, of which the other proprietors in the county, and the larger tenantry, are members,
which is in a very active and flourishing state. They have recently invited Professor Johnston
to visit Sutherland, and give lectures on agricultural chemistry.

The total population of the Sutherland estate is twenty-one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four.
To have the charge and care of so large an estate, of course, must require very systematic
arrangements; but a talent for system seems to be rather the forte of the English.

The estate is first divided into three districts, and each district is under the superintendence
of a factor, who communicates with the duke through a general agent. Besides this, when the
duke is on the estate, which is during a portion of every year, he receives on Monday whoever
of his tenants wishes to see him. Their complaints or wishes are presented in writing; he takes
them into consideration, and gives written replies.

Besides the three factors there is a ground officer, or sub-factor, in every parish, and an
agriculturist in the Dunrobin district, who gives particular attention to instructing the people
in the best methods of farming. The factors, the ground officers, and the agriculturists all
work to one common end. They teach the advantages of draining; of ploughing deep, and forming
their ridges in straight lines; of constructing tanks for saving liquid manure. The young farmers
also pick up a great deal of knowledge when working as ploughmen or laborers on the more immediate
grounds of the estate.

The head agent, Mr. Loch, has been kind enough to put into my hands a general report of the
condition of the estate, which he drew up for the inspection of the duke, May 12, 1853, and
in which he goes minutely over the condition of every part of the estate.

One anecdote of the former Duke of Sutherland will show the spirit which has influenced the
family in their management of the estate. In 1817, when there was much suffering on account
of bad seasons, the Duke of Sutherland sent down his chief agent to look into the condition
of the people, who desired the ministers of the parishes to send in their lists of the poor.
To his surprise it was found that there were located on the estate a number of people who had
settled there without leave. They amounted to four hundred and eight families, or two thousand
persons; and though they had no legal title to remain where they were, no hesitation was shown
in supplying them with food in the same manner with those who were tenants, on the sole condition
that on the first opportunity they should take cottages on the sea shore, and become industrious
people. It was the constant object of the duke to keep the rents of his poorer tenants at a
nominal amount.

What led me more particularly to inquire into these facts was, that I received by mail, while
in London, an account containing some of these stories, which had been industriously circulated
in America. There were dreadful accounts of cruelties practised in the process of inducing
the tenants to change their places of residence. The following is a specimen of these stories:--

     "I was present at the pulling down and burning of the house of
     William Chisholm, Badinloskin, in which was lying his wife's
     mother, an old, bed-ridden woman of near one hundred years of age,
     none of the family being present. I informed the persons about to
     set fire to the house of this circumstance, and prevailed on them
     to wait till Mr. Sellar came. On his arrival I told him of the poor
     old woman being in a condition unfit for removal. He replied, 'Damn
     her, the old witch, she has lived too long; let her burn.' Fire was
     immediately set to the house, and the blankets in which she was
     carried were in flames before she could be got out. She was placed
     in a little shed, and it was with great difficulty they were
     prevented from firing that also. The old woman's daughter arrived
     while the house was on fire, and assisted the neighbors in removing
     her mother out of the flames and smoke, presenting a picture of
     horror which I shall never forget, but cannot attempt to describe.
     She died within five days." 

The brush must contain but a very small portion of colour, or it would dry rough. The broad petals
are afterwards coloured as follows:--first vein the lower ends with cake smalt and crimson,
using for the purpose a fine sable brush. Then take a large brush, containing crimson alone,
and form a large round spot, gradually shading it off towards each edge. When thoroughly dry, apply
in the same manner the colour first used for veining, leaving a light
margin of the rose colour previously laid on.

With a sable brush paint some very faint pink veins, extending from the spot towards (but not
quite touching) the ends of the petals. Some dark veins are laid
on the spot also with crimson powder and cake sepia.

The middle size wire is necessary to support the flower. Commence its construction by affixing
a strip of white wax about an inch down the same; this is to represent the pistillum. Five very
fine points extend beyond the end of the wire, these are previously snipped with the scissors;
they are termed in botany the stigma. At the base of the pistillum pass a strip of green wax;
this is the foundation to which the stamina and petals are to be attached. The pistillum and stigma
are painted entirely over with the same colour previously used for veining. Cut five fine stamina
in white wax, to the points of each attach an anther, cut in deep orange wax. They are placed
across the end, and united by pressing them together with the head of the curling pin. Curl the
broad petals by laying the painted side next the hand and pressing
the thumb into its centre.

Upon the opposite side at the lower end of the petal indent and round it with the point of the
pin. The small petals are similarly curled, although it is necessary to vary them a little
according to taste; for upon observing nature it will be found that there is no formality, in
fact scarcely two petals or two flowers are precisely the same upon a tree or stem. Attach the
stamina to the foundation, and then the two broad petals; finally, the three narrowest are
placed immediately under the stamina. The calyx is cut from light
green wax.

The head of the pin is to curl each previous to its being placed behind the petals. It is shaded rather
dark green towards the stem. Wash the calyx over with a weak solution of gum water, and sprinkle
it with down. In laying on the latter do not touch it with the fingers, but throw it on from
the bottle, and shake off all that does not adhere.

SCARLET GERANIUM.

Comforting.

The petals are cut from thick white wax. Colour them upon both sides with bright scarlet (scarlet
and crimson both in powders), form a very small foundation of white wax to the end of a fine
wire. Cut five fine and short stamina, place them on the foundation, and colour them red. Affix the
five petals round, the two largest placed uppermost, the three smaller ones under. Attach calyx
as in the former flower. Cover the stem neatly with light green wax, and mount the flowers
in clusters. Make some buds moulded in light green wax, others in white wax, painted scarlet at the
points; and the calyx placed round as in the flower.

MIGNONETTE.

(RESEDA ODORATA.) Unconscious Beauty.

It is a singular circumstance that in this country this fragrant production of nature is known by
a French name, the translation of which is the "little darling," while in Paris it is only known by its
Latin appellation, reseda, (herb, or dock cresses); but I believe I am correct in stating that
its seeds were first conveyed into England from Paris. It is not particularly difficult to
form, but requires extremely good sight, and a light touch in its construction. It is of course
made without a paper pattern, and I would recommend a natural flower always to be taken as a copy.
It is also necessary to be very particular as to the lemon tint used, the orange, and the shade
of green, for if the flower is formed correctly, it still looks unnatural
if these points are not materially considered.

Take a sheet of lemon wax, very thin and not too new; cut directly from the corner six or eight
fine filaments, as pointed as possible; roll them into a small cluster. It requires two clusters
of this size, and two others nearly the same, but shorter. Fold the end of a piece of lemon
wax, and snip (very short) a few stamina, which appear, when coloured, like seed. The colour
required is a sort of pinky orange, if I may be allowed to use such a term; for which purpose
I employ my second orange, white, and a minute portion of crimson powder: of course it requires
some judgment as to the several quantities. Commence the formation by attaching a small piece
of green wax to the end of a stem made from white wire, mould it round according to nature; under
this place the cluster of orange seeds, on the top a small portion of lemon wax, and at each
corner the largest cluster of lemon stamina; the smaller clusters
place at the corners and under the orange seeds.

The calyx consists of five very narrow strips of green wax, placed neatly and regularly at
the back of the flower. Cover the stem with very light green wax.

ORANGE BLOSSOM.

(CITRUS.) Chastity.

This is cut in double white wax. It consists of five petals. The head of the small curling pin
is passed up and down over the whole of each; the petals are afterwards
curled a little with the fingers, to do away with any formality.

A middle size wire is used; pass a strip of white wax round, about half an inch in length; press it
broad at the end, and then place a fringe of stamina twice round: colour the end of the pistil
and stamina with light orange. The petals are next affixed, and a cup or calyx is formed at the
base of light green wax. The buds are moulded solid, round at the end, and pinched up into
rather an irregular form towards the base. The calyx is finished off the same as the flower.

SERINGA.

Counterfeit.

"The
sweet seringa, yielding but in scent To the rich orange."

Cut the petals in white wax, double or thick; there are but four to form the corolla. They are
curled precisely like the orange blossom. The centre is also similar to the last named, only
that there is no pistil or enlargement amongst the stamina. The calyx consists of four points of
double green wax, indented with the pin, and tipped brown. Each point is placed at the back
of each petal.

LILY.

(LILIUM CANDIDUM.) Purity of heart.

"Observe the rising lily's snowy grace."--THOMSON.

The lily is an advantageous flower in a large group. The one I am going first to notice is peculiar
for its purity of colour; it is very ornamental in a garden, and is much revered in Catholic
countries. Painters frequently place it in the hands of the Virgin.

The petals, six in number, are cut from double white wax: the broad or inner petals are curled
as follows:--pass the head of the smallest curling pin all over the petal to make it look
slightly ribbed. Press the pin firmly up the centre to make a distinct crease; turn the petal,
and press against the crease upon each side so as to form a groove. Return to the former side,
and again press the pin against the two outside edges of the previously made creases; you
will now have produced two ribs or ridges. Pass the head of the pin round the edge of the petal,
to render it thin in appearance and to stretch the same. This will also enable you to curl the petal
into form with the fingers, without splitting the edges. The outer or narrow petals are curled
similarly; but the slight difference there exists between the two will be better understood by taking
a real flower to model from. Cover a piece of middle size wire with light green wax, to represent
the pistillum: enlarge it with the same at the upper end to represent the stigma; press it into
a triangular form, and indent it with the point of the pin. Six stamina are placed round; they
are each formed in the following manner:--cover a piece of fine white wire with white wax, this
is a filament; attach to the end an anther, formed of bright orange wax, indent it strongly
across with the point of the pin. Wash it over with gum water, and while it is in a state of
moisture plunge it into the orange coloured powder. The three largest petals are placed on first,
the three smaller or outer petals at the intervening spaces.

THE LILIUM LANCIFOLIUM.

Generous heart.

The petals of this flower are curled similarly to the former, but they bend back more in the
form of a Turk's cap. There is a narrow strip of bright yellow-green wax placed in the centre,
and at the lower end of each petal. The petals are painted light pink (crimson and white), and
covered with rich crimson spots.

The roughness at the lower end of each petal is produced by cutting small pieces of double white
wax, and pressing them on with the head of the pin. The pistillum and stamina are also formed
in the same manner as the lilium candidum, but vary in colour. The filaments of the stamina
are green, the anthers rich brown, produced with crimson and cake sepia.

WHITE WATER-LILY.

(NYMPHEA ALBA.) Eloquence.

"Where will they stop, those breathing powers, The spirits of the new-born flowers? They wander
with the breeze, they wind Where'er the streams a passage find." WORDSWORTH.

Commence the foundation of this flower by passing five strips of double yellow wax round the
end of a strong wire, indenting the edge of each with the point of the curling pin, and pressing
the same into a flat surface: this foundation must be about three quarters of an inch in diameter.
Cut sixteen strips of very deep orange wax (double), about the tenth of an inch in width: place
them round at equal distances. Cut the pattern No. 1, in double yellow wax. Roll the head of
the curling pin in the broad part, and bend the point of the same back. Place these on in rows of
eight, taking care that each row is between those preceding. The petals are cut in thick white
wax: cup them with the large head ivory pin, to give them a rotundity of form; these are all
placed on in rows of four. Under the two or three largest sets it is essential to place a small
piece of white wire (covered with wax), to support each petal. The four outside petals are green externally
and white within; this is accomplished by pressing a sheet of thin
green wax against the thick white.

They are shaded brown up the centre upon the green side, using for the purpose the large brush,
slightly moistened with carmine and sepia. The stem requires to be thickly covered with light
green wax, shaded with brown, similar to the back of the flower.

THE YELLOW WATER-LILY.

Retirement.

Is much more simple to form. It consists of only five petals; these are cut in double yellow wax;
colour them rather lightly with green upon both sides, from the centre towards the base of
each. Curl the petals with the head of the large pin until they become deeply cupped. The centre
is much smaller than that of the white lily--not exceeding in diameter the third of an inch.
The stamina are produced by cutting three or four narrow strips of double yellow wax, and passing
them round the foundation; they must not extend above it, but when brushed out form a full
daisy-like centre. The five petals are attached to the back of these, and the stem finished
off as the last.

THE BLUE WATER-LILY;

Warm affection;

Forms a pleasing variety, but is not so generally well known, from the fact of its requiring care in
cultivation. Those previously described may be seen blowing luxuriantly in common ponds; but this
I am about to give instruction upon I have never seen except in a hot-house.

Cut the petals in thick white wax; attach a fine white wire half-way up the back of each. Colour
them upon both sides with light blue, or more properly speaking with blue lavender. It is a peculiar
shade of colour produced by mixing the light blue powder with white and a minute portion of crimson.
Curl the petals with the head of a large curling pin, by passing
it firmly once down each centre.

The four outside petals are green at the back, and shaded rather darker up the centre with the
same colour. The centre is formed similar to the white lily, but not so large. The stamina
are cut also in double yellow wax, and arranged regularly round in rows of sixteen; three
rows of these are sufficient. The petals are placed on four in a row throughout the flower;
the stem is moderately thick and green.

DAHLIA.

(DAHLIA PURPUREA.) Instability.

Cut the required number of petals from pink wax--colour them upon both sides with crimson. When
quite dry, wash them over lightly with bright purple (using for the
purpose a large brush, very moist.) When a second colour requires
to be laid on, I use a small portion of cake colour, (in the present
instance cake crimson, lake, with middle blue in powder.) To curl
the petals press the pin once down the centre, upon the shining side;
turn the petal, and press against the same at the point, forming a
melon-shaped section.

Fold the edges of the petal to meet at the lower end.

Make a foundation of two strips of double wax, taking care to double
in the wire. Indent it strongly with the pin towards the point, as
it must be pressed into a conical form: it must be one inch deep and
as much in circumference. Cut three strips of double wax, vandyke
them with the scissors, and indent each point with the pin, bend the
whole forward, and paint them in the same manner and colour as the
petals. Pass these strips round the foundation first, keeping them
exactly the same height. Place three rows of petals on, seven in number,
then increase them to nine in a row, and so continue until the flower
is complete. Take care to place every petal between and not behind
its predecessors, and let each row fall back, so that at the conclusion
it has a globular appearance in front, and flat at the back of the
flower. Cut the calyx in double wax; it consists of ten points, five
are light green, attached to the back of the flower, and five dark
sepals which are pendant round the stem.

THE SALVIA PATENS.

Rich
and Rare.

This flower is of so rich and lovely a hue, that for its
colour alone it deserves imitation. There are but few decidedly blue
flowers, and I do not myself know any one that approaches this for
brilliancy; it is however useful in consequence of its form being
light and spray-like. The petals require to be cut in double blue
wax; the shape must be produced previously to the colour being laid
on. Petals cut from pattern No. 1, are much rolled with the pin and
neatly united up the back. Take a piece of middle size wire, with
a small piece of wax secured at the end, and pass it through the opening
of the tube just formed. The under or banner petal is formed by pressing
it in the palm of the hand; turn up the edges of the broad end of
the petal, and turn down the edges of the narrow part; at the same
time I must mention that a small wire is placed between this petal,
by which it is affixed to its position. The buds are formed in the
same manner as the flower, with the exception of the banner petal.
The calyx consists of two points or sepals, attached one under and
the other opposite the tube. The whole is painted with deep rich blue,
produced by mixing cake smalt with the middle blue in powder. They
are mounted in a spray by placing buds and flowers down the stem,
two facing each other, and arranged alternate ways. A green leaf is
placed under each bud and blossom.

VARIEGATED CAMELLIA.

Unpretending
excellence. J. G. PERCIVAL.

As the limits of this little work will
not admit of my giving instruction in more than one of these favourite
flowers, I select the variegated one, considering it the most difficult.

The
petals require to be cut in thick wax; colour them upon both sides
with bright crimson, leaving white circular spots indiscriminately
in various parts of two petals out of every five. The largest petals
are formed by pressing the thumb very firmly upon the shining side,
taking care that the edge inclines back without any wrinkled appearance.
A crease is made up the centre upon the opposite side. Each set of
petals are painted and curled the same, but the smallest are folded
together. The stamina must be prepared from pale lemon wax, (cut double,)
and the anthers at the end tipped with orange powder to represent
the farina; they are cut into small clusters of seven or eight. Use
the large wire,--pass a piece of double wax, the width of a sheet,
and half an inch in depth, round the wire,--about half an inch deep;
bend the wire down, and mould the whole into a cone shape. Affix a
small cluster of stamina to the point, and in various directions the
five smallest petals; insert among these two or three clusters of
the stamina. Place in rows of five each succeeding set of petals,
taking care in each row to introduce about two of the variegated or
spotted petals, allowing such to be principally upon one side of the
flower (and this may be observed in nearly all flowers that are variegated.)

The
calyx is cut from lemon wax, shaded green and also brown. That were to be an artist indeed! The dog walked
about the gallery, much at home, putting his nose up first to one and then another of the distinguished
persons by whom he was surrounded; and once in a while stopping, in an easy race about the
hall, would plant himself before a picture, with his head on one side, and an air of high-bred
approval, much as I have seen young gentlemen do in similar circumstances. All he wanted was
an eyeglass, and he would have been perfectly set up as a critic.

As for the pictures, I have purposely delayed coming to them. Imagine a botanist dropped into
the middle of a blooming prairie, waving with unnumbered dyes and forms of flowers, and only
an hour to examine and make acquaintance with them! Room, after room we passed, filled with
Titians, Murillos, Guidos, &c. There were four Raphaels, the first I had ever seen. Must I
confess the truth? Raphael had been my dream for years. I expected something which would overcome
and bewilder me. I expected a divine baptism, a celestial mesmerism; and I found four very
beautiful pictures--pictures which left me quite in possession of my senses, and at liberty
to ask myself, am I pleased, and how much? It was not that I did not admire, for I did; but
that I did not admire enough. The pictures are all holy families, cabinet size: the figures,
Mary, Joseph, the infant Jesus, and John, in various attitudes. He had only to hold his tongue,
to keep his monstrous, sans-culotte opinions to himself, at least, if he could not give them
up; and she would have restored him his inheritance, would have dealt
with him not only justly, but generously. And I confess that, in that
case, I should think that there was in one or two of them a certain hardness and sharpness
of outline that was not pleasing to me. Neither, any more than Murillo, has he in these pictures
shadowed forth, to my eye, the idea of Mary. Protestant as I am, no Catholic picture contents
me. I thought to myself that I had seen among living women, and in a face not far off, a nobler
and sweeter idea of womanhood.

It is too much to ask of any earthly artist, however, to gratify the aspirations and cravings
of those who have dreamed of them for years unsatisfied. Perhaps no earthly canvas and brash
can accomplish this marvel. I think the idealist must lay aside his highest ideal, and be satisfied
he shall never meet it, and then he will begin to enjoy. With this mood and understanding I
did enjoy very much an Assumption of the Virgin, by Guido, and more especially Diana and her
Nymphs, by Titian: in this were that softness of outline, and that blending of light and shadow
into each other, of which I felt the want in the Raphaels. I felt as if there was a perfection
of cultivated art in this, a classical elegance, which, so far as it went, left the eye or
mind nothing to desire. (GARDENIA.) Sweetness.

The petals are cut in thick wax, or single wax doubled; when the latter is the case, be careful
to place the two shining sides together. It is particularly easy to form: the petals require
to be curled precisely as the yellow jasmine.

The centre is formed by crushing two or three small pieces of orange wax to the point of a wire.
The first five small petals are very faintly tinged with orange; this is merely to give warmth
to the centre of the flower, to make up for the deficiency of the
life-glow, if I may use this term--great care must therefore be taken
not to make it too dark.

All the succeeding petals are placed on in rows of five, turning some of the petals forward
towards the centre of the flower.
 His thoughts appear to be far away, his eyes looking
beyond them with an air of patient, proud weariness.

Independently of the pleasure one receives from particular pictures in these galleries, there
is a general exaltation, apart from, critical considerations, an excitement of the nerves,
a kind of dreamy state, which is a gain in our experience. Often in a landscape we first single
out particular objects,--this old oak,--that cascade,--that ruin,--and derive from them, an
individual joy; then relapsing, we view the landscape as a whole, and seem, to be surrounded
by a kind of atmosphere of thought, the result of the combined influence of all. This state,
too, I think is not without its influence in educating the æsthetic sense.
