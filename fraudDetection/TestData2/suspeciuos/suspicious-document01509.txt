When a new Government rises on the ruins of one that has been overthrown, its best chance of
conciliating the favour of the nation, if that nation be at war, is to hold out the prospect
of peace; for peace is always dear to a people.  Bonaparte was well aware of this; and if in
his heart he wished otherwise, he knew how important it was to seem to desire peace. Accordingly,
immediately after his installation at the Luxembourg he notified to all the foreign powers
his accession to the Consulate, and, for the same purpose, addressed letters to all the diplomatic
agents of the French Government abroad.

The day after he got rid of his first two colleagues, Sieyes and Roger Ducos, he prepared to
open negotiations with the Cabinet of London.  At that time we were at war with almost the
whole of Europe.  We had also lost Italy.  The Emperor of Germany was ruled by his Ministers,
who in their turn were governed by England.  It was no easy matter to manage equally the organization
of the Consular Government and the no less important affairs abroad; and it was very important
to the interests of the First Consul to intimate to foreign powers, while at the same time
he assured himself against the return of the Bourbons, that the system which he proposed to
adopt was a system of order and regeneration, unlike either the demagogic violence of the Convention
or the imbecile artifice of the Directory.  In fulfilment of this object Bonaparte directed
M. de Talleyrand, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, to make the first friendly overtures
to the English Cabinet: A correspondence ensued, which was published at the time, and which
showed at once the conciliatory policy of Bonaparte and the arrogant policy of England.

The exchange of notes which took place was attended by no immediate result. It has also been noticed
that on some soils where gypsum has long been used in growing clover the response to applications
of the plaster is a waning one, due doubtless to the too rapid depletion of the potash in the soil.

Potassic
fertilizers give the best results when applied to clovers, but dressings of phosphoric acid may
also be helpful. Applications of muriate or sulphate of potash or kainit may prove profitable,
but on many soils they are not necessary in growing clover. Wood ashes are also excellent.
They furnish potash finely divided and soluble, especially when applied
in the unleached form.

When applied unleached at the rate of 50 bushels per acre and leached at the rate of 200 bushels,
the results are usually very marked in stimulating growth in clover.

=Seasons for Sowing.=--Clovers are more commonly sown in the springtime in the Northern States
and Canada than at any other season and they are usually sown early in the spring, rather than
late. On land producing a winter crop, as rye or wheat, they can be sown in a majority of
instances as soon as the snow has melted.

That condition of soil known as honeycombed furnishes a peculiarly opportune time for sowing these
seeds, as it provides a covering for them while the land is moist, and thus puts them in a
position to germinate as soon as growth begins. Such a condition, caused by alternate freezing
and thawing, does not occur on sandy soils. Where it does not so occur, sowing ought to be
deferred until the surface of the ground has become dry enough to admit of covering with a harrow.
As in sowing the seeds of certain grasses good results usually follow sowing just after a
light fall of snow, which, as it melts, carries the seed down into the little openings in the
soil.

But there are areas, especially in the American and Canadian northwest, where in some seasons the
young clover plants would be injured from sowing the seed quite early. This, however, does
not occur very frequently. When sown on spring crops, as spring wheat,
barley and oats, the seed cannot, of course, be sown until these crops
are sown. The earlier that these crops are sown the more likely are
the clovers sown to make a stand, as they have more time to become
rooted before the dry weather of summer begins.

Though the affairs of the new Government afforded abundant occupation to Bonaparte, he yet
found leisure to direct attention to the East--to that land of despotism whence, judging from
his subsequent conduct, it might be presumed he derived his first principles of government.
On becoming the head of the State he wished to turn Egypt, which he had conquered as a general,
to the advantage of his policy as Consul.  If Bonaparte triumphed over a feeling of dislike
in consigning the command of the army to Kleber, it was because he knew Kleber to be more capable
than any other of executing the plans he had formed; and Bonaparte was not the man to sacrifice
the interests of policy to personal resentment.  It is certainly true that he then put into
practice that charming phrase of Moliere's--"I pardon you, but you shall pay me for this!"

With respect to all whom he had left in Egypt Bonaparte stood in a very singular situation.
On becoming Chief of the Government he was not only the depositary of all communications made
to the Directory; but letters sent to one address were delivered to another, and the First
Consul received the complaints made against the General who had so abruptly quitted Egypt.
In almost all the letters that were delivered to us he was the object of serious accusation.
According to some he had not avowed his departure until the very day of his embarkation; and
he had deceived everybody by means of false and dissembling proclamations. Others canvassed
his conduct while in Egypt: the army which had triumphed under his command he had abandoned
when reduced to two-thirds of its original force and a prey to all the horrors of sickness
and want: It must be confessed that these complaints and accusations were but too well founded,
and one can never cease wondering at the chain of fortunate circumstances which so rapidly
raised Bonaparte to the Consular seat. In the natural order of things, and in fulfilment of
the design which he himself had formed, he should have disembarked at Toulon, where the quarantine
laws would no doubt have been observed; instead of which, the fear of the English and the uncertainty
of the pilots caused him to go to Frejus, where the quarantine laws were violated by the very
persons most interested in respecting them.  Let us suppose that Bonaparte had been forced
to perform quarantine at Toulon.  What would have ensued?  The charges against him would have
fallen into the hands of the Directory, and he would probably have been suspended, and put
upon his trial.

Among the letters which fell into Bonaparte's hands, by reason of the abrupt change of government,
was an official despatch (of the 4th Vendemiaire, year VIII.) from General Kleber at Cairo
to the Executive Directory, in which that general spoke in very stringent terms of the sudden
departure of Bonaparte and of the state in which the army in Egypt had been left.  General
Kleber further accused him of having evaded, by his flight, the difficulties which he thus
transferred to his successor's shoulders, and also of leaving the army "without a sou in the
chest," with pay in arrear, and very little supply of munitions or clothing.

The other letters from Egypt were not less accusatory than Kleber's; and it cannot be doubted
that charges of so precise a nature, brought by the general who had now become commander-in-chief
against his predecessor, would have had great weight, especially backed as they were by similar
complaints from other quarters.  A trial would have been inevitable; and then, no 18th Brumaire,
no Consulate, no Empire, no conquest of Europe- but also, it may be added, no St. Helena. 
None of these, events would have ensued had not the English squadron, when it appeared off
Corsica, obliged the Huiron to scud about at hazard, and to touch at the first land she could
reach.

The Egyptian expedition filled too important a place in the life of Bonaparte for him to neglect
frequently reviving in the public mind the recollection of his conquests in the East.  It was
not to be forgotten that the head of the Republic was the first of her generals.  While Moreau
received the command of the armies of the Rhine, while Massena, as a reward for the victory
of Zurich, was made Commander-in-Chief in Italy, and while Brune was at the head of the army
of Batavia, Bonaparte, whose soul was in the camps, consoled himself for his temporary inactivity
by a retrospective glance on his past triumphs.  He was unwilling that Fame should for a moment
cease to blazon his name.  Accordingly, as soon as he was established at the head of the Government,
he caused accounts of his Egyptian expedition to be from time to time published in the Moniteur.
He frequently expressed his satisfaction that the accusatory correspondence, and, above all,
Kleber's letter, had fallen into his own hands.' Such was Bonaparte's perfect self-command
that immediately after perusing that letter he dictated to me the following proclamation, addressed
to the army of the East:

     SOLDIERS!--The Consuls of the French Republic frequently direct
     their attention to the army of the East.

     France acknowledges all the influence of your conquests on the
     restoration of her trade and the civilisation of the world.

     The eyes of all Europe are upon you, and in thought I am often with
     you.

     In whatever situation the chances of war may place you, prove
     yourselves still the soldiers of Rivoli and Aboukir--you will be
     invincible.

     Place in Kleber the boundless confidence which you reposed in me.
     He deserves it.

     Soldiers, think of the day when you will return victorious to the
     sacred territory of France.  That will be a glorious day for the
     whole nation.

Nothing can more forcibly show the character of Bonaparte than the above allusion to Kleber,
after he had seen the way in which Kleber spoke of him to the Directory.  Could it ever have
been imagined that the correspondence of the army, to whom he addressed this proclamation,
teemed with accusations against him?  Though the majority of these accusations were strictly
just, yet it is but fair to state that the letters from Egypt contained some calumnies.  In
answer to the well- founded portion of the charges Bonaparte said little; but he seemed to
feel deeply the falsehoods that were stated against him, one of which was, that he had carried
away millions from Egypt.  I cannot conceive what could have given rise to this false and impudent
assertion.  So far from having touched the army chest, Bonaparte had not even received all
his own pay.  Before he constituted himself the Government the Government was his debtor.

Though he knew well all that was to be expected from the Egyptian expedition, yet those who
lauded that affair were regarded with a favourable eye by Bonaparte.  The correspondence which
had fallen into his hands was to him of the highest importance in enabling him to ascertain
the opinions which particular individuals entertained of him.

It was the source of favours and disgraces which those who were not in the secret could not
account for.  It serves to explain why many men of mediocrity were elevated to the highest
dignities and honours, while other men of real merit fell into disgrace or were utterly neglected.

In perusing the history of the distinguished characters of past ages, how often do we regret
that the historian should have portrayed the hero rather than the man!  We wish to know even
the most trivial habits of those whom great, talents and vast reputation have elevated above
their fellow-creatures.  Is this the effect of mere curiosity, or rather is it not an involuntary
feeling of vanity which prompts us to console ourselves for the superiority of great men by
reflecting on their faults, their weaknesses, their absurdities; in short, all the points of
resemblance between them and common men?  For the satisfaction of those who are curious in
details of this sort, I will here endeavour to paint Bonaparte, as I saw him, in person and
in mind, to describe what were his tastes and habits, and even his whims and caprices.

Bonaparte was now in the prime of life, and about thirty.  The person of Bonaparte has served
as a model for the most skilful painters and sculptors; many able French artists have successfully
delineated his features, and yet it may be said that no perfectly faithful portrait of him
exists.  His finely-shaped head, his superb forehead, his pale countenance, and his usual meditative
look, have been transferred to the canvas; but the versatility of his expression was beyond
the reach of imitation: All the various workings of his mind were instantaneously depicted
in his countenance; and his glance changed from mild to severe, and from angry to good-humoured,
almost with the rapidity of lightning. It may truly be said that he had a particular look for
every thought that arose in his mind.

Bonaparte had beautiful hands, and he was very proud of them; while conversing he would often
look at them with an air of self-complacency. He also fancied he had fine teeth, but his pretension
to that advantage was not so well founded as his vanity on the score of his hands.

When walking, either alone or in company with any one, in his apartments or in his gardens,
he had the habit of stooping a little, and crossing his hands behind his back.  He frequently
gave an involuntary shrug of his right shoulder, which was accompanied by a movement of his
mouth from left to right.  This habit was always most remarkable when his mind was absorbed
in the consideration of any profound subject.  It was often while walking that he dictated
to me his most important notes.  He could endure great fatigue, not only on horseback but on
foot; he would sometimes walk for five or six hours in succession without being aware of it.

When walking with any person whom he treated with familiarity he would link his arm into that
of his companion, and lean on it.

He used often to say to me, "You see, Bourrienne, how temperate, and how thin I am; but, in
spite of that, I cannot help thinking that at forty I shall become a great eater, and get very
fat.  I foresee that my constitution will undergo a change.  I take a great deal of exercise;
but yet I feel assured that my presentiment will be fulfilled."  This idea gave him great uneasiness,
and as I observed nothing which seemed to warrant his apprehensions, I omitted no opportunity
of assuring him that they were groundless.  But he would not listen to me, and all the time
I was about him, he was haunted by this presentiment, which, in the end, was but too well verified.

His partiality for the bath he mistook for a necessity.  He would usually remain in the bath
two hours, during which time I used to read to him extracts from the journals and pamphlets
of the day, for he was anxious to hear and know all that was going on.  While in the bath he
was continually turning on the warm water to raise the temperature, so that I was sometimes
enveloped in such a dense vapour that I could not see to read, and was obliged to open the door.

Bonaparte was exceedingly temperate, and averse to all excess.  He knew the absurd stories
that were circulated about him, and he was sometimes vexed at theme It has been repeated, over
and over again, that he was subject to attacks of epilepsy; but during the eleven years that
I was almost constantly with him I never observed any symptom which in the least degree denoted
that malady.  His health was good and his constitution sound.  If his enemies, by way of reproach,
have attributed to him a serious periodical disease, his flatterers, probably under the idea
that sleep is incompatible with greatness, have evinced an equal disregard of truth in speaking
of his night-watching.  Bonaparte made others watch, but he himself slept, and slept well.
His orders were that I should call him every morning at seven.  I was therefore the first to
enter his chamber; but very frequently when I awoke him he would turn himself, and say, "Ah,
Bourrienne!  let me lie a little longer."  When there was no very pressing business I did not
disturb him again till eight o'clock.  He in general slept seven hours out of the twenty-four,
besides taking a short nap in the afternoon.

Among the private instructions which Bonaparte gave me, one was very curious.  "During the
night," said he, "enter my chamber as seldom as possible.  Do not awake me when you have any
good news to communicate: with that there is no hurry.  But when you bring bad news, rouse
me instantly; for then there is not a moment to be lost."

This was a wise regulation, and Bonaparte found his advantage in it.

As soon as he rose his 'valet de chambre' shaved him and dressed his hair.  While he was being
shaved I read to him the newspapers, beginning always with the 'Moniteur.'  He paid little
attention to any but the German and English papers.  "Pass over all that," he would say, while
I was perusing the French papers; "I know it already.  They say only what they think will please
me."  I was often surprised that his valet did not cut him while I was reading; for whenever
ha heard anything interesting he turned quickly round towards me.

When Bonaparte had finished: his toilet, which he did with great attention, for he was scrupulously
neat in his person, we went down to his cabinet.  There he signed the orders on important petitions
which had been analysed by me on the preceding evening.  On reception and parade days he was
particularly exact in signing these orders, because I used to remind him that he would be,
likely to see most of the petitioners, and that they would ask him for answers.  To spare him
this annoyance I used often to acquaint them beforehand of what had been granted or refused,
and what had been the decision of the First Consul.  He next perused the letters which I had
opened and laid on his table, ranging them according to their importance.  He directed me to
answer them in his name; he occasionally wrote the answers himself, but not often.

At ten o'clock the 'maitre d'hotel' entered, and announced breakfast, saying, "The General
is served."  We went to breakfast, and the repast was exceedingly simple.  He ate almost every
morning some chicken, dressed with oil and onions.  This dish was then, I believe, called 'poulet
a la Provencale'; but our restaurateurs have since conferred upon it the more ambitious name
of 'poulet a la Marengo.'

Bonaparte drank little wine, always either claret or Burgundy, and the latter by preference.
After breakfast, as well as after dinner, he took a cup of strong coffee.

     --[M. Brillat de Savarin, whose memory is dear to all gourmands, had
     established, as a gastronomic principle, that "he who does not take
     coffee after each meal is assuredly not a men of taste."--
     Bourrienne.]--

I never saw him take any between his meals, and I cannot imagine what could have given rise
to the assertion of his being particularly fond of coffee.  When he worked late at night he
never ordered coffee, but chocolate, of which he made me take a cup with him.  But this only
happened when our business was prolonged till two or three in the morning.

All that has been said about Bonaparte's immoderate use of snuff has no more foundation in
truth than his pretended partiality for coffee.  It is true that at an early period of his
life he began to take snuff, but it was very sparingly, and always out of a box; and if he
bore any resemblance to Frederick the Great, it was not by filling his waistcoat- pockets with
snuff, for I must again observe he carried his notions of personal neatness to a fastidious degree.

Bonaparte had two ruling passions, glory and war.  He was never more gay than in the camp,
and never more morose than in the inactivity of peace. Plans for the construction of public
monuments also pleased his imagination, and filled up the void caused by the want of active
occupation.  He was aware that monuments form part of the history of nations, of whose civilisation
they bear evidence for ages after those who created them have disappeared from the earth, and
that they likewise often bear false-witness to remote posterity of the reality of merely fabulous
conquests.  Bonaparte was, however, mistaken as to the mode of accomplishing the object he
had in view.  His ciphers, his trophies, and subsequently his eagles, splendidly adorned the
monuments of his reign. But why did he wish to stamp false initials on things with which neither
he nor his reign had any connection; as, for example the old Louvre?  Did he imagine that the
letter, "N" which everywhere obtruded itself on the eye, had in it a charm to controvert the
records of history, or alter the course of time?

     --[When Louis XVIII. returned to the Tuileries in 1814 he found that
     Bonaparte had been an excellent tenant, and that he had left
     everything in very good condition.]--

Be this as it may, Bonaparte well knew that the fine arts entail lasting glory on great actions,
and consecrate the memory of princes who protect and encourage them.  He oftener than once
said to me, "A great reputation is a great poise; the more there is made, the farther off it
is heard. Laws, institutions, monuments, nations, all fall; but the noise continues and resounds
in after ages."  This was one of his favourite ideas.  "My power," he would say at other times,
"depends on my glory, and my glory on my victories.  My power would fall were I not to support
it by new glory and new victories.  Conquest has made me what I am, and conquest alone can
maintain me."  This was then, and probably always continued to be, his predominant idea, and
that which prompted him continually to scatter the seeds of war through Europe.  He thought
that if he remained stationary ha would fall, and he was tormented with the desire of continually
advancing.  Not to do something great and decided was, in his opinion, to do nothing.  "A newly-born
Government," said he to me, "must dazzle and astonish.  When it ceases to do that it falls."
It was vain to look for rest from a man who was restlessness itself.

His sentiments towards France now differed widely from what I had known them to be in his youth.
He long indignantly cherished the recollection of the conquest of Corsica, which he was once
content to regard as his country.  But that recollection was effaced, and it might be said
that he now ardently loved France.  His imagination was fired by the very thought of seeing
her great, happy, and powerful, and, as the first nation in the world, dictating laws to the
rest.  He fancied his name inseparably connected with France, and resounding in, the ears of
posterity.  In all his actions he lost sight of the present moment, and thought only of futurity;
so, in all places where he led the way to glory, the opinion of France was ever present in
his thoughts.  As Alexander at Arbela pleased himself less in having conquered Darius than
in having gained the suffrage of the Athenians, so Bonaparte at Marengo was haunted by the
idea of what would be said in France.  Before he fought a battle Bonaparte thought little about
what he should do in case of success, but a great deal about what he should do in case of a
reverse of fortune. I mention this as a fact of which I have often been a witness, and leave
to his brothers in arms to decide whether his calculations were always correct. He had it in
his power to do much, for he risked everything and spared nothing.  His inordinate ambition
goaded him on to the attainment of power; and power when possessed served only to augment his
ambition. Bonaparte was thoroughly convinced of the truth that trifles often decide the greatest
events; therefore he watched rather than provoked opportunity, and when the right moment approached,
he suddenly took advantage of it.  It is curious that, amidst all the anxieties of war and
government, the fear of the Bourbons incessantly pursued him, and the Faubourg St. Germain
was to him always a threatening phantom.

He did not esteem mankind, whom, indeed, he despised more and more in proportion as he became
acquainted with them.  In him this unfavourable opinion of human nature was justified by many
glaring examples of baseness, and he used frequently to repeat, "There are two levers for moving
men,--interest and fear."  What respect, indeed, could Bonaparte entertain for the applicants
to the treasury of the opera?  Into this treasury the gaming-houses paid a considerable sum,
part of which went to cover the expenses of that magnificent theatre.  The rest was distributed
in secret gratuities, which were paid on orders signed by Duroc. Individuals of very different
characters were often seen catching the little door in the Rue Rameau.  The lady who was for
a while the favourite of the General-in-Chief in Egypt, and whose husband was maliciously sent
back-by the English, was a frequent visitor to the treasury.  On an occasion would be seen
assembled there a distinguished scholar and an actor, a celebrated orator and a musician; on
another, the treasurer would have payments to make to a priest, a courtesan, and a cardinal.

One of Bonaparte's greatest misfortunes was, that he neither believed in friendship not felt
the necessity of loving.  How often have I heard him say, "Friendship is but a name; I love
nobody.  I do not even love my brothers.  Perhaps Joseph, a little, from habit and because
he is my elder; and Duroc, I love him too.  But why?  Because his character pleases me.  He
is stern and resolute; and I really believe the fellow never shed a tear.  For my part, I know
very well that I have no true friends.  As long as I continue what I am, I may have as many
pretended friends as I please.  Leave sensibility to women; it is their business. But men should
be firm in heart and in purpose, or they should have nothing to do with war or government."

In his social relations Bonaparte's temper was bad; but his fits of ill- humour passed away
like a cloud, and spent themselves in words.  His violent language and bitter imprecations
were frequently premeditated. When he was going to reprimand any one he liked to have a witness
present.  He would then say the harshest things, and level blows against which few could bear
up.  But he never gave way to those violent ebullitions of rage until be acquired undoubted
proofs of the misconduct of those against whom they were directed.  In scenes of this sort
I have frequently observed that the presence of a third person seemed to give him confidence.
Consequently, in a 'tete-a-tete' interview, any one who knew his character, and who could maintain
sufficient coolness and firmness, was sure to get the better of him.  He told his friends at
St. Helena that he admitted a third person on such occasions only that the blow might resound
the farther.  That was not his real motive, or the better way would have been to perform the
scene in public.  He had other reasons.  I observed that he did not like a 'tete-a-tete'; and
when he expected any one, he would say to me beforehand, "Bourrienne, you may remain;" and
when any one was announced whom he did not expect, as a minister or a general; if I rose to
retire he would say in a half- whisper, "Stay where you are."  Certainly this was not done
with the design of getting what he said reported abroad; for it belonged neither to my character
nor my duty to gossip about what I had heard.  Besides, it may be presumed, that the few who
were admitted as witnesses to the conferences of Napoleon were aware of the consequences attending
indiscreet disclosures under a Government which was made acquainted with all that was said
and done.

Bonaparte entertained a profound dislike of the sanguinary men of the Revolution, and especially
of the regicides.  He felt, as a painful burden, the obligation of dissembling towards them.
He spoke to me in terms of horror of those whole he celled the assassins of Louis XVI, and
he was annoyed at the necessity of employing them and treating them with apparent respect.
How many times has he not said to Cambaceres, pinching him by the ear, to soften, by that habitual
familiarity, the bitterness of the remark, "My dear fellow, your case is clear; if ever the
Bourbons come back you will be hanged!"  A forced smile would then relax the livid countenance
of Cambaceres, and was usually the only reply of the Second Consul, who, however, on one occasion
said in my hearing, "Come, come, have done with this joking."

One thing which gave Bonaparte great pleasure when in the country was to see a tall, slender
woman, dressed in white, walking beneath an alley of shaded trees.  He detested coloured dresses,
and especially dark ones. To fat women he had an invincible antipathy, and he could not endure
the sight of a pregnant woman; it therefore rarely happened that a female in that situation
was invited to his parties.  He possessed every requisite for being what is called in society
an agreeable man, except the will to be so.  His manner was imposing rather than pleasing,
and those who did not know him well experienced in his presence an involuntary feeling of awe.
In the drawing-room, where Josephine did the honours with so much grace and affability, all
was gaiety and ease, and no one felt the presence of a superior; but on Bonaparte's entrance
all was changed, and every eye was directed towards him, to read his humour in his countenance,
whether he intended to be silent or talkative, dull or cheerful.

He often talked a great deal, and sometimes a little too much; but no one could tell a story
in a more agreeable and interesting way.  His conversation rarely turned on gay or humorous
subjects, and never on trivial matters.  He was so fond of argument that in the warmth of discussion
it was easy to draw from him secrets which he was most anxious to conceal.  Sometimes, in a
small circle, he would amuse himself by relating stories of presentiments and apparitions.
For this he always chose the twilight of evening, and he would prepare his hearers for what
was coming by some solemn remark.  On one occasion of this kind he said, in a very grave tone
of voice, "When death strikes a person whom we love, and who is distant from us, a foreboding
almost always denotes the event, and the dying person appears to us at the moment of his dissolution."
He then immediately related the following anecdote: "A gentleman of the Court of Louis XIV.
was in the gallery of Versailles at the time that the King was reading to his courtiers the
bulletin of the battle of Friedlingen gained by Villars.  Suddenly the gentleman saw, at the
farther end of the gallery, the ghost of his son, who served under Villars.  He exclaimed,
'My son is no more!' and next moment the King named him among the dead."

When travelling Bonaparte was particularly talkative.  In the warmth of his conversation, which
was always characterised by original and interesting idea, he sometimes dropped hints of his
future views, or, at least, he said things which were calculated to disclose what he wished
to conceal.  I took the liberty of mentioning to him this indiscretion, and far from being
offended, he acknowledged his mistake, adding that he was not aware he had gone so far.  He
frankly avowed this want of caution when at St. Helena.

When in good humour his usual tokens of kindness consisted in a little rap on the head or a
slight pinch of the ear.  In his most friendly conversations with those whom he admitted into
his intimacy he would say, "You are a fool"--"a simpleton"--"a ninny"--"a blockhead."  These,
and a few other words of like import, enabled him to vary his catalogue of compliments; but
he never employed them angrily, and the tone in which they were uttered sufficiently indicated
that they were meant in kindness.

Bonaparte had many singular habits and tastes.  Whenever he experienced any vexation, or when
any unpleasant thought occupied his mind, he would hum something which was far from resembling
a tune, for his voice was very unmusical.  He would, at the same time, seat himself before
the writing-table, and swing back in his chair so far that I have often been fearful of his
falling.

He would then vent his ill-humour on the right arm of his chair, mutilating it with his penknife,
which he seemed to keep for no other purpose.  I always took care to keep good pens ready for
him; for, as it was my business to decipher his writing, I had a strong interest in doing what
I could to make it legible.

The sound of bells always produced in Bonaparte pleasurable sensations, which I could never
account for.  When we were at Malmaison, and walking in the alley leading to the plain of Ruel,
how many times has the bell of the village church interrupted our most serious conversations!

He would stop, lest the noise of our footsteps should drown any portion of the delightful sound:
He was almost angry with me because I did not experience the impressions he did.  So powerful
was the effect produced upon him by the sound of these bells that his voice would falter as
he said, "Ah! that reminds me of the first years I spent at Brienne!  I was then happy!"  When
the bells ceased he would resume the course of his speculations, carry himself into futurity,
place a crown on his head; and dethrone kings.

Nowhere, except on the field of battle, did I ever see Bonaparte more happy than in the gardens
of Malmaison.  At the commencement of the Consulate we used to go there every Saturday evening,
and stay the whole of Sunday, and sometimes Monday.  Bonaparte used to spend a considerable
part of his time in walking and superintending the improvements which he had ordered.  At first
he used to make excursions about the neighbourhood, but the reports of the police disturbed
his natural confidence, and gave him reason to fear the attempts of concealed royalist partisans.

During the first four or five days that Bonaparte spent at Malmaison he amused himself after
breakfast with calculating the revenue of that domain.  According to his estimates it amounted
to 8000 francs.  "That is not bad!"  said he; "but to live here would require au income of
30,000 livres!" I could not help smiling to see him seriously engaged in such a calculation.

Bonaparte had no faith in medicine.  He spoke of it as an art entirely conjectural, and his
opinion on this subject was fired and incontrovertible.  His vigorous mind rejected all but
demonstrative proofs.

He had little memory for proper name, words, or dates, but he had a wonderful recollection
of facts and places.  I recollect that, on going from Paris to Toulon, he pointed out to me
ten places calculated for great battles, and he never forgot them.  They were memoranda of
his first youthful journeys.

Bonaparte was insensible to the charms of poetic harmony.  He had not even sufficient ear to
feel the rhythm, of poetry, and he never could recite a verse without violating the metre;
yet the grand ideas of poetry charmed him.  He absolutely worshipped Corneille; and, one day,
after having witnessed a performance of 'Cinna', he said to me, "If a man like Corneille were
living in my time I would make him my Prime Minister.  It is not his poetry that I most admire;
it is his powerful understanding, his vast knowledge of the human heart, and his profound policy!"
At St. Helena he said that he would have made Corneille a prince; but at the time he spoke
to me of Corneille he had no thought of making either princes or kings.

Gallantry to women was by no means a trait in Bonaparte's character. He seldom said anything
agreeable to females, and he frequently addressed to them the rudest and most extraordinary
remarks.  To one he would say, "Heavens, how red your elbows are!"  To another, "What an ugly
headdress you have got!"  At another time he would say, "Your dress is none of the cleanest.....
Do you ever change your gown?  I have seen you in that twenty times!"  He showed no mercy to
any who displeased him on these points.  He often gave Josephine directions about her toilet,
and the exquisite taste for which she was distinguished might have helped to make him fastidious
about the costume of other ladies.  At first he looked to elegance above all things: at a later
period he admired luxury and splendour, but he always required modesty.  He frequently expressed
his disapproval of the low-necked dresses which were so much in fashion at the beginning of
the Consulate.

Bonaparte did not love cards, and this was very fortunate for those who were invited to his
parties; for when he was seated at a card-table, as he sometimes thought himself obliged to
be, nothing could exceed the dulness of the drawing-room either at the Luxembourg or the Tuileries.
When, on the contrary, he walked about among the company, all were pleased, for he usually
spoke to everybody, though he preferred the conversation of men of science, especially those
who had been with him in in Egypt; as for example, Monge and Berthollet.  He also liked to
talk with Chaptal and Lacphede, and with Lemercier, the author of 'Agamemnon'.

Bonaparte was seen to less advantage in a drawing-room than at the head of his troops.  His
military uniform became him much better than the handsomest dress of any other kind.  His first
trials of dress-coats were unfortunate.  I have been informed that the first time he wore one
he kept on his black cravat.  This incongruity was remarked to him, and he replied, "So much
the better; it leaves me something of a military air, and there is no harm in that."  For my
own part, I neither saw the black cravat nor heard this reply.

The First Consul paid his own private bills very punctually; but he was always tardy in settling
the accounts of the contractors who bargained with Ministers for supplies for the public service.
He put off these payments by all sorts of excuses and shufflings.  Hence arose immense arrears
in the expenditure, and the necessity of appointing a committee of liquidation.  In his opinion
the terms contractor and rogue were synonymous.  All that he avoided paying them he regarded
as a just restitution to himself; and all the sums which were struck off from their accounts
he regarded as so much deducted from a theft.  The less a Minister paid out of his budget the
more Bonaparte was pleased with him; and this ruinous system of economy can alone explain the
credit which Decres so long enjoyed at the expense of the French navy.

On the subject of religion Bonaparte's ideas were very vague. "My reason," said he, "makes
me incredulous respecting many things; but the impressions of my childhood and early youth
throw me into uncertainty."  He was very fond of talking of religion.  In Italy, in Egypt,
and on board the 'Orient' and the 'Muiron', I have known him to take part in very animated
conversations on this subject.

He readily yielded up all that was proved against religion as the work of men and time: but
he would not hear of materialism.  I recollect that one fine night, when he was on deck with
some persons who were arguing in favour of materialism, Bonaparte raised his hand to heaven
and, pointing to the stars, said, "You may talk as long as you please, gentlemen, but who made
all that?"  The perpetuity of a name in the memory of man was to him the immortality of the
soul.  He was perfectly tolerant towards every variety of religious faith.

Among Bonaparte's singular habits was that of seating himself on any table which happened to
be of a suitable height for him.  He would often sit on mine, resting his left arm on my right
shoulder, and swinging his left leg, which did not reach the ground; and while he dictated
to me he would jolt the table so that I could scarcely write.

Bonaparte had a great dislike to reconsider any decision, even when it was acknowledged to
be unjust.  In little as well as in great things he evinced his repugnance to retrograde. 
An instance of this occurred in the affair of General Latour-Foissac.  The First Consul felt
how much he had wronged that general; but he wished some time to elapse before he repaired
his error.  His heart and his conduct were at variance; but his feelings were overcome by what
he conceived to be political necessity. Bonaparte was never known to say, "I have done wrong:"
his usual observation was, "I begin to think there is something wrong."

In spite of this sort of feeling, which was more worthy of an ill- humoured philosopher than
the head of a government, Bonaparte was neither malignant nor vindictive.  I cannot certainly
defend him against all the reproaches which he incurred through the imperious law of war and
cruel necessity; but I may say that he has often been unjustly accused.  None but those who
are blinded by fury will call him a Nero or a Caligula. I think I have avowed his faults with
sufficient candour to entitle me to credit when I speak in his commendation; and I declare
that, out of the field of battle, Bonaparte had a kind and feeling heart.  He was very fond
of children, a trait which seldom distinguishes a bad man.  In the relations of private life
to call him amiable would not be using too strong a word, and he was very indulgent to the
weakness of human nature. The contrary opinion is too firmly fixed in some minds for me to
hope to root it out.  I shall, I fear, have contradictors, but I address myself to those who
look for truth.  To judge impartially we must take into account the influence which time and
circumstances exercise on men; and distinguish between the different characters of the Collegian,
the General, the Consul, and the Emperor.

It is not my purpose to say much about the laws, decrees, and 'Senatus- Consultes', which the
First Consul either passed, or caused to be passed, after his accession to power, what were
they all, with the exception of the Civil Code?  The legislative reveries of the different
men who have from time to time ruled France form an immense labyrinth, in which chicanery bewilders
reason and common sense; and they would long since have been buried in oblivion had they not
occasionally served to authorise injustice.  I cannot, however, pass over unnoticed the happy
effect produced in Paris, and throughout the whole of France, by some of the first decisions
of the Consuls.  Perhaps none but those who witnessed the state of society during the reign
of Terror can fully appreciate the satisfaction which the first steps towards the restoration
of social order produced in the breasts of all honest men.  The Directory, more base and not
less perverse than the Convention, had retained the horrible 21st of January among the festivals
of the Republic.  One of Bonaparte's first ideas on attaining the possession of power was to
abolish this; but such was the ascendency of the abettors of the fearful event that he could
not venture on a straightforward course.  He and his two colleagues, who were Sieyes and Roger
Ducos, signed, on the 5th Nivose, a decree, setting forth that in future the only festivals
to be celebrated by the Republic were the 1st Vendemiaire and the 14th of July, intending by
this means to consecrate provisionally the recollection of the foundation of the Republic and
of liberty.

All was calculation with Bonaparte.  To produce effect was his highest gratification.  Thus
he let slip no opportunity of saying or doing things which were calculated to dazzle the multitude.
While at the Luxembourg, he went sometimes accompanied by his 'aides de camp' and sometimes
by a Minister, to pay certain official visits.  I did not accompany him on these occasions;
but almost always either on his return, after dinner, or in the evening, he related to me what
he had done and said.  He congratulated himself on having paid a visit to Daubenton, at the
Jardin des Plantes, and talked with great self-complacency of the distinguished way in which
he had treated the contemporary of Buffon.

On the 24th Brumaire he visited the prisons.  He liked to make these visits unexpectedly, and
to take the governors of the different public establishments by surprise; so that, having no
time to make their preparations, he might see things as they really were.  I was in his cabinet
when he returned, for I had a great deal of business to go through in his absence.  As he entered
he exclaimed, "What brutes these Directors are!  To what a state they have brought our public
establishments!  But, stay a little!  I will put all in order.  The prisons are in a shockingly
unwholesome state, and the prisoners miserably fed.  I questioned them, and I questioned the
jailers, for nothing is to be learned from the superiors.  They, of course, always speak well
of their own work!  When I was in the Temple I could not help thinking of the unfortunate Louis
XVI.  He was an excellent man, but too amiable, too gentle for the times.  He knew not how
to deal with mankind! And Sir Sidney Smith!  I made them show me his apartment.  If the fools
had not let him escape I should have taken St. Jean d'Acre!  There are too many painful recollections
connected with that prison!  I will certainly have it pulled down some day or other!  What
do you think I did at the Temple?  I ordered the jailers' books to be brought to me, and finding
that some hostages were still in confinement I liberated them. 'An unjust law,' said I, 'has
deprived you of liberty; my first duty is to restore it to you.' Was not this well done, Bourrienne?
"As I was, no less than Bonaparte himself, an enemy to the revolutionary laws, I congratulated
him sincerely; and he was very sensible to my approbation, for I was not accustomed to greet
him with "Good; very good," on all occasions.  It is true, knowing his character as I did,
I avoided saying anything that was calculated to offend him; but when I said nothing, he knew
very well how to construe my silence.  Had I flattered him I should have continued longer in
favour.

Bonaparte always spoke angrily of the Directors he had turned off.  Their incapacity disgusted
and astonished him.  "What simpletons!  what a government!" he would frequently exclaim when
he looked into the measures of the Directory.  "Bourrienne," said he, "can you imagine anything
more pitiable than their system of finance?  Can it for a moment be doubted that the principal
agents of authority daily committed the most fraudulent peculations?  What venality!  what
disorder!  what wastefulness!  everything put up for sale: places, provisions, clothing, and
military, all were disposed of.  Have they not actually consumed 75,000,000 in advance?  And
then, think of all the scandalous fortunes accumulated, all the malversations!  But are there
no means of making them refund?  We shall see."

In these first moments of poverty it was found necessary to raise a loan, for the funds of
M. Collot did not last long, and 12,000,000 were advanced by the different bankers of Paris,
who, I believe, were paid by bills of the receivers-general, the discount of which then amounted
to about 33 per cent.  The salaries of the first offices were not very considerable, and did
not amount to anything like the exorbitant stipends of the Empire.

Bonaparte's salary was fixed at 500,000 francs.  What a contrast to the 300,000,000 in gold
which were reported to have been concealed in 1811 in the cellars of the Tuileries!

In mentioning Bonaparte's nomination to the Institute, and his affectation in putting at the
head of his proclamation his title of member of that learned body before that of General-in-Chief,
I omitted to state what value he really attached to that title.  The truth is that; when young
and ambitious, he was pleased with the proffered title, which he thought would raise him in
public estimation.  How often have we laughed together when he weighed the value of his scientific
titles! Bonaparte, to be sure, knew something of mathematics, a good deal of history, and,
I need not add, possessed extraordinary military talent; but he was nevertheless a useless
member of the Institute.

On his return from Egypt he began to grow weary of a title which gave him so many colleagues.
"Do you not think," said he one day to me, "that there is something mean and humiliating in
the words, 'I have the honour to be, my dear Colleague'!  I am tired of it!"  Generally speaking,
all phrases which indicated equality displeased him.  It will be recollected how gratified
he was that I did not address him in the second person singular on our meeting at Leoben, and
also what befell M. de Cominges at Bale because he did not observe the same precaution.

The figure of the Republic seated and holding a spear in her hand, which at the commencement
of the Consulate was stamped on official letters, was speedily abolished.  Happy would it have
been if Liberty herself had not suffered the same treatment as her emblem!  The title of First
Consul made him despise that of Member of the Institute.  He no longer entertained the least
predilection for that learned body, and subsequently he regarded it with much suspicion.  It
was a body, an authorised assembly; these were reasons sufficient for him to take umbrage at
it, and he never concealed his dislike of all bodies possessing the privilege of meeting and
deliberating.

While we were at the Luxembourg Bonaparte despatched Duroc on a special mission to the King
of Prussia.  This happened, I think, at the very beginning of the year 1800.  He selected Duroc
because be was a man of good education and agreeable manners, and one who could express himself
with elegance and reserve, qualities not often met with at that period. Duroc had been with
us in Italy, in Egypt, and on board the 'Muiron', and the Consul easily guessed that the King
of Prussia would be delighted to hear from an eye-witness the events of Bonaparte's campaigns,
especially the siege of St. Jean d'Acre, and the scenes which took place during the months
of March and May at Jaffa.  Besides, the First Consul considered it indispensable that such
circumstantial details should be given in a way to leave no doubt of their correctness.  His
intentions were fully realised; for Duroc told me, on his return, that nearly the whole of
the conversation he had with the King turned upon St. Jean d'Acre and Jaffa. He stayed nearly
two whole hours with his Majesty, who, the day after, gave him an invitation to dinner.  When
this intelligence arrived at the Luxembourg I could perceive that the Chief of the Republic
was flattered that one of his aides de camp should have sat at table with a King, who some
years after was doomed to wait for him in his antechamber at Tilsit.

Duroc never spoke on politics to the King of Prussia, which was very fortunate, for, considering
his age and the exclusively military life he had led, he could scarcely have been expected
to avoid blunders.  Some time later, after the death of Paul I., he was sent to congratulate
Alexander on his accession to the throne.  Bonaparte's design in thus making choice of Duroc
was to introduce to the Courts of Europe, by confidential missions, a young man to whom he
was much attached, and also to bring him forward in France.  Duroc went on his third mission
to Berlin after the war broke out with Austria. He often wrote to me, and his letters convinced
me how much he had improved himself within a short time.

Another circumstance which happened at the commencement of the Consulate affords an example
of Bonaparte's inflexibility when he had once formed a determination.  In the spring of 1799,
when we were in Egypt, the Directory gave to General Latour-Foissac, a highly distinguished
officer, the command of Mantua, the taking of which had so powerfully contributed to the glory
of the conqueror of Italy.  Shortly after Latour's appointment to this important post the Austrians
besieged Mantua.  It was welt known that the garrison was supplied with provisions and ammunition
for a long resistance; yet, in the month of July it surrendered to the Austrians.  The act
of capitulation contained a curious article, viz. "General Latour-Foissac and his staff shall
be conducted as prisoners to Austria; the garrison shall be allowed to return to France." 
This distinction between the general and the troops entrusted to his command, and at the same
time the prompt surrender of Mantua, were circumstances which, it must be confessed, were calculated
to excite suspicions of Latour-Foissac.  The consequence was, when Bernadotte was made War
Minister he ordered an inquiry into the general's conduct by a court- martial.  Latour-Foissac
had no sooner returned to France than he published a justificatory memorial, in which he showed
the impossibility of his having made a longer defence when he was in want of many objects of
the first necessity.

Such was the state of the affair on Bonaparte's elevation to the Consular power.  The loss
of Mantua, the possession of which had cost him so many sacrifices, roused his indignation
to so high a pitch that whenever the subject was mentioned he could find no words to express
his rage. He stopped the investigation of the court-martial, and issued a violent decree against
Latour-Foissac even before his culpability had been proved.  This proceeding occasioned much
discussion, and was very dissatisfactory to many general officers, who, by this arbitrary decision,
found themselves in danger of forfeiting the privilege of being tried by their natural judges
whenever they happened to displease the First Consul.  For my own part, I must say that this
decree against Latour-Foissac was one which I saw issued with considerable regret. I was alarmed
for the consequences.  After the lapse of a few days I ventured to point out to him the undue
severity of the step he had taken; I reminded him of all that had been said in Latour-Foissac's
favour, and tried to convince him how much more just it would be to allow the trial to come
to a conclusion.  "In a country," said I, "like France, where the point of honour stands above
every thing, it is impossible Foissac can escape condemnation if he be culpable."--"Perhaps
you are right, Bourrienne," rejoined he; "but the blow is struck; the decree is issued. I have
given the same explanation to every one; but I cannot so suddenly retrace my steps.  To retro-grade
is to be lost.  I cannot acknowledge myself in the wrong.  By and by we shall see what can
be done.  Time will bring lenity and pardon.  At present it would be premature."  Such, word
for word, was Bonaparte's reply.  If with this be compared what he said on the subject at St.
Helena it will be found that his ideas continued nearly unchanged; the only difference is that,
instead of the impetuosity of 1800, he expressed himself with the calmness which time and adversity
naturally produce.

     --["It was," says the 'Memorial of St. Helena', "an illegal and
     tyrannical act, but still it was a necessary evil.  It was the fault
     of the law.  He was a hundred, nay, a thousand fold guilty, and yet
     it was doubtful whether he would be condemned.  We therefore
     assailed him with the shafts of honour and public opinion.  Yet I
     repeat it was a tyrannical act, and one of those violent measures
     which are at times necessary in great nations and in extraordinary
     circumstances."]--

Bonaparte, as I have before observed, loved contrasts; and I remember at the very time he was
acting so violently against Latour-Foissac he condescended to busy himself about a company
of players which he wished to send to Egypt, or rather that he pretended to wish to send there,
because the announcement of such a project conveyed an impression of the prosperous condition
of our Oriental colony.  The Consuls gravely appointed the Minister of the Interior to execute
this business, and the Minister in his turn delegated his powers to Florence, the actor.  In
their instructions to the Minister the Consuls observed that it would be advisable to include
some female dancers in the company; a suggestion which corresponds with Bonaparte's note, in
which were specified all that he considered necessary for the Egyptian expedition.

The First Consul entertained singular notions respecting literary property.  On his hearing
that a piece, entitled 'Misanthropie et Repentir', had been brought out at the Odeon, he said
to me, "Bourrienne, you have been robbed."--"I, General?  how?"--"You have been robbed, I tell
you, and they are now acting your piece."  I have already mentioned that during my stay at
Warsaw I amused myself with translating a celebrated play of Kotzebue.  While we were in Italy
I lent Bonaparte my translation to read, and he expressed himself much pleased with it. He
greatly admired the piece, and often went to see it acted at the Odeon.  On his return he invariably
gave me fresh reasons for my claiming what he was pleased to call my property.  I represented
to him that the translation of a foreign work belonged to any one who chose to execute it.
He would not, however, give up his point, and I was obliged to assure him that my occupations
in his service left me no time to engage in a literary lawsuit.  He then exacted a promise
from me to translate Goethe's 'Werther'.  I told him it was already done, though indifferently,
and that I could not possibly devote to the subject the time it merited.  I read over to him
one of the letters I had translated into French, and which he seemed to approve.

That interval of the Consular Government during which Bonaparte remained at the Luxembourg
may be called the preparatory Consulate.  Then were sown the seeds of the great events which
he meditated, and of those institutions with which he wished to mark his possession of power.
He was then, if I may use the expression, two individuals in one: the Republican general, who
was obliged to appear the advocate of liberty and the principles of the Revolution; and the
votary of ambition, secretly plotting the downfall of that liberty and those principles.

I often wondered at the consummate address with which he contrived to deceive those who were
likely to see through his designs.  This hypocrisy, which some, perhaps, may call profound
policy, was indispensable to the accomplishment of his projects; and sometimes, as if to keep
himself in practice, he would do it in matters of secondary importance.  For example, his opinion
of the insatiable avarice of Sieyes is well known; yet when he proposed, in his message to
the Council of Ancients, to give his colleague, under the title of national recompense, the
price of his obedient secession, it was, in the words of the message, a recompense worthily
bestowed on his disinterested virtues.

While at the Luxembourg Bonaparte showed, by a Consular act, his hatred of the liberty of the
press above all liberties, for he loved none. On the 27th Nivose the Consuls, or rather the
First Consul, published a decree, the real object of which was evidently contrary to its implied
object.

This decree stated that:

The Consuls of the Republic, considering that some of the journals printed at Paris are instruments
in the hands of the enemies of the Republic, over the safety of which the Government is specially
entrusted by the people of France to watch, decree--

That the Minister of Police shall, during the continuation of the war, allow only the following
journals to be printed and published, viz. (list of 20 publications)

.....and those papers which are exclusively devoted to science, art, literature, commerce,
and advertisements.

Surely this decree may well be considered as preparatory; and the fragment I have quoted may
serve as a standard for measuring the greater part of those acts by which Bonaparte sought
to gain, for the consolidation of his power, what he seemed to be seeking solely for the interest
of the friends of the Republic.  The limitation to the period of the continuance of the war
had also a certain provisional air which afforded hope for the future.  But everything provisional
is, in its nature, very elastic; and Bonaparte knew how to draw it out ad infinitum. The decree,
moreover, enacted that if any of the uncondemned journals should insert articles against the
sovereignty of the people they would be immediately suppressed.  In truth, great indulgence
was shown on this point, even after the Emperor's coronation.

The presentation of swords and muskets of honour also originated at the Luxembourg; and this
practice was, without doubt, a preparatory step to the foundation of the Legion of Honour.

     --["Armes d'honneur," decreed 25th December 1799.  Muskets for
     infantry, carbines for cavalry, grenades for artillery, swords for
     the officers.  Gouvion St. Cyr received the first sword (Thiers,
     tome i.  p.  126).]--

A grenadier sergeant, named Leon Aune, who had been included in the first distribution, easily
obtained permission to write to the First Consul to thank him.  Bonaparte, wishing to answer
him in his own name, dictated to me the following letter for Aune:--

     I have received your letter, my brave comrade.  You needed not to
     have told me of your exploits, for you are the bravest grenadier in
     the whole army since the death of Benezete.  You received one of the
     hundred sabres I distributed to the army, and all agreed you most
     deserved it.

     I wish very much again to see you.  The War Minister sends you an
     order to come to Paris.

This wheedling wonderfully favoured Bonaparte's designs.  His letter to Aune could not fail
to be circulated through the army.  A sergeant called my brave comrade by the First Consul--the
First General of France!  Who but a thorough Republican, the stanch friend of equality, would
have done this?  This was enough to wind up the enthusiasm of the army.  At the same time it
must be confessed that Bonaparte began to find the Luxembourg too little for him, and preparations
were set on foot at the Tuileries.

Still this great step towards the re-establishment of the monarchy was to be cautiously prepared.
It was important to do away with the idea that none but a king could occupy the palace of our
ancient kings.  What was to be done?  A very fine bust of Brutus had been brought from Italy.
Brutus was the destroyer of tyrants!  This was the very thing; and David was commissioned to
place it in a gallery of the Tuileries.  Could there be a greater proof of the Consul's horror
of tyranny?

To sleep at the Tuileries, in the bedchamber of the kings of France, was all that Bonaparte
wanted; the rest would follow in due course.  He was willing to be satisfied with establishing
a principle the consequences of which were to be afterwards deduced.  Hence the affectation
of never inserting in official acts the name of the Tuileries, but designating that place as
the Palace of the Government.  The first preparations were modest, for it did not become a
good Republican to be fond of pomp. Accordingly Lecomte, who was at that time architect of
the Tuileries, merely received orders to clean the Palace, an expression which might bear more
than one meaning, after the meetings which had been there.  For this purpose the sum of 500,000
francs was sufficient.  Bonaparte's drift was to conceal, as far as possible, the importance
he attached to the change of his Consular domicile.  But little expense was requisite for fitting
up apartments for the First Consul.  Simple ornaments, such as marbles and statues, were to
decorate the Palace of the Government.

Nothing escaped Bonaparte's consideration.  Thus it was not merely at hazard that he selected
the statues of great men to adorn the gallery of the Tuileries.  Among the Greeks he made choice
of Demosthenes and Alesander, thus rendering homage at once to the genius of eloquence and
the genius of victory.  The statue of Hannibal was intended to recall the memory of Rome's
most formidable enemy; and Rome herself was represented in the Consular Palace by the statues
of Scipio, Cicero, Cato, Brutus and Caesar--the victor and the immolator being placed side
by side.  Among the great men of modern times he gave the first place to Gustavus Adolphus,
and the next to Turenne and the great Conde, to Turenne in honour of his military talent, and
to Conde to prove that there was nothing fearful in the recollection of a Bourbon.  The remembrance
of the glorious days of the French navy was revived by the statue of Duguai Trouin.  Marlborough
and Prince Eugene had also their places in the gallery, as if to attest the disasters which
marked the close of the great reign; and Marshal Sage, to show that Louis XV.'s reign was not
without its glory.  The statues of Frederick and Washington were emblematic of false philosophy
on a throne and true wisdom founding a free state.  Finally, the names of Dugommier, Dampierre,
and Joubert were intended to bear evidence of the high esteem which Bonaparte cherished for
his old comrades,--those illustrious victims to a cause which had now ceased to be his.

The reader has already been informed of the attempts made by Bonaparte to induce England and
Austria to negotiate with the Consular Government, which the King of Prussia was the first
of the sovereigns of Europe to recognise.  These attempts having proved unavailing, it became
necessary to carry on the war with renewed vigour, and also to explain why the peace, which
had been promised at the beginning of the Consulate, was still nothing but a promise.  In fulfilment
of these two objects Bonaparte addressed an energetic proclamation to the armies, which was
remarkable for not being followed by the usual sacred words, "Vive la Republique!"

At the same time Bonaparte completed the formation of the Council of State, and divided it
into five sections:--(1) The Interior; (2) Finance; (3) Marine; (4) The War Department; (5)
Legislation.  He fixed the salaries of the Councillors of the State at 25,000 francs, and that
of the Precedents of Sections at 30,000.  He settled the costume of the Consuls, the Ministers,
and the different bodies of the State.  This led to the re-introduction of velvet, which had
been banished with the old regime, and the encouragement of the manufactures of Lyons was the
reason alleged for employing this un-republican article in the different dresses, each as those
of the Consuls and Ministers.  It was Bonaparte's constant: aim to efface the Republic, even
in the utmost trifles, and to prepare matters so well that the customs and habits of monarchy
being restored, there should only then remain a word to be changed.

I never remember to have seen Bonaparte in the Consular dress, which he detested, and which
he wore only because duty required him to do so at public ceremonies.  The only dress he was
fond of, and in which he felt at ease, was that in which he subjugated the ancient Eridanus
and the Nile, namely, the uniform of the Guides, to which corps Bonaparte was always sincerely
attached.

The masquerade of official dresses was not the only one which Bonaparte summoned to the aid
of his policy.  At that period of the year VIII. which corresponded with the carnival of 1800,
masques began to be resumed at Paris.  Disguises were all the fashion, and Bonaparte favoured
the revival of old amusements; first, because they were old, and next, because they were, the
means of diverting the attention of the people: for, as he had established the principle that
on the field of battle it is necessary to divide the enemy in order to beat him, he conceived
it no less advisable to divert the people in order to enslave them.  Bonaparte did not say
'panem et circenses', for I believe his knowledge of Latin did not extend even to that well-known
phrase of Juvenal, but he put the maxim in practice.  He accordingly authorised the revival
of balls at the opera, which they who lived during that period of the Consulate know was an
important event in Paris.  Some gladly viewed it as a little conquest in favour of the old
regime; and others, who for that very reason disapproved it, were too shallow to understand
the influence of little over great things.  The women and the young men did not bestow a thought
on the subject, but yielded willingly to the attractions of pleasure. Bonaparte, who was delighted
at having provided a diversion for the gossiping of the Parisian salons, said to me one day,
"While they are chatting about all this, they do not babble upon politics, and that is what
I want.  Let them dance and amuse themselves as long as they do not thrust their noses into
the Councils of the Government; besides, Bourrienne," added he, "I have other reasons for encouraging
this, I see other advantages in it.  Trade is languishing; Fouche tells me that there are great
complaints.  This will set a little money in circulation; besides, I am on my guard about the
Jacobins.  Everything is not bad, because it is not new.  I prefer the opera-balls to the saturnalia
of the Goddess of Reason.  I was never so enthusiastically applauded as at the last parade."

A Consular decision of a different and more important nature had, shortly before, namely, at
the commencement of Nivose, brought happiness to many families.  Bonaparte, as every one knows,
had prepared the events of the 18th Fructidor that he might have some plausible reasons for
overthrowing the Directors.  The Directory being overthrown, he was now anxious, at least in
part, to undo what he had done on the 18th Fructidor.  He therefore ordered a report on the
persons exiled to be presented to him by the Minister of Police.  In consequence of this report
he authorised forty of them to return to France, placing them under the observation of the
Police Minister, and assigning them their place of residence. However, they did not long remain
under these restrictions, and many of them were soon called to fill high places in the Government.
It was indeed natural that Bonaparte, still wishing, at least in appearance, to found his government
on those principles of moderate republicanism which had caused their exile, should invite them
to second his views.

Barrere wrote a justificatory letter to the First Consul, who, however, took no notice of it,
for he could not get so far as to favour Barrere. Thus did Bonaparte receive into the Councils
of the Consulate the men who had been exiled by the Directory, just as he afterwards appointed
the emigrants and those exiles of the Revolution to high offices under the Empire.  The time
and the men alone differed; the intention in both cases was the same.

CHAPTER XXX

1800.

     Bonaparte and Paul I.--Lord Whitworth--Baron Sprengporten's arrival
     at Paris--Paul's admiration of Bonaparte--Their close connection and
     correspondence--The royal challenge--General Mack--The road to
     Malmaison--Attempts at assassination--Death of Washington--National
     mourning--Ambitious calculation--M. de Fontanel, the skilful orator
     --Fete at the Temple of Mars--Murat's marriage with Caroline
     Bonaparte--Madame Bonaparte's pearls.

The first communications between Bonaparte and Paul I. commenced a short time after his accession
to the Consulate.  Affairs then began to look a little less unfavourable for France; already
vague reports from Switzerland and the banks of the Rhine indicated a coldness existing between
the Russians and the Austrians; and at the same time, symptoms of a misunderstanding between
the Courts of London and St. Petersburg began to be perceptible.  The First Consul, having
in the meantime discovered the chivalrous and somewhat eccentric character of Paul I., thought
the moment a propitious one to attempt breaking the bonds which united Russia and England.
He was not the man to allow so fine an opportunity to pass, and he took advantage of it with
his usual sagacity.  The English had some time before refused to include in a cartel for the
exchange of prisoners 7000 Russians taken in Holland.  Bonaparte ordered them all to be armed,
and clothed in new uniforms appropriate to the corps to which they had belonged, and sent them
back to Russia, without ransom, without exchange, or any condition whatever.  This judicious
munificence was not thrown away.  Paul I. showed himself deeply sensible of it, and closely
allied as he had lately been with England, he now, all at once, declared himself her enemy.
This triumph of policy delighted the First Consul.

Thenceforth the Consul and the Czar became the best friends possible. They strove to outdo
each other in professions of friendship; and it may be believed that Bonaparte did not fail
to turn this contest of politeness to his own advantage.  He so well worked upon the mind of
Paul that he succeeded in obtaining a direct influence over the Cabinet of St. Petersburg.

Lord Whitworth, at that time the English ambassador in Russia, was ordered to quit the capital
without delay, and to retire to Riga, which then became the focus of the intrigues of the north
which ended in the death of Paul.  The English ships were seized in all the ports, and, at
the pressing instance of the Czar, a Prussian army menaced Hanover. Bonaparte lost no time,
and, profiting by the friendship manifested towards him by the inheritor of Catherine's power,
determined to make that friendship subservient to the execution of the vast plan which he had
long conceived: he meant to undertake an expedition by land against the English colonies in
the East Indies.

The arrival of Baron Sprengporten at Paris caused great satisfaction among the partisans of
the Consular Government, that is to say, almost every one in Paris.  M. Sprengporten was a
native of Swedish Finland. He had been appointed by Catherine chamberlain and lieutenant-general
of her forces, and he was not less in favour with Paul, who treated him in the most distinguished
manner.  He came on an extraordinary mission, being ostensibly clothed with the title of plenipotentiary,
and at the same time appointed confidential Minister to the Consul.  Bonaparte was extremely
satisfied with the ambassador whom Paul had selected, and with the manner in, which he described
the Emperor's gratitude for the generous conduct of the First Consul.  M. Sprengporten did
not conceal the extent of Paul's dissatisfaction with his allies.  The bad issue, he said,
of the war with France had already disposed the Czar to connect himself with that power, when
the return of his troops at once determined him.

We could easily perceive that Paul placed great confidence in M. Sprengporten.  As he had satisfactorily
discharged the mission with which he had been entrusted, Paul expressed pleasure at his conduct
in several friendly and flattering letters, which Sprengporten always allowed us to read. 
No one could be fonder of France than he was, and he ardently desired that his first negotiations
might lead to a long alliance between the Russian and French Governments.  The autograph and
very frequent correspondence between Bonaparte and Paul passed through his hands.  I read all
Paul's letters, which were remarkable for the frankness with which his affection for Bonaparte
was expressed.  His admiration of the First Consul was so great that no courtier could have
written in a more flattering manner.

This admiration was not feigned on the part of the Emperor of Russia: it was no less sincere
than ardent, and of this he soon gave proofs.  The violent hatred he had conceived towards
the English Government induced him to defy to single combat every monarch who would not declare
war against England and shut his ports against English ships.  He inserted a challenge to the
King of Denmark in the St. Petersburg Court Gazette; but not choosing to apply officially to
the Senate of Hamburg to order its insertion in the 'Correspondant', conducted by M. Stoves,
he sent the article, through Count Pahlen, to M. Schramm, a Hamburg merchant.  The Count told
M. Schramm that the Emperor would be much pleased to see the article of the St. Petersburg
Court Gazette copied into the Correspondant; and that if it should be inserted, he wished to
have a dozen copies of the paper printed on vellum, and sent to him by an extraordinary courier.
It was Paul's intention to send a copy to every sovereign in Europe; but this piece of folly,
after the manner of Charles XII., led to no further results.

Bonaparte never felt greater satisfaction in the-whole course of his life than he experienced
from Paul's enthusiasm for him.  The friendship of a sovereign seemed to him a step by which
he was to become a sovereign himself.  At the same time the affairs of La Vendee began to assume
a better aspect, and he hoped soon to effect that pacification in the interior which he so
ardently desired.

It was during the First Consul's residence at the Luxembourg that the first report on the civil
code was made to the legislative body.  It was then, also, that the regulations for the management
of the Bank of France were adopted, and that establishment so necessary to France was founded.

There was at this time in Paris a man who has acquired an unfortunate celebrity, the most unlucky
of modern generals--in a word, General Mack. I should not notice that person here were it not
for the prophetic judgment which Bonaparte then pronounced on him.  Mack had been obliged to
surrender himself at Championnet some time before our landing at Frejus.  He was received as
a prisoner of war, and the town of Dijon had been appointed his place of residence, and there
he remained until after the 18th Brumaire.  Bonaparte, now Consul, permitted him to come to
Paris, and to reside there on his parole.  He applied for leave to go to Vienna, pledging himself
to return again a prisoner to France if the Emperor Francis would not consent to exchange him
for Generals Wrignon and Grouchy, then prisoners in Austria.  His request was not granted,
but his proposition was forwarded to Vienna.  The Court of Vienna refused to accede to it,
not placing perhaps so much importance on the deliverance of Mack as he had flattered himself
it would.

Bonaparte speaking to me of him one day said, "Mack is a man of the lowest mediocrity I ever
saw in my life; he is full of self-sufficiency and conceit, and believes himself equal to anything.
He has no talent. I should like to see him opposed some day to one of our good generals; we
should then see fine work.  He is a boaster, and that is all.  He is really one of the most
silly men existing; and, besides all that, he is unlucky."  Was not this opinion of Bonaparte,
formed on the past, fully verified by the future?

It was at Malmaison that Bonaparte thus spoke of General Mack.  That place was then far from
resembling what it afterwards became, and the road to it was neither pleasant nor sure.  There
was not a house on the road; and in the evening, during the season when we were there, it was
not frequented all the way from St. Germain.  Those numerous vehicles, which the demands of
luxury and an increasing population have created, did not then, as now, pass along the roads
in the environs of Paris. Everywhere the road was solitary and dangerous; and I learned with
certainty that many schemes were laid for carrying off the First Consul during one of his evening
journeys.  They were unsuccessful, and orders were given to enclose the quarries, which were
too near to the road.  On Saturday evening Bonaparte left the Luxembourg, and afterwards the
Tuileries, to go to Malmaison, and I cannot better express the joy he then appeared to experience
than by comparing it to the delight of a school-boy on getting a holiday.

Before removing from the Luxembourg to the Tuileries Bonaparte determined to dazzle the eyes
of the Parisians by a splendid ceremony.  He had appointed it to take place on the 'decadi',
Pluviose 20 (9th February 1800), that is to say, ten days before his final departure from the
old Directorial palace.  These kinds of fetes did not resemble what they afterwards became;
their attraction consisted in the splendour of military dress: and Bonaparte was always sure
that whenever he mounted his horse, surrounded by a brilliant staff from which he was to be
distinguished by the simplicity of his costume, his path would be crowded and himself greeted
with acclamations by the people of Paris.  The object of this fete was at first only to present
to the 'Hotel des Invalides', their called the Temple of Mars, seventy-two flags taken from
the Turks in the battle of Aboukir and brought from Egypt to Paris; but intelligence of Washington's
death, who expired on the 14th of December 1799, having reached Bonaparte; he eagerly took
advantage of that event to produce more effect, and mixed the mourning cypress with the laurels
he had collected in Egypt. 

On some soils the ground becomes sufficiently honeycombed through the agency of water and frost to
put it in a fine condition for receiving the seed. When this condition is not present, the
seed will usually grow if sown amid the grain and covered with the harrow.

When clovers are sown on sod land for the purpose of renewing pastures, disking them will prepare
them for receiving the seed. The extent of the disking will depend on such conditions as the
toughness of the sod and the nature of the soil. Usually disking once when the frost is out a
little way from the surface, and then disking across at an angle will suffice, and in some instances
disking one way only will be sufficient. On newly cleared lands the clovers will usually grow without
any stirring of the land before sowing, or any harrowing after sowing.

Clovers that are grown chiefly for pasture, as the small white, the
Japan and the burr, will usually obtain a hold upon the soil if scattered
upon the surface which is not soon to be cultivated.

     
     
     =Fertilizers.=--On certain soils low in fertility and much deficient
in humus, it may be necessary to apply fertilizers in some form before
clovers will grow vigorously.

Such are sandy soils that have been much worn by cropping, and also stiff clays in which the humus
has become practically exhausted.

In such instances green crops that can be grown on such lands, as rye, for instance, plowed under
when the ear begins to shoot, will be found helpful. If this can be followed on the sandy soil with
some crop to be fed off upon the land, as corn, for instance, and the clover is sown, successful
growth is likely to follow. On clays in the condition named it may not be necessary to grow a
second crop before sowing clover, since in these soils the lack is more one of humus than of
plant food. The application of farmyard manure will answer the same purpose, if it can be spared
for such a use.

Other soils are so acid that clovers will not grow on them until the acidity is corrected, notwithstanding
that plant food may be present in sufficient quantities. Such are soils, in some instances at
least, that have been newly drained, also soils that grow such plants as sorrels. This condition
will be improved if not entirely corrected by the application of lime. On such soils this
is most cheaply applied in the air-slaked form, such as is used in plastering and in quantities
to effect the end sought. These will vary, and can only be ascertained positively by experiment.

Usually
it is not necessary to apply much farmyard manure in order to induce growth in nearly all varieties
of clover, and after free growth is obtained, it is not usually necessary
to supply any subsequently for the specific purpose named.

I have said very little about Murat in the course of these Memoirs except mentioning the brilliant
part he performed in several battles.  Having now arrived at the period of his marriage with
one of Napoleon's sisters I take the opportunity of returning to the interesting events which
preceded that alliance.

His fine and well-proportioned form, his great physical strength and somewhat refined elegance
of manner,--the fire of his eye, and his fierce courage in battle, gave to Murat rather the
character of one of those 'preux chevaliers' so well described by Ariosto and Taro, that, that
a Republican soldier.  The nobleness of his look soon made the lowness of his birth be forgotten.
He was affable, polished, gallant; and in the field of battle twenty men headed by Murat were
worth a whole regiment. Once only he showed himself under the influence of fear, and the reader
shall see in what circumstance it was that he ceased to be himself.

     --[Marshal Lannes, so brave and brilliant in war and so well able to
     appreciate courage, one day sharply rebuked a colonel for having
     punished a young officer just arrived from school at Fontainebleau
     because he gave evidence of fear in his first engagement.  "Know,
     colonel," said he, "none but a poltroon (the term was oven more
     strong) will boast that he never was afraid."--Bourrienne.]--

When Bonaparte in his first Italian campaign had forced Wurmser to retreat into Mantua with
28,000 men, he directed Miollis, with only 4000 men, to oppose any sortie that might be attempted
by the Austrian general.  In one of these sorties Murat, who was at the head of a very weak
detachment, was ordered to charge Wurmser.  He was afraid, neglected to execute the order,
and in a moment of confusion said that he was wounded.  Murat immediately fell into disgrace
with the General-in-Chief, whose 'aide de camp' he was.

Murat had been previously sent to Paris to present to the Directory the first colours taken
by the French army of Italy in the actions of Dego and Mondovi, and it was on this occasion
that he got acquainted with Madame Tallien and the wife of his General.  But he already knew
the beautiful Caroline Bonaparte, whom he had seen at Rome in the residence of her brother
Joseph, who was then discharging the functions of ambassador of the Republic.  It appears that
Caroline was not even indifferent to him, and that he was the successful rival of the Princess
Santa Croce's son, who eagerly sought the honour of her hand.  Madame Tallien and Madame Bonaparte
received with great kindness the first 'aide de camp', and as they possessed much influence
with the Directory, they solicited, and easily obtained for him, the rank of brigadier-general.
It was somewhat remarkable at that time Murat, notwithstanding his newly- acquired rank, to
remain Bonaparte's 'aide de camp', the regulations not allowing a general-in-chief an 'aide
de camp' of higher rank than chief of brigade, which was equal to that of colonel: This insignificant
act was, therefore, rather a hasty anticipation of the prerogatives everywhere reserved to
princes and kings.

It was after having discharged this commission that Murat, on his return to Italy, fell into
disfavour with the General-in Chief.  He indeed looked upon him with a sort of hostile feeling,
and placed him in Reille's division, and afterwards Baragasy d'Hilliers'; consequently, when
we went to Paris, after the treaty of Campo-Formio, Murat was not of the party.  But as the
ladies, with whom he was a great favourite, were not devoid of influence with the Minister
of War, Murat was, by their interest, attached to the engineer corps in the expedition to Egypt.
On board the Orient he remained in the most complete disgrace.  Bonaparte did not address a
word to him during the passage; and in Egypt the General-in-Chief always treated him with coldness,
and often sent him from the headquarters on disagreeable services.  However, the General-in-
Chief having opposed him to Mourad Bey, Murat performed such prodigies of valour in every perilous
encounter that he effaced the transitory stain which a momentary hesitation under the walls
of Mantua had left on his character.  Finally, Murat so powerfully contributed to the success
of the day at Aboukir that Bonaparte, glad to be able to carry another laurel plucked in Egypt
to France, forgot the fault which had made so unfavourable an impression, and was inclined
to efface from his memory other things that he had heard to the disadvantage of Murat; for
I have good reasons for believing, though Bonaparte never told me so, that Murat's name, as
well as that of Charles, escaped from the lips of Junot when he made his indiscreet communication
to Bonaparte at the walls of Messoudiah.  The charge of grenadiers, commanded by Murat on the
19th Brumaire in the hall of the Five Hundred, dissipated all the remaining traces of dislike;
and in those moments when Bonaparte's political views subdued every other sentiment of his
mind, the rival of the Prince Santa Croce received the command of the Consular Guard.

     --[Joachim Murat (1771-1616), the son of an innkeeper, aide de camp
     to Napoleon in Italy, etc.; Marshal, 1804; Prince in 1806; Grand
     Admiral; Grand Duc de Berg et de Clesves, 1808; King of Naples,
     1808.  Shot by Bourbons 13th October 1815.  Married Caroline
     Bonaparte (third sister of Napoleon) 20th January 1600.]--

It may reasonably be supposed that Madame Bonaparte, in endeavouring to win the friendship
of Murat by aiding his promotion, had in view to gain one partisan more to oppose to the family
and brothers of Bonaparte; and of this kind of support she had much need.  Their jealous hatred
was displayed on every occasion; and the amiable Josephine, whose only fault was being too
much of the woman, was continually tormented by sad presentiments.  Carried away by the easiness
of her character, she did not perceive that the coquetry which enlisted for her so many defenders
also supplied her implacable enemies with weapons to use against her.

In this state of things Josephine, who was well convinced that she had attached Murat to herself
by the bonds of friendship and gratitude, and ardently desired to see him united to Bonaparte
by a family connection, favoured with all her influence his marriage with Caroline.  She was
not ignorant that a close intimacy had already sprung up at Milan between Caroline and Murat,
and she was the first to propose a marriage.  Murat hesitated, and went to consult M. Collot,
who was a good adviser in all things, and whose intimacy with Bonaparte had initiated him into
all the secrets of the family.  M. Collot advised Murat to lose no time, but to go to the First
Consul and formally demand the hand of his sister.  Murat followed his advice.  Did he do well?
It was to this step that he owed the throne of Naples.  If he had abstained he would not have
been shot at Pizzo.  'Sed ipsi Dei fata rumpere non possunt!'

However that might be, Bonaparte received, more in the manner of a sovereign than of a brother
in arms, the proposal of Murat.  He heard him with unmoved gravity, said that he would consider
the matter, but gave no positive answer.

This affair was, as may be supposed, the subject of conversation in the evening in the; salon
of the Luxembourg.  Madame Bonaparte employed all her powers of persuasion to obtain the First
Consul's consent, and her efforts were seconded by Hortense, Eugene, and myself, "Murat," said
he, among other things, "Murat is an innkeeper's son.  In the elevated rank where glory and
fortune have placed me, I never can mix his blood with mine!  Besides, there is no hurry: I
shall see by and by."  We forcibly described to him the reciprocal affection of the two young
people, and did not fail to bring to his observation Murat's devoted attachment to his person,
his splendid courage and noble conduct in Egypt.  "Yes," said he, with warmth, "I agree with
you; Murat was superb at Aboukir."  We did not allow so favourable a moment to pass by.  We
redoubled our entreaties, and at last he consented.  When we were together in his cabinet in
the evening, "Well; Bourrienne," said he to me, "you ought to be satisfied, and so am I, too,
everything considered.  Murat is suited to my sister, and then no one can say that I am proud,
or seek grand alliances.  If I had given my sister to a noble, all your Jacobins would have
raised a cry of counter-revolution.  Besides, I am very glad that my wife is interested in
this marriage, and you may easily suppose the cause.  Since it is determined on, I will hasten
it forward; we have no time to lose.  If I go to Italy I will take Murat with me.  I must strike
a decisive blow there.  Adieu."

When I entered the First Consul's chamber at seven o'clock the next day he appeared even more
satisfied than on the preceding evening with the resolution he had taken.  I easily perceived
that in spite of all his cunning, he had failed to discover the real motive which had induced
Josephine to take so lively an interest respecting Murat's marriage with Caroline.  Still Bonaparte's
satisfaction plainly showed that his wife's eagerness for the marriage had removed all doubt
in his mind of the falsity of the calumnious reports which had prevailed respecting her intimacy
with Murat.

The marriage of Murat and Caroline was celebrated at the Luxembourg, but with great modesty.
The First Consul did not yet think that his family affairs were affairs of state.  But previously
to the celebration a little comedy was enacted in which I was obliged to take a part, and I
will relate how.

At the time of the marriage of Murat Bonaparte had not much money, and therefore only gave
his sister a dowry of 30,000 francs.  Still, thinking it necessary to make her a marriage present,
and not possessing the means to purchase a suitable one, he took a diamond necklace which belonged
to his wife and gave it to the bride.  Josephine was not at all pleased with this robbery,
and taxed her wits to discover some means of replacing her necklace.

Josephine was aware that the celebrated jeweler Foncier possessed a magnificent collection
of fine pearls which had belonged, as he said, to the late Queen, Marie Antoinette.  Having
ordered them to be brought to her to examine them, she thought there were sufficient to make
a very fine necklace.  But to make the purchase 250,000 francs were required, and how to get
them was the difficulty.  Madame Bonaparte had recourse to Berthier, who was then Minister
of War.  Berthier, after, biting his nails according to his usual habit, set about the liquidation
of the debts due for the hospital service in Italy with as much speed as possible; and as in
those days the contractors whose claims were admitted overflowed with gratitude towards their
patrons, through whom they obtained payment, the pearls soon passed from Foncier's shop to
the casket of Madame Bonaparte.

The pearls being thus obtained, there was still another difficulty, which Madame Bonaparte
did not at first think of.  How was she to wear a necklace purchased without her husband's
knowledge?  Indeed it was the more difficult for her to do so as the First Consul knew very
well that his wife had no money, and being, if I may be allowed the expression, something of
the busybody, he knew, or believed he knew, all Josephine's jewels.  The pearls were therefore
condemned to remain more than a fortnight in Madame Bonaparte's casket without her daring to
use them. What a punishment for a woman!  At length her vanity overcame her prudence, and being
unable to conceal the jewels any longer, she one day said to me, "Bourrienne, there is to be
a large party here to-morrow, and I absolutely must wear my pearls.  But you know he will grumble
if he notices them.  I beg, Bourrienne, that you will keep near me.  If he asks me where I
got my pearls I must tell him, without hesitation, that I have had them a long time."

Everything happened as Josephine feared and hoped.

Bonaparte, on seeing the pearls, did not fail to say to Madame, "What is it you have got there?
How fine you are to-day!  Where did you get these pearls?  I think I never saw them before."--"Oh!
'mon Dieu'! you have seen them a dozen times!  It is the necklace which the Cisalpine Republic
gave me, and which I now wear in my hair."--"But I think--"--"Stay: ask Bourrienne, he will
tell you."--"Well, Bourrienne, what do you say to it? Do you recollect the necklace?"--"Yes,
General, I recollect very well seeing it before."  This was not untrue, for Madame Bonaparte
had previously shown me the pearls.  Besides, she had received a pearl necklace from the Cisalpine
Republic, but of incomparably less value than that purchased from Fancier.  Josephine performed
her part with charming dexterity, and I did not act amiss the character of accomplice assigned
me in this little comedy.  Bonaparte had no suspicions.  When I saw the easy confidence with
which Madame Bonaparte got through this scene, I could not help recollecting Suzanne's reflection
on the readiness with which well-bred ladies can tell falsehoods without seeming to do so.

CHAPTER XXXI.

1800.

     Police on police--False information--Dexterity of Fouche--Police
     agents deceived--Money ill applied--Inutility of political police--
     Bonaparte's opinion--General considerations--My appointment to the
     Prefecture of police.

Before taking up his quarters in the Tuileries the First Consul organised his secret police,
which was intended, at the same time, to be the rival or check upon Fouche's police.  Duroc
and Moncey were at first the Director of this police; afterwards Davonst and Junot.  Madame
Bonaparte called this business a vile system of espionage.  My remarks on the inutility of
the measure were made in vain.  Bonaparte had the weakness at once to fear Fouche and to think
him necessary.  Fouche, whose talents at this trade are too well known to need my approbation,
soon discovered this secret institution, and the names of all the subaltern agents employed
by the chief agents.  It is difficult to form an idea of the nonsense, absurdity, and falsehood
contained in the bulletins drawn up by the noble and ignoble agents of the police.  I do not
mean to enter into details on this nauseating subject; and I shall only trespass on the reader's
patience by relating, though it be in anticipation, one fact which concerns myself, and which
will prove that spies and their wretched reports cannot be too much distrusted.

During the second year of the Consulate we were established at Malmaison. Junot had a very
large sum at his disposal for the secret police of the capital.  He gave 3000 francs of it
to a wretched manufacturer of bulletins; the remainder was expended on the police of his stable
and his table.  In reading one of these daily bulletins I saw the following lines:

     "M. de Bourrienne went last night to Paris.  He entered an hotel of
     the Faubourg St. Germain, Rue de Varenne, and there, in the course
     of a very animated discussion, he gave it to be understood that the
     First Consul wished to make himself King."

As it happens, I never had opened my mouth, either respecting what Bonaparte had said to me
before we went to Egypt or respecting his other frequent conversations with me of the same
nature, during this period of his Consulship.  I may here observe, too, that I never quitted,
nor ever could quit Malmaison for a moment.  At any time, by night or day, I was subject to
be called for by the First Consul, and, as very often was the case, it so happened that on
the night in question he had dictated to me notes and instructions until three o'clock in the
morning.

Junot came every day to Malmaison at eleven o'clock in the morning.  I called him that day
into my cabinet, when I happened to be alone.  "Have you not read your bulletin?"  said I,
"Yes, I have."--"Nay, that is impossible."--"Why?"--"Because, if you had, you would have suppressed
an absurd story which relates to me."--"Ah!" he replied, "I am sorry on your account, but I
can depend on my agent, and I will not alter a word of his report."  I then told him all that
had taken place on that night; but he was obstinate, and went away unconvinced.

Every morning I placed all the papers which the First Consul had to read on his table, and
among the, first was Junot's report.  The First Consul entered and read it; on coming to the
passage concerning me he began to smile.

"Have you read this bulletin?"--"yes, General."--"What an ass that Junot is!  It is a long
time since I have known that."--" How he allows himself to be entrapped!  Is he still here?"--"I
believe so.  I have just seen him, and made observations to him, all in good part, but he would
hear nothing."--"Tell him to come here."  When Junot appeared Bonaparte began --"Imbecile that
you are! how could you send me such reports as these? Do you not read them?  How shall I be
sure that you will not compromise other persons equally unjustly?  I want positive facts, not
inventions. It is some time since your agent displeased me; dismiss him directly." Junot wanted
to justify himself, but Bonaparte cut him short--"Enough!-- It is settled!"

I related what had passed to Fouche, who told me that, wishing to amuse himself at Junot's
expense, whose police agents only picked up what they heard related in coffeehouses, gaming-houses,
and the Bourse, he had given currency to this absurd story, which Junot had credited and reported,
as he did many other foolish tales.  Fouche often caught the police of the Palace in the snares
he laid for them, and thus increased his own credit.

This circumstance, and others of the same nature, induced the First Consul to attach less importance
than at first he had to his secret police, which seldom reported anything but false and silly
stories. That wretched police!  During the time I was with him it embittered his life, and
often exasperated him against his wife, his relations, and friends.

     --[Bourrienne, it must be remembered, was a sufferer from the
     vigilance of this police.]--

Rapp, who was as frank as he was brave, tells us in his Memoirs (p. 233) that when Napoleon,
during his retreat from Moscow, while before Smolenski, heard of the attempt of Mallet, he
could not get over the adventure of the Police Minister, Savary, and the Prefect of Police,
Pasquier.  "Napoleon," says Rapp, "was not surprised that these wretches (he means the agents
of the police) who crowd the salons and the taverns, who insinuate themselves everywhere and
obstruct everything, should not have found out the plot, but he could not understand the weakness
of the Duc de Rovigo.  The very police which professed to divine everything had let themselves
be taken by surprise."  The police possessed no foresight or faculty of prevention.  Every
silly thing that transpired was reported either from malice or stupidity.  What was heard was
misunderstood or distorted in the recital, so that the only result of the plan was mischief
and confusion.

The police as a political engine is a dangerous thing.  It foments and encourages more false
conspiracies than it discovers or defeats real ones.  Napoleon has related "that M. de la Rochefoucauld
formed at Paris a conspiracy in favour of the King, then at Mittau, the first act of which
was to be the death of the Chief of the Government: The plot being discovered, a trusty person
belonging to the police was ordered to join it and become one of the most active agents.  He
brought letters of recommendation from an old gentleman in Lorraine who had held a distinguished
rank in the army of Conde."  After this, what more can be wanted?  A hundred examples could
not better show the vileness of such a system.  Napoleon, when fallen, himself thus disclosed
the scandalous means employed by his Government.

Napoleon on one occasion, in the Isle of Elba, said to an officer who was conversing with him
about France, "You believe, then; that the police agents foresee everything and know everything?
They invent more than they discover.  Mine, I believe, was better than that they have got now,
and yet it was often only by mere chance, the imprudence of the parties implicated, or the
treachery of some of them, that something was discovered after a week or fortnight's exertion."
Napoleon, in directing this officer to transmit letters to him under the cover of a commercial
correspondence, to quiet his apprehensions that the correspondence might be discovered, said,
"Do you think, then, that all letters are opened at the post office?  They would never be able
to do so.  I have often endeavoured to discover what the correspondence was that passed under
mercantile forms, but I never succeeded.  The post office, like the police, catches only fools."

Since I am on the subject of political police, that leprosy of modern society, perhaps I may
be allowed to overstep the order of time, and advert to its state even in the present day.

The Minister of Police, to give his prince a favourable idea of his activity, contrives great
conspiracies, which he is pretty sure to discover in time, because he is their originator.
The inferior agents, to find favour in the eyes of the Minister, contrive small plots.  It
would be difficult to mention a conspiracy which has been discovered, except when the police
agents took part in it, or were its promoters. It is difficult to conceive how those agents
can feed a little intrigue, the result at first, perhaps, of some petty ill-humour and discontent
which, thanks to their skill, soon becomes a great affair.  How many conspiracies have escaped
the boasted activity and vigilance of the police when none of its agents were parties.  I may
instance Babeuf's conspiracy, the attempt at the camp at Grenelle, the 18th Brumaire, the infernal
machine, Mallet, the 20th of March, the affair of Grenoble, and many others.

The political police, the result of the troubles of the Revolution, has survived them.  The
civil police for the security of property, health, and order, is only made a secondary object,
and has been, therefore, neglected.   There are times in which it is thought of more consequence
to discover whether a citizen goes to mass or confession than to defeat the designs of a band
of robbers.  Such a state of things is unfortunate for a country; and the money expended on
a system of superintendence over persons alleged to be suspected, in domestic inquisitions,
in the corruption of the friends, relations, and servants of the man marked out for destruction
might be much better employed.  The espionage of opinion, created, as I have said, by the revolutionary
troubles, is suspicious, restless, officious, inquisitorial, vexatious, and tyrannical. Indifferent
to crimes and real offences, it is totally absorbed in the inquisition of thoughts.  Who has
not heard it said in company, to some one speaking warmly, "Be moderate, M------ is supposed
to belong to the police."  This police enthralled Bonaparte himself in its snares, and held
him a long time under the influence of its power.

I have taken the liberty thus to speak of a scourge of society of which I have been a victim.
What I here state may be relied on.  I shall not speak of the week during which I had to discharge
the functions of Prefect of Police, namely, from the 13th to the 20th of March 1816. It may
well be supposed that though I had not held in abhorrence the infamous system which I have
described, the important nature of the circumstances and the short period of my administration
must have prevented me from making complete use of the means placed at my disposal. The dictates
of discretion, which I consider myself bound to obey, forbid me giving proofs of what I advance.
What it was necessary to do I accomplished without employing violent or vexatious means; and
I can take on myself to assert that no one has cause to complain of me.  Were I to publish
the list of the persons I had orders to arrest, those of them who are yet living would be astonished
that the only knowledge they had of my being tho Prefect of Police was from the Moniteur. 
I obtained by mild measures, by persuasion, and reasoning what I could never have got by violence.
I am not divulging any secrets of office, but I believe I am rendering a service to the public
in pointing out what I have often observed while an unwilling confidant in the shameful manoeuvres
of that political institution.

The word ideologue was often in Bonaparte's mouth; and in using it he endeavoured to throw
ridicule on those men whom he fancied to have a tendency towards the doctrine of indefinite
perfectibility.  He esteemed them for their morality, yet he looked on them as dreamers seeking
for the type of a universal constitution, and considering the character of man in the abstract
only.  The ideologues, according to him, looked for power in institutions; and that he called
metaphysics.  He had no idea of power except in direct force: All benevolent men who speculate
on the amelioration of human society were regarded by Bonaparte as dangerous, because their
maxims and principles were diametrically opposed to the harsh and arbitrary system he had adopted.
He said that their hearts were better than their heads, and, far from wandering with them in
abstractions, he always said that men were only to be governed by fear and interest.  The free
expression of opinion through the press has been always regarded by those who are not led away
by interest or power as useful to society.  But Bonaparte held the liberty of the press in
the greatest horror; and so violent was his passion when anything was urged in its favour that
he seemed to labour under a nervous attack.  Great man as he was, he was sorely afraid of little
paragraphs.

     --[Joseph Bonaparte fairly enough remarks on this that such writings
     had done great harm in those extraordinary times (Erreurs, tome i,
     p. 259).  Metternich, writing in 1827 with distrust of the
     proceedings of Louis XVIII., quotes, with approval, Napoleon's
     sentiments on this point.  "Napoleon, who could not have been
     wanting in the feeling of power, said to me, 'You see me master of
     Prance; well, I would not, undertake to govern her for three months
     with liberty of the press.  Louis XVIII., apparently thinking
     himself stronger than Napoleon, is not content with allowing the
     press its freedom, but has embodied its liberty in the charter"
     (Metternich, tome iv, p. 391.)]--

CHAPTER XXXII.

1800.

     Successful management of parties--Precautions--Removal from the
     Luxembourg to the Tuileries--Hackney-coaches and the Consul's white
     horses--Royal custom and an inscription--The review--Bonaparte's
     homage to the standards--Talleyrand in Bonaparte's cabinet--
     Bonaparte's aversion to the cap of liberty even in painting--The
     state bed--Our cabinet.

Of the three brothers to whom the 18th Brumaire gave birth Bonaparte speedily declared himself
the eldest, and hastened to assume all the rights of primogeniture.  He soon arrogated to himself
the whole power. The project he had formed, when he favoured the revolution of the 18th Fructidor,
was now about to be realized.  It was then an indispensable part of his plan that the Directory
should violate the constitution in order to justify a subsequent subversion of the Directory.
The expressions which escaped him from time to time plainly showed that his ambition was not
yet satisfied, and that the Consulship was only a state of probation preliminary to the complete
establishment of monarchy. The Luxembourg was then discovered to be too small for the Chief
of the Government, and it was resolved that Bonaparte should inhabit the Tuileries.  Still
great prudence was necessary to avoid the quicksands which surrounded him!  He therefore employed
great precaution in dealing with the susceptibilities of the Republicans, taking care to inure
them gradually to the temperature of absolute power.  But this mode of treatment was not sufficient;
for such was Bonaparte's situation between the Jacobins and the Royalists that he could not
strike a blow at one party without strengthening the other.  He, however, contrived to solve
this difficult problem, and weakened both parties by alternately frightening each.  "You see,
Royalists," he seemed to say, "if you do not attach yourselves to my government the Jacobins
will again rise and bring back the reign of terror and its scaffold."  To the men of the Revolution
he, on the other hand, said, "See, the counter-Revolution appears, threatening reprisals and
vengeance.  It is ready to overwhelm you; my buckler can alone protect you from its attacks."
Thus both parties were induced, from their mutual fear of each other, to attach themselves
to Bonaparte; and while they fancied they were only placing themselves under the protection
of the Chief of the Government, they were making themselves dependent on an ambitious man,
who, gradually bending them to his will, guided them as he chose in his political career. 
He advanced with a firm step; but he never neglected any artifice to conceal, as long as possible,
his designs.

I saw Bonaparte put in motion all his concealed springs; and I could not help admiring his
wonderful address.

But what most astonished me was the control he possessed over himself, in repressing any premature
manifestation of his intentions which might prejudice his projects.  Thus, for instance, he
never spoke of the Tuileries but under the name of "the Palace of the Government," and he determined
not to inhabit, at first, the ancient palace of the kings of France alone.  He contented himself
with selecting the royal apartments, and proposed that the Third Consul should also reside
in the Tuileries, and in consequence he occupied the Pavilion of Flora.  This skilful arrangement
was perfectly in accordance with the designation of "Palace of the Government" given to the
Tuileries, and was calculated to deceive, for a time; the most clear-sighted.

The moment for leaving the Luxembourg having arrived, Bonaparte still used many deceptive precautions.
The day filed for the translation of the seat of government was the 30th Pluviose, the previous
day having been selected for publishing the account of the votes taken for the acceptance of
the new Constitution.  He had, besides, caused the insertion in the 'Moniteur' of the eulogy
on Washington, pronounced, by M. de Fontanes, the decadi preceding, to be delayed for ten days.
He thought that the day when he was about to take so large a step towards monarchy would be
well chosen for entertaining the people of Paris with grand ideas of liberty, and for coupling
his own name with that of the founder of the free government of the United States.

At seven o'clock on the morning of the 30th Pluviuse I entered, as usual, the chamber of the
First Consul.  He was in a profound sleep, and this was one of the days on which I had been
desired to allow him to sleep a little longer than usual.  I have often observed that General
Bonaparte appeared much less moved when on the point of executing any great design --than during
the time of projecting it, so accustomed was he to think that what he had resolved on in his
mind, was already done.

When I returned to Bonaparte he said to me, with a marked air of satisfaction, "Well, Bourrienne,
to-night, at last, we shall sleep in the Tuileries.  You are better off than I: you are not
obliged to make a spectacle of yourself, but may go your own road there.  I must, however,
go in procession: that disgusts me; but it is necessary to speak to the eyes.  That has a good
effect on the people.  The Directory was too simple, and therefore never enjoyed any consideration.
In the army simplicity is in its proper place; but in a great city, in a palace, the Chief
of the Government must attract attention in every possible way, yet still with prudence.  Josephine
is going to look out from Lebrun's apartments; go with her, if you like; but go to the cabinet
as soon as you see me alight from my-horse."

I did not go to the review, but proceeded to the Tuileries, to arrange in our new cabinet the
papers which it was my duty to take care of, and to prepare everything for the First Consul's
arrival.  It was not until the evening that I learned, from the conversation in the salon,
where there was a numerous party, what had taken piece in the course of the day.

At one o'clock precisely Bonaparte left the Luxembourg.  The procession was, doubtless, far
from approaching the magnificent parade of the Empire: but as much pomp was introduced as the
state of things in France permitted.  The only real splendour of that period consisted in fine
troops.  Three thousand picked men, among whom was the superb regiment of the Guides, had been
ordered out for the occasion: all marched in the greatest order; with music at the head of
each corps.  The generals and their staffs were on horseback, the Ministers in carriages, which
were somewhat remarkable, as they were almost the only private carriages then in Paris, for
hackney-coaches had been hired to convey the Council of State, and no trouble had been taken
to alter them, except by pasting over the number a piece of paper of the same colour as the
body of the vehicle. The alsike, living longer, is lower in its adaptation, and alfalfa, because
of its long life, stands lowest in this respect. The small, white variety is almost invariably
grown or found growing spontaneously along with grasses, hence no definite place has been or
can be assigned to it in the rotation. Sweet clover being regarded by many as a weed has not had
any place assigned to it in a regular rotation, although in certain localities it may yet be grown
for purposes of soil renovation. (See page 306.)

All these crops are leguminous without any exception.

This fact is of great significance where crops can be rotated. They have power to gather nitrogen
from the air and store it in the soil in tubercles which form on their roots, in all soils
in which they produce a vigorous growth. This fact indicates where they should come in the rotation.
They should be grown with a view to gather food for other crops made to follow them, which have
not the same power.

          They should, therefore, be made to precede such
          crops as the small cereals, corn, the sorghums, the millets and cotton.

But since these clover plants have the power to bring nitrogen from
the air, it must not be supposed that they will grow with sufficient
vigor in soils destitute of this element.

They must be able to appropriate enough from the seed soil to give them a good start before they
can draw nitrogen from the air, hence, though they may be made to follow almost any kind of crop,
it may sometimes be necessary to apply some nitrogenous fertilizer before they will make a vigorous
growth.

The clovers, unless in the case of some of the smaller varieties, are more commonly sown to
provide hay than pasture in the first crops obtained from them. The value of the hay is increased
or lessened in proportion as weeds are present. To insure cleanliness in the hay crop, therefore,
the system which aims to sow clover seed on land to which clean cultivation has been given
while growing on them a cultivated crop, as corn or field roots,
meets with much favor.

The mechanical condition of the soil immediately after growing these crops also favors the
vigorous growth of the young clover plants, more especially when they are sown upon the surface
of the land after some form of surface cultivation, rather than upon a surface made by plowing
the land after cultivation has been given to it, but to this there may be some exceptions.

Clover
in some of its varieties is frequently grown from year to year in orchards and for the two-fold
purpose of gathering food for the trees and providing for them a cover crop in winter. The
medium red and crimson varieties are preferred for such a use. The latter is the more suitable
of the two, since it does not draw on soil moisture needed by the trees, owing to the season
at which it is grown. Enough of the seed of these crops may be allowed to mature to re-seed the
land from year to year, and thus keep it producing. The clover plants not only gather nitrogen
for the fruit trees, but in their decay they increase the power of
the soil to retain moisture for the benefit of the trees.

Some varieties of clover may be grown as catch crops, that is, as crops which are grown in addition
to some other crop produced the same season. When thus grown, it is usually for purposes of soil
improvement rather than to furnish food. The varieties best adapted for this purpose in the
Northern States and Canada are the medium red and the crimson, the latter being much more circumscribed
in the area where it will grow successfully than the former. When medium red clover is thus grown,
it is commonly sown along with one of the small cereal grains, and is buried in the autumn or in
the following spring. (See page 75.) The extent of the advantage is dependent chiefly on the amount
of the growth made, and this in turn is influenced by the character of the soil, the season,
and the nurse crop.

In certain areas favorable to the growth of clover some good farmers sow clover along with all
the small cereal grains which they grow. Crimson clover is usually sown in the late summer after
some crop has been reaped and it is plowed under the following spring.
(See page 250.)

In the Southern States Japan clover and burr clover
will serve the purpose of catch crops better than the other varieties.  This determination does not proceed from
any vain pride on my part, but is induced, by a desire to serve France.  In order that France
may be well governed, in order that there may be a unity of action in the government, you must
be First Consul, and the First Consul must have the control over all that relates directly
to politics; that is to say, over the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Police,
for Internal Affairs, and over my department, for Foreign Affairs; and, lastly, over the two
great means of execution, the military and naval forces.  It will therefore be most convenient
that the Ministers of those five departments should transact business with you.  The Administration
of Justice and the ordering of the Finances are objects certainly connected with State politics
by numerous links, which, however, are not of so intimate a nature as those of the other departments.
If you will allow me, General, I should advise that the control over the Administration of
Justice be given to the Second Consul, who is well versed in jurisprudence; and to the Third
Consul, who is equally well acquainted with Finance, the control over that department.  That
will occupy and amuse them, and you, General, having at your disposal all the vital parts of
the government, will be able to reach the end you aim at, the regeneration of France."

Bonaparte did not hear these remarkable words with indifference.  They were too much in accordance
with his own secret wishes to be listened to without pleasure; and he said to me as soon as
Talleyrand had taken leave, "Do you know, Bourrienne, I think Talleyrand gives good advice.
He is a man of great understanding."--"Such is the opinion," I replied, "of all who know him."--"He
is perfectly right."  Afterwards he added, smiling, "Tallyrand is evidently a shrewd man. 
He has penetrated my designs.  What he advises you know I am anxious to do.  But again I say,
he is right; one gets on quicker by oneself.  Lebrun is a worthy man, but he has no policy
in his head; he is a book-maker.  Cambaceres carries with him too many traditions of the Revolution.
My government must be an entirely new one."

Talleyrand's advice had been so punctually followed that even on the occasion of the installation
of the Consular Government, while Bonaparte was receiving all the great civil and military
officers of the State in the hall of presentation, Cambaceres and Lebrun stood by more like
spectators of the scene than two colleagues of the First Consul.  The Minister of the Interior
presented the civil authorities of Paris; the Minister of War, the staff of the 17th military
division; the Minister of Marine, several naval officers; and the staff of the Consular Guard
was presented by Murat.  As our Consular republicans were not exactly Spartans, the ceremony
of the presentations was followed by grand dinner- parties.  The First Consul entertained at
his table, the two other Consuls, the Ministers, and the Presidents of the great bodies of
the State.  Murat treated the heads of the army; and the members of the Council of State, being
again seated in their hackney-coaches with covered numbers, drove off to dine with Lucien.

Before taking possession of the Tuileries we had frequently gone there to see that the repairs,
or rather the whitewashing, which Bonaparte had directed to be done, was executed.  On our
first visit, seeing a number of red caps of liberty painted on the walls, he said to M. Lecomte,
at that time the architect in charge, "Get rid of all these things; I do not like to see such
rubbish."

The First Consul gave directions himself for what little alterations he wanted in his own apartments.
A state bed--not that of Louis XVI.--was placed in the chamber next his cabinet, on the south
side, towards the grand staircase of the Pavilion of Flora.  I may as well mention here that
he very seldom occupied that bed, for Bonaparte was very simple in his manner of living in
private, and was not fond of state, except as a means of imposing on mankind.  At the Luxembourg,
at Malmaison, and during the first period that he occupied the Tuileries, Bonaparte, if I may
speak in the language of common life, always slept with his wife. He went every evening down
to Josephine by a small staircase leading from a wardrobe attached to his cabinet, and which
had formerly been the chapel of Maria de Medici.  I never went to Bonaparte's bedchamber but
by this staircase; and when he came to our cabinet it was always by the wardrobe which I have
mentioned.  The door opened opposite the only window of our room, and it commanded a view of
the garden.

As for our cabinet, where so many great, and also small events were prepared, and where I passed
so many hours of my life, I can, even now, give the most minute description of it to those
who like such details.

There were two tables.  The best, which was the First Consul's, stood in the middle of the
room, and his armchair was turned with its back to the fireplace, having the window on the
right.  To the right of this again was a little closet where Duroc sat, through which we could
communicate with the clerk of the office and the grand apartments of tile Court. When the First
Consul was seated at his table in his chair (the arms of which he so frequently mutilated with
his penknife) he had a large bookcase opposite to him.  A little to the right, on one side
of the bookcase, was another door, opening into the cabinet which led directly to the state
bedchamber which I have mentioned.  Thence we passed into the grand Presentation Saloon, on
the ceiling of which Lebrun had painted a likeness of Louis XIV.  A tri-coloured cockade placed
on the forehead of the great King still bore witness of the imbecile turpitude of the Convention.
Lastly came the hall of the Guards, in front of the grand staircase of the Pavilion of Flora.

My writing-table, which was extremely plain, stood near the window, and in summer I had a view
of the thick foliage of the chestnut-trees; but in order to see the promenaders in the garden
I was obliged to raise myself from my seat.  My back was turned to the General's side, so that
it required only a slight movement of the head to speak to each other. Duroc was seldom in
his little cabinet, and that was the place where I gave some audiences.  The Consular cabinet,
which afterwards became the Imperial, has left many impressions on my mind; and I hope the
reader, in going through these volumes, will not think that they have been of too slight a
description.

CHAPTER XXXIII.

1800.

     The Tuileries--Royalty in perspective--Remarkable observation--
     Presentations--Assumption of the prerogative of mercy--M. Defeu--
     M. de Frotte--Georges Cadondal's audience of Bonaparte--Rapp's
     precaution and Bonaparte's confidence--The dignity of France--
     Napper Tandy and Blackwell delivered up by the Senate of Hamburg--
     Contribution in the Egyptian style--Valueless bill--Fifteen thousand
     francs in the drawer of a secretaire--Josephine's debts--Evening
     walks with Bonaparte.

The morning after that ardently wished-for day on which we took possession of the Palace of
the Kings of France I observed to Bonaparte on entering his chamber, "Well, General, you have
got here without much difficulty, and with the applause of the people!  Do you remember what
you said to me in the Rue St. Anne nearly two years ago?"--"Ay, true enough, I recollect. 
You see what it is to have the mind set on a thing. Only two years have gone by!  Don't you
think we have not worked badly since that time?  Upon the whole I am very well content.  Yesterday
passed off well.  Do you imagine that all those who came to flatter me were sincere?  No, certainly
not: but the joy of the people was real. They know what is right.  Besides, consult the grand
thermometer of opinion, the price of the funds: on the 17th Brumaire at 11 francs, on the 20th
at 16 and to-day at 21.  In such a state of things I may let the Jacobins prate as they like.
But let them not talk too loudly either!"

As soon as he was dressed we went to look through the Gallery of Diana and examine the statues
which had been placed there by his orders.  We ended our morning's work by taking complete
possession of our new residence.  I recollect Bonaparte saying to me, among other things, "To
be at the Tuileries, Bourrienne, is not all.  We must stay here.  Who, in Heaven's name, has
not already inhabited this palace?  Ruffians, conventionalists!  But hold! there is your brother's
house!  Was it not from those windows I saw the Tuileries besieged, and the good Louis XVI.
carried off?  But be assured they will not come here again!"

The Ambassadors and other foreign Ministers then in Paris were presented to the First Consul
at a solemn audience.  On this occasion all the ancient ceremonials belonging to the French
Court were raked up, and in place of chamberlains and a grand master of ceremonies a Counsellor
of State, M. Benezech, who was once Minister for Foreign Affairs, officiated.

When the Ambassadors had all arrived M. Benezech conducted them into the cabinet, in which
were the three Consuls, the Ministers, and the Council of State.  The Ambassadors presented
their credentials to the First Consul, who handed them to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
These presentations were followed by others; for example, the Tribunal of Cassation, over which
the old advocate, Target, who refused to defend Louis XVI., then presided.  All this passed
in view of the three Consuls; but the circumstance which distinguished the First Consul from
his colleagues was, that the official personages, on leaving the audience- chamber, were conducted
to Madame Bonaparte's apartments, in imitation of the old practice of waiting on the Queen
after presentation to the King.

Thus old customs of royalty crept by degrees into the former abodes of royalty.  Amongst the
rights attached to the Crown, and which the Constitution of the year VIII. did not give to
the First Consul, was one which he much desired to possess, and which, by the most happy of
all usurpations, he arrogated to himself.  This was the right of granting pardon.  Bonaparte
felt a real pleasure in saving men under the sentence of the law; and whenever the imperious
necessity of his policy, to which, in truth, he sacrificed everything, permitted it, he rejoiced
in the exercise of mercy.  It would seem as if he were thankful to the persons to whom he rendered
such service merely because he had given them occasion to be thankful to him.  Such was the
First Consul: I do not speak of the Emperor.  Bonaparte, the First Consul, was accessible to
the solicitations of friendship in favour of persons placed under proscription.  The following
circumstance, which interested me much, affords an incontestable proof of what I state:--

Whilst we were still at the Luxembourg, M. Defeu, a French emigrant, was taken in the Tyrol
with arms in his hand by the troops of the Republic. He was carried to Grenoble, and thrown
into the military prison of that town.  In the course of January General Ferino, then commanding
at Grenoble, received orders to put the young emigrant on his trial.  The laws against emigrants
taken in arms were terrible, and the judges dared not be indulgent.  To be tried in the morning,
condemned in the course of the day, and shot in the evening, was the usual course of those
implacable proceedings.  One of my cousins, the daughter of M. Poitrincourt, came from Sens
to Paris to inform me of the dreadful situation of M. Defeu.  She told me that he was related
to the most respectable families of the town of Sens, and that everybody felt the greatest
interest in his fate.

I had escaped for a few moments to keep the appointment I made with Mademoiselle Poitrincourt.
On my return I perceived the First Consul surprised at finding himself alone in the cabinet,
which I was not in the habit of quitting without his knowledge.  "Where have you been?" said
he. "I have been to see one of my relations, who solicits & favour of you."-- "What is it?"
I then informed him of the unfortunate situation of M. Defeu.  His first answer was dreadful.
"No pity!  no pity for emigrants! Whoever fights against his country is a child who tries to
kill his mother!"  This first burst of anger being over, I returned to the charge. I urged
the youth of M. Defeu, and the good effect which clemency would produce.  "Well," said he, "write--

     "The First Consul orders the judgment on M. Defeu to be suspended."

He signed this laconic order, which I instantly despatched to General Ferino.  I acquainted
my cousin with what had passed, and remained at ease as to the result of the affair.

Scarcely had I entered the chamber of the First Consul the next morning when he said to me,
"Well, Bourrienne, you say nothing about your M. Defeu.  Are you satisfied?"--"General, I cannot
find terms to express my gratitude."--"Ah, bah!  But I do not like to do things by halves.
Write to Ferino that I wish M. Defeu to be instantly set at liberty.  Perhaps I am serving
one who will prove ungrateful.  Well, so much the worse for him.  As to these matters, Bourrienne,
always ask them from me.  When I refuse, it is because I cannot help it."

I despatched at my own expense an extraordinary courier, who arrived in time to save M. Defeu's
life.  His mother, whose only son he was, and M. Blanchet, his uncle, came purposely from Sens
to Paris to express their gratitude to me.  I saw tears of joy fall from the eyes of a mother
who had appeared to be destined to shed bitter drops, and I said to her as I felt, "that I
was amply recompensed by the success which had attended my efforts."

Emboldened by this success, and by the benevolent language of the First Consul, I ventured
to request the pardon of M. de Frotte, who was strongly recommended to me by most honourable
persons.  Comte Louis de Frotte had at first opposed all negotiation for the pacification of
La Vendee.  At length, by a series of unfortunate combats, he was, towards the end of January,
reduced to the necessity of making himself the advances which he had rejected when made by
others.  At this period he addressed a letter to General Guidal, in which he offered pacificatory
proposals.  A protection to enable him to repair to Alencon was transmitted to him.  Unfortunately
for M. de Frotte, he did not confine himself to writing to General Guidal, for whilst the safe-conduct
which he had asked was on the way to him, he wrote to his lieutenants, advising them not to
submit or consent to be disarmed.  This letter was intercepted.  It gave all the appearance
of a fraudulent stratagem to his proposal to treat for peace.  Besides, this opinion appeared
to be confirmed by a manifesto of M. de Frotte, anterior, it is true, to the offers of pacification,
but in which he announced to all his partisans the approaching end of Bonaparte's "criminal
enterprise."

I had more trouble than in M: Defeu's case to induce the First Consul to exercise his clemency.
However, I pressed him so much, I laboured so hard to convince him of the happy effect of such
indulgence, that at length I obtained an order to suspend the judgment.  What a lesson I then
experienced of the evil which may result from the loss of time!  Not supposing that matters
were so far advanced as they were, I did not immediately send off the courier with the order
for the suspension of the judgment.  Besides, the Minister-of-Police had marked his victim,
and he never lost time when evil was to be done.  Having, therefore, I know not for what motive,
resolved on the destruction of M. de Frotte, he sent an order to hasten his trial.

Comte Louis de Frotte was brought to trial on the 28th Pluviose, condemned the same day, and
executed the next morning, the day before we entered the Tuileries.  The cruel precipitation
of the Minister rendered the result of my solicitations abortive.  I had reason to think that
after the day on which the First Consul granted me the order for delay he had received some
new accusation against M. de Frotte, for when he heard of his death he appeared to me very
indifferent about the tardy arrival of the order for suspending judgment.  He merely said to
me, with unusual insensibility, "You should take your measures better.  You see it is not my
fault."

Though Bonaparte put no faith in the virtue of men, he had confidence in their honour.  I had
proof of this in a matter which deserves to be recorded in history.  When, during the first
period of our abode at the Tuileries, he had summoned the principal chiefs of, La Vendee to
endeavour to bring about the pacification of that unhappy country; he received Georges Cadoudal
in a private audience.  The disposition in which I beheld him the evening before the day appointed
for this audience inspired me with the most flattering hopes.  Rapp introduced Georges into
the grand salon looking into the garden.  Rapp left him alone with the First Consul, but on
returning to the cabinet where I was he did not close either of the two doors of the state
bedchamber which separated the cabinet from the salon.  We saw the First Consul and Georges
walk from the window to the bottom of the salon--then return--then go back again. This lasted
for a long time.  The conversation appeared very animated, and we heard several things, but
without any connection.  There was occasionally a good deal of ill-humour displayed in their
tone and gestures.  The interview ended in nothing.  The First Consul, perceiving that Georges
entertained some apprehensions for his personal safety, gave him assurances of security in
the most noble manner, saying, "You take a wrong view of things, and are wrong in not coming
to some understanding; but if you persist in wishing to return to your country you shall depart
as freely as you came to Paris."  When Bonaparte returned to his cabinet he said to Rapp, "Tell
me, Rapp, why you left these doors open, and stopped with Bourrienne?"  Rapp replied, "If you
had closed the doors I would have opened them again.  Do you think I would have left you alone
with a man like that?  There would have been danger in it."--"No, Rapp," said Bonaparte, "you
cannot think so."  When we were alone the First Consul appeared pleased with Rapp's attachment,
but very vexed at Georges' refusal.  He said, "He does not take a correct view of things; but
the extravagance of his principles has its source in noble sentiments, which must give him
great influence over his countrymen. It is necessary, however, to bring this business soon
to an end."

Of all the actions of Louis XIV. that which Bonaparte most admired was his having made the
Doge of Genoa send ambassadors to Paris to apologise to him.  The slightest insult offered
in a foreign country to the rights and dignity of France put Napoleon beside himself.  This
anxiety to have the French Government respected exhibited itself in an affair which made much
noise at the period, but which was amicably arranged by the soothing influence of gold.

Two Irishmen, Napper Tandy and Blackwell, who had been educated in France, and whose names
and rank as officers appeared in the French army list, had retired to Hamburg.  The British
Government claimed them as traitors to their country, and they were given up; but, as the French
Government held them to be subjects of France, the transaction gave rise to bitter complaints
against the Senate of Hamburg.

Blackwell had been one of the leaders of the united Irishmen.  He had procured his naturalisation
in France, and had attained the rank, of chef d'escadrou.  Being sent on a secret mission to
Norway, the ship in which he was embarked was wrecked on the coast of that kingdom.  He then
repaired to Hamburg, where the Senate placed him under arrest on the demand of Mr. Crawford,
the English Minister.  After being detained in prison a whole year he was conveyed to England
to be tried.  The French Government interfered, and preserved, if not, his liberty, at least
his life.

Napper Tandy was also an Irishman.  To escape the search made after him, on account of the
sentiments of independence which had induced him to engage in the contest for the liberty of
his country, he got on board a French brig, intending to land at Hamburg and pass into Sweden.
Being exempted from the amnesty by the Irish Parliament, he was claimed by the British Government,
and the Senators of Hamburg forgot honour and humanity in their alarm at the danger which at
that moment menaced their little republic both from England and France.  The Senate delivered
up Napper Tandy; he was carried to Ireland, and condemned to death, but owed the suspension
of his execution to the interference of France.  He remained two years in prison, when M. Otto,
who negotiated with Lord Hawkesbury the preliminaries of peace, obtained the release of Napper
Tandy, who was sent back to France.

The First Consul spoke at first of signal vengeance; but the Senate of Hamburg sent him a memorial,
justificatory of its conduct, and backed the apology with a sum of four millions and a half,
which mollified him considerably.  This was in some sort a recollection of Egypt--one of those
little contributions with which the General had familiarised the pashas; with this difference,
that on the present occasion not a single sous went into the national treasury.  The sum was
paid to the First Consul through the hands of M. Chapeau Rouge.

     --[A solemn deputation from the Senate arrived at the Tuileries to
     make public apologies to Napoleon.  He again testified his
     indignation: and when the envoys urged their weakness he said to
     them.  "Well and had you not the resource of weak states? was it not
     in your power to let them escape?" (Napoleon's Memoirs).]--

I kept the four millions and a half in Dutch bonds in a secretaire for a week.  Bonaparte then
determined to distribute them; after paying Josephine's debts, and the whole of the great expenses
incurred at Malmaison, he dictated to me a list of persons to whom he wished to make presents.
My name did not escape his lips, and consequently I had not the trouble to transcribe it; but
some time after he said to me, with the most engaging kindness, "Bourrienne, I have given you
none of the money which came from Hamburg, but I will make you amends for it."  He took from
his drawer a large and broad sheet of printed paper, with blanks filled up in his own handwriting,
and said to me, "Here is a bill for 300,000 Italian livres on the Cisalpine Republic, for the
price of cannon furnished.  It is endorsed Halter and Collot--I give it you."  To make this
understood, I ought to state that cannon had been sold to the Cisalpine.  Republic, for the
value of which the Administrator-general of the Italian finances drew on the Republic, and
the bills were paid over to M. Collot, a provision contractor, and other persons.  M. Collot
had given one of these bills for 300,000 livres to Bonaparte in quittance of a debt, but the
latter had allowed the bill to run out without troubling himself about it.  The Cisalpine Republic
kept the cannons and the money, and the First Consul kept his bill.  When I had examined it
I said, "General, it has been due for a long time; why have you not got it paid? The endorsers
are no longer liable."--"France is bound to discharge debts of this kind;" said he; "send the
paper to de Fermont: he will discount it for three per cent.  You will not have in ready money
more than about 9000 francs of renters, because the Italian livre is not equal to the franc."
I thanked him, and sent the bill to M. de Fermont.  He replied that the claim was bad, and
that the bill would not be liquidated because it did not come within the classifications made
by the laws passed in the months the names of which terminated in 'aire, ose, al, and or'.

I showed M. de Fermont's answer to the First Consul, who said, "Ah, bah! He understands nothing
about it--he is wrong: write."  He then dictated a letter, which promised very favourably for
the discounting of the bill; but the answer was a fresh refusal.  I said, "General, M. de Fermont
does not attend to you any more than to myself."  Bonaparte took the letter, read it, and said,
in the tone of a man who knew beforehand what he was about to be, informed of, "Well, what
the devil would you have me do, since the laws are opposed to it?  Persevere; follow the usual
modes of liquidation, and something will come of it!  "What finally happened was, that by a
regular decree this bill was cancelled, torn, and deposited in the archives.  These 300,000
livres formed part of the money which Bonaparte brought from Italy.  If the bill was useless
to me it was also useless to him.  This scrap of paper merely proves that be brought more.
than 25,000 francs from Italy.

I never had, from the General-in-Chief of the army of Italy, nor from the General in-Chief
of the army of, Egypt, nor from the First Consul, for ten years, nor from the Consul for life,
any fixed salary: I took from his drawer what was necessary for my expenses as well as his
own: He never asked me for any account.  After the transaction of the bill on the insolvent
Cisalpine Republic he said to me, at the beginning of the winter of 1800, "Bourrienne, the
weather, is becoming very bad; I will go but seldom to Malmaison.  Whilst I am at council get
my papers and little articles from Malmaison; here is the key of my secretaire, take out everything
that is there."  I, got into the carriage at two o'clock and returned at six.  When he had
dined I placed upon the table of his cabinet the various articles which I had found in his
secretaire including 15,000 francs (somewhere about L 600 of English money) in banknotes which
were in the corner of a little drawer.  When he looked at them he said, "Here is money--what
is the meaning of this?" I replied, "I know nothing about it, except that it was in your secretaire."--
"Oh yes; I had forgotten it.  It was for my trifling expenses.  Here, take it."  I remembered
well that one summer morning he had given me his key to bring him two notes of 1000 francs
for some incidental expense, but I had no idea that he had not drawn further on his little
treasure.

I have stated the appropriation of the four millions and a half, the result of the extortion
inflicted on the Senate of Hamburg, in the affair of Napper Tandy and Blackwell.

The whole, however, Was not disposed of in presents.  A considerable portion was reserved fob
paying Josephine's debts, and this business appears to me to deserve some remarks.

The estate of Malmaison had cost 160,000 francs.  Josephine had purchased it of M. Lecouteuix
while we were in Egypt.  Many embellishments, and some new buildings, had been made there;
and a park had been added, which had now become beautiful.  All this could not be done for
nothing, and besides, it was very necessary that what was due for the original purchase should
be entirely discharged; and this considerable item was not the only debt of Josephine.  The
creditors murmured, which had a bad effect in Paris; and I confess I was so well convinced
that the First Consul would be extremely displeased that I constantly delayed the moment of
speaking to him on the subject.  It was therefore with extreme satisfaction I learned that
M. de Talleyrand had anticipated me.  No person was more capable than himself of gilding the
pill, as one may say, to Bonaparte.  Endowed with as much independence of character as of mind,
he did him the service, at the risk of offending him, to tell him that a great number of creditors
expressed their discontent in bitter complaints respecting the debts contracted by Madame Bonaparte
during his expedition to the East.  Bonaparte felt that his situation required him promptly
to remove the cause of such complaints.  It was one night about half-past eleven o'clock that
M. Talleyrand introduced this delicate subject.  As soon he was gone I entered the little cabinet;
Bonaparte said to me, "Bourrienne, Talleyrand has been speaking to me about the debts of my
Wife.  I have the money from Hamburg--ask her the exact amount of her debts: let her confess
all. I wish to finish, and not begin again.  But do not pay without showing me the bills of
those rascals: they are a gang of robbers."

Hitherto the apprehension of an unpleasant scene, the very idea of which made Josephine tremble,
had always prevented me from broaching this subject to the First Consul; but, well pleased
that Talleyrand had first touched upon it, I resolved to do all in my power to put an end to
the disagreeable affair.

The next morning I saw Josephine.  She was at first delighted with her husband's intentions;
but this feeling did not last long.  When I asked her for an exact account of what she owed
she entreated me not to press it, but content myself with what she should confess.  I said
to her, "Madame, I cannot deceive you respecting the disposition of the First Consul.  He believes
that you owe a considerable sum, and is willing to discharge it.  You will, I doubt not, have
to endure some bitter reproaches, and a violent scene; but the scene will be just the same
for the whole as for a part.  If you conceal a large proportion of your debts at the end of
some time murmurs will recommence, they will reach the ears of the First Consul, and his anger
will display itself still more strikingly.  Trust to me--state all; the result will be the
same; you will hear but once the disagreeable things he will say to you; by reservations you
will renew them incessantly."  Josephine said, "I can never tell all; it is impossible.  Do
me the service to keep secret what I say to you.  I owe, I believe, about 1,200,000 francs,
but I wish to confess only 600,000; I will contract no more debts, and will pay the rest little
by little out of my savings."--"Here, Madame, my first observations recur.  As I do not believe
he estimates your debts at so high a sum as 600,000 francs, I can warrant that you will not
experience more displeasure for acknowledging to 1,200,000 than to 600,000; and by going so
far you will get rid of them for ever."--"I can never do it, Bourrienne; I know him; I can
never support his violence."  After a quarter of an hour's further discussion on the subject
I was obliged to yield to her earnest solicitation, and promise to mention only the 600,000
francs to the First Consul.

The anger and ill-humour of Bonaparte may be imagined.  He strongly suspected that his wife
was dissembling in some respect; but he said, "Well, take 600,000 francs, but liquidate the
debts for that sum, and let me hear nothing more on the subject.  I authorise you to threaten
these tradesmen with paying nothing if they, do not reduce their enormous charges.  They ought
to be taught not to be so ready in giving credit." Madame Bonaparte gave me all her bills.
The extent to which the articles had been overcharged, owing to the fear of not being paid
for a long period, and of deductions being made from the amount, was inconceivable. It appeared
to me, also, that there must be some exaggeration in the number of articles supplied.  I observed
in the milliner's bill thirty- eight new hats, of great price, in one month.  There was likewise
a charge of 1800 francs for heron plumes, and 800 francs for perfumes. I asked Josephine whether
she wore out two hats in one day?  She objected to this charge for the hats, which she merely
called a mistake.  The impositions which the saddler attempted, both in the extravagance of
his prices and in charging for articles which he had not furnished, were astonishing.  I need
say nothing of the other tradesmen, it was the same system of plunder throughout.

I availed myself fully of the First Consul's permission, and spared neither reproaches nor
menaces.  I am ashamed to say that the greater part of the tradesmen were contented with the
half of what they demanded. One of them received 35,000 francs for a bill of 80,000; and he
had the impudence to tell me that he made a good profit nevertheless.  Finally, I was fortunate
enough, after the most vehement disputes, to settle everything for 600,000 francs.  Madame
Bonaparte, however, soon fell again into the same excesses, but fortunately money became more
plentiful.  This inconceivable mania of spending money was almost the sole cause of her unhappiness.
Her thoughtless provusion occasioned permanent disorder in her household until the period of
Bonaparte's second marriage, when, I am informed, she became regular in her expenditure.  I
could not say so of her when she was Empress in 1804.

     --[Notwithstanding her husband's wish, she could never bring her
     establishment into any order or rule.  He wished that no tradesmen
     should ever reach her, but he was forced to yield on this point.
     The small inner roams were filled with them, as with artists of all
     sorts.  She had a mania for having herself painted, and gave her
     portraits to whoever wished for one, relations, 'femmes de chambre',
     even to tradesmen.  They never ceased bringing her diamonds, jewels,
     shawls, materials for dresses, and trinkets of all kinds; she bought
     everything without ever asking the price; and generally forgot what
     she had purchased.  .  .  All the morning she had on a shawl which
     she draped on her shoulders with a grace I have seen in no one else.
     Bonaparte, who thought her shawls covered her too much, tore them
     off, and sometimes threw them into the fire; then she sent for
     another (Remusat, tome ii.  pp. 343-345).  After the divorce her
     income, large as it was, was insufficient, but the Emperor was more
     compassionate then, and when sending the Comte Mollien to settle her
     affairs gave him strict orders "not to make her weep" (Meneval,
     tome iii. p.237]--

The amiable Josephine had not less ambition in little thins than her husband had in great.
She felt pleasure in acquiring and not in possessing.  Who would suppose it?  She grew tired
of the beauty of the park of Malmaison, and was always asking me to take her out on the high
road, either in the direction of Nanterre, or on that of Marly, in the midst of the dust occasioned
by the passing of carriages.  The noise of the high road appeared to her preferable to the
calm silence of the beautiful avenues of the park, and in this respect Hortense had the same
taste as her mother.  This whimsical fancy astonished Bonaparte, and he was sometimes vexed
at it.  My intercourse with Josephine was delightful; for I never saw a woman who so constantly
entered society with such an equable disposition, or with so much of the spirit of kindness,
which is the first principle of amiability.  She was so obligingly attentive as to cause a
pretty suite of apartments to be prepared at Malmaison for me and my family.

She pressed me earnestly, and with all her known grace, to accept it; but almost as much a
captive at Paris as a prisoner of state, I wished to have to myself in the country the moments
of liberty I was permitted to enjoy.  Yet what was this liberty?  I had bought a little house
at Ruel, which I kept during two years and a half.  When I saw my friends there, it had to
be at midnight, of at five o'clock in the morning; and the First Consul would often send for
me in the night when couriers arrived. It was for this sort of liberty I refused Josephine's
kind offer. Bonaparte came once to see me in my retreat at Ruel, but Josephine and Hortense
came often: It was a favourite walk with these ladies.

At Paris I was less frequently absent from Bonaparte than at Malmaison. We sometimes in the
evening walked together in the garden of the Tuileries after the gates were closed.  In these
evening walks he always wore a gray greatcoat, and a round hat.  I was directed to answer,
"The First Consul," to the sentinel's challenge of, "Who goes there?" These promenades, which
were of much benefit to Bonaparte, and me also, as a relaxation from our labours, resembled
those which we had at Malmaison.  As to our promenades in the city, they were often very amusing.

At the period of our first inhabiting the Tuileries, when I saw Bonaparte enter the cabinet
at eight o'clock in the evening in his gray coat, I knew he would say, "Bourrienne, come and
take a turn."  Sometimes, then, instead of going out by the garden arcade, we would take the
little gate which leads from the court to the apartments of the Due d'Angouleme.  He would
take my arm, and we would go to buy articles of trifling value in the shops of the Rue St.
Honore; but we did not extend our excursions farther than Rue de l'Arbre Sec.  Whilst I made
the shopkeeper exhibit before us the articles which I appeared anxious to buy he played his
part in asking questions.

Nothing was more amusing than to see him endeavouring to imitate the careless and jocular tone
of the young men of fashion.  How awkward was he in the attempt to put on dandy airs when pulling
up the corners of his cravat he would say, "Well, Madame, is there anything new to-day? Citizen,
what say they of Bonaparte?  Your shop appears to be well supplied.  You surely have a great
deal of custom.  What do people say of that buffoon; Bonaparte?"  He was made quite happy one
day when we were obliged to retire hastily from a shop to avoid the attacks drawn upon us by
the irreverent tone in which Bonaparte spoke of the First Consul.

CHAPTER XXXIV.

1800.

     War and monuments--Influence of the recollections of Egypt--
     First improvements in Paris--Malmaison too little--St. Cloud taken
     --The Pont des Arts--Business prescribed for me by Bonaparte--
     Pecuniary remuneration--The First Consul's visit to the Pritanee--
     His examination of the pupils--Consular pensions--Tragical death of
     Miackzinski--Introduction of vaccination--Recall of the members of
     the Constituent Assembly--The "canary" volunteers--Tronchet and
     Target--Liberation of the Austrian prisoners--Longchamps and sacred
     music.

The destruction of men and the construction of monuments were two things perfectly in unison
in the mind of Bonaparte.  It may be said that his passion for monuments almost equalled his
passion for war;

     --[Take pleasure, if you can, in reading your returns.  The good
     condition of my armies is owing to my devoting to them one or two
     hours in every day.  When the monthly returns of my armies and of my
     fleets, which form twenty thick volumes, are sent to me.  The sight of the colossal ruins of
the monuments of Egypt had not a little contributed to augment his
natural taste for great structures.  It was not so much the monuments
themselves that he admired, but the historical recollections they
perpetuate the great names they consecrate, the important events they
attest. What should he have cared for the column which we beheld on our
arrival in Alexandria had it not been Pompey's pillar?  It is for artists
to admire or censure its proportions and ornaments, for men of learning
to explain its inscriptions; but the name of Pompey renders it an object
of interest to all.

When endeavouring to sketch the character of Bonaparte, I ought to have noticed his taste for
monuments, for without this characteristic trait something essential is wanting to the completion
of the portrait.  This taste, or, as it may more properly be called, this passion for monuments,
exercised no small influence on his thoughts and projects of glory; yet it did not deter him
from directing attention to public improvements; of a less ostentatious kind.  He wished for
great monuments to perpetuate the recollection of his glory; but at the same time he knew how
to appreciate all that was truly useful.  He could very rarely be reproached for rejecting
any plan without examination; and this examination was a speedy affair, for his natural tact
enabled him immediately to see things in their proper light.

Though most of the monuments and embellishments of Paris are executed from the plans of men
of talent, yet some owe their origin to circumstances merely accidental.  Of this I can mention
an example.

I was standing at the window of Bonaparte's' cabinet, which looked into the garden of the Tuileries.
He had gone out, and I took advantage of his absence to arise from my chair, for I was tired
of sitting.  He had scarcely been gone a minute when he unexpectedly returned to ask me for
a paper.  "What are you doing there, Bourrienne?  I'll wager anything you are admiring the
ladies walking on the terrace."--"Why, I must confess I do sometimes amuse myself in that way,"
replied I; "but I assure you, General, I was now thinking of something else.  I was looking
at that villainous left bank of the Seine, which always annoys me with the gaps in its dirty
quay, and the floodings which almost every winter prevent communication with the Faubourg St.
Germain; and I was thinking I would speak to you on the subject."  He approached the window,
and, looking out, said, "You are right, it is very ugly; and very offensive to see dirty linen
washed before our windows.  Here, write immediately: 'The quay of the Ecole de Natation is
to. be finished during next campaign.' Send that order to the Minister of the Interior."  The
quay was finished the year following.

An instance of the enormous difference which frequently appears between the original estimates
of architects and their subsequent accounts I may mention what occurred in relation to the
Palace of St. Cloud.  But I must first say a word about the manner in which Bonaparte originally
refused and afterwards took possession of the Queen's pleasure-house.  Malmaison was a suitable
country residence for Bonaparte as long as he remained content with his town apartments in
the little Luxembourg; but that Consular 'bagatelle' was too confined in comparison with the
spacious apartments in the Tuileries.  The inhabitants of St. Cloud, well-advised, addressed
a petition to the Legislative Body, praying that their deserted chateau might be made the summer
residence of the First Consul.  The petition was referred to the Government; but Bonaparte,
who was not yet Consul for life, proudly declared that so long as he was at the head of affairs,
and, indeed, for a year afterwards, he would accept no national recompense.  Sometime after
we went to visit the palace of the 18th Brumaire.  Bonaparte liked it exceedingly, but all
was in a, state of complete dilapidation.  It bore evident marks of the Revolution.  The First
Consul did not wish, as yet, to burden the budget of the State with his personal expenses,
and he was alarmed at the enormous sum required to render St. Cloud habitable.  Flattery had
not yet arrived at the degree of proficiency which it subsequently attained; but even then
his flatterers boldly assured him he might take possession of St. Cloud for 25,000 francs.
I told the First Consul that considering the ruinous state of the place, I could to say that
the expense would amount to more than 1,200,000 francs.  Bonaparte determined to have a regular
estimate of the expense, and it amounted to nearly 3,000,000.  He thought it a great sum; but
as he had resolved to make St. Cloud his residence he gave orders for commencing the repairs,
the expense of which, independently of the furniture, amounted to 6,000,000.  So much for the
3,000,000 of the architect and the 25,000 francs of the flatterers.

When the First Consul contemplated the building of the Pont des Arts we had a long conversation
on the subject.  I observed that it would be much better to build the bridge of stone.  "The
first object of monuments of this kind," said I, "is public utility.  They require solidity
of appearance, and their principal merit is duration.  I cannot conceive, General, why, in
a country where there is abundance of fine stone of every quality, the use of iron should be
preferred."--"Write," said Bonaparte, "to Fontaine and Percier, the architects, and ask what
they think of it."  I wrote and they stated in their answer that "bridges were intended for
public utility and the embellishment of cities.  The projected bridge between the Louvre and
the Quatre-Nations would unquestionably fulfil the first of these objects, as was proved by
the great number of persons who daily crossed the Seine at that point in boats; that the site
fixed upon between the Pont Neuf and the Tuileries appeared to be the best that could be chosen
for the purpose; and that on the score of ornament Paris would gain little by the construction
of an iron bridge, which would be very narrow, and which, from its light form, would not correspond
with the grandeur of the two bridges between which it would be placed."

When we had received the answer of MM. Percier and Fontaine, we again had a conversation on
the subject of the bridge.  I told the First Consul that I perfectly concurred in the opinion
of MM. Fontame and Percier; how ever, he would have his own way, and thus was authorised the
construction of the toy which formed a communication between the Louvre and the Institute.
But no sooner was the Pont des Arts finished than Bonaparte pronounced it to be mean and out
of keeping with the other bridges above and below it.  One day when visiting the Louvre he
stopped at one of the windows looking towards the Pout des Arts and said, "There is no solidity,
no grandeur about that bridge.  In England, where stone is scarce, it is very natural that
iron should be used for arches of large dimensions.  But the case is different in France, where
the requisite material is abundant."

The infernal machine of the 3d Nivose, of which I shall presently speak more at length, was
the signal for vast changes in the quarter of the Tuileries.  That horrible attempt was at
least so far attended by happy results that it contributed to the embellishment of Paris. 
It was thought more advisable for the Government to buy and pull down the houses which had
been injured by the machine than to let them be put under repair.  As an example of Bonaparte's
grand schemes in building I may mention that, being one day at the Louvre, he pointed towards
St. Germain l'Auxerrois and said to me, "That is where I will build an imperial street.  It
shall run from here to the Barriere du Trone.  It shall be a hundred feet broad, and have arcades
and plantations.  This street shall be the finest in the world."

The palace of the King of Rome, which was to face the Pont de Jena and the Champ de Mars, would
have been in some measure isolated from Paris, with which, however, it was to be connected
by a line of palaces.  These were to extend along the quay, and were destined as splendid residences
for the Ambassadors of foreign sovereigns, at least as long as there should be any sovereigns
Europe except Napoleon.  The Temple of Glory, too, which was to occupy the site of the Church
of la Madeleine, was never finished.  If the plan of this monument, proved the necessity. which
Bonaparte felt of constantly holding out stimulants to his soldiers, its relinquishment was
at least a proof of his wisdom.  He who had reestablished religious worship in France, and
had restored to its destination the church of the Invalides, which was for a time metamorphosed
into the Temple of Mars, foresaw that a Temple of Glory would give birth to a sort of paganism
incompatible with the ideas of the age.

The recollection of the magnificent Necropolis of Cairo frequently recurred to.  Bonaparte's
mind.  He had admired that city of the dead, which he had partly contributed to people; and
his design was to make, at, the four cardinal points of Paris, four vast cemeteries on the
plan of that at Cairo.

Bonaparte determined that all the new streets of Paris should be 40 feet wide, and be provided
with foot-pavements; in short, he thought nothing too grand for the embellishment of the capital
of a country which he wished to make the first in the world.  Next to war, he regard the embellishment
of Paris as the source of his glory; and he never considered a victory fully achieved until
he had raised a monument to transmit its memory to posterity.  He, wanted glory, uninterrupted
glory, for France as well as for himself: How often, when talking over his schemes, has he
not said, "Bourrienne, it is for France I am doing all this!  All I wish, all I desire, the
end of all my labours is, that my name should be indissolubly connected with that of France!"

Paris is not the only city, nor is France the only kingdom, which bears traces of Napoleon's
passion for great and useful monuments.  In Belgium, in Holland, in Piedmont, in all Italy,
he executed great improvements. At Turin a splendid bridge was built over the Po, in lieu of
an old bridge which was falling in ruins.

How many things were undertaken and executed in Napoleon s short and eventful reign!  To obviate
the difficulty of communication between Metz and Mayence a magnificent road was made, as if
by magic, across impracticable marshes and vast forests.  Mountains were cut through and ravines
filled up.  He would not allow nature more than man to resist him.  One day when be was proceeding
to Belgium by the way of Civet, he was detained for a short time at Little Givet, on the right
bank of the Meuse, in consequence of an accident which happened to the ferry-boat. He was within
a gunshot of the fortress of Charlemont, on the left bank, and in the vexation which the delay
occasioned he dictated the following decree: "A bridge shall be built over the Meuse to join
Little Civet to Great Givet.  It shall be terminated during the ensuing campaign."  It was
completed within the prescribed time: In the great work of bridges and highways Bonaparte's
chief object was to remove the obstacles and barriers which nature had raised up as the limits
of old France so as to form a junction with the provinces which he successively annexed to
the Empire.  Thus in Savoy a road, smooth as a garden-walk, superseded the dangerous ascents
and descents of the wood of Bramant; thus was the passage of Mont Cenis a pleasant promenade
at almost every season of the year; thus did the Simplon bow his head, and Bonaparte might
have said, "There are now my Alps," with more reason than Louis XIV. said, "There are now no
Pyrenees."

     --[Metternich (tome iv.  p.  187) says on this subject, 'If you look
     closely at the course of human affairs you will make strange
     discoveries.  For instance, that the Simplon Pass has contributed as
     surely to Napoleon's immortality as the numerous works done in the
     reign of the Emperor Francis will fail to add to his.]--

Such was the implicit confidence which Bonaparte reposed in me that I was often alarmed at
the responsibility it obliged me to incur.

     --[Of this confidence the following instructions for me, which he
     dictated to Duroc, afford sufficient proof:--

     "1st.  Citizen Bourrienne shall open all the letters addressed to
     the First Consul, Vol, and present them to him three times a day, or
     oftener in case of urgent business.  The letters shall be deposited
     in the cabinet when they are opened.  Bourrienne is to analyse all
     those which are of secondary interest, and write the First Consul's
     decision on each letter.  The hours for presenting the letters shall
     be, first, when the Consul rises; second, a quarter of an hour
     before dinner; and third, at eleven at night.

     "2d.  He is to have the superintendence of the Topographical office,
     and of an office of Translation, in which there shall be a German
     and an English clerk.  Every day he shall present to the First
     Consul, at the hours above mentioned the German and English
     journals, together with a translation.  With respect to the Italian
     journals, it will only be necessary to mark what the First Consul is
     to read.

     "3d.  He shall keep a register of appointments to offices under
     Government; a second, for appointments to judicial posts; a third
     for appointments to places abroad; and a fourth, for the situations
     of receivers and great financial posts, where he is to inscribe the
     names of all the individuals whom the First Consul may refer to him.
     These registers must be written by his own hand, and must be kept
     entirely private.

     "4th.  Secret correspondence, and the different reports of
     surveillance, are to be addressed directly to Bourrienne, and
     transmitted by him to the hand of the First Consul, by whom they
     will be returned without the intervention of any third party.

     "6th.  There shall be a register for all that relates to secret
     extraordinary expenditure.  Bourrienne shall write the whole with
     his own hand, in order that the business may be kept from the
     knowledge of any one.

     "7th.  He shall despatch all the business which maybe referred to
     him, either from Citizen Duroc, or from the cabinet of the First
     Consul, taking care to arrange everything so as to secure secrecy.

                                   "(Signed) "BONAPARTE, First Council.

     "Paris, 13th Germinal, year VIII.
     "(3d.  April 1800.)"]--

Official business was not the only labour that devolved upon me.  I had to write to the dictation
of the First Consul during a great part of the day, or to decipher his writing, which was always
the most laborious part of my duty.  I was so closely employed that I scarcely ever went out;
and when by chance I dined in town, I could not arrive until the very moment of dinner, and
I was obliged to run away immediately after it.  Once a month, at most, I went without Bonaparte
to the Comedie Francaise, but I was obliged to return at nine o'clock, that being the hour
at which we resumed business.  Corvisart, with whom I was intimately acquainted, constantly
expressed his apprehensions about my health; but my zeal carried me through every difficulty,
and during our stay at the Tuileries I cannot express how happy I was in enjoying the unreserved
confidence of the man on whom the eyes of all Europe were filed.  So perfect was this confidence
that Bonaparte, neither as General, Consul, nor Emperor, ever gave me any fixed salary.  In
money matters we were still comrades: I took from his funds what was necessary to defray my
expenses, and of this Bonaparte never once asked me for any account.

He often mentioned his wish to regenerate public education, which he thought was ill managed.
The central schools did not please him; but he could not withhold his admiration from the Polytechnic
School, the finest establishment of education that was ever founded, but which he afterwards
spoiled by giving it a military organisation.  In only one college of Paris the old system
of study was preserved: this was the Louis-le-Grand, which had received the name of Pritanee.
The First Consul directed the Minister of the Interior to draw up a report on that establishment;
and he himself went to pay an unexpected visit to the Pritanee, accompanied by M. Lebrun and
Duroc.  He remained there upwards of an hour, and in the evening he spoke to me with much interest
on the subject of his visit. "Do you know, Bourrienne," said he, "that I have been performing
the duties of professor?"--"you, General!"--"Yes! and I did not acquit myself badly.  I examined
the pupils in the mathematical class; and I recollected enough of my Bezout to make some demonstrations
before them. I went everywhere, into the bedrooms and the dining-room.  I tasted the soup,
which is better than we used to have at Brienne.  I must devote serious attention to public
education and the management of the colleges. The pupils must have a uniform.  I observed some
well and others ill dressed.  That will not do.  At college, above all places, there should
be equality.  But I was much pleased with the pupils of the Pritanee. I wish to know the names
of those I examined, and I have desired Duroc to report them to me.  I will give them rewards;
that stimulates young people.  I will provide for some of them."

On this subject Bonaparte did not confine himself to an empty scheme. After consulting with
the headmaster of the Pritanee, he granted pensions of 200 francs to seven or eight of the
most distinguished pupils of the establishment, and he placed three of them in the department
of Foreign Affairs, under the title of diplomatic pupils.

     --[This institution of diplomatic pupils was originally suggested by
     M. de Talleyrand.]--

What I have just said respecting the First Consul's visit to the Pritanee reminds me of a very
extraordinary circumstance which arose out of it. Among the pupils at the Pritanee there was
a son of General Miackzinski, who died fighting under the banners of the Republic.  Young Miackzinski
was then sixteen or seventeen years of age.  He soon quitted the college, entered the army
as a volunteer, and was one of a corps reviewed by Bonaparte, in the plain of Sablons.  He
was pointed out to the First Consul, who said to him.  "I knew your father.  Follow his example,
and in six months you shall be an officer."  Six months elapsed, and Miackzinski wrote to the
First Consul, reminding him of his promise.  No answer was returned, and the young man then
wrote a second letter as follows:

     You desired me to prove myself worthy of my father; I have done so.
     You promised that I should be an officer in six months; seven have
     elapsed since that promise was made.  When you receive this letter I
     shall be no more.  I cannot live under a Government the head of
     which breaks his word.

Poor Miackzinski kept his word but, too faithfully.  After writing the above letter to the
First Consul he retired to his chamber and blew out his brains with a pistol.  A few days after
this tragical event Miackzinski's commission was transmitted to his corps, for Bonaparte had
not forgotten him.  A delay in the War Office had caused the death of this promising young
man Bonaparte was much affected at the circumstance, and he said to me, "These Poles have such
refined notions of honour.... Poor Sulkowski, I am sure, would have done the same."

At the commencement of the Consulate it was gratifying, to see how actively Bonaparte was seconded
in the execution of plans for the social regeneration of France all seemed animated with new
life, and every one strove to do good as if it were a matter of competition.

Every circumstance concurred to favour the good intentions of the First Consul.  Vaccination,
which, perhaps, has saved as many lives as war has sacrificed, was introduced into France by
M. d Liancourt; and Bonaparte, immediately appreciating the 'value of such a discovery, gave
it his decided approbation.  At the same time a council of Prizes was established, and the
old members of the Constituent Assembly were invited to return to France.  It was for their
sake and that of the Royalists that the First Consul recalled them, but it was to please the
Jacobins, whom he was endeavouring to conciliate, that their return was subject to restrictions.
At first the invitation to return to France extended only to those who could prove that they
had voted in favour of the abolition of nobility.  The lists of emigrants were closed, and
committees were appointed to investigate their claims to the privilege of returning.

From the commencement of the month of Germinal the reorganisation of the army of Italy had
proceeded with renewed activity.  The presence in Paris of the fine corps of the Consular Guard,
added to the desire of showing themselves off in gay uniforms, had stimulated the military
ardour of many respectable young men of the capital.  Taking advantage of this circumstance
the First Consul created a corps of volunteers destined for the army of reserve, which was
to remain at Dijon.  He saw the advantage of connecting a great number of families with his
cause, and imbuing them with the spirit of the army.  This volunteer corps wore a yellow uniform
which, in some of the salons of Paris where it was still the custom to ridicule everything,
obtained for them the nickname of "canaries." Bonaparte, who did not always relish a joke,
took this in very ill part, and often expressed to me his vexation at it.  However, he was
gratified to observe in the composition of this corps a first specimen of privileged soldiers;
an idea which he acted upon when he created the orderly gendarmes in the campaign of Jena,
and when he organised the guards of honour after the disasters of Moscow.

In every action of his life Bonaparte had some particular object in view. I recollect his saying
to me one day, "Bourrienne, I cannot yet venture to do anything against the regicides; but
I will let them see what I think of them.  To-morrow I shall have some business with Abrial
respecting the organisation of the court of Cassation.  Target, who is the president of that
court, would not defend Louis XVI.  Well, whom do you think I mean to appoint in his place?
.  .  .  Tronchet, who did defend the king.  They may say what they please; I care not."

     --[On this, as on many other occasions, the cynicism of Bonaparte's
     language does, not admit of a literal translation.]--

Tronchet was appointed.

Nearly about the same time the First Consul, being informed of the escape of General Mack,
said to me, "Mack may go where he pleases; I am not afraid of him.  But I will tell you what
I have been thinking.  There are some other Austrian officers who were prisoners with Mack;
among the number is a Count Dietrichstein, who belongs to a great family in Vienna. I will
liberate them all.  At the moment of opening a campaign this will have a good effect.  They
will see that I fear nothing; and who knows but this may procure me some admirers in Austria."
The order for liberating the Austrian prisoners was immediately despatched.  Thus Bonaparte's
acts of generosity, as well as his acts of severity and his choice of individuals, were all
the result of deep calculation.

This unvarying attention to the affairs of the Government was manifest in all he did.  I have
already mentioned the almost simultaneous suppression of the horrible commemoration of the
month of January, and the permission for the revival of the opera balls.  A measure something
similar to this was the authorisation of the festivals of Longchamps, which had been forgotten
since the Revolution.  He at the same time gave permission for sacred music to be performed
at the opera.  Thus, while in public acts he maintained the observance of the Republican calendar,
he was gradually reviving the old calendar by seasons of festivity.  Shrove-Tuesday was marked
by a ball, and Passion-week by promenades and concerts.

CHAPTER XXXV

1800.

     The Memorial of St. Helena--Louis XVIII.'s first letter to Bonaparte
     --Josephine, Hortense, and the Faubourg St. Germain--
     Madame Bonaparte and the fortune-teller--Louis XVIII's second letter
     --Bonaparte's answer--Conversation respecting the recall of Louis
     XVIII.--Peace and war--A battle fought with pins-Genoa and Melas--
     Realisation of Bonaparte's military plans--Ironical letter to
     Berthier--Departure from Paris--Instructions to Lucien and
     Cambaceres--Joseph Bonaparte appointed Councillor of State--
     Travelling conversation--Alexander and Caesar judged by Bonaparte.

It sometimes happens that an event which passes away unnoticed at the time of its occurrence
acquires importance from events which subsequently ensue.  This reflection naturally occurs
to my mind now that I am about to notice the correspondence which passed between Louis XVIII.
and the First Consul.  This is certainly not one of the least interesting passages in the life
of Bonaparte.

But I must first beg leave to make an observation on the 'Memorial of St. Helena.'  That publication
relates what Bonaparte said respecting the negotiations between Louis XVIII. and himself; and
I find it necessary to quote a few lines on the subject, in order to show how far the statements
contained in the Memorial differ from the autograph letters in my possession.

At St. Helena Napoleon said that he never thought of the princes of the House of Bourbon. 
This is true to a certain point.  He did not think of the princes of the House of Bourbon with
the view of restoring them to their throne; but it has been shown, in several parts of these
Memoirs, that he thought of them very often, and on more than one occasion their very names
alarmed him.

     --[The Memorial states that "A letter was delivered to the First
     Consul by Lebrun who received it from the Abbe de Montesquieu, the
     secret agent of the Bourbons in Paris."  This letter which was very
     cautiously written, said:--

     "You are long delaying the restoration of my throne.  It is to be
     feared you are suffering favourable moments to escape.  You cannot
     secure the happiness of France without me, and I can do nothing for
     France without you.  Hasten, then, to name the offices which you
     would choose for your friends."

     The answer, Napoleon said, was as follows:--

     "I have received your royal highness' letter.  I have always taken a
     lively interest in your misfortunes, and those of your family.  You
     must not think of appearing in France; you could only return here by
     trampling over a hundred thousand dead bodies.  I shall always be
     happy to do anything that can alleviate your fate and help to banish
     the recollection of your misfortunes."--Bourrienne.]--

The substance of the two letters given in the 'Memorial of St. Helena' is correct.  The ideas
are nearly the same as those of the original letters. But it is not surprising that, after
the lapse of so long an interval, Napoleon's memory should somewhat have failed him.  However,
it will not, I presume, be deemed unimportant if I present to the reader literal copies of
this correspondence; together with the explanation of some curious circumstances connected with it.

The following is Louis XVIII's letter:--

                                             February 20,1800.

     SIR--Whatever may be their apparent conduct, men like you never
     inspire alarm.  You have accepted an eminent station, and I thank
     you for having done so.  You know better than any one how much
     strength and power are requisite to secure the happiness of a great
     nation.  Save France from her own violence, and you will fulfil the
     first wish of my heart.  Restore her King to her, and future
     generations will bless your memory.  You will always be too
     necessary to the State for me ever to be able to discharge, by
     important appointments, the debt of my family and myself.

                                             (Signed) Louis.

The First Consul was much agitated on the reception of this letter. Though he every day declared
his determination to have nothing to do with the Princes, yet he hesitated whether or no he
should reply to this overture.  The numerous affairs which then occupied his mind favoured
this hesitation.  Josephine and Hortense conjured him to hold out hope to the King, as by so
doing he would in no way pledge himself, and would gain time to ascertain whether he could
not ultimately play a far greater part than that of Monk.  Their entreaties became so urgent
that he said to me, "These devils of women are mad!  The Faubourg St. Germain has turned their
heads!  They make the Faubourg the guardian angel of the royalists; but I care not; I will
have nothing to do with them."

Madame Bonaparte said she was anxious he should adopt the step she proposed in order to banish
from his mind all thought of making himself King.  This idea always gave rise to a painful
foreboding which she could never overcome.

In the First Consul's numerous conversations with me he discussed with admirable sagacity Louis
XVIII.'s proposition and its consequences. "The partisans of the Bourbons," said he, "are deceived
if they suppose I am the man to play Monk's part."  Here the matter rested, and the King's
letter remained on the table.  In the interim Louis XVIII. wrote a second letter, without any
date.  It was as follows:

     You must have long since been convinced, General, that you possess
     my esteem.  If you doubt my gratitude, fix your reward and mark out
     the fortune of your friends.  As to my principles, I am a Frenchman,
     merciful by character, and also by the dictates of reason.

     No, the victor of Lodi, Castiglione, and Arcola, the conqueror of
     Italy and Egypt, cannot prefer vain celebrity to real glory.  But
     you are losing precious time.  We may ensure the glory of France.

     I say we, because I require the aid of Bonaparte, and he can do
     nothing without me.

     General, Europe observes you.  Glory awaits you, and I am impatient
     to restore peace to my people.
                                        (Signed) LOUIS.

This dignified letter the First Consul suffered to remain unanswered for several weeks; at
length he proposed to dictate an answer to me.  I observed, that as the King's letters were
autographs, it would be more proper that he should write himself.  He then wrote with his own
hand the following:

     Sir--I have received your letter, and I thank you for the
     compliments you address to me.

     You must not seek to return to France.  To do so you must trample
     over a hundred thousand dead bodies.

     Sacrifice your interest to the repose and happiness of France, and
     history will render you justice.

     I am not insensible to the misfortunes of your family.  I shall
     learn with pleasure, and shall willingly contribute to ensure, the
     tranquillity of your retirement.
                                        (Signed) BONAPARTE.

He showed me this letter, saying, "What do you think of it? is it not good?  "He was never
offended when I pointed out to him an error of grammar or style, and I therefore replied, "As
to the substance, if such be your resolution, I have nothing to say against it; but," added
I, "I must make one observation on the style.  You cannot say that you shall learn with pleasure
to ensure, etc."  On reading the passage over again he thought he had pledged himself too far
in saying that he would willingly contribute, etc.  He therefore scored out the last sentence,
and interlined, "I shall contribute with pleasure to the happiness and tranquillity of your
retirement."

The answer thus scored and interlined could not be sent off, and it lay on the table with Bonaparte's
signature affixed to it.

Some time after he wrote another answer, the three first paragraphs of which were exactly alike
that first quoted; but far the last paragraph he substituted the following

     "I am not insensible to the misfortunes of your family; and I shall
     learn with pleasure that you are surrounded with all that can
     contribute to the tranquillity of your retirement."

By this means he did not pledge himself in any way, not even in words, for he himself made
no offer of contributing, to the tranquillity of the retirement.  Every day which augmented
his power and consolidated his position diminished, he thought, the chances of the Bourbons;
and seven months were suffered to intervene between the date of the King's first letter and
the answer of the First Consul, which was written on the 2d Vendemiaire, year IX.  (24th September
1800) just when the Congress of Luneville was on the point of opening.

Soma days after the receipt of Louis XVIII.'s letter we were walking in the gardens of Malmaison;
he was in good humour, for everything was going on to his mind.  "Has my wife been saying anything
more to you about the Bourbons?" said he.--"No, General."--"But when you converse with her
you concur a little in her opinions.  Tell me why you wish the Bourbons back? You have no interest
in their return, nothing to expect from them.  Your family rank is not high enough to enable
you to obtain any great post. You would be nothing under them.  Through the patronage of M.
de Chambonas you got the appointment of Secretary of Legation at Stuttgart; but had it not
been for the change you would have remained all your life in that or some inferior post.  Did
you ever know men rise by their own merit under kings?  Everything depends on birth, connection,
fortune, and intrigue.  Judge things more accurately; reflect more maturely on the future."--"General,"
replied I, "I am quite of your opinion on one point.  I never received gift, place, or favour
from the Bourbons; and I have not the vanity to believe that I should ever have attained any
important Appointment.  But you must not forget that my nomination as Secretary of Legation
at Stuttgart preceded the overthrow of the throne only by a few days; and I cannot infer, from
what took place under circumstances unfortunately too certain, what might have happened in
the reverse case.  Besides, I am not actuated by personal feelings; I consider not my own interests,
but those of France.  I wish you to hold the reins of government as long as you live; but you
have no children, and it is tolerably certain that you will have none by Josephine: What will
become of us when you are gone?  You talk of the future; but what will be the future fate of
France?  I have often heard you say that your brothers are not--"--"You are right," said he,
abruptly interrupting me.  "If I do not live thirty years to complete my work you will have
a long series of civil wars after my death.  My brothers will not suit France; you know what
they are.  A violent conflict will therefore arise among the most distinguished generals, each
of whom will think himself entitled to succeed me."--"Well, General, why not take means to
obviate the mischief you foresee?"--"Do you imagine I do not think of it? The latter include
Florida clover (Desmodium tortuosum), more frequently called Beggar Weed, Buffalo clover (Trifolium
reflexum), and Seaside clover (Trifolium invulneratum). These may be worthy of some attention in
limited areas where the conditions are favorable, but it is not likely that they will ever be
very generally grown. They are dwelt upon rather to show their small economic importance and with a
view to prevent needless experimentation with plants possessed of
so little real merit.  Can you see how far reaction would extend?"--"General,
need I remind you that Louis, in his letter, guarantees the contrary of all you apprehend?
I know what will be your answer; but are you not able to impose whatever conditions you may
think fit?  Grant what is asked of you only at that price.  Take three or four years; in that
time you may ensure the happiness of France by institutions conformable to her wants. Custom
and habit would give them a power which it would not be easy to destroy; and even supposing
such a design were entertained, it could not be accomplished.  I have heard you say it is wished
you should act the part of Monk; but you well know the difference between a general opposing
the usurper of a crown, and one whom victory and peace have raised above the ruins of a subverted
throne, and who restores it voluntarily to those who have long occupied it.  You are well aware
what you call ideology will not again be revived; and--"--"I know what you are going to say;
but it all amounts to nothing.  Depend upon it, the Bourbons will think they have reconquered
their inheritance, and will dispose of it as they please.  The most sacred pledges, the most
positive promises, will be violated.  None but fools will trust them.  My resolution is formed;
therefore let us say no more on the subject.  But I know how these women torment you.  Let
them mind their knitting, and leave me to do what I think right."

Every one knows the adage, 'Si vis pacem para bellum'.  Had Bonaparte been a Latin scholar
he would probably have reversed it and said, 'Si vis bellum para pacem'.  While seeking to
establish pacific relations with the powers of Europe the First Consul was preparing to strike
a great blow in Italy.  As long as Genoa held out, and Massena continued there, Bonaparte did
not despair of meeting the Austrians in those fields which not four years before had been the
scenes of his success.  He resolved to assemble an army of reserve at Dijon.  Where there was
previously nothing he created everything.  At that period of his life the fertility of his
imagination and the vigour of his genius must have commanded the admiration of even his bitterest
enemies.  I was astonished at the details into which he entered.  While every moment was engrossed
by the most important occupations he sent 24,000 francs to the hospital of Mont St. Bernard.
When he saw that his army of reserve was forming, and everything was going on to his liking,
he said to me, "I hope to fall on the rear of Melas before he is aware I am in Italy .  . 
.  that is to say, provided Genoa holds out.  But MASSENA is defending it."

On the 17th of March, in a moment of gaiety and good humour, he desired me to unroll Chauchard's
great map of Italy.  He lay down upon it, and desired me to do likewise.  He then stuck into
it pins, the heads of which were tipped with wax, some red and some black.  I silently observed
him; and awaited with no little curiosity the result of this plan of campaign.  When he had
stationed the enemy's corps, and drawn up the pins with red heads on the points where he hoped
to bring his own troops, he said to me, "Where do you think I shall beat Melas?"--"How the
devil should I know?"--"Why, look here, you fool!  Melas is at Alessandria with his headquarters.
There he will remain until Genoa surrenders.  He has in Alessandria his magazines, his hospitals,
his artillery, and his reserves.  Crossing the Alps here (pointing to the Great Mont St. Bernard)
I shall fall upon Melas, cut off his communications with Austria, and meet him here in the
plains of Scrivia" (placing a red, pin at San Giuliano).  Finding that I looked on this manoeuvre
of pins as mere pastime, he addressed to me some of his usual compliments, such as fool, ninny,
etc., and then proceeded to demonstrate his plans more clearly on the map.  At the expiration
of a quarter of an hour we rose; I folded up the map, and thought no more of the matter.

Four months after this, when I was at San Giuliano with Bonaparte's portfolio and despatches,
which I had saved from the rout which had taken place during the day, and when that very evening
I was writing at Torre di Galifolo the bulletin of the battle to Napoleon's dictation, I frankly
avowed my admiration of his military plans.  He himself smiled at the accuracy of his own foresight.

The First Consul was not satisfied with General Berthier as War Minister, and he superseded
him by Carnot,

     --[There were special reasons for the appointment of Carnot,
     Berthier was required with his master in Italy, while Carnot, who
     had so long ruled the armies of the Republic, was better fitted to
     influence Moreau, at this time advancing into Germany.  Carnot
     probably fulfilled the main object of his appointment when he was
     sent to Moreau, and succeeded in getting that general, with natural
     reluctance, to damage his own campaign by detaching a large body of
     troops into Italy.  Berthier was reappointed to the Ministry on the
     8th of October 1800,--a very speedy return if he had really been
     disgraced.]--

who had given great proofs of firmness and integrity, but who, nevertheless, was no favourite
of Bonaparte, on account of his decided republican principles.  Berthier was too slow in carrying
out the measures ordered, [duplicated line removed here D.W.] and too lenient in the payment
of past charges and in new contracts.  Carnot's appointment took place on the 2d of April 1800;
and to console Berthier, who, he knew, was more at home in the camp than in the office, he
dictated to me the following letter for him:--

                                   PARIS, 2d April 1800.

     CITIZEN-GENERAL,--The military talents of which you have given so
     many proofs, and the confidence of the Government, call you to the
     command of an army.  During the winter you have REORGANISED the War
     Department, and you have provided, as far as circumstances would
     permit, for the wants of our armies.  During the spring and summer
     it must be your task to lead our troops to victory, which is the
     effectual means of obtaining peace and consolidating the Republic.

Bonaparte laughed heartily while he dictated this epistle, especially when he uttered the word
which I have marked in italics [CAPS]. It also aids in fixing volatile and escaping carbonates
of ammonia, and conveys them to the roots of the clover plants.

It is applied in the ground form by sowing it over the land, and more commonly just when the clover
is beginning to grow.  Bonaparte therefore wished to keep secret his long-projected plan of placing himself
at the head of the army of Italy, which, he then for the first time called the grand army.
I observed that by his choice of Berthier nobody could be deceived, because it must be evident
that he would have made another selection had he not intended to command in person.  He laughed
at my observation.

Our departure from Paris was fixed for the 6th of May, or, according to the republican calendar,
the 16th Floreal Bonaparte had made all his arrangements and issued all his orders; but still
he did not wish it to be known that he was going to take the command of the army.  On the eve
of our departure, being in conference with the two other Consuls and the Ministers, he said
to Lucien, "Prepare, to-morrow morning, a circular to the prefects, and you, Fouche, will publish
it in the journals.  Say I am gone to Dijon to inspect the army of reserve.  You may add that
I shall perhaps go as far as Geneva; but you must affirm positively that I shall not be absent
longer than a fortnight: You, Cambaceres, will preside to- morrow at the Council of State.
In my absence you are the Head of the Government.  State that my absence will be but of short
duration, but specify nothing.  Express my approbation of the Council of State; it has already
rendered great services, and I shall be happy to see it continue in the course it has hitherto
pursued.  Oh! I had nearly forgotten--you will at the same time announce that I have appointed
Joseph a Councillor of State.  Should anything happen I shall be back again like a thunderbolt.
I recommend to you all the great interests of France, and I trust that I shall shortly be talked
of in Vienna and in London."

We set out at two in the morning, taking the Burgundy road, which we had already so often travelled
under very different circumstances.

On the journey Bonaparte conversed about the warriors of antiquity, especially Alexander, Caesar,
Scipio, and Hannibal.  I asked him which he preferred, Alexander or Caesar.  "I place Alexander
in the first rank," said he, "yet I admire Caesar's fine campaign in Africa.  But the ground
of my preference for the King of Macedonia is the plan, and above all the execution, of his
campaign in Asia.  Only those who are utterly ignorant of war can blame Alexander for having
spent seven months at the siege of Tyre.  For my part, I would have stayed there seven years
had it been necessary.  This is a great subject of dispute; but I look upon the siege of Tyre,
the conquest of Egypt, and the journey to the Oasis of Ammon as a decided proof of the genius
of that great captain.  His object was to give the King of Persia (of whose force he had only
beaten a feeble advance-guard at the Granicus and Issus) time to reassemble his troops, so
that he might overthrow at a blow the colossus which he had as yet only shaken.  By pursuing
Darius into his states Alexander would have separated himself from his reinforcements, and
would have met only scattered parties of troops who would have drawn him into deserts where
his army would have been sacrificed.  By persevering in the taking of Tyre he secured, his
communications with Greece, the country he loved as dearly as I love France, and in whose glory
he placed his own.  By taking possession of the rich province of Egypt he forced Darius to
come to defend or deliver it, and in so doing to march half-way to meet him. By representing
himself as the son of Jupiter he worked upon the ardent feelings of the Orientals in a way
that powerfully seconded his designs. Though he died at thirty-three what a name he has left
behind him!"

Though an utter stranger to the noble profession of arms, yet I could admire Bonaparte's clever
military plans and his shrewd remarks on the great captains of ancient and modern times.  I
could not refrain from saying, "General, you often reproach me for being no flatterer, but
now I tell you plainly I admire you."  And certainly, I really spoke the true sentiments of
my mind.
