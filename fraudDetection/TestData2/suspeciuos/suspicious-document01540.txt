This mornin our offis was onhered by a visit from a typergraffical torewrist, wot in-terduced
hisself as John McNamee. He sed he'd just returned from a xtensive visit in the Western States,
ware he'd been for sum time, for the benefit of his health. He is one of the most distinguished
members of the perlitikel partis, called Anti-Monopolists. I admire a man wot praktices wot
he preaches. Now, this Mr. McNamee has never been known to contribute a cent to surportin our
grate ralerode mo-noperlists, altho he has travilled all over the United States by rale. Beside
that, he wouldn't axcept any accommodashuns short of a green-line sleeper. Wen I arst him y
he didn't ware his gold watch-chain and silk hat, like all other pollytishuns, he sed his partie
was endevourin to freeze out the big clothin monopolies by wearin their does till they fell
off. I notissed his bus-sum swellin with pride, as he spoke of the fruits there labor had brot
forth in the failyure of so menney grate clothin furms.

He condersended to thro in sum type, and wen he got thru, him and a cuppel of our printers
adjurned down stares to partake of a shampayne lunch. I guess he warn't used to drinkin lite
wines, cos he's been sleepin under the paper-cutter all the afternoon, dreemin that he was
bein nom-minated for Preserdent on the great anty-monoperlist ticket. Jest before dinner the
edittur told me to tell the make-up man to kill Lawrence Rickard. Now, his store is ware my
pa buys all his groseries, and his wife and ma's orful good chums, and b'long to the same sewin'
sircle. Mr. Rickard alwus treeted me rite, and I didn't like to see a cupple of bludthursty
villanes kill him without givin' him tim to say his prayers, so I called inter his store and
told him he'd better skip out or lay lo, cos the edittur was orful mad at him, and had ordered
a nuther feller to kill him. He sed he'd fix 'em. So rite after dinner a cupple of perlice
cum up to the offis and arrested Mr. Gilley and the make-up man for conspiracy to murder, and
they had to xplane it, and pay all the costs.

I took a littel vacashun this afternoon, and went out fishin', cos I remembured wot pa says
after he's kissed ma by telerfone,

    "Distance lends enchantment to the vue."

So I thot them two bad men wyld be more enchanted with me if I kep at a safe distance. I'm
orful frade my jurnulistick carrieer's goin' to be broken off short, but I don't think they
orter blamed me, cos the edittur shutd er told me to tell the make-up man to take out that
local notis wot red: "Fresh vegetabels and grene truck received daily, at L. I. Rickard's Grocerie,"
insted of makin' me tell him to kill Mr. Rickatrd, Well, if I can't be a jurnulist and make
a fortune, I' kno wot I can be, I'll go to the offis in the mornin', and if there's eny music
in the air, I'll resine and berry my hopes. Then I'll leese Dennis Ryan's old blind muel, wot's
too week to kik, and go to peddlin' fish. The Buster will bust 'fore they make enything outer
this chickin; ain't that so, Mister Diry?

CHAPTER VI.

     THE CLOWD SHEW's ITS SILVER LININ', AND GEORGIE DOES HISSELF
     PROUD.--THE RED-HEDDED OLD SNOOZER QUAKES BEFORE THE DEVIL.--
     HE'S GOT THE GALL.

To-day has ben a glorius day for me, cos it seems like I'd done sumthin wot was a onher to
the perfesshun.

Wen I went down to the offis I felt like my resignashun wuld be axceptabel, cos my servises
could easyly be dispensed with. I left the door opin wen I went in so as I'd have a avenew
of 'scape in case a mine 'xploded. Jest as I got in the press-room I hearn a muffelled voice
say: "Georgie, my boy, is that you?" I answered: "Yes, sir." Then I seen the edittur reclinin'
in a recumbent posishun, under the big sillinder press, lookin'whither 'an a sheet, and tremblm'
like he'd seen his grandpa's gost. I arst him wot was the matter, and he sez:

"Georgie, there's a man in the offis wot I sed was a red-hedded old snoozer wot ort to be run
outer town. Tell him I've gone to Coney Ileland to fite a duhell with Sullivan, or say I'm
out takin' my mornin' pistil practise. Tell him enything, only get schutt of him."

I sez: "You becher life, I'll fix him." So I went inter the sanktuary, like I own'd the hull
bisness, and I seen his oner walk-in' up and down, swarin' to hisself, like he was repeetin'
the responces in the 'Piscopal church.

Soon as he cot site of me, he sez:

"Young man, where am that red-hedded, shaller-braned, lantern-jawd, squint-eyed, crooked-knoes
son of a ded beet? Show me him till I pulverise him so fine that his remanes wouldn't bring
5 cents if you was to sell em for pure superfosfated binary bone."

"Wot did you remark?" sez I.

"Show me the insignificant littel puppy wot sed I was a red-hedded old snoozer," sed he.

"Oh! you wish ter see the edittur. I'll call him," sez I.

Then I went to the speakin tube wot goes up inter the composin-room, and sung out orful loud:

"Tell the fitin edittur that there's a gentleman, down in the offis, wants to intervue him.
Tell him he'd better lode up his dubble-barrl'd, breech-lodin blunderbuss with dannymite cartrag
cos the gentleman prefers a-heeted argument."

Then I turned round and told the man that the edittur 'd be down in a minnit.

He cooled rite off and sed:

"Thank you, my boy; there's no hurry; I guess you'll do jest as well. I only called to pay
for your valuabel paper. Tell the edittur my hole family culdn't get along without it; even
the baby lays awake all nite cry in' for it."

And then he handed me a $10 bill and didn't wate for no change, for he ony had a cuppel uv
minnits to each a trane in. Mr. Gilley was listenin' to the hull conversashun, an', wen the
coast was cleer, he come out from his hidin' place and patted me on the back and sez:

"Georgie, you're a brick; you're goin' to be a onher to your perfeshun. Sum day you'll be a
Pulsitter, cos you've got the gall of a Sun reporter."

I wonder if Sun reporters swet much, cos I never go golled 'less it was in summer wen pa maid
me play the fiddel with the old buck saw, gettin' the wood reddy for winter. I guess I must
be a hero, cos the sportin' edittur, wen he hurd wot I did, took me to the fotograf gallarv,
and had my pictur taken, so as he culd pass me off for the new English prize fiter, wot he's
training so as he can lick Sullivan.

CHAPTER VII.

     HE INTERVUES ELI PERKINS AND GETS SUM POINTS ON JURNERLISTIC
     EGGSAGGERASHUN, PREVARICASHUN AND MAGNIFYCASHUN.--Y PULLMAN
     STOK IS GOIN UP.

Wen I was round to the hotels, this mornin' gettin the arrivals, I seen sumthin on the regester
of the Grand Pacific wot look'd like a cuppel of spiders had ben fitin and got there legs in
the ink bottel and crawled over bout a dozen lines. I arst the clerk wot it ment. He culdnt:
say til he seen wot number the wot-is-it had. After lookin over his leger he found that No.
36 stood for Eli Perkins and a grate big bord bill.

I've hurd it sed that it showed enterprise for a noosepaper man to intervue distinguished guests,
so I thot it'd do purty neer as well to intervue a distinguished liar. So I got the clerk to
sho me up to Mr. Per-kin's room.

It feel like I'd got up a rung or two on the ladder alreddy, cos the edither thot my peece
wot I rote bout the intervue was good, and its goin to be put in to-morrer mornins paper. I
rite it down in your pages, Mister Diry, so as I can look at it wen my hart grows weery strugglin
for fame and wriches:

"After xchangin good mornins, the Buster reporter sed:

"'Mr. Perkins, youre one of the biggest liars in America, aint you?'

"'Who sed I was one of 'em, yung man?' sed he, gettin mad, and comin over to were I was sittin,
like he was goin to formally interduce his patent lether pumps to the paches wot I sit down
on. 'Who sed so? Name him instanly, and I'll brand him as an infamous liar. Me, one of the
biggest liars in America. It's mene, to, contemtabel. To think that I shuld hav toiled a life
to stablish a reputashun, only to be classed as one of the biggest liars of America. No, young
man, you're rong. I am the grate I am liar of the unyverse.'

"By this time our reprysentative was feelin like he'd mistakin his callin, but musterin up
courage, he sed:

"'Mr. Perkins, I'm a yung aspyrant for jurnalistic onhers. Can you give sum points on the bizness,
wot I culd use to advantage?'

"'Yes, my son, you becher bottom dollar, I can. Alwus bear in mind that the three furst principels
of moddern jur-nalism is Prevaricashun, Eggsaggeration, and Magnifycashun. For instance: If
Tallmage, in his sermin, sez he b'lieves there's a hell, you want to be sure to rite it up
thusly: "Rev. Tallmage, havin just returned from a short visit, held his hearers spellbound
for a hour, yesterday morning, by his grand and vivid discripshun of the mildness of the climat
of a salubrous summer resort" This wuld be a excellent illustrashun of Prevaricashun.

"'Eggsaggershun would be like this: If a candydate of the oppersishun treats a fellow to a
glass of beer, you wanter say: The barrel's ben tapped, and fabulous sums are bein expended
to inflooence voters, and never forget to hed the artickel Fraud, Corrupshun, and Forgerry.

"'If a six-pound baby comes to one of your subskribers, you warnter size the farther up, and
if he's good for twenty-five segars the babys got ter be twelve pounds. If he's good for fifty
make it eighteen pounds, and if he sends round a hole box, with the notis, the baby's got to
turn into twins. This wuld be a case of magnifycashun. It shos jurnerlistick enterprise. Y,
I've known cases where a puny 8-pound boy got to be bouncin triplets, mother and babies doin'
well, all cos their papa had cents enuf to send sum wiskey 'long with the segars. Those are
the principel points to bare in mind, and if you follow em up rite, you'll become a grate and
good jurnerlist. If you ever run short of sensashuns, get on the track of the "mercury" liar
and foller him up, till you strike his mine of valuabel infer-mashun.'

"'How long are you goin' to be in the city, Mr. Perkins?'

"'Only a few days. I'm here fixin' up my fenses, and puttin' in a bid for the nommenashun for
the Preserdency. I'm orful anxyus to run agin' Ben Butler.'

"'Is there enything else startlin' that you know, Mr. Perkins?' queried our rep-rysentativ.

"'Yes, but you musn't give it away, cos I'm short on Pullman stok. Do you see this?' said he,
holdin' up a peece of cotton, 'bout six inches square. 'Well I come down from Albanie on a
sleeper last nite, and this morning I mistook one of the sheets for my hankerchef, and this
thing is the sheet, but don't menshun it, cos it'll make the stok jump a foot.'

"'Good mornin', Mr. Perkins, wenever I run short of lies I'll call agen.'"

CHAPTER VIII.

     A CONVENSHUN OF THE DUDE DEMMERCRAZEY,--A COUNTRY DELEGAIT.--
     THE EDITHER GETS NOMMERNATED FOR GOVERNOR, AND GEORGIE
     SMOKES A $15,000 SEGAR.

There's something to pay to-day, is wot the edither sed to the casheer tonite, wen I walked
up to the desk for my $2 in munney and a bushell of gloryfycashun.

Yes, it was to pay all day in town, cos there was a convenshun of the Dude Dem-mercrazey in
the Grand Opera House, and the candydates had all the salloons leesed, and war busy servin
out free wisky, like they've got in O-i-o.

Mr. Diry, did you ever see a full-bludded Demmercratic delegait from a country village? Well,
jist immagin a tall, leen, lank indyvidooal, with long hare, slouch hat, a knoes wot looked
like it'd been in collishun with a elderberrie pie, and a sute of cloes wot was bort wen old
Father Adam's wardrope of fig leeves was sold out by the Sherruf of Eden county. That is a
kyrect pickter of them fellers whose hands is ichin to grab hold of the desternies and post-offisses
of Amerika, and if you'll take my advise you won't make no closer investi-gashun, lesn you've
got munney nuff to spare to set em up.

The aldermen of the city passed a resurlushun closin up the front dores of the s'loons, cos
they was frade if they was left open sumthin mite happin wot would hurt the reputashun of the
partie in the common hurd wot do the votin. But then the delergates didn't mind circumventin
a bildin, as long as they got a chanse, to circumvent sum hot stuf wen they got inside.

After dinner, the Convenshun was called to order, and the boss carpenter naled a lot of old
seccund hand planks togethur, wot they called a platform. Then the onherabel members, got orful
full of 'nthusyasm, cos the nommernashun for Guvner, was in order, jest then my chum jimmy,
wots workin for the Districk Telergraf Corn-penny come in, and handed the Cheerman a despach,
wot he red out loud. It sed:

     Nommernate Joe Gilley, for Guvner,
     and I'll tap a barrel, Sammy Tilton.

The thots of the barrl was too much for the assembelled multertude of the grate unwashed, and
ther was quietness in the Hall, wile vishuns of wiskey baths, free lunch stands, and clene
paper collars, past befor thir eyes. Then ther was a loud cheir, and Joe Gilley wos nommernated
by acclamashun. The rest of the ticket was put on the slate, by order of John Kelley, and the
delergates adjourned to the Buster offis, were the temperance edittur regaled em, with a demmyjohn
of Appel Jack, wot the committee giv him sted of cash, last time he lectured, on Proherbishun,
in Hobokin.

Wen the croud was cleered, Mr. Gilley arst me if I know'd the boy wot brung the note. I told
him he was my chum, and I'd rote the despach for fun.

Then he shook hands with me, and sed I was smarter 'an chane litenin', and I'd get to be Preserdent
sum day, cos I beet all the pollytishuns he ever know'd at wirepulling. Then he thanked me,
and give me a cuppel of segars, one for Jimmy and one for me, to call it square. We're goin'
to save 'em til to-morrer after dinner, cos it tain't offen boys, like us, get a chanse to
smoke $15,000 dollar segars, and these muster cost that, cos the evenin' papers says Mr. Gilley
pade $30,000 for the nommernashun.

He's ben most everything but a demmycrat, but he says he guesses he can stummick there docktrins
'til he gets to Albany.

CHAPTER IX.

     THE REPORTER INTERVUES A PULITICKEL GOST.--ROS CONKLIN GIVES
     HIM SUM PRESERDENSHALL POINTERS, AND VANISHES WITH HIS
     BOTTEL.

Yesterday was Sunday, so I didn't mak no entry, cos the corpse hadn't climaxed.

Jest as we was leavin the offis Saturday nite I heerd the city editur tell the purlitickal
repertoriai liar that he wanted him to hunt up a purlitickal gost, cos the Buster culdn't afford
to let a little one-horsed, two-for-a-cent daily, like the Times, have the monopolie of the
etheriel spirit act, not by a numerous long site. Bout 10 'clock in the evenin I saw the reporter
passin our house, on his way to Trinity churchyard, so I run up stairs and borrered one of
ma's nite gownds and nite caps, wot she wares wen she's 'mbracin morfeeus. Then I tuk a short-cut
down to the seminery. I'd jest got there, and was puttin the last touches to my gostley toilet,
wen I seen the reporter comin in the gate. Wen he got purty neer up to were I was I coffed
sort o' loud and unearthy like. Well, you'd dide to see him drop his note book and get a fit
of Hodeley's shakin malaria. He was jest recoverin and gettin ready to vacate the premises
wen I immertated the voice of the feller wot says the long prayers at Oshun grove camp meetin,
and sez:

"Young mortel noosepaper man, what warntedst thou, encroachin on the peece and quiet of our
last restin place, with thy terrestriel note book?"

"In the name of John Kelley, the omnippetent boss of the New York Demmercrazey, who are you?
Speak!" said the reporter.

"Sinse you command me in the name of one of the gods, I will speak. See this brillyant plumage,"
sed I, placin my hand where I sit down, "now covered from earthly vue. I am Stalwart Conklin,
the stallwart of the Rerpublikan partie, doomed for a sertain time (till '84) to strut arouad
on the confines of the perlitickel arena, attended by my humbel page Mctoo."

"Ros, old boy, shake!" sed the reporter, puttia out his baud and givia mine a urthly pull,
soon as he found out he warnt talkin to no angel. "Who's goin to be the coming President?"

"Lissen, and I'll unfold a tail See yonder rooster, all bedecked in gold?" sed I, pointin to
the wether vein on top of the Tribune bildin. "Well, put your hand to it, and you'll behold
the man wot my in-flooence is going to carry to the Wite House. If you've got eny spare change,
put her up on Winnyfield Skot Hancock, and count Mr. Conklin in Secretarry of State, but don't
yer never giv it away, cos I'm play in' a dubbel game. Give us a suck of your bottel, and I'll
hie myself thitherward for my nitely game of pennie anty with Genral Grant, who alreddy is
awaitin' me behind yonder cloud of Havannah smoke."

"Hold on, Ros, leve us a smell," sed the reporter, as I shoved the bottel in my pistil pocket,
and disserpeered behind a toombstun.

This mornin' the intervue come out in the Buster, and the hull corpse of noosgathururs of the
other papers is detaled in divishuns to wach all the semerneries in the hope of interviewin'
the gost of James G. Blame, and the demmercrazey is wilder with inthusiasm than they was after
Fouracres got drownded in wiskey out in Oio.

CHAPTER X.

     HE REPORTS A XERDENT WOT HAPPENED TO J. GOULD AND SETS ALL
     NEW YORK WILD.--XCITE-MENT IN WALL STREET.--JIMMY NERVOUS.--
     YOU CAN TELL THEM BY THE COMPANY THEY KEEPS.

I never could see y peepel with good cents don't xercise a little jugement wen they name their
baby's, so as fellus like me, wot is a young aspyrant for jurnerlistic ornhers, wouldn't git
mixed up on 'em.

Now the citie edittur told me if I ever hurd of any dog fites, or axydents, to report 'em,
cos it'd keep me in practise. So this mornin, bout 3 o'clock, we was woke up by a orfull loud
poundin on the front dore. Pa thot it was burglers, jest as if they'd nock at the dore if they
wanted to cum in and steel. So ma had to go to the winder, and she found out it was Mrs. Gould,
that's my chum, Jimmie's mother. She was cryin orful, and wanted ma to come over to her house,
cos Jimmy had got the nitemare from etin too much minsepie, and fell outer bed, and she was
frade he'd brok his kneck, cos he hadn't spok a wurd sinse. I seen I had a chanse to distinguish
myself, so I put on my cloes and run down to the offis. Oll the editturs and reporthers had
gone to bed, cos the paper was jest goin to press, so I told the foreman all bout the axerdent
wot happinned to J. Gould. He got orful xcited, and sed I orter be promoted, cos it was a splendid
item, and we'd be the only paper wot would hav it, and then he got the paper reddy for 50,000
extra coppies.

Wen I went down town after brake-fast I never seed such xcitement; hundreds of peeple was at
every street corner reedin' the Buster and discussin' probubillytees of a panic. The noose-boys
was coinin' money sellin' our paper, singin' out "All 'bout the axerdent," and showin' the
peeple the Busters hedlines, wot red: "Terribel Calamyty! J. Gould, the Ralerode King, Falls
Outer Bed and Sustains Fatul Injuries."

The managers of the other noosepapers was orful mad, and maid all the citie reporters hand
in their resignashuns, cos they wasn't smart enuf to each the item.

Down in Wall strete there was a reglar pannick. The Beers was jest as happy as they culd be,
and most all of 'em maid there fortunes before dinner, cos all the stock went down like led.
Jest wen a lot of the bulls was goin' to bust up and pay ther creditturs 5 cents on the dollar,
who should walk inter the Xchange but J. Gould himself. You never seen such a surprised crowd
enyw'ere; they all thot it was his gost till he 'xplayned that it warn't him wot fell outer
bed a tail He sed he know'd he was purty late gettin' down town, but they must 'xcuse him,
cos he was kep up purty late, calkin' up a cask of "Western Union Water" wot sprung a leek.

The 'xcitement's beginnin' to ware off now, but you bet the Buster's got a big lot of free
advertising and Mr. Giliey warn't a bit mad, wen I 'xplained how it all happened, cos the Wall
strete beers is goin' to s'port him for Guv'ner, cos the Buster's made 'em all wrich.

Jimmie's allrite agin; he was only stunned, and he got out of bed in time to get down to the
telegraf offis. I feel orful proud of my chum now. I never know'd how much he was valewd before.
You see now, Mr. Diry, wot a boy makes of hisself when he 'sociates with a risin' yung jurnerlist,
like yours trooly, Georgie.

CHAPTER XI.

     IN THE ROLE OF DRAMATICK CRITTICK.--"HOSIERY HENRYETTUR, OR
     A BOOM IN FANCY GOODS."--THE HAPPY DENEWMENT.

I didn't write nothin in you last nite, Mr. Diry, cos me and Maria--that's my gal--was takin
in the furst nite at the theatur.

Jest wen I was lee vin the offis the edittur called me aside and arst me if I thot I was capabel
to report the furst performance of "Hosiery Henryettur, or A Boom in Fancy Goods," cos the
dramattick edit-tur had gone and got mashed on the latest perfesshunal buty from Cleveland,
and warn't fit for duty.

I sez: "You becher sweet neck, I can."

So he give me a cupple of "comps" and a led nickle for to buy candie and peenuts with. Wen
I got home I drest up in my Sunday-skule cloes, and went round and wated wile my gal was puttin
on her bandyline and rubbin her face with a red sawcer wot she sez she uses for newralgy.

You bet, this devil felt proud, promerinardin his gal down the ile to the front orchestrey
chares, wots reserved for us rep-rysentatives of the metrypollyton press.

I got out my note-book and pencil, and me and Maria ete candie, talked sweet, and wated developments.

I'll pass over the prolog, and giv you the report jest as it was printed in this mornin's Buster:

"Last evenin, the curtin, in Niblo's theattur, rose to a large, appreshiativ, and bald-hedded
audiense wot sit in the orkerstry cheers.

"The play wot come on the staige for the furst time in 'Merica was 'ntitled 'Hosiery Henryettur,
or A Boom in Fancy Goods.' The plot was novel, romantik, and excrushiatingly interestin. The
principal charackters is Henryettur, a assthetick young ladie, dorter of a Fillydelphy lawyer,
and Augustus Angerlinus Fizzlesprung, a dude, wot wares a eye glass and carries a gold plaited
kane, wot he chews sted of terfaackky, cos his nerves is week. Henryettur is orful sick 'bout
Gussy, and wuld giv her lock of Horsecar Wild's hare, wot she carrys in her bussum, if Gussy
would ony tumbel and marry her. But Gussy wouldn't tumbel if the hull of Broadway'd fall on
him, cos he's mashed on a lot of dudines wot do the balleyin act in the academme. The furst
act was very utter, in fact too utterly utter for utteranse. The scenery was grandly sublime,
bein a combynashun of sunflours and Baltymore oysters, wot are sed to be very assthetick. The
seccund scene is more commonplase, cos it reprysents a green room of a theat-tur with the artists
sittin round a tabel, makin a supper off of Boston baked beens and shampain sawse. Gussy 'pares
in the background and givs the gals $5 to danse a bally for his own speshell benerfit. Then
they all cam to the front of the staige. We guess they b'long to the femail econymist persuashun,
cos they all 'pared to be very eccornomical in goods wen they maid there skurts, or else they
got there dresses wet, cos they've shrunk way up 'bove their nees, and way down b'low there
necks. The clerk wot sold 'em there stockins must of warrented them to wash, cos there all
colors, and there bout the only part of there does wots anyways long. The dan-cin' part of
the performanse didn't 'pare to be much appreshyated by the older porshun of the audiense,
cos they shaded their eyes with their opera glasses and blushed on the top of there heds, were
there hare used to grow. The gals then go thru a lot of moshuns, dansin the racket, and Gussy
sets 'em up.

"The furst scene of Act III. is in Henryettur's privat boodywar. She walks round, holdin a
big sunflower in her hand, and calls it to witness that if her dare Gussy don't make up his
mind purty soon to marry her, the tender thred wot holds her to this mundain spere will soon
cum to a too utterly utter, suddint round turn. Then she whispers sumthin to herself, and jumps
bout a foot, and xclaims, in a anty-assthetik voice: 'I will do it! By the misterious hare,
hidden in the opake depths of 10-cent-a-plate ice-creme, I will do it!'

"The scene then changes to a rehursal in the theattur, with Gussy looking at the bailey. All
on a suddint a gal comes dancin out on tip-toes and movin her hands round like she was playin'
skippin'-the-rope. Her close is purty, ony they're a good deal more shrunken than wot the other
gals had on, and her lower xtremer-ties look like she was smugglin' cotton from New Orleans.
Gussy then gets mashed on her rite away, and she don't 'pare to mind it a bit, cos she sot
rite down on his knee, and they begun a-talkin' awful soft. Purty soon she jumped 'bout six
feet, wen Gussy shoved a pin inter her stockins. Then he reckernized her as Henryettur, and
the bailey bring on the happey denewment act, by balleyin' round wile Gussy and Henryettur
'mbrace and kiss each other, and the property man lifts up his hands and sez:

"Henryettur, you had better Go put on your cloesietter, Cos you are too utter utter, Drest
all in your hosieryetter; Gussy, you must let her, let her, And I'm sure you'll like her better
Wen you've settur, settur, settur, And we've drunk to your dudetter."

CHAPTER XII.

     A OLD BILL.--THE EDITTUR GETS A FORTUNE FROM OSSTRAILYER.--
     SAMANTHY LONGTUNG AS THE BLUSHING BRIDE EXPECTENT.--THE END
     JESTERFIES THE MEENS.

The edittur was lookin outer the winder this mornin, wen, who should he spie cummin up the
offis steps, but Miss Samanthy Longtung, that's my Sundy skule teecher, wots sweet forty and
aint never had a mash. He sed, he guessed he'd better not be to home, so I'd hav to stand her
off, cos she'd cum to collect the quarter, wot he'd forgot to pay, wen he eat that plate of
injy-rubber oyster supe at the church festival, bout a yere ago.

Wen Miss Longtung cum in, she reck-ernized me, and congratulated me on enterin such a onherabel
perfesshun. Then she kissed me rite on the mouth, and sed, she wished I was growd up to be
a big man. Then she asst me if Mr. Gilley was in, and wen I told her "no," she sed she was
orful sorry, cos she'd cum to collect a littel bill, wot she's gone responsibel for, and wot
was purty neer dew.

I told her I was sure Mr. Gilley would be orful sorry, wen he cum back and found she'd ben
to see him, cos I'd hurd him say, he thot she was the purtist yung ladie, he knowd, n town,
and of all wimmin, she was the one he'd hav, wen he got a wife.

She sez, "Do tell, Georgie," and then she kissed and hugged me, all over, and asst me how long
the edittur would be gone.

I seen she was warntin to kno too much & wuldnt stan off wuth a cent. So I told her that Mr.
Gilley wuldnt get back til nite, cos he was up to his turney's, arrangin bout gettin the big
fortune wot his uncle, wot dide in Osstrailyer, had left to him.

"The poor dare man," sez she; "didnt I alwus tell them yung snips of gurls at sewin circles
that Mr. Gilley'd be welthy sum day, I guess they won't turn up their knoeses and call me a
dride up old made, when Samanthy Longtung turns inter Samanthy Gilley. I alwus knowd I'd be
married fore I got outer my teens, and to think my darlin Joe was too onherable and bashful
to ask my hand fore he got his fortune. But I spose he was frade I wuldnt giv this poor hart,
to a poor man, wen so menny welthy suters wus round," Then she hugged me agin, & told me to
tell Mr. Gilley never to mind bout that quarter, cos she'd advance it outer her own pocket.
Seein she was so orful kind, I told her all bout the fortune; how Mr. Gilley's uncle was sent
out ter rustercate in Bottany Bey by the British Guvment, but the barmy breezes of the bey
didnt agree with his constetushun, so he resined and took a boat for a nuther ileland, & wen
he got there he borrud sum sheep from a farmer, & them sheep got marreed, & then there was
a lot of littel sheep, wen they growd up and got married, and kep the ball rollin' even to
the 3d & 4th generashun, wen the old man dide. And now Mr. Gilley was goin to hav them aucshunned
off, & he thot he'd get bout half a millyun for em. Then I show'd her the plans of the Grammercy
Park palace, wot the perlitical edittur is keepin for refrence, in case he's called on to boom
Mr. Tilden for Preserdent, and told her them was the plans of the reserdense wot Mr. Gilley
was goin to hav bilt to take his blushin bride too, after they got back from a Yuropeean hunney-moon.
Then I maid her promis faithfully that she wouldnt tell a sole bout the fortune & manshun,
cos the Edittur of the Buster was the maudestest man in New York city.

The Jesuites used to say that "The end alwus justerfies the meens." Sum of the old Rode Ileland
Purytans may say I'm a liar, but I don't agree with em, cos I've maid too peepel happy. Samanthy
Longtung is radient, cos she walked up the strete like she was tredin on air. And Mr. Gilley
acts like he'd unloded a hull team full of pig led oflfen his mind, cos he knoes Samanthy'll
have the noose of the fortune all over town 'fore nite, and then he'll be abel to stave off
his bills, and run his cheek for wotever he warnts, for a hull yare to cum. He told me, wen
I was cummin home, that I was a born diplermatist, & ort to hire myself out to King Alfonso,
of Spain, in case he'd get insulted agin.

CHAPTER XIII.

     TRAVERLIN IN STILE.--GRAND RECEPSHUNS AND BABY KISSIN
     MATTYNAYS.--MISTAKEN FOR HIS AXERDENSY.--A DEDLEY STATE.

6 p. m., Troy, N. Y.

Mr. Diry:

You will notis by the above address, that you and me are away from home to-nite, and I spose
you orter have sum xplenashun of our doins. Well, wen I got down to the offis this mornin,
Mr. Gilley told me to go rite home and put on my Sunday cloes, and be reddy to start for Troy
on the leven clock trane, cos we was goin to opin up the campane there, and he wanted me to
carry his sachell, wot had a demmy-John in. Wen I got back, Gilley was orful busy with a old
pall-bearer of the Demmercratick corpse, from Shodack, fixin the rate per caperta wot was to
be bid for votes.

Wen we got to the depot, Vanderbuilt had had one of his spells, and had been sendin the publick
to Haydies, so he wuldn't let the trane wate ten minnits for a guvmentel candy date. Mr. Gilley
was in an orful way bout gettin left, cos he had to be at Troy to-nite, and there warnt no
other trane wot would get us there, so he pade a feerful big pile of munney for a speshell.
President Arthur, and a lot of other Republercan dudes was goin to start for Bufflo on a fishin
xcurshun at 1 o'clock, so our train got under way rite off, and every other trane on the rode
was sidetracked to let us get past.

There was a norful crowd at every sta-shun, wot had cum from miles round, to see us distingushed
cityzens. We stopped at Yungkurs to water. The town has got a orful apropriate name, judgin
by the way the mothers brot ther yung curs for us to kiss. I dont care nothin for baby's enyway,
but I had to submit to a lot of slobberin for the sake of inflooensin votes, for my Candydate.
At Fishkill we stopped for refreshments, and was waited on by a brass band and the Mayor and
more baby's. Mr. Gilley spoke a few wurds and thanked the crowd for their curtesies, and named
a few babies. Jest as we was steemin outer the depot, he dropt his red bandanner handkerchef;
you'd dide to see them yung gals tumbel over each other and scrambel for it. Before they got
it, it was tore all up, in little bits, and most every gal wot got a peece, unbuttoned there
jerseys, and stowed it way in there bussums. Fishkill, like Yungcurs, has got a purty good
name, cos it emits a perfume, very surgestive of cleenin fish, wot was fresh wen Preserdent
Buckannon was inaugerated.

Mr. Gilley was feelin orful proud of his recepshuns, all long the line, & it warnt till we
got to Albany that he found out that the peepel took him for Preserdent Arthur. Then he got
orful indignant, & made the air of the cur smell like condensed sulfur gas, the way he swared.
He sez his xperience of unkindnesses has been purty big in his lifetime, but that the peepel
of New York State shuld take him for his Axerdensy was the gol durndest unkindest cut of all,
and he'd be struck by litenin, with a asse's jaw, if he didn't make the furst barber he seen
shave them leg-a-mutton sidebords clene off, cos they was bringin his bald hed inter disgrace.
Wen we got to Troy we was met by the Centril Committee, and druv round to all the salloons,
so as we'd see all the sites, & set em up for the crowd. I heer the band pleyin "See the conqrin
hearo comes." I guess the populace is waitin for me, so I'll have to stop ritin now.

CHAPTER XIV.

     IMMENSE NTHUSIASM.--SUM POINTERS ON THE TARIFF.--THE OHIO
     BABY'S.----POOR LITTLE CAST OFF.--THE FALLEN GRATE.

My bussum swells to-nite with pride cos we've tuk the town by storm. If peepel warnt all Demmycrats
before, they is now, cos our speechyfyin has struck in purty deep. The meetin was a grand suckcess
fizzically, morally, numerrically, and, I guess, votingly.

From the furst, we pollytishuns was received with a perfect ovashun. Chair after chair rended
the air, and the seen was only comparable to the nitely concerts of the tommas cats and there
parrymores on the back fences of 42d street.
