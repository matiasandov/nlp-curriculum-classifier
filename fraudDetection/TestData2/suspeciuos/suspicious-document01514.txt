PUBLIC APPEAL.

TO THE PRESIDENT AND FELLOWS AND BOARD OF OVERSEERS OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY:

Gentlemen,--Believing it to be a necessary part of good citizenship to defend one's reputation
against unjustifiable attacks, and believing you to have been unwarrantably, but not remotely,
implicated in an unjustifiable attack upon my own reputation by Assistant Professor Josiah
Royce, since his attack is made publicly, explicitly, and emphatically on the authority of
his "professional" position as one of your agents and appointees, I respectfully apply to you
for redress of the wrong, leaving it wholly to your own wisdom and sense of justice to decide
what form such redress should take. If Dr. Royce had not, by clear and undeniable implication,
appealed to your high sanction to sustain him in his attack,--if he had not undeniably sought
to create a widespread but false public impression that, in making this attack, he spoke, and
had a right to speak, with all the prestige and authority of Harvard University itself,--I
should not have deemed it either necessary or becoming to appeal to you in self-defence, or,
indeed, to take any public notice whatever of an attack otherwise unworthy of it. But under
the circumstances I am confident that you will at once recognize the inevitableness and unquestionable
propriety of my appeal from the employee to the employer, from the agent to the principal;
and it would be disrespectful to you to doubt for a moment that, disapproving of an attack
made impliedly and yet unwarrantably in your name, you will express your disapprobation in
some just and appropriate manner. My action in thus laying the matter publicly before you can
inflict no possible injury upon our honored and revered Alma Mater: injury to her is not even
conceivable, except on the wildly improbable supposition of your being indifferent to a scandalous
abuse of his position by one of your assistant professors, who, with no imaginable motive other
than mere professional jealousy or rivalry of authorship, has gone to the unheard-of length
of "professionally warning the public" against a peaceable and inoffensive private scholar,
whose published arguments he has twice tried, but twice signally failed, to meet in an intellectual
way. If the public at large should have reason to believe that conduct so scandalous as this
in a Harvard professor will not be condemned by you, as incompatible with the dignity and the
decencies of his office and with the rights of private citizens in general, Harvard University
would indeed suffer, and ought to suffer; but it is wholly within your power to prevent the
growth of so injurious a belief. I beg leave, therefore, to submit to you the following statement,
and to solicit for it the patient and impartial consideration which the gravity of the case
requires.

I.

The first number of a new quarterly periodical, the "International Journal of Ethics," published
at Philadelphia in October, 1890, contained an ostensible review by Dr. Royce of my last book,
"The Way out of Agnosticism." I advisedly use the word "ostensible," because the main purport
and intention of the article were not at all to criticise a philosophy, but to sully the reputation
of the philosopher, deprive him of public confidence, ridicule and misrepresent his labors,
hold him up by name to public obloquy and contempt, destroy or lessen the circulation of his
books, and, in general, to blacken and break down his literary reputation by any and every
means, even to the extent of aspersing his personal reputation, although there had never been
the slightest personal collision. Its bitter and invidious spirit was not in the least disguised
by a few exaggerated compliments adroitly inserted here and there: these merely furnish the
foil needed to give greater potency and efficiency to the personal insinuations, and, like
Mark Antony's compliments to Cæsar's assassins, subserved quite too many politic purposes to
be accepted as sincere. Only a native of Boeotia could be imposed upon by them, when the actual
character of the book in question was carefully misrepresented, and when the self-evident trend,
tenor, and aim of the ostensible review were to excite public prejudice against the author
on grounds wholly irrespective of the truth or untruth of his expressed opinions.

Of course, the very largest liberty must be and should be conceded to legitimate criticism.
From this, as is well known, I never shrank in the least; on the contrary, I court it, and
desire nothing better for my books, provided only that the criticism be pertinent, intelligent,
and fair. But misrepresentation for the purpose of detraction is not criticism at all; and
(notwithstanding numerous quotations perverted by unfair and misleading glosses, including
two misquotations quite too useful to be accidental) this ostensible review is, from beginning
to end, nothing but misrepresentation for the purpose of detraction. Passing over numerous
minor instances, permit me to invite your attention to three gross instances of such misrepresentation.

II.

The book under review had taken the utmost pains (pages 16-39, especially page 39) to distinguish
"realism" from "idealism," and to argue for the former in opposition to the latter, on the
ground of the absolute incompatibility of the latter with the scientific method of investigation.
It had taken the utmost pains to make the contrast broad and deep, and to point out its far-reaching
consequences by explicitly opposing (1) scientific realism to philosophical idealism in general,
and in particular (2) constructive realism to constructive idealism, (3) critical realism to
critical idealism, (4) ethical realism to ethical idealism, and (5) religious realism to religious
idealism. Any fair or honorable critic would recognize this contrast and opposition between
realism and idealism as the very foundation of the work he was criticising, and would at least
state it candidly, as the foundation of his own favorable or unfavorable comments. How did
Dr. Royce treat it? He not only absolutely ignored it, not only said nothing whatever about
it, but actually took pains to put the reader on a false scent at the start, by assuring him
(without the least discussion of this all-important point) that my philosophical conclusions
are "essentially idealistic"!

So gross a misrepresentation as this might be charitably attributed to critical incapacity
of some sort, if it did not so very conveniently pave the way for the second gross misrepresentation
which was to follow: namely, that the theory actually propounded in my book had been, in fact,
"appropriated" and "borrowed" from an idealist! The immense utility of misrepresenting my system
at the start as "essentially idealistic" lay in the fact that, by adopting this stratagem,
Dr. Royce could escape altogether the formidable necessity of first arguing the main question
of idealism versus realism. Secretly conscious of his own inability to handle that question,
to refute my "Soliloquy of the Self-Consistent Idealist," or to overthrow my demonstration
that consistent idealism leads logically to hopeless absurdity at last, Dr. Royce found it
infinitely easier to deceive his uninformed readers by a bold assertion that I myself am an
idealist at bottom. This assertion, swallowed without suspicion of its absolute untruth, would
render it plausible and quite credible to assert, next, that I had actually "appropriated"
my philosophy from a greater idealist than myself.

For the only substantial criticism of the book made by Dr. Royce is that I "borrowed" my whole
theory of universals from Hegel--"unconsciously," he has the caution to say; but that qualification
does not in the least mitigate the mischievous intention and effect of his accusation as a
glaring falsification of fact and artful misdescription of my work. It would be inopportune
and discourteous to weary you with philosophical discussions. I exposed the amazing absurdity
of Dr. Royce's accusation of plagiarism in the reply to his article which, as appears below,
Dr. Royce himself anxiously suppressed, and which I should now submit to you, if he had not
at last taken fright and served upon me a legal protest against its circulation. But, to any
well-educated man, such an accusation as this refutes itself. It would be just as reasonable,
just as plausible, to accuse Darwin of having borrowed his theory of natural selection from
Agassiz, or Daniel Webster of having borrowed his theory of the inseparable Union from John
C. Calhoun, or ex-President Cleveland of having borrowed his message on tariff reform from
the Home Market Club, as to accuse me of having borrowed my theory of universals from Hegel.
Hegel's theory of universals is divided from mine by the whole vast chasm between realism and
idealism. The two theories contradict each other absolutely, uncompromisingly, irreconcilably:
Hegel's is a theory of "absolute idealism" or "pure thought" (reines Denken), that is, of thought
absolutely independent of experience, while mine is a theory of "scientific realism," that
is, of thought absolutely dependent upon experience. It is quite immaterial here which theory
is the true one; the only point involved at present is that the two theories flatly contradict
each other, and that it is self-evidently impossible that either could be "borrowed," consciously
or unconsciously, from the other. If Dr. Royce had ever done any hard thinking on the theory
of universals, or if he had the slightest comprehension of the problems it involves, he would
never have been so rash as to charge me with "borrowing" my theory from Hegel, and thus to
commit himself irrevocably to a defence of the absurd; but eagerness to accuse another has
betrayed him into a position whence it is impossible for him to escape with honor. Solely by
misdescribing my philosophy as "essentially idealistic" when it openly and constantly and emphatically
avows itself to be essentially realistic, could Dr. Royce give the faintest color of plausibility
to his monstrous and supremely ridiculous accusation of plagiarism; solely by presuming upon
the public ignorance both of Hegel and of my own work could he dare to publish such an accusation
to the world. These gross misrepresentations, however, he did not hesitate to make, since they
were necessary in order to pave the way to a third and still grosser misrepresentation on which
he apparently had set his heart: namely, that, after borrowing the whole substance of my philosophy
from Hegel, I have been guilty of making "vast and extravagant pretensions" as to my own "novelty,"
"originality," and "profundity," not only with regard to my published books, but also with
regard to my "still unpublished system of philosophy." His words are these:--

"Of novelty, good or bad, the book contains, indeed, despite its vast pretensions, hardly a sign."

"It is due also to the extravagant pretensions which he frequently makes of late as to the
originality and profundity of his still unpublished system of philosophy, to give the reader
some hint of what so far appears to be the nature of our author's contributions to philosophical
reflection."

Precisely what have been these alleged "pretensions"? Dr. Royce cites only three instances.

I. He first garbles a sentence in the prefatory Note to "The Way out of Agnosticism," by quoting
only one phrase from it. The sentence in full is this: "By a wholly new line of reasoning,
drawn exclusively from those sources [science and philosophy], this book aims to show that,
in order to refute agnosticism and establish enlightened theism, nothing is now necessary but
to philosophize that very scientific method which agnosticism barbarously misunderstands and
misuses." There is no "pretension" whatever in these words, except that the general "line of
reasoning" set forth in the book is, as a whole, different from that of other books. If not,
why publish it? Or, without the same cause, why publish any book? I see no reason to recall
or to modify this perfectly true statement; Dr. Royce, at least, has shown none. The "novelty"
of the book lies in its very attempt to evolve philosophy as a whole out of the scientific
method itself, as "observation, hypothesis, and experimental verification," by developing the
theory of universals which is implicit in that purely experiential method; and Dr. Royce does
not even try to prove that Hegel, or anybody else, has ever made just such an attempt as that.
Unless there can be shown somewhere a parallel attempt, the statement is as undeniably true
as it is certainly unpretentious.

II. Next, Dr. Royce extracts these sentences from the body of the book (I supply in brackets
words which he omitted): "The first great task of philosophy is to lay deep and solid foundations
for the expansion [and ideal perfection] of human knowledge in a bold, new, and true theory
of universals. For so-called modern philosophy rests complacently in a theory of universals
which is thoroughly mediæval or antiquated." What personal pretension, even of the mildest
sort, can be conceived to lurk in these innocent words? I did not say that I have succeeded
in performing that "task"; I repeat now what I have often said and what I meant then; namely,
that modern science has unawares performed it already, that I have faithfully tried to formulate
and further apply what science has done, and that I respectfully submit the result (so far
as already published), not to such critics as Dr. Royce, but to able, learned, and magnanimous
students of philosophy everywhere.

III. Lastly, though employing quotation marks so as to evade a charge of formal misquotation,
he perverts and effectually misquotes a sentence of the book in a way which makes it appear
exactly what it is not,--"pretentious." I had said at the end of my own book (page 75): "Its
aim has been to show the way out of agnosticism into the sunlight of the predestined philosophy
of science." Most certainly, there is no "pretension" in this modest and carefully guarded
avowal of the simple aim of my book. But Dr. Royce twists this modest avowal into a barefaced
boast, and injuriously misquotes me to his own readers thus: "At the conclusion of the book,
we learn that we have been shown 'the way out of agnosticism into the sunlight of the predestined
philosophy of science.'" Gentlemen, I request you to compare thoughtfully the expressions which
I have here italicized, and then decide for yourselves whether this injurious misquotation
is purely accidental, or, in view of Dr. Royce's purpose of proving me guilty of "vast pretensions,"
quite too useful to be purely accidental.

IV. But Dr. Royce does not content himself with quoting or misquoting what I have published,
for the self-evident reason that what I have published is not sufficiently "pretentious" for
his purpose. Disinterested anxiety for the public welfare, and tender sorrow over the "harm
to careful inquiry" which my book is doing by "getting influence over immature or imperfectly
trained minds," constrain him to accuse me of "frequently making of late extravagant pretensions
as to the originality and profundity" of my "still unpublished system of philosophy."

Precisely what have been these "extravagant pretensions"? Simply these:--

In the preface to "Scientific Theism," I said of that book: "It is a mere résumé of a small
portion of a comprehensive philosophical system, so far as I have been able to work it out
under most distracting, discouraging, and unpropitious circumstances of many years; and for
this reason I must beg some indulgence for the unavoidable incompleteness of my work."

Enumerating some reasons why I hesitated to begin the series of papers afterwards published
as "The Way out of Agnosticism," I said, in the first of these papers: "First and foremost,
perhaps, is the fact that, although the ground-plan of this theory is already thoroughly matured,
the literary execution of it is as yet scarcely even begun, and from want of opportunity may
never be completed; and it seems almost absurd to present the abridgment of a work which does
not yet exist to be abridged."

Finally, in an address printed in the "Unitarian Review" for December, 1889, I said: "Without
advancing any personal claim whatever, permit me to take advantage of your indulgent kindness,
and to make here the first public confession of certain painfully matured results of thirty
years' thinking, which, in the momentous and arduous enterprise of developing a scientific
theology out of the scientific method itself, appear to be principles of cosmical import....
Perhaps I can make them intelligible, as a contribution to that 'Unitary Science' which the
great Agassiz foresaw and foretold." In a postscript to this address I added: "For fuller support
of the position taken above, I am constrained to refer ... to a large treatise, now in process
of preparation, which aims to rethink philosophy as a whole in the light of modern science
and under the form of a natural development of the scientific method itself."

What remotest allusion to my own "originality" is contained in these passages, or what remotest
allusion to my own "profundity"? What "pretension" of any sort is here made, whether "extravagant"
or moderate? The pure absurdity of such an accusation reveals itself in the very statement
of it. Dr. Royce is referring here, be it understood, not to my published books, but to my
"unpublished system of philosophy." How does he know anything about it? I certainly have never
shown him my unpublished manuscript, and beyond those published allusions to it he possesses
absolutely no means whatever of knowing anything about its contents. Nothing, surely, except
full and exact knowledge, derived from careful and patient personal examination of that manuscript,
could possibly be a ground of just judgment of its character. How, then, in absolute ignorance
of its character and contents, could any fair man hazard any public verdict upon it? Yet Dr.
Royce not only accuses me of making "pretensions" about it which I never made, but dares to
characterize them as "extravagant," when, for all he knows, they might (if made) fall far short
of the truth. Whether in this case the evidence supports the accusation, and whether the conscience
which permits the making of such an accusation on such evidence is itself such a conscience
as you expect to find in your appointees,--these, gentlemen, are questions for you yourselves
to decide.

III.

These three connected and logically affiliated misstatements of fact--namely, (1) that my philosophy
is "essentially idealistic," (2) that it has been "appropriated" and "unconsciously borrowed"
from the idealist Hegel, and (3) that I have frequently made "extravagant pretensions as to
the originality and profundity" of this merely "borrowed" and "appropriated" philosophy--constitute
in their totality a regular system of gross and studied misrepresentation, as methodical and
coherent as it is unscrupulous. It is not "fair criticism"; it is not "criticism" at all; and
I do not hesitate to characterize it deliberately as a disgrace both to Harvard University
and to American scholarship.

Yet, gross and studied and systematic as this misrepresentation is, I should have passed it
over in silence, precisely as I did pass over a similar attack by Dr. Royce on my earlier book
in "Science" for April 9, 1886, were it not that, perhaps emboldened by former impunity, he
now makes his misrepresentations culminate in the perpetration of a literary outrage, to which,
I am persuaded, no parallel can be found in the history of polite literature. It is clear that
forbearance must have somewhere its limit. The commands of self-respect and of civic conscience,
the duty which every citizen owes to his fellow-citizens not to permit the fundamental rights
of all to be unlimitedly violated in his own person, must at last set a bound to forbearance
itself, and compel to self-defence. These are the reasons which, after patient exhaustion of
every milder means of redress, have moved me to this public appeal.

Dr. Royce's misstatements of fact, so elaborately fashioned and so ingeniously mortised together,
were merely his foundation for a deliberate and formal "professional warning to the liberal-minded
public" against my alleged "philosophical pretensions." The device of attributing to me extravagant
but groundless "pretensions" to "originality" and "profundity"--since he is unable to cite
a single passage in which I ever used such expressions of myself--was probably suggested to
him by the "Press Notices of 'Scientific Theism,'" printed as a publishers' advertisement of
my former book at the end of the book which lay before him. These "Press Notices," as usual,
contain numerous extracts from eulogistic reviews, in which, curiously enough, these very words,
"original" and "profound," or their equivalents, occur with sufficient frequency to explain
Dr. Royce's choleric unhappiness. For instance, Dr. James Freeman Clarke wrote in the "Unitarian
Review": "If every position taken by Dr. Abbot cannot be maintained, his book remains an original
contribution to philosophy of a high order and of great value"; M. Renouvier, in "La Critique
Philosophique," classed the book among "de remarquables efforts de construction métaphysique
et morale dus à des penseurs indépendants et profonds"; and M. Carrau, in explaining why he
added to his critical history of "Religious Philosophy in England" a chapter of twenty pages
on my own system, actually introduced both of the words which, when thus applied, jar so painfully
on Dr. Royce's nerves: "La pensée de M. Abbot m'a paru assez profonde et assez originale pour
mériter d'être reproduite littéralement." (La Philosophie Religieuse en Angleterre. Par Ludovic
Carrau, Directeur des Conférences de philosophie à la Faculté des lettres de Paris. Paris,
1888.) These extracts, be it remembered, were all printed at the end of the book which Dr.
Royce was reviewing. Now he had an undoubted right to think and to say that such encomiums
as these on my work were silly, extravagant, preposterous, and totally undeserved; but to take
them out of the mouth of others and put them into mine was wilful and deliberate calumny. Systematic
and calumnious misrepresentation is the sole foundation of the "professional warning" in which
Dr. Royce's ostensible review culminates, and which is too extraordinary not to be quoted here
in full:--

"And so, finally, after this somewhat detailed study of Dr. Abbot's little book, I feel constrained
to repeat my judgment as above. Results in philosophy are one thing; a careful way of thinking
is another. Babes and sucklings often get very magnificent results. It is not the office of
philosophy to outdo the babes and sucklings at their own business of receiving revelations.
It is the office of philosophy to undertake a serious scrutiny of the presuppositions of human
belief. Hence the importance of the careful way of thinking in philosophy. But Dr. Abbot's
way is not careful, is not novel, and, when thus set forth to the people as new and bold and
American, it is likely to do precisely as much harm to careful inquiry as it gets influence
over immature or imperfectly trained minds. I venture, therefore, to speak plainly, by way
of a professional warning to the liberal-minded public concerning Dr. Abbot's philosophical
pretensions. And my warning takes the form of saying that, if people are to think in this confused
way, unconsciously borrowing from a great speculator like Hegel, and then depriving the borrowed
conception of the peculiar subtlety of statement that made it useful in its place,--and if
we readers are for our part to accept such scholasticism as is found in Dr. Abbot's concluding
sections as at all resembling philosophy,--then it were far better for the world that no reflective
thinking whatever should be done. If we can't improve on what God has already put into the
mouth of the babes and sucklings, let us at all events make some other use of our wisdom and
prudence than in setting forth the American theory of what has been in large part hidden from us."

Gentlemen, I deny sweepingly the whole groundwork of cunning and amazing misrepresentation
on which this unparalleled tirade is founded.

I. I deny that my philosophy is "essentially idealistic," or that any "careful" or conscientious
scholar could possibly affirm it to be such.

II. I deny that I "borrowed" my realistic theory of universals from the idealist, Hegel, whether
consciously or unconsciously. The charge is unspeakably silly. Realism and idealism contradict
each other more absolutely than protectionism and free-trade.

III. I deny that I ever made the "philosophical pretensions" which Dr. Royce calumniously imputes
to me. But, if I had made pretensions as high as the Himalayas, I deny his authority to post
me publicly--to act as policeman in the republic of letters and to collar me on that account.
A college professor who thus mistakes his academic gown for the policeman's uniform, and dares
to use his private walking-stick for the policeman's bludgeon, is likely to find himself suddenly
prostrated by a return blow, arrested for assault and battery, and unceremoniously hustled
off into a cell, by the officer whose function he has injudiciously aped without waiting for
the tiresome but quite indispensable little preliminary of first securing a regular commission.

IV. Most of all, I deny Dr. Royce's self-assumed right to club every philosopher whose reasoning
he can neither refute nor understand. I deny, in general, that any Harvard professor has the
right to fulminate a "professional warning" against anybody; and, in particular, that you,
gentlemen, ever voted or intended to invest Dr. Royce with that right. He himself now publicly
puts forth a worse than "extravagant pretension" when he arrogates to himself this right of
literary outrage. He was not appointed professor by you for any such unseemly purpose. To arrogate
to himself a senseless "professional" superiority over all non-"professional" authors, to the
insufferable extent of publicly posting and placarding them for a mere difference of opinion,
is, from a moral point of view, scandalously to abuse his academical position, to compromise
the dignity of Harvard University, to draw down universal contempt upon the "profession" which
he prostitutes to the uses of mere professional jealousy or literary rivalry, and to degrade
the honorable office of professor in the eyes of all who understand that a weak argument is
not strengthened, and a false accusation is not justified, by throwing "professional warnings"
as a make-weight into the scales of reason. I affirm emphatically that no professor has a moral
right to treat anybody with this undisguised "insolence of office," or to use any weapon but
reason in order to put down what he conceives to be errors in philosophy. In the present case,
I deny that Dr. Royce has any better or stronger claim than myself to speak "professionally"
on philosophical questions. The very book against which he presumes to warn the public "professionally"
is founded upon lectures which I myself "professionally" delivered, not only from Dr. Royce's
own desk and to Dr. Royce's own college class, but as a substitute for Dr. Royce himself, at
the request and by the appointment of his own superiors, the Corporation and Overseers of his
own University; and the singular impropriety (to use no stronger word) of his "professional
warning" will be apparent to every one in the light of that fact.

IV.

So far I have treated Dr. Royce's attack solely from the literary and ethical points of view.
The legal point of view must now be considered.

Plagiarism, conscious or unconscious, is a very grave and serious charge to bring against an
author, and one which may entail upon him, not only great damage to his literary reputation,
but also social disgrace and pecuniary loss. If proved, or even if widely believed without
proof, it cannot but ruin his literary career and destroy the marketable value of his books;
and it matters little, so far as these practical results are concerned, whether the plagiarism
attributed to him is conscious or unconscious. In an able editorial article on "Law and Theft,"
published in the New York "Nation" of Feb. 12, 1891, it is forcibly said: "Authors or writers
who do this [borrowing other men's ideas] a good deal, undoubtedly incur discredit by it with
their fellows and the general public. It greatly damages a writer's fame to be rightfully accused
of want of originality, or of imitation, or of getting materials at second hand. But no one
has ever proposed to punish or restrain this sort of misappropriation by law. No one has ever
contended for the infliction on the purloiners of other men's ideas of any penalty but ridicule
or disgrace." Whoever wrongfully accuses an author of plagiarism, then, holds him up undeservedly
to "discredit, ridicule, or disgrace," and "slanders his title" to the product of his own brain.
This is contrary to the law. Yet this is precisely what Dr. Royce has done in accusing me falsely,
and as a "certain" matter of fact, of borrowing my theory of universals from Hegel. His accusation
is made with as many sneers and as much insult as could well be compressed into the space:--

"Dr. Abbot is hopelessly unhistorical in his consciousness. His 'American theory of universals'
is so far from being either his own or a product of America that in this book he continually
has to use, in expounding it, one of the most characteristic and familiar of Hegel's technical
terms, namely, 'concrete,' in that sense in which it is applied to the objective and universal
'genus.' Dr. Abbot's appropriation of Hegel's peculiar terminology comes ill indeed from one
who talks," etc. "This I say not to defend Hegel, for whose elaborate theory of universals
I hold in no wise a brief, but simply in the cause of literary property-rights. When we plough
with another man's heifer, however unconscious we are of our appropriation, however sincerely
we seem to remember that we alone raised her from her earliest calfhood, it is yet in vain,
after all, that we put our brand on her, or call her 'American.'... Now Hegel's whole theory
may be false; but what is certain is that Dr. Abbot, who has all his life been working in an
atmosphere where Hegelian ideas were more or less infectious, has derived his whole theory
of universals, so far as he has yet revealed it with any coherency, from Hegelian sources,
and even now cannot suggest any better terminology than Hegel's for an important portion of
the doctrine. And of these men some had emerged from their native mire spotless and pure as from
newly-fallen snow. The natural force of character which had saved these men had not been given
to him.

His feet had been set in the crooked ways, and he had travelled on, reckless, defiant, dimly
conscious that the road was a bad one, and that his garments were bespattered with more mud-stains
than would be agreeable to some travellers.

It was only when the all-powerful influence of love was brought to bear upon this plastic nature
that Valentine Hawkehurst became fully awakened to the degradation of his position, and possessed
with an earnest desire to emerge from the great dismal swamp of bad company. Then, and then only,
began the transformation which was ultimately to become so complete a change. Some influence,
even beyond that of happy love, was needed to give force to this
man's character; and in the great terror of the last three months
that influence had been found.

The very foundations of Valentine Hawkehurst's life had been shaken, and, come what might, he
could never be again what he had been.

He had almost lost her. All was said in that. She had been almost taken from him--she, who
to this man was father, mother, wife, household, past, present, future, glory, ambition, happiness--everything
except that God who ruled above and held her life and his peace in the hollow of His hand.
He had been face to face with death; and never, in all the years to come--never in the brightest
hour of future happiness, could he forget the peril that had come upon him, and might come again.
He had learned to understand that he held her, not as a free gift, but as a loan--a treasure to
be reclaimed at any moment by the God who lent her.

The darksome valley was past, and Valentine stood by his darling's side, safe upon the sunlit uplands.

The
doctors had declared their patient safe. The hour of danger had been passed in safety, and the
mischief worked by the poisoner's slow process had been well nigh counteracted by medical skill.

"In six weeks' time you may take your wife for her honeymoon tour, Mr. Hawkehurst, with her
health and spirits thoroughly re-established," said Dr. Jedd.

"What
is that you say about honeymoon tours?" cried Gustave Lenoble. "Hawkehurst
and his wife will spend their honeymoon at Cotenoir; is it not, Diana?"

Diana
replied that it was to be, and must be so. Hegel's "concrete"
cannot be seen, heard, or touched; while to me nothing which cannot be seen, heard, or touched
is "concrete" at all. A mere common school education is quite sufficient for comprehension
of the contradictoriness of these two uses of the word. Yet, in order to found a malicious
charge of plagiarism, Dr. Royce has the hardihood to assure the uninformed general public that
Hegel and I use the word "concrete" in one and the same sense!

(2) The assertion that I have lived all my life in a Hegelian "atmosphere" I can only meet
with a short, sharp, and indignant denial. I know of no such "atmosphere" in all America; if
it anywhere exists, I certainly never lived, moved, or worked in it. The statement is a gratuitous,
impertinent, and totally false allegation of fact, wholly outside of my book and its contents,
and is used in this connection solely to feather an arrow shot at my reputation; it is a pure
invention, a manufactured assertion which is absolutely without foundation, and, when thus
artfully thrown out with apparent artlessness (ars celare artem) as itself foundation for a
false and malicious charge of plagiarism, it becomes fabrication of evidence for the purpose
of defamation. The less said about such an offence as that, the better for Dr. Royce, and I
spare him the comment it deserves.

Now, while it might be "fair criticism" to infer my plagiarism from Hegel, if there were only
some reasonable or even merely plausible evidence to support the inference (which I have just
proved not to be the case), it is incontestable that to affirm this plagiarism, as a "certain"
matter of fact, without any reasonable evidence at all, is not that "fair criticism" which
the law justly allows, but, on the contrary, a totally unjustifiable libel. In accusing me
personally of plagiarism on no reasonable grounds whatever, as I have just unanswerably proved
him to have done, and in making the "certainty" of the plagiarism depend upon an allegation
of fact wholly independent of the book which he professed to be criticising (namely, the false
allegation that I have worked all my life in a Hegelian "atmosphere"), Dr. Royce has beyond
all controversy transgressed the legally defined limits of "fair criticism," and become a libeller.

But this is by no means all. If the bat-like accusation of an "unconscious", yet "sinning"
(or sinful) plagiarism hovers ambiguously between attacking my literary reputation and attacking
my moral character, there is no such ambiguity hanging about the accusation of "extravagant
pretensions as to the originality and profundity of my still unpublished system of philosophy."
A decent modesty, a self-respectful reserve, a manly humility in presence of the unattainable
ideal of either moral or intellectual perfection, a speechless reverence in the presence of
either infinite goodness or infinite truth,--these are virtues which belong to the very warp
and woof of all noble, elevated, and justly estimable character; and wherever their absence
is conspicuously shown, there is just ground for moral condemnation and the contempt of mankind.
Dr. Royce has not scrupled to accuse me of making, not only "pretensions," but even "extravagant
pretensions," which are absolutely incompatible with the possession of these beautiful and
essential virtues, and thereby to hold me up to universal contempt and derision. He has done
this, by the very terms of his accusation, absolutely and confessedly without cause; for the
system of philosophy which is "unpublished" to others is no less "unpublished" to him, and
an accusation thus made confessedly without any knowledge of its truth is, on the very face
of it, an accusation which is as malicious as it is groundless. To make such a self-proved
and self-condemned accusation as this is, I submit, to be guilty of libel with no ordinary
degree of culpability.

But the libel of which I have greatest cause to complain is not confined to exceptional or
isolated expressions. These might charitably be explained as mere momentary ebullitions of
pettishness or spleen, and pardonable as merely faults of temper in a criticism which was in
the main conscientious and fair. But the libel of which I complain most of all is one that
constitutes the entire ground and framework of the article as a whole. Every part of it is
methodically spun and interwoven with every other part, in such a way as to make it one seamless
tissue of libel from beginning to end. This I say in full consciousness of the interspersed
occasional compliments, since these have only the effect of disguising the libellous intent
of the whole from a simple-minded or careless reader, and since they subserve the purpose of
furnishing to the writer a plausible and ready-made defence of his libel against a foreseen
protest. Compliments to eke out a libel are merely insults in masquerade. The libellous plan
of the article as a whole is shown in the regular system of gross and studied misrepresentation,
of logically connected and nicely dovetailed misstatements of facts, which I exposed at the
outset. Every intelligent reader of my two books is perfectly aware that they are both devoted
to an exposition of the fundamental and irreconcilable conflict between philosophical idealism
and scientific realism, and to a defence of the latter against the former, as the only possible
method by which a spiritual theism can be intellectually, and therefore successfully, defended
in this age of science. Only one who has read and digested the two books can fully appreciate
the enormity and the unscrupulousness of the initial misrepresentation, slipped in, as it were,
quite casually, and without any argument, in the apparently incidental and matter-of-course
statement that my "conclusion" is "essentially idealistic." It is not "idealistic" at all,
but as radically realistic as the premises themselves; and no professor of philosophy could
ever have called it "idealistic" by a mere slip of the tongue or pen. The intelligent origin
of this misrepresentation is clearly enough suggested in the use to which it is at once put:
namely, to render plausible the otherwise ridiculous charge that my theory of universals was
"borrowed" from an idealist. Next, the same origin is more than suggested by the use to which
these two misrepresentations together are put: namely, to show that any claim of "novelty"
for a merely "borrowed" philosophy is a "vast" and "extravagant pretension." Lastly, the same
origin is inductively and conclusively proved, when these three inter-linked misrepresentations,
as a whole, are made the general foundation for a brutal "professional warning" to the public
at large against my "philosophical pretensions" in general. Not one of these fundamental positions
of Dr. Royce's article is a fact,--least of all, an "admitted fact"; on the contrary, each
of them is energetically and indignantly denied. But the libel of which I complain above all
is the regular system of gross and studied misrepresentation by which the most essential facts
are first misstated and falsified, and then used to the injury of my literary and personal
reputation.

It may, I trust, be permitted to me here to show clearly what the law is, as applicable to
the case in hand, by a few pertinent citations.

"The critic must confine himself to criticism, and not make it the veil for personal censure,
nor allow himself to run into reckless and unfair attacks, merely from the love of exercising
his power of denunciation. Criticism and comment on well-known and admitted facts are very
different things from the assertion of unsubstantiated facts. A fair and bona fide comment
on a matter of public interest is an excuse of what would otherwise be a defamatory publication.
The statement of this rule assumes the matters of fact commented on to be somehow ascertained.
It does not mean that a man may invent facts, and comment on the facts so invented in what
would be a fair and bona fide manner, on the supposition that the facts were true. If the facts
as a comment upon which the publication is sought to be excused do not exist, the foundation
fails.... The distinction cannot be too clearly borne in mind between comment or criticism
and allegations of fact.... To state matters which are libellous is not comment or criticism."
(Newell on Defamation, Slander, and Libel, p. 568.) Applying this to the case in hand: the
"admitted facts" are these: (1) my philosophy is realistic from beginning to end; (2) I have
not worked all my life, nor any part of my life, in a Hegelian "atmosphere"; (3) I did not
borrow my theory of universals from Hegel; (4) I have made no vast or extravagant pretensions
whatever as to my own philosophy. But Dr. Royce invents and states the exact opposite of all
these facts, and then bases on these purely invented facts most undeserved "personal censure"
and most "reckless and unfair attacks." Therefore, his article is a libel in its whole groundwork
and essential spirit.

"If a person, under pretence of criticising a literary work, defames the private character
of the author, and, instead of writing in the spirit and for the purpose of fair and candid
discussion, travels into collateral matter, and introduces facts not stated in the work, accompanied
with injurious comment upon them, such person is a libeller, and liable to an action." (Broom's
Legal Maxims, p. 320.) Applying this to the case in hand: Dr. Royce "defames" my "private character,"
when he accuses me of "frequently" indulging in "extravagant pretensions"; he "travels into
collateral matter," when he alludes at all to my unpublished manuscript; he "introduces facts
not stated in the work, accompanied with injurious comment upon them," when he alludes to this
unpublished manuscript for the sole purpose of saying (untruthfully) that I "frequently make,
of late, extravagant pretensions as to its originality and profundity," and again when he says
that I have worked all my life in a Hegelian "atmosphere," for the sole purpose of founding
upon this false statement a false charge of plagiarism.

In the "Griffith Gaunt" case, Judge Clerke said in his charge to the jury: "The interests of
literature and science require that the productions of authors shall be subject to fair criticism,--that
even some animadversion may be permitted, unless it appears that the critic, under the pretext
of reviewing his book, takes an opportunity of attacking the character of the author, and of
holding him up as an object of ridicule, hatred, or contempt. In other words, the critic may
say what he pleases of the literary merits or demerits of the published production of an author;
but, with respect to his personal rights relating to his reputation, the critic has no more
privilege than any other person not assuming the business of criticism." (Abbott's Practice
Reports, New Series, VI. 18.) Applying this to the case in hand: Dr. Royce, "under the pretext
of reviewing" my "book, takes an opportunity of attacking the author, and of holding him up
as an object of ridicule and contempt," if ridicule and contempt are the deservedly universal
punishment of the plagiarist and the braggart. To so unprecedented a length has he carried
this attack, as deliberately and formally, in the name of his "profession," and therefore,
by necessary implication, in the name of Harvard University itself, to "warn the liberal-minded
public" against me, precisely as one warns the general public against an impostor soliciting
alms under false pretences! This is a flagrant violation of my "personal rights relating to
my reputation"; and, therefore, according to the above judicial ruling of an American court,
Dr. Royce is guilty of wanton and unprovoked libel against one who never injured him in the
slightest degree.

In the case of Strauss versus Francis, Chief Justice Cockburn said: "The question is as to
the article as a whole.... The verdict must be upon the article as a whole, and whether, as
a whole, it is to be deemed malicious and libellous." (Foster and Finlason's Reports, IV. 1107.)
Applying this to the case in hand: Dr. Royce's ostensible review presents its darkest, most
odious, and most libellous aspect to him who most thoroughly, penetratingly, and comprehensively
studies out the inner structure of its argument as a whole, and who most intelligently compares
it with the book which it falsely professes to criticise fairly. Allow me to quote here a passage
from page 39 of "the Way out of Agnosticism" in order simply to show you how uncompromisingly
this passage, which sums up the entire results of the first half of the book and luminously
forecasts the entire conclusion of the whole, plants my system on the side of Realism:--

"The scientific, modern, or American theory of universals, which results necessarily from analysis
of the scientific method, is Scientific Realism, as opposed to Philosophical Idealism; and
it determines the subdivision of scientific philosophy into its three great departments, the
theories of Being, of Knowing, and of Doing. The scientific theory of Being results from analysis
of the Genus-in-itself, and constitutes ontology or Constructive Realism, as opposed to all
forms of Constructive Idealism. The scientific theory of Knowledge results from analysis of
the Concept, and constitutes psychology or Critical Realism, as opposed to all forms of transcendental
or Critical Idealism. The scientific theory of Conduct results from analysis of the Word, and
constitutes anthroponomy (including ethics, politics, and art in its widest sense), sociology,
or Ethical Realism, as opposed to all forms of Ethical Idealism. The scientific theory of the
universe, as the absolute union of Being, Knowing, and Doing in the One and All, results from
comprehension of these three theories in complete organic unity, and constitutes organic philosophy,
scientific theology, or Religious Realism, as opposed to all forms of Religious Idealism."

I submit this long extract to you, gentlemen, not to bore you with metaphysical speculations,
but simply to enable you, as educated men who understand the meaning of plain and straightforward
English on any subject, to follow the twistings and turnings of an extraordinarily sinuous
and disingenuous intellect, and intelligently to decide a question which needs here to be settled
clearly in your own minds: could any competent professor of philosophy, undertaking to give,
as a fair critic, a truthful account to the public of the contents of my book, read that passage,
and then, omitting all reference to the contrast there and everywhere made between realism
and idealism, honestly tell that public, without any further information at all on the subject,
that the "conclusion" of my philosophy is "essentially idealistic"?

Yet that is the conscienceless misrepresentation with which Dr. Royce prepares the way for
all that is to follow, deceives the reader at the very outset, predisposes him to believe the
preposterous charge that I "appropriated" my main theory from the great idealist Hegel, arouses
his indignation or mirth, as the case may be, at my alleged strutting about in borrowed plumes,
and so leads him at last to applaud the righteous castigation of the "professional warning,"
by which the peacock-feathers are made to fly in all directions and I myself am scourged back
among my brother-jackdaws, the impostors, charlatans, and quacks of myriad kinds. This is the
purport and the spirit of Dr. Royce's ostensible review, "as a whole." Is it the "fair criticism"
which the law allows? Or is it the "libel" which the law condemns? Is it the fair and critical
judgment which your silence shall sanction, as Harvard's official verdict on my work? Or is
it the libellous and vulgar abuse which your speech shall rebuke, as shaming Harvard more than
me by bringing the ethics and manners of the literary Bedouin into the professor's chair?

V.

But, gentlemen, the gravest aspect of Dr. Royce's ostensible review remains still to be considered.
Is libel--vulgar, violent, and brutal libel--the means by which Harvard University, represented
by one of her professors of philosophy who openly claims to address the general public in the
name of his office and of her, proposes to realize the lofty ideal of her President, and make
herself the "philosophical pioneer" for each new generation in the pursuit of truth? Is this
the welcome which she accords to serious, dignified, and not unscholarly works, giving the
results, however partially and imperfectly wrought out, of patient and independent reflection
for more than thirty years on the highest problems of human life and thought? Is this the best
sympathy and encouragement she has to offer to her own sons when they take up in earnest the
task of helping her to realize her own ideal? Is this the attitude in which she confronts the
great questions of the age, and the spirit which she aims to foster in her young men? I do
not believe it; but you alone, gentlemen, can give the authoritative answer to such queries.

When civil service reformers plead the urgent necessity of political reform, they are irrelevantly
charged by the adherents of the spoils system with being "hypocrites and pharisees." Precisely
so, when I plead the urgent necessity of philosophical reform, I am irrelevantly charged by
Dr. Royce, in effect, with being a false pretender, a plagiarist, and an impostor. The charge
is just as true in one case as in the other. But, be the charge true or untrue, the attention
of keen and candid minds is not to be diverted by this perfectly transparent device from the
main point of reform.

What is this needed philosophical reform?

Briefly, to substitute the scientific method for the idealistic method in philosophy, as the
only possible means, in this critical and sceptical age, of making ethics and religion so reasonable
as to command the continued allegiance of reasonable minds. Unphilosophized science conceives
the universe as nothing but a Machine-World; and in this conception there is no room for any
Ethical Ideal. Unscientific philosophy conceives the universe as nothing but a Thought-World;
and in this conception there is no room for any Mechanical Real. On the possibility of developing
a scientific philosophy out of the scientific method itself must depend at last the only possibility,
for reasonable men, of believing equally in the real principles of mechanical science and in
the ideal principles of ethical science. To-day the greatest obstacle to such a reasonable
belief is the "philosophical idealism" which directly contradicts it; and the greatest reform
needed in modern thought, above all in the theory of ethics, is the substitution of the scientific
method for the idealistic method in philosophy itself.

The cause of philosophical reform, indeed, cannot be long delayed by any Philistinism in those
who, by their professional position, ought to be its most ardent friends. The method of science
is destined to revolutionize philosophy--to modernize it by founding it anew upon a thoroughly
realistic and scientific theory of universals. The net result of all the physical sciences
thus far, the one fixed result to which all their other results steadily point with increasingly
evident convergence, is that the already known constitution of the real universe is that of
the Machine. This universal fixed result, and not mere individual self-consciousness, is the
necessary and only beginning-point of a constructive philosophy of Nature; for, where the special
sciences end, there universal philosophy must begin. It is the task of philosophy to-day to
show that the unquestionably mechanical constitution of the universe, instead of being the
ultimate boundary of scientific investigation, is merely the starting-point in a new series
of investigations, no less scientific than those of physical science, but far more profound;
and to show that the mechanical constitution itself, when deeply studied and comprehended,
necessarily involves the organic and the personal constitutions. In this way, and I believe
in no other way, can it be proved to the satisfaction of the modern intelligence that the Mechanical
Real itself, at bottom, includes the Ethical Ideal--that the Moral Law, the Divine Ideal itself,
is the innermost Fact of Nature. I have made, and make now, not the slightest personal "pretension";
but, finding in all my reading no outline of any such argument as this, and believing it to
be fruitful of the very noblest results, I have done my best to point out its possibilities
to other earnest searchers after truth. Not until this new field has been faithfully examined
and explored and proved to be sterile, shall I cease to recommend it to the attention of all
who would fain see reason to believe that the Ethical Ideal is no Unreality, but rather the
innermost Reality of the real universe itself. I speak only to those who have souls to hear
and to respond; let the rest listen to Dr. Royce, and be dupes of his "professional warning."
But the cause of philosophical reform will not be stayed by him or by them: the world's heart
is hungry for higher truth than idealism can discover, and will be grateful in the end to any
philosophy which shall show what mighty moral conviction, what unspeakable spiritual invigoration,
must needs grow out of comprehension of the despised Real.

These thoughts are not remote abstractions, up in the air, out of reach, of no practical value
or application; they touch the very life and soul of Harvard University. For want of such thoughts,
many of the brightest and most intellectual of her students, graduates from the philosophical
courses, go out year after year disbelieving totally in the possibility of arriving at any
fundamental "truth" whatever, even in ethics. Several years ago, the then President of the
Harvard "Philosophical Club" said in my hearing that he "saw no ground of moral obligation
anywhere in the universe"; and this declaration was apparently assented to by every one of
the fifteen or twenty members present. This very last summer, a recent graduate told me that
he left college bewildered, depressed, and "disheartened," because he saw nowhere any ground
of rational "conviction" about anything; and that it was "just the same with all the other
fellows"--that is, all his companions in the study of philosophy. It is time, high time, that
this state of things should be searchingly investigated in the interest of Harvard University
itself, the facts determined, their causes ascertained. While such a state of things prevails,
Harvard conspicuously fails to be a "philosophical pioneer" except in a distinctly retrograde
direction--conspicuously fails to discharge the highest service which she owes to the world:
namely, to send out her young graduates well armed beforehand for the battle of life with clear,
strong, and lofty moral convictions. Whatever other causes may exist for the failure, one cause
at least is certain--the self-proved and amazing inability of one of her professors of philosophy
to give an honest or intelligent reception to a thoughtful, closely reasoned, and earnest plea
for philosophical reform in this very direction, or to criticise it with anything better than
irrelevant and unparliamentary personalities, studied and systematic misrepresentation both
of the plea and of the pleader, and a demoralizing example of libel, so bitter and so extreme
as to furnish abundant ground for prosecution.

VI.

Here, gentlemen, you may very properly inquire: "Why do you not, then, prosecute Dr. Royce
in the courts, instead of bringing the case before us?" 

I shall make a point of seeing Miss Halliday twice a day. I find your housekeeper a very sensible
person. She will remain in close attendance upon the sick-room; and I must beg that there
is no quackery--no home-made remedies. I have given your housekeeper all directions as to treatment
and diet, and she has my orders to allow no one but herself in the invalid's room. There is a marked
tendency to delirium, and quiet is indispensable."

"I have said
as much myself," answered Mr. Sheldon. A prosecution
may not, I trust will not, prove necessary; for I have neither malice nor vindictiveness to
gratify, but only a resolute purpose to defend my reputation effectually against a malicious
libel, and not to permit the libeller to set up a plausible claim that, by silence and passive
submission, I "tacitly confess the justice of an official condemnation by Harvard University
of my 'philosophical pretensions.'" Except for that one phrase, "professional warning," in
Dr. Royce's attack, this appeal would never have been written, or the least notice taken of
his intrinsically puerile "criticisms." When Mr. Herbert Spencer, whom I have more than once
publicly criticised, can yet magnanimously write to me of this very book, "I do not see any
probability that it will change my beliefs, yet I rejoice that the subject should be so well
discussed,"--and Mr. William Ewart Gladstone, "I am very conscious of the force with which
you handle the subject,"--and ex-President Noah Porter, "I thank you very sincerely for sending
me a copy of your last book; I had already read it nearly twice, and found much in it very
admirable and timely,"--I could very well afford to pass over Dr. Royce's ineffectual "criticisms"
with indifference. But when he insinuates to the uninformed public that these same "criticisms"
have the weighty sanction of Harvard University, it is quite another matter. That calls upon
me to defend myself against so atrocious a calumny.

But even self-defence has its proprieties, and to these I scrupulously submit. The first step
was to send a reply to the periodical which published the attack. This was sent. At first,
Dr. Royce effusively agreed to its publication, and wrote a rejoinder to be published simultaneously
with it. Later, in alarm, he procured its rejection, and, through legal counsel, served a formal
notice upon me not to publish or to circulate it at all. The second step was to demand from
Dr. Royce a specific retraction and apology; this he contemptuously refused. The third step
was to appeal from the recalcitrant employee to the responsible employer, and to lay the case
respectfully before the supreme representatives of Harvard University itself. This I now do,
and it is entirely unnecessary to look any farther. But, in order to lay the case before you
fully, it is incumbent upon me to state the details of these proceedings with some minuteness,
and I now proceed to unfold the extraordinary tale.

VII.

Dr. Royce wound up his ostensible review with these words of bravado and of challenge: "We
must show no mercy,--as we ask none." This fierce flourish of trumpets I understood to be,
at least, a fearless public pledge of a fair hearing in the "Journal of Ethics" of which he
was one of the editors. Moreover, I conceived that a magazine expressly devoted to ethics would
be ashamed not to practise the ethics which it preached--ashamed not to grant to the accused
a freedom scrupulously made equal to that which it had already granted to the accuser. Lastly,
I was averse to litigation, and desired to use no coarser weapon, even against a calumniator
and libeller, than the sharp edge of reason itself.

Accordingly, I sought redress in the first instance from the "International Journal of Ethics."
On January 21, I mailed to Mr. S. Burns Weston, the office editor, an article in reply to Dr.
Royce's ostensible review, together with a letter in which I wrote: "I do not at all complain
of your publishing Dr. Royce's original article, although it was a most malicious and slanderous
one, and undertook (not to put too fine a point upon it) to post me publicly as a quack. If
you do not deny my indefeasible right to be heard in self-defence in the same columns, I shall
feel that I have no cause whatever to regard you or your committee as a party to the outrage,
and shall entertain no feelings towards you or towards them other than such as are perfectly
friendly. Let even slander and malice be heard, if truth shall be as free to reply." Pressing
engagements had prevented me from writing the article in season for the January number of the
"Journal of Ethics," but it was in ample season for the April number.

I sent it at last because I had full confidence in the soundness of what Thomas Jefferson said
so well: "Truth and reason can maintain themselves without the aid of coercion, if left free
to defend themselves. But then they must defend themselves. Eternal lies and sophisms on one
side, and silence on the other, are too unequal."

The "International Journal of Ethics" is under the control of an "editorial committee" of eight,
Dr. Felix Adler at the head and Dr. Royce at the end; the other six members live in Europe
and have no share in the home management. Mr. Weston is not a member of the committee, has
little editorial authority, and, in case of disagreement between the two American members,
would, as he himself expressly and frankly informed me in answer to a direct question, obey
implicitly the directions of Dr. Adler. To Dr. Adler, therefore, belongs the general and ultimate
editorial responsibility, whether legal or moral, since, according to Mr. Western's just quoted
declaration, Dr. Adler alone has actual power either to procure or to prevent publication;
while to Dr. Royce is assigned merely the special department of "theoretical ethics." Hence
Dr. Adler and Dr. Royce were jointly responsible for the original libel, the latter for writing
it, the former for publishing it; but Dr. Adler alone was editorially responsible for publishing
or refusing to publish my reply to it. It was to Dr. Adler alone, as responsible editor-in-chief
of the "Journal of Ethics," that I looked for publication of my defence, as the best possible
reparation for the wrong done in publishing the libellous attack; and I looked to him with
confidence for this partial and inadequate reparation, believing that, as head of the "ethical
culture movement," he would be anxious to conduct the "Journal of Ethics" in accordance with
the highest principles of justice, honor, and fair play.

To my astonishment and indignation, however, my manuscript, instead of being considered and
finally passed upon by Dr. Adler, was forwarded by him or by his direction to Dr. Royce! The
latter, getting wind of it, had "insisted" that it belonged to his department of "theoretical
ethics," and "claimed the right" to edit it with a rejoinder in the same issue. Nothing could
be conceived more unfair or more absurd. A libel had been published by Dr. Adler, and Dr. Adler
sent the defence against this libel to be edited by the libeller himself! Protest was in vain.
Dr Adler denied his own moral responsibility, washed his hands of the whole affair, and even
refused to enlighten himself as to his own duty (notwithstanding my urgent request that he
should do so) by taking counsel of some wise and able lawyer of his own acquaintance. Instead
of doing this, he affected to consider my self-defence against a libel as merely a reply to
an ordinary "book-criticism," made a few inquiries as to the "usual practice of journals" with
reference to book-criticisms alone, turned my article over to Dr. Royce as one on "theoretical
ethics," and permitted him to attach to it a rejoinder which reiterated the original libel
with additions and improvements, but in which he took pains to say of my reply: "I may add
that even now it does not occur to me to feel personally wounded, nor yet uneasy at Dr. Abbot's
present warmth." These words have a peculiar interest with reference to his later legal notice
against all publication or circulation of this very reply: his assumed or genuine pachydermatousness
soon gave way to fearful apprehension of its effect upon the public mind.

In no sense whatever was my reply an article on "theoretical ethics." To what part of the "theory
of ethics" belongs Dr. Royce's false personal accusation of "extravagant pretensions"? To what
part of the "theory of ethics" belongs Dr. Royce's "professional warning" against pretensions
which were never made? His false accusations and their false grounds were the main theme of
my article, and they had nothing to do with "theoretical ethics," Dr Adler and Dr. Royce to
the contrary notwithstanding. Dr. Royce had no shadow of right to set up so preposterous a
claim, and Dr. Adler had no shadow of right to yield to it, as he weakly did, thereby violating
his own undeniable obligation, as editor-in-chief, to do his utmost to repair the wrong which
he himself had done in publishing a libel. My article was avowedly nothing but a defence against
this libel, and, as such, was necessarily addressed to the responsible editor of the "Journal
of Ethics," not to the sub-editor of one of its special departments--most assuredly not to
the libeller himself. The only fair and just course was to publish this defence alone by itself,
precisely as the libel had been published alone by itself, and afterwards to allow Dr. Royce
to follow it, if he pleased, with a rejoinder in the succeeding number. I made not the slightest
objection to one rejoinder or a dozen rejoinders from him, provided the responsible editor
held the balance true, accorded as fair a hearing to the accused as he had accorded to the
accuser, and granted to each in turn an opportunity to plead his cause without interruption
by the other. I asked no more than what Dr. Royce had already received--an opportunity to enjoy
the undivided and undistracted attention of the audience for a limited time. He had had the
ear of the public for six months. Could I not have it for three?

But I regret to say that considerations of equal justice seemed to have no weight whatever
with Dr. Adler. Dr. Royce, despite his public pledge, was "asking for mercy," after all, and
got from Dr. Adler all he asked for; I asked Dr. Adler for equity alone, and could not get
even that. The sole concession made was that I might follow Dr. Royce's rejoinder with a second
reply in the same number, thus closing the case with a last word for the defence.

To this last proposal, in order not to refuse a meagre measure of justice, I consented under
protest. But the proof-sheets of Dr. Royce's rejoinder, to which I was to reply, did not reach
me till March 18, and were accompanied with a notice from the "Journal of Ethics" that my reply
must be mailed "within ten hours after receiving Royce's proof." This notice I answered as
follows:--

"The proof of Royce's rejoinder, with your notes of the 16th and 17th, arrived this morning
at 9 A.M. As I have had to be at my teaching till 3 P.M., it was obviously impossible to mail
a reply by 7 P.M. Hence I telegraphed to you at once: 'I protest against the gross injustice
of postponing my article, or of publishing this new attack without the last word you promised
me. It is impossible to write this now [i. e., within the ten hours stipulated]. If you have
any love of justice, publish my article now, and postpone the rejoinders to next issue.' Nothing
stands in the way of this, the only fair course, except Royce's insistence on his right to
deprive me of the equality of treatment which I supposed he himself guaranteed in his--'as
we ask none.' To hold back my reply to his libel for three months longer, merely because he
is afraid to let it go forth without an attempt to break its force in the same number, would
be disgracefully unjust in him and in the 'Journal.' His rejoinder is simply a fresh libel;
there is nothing in it to which I cannot easily and effectually reply. But what right is there
in refusing to me the opportunity of answering one libel at a time? Or in compelling me to
be silent nine months [from October to July], in order to save him from being silent three
months [from April to July]? It will be a bitter comment on the sincerity of the 'ethical culture
movement' to make so unethical a judgment in so grave a case as this."

But the April number of the "Journal of Ethics," nevertheless, was published without my article.
The latter was all in type, and the proof-sheets had been corrected; nothing prevented its
publication in April except (1) Dr. Royce's insistence that my reply to his first libel should
not be published at all without his second libel, and (2) Dr. Adler's weak submission to this
unjust and pusillanimous demand of his associate.

The whole matter was thus most inequitably postponed to the July number, primarily at Dr. Royce's
instigation. But I now found that I was to be refused the freedom necessary to self-defence
against the second libel--the same freedom already yielded in replying to the first. Now to
answer a libel effectively requires the freedom, not of the parliament, but of the courts.
A mere literary discussion admits of parliamentary freedom alone, and properly excludes all
reflections upon personal character. But Dr. Royce had most unparliamentarily turned his ostensible
review into a libel, and, contrary to all canons of literary discussion, had indulged himself
in reflections upon my personal character as malicious as they were false. Now the only possible
disproof of a libel is the proof that it is a libel,--that it is either untruthful, or malicious,
or both; and, since a libel is both a civil injury and a criminal offence, the proof of its
libellous character cannot be established without reflecting upon the personal character of
the libeller. Hence Dr. Royce himself, by writing a libel, had self-evidently raised the question
of his own personal character, and bound himself beforehand, by his own act, to submit with
what grace he could to the necessary consequences of that act; and to seek to shield himself
from these consequences, which he should have foreseen clearly and nerved himself to bear bravely,
was only to incur the ridicule invited by a timorous man who first strikes another and then
runs away. Dr. Adler, moreover, as the responsible editor of the "Journal of Ethics," had laid
himself, by publishing Dr. Royce's libel, under the clear moral obligation of according to
the accused the same freedom of the courts which he had already accorded to the accuser; and
to seek to escape this moral obligation was to incur the censure invited by any one who assumes
the editorial function without properly informing himself of the duties which it imposes with
reference to third parties. Both the one and the other had estopped themselves from denying
to the accused in self-defence the same freedom of the courts which they had granted to themselves
as accusers in attack.

Notwithstanding these plain facts, Dr. Royce and Dr. Adler united in denying to me the necessary
freedom of self-defence against the attack which they had united in making.

At first, Dr. Royce undertook to dictate to me beforehand the nature of my reply to his rejoinder,
and sought to restrict it to the parliamentary freedom of a purely literary discussion. Ignoring
the fact that he had himself rendered a purely literary discussion impossible by his own reflections
upon personal character, he endeavored now to restrict my defence to a purely literary discussion
of what, with amusing deficiency in the sense of humor, he considered to be his "criticisms";
whereas these pointless and ignorant criticisms had no importance whatever except as leading
up to his "professional warning." The only object of a reply to his rejoinder was to expose
its true character as a second libel, and thereby make plain to the dullest mind the outrage
of his "professional warning." Evidently fearing this, and being anxious to prevent the exposure,
he sent to me through Mr. Weston, who called upon me for the purpose on April 15, the following
unspeakable document, apparently without a suspicion that it pricked the bubble of his previous
iridescent pledge to "ask no mercy":--

     MEMORANDUM OF APR. 13, 1891.

     1. Dr. Abbot's article must be in Mr. Weston's hands in MS.
     by June 1, for issue in the July No., if possible.

     2. This article must not exceed, in actual number of words,
     Prof. Royce's last rejoinder.

     3. Prof. Royce is not to reply to the above article of Dr.
     Abbot before or simultaneously with its publication in the
     "Journal of Ethics"; and the controversy is thus to be
     closed in the "Journal" by Dr. Abbot.

     4. Dr. Abbot's article is to be strictly a rejoinder, is not
     to raise essentially new issues, is not to assault any
     further his opponent's personal character, is to be
     parliamentary in form, and free from personally abusive
     language. Otherwise it is perfectly free as to plainness of
     speech.

     5. Prof. Royce is to see this article at once, and before it
     goes to the printer.

     6. Should Prof. Royce, after seeing the paper, object to the
     article as "not in conformity with the conditions of No. 4
     (above)," then, but only then, the article is to be
     submitted, before publication, to the judgment of some
     impartial friend or friends of both the disputants, such
     friend or friends to be chosen as promptly as possible, and
     by agreement, and to arbitrate the question, "Whether Dr.
     Abbot's final rejoinder is in conformity with the conditions
     of this present memorandum?" The arbitrator or arbitrators
     may be any person or persons agreable [sic] to the wishes
     of both the disputants, as determined in case the mentioned
     objection of Prof. Royce should be made, but not otherwise.

     7. Should Prof. Royce not object to the article, or should
     he not formally object on the grounds mentioned, then the
     article of Dr. Abbot is to close the controversy in the
     "Journal of Ethics."

     8. Should Dr. Abbot not accept the conditions of the
     present memorandum, he is at liberty to withdraw his paper,
     or else to let both the papers now in type appear as they
     are, at his pleasure.

     [Signed]      J. R.

It is difficult to conceive the state of mind in which so extraordinary a document as this
could have originated. My answer to Dr. Royce's officious interference was a short and dry
rejection in toto. Dr. Royce was not the responsible editor of the "Journal of Ethics," and
had no power to dictate any conditions of publication whatever. That a libeller should actually
presume to dictate to the libelled the terms of his defence, to demand that this defence should
be submitted to himself in advance of publication for approval or disapproval, and, in case
of disapproval, to invoke a board of referees for the sole purpose of enforcing his own arbitrary
and preposterous "conditions,"--this was too exquisitely absurd. But there was method in the
madness. The central aim of the "Memorandum" is clear on its face: namely, to refuse the forensic
freedom necessary to self-defence against a libel, and to concede only the parliamentary freedom
proper to a purely literary discussion. Since, however, the only object of my writing at all
was to expose his rejoinder as a second libel, and since the central aim of the "Memorandum"
was to defeat this very object, nothing could be plainer than this: that Dr. Royce, having
been guilty of two unprovoked and malicious libels, now sought to prevent the exposure of his
guilt by suppressing the necessary freedom of self-defence. For, I repeat, the only possible
defence against a libel is to prove that it is a libel, and this cannot be done without reflecting
upon the "personal character" of the libeller. It was no fault of mine that he had himself
rendered a "parliamentary" discussion impossible; it was no fault of mine that he had made
his own "personal character" the real point at issue; it was no fault of mine that he now betrayed
his secret alarm, uttered a cry for "mercy," and convicted himself out of his own mouth, in
his extraordinary and indescribable "Memorandum." That "Memorandum" tells the whole story.

On the failure of Dr. Royce's very injudicious attempt at dictation, Dr. Adler found himself
compelled to assume the editorial power and responsibility, which he ought to have assumed
and exercised in the first instance by refusing publication to Dr. Royce's original libel.
But, yielding to Dr. Royce's influence, he took the same position, and still tried to shield
the libeller from the just and lawful consequences of his libel. No principle is more firmly
established in the public conscience, as interpreted by the common law, than that the fact
of an attack by A involves the right of self-defence by B. Whoever, therefore, has permitted
an attack which he might have prevented is bound to permit the self-defence, also; and Dr.
Adler, having granted to Dr. Royce the freedom of libelling me, was bound to grant to me the
equal freedom of defending myself against the libel. But this equal freedom Dr. Adler denied.
After some fruitless correspondence, I wrote to him on May 4 as follows: "I require the freedom,
not of 'parliament,' but of the courts--freedom to present my 'facts,' and no less to draw
my 'inferences'--freedom to array my evidence, and no less to make my pleading. By publishing
his new libel, you estop yourself from denying me this freedom. If you do deny it, I withdraw
altogether and seek justice and redress elsewhere. I ask only what is self-evidently fair:
(1) equal space with Dr. Royce, (2) equal freedom with Dr. Royce, (3) no further rejoinders
by Dr. Royce, and (4) no editorial mention of the matter at all from the 'Journal' itself."
To this letter Dr. Adler merely telegraphed his final reply on May 6 in these brief terms:
"Regret your insistence on freedom of courts--parliamentary freedom open to you." This ended
the matter, so far as the "Journal of Ethics" was concerned, in Dr. Adler's explicit denial
of a full and fair hearing in its columns to a party calumniated and libelled by one of his
own contributors and a member of his own "editorial committee."

Negotiations, it is true, for the publication of my reply in the July number were a little
later re-opened by Dr. Adler, on receiving advice from a legal friend of his own that to publish
it would be his wisest course; but he himself broke them off on a trivial pretext, after receiving
contrary advice from Dr. Royce's counsel, together with a copy of the legal protest sent to
me personally. Thus Dr. Royce himself, recalling his original consent, procured the final rejection
by the "Journal of Ethics" of my reply to his own attack. On June 19, I was notified that the
July number had been made up without it.

But already, on June 9, I had received from Mr. J. B. Warner, acting as Dr. Royce's counsel,
this formal protest against any other use whatever of my reply: "On Dr. Royce's behalf, I must
warn you that he protests against the publication or any circulation of it, in its present
shape, and must point out to you that it may, if circulated, entail a serious legal responsibility."
To this strangely impolitic and utterly futile attempt to intimidate me in the defence of my
own reputation, I chose to offer not the slightest resistance. The protest only facilitated
that defence. How could a libeller more conspicuously put himself in the wrong, or more effectually
ruin his own evil cause in all eyes, than by trying to gag the man he had injured? First, to
prevent publication in the "Journal of Ethics" of the very reply he had publicly and defiantly
challenged, and then to suppress all circulation of a few privately printed copies of it by
means of legal threats: if Dr. Royce could afford to commit such blunders, why should I shield
him from himself? "Whom the gods destroy, they first make mad."

Before proceeding to any more energetic measures, however, in order to vindicate my reputation,
I was anxious to offer to Dr. Royce an opportunity of doing me justice in a manner which should
be consistent with full vindication, yet should involve the least possible publicity and the
least possible mortification to himself. Accordingly, on June 20, I wrote to Mr. Warner thus:
"I beg leave to enclose a Card, which, if returned to me within a week from to-day, unchanged,
dated, and signed by Dr. Royce, and if actually published in the October number of the 'Journal,'
will render unnecessary further measures of self-vindication as now contemplated. I send this
because you assured me that Dr. Royce disclaims all malice in the publication of the original
article I complain of, and because I am willing to test the sincerity of his disclaimer before
resorting to other measures for my self-protection. I expect you, who came to me in the character
of a pacificator, and who expressed a creditable desire, in which I fully join, for the settlement
of this trouble in some way which shall occasion no scandal to Harvard College, to exert your
utmost influence with Dr. Royce to persuade him to perform this act of manifest justice to
me. A frank retraction and apology, when unjust charges have been made as now, is not dishonorable
and ought not to be humiliating; and I shall consider Dr. Royce's action in this matter as
showing the sincerity or insincerity of his disclaimer of all malice in his original article."
The enclosed paper above mentioned was this:--

     A CARD.

     CAMBRIDGE, June --, 1891.

     I. I admit that I have no knowledge whatever of any
     "extravagant pretensions" made by Dr. Abbot "as to the
     originality and profundity of his still unpublished system
     of philosophy."

     II. I admit that Dr. Abbot did not, consciously or
     unconsciously, "borrow his theory of universals from Hegel,"
     or "sin against the most obvious demands of literary
     property-rights."

     III.

     IV. I authorize the publication of this retraction and
     apology in the next number of the "International Journal of
     Ethics" without note or comment.

In his answer of June 24, Mr. Warner informed me that Dr. Royce had gone to Denver, and wrote:
"As for the Card which you propose, I will leave Dr. Royce to make his own answer after he
has seen it. I will say, however, for my own part, that, while he has always been ready to
disclaim any desire to injure you personally, I think that his opinions concerning your philosophical
system and its origin are unchanged, and he is not likely to retract them. I must say, too,
that you have put your Card in a form in which you could not have expected Dr. Royce to sign
it, and I do not regard it as any step, on your part, toward a pacific settlement, nor think
your demand a reasonable one to make of a self-respecting man."

The next day, June 25, I wrote to Mr. Warner: "I ought distinctly to deny that my rejected
article is 'a libellous paper.' Its statements are true; its motive is not malice, but a self-evident
purpose to defend myself against Dr. Royce's libel; and, even if it should be concluded to
come under any legal definition of 'libel,' I maintain that it is self-evidently a 'justifiable
libel.' If I pay any heed to your notice, it is merely because your notice strengthens my case.--You
do not mention when Dr. Royce will return from Denver; but, because my purpose in enclosing
to you that Card is in good faith a pacific one, I will wait a reasonable time for his return
beyond the date I mentioned. You will not judge the character of that Card accurately, and
you cannot give sound or salutary advice to your client, if you ignore the libellous character
of his original article. I do not see how 'a self-respecting man' could ever have written such
a paper; but, if he did it inadvertently and not maliciously, he would certainly do one of
two things: (1) either submit courageously, unflinchingly, and without legal protest, to the
reply it challenged and evoked, or (2) manfully retract charges demonstrated, as these have
been, to be false. Have you really a different idea of 'self-respect'? Certainly not, for you
are an honorable gentleman. Be this as it may, I warn you not to persist in considering that
Card as other than a pacific step on my part, if you desire to counsel your client to his own
good, or to prove yourself a real friend to Harvard College. I say this in good faith."

To this, on July 2, Mr. Warner replied: "Dr. Royce has returned, and I have submitted to him
the Card which you have prepared. As I anticipated, Dr. Royce says that he cannot sign it,
nor can I advise him to do so. It goes far beyond any disavowal of malice or personal hostility,
and it amounts to a retraction of the opinions which he actually holds about your philosophical
system, and that retraction you surely cannot expect him to make. Dr. Royce has again expressed
to me his regret that the form of his article should have wounded you, and he is entirely ready
to disavow any intention of wounding you."

On July 11, I wrote in answer: "Most certainly I do not expect, or wish, that Dr. Royce should
disavow any philosophical 'opinions' he may hold. What I complain of is a misstatement of fact,
demonstrated to be such, which I believe to have had its origin in a spirit of malicious detraction,
and to be now persevered in from no other cause. In my reply to his article, which he himself
challenged and then pusillanimously suppressed, he has had abundant means of information. If
he now refuses to correct a misstatement which grossly injures me, after he has been informed
of the truth, the refusal admits of but one interpretation, and throws a satirical light on
the merely private 'regret' he professes. Inasmuch, however, as you have objected (quite unnecessarily,
as I think) to the 'form' of the Card I sent you, and inasmuch as I intend to leave no room
for doubt as to Dr. Royce's real animus in this affair, I propose now that he send me such
a retraction and apology as you yourself shall deem adequate, fitting, and due. In your letter
of June 9, you admitted that Dr. Royce had 'transgressed the limits of courteous discussion'
and that you 'do not defend in all respects the tone of the review.' It is plain enough that
you, Dr. Royce's own counsel, perceive at least something improper, something that ought to
be retracted and apologized for. You are, then, I submit, bound to do what you can to right
the wrong, which is not at all done by Dr. Royce's profuse, but private, disclaimers. He professes
to bear no malice. Very well, then: let him make reparation for the wrong he has committed.
He owes it to himself, if he considers himself a gentleman, certainly to his position in Harvard
College, to send me some paper, specifying what he himself regrets in his own article, with
authority to publish this paper in the 'Journal of Ethics.' The Card I sent sufficiently indicates
what I think is due to me; if Dr. Royce, in other language, covers the same ground, it will
be accepted as satisfactory. That is the very least that a gentleman would do under the circumstances.
You cannot object to this proposal on account of its 'form'; if either you or he objects to
it at all, it must be on account of its substance. Certainly you cannot affect to consider
it as other than 'pacific.' I shall await your answer to it as to the only 'pacific step on
my part' which remains possible to me."

In reply to this letter, on July 24, Mr. Warner wrote: "I forwarded your letter of July 11
to Dr. Royce, and he has written a reply to me which I think it best to enclose as he wrote
it." In this enclosed letter, dated July 14, Dr. Royce first re-affirmed, in substance, the
truth of his false and ridiculous accusation of plagiarism from Hegel, and then wrote as follows:
"Now as to my feeling concerning what was regrettable in my article. I repeat once more--regrettable,
in my eyes, was the manner of the article in so far as it actually gave unnecessary pain to
Dr. Abbot. And I regard any pain as unnecessary that may have been due, not to my objectively
justified opinion of Dr. Abbot's work (an opinion which I cannot alter in the least), but to
any severity of expression that may not have been absolutely needful to give form to this opinion
itself. Dr. Abbot's reply has shown him to be not merely alive to the strong difference of
opinion that separates us, but personally offended by an attack that was intended to be indeed
severe, but directed wholly to matters of professional, but not of personal concern. This attitude
of Dr. Abbot's I regret, and, in so far as I am to blame for it, I am willing to express my
regret publicly."

This letter of Dr. Royce is, in effect, a deliberate and unqualified re-affirmation of every
fact as alleged, and every inference as drawn, in his original libel--a deliberate and contemptuous
re-affirmation of the whole system of elaborate misrepresentation which constitutes it one
tissue of libel from beginning to end. Nothing whatever in the substance of his article is
retracted or regretted; nothing is "regrettable" even in its form, except vaguely, hypothetically,
and conditionally; the only thing Dr. Royce "regrets," as a fact, is that his "objectively
justified" and "intentionally severe attack" should have given needless "personal offence"
and "unnecessary pain" to its object! This deliberate and contemptuous refusal to recall, to
modify, or to apologize for any of the false accusations he has made against me is, I submit,
demonstration of the malice which originally prompted them, and now moves him to maintain them;
nothing further is needed to make their malicious character perfectly plain, and to prove the
insincerity of his disclaimers of malice. But Dr. Royce seriously mistakes the nature of the
effect produced by his "attack," when he affects to consider it as the quite needless excitation
of excessive sensitiveness. If a gentleman in a crowd discovers his nearest neighbor engaged
in filching his pocket-book, and at once hands the culprit over to the police, it would hardly
be graphic to describe his frame of mind as needless "personal offence" or "unnecessary pain";
and the expressions are no more graphic as to my own frame of mind, when I discover Dr. Royce
endeavoring to filch from me my reputation in the name of Harvard University. It is not always
safe to reckon on the absence, in parties confessedly "attacked," of all capacity for moral
indignation, or all capacity for moral self-defence.

In reply to Mr. Warner, August 4, I wrote as follows: "Permit me further to say, with regard
to Dr. Royce's letter, that I can only interpret it as a distinct refusal to retract his accusation
that I have made 'extravagant pretensions as to the originality and profundity of my still
unpublished system of philosophy'--a distinct refusal to retract his accusation that I have
'borrowed my theory of universals from Hegel'--a distinct refusal to retract his 'professional
warning' based upon these accusations. These were the chief points of my Card, and I note the
refusal implied by Dr. Royce's evasive letter. But I decline to accept his plea of 'conscientiousness'
in maintaining the accusation as to Hegel. I might as well plead 'conscientiousness' in maintaining
an accusation that Dr. Royce assassinated Abraham Lincoln, in face of the evidence that John
Wilkes Booth was the assassin."

Here the correspondence closed. These fevers rarely prove fatal unless there is some predisposing
cause."

"In this case there was none."

"You speak rather confidently, Mr. Sheldon, as a non-professional man."

"I speak with a certain amount of professional knowledge. I knew Tom Halliday for many years."

Mr.
Sheldon forebore to state that Tom Halliday had died in his house, and had been attended by him.
It is, perhaps, only natural that Philip Sheldon, the stockbroker
of repute, should wish to escape identification with Philip Sheldon,
the unsuccessful dentist of Bloomsbury.

After a little more conversational skirmishing, the confidential physician of the Prudential
Step Assurance Company agreed to consider that Mr. Halliday's constitution had been in no
manner compromised by his early death, and to pass Charlotte's life. The motives for effecting
the insurance were briefly touched upon in Mr. Greenwood's letter of introduction, and appeared
very proper and feasible in the eyes of the directors; so, after a delay of a few days, the young
lady found herself accepted, and Mr. Sheldon put away among his more important papers a large
oblong envelope, containing a policy of assurance on his stepdaughter's life for five thousand
pounds.

He did not, however, stop here, but made assurance doubly sure by effecting a second insurance
upon the same young life with the Widow's and Orphan's Hope Society, within a few days of the first
transaction.

CHAPTER I.

AT
COTENOIR.

Beaubocage, near Vevinord, March 15, 186--.

My darling
Lotta,--As you extorted from me a solemn pledge that I would write
you a full and detailed account of my adventures, I seat myself in
Mademoiselle Lenoble's pretty little turret-chamber, in the hope of
completing the first instalment of my work before papa or Gustave
summons me to prepare for a drive and visit to the Convent of the
Sacred Heart, which, I believe, has been planned for to-day.

What
am I to tell you, dear, and how shall I begin my story?

II. He has sought to give credibility and respectability to this false and libellous publication
by invoking the authority, not of reason or truth, but of his mere "professional" position
as professor in Harvard University, thereby artfully suggesting and insinuating to the uninformed
public that Harvard University sustains him in his attack; whereas, in conferring upon me the
degree of doctor of philosophy and in committing to me formerly the conduct of an advanced
course of philosophical instruction, Harvard University has given emphatic testimony to the
contrary.

III. Repudiating his bold promise to "ask no mercy," he has sought, with incredible cowardice
and meanness, to deprive me of all opportunity of being heard in self-defence, first, by excluding
from the "International Journal of Ethics" my perfectly reasonable reply to what he himself
confesses to have been an "intentionally severe attack," and, secondly, by threatening me through
his counsel with legal prosecution, if I publish it anywhere else or circulate it at all.

IV. Lastly, when, after all this, in order to spare him the mortification and disgrace of a
public exposure, and in order to prevent Harvard University from incurring any possible discredit
on account of his personal misconduct, I proposed to him a pacific settlement of the whole
affair through a simple retraction of his calumnious accusations, and that, too, in words of
his own choosing, he made no answer but a stubborn and contumelious re-affirmation of the original
libel.

I submit that these acts of wrong constitute conduct unbecoming a gentleman, a man of honor,
or a professor in Harvard University, and justly entitle me to redress at your hands. This
appeal has not been made hastily or without a patient and long-protracted effort to secure
justice in other ways. Dr. Royce has succeeded hitherto, during many months, in defeating that
effort; but now the appeal lies to those whom he cannot control, and now he must abide your
judgment. Asking neither less nor more than justice, and believing that you will recognize
justice as Harvard's highest law,

I have the honor to remain, gentlemen, in devoted loyalty to our Alma Mater,

Your obedient servant,

FRANCIS E. ABBOT.

CAMBRIDGE, Oct. 1, 1891.
