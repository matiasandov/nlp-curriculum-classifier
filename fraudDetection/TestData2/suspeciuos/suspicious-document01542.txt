In the beginning the guide is instinct, and the act of trust is automatic. But with the dawn
of reason the thinker has to justify his faith; to convince himself that life is sincere, that
there is worth-whileness in being, or in seeking to be; that there is order in creation, laws
which can be discovered, processes which can be applied. Just as the babe trusts life when
it gropes for its mother's breast, so the most skeptical of scientists trusts it when he declares
that water is made of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen, and sets it down for a certainty
that this will always be so--that he is not being played with by some sportive demon, who will
today cause H2O to behave like water, and tomorrow like benzine.

Nature's Insurgent Son

Life has laws, which it is possible to ascertain; and with each bit of knowledge acquired,
the environment is changed, the life becomes a new thing. Consider, for example, what a different
place the world became to the man who discovered that the force which laid the forest in ashes
could be tamed and made to warm a cave and make wild grains nutritious! In other words, man
can create life, he can make the world and himself into that which his reason decides it ought
to be. The means by which he does this is the most magical of all the tools he has invented
since his arboreal ancestor made the first club; the tool of experimental science--and when
one considers that this weapon has been understood and deliberately employed for but two or
three centuries, he realizes that we are indeed only at the beginning of human evolution.

To take command of life, to replace instincts by reasoned and deliberate acts, to make the
world a conscious and ordered product--that is the task of man. Sir Ray Lankester has set this
forth with beautiful precision in his book, "The Kingdom of Man". We are, at this time, in
an uncomfortable and dangerous transition stage, as a child playing with explosives. This child
has found out how to alter his environment in many startling ways, but he does not yet know
why he wishes to alter it, nor to what purpose. He finds that certain things are uncomfortable,
and these he proceeds immediately to change. Discovering that grain fermented dispels boredom,
he creates a race of drunkards; discovering that foods can be produced in profusion, and prepared
in alluring combinations, he makes himself so many diseases that it takes an encyclopedia to
tell about them. Discovering that captives taken in war can be made to work, he makes a procession
of empires, which are eaten through with luxury and corruption, and fall into ruins again.

This is Nature's way; she produces without limit, groping blindly, experimenting ceaselessly,
eliminating ruthlessly. It takes a million eggs to produce one salmon; it has taken a million
million men to produce one idea--algebra, or the bow and arrow, or democracy. Nature's present
impulse appears as a rebellion against her own methods; man, her creature, will emancipate
himself from her law, will save himself from her blindness and her ruthlessness. He is "Nature's
insurgent son"; but, being the child of his mother, goes at the task in her old blundering
way. Some men are scheduled to elimination because of defective eyesight; they are furnished
with glasses, and the breeding of defective eyes begins. The sickly or imbecile child would
perish at once in the course of Nature; it is saved in the name of charity, and a new line
of degenerates is started.
