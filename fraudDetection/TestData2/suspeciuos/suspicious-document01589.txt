Cartwright, whose appetite for vengeance was but whetted by his first success, had never lost
sight of the movements of his victim; and now he had followed him to the place of his embarkation,
with an eager but undefined purpose of working him some further and more deadly mischief. Stealthily
he hovered about the house which sheltered the unconscious object of his malicious hate, plotting,
as he afterwards confessed, the wildest schemes for satiating his revenge. Several times he
made excuses for calling at the hotel, in the hope of observing the nature of the premises,
taking care, however, to avoid being seen by Mr. Harvey or his family. A fortnight passed away,
and the day of departure of the emigrants arrived without the slightest opportunity occurring
for the gratification of his purposes. The ship was leaving her berth; most of the passengers
were on board; Mrs. Harvey and the children, with nearly the whole of the luggage, were already
safely in the vessel; Mr. Harvey only remained on shore to purchase some trifling article,
and to settle his bill at the hotel on removing his last trunk. Cartwright had tracked him
all day; he could not attack him in the street; and he finally followed him to the hotel, in
order to wreak his vengeance on him in his private apartment, of the situation of which he
had informed himself.

Harvey entered the hotel first, and before Cartwright came up, he had gone down a passage into
the bar to settle the bill which he had incurred for the last two days. Not aware of this circumstance,
Cartwright, in the bustle which prevailed, went up stairs to Mr. Harvey's bedroom and parlor,
in neither of which, to his surprise, did he find the occupant; and he turned away discomfited.
Passing along towards the chief staircase, he perceived a room of which the door was open,
and that on the table there lay a gold watch and appendages. Nobody was in the apartment: the
gentleman who occupied it had only a few moments before gone to his bed-chamber for a brief
space. Quick as lightning a diabolical thought flashed through the brain of the villain, who
had been baffled in his original intentions. He recollected that he had seen a trunk in Harvey's
room, and that the keys hung in the lock. An inconceivably short space of time served for him
to seize the watch, to deposit it at the bottom of Harvey's trunk, and to quit the hotel by
a back stair, which led by a short cut to the harbor. The whole transaction was done unperceived,
and the wretch at least departed unnoticed.

Having finished his business at the bar, Mr. Harvey repaired to his room, locked his trunk,
which, being of a small and handy size, he mounted on his shoulder, and proceeded to leave
the house by the back stair, in order to get as quickly as possible to the vessel. Little recked
he of the interruption which was to be presented to his departure. He had got as far as the
foot of the stair with his burden, when he was overtaken by a waiter, who declared that he
was going to leave the house clandestinely without settling accounts. It is proper to mention
that Mr. Harvey had incurred the enmity of this particular waiter in consequence of having,
out of his slender resources, given him too small a gratuity on the occasion of paying a former
bill, and not aware of the second bill being settled, the waiter was rather glad to have an
opportunity of charging him with a fraudulent design. "Thou shalt know," said the alderman, seizing
his arm to drag him to the Counter prison, but Giles resisted. Wat Ball struck at Sir John's arm
with his wooden sword, and as the alderman shouted for the watch
and city-guard, the lads on their side raised their cry, "Prentices
and Clubs!

Flat-caps and Clubs!" Master Headley, struggling along, met his colleague, with his gown torn into
shreds from his back, among a host of wildly yelling lads, and panting,
"Help, help, brother Headley!"

 A chambermaid
came hurriedly down the stair, exclaiming that some one had stolen a gold watch from No. 17,
and that nobody ought to leave the house till it was found. The landlord also, moved by the
hurricane which had been raised, made his appearance at the spot where Harvey was interrupted
in his exit.

"What on earth is all this noise about, John?" inquired the landlord of the waiter.

"Why, sir, I thought it rather strange for any gentleman to leave the house by the back way,
carrying his own portmanteau, and so I was making a little breeze about it, fearing he had
not paid his bill, when all of a sudden Sally rushes down the stair and says as how No. 17
has missed his gold watch, and that no one should quit the hotel."

No. 17, an old, dry-looking military gentlemen, in a particularly high passion, now showed
himself on the scene, uttering terrible threats of legal proceedings against the house for
the loss he had sustained.

Harvey was stupified and indignant, yet he could hardly help smiling at the pother. "What,"
said he, "have I to do with all this? I have paid for everything; I am surely entitled to go
away if I like. Remember, that if I lose my passage to Boston, you shall answer for it."

"I very much regret detaining you, sir," replied the keeper of the hotel; "but you hear there
has been a robbery committed within the last few minutes, and as it will be proper to search
every one in the house, surely you, who are on the point of departure, will have no objections
to be searched first, and then be at liberty to go?"

There was something so perfectly reasonable in all this, that Harvey stepped into an adjoining
parlor, and threw open his trunk for inspection, never doubting that his innocence would be
immediately manifest.

The waiter, whose mean rapacity had been the cause of the detention, acted as examiner. He
pulled one article after another out of the trunk, and at length--horror of horrors!--held
up the missing watch with a look of triumph and scorn!

"Who put that there?" cried Harvey in an agony of mind which can be better imagined than described.
"Who has done me this grievous wrong? I know nothing as to how the watch came into my trunk."

No one answered this appeal. All present stood for a moment in gloomy silence.

"Sir," said the landlord to Harvey on recovering from his surprise, "I am sorry for you. For
the sake of a miserable trifle, you have brought ruin and disgrace on yourself. This is a matter
which concerns the honor of my house, and cannot stop here. However much it is against my feelings,
you must go before a magistrate."

"By all means," added No. 17, with the importance of an injured man. "A pretty thing that one's
watch is not safe in a house like this!"

"John, send Boots for a constable," said the landlord.

Harvey sat with his head leaning on his hand. A deadly cold perspiration trickled down his
brow. His heart swelled and beat as if it would burst. What should he do? His whole prospects
were in an instant blighted. "Oh God! do not desert a frail and unhappy being: give me strength
to face this new and terrible misfortune," was a prayer he internally uttered. A little revived,
he started to his feet, and addressing himself to the landlord, he said, "Take me to a magistrate
instantly, and let us have this diabolical plot unraveled. I court inquiry into my character
and conduct."

"It is no use saying any more about it," answered the landlord; "here is Boots with a constable,
and let us all go away together to the nearest magistrate. Boots, carry that trunk. John and
Sally, you can follow us."

And so the party, trunk and all, under the constable as conductor, adjourned to the house of
a magistrate in an adjacent street. There the matter seemed so clear a case of felony--robbery
in a dwelling-house--that Harvey, all protestations to the contrary, was fully committed for
trial at the ensuing March assizes, then but a few days distant.

At the period at which these incidents occurred, I was a young man going on my first circuits.
I had not as yet been honored with perhaps more than three or four briefs, and these only in
cases so slightly productive of fees, that I was compelled to study economy in my excursions.
Instead of taking up my residence at an inn when visiting ------, a considerable seaport, where
the court held its sittings, I dwelt in lodgings kept by a widow lady, where, at a small expense,
I could enjoy perfect quietness, free from interruption.

On the evening after my arrival on the March circuit of the year 17--, I was sitting in my
lodgings perusing a new work on criminal jurisprudence, when the landlady, after tapping at
the door, entered my room.

"I am sorry to trouble you, sir," said she; "but a lady has called to see you about a very
distressing law case--very distressing indeed, and a very strange case it is too. Only, if
you could be so good as to see her?"

"Who is she?"

"All I know about it is this: she is a Mrs. Harvey. She and her husband and children were to
sail yesterday for Boston. All were on board except the husband; and he, on leaving the large
hotel over the way, was taken up for a robbery. Word was in the evening sent by the prisoner
to his wife to come on shore, with all her children and the luggage; and so she came back in
the pilot boat, and was in such a state of distress, that my brother, who is on the preventive
service, and saw her land, took pity on her, and had her and her children and things taken
to a lodging on the quay. As my brother knows that we have a London lawyer staying here, he
has advised the poor woman to come and consult you about the case."

"Well, I'll see what can be done. Please desire the lady to step in."

A lady was shortly shown in. She had been pretty, and was so still, but anxiety was pictured
in her pale countenance. Her dress was plain, but not inelegant; and altogether she had a neat
and engaging appearance.

"Be so good as to sit down," said I, bowing; "and tell me all you would like to say."

The poor woman burst into tears; but afterwards recovering herself, she told me pretty nearly
the whole of her history and that of her husband.

Lawyers have occasion to see so much duplicity, that I did not all at once give assent to the
idea of Harvey being innocent of the crime of which he stood charged.

"There is something perfectly inexplicable in the case," I observed, "and it would require
sifting. Your husband, I hope has always borne a good character?"

"Perfectly so. He was no doubt unfortunate in business; but he got his certificate on the first
examination; and there are many who would testify to his uprightness." And here again my client
broke into tears, as if overwhelmed with her recollections and prospects.

"I think I recollect Mr. Harvey's shop," said I soothingly. "It seemed a very respectable concern;
and we must see what can be done. Keep up your spirits; the only fear I have arises from the
fact of Judge A ---- being on the bench. He is usually considered severe, and if exculpatory
evidence fail, your husband may run the risk of being--transported." A word of more terrific
import, with which I was about to conclude, stuck unuttered in my throat "Have you employed
an attorney?" I added.

"No; I have done nothing as yet, but apply to you, to beg of you to be my husband's counsel."

"Well, that must be looked to. I shall speak to a local agent, to prepare and work out the
case; and we shall all do our utmost to get an acquittal. To-morrow I will call on your husband
in prison."

Many thanks were offered by the unfortunate lady, and she withdrew.

I am not going to inflict on the reader a detailed account of this remarkable trial, which
turned, as barristers would say, on a beautiful point of circumstantial evidence. Along with
the attorney, a sharp enough person in his way, I examined various parties at the hotel, and
made myself acquainted with the nature of the premises. The more we investigated, however,
the more dark and mysterious--always supposing Harvey's innocence--did the whole case appear.
There was not one redeeming trait in the affair, except Harvey's previous good character; and
good character, by the law of England, goes for nothing in opposition to facts proved to the
satisfaction of a jury. It was likewise most unfortunate that A ---- was to be the presiding
judge. This man possessed great forensic acquirements, and was of spotless private character;
but, like the majority of lawyers of that day--when it was no extraordinary thing to hang twenty
men in a morning at Newgate--he was a staunch stickler for the gallows as the only effectual
reformer and safeguard of the social state. At this time he was but partially recovered from
a long and severe indisposition, and the traces of recent suffering were distinctly apparent
on his pale and passionless features.

Harvey was arraigned in due form; the evidence was gone carefully through; and everything,
so far as I was concerned, was done that man could do. But at the time to which I refer, counsel
was not allowed to address the court on behalf of the prisoner--a practice since introduced
from Scotland--and consequently I was allowed no opportunity to draw the attention of the jury
to the total want of any direct evidence of the prisoner's guilt. Harvey himself tried to point
out the unlikelihood of his being guilty; but he was not a man gifted with dialectic qualities,
and his harangue fell pointless on the understandings of the twelve common-place individuals
who sat in the jury-box. The judge finally proceeded to sum the evidence, and this he did emphatically
against the prisoner--dwelling with much force on the suspicious circumstance of a needy man
taking up his abode at an expensive fashionable hotel; his furtive descent from his apartments
by the back stairs; the undoubted fact of the watch being found in his trunk; the improbability
of any one putting it there but himself; and the extreme likelihood that the robbery was effected
in a few moments of time by the culprit, just as he passed from the bar of the hotel to the
room which he had occupied. The curfew rang, but there were special privileges on May Eve, and
the game went on louder than ever.
There was far too much noise for any one to hear the town crier,
who went along jingling his bell, and shouting, "O yes! O yes! O yes! The
evidence, in short, is irresistible; and if the just and necessary provisions of the law are
not enforced in such very plain cases, then society will be dissolved, and security for property
there will be none. Gentlemen, retire and make up your verdict."

The jury were not disposed to retire. After communing a few minutes together, one of them stood
up and delivered the verdict: it was Guilty! The judge assumed the crowning badge of the judicial
potentate--the black cap; and the clerk of arraigns asked the prisoner at the bar, in the usual
form, if he had anything to urge why sentence of death should not be passed upon him.

Poor Harvey! I durst scarcely look at him. As the sonorous words fell on his ear, he was grasping
nervously with shaking hands at the front of the dock. He appeared stunned, bewildered, as
a man but half-awakened from a hideous dream might be supposed to look. He had comprehended,
though he had scarcely heard, the verdict; for on the instant, the voice which but a few years
before sang to him by the brook side, was ringing through his brain, and he could recognize
the little pattering feet of his children, as, sobbing and clinging to their shrieking mother's
dress, she and they were hurried out of court The clerk, after a painful pause, repeated the
solemn formula. By a strong effort the doomed man mastered his agitation; his pale countenance
lighted up with indignant fire, and firm and self-possessed, he thus replied to the fearful
interrogatory:--

"Much could I say in the name, not of mercy, but of justice, why the sentence about to be passed
on me should not be pronounced; but nothing, alas! that will avail me with you, pride-blinded
ministers of death. You fashion to yourselves--out of your own vain conceits do you fashion--modes
and instruments, by the aid of which you fondly imagine to invest yourselves with attributes
which belong only to Omniscience; and now I warn you--and it is a voice from the tomb, in whose
shadow I already stand, which addresses you--that you are about to commit a most cruel and
deliberate murder."

He paused, and the jury looked into each other's eyes for the courage they could not find in
their own hearts. The voice of conscience spoke, but was only for a few moments audible. The
suggestions that what grave parliaments, learned judges, and all classes of "respectability"
sanctioned, could not be wrong, much less murderous or cruel, silenced the "still, small" tones,
and tranquilized the startled jurors.

"Prisoner at the bar," said the judge with his cold, calm voice of destiny, "I cannot listen
to such observations: you have been found guilty of a heinous offence by a jury of your countrymen
after a patient trial. With that finding I need scarcely say I entirely agree. I am as satisfied
of your guilt as if I had seen you commit the act with my own bodily eyes. The circumstance
of your being a person who, from habits and education, should have been above committing so
base a crime, only aggravates your guilt. However, no matter who or what you have been, you
must expiate your offence on the scaffold. The law has very properly, for the safety of society,
decreed the punishment of death for such crimes: our only and plain duty is to execute that law."

The prisoner did not reply: he was leaning with his elbows on the front of the dock, his bowed
face covered with his outspread hands; and the judge passed sentence of death in the accustomed
form. The court then rose, and a turnkey placed his hand upon the prisoner's arm, to lead him
away. Suddenly he uncovered his face, drew himself up to his full height--he was a remarkably
tall man--and glared fiercely round upon the audience, like a wild animal at bay. "My lord,"
he cried, or rather shouted, in an excited voice. The judge motioned impatiently to the jailor,
and strong hands impelled the prisoner from the front of the dock. Bursting from them, he again
sprang forward, and his arms outstretched, whilst his glittering eye seemed to hold the judge
spell-bound, exclaimed, "My lord, before another month has passed away, you will appear at
the bar of another world, to answer for the life, the innocent life, which God bestowed upon
me, but which you have impiously cast away as a thing of naught and scorn!" He ceased, and
was at once borne off. The court, in some confusion, hastily departed. It was thought at the
time that the judge's evidently failing health had suggested the prophecy to the prisoner.
It only excited a few days' wonder, and was forgotten.

The position of a barrister in such circumstances is always painful. I need hardly say that
my own feelings were of a very distressing kind. Conscious that if the unfortunate man really
was guilty, he was at least not deserving of capital punishment, I exerted myself to procure
a reprieve. In the first place I waited privately on the judge; but he would listen to no proposal
for a respite. Along with a number of individuals--chiefly of the Society of Friends--I petitioned
the crown for a commutation of the sentence. But being unaccompanied with a recommendation
from the judge, the prayer of our petition was of course disregarded: the law, it was said,
must take its course. How much cruelty has been exercised under shelter of that remorseless
expression!

I would willingly pass over the succeeding events. Unable to save his life, I endeavored to
soothe the few remaining hours of the doomed convict, and frequently visited him in the condemned
cell. The more I saw of him, the deeper grew my sympathy in his case, which was that of no
vulgar felon. "I have been a most unfortunate man," said he one day to me. "A destiny towards
ruin in fortune and in life has pursued me. I feel as if deserted by God and man; yet I know,
or at least would persuade myself, that Heaven will one day vindicate my innocence of this
foul charge. To think of being hanged like a dog for a crime at which my soul revolts! Great
is the crime of those imbecile jurors and that false and hard-hearted judge, who thus, by an
irreversible decree, consign a fellow-mortal to a death of violence and disgrace. Oh God, help
me--help me to sustain that bitter, bitter hour!" And then the poor man would throw himself
on his bed and weep.

But the parting with his wife and children. What pen can describe that terrible interview!
They knelt in prayer, their wobegone countenances suffused in tears, and with hands clasped
convulsively together. The scene was too harrowing and sacred for the eye of a stranger. I
rushed from the cell, and buried myself in my lodgings, whence I did not remove till all was
over. Next day James Harvey, a victim of circumstantial evidence, and of a barbarous criminal
code, perished on the scaffold. 

Suddenly, however, just as Giles was preparing for a master-stroke, he was seized roughly by
the shoulder and bidden to give over. He looked round. It was an alderman, not his master, but Sir
John Mundy, an unpopular, harsh man.

"Wherefore?" demanded Giles. So shocked had been my feelings with
the mournful event which had taken place at ------, that I had gone into Wales for the sake
of change of scene. After roaming about for a fortnight amidst the wild solitudes of Caernarvonshire,
I took the stage for the city which I knew the court was to visit, and arrived on the day previous
to the opening of the assizes.

"Well, are we to have a heavy calendar?" I inquired next morning of a brother barrister on
entering the court.

"Rather light for a March assize," replied the impatient counsel as he bustled onward. "There's
Cartwright's case--highway robbery--in which I am for the prosecution. He'll swing for it,
and perhaps four or five others."

"A good hanging judge is A ----," said the under-sheriff, who at this moment joined us, rubbing
his hands, as if pleased with the prospect of a few executions. "No chance of the prophecy
yonder coming to pass I suppose?"

"Not in the least," replied the bustling counsel. "He never looked better. His illness has
gone completely off. And this day's work will brighten him up."

Cartwright's trial came on. I had never seen the man before, and was not aware that this was
the same person whom Harvey had incidentally told me he had discharged for theft; the truth
being, that till the last moment of his existence, that unfortunate man had not known how much
he had been a sacrifice to this wretch's malice.

The crime of which the villain now stood accused was that of robbing a farmer of the paltry
sum of eight shillings, in the neighborhood of Ilfracombe. He pleaded not guilty, but put in
no defence. A verdict was recorded against him, and in due form A ---- sentenced him to be
hanged. An expression of fiendish malignancy gleamed over the haggard features of the felon
as he asked leave to address a few words to the court. It was granted. Leaning forward, and
raising his heavy, scowling eyes to the judge, he thus began:--"There is something on my mind,
my lord--a dreadful crime--which, as I am to die for the eight shillings I took from the farmer,
I may as well confess. You may remember Harvey, my lord, whom you hanged the other day at--?"

"What of him, fellow?" replied the judge, his features suddenly flushing crimson.

"Why, my lord, only this--that he was as innocent of the crime for which you hanged him as
the child yet unborn! I did the deed! I put the watch in his trunk!" And to the unutterable
horror of the entire court he related the whole particulars of the transaction, the origin
of his grudge against Harvey, and his delight on bringing him to the gallows.

"Inhuman, execrable villain!" gasped the judge in extreme excitement.

"Cleverly done, though! Was it not, my lord?" rejoined the ruffian with bitter irony. "The
evidence, you know, was irresistible; the crime as clear as the sun at noonday; and if in such
plain cases, the just and necessary law was not enforced, society would be dissolved, and there
would be no security for property! These were your words, I think. How on that occasion I admired
your lordship's judgment and eloquence! Society would be dissolved if an innocent man were
not hanged! Ha!--ha!--ha! Capital!--capital!" shouted the ferocious felon with demoniac glee,
as he marked the effect of his words on the countenance of the judge.

"Remove the prisoner!" cried the sheriff. An officer was about to do so; but the judge motioned
him to desist. His lordship's features worked convulsively. He seemed striving to speak, but
the words would not come.

"I suppose, my lord," continued Cartwright in low and hissing tones, as the shadow of unutterable
despair grew and settled on his face--"I suppose you know that his wife destroyed herself.
The coroner's jury said she had fallen accidentally into the water, I know better. She drowned
herself under the agonies of a broken heart! I saw her corpse, with the dead baby in its arms;
and then I felt, knew, that I was lost! Lost, doomed to everlasting perdition! But, my lord,"--and
here the wretch broke into a howl wild and terrific--"we shall go down together--down to where
your deserts are known. A--h--h! that pinches you, does it? Hound of a judge! legal murderer!
coward! I spurn and spit upon thee!" The rest of the appalling objurgation was inarticulate,
as the monster, foaming and sputtering, was dragged by an officer from the dock.

Judge A ---- had fallen forwards on his face, fainting and speechless with the violence of
his emotions. The black cap had dropped from his brow. His hands were stretched out across
the bench, and various members of the bar rushed to his assistance. The court broke up in frightful
commotion.

Two days afterwards the county paper had the following announcement:--

"Died at the Royal Hotel, ------, on the 27th instant, Judge A ----, from an access of fever
supervening upon a disorder from which he had imperfectly recovered."

The prophecy was fulfilled!

THE NORTHERN CIRCUIT.
