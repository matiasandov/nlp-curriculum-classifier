FOUR YEARS

BY WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS.

FOUR YEARS 1887-1891.

At the end of the eighties my father and mother, my brother and sisters and myself, all newly
arrived from Dublin, were settled in Bedford Park in a red-brick house with several wood mantlepieces
copied from marble mantlepieces by the brothers Adam, a balcony, and a little garden shadowed
by a great horse-chestnut tree. Years before we had lived there, when the crooked, ostentatiously
picturesque streets, with great trees casting great shadows, had been anew enthusiasm: the
Pre-Raphaelite movement at last affecting life. But now exaggerated criticism had taken the
place of enthusiasm; the tiled roofs, the first in modern London, were said to leak, which
they did not, & the drains to be bad, though that was no longer true; and I imagine that houses
were cheap. I remember feeling disappointed because the co-operative stores, with their little
seventeenth century panes, were so like any common shop; and because the public house, called
'The Tabard' after Chaucer's Inn, was so plainly a common public house; and because the great
sign of a trumpeter designed by Rooke, the Pre- Raphaelite artist, had been freshened by some
inferior hand. The big red-brick church had never pleased me, and I was accustomed, when I
saw the wooden balustrade that ran along the slanting edge of the roof, where nobody ever walked
or could walk, to remember the opinion of some architect friend of my father's, that it had
been put there to keep the birds from falling off. Still, however, it had some village characters
and helped us to feel not wholly lost in the metropolis. I no longer went to church as a regular
habit, but go I sometimes did, for one Sunday morning I saw these words painted on a board
in the porch: 'The congregation are requested to kneel during prayers; the kneelers are afterwards
to be hung upon pegs provided for the purpose.' In front of every seat hung a little cushion,
and these cushions were called 'kneelers.' Presently the joke ran through the community, where
there were many artists, who considered religion at best an unimportant accessory to good architecture
and who disliked that particular church.

I could not understand where the charm had gone that I had felt, when as a school-boy of twelve
or thirteen, I had played among the unfinished houses, once leaving the marks of my two hands,
blacked by a fall among some paint, upon a white balustrade. Sometimes I thought it was because
these were real houses, while my play had been among toy-houses some day to be inhabited by
imaginary people full of the happiness that one can see in picture books. I was in all things
Pre-Raphaelite. When I was fifteen or sixteen, my father had told me about Rossetti and Blake
and given me their poetry to read; & once in Liverpool on my way to Sligo, "I had seen 'Dante's
Dream' in the gallery there--a picture painted when Rossetti had lost his dramatic power, and
to-day not very pleasing to me--and its colour, its people, its romantic architecture had blotted
all other pictures away." It was a perpetual bewilderment that my father, who had begun life
as a Pre-Raphaelite painter, now painted portraits of the first comer, children selling newspapers,
or a consumptive girl with a basket offish upon her head, and that when, moved perhaps by memory
of his youth, he chose some theme from poetic tradition, he would soon weary and leave it unfinished.
I had seen the change coming bit by bit and its defence elaborated by young men fresh from
the Paris art- schools. 'We must paint what is in front of us,' or 'A man must be of his own
time,' they would say, and if I spoke of Blake or Rossetti they would point out his bad drawing
and tell me to admire Carolus Duran and Bastien-Lepage.
