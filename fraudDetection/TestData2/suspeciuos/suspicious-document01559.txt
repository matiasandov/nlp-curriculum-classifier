Chapter I

Outside Dorlcote Mill

A wide plain, where the broadening Floss hurries on between its green banks to the sea, and
the loving tide, rushing to meet it, checks its passage with an impetuous embrace. On this
mighty tide the black ships--laden with the fresh-scented fir-planks, with rounded sacks of
oil-bearing seed, or with the dark glitter of coal--are borne along to the town of St. Ogg's,
which shows its aged, fluted red roofs and the broad gables of its wharves between the low
wooded hill and the river-brink, tingeing the water with a soft purple hue under the transient
glance of this February sun. Far away on each hand stretch the rich pastures, and the patches
of dark earth made ready for the seed of broad-leaved green crops, or touched already with
the tint of the tender-bladed autumn-sown corn. There is a remnant still of last year's golden
clusters of beehive-ricks rising at intervals beyond the hedgerows; and everywhere the hedgerows
are studded with trees; the distant ships seem to be lifting their masts and stretching their
red-brown sails close among the branches of the spreading ash. Just by the red-roofed town
the tributary Ripple flows with a lively current into the Floss. How lovely the little river
is, with its dark changing wavelets! It seems to me like a living companion while I wander
along the bank, and listen to its low, placid voice, as to the voice of one who is deaf and
loving. I remember those large dipping willows. I remember the stone bridge.

And this is Dorlcote Mill. I must stand a minute or two here on the bridge and look at it,
though the clouds are threatening, and it is far on in the afternoon. Even in this leafless
time of departing February it is pleasant to look at,--perhaps the chill, damp season adds
a charm to the trimly kept, comfortable dwelling-house, as old as the elms and chestnuts that
shelter it from the northern blast. The stream is brimful now, and lies high in this little
withy plantation, and half drowns the grassy fringe of the croft in front of the house. As
I look at the full stream, the vivid grass, the delicate bright-green powder softening the
outline of the great trunks and branches that gleam from under the bare purple boughs, I am
in love with moistness, and envy the white ducks that are dipping their heads far into the
water here among the withes, unmindful of the awkward appearance they make in the drier world
above.

The rush of the water and the booming of the mill bring a dreamy deafness, which seems to heighten
the peacefulness of the scene. They are like a great curtain of sound, shutting one out from
the world beyond. And now there is the thunder of the huge covered wagon coming home with sacks
of grain. That honest wagoner is thinking of his dinner, getting sadly dry in the oven at this
late hour; but he will not touch it till he has fed his horses,--the strong, submissive, meek-eyed
beasts, who, I fancy, are looking mild reproach at him from between their blinkers, that he
should crack his whip at them in that awful manner as if they needed that hint! See how they
stretch their shoulders up the slope toward the bridge, with all the more energy because they
are so near home. Look at their grand shaggy feet that seem to grasp the firm earth, at the
patient strength of their necks, bowed under the heavy collar, at the mighty muscles of their
struggling haunches! I should like well to hear them neigh over their hardly earned feed of
corn, and see them, with their moist necks freed from the harness, dipping their eager nostrils
into the muddy pond. Now they are on the bridge, and down they go again at a swifter pace,
and the arch of the covered wagon disappears at the turning behind the trees.

Now I can turn my eyes toward the mill again, and watch the unresting wheel sending out its
diamond jets of water. That little girl is watching it too; she has been standing on just the
same spot at the edge of the water ever since I paused on the bridge. And that queer white
cur with the brown ear seems to be leaping and barking in ineffectual remonstrance with the
wheel; perhaps he is jealous because his playfellow in the beaver bonnet is so rapt in its
movement. It is time the little playfellow went in, I think; and there is a very bright fire
to tempt her: the red light shines out under the deepening gray of the sky. It is time, too,
for me to leave off resting my arms on the cold stone of this bridge....

Ah, my arms are really benumbed. I have been pressing my elbows on the arms of my chair, and
dreaming that I was standing on the bridge in front of Dorlcote Mill, as it looked one February
afternoon many years ago. Before I dozed off, I was going to tell you what Mr. and Mrs. Tulliver
were talking about, as they sat by the bright fire in the left-hand parlor, on that very afternoon
I have been dreaming of.

Chapter II

Mr. Tulliver, of Dorlcote Mill, Declares His Resolution about Tom

"What I want, you know," said Mr. Tulliver,--"what I want is to give Tom a good eddication;
an eddication as'll be a bread to him. That was what I was thinking of when I gave notice for
him to leave the academy at Lady-day. I mean to put him to a downright good school at Midsummer.
The two years at th' academy 'ud ha' done well enough, if I'd meant to make a miller and farmer
of him, for he's had a fine sight more schoolin' nor I ever got. All the learnin' my father
ever paid for was a bit o' birch at one end and the alphabet at th' other. But I should like
Tom to be a bit of a scholard, so as he might be up to the tricks o' these fellows as talk
fine and write with a flourish. It 'ud be a help to me wi' these lawsuits, and arbitrations,
and things. I wouldn't make a downright lawyer o' the lad,--I should be sorry for him to be
a raskill,--but a sort o' engineer, or a surveyor, or an auctioneer and vallyer, like Riley,
or one o' them smartish businesses as are all profits and no outlay, only for a big watch-chain
and a high stool. They're pretty nigh all one, and they're not far off being even wi' the law,
I believe; for Riley looks Lawyer Wakem i' the face as hard as one cat looks another. He's
none frightened at him."

Mr. Tulliver was speaking to his wife, a blond comely woman in a fan-shaped cap (I am afraid
to think how long it is since fan-shaped caps were worn, they must be so near coming in again.
At that time, when Mrs. Tulliver was nearly forty, they were new at St. Ogg's, and considered
sweet things).

"Well, Mr. Tulliver, you know best: I've no objections. But hadn't I better kill a couple o'
fowl, and have th' aunts and uncles to dinner next week, so as you may hear what sister Glegg
and sister Pullet have got to say about it? There's a couple o' fowl wants killing!"

"You may kill every fowl i' the yard if you like, Bessy; but I shall ask neither aunt nor uncle
what I'm to do wi' my own lad," said Mr. Tulliver, defiantly.

"Dear heart!" said Mrs. Tulliver, shocked at this sanguinary rhetoric, "how can you talk so,
Mr. Tulliver? But it's your way to speak disrespectful o' my family; and sister Glegg throws
all the blame upo'me, though I'm sure I'm as innocent as the babe unborn. For nobody's ever
heard me say as it wasn't lucky for my children to have aunts and uncles as can live independent.
Howiver, if Tom's to go to a new school, I should like him to go where I can wash him and mend
him; else he might as well have calico as linen, for they'd be one as yallow as th' other before
they'd been washed half-a-dozen times. And then, when the box is goin' back'ard and forrard,
I could send the lad a cake, or a pork-pie, or an apple; for he can do with an extry bit, bless
him! whether they stint him at the meals or no. My children can eat as much victuals as most,
thank God!"

"Well, well, we won't send him out o' reach o' the carrier's cart, if other things fit in,"
said Mr. Tulliver. "But you mustn't put a spoke i' the wheel about the washin,' if we can't
get a school near enough. That's the fault I have to find wi' you, Bessy; if you see a stick
i' the road, you're allays thinkin' you can't step over it. You'd want me not to hire a good
wagoner, 'cause he'd got a mole on his face."

"Dear heart!" said Mrs. Tulliver, in mild surprise, "when did I iver make objections to a man
because he'd got a mole on his face? I'm sure I'm rether fond o' the moles; for my brother,
as is dead an' gone, had a mole on his brow. But I can't remember your iver offering to hire
a wagoner with a mole, Mr. Tulliver. There was John Gibbs hadn't a mole on his face no more
nor you have, an' I was all for having you hire him; an' so you did hire him, an' if he hadn't
died o' th' inflammation, as we paid Dr. Turnbull for attending him, he'd very like ha' been
drivin' the wagon now. He might have a mole somewhere out o' sight, but how was I to know that,
Mr. Tulliver?"

"No, no, Bessy; I didn't mean justly the mole; I meant it to stand for summat else; but niver
mind--it's puzzling work, talking is. What I'm thinking on, is how to find the right sort o'
school to send Tom to, for I might be ta'en in again, as I've been wi' th' academy. I'll have
nothing to do wi' a 'cademy again: whativer school I send Tom to, it sha'n't be a 'cademy;
it shall be a place where the lads spend their time i' summat else besides blacking the family's
shoes, and getting up the potatoes. It's an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school to pick."

Mr. Tulliver paused a minute or two, and dived with both hands into his breeches pockets as
if he hoped to find some suggestion there. Apparently he was not disappointed, for he presently
said, "I know what I'll do: I'll talk it over wi' Riley; he's coming to-morrow, t' arbitrate
about the dam."

"Well, Mr. Tulliver, I've put the sheets out for the best bed, and Kezia's got 'em hanging
at the fire. They aren't the best sheets, but they're good enough for anybody to sleep in,
be he who he will; for as for them best Holland sheets, I should repent buying 'em, only they'll
do to lay us out in. An' if you was to die to-morrow, Mr. Tulliver, they're mangled beautiful,
an' all ready, an' smell o' lavender as it 'ud be a pleasure to lay 'em out; an' they lie at
the left-hand corner o' the big oak linen-chest at the back: not as I should trust anybody
to look 'em out but myself."

As Mrs. Tulliver uttered the last sentence, she drew a bright bunch of keys from her pocket,
and singled out one, rubbing her thumb and finger up and down it with a placid smile while
she looked at the clear fire. If Mr. Tulliver had been a susceptible man in his conjugal relation,
he might have supposed that she drew out the key to aid her imagination in anticipating the
moment when he would be in a state to justify the production of the best Holland sheets. Happily
he was not so; he was only susceptible in respect of his right to water-power; moreover, he
had the marital habit of not listening very closely, and since his mention of Mr. Riley, had
been apparently occupied in a tactile examination of his woollen stockings.

"I think I've hit it, Bessy," was his first remark after a short silence. "Riley's as likely
a man as any to know o' some school; he's had schooling himself, an' goes about to all sorts
o' places, arbitratin' and vallyin' and that. And we shall have time to talk it over to-morrow
night when the business is done. I want Tom to be such a sort o' man as Riley, you know,--as
can talk pretty nigh as well as if it was all wrote out for him, and knows a good lot o' words
as don't mean much, so as you can't lay hold of 'em i' law; and a good solid knowledge o' business
too."

"Well," said Mrs. Tulliver, "so far as talking proper, and knowing everything, and walking
with a bend in his back, and setting his hair up, I shouldn't mind the lad being brought up
to that. But them fine-talking men from the big towns mostly wear the false shirt-fronts; they
wear a frill till it's all a mess, and then hide it with a bib; I know Riley does. And then,
if Tom's to go and live at Mudport, like Riley, he'll have a house with a kitchen hardly big
enough to turn in, an' niver get a fresh egg for his breakfast, an' sleep up three pair o'
stairs,--or four, for what I know,--and be burnt to death before he can get down."

"No, no," said Mr. Tulliver, "I've no thoughts of his going to Mudport: I mean him to set up
his office at St. Ogg's, close by us, an' live at home. But," continued Mr. Tulliver after
a pause, "what I'm a bit afraid on is, as Tom hasn't got the right sort o' brains for a smart
fellow. I doubt he's a bit slowish. He takes after your family, Bessy."

"Yes, that he does," said Mrs. Tulliver, accepting the last proposition entirely on its own
merits; "he's wonderful for liking a deal o' salt in his broth. That was my brother's way,
and my father's before him."

"It seems a bit a pity, though," said Mr. Tulliver, "as the lad should take after the mother's
side instead o' the little wench. That's the worst on't wi' crossing o' breeds: you can never
justly calkilate what'll come on't. The little un takes after my side, now: she's twice as
'cute as Tom. Too 'cute for a woman, I'm afraid," continued Mr. Tulliver, turning his head
dubiously first on one side and then on the other. "It's no mischief much while she's a little
un; but an over-'cute woman's no better nor a long-tailed sheep,--she'll fetch none the bigger
price for that."

"Yes, it is a mischief while she's a little un, Mr. Tulliver, for it runs to naughtiness. How
to keep her in a clean pinafore two hours together passes my cunning. An' now you put me i'
mind," continued Mrs. Tulliver, rising and going to the window, "I don't know where she is
now, an' it's pretty nigh tea-time. Ah, I thought so,--wanderin' up an' down by the water,
like a wild thing: She'll tumble in some day."

Mrs. Tulliver rapped the window sharply, beckoned, and shook her head,--a process which she
repeated more than once before she returned to her chair.

"You talk o' 'cuteness, Mr. Tulliver," she observed as she sat down, "but I'm sure the child's
half an idiot i' some things; for if I send her upstairs to fetch anything, she forgets what
she's gone for, an' perhaps 'ull sit down on the floor i' the sunshine an' plait her hair an'
sing to herself like a Bedlam creatur', all the while I'm waiting for her downstairs. That
niver run i' my family, thank God! no more nor a brown skin as makes her look like a mulatter.
I don't like to fly i' the face o' Providence, but it seems hard as I should have but one gell,
an' her so comical."

"Pooh, nonsense!" said Mr. Tulliver; "she's a straight, black-eyed wench as anybody need wish
to see. I don't know i' what she's behind other folks's children; and she can read almost as
well as the parson."

"But her hair won't curl all I can do with it, and she's so franzy about having it put i' paper,
and I've such work as never was to make her stand and have it pinched with th' irons."

"Cut it off--cut it off short," said the father, rashly.

"How can you talk so, Mr. Tulliver? She's too big a gell--gone nine, and tall of her age--to
have her hair cut short; an' there's her cousin Lucy's got a row o' curls round her head, an'
not a hair out o' place. It seems hard as my sister Deane should have that pretty child; I'm
sure Lucy takes more after me nor my own child does. Maggie, Maggie," continued the mother,
in a tone of half-coaxing fretfulness, as this small mistake of nature entered the room, "where's
the use o' my telling you to keep away from the water? You'll tumble in and be drownded some
day, an' then you'll be sorry you didn't do as mother told you."

Maggie's hair, as she threw off her bonnet, painfully confirmed her mother's accusation. Mrs.
Tulliver, desiring her daughter to have a curled crop, "like other folks's children," had had
it cut too short in front to be pushed behind the ears; and as it was usually straight an hour
after it had been taken out of paper, Maggie was incessantly tossing her head to keep the dark,
heavy locks out of her gleaming black eyes,--an action which gave her very much the air of
a small Shetland pony.

"Oh, dear, oh, dear, Maggie, what are you thinkin'of, to throw your bonnet down there? Take
it upstairs, there's a good gell, an' let your hair be brushed, an' put your other pinafore
on, an' change your shoes, do, for shame; an' come an' go on with your patchwork, like a little
lady."

"Oh, mother," said Maggie, in a vehemently cross tone, "I don't want to do my patchwork."

"What! not your pretty patchwork, to make a counterpane for your aunt Glegg?"

"It's foolish work," said Maggie, with a toss of her mane,--"tearing things to pieces to sew
'em together again. And I don't want to do anything for my aunt Glegg. I don't like her."

Exit Maggie, dragging her bonnet by the string, while Mr. Tulliver laughs audibly.

"I wonder at you, as you'll laugh at her, Mr. Tulliver," said the mother, with feeble fretfulness
in her tone. "You encourage her i' naughtiness. An' her aunts will have it as it's me spoils her."

Mrs. Tulliver was what is called a good-tempered person,--never cried, when she was a baby,
on any slighter ground than hunger and pins; and from the cradle upward had been healthy, fair,
plump, and dull-witted; in short, the flower of her family for beauty and amiability. But milk
and mildness are not the best things for keeping, and when they turn only a little sour, they
may disagree with young stomachs seriously. I have often wondered whether those early Madonnas
of Raphael, with the blond faces and somewhat stupid expression, kept their placidity undisturbed
when their strong-limbed, strong-willed boys got a little too old to do without clothing. I
think they must have been given to feeble remonstrance, getting more and more peevish as it
became more and more ineffectual.

Chapter III

Mr. Riley Gives His Advice Concerning a School for Tom

The gentleman in the ample white cravat and shirt-frill, taking his brandy-and-water so pleasantly
with his good friend Tulliver, is Mr. Riley, a gentleman with a waxen complexion and fat hands,
rather highly educated for an auctioneer and appraiser, but large-hearted enough to show a
great deal of bonhomie toward simple country acquaintances of hospitable habits. Mr. Riley
spoke of such acquaintances kindly as "people of the old school."

The conversation had come to a pause. Mr. Tulliver, not without a particular reason, had abstained
from a seventh recital of the cool retort by which Riley had shown himself too many for Dix,
and how Wakem had had his comb cut for once in his life, now the business of the dam had been
settled by arbitration, and how there never would have been any dispute at all about the height
of water if everybody was what they should be, and Old Harry hadn't made the lawyers.

Mr. Tulliver was, on the whole, a man of safe traditional opinions; but on one or two points
he had trusted to his unassisted intellect, and had arrived at several questionable conclusions;
amongst the rest, that rats, weevils, and lawyers were created by Old Harry. Unhappily he had
no one to tell him that this was rampant Manichæism, else he might have seen his error. But
to-day it was clear that the good principle was triumphant: this affair of the water-power
had been a tangled business somehow, for all it seemed--look at it one way--as plain as water's
water; but, big a puzzle as it was, it hadn't got the better of Riley. Mr. Tulliver took his
brandy-and-water a little stronger than usual, and, for a man who might be supposed to have
a few hundreds lying idle at his banker's, was rather incautiously open in expressing his high
estimate of his friend's business talents.

But the dam was a subject of conversation that would keep; it could always be taken up again
at the same point, and exactly in the same condition; and there was another subject, as you
know, on which Mr. Tulliver was in pressing want of Mr. Riley's advice. This was his particular
reason for remaining silent for a short space after his last draught, and rubbing his knees
in a meditative manner. He was not a man to make an abrupt transition. This was a puzzling
world, as he often said, and if you drive your wagon in a hurry, you may light on an awkward
corner. Mr. Riley, meanwhile, was not impatient. Why should he be? Even Hotspur, one would
think, must have been patient in his slippers on a warm hearth, taking copious snuff, and sipping
gratuitous brandy-and-water.

"There's a thing I've got i' my head," said Mr. Tulliver at last, in rather a lower tone than
usual, as he turned his head and looked steadfastly at his companion.

"Ah!" said Mr. Riley, in a tone of mild interest. He was a man with heavy waxen eyelids and
high-arched eyebrows, looking exactly the same under all circumstances. This immovability of
face, and the habit of taking a pinch of snuff before he gave an answer, made him trebly oracular
to Mr. Tulliver.

"It's a very particular thing," he went on; "it's about my boy Tom."

At the sound of this name, Maggie, who was seated on a low stool close by the fire, with a
large book open on her lap, shook her heavy hair back and looked up eagerly. There were few
sounds that roused Maggie when she was dreaming over her book, but Tom's name served as well
as the shrillest whistle; in an instant she was on the watch, with gleaming eyes, like a Skye
terrier suspecting mischief, or at all events determined to fly at any one who threatened it
toward Tom.

"You see, I want to put him to a new school at Midsummer," said Mr. Tulliver; "he's comin'
away from the 'cademy at Lady-day, an' I shall let him run loose for a quarter; but after that
I want to send him to a downright good school, where they'll make a scholard of him."

"Well," said Mr. Riley, "there's no greater advantage you can give him than a good education.
Not," he added, with polite significance,--"not that a man can't be an excellent miller and
farmer, and a shrewd, sensible fellow into the bargain, without much help from the schoolmaster."

"I believe you," said Mr. Tulliver, winking, and turning his head on one side; "but that's
where it is. I don't mean Tom to be a miller and farmer. I see no fun i' that. Why, if I made
him a miller an' farmer, he'd be expectin' to take to the mill an' the land, an' a-hinting
at me as it was time for me to lay by an' think o' my latter end. Nay, nay, I've seen enough
o' that wi' sons. I'll never pull my coat off before I go to bed. I shall give Tom an eddication
an' put him to a business, as he may make a nest for himself, an' not want to push me out o'
mine. Pretty well if he gets it when I'm dead an' gone. I sha'n't be put off wi' spoon-meat
afore I've lost my teeth."

This was evidently a point on which Mr. Tulliver felt strongly; and the impetus which had given
unusual rapidity and emphasis to his speech showed itself still unexhausted for some minutes
afterward in a defiant motion of the head from side to side, and an occasional "Nay, nay,"
like a subsiding growl.

These angry symptoms were keenly observed by Maggie, and cut her to the quick. Tom, it appeared,
was supposed capable of turning his father out of doors, and of making the future in some way
tragic by his wickedness. This was not to be borne; and Maggie jumped up from her stool, forgetting
all about her heavy book, which fell with a bang within the fender, and going up between her
father's knees, said, in a half-crying, half-indignant voice,--

"Father, Tom wouldn't be naughty to you ever; I know he wouldn't."

Mrs. Tulliver was out of the room superintending a choice supper-dish, and Mr. Tulliver's heart
was touched; so Maggie was not scolded about the book. Mr. Riley quietly picked it up and looked
at it, while the father laughed, with a certain tenderness in his hard-lined face, and patted
his little girl on the back, and then held her hands and kept her between his knees.

"What! they mustn't say any harm o' Tom, eh?" said Mr. Tulliver, looking at Maggie with a twinkling
eye. Then, in a lower voice, turning to Mr. Riley, as though Maggie couldn't hear, "She understands
what one's talking about so as never was. And you should hear her read,--straight off, as if
she knowed it all beforehand. And allays at her book! But it's bad--it's bad," Mr. Tulliver
added sadly, checking this blamable exultation. "A woman's no business wi' being so clever;
it'll turn to trouble, I doubt. But bless you!"--here the exultation was clearly recovering
the mastery,--"she'll read the books and understand 'em better nor half the folks as are growed
up."

Maggie's cheeks began to flush with triumphant excitement. She thought Mr. Riley would have
a respect for her now; it had been evident that he thought nothing of her before.

Mr. Riley was turning over the leaves of the book, and she could make nothing of his face,
with its high-arched eyebrows; but he presently looked at her, and said,--

"Come, come and tell me something about this book; here are some pictures,--I want to know
what they mean."

Maggie, with deepening color, went without hesitation to Mr. Riley's elbow and looked over
the book, eagerly seizing one corner, and tossing back her mane, while she said,--

"Oh, I'll tell you what that means. It's a dreadful picture, isn't it? But I can't help looking
at it. That old woman in the water's a witch,--they've put her in to find out whether she's
a witch or no; and if she swims she's a witch, and if she's drowned--and killed, you know--she's
innocent, and not a witch, but only a poor silly old woman. But what good would it do her then,
you know, when she was drowned? Only, I suppose, she'd go to heaven, and God would make it
up to her. And this dreadful blacksmith with his arms akimbo, laughing,--oh, isn't he ugly?--I'll
tell you what he is. He's the Devil really" (here Maggie's voice became louder and more emphatic),
"and not a right blacksmith; for the Devil takes the shape of wicked men, and walks about and
sets people doing wicked things, and he's oftener in the shape of a bad man than any other,
because, you know, if people saw he was the Devil, and he roared at 'em, they'd run away, and
he couldn't make 'em do what he pleased."

Mr. Tulliver had listened to this exposition of Maggie's with petrifying wonder.

"Why, what book is it the wench has got hold on?" he burst out at last.

"The 'History of the Devil,' by Daniel Defoe,--not quite the right book for a little girl,"
said Mr. Riley. "How came it among your books, Mr. Tulliver?"

Maggie looked hurt and discouraged, while her father said,--

"Why, it's one o' the books I bought at Partridge's sale. They was all bound alike,--it's a
good binding, you see,--and I thought they'd be all good books. There's Jeremy Taylor's 'Holy
Living and Dying' among 'em. I read in it often of a Sunday" (Mr. Tulliver felt somehow a familiarity
with that great writer, because his name was Jeremy); "and there's a lot more of 'em,--sermons
mostly, I think,--but they've all got the same covers, and I thought they were all o' one sample,
as you may say. But it seems one mustn't judge by th' outside. This is a puzzlin' world."

"Well," said Mr. Riley, in an admonitory, patronizing tone as he patted Maggie on the head,
"I advise you to put by the 'History of the Devil,' and read some prettier book. Have you no
prettier books?"

"Oh, yes," said Maggie, reviving a little in the desire to vindicate the variety of her reading.
"I know the reading in this book isn't pretty; but I like the pictures, and I make stories
to the pictures out of my own head, you know. But I've got 'Æsop's Fables,' and a book about
Kangaroos and things, and the 'Pilgrim's Progress.'"

"Ah, a beautiful book," said Mr. Riley; "you can't read a better."

"Well, but there's a great deal about the Devil in that," said Maggie, triumphantly, "and I'll
show you the picture of him in his true shape, as he fought with Christian."

Maggie ran in an instant to the corner of the room, jumped on a chair, and reached down from
the small bookcase a shabby old copy of Bunyan, which opened at once, without the least trouble
of search, at the picture she wanted.

"Here he is," she said, running back to Mr. Riley, "and Tom colored him for me with his paints
when he was at home last holidays,--the body all black, you know, and the eyes red, like fire,
because he's all fire inside, and it shines out at his eyes."

"Go, go!" said Mr. Tulliver, peremptorily, beginning to feel rather uncomfortable at these
free remarks on the personal appearance of a being powerful enough to create lawyers; "shut
up the book, and let's hear no more o' such talk. It is as I thought--the child 'ull learn
more mischief nor good wi' the books. Go, go and see after your mother."

Maggie shut up the book at once, with a sense of disgrace, but not being inclined to see after
her mother, she compromised the matter by going into a dark corner behind her father's chair,
and nursing her doll, toward which she had an occasional fit of fondness in Tom's absence,
neglecting its toilet, but lavishing so many warm kisses on it that the waxen cheeks had a
wasted, unhealthy appearance.

"Did you ever hear the like on't?" said Mr. Tulliver, as Maggie retired. "It's a pity but what
she'd been the lad,--she'd ha' been a match for the lawyers, she would. It's the wonderful'st
thing"--here he lowered his voice--"as I picked the mother because she wasn't o'er 'cute--bein'
a good-looking woman too, an' come of a rare family for managing; but I picked her from her
sisters o' purpose, 'cause she was a bit weak like; for I wasn't agoin' to be told the rights
o' things by my own fireside. But you see when a man's got brains himself, there's no knowing
where they'll run to; an' a pleasant sort o' soft woman may go on breeding you stupid lads
and 'cute wenches, till it's like as if the world was turned topsy-turvy. It's an uncommon
puzzlin' thing."

Mr. Riley's gravity gave way, and he shook a little under the application of his pinch of snuff
before he said,--

"But your lad's not stupid, is he? I saw him, when I was here last, busy making fishing-tackle;
he seemed quite up to it."

"Well, he isn't not to say stupid,--he's got a notion o' things out o' door, an' a sort o'
common sense, as he'd lay hold o' things by the right handle. But he's slow with his tongue,
you see, and he reads but poorly, and can't abide the books, and spells all wrong, they tell
me, an' as shy as can be wi' strangers, an' you never hear him say 'cute things like the little
wench. Now, what I want is to send him to a school where they'll make him a bit nimble with
his tongue and his pen, and make a smart chap of him. I want my son to be even wi' these fellows
as have got the start o' me with having better schooling. Not but what, if the world had been
left as God made it, I could ha' seen my way, and held my own wi' the best of 'em; but things
have got so twisted round and wrapped up i' unreasonable words, as aren't a bit like 'em, as
I'm clean at fault, often an' often. Everything winds about so--the more straightforrad you
are, the more you're puzzled."

Mr. Tulliver took a draught, swallowed it slowly, and shook his head in a melancholy manner,
conscious of exemplifying the truth that a perfectly sane intellect is hardly at home in this
insane world.

"You're quite in the right of it, Tulliver," observed Mr. Riley. "Better spend an extra hundred
or two on your son's education, than leave it him in your will. I know I should have tried
to do so by a son of mine, if I'd had one, though, God knows, I haven't your ready money to
play with, Tulliver; and I have a houseful of daughters into the bargain."

"I dare say, now, you know of a school as 'ud be just the thing for Tom," said Mr. Tulliver,
not diverted from his purpose by any sympathy with Mr. Riley's deficiency of ready cash.

Mr. Riley took a pinch of snuff, and kept Mr. Tulliver in suspense by a silence that seemed
deliberative, before he said,--

"I know of a very fine chance for any one that's got the necessary money and that's what you
have, Tulliver. The fact is, I wouldn't recommend any friend of mine to send a boy to a regular
school, if he could afford to do better. But if any one wanted his boy to get superior instruction
and training, where he would be the companion of his master, and that master a first rate fellow,
I know his man. I wouldn't mention the chance to everybody, because I don't think everybody
would succeed in getting it, if he were to try; but I mention it to you, Tulliver, between
ourselves."

The fixed inquiring glance with which Mr. Tulliver had been watching his friend's oracular
face became quite eager.

"Ay, now, let's hear," he said, adjusting himself in his chair with the complacency of a person
who is thought worthy of important communications.

"He's an Oxford man," said Mr. Riley, sententiously, shutting his mouth close, and looking
at Mr. Tulliver to observe the effect of this stimulating information.

"What! a parson?" said Mr. Tulliver, rather doubtfully.

"Yes, and an M.A. The bishop, I understand, thinks very highly of him: why, it was the bishop
who got him his present curacy."

"Ah?" said Mr. Tulliver, to whom one thing was as wonderful as another concerning these unfamiliar
phenomena. "But what can he want wi' Tom, then?"

"Why, the fact is, he's fond of teaching, and wishes to keep up his studies, and a clergyman
has but little opportunity for that in his parochial duties. He's willing to take one or two
boys as pupils to fill up his time profitably. The boys would be quite of the family,--the
finest thing in the world for them; under Stelling's eye continually."

"But do you think they'd give the poor lad twice o' pudding?" said Mrs. Tulliver, who was now
in her place again. "He's such a boy for pudding as never was; an' a growing boy like that,--it's
dreadful to think o' their stintin' him."

"And what money 'ud he want?" said Mr. Tulliver, whose instinct told him that the services
of this admirable M.A. would bear a high price.

"Why, I know of a clergyman who asks a hundred and fifty with his youngest pupils, and he's
not to be mentioned with Stelling, the man I speak of. I know, on good authority, that one
of the chief people at Oxford said, Stelling might get the highest honors if he chose. But
he didn't care about university honors; he's a quiet man--not noisy."

"Ah, a deal better--a deal better," said Mr. Tulliver; "but a hundred and fifty's an uncommon
price. I never thought o' paying so much as that."

"A good education, let me tell you, Tulliver,--a good education is cheap at the money. But
Stelling is moderate in his terms; he's not a grasping man. I've no doubt he'd take your boy
at a hundred, and that's what you wouldn't get many other clergymen to do. I'll write to him
about it, if you like."

Mr. Tulliver rubbed his knees, and looked at the carpet in a meditative manner.

"But belike he's a bachelor," observed Mrs. Tulliver, in the interval; "an' I've no opinion
o' housekeepers. There was my brother, as is dead an' gone, had a housekeeper once, an' she
took half the feathers out o' the best bed, an' packed 'em up an' sent 'em away. An' it's unknown
the linen she made away with--Stott her name was. It 'ud break my heart to send Tom where there's
a housekeeper, an' I hope you won't think of it, Mr. Tulliver."

"You may set your mind at rest on that score, Mrs. Tulliver," said Mr. Riley, "for Stelling
is married to as nice a little woman as any man need wish for a wife. There isn't a kinder
little soul in the world; I know her family well. She has very much your complexion,--light
curly hair. She comes of a good Mudport family, and it's not every offer that would have been
acceptable in that quarter. But Stelling's not an every-day man; rather a particular fellow
as to the people he chooses to be connected with. But I think he would have no objection to
take your son; I think he would not, on my representation."

"I don't know what he could have against the lad," said Mrs. Tulliver, with a slight touch
of motherly indignation; "a nice fresh-skinned lad as anybody need wish to see."

"But there's one thing I'm thinking on," said Mr. Tulliver, turning his head on one side and
looking at Mr. Riley, after a long perusal of the carpet. "Wouldn't a parson be almost too
high-learnt to bring up a lad to be a man o' business? My notion o' the parsons was as they'd
got a sort o' learning as lay mostly out o' sight. And that isn't what I want for Tom. I want
him to know figures, and write like print, and see into things quick, and know what folks mean,
and how to wrap things up in words as aren't actionable. It's an uncommon fine thing, that
is," concluded Mr. Tulliver, shaking his head, "when you can let a man know what you think
of him without paying for it."

"Oh, my dear Tulliver," said Mr. Riley, "you're quite under a mistake about the clergy; all
the best schoolmasters are of the clergy. The schoolmasters who are not clergymen are a very
low set of men generally."

"Ay, that Jacobs is, at the 'cademy," interposed Mr. Tulliver.

"To be sure,--men who have failed in other trades, most likely. Now, a clergyman is a gentleman
by profession and education; and besides that, he has the knowledge that will ground a boy,
and prepare him for entering on any career with credit. There may be some clergymen who are
mere bookmen; but you may depend upon it, Stelling is not one of them,--a man that's wide awake,
let me tell you. Drop him a hint, and that's enough. You talk of figures, now; you have only
to say to Stelling, 'I want my son to be a thorough arithmetician,' and you may leave the rest
to him."

Mr. Riley paused a moment, while Mr. Tulliver, some-what reassured as to clerical tutorship,
was inwardly rehearsing to an imaginary Mr. Stelling the statement, "I want my son to know
'rethmetic."

"You see, my dear Tulliver," Mr. Riley continued, "when you get a thoroughly educated man,
like Stelling, he's at no loss to take up any branch of instruction. When a workman knows the
use of his tools, he can make a door as well as a window."

"Ay, that's true," said Mr. Tulliver, almost convinced now that the clergy must be the best
of schoolmasters.

"Well, I'll tell you what I'll do for you," said Mr. Riley, "and I wouldn't do it for everybody.
I'll see Stelling's father-in-law, or drop him a line when I get back to Mudport, to say that
you wish to place your boy with his son-in-law, and I dare say Stelling will write to you,
and send you his terms."

"But there's no hurry, is there?" said Mrs. Tulliver; "for I hope, Mr. Tulliver, you won't
let Tom begin at his new school before Midsummer. He began at the 'cademy at the Lady-day quarter,
and you see what good's come of it."

"Ay, ay, Bessy, never brew wi' bad malt upo' Michael-masday, else you'll have a poor tap,"
said Mr. Tulliver, winking and smiling at Mr. Riley, with the natural pride of a man who has
a buxom wife conspicuously his inferior in intellect. "But it's true there's no hurry; you've
hit it there, Bessy."

"It might be as well not to defer the arrangement too long," said Mr. Riley, quietly, "for
Stelling may have propositions from other parties, and I know he would not take more than two
or three boarders, if so many. If I were you, I think I would enter on the subject with Stelling
at once: there's no necessity for sending the boy before Midsummer, but I would be on the safe
side, and make sure that nobody forestalls you."

"Ay, there's summat in that," said Mr. Tulliver.

"Father," broke in Maggie, who had stolen unperceived to her father's elbow again, listening
with parted lips, while she held her doll topsy-turvy, and crushed its nose against the wood
of the chair,--"father, is it a long way off where Tom is to go? Sha'n't we ever go to see him?"

"I don't know, my wench," said the father, tenderly. "Ask Mr. Riley; he knows."

Maggie came round promptly in front of Mr. Riley, and said, "How far is it, please, sir?"

"Oh, a long, long way off," that gentleman answered, being of opinion that children, when they
are not naughty, should always be spoken to jocosely. "You must borrow the seven-leagued boots
to get to him."

"That's nonsense!" said Maggie, tossing her head haughtily, and turning away, with the tears
springing in her eyes. She began to dislike Mr. Riley; it was evident he thought her silly
and of no consequence.

"Hush, Maggie! for shame of you, asking questions and chattering," said her mother. "Come and
sit down on your little stool, and hold your tongue, do. But," added Mrs. Tulliver, who had
her own alarm awakened, "is it so far off as I couldn't wash him and mend him?"

"About fifteen miles; that's all," said Mr. Riley. "You can drive there and back in a day quite
comfortably. Or--Stelling is a hospitable, pleasant man--he'd be glad to have you stay."

"But it's too far off for the linen, I doubt," said Mrs. Tulliver, sadly.

The entrance of supper opportunely adjourned this difficulty, and relieved Mr. Riley from the
labor of suggesting some solution or compromise,--a labor which he would otherwise doubtless
have undertaken; for, as you perceive, he was a man of very obliging manners. And he had really
given himself the trouble of recommending Mr. Stelling to his friend Tulliver without any positive
expectation of a solid, definite advantage resulting to himself, notwithstanding the subtle
indications to the contrary which might have misled a too-sagacious observer. For there is
nothing more widely misleading than sagacity if it happens to get on a wrong scent; and sagacity,
persuaded that men usually act and speak from distinct motives, with a consciously proposed
end in view, is certain to waste its energies on imaginary game.

Plotting covetousness and deliberate contrivance, in order to compass a selfish end, are nowhere
abundant but in the world of the dramatist: they demand too intense a mental action for many
of our fellow-parishioners to be guilty of them. It is easy enough to spoil the lives of our
neighbors without taking so much trouble; we can do it by lazy acquiescence and lazy omission,
by trivial falsities for which we hardly know a reason, by small frauds neutralized by small
extravagances, by maladroit flatteries, and clumsily improvised insinuations. We live from
hand to mouth, most of us, with a small family of immediate desires; we do little else than
snatch a morsel to satisfy the hungry brood, rarely thinking of seed-corn or the next year's crop.

Mr. Riley was a man of business, and not cold toward his own interest, yet even he was more
under the influence of small promptings than of far-sighted designs. He had no private understanding
with the Rev. Walter Stelling; on the contrary, he knew very little of that M.A. and his acquirements,--not
quite enough, perhaps, to warrant so strong a recommendation of him as he had given to his
friend Tulliver. But he believed Mr. Stelling to be an excellent classic, for Gadsby had said
so, and Gadsby's first cousin was an Oxford tutor; which was better ground for the belief even
than his own immediate observation would have been, for though Mr. Riley had received a tincture
of the classics at the great Mudport Free School, and had a sense of understanding Latin generally,
his comprehension of any particular Latin was not ready. Doubtless there remained a subtle
aroma from his juvenile contact with the "De Senectute" and the fourth book of the "Æneid,"
but it had ceased to be distinctly recognizable as classical, and was only perceived in the
higher finish and force of his auctioneering style. Then, Stelling was an Oxford man, and the
Oxford men were always--no, no, it was the Cambridge men who were always good mathematicians.
But a man who had had a university education could teach anything he liked; especially a man
like Stelling, who had made a speech at a Mudport dinner on a political occasion, and had acquitted
himself so well that it was generally remarked, this son-in-law of Timpson's was a sharp fellow.
It was to be expected of a Mudport man, from the parish of St. Ursula, that he would not omit
to do a good turn to a son-in-law of Timpson's, for Timpson was one of the most useful and
influential men in the parish, and had a good deal of business, which he knew how to put into
the right hands. Mr. Riley liked such men, quite apart from any money which might be diverted,
through their good judgment, from less worthy pockets into his own; and it would be a satisfaction
to him to say to Timpson on his return home, "I've secured a good pupil for your son-in-law."
Timpson had a large family of daughters; Mr. Riley felt for him; besides, Louisa Timpson's
face, with its light curls, had been a familiar object to him over the pew wainscot on a Sunday
for nearly fifteen years; it was natural her husband should be a commendable tutor. Moreover,
Mr. Riley knew of no other schoolmaster whom he had any ground for recommending in preference;
why, then, should be not recommend Stelling? His friend Tulliver had asked him for an opinion;
it is always chilling, in friendly intercourse, to say you have no opinion to give. And if
you deliver an opinion at all, it is mere stupidity not to do it with an air of conviction
and well-founded knowledge. You make it your own in uttering it, and naturally get fond of
it. Thus Mr. Riley, knowing no harm of Stelling to begin with, and wishing him well, so far
as he had any wishes at all concerning him, had no sooner recommended him than he began to
think with admiration of a man recommended on such high authority, and would soon have gathered
so warm an interest on the subject, that if Mr. Tulliver had in the end declined to send Tom
to Stelling, Mr. Riley would have thought his "friend of the old school" a thoroughly pig-headed
fellow.

If you blame Mr. Riley very severely for giving a recommendation on such slight grounds, I
must say you are rather hard upon him. Why should an auctioneer and appraiser thirty years
ago, who had as good as forgotten his free-school Latin, be expected to manifest a delicate
scrupulosity which is not always exhibited by gentlemen of the learned professions, even in
our present advanced stage of morality?

Besides, a man with the milk of human kindness in him can scarcely abstain from doing a good-natured
action, and one cannot be good-natured all round. Nature herself occasionally quarters an inconvenient
parasite on an animal toward whom she has otherwise no ill will. What then? We admire her care
for the parasite. If Mr. Riley had shrunk from giving a recommendation that was not based on
valid evidence, he would not have helped Mr. Stelling to a paying pupil, and that would not
have been so well for the reverend gentleman. Consider, too, that all the pleasant little dim
ideas and complacencies--of standing well with Timpson, of dispensing advice when he was asked
for it, of impressing his friend Tulliver with additional respect, of saying something, and
saying it emphatically, with other inappreciably minute ingredients that went along with the
warm hearth and the brandy-and-water to make up Mr. Riley's consciousness on this occasion--would
have been a mere blank. The spiders were especially a subject of speculation with her. She
wondered if they had any relatives outside the mill, for in that case there must be a painful
difficulty in their family intercourse,--a fat and floury spider, accustomed to take his fly
well dusted with meal, must suffer a little at a cousin's table where the fly was au naturel,
and the lady spiders must be mutually shocked at each other's appearance. But the part of the
mill she liked best was the topmost story,--the corn-hutch, where there were the great heaps
of grain, which she could sit on and slide down continually.

"Oh dear, Luke," said Maggie, in a piteous tone, while the big tears rolled down her cheek;
"Tom told me to take care of 'em, and I forgot. What shall I do?"

"Well, you see, Miss, they were in that far tool-house, an' it was nobody's business to see
to 'em. I reckon Master Tom told Harry to feed 'em, but there's no countin' on Harry; he's
an offal creatur as iver come about the primises, he is. He remembers nothing but his own inside--an'
I wish it'ud gripe him." Mrs. Moggs, Luke's wife, was a decidely agreeable acquaintance. She
exhibited her hospitality in bread and treacle, and possessed various works of art. Maggie
actually forgot that she had any special cause of sadness this morning, as she stood on a chair
to look at a remarkable series of pictures representing the Prodigal Son in the costume of
Sir Charles Grandison, except that, as might have been expected from his defective moral character,
he had not, like that accomplished hero, the taste and strength of mind to dispense with a
wig. But the indefinable weight the dead rabbits had left on her mind caused her to feel more
than usual pity for the career of this weak young man, particularly when she looked at the
picture where he leaned against a tree with a flaccid appearance, his knee-breeches unbuttoned
and his wig awry, while the swine apparently of some foreign breed, seemed to insult him by
their good spirits over their feast of husks.

"I'm very glad his father took him back again, aren't you, Luke?" she said. "For he was very
sorry, you know, and wouldn't do wrong again."

"Eh, Miss," said Luke, "he'd be no great shakes, I doubt, let's feyther do what he would for him."

That was a painful thought to Maggie, and she wished much that the subsequent history of the
young man had not been left a blank. "You forgot to feed 'em, then, and Harry forgot?" he said,
his color heightening for a moment, but soon subsiding. "I'll pitch into Harry. I'll have him
turned away. And I don't love you, Maggie. You sha'n't go fishing with me to-morrow.

Chapter VI

The Aunts and Uncles Are Coming

It was Easter week, and Mrs. Tulliver's cheesecakes were more exquisitely light than usual.
"A puff o' wind 'ud make 'em blow about like feathers," Kezia the housemaid said, feeling proud
to live under a mistress who could make such pastry; so that no season or circumstances could
have been more propitious for a family party, even if it had not been advisable to consult
sister Glegg and sister Pullet about Tom's going to school.

"I'd as lief not invite sister Deane this time," said Mrs. Tulliver, "for she's as jealous
and having as can be, and's allays trying to make the worst o' my poor children to their aunts
and uncles."

"Yes, yes," said Mr. Tulliver, "ask her to come. I never hardly get a bit o' talk with Deane
now; we haven't had him this six months. What's it matter what she says? My children need be
beholding to nobody."

"That's what you allays say, Mr. Tulliver; but I'm sure there's nobody o' your side, neither
aunt nor uncle, to leave 'em so much as a five-pound note for a leggicy. And there's sister
Glegg, and sister Pullet too, saving money unknown, for they put by all their own interest
and butter-money too; their husbands buy 'em everything." Mrs. Tulliver was a mild woman, but
even a sheep will face about a little when she has lambs.

"Tchuh!" said Mr. Tulliver. "It takes a big loaf when there's many to breakfast. What signifies
your sisters' bits o' money when they've got half-a-dozen nevvies and nieces to divide it among?
And your sister Deane won't get 'em to leave all to one, I reckon, and make the country cry
shame on 'em when they are dead?"

"I don't know what she won't get 'em to do," said Mrs. Tulliver, "for my children are so awk'ard
wi' their aunts and uncles. Maggie's ten times naughtier when they come than she is other days,
and Tom doesn't like 'em, bless him!--though it's more nat'ral in a boy than a gell. And there's
Lucy Dean's such a good child,--you may set her on a stool, and there she'llsit for an hour
together, and never offer to get off. I can't help loving the child as if she was my own; and
I'm sure she's more like my child than sister Deane's, for she'd allays a very poor color for
one of our family, sister Deane had."

"Well, well, if you're fond o' the child, ask her father and mother to bring her with 'em.
And won't you ask their aunt and uncle Moss too, and some o' their children?"

"Oh, dear, Mr. Tulliver, why, there'd be eight people besides the children, and I must put
two more leaves i' the table, besides reaching down more o' the dinner-service; and you know
as well as I do as my sisters and your sister don't suit well together."

"Well, well, do as you like, Bessy," said Mr. Tulliver, taking up his hat and walking out to
the mill. Few wives were more submissive than Mrs. Tulliver on all points unconnected with
her family relations; but she had been a Miss Dodson, and the Dodsons were a very respectable
family indeed,--as much looked up to as any in their own parish, or the next to it. The Miss
Dodsons had always been thought to hold up their heads very high, and no one was surprised
the two eldest had married so well,--not at an early age, for that was not the practice of
the Dodson family. There were particular ways of doing everything in that family: particular
ways of bleaching the linen, of making the cowslip wine, curing the hams, and keeping the bottled
gooseberries; so that no daughter of that house could be indifferent to the privilege of having
been born a Dodson, rather than a Gibson or a Watson. Funerals were always conducted with peculiar
propriety in the Dodson family: the hat-bands were never of a blue shade, the gloves never
split at the thumb, everybody was a mourner who ought to be, and there were always scarfs for
the bearers. When one of the family was in trouble or sickness, all the rest went to visit
the unfortunate member, usually at the same time, and did not shrink from uttering the most
disagreeable truths that correct family feeling dictated; if the illness or trouble was the
sufferer's own fault, it was not in the practice of the Dodson family to shrink from saying
so. In short, there was in this family a peculiar tradition as to what was the right thing
in household management and social demeanor, and the only bitter circumstance attending this
superiority was a painful inability to approve the condiments or the conduct of families ungoverned
by the Dodson tradition. A female Dodson, when in "strange houses," always ate dry bread with
her tea, and declined any sort of preserves, having no confidence in the butter, and thinking
that the preserves had probably begun to ferment from want of due sugar and boiling. There
were some Dodsons less like the family than others, that was admitted; but in so far as they
were "kin," they were of necessity better than those who were "no kin." And it is remarkable
that while no individual Dodson was satisfied with any other individual Dodson, each was satisfied,
not only with him or her self, but with the Dodsons collectively. The feeblest member of a
family--the one who has the least character--is often the merest epitome of the family habits
and traditions; and Mrs. Tulliver was a thorough Dodson, though a mild one, as small-beer,
so long as it is anything, is only describable as very weak ale: and though she had groaned
a little in her youth under the yoke of her elder sisters, and still shed occasional tears
at their sisterly reproaches, it was not in Mrs. Tulliver to be an innovator on the family
ideas. She was thankful to have been a Dodson, and to have one child who took after her own
family, at least in his features and complexion, in liking salt and in eating beans, which
a Tulliver never did.

In other respects the true Dodson was partly latent in Tom, and he was as far from appreciating
his "kin" on the mother's side as Maggie herself, generally absconding for the day with a large
supply of the most portable food, when he received timely warning that his aunts and uncles
were coming,--a moral symptom from which his aunt Glegg deduced the gloomiest views of his
future. It was rather hard on Maggie that Tom always absconded without letting her into the
secret, but the weaker sex are acknowledged to be serious impedimenta in cases of flight.

"Why, Tom? Because Lucy's coming?" He always takes the best bit, if you don't punch him for
it; and if you choose the best with your eyes shut, he changes his hands. Maggie felt sure
that Bob was wicked, without very distinctly knowing why; unless it was because Bob's mother
was a dreadfully large fat woman, who lived at a queer round house down the river; and once,
when Maggie and Tom had wandered thither, there rushed out a brindled dog that wouldn't stop
barking; and when Bob's mother came out after it, and screamed above the barking to tell them
not to be frightened, Maggie thought she was scolding them fiercely, and her heart beat with
terror. Maggie thought it very likely that the round house had snakes on the floor, and bats
in the bedroom; for she had seen Bob take off his cap to show Tom a little snake that was inside
it, and another time he had a handful of young bats: altogether, he was an irregular character,
perhaps even slightly diabolical, judging from his intimacy with snakes and bats; and to crown
all, when Tom had Bob for a companion, he didn't mind about Maggie, and would never let her
go with him.

It must be owned that Tom was fond of Bob's company. How could it be otherwise? Bob knew, directly
he saw a bird's egg, whether it was a swallow's, or a tomtit's, or a yellow-hammer's; he found
out all the wasps' nests, and could set all sort of traps; he could climb the trees like a
squirrel, and had quite a magical power of detecting hedgehogs and stoats; and he had courage
to do things that were rather naughty, such as making gaps in the hedgerows, throwing stones
after the sheep, and killing a cat that was wandering incognito.

Such qualities in an inferior, who could always be treated with authority in spite of his superior
knowingness, had necessarily a fatal fascination for Tom; and every holiday-time Maggie was
sure to have days of grief because he had gone off with Bob.

Maggie's was a troublous life, and this was the form in which she took her opium.

Meanwhile Tom, forgetting all about Maggie and the sting of reproach which he had left in her
heart, was hurrying along with Bob, whom he had met accidentally, to the scene of a great rat-catching
in a neighboring barn. Bob knew all about this particular affair, and spoke of the sport with
an enthusiasm which no one who is not either divested of all manly feeling, or pitiably ignorant
of rat-catching, can fail to imagine. For a person suspected of preternatural wickedness, Bob
was really not so very villanous-looking; there was even something agreeable in his snub-nosed
face, with its close-curled border of red hair. But then his trousers were always rolled up
at the knee, for the convenience of wading on the slightest notice; and his virtue, supposing
it to exist, was undeniably "virtue in rags," which, on the authority even of bilious philosophers,
who think all well-dressed merit overpaid, is notoriously likely to remain unrecognized (perhaps
because it is seen so seldom).

"I know the chap as owns the ferrets," said Bob, in a hoarse treble voice, as he shuffled along,
keeping his blue eyes fixed on the river, like an amphibious animal who foresaw occasion for
darting in. "He lives up the Kennel Yard at Sut Ogg's, he does. He's the biggest rot-catcher
anywhere, he is. I'd sooner, be a rot-catcher nor anything, I would. The moles is nothing to
the rots. But Lors! you mun ha' ferrets. Dogs is no good. Why, there's that dog, now!" Bob
continued, pointing with an air of disgust toward Yap, "he's no more good wi' a rot nor nothin'.
I see it myself, I did, at the rot-catchin' i' your feyther's barn."

Yap, feeling the withering influence of this scorn, tucked his tail in and shrank close to
Tom's leg, who felt a little hurt for him, but had not the superhuman courage to seem behindhand
with Bob in contempt for a dog who made so poor a figure.

"No, no," he said, "Yap's no good at sport. I'll have regular good dogs for rats and everything,
when I've done school."

"Hev ferrets, Measter Tom," said Bob, eagerly,--"them white ferrets wi' pink eyes; Lors, you
might catch your own rots, an' you might put a rot in a cage wi' a ferret, an' see 'em fight,
you might. That's what I'd do, I know, an' it 'ud be better fun a'most nor seein' two chaps
fight,--if it wasn't them chaps as sold cakes an' oranges at the Fair, as the things flew out
o' their baskets, an' some o' the cakes was smashed--But they tasted just as good," added Bob,
by way of note or addendum, after a moment's pause.

"But, I say, Bob," said Tom, in a tone of deliberation, "ferrets are nasty biting things,--they'll
bite a fellow without being set on."

"Lors! why that's the beauty on 'em. If a chap lays hold o' your ferret, he won't be long before
he hollows out a good un, he won't."

At this moment a striking incident made the boys pause suddenly in their walk. It was the plunging
of some small body in the water from among the neighboring bulrushes; if it was not a water-rat,
Bob intimated that he was ready to undergo the most unpleasant consequences.

"Hoigh! Yap,--hoigh! there he is," said Tom, clapping his hands, as the little black snout
made its arrowy course to the opposite bank. "Seize him, lad! seize him!"

Yap agitated his ears and wrinkled his brows, but declined to plunge, trying whether barking
would not answer the purpose just as well.

"Ugh! you coward!" said Tom, and kicked him over, feeling humiliated as a sportsman to possess
so poor-spirited an animal. Bob abstained from remark and passed on, choosing, however, to
walk in the shallow edge of the overflowing river by way of change.

"He's none so full now, the Floss isn't," said Bob, as he kicked the water up before him, with
an agreeable sense of being insolent to it. "Why, last 'ear, the meadows was all one sheet
o' water, they was."

"Ay, but," said Tom, whose mind was prone to see an opposition between statements that were
really accordant,--"but there was a big flood once, when the Round Pool was made. I know there
was, 'cause father says so. And the sheep and cows all drowned, and the boats went all over
the fields ever such a way."

"I don't care about a flood comin'," said Bob; "I don't mind the water, no more nor the land.
I'd swim, I would."

"Ah, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?" said Tom, his imagination becoming quite
active under the stimulus of that dread. "When I'm a man, I shall make a boat with a wooden
house on the top of it, like Noah's ark, and keep plenty to eat in it,--rabbits and things,--all
ready. And then if the flood came, you know, Bob, I shouldn't mind. And I'd take you in, if
I saw you swimming," he added, in the tone of a benevolent patron.

"I aren't frighted," said Bob, to whom hunger did not appear so appalling. "But I'd get in
an' knock the rabbits on th' head when you wanted to eat 'em."

"Ah, and I should have halfpence, and we'd play at heads-and-tails," said Tom, not contemplating
the possibility that this recreation might have fewer charms for his mature age. "I'd divide
fair to begin with, and then we'd see who'd win."

"I've got a halfpenny o' my own," said Bob, proudly, coming out of the water and tossing his
halfpenny in the air. "Yeads or tails?"

"Tails," said Tom, instantly fired with the desire to win.

"It's yeads," said Bob, hastily, snatching up the halfpenny as it fell.

"It wasn't," said Tom, loudly and peremptorily. "You give me the halfpenny; I've won it fair."

"I sha'n't," said Bob, holding it tight in his pocket.

"Then I'll make you; see if I don't," said Tom.

"Yes, I can."

"You can't make me do nothing, you can't," said Bob.

"No, you can't."

"I'm master."

"I don't care for you."

"But I'll make you care, you cheat," said Tom, collaring Bob and shaking him.

"You get out wi' you," said Bob, giving Tom a kick.

Tom's blood was thoroughly up: he went at Bob with a lunge and threw him down, but Bob seized
hold and kept it like a cat, and pulled Tom down after him. But it is not urged as a necessity,
when they say it cannot be, that the flame passes over to the heart through their room (stanza
e cortile) and courtyard leaving so many waters behind, for two reasons.

First, because such an impediment cannot exist in action, if (equally?) violent opposition is not
put into action;[U] second, because in so far as the waters are actually
in the eyes, they can give passage to the heat as to the light; for,
experience proves that the luminous ray kindles, by means of reflection,
any material that becomes opposed to it, without heating the glass;
and the ray passes through a glass, crystal or other vase, full of
water, and heats an object placed under it, without heating the thick
intervening body.

As it is also true that it causes dry and dusty impressions in the caves of the deep sea. Therefore
by analogy, if not by the same sort of reasons, we may see how it is possible that, through the
lubricant and dark passage of the eyes, the affection may be kindled and inflamed by that light,
the which for the same reason cannot be in the middle.[V] As the light of the sun, according to other
reasoning, is in the middle air, or again in the nearer sense, and again in the common sense,
or again in the intellect, notwithstanding that from one mode proceeds the other mode of being.

[U]
Prima, per che tal impedimento in atto non puo essere se non posti in atto tali oltraggiosi ripari.
Does this mean that the opposites which are called into action must be equal in power?--(Translator.)

If,
when fire is ascending again to its proper sphere, it should meet
with obstacles, such as a bit of wood or of straw, it would resume
its former activity, and consume this obstacle or hindrance; and the
greater the resistance, the more its activity would be increased....
You will observe that the obstacle which the fire meets with would
serve only to increase its velocity, by giving it a new ardour to
overcome all obstacles in joining itself to its centre.--("Spiritual
Torrents," Lady Guion.)

[V] Nel mezzo.

LAO. Are there any more discourses?

LIB.

Yes; because both the one and the other are trying to find out in what way it is that it (the
heart) contains so many flames and those (the eyes) so many waters. The heart then makes the next
proposition.

59.

Second proposition of the heart to the eyes.

If to the foaming sea the rivers run, And pour their streams into
the sea's dark gulf, How does the kingdom of the water-gods, Fed by
the double torrent of these eyes, Increase not; since the earth Must
lose the glorious overflow?

How is it that we do not see the day, When from the mount Deukalion returns? Where are the
lengthening shores, Where is the torrent to put out my flame, Or, failing this, to give it greater
power? Does drop of water ever fall to earth In such a way as leads
me to suppose It is not as the senses show it?

It asks, what power is this, which is not put into action? If the waters are so many, why does
Neptune not come to tyrannize over the kingdoms of the other elements?

Where are the inundated banks? Where is he who will give coolness to the ardent fire? Where is the
drop of water by which I may affirm through the eyes that which the senses deny? But the eyes in
the same way ask another question.

60.

Second proposition of the eyes to the heart.

If matter changed and turned to fire acquires The movement of a lighter element, Rising aloft
unto the highest heaven; Wherefore, ignited by the fire of love, Swifter than wind, dost thou
not rise and flash. Into the sun and be incorporate there? Why rather stay a pilgrim here
below Than open through the air and us a way? No spark of fire from that heart Goes out through
the wide atmosphere. Body of dust and ashes is not seen, Nor water-laden smoke ascends on high.
All is contained entire within itself, And not of flame, is reason, sense, or thought.

LAO. This proposition is neither more nor less conclusive than the other. But let us come at once
to the answers if there be any.

LIC. There are some certainly and full of sap. Listen.

61.

Second response of the heart to the eyes.

He is a fool, who that alone believes, Which to the sense appears,
who reason scorns.

My flame could never wing its way above.

The conflagration infinite remains unseen. Between the eyes their waters are contained, One
infinite encroaches not upon another. Nature wills not that all should perish. If so much fire's
enough for so much sphere, Say, say, oh eyes, What shall we do? how act In order to make known, or
I, or you, For its deliverance, the sad plight of the soul? If one and other of us both be hid,
How can we move the beauteous god to pity?

LAS. If it is not true it is very well imagined: if it is not so, it is yet a very good excuse
the one for the other; because where there are two forces, of the which one is not greater
than the other, the operation of both must cease, for one resists as much as the other insists,
and one assails while the other defends. If therefore the sea is infinite and the force of tears
in the eyes is immense, it never can be made apparent by speech, nor the impetus of the fire concealed
in the heart break forth, nor can they (the eyes) send forth the twin torrent to the sea if the
heart shelters them with equal tenacity. Therefore the beautiful deity cannot be expected
to be pitiful towards the afflicted soul because of the exhibition of tears which distil from
the eyes, or speech which breaks forth from the breast.

LIB. Now note the answer of the eyes to this proposition:--

62.

Second response of the eyes to the heart.

Alas! we poured into the wavy sea, The strength of our two founts in vain, For two opposing powers
hold it concealed, Lest it go rolling aimlessly adown. The strength unmeasured of the burning
heart, Withholds a passage to the lofty streams; Barring their twofold course unto the sea,
Nature abhors the covered ground.[W] Now say, afflicted heart, what canst thou bring To oppose
against us with an equal force? Oh, where is he, will boast himself to be Exalted by this most
unhappy love, If of thy pain and mine it can be said, The greater they, the less it may be seen.

[W]
Ch'il coperto terren natura aborre.

Both these evils being infinite, like two equally vigorous opposites they curb and suppress each
other: it could not be so if they were both finite, seeing that a
precise equality does not belong to natural things, nor would it be
so if the one were finite, the other infinite; for of a certainty
the one would absorb the other, and they would both be seen, or, at
least one, through the other.

Beneath these sentences, there lies hidden, ethical and natural philosophy, and I leave it to be
searched for, meditated upon and understood, by whosoever will and can. This alone I will not leave
(unsaid) that it is not without reason that the affection of the
heart is said to be the infinite sea by the apprehension of the eyes.[X]
For the object of the mind being infinite, and no definite object
being proposed to the intellect, the will cannot be satisfied by a
finite good, but if besides that, something else is found, it is desired
and sought for; for, as is commonly said, the apex of the inferior
species is the beginning of the superior species, whether the degrees
are taken according to the forms, the which we cannot consider as
being infinite, or according to the modes and reasons of those, in
which way, the highest good being infinite, it would be supposed to
be infinitely communicated, according to the condition of the things,
over which it is diffused.

However, there is no definite species of the universe. I speak according to the figure and
mass; there is no definite species of the intellect; the affections are not a definite species.

[X]
Fire, Flame, Day, Smoke, Night, and so on ... These are all names of various deities which preside
over the Cosmo-psychic Powers.--("The Secret Doctrine.")

LAO. These two powers of the soul, then, never are nor can be perfect for the object, if they
refer to it infinitely?

LIB. So it would be if this infinite were by negative privation or privative negation of the end,
as it is for a more positive affirmation of the end, infinite and
endless.[Y]

[Y] "The deity is one, because it is infinite.

It is triple, because it is ever manifesting." This manifestation is triple in its aspects,
for it requires, as Aristotle has it, three principles for every natural body to become objective:
privation, form and matter. Privation meant in the mind of the great philosopher ... the lowest
plane and world of the Anima Mundi.--("The Secret Doctrine.")

LAO.

You mean, then, two kinds of affinity; the one privative, the which may be towards something
which is power, as, infinite is darkness, the end of which is the position of light; the other
perfecting, which tends to the act and perfection, as infinite is the light, the end of which
would be privation and darkness.[Z] In this, then, the intellect conceives the light, the good, the
beautiful, in so far as the horizon of its capacity extends, and the soul, which drinks of Divine
nectar and the fountain of eternal life in so far as its own vessel allows, and one sees that
the light is beyond the circumference of his horizon, where it can go and penetrate more and more,
and the nectar and fount of living water is infinitely fruitful, so that it can become ever more
and more intoxicated.

[Z] "Darkness adopted illumination in order to make itself visible." Darkness in its radical, metaphysical
basis, is subjective and absolute light; while the latter, in all its seeming effulgence and
glory, is merely a mass of shadows, as it can never be eternal, and is simply an illusion,
or Maya.--("The Secret Doctrine.")

LIB. From this it does not follow that there is imperfection in the object, nor that there is little
satisfaction in the potency, but that the power is included in the
object and beatifically absorbed by it.

Here the eyes imprint upon the heart, that is upon the intelligence, and rouse in the will an
infinite torment of love, where there is no pain because nothing is sought which is not obtained;
but it is happiness, because that which is there sought is always found, and there is no satiety,
inasmuch as there is always appetite, and therefore enjoyment; in
this it is not like the food of the body, the which with satiety loses
enjoyment, has no pleasure before the enjoyment, nor after enjoyment,
but only in the enjoyment itself, and where it passes certain limits
it comes to feel annoyance and disgust.

Behold, then, in a certain analogy, how the highest good ought to be also infinite, in order
that it should not some time turn to evil; as food, which is good for the body, if it is not
limited, may come to be poison.

Thus it is that the water of the ocean does not extinguish that flame, and the rigour of the Arctic circle
does not mitigate that ardour.

Therefore it is bad through (the) one hand, which holds him and rejects him; it holds him, because
it has him for its own; it rejects him because, flying from him, the higher it makes itself
the more he ascends upwards to it; the more he follows it, the further off it appears, by
reason of its high excellence, according as it is said: Accedit homo
ad cor altum, et exaltabitur Deus.

Such blessedness of affection begins in this life, and in this state it has its mode of being.
Hence the heart can say that it is within with the body, and without with the sun, in so far as
the soul with its twin faculty, puts into operation two functions:
the one to vivify and realize the animal body, the other to contemplate
superior things; so that it is in receptive potentiality from above,
as it is in re-active potentiality below, towards the body.

The body is, as it were, dead, and as it were apart from the soul, the which is its life and
its perfection; and the soul is as it were dead, and a thing apart from the superior illuminating
intelligence, from which the intellect is derived as to its nature and acts. Therefore, the heart
is said to be the beginning of life, and not to be alive, it is said to belong to the animating
soul, and that this does not belong to it; because it is inflamed by Divine love, and finally
converted into fire, which can set on fire that which comes near it, seeing that it has contracted
into itself the divinity; it is made god, and consequently in its kind it can inspire others
with love; as the splendour of the sun may be seen and admired in
the moon.

And as for that which belongs to the consideration of the eyes, know, that in the present discourse
they have two functions; one to impress the heart, the other to receive the impression of the
heart; as this also has two functions, one to receive the impressions from the eyes, the other
to impress them. The eyes study the species and propose them to the heart; the heart desires them,
and presents his desire to the eyes; these conceive the light, diffuse it, and kindle the fire
in the heart, which heated and kindled, sends its waters (umore) to them, so that they may
dispose of them[AA] (digeriscano). Thus, firstly, cognition moves the affection, and soon the
affection moves the cognition. The eyes, when they move (the heart), are dry, because they
perform the office of a looking-glass, and of a representer; when they are moved, however, they
become troubled and perturbed, because they perform the office of a diligent executer, seeing
that with the speculating intellect, the beautiful and the good is first seen, then the will
desires it; and later the industrious intellect procures it, follows it, and seeks it. Tearful
eyes signify the difficulty of separating the thing wished for from, the wisher, the which in
order that it should not pall, nor disgust, presents itself as an infinite longing (studio) which
ever has, and ever seeks; seeing that the delight of the gods is ascribed to drinking, not to
having tasted ambrosia, and to the continual enjoyment of food and drink, and not in being
satiated and without desire for them.

Hence they have satiety as it were in movement and apprehension, not in quiet and comprehension;
they are not satiated without appetite, nor are they in a state of desire, without being in
a certain way satiated.

[AA] "Deity is an arcane, living (or moving) FIRE, and the eternal witnesses to this unseen Presence
are Light, Heat, Moisture," this trinity including, and being the
cause of every phenomenon in Nature.--("The Secret Doctrine.")

LAO.

Esuries satiata, satietas esuriens.

LIB. Precisely so.

LAO: From this I can comprehend how, without blame, but with great truth and understanding, it has been
said that Divine love weeps with indescribable groans, because having
all it loves all, and loving all has all.

LIB.

But many comments would be necessary if we would understand that Divine love which is deity
itself; and one easily understands Divine love, so far as it is to
be found in its effects and in the inferior nature.

I do not say that which from the divinity is diffused into things, but that of things which aspires
to the divinity.

LAO. Now of this and of other matters we will discourse more at our ease presently. Let us go.

=Fourth
Dialogue=.

Interlocutors:

SEVERINO. MINUTOLO.

SEV. You will see the origin of the nine blind men, who state nine reasons and special causes
of their blindness, and yet they all agree in one general reason and one common enthusiasm.[AB]

[AB]
May one suggest an analogy between the nine months of gestation,
during which time the foetus goes through various stages and conditions
to complete the "individual cycle of evolution," and the nine blind
men who, at the end of their probation, are brought to see the light--to
be born--illuminated?--("Translator.")

MIN.

Begin with the first!

SEV. The first of these, notwithstanding that he is blind by nature, yet he laments, saying to
the others that he cannot persuade himself that nature has been less courteous to them than
to him; seeing that although they do not (now) see, yet they have
enjoyed sight, and have had experience of that sense, and of the value
of that faculty, of which they have been deprived, while he came into
the world as a mole, to be seen and not to see, to long for the sight
of that which he never had seen.

MIN. Many have fallen in love through report alone.

SEV. They have, says he, the happiness of retaining that Divine image present in the mind,
so that, although blind, they have in imagination that which he cannot have. Then in the sistine
he turns to his guide and begs him to lead him to some precipice, so that he may no longer endure
this contempt and persecution of nature. He says then:

63.

The first blind man.

Ye now afflicted are, who erst were glad, For ye have lost the light that once was yours, Yet
happy, for ye have the twin lights known. These eyes ne'er lighted were, and ne'er were quenched;
But a more grievous destiny is mine Which calls for heavier lamentation. Who will deny that
nature upon me Has frowned more harshly than on you? Conduct me to the precipice, my guide,
And give me peace, for there will I a cure For this my dolour and affliction find; For to be seen,
yet not to see the light, Like an incapable and sightless mole, Is to be useless and a burden
on the earth.

Now follows the other, who, bitten by the serpent of jealousy, became affected in the organ of
sight. He wanders without any guide, unless he has jealousy for his
escort.

He begs some of the bystanders, that seeing there is no remedy for his misfortune, they should
have pity upon him, so that he should no longer feel it; that he
might become as unmanifest to himself as he is to the light, and that
they bury him together with his own misfortune.

He says then:

64.

The second blind man.

Alecta has torn from out her dreadful hair, The infernal worm that with a cruel bite, Has fiercely
fastened on my soul, And of my senses, torn the chief away, Leaving the intellect without its
guide. In vain the soul some consolation seeks. That spiteful, rabid, rancorous jealousy Makes
me go stumbling along the way. If neither magic spell nor sacred plant, Nor virtue hid in the
enchanter's stone, Will yield me the deliverance that I ask: Let one of you, my friends, be
pitiful, And put me out, as are put out my eyes, That they and I together be entombed.

The other follows, who says that he became blind through having been suddenly brought out of
the darkness into a great light: accustomed to behold ordinary beauties, a celestial beauty
was suddenly presented before his eyes--a sun-god--in this manner his sight became dull and the
twin lights which shine at the prow of the soul were put out: for the eyes are like two beacons,
which guide the ship, and this would happen to one brought up in Cimmerian obscurity if he
fixed his eyes suddenly upon the sun. In the sistine he begs for
free passage to Hades, because darkness alone is suitable to a dark
condition. He says:

65.

The third blind man.

If sudden on the sight,
the star of day Should shed his beams on one in darkness reared, Nurtured
beneath the black Cimmerian sky, Far from the radiance of the glorious
sun, The double light, the beacon of the soul He quenches: then as
a foe he hides. Thus were my eyes made dull, inept, Used only, wonted
beauties to behold. Conduct me to the land where darkness reigns!
Wherefore being dead, speak I amidst the folk? A chip of Hell, why
do I mix and move Amongst the living, wherefore do I drink The hated
air, since all my pain Is due to having seen the highest good?

The
fourth blind man comes forward, not blind for the same reason as the
former one. For as that one was blinded through the sudden aspect
of the light, this one is so, from having too frequently beheld it,
or through having fixed his eyes too much upon it, so that he has
lost the sense of all other light, but he does not consider himself
to be blind through looking at that one which has blinded him: and
the same may be said of the sense of sight as of the sense of hearing,
that those whose ears are accustomed to great noises, do not hear
the lesser, as is well known of those who live near the cataracts
of the great river Nile which fall precipitously down to the plain.

MIN.
Thus, all those who have accustomed the body and the soul to things
more difficult and great, are not apt to feel annoyed by smaller difficulties.
 Of all her sisters, Mrs. Tulliver certainly preferred her sister Pullet, not
without a return of preference; but Mrs. Pullet was sorry Bessy had those naughty, awkward
children; she would do the best she could by them, but it was a pity they weren't as good and
as pretty as sister Deane's child. Maggie and Tom, on their part, thought their aunt Pullet
tolerable, chiefly because she was not their aunt Glegg. Tom always declined to go more than
once during his holidays to see either of them. Both his uncles tipped him that once, of course;
but at his aunt Pullet's there were a great many toads to pelt in the cellar-area, so that
he preferred the visit to her. Maggie shuddered at the toads, and dreamed of them horribly,
but she liked her uncle Pullet's musical snuff-box. Still, it was agreed by the sisters, in
Mrs. Tulliver's absence, that the Tulliver blood did not mix well with the Dodson blood; that,
in fact, poor Bessy's children were Tullivers, and that Tom, notwithstanding he had the Dodson
complexion, was likely to be as "contrairy" as his father. As for Maggie, she was the picture
of her aunt Moss, Mr. Tulliver's sister,--a large-boned woman, who had married as poorly as
could be; had no china, and had a husband who had much ado to pay his rent. But when Mrs. Pullet
was alone with Mrs. Tulliver upstairs, the remarks were naturally to the disadvantage of Mrs.
Glegg, and they agreed, in confidence, that there was no knowing what sort of fright sister
Jane would come out next. But their tête-à-tête was curtailed by the appearance of Mrs. Deane
with little Lucy; and Mrs. Tulliver had to look on with a silent pang while Lucy's blond curls
were adjusted. It was quite unaccountable that Mrs. Deane, the thinnest and sallowest of all
the Miss Dodsons, should have had this child, who might have been taken for Mrs. Tulliver's
any day. And Maggie always looked twice as dark as usual when she was by the side of Lucy.

She did to-day, when she and Tom came in from the garden with their father and their uncle Glegg.

"Heyday!" said aunt Glegg, with loud emphasis. "Do little boys and gells come into a room without
taking notice of their uncles and aunts? That wasn't the way when I was a little gell."

"Go and speak to your aunts and uncles, my dears," said Mrs. Tulliver, looking anxious and
melancholy. She wanted to whisper to Maggie a command to go and have her hair brushed.

"Well, and how do you do? And I hope you're good children, are you?" said Aunt Glegg, in the
same loud, emphatic way, as she took their hands, hurting them with her large rings, and kissing
their cheeks much against their desire. "Look up, Tom, look up. Boys as go to boarding-schools
should hold their heads up. Look at me now." Tom declined that pleasure apparently, for he
tried to draw his hand away. "Put your hair behind your ears, Maggie, and keep your frock on
your shoulder."

Aunt Glegg always spoke to them in this loud, emphatic way, as if she considered them deaf,
or perhaps rather idiotic; it was a means, she thought, of making them feel that they were
accountable creatures, and might be a salutary check on naughty tendencies. Bessy's children
were so spoiled--they'd need have somebody to make them feel their duty.

"Well, my dears," said aunt Pullet, in a compassionate voice, "you grow wonderful fast. I doubt
they'll outgrow their strength," she added, looking over their heads, with a melancholy expression,
at their mother. "I think the gell has too much hair. I'd have it thinned and cut shorter,
sister, if I was you; it isn't good for her health. It's that as makes her skin so brown, I
shouldn't wonder. Don't you think so, sister Deane?"

"I can't say, I'm sure, sister," said Mrs. Deane, shutting her lips close again, and looking
at Maggie with a critical eye.

"No, no," said Mr. Tulliver, "the child's healthy enough; there's nothing ails her. There's
red wheat as well as white, for that matter, and some like the dark grain best. But it 'ud
be as well if Bessy 'ud have the child's hair cut, so as it 'ud lie smooth."

A dreadful resolve was gathering in Maggie's breast, but it was arrested by the desire to know
from her aunt Deane whether she would leave Lucy behind. Aunt Deane would hardly ever let Lucy
come to see them. After various reasons for refusal, Mrs. Deane appealed to Lucy herself.

"You wouldn't like to stay behind without mother, should you, Lucy?"

"Yes, please, mother," said Lucy, timidly, blushing very pink all over her little neck.

"Well done, Lucy! Let her stay, Mrs. Deane, let her stay," said Mr. Deane, a large but alert-looking
man, with a type of physique to be seen in all ranks of English society,--bald crown, red whiskers,
full forehead, and general solidity without heaviness. You may see noblemen like Mr. Deane,
and you may see grocers or day-laborers like him; but the keenness of his brown eyes was less
common than his contour.

He held a silver snuff-box very tightly in his hand, and now and then exchanged a pinch with
Mr. Tulliver, whose box was only silver-mounted, so that it was naturally a joke between them
that Mr. Tulliver wanted to exchange snuff-boxes also. Mr. Deane's box had been given him by
the superior partners in the firm to which he belonged, at the same time that they gave him
a share in the business, in acknowledgment of his valuable services as manager. No man was
thought more highly of in St. Ogg's than Mr. Deane; and some persons were even of opinion that
Miss Susan Dodson, who was once held to have made the worst match of all the Dodson sisters,
might one day ride in a better carriage, and live in a better house, even than her sister Pullet.
There was no knowing where a man would stop, who had got his foot into a great mill-owning,
shipowning business like that of Guest & Co., with a banking concern attached. And Mrs. Deane,
as her intimate female friends observed, was proud and "having" enough; she wouldn't let her
husband stand still in the world for want of spurring. Tom never did the same sort of foolish
things as Maggie, having a wonderful instinctive discernment of what would turn to his advantage
or disadvantage; and so it happened, that though he was much more wilful and inflexible than
Maggie, his mother hardly ever called him naughty. But if Tom did make a mistake of that sort,
he espoused it, and stood by it: he "didn't mind." If he broke the lash of his father's gigwhip
by lashing the gate, he couldn't help it,--the whip shouldn't have got caught in the hinge.
If Tom Tulliver whipped a gate, he was convinced, not that the whipping of gates by all boys
was a justifiable act, but that he, Tom Tulliver, was justifiable in whipping that particular
gate, and he wasn't going to be sorry. But Maggie, as she stood crying before the glass, felt
it impossible that she should go down to dinner and endure the severe eyes and severe words
of her aunts, while Tom and Lucy, and Martha, who waited at table, and perhaps her father and
her uncles, would laugh at her; for if Tom had laughed at her, of course every one else would;
and if she had only let her hair alone, she could have sat with Tom and Lucy, and had the apricot
pudding and the custard! What could she do but sob? She sat as helpless and despairing among
her black locks as Ajax among the slaughtered sheep. Very trivial, perhaps, this anguish seems
to weather-worn mortals who have to think of Christmas bills, dead loves, and broken friendships;
but it was not less bitter to Maggie--perhaps it was even more bitter--than what we are fond
of calling antithetically the real troubles of mature life. "Ah, my child, you will have real
troubles to fret about by and by," is the consolation we have almost all of us had administered
to us in our childhood, and have repeated to other children since we have been grown up. We
have all of us sobbed so piteously, standing with tiny bare legs above our little socks, when
we lost sight of our mother or nurse in some strange place; but we can no longer recall the
poignancy of that moment and weep over it, as we do over the remembered sufferings of five
or ten years ago. Every one of those keen moments has left its trace, and lives in us still,
but such traces have blent themselves irrecoverably with the firmer texture of our youth and
manhood; and so it comes that we can look on at the troubles of our children with a smiling
disbelief in the reality of their pain. Is there any one who can recover the experience of
his childhood, not merely with a memory of what he did and what happened to him, of what he
liked and disliked when he was in frock and trousers, but with an intimate penetration, a revived
consciousness of what he felt then, when it was so long from one Midsummer to another; what
he felt when his school fellows shut him out of their game because he would pitch the ball
wrong out of mere wilfulness; or on a rainy day in the holidays, when he didn't know how to
amuse himself, and fell from idleness into mischief, from mischief into defiance, and from
defiance into sulkiness; or when his mother absolutely refused to let him have a tailed coat
that "half," although every other boy of his age had gone into tails already? Surely if we
could recall that early bitterness, and the dim guesses, the strangely perspectiveless conception
of life, that gave the bitterness its intensity, we should not pooh-pooh the griefs of our
children.

"How your husband does spoil that child, Bessy!" said Mrs. Glegg, in a loud "aside," to Mrs.
Tulliver. "It'll be the ruin of her, if you don't take care. My father never brought his children
up so, else we should ha' been a different sort o' family to what we are."

Mrs. Tulliver's domestic sorrows seemed at this moment to have reached the point at which insensibility
begins. She took no notice of her sister's remark, but threw back her capstrings and dispensed
the pudding, in mute resignation.

Mrs. Tulliver had her special reason for this permission: now the dinner was despatched, and
every one's mind disengaged, it was the right moment to communicate Mr. Tulliver's intention
concerning Tom, and it would be as well for Tom himself to be absent. The children were used
to hear themselves talked of as freely as if they were birds, and could understand nothing,
however they might stretch their necks and listen; but on this occasion Mrs. Tulliver manifested
an unusual discretion, because she had recently had evidence that the going to school to a
clergyman was a sore point with Tom, who looked at it as very much on a par with going to school
to a constable. Mrs. Tulliver had a sighing sense that her husband would do as he liked, whatever
sister Glegg said, or sister Pullet either; but at least they would not be able to say, if
the thing turned out ill, that Bessy had fallen in with her husband's folly without letting
her own friends know a word about it.

"Mr. Tulliver," she said, interrupting her husband in his talk with Mr. Deane, "it's time now
to tell the children's aunts and uncles what you're thinking of doing with Tom, isn't it?"

"Very well," said Mr. Tulliver, rather sharply, "I've no objections to tell anybody what I
mean to do with him. I've settled," he added, looking toward Mr. Glegg and Mr. Deane,--"I've
settled to send him to a Mr. Stelling, a parson, down at King's Lorton, there,--an uncommon
clever fellow, I understand, as'll put him up to most things."

There was a rustling demonstration of surprise in the company, such as you may have observed
in a country congregation when they hear an allusion to their week-day affairs from the pulpit.
It was equally astonishing to the aunts and uncles to find a parson introduced into Mr. Tulliver's
family arrangements. As for uncle Pullet, he could hardly have been more thoroughly obfuscated
if Mr. Tulliver had said that he was going to send Tom to the Lord Chancellor; for uncle Pullet
belonged to that extinct class of British yeoman who, dressed in good broadcloth, paid high
rates and taxes, went to church, and ate a particularly good dinner on Sunday, without dreaming
that the British constitution in Church and State had a traceable origin any more than the
solar system and the fixed stars.

It is melancholy, but true, that Mr. Pullet had the most confused idea of a bishop as a sort
of a baronet, who might or might not be a clergyman; and as the rector of his own parish was
a man of high family and fortune, the idea that a clergyman could be a schoolmaster was too
remote from Mr. Pullet's experience to be readily conceivable. I know it is difficult for people
in these instructed times to believe in uncle Pullet's ignorance; but let them reflect on the
remarkable results of a great natural faculty under favoring circumstances. And uncle Pullet
had a great natural faculty for ignorance. He was the first to give utterance to his astonishment.

"Why, what can you be going to send him to a parson for?" he said, with an amazed twinkling
in his eyes, looking at Mr. Glegg and Mr. Deane, to see if they showed any signs of comprehension.

"Why, because the parsons are the best schoolmasters, by what I can make out," said poor Mr.
Tulliver, who, in the maze of this puzzling world, laid hold of any clue with great readiness
and tenacity. "Jacobs at th' academy's no parson, and he's done very bad by the boy; and I
made up my mind, if I send him to school again, it should be to somebody different to Jacobs.
And this Mr. Stelling, by what I can make out, is the sort o' man I want. And I mean my boy
to go to him at Midsummer," he concluded, in a tone of decision, tapping his snuff-box and
taking a pinch.

"You'll have to pay a swinging half-yearly bill, then, eh, Tulliver? The clergymen have highish
notions, in general," said Mr. Deane, taking snuff vigorously, as he always did when wishing
to maintain a neutral position.

"What! do you think the parson'll teach him to know a good sample o' wheat when he sees it,
neighbor Tulliver?" said Mr. Glegg, who was fond of his jest, and having retired from business,
felt that it was not only allowable but becoming in him to take a playful view of things.

"Why, you see, I've got a plan i' my head about Tom," said Mr. Tulliver, pausing after that
statement and lifting up his glass.

"Well, if I may be allowed to speak, and it's seldom as I am," said Mrs. Glegg, with a tone
of bitter meaning, "I should like to know what good is to come to the boy by bringin' him up
above his fortin."

"Why," said Mr. Tulliver, not looking at Mrs. Glegg, but at the male part of his audience,
"you see, I've made up my mind not to bring Tom up to my own business. I've had my thoughts
about it all along, and I made up my mind by what I saw with Garnett and his son. I mean to
put him to some business as he can go into without capital, and I want to give him an eddication
as he'll be even wi' the lawyers and folks, and put me up to a notion now an' then."

Mrs. Glegg emitted a long sort of guttural sound with closed lips, that smiled in mingled pity
and scorn.

"It 'ud be a fine deal better for some people," she said, after that introductory note, "if
they'd let the lawyers alone."

"Is he at the head of a grammar school, then, this clergyman, such as that at Market Bewley?"
said Mr. Deane.

"No, nothing of that," said Mr. Tulliver. "He won't take more than two or three pupils, and
so he'll have the more time to attend to 'em, you know."

"Ah, and get his eddication done the sooner; they can't learn much at a time when there's so
many of 'em," said uncle Pullet, feeling that he was getting quite an insight into this difficult
matter.

"But he'll want the more pay, I doubt," said Mr. Glegg.

"Ay, ay, a cool hundred a year, that's all," said Mr. Tulliver, with some pride at his own
spirited course. "But then, you know, it's an investment; Tom's eddication 'ull be so much
capital to him."

"Ay, there's something in that," said Mr. Glegg. "Well well, neighbor Tulliver, you may be
right, you may be right:

  'When land is gone and money's spent,
  Then learning is most excellent.'

"I remember seeing those two lines wrote on a window at Buxton. But us that have got no learning
had better keep our money, eh, neighbor Pullet?" Mr. Glegg rubbed his knees, and looked very
pleasant.

"Mr. Glegg, I wonder at you," said his wife. "It's very unbecoming in a man o' your age and
belongings."

"What's unbecoming, Mrs. G.?" said Mr. Glegg, winking pleasantly at the company. "My new blue
coat as I've got on?"

"I pity your weakness, Mr. Glegg. I say it's unbecoming to be making a joke when you see your
own kin going headlongs to ruin."

"If you mean me by that," said Mr. Tulliver, considerably nettled, "you needn't trouble yourself
to fret about me. I can manage my own affairs without troubling other folks."

"Bless me!" said Mr. Deane, judiciously introducing a new idea, "why, now I come to think of
it, somebody said Wakem was going to send his son--the deformed lad--to a clergyman, didn't
they, Susan?" (appealing to his wife).

"I can give no account of it, I'm sure," said Mrs. Deane, closing her lips very tightly again.
Mrs. Deane was not a woman to take part in a scene where missiles were flying.

"Well," said Mr. Tulliver, speaking all the more cheerfully, that Mrs. Glegg might see he didn't
mind her, "if Wakem thinks o' sending his son to a clergyman, depend on it I shall make no
mistake i' sending Tom to one. Wakem's as big a scoundrel as Old Harry ever made, but he knows
the length of every man's foot he's got to deal with. Ay, ay, tell me who's Wakem's butcher,
and I'll tell you where to get your meat."

"But lawyer Wakem's son's got a hump-back," said Mrs. Pullet, who felt as if the whole business
had a funereal aspect; "it's more nat'ral to send him to a clergyman."

"Yes," said Mr. Glegg, interpreting Mrs. Pullet's observation with erroneous plausibility,
"you must consider that, neighbor Tulliver; Wakem's son isn't likely to follow any business.
Wakem 'ull make a gentleman of him, poor fellow."

"Mr. Glegg," said Mrs. G., in a tone which implied that her indignation would fizz and ooze
a little, though she was determined to keep it corked up, "you'd far better hold your tongue.
Mr. Tulliver doesn't want to know your opinion nor mine either. There's folks in the world
as know better than everybody else."

"Why, I should think that's you, if we're to trust your own tale," said Mr. Tulliver, beginning
to boil up again.

"Oh, I say nothing," said Mrs. Glegg, sarcastically. "My advice has never been asked, and I
don't give it."

"It'll be the first time, then," said Mr. Tulliver. "It's the only thing you're over-ready
at giving."

"I've been over-ready at lending, then, if I haven't been over-ready at giving," said Mrs.
Glegg. "There's folks I've lent money to, as perhaps I shall repent o' lending money to kin."

"Come, come, come," said Mr. Glegg, soothingly. But Mr. Tulliver was not to be hindered of
his retort.

"You've got a bond for it, I reckon," he said; "and you've had your five per cent, kin or no kin."

"Sister," said Mrs. Tulliver, pleadingly, "drink your wine, and let me give you some almonds
and raisins."

"Bessy, I'm sorry for you," said Mrs. Glegg, very much with the feeling of a cur that seizes
the opportunity of diverting his bark toward the man who carries no stick. "It's poor work
talking o' almonds and raisins."

"Lors, sister Glegg, don't be so quarrelsome," said Mrs. Pullet, beginning to cry a little.
"You may be struck with a fit, getting so red in the face after dinner, and we are but just
out o' mourning, all of us,--and all wi' gowns craped alike and just put by; it's very bad
among sisters."

"I should think it is bad," said Mrs. Glegg. "Things are come to a fine pass when one sister
invites the other to her house o' purpose to quarrel with her and abuse her."

"Softly, softly, Jane; be reasonable, be reasonable," said Mr. Glegg.

But while he was speaking, Mr. Tulliver, who had by no means said enough to satisfy his anger,
burst out again.

"Who wants to quarrel with you?" he said. "It's you as can't let people alone, but must be
gnawing at 'em forever. I should never want to quarrel with any woman if she kept her place."

"My place, indeed!" said Mrs. Glegg, getting rather more shrill. "There's your betters, Mr.
Tulliver, as are dead and in their grave, treated me with a different sort o' respect to what
you do; though I've got a husband as'll sit by and see me abused by them as 'ud never ha' had
the chance if there hadn't been them in our family as married worse than they might ha' done."

"If you talk o' that," said Mr. Tulliver, "my family's as good as yours, and better, for it
hasn't got a damned ill-tempered woman in it!"

"Well," said Mrs. Glegg, rising from her chair, "I don't know whether you think it's a fine
thing to sit by and hear me swore at, Mr. Glegg; but I'm not going to stay a minute longer
in this house. You can stay behind, and come home with the gig, and I'll walk home."

"Dear heart, dear heart!" said Mr. Glegg in a melancholy tone, as he followed his wife out
of the room.

"Mr. Tulliver, how could you talk so?" said Mrs. Tulliver, with the tears in her eyes.

"Let her go," said Mr. Tulliver, too hot to be damped by any amount of tears. "Let her go,
and the sooner the better; she won't be trying to domineer over me again in a hurry."

"Sister Pullet," said Mrs. Tulliver, helplessly, "do you think it 'ud be any use for you to
go after her and try to pacify her?"

"Better not, better not," said Mr. Deane. "You'll make it up another day."

"Then, sisters, shall we go and look at the children?" said Mrs. Tulliver, drying her eyes.

No proposition could have been more seasonable. Mr. Tulliver felt very much as if the air had
been cleared of obtrusive flies now the women were out of the room. There were few things he
liked better than a chat with Mr. Deane, whose close application to business allowed the pleasure
very rarely. Mr. Deane, he considered, was the "knowingest" man of his acquaintance, and he
had besides a ready causticity of tongue that made an agreeable supplement to Mr. Tulliver's
own tendency that way, which had remained in rather an inarticulate condition. And now the
women were gone, they could carry on their serious talk without frivolous interruption. They
could exchange their views concerning the Duke of Wellington, whose conduct in the Catholic
Question had thrown such an entirely new light on his character; and speak slightingly of his
conduct at the battle of Waterloo, which he would never have won if there hadn't been a great
many Englishmen at his back, not to speak of Blucher and the Prussians, who, as Mr. Tulliver
had heard from a person of particular knowledge in that matter, had come up in the very nick
of time; though here there was a slight dissidence, Mr. Deane remarking that he was not disposed
to give much credit to the Prussians,--the build of their vessels, together with the unsatisfactory
character of transactions in Dantzic beer, inclining him to form rather a low view of Prussian
pluck generally. Rather beaten on this ground, Mr. Tulliver proceeded to express his fears
that the country could never again be what it used to be; but Mr. Deane, attached to a firm
of which the returns were on the increase, naturally took a more lively view of the present,
and had some details to give concerning the state of the imports, especially in hides and spelter,
which soothed Mr. Tulliver's imagination by throwing into more distant perspective the period
when the country would become utterly the prey of Papists and Radicals, and there would be
no more chance for honest men.

Uncle Pullet sat by and listened with twinkling eyes to these high matters. He didn't understand
politics himself,--thought they were a natural gift,--but by what he could make out, this Duke
of Wellington was no better than he should be.

Chapter VIII

Mr. Tulliver Shows His Weaker Side

"Suppose sister Glegg should call her money in; it 'ud be very awkward for you to have to raise
five hundred pounds now," said Mrs. Tulliver to her husband that evening, as she took a plaintive
review of the day.

Mrs. Tulliver had lived thirteen years with her husband, yet she retained in all the freshness
of her early married life a facility of saying things which drove him in the opposite direction
to the one she desired. Some minds are wonderful for keeping their bloom in this way, as a
patriarchal goldfish apparently retains to the last its youthful illusion that it can swim
in a straight line beyond the encircling glass. Mrs. Tulliver was an amiable fish of this kind,
and after running her head against the same resisting medium for thirteen years would go at
it again to-day with undulled alacrity.

This observation of hers tended directly to convince Mr. Tulliver that it would not be at all
awkward for him to raise five hundred pounds; and when Mrs. Tulliver became rather pressing
to know how he would raise it without mortgaging the mill and the house which he had said he
never would mortgage, since nowadays people were none so ready to lend money without security,
Mr. Tulliver, getting warm, declared that Mrs. Glegg might do as she liked about calling in
her money, he should pay it in whether or not. He was not going to be beholden to his wife's
sisters. When a man had married into a family where there was a whole litter of women, he might
have plenty to put up with if he chose. But Mr. Tulliver did not choose.

Mrs. Tulliver cried a little in a trickling, quiet way as she put on her nightcap; but presently
sank into a comfortable sleep, lulled by the thought that she would talk everything over with
her sister Pullet to-morrow, when she was to take the children to Garum Firs to tea. Not that
she looked forward to any distinct issue from that talk; but it seemed impossible that past
events should be so obstinate as to remain unmodified when they were complained against.

Her husband lay awake rather longer, for he too was thinking of a visit he would pay on the
morrow; and his ideas on the subject were not of so vague and soothing a kind as those of his
amiable partner.

Mr. Tulliver, when under the influence of a strong feeling, had a promptitude in action that
may seem inconsistent with that painful sense of the complicated, puzzling nature of human
affairs under which his more dispassionate deliberations were conducted; but it is really not
improbable that there was a direct relation between these apparently contradictory phenomena,
since I have observed that for getting a strong impression that a skein is tangled there is
nothing like snatching hastily at a single thread. It was owing to this promptitude that Mr.
Tulliver was on horseback soon after dinner the next day (he was not dyspeptic) on his way
to Basset to see his sister Moss and her husband. For having made up his mind irrevocably that
he would pay Mrs. Glegg her loan of five hundred pounds, it naturally occurred to him that
he had a promissory note for three hundred pounds lent to his brother-in-law Moss; and if the
said brother-in-law could manage to pay in the money within a given time, it would go far to
lessen the fallacious air of inconvenience which Mr. Tulliver's spirited step might have worn
in the eyes of weak people who require to know precisely how a thing is to be done before they
are strongly confident that it will be easy.

For Mr. Tulliver was in a position neither new nor striking, but, like other every-day things,
sure to have a cumulative effect that will be felt in the long run: he was held to be a much
more substantial man than he really was. And as we are all apt to believe what the world believes
about us, it was his habit to think of failure and ruin with the same sort of remote pity with
which a spare, long-necked man hears that his plethoric short-necked neighbor is stricken with
apoplexy. He had been always used to hear pleasant jokes about his advantages as a man who
worked his own mill, and owned a pretty bit of land; and these jokes naturally kept up his
sense that he was a man of considerable substance. They gave a pleasant flavor to his glass
on a market-day, and if it had not been for the recurrence of half-yearly payments, Mr. Tulliver
would really have forgotten that there was a mortgage of two thousand pounds on his very desirable
freehold. That was not altogether his own fault, since one of the thousand pounds was his sister's
fortune, which he had to pay on her marriage; and a man who has neighbors that will go to law
with him is not likely to pay off his mortgages, especially if he enjoys the good opinion of
acquaintances who want to borrow a hundred pounds on security too lofty to be represented by
parchment. Our friend Mr. Tulliver had a good-natured fibre in him, and did not like to give
harsh refusals even to his sister, who had not only come in to the world in that superfluous
way characteristic of sisters, creating a necessity for mortgages, but had quite thrown herself
away in marriage, and had crowned her mistakes by having an eighth baby. On this point Mr.
Tulliver was conscious of being a little weak; but he apologized to himself by saying that
poor Gritty had been a good-looking wench before she married Moss; he would sometimes say this
even with a slight tremulousness in his voice. But this morning he was in a mood more becoming
a man of business, and in the course of his ride along the Basset lanes, with their deep ruts,--lying
so far away from a market-town that the labor of drawing produce and manure was enough to take
away the best part of the profits on such poor land as that parish was made of,--he got up
a due amount of irritation against Moss as a man without capital, who, if murrain and blight
were abroad, was sure to have his share of them, and who, the more you tried to help him out
of the mud, would sink the further in. It would do him good rather than harm, now, if he were
obliged to raise this three hundred pounds; it would make him look about him better, and not
act so foolishly about his wool this year as he did the last; in fact, Mr. Tulliver had been
too easy with his brother-in-law, and because he had let the interest run on for two years,
Moss was likely enough to think that he should never be troubled about the principal. But Mr.
Tulliver was determined not to encourage such shuffling people any longer; and a ride along
the Basset lanes was not likely to enervate a man's resolution by softening his temper. The
deep-trodden hoof-marks, made in the muddiest days of winter, gave him a shake now and then
which suggested a rash but stimulating snarl at the father of lawyers, who, whether by means
of his hoof or otherwise, had doubtless something to do with this state of the roads; and the
abundance of foul land and neglected fences that met his eye, though they made no part of his
brother Moss's farm, strongly contributed to his dissatisfaction with that unlucky agriculturist.
If this wasn't Moss's fallow, it might have been; Basset was all alike; it was a beggarly parish,
in Mr. Tulliver's opinion, and his opinion was certainly not groundless. Basset had a poor
soil, poor roads, a poor non-resident landlord, a poor non-resident vicar, and rather less
than half a curate, also poor. If any one strongly impressed with the power of the human mind
to triumph over circumstances will contend that the parishioners of Basset might nevertheless
have been a very superior class of people, I have nothing to urge against that abstract proposition;
I only know that, in point of fact, the Basset mind was in strict keeping with its circumstances.
The muddy lanes, green or clayey, that seemed to the unaccustomed eye to lead nowhere but into
each other, did really lead, with patience, to a distant high-road; but there were many feet
in Basset which they led more frequently to a centre of dissipation, spoken of formerly as
the "Markis o' Granby," but among intimates as "Dickison's." A large low room with a sanded
floor; a cold scent of tobacco, modified by undetected beer-dregs; Mr. Dickison leaning against
the door-post with a melancholy pimpled face, looking as irrelevant to the daylight as a last
night's guttered candle,--all this may not seem a very seductive form of temptation; but the
majority of men in Basset found it fatally alluring when encountered on their road toward four
o'clock on a wintry afternoon; and if any wife in Basset wished to indicate that her husband
was not a pleasure-seeking man, she could hardly do it more emphatically than by saying that
he didn't spend a shilling at Dickison's from one Whitsuntide to another. Mrs. Moss had said
so of her husband more than once, when her brother was in a mood to find fault with him, as
he certainly was to-day. And nothing could be less pacifying to Mr. Tulliver than the behavior
of the farmyard gate, which he no sooner attempted to push open with his riding-stick than
it acted as gates without the upper hinge are known to do, to the peril of shins, whether equine
or human. He was about to get down and lead his horse through the damp dirt of the hollow farmyard,
shadowed drearily by the large half-timbered buildings, up to the long line of tumble-down
dwelling-houses standing on a raised causeway; but the timely appearance of a cowboy saved
him that frustration of a plan he had determined on,--namely, not to get down from his horse
during this visit. If a man means to be hard, let him keep in his saddle and speak from that
height, above the level of pleading eyes, and with the command of a distant horizon. Mrs. Moss
heard the sound of the horse's feet, and, when her brother rode up, was already outside the
kitchen door, with a half-weary smile on her face, and a black-eyed baby in her arms. Mrs.
Moss's face bore a faded resemblance to her brother's; baby's little fat hand, pressed against
her cheek, seemed to show more strikingly that the cheek was faded.

"Brother, I'm glad to see you," she said, in an affectionate tone. "I didn't look for you to-day.
How do you do?"

"Oh, pretty well, Mrs. Moss, pretty well," answered the brother, with cool deliberation, as
if it were rather too forward of her to ask that question. She knew at once that her brother
was not in a good humor; he never called her Mrs. Moss except when he was angry, and when they
were in company. But she thought it was in the order of nature that people who were poorly
off should be snubbed. Mrs. Moss did not take her stand on the equality of the human race;
she was a patient, prolific, loving-hearted woman.

"Your husband isn't in the house, I suppose?" added Mr. Tulliver after a grave pause, during
which four children had run out, like chickens whose mother has been suddenly in eclipse behind
the hen-coop.

"No," said Mrs. Moss, "but he's only in the potato-field yonders. Georgy, run to the Far Close
in a minute, and tell father your uncle's come. You'll get down, brother, won't you, and take
something?"

"No, no; I can't get down. I must be going home again directly," said Mr. Tulliver, looking
at the distance.

"And how's Mrs. Tulliver and the children?" said Mrs. Moss, humbly, not daring to press her
invitation.

"Oh, pretty well. Tom's going to a new school at Midsummer,--a deal of expense to me. It's
bad work for me, lying out o' my money."

"I wish you'd be so good as let the children come and see their cousins some day. My little
uns want to see their cousin Maggie so as never was. And me her godmother, and so fond of her;
there's nobody 'ud make a bigger fuss with her, according to what they've got. And I know she
likes to come, for she's a loving child, and how quick and clever she is, to be sure!"

If Mrs. Moss had been one of the most astute women in the world, instead of being one of the
simplest, she could have thought of nothing more likely to propitiate her brother than this
praise of Maggie. He seldom found any one volunteering praise of "the little wench"; it was
usually left entirely to himself to insist on her merits. But Maggie always appeared in the
most amiable light at her aunt Moss's; it was her Alsatia, where she was out of the reach of
law,--if she upset anything, dirtied her shoes, or tore her frock, these things were matters
of course at her aunt Moss's. In spite of himself, Mr. Tulliver's eyes got milder, and he did
not look away from his sister as he said,--

"Ay; she's fonder o' you than o' the other aunts, I think. She takes after our family: not
a bit of her mother's in her."

"Moss says she's just like what I used to be," said Mrs. Moss, "though I was never so quick
and fond o' the books. But I think my Lizzy's like her; she's sharp. Come here, Lizzy, my dear,
and let your uncle see you; he hardly knows you, you grow so fast."

Lizzy, a black-eyed child of seven, looked very shy when her mother drew her forward, for the
small Mosses were much in awe of their uncle from Dorlcote Mill. She was inferior enough to
Maggie in fire and strength of expression to make the resemblance between the two entirely
flattering to Mr. Tulliver's fatherly love.

"Ay, they're a bit alike," he said, looking kindly at the little figure in the soiled pinafore.
"They both take after our mother. You've got enough o' gells, Gritty," he added, in a tone
half compassionate, half reproachful.

"Four of 'em, bless 'em!" said Mrs. Moss, with a sigh, stroking Lizzy's hair on each side of
her forehead; "as many as there's boys. They've got a brother apiece."

"Ah, but they must turn out and fend for themselves," said Mr. Tulliver, feeling that his severity
was relaxing and trying to brace it by throwing out a wholesome hint "They mustn't look to
hanging on their brothers."

"No; but I hope their brothers 'ull love the poor things, and remember they came o' one father
and mother; the lads 'ull never be the poorer for that," said Mrs. Moss, flashing out with
hurried timidity, like a half-smothered fire.

Mr. Tulliver gave his horse a little stroke on the flank, then checked it, and said angrily,
"Stand still with you!" much to the astonishment of that innocent animal.

"And the more there is of 'em, the more they must love one another," Mrs. Moss went on, looking
at her children with a didactic purpose. But she turned toward her brother again to say, "Not
but what I hope your boy 'ull allays be good to his sister, though there's but two of 'em,
like you and me, brother."

The arrow went straight to Mr. Tulliver's heart. He had not a rapid imagination, but the thought
of Maggie was very near to him, and he was not long in seeing his relation to his own sister
side by side with Tom's relation to Maggie. Would the little wench ever be poorly off, and
Tom rather hard upon her?

"Ay, ay, Gritty," said the miller, with a new softness in his tone; "but I've allays done what
I could for you," he added, as if vindicating himself from a reproach.

"I'm not denying that, brother, and I'm noways ungrateful," said poor Mrs. Moss, too fagged
by toil and children to have strength left for any pride. "But here's the father. What a while
you've been, Moss!"

"While, do you call it?" said Mr. Moss, feeling out of breath and injured. "I've been running
all the way. Won't you 'light, Mr. Tulliver?"

"Well, I'll just get down and have a bit o' talk with you in the garden," said Mr. Tulliver,
thinking that he should be more likely to show a due spirit of resolve if his sister were not
present.

He got down, and passed with Mr. Moss into the garden, toward an old yew-tree arbor, while
his sister stood tapping her baby on the back and looking wistfully after them.

Their entrance into the yew-tree arbor surprised several fowls that were recreating themselves
by scratching deep holes in the dusty ground, and at once took flight with much pother and
cackling. Mr. Tulliver sat down on the bench, and tapping the ground curiously here and there
with his stick, as if he suspected some hollowness, opened the conversation by observing, with
something like a snarl in his tone,--

"Why, you've got wheat again in that Corner Close, I see; and never a bit o' dressing on it.
You'll do no good with it this year."

Mr. Moss, who, when he married Miss Tulliver, had been regarded as the buck of Basset, now
wore a beard nearly a week old, and had the depressed, unexpectant air of a machine-horse.
He answered in a patient-grumbling tone, "Why, poor farmers like me must do as they can; they
must leave it to them as have got money to play with, to put half as much into the ground as
they mean to get out of it."

"I don't know who should have money to play with, if it isn't them as can borrow money without
paying interest," said Mr. Tulliver, who wished to get into a slight quarrel; it was the most
natural and easy introduction to calling in money.

"I know I'm behind with the interest," said Mr. Moss, "but I was so unlucky wi' the wool last
year; and what with the Missis being laid up so, things have gone awk'arder nor usual."

"Ay," snarled Mr. Tulliver, "there's folks as things 'ull allays go awk'ard with; empty sacks
'ull never stand upright."

"Well, I don't know what fault you've got to find wi' me, Mr. Tulliver," said Mr. Moss, deprecatingly;
"I know there isn't a day-laborer works harder."

"What's the use o' that," said Mr. Tulliver, sharply, "when a man marries, and's got no capital
to work his farm but his wife's bit o' fortin? I was against it from the first; but you'd neither
of you listen to me. And I can't lie out o' my money any longer, for I've got to pay five hundred
o' Mrs. Glegg's, and there'll be Tom an expense to me. I should find myself short, even saying
I'd got back all as is my own. You must look about and see how you can pay me the three hundred
pound."

"Well, if that's what you mean," said Mr. Moss, looking blankly before him, "we'd better be
sold up, and ha' done with it; I must part wi' every head o' stock I've got, to pay you and
the landlord too."

Poor relations are undeniably irritating,--their existence is so entirely uncalled for on our
part, and they are almost always very faulty people. Mr. Tulliver had succeeded in getting
quite as much irritated with Mr. Moss as he had desired, and he was able to say angrily, rising
from his seat,--

"Well, you must do as you can. I can't find money for everybody else as well as myself. I must
look to my own business and my own family. I can't lie out o' my money any longer. You must
raise it as quick as you can."

Mr. Tulliver walked abruptly out of the arbor as he uttered the last sentence, and, without
looking round at Mr. Moss, went on to the kitchen door, where the eldest boy was holding his
horse, and his sister was waiting in a state of wondering alarm, which was not without its
alleviations, for baby was making pleasant gurgling sounds, and performing a great deal of
finger practice on the faded face. Mrs. Moss had eight children, but could never overcome her
regret that the twins had not lived. Mr. Moss thought their removal was not without its consolations.
"Won't you come in, brother?" she said, looking anxiously at her husband, who was walking slowly
up, while Mr. Tulliver had his foot already in the stirrup.

"No, no; good-by," said he, turning his horse's head, and riding away.

No man could feel more resolute till he got outside the yard gate, and a little way along the
deep-rutted lane; but before he reached the next turning, which would take him out of sight
of the dilapidated farm-buildings, he appeared to be smitten by some sudden thought. He checked
his horse, and made it stand still in the same spot for two or three minutes, during which
he turned his head from side to side in a melancholy way, as if he were looking at some painful
object on more sides than one. Evidently, after his fit of promptitude, Mr. Tulliver was relapsing
into the sense that this is a puzzling world. He turned his horse, and rode slowly back, giving
vent to the climax of feeling which had determined this movement by saying aloud, as he struck
his horse, "Poor little wench! she'll have nobody but Tom, belike, when I'm gone."

Mr. Tulliver's return into the yard was descried by several young Mosses, who immediately ran
in with the exciting news to their mother, so that Mrs. Moss was again on the door-step when
her brother rode up. She had been crying, but was rocking baby to sleep in her arms now, and
made no ostentatious show of sorrow as her brother looked at her, but merely said:

"The father's gone to the field, again, if you want him, brother."

"No, Gritty, no," said Mr. Tulliver, in a gentle tone. "Don't you fret,--that's all,--I'll
make a shift without the money a bit, only you must be as clever and contriving as you can."

Mrs. Moss's tears came again at this unexpected kindness, and she could say nothing.

"Come, come!--the little wench shall come and see you. I'll bring her and Tom some day before
he goes to school. You mustn't fret. I'll allays be a good brother to you."

"Thank you for that word, brother," said Mrs. Moss, drying her tears; then turning to Lizzy,
she said, "Run now, and fetch the colored egg for cousin Maggie." Lizzy ran in, and quickly
reappeared with a small paper parcel.

"It's boiled hard, brother, and colored with thrums, very pretty; it was done o' purpose for
Maggie. Will you please to carry it in your pocket?"

"Ay, ay," said Mr. Tulliver, putting it carefully in his side pocket. "Good-by."

And so the respectable miller returned along the Basset lanes rather more puzzled than before
as to ways and means, but still with the sense of a danger escaped. It had come across his
mind that if he were hard upon his sister, it might somehow tend to make Tom hard upon Maggie
at some distant day, when her father was no longer there to take her part; for simple people,
like our friend Mr. Tulliver, are apt to clothe unimpeachable feelings in erroneous ideas,
and this was his confused way of explaining to himself that his love and anxiety for "the little
wench" had given him a new sensibility toward his sister.

Moreover, the preparation for a visit being always a serious affair in the Dodson family, Martha
was enjoined to have Mrs. Tulliver's room ready an hour earlier than usual, that the laying
out of the best clothes might not be deferred till the last moment, as was sometimes the case
in families of lax views, where the ribbon-strings were never rolled up, where there was little
or no wrapping in silver paper, and where the sense that the Sunday clothes could be got at
quite easily produced no shock to the mind.

Uncle Pullet had seen the expected party approaching from the window, and made haste to unbar
and unchain the front door, kept always in this fortified condition from fear of tramps, who
might be supposed to know of the glass case of stuffed birds in the hall, and to contemplate
rushing in and carrying it away on their heads. Aunt Pullet, too, appeared at the doorway,
and as soon as her sister was within hearing said, "Stop the children, for God's sake! Bessy;
don't let 'em come up the door-steps; Sally's bringing the old mat and the duster, to rub their
shoes."

Mrs. Pullet's front-door mats were by no means intended to wipe shoes on; the very scraper
had a deputy to do its dirty work. Tom rebelled particularly against this shoewiping, which
he always considered in the light of an indignity to his sex. He felt it as the beginning of
the disagreeables incident to a visit at aunt Pullet's, where he had once been compelled to
sit with towels wrapped round his boots; a fact which may serve to correct the too-hasty conclusion
that a visit to Garum Firs must have been a great treat to a young gentleman fond of animals,--fond,
that is, of throwing stones at them.

The next disagreeable was confined to his feminine companions; it was the mounting of the polished
oak stairs, which had very handsome carpets rolled up and laid by in a spare bedroom, so that
the ascent of these glossy steps might have served, in barbarous times, as a trial by ordeal
from which none but the most spotless virtue could have come off with unbroken limbs. Sophy's
weakness about these polished stairs was always a subject of bitter remonstrance on Mrs. Glegg's
part; but Mrs. Tulliver ventured on no comment, only thinking to herself it was a mercy when
she and the children were safe on the landing.

"Mrs. Gray has sent home my new bonnet, Bessy," said Mrs. Pullet, in a pathetic tone, as Mrs.
Tulliver adjusted her cap.

"Has she, sister?" said Mrs. Tulliver, with an air of much interest. "And how do you like it?"

"It's apt to make a mess with clothes, taking 'em out and putting 'em in again," said Mrs.
Pullet, drawing a bunch of keys from her pocket and looking at them earnestly, "but it 'ud
be a pity for you to go away without seeing it. There's no knowing what may happen."

Mrs. Pullet shook her head slowly at this last serious consideration, which determined her
to single out a particular key.

"I'm afraid it'll be troublesome to you getting it out, sister," said Mrs. Tulliver; "but I
should like to see what sort of a crown she's made you."

Mrs. Pullet rose with a melancholy air and unlocked one wing of a very bright wardrobe, where
you may have hastily supposed she would find a new bonnet. Not at all. Such a supposition could
only have arisen from a too-superficial acquaintance with the habits of the Dodson family.
In this wardrobe Mrs. Pullet was seeking something small enough to be hidden among layers of
linen,--it was a door-key.

"You must come with me into the best room," said Mrs. Pullet.

"May the children come too, sister?" inquired Mrs. Tulliver, who saw that Maggie and Lucy were
looking rather eager.

"Well," said aunt Pullet, reflectively, "it'll perhaps be safer for 'em to come; they'll be
touching something if we leave 'em behind."

So they went in procession along the bright and slippery corridor, dimly lighted by the semi-lunar
top of the window which rose above the closed shutter; it was really quite solemn. Aunt Pullet
paused and unlocked a door which opened on something still more solemn than the passage,--a
darkened room, in which the outer light, entering feebly, showed what looked like the corpses
of furniture in white shrouds. Everything that was not shrouded stood with its legs upward.
Lucy laid hold of Maggie's frock, and Maggie's heart beat rapidly.

Aunt Pullet half-opened the shutter and then unlocked the wardrobe, with a melancholy deliberateness
which was quite in keeping with the funereal solemnity of the scene. The delicious scent of
rose-leaves that issued from the wardrobe made the process of taking out sheet after sheet
of silver paper quite pleasant to assist at, though the sight of the bonnet at last was an
anticlimax to Maggie, who would have preferred something more strikingly preternatural. But
few things could have been more impressive to Mrs. Tulliver. She looked all round it in silence
for some moments, and then said emphatically, "Well, sister, I'll never speak against the full
crowns again!"

It was a great concession, and Mrs. Pullet felt it; she felt something was due to it.

"You'd like to see it on, sister?" she said sadly. "I'll open the shutter a bit further."

"Well, if you don't mind taking off your cap, sister," said Mrs. Tulliver.

Mrs. Pullet took off her cap, displaying the brown silk scalp with a jutting promontory of
curls which was common to the more mature and judicious women of those times, and placing the
bonnet on her head, turned slowly round, like a draper's lay-figure, that Mrs. Tulliver might
miss no point of view.

"I've sometimes thought there's a loop too much o' ribbon on this left side, sister; what do
you think?" said Mrs. Pullet.

Mrs. Tulliver looked earnestly at the point indicated, and turned her head on one side. "Well,
I think it's best as it is; if you meddled with it, sister, you might repent."

"That's true," said aunt Pullet, taking off the bonnet and looking at it contemplatively.

"How much might she charge you for that bonnet, sister?" said Mrs. Tulliver, whose mind was
actively engaged on the possibility of getting a humble imitation of this chef-d'œuvre made
from a piece of silk she had at home.

Mrs. Pullet screwed up her mouth and shook her head, and then whispered, "Pullet pays for it;
he said I was to have the best bonnet at Garum Church, let the next best be whose it would."

She began slowly to adjust the trimmings, in preparation for returning it to its place in the
wardrobe, and her thoughts seemed to have taken a melancholy turn, for she shook her head.

"Ah," she said at last, "I may never wear it twice, sister; who knows?"

"Don't talk o' that sister," answered Mrs. Tulliver. "I hope you'll have your health this summer."

"Ah! but there may come a death in the family, as there did soon after I had my green satin
bonnet. Cousin Abbott may go, and we can't think o' wearing crape less nor half a year for him."

"That would be unlucky," said Mrs. Tulliver, entering thoroughly into the possibility of an
inopportune decease. "There's never so much pleasure i' wearing a bonnet the second year, especially
when the crowns are so chancy,--never two summers alike."

"Ah, it's the way i' this world," said Mrs. Pullet, returning the bonnet to the wardrobe and
locking it up. She maintained a silence characterized by head-shaking, until they had all issued
from the solemn chamber and were in her own room again. Then, beginning to cry, she said, "Sister,
if you should never see that bonnet again till I'm dead and gone, you'll remember I showed
it you this day."

Mrs. Tulliver felt that she ought to be affected, but she was a woman of sparse tears, stout
and healthy; she couldn't cry so much as her sister Pullet did, and had often felt her deficiency
at funerals. Her effort to bring tears into her eyes issued in an odd contraction of her face.
Maggie, looking on attentively, felt that there was some painful mystery about her aunt's bonnet
which she was considered too young to understand; indignantly conscious, all the while, that
she could have understood that, as well as everything else, if she had been taken into confidence.

When they went down, uncle Pullet observed, with some acumen, that he reckoned the missis had
been showing her bonnet,--that was what had made them so long upstairs. With Tom the interval
had seemed still longer, for he had been seated in irksome constraint on the edge of a sofa
directly opposite his uncle Pullet, who regarded him with twinkling gray eyes, and occasionally
addressed him as "Young sir."

"Well, young sir, what do you learn at school?" was a standing question with uncle Pullet;
whereupon Tom always looked sheepish, rubbed his hands across his face, and answered, "I don't
know." It was altogether so embarrassing to be seated tête-à-tête with uncle Pullet, that Tom
could not even look at the prints on the walls, or the flycages, or the wonderful flower-pots;
he saw nothing but his uncle's gaiters. Not that Tom was in awe of his uncle's mental superiority;
indeed, he had made up his mind that he didn't want to be a gentleman farmer, because he shouldn't
like to be such a thin-legged, silly fellow as his uncle Pullet,--a molly-coddle, in fact.
A boy's sheepishness is by no means a sign of overmastering reverence; and while you are making
encouraging advances to him under the idea that he is overwhelmed by a sense of your age and
wisdom, ten to one he is thinking you extremely queer. The only consolation I can suggest to
you is, that the Greek boys probably thought the same of Aristotle. It is only when you have
mastered a restive horse, or thrashed a drayman, or have got a gun in your hand, that these
shy juniors feel you to be a truly admirable and enviable character. At least, I am quite sure
of Tom Tulliver's sentiments on these points. In very tender years, when he still wore a lace
border under his outdoor cap, he was often observed peeping through the bars of a gate and
making minatory gestures with his small forefinger while he scolded the sheep with an inarticulate
burr, intended to strike terror into their astonished minds; indicating thus early that desire
for mastery over the inferior animals, wild and domestic, including cockchafers, neighbors'
dogs, and small sisters, which in all ages has been an attribute of so much promise for the
fortunes of our race. Now, Mr. Pullet never rode anything taller than a low pony, and was the
least predatory of men, considering firearms dangerous, as apt to go off of themselves by nobody's
particular desire. So that Tom was not without strong reasons when, in confidential talk with
a chum, he had described uncle Pullet as a nincompoop, taking care at the same time to observe
that he was a very "rich fellow."

The only alleviating circumstance in a tête-à-tête with uncle Pullet was that he kept a variety
of lozenges and peppermint-drops about his person, and when at a loss for conversation, he
filled up the void by proposing a mutual solace of this kind.

"Do you like peppermints, young sir?" required only a tacit answer when it was accompanied
by a presentation of the article in question.

The appearance of the little girls suggested to uncle Pullet the further solace of small sweet-cakes,
of which he also kept a stock under lock and key for his own private eating on wet days; but
the three children had no sooner got the tempting delicacy between their fingers, than aunt
Pullet desired them to abstain from eating it till the tray and the plates came, since with
those crisp cakes they would make the floor "all over" crumbs. Lucy didn't mind that much,
for the cake was so pretty, she thought it was rather a pity to eat it; but Tom, watching his
opportunity while the elders were talking, hastily stowed it in his mouth at two bites, and
chewed it furtively. As for Maggie, becoming fascinated, as usual, by a print of Ulysses and
Nausicaa, which uncle Pullet had bought as a "pretty Scripture thing," she presently let fall
her cake, and in an unlucky movement crushed it beneath her foot,--a source of so much agitation
to aunt Pullet and conscious disgrace to Maggie, that she began to despair of hearing the musical
snuff-box to-day, till, after some reflection, it occurred to her that Lucy was in high favor
enough to venture on asking for a tune. So she whispered to Lucy; and Lucy, who always did
what she was desired to do, went up quietly to her uncle's knee, and blush-all over her neck
while she fingered her necklace, said, "Will you please play us a tune, uncle?"

Lucy thought it was by reason of some exceptional talent in uncle Pullet that the snuff-box
played such beautiful tunes, and indeed the thing was viewed in that light by the majority
of his neighbors in Garum. Mr. Pullet had bought the box, to begin with, and he understood
winding it up, and knew which tune it was going to play beforehand; altogether the possession
of this unique "piece of music" was a proof that Mr. Pullet's character was not of that entire
nullity which might otherwise have been attributed to it. But uncle Pullet, when entreated
to exhibit his accomplishment, never depreciated it by a too-ready consent. "We'll see about
it," was the answer he always gave, carefully abstaining from any sign of compliance till a
suitable number of minutes had passed. Uncle Pullet had a programme for all great social occasions,
and in this way fenced himself in from much painful confusion and perplexing freedom of will.

Perhaps the suspense did heighten Maggie's enjoyment when the fairy tune began; for the first
time she quite forgot that she had a load on her mind, that Tom was angry with her; and by
the time "Hush, ye pretty warbling choir," had been played, her face wore that bright look
of happiness, while she sat immovable with her hands clasped, which sometimes comforted her
mother with the sense that Maggie could look pretty now and then, in spite of her brown skin.
But when the magic music ceased, she jumped up, and running toward Tom, put her arm round his
neck and said, "Oh, Tom, isn't it pretty?"

Lest you should think it showed a revolting insensibility in Tom that he felt any new anger
toward Maggie for this uncalled-for and, to him, inexplicable caress, I must tell you that
he had his glass of cowslip wine in his hand, and that she jerked him so as to make him spill
half of it. He must have been an extreme milksop not to say angrily, "Look there, now!" especially
when his resentment was sanctioned, as it was, by general disapprobation of Maggie's behavior.

"Why don't you sit still, Maggie?" her mother said peevishly.

"Little gells mustn't come to see me if they behave in that way," said aunt Pullet.

"Why, you're too rough, little miss," said uncle Pullet.

Poor Maggie sat down again, with the music all chased out of her soul, and the seven small
demons all in again.

Mrs. Tulliver, foreseeing nothing but misbehavior while the children remained indoors, took
an early opportunity of suggesting that, now they were rested after their walk, they might
go and play out of doors; and aunt Pullet gave permission, only enjoining them not to go off
the paved walks in the garden, and if they wanted to see the poultry fed, to view them from
a distance on the horse-block; a restriction which had been imposed ever since Tom had been
found guilty of running after the peacock, with an illusory idea that fright would make one
of its feathers drop off.

Mrs. Tulliver's thoughts had been temporarily diverted from the quarrel with Mrs. Glegg by
millinery and maternal cares, but now the great theme of the bonnet was thrown into perspective,
and the children were out of the way, yesterday's anxieties recurred.

"It weighs on my mind so as never was," she said, by way of opening the subject, "sister Glegg's
leaving the house in that way. I'm sure I'd no wish t' offend a sister."

"Ah," said aunt Pullet, "there's no accounting for what Jane 'ull do. I wouldn't speak of it
out o' the family, if it wasn't to Dr. Turnbull; but it's my belief Jane lives too low. I've
said so to Pullet often and often, and he knows it."

"Why, you said so last Monday was a week, when we came away from drinking tea with 'em," said
Mr. Pullet, beginning to nurse his knee and shelter it with his pocket-hand-kerchief, as was
his way when the conversation took an interesting turn.

"Very like I did," said Mrs. Pullet, "for you remember when I said things, better than I can
remember myself. He's got a wonderful memory, Pullet has," she continued, looking pathetically
at her sister. "I should be poorly off if he was to have a stroke, for he always remembers
when I've got to take my doctor's stuff; and I'm taking three sorts now."

"There's the 'pills as before' every other night, and the new drops at eleven and four, and
the 'fervescing mixture 'when agreeable,'" rehearsed Mr. Pullet, with a punctuation determined
by a lozenge on his tongue.

"Ah, perhaps it 'ud be better for sister Glegg if she'd go to the doctor sometimes, instead
o' chewing Turkey rhubard whenever there's anything the matter with her," said Mrs. Tulliver,
who naturally saw the wide subject of medicine chiefly in relation to Mrs. Glegg.

"It's dreadful to think on," said aunt Pullet, raising her hands and letting them fall again,
"people playing with their own insides in that way! And it's flying i' the face o' Providence;
for what are the doctors for, if we aren't to call 'em in? And when folks have got the money
to pay for a doctor, it isn't respectable, as I've told Jane many a time. I'm ashamed of acquaintance
knowing it."

"Well, we've no call to be ashamed," said Mr. Pullet, "for Doctor Turnbull hasn't got such
another patient as you i' this parish, now old Mrs. Sutton's gone."

"Pullet keeps all my physic-bottles, did you know, Bessy?" said Mrs. Pullet. "He won't have
one sold. He says it's nothing but right folks should see 'em when I'm gone. They fill two
o' the long store-room shelves a'ready; but," she added, beginning to cry a little, "it's well
if they ever fill three. I may go before I've made up the dozen o' these last sizes. The pill-boxes
are in the closet in my room,--you'll remember that, sister,--but there's nothing to show for
the boluses, if it isn't the bills."

"Don't talk o' your going, sister," said Mrs. Tulliver; "I should have nobody to stand between
me and sister Glegg if you was gone. And there's nobody but you can get her to make it up with
Mr. Tulliver, for sister Deane's never o' my side, and if she was, it's not to be looked for
as she can speak like them as have got an independent fortin."

"Well, your husband is awk'ard, you know, Bessy," said Mrs. Pullet, good-naturedly ready to
use her deep depression on her sister's account as well as her own. "He's never behaved quite
so pretty to our family as he should do, and the children take after him,--the boy's very mischievous,
and runs away from his aunts and uncles, and the gell's rude and brown. It's your bad luck,
and I'm sorry for you, Bessy; for you was allays my favorite sister, and we allays liked the
same patterns."

"I know Tulliver's hasty, and says odd things," said Mrs. Tulliver, wiping away one small tear
from the corner of her eye; "but I'm sure he's never been the man, since he married me, to
object to my making the friends o' my side o' the family welcome to the house."

"I don't want to make the worst of you, Bessy," said Mrs. Pullet, compassionately, "for I doubt
you'll have trouble enough without that; and your husband's got that poor sister and her children
hanging on him,--and so given to lawing, they say. I doubt he'll leave you poorly off when
he dies. Not as I'd have it said out o' the family."

This view of her position was naturally far from cheering to Mrs. Tulliver. Her imagination
was not easily acted on, but she could not help thinking that her case was a hard one, since
it appeared that other people thought it hard.

"I'm sure, sister, I can't help myself," she said, urged by the fear lest her anticipated misfortunes
might be held retributive, to take comprehensive review of her past conduct. "There's no woman
strives more for her children; and I'm sure at scouring-time this Lady-day as I've had all
the bedhangings taken down I did as much as the two gells put together; and there's the last
elder-flower wine I've made--beautiful! I allays offer it along with the sherry, though sister
Glegg will have it I'm so extravagant; and as for liking to have my clothes tidy, and not go
a fright about the house, there's nobody in the parish can say anything against me in respect
o' backbiting and making mischief, for I don't wish anybody any harm; and nobody loses by sending
me a porkpie, for my pies are fit to show with the best o' my neighbors'; and the linen's so
in order as if I was to die to-morrow I shouldn't be ashamed. A woman can do no more nor she can."

"But it's all o' no use, you know, Bessy," said Mrs. Pullet, holding her head on one side,
and fixing her eyes pathetically on her sister, "if your husband makes away with his money.
Not but what if you was sold up, and other folks bought your furniture, it's a comfort to think
as you've kept it well rubbed. And there's the linen, with your maiden mark on, might go all
over the country. It 'ud be a sad pity for our family." Mrs. Pullet shook her head slowly.

"But what can I do, sister?" said Mrs. Tulliver. "Mr. Tulliver's not a man to be dictated to,--not
if I was to go to the parson and get by heart what I should tell my husband for the best. And
I'm sure I don't pretend to know anything about putting out money and all that. I could never
see into men's business as sister Glegg does."

"Well, you're like me in that, Bessy," said Mrs. Pullet; "and I think it 'ud be a deal more
becoming o' Jane if she'd have that pier-glass rubbed oftener,--there was ever so many spots
on it last week,--instead o' dictating to folks as have more comings in than she ever had,
and telling 'em what they're to do with their money. But Jane and me were allays contrairy;
she would have striped things, and I like spots. You like a spot too, Bessy; we allays hung
together i' that."

"Yes, Sophy," said Mrs. Tulliver, "I remember our having a blue ground with a white spot both
alike,--I've got a bit in a bed-quilt now; and if you would but go and see sister Glegg, and
persuade her to make it up with Tulliver, I should take it very kind of you. You was allays
a good sister to me."

"But the right thing 'ud be for Tulliver to go and make it up with her himself, and say he
was sorry for speaking so rash. If he's borrowed money of her, he shouldn't be above that,"
said Mrs. Pullet, whose partiality did not blind her to principles; she did not forget what
was due to people of independent fortune.

"It's no use talking o' that," said poor Mrs. Tulliver, almost peevishly. "If I was to go down
on my bare knees on the gravel to Tulliver, he'd never humble himself."

"Well, you can't expect me to persuade Jane to beg pardon," said Mrs. Pullet. "Her temper's
beyond everything; it's well if it doesn't carry her off her mind, though there never was any
of our family went to a madhouse."

"I'm not thinking of her begging pardon," said Mrs. Tulliver. "But if she'd just take no notice,
and not call her money in; as it's not so much for one sister to ask of another; time 'ud mend
things, and Tulliver 'ud forget all about it, and they'd be friends again."

Mrs. Tulliver, you perceive, was not aware of her husband's irrevocable determination to pay
in the five hundred pounds; at least such a determination exceeded her powers of belief.

"Well, Bessy," said Mrs. Pullet, mournfully, "I don't want to help you on to ruin. I won't
be behindhand i' doing you a good turn, if it is to be done. And I don't like it said among
acquaintance as we've got quarrels in the family. I shall tell Jane that; and I don't mind
driving to Jane's tomorrow, if Pullet doesn't mind. Besides which he considers that his blindness is not from constitution,
but from habit, and is peculiar to himself, because the luminous fire
which kindles the soul in the pupil, was for too long a time and with
too much force, repressed and restrained by a contrary humour, so
that although he might cease from weeping, he cannot be persuaded
that this would result in the longed-for vision.

You will hear what he says to the throng in order that they should enable him to proceed on his
way:

67.

The fifth blind man.

Eyes of mine, with waters ever full, When will the bright spark of the visual ray, Darting, spring
through each veiling obstacle, That I may see again those holy lights That were the alpha of
my darling pain? Ah, woe! I fear me it is quite extinct, So long
oppressed and conquered by its opposite.

Let the blind man pass on!

And turn your eyes upon these founts Which overcome the others one
and all.

Should any dare dispute it with me, There's one would surely answer him again; That in one eye
of mine an ocean is contained.

The sixth blind man is sightless because, through so much weeping, there remains no more moisture,
not even the crystalline and moisture through which, as a diaphanous medium, the visual ray
was transmitted, and the external light and visible species were introduced, so that the heart
became compressed because all the moist substance, whose office it is to keep united the various
parts and opposites, was absorbed, and the amorous affection remains without the effect of tears.
Therefore the organ is destroyed through the victory of the other elements, and it is consequently
left without sight and without consistency of the parts of the body altogether.[AC] He then
proposes to the bystanders that which you shall hear:

68.

The sixth blind man.

Eyes, no longer eyes, fountains no longer founts, Ye have wept out the waters that did keep
The body, soul, and spirit joined in one, And thou, reflecting crystal, which from without
So much unto the soul made manifest, Thou art consumed by the wounded
heart.

So towards the dark and cavernous abyss, I, a blind arid man, direct my steps. Ah, pity me, and
do not hesitate To help my speedy going. I who So many rivers in the dark days spread out,
Finding my only comfort in my tears, Now that my streams and fountains all are dry, Towards profound
oblivion lead the way.

[AC] Water is the first principle of all things; this was the central doctrine of his system (Thales).
Now, if we may believe Aristotle, this thought was suggested to him not so much by contemplating
the illimitable ocean, out of which, as old cosmogonists taught, all things had at first proceeded,
as by noticing the obvious fact, that moisture is found in all living things, and that if it were
absent they would cease to be. Thales, no doubt, believed this humour or moisture to be, as
he said, the essence and principle of all things.--("Encyclopædia Metropolitana.")

The next one avers that he has lost his sight through the intensity of the flame, which, proceeding from
the heart, first destroyed the eyes, and then dried up all the remaining moisture of the substance
of the lover, so that being all melted and turned to flame, he is no longer himself, because the
fire whose property it is to resolve all bodies into their atoms, has converted him into impalpable
dust, whereas by virtue of water alone, the atoms of other bodies
thicken, and are welded together to make a substantial composition.

Yet he is not deprived of the sense of the most intense flame. Therefore, in the sistine he would
have space made for him to pass; for if anybody should be touched by his fires he would become
such that he would have no more feeling of the flames of hell, for their heat would be to him
as cold snow.

69.

The seventh blind man.

Beauty, which through the eyes rushed to the heart, And formed the mighty furnace in my breast,
Absorbing first the visual moisture; then, Spouting aloft its grasping flashing flame, Devouring
every other fluid, To set the dryer element at rest, Has thus reduced me to a boneless dust,
Which now to its own atoms is resolved, If anguish infinite your fears should rouse Make space,
give way, oh peoples! Beware of my fierce penetrating fire, For if it should invade and touch you,
ye Would feel and know the fires of hell To be like winter's cold.

The eighth follows, whose blindness is caused by the dart which love has caused to penetrate
from the eyes to the heart. Hence, he laments not only as being blind, but furthermore because
he is wounded and burnt so fiercely, that he believes no other can be equally so. The sense
of it is easily expressed in this sonnet:--

70.

The eighth blind man.

Vile onslaught, evil struggle, unrighteous palm, Fine point, devouring
fire, strong nerve, Sharp wound, impious ardour, cruel body, Dart,
fire and tangle of that wayward god Who pierced the eyes, inflamed
the heart, bound the soul, Made me at once sightless, a lover, and
a slave, So that, blind I have at all times, in all ways and places,
The feeling of my wound, my fire, my noose.

Men, heroes, and gods! Who be on earth, or near to Ditis or to Jove, I pray ye say, when, how,
and where did ye Feel ever, hear, or see in any place Woes like to these, amongst the oppressed
Amongst the damned, 'mongst lovers?

Finally comes the last one, who is also mute through not having been able, or having dared,
to say that which he most desired to say, for fear of offending or exciting contempt, and he
is deprived of speaking of every other thing: therefore, it is not he who speaks, but his guide
who relates the affair, about which I do not speak, but only bring you the sense thereof:

71.

The guide of the ninth blind man.

Happy are ye, oh all ye sightless lovers, That ye the reason of your pains can tell, By virtue
of your tears you can be sure Of pure and favourable receptions. Amongst you all, the latent fire
of him Whose guide I am, rages most fiercely, Though he is mute for want of boldness To make known
his sorrows to his deity. Make way! open ye wide the way, Be ye benign unto this vacant face,
Oh people full of grievous hindrances, The while this harassed weary trunk Goes knocking at the
doors To meet a death less painful, more profound.

Here are mentioned nine reasons, which are the cause that the human mind is blind as regards the
Divine object and cannot fix its eyes upon it. And of these, the first, allegorized through
the first blind man, is the quality of its own species, which in so far as the degree in which he
finds himself admits, he aspires certainly higher, than he is able to comprehend.

MIN. Because no natural desire is vain, we are able to assure ourselves of a more excellent
state which is suitable to the soul outside of this body, in the which it may be possible
to unite itself, or to approach more nearly, to its object.

SEV. Thou sayest well that no natural impulse or power is without strong reason; it is in fact the
same rule of nature which orders things. So far, it is a thing most true and most certain to well-disposed
intellects, that the human soul, whatever it may show itself while it is in the body, that
same, which it makes manifest in this state, is the expression of its pilgrim existence in
this region; because it aspires to the truth and to universal good, and is not satisfied with
that which comes on account of and to the profit of its species.

The second, represented by the second blind man, proceeds from some troubled affection, as in
the question of Love and Jealousy, the which is like a moth, which has the same subject, enemy
and father, that is, it consumes the cloth or wood from which, it is generated.

MIN. This does not seem to me to take place with heroic love.

SEV. True, according to the same reason which is seen in the lower kind of love; but I mean
according to another reason similar to that which happens to those who love truth and goodness,
which shows itself when they are angry against those who adulterate it, spoil it, or corrupt it, or
who in other ways would treat it with indignity, as has been the case with those who have
brought themselves to suffer death and pains, and to being ignominiously treated by ignorant
peoples and vulgar sects.

MIN. Certainly no one truly loves the truth and the good who is not angry against the multitude;
as no one loves in the ordinary way who is not jealous and fearful about the thing loved.

SEV.
And so he comes to be really blind in many things, and according to the common opinion he is quite
infatuated and mad.

MIN. I have noted a place which says that all those are infatuated and mad, who have sense beyond
and outside of the general sense of other men. But such extravagance is of two kinds, according
as one goes beyond and ascends up higher than the greater number rise or can rise, and these are
they who are inspired with Divine enthusiasm; or by going down lower where those are found who have
greater defect of sense and of reason than the many, and the ordinary; but in that kind of madness,
insensibility and blindness, will not be found the jealous hero.

SEV. Although he is told that much learning makes him mad, yet no one can really abuse him.
The third, represented by the third blind man, proceeds from this: that Divine Truth according
to supernatural reasoning, called metaphysics, manifests itself to
those few to whom it shows itself, and does not proceed with measure
of movement and time as occurs in the physical sciences, that is,
those which are acquired by natural light, the which, in discoursing
of a thing known to reason by means of the senses, proceed to the
knowledge of another thing, unknown, the which discourse is called
argument; but immediately and suddenly, according to the method which
belongs to such efficiency.[AD] Whence a divine has said: "Attenuati
sunt oculi mei suspicientes in excelsum."

[AD] When somewhat of this Perfect Good is discovered and revealed within the soul of man, as it
were in a glance or flash, the soul conceiveth a longing to approach unto the Perfect Goodness.--("Theologia
Germanica.")

MIN. Do you mean then, that the student and the philosopher are not more apt to receive this light
than the ignorant?

SEV. In a certain way no, and in a certain way yes. There is no difference, when the Divine mind
through its providence comes to communicate itself without disposition of the subject; I mean
to say when it communicates itself because it seeks and elects its subject; but there is a great difference,
when it waits and would be sought, and then according to its own good will and pleasure it
makes itself to be found. In this way it does not appear to all, nor can it appear to others,
than to those who seek it. Hence it is said, "Qui quærunt me, invenient me;" and again: "Qui sitit,
veniat et bibat!"

MIN. It is not to be denied, that the apprehension of the second manner is made in Time. (Comes
with time?)

SEV. You do not distinguish between the disposition towards the Divine light and the apprehension
of the same.

The fourth, represented in the following, is not really unworthy, like that which results from the
habit of believing in the false opinions of the vulgar, which are very far removed from the opinions
of philosophers, and are derived from the study of vulgar philosophies, which are by the multitude
considered the more true, the more they appeal to common sense. And this habit is one of the
greatest and strongest disadvantages, because as Alcazele and Averroes showed, it is like that
which happens to those persons who from childhood and youth are in the habit of eating poison,
and have become such, that it is converted into sweet and proper nutriment, and on the other hand,
they abominate those things which are really good and sweet according to common nature; but it is most
worthy, because it is founded upon the habit of looking at the true light; the which habit cannot
come into use for the multitude, as we have said. This blindness is heroic, and is of such
a kind that it can worthily satisfy the present heroic blind man, who is so far from troubling
himself about it that he is able to explain every other sight, and he would crave nothing else from
the community save a free passage and progress in contemplation, for he finds himself usually
hampered and blocked by obstacles and opposition.

The fifth results from the disproportion of the means of our cognition to the knowable; seeing that
in order to contemplate Divine things, the eyes must be opened by means of images, analogies and other
reasonings which by the Peripatetics are comprehended under the name of fancies (fantasmi); or, by means
of Being, to proceed to speculate about Essence, by means of its effects and the knowledge of
the cause; the which means, are so far from ensuring the attainment of such an end, that it
is easier to believe that the highest and most profound cognition of Divine things, is through
negation and not through affirmation, knowing that the Divine beauty and goodness is not that
which can or does fall within our conception, but that which is above
and beyond, incomprehensible; chiefly in that condition called by
the philosopher speculation of phantoms, and by the theologian, vision
through analogies, reflections and enigmas, because we see, not the
true effects and the true species of things, or the substance of ideas,
but the shadows, vestiges and simulacra of them, like those who are
inside the cave and have from their birth their shoulders turned away
from the entrance of the light, and their faces towards the end, where
they do not see that which is in reality, but the shadows of that
which is found substantially outside the cave. Therefore by the open
vision which it has lost, and knows it has lost, a spirit similar
to or better than that of Plato weeps, desiring exit from the cave,
whence, not through reflexion, but through immediate conversion he
may see the light again.

MIN. It appears to me that this blind man
does not refer to the difficulty which proceeds from reflective vision,
but to that which is caused through the medium between the visual
power and the object.

SEV. These two modes, although they are distinct
in the sensitive cognition, or ocular vision, at the same time are
united together in the rational or intellectual cognition.

MIN. It
seems to me that I have heard and read that in every vision, the means,
or the intermediary is required between the power and the object.
Because as by means of the light diffused in the air and the figure
of the thing, which in a certain way proceeds from that which is seen,
to that which sees, the act of seeing is put into effect, so in the
intellectual region, where shines the sun of the intellect, acting
between the intelligible species formed as proceeding from the object,
our intellect comes to comprehend something of the divinity, or something
inferior to it. Because, as our eye, when we see, does not receive
the light of the fire and of gold, in substance, but in similitude;
so the intellect, in whatever state it is found, does not receive
the divinity substantially, so that there should be substantially
as many gods as there are intelligences, but in similitude; therefore
they are not formally gods, but denominatively divine, the divinity
and Divine beauty being one, exalted above all things.

SEV. You say
well; but for all your well saying, there is no need for me to retract,
because I have never said the contrary. But I must declare and explain.
Therefore, first I maintain that the immediate vision, so called and
understood by us, does not do away with that sort of medium which
is the intelligible species, nor that which is the light; but that
which is equal to the thickness and density of the crystalline or
opaque intermediate body; as happens to him who sees by means of the
waters more or less turbid, or air foggy and cloudy, who would believe
he was looking as without a medium when it was conceded to him to
look through the pure air, light and clear.

But let us return. The
sixth, represented in the following, is caused only by the imbecility
and unreality of the body, which is in continual motion, mutation,
and change, the operations of which must follow the condition of its
faculty, the which is a result of the condition of its nature and
being. And Mr. Glegg
was just as fond of saving other people's money as his own; he would have ridden as far round
to avoid a turnpike when his expenses were to be paid for him, as when they were to come out
of his own pocket, and was quite zealous in trying to induce indifferent acquaintances to adopt
a cheap substitute for blacking. This inalienable habit of saving, as an end in itself, belonged
to the industrious men of business of a former generation, who made their fortunes slowly,
almost as the tracking of the fox belongs to the harrier,--it constituted them a "race," which
is nearly lost in these days of rapid money-getting, when lavishness comes close on the back
of want. In old-fashioned times an "independence" was hardly ever made without a little miserliness
as a condition, and you would have found that quality in every provincial district, combined
with characters as various as the fruits from which we can extract acid. The true Harpagons
were always marked and exceptional characters; not so the worthy tax-payers, who, having once
pinched from real necessity, retained even in the midst of their comfortable retirement, with
their wallfruit and wine-bins, the habit of regarding life as an ingenious process of nibbling
out one's livelihood without leaving any perceptible deficit, and who would have been as immediately
prompted to give up a newly taxed luxury when they had had their clear five hundred a year,
as when they had only five hundred pounds of capital. Mr. Glegg was one of these men, found
so impracticable by chancellors of the exchequer; and knowing this, you will be the better
able to understand why he had not swerved from the conviction that he had made an eligible
marriage, in spite of the too-pungent seasoning that nature had given to the eldest Miss Dodson's
virtues. A man with an affectionate disposition, who finds a wife to concur with his fundamental
idea of life, easily comes to persuade himself that no other woman would have suited him so
well, and does a little daily snapping and quarrelling without any sense of alienation. Mr.
Glegg, being of a reflective turn, and no longer occupied with wool, had much wondering meditation
on the peculiar constitution of the female mind as unfolded to him in his domestic life; and
yet he thought Mrs. Glegg's household ways a model for her sex. It struck him as a pitiable
irregularity in other women if they did not roll up their table-napkins with the same tightness
and emphasis as Mrs. Glegg did, if their pastry had a less leathery consistence, and their
damson cheese a less venerable hardness than hers; nay, even the peculiar combination of grocery
and druglike odors in Mrs. Glegg's private cupboard impressed him as the only right thing in
the way of cupboard smells. I am not sure that he would not have longed for the quarrelling
again, if it had ceased for an entire week; and it is certain that an acquiescent, mild wife
would have left his meditations comparatively jejune and barren of mystery.

Mr. Glegg's unmistakable kind-heartedness was shown in this, that it pained him more to see
his wife at variance with others,--even with Dolly, the servant,--than to be in a state of
cavil with her himself; and the quarrel between her and Mr. Tulliver vexed him so much that
it quite nullified the pleasure he would otherwise have had in the state of his early cabbages,
as he walked in his garden before breakfast the next morning. Still, he went in to breakfast
with some slight hope that, now Mrs. Glegg had "slept upon it," her anger might be subdued
enough to give way to her usually strong sense of family decorum. She had been used to boast
that there had never been any of those deadly quarrels among the Dodsons which had disgraced
other families; that no Dodson had ever been "cut off with a shilling," and no cousin of the
Dodsons disowned; as, indeed, why should they be? For they had no cousins who had not money
out at use, or some houses of their own, at the very least.

There was one evening-cloud which had always disappeared from Mrs. Glegg's brow when she sat
at the breakfast-table. It was her fuzzy front of curls; for as she occupied herself in household
matters in the morning it would have been a mere extravagance to put on anything so superfluous
to the making of leathery pastry as a fuzzy curled front. By half-past ten decorum demanded
the front; until then Mrs. Glegg could economize it, and society would never be any the wiser.
But the absence of that cloud only left it more apparent that the cloud of severity remained;
and Mr. Glegg, perceiving this, as he sat down to his milkporridge, which it was his old frugal
habit to stem his morning hunger with, prudently resolved to leave the first remark to Mrs.
Glegg, lest, to so delicate an article as a lady's temper, the slightest touch should do mischief.
People who seem to enjoy their ill temper have a way of keeping it in fine condition by inflicting
privations on themselves. That was Mrs. Glegg's way. She made her tea weaker than usual this
morning, and declined butter. It was a hard case that a vigorous mood for quarrelling, so highly
capable of using an opportunity, should not meet with a single remark from Mr. Glegg on which
to exercise itself. But by and by it appeared that his silence would answer the purpose, for
he heard himself apostrophized at last in that tone peculiar to the wife of one's bosom.

"Well, Mr. Glegg! it's a poor return I get for making you the wife I've made you all these
years. If this is the way I'm to be treated, I'd better ha' known it before my poor father
died, and then, when I'd wanted a home, I should ha' gone elsewhere, as the choice was offered me."

Mr. Glegg paused from his porridge and looked up, not with any new amazement, but simply with
that quiet, habitual wonder with which we regard constant mysteries.

"Why, Mrs. G., what have I done now?"

"Done now, Mr. Glegg? done now?--I'm sorry for you."

Not seeing his way to any pertinent answer, Mr. Glegg reverted to his porridge.

"There's husbands in the world," continued Mrs. Glegg, after a pause, "as 'ud have known how
to do something different to siding with everybody else against their own wives. Perhaps I'm
wrong and you can teach me better. But I've allays heard as it's the husband's place to stand
by the wife, instead o' rejoicing and triumphing when folks insult her."

"Now, what call have you to say that?" said Mr. Glegg, rather warmly, for though a kind man,
he was not as meek as Moses. "When did I rejoice or triumph over you?"

"There's ways o' doing things worse than speaking out plain, Mr. Glegg. I'd sooner you'd tell
me to my face as you make light of me, than try to make out as everybody's in the right but
me, and come to your breakfast in the morning, as I've hardly slept an hour this night, and
sulk at me as if I was the dirt under your feet."

"Sulk at you?" said Mr. Glegg, in a tone of angry facetiousness. "You're like a tipsy man as
thinks everybody's had too much but himself."

"Don't lower yourself with using coarse language to me, Mr. Glegg! It makes you look very small,
though you can't see yourself," said Mrs. Glegg, in a tone of energetic compassion. "A man
in your place should set an example, and talk more sensible."

"Yes; but will you listen to sense?" retorted Mr. Glegg, sharply. "The best sense I can talk
to you is what I said last night,--as you're i' the wrong to think o' calling in your money,
when it's safe enough if you'd let it alone, all because of a bit of a tiff, and I was in hopes
you'd ha' altered your mind this morning. But if you'd like to call it in, don't do it in a
hurry now, and breed more enmity in the family, but wait till there's a pretty mortgage to
be had without any trouble. You'd have to set the lawyer to work now to find an investment,
and make no end o' expense."

Mrs. Glegg felt there was really something in this, but she tossed her head and emitted a guttural
interjection to indicate that her silence was only an armistice, not a peace. And, in fact
hostilities soon broke out again.

"I'll thank you for my cup o' tea, now, Mrs. G.," said Mr. Glegg, seeing that she did not proceed
to give it him as usual, when he had finished his porridge. She lifted the teapot with a slight
toss of the head, and said,--

"I'm glad to hear you'll thank me, Mr. Glegg. It's little thanks I get for what I do for folks
i' this world. Though there's never a woman o' your side o' the family, Mr. Glegg, as is fit
to stand up with me, and I'd say it if I was on my dying bed. Not but what I've allays conducted
myself civil to your kin, and there isn't one of 'em can say the contrary, though my equils
they aren't, and nobody shall make me say it."

"You'd better leave finding fault wi' my kin till you've left off quarrelling with you own,
Mrs. G.," said Mr. Glegg, with angry sarcasm. "I'll trouble you for the milk-jug."

"That's as false a word as ever you spoke, Mr. Glegg," said the lady, pouring out the milk
with unusual profuseness, as much as to say, if he wanted milk he should have it with a vengeance.
"And you know it's false. I'm not the woman to quarrel with my own kin; you may, for I've known
you to do it."

"Why, what did you call it yesterday, then, leaving your sister's house in a tantrum?"

"I'd no quarrel wi' my sister, Mr. Glegg, and it's false to say it. Mr. Tulliver's none o'
my blood, and it was him quarrelled with me, and drove me out o' the house. But perhaps you'd
have had me stay and be swore at, Mr. Glegg; perhaps you was vexed not to hear more abuse and
foul language poured out upo' your own wife. But, let me tell you, it's your disgrace."

"Did ever anybody hear the like i' this parish?" said Mr. Glegg, getting hot. "A woman, with
everything provided for her, and allowed to keep her own money the same as if it was settled
on her, and with a gig new stuffed and lined at no end o' expense, and provided for when I
die beyond anything she could expect--to go on i' this way, biting and snapping like a mad
dog! It's beyond everything, as God A 'mighty should ha' made women so." (These last words
were uttered in a tone of sorrowful agitation. Mr. Glegg pushed his tea from him, and tapped
the table with both his hands.)

"Well, Mr. Glegg, if those are your feelings, it's best they should be known," said Mrs. Glegg,
taking off her napkin, and folding it in an excited manner. "But if you talk o' my being provided
for beyond what I could expect, I beg leave to tell you as I'd a right to expect a many things
as I don't find. And as to my being like a mad dog, it's well if you're not cried shame on
by the county for your treatment of me, for it's what I can't bear, and I won't bear----"

Here Mrs. Glegg's voice intimated that she was going to cry, and breaking off from speech,
she rang the bell violently.

"Sally," she said, rising from her chair, and speaking in rather a choked voice, "light a fire
up-stairs, and put the blinds down. Mr. Glegg, you'll please to order what you'd like for dinner.
I shall have gruel."

Mrs. Glegg walked across the room to the small book-case, and took down Baxter's "Saints' Everlasting
Rest," which she carried with her up-stairs. It was the book she was accustomed to lay open
before her on special occasions,--on wet Sunday mornings, or when she heard of a death in the
family, or when, as in this case, her quarrel with Mr. Glegg had been set an octave higher
than usual.

But Mrs. Glegg carried something else up-stairs with her, which, together with the "Saints'
Rest" and the gruel, may have had some influence in gradually calming her feelings, and making
it possible for her to endure existence on the ground-floor, shortly before tea-time. This
was, partly, Mr. Glegg's suggestion that she would do well to let her five hundred lie still
until a good investment turned up; and, further, his parenthetic hint at his handsome provision
for her in case of his death. Mr. Glegg, like all men of his stamp, was extremely reticent
about his will; and Mrs. Glegg, in her gloomier moments, had forebodings that, like other husbands
of whom she had heard, he might cherish the mean project of heightening her grief at his death
by leaving her poorly off, in which case she was firmly resolved that she would have scarcely
any weeper on her bonnet, and would cry no more than if he had been a second husband. But if
he had really shown her any testamentary tenderness, it would be affecting to think of him,
poor man, when he was gone; and even his foolish fuss about the flowers and garden-stuff, and
his insistence on the subject of snails, would be touching when it was once fairly at an end.
To survive Mr. Glegg, and talk eulogistically of him as a man who might have his weaknesses,
but who had done the right thing by her, not-withstanding his numerous poor relations; to have
sums of interest coming in more frequently, and secrete it in various corners, baffling to
the most ingenious of thieves (for, to Mrs. Glegg's mind, banks and strong-boxes would have
nullified the pleasure of property; she might as well have taken her food in capsules); finally,
to be looked up to by her own family and the neighborhood, so as no woman can ever hope to
be who has not the præterite and present dignity comprised in being a "widow well left,"--all
this made a flattering and conciliatory view of the future. So that when good Mr. Glegg, restored
to good humor by much hoeing, and moved by the sight of his wife's empty chair, with her knitting
rolled up in the corner, went up-stairs to her, and observed that the bell had been tolling
for poor Mr. Morton, Mrs. Glegg answered magnanimously, quite as if she had been an uninjured
woman: "Ah! then, there'll be a good business for somebody to take to."

Baxter had been open at least eight hours by this time, for it was nearly five o'clock; and
if people are to quarrel often, it follows as a corollary that their quarrels cannot be protracted
beyond certain limits.

Mr. and Mrs. Glegg talked quite amicably about the Tullivers that evening. Mr. Glegg went the
length of admitting that Tulliver was a sad man for getting into hot water, and was like enough
to run through his property; and Mrs. Glegg, meeting this acknowledgment half-way, declared
that it was beneath her to take notice of such a man's conduct, and that, for her sister's
sake, she would let him keep the five hundred a while longer, for when she put it out on a
mortgage she should only get four per cent.

Chapter XIII

Mr. Tulliver Further Entangles the Skein of Life

Owing to this new adjustment of Mrs. Glegg's thoughts, Mrs. Pullet found her task of mediation
the next day surprisingly easy. Mrs. Glegg, indeed checked her rather sharply for thinking
it would be necessary to tell her elder sister what was the right mode of behavior in family
matters. Mrs. Pullet's argument, that it would look ill in the neighborhood if people should
have it in their power to say that there was a quarrel in the family, was particularly offensive.
If the family name never suffered except through Mrs. Glegg, Mrs. Pullet might lay her head
on her pillow in perfect confidence.

"It's not to be expected, I suppose," observed Mrs. Glegg, by way of winding up the subject,
"as I shall go to the mill again before Bessy comes to see me, or as I shall go and fall down
o' my knees to Mr. Tulliver, and ask his pardon for showing him favors; but I shall bear no
malice, and when Mr. Tulliver speaks civil to me, I'll speak civil to him. Nobody has any call
to tell me what's becoming."

Finding it unnecessary to plead for the Tullivers, it was natural that aunt Pullet should relax
a little in her anxiety for them, and recur to the annoyance she had suffered yesterday from
the offspring of that apparently ill-fated house. Mrs. Glegg heard a circumstantial narrative,
to which Mr. Pullet's remarkable memory furnished some items; and while aunt Pullet pitied
poor Bessy's bad luck with her children, and expressed a half-formed project of paying for
Maggie's being sent to a distant boarding-school, which would not prevent her being so brown,
but might tend to subdue some other vices in her, aunt Glegg blamed Bessy for her weakness,
and appealed to all witnesses who should be living when the Tulliver children had turned out
ill, that she, Mrs. Glegg, had always said how it would be from the very first, observing that
it was wonderful to herself how all her words came true.

"Then I may call and tell Bessy you'll bear no malice, and everything be as it was before?"
Mrs. Pullet said, just before parting.

"Yes, you may, Sophy," said Mrs. Glegg; "you may tell Mr. Tulliver, and Bessy too, as I'm not
going to behave ill because folks behave ill to me; I know it's my place, as the eldest, to
set an example in every respect, and I do it. Nobody can say different of me, if they'll keep
to the truth."

Mrs. Glegg being in this state of satisfaction in her own lofty magnanimity, I leave you to
judge what effect was produced on her by the reception of a short letter from Mr. Tulliver
that very evening, after Mrs. Pullet's departure, informing her that she needn't trouble her
mind about her five hundred pounds, for it should be paid back to her in the course of the
next month at farthest, together with the interest due thereon until the time of payment. And
furthermore, that Mr. Tulliver had no wish to behave uncivilly to Mrs. Glegg, and she was welcome
to his house whenever she liked to come, but he desired no favors from her, either for himself
or his children.

It was poor Mrs. Tulliver who had hastened this catastrophe, entirely through that irrepressible
hopefulness of hers which led her to expect that similar causes may at any time produce different
results. It had very often occurred in her experience that Mr. Tulliver had done something
because other people had said he was not able to do it, or had pitied him for his supposed
inability, or in any other way piqued his pride; still, she thought to-day, if she told him
when he came in to tea that sister Pullet was gone to try and make everything up with sister
Glegg, so that he needn't think about paying in the money, it would give a cheerful effect
to the meal. Mr. Tulliver had never slackened in his resolve to raise the money, but now he
at once determined to write a letter to Mrs. Glegg, which should cut off all possibility of
mistake. Mrs. Pullet gone to beg and pray for him indeed! Mr. Tulliver did not willingly write
a letter, and found the relation between spoken and written language, briefly known as spelling,
one of the most puzzling things in this puzzling world. Nevertheless, like all fervid writing,
the task was done in less time than usual, and if the spelling differed from Mrs. Glegg's,--why,
she belonged, like himself, to a generation with whom spelling was a matter of private judgment.

Mrs. Glegg did not alter her will in consequence of this letter, and cut off the Tulliver children
from their sixth and seventh share in her thousand pounds; for she had her principles. No one
must be able to say of her when she was dead that she had not divided her money with perfect
fairness among her own kin. In the matter of wills, personal qualities were subordinate to
the great fundamental fact of blood; and to be determined in the distribution of your property
by caprice, and not make your legacies bear a direct ratio to degrees of kinship, was a prospective
disgrace that would have embittered her life. This had always been a principle in the Dodson
family; it was one form if that sense of honor and rectitude which was a proud tradition in
such families,--a tradition which has been the salt of our provincial society.

But though the letter could not shake Mrs. Glegg's principles, it made the family breach much
more difficult to mend; and as to the effect it produced on Mrs. Glegg's opinion of Mr. Tulliver,
she begged to be understood from that time forth that she had nothing whatever to say about
him; his state of mind, apparently, was too corrupt for her to contemplate it for a moment.
It was not until the evening before Tom went to school, at the beginning of August, that Mrs.
Glegg paid a visit to her sister Tulliver, sitting in her gig all the while, and showing her
displeasure by markedly abstaining from all advice and criticism; for, as she observed to her
sister Deane, "Bessy must bear the consequence o' having such a husband, though I'm sorry for
her," and Mrs. Deane agreed that Bessy was pitiable.

That evening Tom observed to Maggie: "Oh my! Maggie, aunt Glegg's beginning to come again;
I'm glad I'm going to school. You'll catch it all now!"

Maggie was already so full of sorrow at the thought of Tom's going away from her, that this
playful exultation of his seemed very unkind, and she cried herself to sleep that night.

Mr. Tulliver's prompt procedure entailed on him further promptitude in finding the convenient
person who was desirous of lending five hundred pounds on bond. "It must be no client of Wakem's,"
he said to himself; and yet at the end of a fortnight it turned out to the contrary; not because
Mr. Tulliver's will was feeble, but because external fact was stronger. Wakem's client was
the only convenient person to be found. Mr. Tulliver had a destiny as well as Œdipus, and in
this case he might plead, like Œdipus, that his deed was inflicted on him rather than committed
by him.

Book II

School-Time

Chapter I

Tom's "First Half"

Tom Tulliver'S sufferings during the first quarter he was at King's Lorton, under the distinguished
care of the Rev. Walter Stelling, were rather severe. At Mr. Jacob's academy life had not presented
itself to him as a difficult problem; there were plenty of fellows to play with, and Tom being
good at all active games,--fighting especially,--had that precedence among them which appeared
to him inseparable from the personality of Tom Tulliver. Mr. Jacobs himself, familiarly known
as Old Goggles, from his habit of wearing spectacles, imposed no painful awe; and if it was
the property of snuffy old hypocrites like him to write like copperplate and surround their
signatures with arabesques, to spell without forethought, and to spout "my name is Norval"
without bungling, Tom, for his part, was glad he was not in danger of those mean accomplishments.
He was not going to be a snuffy schoolmaster, he, but a substantial man, like his father, who
used to go hunting when he was younger, and rode a capital black mare,--as pretty a bit of
horse-flesh as ever you saw; Tom had heard what her points were a hundred times. He meant to
go hunting too, and to be generally respected. When people were grown up, he considered, nobody
inquired about their writing and spelling; when he was a man, he should be master of everything,
and do just as he liked. It had been very difficult for him to reconcile himself to the idea
that his school-time was to be prolonged and that he was not to be brought up to his father's
business, which he had always thought extremely pleasant; for it was nothing but riding about,
giving orders, and going to market; and he thought that a clergyman would give him a great
many Scripture lessons, and probably make him learn the Gospel and Epistle on a Sunday, as
well as the Collect. But in the absence of specific information, it was impossible for him
to imagine that school and a schoolmaster would be something entirely different from the academy
of Mr. Jacobs. So, not to be at a deficiency, in case of his finding genial companions, he
had taken care to carry with him a small box of percussion-caps; not that there was anything
particular to be done with them, but they would serve to impress strange boys with a sense
of his familiarity with guns. Thus poor Tom, though he saw very clearly through Maggie's illusions,
was not without illusions of his own, which were to be cruelly dissipated by his enlarged experience
at King's Lorton.

He had not been there a fortnight before it was evident to him that life, complicated not only
with the Latin grammar but with a new standard of English pronunciation, was a very difficult
business, made all the more obscure by a thick mist of bash fulness. Tom, as you have observed,
was never an exception among boys for ease of address; but the difficulty of enunciating a
monosyllable in reply to Mr. or Mrs. Stelling was so great, that he even dreaded to be asked
at table whether he would have more pudding. As to the percussion-caps, he had almost resolved,
in the bitterness of his heart, that he would throw them into a neighboring pond; for not only
was he the solitary pupil, but he began even to have a certain scepticism about guns, and a
general sense that his theory of life was undermined. For Mr. Stelling thought nothing of guns,
or horses either, apparently; and yet it was impossible for Tom to despise Mr. Stelling as
he had despised Old Goggles. If there were anything that was not thoroughly genuine about Mr.
Stelling, it lay quite beyond Tom's power to detect it; it is only by a wide comparison of
facts that the wisest full-grown man can distinguish well-rolled barrels from mere supernal
thunder.

Mr. Stelling was a well-sized, broad-chested man, not yet thirty, with flaxen hair standing
erect, and large lightish-gray eyes, which were always very wide open; he had a sonorous bass
voice, and an air of defiant self-confidence inclining to brazenness. He had entered on his
career with great vigor, and intended to make a considerable impression on his fellowmen. The
Rev. Walter Stelling was not a man who would remain among the "inferior clergy" all his life.
He had a true British determination to push his way in the world,--as a schoolmaster, in the
first place, for there were capital masterships of grammar-schools to be had, and Mr. Stelling
meant to have one of them; but as a preacher also, for he meant always to preach in a striking
manner, so as to have his congregation swelled by admirers from neighboring parishes, and to
produce a great sensation whenever he took occasional duty for a brother clergyman of minor
gifts. The style of preaching he had chosen was the extemporaneous, which was held little short
of the miraculous in rural parishes like King's Lorton. Some passages of Massillon and Bourdaloue,
which he knew by heart, were really very effective when rolled out in Mr. Stelling's deepest
tones; but as comparatively feeble appeals of his own were delivered in the same loud and impressive
manner, they were often thought quite as striking by his hearers. Mr. Stelling's doctrine was
of no particular school; if anything, it had a tinge of evangelicalism, for that was "the telling
thing" just then in the diocese to which King's Lorton belonged. In short, Mr. Stelling was
a man who meant to rise in his profession, and to rise by merit, clearly, since he had no interest
beyond what might be promised by a problematic relationship to a great lawyer who had not yet
become Lord Chancellor. A clergyman who has such vigorous intentions naturally gets a little
into debt at starting; it is not to be expected that he will live in the meagre style of a
man who means to be a poor curate all his life; and if the few hundreds Mr. Timpson advanced
toward his daughter's fortune did not suffice for the purchase of handsome furniture, together
with a stock of wine, a grand piano, and the laying out of a superior flower-garden, it followed
in the most rigorous manner, either that these things must be procured by some other means,
or else that the Rev. Mr. Stelling must go without them, which last alternative would be an
absurd procrastination of the fruits of success, where success was certain. Mr. Stelling was
so broad-chested and resolute that he felt equal to anything; he would become celebrated by
shaking the consciences of his hearers, and he would by and by edit a Greek play, and invent
several new readings. He had not yet selected the play, for having been married little more
than two years, his leisure time had been much occupied with attentions to Mrs. Stelling; but
he had told that fine woman what he meant to do some day, and she felt great confidence in
her husband, as a man who understood everything of that sort.

But the immediate step to future success was to bring on Tom Tulliver during this first half-year;
for, by a singular coincidence, there had been some negotiation concerning another pupil from
the same neighborhood and it might further a decision in Mr. Stelling's favor, if it were understood
that young Tulliver, who, Mr. Stelling observed in conjugal privacy, was rather a rough cub,
had made prodigious progress in a short time. It was on this ground that he was severe with
Tom about his lessons; he was clearly a boy whose powers would never be developed through the
medium of the Latin grammar, without the application of some sternness. Not that Mr. Stelling
was a harsh-tempered or unkind man; quite the contrary. He was jocose with Tom at table, and
corrected his provincialisms and his deportment in the most playful manner; but poor Tom was
only the more cowed and confused by this double novelty, for he had never been used to jokes
at all like Mr. Stelling's; and for the first time in his life he had a painful sense that
he was all wrong somehow. When Mr. Stelling said, as the roast-beef was being uncovered, "Now,
Tulliver! which would you rather decline, roast-beef or the Latin for it?" Tom, to whom in
his coolest moments a pun would have been a hard nut, was thrown into a state of embarrassed
alarm that made everything dim to him except the feeling that he would rather not have anything
to do with Latin; of course he answered, "Roast-beef," whereupon there followed much laughter
and some practical joking with the plates, from which Tom gathered that he had in some mysterious
way refused beef, and, in fact, made himself appear "a silly." If he could have seen a fellow-pupil
undergo these painful operations and survive them in good spirits, he might sooner have taken
them as a matter of course. But there are two expensive forms of education, either of which
a parent may procure for his son by sending him as solitary pupil to a clergyman: one is the
enjoyment of the reverend gentleman's undivided neglect; the other is the endurance of the
reverend gentleman's undivided attention. It was the latter privilege for which Mr. Tulliver
paid a high price in Tom's initiatory months at King's Lorton.

That respectable miller and maltster had left Tom behind, and driven homeward in a state of
great mental satisfaction. He considered that it was a happy moment for him when he had thought
of asking Riley's advice about a tutor for Tom. Mr. Stelling's eyes were so wide open, and
he talked in such an off-hand, matter-of-fact way, answering every difficult, slow remark of
Mr. Tulliver's with, "I see, my good sir, I see"; "To be sure, to be sure"; "You want your
son to be a man who will make his way in the world,"--that Mr. Tulliver was delighted to find
in him a clergyman whose knowledge was so applicable to the every-day affairs of this life.
Except Counsellor Wylde, whom he had heard at the last sessions, Mr. Tulliver thought the Rev.
Mr Stelling was the shrewdest fellow he had ever met with,--not unlike Wylde, in fact; he had
the same way of sticking his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat. Mr. Tulliver was not
by any means an exception in mistaking brazenness for shrewdness; most laymen thought Stelling
shrewd, and a man of remarkable powers generally; it was chiefly by his clerical brethren that
he was considered rather a full fellow. But he told Mr. Tulliver several stories about "Swing"
and incendiarism, and asked his advice about feeding pigs in so thoroughly secular and judicious
a manner, with so much polished glibness of tongue, that the miller thought, here was the very
thing he wanted for Tom. He had no doubt this first-rate man was acquainted with every branch
of information, and knew exactly what Tom must learn in order to become a match for the lawyers,
which poor Mr. Tulliver himself did not know, and so was necessarily thrown for self-direction
on this wide kind of inference. It is hardly fair to laugh at him, for I have known much more
highly instructed persons than he make inferences quite as wide, and not at all wiser.

As for Mrs. Tulliver, finding that Mrs. Stelling's views as to the airing of linen and the
frequent recurrence of hunger in a growing boy entirely coincided with her own; moreover, that
Mrs. Stelling, though so young a woman, and only anticipating her second confinement, had gone
through very nearly the same experience as herself with regard to the behavior and fundamental
character of the monthly nurse,--she expressed great contentment to her husband, when they
drove away, at leaving Tom with a woman who, in spite of her youth, seemed quite sensible and
motherly, and asked advice as prettily as could be.

"They must be very well off, though," said Mrs. Tulliver, "for everything's as nice as can
be all over the house, and that watered silk she had on cost a pretty penny. Sister Pullet
has got one like it."

"Ah," said Mr. Tulliver, "he's got some income besides the curacy, I reckon. Perhaps her father
allows 'em something. There's Tom 'ull be another hundred to him, and not much trouble either,
by his own account; he says teaching comes natural to him. That's wonderful, now," added Mr.
Tulliver, turning his head on one side, and giving his horse a meditative tickling on the flank.

Perhaps it was because teaching came naturally to Mr. Stelling, that he set about it with that
uniformity of method and independence of circumstances which distinguish the actions of animals
understood to be under the immediate teaching of nature. Mr. Broderip's amiable beaver, as
that charming naturalist tells us, busied himself as earnestly in constructing a dam, in a
room up three pair of stairs in London, as if he had been laying his foundation in a stream
or lake in Upper Canada. It was "Binny's" function to build; the absence of water or of possible
progeny was an accident for which he was not accountable. With the same unerring instinct Mr.
Stelling set to work at his natural method of instilling the Eton Grammar and Euclid into the
mind of Tom Tulliver. This, he considered, was the only basis of solid instruction; all other
means of education were mere charlatanism, and could produce nothing better than smatterers.
Fixed on this firm basis, a man might observe the display of various or special knowledge made
by irregularly educated people with a pitying smile; all that sort of thing was very well,
but it was impossible these people could form sound opinions. In holding this conviction Mr.
Stelling was not biassed, as some tutors have been, by the excessive accuracy or extent of
his own scholarship; and as to his views about Euclid, no opinion could have been freer from
personal partiality. Mr. Stelling was very far from being led astray by enthusiasm, either
religious or intellectual; on the other hand, he had no secret belief that everything was humbug.
He thought religion was a very excellent thing, and Aristotle a great authority, and deaneries
and prebends useful institutions, and Great Britain the providential bulwark of Protestantism,
and faith in the unseen a great support to afflicted minds; he believed in all these things,
as a Swiss hotel-keeper believes in the beauty of the scenery around him, and in the pleasure
it gives to artistic visitors. And in the same way Mr. Stelling believed in his method of education;
he had no doubt that he was doing the very best thing for Mr. Tulliver's boy. Of course, when
the miller talked of "mapping" and "summing" in a vague and diffident manner, Mr Stelling had
set his mind at rest by an assurance that he understood what was wanted; for how was it possible
the good man could form any reasonable judgment about the matter? Mr Stelling's duty was to
teach the lad in the only right way,--indeed he knew no other; he had not wasted his time in
the acquirement of anything abnormal.

He very soon set down poor Tom as a thoroughly stupid lad; for though by hard labor he could
get particular declensions into his brain, anything so abstract as the relation between cases
and terminations could by no means get such a lodgment there as to enable him to recognize
a chance genitive or dative. This struck Mr. Stelling as something more than natural stupidity;
he suspected obstinacy, or at any rate indifference, and lectured Tom severely on his want
of thorough application. "You feel no interest in what you're doing, sir," Mr. Stelling would
say, and the reproach was painfully true. Tom had never found any difficulty in discerning
a pointer from a setter, when once he had been told the distinction, and his perceptive powers
were not at all deficient. I fancy they were quite as strong as those of the Rev. Mr. Stelling;
for Tom could predict with accuracy what number of horses were cantering behind him, he could
throw a stone right into the centre of a given ripple, he could guess to a fraction how many
lengths of his stick it would take to reach across the playground, and could draw almost perfect
squares on his slate without any measurement. But Mr. Stelling took no note of these things;
he only observed that Tom's faculties failed him before the abstractions hideously symbolized
to him in the pages of the Eton Grammar, and that he was in a state bordering on idiocy with
regard to the demonstration that two given triangles must be equal, though he could discern
with great promptitude and certainty the fact that they were equal. Whence Mr. Stelling concluded
that Tom's brain, being peculiarly impervious to etymology and demonstrations, was peculiarly
in need of being ploughed and harrowed by these patent implements; it was his favorite metaphor,
that the classics and geometry constituted that culture of the mind which prepared it for the
reception of any subsequent crop. I say nothing against Mr. Stelling's theory; if we are to
have one regimen for all minds, his seems to me as good as any other. I only know it turned
out as uncomfortably for Tom Tulliver as if he had been plied with cheese in order to remedy
a gastric weakness which prevented him from digesting it. It is astonishing what a different
result one gets by changing the metaphor! Once call the brain an intellectual stomach, and
one's ingenious conception of the classics and geometry as ploughs and harrows seems to settle
nothing. But then it is open to some one else to follow great authorities, and call the mind
a sheet of white paper or a mirror, in which case one's knowledge of the digestive process
becomes quite irrelevant. It was doubtless an ingenious idea to call the camel the ship of
the desert, but it would hardly lead one far in training that useful beast. O Aristotle! if
you had had the advantage of being "the freshest modern" instead of the greatest ancient, would
you not have mingled your praise of metaphorical speech, as a sign of high intelligence, with
a lamentation that intelligence so rarely shows itself in speech without metaphor,--that we
can so seldom declare what a thing is, except by saying it is something else?

Tom Tulliver, being abundant in no form of speech, did not use any metaphor to declare his
views as to the nature of Latin; he never called it an instrument of torture; and it was not
until he had got on some way in the next half-year, and in the Delectus, that he was advanced
enough to call it a "bore" and "beastly stuff." At present, in relation to this demand that
he should learn Latin declensions and conjugations, Tom was in a state of as blank unimaginativeness
concerning the cause and tendency of his sufferings, as if he had been an innocent shrewmouse
imprisoned in the split trunk of an ash-tree in order to cure lameness in cattle. It is doubtless
almost incredible to instructed minds of the present day that a boy of twelve, not belonging
strictly to "the masses," who are now understood to have the monopoly of mental darkness, should
have had no distinct idea how there came to be such a thing as Latin on this earth; yet so
it was with Tom. It would have taken a long while to make conceivable to him that there ever
existed a people who bought and sold sheep and oxen, and transacted the every-day affairs of
life, through the medium of this language; and still longer to make him understand why he should
be called upon to learn it, when its connection with those affairs had become entirely latent.
So far as Tom had gained any acquaintance with the Romans at Mr. Jacob's academy, his knowledge
was strictly correct, but it went no farther than the fact that they were "in the New Testament";
and Mr. Stelling was not the man to enfeeble and emasculate his pupil's mind by simplifying
and explaining, or to reduce the tonic effect of etymology by mixing it with smattering, extraneous
information, such as is given to girls.

Yet, strange to say, under this vigorous treatment Tom became more like a girl than he had
ever been in his life before. He had a large share of pride, which had hitherto found itself
very comfortable in the world, despising Old Goggles, and reposing in the sense of unquestioned
rights; but now this same pride met with nothing but bruises and crushings. Tom was too clear-sighted
not to be aware that Mr. Stelling's standard of things was quite different, was certainly something
higher in the eyes of the world than that of the people he had been living amongst, and that,
brought in contact with it, he, Tom Tulliver, appeared uncouth and stupid; he was by no means
indifferent to this, and his pride got into an uneasy condition which quite nullified his boyish
self-satisfaction, and gave him something of the girl's susceptibility. He was a very firm,
not to say obstinate, disposition, but there was no brute-like rebellion and recklessness in
his nature; the human sensibilities predominated, and if it had occurred to him that he could
enable himself to show some quickness at his lessons, and so acquire Mr. Stelling's approbation,
by standing on one leg for an inconvenient length of time, or rapping his head moderately against
the wall, or any voluntary action of that sort, he would certainly have tried it. But no; Tom
had never heard that these measures would brighten the understanding, or strengthen the verbal
memory; and he was not given to hypothesis and experiment. It did occur to him that he could
perhaps get some help by praying for it; but as the prayers he said every evening were forms
learned by heart, he rather shrank from the novelty and irregularity of introducing an extempore
passage on a topic of petition for which he was not aware of any precedent. But one day, when
he had broken down, for the fifth time, in the supines of the third conjugation, and Mr. Stelling,
convinced that this must be carelessness, since it transcended the bounds of possible stupidity,
had lectured him very seriously, pointing out that if he failed to seize the present golden
opportunity of learning supines, he would have to regret it when he became a man,--Tom, more
miserable than usual, determined to try his sole resource; and that evening, after his usual
form of prayer for his parents and "little sister" (he had begun to pray for Maggie when she
was a baby), and that he might be able always to keep God's commandments, he added, in the
same low whisper, "and please to make me always remember my Latin." He paused a little to consider
how he should pray about Euclid--whether he should ask to see what it meant, or whether there
was any other mental state which would be more applicable to the case. But at last he added:
"And make Mr. Stelling say I sha'n't do Euclid any more. Amen."

The fact that he got through his supines without mistake the next day, encouraged him to persevere
in this appendix to his prayers, and neutralized any scepticism that might have arisen from
Mr. Stelling's continued demand for Euclid. But his faith broke down under the apparent absence
of all help when he got into the irregular verbs. It seemed clear that Tom's despair under
the caprices of the present tense did not constitute a nodus worthy of interference, and since
this was the climax of his difficulties, where was the use of praying for help any longer?
He made up his mind to this conclusion in one of his dull, lonely evenings, which he spent
in the study, preparing his lessons for the morrow. His eyes were apt to get dim over the page,
though he hated crying, and was ashamed of it; he couldn't help thinking with some affection
even of Spouncer, whom he used to fight and quarrel with; he would have felt at home with Spouncer,
and in a condition of superiority. And then the mill, and the river, and Yap pricking up his
ears, ready to obey the least sign when Tom said, "Hoigh!" would all come before him in a sort
of calenture, when his fingers played absently in his pocket with his great knife and his coil
of whipcord, and other relics of the past.

Tom, as I said, had never been so much like a girl in his life before, and at that epoch of
irregular verbs his spirit was further depressed by a new means of mental development which
had been thought of for him out of school hours. Mrs. Stelling had lately had her second baby,
and as nothing could be more salutary for a boy than to feel himself useful, Mrs. Stelling
considered she was doing Tom a service by setting him to watch the little cherub Laura while
the nurse was occupied with the sickly baby. It was quite a pretty employment for Tom to take
little Laura out in the sunniest hour of the autumn day; it would help to make him feel that
Lorton Parsonage was a home for him, and that he was one of the family. The little cherub Laura,
not being an accomplished walker at present, had a ribbon fastened round her waist, by which
Tom held her as if she had been a little dog during the minutes in which she chose to walk;
but as these were rare, he was for the most part carrying this fine child round and round the
garden, within sight of Mrs. Stelling's window, according to orders. If any one considers this
unfair and even oppressive toward Tom, I beg him to consider that there are feminine virtues
which are with difficulty combined, even if they are not incompatible. When the wife of a poor
curate contrives, under all her disadvantages, to dress extremely well, and to have a style
of coiffure which requires that her nurse shall occasionally officiate as lady's-maid; when,
moreover, her dinner-parties and her drawing-room show that effort at elegance and completeness
of appointment to which ordinary women might imagine a large income necessary, it would be
unreasonable to expect of her that she should employ a second nurse, or even act as a nurse
herself. Mr. Stelling knew better; he saw that his wife did wonders already, and was proud
of her. It was certainly not the best thing in the world for young Tulliver's gait to carry
a heavy child, but he had plenty of exercise in long walks with himself, and next half-year
Mr. Stelling would see about having a drilling-master. Among the many means whereby Mr. Stelling
intended to be more fortunate than the bulk of his fellow-men, he had entirely given up that
of having his own way in his own house. What then? He had married "as kind a little soul as
ever breathed," according to Mr. Riley, who had been acquainted with Mrs. Stelling's blond
ringlets and smiling demeanor throughout her maiden life, and on the strength of that knowledge
would have been ready any day to pronounce that whatever domestic differences might arise in
her married life must be entirely Mr. Stelling's fault.

If Tom had had a worse disposition, he would certainly have hated the little cherub Laura,
but he was too kind-hearted a lad for that; there was too much in him of the fibre that turns
to true manliness, and to protecting pity for the weak. I am afraid he hated Mrs. Stelling,
and contracted a lasting dislike to pale blond ringlets and broad plaits, as directly associated
with haughtiness of manner, and a frequent reference to other people's "duty." But he couldn't
help playing with little Laura, and liking to amuse her; he even sacrificed his percussion-caps
for her sake, in despair of their ever serving a greater purpose,--thinking the small flash
and bang would delight her, and thereby drawing down on himself a rebuke from Mrs. Stelling
for teaching her child to play with fire. Laura was a sort of playfellow--and oh, how Tom longed
for playfellows! In his secret heart he yearned to have Maggie with him, and was almost ready
to dote on her exasperating acts of forgetfulness; though, when he was at home, he always represented
it as a great favor on his part to let Maggie trot by his side on his pleasure excursions.

And before this dreary half-year was ended, Maggie actually came. Mrs. Stelling had given a
general invitation for the little girl to come and stay with her brother; so when Mr. Tulliver
drove over to King's Lorton late in October, Maggie came too, with the sense that she was taking
a great journey, and beginning to see the world. It was Mr. Tulliver's first visit to see Tom,
for the lad must learn not to think too much about home.

"Well, my lad," he said to Tom, when Mr. Stelling had left the room to announce the arrival
to his wife, and Maggie had begun to kiss Tom freely, "you look rarely! School agrees with you."

Tom wished he had looked rather ill.

"I don't think I am well, father," said Tom; "I wish you'd ask Mr. Stelling not to let me do
Euclid; it brings on the toothache, I think."

(The toothache was the only malady to which Tom had ever been subject.)

"Euclid, my lad,--why, what's that?" said Mr. Tulliver.

"Oh, I don't know; it's definitions, and axioms, and triangles, and things. It's a book I've
got to learn in--there's no sense in it."

"Go, go!" said Mr. Tulliver, reprovingly; "you mustn't say so. You must learn what your master
tells you. He knows what it's right for you to learn."

"I'll help you now, Tom," said Maggie, with a little air of patronizing consolation. "I'm come
to stay ever so long, if Mrs. Stelling asks me. I've brought my box and my pinafores, haven't
I, father?"

"You help me, you silly little thing!" said Tom, in such high spirits at this announcement
that he quite enjoyed the idea of confounding Maggie by showing her a page of Euclid. "I should
like to see you doing one of my lessons! Why, I learn Latin too! Girls never learn such things.
They're too silly."

"I know what Latin is very well," said Maggie, confidently, "Latin's a language. There are
Latin words in the Dictionary. There's bonus, a gift."

"Now, you're just wrong there, Miss Maggie!" said Tom, secretly astonished. "You think you're
very wise! But 'bonus' means 'good,' as it happens,--bonus, bona, bonum."

"Well, that's no reason why it shouldn't mean 'gift,'" said Maggie, stoutly. "It may mean several
things; almost every word does. There's 'lawn,'--it means the grass-plot, as well as the stuff
pocket- handkerchiefs are made of."

"Well done, little 'un," said Mr. Tulliver, laughing, while Tom felt rather disgusted with
Maggie's knowingness, though beyond measure cheerful at the thought that she was going to stay
with him. Her conceit would soon be overawed by the actual inspection of his books.

Mrs. Stelling, in her pressing invitation, did not mention a longer time than a week for Maggie's
stay; but Mr. Stelling, who took her between his knees, and asked her where she stole her dark
eyes from, insisted that she must stay a fortnight. Maggie thought Mr. Stelling was a charming
man, and Mr. Tulliver was quite proud to leave his little wench where she would have an opportunity
of showing her cleverness to appreciating strangers. So it was agreed that she should not be
fetched home till the end of the fortnight.

"Now, then, come with me into the study, Maggie," said Tom, as their father drove away. "What
do you shake and toss your head now for, you silly?" he continued; for though her hair was
now under a new dispensation, and was brushed smoothly behind her ears, she seemed still in
imagination to be tossing it out of her eyes. "It makes you look as if you were crazy."

"Oh, I can't help it," said Maggie, impatiently. "Don't tease me, Tom. Oh, what books!" she
exclaimed, as she saw the bookcases in the study. "How I should like to have as many books
as that!"

"Why, you couldn't read one of 'em," said Tom, triumphantly. "They're all Latin."

"No, they aren't," said Maggie. "I can read the back of this,--'History of the Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire.'"

"Well, what does that mean? You don't know," said Tom, wagging his head.

"But I could soon find out," said Maggie, scornfully.

"Why, how?"

"I should look inside, and see what it was about."

"You'd better not, Miss Maggie," said Tom, seeing her hand on the volume. "Mr. Stelling lets
nobody touch his books without leave, and I shall catch it, if you take it out."

"Oh, very well. Let me see all your books, then," said Maggie, turning to throw her arms round
Tom's neck, and rub his cheek with her small round nose.

Tom, in the gladness of his heart at having dear old Maggie to dispute with and crow over again,
seized her round the waist, and began to jump with her round the large library table. Away
they jumped with more and more vigor, till Maggie's hair flew from behind her ears, and twirled
about like an animated mop. But the revolutions round the table became more and more irregular
in their sweep, till at last reaching Mr. Stelling's reading stand, they sent it thundering
down with its heavy lexicons to the floor. Happily it was the ground-floor, and the study was
a one-storied wing to the house, so that the downfall made no alarming resonance, though Tom
stood dizzy and aghast for a few minutes, dreading the appearance of Mr. or Mrs. Stelling.

"Oh, I say, Maggie," said Tom at last, lifting up the stand, "we must keep quiet here, you
know. If we break anything Mrs. Stelling'll make us cry peccavi."

"What's that?" said Maggie.

"Oh, it's the Latin for a good scolding," said Tom, not without some pride in his knowledge.

"Is she a cross woman?" said Maggie.

"I believe you!" said Tom, with an emphatic nod.

"I think all women are crosser than men," said Maggie. "Aunt Glegg's a great deal crosser than
uncle Glegg, and mother scolds me more than father does."

"Well, you'll be a woman some day," said Tom, "so you needn't talk."

"But I shall be a clever woman," said Maggie, with a toss.

"Oh, I dare say, and a nasty conceited thing. Everybody'll hate you."

"But you oughtn't to hate me, Tom; it'll be very wicked of you, for I shall be your sister."

"Yes, but if you're a nasty disagreeable thing I shall hate you."

"Oh, but, Tom, you won't! I sha'n't be disagreeable. I shall be very good to you, and I shall
be good to everybody. You won't hate me really, will you, Tom?"

"Oh, bother! never mind! Come, it's time for me to learn my lessons. See here! what I've got
to do," said Tom, drawing Maggie toward him and showing her his theorem, while she pushed her
hair behind her ears, and prepared herself to prove her capability of helping him in Euclid.
She began to read with full confidence in her own powers, but presently, becoming quite bewildered,
her face flushed with irritation. It was unavoidable; she must confess her incompetency, and
she was not fond of humiliation.

"It's nonsense!" she said, "and very ugly stuff; nobody need want to make it out."

"Ah, there, now, Miss Maggie!" said Tom, drawing the book away, and wagging his head at her,
"You see you're not so clever as you thought you were."

"Oh," said Maggie, pouting, "I dare say I could make it out, if I'd learned what goes before,
as you have."

"But that's what you just couldn't, Miss Wisdom," said Tom. "For it's all the harder when you
know what goes before; for then you've got to say what definition 3 is, and what axiom V. is.
But get along with you now; I must go on with this. Here's the Latin Grammar. See what you
can make of that."

Maggie found the Latin Grammar quite soothing after her mathematical mortification; for she
delighted in new words, and quickly found that there was an English Key at the end, which would
make her very wise about Latin, at slight expense. She presently made up her mind to skip the
rules in the Syntax, the examples became so absorbing. These mysterious sentences, snatched
from an unknown context,--like strange horns of beasts, and leaves of unknown plants, brought
from some far-off region,--gave boundless scope to her imagination, and were all the more fascinating
because they were in a peculiar tongue of their own, which she could learn to interpret. It
was really very interesting, the Latin Grammar that Tom had said no girls could learn; and
she was proud because she found it interesting. The most fragmentary examples were her favourites.
Mors omnibus est communis would have been jejune, only she liked to know the Latin; but the
fortunate gentleman whom every one congratulated because he had a son "endowed with such a
disposition" afforded her a great deal of pleasant conjecture, and she was quite lost in the
"thick grove penetrable by no star," when Tom called out,--

"Now, then, Magsie, give us the Grammar!"

"Oh, Tom, it's such a pretty book!" she said, as she jumped out of the large arm-chair to give
it him; "it's much prettier than the Dictionary. I could learn Latin very soon. I don't think
it's at all hard."

"Oh, I know what you've been doing," said Tom; "you've been reading the English at the end.
Any donkey can do that."

Tom seized the book and opened it with a determined and business-like air, as much as to say
that he had a lesson to learn which no donkeys would find themselves equal to. Maggie, rather
piqued, turned to the bookcases to amuse herself with puzzling out the titles.

Presently Tom called to her: "Here, Magsie, come and hear if I can say this. Stand at that
end of the table, where Mr. Stelling sits when he hears me."

Maggie obeyed, and took the open book.

"Where do you begin, Tom?"

"Oh, I begin at 'Appellativa arborum,' because I say all over again what I've been learning
this week."

Tom sailed along pretty well for three lines; and Maggie was beginning to forget her office
of prompter in speculating as to what mas could mean, which came twice over, when he stuck
fast at Sunt etiam volucrum.

"Don't tell me, Maggie; Sunt etiam volucrum--Sunt etiam volucrum--ut ostrea, cetus----"

"No," said Maggie, opening her mouth and shaking her head.

"Sunt etiam volucrum," said Tom, very slowly, as if the next words might be expected to come
sooner when he gave them this strong hint that they were waited for.

"C, e, u," said Maggie, getting impatient.

"Oh, I know--hold your tongue," said Tom. "Ceu passer, hirundo; Ferarum--ferarum----" Tom took
his pencil and made several hard dots with it on his book-cover--"ferarum----"

"Oh dear, oh dear, Tom," said Maggie, "what a time you are! Ut----"

"Ut ostrea----"

"No, no," said Maggie, "ut tigris----"

"Oh yes, now I can do," said Tom; "it was tigris, vulpes, I'd forgotten: ut tigris, volupes;
et Piscium."

With some further stammering and repetition, Tom got through the next few lines.

"Now, then," he said, "the next is what I've just learned for to-morrow. Give me hold of the
book a minute."

After some whispered gabbling, assisted by the beating of his fist on the table, Tom returned
the book.

"Mascula nomina in a," he began.

"No, Tom," said Maggie, "that doesn't come next. It's Nomen non creskens genittivo----"

"Creskens genittivo!" exclaimed Tom, with a derisive laugh, for Tom had learned this omitted
passage for his yesterday's lesson, and a young gentleman does not require an intimate or extensive
acquaintance with Latin before he can feel the pitiable absurdity of a false quantity. "Creskens
genittivo! What a little silly you are, Maggie!"

"Well, you needn't laugh, Tom, for you didn't remember it at all. I'm sure it's spelt so; how
was I to know?"

"Phee-e-e-h! I told you girls couldn't learn Latin. It's Nomen non crescens genitivo."

"Very well, then," said Maggie, pouting. I can say that as well as you can. And you don't mind
your stops. For you ought to stop twice as long at a semicolon as you do at a comma, and you
make the longest stops where there ought to be no stop at all."

"Oh, well, don't chatter. Let me go on."

They were presently fetched to spend the rest of the evening in the drawing-room, and Maggie
became so animated with Mr. Stelling, who, she felt sure, admired her cleverness, that Tom
was rather amazed and alarmed at her audacity. But she was suddenly subdued by Mr. Stelling's
alluding to a little girl of whom he had heard that she once ran away to the gypsies.

"What a very odd little girl that must be!" said Mrs. Stelling, meaning to be playful; but
a playfulness that turned on her supposed oddity was not at all to Maggie's taste. She feared
that Mr. Stelling, after all, did not think much of her, and went to bed in rather low spirits.
Mrs. Stelling, she felt, looked at her as if she thought her hair was very ugly because it
hung down straight behind.

Nevertheless it was a very happy fortnight to Maggie, this visit to Tom. She was allowed to
be in the study while he had his lessons, and in her various readings got very deep into the
examples in the Latin Grammar. The astronomer who hated women generally caused her so much
puzzling speculation that she one day asked Mr. Stelling if all astronomers hated women, or
whether it was only this particular astronomer. But forestalling his answer, she said,--

"I suppose it's all astronomers; because, you know, they live up in high towers, and if the
women came there they might talk and hinder them from looking at the stars."

Mr. Stelling liked her prattle immensely, and they were on the best terms. She told Tom she
should like to go to school to Mr. Stelling, as he did, and learn just the same things. She
knew she could do Euclid, for she had looked into it again, and she saw what A B C meant; they
were the names of the lines.

"I'm sure you couldn't do it, now," said Tom; "and I'll just ask Mr. Stelling if you could."

"I don't mind," said the little conceited minx, "I'll ask him myself."

"Mr. Stelling," she said, that same evening when they were in the drawing-room, "couldn't I
do Euclid, and all Tom's lessons, if you were to teach me instead of him?"

"No, you couldn't," said Tom, indignantly. "Girls can't do Euclid; can they, sir?"

"They can pick up a little of everything, I dare say," said Mr. Stelling. "They've a great
deal of superficial cleverness; but they couldn't go far into anything. They're quick and shallow."

Tom, delighted with this verdict, telegraphed his triumph by wagging his head at Maggie, behind
Mr. Stelling's chair. As for Maggie, she had hardly ever been so mortified. She had been so
proud to be called "quick" all her little life, and now it appeared that this quickness was
the brand of inferiority. It would have been better to be slow, like Tom.

"Ha, ha! Miss Maggie!" said Tom, when they were alone; "you see it's not such a fine thing
to be quick. You'll never go far into anything, you know."

And Maggie was so oppressed by this dreadful destiny that she had no spirit for a retort.

But when this small apparatus of shallow quickness was fetched away in the gig by Luke, and
the study was once more quite lonely for Tom, he missed her grievously. He had really been
brighter, and had got through his lessons better, since she had been there; and she had asked
Mr. Stelling so many questions about the Roman Empire, and whether there really ever was a
man who said, in Latin, "I would not buy it for a farthing or a rotten nut," or whether that
had only been turned into Latin, that Tom had actually come to a dim understanding of the fact
that there had once been people upon the earth who were so fortunate as to know Latin without
learning it through the medium of the Eton Grammar. This luminous idea was a great addition
to his historical acquirements during this half-year, which were otherwise confined to an epitomized
history of the Jews.

But the dreary half-year did come to an end. How glad Tom was to see the last yellow leaves
fluttering before the cold wind! The dark afternoons and the first December snow seemed to
him far livelier than the August sunshine; and that he might make himself the surer about the
flight of the days that were carrying him homeward, he stuck twenty-one sticks deep in a corner
of the garden, when he was three weeks from the holidays, and pulled one up every day with
a great wrench, throwing it to a distance with a vigor of will which would have carried it
to limbo, if it had been in the nature of sticks to travel so far.

But it was worth purchasing, even at the heavy price of the Latin Grammar, the happiness of
seeing the bright light in the parlor at home, as the gig passed noiselessly over the snow-covered
bridge; the happiness of passing from the cold air to the warmth and the kisses and the smiles
of that familiar hearth, where the pattern of the rug and the grate and the fire-irons were
"first ideas" that it was no more possible to criticise than the solidity and extension of
matter. There is no sense of ease like the ease we felt in those scenes where we were born,
where objects became dear to us before we had known the labor of choice, and where the outer
world seemed only an extension of our own personality; we accepted and loved it as we accepted
our own sense of existence and our own limbs. Very commonplace, even ugly, that furniture of
our early home might look if it were put up to auction; an improved taste in upholstery scorns
it; and is not the striving after something better and better in our surroundings the grand
characteristic that distinguishes man from the brute, or, to satisfy a scrupulous accuracy
of definition, that distinguishes the British man from the foreign brute? But heaven knows
where that striving might lead us, if our affections had not a trick of twining round those
old inferior things; if the loves and sanctities of our life had no deep immovable roots in
memory. One's delight in an elderberry bush overhanging the confused leafage of a hedgerow
bank, as a more gladdening sight than the finest cistus or fuchsia spreading itself on the
softest undulating turf, is an entirely unjustifiable preference to a nursery-gardener, or
to any of those regulated minds who are free from the weakness of any attachment that does
not rest on a demonstrable superiority of qualities. And there is no better reason for preferring
this elderberry bush than that it stirs an early memory; that it is no novelty in my life,
speaking to me merely through my present sensibilities to form and color, but the long companion
of my existence, that wove itself into my joys when joys were vivid.

Chapter II

The Christmas Holidays

Fine old Christmas, with the snowy hair and ruddy face, had done his duty that year in the
noblest fashion, and had set off his rich gifts of warmth and color with all the heightening
contrast of frost and snow.

Snow lay on the croft and river-bank in undulations softer than the limbs of infancy; it lay
with the neatliest finished border on every sloping roof, making the dark-red gables stand
out with a new depth of color; it weighed heavily on the laurels and fir-trees, till it fell
from them with a shuddering sound; it clothed the rough turnip-field with whiteness, and made
the sheep look like dark blotches; the gates were all blocked up with the sloping drifts, and
here and there a disregarded four-footed beast stood as if petrified "in unrecumbent sadness";
there was no gleam, no shadow, for the heavens, too, were one still, pale cloud; no sound or
motion in anything but the dark river that flowed and moaned like an unresting sorrow. But
old Christmas smiled as he laid this cruel-seeming spell on the outdoor world, for he meant
to light up home with new brightness, to deepen all the richness of indoor color, and give
a keener edge of delight to the warm fragrance of food; he meant to prepare a sweet imprisonment
that would strengthen the primitive fellowship of kindred, and make the sunshine of familiar
human faces as welcome as the hidden day-star. His kindness fell but hardly on the homeless,--fell
but hardly on the homes where the hearth was not very warm, and where the food had little fragrance;
where the human faces had had no sunshine in them, but rather the leaden, blank-eyed gaze of
unexpectant want. But the fine old season meant well; and if he has not learned the secret
how to bless men impartially, it is because his father Time, with ever-unrelenting unrelenting
purpose, still hides that secret in his own mighty, slow-beating heart.

And yet this Christmas day, in spite of Tom's fresh delight in home, was not, he thought, somehow
or other, quite so happy as it had always been before. The red berries were just as abundant
on the holly, and he and Maggie had dressed all the windows and mantlepieces and picture-frames
on Christmas eve with as much taste as ever, wedding the thick-set scarlet clusters with branches
of the black-berried ivy. There had been singing under the windows after midnight,--supernatural
singing, Maggie always felt, in spite of Tom's contemptuous insistence that the singers were
old Patch, the parish clerk, and the rest of the church choir; she trembled with awe when their
carolling broke in upon her dreams, and the image of men in fustian clothes was always thrust
away by the vision of angels resting on the parted cloud. The midnight chant had helped as
usual to lift the morning above the level of common days; and then there were the smell of
hot toast and ale from the kitchen, at the breakfast hour; the favorite anthem, the green boughs,
and the short sermon gave the appropriate festal character to the church-going; and aunt and
uncle Moss, with all their seven children, were looking like so many reflectors of the bright
parlor-fire, when the church-goers came back, stamping the snow from their feet. The plum-pudding
was of the same handsome roundness as ever, and came in with the symbolic blue flames around
it, as if it had been heroically snatched from the nether fires, into which it had been thrown
by dyspeptic Puritans; the dessert was as splendid as ever, with its golden oranges, brown
nuts, and the crystalline light and dark of apple-jelly and damson cheese; in all these things
Christmas was as it had always been since Tom could remember; it was only distinguished, it
by anything, by superior sliding and snowballs.

Christmas was cheery, but not so Mr. Tulliver. He was irate and defiant; and Tom, though he
espoused his father's quarrels and shared his father's sense of injury, was not without some
of the feeling that oppressed Maggie when Mr. Tulliver got louder and more angry in narration
and assertion with the increased leisure of dessert. The attention that Tom might have concentrated
on his nuts and wine was distracted by a sense that there were rascally enemies in the world,
and that the business of grown-up life could hardly be conducted without a good deal of quarrelling.
Now, Tom was not fond of quarrelling, unless it could soon be put an end to by a fair stand-up
fight with an adversary whom he had every chance of thrashing; and his father's irritable talk
made him uncomfortable, though he never accounted to himself for the feeling, or conceived
the notion that his father was faulty in this respect.

The particular embodiment of the evil principle now exciting Mr. Tulliver's determined resistance
was Mr. Pivart, who, having lands higher up the Ripple, was taking measures for their irrigation,
which either were, or would be, or were bound to be (on the principle that water was water),
an infringement on Mr. Tulliver's legitimate share of water-power. Dix, who had a mill on the
stream, was a feeble auxiliary of Old Harry compared with Pivart. Dix had been brought to his
senses by arbitration, and Wakem's advice had not carried him far. No; Dix, Mr. Tulliver considered,
had been as good as nowhere in point of law; and in the intensity of his indignation against
Pivart, his contempt for a baffled adversary like Dix began to wear the air of a friendly attachment.
He had no male audience to-day except Mr. Moss, who knew nothing, as he said, of the "natur'
o' mills," and could only assent to Mr. Tulliver's arguments on the a priori ground of family
relationship and monetary obligation; but Mr. Tulliver did not talk with the futile intention
of convincing his audience, he talked to relieve himself; while good Mr. Moss made strong efforts
to keep his eyes wide open, in spite of the sleepiness which an unusually good dinner produced
in his hard-worked frame. Mrs. Moss, more alive to the subject, and interested in everything
that affected her brother, listened and put in a word as often as maternal preoccupations allowed.

"Why, Pivart's a new name hereabout, brother, isn't it?" she said; "he didn't own the land
in father's time, nor yours either, before I was married."

"New name? Yes, I should think it is a new name," said Mr. Tulliver, with angry emphasis. "Dorlcote
Mill's been in our family a hundred year and better, and nobody ever heard of a Pivart meddling
with the river, till this fellow came and bought Bincome's farm out of hand, before anybody
else could so much as say 'snap.' But I'll Pivart him!" added Mr. Tulliver, lifting his glass
with a sense that he had defined his resolution in an unmistakable manner.

"You won't be forced to go to law with him, I hope, brother?" said Mrs. Moss, with some anxiety.

"I don't know what I shall be forced to; but I know what I shall force him to, with his dikes
and erigations, if there's any law to be brought to bear o' the right side. I know well enough
who's at the bottom of it; he's got Wakem to back him and egg him on. I know Wakem tells him
the law can't touch him for it, but there's folks can handle the law besides Wakem. It takes
a big raskil to beat him; but there's bigger to be found, as know more o' th' ins and outs
o' the law, else how came Wakem to lose Brumley's suit for him?"

Mr. Tulliver was a strictly honest man, and proud of being honest, but he considered that in
law the ends of justice could only be achieved by employing a stronger knave to frustrate a
weaker. Law was a sort of cock-fight, in which it was the business of injured honesty to get
a game bird with the best pluck and the strongest spurs.

"Gore's no fool; you needn't tell me that," he observed presently, in a pugnacious tone, as
if poor Gritty had been urging that lawyer's capabilities; "but, you see, he isn't up to the
law as Wakem is. And water's a very particular thing; you can't pick it up with a pitchfork.
That's why it's been nuts to Old Harry and the lawyers. It's plain enough what's the rights
and the wrongs of water, if you look at it straight-forrard; for a river's a river, and if
you've got a mill, you must have water to turn it; and it's no use telling me Pivart's erigation
and nonsense won't stop my wheel; I know what belongs to water better than that. Talk to me
o' what th' engineers say! I say it's common sense, as Pivart's dikes must do me an injury.
But if that's their engineering, I'll put Tom to it by-and-by, and he shall see if he can't
find a bit more sense in th' engineering business than what that comes to."

Tom, looking round with some anxiety at this announcement of his prospects, unthinkingly withdrew
a small rattle he was amusing baby Moss with, whereupon she, being a baby that knew her own
mind with remarkable clearness, instantaneously expressed her sentiments in a piercing yell,
and was not to be appeased even by the restoration of the rattle, feeling apparently that the
original wrong of having it taken from her remained in all its force. Mrs. Moss hurried away
with her into another room, and expressed to Mrs. Tulliver, who accompanied her, the conviction
that the dear child had good reasons for crying; implying that if it was supposed to be the
rattle that baby clamored for, she was a misunderstood baby. The thoroughly justifiable yell
being quieted, Mrs. Moss looked at her sister-in-law and said,--

"I'm sorry to see brother so put out about this water work."

"It's your brother's way, Mrs. Moss; I'd never anything o' that sort before I was married,"
said Mrs. Tulliver, with a half-implied reproach. She always spoke of her husband as "your
brother" to Mrs. Moss in any case when his line of conduct was not matter of pure admiration.
Amiable Mrs. Tulliver, who was never angry in her life, had yet her mild share of that spirit
without which she could hardly have been at once a Dodson and a woman. Being always on the
defensive toward her own sisters, it was natural that she should be keenly conscious of her
superiority, even as the weakest Dodson, over a husband's sister, who, besides being poorly
off, and inclined to "hang on" her brother, had the good-natured submissiveness of a large,
easy-tempered, untidy, prolific woman, with affection enough in her not only for her own husband
and abundant children, but for any number of collateral relations.

"I hope and pray he won't go to law," said Mrs. Moss, "for there's never any knowing where
that'll end. And the right doesn't allays win. This Mr. Pivart's a rich man, by what I can
make out, and the rich mostly get things their own way."

"As to that," said Mrs. Tulliver, stroking her dress down, "I've seen what riches are in my
own family; for my sisters have got husbands as can afford to do pretty much what they like.
But I think sometimes I shall be drove off my head with the talk about this law and erigation;
and my sisters lay all the fault to me, for they don't know what it is to marry a man like
your brother; how should they? Sister Pullet has her own way from morning till night."

"Well," said Mrs. Moss, "I don't think I should like my husband if he hadn't got any wits of
his own, and I had to find head-piece for him. It's a deal easier to do what pleases one's
husband, than to be puzzling what else one should do."

"If people come to talk o' doing what pleases their husbands," said Mrs. Tulliver, with a faint
imitation of her sister Glegg, "I'm sure your brother might have waited a long while before
he'd have found a wife that 'ud have let him have his say in everything, as I do. It's nothing
but law and erigation now, from when we first get up in the morning till we go to bed at night;
and I never contradict him; I only say, 'Well, Mr. Tulliver, do as you like; but whativer you
do, don't go to law."

Mrs. Tulliver, as we have seen, was not without influence over her husband. No woman is; she
can always incline him to do either what she wishes, or the reverse; and on the composite impulses
that were threatening to hurry Mr. Tulliver into "law," Mrs. Tulliver's monotonous pleading
had doubtless its share of force; it might even be comparable to that proverbial feather which
has the credit or discredit of breaking the camel's back; though, on a strictly impartial view,
the blame ought rather to lie with the previous weight of feathers which had already placed
the back in such imminent peril that an otherwise innocent feather could not settle on it without
mischief. Not that Mrs. Tulliver's feeble beseeching could have had this feather's weight in
virtue of her single personality; but whenever she departed from entire assent to her husband,
he saw in her the representative of the Dodson family; and it was a guiding principle with
Mr. Tulliver to let the Dodsons know that they were not to domineer over him, or--more specifically--that
a male Tulliver was far more than equal to four female Dodsons, even though one of them was
Mrs. Glegg.

But not even a direct argument from that typical Dodson female herself against his going to
law could have heightened his disposition toward it so much as the mere thought of Wakem, continually
freshened by the sight of the too able attorney on market-days. Wakem, to his certain knowledge,
was (metaphorically speaking) at the bottom of Pivart's irrigation; Wakem had tried to make
Dix stand out, and go to law about the dam; it was unquestionably Wakem who had caused Mr.
Tulliver to lose the suit about the right of road and the bridge that made a thoroughfare of
his land for every vagabond who preferred an opportunity of damaging private property to walking
like an honest man along the highroad; all lawyers were more or less rascals, but Wakem's rascality
was of that peculiarly aggravated kind which placed itself in opposition to that form of right
embodied in Mr. Tulliver's interests and opinions. And as an extra touch of bitterness, the
injured miller had recently, in borrowing the five hundred pounds, been obliged to carry a
little business to Wakem's office on his own account. A hook-nosed glib fellow! as cool as
a cucumber,--always looking so sure of his game! And it was vexatious that Lawyer Gore was
not more like him, but was a bald, round-featured man, with bland manners and fat hands; a
game-cock that you would be rash to bet upon against Wakem. Gore was a sly fellow. His weakness
did not lie on the side of scrupulosity; but the largest amount of winking, however significant,
is not equivalent to seeing through a stone wall; and confident as Mr. Tulliver was in his
principle that water was water, and in the direct inference that Pivart had not a leg to stand
on in this affair of irrigation, he had an uncomfortable suspicion that Wakem had more law
to show against this (rationally) irrefragable inference than Gore could show for it. But then,
if they went to law, there was a chance for Mr. Tulliver to employ Counsellor Wylde on his
side, instead of having that admirable bully against him; and the prospect of seeing a witness
of Wakem's made to perspire and become confounded, as Mr. Tulliver's witness had once been,
was alluring to the love of retributive justice.

Much rumination had Mr. Tulliver on these puzzling subjects during his rides on the gray horse;
much turning of the head from side to side, as the scales dipped alternately; but the probable
result was still out of sight, only to be reached through much hot argument and iteration in
domestic and social life. That initial stage of the dispute which consisted in the narration
of the case and the enforcement of Mr. Tulliver's views concerning it throughout the entire
circle of his connections would necessarily take time; and at the beginning of February, when
Tom was going to school again, there were scarcely any new items to be detected in his father's
statement of the case against Pivart, or any more specific indication of the measures he was
bent on taking against that rash contravener of the principle that water was water. Iteration,
like friction, is likely to generate heat instead of progress, and Mr. Tulliver's heat was
certainly more and more palpable. If there had been no new evidence on any other point, there
had been new evidence that Pivart was as "thick as mud" with Wakem.

"Father," said Tom, one evening near the end of the holidays, "uncle Glegg says Lawyer Wakem
is going to send his son to Mr. Stelling. It isn't true, what they said about his going to
be sent to France. You won't like me to go to school with Wakem's son, shall you?"

"It's no matter for that, my boy," said Mr. Tulliver; "don't you learn anything bad of him,
that's all. The lad's a poor deformed creatur, and takes after his mother in the face; I think
there isn't much of his father in him. It's a sign Wakem thinks high o' Mr. Sterling, as he
sends his son to him, and Wakem knows meal from bran."

Mr. Tulliver in his heart was rather proud of the fact that his son was to have the same advantages
as Wakem's; but Tom was not at all easy on the point. It would have been much clearer if the
lawyer's son had not been deformed, for then Tom would have had the prospect of pitching into
him with all that freedom which is derived from a high moral sanction.

Chapter III

The New Schoolfellow

It was a cold, wet January day on which Tom went back to school; a day quite in keeping with
this severe phase of his destiny. If he had not carried in his pocket a parcel of sugar-candy
and a small Dutch doll for little Laura, there would have been no ray of expected pleasure
to enliven the general gloom. But he liked to think how Laura would put out her lips and her
tiny hands for the bits of sugarcandy; and to give the greater keenness to these pleasures
of imagination, he took out the parcel, made a small hole in the paper, and bit off a crystal
or two, which had so solacing an effect under the confined prospect and damp odors of the gig-umbrella,
that he repeated the process more than once on his way.

"Well, Tulliver, we're glad to see you again," said Mr. Stelling, heartily. "Take off your
wrappings and come into the study till dinner. You'll find a bright fire there, and a new companion."

Tom felt in an uncomfortable flutter as he took off his woollen comforter and other wrappings.
He had seen Philip Wakem at St. Ogg's, but had always turned his eyes away from him as quickly
as possible. He would have disliked having a deformed boy for his companion, even if Philip
had not been the son of a bad man. And Tom did not see how a bad man's son could be very good.
His own father was a good man, and he would readily have fought any one who said the contrary.
He was in a state of mingled embarrassment and defiance as he followed Mr. Stelling to the study.

"Here is a new companion for you to shake hands with, Tulliver," said that gentleman on entering
the study,--"Master Philip Wakem. I shall leave you to make acquaintance by yourselves. You
already know something of each other, I imagine; for you are neighbors at home."

Tom looked confused and awkward, while Philip rose and glanced at him timidly. Tom did not
like to go up and put out his hand, and he was not prepared to say, "How do you do?" on so
short a notice.

Mr. Stelling wisely turned away, and closed the door behind him; boys' shyness only wears off
in the absence of their elders.

Philip was at once too proud and too timid to walk toward Tom. He thought, or rather felt,
that Tom had an aversion to looking at him; every one, almost, disliked looking at him; and
his deformity was more conspicuous when he walked. So they remained without shaking hands or
even speaking, while Tom went to the fire and warmed himself, every now and then casting furtive
glances at Philip, who seemed to be drawing absently first one object and then another on a
piece of paper he had before him. He had seated himself again, and as he drew, was thinking
what he could say to Tom, and trying to overcome his own repugnance to making the first advances.

Tom began to look oftener and longer at Philip's face, for he could see it without noticing
the hump, and it was really not a disagreeable face,--very old-looking, Tom thought. He wondered
how much older Philip was than himself. An anatomist--even a mere physiognomist-- would have
seen that the deformity of Philip's spine was not a congenital hump, but the result of an accident
in infancy; but you do not expect from Tom any acquaintance with such distinctions; to him,
Philip was simply a humpback. He had a vague notion that the deformity of Wakem's son had some
relation to the lawyer's rascality, of which he had so often heard his father talk with hot
emphasis; and he felt, too, a half-admitted fear of him as probably a spiteful fellow, who,
not being able to fight you, had cunning ways of doing you a mischief by the sly. There was
a humpbacked tailor in the neighborhood of Mr. Jacobs's academy, who was considered a very
unamiable character, and was much hooted after by public-spirited boys solely on the ground
of his unsatisfactory moral qualities; so that Tom was not without a basis of fact to go upon.
Still, no face could be more unlike that ugly tailor's than this melancholy boy's face,--the
brown hair round it waved and curled at the ends like a girl's; Tom thought that truly pitiable.
This Wakem was a pale, puny fellow, and it was quite clear he would not be able to play at
anything worth speaking of; but he handled his pencil in an enviable manner, and was apparently
making one thing after another without any trouble. What was he drawing? Tom was quite warm
now, and wanted something new to be going forward. It was certainly more agreeable to have
an ill-natured humpback as a companion than to stand looking out of the study window at the
rain, and kicking his foot against the washboard in solitude; something would happen every
day,-- "a quarrel or something"; and Tom thought he should rather like to show Philip that
he had better not try his spiteful tricks on him. He suddenly walked across the hearth and
looked over Philip's paper.

"Why, that's a donkey with panniers, and a spaniel, and partridges in the corn!" he exclaimed,
his tongue being completely loosed by surprise and admiration. "Oh my buttons! I wish I could
draw like that. I'm to learn drawing this half; I wonder if I shall learn to make dogs and
donkeys!"

"Oh, you can do them without learning," said Philip; "I never learned drawing."

"Never learned?" said Tom, in amazement. "Why, when I make dogs and horses, and those things,
the heads and the legs won't come right; though I can see how they ought to be very well. I
can make houses, and all sorts of chimneys,--chimneys going all down the wall,--and windows
in the roof, and all that. But I dare say I could do dogs and horses if I was to try more,"
he added, reflecting that Philip might falsely suppose that he was going to "knock under,"
if he were too frank about the imperfection of his accomplishments.

"Oh, yes," said Philip, "it's very easy. You've only to look well at things, and draw them
over and over again. What you do wrong once, you can alter the next time."

"But haven't you been taught anything?" said Tom, beginning to have a puzzled suspicion that
Philip's crooked back might be the source of remarkable faculties. "I thought you'd been to
school a long while."

"Yes," said Philip, smiling; "I've been taught Latin and Greek and mathematics, and writing
and such things."

"Oh, but I say, you don't like Latin, though, do you?" said Tom, lowering his voice confidentially.

"Pretty well; I don't care much about it," said Philip.

"Ah, but perhaps you haven't got into the Propria quæ maribus," said Tom, nodding his head
sideways, as much as to say, "that was the test; it was easy talking till you came to that."

Philip felt some bitter complacency in the promising stupidity of this well-made, active-looking
boy; but made polite by his own extreme sensitiveness, as well as by his desire to conciliate,
he checked his inclination to laugh, and said quietly,--

"I've done with the grammar; I don't learn that any more."

"Then you won't have the same lessons as I shall?" said Tom, with a sense of disappointment.

"No; but I dare say I can help you. I shall be very glad to help you if I can."

Tom did not say "Thank you," for he was quite absorbed in the thought that Wakem's son did
not seem so spiteful a fellow as might have been expected.

"I say," he said presently, "do you love your father?"

"Yes," said Philip, coloring deeply; "don't you love yours?"

"Oh yes--I only wanted to know," said Tom, rather ashamed of himself, now he saw Philip coloring
and looking uncomfortable. He found much difficulty in adjusting his attitude of mind toward
the son of Lawyer Wakem, and it had occurred to him that if Philip disliked his father, that
fact might go some way toward clearing up his perplexity.

"Shall you learn drawing now?" he said, by way of changing the subject.

"No," said Philip. "My father wishes me to give all my time to other things now."

"What! Latin and Euclid, and those things?" said Tom.

"Yes," said Philip, who had left off using his pencil, and was resting his head on one hand,
while Tom was learning forward on both elbows, and looking with increasing admiration at the
dog and the donkey.

"And you don't mind that?" said Tom, with strong curiosity.

"No; I like to know what everybody else knows. I can study what I like by-and-by."

"I can't think why anybody should learn Latin," said Tom. "It's no good."

"It's part of the education of a gentleman," said Philip. "All gentlemen learn the same things."

"What! do you think Sir John Crake, the master of the harriers, knows Latin?" said Tom, who
had often thought he should like to resemble Sir John Crake.

"He learned it when he was a boy, of course," said Philip. "But I dare say he's forgotten it."

"Oh, well, I can do that, then," said Tom, not with any epigrammatic intention, but with serious
satisfaction at the idea that, as far as Latin was concerned, there was no hindrance to his
resembling Sir John Crake. "Only you're obliged to remember it while you're at school, else
you've got to learn ever so many lines of 'Speaker.' Mr. Stelling's very particular--did you
know? He'll have you up ten times if you say 'nam' for 'jam,'--he won't let you go a letter
wrong, I can tell you."

"Oh, I don't mind," said Philip, unable to choke a laugh; "I can remember things easily. And
there are some lessons I'm very fond of. I'm very fond of Greek history, and everything about
the Greeks. I should like to have been a Greek and fought the Persians, and then have come
home and have written tragedies, or else have been listened to by everybody for my wisdom,
like Socrates, and have died a grand death." (Philip, you perceive, was not without a wish
to impress the well-made barbarian with a sense of his mental superiority.)

"Why, were the Greeks great fighters?" said Tom, who saw a vista in this direction. "Is there
anything like David and Goliath and Samson in the Greek history? Those are the only bits I
like in the history of the Jews."

"Oh, there are very fine stories of that sort about the Greeks,--about the heroes of early
times who killed the wild beasts, as Samson did. And in the Odyssey--that's a beautiful poem--there's
a more wonderful giant than Goliath,--Polypheme, who had only one eye in the middle of his
forehead; and Ulysses, a little fellow, but very wise and cunning, got a red-hot pine-tree
and stuck it into this one eye, and made him roar like a thousand bulls."

"Oh, what fun!" said Tom, jumping away from the table, and stamping first with one leg and
then the other. "I say, can you tell me all about those stories? Because I sha'n't learn Greek,
you know. Shall I?" he added, pausing in his stamping with a sudden alarm, lest the contrary
might be possible. "Does every gentleman learn Greek? Will Mr. Stelling make me begin with
it, do you think?"

"No, I should think not, very likely not," said Philip. "But you may read those stories without
knowing Greek. I've got them in English."

"Oh, but I don't like reading; I'd sooner have you tell them me. But only the fighting ones,
you know. My sister Maggie is always wanting to tell me stories, but they're stupid things.
Girls' stories always are. Can you tell a good many fighting stories?"

"Oh yes," said Philip; "lots of them, besides the Greek stories. I can tell you about Richard
Cœur-de-Lion and Saladin, and about William Wallace and Robert Bruce and James Douglas,--I
know no end."

"You're older than I am, aren't you?" said Tom.

"Why, how old are you? I'm fifteen."

"I'm only going in fourteen," said Tom. "But I thrashed all the fellows at Jacob's--that's
where I was before I came here. And I beat 'em all at bandy and climbing. And I wish Mr. Stelling
would let us go fishing. I could show you how to fish. You could fish, couldn't you? It's only
standing, and sitting still, you know."

Tom, in his turn, wished to make the balance dip in his favor. This hunchback must not suppose
that his acquaintance with fighting stories put him on a par with an actual fighting hero,
like Tom Tulliver. Philip winced under this allusion to his unfitness for active sports, and
he answered almost peevishly,--

"I can't bear fishing. I think people look like fools sitting watching a line hour after hour,
or else throwing and throwing, and catching nothing."

"Ah, but you wouldn't say they looked like fools when they landed a big pike, I can tell you,"
said Tom, who had never caught anything that was "big" in his life, but whose imagination was
on the stretch with indignant zeal for the honor of sport. Wakem's son, it was plain, had his
disagreeable points, and must be kept in due check. Happily for the harmony of this first interview,
they were now called to dinner, and Philip was not allowed to develop farther his unsound views
on the subject of fishing. But Tom said to himself, that was just what he should have expected
from a hunchback.

Chapter IV

"The Young Idea"

The alterations of feeling in that first dialogue between Tom and Philip continued to make
their intercourse even after many weeks of schoolboy intimacy. Tom never quite lost the feeling
that Philip, being the son of a "rascal," was his natural enemy; never thoroughly overcame
his repulsion to Philip's deformity. He was a boy who adhered tenaciously to impressions once
received; as with all minds in which mere perception predominates over thought and emotion,
the external remained to him rigidly what it was in the first instance. But then it was impossible
not to like Philip's company when he was in a good humor; he could help one so well in one's
Latin exercises, which Tom regarded as a kind of puzzle that could only be found out by a lucky
chance; and he could tell such wonderful fighting stories about Hal of the Wynd, for example,
and other heroes who were especial favorites with Tom, because they laid about them with heavy
strokes. He had small opinion of Saladin, whose cimeter could cut a cushion in two in an instant;
who wanted to cut cushions? That was a stupid story, and he didn't care to hear it again. But
when Robert Bruce, on the black pony, rose in his stirrups, and lifting his good battle-axe,
cracked at once the helmet and the skull of the too hasty knight at Bannockburn, then Tom felt
all the exaltation of sympathy, and if he had had a cocoanut at hand, he would have cracked
it at once with the poker. Philip in his happier moods indulged Tom to the top of his bent,
heightening the crash and bang and fury of every fight with all the artillery of epithets and
similes at his command. But he was not always in a good humor or happy mood. The slight spurt
of peevish susceptibility which had escaped him in their first interview was a symptom of a
perpetually recurring mental ailment, half of it nervous irritability, half of it the heart-bitterness
produced by the sense of his deformity. Equally, to be heard by the Divine, is precisely to listen
to it, and to be favoured by it, is the same as to offer to it; for from the one immoveable
and the same, proceed thoughts uncertain and certain, desires ardent and appeased, and reasonings
valid and vain, according as the man worthily or unworthily puts them before himself, with the
intellect, the affections and actions. As that same pilot may be said to be the cause of the sinking
or of the safety of the ship, according as he is present in it or absent from it; with this difference,
that the pilot through his defectiveness or his efficiency ruins
or saves the ship; but the Divine potency which is all in all does
not proffer or withhold except through assimilation or rejection by
oneself.[H]

[H] Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall
find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.--("St. Matthew.")

VII.

MAR. It seems to me that the following figure is closely connected and linked with the above;
there are two stars in the form of two radiant eyes, with the legend: Mors et vita.

CES. Read the sonnet!

MAR. I will do so:

47.

Writ by the hand of Love may each behold Upon my face the story of my woes. But thou, so that thy
pride no curb may know, And I, unhappy one, eternally might rest, Thou dost torment, by hiding
from my view Those lovely lights beneath the beauteous lids. Therefore the troubled sky's no more
serene, Nor hostile baleful shadows fall away. By thine own beauty, by this love of mine (So
great that e'en with this it may compare), Render thyself, oh Goddess,
unto pity!

Prolong no more this all-unmeasured woe, Ill-timed reward for such a love as this. Let not such
rigour with such splendour mate If it import thee that I live! Open, oh lady, the portals of
thine eyes, And look on me if thou wouldst give me death!

Here, the face upon which the story of his woes appears is the soul; in so far as it is open to receive
those superior gifts, for the which it has a potential aptitude, without the fulness of perfection
and act which waits for the dew of heaven. Thus was it well said: Anima mea sicut terra sine
aqua tibi; and again: Os meum operui; and again: Spiritum, quia mandata tua desiderabam. Then
"pride which knows no curb" is said in metaphor and similitude, as God is sometimes said to be
jealous, angry, or that He sleeps, and that signifies the difficulty with which He grants so
much even as to show his shoulders, which is the making himself known by means of posterior
things and effects. So the lights are covered with the eyelids, the troubled sky of the human
mind does not clear itself by the removal of the metaphors and enigmas. Besides which, because
he does not believe that all which is not, could not be, he prays the divine light, that by its
beauty, which ought not to be entirely concealed, at least according to the capacity of whoever
beholds it, and by his love, which, perchance, is equal to so much beauty (equal, he means,
of the beauty, in so far as he can comprehend it) that it surrender itself to pity, that is, that
it should do as those who are compassionate, and who from being capricious and gloomy become
gracious and affable and that it prolong not the evil which results from that privation, and
not allow that its splendour, for which it is so much desired, should appear greater than that
love by means of which it communicates itself, seeing that in it all the perfections are not
only equal but are also the same. In fine, he begs that it will no further sadden by privation,
for it can kill with the glance of its eyes and can also with those same give him life.

CES. Does he mean that death of lovers, which comes from intense joy, called by the Kabalists,
mors osculi, which same is eternal life, which a man may anticipate in this life and enjoy in eternity?

MAR.
He does.

VIII.

MAR. It is time to proceed to the consideration of the following design, similar to those previously
brought forward, and with which it has a certain affinity. There is an eagle, which with two
wings cleaves the sky; but I do not know how much and in what manner it comes to be retarded
by the weight of a stone which is tied to its leg. There is the legend: Scinditur incertum. It
is certain that it signifies the multitude, number and character
(volgo) of the powers of the soul, to exemplify which, that verse
is taken: Scinditur incertum studia in contraria vulgus.

The whole of which character (volgo) in general is divided into two factions; although subordinate
to these, others are not wanting, of which some appeal to the high intelligence and splendour
of rectitude, while others incite and force in a certain manner to the low, to the uncleanness
of voluptuousness and compliance with natural desires. Therefore says the sonnet:

48.

I would do well--to me 'tis not allowed. With me my sun is not, although I be with him, For
being with him, I'm no more with myself: The farther from myself--the nearer unto him; The
nearer unto him, the farther from myself. Once to enjoy, doth cost me many tears, And seeking
happiness, I meet with woe. For that I look aloft, so blind am I. That I may gain my love, I
lose myself. Through bitter joy, and through sweet pain, Weighted with lead, I rise towards
the sky. Necessity withholds, goodness conducts me on, Fate sinks me down, and counsel raises
me, Desire spurs me, fear keeps me in check. Care kindles and the peril backward draws. Tell
me, what power or what subterfuge Can give me peace and bring me from this strife, If one repels,
the other draws me on.

The ascension goes on in the soul through the power and appulsion in the wings, which are the
intellect, or intellectual will upon which she naturally depends and through which she fixes her gaze
toward God, as to the highest good, and primal truth, as to absolute goodness and beauty.
Thus everything has an impetus towards its beginning retrogressively, and progressively towards
its end and perfection, as Empedocles well said, and from which sentence I think may be inferred
that which the Nolan said in this octave:

The sun must turn and reach his starting-point, Each wandering light must go towards its source,
That which is earth to earth itself reverts, The rivers from the sea to sea return, And thither,
whence desires have life and grow Must they aspire as to revered divinity, So every thought
born of my lady fair Comes back perforce to her, my goddess dear.

The intellectual power is never at rest, it is never satisfied with any comprehended truth,
but ever proceeds on and on towards that truth which is not comprehended. So also the will
which follows the apprehension, we see that it is never satisfied with anything finite. In consequence
of this, the essence of the soul is always referred to the source of its substance and entity.
Then as to the natural powers, by means of which it is turned to the protection and government
of matter, to which it allies itself, and by appulsion benefits and communicates of its perfection
to inferior things, through the likeness which it has to the Divine, which in its benignity
communicates itself or produces infinitely, i.e. imparts existence to the universal infinite and
to the innumerable worlds in it, or, finitely, produces this universe alone, subject to our
eyes and our common reason. Thus then in the one sole essence of the soul are found these
two kinds of powers, and as they are used for one's own good and for the good of others, it follows
that they are depicted with a pair of wings, by means of which it is potent towards the object
of the primal and immaterial potencies, and with a heavy stone, through which it is active and efficacious
towards the objects of the secondary and material potencies.

Whence it follows that the entire affection of the enthusiast is bifold, divided, harassed,
and placed in a position to incline itself more easily downwards than to force itself upwards:
seeing that the soul finds itself in a low and hostile country, and
reaches the far-off region of its more natural home where its powers
are the weakest.

CES. Do you think that this difficulty can be overcome?

MAR. Perfectly well; but the beginning is most difficult, and according as we make more and more
fruitful progress in contemplation we arrive at a greater and greater facility. As happens
to whoever flys up high, the more he rises above the earth the more air he has beneath to
uphold him, and consequently the less he is affected by gravitation; he may even rise so high
that he cannot, without the labour of cleaving the air, return downwards, although one might imagine
it were more easy to cleave the air downwards towards the earth than to rise on high towards the
stars.

CES. So that with progress of this kind a greater and greater facility is acquired for mounting on
high?

MAR. So it is; therefore well said Tansillo:--

"The more I feel the air beneath my feet So much the more towards the wind I bend My swiftest
pinions And spurn the world and up towards Heaven I go."

As every part of bodies and of their elements, the nearer they come to their natural place, the
greater the impetus and force with which they move, until at last, whether they will or not, they
must prevail. That which we see then in the parts of bodies and in the bodies themselves we ought
also to allow of intellectual things towards their proper objects, as their proper places, countries,
and ends. Whence you may easily comprehend the entire significance of the figure, the legend,
and the verses.

CES. So much so that whatsoever you might add thereto would appear to me superfluous.

IX.

CES. Let us see what is here represented by those two radiating arrows upon a target around
which is written: Vicit instans.

MAR. The continual struggle in the soul of the enthusiast, the which,
in consequence of the long familiarity which it had with matter was
hard and incapable of being penetrated by the rays of the splendour
of the Divine intelligence and the species of the Divine goodness;
during which time, he says that the heart was enamelled with diamond,
that is, the affection was hard and not capable of being heated and
penetrated, and it rejected the blows of love which assailed it on
innumerable sides.

That is, it did not feel itself wounded by those wounds of eternal life of which the Psalmist
speaks when he says: Vulnerasti cor meum, o dilecta, vulnerasti cor meum. The which wounds are
not from iron or other material through the vigour and strength of nerves, but are darts of
Diana, or of Phoebus, that is, either from the goddess of the deserts--of
contemplation of truth, that is, from Diana, who is the order of the
second intelligences, which transfer the splendour received from the
first and communicate it to the others, who are deprived of a more
open vision; or else from the principal god Apollo, who with his own,
and not a borrowed splendour, sends his darts, that is, his rays,
so many and from such innumerable points, which are all the species
of things, which are indications of Divine goodness, intelligence,
beauty, and wisdom, according to the various degrees, from the simple
comprehension, to the becoming heroic enthusiasts; because the adamantine
subject does not reflect from its surface the impression of the light,
but, destroyed and overcome by the heat and light, it becomes in substance
luminous--all light--so that it is penetrated within the affection
and conception.

This is not immediately, at the beginning of generation, when the soul comes forth fresh from
the intoxication of Lethe, and drenched with the waves of forgetfulness
and confusion, so that the spirit comes into captivity to the body,
and is put into the condition of growth; but little by little, it
goes on digesting, so as to become fitted for the action of the sensitive
faculty, until, through the rational and discursive faculty, it comes
to a purer intellectual one, so that it can present itself to the
mind, without feeling itself befogged by the exhalations of that humour,
which, through the exercise of contemplation, has been saved from
putrefaction in the stomach and is duly digested.

In this state, the present enthusiast shows himself to have remained thirty years, during which
time he had not reached that purity of conception which would make him a suitable habitation
for the wandering species, which offering themselves to all, equally, knock, ever at the door
of the intelligence.

At last, Love, who in various ways and at different times had assaulted him as it were in vain--as
the light and heat of the sun are said to be useless to those who
are in the opaque depths and bowels of the earth--having located itself
in those sacred lights, that is having shown forth the Divine Beauty
through two intelligible species the which bound his intellect through
the reasoning of Truth and warmed his affections through the reasoning
of Goodness; while the material and sensitive desires became superseded,
which aforetime used, as it were, to triumph, remaining intact, notwithstanding
the excellence of the soul.

Because those lights which made present the illuminating, acting
intellect and sun of intelligence found easy ingress through his eyes;
that of Truth (the intellect of Truth?) through the door of the intellectual
faculty; that of Goodness (intellect of Goodness?) through the door
of the appetitive faculty, to the heart, that is, the substance of
the general affection.

This was that double ray, which came as from the hand of an irate warrior, who showed himself,
now, as ready and as bold, as aforetime he had appeared weak and negligent.[I]

Then, when he first felt warmed and illuminated in his conception, was that victorious point and
moment of which it is said: Vicit instans.

[I] He takes it by assault, without offering battle: the heart is unable to resist him.--("Spiritual
Torrents.")

Thus you can understand the sense of the following figure, legend and sonnet, which says:--

49.

I fought with all my strength, 'gainst Love Divine When he assailed
with blows from every side This cold, enamelled, adamantine heart,
Whence my desires defeated his intent.

At last, one day, 'twas as the heavens had willed. Encamped I found him in those holy lights Which,
through mine own alone, of all the rest An easy entrance to my heart could find. 'Twas then upon
me fell that double bolt, Flung as from hand of irate warrior Who had for thirty years besieged
in vain. He marked that place and strongly there he held, Planted the trophy there, and evermore
He holds my fleet wings in restrainment.

Meanwhile since then with more solemnity of preparation The anger and the ire of my sweet
enemy Cease not to wound my heart.

Rare moment was that; the end of the beginning and perfection of victory; rare were those two
species which amongst all others found easy entrance, seeing that they contain in themselves the
efficacy and the virtue of all the others; for what higher and more excellent form can present
itself than that of the beauty, goodness and truth, which are the source of every other truth,
beauty, and goodness? "He marked that place"--that is, took possession of the affections, noted them,
and impressed upon them his own character; "and strongly there he
held;" he confirmed and established them and sanctified them so that
he can never again lose them; for it is not possible that one should
turn to love any other thing when once he has conceived in his mind
the Divine Beauty, and it is as impossible that he can do other than
love it, as it is impossible that his desires should fall otherwise
than towards good, or species of good.

Therefore his inclination is in the highest degree towards the primal
good. Then turning red, he said, with violent
passion,--

"Get away, you lumbering idiot! Don't come bellowing at me; you're not fit to speak to anything
but a cart-horse!"

It was not the first time Philip had been made angry by him, but Tom had never before been
assailed with verbal missiles that he understood so well.

"I'm fit to speak to something better than you, you poor-spirited imp!" said Tom, lighting
up immediately at Philip's fire. "You know I won't hit you, because you're no better than a
girl. But I'm an honest man's son, and your father's a rogue; everybody says so!"

Tom flung out of the room, and slammed the door after him, made strangely heedless by his anger;
for to slam doors within the hearing of Mrs. Stelling, who was probably not far off, was an
offence only to be wiped out by twenty lines of Virgil. In fact, that lady did presently descend
from her room, in double wonder at the noise and the subsequent cessation of Philip's music.
She found him sitting in a heap on the hassock, and crying bitterly.

"What's the matter, Wakem? what was that noise about? Who slammed the door?"

Philip looked up, and hastily dried his eyes. "It was Tulliver who came in--to ask me to go
out with him."

"And what are you in trouble about?" said Mrs. Stelling.

Philip was not her favorite of the two pupils; he was less obliging than Tom, who was made
useful in many ways. Still, his father paid more than Mr. Tulliver did, and she meant him to
feel that she behaved exceedingly well to him. Philip, however, met her advances toward a good
understanding very much as a caressed mollusk meets an invitation to show himself out of his
shell. Mrs. Stelling was not a loving, tender-hearted woman; she was a woman whose skirt sat
well, who adjusted her waist and patted her curls with a preoccupied air when she inquired
after your welfare. These things, doubtless, represent a great social power, but it is not
the power of love; and no other power could win Philip from his personal reserve.

He said, in answer to her question, "My toothache came on, and made me hysterical again."

This had been the fact once, and Philip was glad of the recollection; it was like an inspiration
to enable him to excuse his crying. He had to accept eau-de-Cologne and to refuse creosote
in consequence; but that was easy.

Meanwhile Tom, who had for the first time sent a poisoned arrow into Philip's heart, had returned
to the carriage-house, where he found Mr. Poulter, with a fixed and earnest eye, wasting the
perfections of his sword-exercise on probably observant but inappreciative rats. But Mr. Poulter
was a host in himself; that is to say, he admired himself more than a whole army of spectators
could have admired him. He took no notice of Tom's return, being too entirely absorbed in the
cut and thrust,--the solemn one, two, three, four; and Tom, not without a slight feeling of
alarm at Mr. Poulter's fixed eye and hungry-looking sword, which seemed impatient for something
else to cut besides the air, admired the performance from as great a distance as possible.
It was not until Mr. Poulter paused and wiped the perspiration from his forehead, that Tom
felt the full charm of the sword-exercise, and wished it to be repeated.

"Mr. Poulter," said Tom, when the sword was being finally sheathed, "I wish you'd lend me your
sword a little while to keep."

"No no, young gentleman," said Mr. Poulter, shaking his head decidedly; "you might do yourself
some mischief with it."

"No, I'm sure I wouldn't; I'm sure I'd take care and not hurt myself. I shouldn't take it out
of the sheath much, but I could ground arms with it, and all that."

"No, no, it won't do, I tell you; it won't do," said Mr. Poulter, preparing to depart. "What
'ud Mr. Stelling say to me?"

"Oh, I say, do, Mr. Poulter! I'd give you my five-shilling piece if you'd let me keep the sword
a week. Look here!" said Tom, reaching out the attractively large round of silver. The young
dog calculated the effect as well as if he had been a philosopher.

"Well," said Mr. Poulter, with still deeper gravity, "you must keep it out of sight, you know."

"Oh yes, I'll keep it under the bed," said Tom, eagerly, "or else at the bottom of my large box."

"And let me see, now, whether you can draw it out of the sheath without hurting yourself."
That process having been gone through more than once, Mr. Poulter felt that he had acted with
scrupulous conscientiousness, and said, "Well, now, Master Tulliver, if I take the crown-piece,
it is to make sure as you'll do no mischief with the sword."

"Oh no, indeed, Mr. Poulter," said Tom, delightedly handing him the crown-piece, and grasping
the sword, which, he thought, might have been lighter with advantage.

"But if Mr. Stelling catches you carrying it in?" said Mr. Poulter, pocketing the crown-piece
provisionally while he raised this new doubt.

"Oh, he always keeps in his upstairs study on Saturday afternoon," said Tom, who disliked anything
sneaking, but was not disinclined to a little stratagem in a worthy cause. So he carried off
the sword in triumph mixed with dread--dread that he might encounter Mr. or Mrs. Stelling--to
his bedroom, where, after some consideration, he hid it in the closet behind some hanging clothes.
That night he fell asleep in the thought that he would astonish Maggie with it when she came,--tie
it round his waist with his red comforter, and make her believe that the sword was his own,
and that he was going to be a soldier. There was nobody but Maggie who would be silly enough
to believe him, or whom he dared allow to know he had a sword; and Maggie was really coming
next week to see Tom, before she went to a boarding-school with Lucy.

If you think a lad of thirteen would have been so childish, you must be an exceptionally wise
man, who, although you are devoted to a civil calling, requiring you to look bland rather than
formidable, yet never, since you had a beard, threw yourself into a martial attitude, and frowned
before the looking-glass. It is doubtful whether our soldiers would be maintained if there
were not pacific people at home who like to fancy themselves soldiers. War, like other dramatic
spectacles, might possibly cease for want of a "public."

Chapter V

Maggie's Second Visit

This last breach between the two lads was not readily mended, and for some time they spoke
to each other no more than was necessary. Their natural antipathy of temperament made resentment
an easy passage to hatred, and in Philip the transition seemed to have begun; there was no
malignity in his disposition, but there was a susceptibility that made him peculiarly liable
to a strong sense of repulsion. The ox--we may venture to assert it on the authority of a great
classic--is not given to use his teeth as an instrument of attack, and Tom was an excellent
bovine lad, who ran at questionable objects in a truly ingenious bovine manner; but he had
blundered on Philip's tenderest point, and had caused him as much acute pain as if he had studied
the means with the nicest precision and the most envenomed spite. Tom saw no reason why they
should not make up this quarrel as they had done many others, by behaving as if nothing had
happened; for though he had never before said to Philip that his father was a rogue, this idea
had so habitually made part of his feeling as to the relation between himself and his dubious
schoolfellow, who he could neither like nor dislike, that the mere utterance did not make such
an epoch to him as it did to Philip. And he had a right to say so when Philip hectored over
him, and called him names. But perceiving that his first advances toward amity were not met,
he relapsed into his least favorable disposition toward Philip, and resolved never to appeal
to him either about drawing or exercise again. They were only so far civil to each other as
was necessary to prevent their state of feud from being observed by Mr. Stelling, who would
have "put down" such nonsense with great vigor.

When Maggie came, however, she could not help looking with growing interest at the new schoolfellow,
although he was the son of that wicked Lawyer Wakem, who made her father so angry. She had
arrived in the middle of school-hours, and had sat by while Philip went through his lessons
with Mr. Stelling. Tom, some weeks ago, had sent her word that Philip knew no end of stories,--not
stupid stories like hers; and she was convinced now from her own observation that he must be
very clever; she hoped he would think her rather clever too, when she came to talk to him.
Maggie, moreover, had rather a tenderness for deformed things; she preferred the wry-necked
lambs, because it seemed to her that the lambs which were quite strong and well made wouldn't
mind so much about being petted; and she was especially fond of petting objects that would
think it very delightful to be petted by her. She loved Tom very dearly, but she often wished
that he cared more about her loving him.

"I think Philip Wakem seems a nice boy, Tom," she said, when they went out of the study together
into the garden, to pass the interval before dinner. "He couldn't choose his father, you know;
and I've read of very bad men who had good sons, as well as good parents who had bad children.
And if Philip is good, I think we ought to be the more sorry for him because his father is
not a good man. You like him, don't you?"

"Oh, he's a queer fellow," said Tom, curtly, "and he's as sulky as can be with me, because
I told him his father was a rogue. And I'd a right to tell him so, for it was true; and he
began it, with calling me names. But you stop here by yourself a bit, Maggie, will you? I've
got something I want to do upstairs."

"Can't I go too?" said Maggie, who in this first day of meeting again loved Tom's shadow.

"No, it's something I'll tell you about by-and-by, not yet," said Tom, skipping away.

In the afternoon the boys were at their books in the study, preparing the morrow's lesson's
that they might have a holiday in the evening in honor of Maggie's arrival. Tom was hanging
over his Latin grammar, moving his lips inaudibly like a strict but impatient Catholic repeating
his tale of paternosters; and Philip, at the other end of the room, was busy with two volumes,
with a look of contented diligence that excited Maggie's curiosity; he did not look at all
as if he were learning a lesson. She sat on a low stool at nearly a right angle with the two
boys, watching first one and then the other; and Philip, looking off his book once toward the
fire-place, caught the pair of questioning dark eyes fixed upon him. He thought this sister
of Tulliver's seemed a nice little thing, quite unlike her brother; he wished he had a little
sister. What was it, he wondered, that made Maggie's dark eyes remind him of the stories about
princesses being turned into animals? I think it was that her eyes were full of unsatisfied
intelligence, and unsatisfied beseeching affection.

"I say, Magsie," said Tom at last, shutting his books and putting them away with the energy
and decision of a perfect master in the art of leaving off, "I've done my lessons now. Come
upstairs with me."

"What is it?" said Maggie, when they were outside the door, a slight suspicion crossing her
mind as she remembered Tom's preliminary visit upstairs. "It isn't a trick you're going to
play me, now?"

"No, no, Maggie," said Tom, in his most coaxing tone; "It's something you'll like ever so."

He put his arm round her neck, and she put hers round his waist, and twined together in this
way, they went upstairs.

"I say, Magsie, you must not tell anybody, you know," said Tom, "else I shall get fifty lines."

"Is it alive?" said Maggie, whose imagination had settled for the moment on the idea that Tom
kept a ferret clandestinely.

"Oh, I sha'n't tell you," said he. "Now you go into that corner and hide your face, while I
reach it out," he added, as he locked the bedroom door behind them. I'll tell you when to turn
round. You mustn't squeal out, you know."

"Oh, but if you frighten me, I shall," said Maggie, beginning to look rather serious.

"You won't be frightened, you silly thing," said Tom. "Go and hide your face, and mind you
don't peep."

"Of course I sha'n't peep," said Maggie, disdainfully; and she buried her face in the pillow
like a person of strict honor.

But Tom looked round warily as he walked to the closet; then he stepped into the narrow space,
and almost closed the door. Maggie kept her face buried without the aid of principle, for in
that dream-suggestive attitude she had soon forgotten where she was, and her thoughts were
busy with the poor deformed boy, who was so clever, when Tom called out, "Now then, Magsie!"

Nothing but long meditation and preconcerted arrangement of effects would have enabled Tom
to present so striking a figure as he did to Maggie when she looked up. Dissatisfied with the
pacific aspect of a face which had no more than the faintest hint of flaxen eyebrow, together
with a pair of amiable blue-gray eyes and round pink cheeks that refused to look formidable,
let him frown as he would before the looking-glass (Philip had once told him of a man who had
a horseshoe frown, and Tom had tried with all his frowning might to make a horseshoe on his
forehead), he had had recourse to that unfailing source of the terrible, burnt cork, and had
made himself a pair of black eyebrows that met in a satisfactory manner over his nose, and
were matched by a less carefully adjusted blackness about the chin. He had wound a red handkerchief
round his cloth cap to give it the air of a turban, and his red comforter across his breast
as a scarf,--an amount of red which, with the tremendous frown on his brow, and the decision
with which he grasped the sword, as he held it with its point resting on the ground, would
suffice to convey an approximate idea of his fierce and bloodthirsty disposition.

Maggie looked bewildered for a moment, and Tom enjoyed that moment keenly; but in the next
she laughed, clapped her hands together, and said, "Oh, Tom, you've made yourself like Bluebeard
at the show."

It was clear she had not been struck with the presence of the sword,--it was not unsheathed.
Her frivolous mind required a more direct appeal to its sense of the terrible, and Tom prepared
for his master-stroke. Frowning with a double amount of intention, if not of corrugation, he
(carefully) drew the sword from its sheath, and pointed it at Maggie.

"Oh, Tom, please don't!" exclaimed Maggie, in a tone of suppressed dread, shrinking away from
him into the opposite corner. "I shall scream--I'm sure I shall! Oh, don't I wish I'd never
come upstairs!"

The corners of Tom's mouth showed an inclination to a smile of complacency that was immediately
checked as inconsistent with the severity of a great warrior. Slowly he let down the scabbard
on the floor, lest it should make too much noise, and then said sternly,--

"I'm the Duke of Wellington! March!" stamping forward with the right leg a little bent, and
the sword still pointing toward Maggie, who, trembling, and with tear-filled eyes, got upon
the bed, as the only means of widening the space between them.

Tom, happy in this spectator of his military performances, even though the spectator was only
Maggie, proceeded, with the utmost exertion of his force, to such an exhibition of the cut
and thrust as would necessarily be expected of the Duke of Wellington.

"Tom, I will not bear it, I will scream," said Maggie, at the first movement of the sword.
"You'll hurt yourself; you'll cut your head off!"

"One--two," said Tom, resolutely, though at "two" his wrist trembled a little. "Three" came
more slowly, and with it the sword swung downward, and Maggie gave a loud shriek. The sword
had fallen, with its edge on Tom's foot, and in a moment after he had fallen too. Maggie leaped
from the bed, still shrieking, and immediately there was a rush of footsteps toward the room.
Mr. Stelling, from his upstairs study, was the first to enter. He found both the children on
the floor. Tom had fainted, and Maggie was shaking him by the collar of his jacket, screaming,
with wild eyes. She thought he was dead, poor child! and yet she shook him, as if that would
bring him back to life. In another minute she was sobbing with joy because Tom opened his eyes.
She couldn't sorrow yet that he had hurt his foot; it seemed as if all happiness lay in his
being alive.

Chapter VI

A Love-Scene

Poor Tom bore his severe pain heroically, and was resolute in not "telling" of Mr. Poulter
more than was unavoidable; the five-shilling piece remained a secret even to Maggie. But there
was a terrible dread weighing on his mind, so terrible that he dared not even ask the question
which might bring the fatal "yes"; he dared not ask the surgeon or Mr. Stelling, "Shall I be
lame, Sir?" He mastered himself so as not to cry out at the pain; but when his foot had been
dressed, and he was left alone with Maggie seated by his bedside, the children sobbed together,
with their heads laid on the same pillow. Tom was thinking of himself walking about on crutches,
like the wheelwright's son; and Maggie, who did not guess what was in his mind, sobbed for
company. It had not occurred to the surgeon or to Mr. Stelling to anticipate this dread in
Tom's mind, and to reassure him by hopeful words. But Philip watched the surgeon out of the
house, and waylaid Mr. Stelling to ask the very question that Tom had not dared to ask for himself.

"I beg your pardon, sir,--but does Mr. Askern say Tulliver will be lame?"

"Oh, no; oh, no," said Mr. Stelling, "not permanently; only for a little while."

"Did he tell Tulliver so, sir, do you think?"

"No; nothing was said to him on the subject."

"Then may I go and tell him, sir?"

"Yes, to be sure; now you mention it, I dare say he may be troubling about that. Go to his
bedroom, but be very quiet at present."

It had been Philip's first thought when he heard of the accident,--"Will Tulliver be lame?
It will be very hard for him if he is"; and Tom's hitherto unforgiven offences were washed
out by that pity. Philip felt that they were no longer in a state of repulsion, but were being
drawn into a common current of suffering and sad privation. His imagination did not dwell on
the outward calamity and its future effect on Tom's life, but it made vividly present to him
the probable state of Tom's feeling. Philip had only lived fourteen years, but those years
had, most of them, been steeped in the sense of a lot irremediably hard.

"Mr. Askern says you'll soon be all right again, Tulliver, did you know?" he said rather timidly,
as he stepped gently up to Tom's bed. "I've just been to ask Mr. Stelling, and he says you'll
walk as well as ever again by-and-day."

Tom looked up with that momentary stopping of the breath which comes with a sudden joy; then
he gave a long sigh, and turned his blue-gray eyes straight on Philip's face, as he had not
done for a fortnight or more. As for Maggie, this intimation of a possibility she had not thought
of before affected her as a new trouble; the bare idea of Tom's being always lame overpowered
the assurance that such a misfortune was not likely to befall him, and she clung to him and
cried afresh.

"Don't be a little silly, Magsie," said Tom, tenderly, feeling very brave now. "I shall soon
get well."

"Good-by, Tulliver," said Philip, putting out his small, delicate hand, which Tom clasped immediately
with his more substantial fingers.

"I say," said Tom, "ask Mr. Stelling to let you come and sit with me sometimes, till I get
up again, Wakem; and tell me about Robert Bruce, you know."

After that, Philip spent all his time out of school-hours with Tom and Maggie. Tom liked to
hear fighting stories as much as ever, but he insisted strongly on the fact that those great
fighters who did so many wonderful things and came off unhurt, wore excellent armor from head
to foot, which made fighting easy work, he considered. He should not have hurt his foot if
he had had an iron shoe on. He listened with great interest to a new story of Philip's about
a man who had a very bad wound in his foot, and cried out so dreadfully with the pain that
his friends could bear with him no longer, but put him ashore on a desert island, with nothing
but some wonderful poisoned arrows to kill animals with for food.

"I didn't roar out a bit, you know," Tom said, "and I dare say my foot was as bad as his. It's
cowardly to roar."

But Maggie would have it that when anything hurt you very much, it was quite permissible to
cry out, and it was cruel of people not to bear it. She wanted to know if Philoctetes had a
sister, and why she didn't go with him on the desert island and take care of him.

One day, soon after Philip had told this story, he and Maggie were in the study alone together
while Tom's foot was being dressed. Philip was at his books, and Maggie, after sauntering idly
round the room, not caring to do anything in particular, because she would soon go to Tom again,
went and leaned on the table near Philip to see what he was doing, for they were quite old
friends now, and perfectly at home with each other.

"What are you reading about in Greek?" she said. "It's poetry, I can see that, because the
lines are so short."

"It's about Philoctetes, the lame man I was telling you of yesterday," he answered, resting
his head on his hand, and looking at her as if he were not at all sorry to be interrupted.
Maggie, in her absent way, continued to lean forward, resting on her arms and moving her feet
about, while her dark eyes got more and more fixed and vacant, as if she had quite forgotten
Philip and his book.

"Maggie," said Philip, after a minute or two, still leaning on his elbow and looking at her,
"if you had had a brother like me, do you think you should have loved him as well as Tom?"

Maggie started a little on being roused from her reverie, and said, "What?" Philip repeated
his question.

"Oh, yes, better," she answered immediately. "No, not better; because I don't think I could
love you better than Tom. But I should be so sorry,--so sorry for you."

Philip colored; he had meant to imply, would she love him as well in spite of his deformity,
and yet when she alluded to it so plainly, he winced under her pity. Maggie, young as she was,
felt her mistake. Hitherto she had instinctively behaved as if she were quite unconscious of
Philip's deformity; her own keen sensitiveness and experience under family criticism sufficed
to teach her this as well as if she had been directed by the most finished breeding.

"But you are so very clever, Philip, and you can play and sing," she added quickly. "I wish
you were my brother. I'm very fond of you. And you would stay at home with me when Tom went
out, and you would teach me everything; wouldn't you,--Greek and everything?"

"But you'll go away soon, and go to school, Maggie," said Philip, "and then you'll forget all
about me, and not care for me any more. And then I shall see you when you're grown up, and
you'll hardly take any notice of me."

"Oh, no, I sha'n't forget you, I'm sure," said Maggie, shaking her head very seriously. "I
never forget anything, and I think about everybody when I'm away from them. I think about poor
Yap; he's got a lump in his throat, and Luke says he'll die. Only don't you tell Tom. because
it will vex him so. You never saw Yap; he's a queer little dog,--nobody cares about him but
Tom and me."

"Do you care as much about me as you do about Yap, Maggie?" said Philip, smiling rather sadly.

"Oh, yes, I should think so," said Maggie, laughing.

"I'm very fond of you, Maggie; I shall never forget you," said Philip, "and when I'm very unhappy,
I shall always think of you, and wish I had a sister with dark eyes, just like yours."

"Why do you like my eyes?" said Maggie, well pleased. She had never heard any one but her father
speak of her eyes as if they had merit.

"I don't know," said Philip. "They're not like any other eyes. They seem trying to speak,--trying
to speak kindly. I don't like other people to look at me much, but I like you to look at me,
Maggie."

"Why, I think you're fonder of me than Tom is," said Maggie, rather sorrowfully. Then, wondering
how she could convince Philip that she could like him just as well, although he was crooked,
she said:

"Should you like me to kiss you, as I do Tom? I will, if you like."

"Yes, very much; nobody kisses me."

Maggie put her arm round his neck and kissed him quite earnestly.

"There now," she said, "I shall always remember you, and kiss you when I see you again, if
it's ever so long. But I'll go now, because I think Mr. Askern's done with Tom's foot."

When their father came the second time, Maggie said to him, "Oh, father, Philip Wakem is so
very good to Tom; he is such a clever boy, and I do love him. And you love him too, Tom, don't
you? Say you love him," she added entreatingly.

Tom colored a little as he looked at his father, and said: "I sha'n't be friends with him when
I leave school, father; but we've made it up now, since my foot has been bad, and he's taught
me to play at draughts, and I can beat him."

"Well, well," said Mr. Tulliver, "if he's good to you, try and make him amends, and be good
to him. He's a poor crooked creature, and takes after his dead mother. But don't you be getting
too thick with him; he's got his father's blood in him too. Ay, ay, the gray colt may chance
to kick like his black sire."

The jarring natures of the two boys effected what Mr. Tulliver's admonition alone might have
failed to effect; in spite of Philip's new kindness, and Tom's answering regard in this time
of his trouble, they never became close friends. When Maggie was gone, and when Tom by-and-by
began to walk about as usual, the friendly warmth that had been kindled by pity and gratitude
died out by degrees, and left them in their old relation to each other. Philip was often peevish
and contemptuous; and Tom's more specific and kindly impressions gradually melted into the
old background of suspicion and dislike toward him as a queer fellow, a humpback, and the son
of a rogue. If boys and men are to be welded together in the glow of transient feeling, they
must be made of metal that will mix, else they inevitably fall asunder when the heat dies out.

Chapter VII

The Golden Gates Are Passed

So Tom went on even to the fifth half-year--till he was turned sixteen--at King's Lorton, while
Maggie was growing with a rapidity which her aunts considered highly reprehensible, at Miss
Firniss's boarding-school in the ancient town of Laceham on the Floss, with cousin Lucy for
her companion. In her early letters to Tom she had always sent her love to Philip, and asked
many questions about him, which were answered by brief sentences about Tom's toothache, and
a turf-house which he was helping to build in the garden, with other items of that kind. She
was pained to hear Tom say in the holidays that Philip was as queer as ever again, and often
cross. They were no longer very good friends, she perceived; and when she reminded Tom that
he ought always to love Philip for being so good to him when his foot was bad, he answered:
"Well, it isn't my fault; I don't do anything to him." She hardly ever saw Philip during the
remainder of their school-life; in the Midsummer holidays he was always away at the seaside,
and at Christmas she could only meet him at long intervals in the street of St. Ogg's. When
they did meet, she remembered her promise to kiss him, but, as a young lady who had been at
a boarding-school, she knew now that such a greeting was out of the question, and Philip would
not expect it. The promise was void, like so many other sweet, illusory promises of our childhood;
void as promises made in Eden before the seasons were divided, and when the starry blossoms
grew side by side with the ripening peach,--impossible to be fulfilled when the golden gates
had been passed.

But when their father was actually engaged in the long-threatened lawsuit, and Wakem, as the
agent at once of Pivart and Old Harry, was acting against him, even Maggie felt, with some
sadness, that they were not likely ever to have any intimacy with Philip again; the very name
of Wakem made her father angry, and she had once heard him say that if that crook-backed son
lived to inherit his father's ill-gotten gains, there would be a curse upon him. "Have as little
to do with him at school as you can, my lad," he said to Tom; and the command was obeyed the
more easily because Mr. Sterling by this time had two additional pupils; for though this gentleman's
rise in the world was not of that meteor-like rapidity which the admirers of his extemporaneous
eloquence had expected for a preacher whose voice demanded so wide a sphere, he had yet enough
of growing prosperity to enable him to increase his expenditure in continued disproportion
to his income.

As for Tom's school course, it went on with mill-like monotony, his mind continuing to move
with a slow, half-stifled pulse in a medium uninteresting or unintelligible ideas. But each
vacation he brought home larger and larger drawings with the satiny rendering of landscape,
and water-colors in vivid greens, together with manuscript books full of exercises and problems,
in which the handwriting was all the finer because he gave his whole mind to it. Each vacation
he brought home a new book or two, indicating his progress through different stages of history,
Christian doctrine, and Latin literature; and that passage was not entirely without results,
besides the possession of the books. Tom's ear and tongue had become accustomed to a great
many words and phrases which are understood to be signs of an educated condition; and though
he had never really applied his mind to any one of his lessons, the lessons had left a deposit
of vague, fragmentary, ineffectual notions. Mr. Tulliver, seeing signs of acquirement beyond
the reach of his own criticism, thought it was probably all right with Tom's education; he
observed, indeed, that there were no maps, and not enough "summing"; but he made no formal
complaint to Mr. Stelling. It was a puzzling business, this schooling; and if he took Tom away,
where could he send him with better effect?

By the time Tom had reached his last quarter at King's Lorton, the years had made striking
changes in him since the day we saw him returning from Mr. Jacobs's academy. He was a tall
youth now, carrying himself without the least awkwardness, and speaking without more shyness
than was a becoming symptom of blended diffidence and pride; he wore his tail-coat and his
stand-up collars, and watched the down on his lip with eager impatience, looking every day
at his virgin razor, with which he had provided himself in the last holidays. Philip had already
left,--at the autumn quarter,--that he might go to the south for the winter, for the sake of
his health; and this change helped to give Tom the unsettled, exultant feeling that usually
belongs to the last months before leaving school. This quarter, too, there was some hope of
his father's lawsuit being decided; that made the prospect of home more entirely pleasurable.
For Tom, who had gathered his view of the case from his father's conversation, had no doubt
that Pivart would be beaten.

Tom had not heard anything from home for some weeks,--a fact which did not surprise him, for
his father and mother were not apt to manifest their affection in unnecessary letters,--when,
to his great surprise, on the morning of a dark, cold day near the end of November, he was
told, soon after entering the study at nine o'clock, that his sister was in the drawing-room.
It was Mrs. Stelling who had come into the study to tell him, and she left him to enter the
drawing-room alone.

Maggie, too, was tall now, with braided and coiled hair; she was almost as tall as Tom, though
she was only thirteen; and she really looked older than he did at that moment. She had thrown
off her bonnet, her heavy braids were pushed back from her forehead, as if it would not bear
that extra load, and her young face had a strangely worn look, as her eyes turned anxiously
toward the door. When Tom entered she did not speak, but only went up to him, put her arms
round his neck, and kissed him earnestly. He was used to various moods of hers, and felt no
alarm at the unusual seriousness of her greeting.

"Why, how is it you're come so early this cold morning, Maggie? Did you come in the gig?" said
Tom, as she backed toward the sofa, and drew him to her side.

"No, I came by the coach. I've walked from the turnpike."

"But how is it you're not at school? The holidays have not begun yet?"

"Father wanted me at home," said Maggie, with a slight trembling of the lip. "I came home three
or four days ago."

"Isn't my father well?" said Tom, rather anxiously.

"Not quite," said Maggie. "He's very unhappy, Tom. The lawsuit is ended, and I came to tell
you because I thought it would be better for you to know it before you came home, and I didn't
like only to send you a letter."

"My father hasn't lost?" said Tom, hastily, springing from the sofa, and standing before Maggie
with his hands suddenly thrust into his pockets.

"Yes, dear Tom," said Maggie, looking up at him with trembling.

Tom was silent a minute or two, with his eyes fixed on the floor. Then he said:

"My father will have to pay a good deal of money, then?"

"Yes," said Maggie, rather faintly.

"Well, it can't be helped," said Tom, bravely, not translating the loss of a large sum of money
into any tangible results. "But my father's very much vexed, I dare say?" he added, looking
at Maggie, and thinking that her agitated face was only part of her girlish way of taking things.

"Yes," said Maggie, again faintly. Then, urged to fuller speech by Tom's freedom from apprehension,
she said loudly and rapidly, as if the words would burst from her: "Oh, Tom, he will lose the
mill and the land and everything; he will have nothing left."

Tom's eyes flashed out one look of surprise at her, before he turned pale, and trembled visibly.
He said nothing, but sat down on the sofa again, looking vaguely out of the opposite window.

Anxiety about the future had never entered Tom's mind. His father had always ridden a good
horse, kept a good house, and had the cheerful, confident air of a man who has plenty of property
to fall back upon. Tom had never dreamed that his father would "fail"; that was a form of misfortune
which he had always heard spoken of as a deep disgrace, and disgrace was an idea that he could
not associate with any of his relations, least of all with his father. A proud sense of family
respectability was part of the very air Tom had been born and brought up in. He knew there
were people in St. Ogg's who made a show without money to support it, and he had always heard
such people spoken of by his own friends with contempt and reprobation. He had a strong belief,
which was a lifelong habit, and required no definite evidence to rest on, that his father could
spend a great deal of money if he chose; and since his education at Mr. Stelling's had given
him a more expensive view of life, he had often thought that when he got older he would make
a figure in the world, with his horse and dogs and saddle, and other accoutrements of a fine
young man, and show himself equal to any of his contemporaries at St. Ogg's, who might consider
themselves a grade above him in society because their fathers were professional men, or had
large oil-mills. As to the prognostics and headshaking of his aunts and uncles, they had never
produced the least effect on him, except to make him think that aunts and uncles were disagreeable
society; he had heard them find fault in much the same way as long as he could remember. His
father knew better than they did.

The down had come on Tom's lip, yet his thoughts and expectations had been hitherto only the
reproduction, in changed forms, of the boyish dreams in which he had lived three years ago.
He was awakened now with a violent shock.

Maggie was frightened at Tom's pale, trembling silence. There was something else to tell him,--something
worse. She threw her arms round him at last, and said, with a half sob:

"Oh, Tom--dear, dear Tom, don't fret too much; try and bear it well."

Tom turned his cheek passively to meet her entreating kisses, and there gathered a moisture
in his eyes, which he just rubbed away with his hand. The action seemed to rouse him, for he
shook himself and said: "I shall go home, with you, Maggie. Didn't my father say I was to go?"

"No, Tom, father didn't wish it," said Maggie, her anxiety about his feeling helping her to
master her agitation. What would he do when she told him all? "But mother wants you to come,--poor
mother!--she cries so. Oh, Tom, it's very dreadful at home."

Maggie's lips grew whiter, and she began to tremble almost as Tom had done. The two poor things
clung closer to each other, both trembling,--the one at an unshapen fear, the other at the
image of a terrible certainty. When Maggie spoke, it was hardly above a whisper.

"And--and--poor father----"

Maggie could not utter it. But the suspense was intolerable to Tom. A vague idea of going to
prison, as a consequence of debt, was the shape his fears had begun to take.

"Where's my father?" he said impatiently. "Tell me, Maggie."

"He's at home," said Maggie, finding it easier to reply to that question. "But," she added,
after a pause, "not himself--he fell off his horse. He has known nobody but me ever since--he
seems to have lost his senses. O father, father----"

With these last words, Maggie's sobs burst forth with the more violence for the previous struggle
against them. Tom felt that pressure of the heart which forbids tears; he had no distinct vision
of their troubles as Maggie had, who had been at home; he only felt the crushing weight of
what seemed unmitigated misfortune. He tightened his arm almost convulsively round Maggie as
she sobbed, but his face looked rigid and tearless, his eyes blank,--as if a black curtain
of cloud had suddenly fallen on his path.

But Maggie soon checked herself abruptly; a single thought had acted on her like a startling sound.

"We must set out, Tom, we must not stay. Father will miss me; we must be at the turnpike at
ten to meet the coach." She said this with hasty decision, rubbing her eyes, and rising to
seize her bonnet.

Tom at once felt the same impulse, and rose too. "Wait a minute, Maggie," he said. "I must
speak to Mr. Stelling, and then we'll go."

He thought he must go to the study where the pupils were; but on his way he met Mr. Stelling,
who had heard from his wife that Maggie appeared to be in trouble when she asked for her brother,
and now that he thought the brother and sister had been alone long enough, was coming to inquire
and offer his sympathy.

"Please, sir, I must go home," Tom said abruptly, as he met Mr. Stelling in the passage. "I
must go back with my sister directly. My father's lost his lawsuit--he's lost all his property--and
he's very ill."

Mr. Stelling felt like a kind-hearted man; he foresaw a probable money loss for himself, but
this had no appreciable share in his feeling, while he looked with grave pity at the brother
and sister for whom youth and sorrow had begun together. When he knew how Maggie had come,
and how eager she was to get home again, he hurried their departure, only whispering something
to Mrs. Stelling, who had followed him, and who immediately left the room.

Tom and Maggie were standing on the door-step, ready to set out, when Mrs. Stelling came with
a little basket, which she hung on Maggie's arm, saying: "Do remember to eat something on the
way, dear." Maggie's heart went out toward this woman whom she had never liked, and she kissed
her silently. It was the first sign within the poor child of that new sense which is the gift
of sorrow,--that susceptibility to the bare offices of humanity which raises them into a bond
of loving fellowship, as to haggard men among the ice-bergs the mere presence of an ordinary
comrade stirs the deep fountains of affection.

Mr. Stelling put his hand on Tom's shoulder and said: "God bless you, my boy; let me know how
you get on." Then he pressed Maggie's hand; but there were no audible good-byes. Tom had so
often thought how joyful he should be the day he left school "for good"! And now his school
years seemed like a holiday that had come to an end.

The two slight youthful figures soon grew indistinct on the distant road,--were soon lost behind
the projecting hedgerow.

They had gone forth together into their life of sorrow, and they would never more see the sunshine
undimmed by remembered cares. They had entered the thorny wilderness, and the golden gates
of their childhood had forever closed behind them.

Book III

The Downfall

Chapter I

What Had Happened at Home

When Mr. Tulliver first knew the fact that the law-suit was decided against him, and that Pivart
and Wakem were triumphant, every one who happened to observe him at the time thought that,
for so confident and hot-tempered a man, he bore the blow remarkably well. He thought so himself;
he thought he was going to show that if Wakem or anybody else considered him crushed, they
would find themselves mistaken. He could not refuse to see that the costs of this protracted
suit would take more than he possessed to pay them; but he appeared to himself to be full of
expedients by which he could ward off any results but such as were tolerable, and could avoid
the appearance of breaking down in the world. All the obstinacy and defiance of his nature,
driven out of their old channel, found a vent for themselves in the immediate formation of
plans by which he would meet his difficulties, and remain Mr. Tulliver of Dorlcote Mill in
spite of them. There was such a rush of projects in his brain, that it was no wonder his face
was flushed when he came away from his talk with his attorney, Mr. Gore, and mounted his horse
to ride home from Lindum. There was Furley, who held the mortgage on the land,--a reasonable
fellow, who would see his own interest, Mr. Tulliver was convinced, and who would be glad not
only to purchase the whole estate, including the mill and homestead, but would accept Mr. Tulliver
as tenant, and be willing to advance money to be repaid with high interest out of the profits
of the business, which would be made over to him, Mr. Tulliver only taking enough barely to
maintain himself and his family. Who would neglect such a profitable investment? Certainly
not Furley, for Mr. Tulliver had determined that Furley should meet his plans with the utmost
alacrity; and there are men whoses brains have not yet been dangerously heated by the loss
of a lawsuit, who are apt to see in their own interest or desires a motive for other men's
actions. There was no doubt (in the miller's mind) that Furley would do just what was desirable;
and if he did--why, things would not be so very much worse. Mr. Tulliver and his family must
live more meagrely and humbly, but it would only be till the profits of the business had paid
off Furley's advances, and that might be while Mr. Tulliver had still a good many years of
life before him. It was clear that the costs of the suit could be paid without his being obliged
to turn out of his old place, and look like a ruined man. It was certainly an awkward moment
in his affairs. There was that suretyship for poor Riley, who had died suddenly last April,
and left his friend saddled with a debt of two hundred and fifty pounds,--a fact which had
helped to make Mr. Tulliver's banking book less pleasant reading than a man might desire toward
Christmas. Well! he had never been one of those poor-spirited sneaks who would refuse to give
a helping hand to a fellow-traveller in this puzzling world. The really vexatious business
was the fact that some months ago the creditor who had lent him the five hundred pounds to
repay Mrs. Glegg had become uneasy about his money (set on by Wakem, of course), and Mr. Tulliver,
still confident that he should gain his suit, and finding it eminently inconvenient to raise
the said sum until that desirable issue had taken place, had rashly acceded to the demand that
he should give a bill of sale on his household furniture and some other effects, as security
in lieu of the bond. It was all one, he had said to himself; he should soon pay off the money,
and there was no harm in giving that security any more than another. But now the consequences
of this bill of sale occurred to him in a new light, and he remembered that the time was close
at hand when it would be enforced unless the money were repaid. Two months ago he would have
declared stoutly that he would never be beholden to his wife's friends; but now he told himself
as stoutly that it was nothing but right and natural that Bessy should go to the Pullets and
explain the thing to them; they would hardly let Bessy's furniture be sold, and it might be
security to Pullet if he advanced the money,--there would, after all, be no gift or favor in
the matter. Mr. Tulliver would never have asked for anything from so poor-spirited a fellow
for himself, but Bessy might do so if she liked.

It is precisely the proudest and most obstinate men who are the most liable to shift their
position and contradict themselves in this sudden manner; everything is easier to them than
to face the simple fact that they have been thoroughly defeated, and must begin life anew.
And Mr. Tulliver, you perceive, though nothing more than a superior miller and maltster, was
as proud and obstinate as if he had been a very lofty personage, in whom such dispositions
might be a source of that conspicuous, far-echoing tragedy, which sweeps the stage in regal
robes, and makes the dullest chronicler sublime. The pride and obstinacy of millers and other
insignificant people, whom you pass unnoticingly on the road every day, have their tragedy
too; but it is of that unwept, hidden sort that goes on from generation to generation, and
leaves no record,--such tragedy, perhaps, as lies in the conflicts of young souls, hungry for
joy, under a lot made suddenly hard to them, under the dreariness of a home where the morning
brings no promise with it, and where the unexpectant discontent of worn and disappointed parents
weighs on the children like a damp, thick air, in which all the functions of life are depressed;
or such tragedy as lies in the slow or sudden death that follows on a bruised passion, though
it may be a death that finds only a parish funeral. There are certain animals to which tenacity
of position is a law of life,--they can never flourish again, after a single wrench: and there
are certain human beings to whom predominance is a law of life,--they can only sustain humiliation
so long as they can refuse to believe in it, and, in their own conception, predominate still.

Mr. Tulliver was still predominating, in his own imagination, as he approached St. Ogg's, through
which he had to pass on his way homeward. But what was it that suggested to him, as he saw
the Laceham coach entering the town, to follow it to the coach-office, and get the clerk there
to write a letter, requiring Maggie to come home the very next day? Mr. Tulliver's own hand
shook too much under his excitement for him to write himself, and he wanted the letter to be
given to the coachman to deliver at Miss Firniss's school in the morning. There was a craving
which he would not account for to himself, to have Maggie near him, without delay,--she must
come back by the coach to-morrow.

To Mrs. Tulliver, when he got home, he would admit no difficulties, and scolded down her burst
of grief on hearing that the lawsuit was lost, by angry assertions that there was nothing to
grieve about. He said nothing to her that night about the bill of sale and the application
to Mrs. Pullet, for he had kept her in ignorance of the nature of that transaction, and had
explained the necessity for taking an inventory of the goods as a matter connected with his
will. The possession of a wife conspicuously one's inferior in intellect is, like other high
privileges, attended with a few inconveniences, and, among the rest, with the occasional necessity
for using a little deception.

The next day Mr. Tulliver was again on horseback in the afternoon, on his way to Mr. Gore's
office at St. Ogg's. Gore was to have seen Furley in the morning, and to have sounded him in
relation to Mr. Tulliver's affairs. But he had not gone half-way when he met a clerk from Mr.
Gore's office, who was bringing a letter to Mr. Tulliver. Mr. Gore had been prevented by a
sudden call of business from waiting at his office to see Mr. Tulliver, according to appointment,
but would be at his office at eleven to-morrow morning, and meanwhile had sent some important
information by letter.

"Oh!" said Mr. Tulliver, taking the letter, but not opening it. "Then tell Gore I'll see him
to-morrow at eleven"; and he turned his horse.

The clerk, struck with Mr. Tulliver's glistening, excited glance, looked after him for a few
moments, and then rode away. The reading of a letter was not the affair of an instant to Mr.
Tulliver; he took in the sense of a statement very slowly through the medium of written or
even printed characters; so he had put the letter in his pocket, thinking he would open it
in his armchair at home. But by-and-by it occurred to him that there might be something in
the letter Mrs. Tulliver must not know about, and if so, it would be better to keep it out
of her sight altogether. He stopped his horse, took out the letter, and read it. It was only
a short letter; the substance was, that Mr. Gore had ascertained, on secret, but sure authority,
that Furley had been lately much straitened for money, and had parted with his securities,--among
the rest, the mortgage on Mr. Tulliver's property, which he had transferred to----Wakem.

In half an hour after this Mr. Tulliver's own wagoner found him lying by the roadside insensible,
with an open letter near him, and his gray horse snuffing uneasily about him.

When Maggie reached home that evening, in obedience to her father's call, he was no longer
insensible. About an hour before he had become conscious, and after vague, vacant looks around
him, had muttered something about "a letter," which he presently repeated impatiently. At the
instance of Mr. Turnbull, the medical man, Gore's letter was brought and laid on the bed, and
the previous impatience seemed to be allayed. The stricken man lay for some time with his eyes
fixed on the letter, as if he were trying to knit up his thoughts by its help. But presently
a new wave of memory seemed to have come and swept the other away; he turned his eyes from
the letter to the door, and after looking uneasily, as if striving to see something his eyes
were too dim for, he said, "The little wench."

He repeated the words impatiently from time to time, appearing entirely unconscious of everything
except this one importunate want, and giving no sign of knowing his wife or any one else; and
poor Mrs. Tulliver, her feeble faculties almost paralyzed by this sudden accumulation of troubles,
went backward and forward to the gate to see if the Laceham coach were coming, though it was
not yet time.

But it came at last, and set down the poor anxious girl, no longer the "little wench," except
to her father's fond memory.

"Oh, mother, what is the matter?" Maggie said, with pale lips, as her mother came toward her
crying. She didn't think her father was ill, because the letter had come at his dictation from
the office at St. Ogg's.

But Mr. Turnbull came now to meet her; a medical man is the good angel of the troubled house,
and Maggie ran toward the kind old friend, whom she remembered as long as she could remember
anything, with a trembling, questioning look.

"Don't alarm yourself too much, my dear," he said, taking her hand. "Your father has had a
sudden attack, and has not quite recovered his memory. But he has been asking for you, and
it will do him good to see you. Keep as quiet as you can; take off your things, and come upstairs
with me."

Maggie obeyed, with that terrible beating of the heart which makes existence seem simply a
painful pulsation. The very quietness with which Mr. Turnbull spoke had frightened her susceptible
imagination. Her father's eyes were still turned uneasily toward the door when she entered
and met the strange, yearning, helpless look that had been seeking her in vain. With a sudden
flash and movement, he raised himself in the bed; she rushed toward him, and clasped him with
agonized kisses.

Poor child! it was very early for her to know one of those supreme moments in life when all
we have hoped or delighted in, all we can dread or endure, falls away from our regard as insignificant;
is lost, like a trivial memory, in that simple, primitive love which knits us to the beings
who have been nearest to us, in their times of helplessness or of anguish.

But that flash of recognition had been too great a strain on the father's bruised, enfeebled
powers. He sank back again in renewed insensibility and rigidity, which lasted for many hours,
and was only broken by a flickering return of consciousness, in which he took passively everything
that was given to him, and seemed to have a sort of infantine satisfaction in Maggie's near
presence,--such satisfaction as a baby has when it is returned to the nurse's lap.

Mrs. Tulliver sent for her sisters, and there was much wailing and lifting up of hands below
stairs. Both uncles and aunts saw that the ruin of Bessy and her family was as complete as
they had ever foreboded it, and there was a general family sense that a judgment had fallen
on Mr. Tulliver, which it would be an impiety to counteract by too much kindness. But Maggie
heard little of this, scarcely ever leaving her father's bedside, where she sat opposite him
with her hand on his. Mrs. Tulliver wanted to have Tom fetched home, and seemed to be thinking
more of her boy even than of her husband; but the aunts and uncles opposed this. Tom was better
at school, since Mr. Turnbull said there was no immediate danger, he believed. But at the end
of the second day, when Maggie had become more accustomed to her father's fits of insensibility,
and to the expectation that he would revive from them, the thought of Tom had become urgent
with her too; and when her mother sate crying at night and saying, "My poor lad--it's nothing
but right he should come home," Maggie said, "Let me go for him, and tell him, mother; I'll
go to-morrow morning if father doesn't know me and want me. It would be so hard for Tom to
come home and not know anything about it beforehand."

And the next morning Maggie went, as we have seen. Sitting on the coach on their way home,
the brother and sister talked to each other in sad, interrupted whispers.

"They say Mr. Wakem has got a mortgage or something on the land, Tom," said Maggie. "It was
the letter with that news in it that made father ill, they think."

"I believe that scoundrel's been planning all along to ruin my father," said Tom, leaping from
the vaguest impressions to a definite conclusion. "I'll make him feel for it when I'm a man.
Mind you never speak to Philip again."

"Oh, Tom!" said Maggie, in a tone of sad remonstrance; but she had no spirit to dispute anything
then, still less to vex Tom by opposing him.

Chapter II

Mrs. Tulliver's Teraphim, or Household Gods

When the coach set down Tom and Maggie, it was five hours since she had started from home,
and she was thinking with some trembling that her father had perhaps missed her, and asked
for "the little wench" in vain. She thought of no other change that might have happened.

She hurried along the gravel-walk and entered the house before Tom; but in the entrance she
was startled by a strong smell of tobacco. The parlor door was ajar; that was where the smell
came from. It was very strange; could any visitor be smoking at a time like this? Was her mother
there? If so, she must be told that Tom was come. Maggie, after this pause of surprise, was
only in the act of opening the door when Tom came up, and they both looked into the parlor
together.

There was a coarse, dingy man, of whose face Tom had some vague recollection, sitting in his
father's chair, smoking, with a jug and glass beside him.

The truth flashed on Tom's mind in an instant. To "have the bailiff in the house," and "to
be sold up," were phrases which he had been used to, even as a little boy; they were part of
the disgrace and misery of "failing," of losing all one's money, and being ruined,--sinking
into the condition of poor working people. It seemed only natural this should happen, since
his father had lost all his property, and he thought of no more special cause for this particular
form of misfortune than the loss of the lawsuit. But the immediate presence of this disgrace
was so much keener an experience to Tom than the worst form of apprehension, that he felt at
this moment as if his real trouble had only just begin; it was a touch on the irritated nerve
compared with its spontaneous dull aching.

"How do you do, sir?" said the man, taking the pipe out of his mouth, with rough, embarrassed
civility. The two young startled faces made him a little uncomfortable.

But Tom turned away hastily without speaking; the sight was too hateful. Maggie had not understood
the appearance of this stranger, as Tom had. She followed him, whispering: "Who can it be,
Tom? What is the matter?" Then, with a sudden undefined dread lest this stranger might have
something to do with a change in her father, she rushed upstairs, checking herself at the bedroom
door to throw off her bonnet, and enter on tiptoe. All was silent there; her father was lying,
heedless of everything around him, with his eyes closed as when she had left him. A servant
was there, but not her mother.

"Where's my mother?" she whispered. The servant did not know.

Maggie hastened out, and said to Tom; "Father is lying quiet; let us go and look for my mother.
I wonder where she is."

Mrs. Tulliver was not downstairs, not in any of the bedrooms. There was but one room below
the attic which Maggie had left unsearched; it was the storeroom, where her mother kept all
her linen and all the precious "best things" that were only unwrapped and brought out on special
occasions.

Tom, preceding Maggie, as they returned along the passage, opened the door of this room, and
immediately said, "Mother!"

Mrs. Tulliver was seated there with all her laid-up treasures. One of the linen chests was
open; the silver teapot was unwrapped from its many folds of paper, and the best china was
laid out on the top of the closed linen-chest; spoons and skewers and ladles were spread in
rows on the shelves; and the poor woman was shaking her head and weeping, with a bitter tension
of the mouth, over the mark, "Elizabeth Dodson," on the corner of some tablecloths she held
in her lap.

She dropped them, and started up as Tom spoke.

"Oh, my boy, my boy!" she said, clasping him round the neck. "To think as I should live to
see this day! We're ruined--everything's going to be sold up--to think as your father should
ha' married me to bring me to this! We've got nothing--we shall be beggars--we must go to the
workhouse----"

She kissed him, then seated herself again, and took another tablecloth on her lap, unfolding
it a little way to look at the pattern, while the children stood by in mute wretchedness, their
minds quite filled for the moment with the words "beggars" and "workhouse."

"To think o' these cloths as I spun myself," she went on, lifting things out and turning them
over with an excitement all the more strange and piteous because the stout blond woman was
usually so passive,--if she had been ruffled before, it was at the surface merely,--"and Job
Haxey wove 'em, and brought the piece home on his back, as I remember standing at the door
and seeing him come, before I ever thought o' marrying your father! And the pattern as I chose
myself, and bleached so beautiful, and I marked 'em so as nobody ever saw such marking,--they
must cut the cloth to get it out, for it's a particular stitch. And they're all to be sold,
and go into strange people's houses, and perhaps be cut with the knives, and wore out before
I'm dead. You'll never have one of 'em, my boy," she said, looking up at Tom with her eyes
full of tears, "and I meant 'em for you. I wanted you to have all o' this pattern. Maggie could
have had the large check--it never shows so well when the dishes are on it."

Tom was touched to the quick, but there was an angry reaction immediately. His face flushed
as he said:

"But will my aunts let them be sold, mother? Do they know about it? They'll never let your
linen go, will they? Haven't you sent to them?"

"Yes, I sent Luke directly they'd put the bailies in, and your aunt Pullet's been--and, oh
dear, oh dear, she cries so and says your father's disgraced my family and made it the talk
o' the country; and she'll buy the spotted cloths for herself, because she's never had so many
as she wanted o' that pattern, and they sha'n't go to strangers, but she's got more checks
a'ready nor she can do with." (Here Mrs. Tulliver began to lay back the tablecloths in the
chest, folding and stroking them automatically.) "And your uncle Glegg's been too, and he says
things must be bought in for us to lie down on, but he must talk to your aunt; and they're
all coming to consult. But I know they'll none of 'em take my chany," she added, turning toward
the cups and saucers, "for they all found fault with 'em when I bought 'em, 'cause o' the small
gold sprig all over 'em, between the flowers. But there's none of 'em got better chany, not
even your aunt Pullet herself; and I bought it wi' my own money as I'd saved ever since I was
turned fifteen; and the silver teapot, too,--your father never paid for 'em. And to think as
he should ha' married me, and brought me to this."

Mrs. Tulliver burst out crying afresh, and she sobbed with her handkerchief at her eyes a few
moments, but then removing it, she said in a deprecating way, still half sobbing, as if she
were called upon to speak before she could command her voice,--

"And I did say to him times and times, 'Whativer you do, don't go to law,' and what more could
I do? I've had to sit by while my own fortin's been spent, and what should ha' been my children's,
too. You'll have niver a penny, my boy--but it isn't your poor mother's fault."

She put out one arm toward Tom, looking up at him piteously with her helpless, childish blue
eyes. The poor lad went to her and kissed her, and she clung to him. For the first time Tom
thought of his father with some reproach. His natural inclination to blame, hitherto kept entirely
in abeyance toward his father by the predisposition to think him always right, simply on the
ground that he was Tom Tulliver's father, was turned into this new channel by his mother's
plaints; and with his indignation against Wakem there began to mingle some indignation of another
sort. Perhaps his father might have helped bringing them all down in the world, and making
people talk of them with contempt, but no one should talk long of Tom Tulliver with contempt.

The natural strength and firmness of his nature was beginning to assert itself, urged by the
double stimulus of resentment against his aunts, and the sense that he must behave like a man
and take care of his mother.

"Don't fret, mother," he said tenderly. "I shall soon be able to get money; I'll get a situation
of some sort."

"Bless you, my boy!" said Mrs. Tulliver, a little soothed. Then, looking round sadly, "But
I shouldn't ha' minded so much if we could ha' kept the things wi' my name on 'em."

Maggie had witnessed this scene with gathering anger. The implied reproaches against her father--her
father, who was lying there in a sort of living death--neutralized all her pity for griefs
about tablecloths and china; and her anger on her father's account was heightened by some egoistic
resentment at Tom's silent concurrence with her mother in shutting her out from the common
calamity. She had become almost indifferent to her mother's habitual depreciation of her, but
she was keenly alive to any sanction of it, however passive, that she might suspect in Tom.
Poor Maggie was by no means made up of unalloyed devotedness, but put forth large claims for
herself where she loved strongly. She burst out at last in an agitated, almost violent tone:
"Mother, how can you talk so; as if you cared only for things with your name on, and not for
what has my father's name too; and to care about anything but dear father himself!--when he's
lying there, and may never speak to us again. Tom, you ought to say so too; you ought not to
let any one find fault with my father."

Maggie, almost choked with mingled grief and anger, left the room, and took her old place on
her father's bed. Her heart went out to him with a stronger movement than ever, at the thought
that people would blame him. Maggie hated blame; she had been blamed all her life, and nothing
had come of it but evil tempers.

Her father had always defended and excused her, and her loving remembrance of his tenderness
was a force within her that would enable her to do or bear anything for his sake.

Tom was a little shocked at Maggie's outburst,--telling him as well as his mother what it was
right to do! She ought to have learned better than have those hectoring, assuming manners,
by this time. But he presently went into his father's room, and the sight there touched him
in a way that effaced the slighter impressions of the previous hour. When Maggie saw how he
was moved, she went to him and put her arm round his neck as he sat by the bed, and the two
children forgot everything else in the sense that they had one father and one sorrow.

Chapter III

The Family Council

It was at eleven o'clock the next morning that the aunts and uncles came to hold their consultation.
The fire was lighted in the large parlor, and poor Mrs. Tulliver, with a confused impression
that it was a great occasion, like a funeral, unbagged the bell-rope tassels, and unpinned
the curtains, adjusting them in proper folds, looking round and shaking her head sadly at the
polished tops and legs of the tables, which sister Pullet herself could not accuse of insufficient
brightness.

Mr. Deane was not coming, he was away on business; but Mrs. Deane appeared punctually in that
handsome new gig with the head to it, and the livery-servant driving it, which had thrown so
clear a light on several traits in her character to some of her female friends in St. Ogg's.
Mr. Deane had been advancing in the world as rapidly as Mr. Tulliver had been going down in
it; and in Mrs. Deane's house the Dodson linen and plate were beginning to hold quite a subordinate
position, as a mere supplement to the handsomer articles of the same kind, purchased in recent
years,--a change which had caused an occasional coolness in the sisterly intercourse between
her and Mrs. Glegg, who felt that Susan was getting "like the rest," and there would soon be
little of the true Dodson spirit surviving except in herself, and, it might be hoped, in those
nephews who supported the Dodson name on the family land, far away in the Wolds.

People who live at a distance are naturally less faulty than those immediately under our own
eyes; and it seems superfluous, when we consider the remote geographical position of the Ethiopians,
and how very little the Greeks had to do with them, to inquire further why Homer calls them
"blameless."

Mrs. Deane was the first to arrive; and when she had taken her seat in the large parlor, Mrs.
Tulliver came down to her with her comely face a little distorted, nearly as it would have
been if she had been crying. She was not a woman who could shed abundant tears, except in moments
when the prospect of losing her furniture became unusually vivid, but she felt how unfitting
it was to be quite calm under present circumstances.

"Oh, sister, what a world this is!" she exclaimed as she entered; "what trouble, oh dear!"

Mrs. Deane was a thin-lipped woman, who made small well-considered speeches on peculiar occasions,
repeating them afterward to her husband, and asking him if she had not spoken very properly.

"Yes, sister," she said deliberately, "this is a changing world, and we don't know to-day what
may happen tomorrow. But it's right to be prepared for all things, and if trouble's sent, to
remember as it isn't sent without a cause. I'm very sorry for you as a sister, and if the doctor
orders jelly for Mr. Tulliver, I hope you'll let me know. I'll send it willingly; for it is
but right he should have proper attendance while he's ill."

"Thank you, Susan," said Mrs. Tulliver, rather faintly, withdrawing her fat hand from her sister's
thin one. "But there's been no talk o' jelly yet." Then after a moment's pause she added, "There's
a dozen o' cut jelly-glasses upstairs--I shall never put jelly into 'em no more."

Her voice was rather agitated as she uttered the last words, but the sound of wheels diverted
her thoughts. Mr. and Mrs. Glegg were come, and were almost immediately followed by Mr. and
Mrs. Pullet.

Mrs. Pullet entered crying, as a compendious mode, at all times, of expressing what were her
views of life in general, and what, in brief, were the opinions she held concerning the particular
case before her.

Mrs. Glegg had on her fuzziest front, and garments which appeared to have had a recent resurrection
from rather a creasy form of burial; a costume selected with the high moral purpose of instilling
perfect humility into Bessy and her children.

"Mrs. G., won't you come nearer the fire?" said her husband, unwilling to take the more comfortable
seat without offering it to her.

"You see I've seated myself here, Mr. Glegg," returned this superior woman; "you can roast
yourself, if you like."

"Well," said Mr. Glegg, seating himself good-humoredly, "and how's the poor man upstairs?"

"Dr. Turnbull thought him a deal better this morning," said Mrs. Tulliver; "he took more notice,
and spoke to me; but he's never known Tom yet,--looks at the poor lad as if he was a stranger,
though he said something once about Tom and the pony. The doctor says his memory's gone a long
way back, and he doesn't know Tom because he's thinking of him when he was little. Eh dear,
eh dear!"

"I doubt it's the water got on his brain," said aunt Pullet, turning round from adjusting her
cap in a melancholy way at the pier-glass. "It's much if he ever gets up again; and if he does,
he'll most like be childish, as Mr. Carr was, poor man! They fed him with a spoon as if he'd
been a babby for three year. He'd quite lost the use of his limbs; but then he'd got a Bath
chair, and somebody to draw him; and that's what you won't have, I doubt, Bessy."

"Sister Pullet," said Mrs. Glegg, severely, "if I understand right, we've come together this
morning to advise and consult about what's to be done in this disgrace as has fallen upon the
family, and not to talk o' people as don't belong to us. Mr. Carr was none of our blood, nor
noways connected with us, as I've ever heared."

"Sister Glegg," said Mrs. Pullet, in a pleading tone, drawing on her gloves again, and stroking
the fingers in an agitated manner, "if you've got anything disrespectful to say o' Mr. Carr,
I do beg of you as you won't say it to me. I know what he was," she added, with a sigh; "his
breath was short to that degree as you could hear him two rooms off."

"Sophy!" said Mrs. Glegg, with indignant disgust, "you do talk o' people's complaints till
it's quite undecent. But I say again, as I said before, I didn't come away from home to talk
about acquaintances, whether they'd short breath or long. If we aren't come together for one
to hear what the other 'ull do to save a sister and her children from the parish, I shall go
back. One can't act without the other, I suppose; it isn't to be expected as I should do everything."

"Well, Jane," said Mrs. Pullet, "I don't see as you've been so very forrard at doing. So far
as I know, this is the first time as here you've been, since it's been known as the bailiff's
in the house; and I was here yesterday, and looked at all Bessy's linen and things, and I told
her I'd buy in the spotted tablecloths. I couldn't speak fairer; for as for the teapot as she
doesn't want to go out o' the family, it stands to sense I can't do with two silver teapots,
not if it hadn't a straight spout, but the spotted damask I was allays fond on."

"I wish it could be managed so as my teapot and chany and the best castors needn't be put up
for sale," said poor Mrs. Tulliver, beseechingly, "and the sugar-tongs the first things ever
I bought."

"But that can't be helped, you know," said Mr. Glegg. "If one o' the family chooses to buy
'em in, they can, but one thing must be bid for as well as another."

"And it isn't to be looked for," said uncle Pullet, with unwonted independence of idea, "as
your own family should pay more for things nor they'll fetch. They may go for an old song by
auction."

"Oh dear, oh dear," said Mrs. Tulliver, "to think o' my chany being sold i' that way, and I
bought it when I was married, just as you did yours, Jane and Sophy; and I know you didn't
like mine, because o' the sprig, but I was fond of it; and there's never been a bit broke,
for I've washed it myself; and there's the tulips on the cups, and the roses, as anybody might
go and look at 'em for pleasure. You wouldn't like your chany to go for an old song and be
broke to pieces, though yours has got no color in it, Jane,--it's all white and fluted, and
didn't cost so much as mine. And there's the castors, sister Deane, I can't think but you'd
like to have the castors, for I've heard you say they're pretty."

"Well, I've no objection to buy some of the best things," said Mrs. Deane, rather loftily;
"we can do with extra things in our house."

"Best things!" exclaimed Mrs. Glegg, with severity, which had gathered intensity from her long
silence. "It drives me past patience to hear you all talking o' best things, and buying in
this, that, and the other, such as silver and chany. You must bring your mind to your circumstances,
Bessy, and not be thinking o' silver and chany; but whether you shall get so much as a flock-bed
to lie on, and a blanket to cover you, and a stool to sit on. You must remember, if you get
'em, it'll be because your friends have bought 'em for you, for you're dependent upon them
for everything; for your husband lies there helpless, and hasn't got a penny i' the world to
call his own. And it's for your own good I say this, for it's right you should feel what your
state is, and what disgrace your husband's brought on your own family, as you've got to look
to for everything, and be humble in your mind."

Mrs. Glegg paused, for speaking with much energy for the good of others is naturally exhausting.

Mrs. Tulliver, always borne down by the family predominance of sister Jane, who had made her
wear the yoke of a younger sister in very tender years, said pleadingly:

"I'm sure, sister, I've never asked anybody to do anything, only buy things as it 'ud be a
pleasure to 'em to have, so as they mightn't go and be spoiled i' strange houses. I never asked
anybody to buy the things in for me and my children; though there's the linen I spun, and I
thought when Tom was born,--I thought one o' the first things when he was lying i' the cradle,
as all the things I'd bought wi' my own money, and been so careful of, 'ud go to him. But I've
said nothing as I wanted my sisters to pay their money for me. What my husband has done for
his sister's unknown, and we should ha' been better off this day if it hadn't been as he's
lent money and never asked for it again."

"Come, come," said Mr. Glegg, kindly, "don't let us make things too dark. What's done can't
be undone. We shall make a shift among us to buy what's sufficient for you; though, as Mrs.
G. says, they must be useful, plain things. We mustn't be thinking o' what's unnecessary. A
table, and a chair or two, and kitchen things, and a good bed, and such-like. Why, I've seen
the day when I shouldn't ha' known myself if I'd lain on sacking i'stead o' the floor. We get
a deal o' useless things about us, only because we've got the money to spend."

"Mr. Glegg," said Mrs. G., "if you'll be kind enough to let me speak, i'stead o' taking the
words out o' my mouth,--I was going to say, Bessy, as it's fine talking for you to say as you've
never asked us to buy anything for you; let me tell you, you ought to have asked us. Pray,
how are you to be purvided for, if your own family don't help you? You must go to the parish,
if they didn't. And you ought to know that, and keep it in mind, and ask us humble to do what
we can for you, i'stead o' saying, and making a boast, as you've never asked us for anything."

"You talked o' the Mosses, and what Mr. Tulliver's done for 'em," said uncle Pullet, who became
unusually suggestive where advances of money were concerned. "Haven't they been anear you?
They ought to do something as well as other folks; and if he's lent 'em money, they ought to
be made to pay it back."

"Yes, to be sure," said Mrs. Deane; "I've been thinking so. How is it Mr. and Mrs. Moss aren't
here to meet us? It is but right they should do their share."

"Oh, dear!" said Mrs. Tulliver, "I never sent 'em word about Mr. Tulliver, and they live so
back'ard among the lanes at Basset, they niver hear anything only when Mr. Moss comes to market.
But I niver gave 'em a thought. I wonder Maggie didn't, though, for she was allays so fond
of her aunt Moss."

"Why don't your children come in, Bessy?" said Mrs. Pullet, at the mention of Maggie. "They
should hear what their aunts and uncles have got to say; and Maggie,--when it's me as have
paid for half her schooling, she ought to think more of her aunt Pullet than of aunt Moss.
I may go off sudden when I get home to-day; there's no telling."

"If I'd had my way," said Mrs. Glegg, "the children 'ud ha' been in the room from the first.
It's time they knew who they've to look to, and it's right as somebody should talk to 'em,
and let 'em know their condition i' life, and what they're come down to, and make 'em feel
as they've got to suffer for their father's faults."

"Well, I'll go and fetch 'em, sister," said Mrs. Tulliver, resignedly. She was quite crushed
now, and thought of the treasures in the storeroom with no other feeling than blank despair.

She went upstairs to fetch Tom and Maggie, who were both in their father's room, and was on
her way down again, when the sight of the storeroom door suggested a new thought to her. She
went toward it, and left the children to go down by themselves.

The aunts and uncles appeared to have been in warm discussion when the brother and sister entered,--both
with shrinking reluctance; for though Tom, with a practical sagacity which had been roused
into activity by the strong stimulus of the new emotions he had undergone since yesterday,
had been turning over in his mind a plan which he meant to propose to one of his aunts or uncles,
he felt by no means amicably toward them, and dreaded meeting them all at once as he would
have dreaded a large dose of concentrated physic, which was but just endurable in small draughts.
As for Maggie, she was peculiarly depressed this morning; she had been called up, after brief
rest, at three o'clock, and had that strange dreamy weariness which comes from watching in
a sick-room through the chill hours of early twilight and breaking day,--in which the outside
day-light life seems to have no importance, and to be a mere margin to the hours in the darkened
chamber. Their entrance interrupted the conversation. The shaking of hands was a melancholy
and silent ceremony, till uncle Pullet observed, as Tom approached him:

"Well, young sir, we've been talking as we should want your pen and ink; you can write rarely
now, after all your schooling, I should think."

"Ay, ay," said uncle Glegg, with admonition which he meant to be kind, "we must look to see
the good of all this schooling, as your father's sunk so much money in, now,--

  'When land is gone and money's spent,
  Then learning is most excellent.'

Now's the time, Tom, to let us see the good o' your learning. Let us see whether you can do
better than I can, as have made my fortin without it. But I began wi' doing with little, you
see; I could live on a basin o' porridge and a crust o' bread-and-cheese. But I doubt high
living and high learning 'ull make it harder for you, young man, nor it was for me."

"But he must do it," interposed aunt Glegg, energetically, "whether it's hard or no. He hasn't
got to consider what's hard; he must consider as he isn't to trusten to his friends to keep
him in idleness and luxury; he's got to bear the fruits of his father's misconduct, and bring
his mind to fare hard and to work hard. And he must be humble and grateful to his aunts and
uncles for what they're doing for his mother and father, as must be turned out into the streets
and go to the workhouse if they didn't help 'em. And his sister, too," continued Mrs. Glegg,
looking severely at Maggie, who had sat down on the sofa by her aunt Deane, drawn to her by
the sense that she was Lucy's mother, "she must make up her mind to be humble and work; for
there'll be no servants to wait on her any more,--she must remember that. She must do the work
o' the house, and she must respect and love her aunts as have done so much for her, and saved
their money to leave to their nepheys and nieces."

Tom was still standing before the table in the centre of the group. There was a heightened
color in his face, and he was very far from looking humbled, but he was preparing to say, in
a respectful tone, something he had previously meditated, when the door opened and his mother
re-entered.

Poor Mrs. Tulliver had in her hands a small tray, on which she had placed her silver teapot,
a specimen teacup and saucer, the castors, and sugar-tongs.

"See here, sister," she said, looking at Mrs. Deane, as she set the tray on the table, "I thought,
perhaps, if you looked at the teapot again,--it's a good while since you saw it,--you might
like the pattern better; it makes beautiful tea, and there's a stand and everything; you might
use it for every day, or else lay it by for Lucy when she goes to housekeeping. I should be
so loath for 'em to buy it at the Golden Lion," said the poor woman, her heart swelling, and
the tears coming,--"my teapot as I bought when I was married, and to think of its being scratched,
and set before the travellers and folks, and my letters on it,--see here, E. D.,--and everybody
to see 'em."

"Ah, dear, dear!" said aunt Pullet, shaking her head with deep sadness, "it's very bad,--to
think o' the family initials going about everywhere--it niver was so before; you're a very
unlucky sister, Bessy. But what's the use o' buying the teapot, when there's the linen and
spoons and everything to go, and some of 'em with your full name,--and when it's got that straight
spout, too."

"As to disgrace o' the family," said Mrs. Glegg, "that can't be helped wi' buying teapots.
The disgrace is, for one o' the family to ha' married a man as has brought her to beggary.
The disgrace is, as they're to be sold up. We can't hinder the country from knowing that."

Maggie had started up from the sofa at the allusion to her father, but Tom saw her action and
flushed face in time to prevent her from speaking. "Be quiet, Maggie," he said authoritatively,
pushing her aside. It was a remarkable manifestation of self-command and practical judgment
in a lad of fifteen, that when his aunt Glegg ceased, he began to speak in a quiet and respectful
manner, though with a good deal of trembling in his voice; for his mother's words had cut him
to the quick.

"Then, aunt," he said, looking straight at Mrs. Glegg, "if you think it's a disgrace to the
family that we should be sold up, wouldn't it be better to prevent it altogether? And if you
and aunt Pullet," he continued, looking at the latter, "think of leaving any money to me and
Maggie, wouldn't it be better to give it now, and pay the debt we're going to be sold up for,
and save my mother from parting with her furniture?"

There was silence for a few moments, for every one, including Maggie, was astonished at Tom's
sudden manliness of tone. Uncle Glegg was the first to speak.

"Ay, ay, young man, come now! You show some notion o' things. But there's the interest, you
must remember; your aunts get five per cent on their money, and they'd lose that if they advanced
it; you haven't thought o' that."

"I could work and pay that every year," said Tom, promptly. "I'd do anything to save my mother
from parting with her things."

"Well done!" said uncle Glegg, admiringly. He had been drawing Tom out, rather than reflecting
on the practicability of his proposal. But he had produced the unfortunate result of irritating
his wife."

"Yes, Mr. Glegg!" said that lady, with angry sarcasm. "It's pleasant work for you to be giving
my money away, as you've pretended to leave at my own disposal. And my money, as was my own
father's gift, and not yours, Mr. Glegg; and I've saved it, and added to it myself, and had
more to put out almost every year, and it's to go and be sunk in other folks' furniture, and
encourage 'em in luxury and extravagance as they've no means of supporting; and I'm to alter
my will, or have a codicil made, and leave two or three hundred less behind me when I die,--me
as have allays done right and been careful, and the eldest o' the family; and my money's to
go and be squandered on them as have had the same chance as me, only they've been wicked and
wasteful. Sister Pullet, you may do as you like, and you may let your husband rob you back
again o' the money he's given you, but that isn't my sperrit."

"La, Jane, how fiery you are!" said Mrs. Pullet. "I'm sure you'll have the blood in your head,
and have to be cupped. I'm sorry for Bessy and her children,--I'm sure I think of 'em o' nights
dreadful, for I sleep very bad wi' this new medicine,--but it's no use for me to think o' doing
anything, if you won't meet me half-way."

"Why, there's this to be considered," said Mr. Glegg. "It's no use to pay off this debt and
save the furniture, when there's all the law debts behind, as 'ud take every shilling, and
more than could be made out o' land and stock, for I've made that out from Lawyer Gore. We'd
need save our money to keep the poor man with, instead o' spending it on furniture as he can
neither eat nor drink. You will be so hasty, Jane, as if I didn't know what was reasonable."

"Then speak accordingly, Mr. Glegg!" said his wife, with slow, loud emphasis, bending her head
toward him significantly.

Tom's countenance had fallen during this conversation, and his lip quivered; but he was determined
not to give way. He would behave like a man. Maggie, on the contrary, after her momentary delight
in Tom's speech, had relapsed into her state of trembling indignation. Her mother had been
standing close by Tom's side, and had been clinging to his arm ever since he had last spoken;
Maggie suddenly started up and stood in front of them, her eyes flashing like the eyes of a
young lioness.

"Why do you come, then," she burst out, "talking and interfering with us and scolding us, if
you don't mean to do anything to help my poor mother--your own sister,--if you've no feeling
for her when she's in trouble, and won't part with anything, though you would never miss it,
to save her from pain? Keep away from us then, and don't come to find fault with my father,--he
was better than any of you; he was kind,--he would have helped you, if you had been in trouble.
Tom and I don't ever want to have any of your money, if you won't help my mother. We'd rather
not have it! We'll do without you."

Maggie, having hurled her defiance at aunts and uncles in this way, stood still, with her large
dark eyes glaring at them, as if she were ready to await all consequences.

Mrs. Tulliver was frightened; there was something portentous in this mad outbreak; she did
not see how life could go on after it. Tom was vexed; it was no use to talk so. The aunts were
silent with surprise for some moments. At length, in a case of aberration such as this, comment
presented itself as more expedient than any answer.

"You haven't seen the end o' your trouble wi' that child, Bessy," said Mrs. Pullet; "she's
beyond everything for boldness and unthankfulness. It's dreadful. I might ha' let alone paying
for her schooling, for she's worse nor ever."

"It's no more than what I've allays said," followed Mrs. Glegg. "Other folks may be surprised,
but I'm not. I've said over and over again,--years ago I've said,--'Mark my words; that child
'ull come to no good; there isn't a bit of our family in her.' And as for her having so much
schooling, I never thought well o' that. I'd my reasons when I said I wouldn't pay anything
toward it."

"Come, come," said Mr. Glegg, "let's waste no more time in talking,--let's go to business.
Tom, now, get the pen and ink----"

While Mr. Glegg was speaking, a tall dark figure was seen hurrying past the window.

"Why, there's Mrs. Moss," said Mrs. Tulliver. "The bad news must ha' reached her, then"; and
she went out to open the door, Maggie eagerly following her.

"That's fortunate," said Mrs. Glegg. "She can agree to the list o' things to be bought in.
It's but right she should do her share when it's her own brother."

Mrs. Moss was in too much agitation to resist Mrs. Tulliver's movement, as she drew her into
the parlor automatically, without reflecting that it was hardly kind to take her among so many
persons in the first painful moment of arrival. The tall, worn, dark-haired woman was a strong
contrast to the Dodson sisters as she entered in her shabby dress, with her shawl and bonnet
looking as if they had been hastily huddled on, and with that entire absence of self-consciousness
which belongs to keenly felt trouble. Maggie was clinging to her arm; and Mrs. Moss seemed
to notice no one else except Tom, whom she went straight up to and took by the hand.

"Oh, my dear children," she burst out, "you've no call to think well o' me; I'm a poor aunt
to you, for I'm one o' them as take all and give nothing. How's my poor brother?"

"Mr. Turnbull thinks he'll get better," said Maggie. "Sit down, aunt Gritty. Don't fret."

"Oh, my sweet child, I feel torn i' two," said Mrs. Moss, allowing Maggie to lead her to the
sofa, but still not seeming to notice the presence of the rest. "We've three hundred pounds
o' my brother's money, and now he wants it, and you all want it, poor things!--and yet we must
be sold up to pay it, and there's my poor children,--eight of 'em, and the little un of all
can't speak plain. And I feel as if I was a robber. But I'm sure I'd no thought as my brother----"

The poor woman was interrupted by a rising sob.

"Three hundred pounds! oh dear, dear," said Mrs. Tulliver, who, when she had said that her
husband had done "unknown" things for his sister, had not had any particular sum in her mind,
and felt a wife's irritation at having been kept in the dark.

"What madness, to be sure!" said Mrs. Glegg. "A man with a family! He'd no right to lend his
money i' that way; and without security, I'll be bound, if the truth was known."

Mrs. Glegg's voice had arrested Mrs. Moss's attention, and looking up, she said:

"Yes, there was security; my husband gave a note for it. We're not that sort o' people, neither
of us, as 'ud rob my brother's children; and we looked to paying back the money, when the times
got a bit better."

"Well, but now," said Mr. Glegg, gently, "hasn't your husband no way o' raising this money?
Because it 'ud be a little fortin, like, for these folks, if we can do without Tulliver's being
made a bankrupt. Your husband's got stock; it is but right he should raise the money, as it
seems to me,--not but what I'm sorry for you, Mrs. Moss."

"Oh, sir, you don't know what bad luck my husband's had with his stock. The farm's suffering
so as never was for want o' stock; and we've sold all the wheat, and we're behind with our
rent,--not but what we'd like to do what's right, and I'd sit up and work half the night, if
it 'ud be any good; but there's them poor children,--four of 'em such little uns----"

"Don't cry so, aunt; don't fret," whispered Maggie, who had kept hold of Mrs. Moss's hand.

"Did Mr. Tulliver let you have the money all at once?" said Mrs. Tulliver, still lost in the
conception of things which had been "going on" without her knowledge.

"No; at twice," said Mrs. Moss, rubbing her eyes and making an effort to restrain her tears.
"The last was after my bad illness four years ago, as everything went wrong, and there was
a new note made then. What with illness and bad luck, I've been nothing but cumber all my life."

"Yes, Mrs. Moss," said Mrs. Glegg, with decision, "yours is a very unlucky family; the more's
the pity for my sister."

"I set off in the cart as soon as ever I heard o' what had happened," said Mrs. Moss, looking
at Mrs. Tulliver. "I should never ha' stayed away all this while, if you'd thought well to
let me know. And it isn't as I'm thinking all about ourselves, and nothing about my brother,
only the money was so on my mind, I couldn't help speaking about it. And my husband and me
desire to do the right thing, sir," she added, looking at Mr. Glegg, "and we'll make shift
and pay the money, come what will, if that's all my brother's got to trust to. We've been used
to trouble, and don't look for much else. It's only the thought o' my poor children pulls me
i' two."

"Why, there's this to be thought on, Mrs. Moss," said Mr. Glegg, "and it's right to warn you,--if
Tulliver's made a bankrupt, and he's got a note-of-hand of your husband's for three hundred
pounds, you'll be obliged to pay it; th' assignees 'ull come on you for it."

"Oh dear, oh dear!" said Mrs. Tulliver, thinking of the bankruptcy, and not of Mrs. Moss's
concern in it. Poor Mrs. Moss herself listened in trembling submission, while Maggie looked
with bewildered distress at Tom to see if he showed any signs of understanding this trouble,
and caring about poor aunt Moss. Tom was only looking thoughtful, with his eyes on the tablecloth.

"And if he isn't made bankrupt," continued Mr. Glegg, "as I said before, three hundred pounds
'ud be a little fortin for him, poor man. We don't know but what he may be partly helpless,
if he ever gets up again. I'm very sorry if it goes hard with you, Mrs. Moss, but my opinion
is, looking at it one way, it'll be right for you to raise the money; and looking at it th'
other way, you'll be obliged to pay it. You won't think ill o' me for speaking the truth."

"Uncle," said Tom, looking up suddenly from his meditative view of the tablecloth, "I don't
think it would be right for my aunt Moss to pay the money if it would be against my father's
will for her to pay it; would it?"

Mr. Glegg looked surprised for a moment or two before he said: "Why, no, perhaps not, Tom;
but then he'd ha' destroyed the note, you know. We must look for the note. What makes you think
it 'ud be against his will?"

"Why," said Tom, coloring, but trying to speak firmly, in spite of a boyish tremor, "I remember
quite well, before I went to school to Mr. Stelling, my father said to me one night, when we
were sitting by the fire together, and no one else was in the room----"

Tom hesitated a little, and then went on.

"He said something to me about Maggie, and then he said: 'I've always been good to my sister,
though she married against my will, and I've lent Moss money; but I shall never think of distressing
him to pay it; I'd rather lose it. My children must not mind being the poorer for that.' And
now my father's ill, and not able to speak for himself, I shouldn't like anything to be done
contrary to what he said to me."

"Well, but then, my boy," said Uncle Glegg, whose good feeling led him to enter into Tom's
wish, but who could not at once shake off his habitual abhorrence of such recklessness as destroying
securities, or alienating anything important enough to make an appreciable difference in a
man's property, "we should have to make away wi' the note, you know, if we're to guard against
what may happen, supposing your father's made bankrupt----"

"Mr. Glegg," interrupted his wife, severely, "mind what you're saying. You're putting yourself
very forrard in other folks's business. If you speak rash, don't say it was my fault."

"That's such a thing as I never heared of before," said uncle Pullet, who had been making haste
with his lozenge in order to express his amazement,--"making away with a note! I should think
anybody could set the constable on you for it."

"Well, but," said Mrs. Tulliver, "if the note's worth all that money, why can't we pay it away,
and save my things from going away? We've no call to meddle with your uncle and aunt Moss,
Tom, if you think your father 'ud be angry when he gets well."

Mrs. Tulliver had not studied the question of exchange, and was straining her mind after original
ideas on the subject.

"Pooh, pooh, pooh! you women don't understand these things," said uncle Glegg. "There's no
way o' making it safe for Mr. and Mrs. Moss but destroying the note."

"Then I hope you'll help me do it, uncle," said Tom, earnestly. "If my father shouldn't get
well, I should be very unhappy to think anything had been done against his will that I could
hinder. And I'm sure he meant me to remember what he said that evening. I ought to obey my
father's wish about his property."

Even Mrs. Glegg could not withhold her approval from Tom's words; she felt that the Dodson
blood was certainly speaking in him, though, if his father had been a Dodson, there would never
have been this wicked alienation of money. Maggie would hardly have restrained herself from
leaping on Tom's neck, if her aunt Moss had not prevented her by herself rising and taking
Tom's hand, while she said, with rather a choked voice:

"You'll never be the poorer for this, my dear boy, if there's a God above; and if the money's
wanted for your father, Moss and me 'ull pay it, the same as if there was ever such security.
We'll do as we'd be done by; for if my children have got no other luck, they've got an honest
father and mother."

"Well," said Mr. Glegg, who had been meditating after Tom's words, "we shouldn't be doing any
wrong by the creditors, supposing your father was bankrupt. I've been thinking o' that, for
I've been a creditor myself, and seen no end o' cheating. If he meant to give your aunt the
money before ever he got into this sad work o' lawing, it's the same as if he'd made away with
the note himself; for he'd made up his mind to be that much poorer. But there's a deal o' things
to be considered, young man," Mr. Glegg added, looking admonishingly at Tom, "when you come
to money business, and you may be taking one man's dinner away to make another man's breakfast.
You don't understand that, I doubt?"

"Yes, I do," said Tom, decidedly. "I know if I owe money to one man, I've no right to give
it to another. But if my father had made up his mind to give my aunt the money before he was
in debt, he had a right to do it."

"Well done, young man! I didn't think you'd been so sharp," said uncle Glegg, with much candor.
"But perhaps your father did make away with the note. Let us go and see if we can find it in
the chest."

"It's in my father's room. Let us go too, aunt Gritty," whispered Maggie.

Chapter IV

A Vanishing Gleam

Mr. Tulliver, even between the fits of spasmodic rigidity which had recurred at intervals ever
since he had been found fallen from his horse, was usually in so apathetic a condition that
the exits and entrances into his room were not felt to be of great importance. He had lain
so still, with his eyes closed, all this morning, that Maggie told her aunt Moss she must not
expect her father to take any notice of them.

They entered very quietly, and Mrs. Moss took her seat near the head of the bed, while Maggie
sat in her old place on the bed, and put her hand on her father's without causing any change
in his face.

Mr. Glegg and Tom had also entered, treading softly, and were busy selecting the key of the
old oak chest from the bunch which Tom had brought from his father's bureau. They succeeded
in opening the chest,--which stood opposite the foot of Mr. Tulliver's bed,--and propping the
lid with the iron holder, without much noise.

"There's a tin box," whispered Mr. Glegg; "he'd most like put a small thing like a note in
there. Lift it out, Tom; but I'll just lift up these deeds,--they're the deeds o' the house
and mill, I suppose,--and see what there is under 'em."

Mr. Glegg had lifted out the parchments, and had fortunately drawn back a little, when the
iron holder gave way, and the heavy lid fell with a loud bang that resounded over the house.

Perhaps there was something in that sound more than the mere fact of the strong vibration that
produced the instantaneous effect on the frame of the prostrate man, and for the time completely
shook off the obstruction of paralysis. The chest had belonged to his father and his father's
father, and it had always been rather a solemn business to visit it. All long-known objects,
even a mere window fastening or a particular door-latch, have sounds which are a sort of recognized
voice to us,--a voice that will thrill and awaken, when it has been used to touch deep-lying
fibres. In the same moment, when all the eyes in the room were turned upon him, he started
up and looked at the chest, the parchments in Mr. Glegg's hand, and Tom holding the tin box,
with a glance of perfect consciousness and recognition.

"What are you going to do with those deeds?" he said, in his ordinary tone of sharp questioning
whenever he was irritated. "Come here, Tom. What do you do, going to my chest?"

Tom obeyed, with some trembling; it was the first time his father had recognized him. But instead
of saying anything more to him, his father continued to look with a growing distinctness of
suspicion at Mr. Glegg and the deeds.

"What's been happening, then?" he said sharply. "What are you meddling with my deeds for? Is
Wakem laying hold of everything? Why don't you tell me what you've been a-doing?" he added
impatiently, as Mr. Glegg advanced to the foot of the bed before speaking.

"No, no, friend Tulliver," said Mr. Glegg, in a soothing tone. "Nobody's getting hold of anything
as yet. We only came to look and see what was in the chest. You've been ill, you know, and
we've had to look after things a bit. But let's hope you'll soon be well enough to attend to
everything yourself."

Mr. Tulliver looked around him meditatively, at Tom, at Mr. Glegg, and at Maggie; then suddenly
appearing aware that some one was seated by his side at the head of the bed he turned sharply
round and saw his sister.

"Eh, Gritty!" he said, in the half-sad, affectionate tone in which he had been wont to speak
to her. "What! you're there, are you? How could you manage to leave the children?"

"Oh, brother!" said good Mrs. Moss, too impulsive to be prudent, "I'm thankful I'm come now
to see you yourself again; I thought you'd never know us any more."

"What! have I had a stroke?" said Mr. Tulliver, anxiously, looking at Mr. Glegg.

"A fall from your horse--shook you a bit,--that's all, I think," said Mr. Glegg. "But you'll
soon get over it, let's hope."

Mr. Tulliver fixed his eyes on the bed-clothes, and remained silent for two or three minutes.
A new shadow came over his face. He looked up at Maggie first, and said in a lower tone, "You
got the letter, then, my wench?"

"Yes, father," she said, kissing him with a full heart. She felt as if her father were come
back to her from the dead, and her yearning to show him how she had always loved him could
be fulfilled.

"Where's your mother?" he said, so preoccupied that he received the kiss as passively as some
quiet animal might have received it.

"She's downstairs with my aunts, father. Shall I fetch her?"

"Ay, ay; poor Bessy!" and his eyes turned toward Tom as Maggie left the room.

"You'll have to take care of 'em both if I die, you know, Tom. You'll be badly off, I doubt.
But you must see and pay everybody. And mind,--there's fifty pound o' Luke's as I put into
the business,--he gave me a bit at a time, and he's got nothing to show for it. You must pay
him first thing."

Uncle Glegg involuntarily shook his head, and looked more concerned than ever, but Tom said firmly:

"Yes, father. And haven't you a note from my uncle Moss for three hundred pounds? We came to
look for that. What do you wish to be done about it, father?"

"Ah! I'm glad you thought o' that, my lad," said Mr. Tulliver. "I allays meant to be easy about
that money, because o' your aunt. You mustn't mind losing the money, if they can't pay it,--and
it's like enough they can't. The note's in that box, mind! I allays meant to be good to you,
Gritty," said Mr. Tulliver, turning to his sister; "but you know you aggravated me when you
would have Moss."

At this moment Maggie re-entered with her mother, who came in much agitated by the news that
her husband was quite himself again.

"Well, Bessy," he said, as she kissed him, "you must forgive me if you're worse off than you
ever expected to be. But it's the fault o' the law,--it's none o' mine," he added angrily.
"It's the fault o' raskills. Tom, you mind this: if ever you've got the chance, you make Wakem
smart. If you don't, you're a good-for-nothing son. You might horse-whip him, but he'd set
the law on you,--the law's made to take care o' raskills."

Mr. Tulliver was getting excited, and an alarming flush was on his face. Mr. Glegg wanted to
say something soothing, but he was prevented by Mr. Tulliver's speaking again to his wife.
"They'll make a shift to pay everything, Bessy," he said, "and yet leave you your furniture;
and your sisters'll do something for you--and Tom'll grow up--though what he's to be I don't
know--I've done what I could--I've given him a eddication--and there's the little wench, she'll
get married--but it's a poor tale----"

The sanative effect of the strong vibration was exhausted, and with the last words the poor
man fell again, rigid and insensible. Though this was only a recurrence of what had happened
before, it struck all present as if it had been death, not only from its contrast with the
completeness of the revival, but because his words had all had reference to the possibility
that his death was near. But with poor Tulliver death was not to be a leap; it was to be a
long descent under thickening shadows.

Mr. Turnbull was sent for; but when he heard what had passed, he said this complete restoration,
though only temporary, was a hopeful sign, proving that there was no permanent lesion to prevent
ultimate recovery.

Among the threads of the past which the stricken man had gathered up, he had omitted the bill
of sale; the flash of memory had only lit up prominent ideas, and he sank into forgetfulness
again with half his humiliation unlearned.

But Tom was clear upon two points,--that his uncle Moss's note must be destroyed; and that
Luke's money must be paid, if in no other way, out of his own and Maggie's money now in the
savings bank. There were subjects, you perceive, on which Tom was much quicker than on the
niceties of classical construction, or the relations of a mathematical demonstration.

Chapter V

Tom Applies His Knife to the Oyster

The next day, at ten o'clock, Tom was on his way to St. Ogg's, to see his uncle Deane, who
was to come home last night, his aunt had said; and Tom had made up his mind that his uncle
Deane was the right person to ask for advice about getting some employment. He was in a great
way of business; he had not the narrow notions of uncle Glegg; and he had risen in the world
on a scale of advancement which accorded with Tom's ambition.

It was a dark, chill, misty morning, likely to end in rain,--one of those mornings when even
happy people take refuge in their hopes. And Tom was very unhappy; he felt the humiliation
as well as the prospective hardships of his lot with all the keenness of a proud nature; and
with all his resolute dutifulness toward his father there mingled an irrepressible indignation
against him which gave misfortune the less endurable aspect of a wrong. Since these were the
consequences of going to law, his father was really blamable, as his aunts and uncles had always
said he was; and it was a significant indication of Tom's character, that though he thought
his aunts ought to do something more for his mother, he felt nothing like Maggie's violent
resentment against them for showing no eager tenderness and generosity. There were no impulses
in Tom that led him to expect what did not present itself to him as a right to be demanded.
Why should people give away their money plentifully to those who had not taken care of their
own money? Tom saw some justice in severity; and all the more, because he had confidence in
himself that he should never deserve that just severity. It was very hard upon him that he
should be put at this disadvantage in life by his father's want of prudence; but he was not
going to complain and to find fault with people because they did not make everything easy for
him. He would ask no one to help him, more than to give him work and pay him for it. Poor Tom
was not without his hopes to take refuge in under the chill damp imprisonment of the December
fog, which seemed only like a part of his home troubles. At sixteen, the mind that has the
strongest affinity for fact cannot escape illusion and self-flattery; and Tom, in sketching
his future, had no other guide in arranging his facts than the suggestions of his own brave
self-reliance. Both Mr. Glegg and Mr. Deane, he knew, had been very poor once; he did not want
to save money slowly and retire on a moderate fortune like his uncle Glegg, but he would be
like his uncle Deane--get a situation in some great house of business and rise fast. He had
scarcely seen anything of his uncle Deane for the last three years--the two families had been
getting wider apart; but for this very reason Tom was the more hopeful about applying to him.
His uncle Glegg, he felt sure, would never encourage any spirited project, but he had a vague
imposing idea of the resources at his uncle Deane's command. He had heard his father say, long
ago, how Deane had made himself so valuable to Guest & Co. that they were glad enough to offer
him a share in the business; that was what Tom resolved he would do. It was intolerable to
think of being poor and looked down upon all one's life. He would provide for his mother and
sister, and make every one say that he was a man of high character. He leaped over the years
in this way, and, in the haste of strong purpose and strong desire, did not see how they would
be made up of slow days, hours, and minutes.

By the time he had crossed the stone bridge over the Floss and was entering St. Ogg's, he was
thinking that he would buy his father's mill and land again when he was rich enough, and improve
the house and live there; he should prefer it to any smarter, newer place, and he could keep
as many horses and dogs as he liked.

Walking along the street with a firm, rapid step, at this point in his reverie he was startled
by some one who had crossed without his notice, and who said to him in a rough, familiar voice:

"Why, Master Tom, how's your father this morning?" It was a publican of St. Ogg's, one of his
father's customers.

Tom disliked being spoken to just then; but he said civilly, "He's still very ill, thank you."

"Ay, it's been a sore chance for you, young man, hasn't it,--this lawsuit turning out against
him?" said the publican, with a confused, beery idea of being good-natured.

Tom reddened and passed on; he would have felt it like the handling of a bruise, even if there
had been the most polite and delicate reference to his position.

"That's Tulliver's son," said the publican to a grocer standing on the adjacent door-step.

"Ah!" said the grocer, "I thought I knew his features. He takes after his mother's family;
she was a Dodson. He's a fine, straight youth; what's he been brought up to?"

"Oh! to turn up his nose at his father's customers, and be a fine gentleman,--not much else,
I think."

Tom, roused from his dream of the future to a thorough consciousness of the present, made all
the greater haste to reach the warehouse offices of Guest & Co., where he expected to find
his uncle Deane. But this was Mr. Deane's morning at the band, a clerk told him, and with some
contempt for his ignorance; Mr. Deane was not to be found in River Street on a Thursday morning.

At the bank Tom was admitted into the private room where his uncle was, immediately after sending
in his name. Mr. Deane was auditing accounts; but he looked up as Tom entered, and putting
out his hand, said, "Well, Tom, nothing fresh the matter at home, I hope? How's your father?"

"Much the same, thank you, uncle," said Tom, feeling nervous. "But I want to speak to you,
please, when you're at liberty."

"Sit down, sit down," said Mr. Deane, relapsing into his accounts, in which he and the managing-clerk
remained so absorbed for the next half-hour that Tom began to wonder whether he should have
to sit in this way till the bank closed,--there seemed so little tendency toward a conclusion
in the quiet, monotonous procedure of these sleek, prosperous men of business. Would his uncle
give him a place in the bank? It would be very dull, prosy work, he thought, writing there
forever to the loud ticking of a timepiece. He preferred some other way of getting rich. But
at last there was a change; his uncle took a pen and wrote something with a flourish at the end.

"You'll just step up to Torry's now, Mr. Spence, will you?" said Mr. Deane, and the clock suddenly
became less loud and deliberate in Tom's ears.

"Well, Tom," said Mr. Deane, when they were alone, turning his substantial person a little
in his chair, and taking out his snuff-box; "what's the business, my boy; what's the business?"
Mr. Deane, who had heard from his wife what had passed the day before, thought Tom was come
to appeal to him for some means of averting the sale.

"I hope you'll excuse me for troubling you, uncle," said Tom, coloring, but speaking in a tone
which, though, tremulous, had a certain proud independence in it; "but I thought you were the
best person to advise me what to do."

"Ah!" said Mr. Deane, reserving his pinch of snuff, and looking at Tom with new attention,
"let us hear."

"I want to get a situation, uncle, so that I may earn some money," said Tom, who never fell
into circumlocution.

"A situation?" said Mr. Deane, and then took his pinch of snuff with elaborate justice to each
nostril. Tom thought snuff-taking a most provoking habit.

"Why, let me see, how old are you?" said Mr. Deane, as he threw himself backward again.

"Sixteen; I mean, I am going in seventeen," said Tom, hoping his uncle noticed how much beard
he had.

"Let me see; your father had some notion of making you an engineer, I think?"

"But I don't think I could get any money at that for a long while, could I?"

"That's true; but people don't get much money at anything, my boy, when they're only sixteen.
You've had a good deal of schooling, however; I suppose you're pretty well up in accounts,
eh? You understand book keeping?"

"No," said Tom, rather falteringly. "I was in Practice. But Mr. Stelling says I write a good
hand, uncle. That's my writing," added Tom, laying on the table a copy of the list he had made
yesterday.

"Ah! that's good, that's good. But, you see, the best hand in the world'll not get you a better
place than a copying-clerk's, if you know nothing of book-keeping,--nothing of accounts. And
a copying-clerk's a cheap article. But what have you been learning at school, then?"

Mr. Deane had not occupied himself with methods of education, and had no precise conception
of what went forward in expensive schools.

"We learned Latin," said Tom, pausing a little between each item, as if he were turning over
the books in his school-desk to assist his memory,--"a good deal of Latin; and the last year
I did Themes, one week in Latin and one in English; and Greek and Roman history; and Euclid;
and I began Algebra, but I left it off again; and we had one day every week for Arithmetic.
Then I used to have drawing-lessons; and there were several other books we either read or learned
out of,--English Poetry, and Horæ Pauliné and Blair's Rhetoric, the last half."

Mr. Deane tapped his snuff-box again and screwed up his mouth; he felt in the position of many
estimable persons when they had read the New Tariff, and found how many commodities were imported
of which they knew nothing; like a cautious man of business, he was not going to speak rashly
of a raw material in which he had had no experience. But the presumption was, that if it had
been good for anything, so successful a man as himself would hardly have been ignorant of it.

About Latin he had an opinion, and thought that in case of another war, since people would
no longer wear hair-powder, it would be well to put a tax upon Latin, as a luxury much run
upon by the higher classes, and not telling at all on the ship-owning department. But, for
what he knew, the Horé Pauliné might be something less neutral. On the whole, this list of
acquirements gave him a sort of repulsion toward poor Tom.

"Well," he said at last, in rather a cold, sardonic tone, "you've had three years at these
things,--you must be pretty strong in 'em. Hadn't you better take up some line where they'll
come in handy?"

Tom colored, and burst out, with new energy:

"I'd rather not have any employment of that sort, uncle. I don't like Latin and those things.
I don't know what I could do with them unless I went as usher in a school; and I don't know
them well enough for that! besides, I would as soon carry a pair of panniers. I don't want
to be that sort of person. I should like to enter into some business where I can get on,--a
manly business, where I should have to look after things, and get credit for what I did. And
I shall want to keep my mother and sister."

"Ah, young gentleman," said Mr. Deane, with that tendency to repress youthful hopes which stout
and successful men of fifty find one of their easiest duties, "that's sooner said than done,--sooner
said than done."

"But didn't you get on in that way, uncle?" said Tom, a little irritated that Mr. Deane did
not enter more rapidly into his views. "I mean, didn't you rise from one place to another through
your abilities and good conduct?"

"Ay, ay, sir," said Mr. Deane, spreading himself in his chair a little, and entering with great
readiness into a retrospect of his own career. "But I'll tell you how I got on. It wasn't by
getting astride a stick and thinking it would turn into a horse if I sat on it long enough.
I kept my eyes and ears open, sir, and I wasn't too fond of my own back, and I made my master's
interest my own. Why, with only looking into what went on in the mill,, I found out how there
was a waste of five hundred a-year that might be hindered. Why, sir, I hadn't more schooling
to begin with than a charity boy; but I saw pretty soon that I couldn't get on far enough without
mastering accounts, and I learned 'em between working hours, after I'd been unlading. Look
here." Mr. Deane opened a book and pointed to the page. "I write a good hand enough, and I'll
match anybody at all sorts of reckoning by the head; and I got it all by hard work, and paid
for it out of my own earnings,--often out of my own dinner and supper. And I looked into the
nature of all the things we had to do in the business, and picked up knowledge as I went about
my work, and turned it over in my head. Why, I'm no mechanic,--I never pretended to be--but
I've thought of a thing or two that the mechanics never thought of, and it's made a fine difference
in our returns. And there isn't an article shipped or unshipped at our wharf but I know the
quality of it. If I got places, sir, it was because I made myself fit for 'em. If you want
to slip into a round hole, you must make a ball of yourself; that's where it is."

Mr. Deane tapped his box again. He had been led on by pure enthusiasm in his subject, and had
really forgotten what bearing this retrospective survey had on his listener. He had found occasion
for saying the same thing more than once before, and was not distinctly aware that he had not
his port-wine before him.

"Well, uncle," said Tom, with a slight complaint in his tone, "that's what I should like to
do. Can't I get on in the same way?"

"In the same way?" said Mr. Deane, eyeing Tom with quiet deliberation. "There go two or three
questions to that, Master Tom. That depends on what sort of material you are, to begin with,
and whether you've been put into the right mill. But I'll tell you what it is. Your poor father
went the wrong way to work in giving you an education. It wasn't my business, and I didn't
interfere; but it is as I thought it would be. You've had a sort of learning that's all very
well for a young fellow like our Mr. Stephen Guest, who'll have nothing to do but sign checks
all his life, and may as well have Latin inside his head as any other sort of stuffing."

"But, uncle," said Tom, earnestly, "I don't see why the Latin need hinder me from getting on
in business. I shall soon forget it all; it makes no difference to me. I had to do my lessons
at school, but I always thought they'd never be of any use to me afterward; I didn't care about
them."

"Ay, ay, that's all very well," said Mr. Deane; "but it doesn't alter what I was going to say.
Your Latin and rigmarole may soon dry off you, but you'll be but a bare stick after that. Besides,
it's whitened your hands and taken the rough work out of you. And what do you know? Why, you
know nothing about book-keeping, to begin with, and not so much of reckoning as a common shopman.
You'll have to begin at a low round of the ladder, let me tell you, if you mean to get on in
life. It's no use forgetting the education your father's been paying for, if you don't give
yourself a new un."

Tom bit his lips hard; he felt as if the tears were rising, and he would rather die than let them.

"You want me to help you to a situation," Mr. Deane went on; "well, I've no fault to find with
that. I'm willing to do something for you. But you youngsters nowadays think you're to begin
with living well and working easy; you've no notion of running afoot before you get horseback.
Now, you must remember what you are,--you're a lad of sixteen, trained to nothing particular.
There's heaps of your sort, like so many pebbles, made to fit in nowhere. Well, you might be
apprenticed to some business,--a chemist's and druggist's perhaps; your Latin might come in
a bit there----"

Tom was going to speak, but Mr. Deane put up his hand and said:

"Stop! hear what I've got to say. You don't want to be a 'prentice,--I know, I know,--you want
to make more haste, and you don't want to stand behind a counter. But if you're a copying-clerk,
you'll have to stand behind a desk, and stare at your ink and paper all day; there isn't much
out-look there, and you won't be much wiser at the end of the year than at the beginning. The
world isn't made of pen, ink, and paper, and if you're to get on in the world, young man, you
must know what the world's made of. Now the best chance for you 'ud be to have a place on a
wharf, or in a warehouse, where you'd learn the smell of things, but you wouldn't like that,
I'll be bound; you'd have to stand cold and wet, and be shouldered about by rough fellows.
You're too fine a gentleman for that."

Mr. Deane paused and looked hard at Tom, who certainly felt some inward struggle before he
could reply.

"I would rather do what will be best for me in the end, sir; I would put up with what was disagreeable."

"That's well, if you can carry it out. But you must remember it isn't only laying hold of a
rope, you must go on pulling. It's the mistake you lads make that have got nothing either in
your brains or your pocket, to think you've got a better start in the world if you stick yourselves
in a place where you can keep your coats clean, and have the shopwenches take you for fine
gentlemen. That wasn't the way I started, young man; when I was sixteen, my jacket smelt of
tar, and I wasn't afraid of handling cheeses. That's the reason I can wear good broadcloth
now, and have my legs under the same table with the head of the best firms in St. Ogg's."

Uncle Deane tapped his box, and seemed to expand a little under his waistcoat and gold chain,
as he squared his shoulders in the chair.

"Is there any place at liberty that you know of now, uncle, that I should do for? I should
like to set to work at once," said Tom, with a slight tremor in his voice.

"Stop a bit, stop a bit; we mustn't be in too great a hurry. You must bear in mind, if I put
you in a place you're a bit young for, because you happen to be my nephew, I shall be responsible
for you. And there's no better reason, you know, than your being my nephew; because it remains
to be seen whether you're good for anything."

"I hope I shall never do you any discredit, uncle," said Tom, hurt, as all boys are at the
statement of the unpleasant truth that people feel no ground for trusting them. "I care about
my own credit too much for that."

"Well done, Tom, well done! That's the right spirit, and I never refuse to help anybody if
they've a mind to do themselves justice. There's a young man of two-and-twenty I've got my
eye on now. I shall do what I can for that young man; he's got some pith in him. But then,
you see, he's made good use of his time,--a first-rate calculator,-- can tell you the cubic
contents of anything in no time, and put me up the other day to a new market for Swedish bark;
he's uncommonly knowing in manufactures, that young fellow."

"I'd better set about learning book-keeping, hadn't I, uncle?" said Tom, anxious to prove his
readiness to exert himself.

"Yes, yes, you can't do amiss there. But--Ah, Spence, you're back again. Well Tom, there's
nothing more to be said just now, I think, and I must go to business again. Good-by. Remember
me to your mother."

Mr. Deane put out his hand, with an air of friendly dismissal, and Tom had not courage to ask
another question, especially in the presence of Mr. Spence. So he went out again into the cold
damp air. He had to call at his uncle Glegg's about the money in the Savings Bank, and by the
time he set out again the mist had thickened, and he could not see very far before him; but
going along River Street again, he was startled, when he was within two yards of the projecting
side of a shop-window, by the words "Dorlcote Mill" in large letters on a hand-bill, placed
as if on purpose to stare at him. It was the catalogue of the sale to take place the next week;
it was a reason for hurrying faster out of the town.

Poor Tom formed no visions of the distant future as he made his way homeward; he only felt
that the present was very hard. Sometimes it comes from bad shoeing. Some people like it. I don't myself."
After a while he added, "If you can get this mare for a hundred and twenty-five, you'd better buy
her."

"Well, I will," said my friend. He would have bought her, in fact, if she had clicked like a
noiseless sewing-machine. But the owner, remote as Medford, and invisibly dealing, as usual, through
a third person, would not sell her for one and a quarter; he wanted one and a half. Besides, another
Party was trying to get her; and now ensued a negotiation which for intricacy and mystery surpassed
all the others. It was conducted in my friend's interest by one who had the difficult task of keeping
the owner's imagination in check and his demands within bounds, for it soon appeared that he
wanted even more than one and a half for her. Unseen and inaccessible,
he grew every day more unmanageable.

He entered into relations with the other Party, and it all ended in his sending her out one
day after my friend had gone into the country, and requiring him to say at once that he would
give one and a half. He was not at home, and he never saw the little mare again. This confirmed
him in the belief that she was the very horse he ought to have had.

People had now begun to say to him, "Why don't you advertise? Advertise for a gentleman's pony-horse
and phaeton and harness complete. You'll have a perfect procession
of them before night."

This proved true. His advertisement, mystically worded after the fashion of those things, found
abundant response.

But the establishments which he would have taken he could not get
at the figure he had set, and those which his money would buy he would
not have.

They came at all hours of the day; and he never returned home after an an absence without meeting
the reproach that now the very horse he wanted had just been driven away, and would not be brought
back, as his owner lived in Billerica, and only happened to be down. A few equipages really
appeared desirable, but in regard to these his jaded faculties refused to work: he could decide
nothing; his volition was extinct; he let them come and go.

It was at this period that people who had at first been surprised that he wished to buy a horse
came to believe that he had bought one, and were astonished to learn
that he had not.

He felt the pressure of public opinion.

He began to haunt the different sale-stables in town, and to look at horses with a view to buying
at private sale. Every facility for testing them was offered him, but he could not make up his
mind. In feeble wantonness he gave appointments which he knew he should not keep, and, passing
his days in an agony of multitudinous indecision, he added to the lies in the world the hideous
sum of his broken engagements. From time to time he forlornly appeared at the Chevaliers',
and refreshed his corrupted nature by contact with their sterling
integrity.

Once he ventured into their establishment just before an auction began, and remained dazzled
by the splendor of a spectacle which I fancy can be paralleled only by some dream of a mediæval
tournament. The horses, brilliantly harnessed, accurately shod, and standing tall on burnished hooves,
their necks curved by the check rein and their black and blonde manes flowing over the proud
arch, lustrous and wrinkled like satin, were ranged in a glittering hemicycle. They affected
my friend like the youth and beauty of his earliest evening parties;
he experienced a sense of bashfulness, of sickening personal demerit.

He could not have had the audacity to bid on one of those superb creatures, if all the Chevaliers
together had whispered him that here at last was the very horse.

I pass over an unprofitable interval in which he abandoned himself
to despair, and really gave up the hope of being able ever to buy
a horse.

During this interval he removed from Charlesbridge to the country, and found himself, to his
self-scorn and self-pity, actually reduced to hiring a livery horse
by the day.

But relief was at hand. The carpenter who had remained to finish up the new house after my friend
had gone into it bethought himself of a firm in his place who brought on horses from the West,
and had the practice of selling a horse on trial, and constantly replacing it with other horses
till the purchaser was suited. This seemed an ideal arrangement, and the carpenter said that he
thought they had the very horse my friend wanted.

The next day he drove him up, and upon the plan of successive exchanges till the perfect horse was
reached, my friend bought him for one and a quarter, the figure which he had kept in mind from
the first. He bought a phaeton and harness from the same people, and when the whole equipage
stood at his door, he felt the long-delayed thrill of pride and satisfaction. The horse was
of the Morgan breed, a bright bay, small and round and neat, with a little head tossed high,
and a gentle yet alert movement. He was in the prime of youth, of the age of which every horse
desires to be, and was just coming seven.

My friend had already taken him to a horse-doctor, who for one dollar had gone all over him,
and pronounced him sound as a fish, and complimented his new owner upon his acquisition. It
all seemed too good to be true. As Billy turned his soft eye on the admiring family group,
and suffered one of the children to smooth his nose while another held a lump of sugar to his
dainty lips, his amiable behavior restored my friend to his peace of mind and his long-lost
faith in a world of reason.

The ridiculous planet, wavering bat-like through space, on which it had been impossible for an innocent
man to buy a suitable horse was a dream of the past, and he had the
solid, sensible old earth under his feet once more.

He mounted into the phaeton and drove off with his wife; he returned
and gave each of the children a drive in succession.

He told them that any of them could drive Billy as much as they liked,
and he quieted a clamor for exclusive ownership on the part of each
by declaring that Billy belonged to the whole family.

To this day he cannot look back to those moments without tenderness. If Billy had any apparent
fault, it was an amiable indolence. But this made him all the safer for the children, and it did
not really amount to laziness. While on sale he had been driven in a provision cart, and had
therefore the habit of standing unhitched. One had merely to fling the reins into the bottom
of the phaeton and leave Billy to his own custody. His other habit of drawing up at kitchen
gates was not confirmed, and the fact that he stumbled on his way to the doctor who pronounced
him blameless was reasonably attributed to a loose stone at the foot of the hill; the misstep
resulted in a barked shin, but a little wheel-grease, in a horse of Billy's complexion, easily
removed the evidence of this.

It was natural that after Billy was bought and paid for, several extremely
desirable horses should be offered to my friend by their owners, who
came in person, stripped of all the adventitious mystery of agents
and middle-men.

They were gentlemen, and they spoke the English habitual with persons not corrupted by horses.
My friend saw them come and go with grief; for he did not like to be shaken in his belief that Billy
was the only horse in the world for him, and he would have liked to purchase their animals,
if only to show his appreciation of honor and frankness and sane language. Yet he was consoled
by the possession of Billy, whom he found increasingly excellent and trustworthy. Any of the
family drove him about; he stood unhitched; he was not afraid of cars; he was as kind as a kitten;
he had not, as the neighboring coachman said, a voice, though he seemed a little loively in coming
out of the stable sometimes. He went well under the saddle; he was a beauty, and if he had a voice,
it was too great satisfaction in his personal appearance.

One evening after tea, the young gentleman, who was about to drive Billy out, stung by the reflection
that he had not taken blackberries and cream twice, ran into the house to repair the omission,
and left Billy, as usual, unhitched at the door. During his absence, Billy caught sight of his
stable, and involuntarily moved towards it. Finding himself unchecked, he gently increased his pace;
and when my friend, looking up from the melon-patch which he was admiring, called out, "Ho, Billy!
Whoa, Billy!" and headed him off from the gap, Billy profited by the circumstance to turn into
the pear orchard. The elastic turf under his unguided hoof seemed to exhilarate him; his pace became
a trot, a canter, a gallop, a tornado; the reins fluttered like ribbons in the air; the phaeton
flew ruining after. In a terrible cyclone the equipage swept round the neighbor's house, vanished,
reappeared, swooped down his lawn, and vanished again.

It was incredible.

My friend stood transfixed among his melons. He knew that his neighbor's children played under
the porte-cochère on the other side of the house which Billy had just surrounded in his flight,
and probably.... My friend's first impulse was not to go and see, but to walk into his own house,
and ignore the whole affair. But you cannot really ignore an affair of that kind. You must face
it, and commonly it stares you out of countenance. Commonly, too, it knows how to choose its
time so as to disgrace as well as crush its victim.

His neighbor had people to tea, and long before my friend reached the house the host and his
guests were all out on the lawn, having taken the precaution to bring their napkins with them.

"The children!" gasped my friend.

"Oh, they were all in bed," said the neighbor, and he began to laugh. That was right; my friend would
have mocked at the calamity if it had been his neighbor's. "Let us go and look up your phaeton."
He put his hand on the naked flank of a fine young elm, from which
the bark had just been stripped.

"Billy seems to have passed this way."

At the foot of a stone-wall four feet high lay the phaeton, with three wheels in the air, and
the fourth crushed flat against the axle; the willow back was broken, the shafts were pulled
out, and Billy was gone.

"Good thing there was nobody in it," said the neighbor.

"Good thing it didn't run down some Irish family, and get you in for damages," said a guest.

It
appeared, then, that there were two good things about this disaster. My friend had not thought
there were so many, but while he rejoiced in this fact, he rebelled
at the notion that a sorrow like that rendered the sufferer in any
event liable for damages, and he resolved that he never would have
paid them.

But probably he would.

Some half-grown boys got the phaeton right-side up, and restored its shafts and cushions, and it
limped away with them towards the carriage-house. Presently another half-grown boy came riding
Billy up the hill. Billy showed an inflated nostril and an excited eye, but physically he
was unharmed, save for a slight scratch on what was described as the off hind-leg; the reader
may choose which leg this was.

"The worst of it is," said the guest, "that you never can trust 'em after they've run off once."

"Have some tea?" said the host to my friend.

"No, thank you," said my friend, in whose heart the worst of it rankled; and he walked home
embittered by his guilty consciousness that Billy ought never to
have been left untied.

But it was not this self-reproach; it was not the mutilated phaeton; it was not the loss of
Billy, who must now be sold; it was the wreck of settled hopes, the renewed suspense of faith,
the repetition of the tragical farce of buying another horse, that most grieved my friend.

Billy's
former owners made a feint of supplying other horses in his place, but the only horse supplied
was an aged veteran with the scratches, who must have come seven early in our era, and who,
from his habit of getting about on tiptoe, must have been tender for'a'd beyond anything of
my friend's previous experience. Probably if he could have waited they might have replaced Billy
in time, but their next installment from the West produced nothing suited to his wants but
a horse with the presence and carriage of a pig, and he preferred to let them sell Billy for what
he would bring, and to trust his fate elsewhere. Billy had fallen nearly one half in value, and
he brought very little--to his owner; though the new purchaser was afterwards reported to value
him at much more than what my friend had paid for him. These things are really mysteries;
you cannot fathom them; it is idle to try. My friend remained grieving over his own folly and
carelessness, with a fond hankering for the poor little horse he had lost, and the belief
that he should never find such another.

Yet he was not without a philanthropist's consolation. He had added to the stock of harmless
pleasures in a degree of which he could not have dreamed. All his acquaintance knew that he had
bought a horse, and they all seemed now to conspire in asking him how he got on with it. He
was forced to confess the truth. On hearing it, his friends burst into shouts of laughter, and smote
their persons, and stayed themselves against lamp-posts and house-walls. They begged his pardon,
and then they began again, and shouted and roared anew.

Since the gale which blew down the poet ----'s chimneys and put him to the expense of rebuilding
them, no joke so generally satisfactory had been offered to the community.

My friend had, in his time, achieved the reputation of a wit by going about and and saying,
"Did you know ----'s chimneys had blown down?" and he had now himself
the pleasure of causing the like quality of wit in others.

Having abandoned the hope of getting anything out of the people who had sold him Billy, he was
for a time the prey of an inert despair, in which he had not even spirit to repine at the
disorder of a universe in which he could not find a horse. No horses were now offered to him,
for it had become known throughout the trade that he had bought a
horse.

He had therefore to set about counteracting this impression with what feeble powers were left
him. Of the facts of that period he remembers with confusion and remorse the trouble to which
he put the owner of the pony-horse Pansy, whom he visited repeatedly
in a neighboring town, at a loss of time and money to himself, and
with no result but to embarrass Pansy's owner in his relations with
people who had hired him and did not wish him sold.

Something of the old baffling mystery hung over Pansy's whereabouts; he was with difficulty produced,
and when en evidence he was not the Pansy my friend had expected.

He paltered with his regrets; he covered his disappointment with what pretenses he could;
and he waited till he could telegraph back his adverse decision. His conclusion was that, next
to proposing marriage, there was no transaction of life that involved so many delicate and complex
relations as buying a horse, and that the rupture of a horse-trade was little less embarrassing
and distressing to all concerned than a broken engagement. There was a terrible intimacy in
the affair; it was alarmingly personal. He went about sorrowing for the pain and disappointment
he had inflicted on many amiable people of all degrees who had tried to supply him with a
horse.

"Look here," said his neighbor, finding him in this low state, "why don't you get a horse of
the gentleman who furnishes mine?" This had been suggested before, and my friend explained
that he had disliked to make trouble. His scruples were lightly set aside, and he suffered himself
to be entreated. The fact was he was so discouraged with his attempt to buy a horse that if
any one had now given him such a horse as he wanted he would have taken it.

One sunny, breezy morning his neighbor drove my friend over to the beautiful farm of the good
genius on whose kindly offices he had now fixed his languid hopes. I need not say what the
landscape was in mid-August, or how, as they drew near the farm,
the air was enriched with the breath of vast orchards of early apples,--apples
that no forced fingers rude shatter from their stems, but that ripen
and mellow untouched, till they drop into the straw with which the
orchard aisles are bedded; it is the poetry of horticulture; it is
Art practicing the wise and gracious patience of Nature, and offering
to the Market a Summer Sweeting of the Hesperides.

The possessor of this luscious realm at once took my friend's case into consideration; he listened,
the owner of a hundred horses, with gentle indulgence to the shapeless desires of a man whose
wildest dream was one horse. At the end he said, "I see you want a horse that can take care
of himself."

"No," replied my friend, with the inspiration of despair. "I want
a horse that can take care of me."

The good genius laughed, and turned the conversation. Neither he nor my friend's neighbor was
a man of many words, and like taciturn people they talked in low tones. The three moved about
the room and looked at the Hispano-Roman pictures; they had a glass
of sherry; from time to time something was casually murmured about
Frank.

My friend felt that he was in good hands, and left the affair to them. It ended in a visit
to the stable, where it appeared that this gentleman had no horse to sell among his hundred
which exactly met my friend's want, but that he proposed to lend him Frank while a certain
other animal was put in training for the difficult office he required of a horse. One of the
men was sent for Frank, and in the mean time my friend was shown some gaunt and graceful thoroughbreds,
and taught to see the difference between them and the plebeian horse. But Frank, though no
thoroughbred, eclipsed these patricians when he came.

He had a little head, and a neck gallantly arched; he was black and plump and smooth, and though
he carried himself with a petted air, and was a dandy to the tips
of his hooves, his knowing eye was kindly.

He turned it upon my friend with the effect of understanding his case at a glance.

It was in this way that for the rest of the long, lovely summer peace was re-established in his
heart. There was no question of buying or selling Frank; there were associations that endeared
him beyond money to his owner; but my friend could take him without price. The situation had its
humiliation for a man who had been arrogantly trying to buy a horse,
but he submitted with grateful meekness, and with what grace Heaven
granted him; and Frank gayly entered upon the peculiar duties of his
position.

His first duty was to upset all preconceived notions of the advantage of youth in a horse. Frank
was not merely not coming seven or nine, but his age was an even number,--he was sixteen; and it was
his owner's theory, which Frank supported, that if a horse was well used he was a good horse
till twenty-five.

The truth is that Frank looked like a young horse; he was a dandy
without any of the ghastliness which attends the preservation of youth
in old beaux of another species.

When my friend drove him in the rehabilitated phaeton he felt that the turn-out was stylish,
and he learned to consult certain eccentricities of Frank's in the satisfaction of his pride.
One of these was a high reluctance to be passed on the road. Frank was as lazy a horse--but lazy
in a self-respectful, æsthetic way--as ever was; yet if he heard
a vehicle at no matter how great distance behind him (and he always
heard it before his driver), he brightened with resolution and defiance,
and struck out with speed that made competition difficult.

If my friend found that the horse behind was likely to pass Frank,
he made a merit of holding him in.

If they met a team, he lay back in his phaeton, and affected not to care to be going faster than
a walk, any way.

One of the things for which he chiefly prized Frank was his skill in backing and turning. He
is one of those men who become greatly perturbed when required to back and turn a vehicle;
he cannot tell (till too late) whether he ought to pull the right
rein in order to back to the left, or vice versa; he knows, indeed,
the principle, but he becomes paralyzed in its application.

Frank never was embarrassed, never confused. My friend had but to say, "Back, Frank!" and
Frank knew from the nature of the ground how far to back and which way to turn. He has thus
extricated my friend from positions in which it appeared to him that
no earthly power could relieve him.

In going up hill Frank knew just when to give himself a rest, and
at what moment to join the party in looking about and enjoying the
prospect.

He was also an adept in scratching off flies, and had a precision in reaching an insect anywhere
in his van with one of his rear hooves which few of us attain in slapping mosquitoes. This action
sometimes disquieted persons in the phaeton, but Frank knew perfectly
well what he was about, and if harm had happened to the people under
his charge my friend was sure that Frank could have done anything
short of applying arnica and telegraphing to their friends.

His varied knowledge of life and his long experience had satisfied
him that there were very few things to be afraid of in this world.

Such womanish weaknesses as shying and starting were far from him,
and he regarded the boisterous behavior of locomotives with indifference.

He had not, indeed, the virtue of one horse offered to my friend's purchase, of standing, unmoved,
with his nose against a passing express train; but he was certainly not afraid of the cars.

Frank
was by no means what Mr. Emerson calls a mush of concession; he was not merely amiable; he had
his moments of self-assertion, his touches of asperity. It was not safe to pat his nose, like
the erring Billy's; he was apt to bring his handsome teeth together
in proximity to the caressing hand with a sharp click and a sarcastic
grin. Not that he ever did, or ever would really bite. So, too, when
left to stand long under fly-haunted cover, he would start off afterwards
with alarming vehemence; and he objected to the saddle.

Time would have seemed to creep to the watchers by the bed, if it had only been measured by
the doubtful, distant hope which kept count of the moments within the chamber; but it was measured
for them by a fast-approaching dread which made the nights come too quickly. While Mr. Tulliver
was slowly becoming himself again, his lot was hastening toward its moment of most palpable
change. The taxing-masters had done their work like any respectable gunsmith conscientiously
preparing the musket, that, duly pointed by a brave arm, will spoil a life or two. Allocaturs,
filing of bills in Chancery, decrees of sale, are legal chain-shot or bomb-shells that can
never hit a solitary mark, but must fall with widespread shattering. So deeply inherent is
it in this life of ours that men have to suffer for each other's sins, so inevitably diffusive
is human suffering, that even justice makes its victims, and we can conceive no retribution
that does not spread beyond its mark in pulsations of unmerited pain.

By the beginning of the second week in January, the bills were out advertising the sale, under
a decree of Chancery, of Mr. Tulliver's farming and other stock, to be followed by a sale of
the mill and land, held in the proper after-dinner hour at the Golden Lion. The miller himself,
unaware of the lapse of time, fancied himself still in that first stage of his misfortunes
when expedients might be thought of; and often in his conscious hours talked in a feeble, disjointed
manner of plans he would carry out when he "got well." The wife and children were not without
hope of an issue that would at least save Mr. Tulliver from leaving the old spot, and seeking
an entirely strange life. For uncle Deane had been induced to interest himself in this stage
of the business. It would not, he acknowledged, be a bad speculation for Guest & Co. to buy
Dorlcote Mill, and carry on the business, which was a good one, and might be increased by the
addition of steam power; in which case Tulliver might be retained as manager. Still, Mr. Deane
would say nothing decided about the matter; the fact that Wakem held the mortgage on the land
might put it into his head to bid for the whole estate, and further, to outbid the cautious
firm of Guest &Co., who did not carry on business on sentimental grounds. Mr. Deane was obliged
to tell Mrs. Tulliver something to that effect, when he rode over to the mill to inspect the
books in company with Mrs. Glegg; for she had observed that "if Guest &Co. would only think
about it, Mr. Tulliver's father and grandfather had been carrying on Dorlcote Mill long before
the oil-mill of that firm had been so much as thought of."

Mr. Deane, in reply, doubted whether that was precisely the relation between the two mills
which would determine their value as investments. As for uncle Glegg, the thing lay quite beyond
his imagination; the good-natured man felt sincere pity for the Tulliver family, but his money
was all locked up in excellent mortgages, and he could run no risk; that would be unfair to
his own relatives; but he had made up his mind that Tulliver should have some new flannel waistcoats
which he had himself renounced in favor of a more elastic commodity, and that he would buy
Mrs. Tulliver a pound of tea now and then; it would be a journey which his benevolence delighted
in beforehand, to carry the tea and see her pleasure on being assured it was the best black.

Still, it was clear that Mr. Deane was kindly disposed toward the Tullivers. One day he had
brought Lucy, who was come home for the Christmas holidays, and the little blond angel-head
had pressed itself against Maggie's darker cheek with many kisses and some tears. These fair
slim daughters keep up a tender spot in the heart of many a respectable partner in a respectable
firm, and perhaps Lucy's anxious, pitying questions about her poor cousins helped to make uncle
Deane more prompt in finding Tom a temporary place in the warehouse, and in putting him in
the way of getting evening lessons in book-keeping and calculation.

That might have cheered the lad and fed his hopes a little, if there had not come at the same
time the much-dreaded blow of finding that his father must be a bankrupt, after all; at least,
the creditors must be asked to take less than their due, which to Tom's untechnical mind was
the same thing as bankruptcy. His father must not only be said to have "lost his property,"
but to have "failed,"--the word that carried the worst obloquy to Tom's mind. For when the
defendant's claim for costs had been satisfied, there would remain the friendly bill of Mr.
Gore, and the deficiency at the bank, as well as the other debts which would make the assets
shrink into unequivocal disproportion; "not more than ten or twelve shillings in the pound,"
predicted Mr. Deane, in a decided tone, tightening his lips; and the words fell on Tom like
a scalding liquied, leaving a continual smart.

He was sadly in want of something to keep up his spirits a little in the unpleasant newness
of his position,--suddenly transported from the easy carpeted ennui of study-hours at Mr. Stelling's,
and the busy idleness of castle-building in a "last half" at school, to the companionship of
sacks and hides, and bawling men thundering down heavy weights at his elbow. The first step
toward getting on in the world was a chill, dusty, noisy affair, and implied going without
one's tea in order to stay in St. Ogg's and have an evening lesson from a one-armed elderly
clerk, in a room smelling strongly of bad tobacco. Tom's young pink-and-white face had its
colors very much deadened by the time he took off his hat at home, and sat down with keen hunger
to his supper. No wonder he was a little cross if his mother or Maggie spoke to him.

But all this while Mrs. Tulliver was brooding over a scheme by which she, and no one else,
would avert the result most to be dreaded, and prevent Wakem from entertaining the purpose
of bidding for the mill. Imagine a truly respectable and amiable hen, by some portentous anomaly,
taking to reflection and inventing combinations by which she might prevail on Hodge not to
wring her neck, or send her and her chicks to market; the result could hardly be other than
much cackling and fluttering. Mrs. Tulliver, seeing that everything had gone wrong, had begun
to think she had been too passive in life; and that, if she had applied her mind to business,
and taken a strong resolution now and then, it would have been all the better for her and her
family. Nobody, it appeared, had thought of going to speak to Wakem on this business of the
mill; and yet, Mrs. Tulliver reflected, it would have been quite the shortest method of securing
the right end. It would have been of no use, to be sure, for Mr. Tulliver to go,--even if he
had been able and willing,--for he had been "going to law against Wakem" and abusing him for
the last ten years; Wakem was always likely to have a spite against him. And now that Mrs.
Tulliver had come to the conclusion that her husband was very much in the wrong to bring her
into this trouble, she was inclined to think that his opinion of Wakem was wrong too. To be
sure, Wakem had "put the bailies in the house, and sold them up"; but she supposed he did that
to please the man that lent Mr. Tulliver the money, for a lawyer had more folks to please than
one, and he wasn't likely to put Mr. Tulliver, who had gone to law with him, above everybody
else in the world. The attorney might be a very reasonable man; why not? He had married a Miss
Clint, and at the time Mrs. Tulliver had heard of that marriage, the summer when she wore her
blue satin spencer, and had not yet any thoughts of Mr. Tulliver, she knew no harm of Wakem.
And certainly toward herself, whom he knew to have been a Miss Dodson, it was out of all possibility
that he could entertain anything but good-will, when it was once brought home to his observation
that she, for her part, had never wanted to go to law, and indeed was at present disposed to
take Mr. Wakem's view of all subjects rather than her husband's. In fact, if that attorney
saw a respectable matron like herself disposed "to give him good words," why shouldn't he listen
to her representations? For she would put the matter clearly before him, which had never been
done yet. And he would never go and bid for the mill on purpose to spite her, an innocent woman,
who thought it likely enough that she had danced with him in their youth at Squire Darleigh's,
for at those big dances she had often and often danced with young men whose names she had forgotten. 

New York: Geo. P. Putnam.]

HOW THEY JESTED IN THE GOOD OLD TIME.

There is nothing which contributes so much to ease social intercourse as the jest. In comparison
with it, the proverb is only a humble subordinate, and song itself, with all its power, but
a weak influence. Yet the song and the proverb boast a critical literature, while the brief
compendiums of merriment which never die, which, once written, live through every age, and
force their way through every penetrable language, are undoubtedly less studied than any other
popular medium of feeling.

What is a jest? It is as little worth the while to try to define its nature, as it is to analyze
wit. We all know that the world laughs, and what it laughs at, and what the droll saws, anecdotes,
rhymes, quips, and facetiæ are, which give fame to a Bebel, or a Frischlin, a Tom Brown, and
a Joseph Miller. Leave labored analysis to the philosophers, contenting ourselves with remarking
that a jest is a laugh candied or frozen in words, and thawed and relished in the reading or
utterance. And laughter? When a man is too lazy to think out an idea,
and yet too active to dreamily feel it, he laughs.

When he catches its leading points, and yet realizes that behind them remains the incomprehensible
or incongruous, he settles it for the nonce with a smile. Hence it comes that we laugh so seldom
with all our heart, a second time over a jest. It has been comprehended; the mystery, the sense of contradiction
and incongruity, has vanished--we may revive it in others, and laugh electrically with them;
but the first piquant gusto of its spice is gone forever.

Yet the jest, like the proverb, acquires a value by becoming current. It often illustrates an opinion
or an experience, and when it is much worn, it may still gain a new
point, by being brought into illustrative relation with some event
or idea.

Esop's fables, or any fables, are, after all, only good jokes in a narrative form, which owe
their fame simply to their boundless capacity for application. Sidney Smith's story of Mrs. Partington,
who tried to mop out the Atlantic, was a jest, and so too was Lady Macbeth's 'cat i' the adage,' who
wanted fish, yet would not wet her paws, and let 'I dare not' wait
upon 'I would.' Something of our old enjoyment of a joke for the first
time, always lingers around it, and we gladly laugh again--for, 'old
love never quite rusts out.' And there are many jests, which, owing
to their boundless variety of application, always come before us in
a new light. It is still possible to believe that the attorney was not more guilty
toward him than an ingenious machine, which performs its work with much regularity, is guilty
toward the rash man who, venturing too near it, is caught up by some fly-wheel or other, and
suddenly converted into unexpected mince-meat.

But it is really impossible to decide this question by a glance at his person; the lines and
lights of the human countenance are like other symbols,--not always easy to read without a
key. On an a priori view of Wakem's aquiline nose, which offended Mr. Tulliver, there was not
more rascality than in the shape of his stiff shirt-collar, though this too along with his
nose, might have become fraught with damnatory meaning when once the rascality was ascertained.

"Mrs. Tulliver, I think?" said Mr. Wakem.

"Yes, sir; Miss Elizabeth Dodson as was."

"Pray be seated. You have some business with me?"

"Well, sir, yes," said Mrs. Tulliver, beginning to feel alarmed at her own courage, now she
was really in presence of the formidable man, and reflecting that she had not settled with
herself how she should begin. Mr. Wakem felt in his waistcoat pockets, and looked at her in
silence.

"I hope, sir," she began at last,--"I hope, sir, you're not a-thinking as I bear you any ill-will
because o' my husband's losing his lawsuit, and the bailies being put in, and the linen being
sold,--oh dear!--for I wasn't brought up in that way. I'm sure you remember my father, sir,
for he was close friends with Squire Darleigh, and we allays went to the dances there, the
Miss Dodsons,--nobody could be more looked on,--and justly, for there was four of us, and you're
quite aware as Mrs. Glegg and Mrs. Deane are my sisters. And as for going to law and losing
money, and having sales before you're dead, I never saw anything o' that before I was married,
nor for a long while after. And I'm not to be answerable for my bad luck i' marrying out o'
my own family into one where the goings-on was different. And as for being drawn in t' abuse
you as other folks abuse you, sir, that I niver was, and nobody can say it of me."

Mrs. Tulliver shook her head a little, and looked at the hem of her pocket-handkerchief.

"I've no doubt of what you say, Mrs. Tulliver," said Mr. Wakem, with cold politeness. "But
you have some question to ask me?"

"Well, sir, yes. But that's what I've said to myself,--I've said you'd had some nat'ral feeling;
and as for my husband, as hasn't been himself for this two months, I'm not a-defending him,
in no way, for being so hot about th' erigation,--not but what there's worse men, for he never
wronged nobody of a shilling nor a penny, not willingly; and as for his fieriness and lawing,
what could I do? And him struck as if it was with death when he got the letter as said you'd
the hold upo' the land. But I can't believe but what you'll behave as a gentleman."

"What does all this mean, Mrs. Tulliver?" said Mr. Wakem rather sharply. "What do you want
to ask me?"

"Why, sir, if you'll be so good," said Mrs. Tulliver, starting a little, and speaking more
hurriedly,--"if you'll be so good not to buy the mill an' the land,--the land wouldn't so much
matter, only my husband ull' be like mad at your having it."

Something like a new thought flashed across Mr. Wakem's face as he said, "Who told you I meant
to buy it?"

"Why, sir, it's none o' my inventing, and I should never ha' thought of it; for my husband,
as ought to know about the law, he allays used to say as lawyers had never no call to buy anything,--either
lands or houses,--for they allays got 'em into their hands other ways. An' I should think that
'ud be the way with you, sir; and I niver said as you'd be the man to do contrairy to that."

"Ah, well, who was it that did say so?" said Wakem, opening his desk, and moving things about,
with the accompaniment of an almost inaudible whistle.

"Why, sir, it was Mr. Glegg and Mr. Deane, as have all the management; and Mr. Deane thinks
as Guest &Co. 'ud buy the mill and let Mr. Tulliver work it for 'em, if you didn't bid for
it and raise the price. And it 'ud be such a thing for my husband to stay where he is, if he
could get his living: for it was his father's before him, the mill was, and his grandfather
built it, though I wasn't fond o' the noise of it, when first I was married, for there was
no mills in our family,--not the Dodson's,--and if I'd known as the mills had so much to do
with the law, it wouldn't have been me as 'ud have been the first Dodson to marry one; but
I went into it blindfold, that I did, erigation and everything."

"What! Guest &Co. would keep the mill in their own hands, I suppose, and pay your husband wages?"

"Oh dear, sir, it's hard to think of," said poor Mrs. Tulliver, a little tear making its way,
"as my husband should take wage. But it 'ud look more like what used to be, to stay at the
mill than to go anywhere else; and if you'll only think--if you was to bid for the mill and
buy it, my husband might be struck worse than he was before, and niver get better again as
he's getting now."

"Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my manager in the same
way, how then?" said Mr. Wakem.

"Oh, sir, I doubt he could niver be got to do it, not if the very mill stood still to beg and
pray of him. For your name's like poison to him, it's so as never was; and he looks upon it
as you've been the ruin of him all along, ever since you set the law on him about the road
through the meadow,--that's eight year ago, and he's been going on ever since--as I've allays
told him he was wrong----"

"He's a pig-headed, foul-mouthed fool!" burst out Mr. Wakem, forgetting himself.

"Oh dear, sir!" said Mrs. Tulliver, frightened at a result so different from the one she had
fixed her mind on; "I wouldn't wish to contradict you, but it's like enough he's changed his
mind with this illness,--he's forgot a many things he used to talk about. And you wouldn't
like to have a corpse on your mind, if he was to die; and they do say as it's allays unlucky
when Dorlcote Mill changes hands, and the water might all run away, and then--not as I'm wishing
you any ill-luck, sir, for I forgot to tell you as I remember your wedding as if it was yesterday;
Mrs. Wakem was a Miss Clint, I know that; and my boy, as there isn't a nicer, handsomer, straighter
boy nowhere, went to school with your son----"

Mr. Wakem rose, opened the door, and called to one of his clerks.

"You must excuse me for interrupting you, Mrs. Tulliver; I have business that must be attended
to; and I think there is nothing more necessary to be said."

"But if you would bear it in mind, sir," said Mrs. Tulliver, rising, "and not run against me
and my children; and I'm not denying Mr. Tulliver's been in the wrong, but he's been punished
enough, and there's worse men, for it's been giving to other folks has been his fault. He's
done nobody any harm but himself and his family,--the more's the pity,--and I go and look at
the bare shelves every day, and think where all my things used to stand."

"Yes, yes, I'll bear it in mind," said Mr. Wakem, hastily, looking toward the open door.

"And if you'd please not to say as I've been to speak to you, for my son 'ud be very angry
with me for demeaning myself, I know he would, and I've trouble enough without being scolded
by my children."

Poor Mrs. Tulliver's voice trembled a little, and she could make no answer to the attorney's
"good morning," but curtsied and walked out in silence.

"Which day is it that Dorlcote Mill is to be sold? Where's the bill?" said Mr. Wakem to his
clerk when they were alone.

"Next Friday is the day,--Friday at six o'clock."

"Oh, just run to Winship's the auctioneer, and see if he's at home. I have some business for
him; ask him to come up."

Although, when Mr. Wakem entered his office that morning, he had had no intention of purchasing
Dorlcote Mill, his mind was already made up. Mrs. Tulliver had suggested to him several determining
motives, and his mental glance was very rapid; he was one of those men who can be prompt without
being rash, because their motives run in fixed tracks, and they have no need to reconcile conflicting
aims.

To suppose that Wakem had the same sort of inveterate hatred toward Tulliver that Tulliver
had toward him would be like supposing that a pike and a roach can look at each other from
a similar point of view. The roach necessarily abhors the mode in which the pike gets his living,
and the pike is likely to think nothing further even of the most indignant roach than that
he is excellent good eating; it could only be when the roach choked him that the pike could
entertain a strong personal animosity. If Mr. Tulliver had ever seriously injured or thwarted
the attorney, Wakem would not have refused him the distinction of being a special object of
his vindictiveness. But when Mr. Tulliver called Wakem a rascal at the market dinner-table,
the attorneys' clients were not a whit inclined to withdraw their business from him; and if,
when Wakem himself happened to be present, some jocose cattle-feeder, stimulated by opportunity
and brandy, made a thrust at him by alluding to old ladies' wills, he maintained perfect sang
froid, and knew quite well that the majority of substantial men then present were perfectly
contented with the fact that "Wakem was Wakem"; that is to say, a man who always knew the stepping-stones
that would carry him through very muddy bits of practice. A man who had made a large fortune,
had a handsome house among the trees at Tofton, and decidedly the finest stock of port-wine
in the neighborhood of St. Ogg's, was likely to feel himself on a level with public opinion.
And I am not sure that even honest Mr. Tulliver himself, with his general view of law as a
cockpit, might not, under opposite circumstances, have seen a fine appropriateness in the truth
that "Wakem was Wakem"; since I have understood from persons versed in history, that mankind
is not disposed to look narrowly into the conduct of great victors when their victory is on
the right side. Tulliver, then, could be no obstruction to Wakem; on the contrary, he was a
poor devil whom the lawyer had defeated several times; a hot-tempered fellow, who would always
give you a handle against him. Wakem's conscience was not uneasy because he had used a few
tricks against the miller; why should he hate that unsuccessful plaintiff, that pitiable, furious
bull entangled in the meshes of a net?

Still, among the various excesses to which human nature is subject, moralists have never numbered
that of being too fond of the people who openly revile us. The successful Yellow candidate
for the borough of Old Topping, perhaps, feels no pursuant meditative hatred toward the Blue
editor who consoles his subscribers with vituperative rhetoric against Yellow men who sell
their country, and are the demons of private life; but he might not be sorry, if law and opportunity
favored, to kick that Blue editor to a deeper shade of his favorite color. Prosperous men take
a little vengeance now and then, as they take a diversion, when it comes easily in their way,
and is no hindrance to business; and such small unimpassioned revenges have an enormous effect
in life, running through all degrees of pleasant infliction, blocking the fit men out of places,
and blackening characters in unpremeditated talk. Still more, to see people who have been only
insignificantly offensive to us reduced in life and humiliated, without any special effort
of ours, is apt to have a soothing, flattering influence. Providence or some other prince of
this world, it appears, has undertaken the task of retribution for us; and really, by an agreeable
constitution of things, our enemies somehow don't prosper.

Wakem was not without this parenthetic vindictiveness toward the uncomplimentary miller; and
now Mrs. Tulliver had put the notion into his head, it presented itself to him as a pleasure
to do the very thing that would cause Mr. Tulliver the most deadly mortification,-- and a pleasure
of a complex kind, not made up of crude malice, but mingling with it the relish of self-approbation.
To see an enemy humiliated gives a certain contentment, but this is jejune compared with the
highly blent satisfaction of seeing him humiliated by your benevolent action or concession
on his behalf. That is a sort of revenge which falls into the scale of virtue, and Wakem was
not without an intention of keeping that scale respectably filled. He had once had the pleasure
of putting an old enemy of his into one of the St. Ogg's alms-houses, to the rebuilding of
which he had given a large subscription; and here was an opportunity of providing for another
by making him his own servant. Such things give a completeness to prosperity, and contribute
elements of agreeable consciousness that are not dreamed of by that short-sighted, overheated
vindictiveness which goes out its way to wreak itself in direct injury. And Tulliver, with
his rough tongue filed by a sense of obligation, would make a better servant than any chance-fellow
who was cap-in-hand for a situation. Tulliver was known to be a man of proud honesty, and Wakem
was too acute not to believe in the existence of honesty. He was given too observing individuals,
not to judging of them according to maxims, and no one knew better than he that all men were
not like himself. Besides, he intended to overlook the whole business of land and mill pretty
closely; he was fond of these practical rural matters. But there were good reasons for purchasing
Dorlcote Mill, quite apart from any benevolent vengeance on the miller. It was really a capital
investment; besides, Guest &Co. were going to bid for it. Mr. Guest and Mr. Wakem were on friendly
dining terms, and the attorney liked to predominate over a ship-owner and mill-owner who was
a little too loud in the town affairs as well as in his table-talk. For Wakem was not a mere
man of business; he was considered a pleasant fellow in the upper circles of St. Ogg's--chatted
amusingly over his port-wine, did a little amateur farming, and had certainly been an excellent
husband and father; at church, when he went there, he sat under the handsomest of mural monuments
erected to the memory of his wife. Most men would have married again under his circumstances,
but he was said to be more tender to his deformed son than most men were to their best-shapen
offspring. Not that Mr. Wakem had not other sons beside Philip; but toward them he held only
a chiaroscuro parentage, and provided for them in a grade of life duly beneath his own. In
this fact, indeed, there lay the clenching motive to the purchase of Dorlcote Mill. While Mrs.
Tulliver was talking, it had occurred to the rapid-minded lawyer, among all the other circumstances
of the case, that this purchase would, in a few years to come, furnish a highly suitable position
for a certain favorite lad whom he meant to bring on in the world.

These were the mental conditions on which Mrs. Tulliver had undertaken to act persuasively,
and had failed; a fact which may receive some illustration from the remark of a great philosopher,
that fly-fishers fail in preparing their bait so as to make it alluring in the right quarter,
for want of a due acquaintance with the subjectivity of fishes.

Chapter VIII

Daylight on the Wreck

It was a clear frosty January day on which Mr. Tulliver first came downstairs. The bright sun
on the chestnut boughs and the roofs opposite his window had made him impatiently declare that
he would be caged up no longer; he thought everywhere would be more cheery under this sunshine
than his bedroom; for he knew nothing of the bareness below, which made the flood of sunshine
importunate, as if it had an unfeeling pleasure in showing the empty places, and the marks
where well-known objects once had been. The impression on his mind that it was but yesterday
when he received the letter from Mr. Gore was so continually implied in his talk, and the attempts
to convey to him the idea that many weeks had passed and much had happened since then had been
so soon swept away by recurrent forgetfulness, that even Mr. Turnbull had begun to despair
of preparing him to meet the facts by previous knowledge. The full sense of the present could
only be imparted gradually by new experience,--not by mere words, which must remain weaker
than the impressions left by the old experience. This resolution to come downstairs was heard
with trembling by the wife and children. Mrs. Tulliver said Tom must not go to St. Ogg's at
the usual hour, he must wait and see his father downstairs; and Tom complied, though with an
intense inward shrinking from the painful scene. The hearts of all three had been more deeply
dejected than ever during the last few days. For Guest & Co. had not bought the mill; both
mill and land had been knocked down to Wakem, who had been over the premises, and had laid
before Mr. Deane and Mr. Glegg, in Mrs. Tulliver's presence, his willingness to employ Mr.
Tulliver, in case of his recovery, as a manager of the business. This proposition had occasioned
much family debating. Uncles and aunts were almost unanimously of opinion that such an offer
ought not to be rejected when there was nothing in the way but a feeling in Mr. Tulliver's
mind, which, as neither aunts nor uncles shared it, was regarded as entirely unreasonable and
childish,--indeed, as a transferring toward Wakem of that indignation and hatred which Mr.
Tulliver ought properly to have directed against himself for his general quarrelsomeness, and
his special exhibition of it in going to law. Here was an opportunity for Mr. Tulliver to provide
for his wife and daughter without any assistance from his wife's relations, and without that
too evident descent into pauperism which makes it annoying to respectable people to meet the
degraded member of the family by the wayside. Mr. Tulliver, Mrs. Glegg considered, must be
made to feel, when he came to his right mind, that he could never humble himself enough; for
that had come which she had always foreseen would come of his insolence in time past "to them
as were the best friends he'd got to look to." Mr Glegg and Mr. Deane were less stern in their
views, but they both of them thought Tulliver had done enough harm by his hot-tempered crotchets
and ought to put them out of the question when a livelihood was offered him; Wakem showed a
right feeling about the matter,--he had no grudge against Tulliver.

Tom had protested against entertaining the proposition. He shouldn't like his father to be
under Wakem; he thought it would look mean-spirited; but his mother's main distress was the
utter impossibility of ever "turning Mr. Tulliver round about Wakem," or getting him to hear
reason; no, they would all have to go and live in a pigsty on purpose to spite Wakem, who spoke
"so as nobody could be fairer." Indeed, Mrs. Tulliver's mind was reduced to such confusion
by living in this strange medium of unaccountable sorrow, against which she continually appealed
by asking, "Oh dear, what have I done to deserve worse than other women?" that Maggie began
to suspect her poor mother's wits were quite going.

"Tom," she said, when they were out of their father's room together, "we must try to make father
understand a little of what has happened before he goes downstairs. But we must get my mother
away. She will say something that will do harm. Ask Kezia to fetch her down, and keep her engaged
with something in the kitchen."

Kezia was equal to the task. Having declared her intention of staying till the master could
get about again, "wage or no wage," she had found a certain recompense in keeping a strong
hand over her mistress, scolding her for "moithering" herself, and going about all day without
changing her cap, and looking as if she was "mushed." Altogether, this time of trouble was
rather a Saturnalian time to Kezia; she could scold her betters with unreproved freedom. On
this particular occasion there were drying clothes to be fetched in; she wished to know if
one pair of hands could do everything in-doors and out, and observed that she should have thought
it would be good for Mrs. Tulliver to put on her bonnet, and get a breath of fresh air by doing
that needful piece of work. Poor Mrs. Tulliver went submissively downstairs; to be ordered
about by a servant was the last remnant of her household dignities,--she would soon have no
servant to scold her. Mr. Tulliver was resting in his chair a little after the fatigue of dressing,
and Maggie and Tom were seated near him, when Luke entered to ask if he should help master
downstairs.

"Ay, ay, Luke; stop a bit, sit down," said Mr. Tulliver pointing his stick toward a chair,
and looking at him with that pursuant gaze which convalescent persons often have for those
who have tended them, reminding one of an infant gazing about after its nurse. For Luke had
been a constant night-watcher by his master's bed.

"How's the water now, eh, Luke?" said Mr. Tulliver. "Dix hasn't been choking you up again, eh?"

"No, sir, it's all right."

"Ay, I thought not; he won't be in a hurry at that again, now Riley's been to settle him. That
was what I said to Riley yesterday--I said----"

Mr. Tulliver leaned forward, resting his elbows on the armchair, and looking on the ground
as if in search of something, striving after vanishing images like a man struggling against
a doze. Maggie looked at Tom in mute distress, their father's mind was so far off the present,
which would by-and-by thrust itself on his wandering consciousness! Tom was almost ready to
rush away, with that impatience of painful emotion which makes one of the differences between
youth and maiden, man and woman.

"Father," said Maggie, laying her hand on his, "don't you remember that Mr. Riley is dead?"

"Dead?" said Mr. Tulliver, sharply, looking in her face with a strange, examining glance.

"Yes, he died of apoplexy nearly a year ago. I remember hearing you say you had to pay money
for him; and he left his daughters badly off; one of them is under-teacher at Miss Firniss's,
where I've been to school, you know."

"Ah?" said her father, doubtfully, still looking in her face. But as soon as Tom began to speak
he turned to look at him with the same inquiring glances, as if he were rather surprised at
the presence of these two young people. Whenever his mind was wandering in the far past, he
fell into this oblivion of their actual faces; they were not those of the lad and the little
wench who belonged to that past.

"It's a long while since you had the dispute with Dix, father," said Tom. "I remember your
talking about it three years ago, before I went to school at Mr. Stelling's. I've been at school
there three years; don't you remember?"

Mr. Tulliver threw himself backward again, losing the childlike outward glance under a rush
of new ideas, which diverted him from external impressions.

"Ay, ay," he said, after a minute or two, "I've paid a deal o' money--I was determined my son
should have a good eddication; I'd none myself, and I've felt the miss of it. And he'll want
no other fortin, that's what I say--if Wakem was to get the better of me again----"

The thought of Wakem roused new vibrations, and after a moment's pause he began to look at
the coat he had on, and to feel in his side-pocket. Then he turned to Tom, and said in his
old sharp way, "Where have they put Gore's letter?"

It was close at hand in a drawer, for he had often asked for it before.

"You know what there is in the letter, father?" said Tom, as he gave it to him.

"To be sure I do," said Mr. Tulliver, rather angrily. "What o' that? If Furley can't take to
the property, somebody else can; there's plenty o' people in the world besides Furley. But
it's hindering--my not being well--go and tell 'em to get the horse in the gig, Luke; I can
get down to St. Ogg's well enough--Gore's expecting me."

"No, dear father!" Maggie burst out entreatingly; "it's a very long while since all that; you've
been ill a great many weeks,--more than two months; everything is changed."

Mr. Tulliver looked at them all three alternately with a startled gaze; the idea that much
had happened of which he knew nothing had often transiently arrested him before, but it came
upon him now with entire novelty.

"Yes, father," said Tom, in answer to the gaze. "You needn't trouble your mind about business
until you are quite well; everything is settled about that for the present,--about the mill
and the land and the debts."

"What's settled, then?" said his father, angrily.

"Don't you take on too much bout it, sir," said Luke. "You'd ha' paid iverybody if you could,--that's
what I said to Master Tom,--I said you'd ha' paid iverybody if you could."

Good Luke felt, after the manner of contented hard-working men whose lives have been spent
in servitude, that sense of natural fitness in rank which made his master's downfall a tragedy
to him. He was urged, in his slow way, to say something that would express his share in the
family sorrow; and these words, which he had used over and over again to Tom when he wanted
to decline the full payment of his fifty pounds out of the children's money, were the most
ready to his tongue. They were just the words to lay the most painful hold on his master's
bewildered mind.

"Paid everybody?" he said, with vehement agitation, his face flushing, and his eye lighting
up. "Why--what--have they made me a bankrupt?"

"Oh, father, dear father!" said Maggie, who thought that terrible word really represented the
fact; "bear it well, because we love you; your children will always love you. Tom will pay
them all; he says he will, when he's a man."

She felt her father beginning to tremble; his voice trembled too, as he said, after a few moments:

"Ay, my little wench, but I shall never live twice o'er."

"But perhaps you will live to see me pay everybody, father," said Tom, speaking with a great
effort.

"Ah, my lad," said Mr. Tulliver, shaking his head slowly, "but what's broke can never be whole
again; it 'ud be your doing, not mine." Then looking up at him, "You're only sixteen; it's
an up-hill fight for you, but you mustn't throw it at your father; the raskills have been too
many for him. I've given you a good eddication,--that'll start you."

Something in his throat half choked the last words; the flush, which had alarmed his children
because it had so often preceded a recurrence of paralysis, had subsided, and his face looked
pale and tremulous. Tom said nothing; he was still struggling against his inclination to rush
away. His father remained quiet a minute or two, but his mind did not seem to be wandering again.

"Have they sold me up, then?" he said more clamly, as if he were possessed simply by the desire
to know what had happened.

"Everything is sold, father; but we don't know all about the mill and the land yet," said Tom,
anxious to ward off any question leading to the fact that Wakem was the purchaser.

"You must not be surprised to see the room look very bare downstairs, father," said Maggie;
"but there's your chair and the bureau; they're not gone."

"Let us go; help me down, Luke,--I'll go and see everything," said Mr. Tulliver, leaning on
his stick, and stretching out his other hand toward Luke.

"Ay, sir," said Luke, as he gave his arm to his master, "you'll make up your mind to't a bit
better when you've seen iverything; you'll get used to't. That's what my mother says about
her shortness o' breath,--she says she's made friends wi't now, though she fought again' it
sore when it just come on."

Maggie ran on before to see that all was right in the dreary parlor, where the fire, dulled
by the frosty sunshine, seemed part of the general shabbiness. She turned her father's chair,
and pushed aside the table to make an easy way for him, and then stood with a beating heart
to see him enter and look round for the first time. Tom advanced before him, carrying the leg-rest,
and stood beside Maggie on the hearth. Of those two young hearts Tom's suffered the most unmixed
pain, for Maggie, with all her keen susceptibility, yet felt as if the sorrow made larger room
for her love to flow in, and gave breathing-space to her passionate nature. No true boy feels
that; he would rather go and slay the Nemean lion, or perform any round of heroic labors, than
endure perpetual appeals to his pity, for evils over which he can make no conquest.

Mr. Tulliver paused just inside the door, resting on Luke, and looking round him at all the
bare places, which for him were filled with the shadows of departed objects,--the daily companions
of his life. His faculties seemed to be renewing their strength from getting a footing on this
demonstration of the senses.

"Ah!" he said slowly, moving toward his chair, "they've sold me up--they've sold me up."

Then seating himself, and laying down his stick, while Luke left the room, he looked round again.

"They've left the big Bible," he said. "It's got everything in,--when I was born and married;
bring it me, Tom."

The quarto Bible was laid open before him at the fly-leaf, and while he was reading with slowly
travelling eyes Mrs. Tulliver entered the room, but stood in mute surprise to find her husband
down already, and with the great Bible before him.

"Ah," he said, looking at a spot where his finger rested, "my mother was Margaret Beaton; she
died when she was forty-seven,--hers wasn't a long-lived family; we're our mother's children,
Gritty and me are,--we shall go to our last bed before long."

He seemed to be pausing over the record of his sister's birth and marriage, as if it were suggesting
new thoughts to him; then he suddenly looked up at Tom, and said, in a sharp tone of alarm:

"They haven't come upo' Moss for the money as I lent him, have they?"

"No, father," said Tom; "the note was burnt."

Mr. Tulliver turned his eyes on the page again, and presently said:

"Ah--Elizabeth Dodson--it's eighteen year since I married her----"

"Come next Ladyday," said Mrs. Tulliver, going up to his side and looking at the page.

Her husband fixed his eyes earnestly on her face.

"Poor Bessy," he said, "you was a pretty lass then,--everybody said so,--and I used to think
you kept your good looks rarely. But you're sorely aged; don't you bear me ill-will--I meant
to do well by you--we promised one another for better or for worse----"

"But I never thought it 'ud be so for worse as this," said poor Mrs. Tulliver, with the strange,
scared look that had come over her of late; "and my poor father gave me away--and to come on
so all at once----"

"Oh, mother!" said Maggie, "don't talk in that way."

"No, I know you won't let your poor mother speak--that's been the way all my life--your father
never minded what I said--it 'ud have been o' no use for me to beg and pray--and it 'ud be
no use now, not if I was to go down o' my hands and knees----"

"Don't say so, Bessy," said Mr. Tulliver, whose pride, in these first moments of humiliation,
was in abeyance to the sense of some justice in his wife's reproach. "It there's anything left
as I could do to make you amends, I wouldn't say you nay."

"Then we might stay here and get a living, and I might keep among my own sisters,--and me been
such a good wife to you, and never crossed you from week's end to week's end--and they all
say so--they say it 'ud be nothing but right, only you're so turned against Wakem."

"Mother," said Tom, severely, "this is not the time to talk about that."

"Let her be," said Mr. Tulliver. "Say what you mean, Bessy."

"Why, now the mill and the land's all Wakem's, and he's got everything in his hands, what's
the use o' setting your face against him, when he says you may stay here, and speaks as fair
as can be, and says you may manage the business, and have thirty shillings a-week, and a horse
to ride about to market? And where have we got to put our heads? We must go into one o' the
cottages in the village,--and me and my children brought down to that,--and all because you
must set your mind against folks till there's no turning you."

Mr. Tulliver had sunk back in his chair trembling.

"You may do as you like wi' me, Bessy," he said, in a low voice; "I've been the bringing of
you to poverty--this world's too many for me--I'm nought but a bankrupt; it's no use standing
up for anything now."

"Father," said Tom, "I don't agree with my mother or my uncles, and I don't think you ought
to submit to be under Wakem. I get a pound a-week now, and you can find something else to do
when you get well."

"Say no more, Tom, say no more; I've had enough for this day. Give me a kiss, Bessy, and let
us bear one another no ill-will; we shall never be young again--this world's been too many for me."

Chapter IX

An Item Added to the Family Register

That first moment of renunciation and submission was followed by days of violent struggle in
the miller's mind, as the gradual access of bodily strength brought with it increasing ability
to embrace in one view all the conflicting conditions under which he found himself. Feeble
limbs easily resign themselves to be tethered, and when we are subdued by sickness it seems
possible to us to fulfil pledges which the old vigor comes back and breaks. There were times
when poor Tulliver thought the fulfilment of his promise to Bessy was something quite too hard
for human nature; he had promised her without knowing what she was going to say,--she might
as well have asked him to carry a ton weight on his back. But again, there were many feelings
arguing on her side, besides the sense that life had been made hard to her by having married
him. He saw a possibility, by much pinching, of saving money out of his salary toward paying
a second dividend to his creditors, and it would not be easy elsewhere to get a situation such
as he could fill.

He had led an easy life, ordering much and working little, and had no aptitude for any new
business. He must perhaps take to day-labor, and his wife must have help from her sisters,--a
prospect doubly bitter to him, now they had let all Bessy's precious things be sold, probably
because they liked to set her against him, by making her feel that he had brought her to that
pass. He listened to their admonitory talk, when they came to urge on him what he was bound
to do for poor Bessy's sake, with averted eyes, that every now and then flashed on them furtively
when their backs were turned. Nothing but the dread of needing their help could have made it
an easier alternative to take their advice.

But the strongest influence of all was the love of the old premises where he had run about
when he was a boy, just as Tom had done after him. The Tullivers had lived on this spot for
generations, and he had sat listening on a low stool on winter evenings while his father talked
of the old half-timbered mill that had been there before the last great floods which damaged
it so that his grandfather pulled it down and built the new one. It was when he got able to
walk about and look at all the old objects that he felt the strain of his clinging affection
for the old home as part of his life, part of himself. He couldn't bear to think of himself
living on any other spot than this, where he knew the sound of every gate door, and felt that
the shape and color of every roof and weather-stain and broken hillock was good, because his
growing senses had been fed on them. Our instructed vagrancy, which was hardly time to linger
by the hedgerows, but runs away early to the tropics, and is at home with palms and banyans,--which
is nourished on books of travel and stretches the theatre of its imagination to the Zambesi,--can
hardly get a dim notion of what an old-fashioned man like Tulliver felt for this spot, where
all his memories centred, and where life seemed like a familiar smooth-handled tool that the
fingers clutch with loving ease. And just now he was living in that freshened memory of the
far-off time which comes to us in the passive hours of recovery from sickness.

"Ay, Luke," he said one afternoon, as he stood looking over the orchard gate, "I remember the
day they planted those apple-trees. My father was a huge man for planting,--it was like a merry-making
to him to get a cart full o' young trees; and I used to stand i' the cold with him, and follow
him about like a dog."

Then he turned round, and leaning against the gate-post, looked at the opposite buildings.

"The old mill 'ud miss me, I think, Luke. There's a story as when the mill changes hands, the
river's angry; I've heard my father say it many a time. There's no telling whether there mayn't
be summat in the story, for this is a puzzling world, and Old Harry's got a finger in it--it's
been too many for me, I know."

"Ay, sir," said Luke, with soothing sympathy, "what wi' the rust on the wheat, an' the firin'
o' the ricks an' that, as I've seen i' my time,--things often looks comical; there's the bacon
fat wi' our last pig run away like butter,--it leaves nought but a scratchin'."

"It's just as if it was yesterday, now," Mr. Tulliver went on, "when my father began the malting.
I remember, the day they finished the malt-house, I thought summat great was to come of it;
for we'd a plum-pudding that day and a bit of a feast, and I said to my mother,--she was a
fine dark-eyed woman, my mother was,--the little wench 'ull be as like her as two peas." Here
Mr. Tulliver put his stick between his legs, and took out his snuff-box, for the greater enjoyment
of this anecdote, which dropped from him in fragments, as if he every other moment lost narration
in vision. "I was a little chap no higher much than my mother's knee,--she was sore fond of
us children, Gritty and me,--and so I said to her, 'Mother,' I said, 'shall we have plum-pudding
every day because o' the malt-house? She used to tell me o' that till her dying day. She was
but a young woman when she died, my mother was. But it's forty good year since they finished
the malt-house, and it isn't many days out of 'em all as I haven't looked out into the yard
there, the first thing in the morning,--all weathers, from year's end to year's end. I should
go off my head in a new place. I should be like as if I'd lost my way. It's all hard, whichever
way I look at it,--the harness 'ull gall me, but it 'ud be summat to draw along the old road,
instead of a new un."

"Ay, sir," said Luke, "you'd be a deal better here nor in some new place. I can't abide new
places mysen: things is allays awk'ard,--narrow-wheeled waggins, belike, and the stiles all
another sort, an' oat-cake i' some places, tow'rt th' head o' the Floss, there. It's poor work,
changing your country-side."

"But I doubt, Luke, they'll be for getting rid o' Ben, and making you do with a lad; and I
must help a bit wi' the mill. You'll have a worse place."

"Ne'er mind, sir," said Luke, "I sha'n't plague mysen. I'n been wi' you twenty year, an' you
can't get twenty year wi' whistlin' for 'em, no more nor you can make the trees grow: you mun
wait till God A'mighty sends 'em. I can't abide new victual nor new faces, I can't,--you niver
know but what they'll gripe you."

The walk was finished in silence after this, for Luke had disburthened himself of thoughts
to an extent that left his conversational resources quite barren, and Mr. Tulliver had relapsed
from his recollections into a painful meditation on the choice of hardships before him. Maggie
noticed that he was unusually absent that evening at tea; and afterward he sat leaning forward
in his chair, looking at the ground, moving his lips, and shaking his head from time to time.
Then he looked hard at Mrs. Tulliver, who was knitting opposite him, then at Maggie, who, as
she bent over her sewing, was intensely conscious of some drama going forward in her father's
mind. Suddenly he took up the poker and broke the large coal fiercely.

"Dear heart, Mr. Tulliver, what can you be thinking of?" said his wife, looking up in alarm;
"it's very wasteful, breaking the coal, and we've got hardly any large coal left, and I don't
know where the rest is to come from."

"I don't think you're quite so well to-night, are you, father?" said Maggie; "you seem uneasy."

"Why, how is it Tom doesn't come?" said Mr. Tulliver, impatiently.

"Dear heart, is it time? I must go and get his supper," said Mrs. Tulliver, laying down her
knitting, and leaving the room.

"It's nigh upon half-past eight," said Mr. Tulliver. "He'll be here soon. Go, go and get the
big Bible, and open it at the beginning, where everything's set down. And get the pen and ink."

Maggie obeyed, wondering; but her father gave no further orders, and only sat listening for
Tom's footfall on the gravel, apparently irritated by the wind, which had risen, and was roaring
so as to drown all other sounds. There was a strange light in his eyes that rather frightened
Maggie; she began to wish that Tom would come, too.

"There he is, then," said Mr. Tulliver, in an excited way, when the knock came at last. Maggie
went to open the door, but her mother came out of the kitchen hurriedly, saying, "Stop a bit,
Maggie; I'll open it."

Mrs. Tulliver had begun to be a little frightened at her boy, but she was jealous of every
office others did for him.

"Your supper's ready by the kitchen-fire, my boy," she said, as he took off his hat and coat.
"You shall have it by yourself, just as you like, and I won't speak to you."

"I think my father wants Tom, mother," said Maggie; "he must come into the parlor first."

Tom entered with his usual saddened evening face, but his eyes fell immediately on the open
Bible and the inkstand, and he glanced with a look of anxious surprise at his father, who was
saying,--

"Come, come, you're late; I want you."

"Is there anything the matter, father?" said Tom.

"You sit down, all of you," said Mr. Tulliver, peremptorily.

"And, Tom, sit down here; I've got something for you to write i' the Bible."

They all three sat down, looking at him. He began to speak slowly, looking first at his wife.

"I've made up my mind, Bessy, and I'll be as good as my word to you. There'll be the same grave
made for us to lie down in, and we mustn't be bearing one another ill-will. I'll stop in the
old place, and I'll serve under Wakem, and I'll serve him like an honest man; there's no Tulliver
but what's honest, mind that, Tom,"--here his voice rose,--"they'll have it to throw up against
me as I paid a dividend, but it wasn't my fault; it was because there's raskills in the world.
They've been too many for me, and I must give in. I'll put my neck in harness,--for you've
a right to say as I've brought you into trouble, Bessy,--and I'll serve him as honest as if
he was no raskill; I'm an honest man, though I shall never hold my head up no more. I'm a tree
as is broke--a tree as is broke."

He paused and looked on the ground. Then suddenly raising his head, he said, in a louder yet
deeper tone:

"But I won't forgive him! I know what they say, he never meant me any harm. That's the way
Old Harry props up the rascals. He's been at the bottom of everything; but he's a fine gentleman,--I
know, I know. I shouldn't ha' gone to law, they say. But who made it so as there was no arbitratin',
and no justice to be got? It signifies nothing to him, I know that; he's one o' them fine gentlemen
as get money by doing business for poorer folks, and when he's made beggars of 'em he'll give
'em charity. I won't forgive him! I wish he might be punished with shame till his own son 'ud
like to forget him. I wish he may do summat as they'd make him work at the treadmill! But he
won't,--he's too big a raskill to let the law lay hold on him. And you mind this, Tom,--you
never forgive him neither, if you mean to be my son. There'll maybe come a time when you may
make him feel; it'll never come to me; I'n got my head under the yoke. Now write--write it
i' the Bible."

"Oh, father, what?" said Maggie, sinking down by his knee, pale and trembling. "It's wicked
to curse and bear malice."

"It isn't wicked, I tell you," said her father, fiercely. "It's wicked as the raskills should
prosper; it's the Devil's doing. Do as I tell you, Tom. Write."

"What am I to write?" said Tom, with gloomy submission.

"Write as your father, Edward Tulliver, took service under John Wakem, the man as had helped
to ruin him, because I'd promised my wife to make her what amends I could for her trouble,
and because I wanted to die in th' old place where I was born and my father was born. Put that
i' the right words--you know how--and then write, as I don't forgive Wakem for all that; and
for all I'll serve him honest, I wish evil may befall him. Write that."

There was a dead silence as Tom's pen moved along the paper; Mrs. Tulliver looked scared, and
Maggie trembled like a leaf.

"Now let me hear what you've wrote," said Mr. Tulliver, Tom read aloud slowly.

"Now write--write as you'll remember what Wakem's done to your father, and you'll make him
and his feel it, if ever the day comes. And sign your name Thomas Tulliver."

"Oh no, father, dear father!" said Maggie, almost choked with fear. "You shouldn't make Tom
write that."

"Be quiet, Maggie!" said Tom. "I shall write it."

Book IV

The Valley of Humiliation

Chapter I

A Variation of Protestantism Unknown to Bossuet

Journeying down the Rhone on a summer's day, you have perhaps felt the sunshine made dreary
by those ruined villages which stud the banks in certain parts of its course, telling how the
swift river once rose, like an angry, destroying god, sweeping down the feeble generations
whose breath is in their nostrils, and making their dwellings a desolation. Strange contrast,
you may have thought, between the effect produced on us by these dismal remnants of commonplace
houses, which in their best days were but the sign of a sordid life, belonging in all its details
to our own vulgar era, and the effect produced by those ruins on the castled Rhine, which have
crumbled and mellowed into such harmony with the green and rocky steeps that they seem to have
a natural fitness, like the mountain-pine; nay, even in the day when they were built they must
have had this fitness, as if they had been raised by an earth-born race, who had inherited
from their mighty parent a sublime instinct of form. And that was a day of romance; If those
robber-barons were somewhat grim and drunken ogres, they had a certain grandeur of the wild
beast in them,--they were forest boars with tusks, tearing and rending, not the ordinary domestic
grunter; they represented the demon forces forever in collision with beauty, virtue, and the
gentle uses of life; they made a fine contrast in the picture with the wandering minstrel,
the soft-lipped princess, the pious recluse, and the timid Israelite. That was a time of color,
when the sunlight fell on glancing steel and floating banners; a time of adventure and fierce
struggle,--nay, of living, religious art and religious enthusiasm; for were not cathedrals
built in those days, and did not great emperors leave their Western palaces to die before the
infidel strongholds in the sacred East? Therefore it is that these Rhine castles thrill me
with a sense of poetry; they belong to the grand historic life of humanity, and raise up for
me the vision of an echo. But these dead-tinted, hollow-eyed, angular skeletons of villages
on the Rhone oppress me with the feeling that human life--very much of it--is a narrow, ugly,
grovelling existence, which even calamity does not elevate, but rather tends to exhibit in
all its bare vulgarity of conception; and I have a cruel conviction that the lives these ruins
are the traces of were part of a gross sum of obscure vitality, that will be swept into the
same oblivion with the generations of ants and beavers.

Perhaps something akin to this oppressive feeling may have weighed upon you in watching this
old-fashioned family life on the banks of the Floss, which even sorrow hardly suffices to lift
above the level of the tragi-comic. It is a sordid life, you say, this of the Tullivers and
Dodsons, irradiated by no sublime principles, no romantic visions, no active, self-renouncing
faith; moved by none of those wild, uncontrollable passions which create the dark shadows of
misery and crime; without that primitive, rough simplicity of wants, that hard, submissive,
ill-paid toil, that childlike spelling-out of what nature has written, which gives its poetry
to peasant life. Here one has conventional worldly notions and habits without instruction and
without polish, surely the most prosaic form of human life; proud respectability in a gig of
unfashionable build; worldliness without side-dishes. Observing these people narrowly, even
when the iron hand of misfortune has shaken them from their unquestioning hold on the world,
one sees little trace of religion, still less of a distinctively Christian creed. Their belief
in the Unseen, so far as it manifests itself at all, seems to be rather a pagan kind; their
moral notions, though held with strong tenacity, seem to have no standard beyond hereditary
custom. You could not live among such people; you are stifled for want of an outlet toward
something beautiful, great, or noble; you are irritated with these dull men and women, as a
kind of population out of keeping with the earth on which they live,--with this rich plain
where the great river flows forever onward, and links the small pulse of the old English town
with the beatings of the world's mighty heart. A vigorous superstition, that lashes its gods
or lashes its own back, seems to be more congruous with the mystery of the human lot, than
the mental condition of these emmet-like Dodsons and Tullivers.

I share with you this sense of oppressive narrowness; but it is necessary that we should feel
it, if we care to understand how it acted on the lives of Tom and Maggie,--how it has acted
on young natures in many generations, that in the onward tendency of human things have risen
above the mental level of the generation before them, to which they have been nevertheless
tied by the strongest fibres of their hearts. The suffering, whether of martyr or victim, which
belongs to every historical advance of mankind, is represented in this way in every town, and
by hundreds of obscure hearths; and we need not shrink from this comparison of small things
with great; for does not science tell us that its highest striving is after the ascertainment
of a unity which shall bind the smallest things with the greatest? In natural science, I have
understood, there is nothing petty to the mind that has a large vision of relations, and to
which every single object suggests a vast sum of conditions. It is surely the same with the
observation of human life.

Certainly the religious and moral ideas of the Dodsons and Tullivers were of too specific a
kind to be arrived at deductively, from the statement that they were part of the Protestant
population of Great Britain. Their theory of life had its core of soundness, as all theories
must have on which decent and prosperous families have been reared and have flourished; but
it had the very slightest tincture of theology. If, in the maiden days of the Dodson sisters,
their Bibles opened more easily at some parts than others, it was because of dried tulip-petals,
which had been distributed quite impartially, without preference for the historical, devotional,
or doctrinal. Their religion was of a simple, semi-pagan kind, but there was no heresy in it,--if
heresy properly means choice,--for they didn't know there was any other religion, except that
of chapel-goers, which appeared to run in families, like asthma. How should they know? The
vicar of their pleasant rural parish was not a controversialist, but a good hand at whist,
and one who had a joke always ready for a blooming female parishioner. The religion of the
Dodsons consisted in revering whatever was customary and respectable; it was necessary to be
baptized, else one could not be buried in the church-yard, and to take the sacrament before
death, as a security against more dimly understood perils; but it was of equal necessity to
have the proper pall-bearers and well-cured hams at one's funeral, and to leave an unimpeachable
will. A Dodson would not be taxed with the omission of anything that was becoming, or that
belonged to that eternal fitness of things which was plainly indicated in the practice of the
most substantial parishioners, and in the family traditions,--such as obedience to parents,
faithfulness to kindred, industry, rigid honesty, thrift, the thorough scouring of wooden and
copper utensils, the hoarding of coins likely to disappear from the currency, the production
of first-rate commodities for the market, and the general preference of whatever was home-made.
The Dodsons were a very proud race, and their pride lay in the utter frustration of all desire
to tax them with a breach of traditional duty or propriety. A wholesome pride in many respects,
since it identified honor with perfect integrity, thoroughness of work, and faithfulness to
admitted rules; and society owes some worthy qualities in many of her members to mothers of
the Dodson class, who made their butter and their fromenty well, and would have felt disgraced
to make it otherwise. To be honest and poor was never a Dodson motto, still less to seem rich
though being poor; rather, the family badge was to be honest and rich, and not only rich, but
richer than was supposed. To live respected, and have the proper bearers at your funeral, was
an achievement of the ends of existence that would be entirely nullified if, on the reading
of your will, you sank in the opinion of your fellow-men, either by turning out to be poorer
than they expected, or by leaving your money in a capricious manner, without strict regard
to degrees of kin. The right thing must always be done toward kindred. The right thing was
to correct them severely, if they were other than a credit to the family, but still not to
alienate from them the smallest rightful share in the family shoebuckles and other property.
A conspicuous quality in the Dodson character was its genuineness; its vices and virtues alike
were phases of a proud honest egoism, which had a hearty dislike to whatever made against its
own credit and interest, and would be frankly hard of speech to inconvenient "kin," but would
never forsake or ignore them,--would not let them want bread, but only require them to eat
it with bitter herbs.

The same sort of traditional belief ran in the Tulliver veins, but it was carried in richer
blood, having elements of generous imprudence, warm affection, and hot-tempered rashness. Mr.
Tulliver's grandfather had been heard to say that he was descended from one Ralph Tulliver,
a wonderfully clever fellow, who had ruined himself. It is likely enough that the clever Ralph
was a high liver, rode spirited horses, and was very decidedly of his own opinion. On the other
hand, nobody had ever heard of a Dodson who had ruined himself; it was not the way of that family.

If such were the views of life on which the Dodsons and Tullivers had been reared in the praiseworthy
past of Pitt and high prices, you will infer from what you already know concerning the state
of society in St. Ogg's, that there had been no highly modifying influence to act on them in
their maturer life. It was still possible, even in that later time of anti-Catholic preaching,
for people to hold many pagan ideas, and believe themselves good church-people, notwithstanding;
so we need hardly feel any surprise at the fact that Mr. Tulliver, though a regular church-goer,
recorded his vindictiveness on the fly-leaf of his Bible. It was not that any harm could be
said concerning the vicar of that charming rural parish to which Dorlcote Mill belonged; he
was a man of excellent family, an irreproachable bachelor, of elegant pursuits,--had taken
honors, and held a fellowship. Mr. Tulliver regarded him with dutiful respect, as he did everything
else belonging to the church-service; but he considered that church was one thing and common-sense
another, and he wanted nobody to tell him what commonsense was. Certain seeds which are required
to find a nidus for themselves under unfavorable circumstances have been supplied by nature
with an apparatus of hooks, so that they will get a hold on very unreceptive surfaces. The
spiritual seed which had been scattered over Mr. Tulliver had apparently been destitute of
any corresponding provision, and had slipped off to the winds again, from a total absence of hooks.

Chapter II

The Torn Nest Is Pierced by the Thorns

There is something sustaining in the very agitation that accompanies the first shocks of trouble,
just as an acute pain is often a stimulus, and produces an excitement which is transient strength.
It is in the slow, changed life that follows; in the time when sorrow has become stale, and
has no longer an emotive intensity that counteracts its pain; in the time when day follows
day in dull, unexpectant sameness, and trial is a dreary routine,--it is then that despair
threatens; it is then that the peremptory hunger of the soul is felt, and eye and ear are strained
after some unlearned secret of our existence, which shall give to endurance the nature of satisfaction.

This time of utmost need was come to Maggie, with her short span of thirteen years. To the
usual precocity of the girl, she added that early experience of struggle, of conflict between
the inward impulse and outward fact, which is the lot of every imaginative and passionate nature;
and the years since she hammered the nails into her wooden Fetish among the worm-eaten shelves
of the attic had been filled with so eager a life in the triple world of Reality, Books, and
Waking Dreams, that Maggie was strangely old for her years in everything except in her entire
want of that prudence and self-command which were the qualities that made Tom manly in the
midst of his intellectual boyishness. And now her lot was beginning to have a still, sad monotony,
which threw her more than ever on her inward self. Her father was able to attend to business
again, his affairs were settled, and he was acting as Wakem's manager on the old spot. Tom
went to and fro every morning and evening, and became more and more silent in the short intervals
at home; what was there to say? One day was like another; and Tom's interest in life, driven
back and crushed on every other side, was concentrating itself into the one channel of ambitious
resistance to misfortune. The peculiarities of his father and mother were very irksome to him,
now they were laid bare of all the softening accompaniments of an easy, prosperous home; for
Tom had very clear, prosaic eyes, not apt to be dimmed by mists of feeling or imagination.
Poor Mrs. Tulliver, it seemed, would never recover her old self, her placid household activity;
how could she? The objects among which her mind had moved complacently were all gone,--all
the little hopes and schemes and speculations, all the pleasant little cares about her treasures
which had made the world quite comprehensible to her for a quarter of a century, since she
had made her first purchase of the sugar-tongs, had been suddenly snatched away from her, and
she remained bewildered in this empty life. Why that should have happened to her which had
not happened to other women remained an insoluble question by which she expressed her perpetual
ruminating comparison of the past with the present. It was piteous to see the comely woman
getting thinner and more worn under a bodily as well as mental restlessness, which made her
often wander about the empty house after her work was done, until Maggie, becoming alarmed
about her, would seek her, and bring her down by telling her how it vexed Tom that she was
injuring her health by never sitting down and resting herself. Yet amidst this helpless imbecility
there was a touching trait of humble, self-devoting maternity, which made Maggie feel tenderly
toward her poor mother amidst all the little wearing griefs caused by her mental feebleness.
She would let Maggie do none of the work that was heaviest and most soiling to the hands, and
was quite peevish when Maggie attempted to relieve her from her grate-brushing and scouring:
"Let it alone, my dear; your hands 'ull get as hard as hard," she would say; "it's your mother's
place to do that. I can't do the sewing--my eyes fail me." And she would still brush and carefully
tend Maggie's hair, which she had become reconciled to, in spite of its refusal to curl, now
it was so long and massy. Maggie was not her pet child, and, in general, would have been much
better if she had been quite different; yet the womanly heart, so bruised in its small personal
desires, found a future to rest on in the life of this young thing, and the mother pleased
herself with wearing out her own hands to save the hands that had so much more life in them.

But the constant presence of her mother's regretful bewilderment was less painful to Maggie
than that of her father's sullen, incommunicative depression. As long as the paralysis was
upon him, and it seemed as if he might always be in a childlike condition of dependence,--as
long as he was still only half awakened to his trouble,--Maggie had felt the strong tide of
pitying love almost as an inspiration, a new power, that would make the most difficult life
easy for his sake; but now, instead of childlike dependence, there had come a taciturn, hard
concentration of purpose, in strange contrast with his old vehement communicativeness and high
spirit; and this lasted from day to day, and from week to week, the dull eye never brightening
with any eagerness or any joy. It is something cruelly incomprehensible to youthful natures,
this sombre sameness in middle-aged and elderly people, whose life has resulted in disappointment
and discontent, to whose faces a smile becomes so strange that the sad lines all about the
lips and brow seem to take no notice of it, and it hurries away again for want of a welcome.
"Why will they not kindle up and be glad sometimes?" thinks young elasticity. "It would be
so easy if they only liked to do it." And these leaden clouds that never part are apt to create
impatience even in the filial affection that streams forth in nothing but tenderness and pity
in the time of more obvious affliction.

Mr. Tulliver lingered nowhere away from home; he hurried away from market, he refused all invitations
to stay and chat, as in old times, in the houses where he called on business. He could not
be reconciled with his lot. There was no attitude in which his pride did not feel its bruises;
and in all behavior toward him, whether kind or cold, he detected an allusion to the change
in his circumstances. Even the days on which Wakem came to ride round the land and inquire
into the business were not so black to him as those market-days on which he had met several
creditors who had accepted a composition from him. To save something toward the repayment of
those creditors was the object toward which he was now bending all his thoughts and efforts;
and under the influence of this all-compelling demand of his nature, the somewhat profuse man,
who hated to be stinted or to stint any one else in his own house, was gradually metamorphosed
into the keen-eyed grudger of morsels. Mrs. Tulliver could not economize enough to satisfy
him, in their food and firing; and he would eat nothing himself but what was of the coarsest
quality. Tom, though depressed and strongly repelled by his father's sullenness, and the dreariness
of home, entered thoroughly into his father's feelings about paying the creditors; and the
poor lad brought his first quarter's money, with a delicious sense of achievement, and gave
it to his father to put into the tin box which held the savings. The little store of sovereigns
in the tin box seemed to be the only sight that brought a faint beam of pleasure into the miller's
eyes,--faint and transient, for it was soon dispelled by the thought that the time would be
long--perhaps longer than his life,--before the narrow savings could remove the hateful incubus
of debt. A deficit of more than five hundred pounds, with the accumulating interest, seemed
a deep pit to fill with the savings from thirty shillings a-week, even when Tom's probable
savings were to be added. On this one point there was entire community of feeling in the four
widely differing beings who sat round the dying fire of sticks, which made a cheap warmth for
them on the verge of bedtime. Mrs. Tulliver carried the proud integrity of the Dodsons in her
blood, and had been brought up to think that to wrong people of their money, which was another
phrase for debt, was a sort of moral pillory; it would have been wickedness, to her mind, to
have run counter to her husband's desire to "do the right thing," and retrieve his name. She
had a confused, dreamy notion that, if the creditors were all paid, her plate and linen ought
to come back to her; but she had an inbred perception that while people owed money they were
unable to pay, they couldn't rightly call anything their own. She murmured a little that Mr.
Tulliver so peremptorily refused to receive anything in repayment from Mr. and Mrs. Moss; but
to all his requirements of household economy she was submissive to the point of denying herself
the cheapest indulgences of mere flavor; her only rebellion was to smuggle into the kitchen
something that would make rather a better supper than usual for Tom.

These narrow notions about debt, held by the old fashioned Tullivers, may perhaps excite a
smile on the faces of many readers in these days of wide commercial views and wide philosophy,
according to which everything rights itself without any trouble of ours. The fact that my tradesman
is out of pocket by me is to be looked at through the serene certainty that somebody else's
tradesman is in pocket by somebody else; and since there must be bad debts in the world, why,
it is mere egoism not to like that we in particular should make them instead of our fellow-citizens.
I am telling the history of very simple people, who had never had any illuminating doubts as
to personal integrity and honor.

Under all this grim melancholy and narrowing concentration of desire, Mr. Tulliver retained
the feeling toward his "little wench" which made her presence a need to him, though it would
not suffice to cheer him. She was still the desire of his eyes; but the sweet spring of fatherly
love was now mingled with bitterness, like everything else. When Maggie laid down her work
at night, it was her habit to get a low stool and sit by her father's knee, leaning her cheek
against it. How she wished he would stroke her head, or give some sign that he was soothed
by the sense that he had a daughter who loved him! But now she got no answer to her little
caresses, either from her father or from Tom,--the two idols of her life. Tom was weary and
abstracted in the short intervals when he was at home, and her father was bitterly preoccupied
with the thought that the girl was growing up, was shooting up into a woman; and how was she
to do well in life? She had a poor chance for marrying, down in the world as they were. And
he hated the thought of her marrying poorly, as her aunt Gritty had done; that would be a thing
to make him turn in his grave,--the little wench so pulled down by children and toil, as her
aunt Moss was. When uncultured minds, confined to a narrow range of personal experience, are
under the pressure of continued misfortune, their inward life is apt to become a perpetually
repeated round of sad and bitter thoughts; the same words, the same scenes, are revolved over
and over again, the same mood accompanies them; the end of the year finds them as much what
they were at the beginning as if they were machines set to a recurrent series of movements.

The sameness of the days was broken by few visitors. Uncles and aunts paid only short visits
now; of course, they could not stay to meals, and the constraint caused by Mr. Tulliver's savage
silence, which seemed to add to the hollow resonance of the bare, uncarpeted room when the
aunts were talking, heightened the unpleasantness of these family visits on all sides, and
tended to make them rare. As for other acquaintances, there is a chill air surrounding those
who are down in the world, and people are glad to get away from them, as from a cold room;
human beings, mere men and women, without furniture, without anything to offer you, who have
ceased to count as anybody, present an embarrassing negation of reasons for wishing to see
them, or of subjects on which to converse with them. At that distant day, there was a dreary
isolation in the civilized Christian society of these realms for families that had dropped
below their original level, unless they belonged to a sectarian church, which gets some warmth
of brotherhood by walling in the sacred fire.

Chapter III

A Voice from the Past

One afternoon, when the chestnuts were coming into flower, Maggie had brought her chair outside
the front door, and was seated there with a book on her knees. Her dark eyes had wandered from
the book, but they did not seem to be enjoying the sunshine which pierced the screen of jasmine
on the projecting porch at her right, and threw leafy shadows on her pale round cheek; they
seemed rather to be searching for something that was not disclosed by the sunshine. It had
been a more miserable day than usual; her father, after a visit of Wakem's had had a paroxysm
of rage, in which for some trifling fault he had beaten the boy who served in the mill. Once
before, since his illness, he had had a similar paroxysm, in which he had beaten his horse,
and the scene had left a lasting terror in Maggie's mind. The thought had risen, that some
time or other he might beat her mother if she happened to speak in her feeble way at the wrong
moment. The keenest of all dread with her was lest her father should add to his present misfortune
the wretchedness of doing something irretrievably disgraceful. The battered school-book of
Tom's which she held on her knees could give her no fortitude under the pressure of that dread;
and again and again her eyes had filled with tears, as they wandered vaguely, seeing neither
the chestnut-trees, nor the distant horizon, but only future scenes of home-sorrow.

Suddenly she was roused by the sound of the opening gate and of footsteps on the gravel. It
was not Tom who was entering, but a man in a sealskin cap and a blue plush waistcoat, carrying
a pack on his back, and followed closely by a bullterrier of brindled coat and defiant aspect.

"Oh, Bob, it's you!" said Maggie, starting up with a smile of pleased recognition, for there
had been no abundance of kind acts to efface the recollection of Bob's generosity; "I'm so
glad to see you."

"Thank you, Miss," said Bob, lifting his cap and showing a delighted face, but immediately
relieving himself of some accompanying embarrassment by looking down at his dog, and saying
in a tone of disgust, "Get out wi' you, you thunderin' sawney!"

"My brother is not at home yet, Bob," said Maggie; "he is always at St. Ogg's in the daytime."

"Well, Miss," said Bob, "I should be glad to see Mr. Tom, but that isn't just what I'm come
for,--look here!"

Bob was in the act of depositing his pack on the door-step, and with it a row of small books
fastened together with string.

Apparently, however, they were not the object to which he wished to call Maggie's attention,
but rather something which he had carried under his arm, wrapped in a red handkerchief.

"See here!" he said again, laying the red parcel on the others and unfolding it; "you won't
think I'm a-makin' too free, Miss, I hope, but I lighted on these books, and I thought they
might make up to you a bit for them as you've lost; for I heared you speak o' picturs,--an'
as for picturs, look here!"

The opening of the red handkerchief had disclosed a superannuated "Keepsake" and six or seven
numbers of a "Portrait Gallery," in royal octavo; and the emphatic request to look referred
to a portrait of George the Fourth in all the majesty of his depressed cranium and voluminous
neckcloth.

"There's all sorts o' genelmen here," Bob went on, turning over the leaves with some excitement,
"wi' all sorts o' nones,--an' some bald an' some wi' wigs,--Parlament genelmen, I reckon. An'
here," he added, opening the "Keepsake,"--"here's ladies for you, some wi' curly hair and some
wi' smooth, an' some a-smiling wi' their heads o' one side, an' some as if they were goin'
to cry,--look here,--a-sittin' on the ground out o' door, dressed like the ladies I'n seen
get out o' the carriages at the balls in th' Old Hall there. My eyes! I wonder what the chaps
wear as go a-courtin' 'em! I sot up till the clock was gone twelve last night, a-lookin' at
'em,--I did,--till they stared at me out o' the picturs as if they'd know when I spoke to 'em.
But, lors! I shouldn't know what to say to 'em. They'll be more fittin' company for you, Miss;
and the man at the book-stall, he said they banged iverything for picturs; he said they was
a fust-rate article."

"And you've bought them for me, Bob?" said Maggie, deeply touched by this simple kindness.
"How very, very good of you! But I'm afraid you gave a great deal of money for them."

"Not me!" said Bob. "I'd ha' gev three times the money if they'll make up to you a bit for
them as was sold away from you, Miss. For I'n niver forgot how you looked when you fretted
about the books bein' gone; it's stuck by me as if it was a pictur hingin' before me. An' when
I see'd the book open upo' the stall, wi' the lady lookin' out of it wi' eyes a bit like your'n
when you was frettin',--you'll excuse my takin' the liberty, Miss,--I thought I'd make free
to buy it for you, an' then I bought the books full o' genelmen to match; an' then"--here Bob
took up the small stringed packet of books--"I thought you might like a bit more print as well
as the picturs, an' I got these for a sayso,--they're cram-full o' print, an' I thought they'd
do no harm comin' along wi' these bettermost books. An' I hope you won't say me nay, an' tell
me as you won't have 'em, like Mr. Tom did wi' the suvreigns."

"No, indeed, Bob," said Maggie, "I'm very thankful to you for thinking of me, and being so
good to me and Tom. I don't think any one ever did such a kind thing for me before. I haven't
many friends who care for me."

"Hev a dog, Miss!--they're better friends nor any Christian," said Bob, laying down his pack
again, which he had taken up with the intention of hurrying away; for he felt considerable
shyness in talking to a young lass like Maggie, though, as he usually said of himself, "his
tongue overrun him" when he began to speak. "I can't give you Mumps, 'cause he'd break his
heart to go away from me--eh, Mumps, what do you say, you riff-raff?" (Mumps declined to express
himself more diffusely than by a single affirmative movement of his tail.) "But I'd get you
a pup, Miss, an' welcome."

"No, thank you, Bob. We have a yard dog, and I mayn't keep a dog of my own."

"Eh, that's a pity; else there's a pup,--if you didn't mind about it not being thoroughbred;
its mother acts in the Punch show,--an uncommon sensible bitch; she means more sense wi' her
bark nor half the chaps can put into their talk from breakfast to sundown. There's one chap
carries pots,--a poor, low trade as any on the road,--he says, 'Why Toby's nought but a mongrel;
there's nought to look at in her.' But I says to him, 'Why, what are you yoursen but a mongrel?
There wasn't much pickin' o' your feyther an' mother, to look at you.' Not but I like a bit
o' breed myself, but I can't abide to see one cur grinnin' at another. I wish you good evenin',
Miss," said Bob, abruptly taking up his pack again, under the consciousness that his tongue
was acting in an undisciplined manner.

"Won't you come in the evening some time, and see my brother, Bob?" said Maggie.

"Yes, Miss, thank you--another time. You'll give my duty to him, if you please. Eh, he's a
fine growed chap, Mr. Tom is; he took to growin' i' the legs, an' I didn't."

The pack was down again, now, the hook of the stick having somehow gone wrong.

"You don't call Mumps a cur, I suppose?" said Maggie, divining that any interest she showed
in Mumps would be gratifying to his master.

"No, Miss, a fine way off that," said Bob, with pitying smile; "Mumps is as fine a cross as
you'll see anywhere along the Floss, an' I'n been up it wi' the barge times enow. Why, the
gentry stops to look at him; but you won't catch Mumps a-looking at the gentry much,--he minds
his own business, he does."

The expression of Mump's face, which seemed to be tolerating the superfluous existence of objects
in general, was strongly confirmatory of this high praise.

"He looks dreadfully surly," said Maggie. "Would he let me pat him?"

"Ay, that would he, and thank you. He knows his company, Mumps does. He isn't a dog as 'ull
be caught wi' gingerbread; he'd smell a thief a good deal stronger nor the gingerbread, he
would. Lors, I talk to him by th' hour together, when I'm walking i' lone places, and if I'n
done a bit o' mischief, I allays tell him. I'n got no secrets but what Mumps knows 'em. He
knows about my big thumb, he does."

"Your big thumb--what's that, Bob?" said Maggie.

"That's what it is, Miss," said Bob, quickly, exhibiting a singularly broad specimen of that
difference between the man and the monkey. "It tells i' measuring out the flannel, you see.
I carry flannel, 'cause it's light for my pack, an' it's dear stuff, you see, so a big thumb
tells. I clap my thumb at the end o' the yard and cut o' the hither side of it, and the old
women aren't up to't."

"But Bob," said Maggie, looking serious, "that's cheating; I don't like to hear you say that."

"Don't you, Miss?" said Bob regretfully. "Then I'm sorry I said it. But I'm so used to talking
to Mumps, an' he doesn't mind a bit o' cheating, when it's them skinflint women, as haggle
an' haggle, an' 'ud like to get their flannel for nothing, an' 'ud niver ask theirselves how
I got my dinner out on't. I niver cheat anybody as doesn't want to cheat me, Miss,--lors, I'm
a honest chap, I am; only I must hev a bit o' sport, an' now I don't go wi' th' ferrets, I'n
got no varmint to come over but them haggling women. I wish you good evening, Miss."

"Good-by, Bob. Thank you very much for bringing me the books. And come again to see Tom."

"Yes, Miss," said Bob, moving on a few steps; then turning half round he said, "I'll leave
off that trick wi' my big thumb, if you don't think well on me for it, Miss; but it 'ud be
a pity, it would. I couldn't find another trick so good,--an' what 'ud be the use o' havin'
a big thumb? It might as well ha' been narrow."

Maggie, thus exalted into Bob's exalting Madonna, laughed in spite of herself; at which her
worshipper's blue eyes twinkled too, and under these favoring auspices he touched his cap and
walked away.

The days of chivalry are not gone, notwithstanding Burke's grand dirge over them; they live
still in that far-off worship paid by many a youth and man to the woman of whom he never dreams
that he shall touch so much as her little finger or the hem of her robe. Bob, with the pack
on his back, had as respectful an adoration for this dark-eyed maiden as if he had been a knight
in armor calling aloud on her name as he pricked on to the fight.

That gleam of merriment soon died away from Maggie's face, and perhaps only made the returning
gloom deeper by contrast. She was too dispirited even to like answering questions about Bob's
present of books, and she carried them away to her bedroom, laying them down there and seating
herself on her one stool, without caring to look at them just yet. She leaned her cheek against
the window-frame, and thought that the light-hearted Bob had a lot much happier than hers.

Maggie's sense of loneliness, and utter privation of joy, had deepened with the brightness
of advancing spring. All the favorite outdoor nooks about home, which seemed to have done their
part with her parents in nurturing and cherishing her, were now mixed up with the home-sadness,
and gathered no smile from the sunshine. Every affection, every delight the poor child had
had, was like an aching nerve to her. There was no music for her any more,--no piano, no harmonized
voices, no delicious stringed instruments, with their passionate cries of imprisoned spirits
sending a strange vibration through her frame. And of all her school-life there was nothing
left her now but her little collection of school-books, which she turned over with a sickening
sense that she knew them all, and they were all barren of comfort. Even at school she had often
wished for books with more in them; everything she learned there seemed like the ends of long
threads that snapped immediately. And now--without the indirect charm of school-emulation--Télémaque
was mere bran; so were the hard, dry questions on Christian Doctrine; there was no flavor in
them, no strength. Sometimes Maggie thought she could have been contented with absorbing fancies;
if she could have had all Scott's novels and all Byron's poems!--then, perhaps, she might have
found happiness enough to dull her sensibility to her actual daily life. And yet they were
hardly what she wanted. She could make dream-worlds of her own, but no dream-world would satisfy
her now. She wanted some explanation of this hard, real life,--the unhappy-looking father,
seated at the dull breakfast-table; the childish, bewildered mother; the little sordid tasks
that filled the hours, or the more oppressive emptiness of weary, joyless leisure; the need
of some tender, demonstrative love; the cruel sense that Tom didn't mind what she thought or
felt, and that they were no longer playfellows together; the privation of all pleasant things
that had come to her more than to others,--she wanted some key that would enable her to understand,
and in understanding, to endure, the heavy weight that had fallen on her young heart. If she
had been taught "real learning and wisdom, such as great men knew," she thought she should
have held the secrets of life; if she had only books, that she might learn for herself what
wise men knew! Saints and martyrs had never interested Maggie so much as sages and poets. She
knew little of saints and martyrs, and had gathered, as a general result of her teaching, that
they were a temporary provision against the spread of Catholicism, and had all died at Smithfield.

In one of these meditations it occurred to her that she had forgotten Tom's school-books, which
had been sent home in his trunk. But she found the stock unaccountably shrunk down to the few
old ones which had been well thumbed,--the Latin Dictionary and Grammar, a Delectus, a torn
Eutropius, the well-worn Virgil, Aldrich's Logic, and the exasperating Euclid. Still, Latin,
Euclid, and Logic would surely be a considerable step in masculine wisdom,--in that knowledge
which made men contented, and even glad to live. Not that the yearning for effectual wisdom
was quite unmixed; a certain mirage would now and then rise on the desert of the future, in
which she seemed to see herself honored for her surprising attainments. And so the poor child,
with her soul's hunger and her illusions of self-flattery, began to nibble at this thick-rinded
fruit of the tree of knowledge, filling her vacant hours with Latin, geometry, and the forms
of the syllogism, and feeling a gleam of triumph now and then that her understanding was quite
equal to these peculiarly masculine studies. For a week or two she went on resolutely enough,
though with an occasional sinking of heart, as if she had set out toward the Promised Land
alone, and found it a thirsty, trackless, uncertain journey. In the severity of her early resolution,
she would take Aldrich out into the fields, and then look off her book toward the sky, where
the lark was twinkling, or to the reeds and bushes by the river, from which the waterfowl rustled
forth on its anxious, awkward flight,--with a startled sense that the relation between Aldrich
and this living world was extremely remote for her. The discouragement deepened as the days
went on, and the eager heart gained faster and faster on the patient mind. Somehow, when she
sat at the window with her book, her eyes would fix themselves blankly on the outdoor sunshine;
then they would fill with tears, and sometimes, if her mother was not in the room, the studies
would all end in sobbing. She rebelled against her lot, she fainted under its loneliness, and
fits even of anger and hatred toward her father and mother, who were so unlike what she would
have them to be; toward Tom, who checked her, and met her thought or feeling always by some
thwarting difference,--would flow out over her affections and conscience like a lava stream,
and frighten her with a sense that it was not difficult for her to become a demon. Then her
brain would be busy with wild romances of a flight from home in search of something less sordid
and dreary; she would go to some great man--Walter Scott, perhaps--and tell him how wretched
and how clever she was, and he would surely do something for her. * * * * But the singers were
so well pleased with the exercise that they were apt to prolong it, as my uncle thought, somewhat
unduly, and on such occasions he would cut the performance short with a rasping 'That's enough!'
which effectually brought it to an abrupt conclusion. The very short sermon * * * having been
brought to an end, my uncle would sing out to the Vicar, as he was
descending the pulpit stairs, 'Come up to dinner, Skinner!' and then
we all marched out while the rustics, still retaining their places
till we were fairly out of the door, made their obeisances as we passed."

In

this glimpse we miss the genial face of Sir Roger, but there is nothing in it inconsistent with the
village squire of the Spectator, Indeed, Mr. Trollope says of the old squire, "He was a good
man too, was old Adolphus Meetkerke; a good landlord, a kindly natured man, a good sportsman, an
active magistrate, and a good husband."

He was evidently a regular attendant to his magisterial duties on the Royston Bench, for his
clean, linear, and well-written signature turns up frequently in the Royston parish books.
The Meetkerkes descended from a famous Dutchman, Sir Adolphus Meetkerke, who was at one time
ambassador to England.

{124}

Before the Tithe Commutation Act was passed, a very curious piece of work in the harvest field
was the paying of the parson by the tithe man going round among the shocks of corn and placing
a green bough in every tenth shock, &c., for then the tithe was collected in kind--the tenth
shock, hay-cock, calf, lamb, pig, fowl, pigeon, duck, egg, the tenth pound of butter, cheese,
and so on through all the products of the land.

The inconvenience of this clumsy system was often greatly felt, when a farmer was compelled
to delay the carting of his corn simply because the tithe man had not been round to set out the
tithe corn, while on the other hand it was obviously impossible for the clergyman to get the
work all done at once to suit all parties, and thus when a Commutation Act came it was a great
relief alike to the clergyman and the farmers and landowners, and did away with a longstanding
cause of strife and litigation, especially in a town like Royston, where a farmer might have
tithable produce in several parishes.

Sometimes the tithe owner found an attempt to impose upon him some of the lean kine, and that
the tenth of its kind had a way of differing somewhat from the other nine! When, for instance, in
the last century, Canon Weston was away in Durham, his curate, at Therfield, on going to Brandish
to tithe the ringe-wood, found the woodman over anxious for him to begin counting at a certain
spot, where the cutting commenced, but suspecting that the ringes had been cooked a little, the
wily curate examined them and found every tenth, from the woodman's way of counting fell upon
a very thin ringe! Remonstrances followed and the "tenths" were made up to the same condition
of plumpness as the rest, and the curate received the commendation of his superior for so well
looking after his affairs!

Since the date to which the foregoing state of things refers, the Established Church has had an
awakening which has taken a real hold upon and has been influenced by the laity, and has recognised
that it has a mission to the people rather than an official routine, facts which are not without
significance in their bearing upon what follows with regard to the town of Royston, and the
relative positions of the Church and Dissenting bodies.

A hundred years ago the Nonconformists included most of the wealthy families in the town and
neighbourhood. The pulpit at the Old Meeting (Independents) erected in the narrow part of Kneesworth
Street in 1706 was occupied at least once a year by Robert Hall,
the great Baptist preacher then at Cambridge, who was a not unfrequent
visitor at the houses of Edward King Fordham, the banker, and William
Nash, the lawyer.

One of the principal events in the religious life of the town at the end of last century was the
division of the congregation of Independents at the Old Meeting.

{125}

The origin of the New Meeting, as it was called, was a very small one, and does not look at first
like a very serious split in the old congregation. An old paper, still in existence, written
apparently and read at the opening of the New Meeting, states that "in the year 1791 a few of
us met at a friend's house a few weeks for prayer and the reading of the Word of God; our numbers
soon increased and then we met in a barn for a considerable time. We went on till the year
1792, and our numbers still increasing we erected this meeting." At this time the Rev. Mr. Atkinson
was the minister. It is evident, however, that the new movement grew apace, and some interest
began to be taken in it in the town, for on 24th February, 1791, we find J. Butler laying J. Beldam
a bottle of wine "that the New Meeting House will be begun in six
months at Royston."

Evidently Mr. Butler won his bottle of wine, for on the 2nd of May, in the same year, the contract
for the new building, to be afterwards known as the "New Meeting" (Kneesworth Street) was signed.

It
is interesting to note the plain, inexpensive kind of building which suited persons assembling
for public worship compared with to-day, for the amount of the contract for erecting the building
"in a workman-like manner" was only L320. This contract was between John Stamford, carpenter and
builder, on the one part, and on the other part the following gentlemen who were the first
trustees:--Samuel Luke, of Royston, Cambs., maltster; William Stamford, Royston, Herts., maltster;
George Fordham, the elder, and George Fordham, the younger, both of Kelshall, gentlemen; Robert
Hankin, Royston, Cambs., draper; Thomas Wells, Royston, Herts., grocer; Thomas Trigg, Bassingbourn,
yeoman; Samuel Walbey, Royston, Cambs., maltster; William Coxall, Bassingbourn, gentleman; John
Abbott, Royston, Herts., breeches-maker; Abraham Luke, Royston, Cambs., yeoman; and John Goode,
Royston, Herts., carpenter.

It was for a lath and plaster structure without galleries, and was opened apparently in 1792.

The
Old and New Independents continued to work side by side, the new overtaking the old, till 1841, when
a serious fire happening on the premises of Mr. Warren, builder, near the site of the present
John Street Chapel, advantage was taken of the opening thus made, and the site was purchased
for a new Chapel from Mr. John Phillips, who, at the same time, by pulling down part of the
premises facing High Street, threw open the present thoroughfare, which henceforth obtained
the name of John Street, after Mr. Phillips. The new Chapel, erected on the north side, was built
by Mr. Warren, at a cost of between three and four thousand pounds,
and re-placed the old chapel in Kneesworth Street, which afterwards
became converted into dwelling-houses (Mr. Higgins' shop and houses
adjoining).

The new Chapel, opened in {126} 1843 by the Rev. Dr. Binney, as preacher on the first Sunday,
and Edward Miall, who afterwards became the Liberationist M.P., on the next, has an imposing
front elevation which it may be of interest to state is taken from the celebrated Ionic Temple
on the south bank of the Ilissus at Athens.

The last meeting house of the Society of Friends in Royston was in Royston, Cambs., on the East
side of Kneesworth Street, the burial ground of which still remains, with tombstones to the
memory of Quaker families of former days. The old meeting house stood back from the street,
reached by a narrow passage between the cottages, with the small burial ground and a row of
lime trees in front.

During the first quarter of the century a house in the yard behind Mr. Hinkins' shop was registered
"for preaching in the Calvinistic persuasion of Dissenters in Royston, Hertfordshire"; for
so runs the written application to the magistrates for the place to be registered as a preaching
place.

Something of the old Puritanic feeling still prevailed in the town among the Dissenters against
amusements as late as the end of the first quarter of the present century. Whether it was from
the recollection of what popular amusements had been, or against worldliness in general, I
know not, but there is a curious instance on record, where, in 1825, a townsman named Johnson, had
his membership at the New Meeting called in question for having joined a cricket club in the town!
The offending member defended himself from what he considered the injustice of expulsion,
by stating that he saw no evil in cricket, and that the members of the club were "moral men,"
and that ministers and others had been known to join cricket clubs. The general body of members
in meeting assembled, however, refused to relax their view of it, and decided upon his expulsion,
but afterwards relented so far as to allow Brother Johnson to resign, which he did.

Political meetings belonged more to large centres than they do now--chiefly to the county town--but
lest there should be any doubt about what was the prevailing political bias in the town during
the first quarter of the century, it has been placed on record that Royston was called "Radical
Royston." This soubriquet was probably earned by the large amount of "reforming" spirit which we have
seen was thrown into the discussion of abstract questions by Roystonians of the time. They
probably earned it by their protests rather than by their policy. Politics in public meeting
were in fact in a bad way at the end of the reign of George III., when it was made unlawful
for anyone to call a public meeting exceeding fifty persons, for the purpose of deliberating upon
any public question excepting such meetings were called by the Lord Lieutenant, Sheriff, Mayor,
or other officials responsible for good order.

{127}

When George IV. came to the throne and divided the opinion of the country upon the subject of
his treatment of Queen Caroline, the boys shared the prevailing differences of sentiment and became
"Kingites" or "Queenites," and occasionally settled their differences in pitched battles after
the manner of boys in all ages, in some cases actually wearing their colours--purple for the
King and white for the Queen. The prevailing sentiment was, however, in Royston so much for the
Queen, that "the first gentleman in Europe," notwithstanding his patronage of and comrades
in the prize-fighting ring, could hardly find enough champions for a fight, even among the boys.

In
later years Chartism reached Royston and caused a flutter in the breasts of those concerned
with the status quo, for it appears that one Joseph Peat had "held forth" by permission of the landlord
at the "Coach and Horses." The Magistrates had a meeting to prevent the spread of Chartism in
consequence of this event, and the landlord was sent for and cautioned that if he allowed such
a thing again he would lose his licence.

The beginning of all positive work set about by negative process is slow, and this, I suppose,
would apply to keeping outside a public-house, for the Teetotal folk in Royston--handicapped,
as in other places, by a name that has ever prejudiced and hampered a public movement--found out
this to their cost.

They did not lack stimulants when they first began to hold meetings, for the opposition camp
came to the meeting, took care to come provided, and, fortifying themselves with bottles of
beer, raised so much clamour that the recently enrolled policeman
had to try his hand at checking intemperance and some broken heads
rewarded his exertions.

The publicans generally attended the meetings in good force and between the rival parties, instead
of applause there was sometimes breaking of windows if nothing worse. The British School was
one of the first public rooms used for these meetings.

Of popular entertainments, as we now understand them, there were very few, not one where we now
have a score, and until the erection of the British School no suitable building. It must not,
however, be supposed that the town was entirely without the means of occasional recreation. The
Assembly Room at the Red Lion was still a place of importance for public assemblies, and, for
some years before Queen Victoria came to the throne, this room was the scene of some creditable
displays of local talent. This talent took the thespian form, and the tradesmen of the town,
banded together as the Royston Theatrical Amateur Society, were accustomed
to draw the elite of the town and neighbourhood into 3s. and 2s.

6d. seats (nothing less!) while they placed on the boards a rattling good version of Bombastes
Furioso and other pieces in popular favour at the time.

{128}

Reference has been made to the reluctance of the Parish Authorities--once bitten, twice shy--to
let the Parish Room again as a School after the legal difficulty about getting rid of the tenant,
but to their credit be it said they made an exception in favour of music--with a proviso. The late
Mr. James Richardson, when a young man, it is on record, applied to the Parish Authorities "on
behalf of several persons forming a Musical Band of this Town, that they may be allowed the
use of the Vestry Room to meet and practise in." "Allowed providing they pay the constable to
attend and see that everything is left secure and to prevent the boys annoying them or doing mischief
to the premises."

Music, though confined to a few choice spirits beneath fustian and
smock frocks in village as well as town, played a much more important
part with our grandfathers than is commonly supposed.

It may seem a rash statement to make that in some respects we may have degenerated. If we play
or sing with better tune or finish it is because we have better appliances, not better brains
nor more devoted hearts for music. I am afraid that some of our extensive cultivation of music
is a sacrifice of fond parents on the altar of the proprieties, whereas
our grandfathers had a soul in their work, and the man with his heart
in his work--whether scraping a fiddle, ploughing a furrow, writing
an epic, or fighting a battle--must, by all honest men, be awarded
the palm.

In this over-riding of music as a hobby there is a danger that the salt may lose its savour,
for if there is any individual more to be pitied than another it is the so-called musician
standing up to play according to the rules of art with no response
from the inmost soul of him.

I do not think, at any rate, that those of our grandfathers who directed their attention to the fiddle,
bass-viol, flute, clarionet, or trombone, could be fairly considered to lay under such reproach,
for though their music may have been sometimes flat and sometimes sharp, it was always natural
and congenial in the highest degree.

These old fellows took down such instruments as they had, not as so
many do now, because it was "the thing" to learn music, but because
music had found them out for having a love of it, and of the pleasure
derived from meeting in a homely circle of kindred spirits.

Their instruments were often most dissimilar, but their spirit was
one!

There was a good deal of free masonry and companionable relations existing between these old handlers
of musical instruments, and as we hear them in imagination, rattling away round the old spirited
fugues which had been carefully "picked out" with quill pen and ink into their old cheque-book
shaped "tune books"; or, as we see the picturesque group, now with countenances beaming with delight
over some well turned corner which brought up the rear, now mopping their {129} brows with a
bright red handkerchief, or touching up the old fiddle, after a smart finish, as a man pats
a favourite horse, it is not difficult to discover how it was that
here and there, and in many places, music took care of itself so well
when other things were at a low ebb!

Saxhorn, trombone, flute, cornopean, clarionet, bassoon, fiddle, bass-viol, and others as various
as the dress, trades, and characters of the individuals, made up the old chords of long ago;
so well hit off by a writer (J. W. Riley) in the Century Magazine:--

I make no doubt yer new band now's a competenter band, And plays their music more by note than
what they play by hand, And stylisher, and grander tunes; but somehow--any way I want to hear
the old band play!

These old players on instruments were nearly always found in the Church or Chapel Choirs. Thus
in the early years of the century John Warren performed the double duty of bass-viol player and
parish clerk at the Royston Church, and later on a rather full band of instruments led the service.
A similar, but less organized state of things was found in some village Churches. It was the
time when the wooden pitch-pipe was in its full glory. This was a square wooden implement, with
a scale on one of its sides, upon which the leader blew the key-note, and then running up the
octave with his voice--off they went to the tune of some old Calcutta, Cardiff, or other piece
of arduous fugal work!

The disappearance of these old village choirs, in which the village blacksmith, the baker, the tailor,
and other natives played on the clarionet, bass-viol, bassoon, flute, trombone, and all kinds
of instruments, while other grown-up men took their "parts" in those
wonderful old fugues that seemed to make the song of praise without
end--the absence of all this means a certain loss of that passion
for music which has never been thoroughly recovered!

We have many more players and singers now than in the past, but not, perhaps, the same proportion
of lovers of music for its own sake.

Among winter recreations skating was hardly known, and not at all as an amusement for ladies, but
then what a glorious pastime was that of sliding! Very few young people can slide on the ice
now as the boy in 1800-20 could do. In summer cricket was played, but, as in all the multiplied
facilities for acquiring skill and knowledge, to-day the youthful cricketers have the best of
tools, while their grandfathers had a home-made bat, or even a pale, and as for stumps, they generally
grew in the neighbouring hedge till wanted, and the scoring book, in the form of a notched stick,
came from the same quarter! But even at that time some "grand matches" sometimes came off,
and nearly always for high stakes, as the following notice will show.

The earliest announcement of a grand match in this district, I have met with, is the following
for the year 1771--

"Tuesday, se'n night, a match at Cricket was played between the gentlemen of Saffron Walden and Stanstead
Abbots, for 44 guineas, when the latter were bungle beat, that is, 51 notches in one innings."

What
is the precise meaning which the old chronicler meant to attach to the phrase "bungle beat" in
this instance, I must leave to lovers of the game to determine for themselves. But it was customary
to play for much higher stakes than the above. Thus, in the memorable year of scarcity of
1801 when people were longing for the deliverance of harvest--

"A cricket match was played at Stanstead Marsh, Herts., between 11 gentlemen of Homerton and
11 of Stanstead, for 500 guineas. The Homerton side won by 15 runs."

Another thing these old cricketers did which may be commended to the modern clubs--they set
about the game as if they meant to finish it. "Stumps to be pitched at nine o'clock" says the
announcement of a fifty-guinea match between Hertford and Hoddesdon in 1812. I have found no
record of a match of this description for high stakes on Royston Heath, but cricket was undoubtedly
played there, especially a few years later than the above dates.
{131}

Of other forms of sport, the meets of Squire Wortham's harriers
were notable events, and especially on such occasions as "The Little
Fair Day"--the second day of Royston Fair--when they were taken to
the top of the "One Hill" on the Heath, where the meet attracted not
only a large number of the regular followers of the hounds, but a
great many irregular ones as well; and, under the management of "Old
Matt," the huntsman, with the stentorian voice, whose holloa could
be heard at Therfield by persons in Royston, the chase excited no
little interest and excitement. Thriplow Heath was also a favourite
place of meeting for Squire Wortham's harriers, and, among the many
horsemen who followed the pack, a notable figure was that of Sir Peter
Soame, of Heydon.

Sir Peter was a dark, handsome man, of great muscular
power and activity. It was commonly said that he could plant a dozen
hurdles only a yard apart and clear them one at a time. As a horseman
he had few equals, and was famous for the condition of his horses,
which were the best turned out in the hunting field, and Sir Peter
himself made a notable figure in his skin-fit leather breeches. It
was the fashion then {132} to wear the hunting breeches so tight that
it would have been impossible to get into them but for the expedient
of hanging them in the cellar or some damp place overnight! Even then,
to put them on was no child's play, and Sir Peter, it is said, used
to put his on by sliding down the bannister! In this way he got into
garments which fitted him like a second skin, and, regardless of the
dampness of them, rode out in the pink of condition, on the best horse
in the district! Unless reports did him injustice, the sporting baronet
was devotedly attached to the bottle, and more than once came to grief
when driving his pony home from Cambridge, when he would be picked
up by one of the "fly" wagons and given a lift to the Black Horse
at Fowlmere. Of Sir Peter in other sporting aspects more will be said
presently.

The Heath appears to have been associated with other forms
of sport, from the following lines taken from a local poet, to whose
picturesque descriptions and facile handling of the heroic measure,
I must be indebted in this chapter. I refer to a book entitled "Visions
of Childhood," by W. Warren Butler, of Barkway, printed and published
by John Warren in 1843. Of one questionable form of sport on the Heath,
he writes--

Here on this very spot, here have I seen Such bloody
deeds performed upon the ground; And men have search'd the secret
coverts round, Where ev'ry harmless rabbit could be found. * * * *
* * The innocent collection in a sack, Are carelessly slung round
their murd'rer's back And one by one let loose with joy they fly;
This moment they are free--the next they die, The savage hound set
on amidst the fray, Seizes and tears their little lives away, While
laughter from all sides his valour draws, And even fair ones pat him
with applause. Youth and health have withstood
well the involuntary and voluntary hardships of her lot, and the nights in which she has lain
on the hard floor for a penance have left no obvious trace; the eyes are liquid, the brown
cheek is firm and round, the full lips are red. With her dark coloring and jet crown surmounting
her tall figure, she seems to have a sort of kinship with the grand Scotch firs, at which she
is looking up as if she loved them well. Yet one has a sense of uneasiness in looking at her,--a
sense of opposing elements, of which a fierce collision is imminent; surely there is a hushed
expression, such as one often sees in older faces under borderless caps, out of keeping with
the resistant youth, which one expects to flash out in a sudden, passionate glance, that will
dissipate all the quietude, like a damp fire leaping out again when all seemed safe.

But Maggie herself was not uneasy at this moment. She was clamly enjoying the free air, while
she looked up at the old fir-trees, and thought that those broken ends of branches were the
records of past storms, which had only made the red stems soar higher. But while her eyes were
still turned upward, she became conscious of a moving shadow cast by the evening sun on the
grassy path before her, and looked down with a startled gesture to see Philip Wakem, who first
raised his hat, and then, blushing deeply, came forward to her and put out his hand. Maggie,
too, colored with surprise, which soon gave way to pleasure. She put out her hand and looked
down at the deformed figure before her with frank eyes, filled for the moment with nothing
but the memory of her child's feelings,--a memory that was always strong in her. She was the
first to speak.

"You startled me," she said, smiling faintly; "I never meet any one here. How came you to be
walking here? Did you come to meet me?"

It was impossible not to perceive that Maggie felt herself a child again.

"Yes, I did," said Philip, still embarrassed; "I wished to see you very much. I watched a long
while yesterday on the bank near your house to see if you would come out, but you never came.
Then I watched again to-day, and when I saw the way you took, I kept you in sight and came
down the bank, behind there. I hope you will not be displeased with me."

"No," said Maggie, with simple seriousness, walking on as if she meant Philip to accompany
her, "I'm very glad you came, for I wished very much to have an opportunity of speaking to
you. I've never forgotten how good you were long ago to Tom, and me too; but I was not sure
that you would remember us so well. Tom and I have had a great deal of trouble since then,
and I think that makes one think more of what happened before the trouble came."

"I can't believe that you have thought of me so much as I have thought of you," said Philip,
timidly. "Do you know, when I was away, I made a picture of you as you looked that morning
in the study when you said you would not forget me."

Philip drew a large miniature-case from his pocket, and opened it. Maggie saw her old self
leaning on a table, with her black locks hanging down behind her ears, looking into space,
with strange, dreamy eyes. It was a water-color sketch, of real merit as a portrait.

"Oh dear," said Maggie, smiling, and flushed with pleasure, "what a queer little girl I was!
I remember myself with my hair in that way, in that pink frock. I really was like a gypsy.
I dare say I am now," she added, after a little pause; "am I like what you expected me to be?"

The words might have been those of a coquette, but the full, bright glance Maggie turned on
Philip was not that of a coquette. She really did hope he liked her face as it was now, but
it was simply the rising again of her innate delight in admiration and love. Philip met her
eyes and looked at her in silence for a long moment, before he said quietly, "No, Maggie."

The light died out a little from Maggie's face, and there was a slight trembling of the lip.
Her eyelids fell lower, but she did not turn away her head, and Philip continued to look at
her. Then he said slowly:

"You are very much more beautiful than I thought you would be."

"Am I?" said Maggie, the pleasure returning in a deeper flush. She turned her face away from
him and took some steps, looking straight before her in silence, as if she were adjusting her
consciousness to this new idea. Girls are so accustomed to think of dress as the main ground
of vanity, that, in abstaining from the looking-glass, Maggie had thought more of abandoning
all care for adornment than of renouncing the contemplation of her face. Comparing herself
with elegant, wealthy young ladies, it had not occurred to her that she could produce any effect
with her person. Philip seemed to like the silence well. He walked by her side, watching her
face, as if that sight left no room for any other wish. They had passed from among the fir-trees,
and had now come to a green hollow almost surrounded by an amphitheatre of the pale pink dog-roses.
But as the light about them had brightened, Maggie's face had lost its glow.

She stood still when they were in the hollows, and looking at Philip again, she said in a serious,
sad voice:

"I wish we could have been friends,--I mean, if it would have been good and right for us. But
that is the trial I have to bear in everything; I may not keep anything I used to love when
I was little. The old books went; and Tom is different, and my father. It is like death. I
must part with everything I cared for when I was a child. And I must part with you; we must
never take any notice of each other again. That was what I wanted to speak to you for. I wanted
to let you know that Tom and I can't do as we like about such things, and that if I behave
as if I had forgotten all about you, it is not out of envy or pride--or--or any bad feeling."

Maggie spoke with more and more sorrowful gentleness as she went on, and her eyes began to
fill with tears. The deepening expression of pain on Philip's face gave him a stronger resemblance
to his boyish self, and made the deformity appeal more strongly to her pity.

"I know; I see all that you mean," he said, in a voice that had become feebler from discouragement;
"I know what there is to keep us apart on both sides. But it is not right, Maggie,--don't you
be angry with me, I am so used to call you Maggie in my thoughts,--it is not right to sacrifice
everything to other people's unreasonable feelings. I would give up a great deal for my father;
but I would not give up a friendship or--or an attachment of any sort, in obedience to any
wish of his that I didn't recognize as right."

"I don't know," said Maggie, musingly. "Often, when I have been angry and discontented, it
has seemed to me that I was not bound to give up anything; and I have gone on thinking till
it has seemed to me that I could think away all my duty. But no good has ever come of that;
it was an evil state of mind. I'm quite sure that whatever I might do, I should wish in the
end that I had gone without anything for myself, rather than have made my father's life harder
to him."

"But would it make his life harder if we were to see each other sometimes?" said Philip. He
was going to say something else, but checked himself.

"Oh, I'm sure he wouldn't like it. Don't ask me why, or anything about it," said Maggie, in
a distressed tone. "My father feels so strongly about some things. He is not at all happy."

"No more am I," said Philip, impetuously; "I am not happy."

"Why?" said Maggie, gently. "At least--I ought not to ask--but I'm very, very sorry."

Philip turned to walk on, as if he had not patience to stand still any longer, and they went
out of the hollow, winding amongst the trees and bushes in silence. After that last word of
Philip's, Maggie could not bear to insist immediately on their parting.

"I've been a great deal happier," she said at last, timidly, "since I have given up thinking
about what is easy and pleasant, and being discontented because I couldn't have my own will.
Our life is determined for us; and it makes the mind very free when we give up wishing, and
only think of bearing what is laid upon us, and doing what is given us to do."

"But I can't give up wishing," said Philip, impatiently. "It seems to me we can never give
up longing and wishing while we are thoroughly alive. There are certain things we feel to be
beautiful and good, and we must hunger after them. How can we ever be satisfied without them
until our feelings are deadened? I delight in fine pictures; I long to be able to paint such.
I strive and strive, and can't produce what I want. That is pain to me, and always will be
pain, until my faculties lose their keenness, like aged eyes. Then there are many other things
I long for,"--here Philip hesitated a little, and then said,--"things that other men have,
and that will always be denied me. My life will have nothing great or beautiful in it; I would
rather not have lived."

"Oh, Philip," said Maggie, "I wish you didn't feel so." But her heart began to beat with something
of Philip's discontent.

"Well, then," said he, turning quickly round and fixing his gray eyes entreatingly on her face,
"I should be contented to live, if you would let me see you sometimes." Then, checked by a
fear which her face suggested, he looked away again and said more calmly, "I have no friend
to whom I can tell everything, no one who cares enough about me; and if I could only see you
now and then, and you would let me talk to you a little, and show me that you cared for me,
and that we may always be friends in heart, and help each other, then I might come to be glad
of life."

"But how can I see you, Philip?" said Maggie, falteringly. (Could she really do him good? It
would be very hard to say "good-by" this day, and not speak to him again. Here was a new interest
to vary the days; it was so much easier to renounce the interest before it came.)

"If you would let me see you here sometimes,--walk with you here,--I would be contented if
it were only once or twice in a month. That could injure no one's happiness, and it would sweeten
my life. Besides," Philip went on, with all the inventive astuteness of love at one-and-twenty,
"if there is any enmity between those who belong to us, we ought all the more to try and quench
it by our friendship; I mean, that by our influence on both sides we might bring about a healing
of the wounds that have been made in the past, if I could know everything about them. And I
don't believe there is any enmity in my own father's mind; I think he has proved the contrary."

Maggie shook her head slowly, and was silent, under conflicting thoughts. It seemed to her
inclination, that to see Philip now and then, and keep up the bond of friendship with him,
was something not only innocent, but good; perhaps she might really help him to find contentment
as she had found it. The voice that said this made sweet music to Maggie; but athwart it there
came an urgent, monotonous warning from another voice which she had been learning to obey,--the
warning that such interviews implied secrecy; implied doing something she would dread to be
discovered in, something that, if discovered, must cause anger and pain; and that the admission
of anything so near doubleness would act as a spiritual blight. Yet the music would swell out
again, like chimes borne onward by a recurrent breeze, persuading her that the wrong lay all
in the faults and weaknesses of others, and that there was such a thing as futile sacrifice
for one to the injury of another. It was very cruel for Philip that he should be shrunk from,
because of an unjustifiable vindictiveness toward his father,--poor Philip, whom some people
would shrink from only because he was deformed. The idea that he might become her lover or
that her meeting him could cause disapproval in that light, had not occurred to her; and Philip
saw the absence of this idea clearly enough, saw it with a certain pang, although it made her
consent to his request the less unlikely. There was bitterness to him in the perception that
Maggie was almost as frank and unconstrained toward him as when she was a child.

"I can't say either yes or no," she said at last, turning round and walking toward the way
she come; "I must wait, lest I should decide wrongly. I must seek for guidance."

"May I come again, then, to-morrow, or the next day, or next week?"

"I think I had better write," said Maggie, faltering again. "I have to go to St. Ogg's sometimes,
and I can put the letter in the post."

"Oh no," said Philip eagerly; "that would not be so well. My father might see the letter--and--he
has not any enmity, I believe, but he views things differently from me; he thinks a great deal
about wealth and position. Pray let me come here once more. Tell me when it shall be; or if
you can't tell me, I will come as often as I can till I do see you."

"I think it must be so, then," said Maggie, "for I can't be quite certain of coming here any
particular evening."

Maggie felt a great relief in adjourning the decision. She was free now to enjoy the minutes
of companionship; she almost thought she might linger a little; the next time they met she
should have to pain Philip by telling him her determination.

"I can't help thinking," she said, looking smilingly at him, after a few moments of silence,
"how strange it is that we should have met and talked to each other, just as if it had been
only yesterday when we parted at Lorton. And yet we must both be very much altered in those
five years,--I think it is five years. How was it you seemed to have a sort of feeling that
I was the same Maggie? I was not quite so sure that you would be the same; I know you are so
clever, and you must have seen and learnt so much to fill your mind; I was not quite sure you
would care about me now."

"I have never had any doubt that you would be the same, whenever I migh see you," said Philip,--"I
mean, the same in everything that made me like you better than any one else. I don't want to
explain that; I don't think any of the strongest effects our natures are susceptible of can
ever be explained. We can neither detect the process by which they are arrived at, nor the
mode in which they act on us. The greatest of painters only once painted a mysteriously divine
child; he couldn't have told how he did it, and we can't tell why we feel it to be divine.
I think there are stores laid up in our human nature that our understandings can make no complete
inventory of.

"Ah! I know what you mean about music; I feel so," said Maggie, clasping her hands with her
old impetuosity. "At least," she added, in a saddened tone, "I used to feel so when I had any
music; I never have any now except the organ at church."

"And you long for it, Maggie?" said Philip, looking at her with affectionate pity. "Ah, you
can have very little that is beautiful in your life. Have you many books? You were so fond
of them when you were a little girl."

They were come back to the hollow, round which the dog-roses grew, and they both paused under
the charm of the faëry evening light, reflected from the pale pink clusters.

"No, I have given up books," said Maggie, quietly, "except a very, very few."

Philip had already taken from his pocket a small volume, and was looking at the back as he said:

"Ah, this is the second volume, I see, else you might have liked to take it home with you.
I put it in my pocket because I am studying a scene for a picture."

Maggie had looked at the back too, and saw the title; it revived an old impression with overmastering
force.

"'The Pirate,'" she said, taking the book from Philip's hands. "Oh, I began that once; I read
to where Minna is walking with Cleveland, and I could never get to read the rest. I went on
with it in my own head, and I made several endings; but they were all unhappy. I could never
make a happy ending out of that beginning. Poor Minna! I wonder what is the real end. For a
long while I couldn't get my mind away from the Shetland Isles,--I used to feel the wind blowing
on me from the rough sea."

Maggie spoke rapidly, with glistening eyes.

"Take that volume home with you, Maggie," said Philip, watching her with delight. "I don't
want it now. I shall make a picture of you instead,--you, among the Scotch firs and the slanting
shadows."

Maggie had not heard a word he had said; she was absorbed in a page at which she had opened.
But suddenly she closed the book, and gave it back to Philip, shaking her head with a backward
movement, as if to say "avaunt" to floating visions.

"Do keep it, Maggie," said Philip, entreatingly; "it will give you pleasure."

"No, thank you," said Maggie, putting it aside with her hand and walking on. "It would make
me in love with this world again, as I used to be; it would make me long to see and know many
things; it would make me long for a full life."

"But you will not always be shut up in your present lot; why should you starve your mind in
that way? It is narrow asceticism; I don't like to see you persisting in it, Maggie. Poetry
and art and knowledge are sacred and pure."

"But not for me, not for me," said Maggie, walking more hurriedly; "because I should want too
much. I must wait; this life will not last long."

"Don't hurry away from me without saying 'good-by,' Maggie," said Philip, as they reached the
group of Scotch firs, and she continued still to walk along without speaking. "I must not go
any farther, I think, must I?"

"Oh no, I forgot; good-by," said Maggie, pausing, and putting out her hand to him. The action
brought her feeling back in a strong current to Philip; and after they had stood looking at
each other in silence for a few moments, with their hands clasped, she said, withdrawing her hand:

"I'm very grateful to you for thinking of me all those years. It is very sweet to have people
love us. What a wonderful, beautiful thing it seems that God should have made your heart so
that you could care about a queer little girl whom you only knew for a few weeks! I remember
saying to you that I thought you cared for me more than Tom did."

"Ah, Maggie," said Philip, almost fretfully, "you would never love me so well as you love your
brother."

"Perhaps not," said Maggie, simply; "but then, you know, the first thing I ever remember in
my life is standing with Tom by the side of the Floss, while he held my hand; everything before
that is dark to me. But I shall never forget you, though we must keep apart."

"Don't say so, Maggie," said Philip. "If I kept that little girl in my mind for five years,
didn't I earn some part in her? She ought not to take herself quite away from me."

"Not if I were free," said Maggie; "but I am not, I must submit." She hesitated a moment, and
then added, "And I wanted to say to you, that you had better not take more notice of my brother
than just bowing to him. He once told me not to speak to you again, and he doesn't change his
mind--Oh dear, the sun is set. I am too long away. Good-by." She gave him her hand once more.

"I shall come here as often as I can till I see you again, Maggie. Have some feeling for me
as well as for others."

"Yes, yes, I have," said Maggie, hurrying away, and quickly disappearing behind the last fir-tree;
though Philip's gaze after her remained immovable for minutes as if he saw her still.

Maggie went home, with an inward conflict already begun; Philip went home to do nothing but
remember and hope. You can hardly help blaming him severely. He was four or five years older
than Maggie, and had a full consciousness of his feeling toward her to aid him in foreseeing
the character his contemplated interviews with her would bear in the opinion of a third person.
But you must not suppose that he was capable of a gross selfishness, or that he could have
been satisfied without persuading himself that he was seeking to infuse some happiness into
Maggie's life,--seeking this even more than any direct ends for himself. He could give her
sympathy; he could give her help. There was not the slightest promise of love toward him in
her manner; it was nothing more than the sweet girlish tenderness she had shown him when she
was twelve. Perhaps she would never love him; perhaps no woman ever could love him. Well, then,
he would endure that; he should at least have the happiness of seeing her, of feeling some
nearness to her. And he clutched passionately the possibility that she might love him; perhaps
the feeling would grow, if she could come to associate him with that watchful tenderness which
her nature would be so keenly alive to. If any woman could love him, surely Maggie was that
woman; there was such wealth of love in her, and there was no one to claim it all. Then, the
pity of it, that a mind like hers should be withering in its very youth, like a young forest-tree,
for want of the light and space it was formed to flourish in! Could he not hinder that, by
persuading her out of her system of privation? He would be her guardian angel; he would do
anything, bear anything, for her sake--except not seeing her.

Chapter II

Aunt Glegg Learns the Breadth of Bob's Thumb

While Maggie's life-struggles had lain almost entirely within her own soul, one shadowy army
fighting another, and the slain shadows forever rising again, Tom was engaged in a dustier,
noisier warfare, grappling with more substantial obstacles, and gaining more definite conquests.
So it has been since the days of Hecuba, and of Hector, Tamer of horses; inside the gates,
the women with streaming hair and uplifted hands offering prayers, watching the world's combat
from afar, filling their long, empty days with memories and fears; outside, the men, in fierce
struggle with things divine and human, quenching memory in the stronger light of purpose, losing
the sense of dread and even of wounds in the hurrying ardor of action.

From what you have seen of Tom, I think he is not a youth of whom you would prophesy failure
in anything he had thoroughly wished; the wagers are likely to be on his side, notwithstanding
his small success in the classics. For Tom had never desired success in this field of enterprise;
and for getting a fine flourishing growth of stupidity there is nothing like pouring out on
a mind a good amount of subjects in which it feels no interest. But now Tom's strong will bound
together his integrity, his pride, his family regrets, and his personal ambition, and made
them one force, concentrating his efforts and surmounting discouragements. His uncle Deane,
who watched him closely, soon began to conceive hopes of him, and to be rather proud that he
had brought into the employment of the firm a nephew who appeared to be made of such good commercial
stuff. The real kindness of placing him in the warehouse first was soon evident to Tom, in
the hints his uncle began to throw out, that after a time he might perhaps be trusted to travel
at certain seasons, and buy in for the firm various vulgar commodities with which I need not
shock refined ears in this place; and it was doubtless with a view to this result that Mr.
Deane, when he expected to take his wine alone, would tell Tom to step in and sit with him
an hour, and would pass that hour in much lecturing and catechising concerning articles of
export and import, with an occasional excursus of more indirect utility on the relative advantages
to the merchants of St. Ogg's of having goods brought in their own and in foreign bottoms,--a
subject on which Mr. Deane, as a ship-owner, naturally threw off a few sparks when he got warmed
with talk and wine.

Already, in the second year, Tom's salary was raised; but all, except the price of his dinner
and clothes, went home into the tin box; and he shunned comradeship, lest it should lead him
into expenses in spite of himself. Not that Tom was moulded on the spoony type of the Industrious
Apprentice; he had a very strong appetite for pleasure,--would have liked to be a Tamer of
horses and to make a distinguished figure in all neighboring eyes, dispensing treats and benefits
to others with well-judged liberality, and being pronounced one of the finest young fellows
of those parts; nay, he determined to achieve these things sooner or later; but his practical
shrewdness told him that the means no such achievements could only lie for him in present abstinence
and self-denial; there were certain milestones to be passed, and one of the first was the payment
of his father's debts. Having made up his mind on that point, he strode along without swerving,
contracting some rather saturnine sternness, as a young man is likely to do who has a premature
call upon him for self-reliance. Tom felt intensely that common cause with his father which
springs from family pride, and was bent on being irreproachable as a son; but his growing experience
caused him to pass much silent criticism on the rashness and imprudence of his father's past
conduct; their dispositions were not in sympathy, and Tom's face showed little radiance during
his few home hours. Maggie had an awe of him, against which she struggled as something unfair
to her consciousness of wider thoughts and deeper motives; but it was of no use to struggle.
A character at unity with itself--that performs what it intends, subdues every counteracting
impulse, and has no visions beyond the distinctly possible--is strong by its very negations.

You may imagine that Tom's more and more obvious unlikeness to his father was well fitted to
conciliate the maternal aunts and uncles; and Mr. Deane's favorable reports and predictions
to Mr. Glegg concerning Tom's qualifications for business began to be discussed amongst them
with various acceptance. He was likely, it appeared, to do the family credit without causing
it any expense and trouble. Mrs. Pullet had always thought it strange if Tom's excellent complexion,
so entirely that of the Dodsons, did not argue a certainty that he would turn out well; his
juvenile errors of running down the peacock, and general disrespect to his aunts, only indicating
a tinge of Tulliver blood which he had doubtless outgrown. Mr. Glegg, who had contracted a
cautious liking for Tom ever since his spirited and sensible behavior when the execution was
in the house, was now warming into a resolution to further his prospects actively,--some time,
when an opportunity offered of doing so in a prudent manner, without ultimate loss; but Mrs.
Glegg observed that she was not given to speak without book, as some people were; that those
who said least were most likely to find their words made good; and that when the right moment
came, it would be seen who could do something better than talk. Uncle Pullet, after silent
meditation for a period of several lozenges, came distinctly to the conclusion, that when a
young man was likely to do well, it was better not to meddle with him.

Tom, meanwhile, had shown no disposition to rely on any one but himself, though, with a natural
sensitiveness toward all indications of favorable opinion, he was glad to see his uncle Glegg
look in on him sometimes in a friendly way during business hours, and glad to be invited to
dine at his house, though he usually preferred declining on the ground that he was not sure
of being punctual. But about a year ago, something had occurred which induced Tom to test his
uncle Glegg's friendly disposition.

Bob Jakin, who rarely returned from one of his rounds without seeing Tom and Maggie, awaited
him on the bridge as he was coming home from St. Ogg's one evening, that they might have a
little private talk. He took the liberty of asking if Mr. Tom had ever thought of making money
by trading a bit on his own account. Trading, how? Tom wished to know. Why, by sending out
a bit of a cargo to foreign ports; because Bob had a particular friend who had offered to do
a little business for him in that way in Laceham goods, and would be glad to serve Mr. Tom
on the same footing. Tom was interested at once, and begged for full explanation, wondering
he had not thought of this plan before.

He was so well pleased with the prospect of a speculation that might change the slow process
of addition into multiplication, that he at once determined to mention the matter to his father,
and get his consent to appropriate some of the savings in the tin box to the purchase of a
small cargo. He would rather not have consulted his father, but he had just paid his last quarter's
money into the tin box, and there was no other resource. All the savings were there; for Mr.
Tulliver would not consent to put the money out at interest lest he should lose it. Since he
had speculated in the purchase of some corn, and had lost by it, he could not be easy without
keeping the money under his eye.

Tom approached the subject carefully, as he was seated on the hearth with his father that evening,
and Mr. Tulliver listened, leaning forward in his arm-chair and looking up in Tom's face with
a sceptical glance. His first impulse was to give a positive refusal, but he was in some awe
of Tom's wishes, and since he had the sense of being an "unlucky" father, he had lost some
of his old peremptoriness and determination to be master. He took the key of the bureau from
his pocket, got out the key of the large chest, and fetched down the tin box,--slowly, as if
he were trying to defer the moment of a painful parting. Then he seated himself against the
table, and opened the box with that little padlock-key which he fingered in his waistcoat pocket
in all vacant moments. There they were, the dingy bank-notes and the bright sovereigns, and
he counted them out on the table--only a hundred and sixteen pounds in two years, after all
the pinching.

"How much do you want, then?" he said, speaking as if the words burnt his lips.

"Suppose I begin with the thirty-six pounds, father?" said Tom.

Mr. Tulliver separated this sum from the rest, and keeping his hand over it, said:

"It's as much as I can save out o' my pay in a year."

"Yes, father; it is such slow work, saving out of the little money we get. And in this way
we might double our savings."

"Ay, my lad," said the father, keeping his hand on the money, "but you might lose it,--you
might lose a year o' my life,--and I haven't got many."

Tom was silent.

"And you know I wouldn't pay a dividend with the first hundred, because I wanted to see it
all in a lump,--and when I see it, I'm sure on't. If you trust to luck, it's sure to be against
me. It's Old Harry's got the luck in his hands; and if I lose one year, I shall never pick
it up again; death 'ull o'ertake me."

Mr. Tulliver's voice trembled, and Tom was silent for a few minutes before he said:

"I'll give it up, father, since you object to it so strongly."

But, unwilling to abandon the scheme altogether, he determined to ask his uncle Glegg to venture
twenty pounds, on condition of receiving five per cent. of the profits. That was really a very
small thing to ask. So when Bob called the next day at the wharf to know the decision, Tom
proposed that they should go together to his uncle Glegg's to open the business; for his diffident
pride clung to him, and made him feel that Bobs' tongue would relieve him from some embarrassment.

Mr. Glegg, at the pleasant hour of four in the afternoon of a hot August day, was naturally
counting his wall-fruit to assure himself that the sum total had not varied since yesterday.
To him entered Tom, in what appeared to Mr. Glegg very questionable companionship,--that of
a man with a pack on his back,--for Bob was equipped for a new journey,--and of a huge brindled
bull-terrier, who walked with a slow, swaying movement from side to side, and glanced from
under his eye-lids with a surly indifference which might after all be a cover to the most offensive
designs.

Mr. Glegg's spectacles, which had been assisting him in counting the fruit, made these suspicious
details alarmingly evident to him.

"Heigh! heigh! keep that dog back, will you?" he shouted, snatching up a stake and holding
it before him as a shield when the visitors were within three yards of him.

"Get out wi' you, Mumps," said Bob, with a kick. "He's as quiet as a lamb, sir,"--an observation
which Mumps corroborated by a low growl as he retreated behind his master's legs.

"Why, what ever does this mean, Tom?" said Mr. Glegg. "Have you brought information about the
scoundrels as cut my trees?" If Bob came in the character of "information," Mr. Glegg saw reasons
for tolerating some irregularity.

"No, sir," said Tom; "I came to speak to you about a little matter of business of my own."

"Ay--well; but what has this dog got to do with it?" said the old gentleman, getting mild again.

"It's my dog, sir," said the ready Bob. "An' it's me as put Mr. Tom up to the bit o' business;
for Mr. Tom's been a friend o' mine iver since I was a little chap; fust thing iver I did was
frightenin' the birds for th' old master. An' if a bit o' luck turns up, I'm allays thinkin'
if I can let Mr. Tom have a pull at it. An' it's a downright roarin' shame, as when he's got
the chance o' making a bit o' money wi' sending goods out,--ten or twelve per zent clear, when
freight an' commission's paid,--as he shouldn't lay hold o' the chance for want o' money. An'
when there's the Laceham goods,--lors! they're made o' purpose for folks as want to send out
a little carguy; light, an' take up no room,--you may pack twenty pound so as you can't see
the passill; an' they're manifacturs as please fools, so I reckon they aren't like to want
a market. An' I'd go to Laceham an' buy in the goods for Mr. Tom along wi' my own. An' there's
the shupercargo o' the bit of a vessel as is goin' to take 'em out. I know him partic'lar;
he's a solid man, an' got a family i' the town here. Salt, his name is,--an' a briny chap he
is too,--an' if you don't believe me, I can take you to him."

Uncle Glegg stood open-mouthed with astonishment at this unembarrassed loquacity, with which
his understanding could hardly keep pace. He looked at Bob, first over his spectacles, then
through them, then over them again; while Tom, doubtful of his uncle's impression, began to
wish he had not brought this singular Aaron, or mouthpiece. Bob's talk appeared less seemly,
now some one besides himself was listening to it.

"You seem to be a knowing fellow," said Mr. Glegg, at last.

"Ay, sir, you say true," returned Bob, nodding his head aside; "I think my head's all alive
inside like an old cheese, for I'm so full o' plans, one knocks another over. If I hadn't Mumps
to talk to, I should get top-heavy an' tumble in a fit. I suppose it's because I niver went
to school much. That's what I jaw my old mother for. I says, 'You should ha' sent me to school
a bit more,' I says, 'an' then I could ha' read i' the books like fun, an' kep' my head cool
an' empty.' Lors, she's fine an' comfor'ble now, my old mother is; she ates her baked meat
an' taters as often as she likes. For I'm gettin' so full o' money, I must hev a wife to spend
it for me. But it's botherin,' a wife is,--and Mumps mightn't like her."

Uncle Glegg, who regarded himself as a jocose man since he had retired from business, was beginning
to find Bob amusing, but he had still a disapproving observation to make, which kept his face
serious.

"Ah," he said, "I should think you're at a loss for ways o' spending your money, else you wouldn't
keep that big dog, to eat as much as two Christians. It's shameful--shameful!" But he spoke
more in sorrow than in anger, and quickly added:

"But, come now, let's hear more about this business, Tom. I suppose you want a little sum to
make a venture with. But where's all your own money? You don't spend it all--eh?"

"No, sir," said Tom, coloring; "but my father is unwilling to risk it, and I don't like to
press him. If I could get twenty or thirty pounds to begin with, I could pay five per cent
for it, and then I could gradually make a little capital of my own, and do without a loan."

"Ay--ay," said Mr. Glegg, in an approving tone; "that's not a bad notion, and I won't say as
I wouldn't be your man. But it 'ull be as well for me to see this Salt, as you talk on. And
then--here's this friend o' yours offers to buy the goods for you. Perhaps you've got somebody
to stand surety for you if the money's put into your hands?" added the cautious old gentleman,
looking over his spectacles at Bob.

"I don't think that's necessary, uncle," said Tom. "At least, I mean it would not be necessary
for me, because I know Bob well; but perhaps it would be right for you to have some security."

"You get your percentage out o' the purchase, I suppose?" said Mr. Glegg, looking at Bob.

"No, sir," said Bob, rather indignantly; "I didn't offer to get a apple for Mr. Tom, o' purpose
to hev a bite out of it myself. When I play folks tricks, there'll be more fun in 'em nor that."

"Well, but it's nothing but right you should have a small percentage," said Mr. Glegg. "I've
no opinion o' transactions where folks do things for nothing. It allays looks bad."

"Well, then," said Bob, whose keenness saw at once what was implied, "I'll tell you what I
get by't, an' it's money in my pocket in the end,--I make myself look big, wi' makin' a bigger
purchase. That's what I'm thinking on. Lors! I'm a 'cute chap,--I am."

"Mr. Glegg, Mr. Glegg!" said a severe voice from the open parlor window, "pray are you coming
in to tea, or are you going to stand talking with packmen till you get murdered in the open
daylight?"

"Murdered?" said Mr. Glegg; "what's the woman talking of? Here's your nephey Tom come about
a bit o' business."

"Murdered,--yes,--it isn't many 'sizes ago since a packman murdered a young woman in a lone
place, and stole her thimble, and threw her body into a ditch."

"Nay, nay," said Mr. Glegg, soothingly, "you're thinking o' the man wi' no legs, as drove a
dog-cart."

"Well, it's the same thing, Mr. Glegg, only you're fond o' contradicting what I say; and if
my nephey's come about business, it 'ud be more fitting if you'd bring him into the house,
and let his aunt know about it, instead o' whispering in corners, in that plotting, underminding
way."

"Well, well," said Mr. Glegg, "we'll come in now."

"You needn't stay here," said the lady to Bob, in a loud voice, adapted to the moral, not the
physical, distance between them. "We don't want anything. I don't deal wi' packmen. Mind you
shut the gate after you."

"Stop a bit; not so fast," said Mr. Glegg; "I haven't done with this young man yet. Come in,
Tom; come in," he added, stepping in at the French window.

"Mr. Glegg," said Mrs. G., in a fatal tone, "if you're going to let that man and his dog in
on my carpet, before my very face, be so good as to let me know. A wife's got a right to ask
that, I hope."

"Don't you be uneasy, mum," said Bob, touching his cap. He saw at once that Mrs. Glegg was
a bit of game worth running down, and longed to be at the sport; "we'll stay out upo' the gravel
here,--Mumps and me will. Mumps knows his company,--he does. I might hish at him by th' hour
together, before he'd fly at a real gentlewoman like you. It's wonderful how he knows which
is the good-looking ladies; and's partic'lar fond of 'em when they've good shapes. Lors!" added
Bob, laying down his pack on the gravel, "it's a thousand pities such a lady as you shouldn't
deal with a packman, i' stead o' goin' into these newfangled shops, where there's half-a-dozen
fine gents wi' their chins propped up wi' a stiff stock, a-looking like bottles wi' ornamental
stoppers, an' all got to get their dinner out of a bit o' calico; it stan's to reason you must
pay three times the price you pay a packman, as is the nat'ral way o' gettin' goods,--an' pays
no rent, an' isn't forced to throttle himself till the lies are squeezed out on him, whether
he will or no. But lors! mum, you know what it is better nor I do,--you can see through them
shopmen, I'll be bound."

"Yes, I reckon I can, and through the packmen too," observed Mrs. Glegg, intending to imply
that Bob's flattery had produced no effect on her; while her husband, standing behind her with
his hands in his pockets and legs apart, winked and smiled with conjugal delight at the probability
of his wife's being circumvented.

"Ay, to be sure, mum," said Bob. "Why, you must ha' dealt wi' no end o' packmen when you war
a young lass--before the master here had the luck to set eyes on you. I know where you lived,
I do,--seen th' house many a time,--close upon Squire Darleigh's,--a stone house wi' steps----"

"Ah, that it had," said Mrs. Glegg, pouring out the tea. "You know something o' my family,
then? Are you akin to that packman with a squint in his eye, as used to bring th' Irish linen?"

"Look you there now!" said Bob, evasively. "Didn't I know as you'd remember the best bargains
you've made in your life was made wi' packmen? Why, you see even a squintin' packman's better
nor a shopman as can see straight. Lors! if I'd had the luck to call at the stone house wi'
my pack, as lies here,"--stooping and thumping the bundle emphatically with his fist,--"an'
th' handsome young lasses all stannin' out on the stone steps, it ud' ha' been summat like
openin' a pack, that would. It's on'y the poor houses now as a packman calls on, if it isn't
for the sake o' the sarvant-maids. They're paltry times, these are. Why, mum, look at the printed
cottons now, an' what they was when you wore 'em,--why, you wouldn't put such a thing on now,
I can see. It must be first-rate quality, the manifactur as you'd buy,--summat as 'ud wear
as well as your own faitures."

"Yes, better quality nor any you're like to carry; you've got nothing first-rate but brazenness,
I'll be bound," said Mrs. Glegg, with a triumphant sense of her insurmountable sagacity. "Mr.
Glegg, are you going ever to sit down to your tea? Tom, there's a cup for you."

"You speak true there, mum," said Bob. "My pack isn't for ladies like you. The time's gone
by for that. Bargains picked up dirt cheap! A bit o' damage here an' there, as can be cut out,
or else niver seen i' the wearin', but not fit to offer to rich folks as can pay for the look
o' things as nobody sees. I'm not the man as 'ud offer t' open my pack to you, mum; no, no;
I'm a imperent chap, as you say,--these times makes folks imperent,--but I'm not up to the
mark o' that."

"Why, what goods do you carry in your pack?" said Mrs. Glegg. "Fine-colored things, I suppose,--shawls
an' that?"

"All sorts, mum, all sorts," said Bob,--thumping his bundle; "but let us say no more about
that, if you please. I'm here upo' Mr. Tom's business, an' I'm not the man to take up the time
wi' my own."

"And pray, what is this business as is to be kept from me?" said Mrs. Glegg, who, solicited
by a double curiosity, was obliged to let the one-half wait.

"A little plan o' nephey Tom's here," said good-natured Mr. Glegg; "and not altogether a bad
'un, I think. A little plan for making money; that's the right sort o' plan for young folks
as have got their fortin to make, eh, Jane?"

"But I hope it isn't a plan where he expects iverything to be done for him by his friends;
that's what the young folks think of mostly nowadays. And pray, what has this packman got to
do wi' what goes on in our family? Can't you speak for yourself, Tom, and let your aunt know
things, as a nephey should?"

"This is Bob Jakin, aunt," said Tom, bridling the irritation that aunt Glegg's voice always
produced. "I've known him ever since we were little boys. He's a very good fellow, and always
ready to do me a kindness. And he has had some experience in sending goods out,--a small part
of a cargo as a private speculation; and he thinks if I could begin to do a little in the same
way, I might make some money. A large interest is got in that way."

"Large int'rest?" said aunt Glegg, with eagerness; "and what do you call large int'rest?"

"Ten or twelve per cent, Bob says, after expenses are paid."

"Then why wasn't I let to know o' such things before, Mr. Glegg?" said Mrs. Glegg, turning
to her husband, with a deep grating tone of reproach. "Haven't you allays told me as there
was no getting more nor five per cent?"

"Pooh, pooh, nonsense, my good woman," said Mr. Glegg. "You couldn't go into trade, could you?
You can't get more than five per cent with security."

"But I can turn a bit o' money for you, an' welcome, mum," said Bob, "if you'd like to risk
it,--not as there's any risk to speak on. But if you'd a mind to lend a bit o' money to Mr.
Tom, he'd pay you six or seven per zent, an' get a trifle for himself as well; an' a good-natur'd
lady like you 'ud like the feel o' the money better if your nephey took part on it."

"What do you say, Mrs. G.?" said Mr. Glegg. "I've a notion, when I've made a bit more inquiry,
as I shall perhaps start Tom here with a bit of a nest-egg,--he'll pay me int'rest, you know,--an'
if you've got some little sums lyin' idle twisted up in a stockin' toe, or that----"

"Mr. Glegg, it's beyond iverything! You'll go and give information to the tramps next, as they
may come and rob me."

"Well, well, as I was sayin', if you like to join me wi' twenty pounds, you can--I'll make
it fifty. That'll be a pretty good nest-egg, eh, Tom?"

"You're not counting on me, Mr. Glegg, I hope," said his wife. "You could do fine things wi'
my money, I don't doubt."

"Very well," said Mr. Glegg, rather snappishly, "then we'll do without you. I shall go with
you to see this Salt," he added, turning to Bob.

"And now, I suppose, you'll go all the other way, Mr. Glegg," said Mrs. G., "and want to shut
me out o' my own nephey's business. I never said I wouldn't put money into it,--I don't say
as it shall be twenty pounds, though you're so ready to say it for me,--but he'll see some
day as his aunt's in the right not to risk the money she's saved for him till it's proved as
it won't be lost."

"Ay, that's a pleasant sort o'risk, that is," said Mr. Glegg, indiscreetly winking at Tom,
who couldn't avoid smiling. But Bob stemmed the injured lady's outburst.

"Ay, mum," he said admiringly, "you know what's what--you do. An' it's nothing but fair. You
see how the first bit of a job answers, an' then you'll come down handsome. Lors, it's a fine
thing to hev good kin. I got my bit of a nest-egg, as the master calls it, all by my own sharpness,--ten
suvreigns it was,--wi' dousing the fire at Torry's mill, an' it's growed an' growed by a bit
an' a bit, till I'n got a matter o' thirty pound to lay out, besides makin' my mother comfor'ble.
I should get more, on'y I'm such a soft wi' the women,--I can't help lettin' 'em hev such good
bargains. There's this bundle, now," thumping it lustily, "any other chap 'ud make a pretty
penny out on it. But me!--lors, I shall sell 'em for pretty near what I paid for 'em."

"Have you got a bit of good net, now?" said Mrs. Glegg, in a patronizing tone, moving from
the tea-table, and folding her napkin.

"Eh, mum, not what you'd think it worth your while to look at. I'd scorn to show it you. It
'ud be an insult to you."

"But let me see," said Mrs. Glegg, still patronizing. "If they're damaged goods, they're like
enough to be a bit the better quality."

"No, mum, I know my place," said Bob, lifting up his pack and shouldering it. "I'm not going
t' expose the lowness o' my trade to a lady like you. Packs is come down i' the world; it 'ud
cut you to th' heart to see the difference. I'm at your sarvice, sir, when you've a mind to
go and see Salt."

"All in good time," said Mr. Glegg, really unwilling to cut short the dialogue. "Are you wanted
at the wharf, Tom?"

"No, sir; I left Stowe in my place."

"Come, put down your pack, and let me see," said Mrs. Glegg, drawing a chair to the window
and seating herself with much dignity.

"Don't you ask it, mum," said Bob, entreatingly.

"Make no more words," said Mrs. Glegg, severely, "but do as I tell you."

"Eh mum, I'm loth, that I am," said Bob, slowly depositing his pack on the step, and beginning
to untie it with unwilling fingers. "But what you order shall be done" (much fumbling in pauses
between the sentences). "It's not as you'll buy a single thing on me,--I'd be sorry for you
to do it,--for think o' them poor women up i' the villages there, as niver stir a hundred yards
from home,--it 'ud be a pity for anybody to buy up their bargains. Lors, it's as good as a
junketing to 'em when they see me wi' my pack, an' I shall niver pick up such bargains for
'em again. Least ways, I've no time now, for I'm off to Laceham. See here now," Bob went on,
becoming rapid again, and holding up a scarlet woollen Kerchief with an embroidered wreath
in the corner; "here's a thing to make a lass's mouth water, an' on'y two shillin'--an' why?
Why, 'cause there's a bit of a moth-hole 'i this plain end. Lors, I think the moths an' the
mildew was sent by Providence o' purpose to cheapen the goods a bit for the good-lookin' women
as han't got much money. If it hadn't been for the moths, now, every hankicher on 'em 'ud ha'
gone to the rich, handsome ladies, like you, mum, at five shillin' apiece,--not a farthin'
less; but what does the moth do? Why, it nibbles off three shillin' o' the price i' no time;
an' then a packman like me can carry 't to the poor lasses as live under the dark thack, to
make a bit of a blaze for 'em. Lors, it's as good as a fire, to look at such a hankicher!"

Bob held it at a distance for admiration, but Mrs. Glegg said sharply:

"Yes, but nobody wants a fire this time o' year. Put these colored things by; let me look at
your nets, if you've got 'em."

"Eh, mum, I told you how it 'ud be," said Bob, flinging aside the colored things with an air
of desperation. "I knowed it ud' turn again' you to look at such paltry articles as I carry.
Here's a piece o' figured muslin now, what's the use o' you lookin' at it? You might as well
look at poor folks's victual, mum; it 'ud on'y take away your appetite. There's a yard i' the
middle on't as the pattern's all missed,--lors, why, it's a muslin as the Princess Victoree
might ha' wore; but," added Bob, flinging it behind him on to the turf, as if to save Mrs.
Glegg's eyes, "it'll be bought up by the huckster's wife at Fibb's End,--that's where it'll
go--ten shillin' for the whole lot--ten yards, countin' the damaged un--five-an'-twenty shillin'
'ud ha' been the price, not a penny less. But I'll say no more, mum; it's nothing to you, a
piece o' muslin like that; you can afford to pay three times the money for a thing as isn't
half so good. It's nets you talked on; well, I've got a piece as 'ull serve you to make fun on----"

"Bring me that muslin," said Mrs. Glegg. "It's a buff; I'm partial to buff."

"Eh, but a damaged thing," said Bob, in a tone of deprecating disgust. "You'd do nothing with
it, mum, you'd give it to the cook, I know you would, an' it 'ud be a pity,--she'd look too
much like a lady in it; it's unbecoming for servants."

"Fetch it, and let me see you measure it," said Mrs. Glegg, authoritatively.

Bob obeyed with ostentatious reluctance.

"See what there is over measure!" he said, holding forth the extra half-yard, while Mrs. Glegg
was busy examining the damaged yard, and throwing her head back to see how far the fault would
be lost on a distant view.

"I'll give you six shilling for it," she said, throwing it down with the air of a person who
mentions an ultimatum.

"Didn't I tell you now, mum, as it 'ud hurt your feelings to look at my pack? That damaged
bit's turned your stomach now; I see it has," said Bob, wrapping the muslin up with the utmost
quickness, and apparently about to fasten up his pack. "You're used to seein' a different sort
o' article carried by packmen, when you lived at the stone house. Packs is come down i' the
world; I told you that; my goods are for common folks. Mrs. Pepper 'ull give me ten shillin'
for that muslin, an' be sorry as I didn't ask her more. Such articles answer i' the wearin',--they
keep their color till the threads melt away i' the wash-tub, an' that won't be while I'm a
young un."

"Well, seven shilling," said Mrs. Glegg.

"Put it out o' your mind, mum, now do," said Bob. "Here's a bit o' net, then, for you to look
at before I tie up my pack, just for you to see what my trade's come to,--spotted and sprigged,
you see, beautiful but yallow,--'s been lyin' by an' got the wrong color. I could niver ha'
bought such net, if it hadn't been yallow. Lors, it's took me a deal o' study to know the vally
o' such articles; when I begun to carry a pack, I was as ignirant as a pig; net or calico was
all the same to me. I thought them things the most vally as was the thickest. I was took in
dreadful, for I'm a straightforrard chap,--up to no tricks, mum. I can only say my nose is
my own, for if I went beyond, I should lose myself pretty quick. An' I gev five-an'-eightpence
for that piece o' net,--if I was to tell y' anything else I should be tellin' you fibs,--an'
five-an'-eightpence I shall ask of it, not a penny more, for it's a woman's article, an' I
like to 'commodate the women. Five-an'-eightpence for six yards,--as cheap as if it was only
the dirt on it as was paid for.'"

"I don't mind having three yards of it,'" said Mrs. Glegg.

"Why, there's but six altogether," said Bob. "No, mum, it isn't worth your while; you can go
to the shop to-morrow an' get the same pattern ready whitened. It's on'y three times the money;
what's that to a lady like you?" He gave an emphatic tie to his bundle.

"Come, lay me out that muslin," said Mrs. Glegg. "Here's eight shilling for it."

"You will be jokin'," said Bob, looking up with a laughing face; "I see'd you was a pleasant
lady when I fust come to the winder."

"Well, put it me out," said Mrs. Glegg, peremptorily.

"But if I let you have it for ten shillin', mum, you'll be so good as not tell nobody. I should
be a laughin'-stock; the trade 'ud hoot me, if they knowed it. I'm obliged to make believe
as I ask more nor I do for my goods, else they'd find out I was a flat. I'm glad you don't
insist upo' buyin' the net, for then I should ha' lost my two best bargains for Mrs. Pepper
o' Fibb's End, an' she's a rare customer."

"Let me look at the net again," said Mrs. Glegg, yearning after the cheap spots and sprigs,
now they were vanishing.

"Well, I can't deny you, mum," said Bob handing it out.

"Eh!, see what a pattern now! Real Laceham goods. Now, this is the sort o' article I'm recommendin'
Mr. Tom to send out. Lors, it's a fine thing for anybody as has got a bit o' money; these Laceham
goods 'ud make it breed like maggits. If I was a lady wi' a bit o' money!--why, I know one
as put thirty pounds into them goods,--a lady wi' a cork leg, but as sharp,--you wouldn't catch
her runnin' her head into a sack; she'd see her way clear out o' anything afore she'd be in
a hurry to start. Well, she let out thirty pound to a young man in the drapering line, and
he laid it out i' Laceham goods, an' a shupercargo o' my acquinetance (not Salt) took 'em out,
an' she got her eight per zent fust go off; an' now you can't hold her but she must be sendin'
out carguies wi' every ship, till she's gettin' as rich as a Jew. Bucks her name is, she doesn't
live i' this town. Now then, mum, if you'll please to give me the net----"

"Here's fifteen shilling, then, for the two," said Mrs. Glegg. "But it's a shameful price."

"Nay, mum, you'll niver say that when you're upo' your knees i' church i' five years' time.
I'm makin' you a present o' th' articles; I am, indeed. That eightpence shaves off my profits
as clean as a razor. Now then, sir," continued Bob, shouldering his pack, "if you please, I'll
be glad to go and see about makin' Mr. Tom's fortin. Eh, I wish I'd got another twenty pound
to lay out mysen; I shouldn't stay to say my Catechism afore I knowed what to do wi't."

"Stop a bit, Mr. Glegg," said the lady, as her husband took his hat, "you never will give me
the chance o' speaking. You'll go away now, and finish everything about this business, and
come back and tell me it's too late for me to speak. As if I wasn't my nephey's own aunt, and
the head o' the family on his mother's side! and laid by guineas, all full weight, for him,
as he'll know who to respect when I'm laid in my coffin."

"Well, Mrs. G., say what you mean," said Mr. G., hastily.

"Well, then, I desire as nothing may be done without my knowing. I don't say as I sha'n't venture
twenty pounds, if you make out as everything's right and safe. And if I do, Tom," concluded
Mrs. Glegg, turning impressively to her nephew, "I hope you'll allays bear it in mind and be
grateful for such an aunt. I mean you to pay me interest, you know; I don't approve o' giving;
we niver looked for that in my family."

"Thank you, aunt," said Tom, rather proudly. "I prefer having the money only lent to me."

"Very well; that's the Dodson sperrit," said Mrs. Glegg, rising to get her knitting with the
sense that any further remark after this would be bathos.

Salt--that eminently "briny chap"--having been discovered in a cloud of tobacco-smoke at the
Anchor Tavern, Mr. Glegg commenced inquiries which turned out satisfactorily enough to warrant
the advance of the "nest-egg," to which aunt Glegg contributed twenty pounds; and in this modest
beginning you see the ground of a fact which might otherwise surprise you; namely, Tom's accumulation
of a fund, unknown to his father, that promised in no very long time to meet the more tardy
process of saving, and quite cover the deficit. When once his attention had been turned to
this source of gain, Tom determined to make the most of it, and lost on opportunity of obtaining
information and extending his small enterprises. In not telling his father, he was influenced
by that strange mixture of opposite feelings which often gives equal truth to those who blame
an action and those who admire it,--partly, it was that disinclination to confidence which
is seen between near kindred, that family repulsion which spoils the most sacred relations
of our lives; partly, it was the desire to surprise his father with a great joy. He did not
see that it would have been better to soothe the interval with a new hope, and prevent the
delirium of a too sudden elation.

At the time of Maggie's first meeting with Philip, Tom had already nearly a hundred and fifty
pounds of his own capital; and while they were walking by the evening light in the Red Deeps,
he, by the same evening light, was riding into Laceham, proud of being on his first journey
on behalf of Guest & Co., and revolving in his mind all the chances that by the end of another
year he should have doubled his gains, lifted off the obloquy of debt from his father's name,
and perhaps--for he should be twenty-one--have got a new start for himself, on a higher platform
of employment. Did he not desire it? He was quite sure that he did.

Chapter III

The Wavering Balance

I said that Maggie went home that evening from the Red Deeps with a mental conflict already
begun. You have seen clearly enough, in her interview with Philip, what that conflict was.
Here suddenly was an opening in the rocky wall which shut in the narrow valley of humiliation,
where all her prospect was the remote, unfathomed sky; and some of the memory-haunting earthly
delights were no longer out of her reach. She might have books, converse, affection; she might
hear tidings of the world from which her mind had not yet lost its sense of exile; and it would
be a kindness to Philip too, who was pitiable,--clearly not happy. And perhaps here was an
opportunity indicated for making her mind more worthy of its highest service; perhaps the noblest,
completest devoutness could hardly exist without some width of knowledge; must she always live
in this resigned imprisonment? It was so blameless, so good a thing that there should be friendship
between her and Philip; the motives that forbade it were so unreasonable, so unchristian! But
the severe monotonous warning came again and again,--that she was losing the simplicity and
clearness of her life by admitting a ground of concealment; and that, by forsaking the simple
rule of renunciation, she was throwing herself under the seductive guidance of illimitable
wants. She thought she had won strength to obey the warning before she allowed herself the
next week to turn her steps in the evening to the Red Deeps. But while she was resolved to
say an affectionate farewell to Philip, how she looked forward to that evening walk in the
still, fleckered shade of the hollows, away from all that was harsh and unlovely; to the affectionate,
admiring looks that would meet her; to the sense of comradeship that childish memories would
give to wiser, older talk; to the certainty that Philip would care to hear everything she said,
which no one else cared for! It was a half-hour that it would be very hard to turn her back
upon, with the sense that there would be no other like it. Yet she said what she meant to say;
she looked firm as well as sad.

"Philip, I have made up my mind; it is right that we should give each other up, in everything
but memory. I could not see you without concealment--stay, I know what you are going to say,--it
is other people's wrong feelings that make concealment necessary; but concealment is bad, however
it may be caused. I feel that it would be bad for me, for us both. And then, if our secret
were discovered, there would be nothing but misery,--dreadful anger; and then we must part
after all, and it would be harder, when we were used to seeing each other."

Philip's face had flushed, and there was a momentary eagerness of expression, as if he had
been about to resist this decision with all his might.

But he controlled himself, and said, with assumed calmness: "Well, Maggie, if we must part,
let us try and forget it for one half hour; let us talk together a little while, for the last
time."

He took her hand, and Maggie felt no reason to withdraw it; his quietness made her all the
more sure she had given him great pain, and she wanted to show him how unwillingly she had
given it. They walked together hand in hand in silence.

"Let us sit down in the hollow," said Philip, "where we stood the last time. See how the dog-roses
have strewed the ground, and spread their opal petals over it."

They sat down at the roots of the slanting ash.

"I've begun my picture of you among the Scotch firs, Maggie," said Philip, "so you must let
me study your face a little, while you stay,--since I am not to see it again. Please turn your
head this way."

This was said in an entreating voice, and it would have been very hard of Maggie to refuse.
The full, lustrous face, with the bright black coronet, looked down like that of a divinity
well pleased to be worshipped, on the pale-hued, small-featured face that was turned up to it.

"I shall be sitting for my second portrait then," she said, smiling. "Will it be larger than
the other?"

"Oh yes, much larger. It is an oil-painting. You will look like a tall Hamadryad, dark and
strong and noble, just issued from one of the fir-trees, when the stems are casting their afternoon
shadows on the grass."

"You seem to think more of painting than of anything now, Philip?"

"Perhaps I do," said Philip, rather sadly; "but I think of too many things,--sow all sorts
of seeds, and get no great harvest from any one of them. I'm cursed with susceptibility in
every direction, and effective faculty in none. I care for painting and music; I care for classic
literature, and mediæval literature, and modern literature; I flutter all ways, and fly in none."

"But surely that is a happiness to have so many tastes,--to enjoy so many beautiful things,
when they are within your reach," said Maggie, musingly. "It always seemed to me a sort of
clever stupidity only to have one sort of talent,--almost like a carrier-pigeon."

"It might be a happiness to have many tastes if I were like other men," said Philip, bitterly.
"I might get some power and distinction by mere mediocrity, as they do; at least I should get
those middling satisfactions which make men contented to do without great ones. I might think
society at St. Ogg's agreeable then. But nothing could make life worth the purchase-money of
pain to me, but some faculty that would lift me above the dead level of provincial existence.
Yes, there is one thing,--a passion answers as well as a faculty."

Maggie did not hear the last words; she was struggling against the consciousness that Philip's
words had set her own discontent vibrating again as it used to do.

"I understand what you mean," she said, "though I know so much less than you do. I used to
think I could never bear life if it kept on being the same every day, and I must always be
doing things of no consequence, and never know anything greater. But, dear Philip, I think
we are only like children that some one who is wiser is taking care of. Is it not right to
resign ourselves entirely, whatever may be denied us? I have found great peace in that for
the last two or three years, even joy in subduing my own will."

"Yes, Maggie," said Philip, vehemently; "and you are shutting yourself up in a narrow, self-delusive
fanaticism, which is only a way of escaping pain by starving into dulness all the highest powers
of your nature. Joy and peace are not resignation; resignation is the willing endurance of
a pain that is not allayed, that you don't expect to be allayed. Stupefaction is not resignation;
and it is stupefaction to remain in ignorance,--to shut up all the avenues by which the life
of your fellow-men might become known to you. I am not resigned; I am not sure that life is
long enough to learn that lesson. You are not resigned; you are only trying to stupefy yourself."

Maggie's lips trembled; she felt there was some truth in what Philip said, and yet there was
a deeper consciousness that, for any immediate application it had to her conduct, it was no
better than falsity. Her double impression corresponded to the double impulse of the speaker.
Philip seriously believed what he said, but he said it with vehemence because it made an argument
against the resolution that opposed his wishes. But Maggie's face, made more childlike by the
gathering tears, touched him with a tenderer, less egotistic feeling. He took her hand and
said gently:

Don't let us think of such things in this short half-hour, Maggie. Let us only care about being
together. We shall be friends in spite of separation. We shall always think of each other.
I shall be glad to live as long as you are alive, because I shall think there may always come
a time when I can--when you will let me help you in some way."

"What a dear, good brother you would have been, Philip," said Maggie, smiling through the haze
of tears. "I think you would have made as much fuss about me, and been as pleased for me to
love you, as would have satisfied even me. You would have loved me well enough to bear with
me, and forgive me everything. That was what I always longed that Tom should do. I was never
satisfied with a little of anything. That is why it is better for me to do without earthly
happiness altogether. I never felt that I had enough music,--I wanted more instruments playing
together; I wanted voices to be fuller and deeper. Do you ever sing now, Philip?" she added
abruptly, as if she had forgotten what went before.

"Yes," he said, "every day, almost. But my voice is only middling, like everything else in me."

"Oh, sing me something,--just one song. I may listen to that before I go,--something you used
to sing at Lorton on a Saturday afternoon, when we had the drawing-room all to ourselves, and
I put my apron over my head to listen."

"I know," said Philip; and Maggie buried her face in her hands while he sang sotto voce, "Love
in her eyes sits playing," and then said, "That's it, isn't it?"

"Oh no, I won't stay," said Maggie, starting up. "It will only haunt me. Let us walk, Philip.
I must go home."

She moved away, so that he was obliged to rise and follow her.

"Maggie," he said, in a tone of remonstrance, "don't persist in this wilful, senseless privation.
It makes me wretched to see you benumbing and cramping your nature in this way. You were so
full of life when you were a child; I thought you would be a brilliant woman,--all wit and
bright imagination. And it flashes out in your face still, until you draw that veil of dull
quiescence over it."

"Why do you speak so bitterly to me, Philip?" said Maggie.

"Because I foresee it will not end well; you can never carry on this self-torture."

"I shall have strength given me," said Maggie, tremulously.

"No, you will not, Maggie; no one has strength given to do what is unnatural. It is mere cowardice
to seek safety in negations. No character becomes strong in that way. You will be thrown into
the world some day, and then every rational satisfaction of your nature that you deny now will
assault you like a savage appetite."

Maggie started and paused, looking at Philip with alarm in her face.

"Philip, how dare you shake me in this way? You are a tempter."

"No, I am not; but love gives insight, Maggie, and insight often gives foreboding. Listen to
me,--let me supply you with books; do let me see you sometimes,--be your brother and teacher,
as you said at Lorton. It is less wrong that you should see me than that you should be committing
this long suicide."

Maggie felt unable to speak. She shook her head and walked on in silence, till they came to
the end of the Scotch firs, and she put out her hand in sign of parting.

"Do you banish me from this place forever, then, Maggie? Surely I may come and walk in it sometimes?
If I meet you by chance, there is no concealment in that?"

It is the moment when our resolution seems about to become irrevocable--when the fatal iron
gates are about to close upon us--that tests our strength. Then, after hours of clear reasoning
and firm conviction, we snatch at any sophistry that will nullify our long struggles, and bring
us the defeat that we love better than victory.

Maggie felt her heart leap at this subterfuge of Philip's, and there passed over her face that
almost imperceptible shock which accompanies any relief. He saw it, and they parted in silence.

Philip's sense of the situation was too complete for him not to be visited with glancing fears
lest he had been intervening too presumptuously in the action of Maggie's conscience, perhaps
for a selfish end. But no!--he persuaded himself his end was not selfish. He had little hope
that Maggie would ever return the strong feeling he had for her; and it must be better for
Maggie's future life, when these petty family obstacles to her freedom had disappeared, that
the present should not be entirely sacrificed, and that she should have some opportunity of
culture,--some interchange with a mind above the vulgar level of those she was now condemned
to live with. If we only look far enough off for the consequence of our actions, we can always
find some point in the combination of results by which those actions can be justified; by adopting
the point of view of a Providence who arranges results, or of a philosopher who traces them,
we shall find it possible to obtain perfect complacency in choosing to do what is most agreeable
to us in the present moment. And it was in this way that Philip justified his subtle efforts
to overcome Maggie's true prompting against a concealment that would introduce doubleness into
her own mind, and might cause new misery to those who had the primary natural claim on her.
But there was a surplus of passion in him that made him half independent of justifying motives.
His longing to see Maggie, and make an element in her life, had in it some of that savage impulse
to snatch an offered joy which springs from a life in which the mental and bodily constitution
have made pain predominate. He had not his full share in the common good of men; he could not
even pass muster with the insignificant, but must be singled out for pity, and excepted from
what was a matter of course with others. Even to Maggie he was an exception; it was clear that
the thought of his being her lover had never entered her mind.

Do not think too hardly of Philip. Ugly and deformed people have great need of unusual virtues,
because they are likely to be extremely uncomfortable without them; but the theory that unusual
virtues spring by a direct consequence out of personal disadvantages, as animals get thicker
wool in severe climates, is perhaps a little overstrained. The temptations of beauty are much
dwelt upon, but I fancy they only bear the same relation to those of ugliness, as the temptation
to excess at a feast, where the delights are varied for eye and ear as well as palate, bears
to the temptations that assail the desperation of hunger. Does not the Hunger Tower stand as
the type of the utmost trial to what is human in us?

Philip had never been soothed by that mother's love which flows out to us in the greater abundance
because our need is greater, which clings to us the more tenderly because we are the less likely
to be winners in the game of life; and the sense of his father's affection and indulgence toward
him was marred by the keener perception of his father's faults. Kept aloof from all practical
life as Philip had been, and by nature half feminine in sensitiveness, he had some of the woman's
intolerant repulsion toward worldliness and the deliberate pursuit of sensual enjoyment; and
this one strong natural tie in his life,--his relation as a son,--was like an aching limb to
him. Perhaps there is inevitably something morbid in a human being who is in any way unfavorably
excepted from ordinary conditions, until the good force has had time to triumph; and it has
rarely had time for that at two-and-twenty. That force was present in Philip in much strength,
but the sun himself looks feeble through the morning mists.

Chapter IV

Another Love-Scene

Early in the following April, nearly a year after that dubious parting you have just witnessed,
you may, if you like, again see Maggie entering the Red Deeps through the group of Scotch firs.
But it is early afternoon and not evening, and the edge of sharpness in the spring air makes
her draw her large shawl close about her and trip along rather quickly; though she looks round,
as usual, that she may take in the sight of her beloved trees. There is a more eager, inquiring
look in her eyes than there was last June, and a smile is hovering about her lips, as if some
playful speech were awaiting the right hearer. The hearer was not long in appearing.

"Take back your Corinne," said Maggie, drawing a book from under her shawl. "You were right
in telling me she would do me no good; but you were wrong in thinking I should wish to be like
her."

"Wouldn't you really like to be a tenth Muse, then, Maggie?" said Philip looking up in her
face as we look at a first parting in the clouds that promises us a bright heaven once more.

"Not at all," said Maggie, laughing. "The Muses were uncomfortable goddesses, I think,--obliged
always to carry rolls and musical instruments about with them. If I carried a harp in this
climate, you know, I must have a green baize cover for it; and I should be sure to leave it
behind me by mistake."

"You agree with me in not liking Corinne, then?"

"I didn't finish the book," said Maggie. "As soon as I came to the blond-haired young lady
reading in the park, I shut it up, and determined to read no further. I foresaw that that light-complexioned
girl would win away all the love from Corinne and make her miserable. I'm determined to read
no more books where the blond-haired women carry away all the happiness. I should begin to
have a prejudice against them. If you could give me some story, now, where the dark woman triumphs,
it would restore the balance. I want to avenge Rebecca and Flora MacIvor and Minna, and all
the rest of the dark unhappy ones. Since you are my tutor, you ought to preserve my mind from
prejudices; you are always arguing against prejudices."

"Well, perhaps you will avenge the dark women in your own person, and carry away all the love
from your cousin Lucy. She is sure to have some handsome young man of St. Ogg's at her feet
now; and you have only to shine upon him--your fair little cousin will be quite quenched in
your beams."

"Philip, that is not pretty of you, to apply my nonsense to anything real," said Maggie, looking
hurt. "As if I, with my old gowns and want of all accomplishments, could be a rival of dear
little Lucy,--who knows and does all sorts of charming things, and is ten times prettier than
I am,--even if I were odious and base enough to wish to be her rival. Besides, I never go to
aunt Deane's when any one is there; it is only because dear Lucy is good, and loves me, that
she comes to see me, and will have me go to see her sometimes."

"Maggie," said Philip, with surprise, "it is not like you to take playfulness literally. You
must have been in St. Ogg's this morning, and brought away a slight infection of dulness."

"Well," said Maggie, smiling, "if you meant that for a joke, it was a poor one; but I thought
it was a very good reproof. I thought you wanted to remind me that I am vain, and wish every
one to admire me most. But it isn't for that that I'm jealous for the dark women,--not because
I'm dark myself; it's because I always care the most about the unhappy people. If the blond
girl were forsaken, I should like her best. I always take the side of the rejected lover in
the stories."

"Then you would never have the heart to reject one yourself, should you, Maggie?" said Philip,
flushing a little.

"I don't know," said Maggie, hesitatingly. Then with a bright smile, "I think perhaps I could
if he were very conceited; and yet, if he got extremely humiliated afterward, I should relent."

"I've often wondered, Maggie," Philip said, with some effort, "whether you wouldn't really
be more likely to love a man that other women were not likely to love."

"That would depend on what they didn't like him for," said Maggie, laughing. "He might be very
disagreeable. He might look at me through an eye-glass stuck in his eye, making a hideous face,
as young Torry does. I should think other women are not fond of that; but I never felt any
pity for young Torry. I've never any pity for conceited people, because I think they carry
their comfort about with them."

"But suppose, Maggie,--suppose it was a man who was not conceited, who felt he had nothing
to be conceited about; who had been marked from childhood for a peculiar kind of suffering,
and to whom you were the day-star of his life; who loved you, worshipped you, so entirely that
he felt it happiness enough for him if you would let him see you at rare moments----"

Philip paused with a pang of dread lest his confession should cut short this very happiness,--a
pang of the same dread that had kept his love mute through long months. A rush of self-consciousness
told him that he was besotted to have said all this. Maggie's manner this morning had been
as unconstrained and indifferent as ever.

But she was not looking indifferent now. Struck with the unusual emotion in Philip's tone,
she had turned quickly to look at him; and as he went on speaking, a great change came over
her face,--a flush and slight spasm of the features, such as we see in people who hear some
news that will require them to readjust their conceptions of the past. She was quite silent,
and walking on toward the trunk of a fallen tree, she sat down, as if she had no strength to
spare for her muscles. She was trembling.

"Maggie," said Philip, getting more and more alarmed in every fresh moment of silence, "I was
a fool to say it; forget that I've said it. I shall be contented if things can be as they were."

The distress with which he spoke urged Maggie to say something. "I am so surprised, Philip;
I had not thought of it." And the effort to say this brought the tears down too.

"Has it made you hate me, Maggie?" said Philip, impetuously. "Do you think I'm a presumptuous
fool?"

"Oh, Philip!" said Maggie, "how can you think I have such feelings? As if I were not grateful
for any love. But--but I had never thought of your being my lover. It seemed so far off--like
a dream--only like one of the stories one imagines--that I should ever have a lover."

"Then can you bear to think of me as your lover, Maggie?" said Philip, seating himself by her,
and taking her hand, in the elation of a sudden hope. "Do you love me?"

Maggie turned rather pale; this direct question seemed not easy to answer. But her eyes met
Philip's, which were in this moment liquid and beautiful with beseeching love. She spoke with
hesitation, yet with sweet, simple, girlish tenderness.

"I think I could hardly love any one better; there is nothing but what I love you for." She
paused a little while, and then added: "But it will be better for us not to say any more about
it, won't it, dear Philip? You know we couldn't even be friends, if our friendship were discovered.
I have never felt that I was right in giving way about seeing you, though it has been so precious
to me in some ways; and now the fear comes upon me strongly again, that it will lead to evil."

"But no evil has come, Maggie; and if you had been guided by that fear before, you would only
have lived through another dreary, benumbing year, instead of reviving into your real self."

Maggie shook her head. "It has been very sweet, I know,--all the talking together, and the
books, and the feeling that I had the walk to look forward to, when I could tell you the thoughts
that had come into my head while I was away from you. But it has made me restless; it has made
me think a great deal about the world; and I have impatient thoughts again,--I get weary of
my home; and then it cuts me to the heart afterward, that I should ever have felt weary of
my father and mother. I think what you call being benumbed was better--better for me--for then
my selfish desires were benumbed."

Philip had risen again, and was walking backward and forward impatiently.

"No, Maggie, you have wrong ideas of self-conquest, as I've often told you. What you call self-conquest--binding
and deafening yourself to all but one train of impressions--is only the culture of monomania
in a nature like yours."

He had spoken with some irritation, but now he sat down by her again and took her hand.

"Don't think of the past now, Maggie; think only of our love. If you can really cling to me
with all your heart, every obstacle will be overcome in time; we need only wait. I can live
on hope. Look at me, Maggie; tell me again it is possible for you to love me. Don't look away
from me to that cloven tree; it is a bad omen."

She turned her large dark glance upon him with a sad smile.

"Come, Maggie, say one kind word, or else you were better to me at Lorton. You asked me if
I should like you to kiss me,--don't you remember?--and you promised to kiss me when you met
me again. You never kept the promise."

The recollection of that childish time came as a sweet relief to Maggie. It made the present
moment less strange to her. She kissed him almost as simply and quietly as she had done when
she was twelve years old. Philip's eyes flashed with delight, but his next words were words
of discontent.

"You don't seem happy enough, Maggie; you are forcing yourself to say you love me, out of pity."

"No, Philip," said Maggie, shaking her head, in her old childish way; "I'm telling you the
truth. It is all new and strange to me; but I don't think I could love any one better than
I love you. I should like always to live with you--to make you happy. I have always been happy
when I have been with you. There is only one thing I will not do for your sake; I will never
do anything to wound my father. You must never ask that from me."

"No, Maggie, I will ask nothing; I will bear everything; I'll wait another year only for a
kiss, if you will only give me the first place in your heart."

"No," said Maggie, smiling, "I won't make you wait so long as that." But then, looking serious
again, she added, as she rose from her seat,--

"But what would your own father say, Philip? Oh, it is quite impossible we can ever be more
than friends,--brother and sister in secret, as we have been. Let us give up thinking of everything
else."

"No, Maggie, I can't give you up,--unless you are deceiving me; unless you really only care
for me as if I were your brother. Tell me the truth."

"Indeed I do, Philip. What happiness have I ever had so great as being with you,--since I was
a little girl,--the days Tom was good to me? And your mind is a sort of world to me; you can
tell me all I want to know. I think I should never be tired of being with you."

They were walking hand in hand, looking at each other; Maggie, indeed, was hurrying along,
for she felt it time to be gone. But the sense that their parting was near made her more anxious
lest she should have unintentionally left some painful impression on Philip's mind. It was
one of those dangerous moments when speech is at once sincere and deceptive; when feeling,
rising high above its average depth, leaves floodmarks which are never reached again.

They stopped to part among the Scotch firs.

"Then my life will be filled with hope, Maggie, and I shall be happier than other men, in spite
of all? We do belong to each other--for always--whether we are apart or together?"

"Yes, Philip; I should like never to part; I should like to make your life very happy."

"I am waiting for something else. I wonder whether it will come."

Maggie smiled, with glistening tears, and then stooped her tall head to kiss the pale face
that was full of pleading, timid love,--like a woman's.

She had a moment of real happiness then,--a moment of belief that, if there were sacrifice
in this love, it was all the richer and more satisfying.

She turned away and hurried home, feeling that in the hour since she had trodden this road
before, a new era had begun for her. The tissue of vague dreams must now get narrower and narrower,
and all the threads of thought and emotion be gradually absorbed in the woof of her actual
daily life.

Chapter V

The Cloven Tree

Secrets are rarely betrayed or discovered according to any programme our fear has sketched
out. Fear is almost always haunted by terrible dramatic scenes, which recur in spite of the
best-argued probabilities against them; and during a year that Maggie had had the burthen of
concealment on her mind, the possibility of discovery had continually presented itself under
the form of a sudden meeting with her father or Tom when she was walking with Philip in the
Red Deeps. She was aware that this was not one of the most likely events; but it was the scene
that most completely symbolized her inward dread. Those slight indirect suggestions which are
dependent on apparently trivial coincidences and incalculable states of mind, are the favorite
machinery of Fact, but are not the stuff in which Imagination is apt to work.

Certainly one of the persons about whom Maggie's fears were furthest from troubling themselves
was her aunt Pullet, on whom, seeing that she did not live in St. Ogg's, and was neither sharp-eyed
nor sharp-tempered, it would surely have been quite whimsical of them to fix rather than on
aunt Glegg. And yet the channel of fatality--the pathway of the lightning--was no other than
aunt Pullet. She did not live at St. Ogg's, but the road from Garum Firs lay by the Red Deeps,
at the end opposite that by which Maggie entered.

The day after Maggie's last meeting with Philip, being a Sunday on which Mr. Pullet was bound
to appear in funeral hatband and scarf at St. Ogg's church, Mrs. Pullet made this the occasion
of dining with sister Glegg, and taking tea with poor sister Tulliver. Sunday was the one day
in the week on which Tom was at home in the afternoon; and today the brighter spirits he had
been in of late had flowed over in unusually cheerful open chat with his father, and in the
invitation, "Come, Magsie, you come too!" when he strolled out with his mother in the garden
to see the advancing cherry-blossoms. He had been better pleased with Maggie since she had
been less odd and ascetic; he was even getting rather proud of her; several persons had remarked
in his hearing that his sister was a very fine girl. To-day there was a peculiar brightness
in her face, due in reality to an undercurrent of excitement, which had as much doubt and pain
as pleasure in it; but it might pass for a sign of happiness.

"You look very well, my dear," said aunt Pullet, shaking her head sadly, as they sat round
the tea-table. "I niver thought your girl 'ud be so good-looking, Bessy. But you must wear
pink, my dear; that blue thing as your aunt Glegg gave you turns you into a crowflower. Jane
never was tasty. Why don't you wear that gown o' mine?"

"It is so pretty and so smart, aunt. I think it's too showy for me,--at least for my other
clothes, that I must wear with it.

"To be sure, it 'ud be unbecoming if it wasn't well known you've got them belonging to you
as can afford to give you such things when they've done with 'em themselves. It stands to reason
I must give my own niece clothes now and then,--such things as I buy every year, and never
wear anything out. And as for Lucy, there's no giving to her, for she's got everything o' the
choicest; sister Deane may well hold her head up,--though she looks dreadful yallow, poor thing--I
doubt this liver complaint 'ull carry her off. That's what this new vicar, this Dr. Kenn, said
in the funeral sermon to-day."

"Ah, he's a wonderful preacher, by all account,--isn't he, Sophy?" said Mrs. Tulliver.

"Why, Lucy had got a collar on this blessed day," continued Mrs. Pullet, with her eyes fixed
in a ruminating manner, "as I don't say I haven't got as good, but I must look out my best
to match it."

"Miss Lucy's called the bell o' St. Ogg's, they say; that's a cur'ous word," observed Mr. Pullet,
on whom the mysteries of etymology sometimes fell with an oppressive weight.

"Pooh!" said Mr. Tulliver, jealous for Maggie, "she's a small thing, not much of a figure.
But fine feathers make fine birds. I see nothing to admire so much in those diminutive women;
they look silly by the side o' the men,--out o' proportion. When I chose my wife, I chose her
the right size,--neither too little nor too big."

The poor wife, with her withered beauty, smiled complacently.

"But the men aren't all big," said uncle Pullet, not without some self-reference; "a young
fellow may be good-looking and yet not be a six-foot, like Master Tom here.

"Ah, it's poor talking about littleness and bigness,--anybody may think it's a mercy they're
straight," said aunt Pullet. "There's that mismade son o' Lawyer Wakem's, I saw him at church
to-day. Dear, dear! to think o' the property he's like to have; and they say he's very queer
and lonely, doesn't like much company. I shouldn't wonder if he goes out of his mind; for we
never come along the road but he's a-scrambling out o' the trees and brambles at the Red Deeps."

This wide statement, by which Mrs. Pullet represented the fact that she had twice seen Philip
at the spot indicated, produced an effect on Maggie which was all the stronger because Tom
sate opposite her, and she was intensely anxious to look indifferent. At Philip's name she
had blushed, and the blush deepened every instant from consciousness, until the mention of
the Red Deeps made her feel as if the whole secret were betrayed, and she dared not even hold
her tea-spoon lest she should show how she trembled. She sat with her hands clasped under the
table, not daring to look round. Happily, her father was seated on the same side with herself,
beyond her uncle Pullet, and could not see her face without stooping forward. Her mother's
voice brought the first relief, turning the conversation; for Mrs. Tulliver was always alarmed
when the name of Wakem was mentioned in her husband's presence. Gradually Maggie recovered
composure enough to look up; her eyes met Tom's, but he turned away his head immediately; and
she went to bed that night wondering if he had gathered any suspicion from her confusion. Perhaps
not; perhaps he would think it was only her alarm at her aunt's mention of Wakem before her
father; that was the interpretation her mother had put in it. To her father, Wakem was like
a disfiguring disease, of which he was obliged to endure the consciousness, but was exasperated
to have the existence recognized by others; and no amount of sensitiveness in her about her
father could be surprising, Maggie thought.

But Tom was too keen-sighted to rest satisfied with such an interpretation; he had seen clearly
enough that there was something distinct from anxiety about her father in Maggie's excessive
confusion. In trying to recall all the details that could give shape to his suspicions, he
remembered only lately hearing his mother scold Maggie for walking in the Red Deeps when the
ground was wet, and bringing home shoes clogged with red soil; still Tom, retaining all his
old repulsion for Philip's deformity, shrank from attributing to his sister the probability
of feeling more than a friendly interest in such an unfortunate exception to the common run
of men. Tom's was a nature which had a sort of superstitious repugnance to everything exceptional.
A love for a deformed man would be odious in any woman, in a sister intolerable. But if she
had been carrying on any kind of intercourse whatever with Philip, a stop must be put to it
at once; she was disobeying her father's strongest feelings and her brother's express commands,
besides compromising herself by secret meetings. He left home the next morning in that watchful
state of mind which turns the most ordinary course of things into pregnant coincidences.

That afternoon, about half-past three o'clock, Tom was standing on the wharf, talking with
Bob Jakin about the probability of the good ship Adelaide coming in, in a day or two, with
results highly important to both of them.

"Eh," said Bob, parenthetically, as he looked over the fields on the other side of the river,
"there goes that crooked young Wakem. I know him or his shadder as far off as I can see 'em;
I'm allays lighting on him o' that side the river."

A sudden thought seemed to have darted through Tom's mind. "I must go, Bob," he said; "I've
something to attend to," hurrying off to the warehouse, where he left notice for some one to
take his place; he was called away home on peremptory business.

The swiftest pace and the shortest road took him to the gate, and he was pausing to open it
deliberately, that he might walk into the house with an appearance of perfect composure, when
Maggie came out at the front door in bonnet and shawl. His conjecture was fulfilled, and he
waited for her at the gate. She started violently when she saw him.

"Tom, how is it you are come home? Is there anything the matter?" Maggie spoke in a low, tremulous
voice.

"I'm come to walk with you to the Red Deeps, and meet Philip Wakem," said Tom, the central
fold in his brow, which had become habitual with him, deepening as he spoke.

Maggie stood helpless, pale and cold. By some means, then, Tom knew everything. At last she
said, "I'm, not going," and turned round.

"Yes, you are; but I want to speak to you first. Where is my father?"

"Out on horseback."

"And my mother?"

"In the yard, I think, with the poultry."

"I can go in, then, without her seeing me?"

They walked in together, and Tom, entering the parlor, said to Maggie, "Come in here."

She obeyed, and he closed the door behind her.

"Now, Maggie, tell me this instant everything that has passed between you and Philip Wakem."

"Does my father know anything?" said Maggie, still trembling.

"No," said Tom indignantly. "But he shall know, if you attempt to use deceit toward me any
further."

"I don't wish to use deceit," said Maggie, flushing into resentment at hearing this word applied
to her conduct.

"Tell me the whole truth, then."

"Perhaps you know it."

"Never mind whether I know it or not. Tell me exactly what has happened, or my father shall
know everything."

"I tell it for my father's sake, then."

"Yes, it becomes you to profess affection for your father, when you have despised his strongest
feelings."

"You never do wrong, Tom," said Maggie, tauntingly.

"Not if I know it," answered Tom, with proud sincerity.

"But I have nothing to say to you beyond this: tell me what has passed between you and Philip
Wakem. When did you first meet him in the Red Deeps?"

"A year ago," said Maggie, quietly. Tom's severity gave her a certain fund of defiance, and
kept her sense of error in abeyance. "You need ask me no more questions. We have been friendly
a year. We have met and walked together often. He has lent me books."

"Is that all?" said Tom, looking straight at her with his frown.

Maggie paused a moment; then, determined to make an end of Tom's right to accuse her of deceit,
she said haughtily:

"No, not quite all. On Saturday he told me that he loved me. I didn't think of it before then;
I had only thought of him as an old friend."

"And you encouraged him?" said Tom, with an expression of disgust.

"I told him that I loved him too."

Tom was silent a few moments, looking on the ground and frowning, with his hands in his pockets.
At last he looked up and said coldly,--

"Now, then, Maggie, there are but two courses for you to take,--either you vow solemnly to
me, with your hand on my father's Bible, that you will never have another meeting or speak
another word in private with Philip Wakem, or you refuse, and I tell my father everything;
and this month, when by my exertions he might be made happy once more, you will cause him the
blow of knowing that you are a disobedient, deceitful daughter, who throws away her own respectability
by clandestine meetings with the son of a man that has helped to ruin her father. Choose!"
Tom ended with cold decision, going up to the large Bible, drawing it forward, and opening
it at the fly-leaf, where the writing was.

It was a crushing alternative to Maggie.

"Tom," she said, urged out of pride into pleading, "don't ask me that. I will promise you to
give up all intercourse with Philip, if you will let me see him once, or even only write to
him and explain everything,--to give it up as long as it would ever cause any pain to my father.
I feel something for Philip too. He is not happy."

"I don't wish to hear anything of your feelings; I have said exactly what I mean. Choose, and
quickly, lest my mother should come in."

"If I give you my word, that will be as strong a bond to me as if I laid my hand on the Bible.
I don't require that to bind me."

"Do what I require," said Tom. "I can't trust you, Maggie. There is no consistency in you.
Put your hand on this Bible, and say, 'I renounce all private speech and intercourse with Philip
Wakem from this time forth.' Else you will bring shame on us all, and grief on my father; and
what is the use of my exerting myself and giving up everything else for the sake of paying
my father's debts, if you are to bring madness and vexation on him, just when he might be easy
and hold up his head once more?"

"Oh, Tom, will the debts be paid soon?" said Maggie, clasping her hands, with a sudden flash
of joy across her wretchedness.

"If things turn out as I expect," said Tom. "But," he added, his voice trembling with indignation,
"while I have been contriving and working that my father may have some peace of mind before
he dies,--working for the respectability of our family,--you have done all you can to destroy
both."

Maggie felt a deep movement of compunction; for the moment, her mind ceased to contend against
what she felt to be cruel and unreasonable, and in her self-blame she justified her brother.

"Tom," she said in a low voice, "it was wrong of me; but I was so lonely, and I was sorry for
Philip. And I think enmity and hatred are wicked."

"Nonsense!" said Tom. "Your duty was clear enough. Say no more; but promise, in the words I
told you."

"I must speak to Philip once more."

"You will go with me now and speak to him."

"I give you my word not to meet him or write to him again without your knowledge. That is the
only thing I will say. I will put my hand on the Bible if you like."

"Say it, then."

Maggie laid her hand on the page of manuscript and repeated the promise. Tom closed the book,
and said, "Now let us go."

Not a word was spoken as they walked along. Maggie was suffering in anticipation of what Philip
was about to suffer, and dreading the galling words that would fall on him from Tom's lips;
but she felt it was in vain to attempt anything but submission. Tom had his terrible clutch
on her conscience and her deepest dread; she writhed under the demonstrable truth of the character
he had given to her conduct, and yet her whole soul rebelled against it as unfair from its
incompleteness. He, meanwhile, felt the impetus of his indignation diverted toward Philip.
He did not know how much of an old boyish repulsion and of mere personal pride and animosity
was concerned in the bitter severity of the words by which he meant to do the duty of a son
and a brother. Tom was not given to inquire subtly into his own motives any more than into
other matters of an intangible kind; he was quite sure that his own motives as well as actions
were good, else he would have had nothing to do with them.

Maggie's only hope was that something might, for the first time, have prevented Philip from
coming. Then there would be delay,--then she might get Tom's permission to write to him. Her
heart beat with double violence when they got under the Scotch firs. It was the last moment
of suspense, she thought; Philip always met her soon after she got beyond them. But they passed
across the more open green space, and entered the narrow bushy path by the mound. Another turning,
and they came so close upon him that both Tom and Philip stopped suddenly within a yard of
each other. There was a moment's silence, in which Philip darted a look of inquiry at Maggie's
face. He saw an answer there, in the pale, parted lips, and the terrified tension of the large
eyes. Her imagination, always rushing extravagantly beyond an immediate impression, saw her
tall, strong brother grasping the feeble Philip bodily, crushing him and trampling on him.

"Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?" Tom said, in a voice of harsh
scorn, as soon as Philip's eyes were turned on him again.

"What do you mean?" answered Philip, haughtily.

"Mean? Stand farther from me, lest I should lay hands on you, and I'll tell you what I mean.
I mean, taking advantage of a young girl's foolishness and ignorance to get her to have secret
meetings with you. I mean, daring to trifle with the respectability of a family that has a
good and honest name to support."

"I deny that," interrupted Philip, impetuously. "I could never trifle with anything that affected
your sister's happiness. She is dearer to me than she is to you; I honor her more than you
can ever honor her; I would give up my life to her."

"Don't talk high-flown nonsense to me, sir! Do you mean to pretend that you didn't know it
would be injurious to her to meet you here week after week? Do you pretend you had any right
to make professions of love to her, even if you had been a fit husband for her, when neither
her father nor your father would ever consent to a marriage between you? And you,--you to try
and worm yourself into the affections of a handsome girl who is not eighteen, and has been
shut out from the world by her father's misfortunes! That's your crooked notion of honor, is
it? I call it base treachery; I call it taking advantage of circumstances to win what's too
good for you,--what you'd never get by fair means."

"It is manly of you to talk in this way to me," said Philip, bitterly, his whole frame shaken
by violent emotions. "Giants have an immemorial right to stupidity and insolent abuse. You
are incapable even of understanding what I feel for your sister. I feel so much for her that
I could even desire to be at friendship with you."

"I should be very sorry to understand your feelings," said Tom, with scorching contempt. "What
I wish is that you should understand me,--that I shall take care of my sister, and that if
you dare to make the least attempt to come near her, or to write to her, or to keep the slightest
hold on her mind, your puny, miserable body, that ought to have put some modesty into your
mind, shall not protect you. I'll thrash you; I'll hold you up to public scorn. Who wouldn't
laugh at the idea of your turning lover to a fine girl?"

Tom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards. He burst out, in a convulsed voice.

"Stay, Maggie!" said Philip, making a strong effort to speak. Then looking at Tom, "You have
dragged your sister here, I suppose, that she may stand by while you threaten and insult me.
These naturally seemed to you the right means to influence me. But you are mistaken. Let your
sister speak. If she says she is bound to give me up, I shall abide by her wishes to the slightest
word."

"It was for my father's sake, Philip," said Maggie, imploringly. "Tom threatens to tell my
father, and he couldn't bear it; I have promised, I have vowed solemnly, that we will not have
any intercourse without my brother's knowledge."

"It is enough, Maggie. I shall not change; but I wish you to hold yourself entirely free. But
trust me; remember that I can never seek for anything but good to what belongs to you."

"Yes," said Tom, exasperated by this attitude of Philip's, "you can talk of seeking good for
her and what belongs to her now; did you seek her good before?"

"I did,--at some risk, perhaps. But I wished her to have a friend for life,--who would cherish
her, who would do her more justice than a coarse and narrow-minded brother, that she has always
lavished her affections on."

"Yes, my way of befriending her is different from yours; and I'll tell you what is my way.
I'll save her from disobeying and disgracing her father; I'll save her from throwing herself
away on you,--from making herself a laughing-stock,--from being flouted by a man like your
father, because she's not good enough for his son. You know well enough what sort of justice
and cherishing you were preparing for her. I'm not to be imposed upon by fine words; I can
see what actions mean. Come away, Maggie."

He seized Maggie's right wrist as he spoke, and she put out her left hand. Philip clasped it
an instant, with one eager look, and then hurried away.

Tom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards. He was still holding her wrist tightly,
as if he were compelling a culprit from the scene of action. At last Maggie, with a violent
snatch, drew her hand away, and her pent-up, long-gathered irritation burst into utterance.

"Don't suppose that I think you are right, Tom, or that I bow to your will. I despise the feelings
you have shown in speaking to Philip; I detest your insulting, unmanly allusions to his deformity.
You have been reproaching other people all your life; you have been always sure you yourself
are right. It is because you have not a mind large enough to see that there is anything better
than your own conduct and your own petty aims."

"Certainly," said Tom, coolly. "I don't see that your conduct is better, or your aims either.
If your conduct, and Philip Wakem's conduct, has been right, why are you ashamed of its being
known? Answer me that. I know what I have aimed at in my conduct, and I've succeeded; pray,
what good has your conduct brought to you or any one else?"

"I don't want to defend myself," said Maggie, still with vehemence: "I know I've been wrong,--often,
continually. But yet, sometimes when I have done wrong, it has been because I have feelings
that you would be the better for, if you had them. If you were in fault ever, if you had done
anything very wrong, I should be sorry for the pain it brought you; I should not want punishment
to be heaped on you. But you have always enjoyed punishing me; you have always been hard and
cruel to me; even when I was a little girl, and always loved you better than any one else in
the world, you would let me go crying to bed without forgiving me. You have no pity; you have
no sense of your own imperfection and your own sins. It is a sin to be hard; it is not fitting
for a mortal, for a Christian. You are nothing but a Pharisee. You thank God for nothing but
your own virtues; you think they are great enough to win you everything else. You have not
even a vision of feelings by the side of which your shining virtues are mere darkness!"

"Well," said Tom, with cold scorn, "if your feelings are so much better than mine, let me see
you show them in some other way than by conduct that's likely to disgrace us all,--than by
ridiculous flights first into one extreme and then into another. Pray, how have you shown your
love, that you talk of, either to me or my father? By disobeying and deceiving us. I have a
different way of showing my affection."

"Because you are a man, Tom, and have power, and can do something in the world."

"Then, if you can do nothing, submit to those that can."

"So I will submit to what I acknowledge and feel to be right. I will submit even to what is
unreasonable from my father, but I will not submit to it from you. You boast of your virtues
as if they purchased you a right to be cruel and unmanly, as you've been to-day. Don't suppose
I would give up Philip Wakem in obedience to you. The deformity you insult would make me cling
to him and care for him the more."

"Very well; that is your view of things." said Tom, more coldly than ever; "you need say no
more to show me what a wide distance there is between us. Let us remember that in future, and
be silent."

Tom went back to St. Ogg's, to fulfill an appointment with his uncle Deane, and receive directions
about a journey on which he was to set out the next morning.

Maggie went up to her own room to pour out all that indignant remonstrance, against which Tom's
mind was close barred, in bitter tears. Then, when the first burst of unsatisfied anger was
gone by, came the recollection of that quiet time before the pleasure which had ended in to-day's
misery had perturbed the clearness and simplicity of her life. She used to think in that time
that she had made great conquests, and won a lasting stand on serene heights above worldly
temptations and conflict. And here she was down again in the thick of a hot strife with her
own and others' passions. Life was not so short, then, and perfect rest was not so near as
she had dreamed when she was two years younger. There was more struggle for her, and perhaps
more falling. If she had felt that she was entirely wrong, and that Tom had been entirely right,
she could sooner have recovered more inward harmony; but now her penitence and submission were
constantly obstructed by resentment that would present itself to her no otherwise than as a
just indignation. Her heart bled for Philip; she went on recalling the insults that had been
flung at him with so vivid a conception of what he had felt under them, that it was almost
like a sharp bodily pain to her, making her beat the floor with her foot and tighten her fingers
on her palm.

And yet, how was it that she was now and then conscious of a certain dim background of relief
in the forced separation from Philip? Surely it was only because the sense of a deliverance
from concealment was welcome at any cost.

Chapter VI

The Hard-Won Triumph

Three weeks later, when Dorlcote Mill was at its prettiest moment in all the year,--the great
chestnuts in blossom, and the grass all deep and daisied,--Tom Tulliver came home to it earlier
than usual in the evening, and as he passed over the bridge, he looked with the old deep-rooted
affection at the respectable red brick house, which always seemed cheerful and inviting outside,
let the rooms be as bare and the hearts as sad as they might inside. There is a very pleasant
light in Tom's blue-gray eyes as he glances at the house-windows; that fold in his brow never
disappears, but it is not unbecoming; it seems to imply a strength of will that may possibly
be without harshness, when the eyes and mouth have their gentlest expression. His firm step
becomes quicker, and the corners of his mouth rebel against the compression which is meant
to forbid a smile.

The eyes in the parlor were not turned toward the bridge just then, and the group there was
sitting in unexpectant silence,--Mr. Tulliver in his arm-chair, tired with a long ride, and
ruminating with a worn look, fixed chiefly on Maggie, who was bending over her sewing while
her mother was making the tea.

They all looked up with surprise when they heard the well-known foot.

"Why, what's up now, Tom?" said his father. "You're a bit earlier than usual."

"Oh, there was nothing more for me to do, so I came away. Well, mother!"

Tom went up to his mother and kissed her, a sign of unusual good-humor with him. Hardly a word
or look had passed between him and Maggie in all the three weeks; but his usual incommunicativeness
at home prevented this from being noticeable to their parents.

"Father," said Tom, when they had finished tea, "do you know exactly how much money there is
in the tin box?"

"Only a hundred and ninety-three pound," said Mr. Tulliver. "You've brought less o' late; but
young fellows like to have their own way with their money. Though I didn't do as I liked before
I was of age." He spoke with rather timid discontent.

"Are you quite sure that's the sum, father?" said Tom. "I wish you would take the trouble to
fetch the tin box down. I think you have perhaps made a mistake."

"How should I make a mistake?" said his father, sharply. "I've counted it often enough; but
I can fetch it, if you won't believe me."

It was always an incident Mr. Tulliver liked, in his gloomy life, to fetch the tin box and
count the money.

"Don't go out of the room, mother," said Tom, as he saw her moving when his father was gone
upstairs.

"And isn't Maggie to go?" said Mrs. Tulliver; "because somebody must take away the things."

"Just as she likes," said Tom indifferently.

That was a cutting word to Maggie. Her heart had leaped with the sudden conviction that Tom
was going to tell their father the debts could be paid; and Tom would have let her be absent
when that news was told! But she carried away the tray and came back immediately. The feeling
of injury on her own behalf could not predominate at that moment.

Tom drew to the corner of the table near his father when the tin box was set down and opened,
and the red evening light falling on them made conspicuous the worn, sour gloom of the dark-eyed
father and the suppressed joy in the face of the fair-complexioned son. The mother and Maggie
sat at the other end of the table, the one in blank patience, the other in palpitating expectation.

Mr. Tulliver counted out the money, setting it in order on the table, and then said, glancing
sharply at Tom:

"There now! you see I was right enough."

He paused, looking at the money with bitter despondency.

"There's more nor three hundred wanting; it'll be a fine while before I can save that. Losing
that forty-two pound wi' the corn was a sore job. This world's been too many for me. It's took
four year to lay this by; it's much if I'm above ground for another four year. I must trusten
to you to pay 'em," he went on, with a trembling voice, "if you keep i' the same mind now you're
coming o' age. But you're like enough to bury me first."

He looked up in Tom's face with a querulous desire for some assurance.

"No, father," said Tom, speaking with energetic decision, though there was tremor discernible
in his voice too, "you will live to see the debts all paid. You shall pay them with your own hand."

His tone implied something more than mere hopefulness or resolution. A slight electric shock
seemed to pass through Mr. Tulliver, and he kept his eyes fixed on Tom with a look of eager
inquiry, while Maggie, unable to restrain herself, rushed to her father's side and knelt down
by him. Tom was silent a little while before he went on.

"A good while ago, my uncle Glegg lent me a little money to trade with, and that has answered.
I have three hundred and twenty pounds in the bank."

His mother's arms were round his neck as soon as the last words were uttered, and she said,
half crying:

"Oh, my boy, I knew you'd make iverything right again, when you got a man."

But his father was silent; the flood of emotion hemmed in all power of speech. Both Tom and
Maggie were struck with fear lest the shock of joy might even be fatal. But the blessed relief
of tears came. The broad chest heaved, the muscles of the face gave way, and the gray-haired
man burst into loud sobs. The fit of weeping gradually subsided, and he sat quiet, recovering
the regularity of his breathing. At last he looked up at his wife and said, in a gentle tone:

"Bessy, you must come and kiss me now--the lad has made you amends. You'll see a bit o' comfort
again, belike."

When she had kissed him, and he had held her hand a minute, his thoughts went back to the money.

"I wish you'd brought me the money to look at, Tom," he said, fingering the sovereigns on the
table; "I should ha' felt surer."

"You shall see it to-morrow, father," said Tom. "My uncle Deane has appointed the creditors
to meet to-morrow at the Golden Lion, and he has ordered a dinner for them at two o'clock.
My uncle Glegg and he will both be there. It was advertised in the 'Messenger' on Saturday."

"Then Wakem knows on't!" said Mr. Tulliver, his eye kindling with triumphant fire. "Ah!" he
went on, with a long-drawn guttural enunciation, taking out his snuff-box, the only luxury
he had left himself, and tapping it with something of his old air of defiance. "I'll get from
under his thumb now, though I must leave the old mill. I thought I could ha' held out to die
here--but I can't----we've got a glass o' nothing in the house, have we, Bessy?"

"Yes," said Mrs. Tulliver, drawing out her much-reduced bunch of keys, "there's some brandy
sister Deane brought me when I was ill."

"Get it me, then; get it me. I feel a bit weak."

"Tom, my lad," he said, in a stronger voice, when he had taken some brandy-and-water, "you
shall make a speech to 'em. I'll tell 'em it's you as got the best part o' the money. They'll
see I'm honest at last, and ha' got an honest son. Ah! Wakem 'ud be fine and glad to have a
son like mine,--a fine straight fellow,--i'stead o' that poor crooked creatur! You'll prosper
i' the world, my lad; you'll maybe see the day when Wakem and his son 'ull be a round or two
below you. You'll like enough be ta'en into partnership, as your uncle Deane was before you,--you're
in the right way for't; and then there's nothing to hinder your getting rich. And if ever you're
rich enough--mind this--try and get th' old mill again."

Mr. Tulliver threw himself back in his chair; his mind, which had so long been the home of
nothing but bitter discontent and foreboding, suddenly filled, by the magic of joy, with visions
of good fortune. But some subtle influence prevented him from foreseeing the good fortune as
happening to himself.

"Shake hands wi' me, my lad," he said, suddenly putting out his hand. "It's a great thing when
a man can be proud as he's got a good son. I've had that luck."

Tom never lived to taste another moment so delicious as that; and Maggie couldn't help forgetting
her own grievances. Tom was good; and in the sweet humility that springs in us all in moments
of true admiration and gratitude, she felt that the faults he had to pardon in her had never
been redeemed, as his faults were. She felt no jealousy this evening that, for the first time,
she seemed to be thrown into the background in her father's mind.

There was much more talk before bedtime. Mr. Tulliver naturally wanted to hear all the particulars
of Tom's trading adventures, and he listened with growing excitement and delight. He was curious
to know what had been said on every occasion; if possible, what had been thought; and Bob Jakin's
part in the business threw him into peculiar outbursts of sympathy with the triumphant knowingness
of that remarkable packman. Bob's juvenile history, so far as it had come under Mr. Tulliver's
knowledge, was recalled with that sense of astonishing promise it displayed, which is observable
in all reminiscences of the childhood of great men.

It was well that there was this interest of narrative to keep under the vague but fierce sense
of triumph over Wakem, which would otherwise have been the channel his joy would have rushed
into with dangerous force. Even as it was, that feeling from time to time gave threats of its
ultimate mastery, in sudden bursts of irrelevant exclamation.

It was long before Mr. Tulliver got to sleep that night; and the sleep, when it came, was filled
with vivid dreams. At half-past five o'clock in the morning, when Mrs. Tulliver was already
rising, he alarmed her by starting up with a sort of smothered shout, and looking round in
a bewildered way at the walls of the bedroom.

"What's the matter, Mr. Tulliver?" said his wife. He looked at her, still with a puzzled expression,
and said at last:

"Ah!--I was dreaming--did I make a noise?--I thought I'd got hold of him."

Chapter VII

A Day of Reckoning

Mr. Tulliver was an essentially sober man,--able to take his glass and not averse to it, but
never exceeding the bounds of moderation. The Paternoster ruby!

Those three words were an illumination; memory was flooded; and I glowed with a satisfaction that,
in accordance with my custom in such matters, I had collected and preserved every available
scrap of information which had in any way to do with this same Paternoster ruby. And right here
some of that data must be presented.

First of all, this magnificent gem's known history hinted at no religious association whatever, as its
name might seem to imply. In more than one journal I have seen it seriously affirmed that
at one time it was a property of that celebrated pope, Alexander VI, Rodrigo Borgia, father
of Caesar and Lucrezia--thus investing it with an antiquity and romance which the facts did not warrant.

But,
after all, am I not premature in making this last assertion? Perhaps it will appear before we
are through.

The gem first became known to the world and acquired its name through one Luca Paternostro, an
Italian dealer in precious stones having his place of business in London, who claimed to have
purchased it in the rough from some adventurer whose name is unknown to history. This occurred
in the early '80's.

Subsequently it was carefully cut in Amsterdam, a paste replica made for purposes of display
in the course of trade, and then added to Paternostro's stock--perhaps not because he expected
to dispose of it to the first chance customer, but rather by reason of the prestige which the
ownership of so superb a jewel would give him; it was an excellent advertisement.

On the fourth night after he received the cut ruby from the Dutch
lapidaries, Paternostro was murdered and the gem stolen from his apartments
in Hatton Gardens.

Of course, a stone so celebrated was easy to identify; not alone by means of the paste replica and
an accurate preserved description, but its extraordinary and distinguishing features--to say
nothing of its value--were not likely to be forgotten by experts who had seen and handled it.

And
so, when it appeared in Paris a few months later, Paternostro's heirs
and successors in the gem-importing business were promptly on hand
to claim their property; an enterprise in which they succeeded after
the determination of some legal complications; and the Paternostros
started with the ruby on the return to London.

Incidentally, the assassin and thief--an Oriental of undetermined nationality--was also apprehended
and, the red-tape of extradition having been gravely untangled, conveyed to England and duly hanged.

Ill-luck,
however, followed the ruby. On the boat over from Calais to Dover a confidential employee of
the gem merchants, who had accompanied them to Paris, was lost overboard while the vessel was
entering the home port. Although this man was known to be an expert swimmer--notwithstanding
the attempts at rescue, the proximity of land and the numerous craft
of all sorts in the vicinity--a strange fatality seems to have carried
him straight to the bottom.

After the man vanished beneath the waves, no sign of him was seen again.

In the following year no less than four attempts were made to steal
the stone from the Paternostros; but as they had learned caution from
their unfortunate predecessor's death--to the extent, at least, of
keeping such treasure in bank--these attempts were abortive.

Later several tentative overtures on the part of one of Europe's richest
monarchs toward the purchase of the Paternoster ruby came to naught;
the price set upon it by the Paternostros was prohibitive; and gradually
it came to be forgotten by the public, until the year '84, when interest
concerning it was again revived, this time to fever heat.

And now we have Alfred Fluette and Felix Page arrayed against each other once more. Everybody,
of course, still remembers the sudden rivalry between these two American
citizens, which sprang up in June of that year, for the gem's possession.

The complexity of causes which simultaneously inspired them with an inordinate desire for the
Paternoster ruby--a desire which seemingly could be appeased only
by possession, regardless of cost--was much of a mystery, and afforded
the energetic correspondents a fruitful text for many a day.

Both, as is well known, had unlimited means with which to indulge their sudden whim; where
kings and princes resigned themselves to the melancholy fact that
the gem was not for them, these two men battled for it with an unlicensed
tendering of fortunes that amazed the world; and one may easily imagine
the sleepless anxiety of the Paternostros, as first one and then the
other of the millionaires ran up his bid with true American prodigality.

Only--and

this the mystifying feature of the episode--Felix Page could never honestly be accused of prodigality
in any circumstances.

He secured the ruby--at a fabulous price; but in the operation he
made at least one bitter, implacable enemy.

Alfred Fluette returned to the United States, smarting with the stings of defeat, and pledged
to a commercial warfare on the successful millionaire speculator. It waged merrily thenceforward.

Why
did Felix Page want the Paternoster ruby? It was impossible even to surmise a tenable theory.
His parsimony was notorious; he was a bachelor without known kith or kin, and had never before
been known to evince the slightest interest in precious stones.

On the other hand, Mr. Fluette was not only a collector of gems, but his collection was and still
is one of the most famous in the world. Perhaps Page was willing to sacrifice a fortune merely
to thwart a rival's ambition; perhaps he was only satisfying some old grudge about which the
world knew nothing--it was all speculation, and speculation of a most unsatisfying sort, too.
He got the stone, at any rate; and here we have another instance
of the man's peculiar disposition.

Whatever he did with the ruby nobody knew. There were many connoisseurs and jewelers on this side
of the water who were naturally curious to see a gem of such renown; but with characteristic
selfishness the new owner refused one and all, not only a glimpse
of his costly prize, but would not even impart any information about
it.

His was a dog-in-the-manger attitude; with no appreciation whatever
of his possession, he refused bluntly to allow anybody else to enjoy
it.

The ruby was kept hid away.

Such, briefly, were the data I had neatly pasted in my scrapbook and which memory had been all the
morning trying to recall.

I paused in my promenade to survey Burke: what new adjustment must be made of the bare facts so
far gathered; what now, in view of this new element injected into
the case, was the attitude of this strange being toward it--my regard
shifted to Maillot--and his?

Just at this juncture my cogitations were broken in upon by the door being unceremoniously thrown
open. Stodger, much excited, darted in, closing the door after him. He handed me an envelope,
accompanying it with a look of suppressed eagerness which suggested certain details pertinent to the
missive which were being reserved--with difficulty--for my private
hearing.

"Note for Maillot," announced he, his eyes fixed curiously upon the
young man.

Maillot, apparently dumfounded, rose slowly to his feet.

"A note--for me!" he faltered. Then, quietly: "Give it to me, Swift."

Our glances met--and stayed. I had the envelope before me pinned to the table with the outspread
fingers of my right hand. Maillot was unmistakably in great distress of mind, and his expression
was that of a man desperate but determined. Only for a moment I hesitated; then without raising
my hand, I slid the envelope across the table to him.

"It's a question of confidence, Mr. Maillot," said I, calmly, endeavoring to convey my earnestness
in the look which had not for an instant swayed from his. "I reserve the right, should the occasion
arise, to read it; understand?"

With a curt nod of acquiescence, he snatched it up from the table. A glimpse of the handwriting brought
a flush to his face and a glad sparkle to his eyes; but the missive troubled him. It was short,
and as he slowly returned it to its envelope his hand shook and his countenance grew more and
more harassed and perplexed.

I glanced at Burke's pallid features and found them as impassive as any Indian's. It was impossible
to determine whether he was watching me or Maillot.

Evidently assuming the incident to be closed, Stodger saw his opportunity
to speak again.

"Chap's out here that brought it," said he; "coachman, he looks like;
waiting for an answer."

Then he turned to me, continuing:

"Four reporters out there, too; what shall I do with 'em?"

Maillot suddenly startled us by smiting the table violently with his fist. He was white, trembling,
and apprehensive; but his determination was by no means broken.

"Swift," said he, in a hushed, strained voice, "step aside with me; let me have a word with you."

He
seized my arm, and fairly dragged me off toward the curtained alcove.

"Swift," he whispered, not releasing his grip on my arm, "I 'm in a devil of a position. For
God's sake, show some sign of humanity!

That note was from a young lady--"

"I surmised as much."

"Damn it, man! Don't laugh! I'm more dead in earnest than I ever was before in my life. This means
more to me--to her--than you can by any possibility conceive, astute officer of the law though
you may be."

My expression must have contained something of surprise at his vehemence, for with an effort
he abruptly checked himself and at once went on more calmly.

"Swift, it's the young lady I expect some day to marry; she 's heard a rumor of the tragedy,
and is worried about me. The note was brought by her coachman, and she 's waiting on the corner
a block from here for me to come to her."

I tried hard to consider what was best to do. Enter a woman into a
case like this, and assured conduct becomes an impossibility.

Maillot was searching my face eagerly; in a moment he laid more of the matter before me.

"She 's a sensitive, high-strung girl whom the slightest breath of
scandal would fairly kill.

I can't let her name be dragged into this mess; I can't answer her
note, and send the reply away from under your very nose without a
word to you.

And the reporters! Gracious heavens! Swift, Stodger wanted to know what to do with 'em: for
pity's sake, tell him to kill 'em!"

Again I interrupted. I trust that I may in all modesty record that I have more than a spark
of the feelings to which the young fellow made such a passionate
appeal.

"Look here, Maillot, has the young lady a companion?"

"Yes--usually; a young lady cousin who lives with her."

"Very well. If they happen to be together now, we can settle the matter quite easily. Answer
her note; request the two of them to come here in a half-hour.

Within that time we can get rid of the reporters, and you can--well, you can collect yourself.
If your present expression is an index to what you are likely to
say, this will be no place for a young lady--for the next thirty minutes,
anyhow."

He caught and wrung my hand.

"Swift, you 're a damn good fellow!" he said impulsively, and hurried back to his seat.

However, I did not forget that I had not heard this young man's story; nor did I fail to consider
that he was a lawyer, and hence possessed of advantages for appreciating and intelligently weighing
all the chances for and against his sweetheart becoming involved.

As Maillot dropped into his chair, Stodger could no longer contain himself. Drawing me into the
hall, though the door was left wide open, he said, in a whisper that was heavy with importance:

"You
'd never guess whose coachman it was."

I made no attempt to, and my stout friend impressively announced:

"Fluette's."

"What!" Surprise jerked the exclamation from me; but I kept my voice subdued.

"Fact,"--Stodger nodded his round head impressively,--"Alfred Fluette."

Here indeed was the promise of a pretty state of affairs!

CHAPTER V

THE HIDDEN SAFE

I left the four reporters to Stodger's tender mercies--his instructions did not include any such
extreme measures as Maillot had suggested--confident that he was the proper person to relieve me
of this unwelcome intrusion. It has always been hard for me to talk to these sharp-eyed, alert
young chaps of the press, without saying something I had no business to say. Even if I did n't say
it, some one of them would be sure to make a pretty shrewd guess,
sometimes causing me no end of trouble.

Stodger knew nothing of my intentions; therefore he could let nothing
slip that might in any way affect my future movements.

Maillot's note despatched, I directed my attention to ascertaining
just what Alexander Burke meant by his reference to the ruby.

His explanation in itself was simple enough. He had heard of the ruby, of course--who had n't?--and
during his wanderings through the house the previous night, while
he waited for Maillot to finish his business with Mr. Page, he had
paused now and then in the vicinity of the library door.

Twice he had heard the gem mentioned by those within.

Maillot accepted this statement with an offensive incredulity which
was plainly deliberate.

"The house was very quiet," Burke made haste to add.

"Perhaps," Maillot spoke with sneering emphasis, his look frankly
hostile, "perhaps you could have heard us; I 'm ignorant of the degree
of acuteness to which your hearing has been developed; but"--turning
to me--"I want to say, Swift, that during the whole time Mr. Page
and I were engaged in this room, our voices were not once raised so
that a person beyond the closed door could have heard us intelligibly.

I think, Burke, I see the imprint of a keyhole on your ear."

"Temper your language, Maillot," said the other, with a touch of asperity. Instantly Maillot
was upon his feet.

"Shut up!" he thundered.

"Don't you talk to me, you scamp!"

"Here, don't quarrel," I interposed pacifically, pressing the angry, glaring lawyer back into
his chair with a persuasive hand upon his shoulder.

I then said to him:

"You might appropriately relate what your business last night with Mr. Page was."

"I will"--bluntly--"to you."

The proposal being a reasonable one, I agreed to defer the matter.

"However," continued I, "while you two are together there are some points upon which I want
enlightenment. Reserve your personalities for another time. Is it positive that there was no
one else in the house besides yourselves and Mr. Page?"

Neither spoke, each waiting, as it seemed, for the other to reply. My glance travelled between
the two, and finally settled upon the secretary, whose long, nervous fingers were beating a
silent tattoo upon the table.

"How about it, Mr. Burke?" I pressed him. "Your familiarity with the house entitles you to answer."

"I
can take oath there was not," he now said. Stodger had already assured me that when he arrived
every door and window was fast on the inside. So I next asked:
"When you went to notify the police, did you depart by way of the
front door?"

"I did," he replied in a subdued voice. And Maillot
immediately added:

"It was fast, Swift--bolt and spring-latch, both.
I remember because the fact made me think there might be somebody
else in the house. As soon as Burke left I went over the whole place,
methodically and painstakingly, and I can now swear, if anybody was
secreted in here anywhere, why, he 's here yet. I inspected every
door and window, upstairs and down; all were fast."

The unbroken,
spotless mantle of snow outside limited the possibility of ingress
or egress without leaving betraying footprints, to either the front
or the rear door, where the paths had been kept clear.

Dismissing
this nonplussing phase, I turned to the subject of the gem once more.

"Regarding
the ruby, Mr. Burke," said I, "do you know where Mr. Page kept it?"

Maillot
fixed a scowling look--not at all relieved by his discolored eye--upon
the secretary, while that young man thoughtfully shook his head.

"No,"
Burke said at length; "not certainly. I never heard Mr. Page mention
it; but I have an idea that it is in a small concealed safe in his
bedroom, because there is where he keeps those things which no eye
but his own ever sees."

Was it possible that Felix Page had any hidden
treasures of sentiment? If so, here, in all truth, was a surprising
side-light thrown into an unsuspected recess of his character. I was
to have a hint presently of what was tucked away there.

But Burke
had something more to say. "Perhaps,"--slowly--"you would like to
see that safe, Mr. Swift. I know where it is located, and can save
you a needless search. It will have to be opened later on, I imagine."

"All
right," I said, with much interest. "Lead the way."

Burke rose, with
a queer glance at Maillot, and--turned toward the curtained alcove.

If
he had any intention of moving in that direction, however, he quickly
changed his mind; for Maillot and I followed him through the doorway,
down the length of the roomy panelled hall, to another door on the
same side of the house as the one we had just quitted. I could hear
a murmur of voices across the hall, where Stodger was entertaining
the reporters.

"The safe," said Burke, as we entered a large, handsome,
but very disordered sleeping-chamber, "is what decided Mr. Page on
selecting this room in preference to one on the second floor. It was
placed here, I suppose, at the time the house was built; it is very
artfully hidden."

The bed betrayed the fact that it had not been
slept in recently, and the room that it was unused to a cleansing
supervision. Some soiled clothing lay in a heap in one corner; a pair
of trousers were collapsed over the back of a chair; the dresser-top
held a lot of linen and cravats, both clean and soiled; half-closed
drawers overflowed with garments that had been thrust in any way,
and an over-turned ink bottle on a handsome mahogany stand had never
been righted. Even a careless housewife would have been driven insane
by such deliberate untidiness.

Our guide picked up a half-burned
candle, lighted it, and then opened a closet door. Next instant he
started back with a queer cry.

Maillot and I crowded forward and
saw--nothing, at first, to explain Burke's conduct. But in a moment
I comprehended.

A section of the closet floor was up, and now stood
on edge leaning against a wall; beneath it was a shallow, cemented
hollow, with four wooden steps leading down to the bottom, where,
obviously, one might stand to get conveniently at the small safe thus
disclosed.

It was also manifest that somebody had been doing that
very thing. For the safe door stood open, as well as the inner door;
and a flash of the candle, a single brief glimpse, assured me that--whatever
it might have held--it was now as empty as on the day it left the
maker's hands. But Tom and Maggie must naturally feel it very painful
to be reminded of these things. They have had so much, so very much trouble. Maggie was at
school with me six years ago, when she was fetched away because of her father's misfortunes,
and she has hardly had any pleasure since, I think. She has been in a dreary situation in a
school since uncle's death, because she is determined to be independent, and not live with
aunt Pullet; and I could hardly wish her to come to me then, because dear mamma was ill, and
everything was so sad. That is why I want her to come to me now, and have a long, long holiday."

"Very sweet and angelic of you," said Stephen, looking at her with an admiring smile; "and
all the more so if she has the conversational qualities of her mother."

"Poor aunty! You are cruel to ridicule her. She is very valuable to me, I know. She manages
the house beautifully,--much better than any stranger would,--and she was a great comfort to
me in mamma's illness."

"Yes, but in point of companionship one would prefer that she should be represented by her
brandy-cherries and cream-cakes. I think with a shudder that her daughter will always be present
in person, and have no agreeable proxies of that kind,--a fat, blond girl, with round blue
eyes, who will stare at us silently."

"Oh yes!" exclaimed Lucy, laughing wickedly, and clapping her hands, "that is just my cousin
Maggie. You must have seen her!"

"No, indeed; I'm only guessing what Mrs. Tulliver's daughter must be; and then if she is to
banish Philip, our only apology for a tenor, that will be an additional bore."

"But I hope that may not be. I think I will ask you to call on Philip and tell him Maggie is
coming to-morrow. He is quite aware of Tom's feeling, and always keeps out of his way; so he
will understand, if you tell him, that I asked you to warn him not to come until I write to
ask him."

"I think you had better write a pretty note for me to take; Phil is so sensitive, you know,
the least thing might frighten him off coming at all, and we had hard work to get him. I can
never induce him to come to the park; he doesn't like my sisters, I think. It is only your
faëry touch that can lay his ruffled feathers."

Stephen mastered the little hand that was straying toward the table, and touched it lightly
with his lips. Little Lucy felt very proud and happy. She and Stephen were in that stage of
courtship which makes the most exquisite moment of youth, the freshest blossom-time of passion,--when
each is sure of the other's love, but no formal declaration has been made, and all is mutual
divination, exalting the most trivial word, the lightest gesture, into thrills delicate and
delicious as wafted jasmine scent. The explicitness of an engagement wears off this finest
edge of susceptibility; it is jasmine gathered and presented in a large bouquet.

"But it is really odd that you should have hit so exactly on Maggie's appearance and manners,"
said the cunning Lucy, moving to reach her desk, "because she might have been like her brother,
you know; and Tom has not round eyes; and he is as far as possible from staring at people."

"Oh, I suppose he is like the father; he seems to be as proud as Lucifer. Not a brilliant companion,
though, I should think."

"I like Tom. He gave me my Minny when I lost Lolo; and papa is very fond of him: he says Tom
has excellent principles. It was through him that his father was able to pay all his debts
before he died."

"Oh, ah; I've heard about that. I heard your father and mine talking about it a little while
ago, after dinner, in one of their interminable discussions about business. They think of doing
something for young Tulliver; he saved them from a considerable loss by riding home in some
marvellous way, like Turpin, to bring them news about the stoppage of a bank, or something
of that sort. But I was rather drowsy at the time."

Stephen rose from his seat, and sauntered to the piano, humming in falsetto, "Graceful Consort,"
as he turned over the volume of "The Creation," which stood open on the desk.

"Come and sing this," he said, when he saw Lucy rising.

"What, 'Graceful Consort'? I don't think it suits your voice."

"Never mind; it exactly suits my feeling, which, Philip will have it, is the grand element
of good singing. I notice men with indifferent voices are usually of that opinion."

"Philip burst into one of his invectives against 'The Creation' the other day," said Lucy,
seating herself at the piano. "He says it has a sort of sugared complacency and flattering
make-believe in it, as if it were written for the birthday fête of a German Grand-Duke."

"Oh, pooh! He is the fallen Adam with a soured temper. We are Adam and Eve unfallen, in Paradise.
Now, then,--the recitative, for the sake of the moral. You will sing the whole duty of woman,--'And
from obedience grows my pride and happiness.'"

"Oh no, I shall not respect an Adam who drags the tempo, as you will," said Lucy, beginning
to play the duet.

Surely the only courtship unshaken by doubts and fears must be that in which the lovers can
sing together. The sense of mutual fitness that springs from the two deep notes fulfilling
expectation just at the right moment between the notes of the silvery soprano, from the perfect
accord of descending thirds and fifths, from the preconcerted loving chase of a fugue, is likely
enough to supersede any immediate demand for less impassioned forms of agreement. The contralto
will not care to catechise the bass; the tenor will foresee no embarrassing dearth of remark
in evenings spent with the lovely soprano. In the provinces, too, where music was so scarce
in that remote time, how could the musical people avoid falling in love with each other? Even
political principle must have been in danger of relaxation under such circumstances; and the
violin, faithful to rotten boroughs, must have been tempted to fraternize in a demoralizing
way with a reforming violoncello. In that case, the linnet-throated soprano and the full-toned
bass singing,--

  "With thee delight is ever new,
  With thee is life incessant bliss,"

believed what they sang all the more because they sang it.

"Now for Raphael's great song," said Lucy, when they had finished the duet. "You do the 'heavy
beasts' to perfection."

"That sounds complimentary," said Stephen, looking at his watch. "By Jove, it's nearly half-past
one! Well, I can just sing this."

Stephen delivered with admirable ease the deep notes representing the tread of the heavy beasts;
but when a singer has an audience of two, there is room for divided sentiments. Minny's mistress
was charmed; but Minny, who had intrenched himself, trembling, in his basket as soon as the
music began, found this thunder so little to his taste that he leaped out and scampered under
the remotest chiffonnier, as the most eligible place in which a small dog could await the crack
of doom.

"Adieu, 'graceful consort,'" said Stephen, buttoning his coat across when he had done singing,
and smiling down from his tall height, with the air of rather a patronizing lover, at the little
lady on the music-stool. "My bliss is not incessant, for I must gallop home. I promised to
be there at lunch."

"You will not be able to call on Philip, then? It is of no consequence; I have said everything
in my note."

"You will be engaged with your cousin to-morrow, I suppose?"

"Yes, we are going to have a little family-party. My cousin Tom will dine with us; and poor
aunty will have her two children together for the first time. It will be very pretty; I think
a great deal about it."

"But I may come the next day?"

"Oh yes! Come and be introduced to my cousin Maggie; though you can hardly be said not to have
seen her, you have described her so well."

"Good-bye, then." And there was that slight pressure of the hands, and momentary meeting of
the eyes, which will often leave a little lady with a slight flush and smile on her face that
do not subside immediately when the door is closed, and with an inclination to walk up and
down the room rather than to seat herself quietly at her embroidery, or other rational and
improving occupation. At least this was the effect on Lucy; and you will not, I hope, consider
it an indication of vanity predominating over more tender impulses, that she just glanced in
the chimney-glass as her walk brought her near it. The desire to know that one has not looked
an absolute fright during a few hours of conversation may be construed as lying within the
bounds of a laudable benevolent consideration for others. And Lucy had so much of this benevolence
in her nature that I am inclined to think her small egoisms were impregnated with it, just
as there are people not altogether unknown to you whose small benevolences have a predominant
and somewhat rank odor of egoism. The hum of the city made a blurred wash of sound, like the varying yet
steady wash of the sea. As she opened her eyes again, she saw that the twilight had perceptibly
deepened. Far away, lights began to flash out in the city, as if a million fireflies, by twos
and threes and dozens, were waking to their nocturnal revelry.

On the hill the light was still good, and the lady turned again to her reading. The other letter
was written on single sheets of thin paper in an old-fashioned, beautiful hand. Wherever a double-s
occurred, the first was written long, in the style of sixty years ago; and the whole letter was
as easily legible as print. Across the top was written: "To Agatha Redmond, daughter of my ward
and dear friend, Agatha Shaw Redmond"; and below that, in the lawyer's choppy handwriting,
was a date of nearly a year previous. As Agatha Redmond read the second letter, a smile, half of
sadness, half of pleasure, overspread her countenance. It ran as follows:

"ILION, MAINE.

"MY DEAR AGATHA:

"I take my pen in hand to address you, the daughter of the dearest friend of my life, for the first
time in the twenty-odd years of your existence.

Once as a child you saw me, and you have doubtless heard my name from your mother's people
from time to time; but I can scarcely hope that any knowledge of my private life has come to
you. It will be easy, then, for you to pardon an old man for giving you, in this fashion, the
confidence he has never been able to bestow in the flesh.
"When you read this epistle, my dear Agatha, I shall have stepped
into that next mystery, which is Death. Indeed, the duty which I am
now discharging serves as partial preparation for that very event.
This duty is to make you heir to my house and estate and to certain
accessory funds which will enable you to keep up the place.

"You
may regard this act, possibly, as the idiosyncrasy of an unbalanced
mind; it is certain that some of my kinsfolk will do so. But while
I have been able to bear up under their greater or less displeasure
for many years, I find myself shrinking before the possibility of
dying absolutely unknown and forgotten by you. Your mother, Agatha
Shaw, of blessed memory now for many years, was my ward and pupil
after the death of your grandfather.

Was not Stephen Guest right in his decided opinion that this slim maiden of eighteen was quite
the sort of wife a man would not be likely to repent of marrying,--a woman who was loving and
thoughtful for other women, not giving them Judas-kisses with eyes askance on their welcome
defects, but with real care and vision for their half-hidden pains and mortifications, with
long ruminating enjoyment of little pleasures prepared for them? Perhaps the emphasis of his
admiration did not fall precisely on this rarest quality in her; perhaps he approved his own
choice of her chiefly because she did not strike him as a remarkable rarity. A man likes his
wife to be pretty; well, Lucy was pretty, but not to a maddening extent. A man likes his wife
to be accomplished, gentle, affectionate, and not stupid; and Lucy had all these qualifications.
Stephen was not surprised to find himself in love with her, and was conscious of excellent
judgment in preferring her to Miss Leyburn, the daughter of the county member, although Lucy
was only the daughter of his father's subordinate partner; besides, he had had to defy and
overcome a slight unwillingness and disappointment in his father and sisters,--a circumstance
which gives a young man an agreeable consciousness of his own dignity. Stephen was aware that
he had sense and independence enough to choose the wife who was likely to make him happy, unbiassed
by any indirect considerations. He meant to choose Lucy; she was a little darling, and exactly
the sort of woman he had always admired.

Chapter II

First Impressions

"He is very clever, Maggie," said Lucy. She was kneeling on a footstool at Maggie's feet, after
placing that dark lady in the large crimson-velvet chair. "I feel sure you will like him. I
hope you will."

"I shall be very difficult to please," said Maggie, smiling, and holding up one of Lucy's long
curls, that the sunlight might shine through it. "A gentleman who thinks he is good enough
for Lucy must expect to be sharply criticised."

"Indeed, he's a great deal too good for me. And sometimes, when he is away, I almost think
it can't really be that he loves me. But I can never doubt it when he is with me, though I
couldn't bear any one but you to know that I feel in that way, Maggie."

"Oh, then, if I disapprove of him you can give him up, since you are not engaged," said Maggie,
with playful gravity.

"I would rather not be engaged. When people are engaged, they begin to think of being married
soon," said Lucy, too thoroughly preoccupied to notice Maggie's joke; "and I should like everything
to go on for a long while just as it is. Sometimes I am quite frightened lest Stephen should
say that he has spoken to papa; and from something that fell from papa the other day, I feel
sure he and Mr. Guest are expecting that. And Stephen's sisters are very civil to me now. At
first, I think they didn't like his paying me attention; and that was natural. It does seem
out of keeping that I should ever live in a great place like the Park House, such a little
insignificant thing as I am."

"But people are not expected to be large in proportion to the houses they live in, like snails,"
said Maggie, laughing. "Pray, are Mr. Guest's sisters giantesses?"

"Oh no; and not handsome,--that is, not very," said Lucy, half-penitent at this uncharitable
remark. "But he is--at least he is generally considered very handsome."

"Though you are unable to share that opinion?"

"Oh, I don't know," said Lucy, blushing pink over brow and neck. "It is a bad plan to raise
expectation; you will perhaps be disappointed. But I have prepared a charming surprise for
him; I shall have a glorious laugh against him. I shall not tell you what it is, though."

Lucy rose from her knees and went to a little distance, holding her pretty head on one side,
as if she had been arranging Maggie for a portrait, and wished to judge of the general effect.

"Stand up a moment, Maggie."

"What is your pleasure now?" said Maggie, smiling languidly as she rose from her chair and
looked down on her slight, aerial cousin, whose figure was quite subordinate to her faultless
drapery of silk and crape.

Lucy kept her contemplative attitude a moment or two in silence, and then said,--

"I can't think what witchery it is in you, Maggie, that makes you look best in shabby clothes;
though you really must have a new dress now. But do you know, last night I was trying to fancy
you in a handsome, fashionable dress, and do what I would, that old limp merino would come
back as the only right thing for you. I wonder if Marie Antoinette looked all the grander when
her gown was darned at the elbows. Now, if I were to put anything shabby on, I should be quite
unnoticeable. I should be a mere rag."

"Oh, quite," said Maggie, with mock gravity. "You would be liable to be swept out of the room
with the cobwebs and carpet-dust, and to find yourself under the grate, like Cinderella. Mayn't
I sit down now?"

"Yes, now you may," said Lucy, laughing. Then, with an air of serious reflection, unfastening
her large jet brooch, "But you must change brooches, Maggie; that little butterfly looks silly
on you."

"But won't that mar the charming effect of my consistent shabbiness?" said Maggie, seating
herself submissively, while Lucy knelt again and unfastened the contemptible butterfly. "I
wish my mother were of your opinion, for she was fretting last night because this is my best
frock. I've been saving my money to pay for some lessons; I shall never get a better situation
without more accomplishments."

Maggie gave a little sigh.

"Now, don't put on that sad look again," said Lucy, pinning the large brooch below Maggie's
fine throat. "You're forgetting that you've left that dreary schoolroom behind you, and have
no little girls' clothes to mend."

"Yes," said Maggie. "It is with me as I used to think it would be with the poor uneasy white
bear I saw at the show. I thought he must have got so stupid with the habit of turning backward
and forward in that narrow space that he would keep doing it if they set him free. One gets
a bad habit of being unhappy."

"But I shall put you under a discipline of pleasure that will make you lose that bad habit,"
said Lucy, sticking the black butterfly absently in her own collar, while her eyes met Maggie's
affectionately.

"You dear, tiny thing," said Maggie, in one of her bursts of loving admiration, "you enjoy
other people's happiness so much, I believe you would do without any of your own. I wish I
were like you."

"I've never been tried in that way," said Lucy. "I've always been so happy. I don't know whether
I could bear much trouble; I never had any but poor mamma's death. You have been tried, Maggie;
and I'm sure you feel for other people quite as much as I do."

"No, Lucy," said Maggie, shaking her head slowly, "I don't enjoy their happiness as you do,
else I should be more contented. I do feel for them when they are in trouble; I don't think
I could ever bear to make any one unhappy; and yet I often hate myself, because I get angry
sometimes at the sight of happy people. I think I get worse as I get older, more selfish. That
seems very dreadful."

"Now, Maggie!" said Lucy, in a tone of remonstrance, "I don't believe a word of that. It is
all a gloomy fancy, just because you are depressed by a dull, wearisome life."

"Well, perhaps it is," said Maggie, resolutely clearing away the clouds from her face with
a bright smile, and throwing herself backward in her chair. "Perhaps it comes from the school
diet,--watery rice-pudding spiced with Pinnock. Let us hope it will give way before my mother's
custards and this charming Geoffrey Crayon."

Maggie took up the "Sketch Book," which lay by her on the table.

"Do I look fit to be seen with this little brooch?" said Lucy, going to survey the effect in
the chimney-glass.

"Oh no, Mr. Guest will be obliged to go out of the room again if he sees you in it. Pray make
haste and put another on."

Lucy hurried out of the room, but Maggie did not take the opportunity of opening her book;
she let it fall on her knees, while her eyes wandered to the window, where she could see the
sunshine falling on the rich clumps of spring flowers and on the long hedge of laurels, and
beyond, the silvery breadth of the dear old Floss, that at this distance seemed to be sleeping
in a morning holiday. The sweet fresh garden-scent came through the open window, and the birds
were busy flitting and alighting, gurgling and singing. Yet Maggie's eyes began to fill with
tears. The sight of the old scenes had made the rush of memories so painful that even yesterday
she had only been able to rejoice in her mother's restored comfort and Tom's brotherly friendliness
as we rejoice in good news of friends at a distance, rather than in the presence of a happiness
which we share. Memory and imagination urged upon her a sense of privation too keen to let
her taste what was offered in the transient present. Her future, she thought, was likely to
be worse than her past, for after her years of contented renunciation, she had slipped back
into desire and longing; she found joyless days of distasteful occupation harder and harder;
she found the image of the intense and varied life she yearned for, and despaired of, becoming
more and more importunate. The sound of the opening door roused her, and hastily wiping away
her tears, she began to turn over the leaves of her book.

"There is one pleasure, I know, Maggie, that your deepest dismalness will never resist," said
Lucy, beginning to speak as soon as she entered the room. "That is music, and I mean you to
have quite a riotous feast of it. I mean you to get up your playing again, which used to be
so much better than mine, when we were at Laceham."

"You would have laughed to see me playing the little girls' tunes over and over to them, when
I took them to practise," said Maggie, "just for the sake of fingering the dear keys again.
But I don't know whether I could play anything more difficult now than 'Begone, dull care!'"

"I know what a wild state of joy you used to be in when the glee-men came round," said Lucy,
taking up her embroidery; "and we might have all those old glees that you used to love so,
if I were certain that you don't feel exactly as Tom does about some things."

"I should have thought there was nothing you might be more certain of," said Maggie, smiling.

"I ought rather to have said, one particular thing. Because if you feel just as he does about
that, we shall want our third voice. St. Ogg's is so miserably provided with musical gentlemen.
There are really only Stephen and Philip Wakem who have any knowledge of music, so as to be
able to sing a part."

Lucy had looked up from her work as she uttered the last sentence, and saw that there was a
change in Maggie's face.

"Does it hurt you to hear the name mentioned, Maggie? If it does, I will not speak of him again.
I know Tom will not see him if he can avoid it."

"I don't feel at all as Tom does on that subject," said Maggie, rising and going to the window
as if she wanted to see more of the landscape. "I've always liked Philip Wakem ever since I
was a little girl, and saw him at Lorton. He was so good when Tom hurt his foot."

"Oh, I'm so glad!" said Lucy. "Then you won't mind his coming sometimes, and we can have much
more music than we could without him. I'm very fond of poor Philip, only I wish he were not
so morbid about his deformity. I suppose it is his deformity that makes him so sad, and sometimes
bitter. It is certainly very piteous to see his poor little crooked body and pale face among
great, strong people."

"But, Lucy----" said Maggie, trying to arrest the prattling stream.

"Ah, there is the door-bell. That must be Stephen," Lucy went on, not noticing Maggie's faint
effort to speak. "One of the things I most admire in Stephen is that he makes a greater friend
of Philip than any one."

It was too late for Maggie to speak now; the drawingroom door was opening, and Minny was already
growling in a small way at the entrance of a tall gentleman, who went up to Lucy and took her
hand with a half-polite, half-tender glance and tone of inquiry, which seemed to indicate that
he was unconscious of any other presence.

"Let me introduce you to my cousin, Miss Tulliver," said Lucy, turning with wicked enjoyment
toward Maggie, who now approached from the farther window. "This is Mr. Stephen Guest."

For one instant Stephen could not conceal his astonishment at the sight of this tall, dark-eyed
nymph with her jet-black coronet of hair; the next, Maggie felt herself, for the first time
in her life, receiving the tribute of a very deep blush and a very deep bow from a person toward
whom she herself was conscious of timidity.

This new experience was very agreeable to her, so agreeable that it almost effaced her previous
emotion about Philip. There was a new brightness in her eyes, and a very becoming flush on
her cheek, as she seated herself.

"I hope you perceive what a striking likeness you drew the day before yesterday," said Lucy,
with a pretty laugh of triumph. She enjoyed her lover's confusion; the advantage was usually
on his side.

"This designing cousin of yours quite deceived me, Miss Tulliver," said Stephen, seating himself
by Lucy, and stooping to play with Minny, only looking at Maggie furtively. "She said you had
light hair and blue eyes."

"Nay, it was you who said so," remonstrated Lucy. "I only refrained from destroying your confidence
in your own second-sight."

"I wish I could always err in the same way," said Stephen, "and find reality so much more beautiful
than my preconceptions."

"Now you have proved yourself equal to the occasion," said Maggie, "and said what it was incumbent
on you to say under the circumstances."

She flashed a slightly defiant look at him; it was clear to her that he had been drawing a
satirical portrait of her beforehand. Lucy had said he was inclined to be satirical, and Maggie
had mentally supplied the addition, "and rather conceited."

"An alarming amount of devil there," was Stephen's first thought. The second, when she had
bent over her work, was, "I wish she would look at me again." The next was to answer,--

"I suppose all phrases of mere compliment have their turn to be true. A man is occasionally
grateful when he says 'Thank you.' It's rather hard upon him that he must use the same words
with which all the world declines a disagreeable invitation, don't you think so, Miss Tulliver?"

"No," said Maggie, looking at him with her direct glance; "if we use common words on a great
occasion, they are the more striking, because they are felt at once to have a particular meaning,
like old banners, or every-day clothes, hung up in a sacred place."

"Then my compliment ought to be eloquent," said Stephen, really not quite knowing what he said
while Maggie looked at him, "seeing that the words were so far beneath the occasion."

"No compliment can be eloquent, except as an expression of indifference," said Maggie, flushing
a little.

Lucy was rather alarmed; she thought Stephen and Maggie were not going to like each other.
She had always feared lest Maggie should appear too old and clever to please that critical
gentleman. "Why, dear Maggie," she interposed, "you have always pretended that you are too
fond of being admired; and now, I think, you are angry because some one ventures to admire you."

"Not at all," said Maggie; "I like too well to feel that I am admired, but compliments never
make me feel that."

"I will never pay you a compliment again, Miss Tulliver," said Stephen.

"Thank you; that will be a proof of respect."

Poor Maggie! She was so unused to society that she could take nothing as a matter of course,
and had never in her life spoken from the lips merely, so that she must necessarily appear
absurd to more experienced ladies, from the excessive feeling she was apt to throw into very
trivial incidents. But she was even conscious herself of a little absurdity in this instance.
It was true she had a theoretic objection to compliments, and had once said impatiently to
Philip that she didn't see why women were to be told with a simper that they were beautiful,
any more than old men were to be told that they were venerable; still, to be so irritated by
a common practice in the case of a stranger like Mr. Stephen Guest, and to care about his having
spoken slightingly of her before he had seen her, was certainly unreasonable, and as soon as
she was silent she began to be ashamed of herself. It did not occur to her that her irritation
was due to the pleasanter emotion which preceded it, just as when we are satisfied with a sense
of glowing warmth an innocent drop of cold water may fall upon us as a sudden smart.

Stephen was too well bred not to seem unaware that the previous conversation could have been
felt embarrassing, and at once began to talk of impersonal matters, asking Lucy if she knew
when the bazaar was at length to take place, so that there might be some hope of seeing her
rain the influence of her eyes on objects more grateful than those worsted flowers that were
growing under her fingers.

"Some day next month, I believe," said Lucy. "But your sisters are doing more for it than I
am; they are to have the largest stall."

"Ah yes; but they carry on their manufactures in their own sitting-room, where I don't intrude
on them. I see you are not addicted to the fashionable vice of fancy-work, Miss Tulliver,"
said Stephen, looking at Maggie's plain hemming.

"No," said Maggie, "I can do nothing more difficult or more elegant than shirt-making."

"And your plain sewing is so beautiful, Maggie," said Lucy, "that I think I shall beg a few
specimens of you to show as fancy-work. Your exquisite sewing is quite a mystery to me, you
used to dislike that sort of work so much in old days."

"It is a mystery easily explained, dear," said Maggie, looking up quietly. "Plain sewing was
the only thing I could get money by, so I was obliged to try and do it well."

Lucy, good and simple as she was, could not help blushing a little. She did not quite like
that Stephen should know that; Maggie need not have mentioned it. Perhaps there was some pride
in the confession,-- the pride of poverty that will not be ashamed of itself. But if Maggie
had been the queen of coquettes she could hardly have invented a means of giving greater piquancy
to her beauty in Stephen's eyes; I am not sure that the quiet admission of plain sewing and
poverty would have done alone, but assisted by the beauty, they made Maggie more unlike other
women even than she had seemed at first.

"But I can knit, Lucy," Maggie went on, "if that will be of any use for your bazaar."

"Oh yes, of infinite use. I shall set you to work with scarlet wool to-morrow. But your sister
is the most enviable person," continued Lucy, turning to Stephen, "to have the talent of modelling.
She is doing a wonderful bust of Dr. Kenn entirely from memory."

"Why, if she can remember to put the eyes very near together, and the corners of the mouth
very far apart, the likeness can hardly fail to be striking in St. Ogg's."

"Now that is very wicked of you," said Lucy, looking rather hurt. "I didn't think you would
speak disrespectfully of Dr. Kenn."

"I say anything disrespectful of Dr. Kenn? Heaven forbid! But I am not bound to respect a libellous
bust of him. I think Kenn one of the finest fellows in the world. I don't care much about the
tall candlesticks he has put on the communion-table, and I shouldn't like to spoil my temper
by getting up to early prayers every morning. But he's the only man I ever knew personally
who seems to me to have anything of the real apostle in him,--a man who has eight hundred a-year
and is contented with deal furniture and boiled beef because he gives away two-thirds of his
income. That was a very fine thing of him,--taking into his house that poor lad Grattan, who
shot his mother by accident. He sacrifices more time than a less busy man could spare, to save
the poor fellow from getting into a morbid state of mind about it. He takes the lad out with
him constantly, I see."

"That is beautiful," said Maggie, who had let her work fall, and was listening with keen interest.
"I never knew any one who did such things."

"And one admires that sort of action in Kenn all the more," said Stephen, "because his manners
in general are rather cold and severe. There's nothing sugary and maudlin about him."

"Oh, I think he's a perfect character!" said Lucy, with pretty enthusiasm.

"No; there I can't agree with you," said Stephen, shaking his head with sarcastic gravity.

"Now, what fault can you point out in him?"

"He's an Anglican."

"Well, those are the right views, I think," said Lucy, gravely.

"That settles the question in the abstract," said Stephen, "but not from a parliamentary point
of view. He has set the Dissenters and the Church people by the ears; and a rising senator
like myself, of whose services the country is very much in need, will find it inconvenient
when he puts up for the honor of representing St. Ogg's in Parliament."

"Do you really think of that?" said Lucy, her eyes brightening with a proud pleasure that made
her neglect the argumentative interests of Anglicanism.

"Decidedly, whenever old Mr. Leyburn's public spirit and gout induce him to give way. My father's
heart is set on it; and gifts like mine, you know"--here Stephen drew himself up, and rubbed
his large white hands over his hair with playful self-admiration--"gifts like mine involve
great responsibilities. Don't you think so, Miss Tulliver?"

"Yes," said Maggie, smiling, but not looking up; "so much fluency and self-possession should
not be wasted entirely on private occasions."

"Ah, I see how much penetration you have," said Stephen. "You have discovered already that
I am talkative and impudent. Now superficial people never discern that, owing to my manner,
I suppose."

"She doesn't look at me when I talk of myself," he thought, while his listeners were laughing.
"I must try other subjects."

Did Lucy intend to be present at the meeting of the Book Club next week? was the next question.
Then followed the recommendation to choose Southey's "Life of Cowper," unless she were inclined
to be philosophical, and startle the ladies of St. Ogg's by voting for one of the Bridgewater
Treatises. Of course Lucy wished to know what these alarmingly learned books were; and as it
is always pleasant to improve the minds of ladies by talking to them at ease on subjects of
which they know nothing, Stephen became quite brilliant in an account of Buckland's Treatise,
which he had just been reading. He was rewarded by seeing Maggie let her work fall, and gradually
get so absorbed in his wonderful geological story that she sat looking at him, leaning forward
with crossed arms, and with an entire absence of self-consciousness, as if he had been the
snuffiest of old professors, and she a downy-lipped alumna. He was so fascinated by the clear,
large gaze that at last he forgot to look away from it occasionally toward Lucy; but she, sweet
child, was only rejoicing that Stephen was proving to Maggie how clever he was, and that they
would certainly be good friends after all.

"I will bring you the book, shall I, Miss Tulliver?" said Stephen, when he found the stream
of his recollections running rather shallow. "There are many illustrations in it that you will
like to see."

"Oh, thank you," said Maggie, blushing with returning self-consciousness at this direct address,
and taking up her work again.

"No, no," Lucy interposed. "I must forbid your plunging Maggie in books. I shall never get
her away from them; and I want her to have delicious do-nothing days, filled with boating and
chatting and riding and driving; that is the holiday she needs."

"Apropos!" said Stephen, looking at his watch. "Shall we go out for a row on the river now?
The tide will suit for us to the Tofton way, and we can walk back."

That was a delightful proposition to Maggie, for it was years since she had been on the river.
When she was gone to put on her bonnet, Lucy lingered to give an order to the servant, and
took the opportunity of telling Stephen that Maggie had no objection to seeing Philip, so that
it was a pity she had sent that note the day before yesterday. But she would write another
to-morrow and invite him.

"I'll call and beat him up to-morrow," said Stephen, "and bring him with me in the evening,
shall I? My sisters will want to call on you when I tell them your cousin is with you. I must
leave the field clear for them in the morning."

"Oh yes, pray bring him," said Lucy. "And you will like Maggie, sha'n't you?" she added, in
a beseeching tone. "Isn't she a dear, noble-looking creature?"

"Too tall," said Stephen, smiling down upon her, "and a little too fiery. She is not my type
of woman, you know."

Gentlemen, you are aware, are apt to impart these imprudent confidences to ladies concerning
their unfavorable opinion of sister fair ones. That is why so many women have the advantage
of knowing that they are secretly repulsive to men who have self-denyingly made ardent love
to them. And hardly anything could be more distinctively characteristic of Lucy than that she
both implicitly believed what Stephen said, and was determined that Maggie should not know
it. But you, who have a higher logic than the verbal to guide you, have already foreseen, as
the direct sequence to that unfavorable opinion of Stephen's, that he walked down to the boathouse
calculating, by the aid of a vivid imagination, that Maggie must give him her hand at least
twice in consequence of this pleasant boating plan, and that a gentleman who wishes ladies
to look at him is advantageously situated when he is rowing them in a boat. What then? Had
he fallen in love with this surprising daughter of Mrs. Tulliver at first sight? Certainly
not. Such passions are never heard of in real life. Besides, he was in love already, and half-engaged
to the dearest little creature in the world; and he was not a man to make a fool of himself
in any way. But when one is five-and-twenty, one has not chalk-stones at one's finger-ends
that the touch of a handsome girl should be entirely indifferent. It was perfectly natural
and safe to admire beauty and enjoy looking at it,--at least under such circumstances as the
present. And there was really something very interesting about this girl, with her poverty
and troubles; it was gratifying to see the friendship between the two cousins. Generally, Stephen
admitted, he was not fond of women who had any peculiarity of character, but here the peculiarity
seemed really of a superior kind, and provided one is not obliged to marry such women, why,
they certainly make a variety in social intercourse.

Maggie did not fulfil Stephen's hope by looking at him during the first quarter of an hour;
her eyes were too full of the old banks that she knew so well. She felt lonely, cut off from
Philip,--the only person who had ever seemed to love her devotedly, as she had always longed
to be loved. But presently the rhythmic movement of the oars attracted her, and she thought
she should like to learn how to row. This roused her from her reverie, and she asked if she
might take an oar. It appeared that she required much teaching, and she became ambitious. The
exercise brought the warm blood into her cheeks, and made her inclined to take her lesson merrily.

"I shall not be satisfied until I can manage both oars, and row you and Lucy," she said, looking
very bright as she stepped out of the boat. Maggie, we know, was apt to forget the thing she
was doing, and she had chosen an inopportune moment for her remark; her foot slipped, but happily
Mr. Stephen Guest held her hand, and kept her up with a firm grasp.

"You have not hurt yourself at all, I hope?" he said, bending to look in her face with anxiety.
It was very charming to be taken care of in that kind, graceful manner by some one taller and
stronger than one's self. Maggie had never felt just in the same way before.

When they reached home again, they found uncle and aunt Pullet seated with Mrs. Tulliver in
the drawing-room, and Stephen hurried away, asking leave to come again in the evening.

"And pray bring with you the volume of Purcell that you took away," said Lucy. "I want Maggie
to hear your best songs."

Aunt Pullet, under the certainty that Maggie would be invited to go out with Lucy, probably
to Park House, was much shocked at the shabbiness of her clothes, which when witnessed by the
higher society of St. Ogg's, would be a discredit to the family, that demanded a strong and
prompt remedy; and the consultation as to what would be most suitable to this end from among
the superfluities of Mrs. Pullet's wardrobe was one that Lucy as well as Mrs. Tulliver entered
into with some zeal. Maggie must really have an evening dress as soon as possible, and she
was about the same height as aunt Pullet.

"But she's so much broader across the shoulders than I am, it's very ill-convenient," said
Mrs. Pullet, "else she might wear that beautiful black brocade o' mine without any alteration;
and her arms are beyond everything," added Mrs. Pullet, sorrowfully, as she lifted Maggie's
large round arm, "She'd never get my sleeves on."

"Oh, never mind that, aunt; send us the dress," said Lucy. "I don't mean Maggie to have long
sleeves, and I have abundance of black lace for trimming. Her arms will look beautiful."

"Maggie's arms are a pretty shape," said Mrs. Tulliver. "They're like mine used to be, only
mine was never brown; I wish she'd had our family skin."

"Nonsense, aunty!" said Lucy, patting her aunt Tulliver's shoulder, "you don't understand those
things. A painter would think Maggie's complexion beautiful."

"Maybe, my dear," said Mrs. Tulliver, submissively. "You know better than I do. Only when I
was young a brown skin wasn't thought well on among respectable folks."

"No," said uncle Pullet, who took intense interest in the ladies' conversation as he sucked
his lozenges. "Though there was a song about the 'Nut-brown Maid' too; I think she was crazy,--crazy
Kate,--but I can't justly remember."

"Oh dear, dear!" said Maggie, laughing, but impatient; "I think that will be the end of my
brown skin, if it is always to be talked about so much."

Chapter III

Confidential Moments

When Maggie went up to her bedroom that night, it appeared that she was not at all inclined
to undress. She set down her candle on the first table that presented itself, and began to
walk up and down her room, which was a large one, with a firm, regular, and rather rapid step,
which showed that the exercise was the instinctive vent of strong excitement. Her eyes and
cheeks had an almost feverish brilliancy; her head was thrown backward, and her hands were
clasped with the palms outward, and with that tension of the arms which is apt to accompany
mental absorption.

Had anything remarkable happened?

Nothing that you are not likely to consider in the highest degree unimportant. She had been
hearing some fine music sung by a fine bass voice,--but then it was sung in a provincial, amateur
fashion, such as would have left a critical ear much to desire. And she was conscious of having
been looked at a great deal, in rather a furtive manner, from beneath a pair of well-marked
horizontal eyebrows, with a glance that seemed somehow to have caught the vibratory influence
of the voice. Such things could have had no perceptible effect on a thoroughly well-educated
young lady, with a perfectly balanced mind, who had had all the advantages of fortune, training,
and refined society. But if Maggie had been that young lady, you would probably have known
nothing about her: her life would have had so few vicissitudes that it could hardly have been
written; for the happiest women, like the happiest nations, have no history.

In poor Maggie's highly-strung, hungry nature,--just come away from a third-rate schoolroom,
with all its jarring sounds and petty round of tasks,--these apparently trivial causes had
the effect of rousing and exalting her imagination in a way that was mysterious to herself.
It was not that she thought distinctly of Mr. Stephen Guest, or dwelt on the indications that
he looked at her with admiration; it was rather that she felt the half-remote presence of a
world of love and beauty and delight, made up of vague, mingled images from all the poetry
and romance she had ever read, or had ever woven in her dreamy reveries. Her mind glanced back
once or twice to the time when she had courted privation, when she had thought all longing,
all impatience was subdued; but that condition seemed irrecoverably gone, and she recoiled
from the remembrance of it. No prayer, no striving now, would bring back that negative peace;
the battle of her life, it seemed, was not to be decided in that short and easy way,--by perfect
renunciation at the very threshold of her youth.

The music was vibrating in her still,--Purcell's music, with its wild passion and fancy,--and
she could not stay in the recollection of that bare, lonely past. She was in her brighter aerial
world again, when a little tap came at the door; of course it was her cousin, who entered in
ample white dressing-gown.

"Why, Maggie, you naughty child, haven't you begun to undress?" said Lucy, in astonishment.
"I promised not to come and talk to you, because I thought you must be tired. But here you
are, looking as if you were ready to dress for a ball. Come, come, get on your dressing-gown
and unplait your hair."

"Well, you are not very forward," retorted Maggie, hastily reaching her own pink cotton gown,
and looking at Lucy's light-brown hair brushed back in curly disorder.

"Oh, I have not much to do. I shall sit down and talk to you till I see you are really on the
way to bed."

While Maggie stood and unplaited her long black hair over her pink drapery, Lucy sat down near
the toilette-table, watching her with affectionate eyes, and head a little aside, like a pretty
spaniel. If it appears to you at all incredible that young ladies should be led on to talk
confidentially in a situation of this kind, I will beg you to remember that human life furnishes
many exceptional cases.

"You really have enjoyed the music to-night, haven't you Maggie?"

"Oh yes, that is what prevented me from feeling sleepy. I think I should have no other mortal
wants, if I could always have plenty of music. It seems to infuse strength into my limbs, and
ideas into my brain. Life seems to go on without effort, when I am filled with music. At other
times one is conscious of carrying a weight."

"And Stephen has a splendid voice, hasn't he?"

"Well, perhaps we are neither of us judges of that," said Maggie, laughing, as she seated herself
and tossed her long hair back. "You are not impartial, and I think any barrel-organ splendid."

"But tell me what you think of him, now. Tell me exactly; good and bad too."

"Oh, I think you should humiliate him a little. A lover should not be so much at ease, and
so self-confident. He ought to tremble more."

"Nonsense, Maggie! As if any one could tremble at me! You think he is conceited, I see that.
But you don't dislike him, do you?"

"Dislike him! No. Am I in the habit of seeing such charming people, that I should be very difficult
to please? Besides, how could I dislike any one that promised to make you happy, my dear thing!"
Maggie pinched Lucy's dimpled chin.

"We shall have more music to-morrow evening," said Lucy, looking happy already, "for Stephen
will bring Philip Wakem with him."

"Oh, Lucy, I can't see him," said Maggie, turning pale. "At least, I could not see him without
Tom's leave."

"Is Tom such a tyrant as that?" said Lucy, surprised. "I'll take the responsibility, then,--tell
him it was my fault."

"But, dear," said Maggie, falteringly, "I promised Tom very solemnly, before my father's death,--I
promised him I would not speak to Philip without his knowledge and consent. And I have a great
dread of opening the subject with Tom,--of getting into a quarrel with him again."

"But I never heard of anything so strange and unreasonable. What harm can poor Philip have
done? May I speak to Tom about it?"

"Oh no, pray don't, dear," said Maggie. "I'll go to him myself to-morrow, and tell him that
you wish Philip to come. I've thought before of asking him to absolve me from my promise, but
I've not had the courage to determine on it."

They were both silent for some moments, and then Lucy said,--

"Maggie, you have secrets from me, and I have none from you."

Maggie looked meditatively away from Lucy. Then she turned to her and said, "I should like
to tell you about Philip. But, Lucy, you must not betray that you know it to any one--least
of all to Philip himself, or to Mr. Stephen Guest."

The narrative lasted long, for Maggie had never before known the relief of such an outpouring;
she had never before told Lucy anything of her inmost life; and the sweet face bent toward
her with sympathetic interest, and the little hand pressing hers, encouraged her to speak on.
On two points only she was not expansive. She did not betray fully what still rankled in her
mind as Tom's great offence,--the insults he had heaped on Philip. Angry as the remembrance
still made her, she could not bear that any one else should know it at all, both for Tom's
sake and Philip's. And she could not bear to tell Lucy of the last scene between her father
and Wakem, though it was this scene which she had ever since felt to be a new barrier between
herself and Philip. She merely said, she saw now that Tom was, no the whole, right in regarding
any prospect of love and marriage between her and Philip as put out of the question by the
relation of the two families. Of course Philip's father would never consent.

"There, Lucy, you have had my story," said Maggie, smiling, with the tears in her eyes. "You
see I am like Sir Andrew Aguecheek. I was adored once."

"Ah, now I see how it is you know Shakespeare and everything, and have learned so much since
you left school; which always seemed to me witchcraft before,--part of your general uncanniness,"
said Lucy.

She mused a little with her eyes downward, and then added, looking at Maggie, "It is very beautiful
that you should love Philip; I never thought such a happiness would befall him. And in my opinion,
you ought not to give him up. There are obstacles now; but they may be done away with in time."

Maggie shook her head.

"Yes, yes," persisted Lucy; "I can't help being hopeful about it. There is something romantic
in it,--out of the common way,--just what everything that happens to you ought to be. And Philip
will adore you like a husband in a fairy tale. Oh, I shall puzzle my small brain to contrive
some plot that will bring everybody into the right mind, so that you may marry Philip when
I marry--somebody else. Wouldn't that be a pretty ending to all my poor, poor Maggie's troubles?"

Maggie tried to smile, but shivered, as if she felt a sudden chill.

"Ah, dear, you are cold," said Lucy. "You must go to bed; and so must I. I dare not think what
time it is."

They kissed each other, and Lucy went away, possessed of a confidence which had a strong influence
over her subsequent impressions. Maggie had been thoroughly sincere; her nature had never found
it easy to be otherwise. But confidences are sometimes blinding, even when they are sincere.

Chapter IV

Brother and Sister

Maggie was obliged to go to Tom's lodgings in the middle of the day, when he would be coming
in to dinner, else she would not have found him at home. He was not lodging with entire strangers.
Our friend Bob Jakin had, with Mumps's tacit consent, taken not only a wife about eight months
ago, but also one of those queer old houses, pierced with surprising passages, by the water-side,
where, as he observed, his wife and mother could keep themselves out of mischief by letting
out two "pleasure-boats," in which he had invested some of his savings, and by taking in a
lodger for the parlor and spare bedroom. Under these circumstances, what could be better for
the interests of all parties, sanitary considerations apart, than that the lodger should be
Mr. Tom?

It was Bob's wife who opened the door to Maggie. She was a tiny woman, with the general physiognomy
of a Dutch doll, looking, in comparison with Bob's mother, who filled up the passage in the
rear, very much like one of those human figures which the artist finds conveniently standing
near a colossal statue to show the proportions. The tiny woman curtsied and looked up at Maggie
with some awe as soon as she had opened the door; but the words, "Is my brother at home?" which
Maggie uttered smilingly, made her turn round with sudden excitement, and say,--

"Eh, mother, mother--tell Bob!--it's Miss Maggie! Come in, Miss, for goodness do," she went
on, opening a side door, and endeavoring to flatten her person against the wall to make the
utmost space for the visitor.

Sad recollections crowded on Maggie as she entered the small parlor, which was now all that
poor Tom had to call by the name of "home,"--that name which had once, so many years ago, meant
for both of them the same sum of dear familiar objects. But everything was not strange to her
in this new room; the first thing her eyes dwelt on was the large old Bible, and the sight
was not likely to disperse the old memories. She stood without speaking.

"If you please to take the privilege o' sitting down, Miss," said Mrs. Jakin, rubbing her apron
over a perfectly clean chair, and then lifting up the corner of that garment and holding it
to her face with an air of embarrassment, as she looked wonderingly at Maggie.

"Bob is at home, then?" said Maggie, recovering herself, and smiling at the bashful Dutch doll.

"Yes, Miss; but I think he must be washing and dressing himself; I'll go and see," said Mrs.
Jakin, disappearing.

But she presently came back walking with new courage a little way behind her husband, who showed
the brilliancy of his blue eyes and regular white teeth in the doorway, bowing respectfully.

"How do you do, Bob?" said Maggie, coming forward and putting out her hand to him; "I always
meant to pay your wife a visit, and I shall come another day on purpose for that, if she will
let me. But I was obliged to come to-day to speak to my brother."

"He'll be in before long, Miss. He's doin' finely, Mr. Tom is; he'll be one o' the first men
hereabouts,--you'll see that."

"Well, Bob, I'm sure he'll be indebted to you, whatever he becomes; he said so himself only
the other night, when he was talking of you."

"Eh, Miss, that's his way o' takin' it. But I think the more on't when he says a thing, because
his tongue doesn't overshoot him as mine does. Lors! I'm no better nor a tilted bottle, I ar'n't,--I
can't stop mysen when once I begin. But you look rarely, Miss; it does me good to see you.
What do you say now, Prissy?"--here Bob turned to his wife,--"Isn't it all come true as I said?
Though there isn't many sorts o' goods as I can't over-praise when I set my tongue to't."

Mrs. Bob's small nose seemed to be following the example of her eyes in turning up reverentially
toward Maggie, but she was able now to smile and curtsey, and say, "I'd looked forrard like
aenything to seein' you, Miss, for my husband's tongue's been runnin' on you, like as if he
was light-headed, iver since first he come a-courtin' on me."

"Well, well," said Bob, looking rather silly. "Go an' see after the taters, else Mr. Tom 'ull
have to wait for 'em."

"I hope Mumps is friendly with Mrs. Jakin, Bob," said Maggie, smiling. "I remember you used
to say he wouldn't like your marrying."

"Eh, Miss," said Bob, "he made up his mind to't when he see'd what a little un she was. He
pretends not to see her mostly, or else to think as she isn't full-growed. But about Mr. Tom,
Miss," said Bob, speaking lower and looking serious, "he's as close as a iron biler, he is;
but I'm a 'cutish chap, an' when I've left off carrying my pack, an' am at a loose end, I've
got more brains nor I know what to do wi', an' I'm forced to busy myself wi' other folks's
insides. An' it worrets me as Mr. Tom'll sit by himself so glumpish, a-knittin' his brow, an'
a-lookin' at the fire of a night. He should be a bit livelier now, a fine young fellow like
him. My wife says, when she goes in sometimes, an' he takes no notice of her, he sits lookin'
into the fire, and frownin' as if he was watchin' folks at work in it."

"He thinks so much about business," said Maggie.

"Ay," said Bob, speaking lower; "but do you think it's nothin' else, Miss? He's close, Mr.
Tom is; but I'm a 'cute chap, I am, an' I thought tow'rt last Christmas as I'd found out a
soft place in him. It was about a little black spaniel--a rare bit o' breed--as he made a fuss
to get. But since then summat's come over him, as he's set his teeth again' things more nor
iver, for all he's had such good luck. An' I wanted to tell you, Miss, 'cause I thought you
might work it out of him a bit, now you're come. He's a deal too lonely, and doesn't go into
company enough."

"I'm afraid I have very little power over him, Bob," said Maggie, a good deal moved by Bob's
suggestion. It was a totally new idea to her mind that Tom could have his love troubles. Poor
fellow!--and in love with Lucy too! But it was perhaps a mere fancy of Bob's too officious
brain. The present of the dog meant nothing more than cousinship and gratitude. But Bob had
already said, "Here's Mr. Tom," and the outer door was opening.

"There is no time to spare, Tom," said Maggie, as soon as Bob left the room. "I must tell you
at once what I came about, else I shall be hindering you from taking your dinner."

Tom stood with his back against the chimney-piece, and Maggie was seated opposite the light.
He noticed that she was tremulous, and he had a presentiment of the subject she was going to
speak about. The presentiment made his voice colder and harder as he said, "What is it?"

This tone roused a spirit of resistance in Maggie, and she put her request in quite a different
form from the one she had predetermined on. She rose from her seat, and looking straight at
Tom, said,--

"I want you to absolve me from my promise about Philip Wakem. Or rather, I promised you not
to see him without telling you. I am come to tell you that I wish to see him."

"Very well," said Tom, still more coldly.

But Maggie had hardly finished speaking in that chill, defiant manner, before she repented,
and felt the dread of alienation from her brother.

"Not for myself, dear Tom. Don't be angry. I shouldn't have asked it, only that Philip, you
know, is a friend of Lucy's and she wishes him to come, has invited him to come this evening;
and I told her I couldn't see him without telling you. I shall only see him in the presence
of other people. There will never be anything secret between us again."

Tom looked away from Maggie, knitting his brow more strongly for a little while. Then he turned
to her and said, slowly and emphatically,--

"You know what is my feeling on that subject, Maggie. There is no need for my repeating anything
I said a year ago. While my father was living, I felt bound to use the utmost power over you,
to prevent you from disgracing him as well as yourself, and all of us. But now I must leave
you to your own choice. You wish to be independent; you told me so after my father's death.
My opinion is not changed. If you think of Philip Wakem as a lover again, you must give up me."

"I don't wish it, dear Tom, at least as things are; I see that it would lead to misery. But
I shall soon go away to another situation, and I should like to be friends with him again while
I am here. Lucy wishes it."

The severity of Tom's face relaxed a little.

"I shouldn't mind your seeing him occasionally at my uncle's--I don't want you to make a fuss
on the subject. But I have no confidence in you, Maggie. You would be led away to do anything."

That was a cruel word. Maggie's lip began to tremble.

"Why will you say that, Tom? It is very hard of you. Have I not done and borne everything as
well as I could? And I kept my word to you--when--when----My life has not been a happy one,
any more than yours."

She was obliged to be childish; the tears would come. When Maggie was not angry, she was as
dependent on kind or cold words as a daisy on the sunshine or the cloud; the need of being
loved would always subdue her, as, in old days, it subdued her in the worm-eaten attic. The
brother's goodness came uppermost at this appeal, but it could only show itself in Tom's fashion.
He put his hand gently on her arm, and said, in the tone of a kind pedagogue,--

"Now listen to me, Maggie. I'll tell you what I mean. You're always in extremes; you have no
judgment and self-command; and yet you think you know best, and will not submit to be guided.
You know I didn't wish you to take a situation. My aunt Pullet was willing to give you a good
home, and you might have lived respectably amongst your relations, until I could have provided
a home for you with my mother. And that is what I should like to do. I wished my sister to
be a lady, and I always have taken care of you, as my father desired, until you were well married.
But your ideas and mine never accord, and you will not give way. Yet you might have sense enough
to see that a brother, who goes out into the world and mixes with men, necessarily knows better
what is right and respectable for his sister than she can know herself. You think I am not
kind; but my kindness can only be directed by what I believe to be good for you."

"Yes, I know, dear Tom," said Maggie, still half-sobbing, but trying to control her tears.
"I know you would do a great deal for me; I know how you work, and don't spare yourself. I
am grateful to you. But, indeed, you can't quite judge for me; our natures are very different.
You don't know how differently things affect me from what they do you."

"Yes, I do know; I know it too well. I know how differently you must feel about all that affects
our family, and your own dignity as a young woman, before you could think of receiving secret
addresses from Philip Wakem. If it was not disgusting to me in every other way, I should object
to my sister's name being associated for a moment with that of a young man whose father must
hate the very thought of us all, and would spurn you. With any one but you, I should think
it quite certain that what you witnessed just before my father's death would secure you from
ever thinking again of Philip Wakem as a lover. But I don't feel certain of it with you; I
never feel certain about anything with you. At one time you take pleasure in a sort of perverse
self-denial, and at another you have not resolution to resist a thing that you know to be wrong."

There was a terrible cutting truth in Tom's words,--that hard rind of truth which is discerned
by unimaginative, unsympathetic minds. Maggie always writhed under this judgment of Tom's;
she rebelled and was humiliated in the same moment; it seemed as if he held a glass before
her to show her her own folly and weakness, as if he were a prophetic voice predicting her
future fallings; and yet, all the while, she judged him in return; she said inwardly that he
was narrow and unjust, that he was below feeling those mental needs which were often the source
of the wrong-doing or absurdity that made her life a planless riddle to him.

She did not answer directly; her heart was too full, and she sat down, leaning her arm on the
table. It was no use trying to make Tom feel that she was near to him. He always repelled her.
Her feeling under his words was complicated by the allusion to the last scene between her father
and Wakem; and at length that painful, solemn memory surmounted the immediate grievance. No!
She did not think of such things with frivolous indifference, and Tom must not accuse her of
that. She looked up at him with a grave, earnest gaze and said,--

"I can't make you think better of me, Tom, by anything I can say. But I am not so shut out
from all your feelings as you believe me to be. I see as well as you do that from our position
with regard to Philip's father--not on other grounds--it would be unreasonable, it would be
wrong, for us to entertain the idea of marriage; and I have given up thinking of him as a lover.
I am telling you the truth, and you have no right to disbelieve me; I have kept my word to
you, and you have never detected me in a falsehood. I should not only not encourage, I should
carefully avoid, any intercourse with Philip on any other footing than of quiet friendship.
You may think that I am unable to keep my resolutions; but at least you ought not to treat
me with hard contempt on the ground of faults that I have not committed yet."

"Well, Maggie," said Tom, softening under this appeal, "I don't want to overstrain matters.
I think, all things considered, it will be best for you to see Philip Wakem, if Lucy wishes
him to come to the house. I believe what you say,--at least you believe it yourself, I know;
I can only warn you. I wish to be as good a brother to you as you will let me."

There was a little tremor in Tom's voice as he uttered the last words, and Maggie's ready affection
came back with as sudden a glow as when they were children, and bit their cake together as
a sacrament of conciliation. She rose and laid her hand on Tom's shoulder.

"Dear Tom, I know you mean to be good. I know you have had a great deal to bear, and have done
a great deal. I should like to be a comfort to you, not to vex you. You don't think I'm altogether
naughty, now, do you?"

Tom smiled at the eager face; his smiles were very pleasant to see when they did come, for
the gray eyes could be tender underneath the frown.

"No, Maggie."

"I may turn out better than you expect."

"I hope you will."

"And may I come some day and make tea for you, and see this extremely small wife of Bob's again?"

"Yes; but trot away now, for I've no more time to spare," said Tom, looking at his watch.

"Not to give me a kiss?"

Tom bent to kiss her cheek, and then said,--

"There! Be a good girl. I've got a great deal to think of to-day. I'm going to have a long
consultation with my uncle Deane this afternoon."

"You'll come to aunt Glegg's to-morrow? We're going all to dine early, that we may go there
to tea. You must come; Lucy told me to say so."

"Oh, pooh! I've plenty else to do," said Tom, pulling his bell violently, and bringing down
the small bell-rope.

"I'm frightened; I shall run away," said Maggie, making a laughing retreat; while Tom, with
masculine philosophy, flung the bell-rope to the farther end of the room; not very far either,--a
touch of human experience which I flatter myself will come home to the bosoms of not a few
substantial or distinguished men who were once at an early stage of their rise in the world,
and were cherishing very large hopes in very small lodgings.

Chapter V

Showing That Tom Had Opened the Oyster

"And now we've settled this Newcastle business, Tom," said Mr. Deane, that same afternoon,
as they were seated in the private room at the Bank together, "there's another matter I want
to talk to you about. Since you're likely to have rather a smoky, unpleasant time of it at
Newcastle for the next few weeks, you'll want a good prospect of some sort to keep up your
spirits."

Tom waited less nervously than he had done on a former occasion in this apartment, while his
uncle took out his snuff-box and gratified each nostril with deliberate impartiality.

"You see, Tom," said Mr. Deane at last, throwing himself backward, "the world goes on at a
smarter pace now than it did when I was a young fellow. Why, sir, forty years ago, when I was
much such a strapping youngster as you, a man expected to pull between the shafts the best
part of his life, before he got the whip in his hand. The looms went slowish, and fashions
didn't alter quite so fast; I'd a best suit that lasted me six years. Everything was on a lower
scale, sir,--in point of expenditure, I mean. It's this steam, you see, that has made the difference;
it drives on every wheel double pace, and the wheel of fortune along with 'em, as our Mr. Stephen
Guest said at the anniversary dinner (he hits these things off wonderfully, considering he's
seen nothing of business). I don't find fault with the change, as some people do. Trade, sir,
opens a man's eyes; and if the population is to get thicker upon the ground, as it's doing,
the world must use its wits at inventions of one sort or other. I know I've done my share as
an ordinary man of business. Somebody has said it's a fine thing to make two ears of corn grow
where only one grew before; but, sir, it's a fine thing, too, to further the exchange of commodities,
and bring the grains of corn to the mouths that are hungry. And that's our line of business;
and I consider it as honorable a position as a man can hold, to be connected with it."

Tom knew that the affair his uncle had to speak of was not urgent; Mr. Deane was too shrewd
and practical a man to allow either his reminiscences or his snuff to impede the progress of
trade. Indeed, for the last month or two, there had been hints thrown out to Tom which enabled
him to guess that he was going to hear some proposition for his own benefit. With the beginning
of the last speech he had stretched out his legs, thrust his hands in his pockets, and prepared
himself for some introductory diffuseness, tending to show that Mr. Deane had succeeded by
his own merit, and that what he had to say to young men in general was, that if they didn't
succeed too it was because of their own demerit. He was rather surprised, then, when his uncle
put a direct question to him.

"Let me see,--it's going on for seven years now since you applied to me for a situation, eh, Tom?"

"Yes, sir; I'm three-and-twenty now," said Tom.

"Ah, it's as well not to say that, though; for you'd pass for a good deal older, and age tells
well in business. I remember your coming very well; I remember I saw there was some pluck in
you, and that was what made me give you encouragement. And I'm happy to say I was right; I'm
not often deceived. I was naturally a little shy at pushing my nephew, but I'm happy to say
you've done me credit, sir; and if I'd had a son o' my own, I shouldn't have been sorry to
see him like you."

Mr. Deane tapped his box and opened it again, repeating in a tone of some feeling, "No, I shouldn't
have been sorry to see him like you."

"I'm very glad I've given you satisfaction, sir; I've done my best," said Tom, in his proud,
independent way.

"Yes, Tom, you've given me satisfaction. I don't speak of your conduct as a son; though that
weighs with me in my opinion of you. But what I have to do with, as a partner in our firm,
is the qualities you've shown as a man o' business. Ours is a fine business,--a splendid concern,
sir,--and there's no reason why it shouldn't go on growing; there's a growing capital, and
growing outlets for it; but there's another thing that's wanted for the prosperity of every
concern, large or small, and that's men to conduct it,--men of the right habits; none o' your
flashy fellows, but such as are to be depended on. Now this is what Mr. Guest and I see clear
enough. Three years ago we took Gell into the concern; we gave him a share in the oil-mill.
And why? Why, because Gell was a fellow whose services were worth a premium. So it will always
be, sir. So it was with me. And though Gell is pretty near ten years older than you, there
are other points in your favor."

Tom was getting a little nervous as Mr. Deane went on speaking; he was conscious of something
he had in his mind to say, which might not be agreeable to his uncle, simply because it was
a new suggestion rather than an acceptance of the proposition he foresaw.

"It stands to reason," Mr. Deane went on, when he had finished his new pinch, "that your being
my nephew weighs in your favor; but I don't deny that if you'd been no relation of mine at
all, your conduct in that affair of Pelley's bank would have led Mr. Guest and myself to make
some acknowledgment of the service you've been to us; and, backed by your general conduct and
business ability, it has made us determine on giving you a share in the business,--a share
which we shall be glad to increase as the years go on. We think that'll be better, on all grounds,
than raising your salary. It'll give you more importance, and prepare you better for taking
some of the anxiety off my shoulders by and by. I'm equal to a good deal o' work at present,
thank God; but I'm getting older,--there's no denying that. I told Mr. Guest I would open the
subject to you; and when you come back from this northern business, we can go into particulars.
This is a great stride for a young fellow of three-and-twenty, but I'm bound to say you've
deserved it."

"I'm very grateful to Mr. Guest and you, sir; of course I feel the most indebted to you, who
first took me into the business, and have taken a good deal of pains with me since."

Tom spoke with a slight tremor, and paused after he had said this.

"Yes, yes," said Mr. Deane. "I don't spare pains when I see they'll be of any use. I gave myself
some trouble with Gell, else he wouldn't have been what he is."

"But there's one thing I should like to mention to you uncle. I've never spoken to you of it
before. If you remember, at the time my father's property was sold, there was some thought
of your firm buying the Mill; I know you thought it would be a very good investment, especially
if steam were applied."

"To be sure, to be sure. But Wakem outbid us; he'd made up his mind to that. He's rather fond
of carrying everything over other people's heads."

"Perhaps it's of no use my mentioning it at present," Tom went on, "but I wish you to know
what I have in my mind about the Mill. I've a strong feeling about it. It was my father's dying
wish that I should try and get it back again whenever I could; it was in his family for five
generations. I promised my father; and besides that, I'm attached to the place. I shall never
like any other so well. And if it should ever suit your views to buy it for the firm, I should
have a better chance of fulfilling my father's wish. I shouldn't have liked to mention the
thing to you, only you've been kind enough to say my services have been of some value. And
I'd give up a much greater chance in life for the sake of having the Mill again,--I mean having
it in my own hands, and gradually working off the price."

Mr. Deane had listened attentively, and now looked thoughtful.

"I see, I see," he said, after a while; "the thing would be possible if there were any chance
of Wakem's parting with the property. But that I don't see. He's put that young Jetsome in
the place; and he had his reasons when he bought it, I'll be bound."

"He's a loose fish, that young Jetsome," said Tom. "He's taking to drinking, and they say he's
letting the business go down. Luke told me about it,--our old miller. He says he sha'n't stay
unless there's an alteration. I was thinking, if things went on that way, Wakem might be more
willing to part with the Mill. Luke says he's getting very sour about the way things are going on."

"Well, I'll turn it over, Tom. I must inquire into the matter, and go into it with Mr. Guest.
But, you see, it's rather striking out a new branch, and putting you to that, instead of keeping
you where you are, which was what we'd wanted."

"I should be able to manage more than the Mill when things were once set properly going, sir.
I want to have plenty of work. There's nothing else I care about much."

There was something rather sad in that speech from a young man of three-and-twenty, even in
uncle Deane's business-loving ears.

"Pooh, pooh! you'll be having a wife to care about one of these days, if you get on at this
pace in the world. But as to this Mill, we mustn't reckon on our chickens too early. However,
I promise you to bear it in mind, and when you come back we'll talk of it again. I am going
to dinner now. Come and breakfast with us to-morrow morning, and say good-bye to your mother
and sister before you start."

Chapter VI

Illustrating the Laws of Attraction

It is evident to you now that Maggie had arrived at a moment in her life which must be considered
by all prudent persons as a great opportunity for a young woman. Launched into the higher society
of St. Ogg's, with a striking person, which had the advantage of being quite unfamiliar to
the majority of beholders, and with such moderate assistance of costume as you have seen foreshadowed
in Lucy's anxious colloquy with aunt Pullet, Maggie was certainly at a new starting-point in
life. At Lucy's first evening party, young Torry fatigued his facial muscles more than usual
in order that "the dark-eyed girl there in the corner" might see him in all the additional
style conferred by his eyeglass; and several young ladies went home intending to have short
sleeves with black lace, and to plait their hair in a broad coronet at the back of their head,--"That
cousin of Miss Deane's looked so very well." In fact, poor Maggie, with all her inward consciousness
of a painful past and her presentiment of a troublous future, was on the way to become an object
of some envy,--a topic of discussion in the newly established billiard-room, and between fair
friends who had no secrets from each other on the subject of trimmings. The Miss Guests, who
associated chiefly on terms of condescension with the families of St. Ogg's, and were the glass
of fashion there, took some exception to Maggie's manners. She had a way of not assenting at
once to the observations current in good society, and of saying that she didn't know whether
those observations were true or not, which gave her an air of gaucherie, and impeded the even
flow of conversation; but it is a fact capable of an amiable interpretation that ladies are
not the worst disposed toward a new acquaintance of their own sex because she has points of
inferiority. And Maggie was so entirely without those pretty airs of coquetry which have the
traditional reputation of driving gentlemen to despair that she won some feminine pity for
being so ineffective in spite of her beauty. She had not had many advantages, poor thing! and
it must be admitted there was no pretension about her; her abruptness and unevenness of manner
were plainly the result of her secluded and lowly circumstances. It was only a wonder that
there was no tinge of vulgarity about her, considering what the rest of poor Lucy's relations
were--an allusion which always made the Miss Guests shudder a little. It was not agreeable
to think of any connection by marriage with such people as the Gleggs and the Pullets; but
it was of no use to contradict Stephen when once he had set his mind on anything, and certainly
there was no possible objection to Lucy in herself,--no one could help liking her. She would
naturally desire that the Miss Guests should behave kindly to this cousin of whom she was so
fond, and Stephen would make a great fuss if they were deficient in civility. Under these circumstances
the invitations to Park House were not wanting; and elsewhere, also, Miss Deane was too popular
and too distinguished a member of society in St. Ogg's for any attention toward her to be neglected.

Thus Maggie was introduced for the first time to the young lady's life, and knew what it was
to get up in the morning without any imperative reason for doing one thing more than another.
This new sense of leisure and unchecked enjoyment amidst the soft-breathing airs and garden-scents
of advancing spring--amidst the new abundance of music, and lingering strolls in the sunshine,
and the delicious dreaminess of gliding on the river--could hardly be without some intoxicating
effect on her, after her years of privation; and even in the first week Maggie began to be
less haunted by her sad memories and anticipations. Life was certainly very pleasant just now;
it was becoming very pleasant to dress in the evening, and to feel that she was one of the
beautiful things of this spring-time. And there were admiring eyes always awaiting her now;
she was no longer an unheeded person, liable to be chid, from whom attention was continually
claimed, and on whom no one felt bound to confer any. It was pleasant, too, when Stephen and
Lucy were gone out riding, to sit down at the piano alone, and find that the old fitness between
her fingers and the keys remained, and revived, like a sympathetic kinship not to be worn out
by separation; to get the tunes she had heard the evening before, and repeat them again and
again until she had found out a way of producing them so as to make them a more pregnant, passionate
language to her. The mere concord of octaves was a delight to Maggie, and she would often take
up a book of studies rather than any melody, that she might taste more keenly by abstraction
the more primitive sensation of intervals. Not that her enjoyment of music was of the kind
that indicates a great specific talent; it was rather that her sensibility to the supreme excitement
of music was only one form of that passionate sensibility which belonged to her whole nature,
and made her faults and virtues all merge in each other; made her affections sometimes an impatient
demand, but also prevented her vanity from taking the form of mere feminine coquetry and device,
and gave it the poetry of ambition. But you have known Maggie a long while, and need to be
told, not her characteristics, but her history, which is a thing hardly to be predicted even
from the completest knowledge of characteristics. For the tragedy of our lives is not created
entirely from within. "Character," says Novalis, in one of his questionable aphorisms,--"character
is destiny." But not the whole of our destiny. Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, was speculative and
irresolute, and we have a great tragedy in consequence. But if his father had lived to a good
old age, and his uncle had died an early death, we can conceive Hamlet's having married Ophelia,
and got through life with a reputation of sanity, notwithstanding many soliloquies, and some
moody sarcasms toward the fair daughter of Polonius, to say nothing of the frankest incivility
to his father-in-law.

Maggie's destiny, then, is at present hidden, and we must wait for it to reveal itself like
the course of an unmapped river; we only know that the river is full and rapid, and that for
all rivers there is the same final home. Under the charm of her new pleasures, Maggie herself
was ceasing to think, with her eager prefiguring imagination, of her future lot; and her anxiety
about her first interview with Philip was losing its predominance; perhaps, unconsciously to
herself, she was not sorry that the interview had been deferred.

For Philip had not come the evening he was expected, and Mr. Stephen Guest brought word that
he was gone to the coast,--probably, he thought, on a sketching expedition; but it was not
certain when he would return. It was just like Philip, to go off in that way without telling
any one. It was not until the twelfth day that he returned, to find both Lucy's notes awaiting
him; he had left before he knew of Maggie's arrival.

Perhaps one had need be nineteen again to be quite convinced of the feelings that were crowded
for Maggie into those twelve days; of the length to which they were stretched for her by the
novelty of her experience in them, and the varying attitudes of her mind. The early days of
an acquaintance almost always have this importance for us, and fill up a larger space in our
memory than longer subsequent periods, which have been less filled with discovery and new impressions.
There were not many hours in those ten days in which Mr. Stephen Guest was not seated by Lucy's
side, or standing near her at the piano, or accompanying her on some outdoor excursion; his
attentions were clearly becoming more assiduous, and that was what every one had expected.
Lucy was very happy, all the happier because Stephen's society seemed to have become much more
interesting and amusing since Maggie had been there. Playful discussions--sometimes serious
ones--were going forward, in which both Stephen and Maggie revealed themselves, to the admiration
of the gentle, unobtrusive Lucy; and it more than once crossed her mind what a charming quartet
they should have through life when Maggie married Philip. Is it an inexplicable thing that
a girl should enjoy her lover's society the more for the presence of a third person, and be
without the slightest spasm of jealousy that the third person had the conversation habitually
directed to her? Not when that girl is as tranquil-hearted as Lucy, thoroughly possessed with
a belief that she knows the state of her companions' affections, and not prone to the feelings
which shake such a belief in the absence of positive evidence against it. Besides, it was Lucy
by whom Stephen sat, to whom he gave his arm, to whom he appealed as the person sure to agree
with him; and every day there was the same tender politeness toward her, the same consciousness
of her wants and care to supply them. Was there really the same? It seemed to Lucy that there
was more; and it was no wonder that the real significance of the change escaped her. It was
a subtle act of conscience in Stephen that even he himself was not aware of. His personal attentions
to Maggie were comparatively slight, and there had even sprung up an apparent distance between
them, that prevented the renewal of that faint resemblance to gallantry into which he had fallen
the first day in the boat. If Stephen came in when Lucy was out of the room, if Lucy left them
together, they never spoke to each other; Stephen, perhaps, seemed to be examining books or
music, and Maggie bent her head assiduously over her work. Each was oppressively conscious
of the other's presence, even to the finger-ends. Yet each looked and longed for the same thing
to happen the next day. Neither of them had begun to reflect on the matter, or silently to
ask, "To what does all this tend?" Maggie only felt that life was revealing something quite
new to her; and she was absorbed in the direct, immediate experience, without any energy left
for taking account of it and reasoning about it. Stephen wilfully abstained from self-questioning,
and would not admit to himself that he felt an influence which was to have any determining
effect on his conduct. And when Lucy came into the room again, they were once more unconstrained;
Maggie could contradict Stephen, and laugh at him, and he could recommend to her consideration
the example of that most charming heroine, Miss Sophia Western, who had a great "respect for
the understandings of men." Maggie could look at Stephen, which, for some reason or other she
always avoided when they were alone; and he could even ask her to play his accompaniment for
him, since Lucy's fingers were so busy with that bazaar-work, and lecture her on hurrying the
tempo, which was certainly Maggie's weak point.

One day--it was the day of Philip's return--Lucy had formed a sudden engagement to spend the
evening with Mrs. Kenn, whose delicate state of health, threatening to become confirmed illness
through an attack of bronchitis, obliged her to resign her functions at the coming bazaar into
the hands of other ladies, of whom she wished Lucy to be one. The engagement had been formed
in Stephen's presence, and he had heard Lucy promise to dine early and call at six o'clock
for Miss Torry, who brought Mrs. Kenn's request.

"Here is another of the moral results of this idiotic bazaar," Stephen burst forth, as soon
as Miss Torry had left the room,--"taking young ladies from the duties of the domestic hearth
into scenes of dissipation among urn-rugs and embroidered reticules! I should like to know
what is the proper function of women, if it is not to make reasons for husbands to stay at
home, and still stronger reasons for bachelors to go out. If this goes on much longer, the
bonds of society will be dissolved."

"Well, it will not go on much longer," said Lucy, laughing, "for the bazaar is to take place
on Monday week."

"Thank Heaven!" said Stephen. "Kenn himself said the other day that he didn't like this plan
of making vanity do the work of charity; but just as the British public is not reasonable enough
to bear direct taxation, so St. Ogg's has not got force of motive enough to build and endow
schools without calling in the force of folly."

"Did he say so?" said little Lucy, her hazel eyes opening wide with anxiety. "I never heard
him say anything of that kind; I thought he approved of what we were doing."

"I'm sure he approves you," said Stephen, smiling at her affectionately; "your conduct in going
out to-night looks vicious, I own, but I know there is benevolence at the bottom of it."

"Oh, you think too well of me," said Lucy, shaking her head, with a pretty blush, and there
the subject ended. But it was tacitly understood that Stephen would not come in the evening;
and on the strength of that tacit understanding he made his morning visit the longer, not saying
good-bye until after four.

Maggie was seated in the drawing-room, alone, shortly after dinner, with Minny on her lap,
having left her uncle to his wine and his nap, and her mother to the compromise between knitting
and nodding, which, when there was no company, she always carried on in the dining-room till
tea-time. Maggie was stooping to caress the tiny silken pet, and comforting him for his mistress's
absence, when the sound of a footstep on the gravel made her look up, and she saw Mr. Stephen
Guest walking up the garden, as if he had come straight from the river. It was very unusual
to see him so soon after dinner! He often complained that their dinner-hour was late at Park
House. Nevertheless, there he was, in his black dress; he had evidently been home, and must
have come again by the river. Maggie felt her cheeks glowing and her heart beating; it was
natural she should be nervous, for she was not accustomed to receive visitors alone. He had
seen her look up through the open window, and raised his hat as he walked toward it, to enter
that way instead of by the door. He blushed too, and certainly looked as foolish as a young
man of some wit and self-possession can be expected to look, as he walked in with a roll of
music in his hand, and said, with an air of hesitating improvisation,--

"You are surprised to see me again, Miss Tulliver; I ought to apologize for coming upon you
by surprise, but I wanted to come into the town, and I got our man to row me; so I thought
I would bring these things from the 'Maid of Artois' for your cousin; I forgot them this morning.
Will you give them to her?"

"Yes," said Maggie, who had risen confusedly with Minny in her arms, and now, not quite knowing
what else to do, sat down again.

Stephen laid down his hat, with the music, which rolled on the floor, and sat down in the chair
close by her. He had never done so before, and both he and Maggie were quite aware that it
was an entirely new position.

"Well, you pampered minion!" said Stephen, leaning to pull the long curly ears that drooped
over Maggie's arm. It was not a suggestive remark, and as the speaker did not follow it up
by further development, it naturally left the conversation at a standstill. It seemed to Stephen
like some action in a dream that he was obliged to do, and wonder at himself all the while,--to
go on stroking Minny's head. Yet it was very pleasant; he only wished he dared look at Maggie,
and that she would look at him,--let him have one long look into those deep, strange eyes of
hers, and then he would be satisfied and quite reasonable after that. He thought it was becoming
a sort of monomania with him, to want that long look from Maggie; and he was racking his invention
continually to find out some means by which he could have it without its appearing singular
and entailing subsequent embarrassment. As for Maggie, she had no distinct thought, only the
sense of a presence like that of a closely hovering broad-winged bird in the darkness, for
she was unable to look up, and saw nothing but Minny's black wavy coat.

But this must end some time, perhaps it ended very soon, and only seemed long, as a minute's
dream does. Stephen at last sat upright sideways in his chair, leaning one hand and arm over
the back and looking at Maggie. What should he say?

"We shall have a splendid sunset, I think; sha'n't you go out and see it?"

"I don't know," said Maggie. Then courageously raising her eyes and looking out of the window,
"if I'm not playing cribbage with my uncle."

A pause; during which Minny is stroked again, but has sufficient insight not to be grateful
for it, to growl rather.

"Do you like sitting alone?"

A rather arch look came over Maggie's face, and, just glancing at Stephen, she said, "Would
it be quite civil to say've s'?"

"It was rather a dangerous question for an intruder to ask," said Stephen, delighted with that
glance, and getting determined to stay for another. "But you will have more than half an hour
to yourself after I am gone," he added, taking out his watch. "I know Mr. Deane never comes
in till half-past seven."

Another pause, during which Maggie looked steadily out of the window, till by a great effort
she moved her head to look down at Minny's back again, and said,--

"I wish Lucy had not been obliged to go out. We lose our music."

"We shall have a new voice to-morrow night," said Stephen. "Will you tell your cousin that
our friend Philip Wakem is come back? I saw him as I went home."

Maggie gave a little start,--it seemed hardly more than a vibration that passed from head to
foot in an instant. But the new images summoned by Philip's name dispersed half the oppressive
spell she had been under. She rose from her chair with a sudden resolution, and laying Minny
on his cushion, went to reach Lucy's large work-basket from its corner. Stephen was vexed and
disappointed; he thought perhaps Maggie didn't like the name of Wakem to be mentioned to her
in that abrupt way, for he now recalled what Lucy had told him of the family quarrel. It was
of no use to stay any longer. Maggie was seating herself at the table with her work, and looking
chill and proud; and he--he looked like a simpleton for having come. A gratuitous, entirely
superfluous visit of that sort was sure to make a man disagreeable and ridiculous. Of course
it was palpable to Maggie's thinking that he had dined hastily in his own room for the sake
of setting off again and finding her alone.

A boyish state of mind for an accomplished young gentleman of five-and-twenty, not without
legal knowledge! But a reference to history, perhaps, may make it not incredible.

At this moment Maggie's ball of knitting-wool rolled along the ground, and she started up to
reach it. Stephen rose too, and picking up the ball, met her with a vexed, complaining look
that gave his eyes quite a new expression to Maggie, whose own eyes met them as he presented
the ball to her.

"Good-bye," said Stephen, in a tone that had the same beseeching discontent as his eyes. He
dared not put out his hand; he thrust both hands into his tail-pockets as he spoke. Maggie
thought she had perhaps been rude.

"Won't you stay?" she said timidly, not looking away, for that would have seemed rude again.

"No, thank you," said Stephen, looking still into the half-unwilling, half-fascinated eyes,
as a thirsty man looks toward the track of the distant brook. "The boat is waiting for me.
You'll tell your cousin?"

"Yes."

"That I brought the music, I mean?"

"Yes."

"And that Philip is come back?"

"Yes." (Maggie did not notice Philip's name this time.)

"Won't you come out a little way into the garden?" said Stephen, in a still gentler tone; but
the next moment he was vexed that she did not say "No," for she moved away now toward the open
window, and he was obliged to take his hat and walk by her side. But he thought of something
to make him amends.

"Do take my arm," he said, in a low tone, as if it were a secret.

There is something strangely winning to most women in that offer of the firm arm; the help
is not wanted physically at that moment, but the sense of help, the presence of strength that
is outside them and yet theirs, meets a continual want of the imagination. Either on that ground
or some other, Maggie took the arm. And they walked together round the grassplot and under
the drooping green of the laburnums, in the same dim, dreamy state as they had been in a quarter
of an hour before; only that Stephen had had the look he longed for, without yet perceiving
in himself the symptoms of returning reasonableness, and Maggie had darting thoughts across
the dimness,--how came he to be there? Why had she come out? Not a word was spoken. If it had
been, each would have been less intensely conscious of the other.

"Take care of this step," said Stephen at last.

"Oh, I will go in now," said Maggie, feeling that the step had come like a rescue. "Good-evening."

In an instant she had withdrawn her arm, and was running back to the house. She did not reflect
that this sudden action would only add to the embarrassing recollections of the last half-hour.
She had no thought left for that. She only threw herself into the low arm-chair, and burst
into tears.

"Oh, Philip, Philip, I wish we were together again--so quietly--in the Red Deeps."

Stephen looked after her a moment, then went on to the boat, and was soon landed at the wharf.
He spent the evening in the billiard-room, smoking one cigar after another, and losing "lives"
at pool. But he would not leave off. He was determined not to think,--not to admit any more
distinct remembrance than was urged upon him by the perpetual presence of Maggie. He was looking
at her, and she was on his arm.

But there came the necessity of walking home in the cool starlight, and with it the necessity
of cursing his own folly, and bitterly determining that he would never trust himself alone
with Maggie again. It was all madness; he was in love, thoroughly attached to Lucy, and engaged,--engaged
as strongly as an honorable man need be. He wished he had never seen this Maggie Tulliver,
to be thrown into a fever by her in this way; she would make a sweet, strange, troublesome,
adorable wife to some man or other, but he would never have chosen her himself. Did she feel
as he did? He hoped she did--not. He ought not to have gone. He would master himself in future.
He would make himself disagreeable to her, quarrel with her perhaps. Quarrel with her? Was
it possible to quarrel with a creature who had such eyes,--defying and deprecating, contradicting
and clinging, imperious and beseeching,-- full of delicious opposites? To see such a creature
subdued by love for one would be a lot worth having--to another man.

There was a muttered exclamation which ended this inward soliloquy, as Stephen threw away the
end of his last cigar, and thrusting his hands into his pockets, stalked along at a quieter
pace through the shrubbery. It was not of a benedictory kind.

Chapter VII

Philip Re-enters

The next morning was very wet,--the sort of morning on which male neighbors who have no imperative
occupation at home are likely to pay their fair friends an illimitable visit. The rain, which
has been endurable enough for the walk or ride one way, is sure to become so heavy, and at
the same time so certain to clear up by and by, that nothing but an open quarrel can abbreviate
the visit; latent detestation will not do at all. And if people happen to be lovers, what can
be so delightful, in England, as a rainy morning? English sunshine is dubious; bonnets are
never quite secure; and if you sit down on the grass, it may lead to catarrhs. But the rain
is to be depended on. You gallop through it in a mackintosh, and presently find yourself in
the seat you like best,--a little above or a little below the one on which your goddess sits
(it is the same thing to the metaphysical mind, and that is the reason why women are at once
worshipped and looked down upon), with a satisfactory confidence that there will be no lady-callers.

"Stephen will come earlier this morning, I know," said Lucy; "he always does when it's rainy."

Maggie made no answer. She was angry with Stephen; she began to think she should dislike him;
and if it had not been for the rain, she would have gone to her aunt Glegg's this morning,
and so have avoided him altogether. As it was, she must find some reason for remaining out
of the room with her mother.

But Stephen did not come earlier, and there was another visitor--a nearer neighbor--who preceded
him. When Philip entered the room, he was going merely to bow to Maggie, feeling that their
acquaintance was a secret which he was bound not to betray; but when she advanced toward him
and put out her hand, he guessed at once that Lucy had been taken into her confidence. It was
a moment of some agitation to both, though Philip had spent many hours in preparing for it;
but like all persons who have passed through life with little expectation of sympathy, he seldom
lost his self-control, and shrank with the most sensitive pride from any noticeable betrayal
of emotion. A little extra paleness, a little tension of the nostril when he spoke, and the
voice pitched in rather a higher key, that to strangers would seem expressive of cold indifference,
were all the signs Philip usually gave of an inward drama that was not without its fierceness.
But Maggie, who had little more power of concealing the impressions made upon her than if she
had been constructed of musical strings, felt her eyes getting larger with tears as they took
each other's hands in silence. They were not painful tears; they had rather something of the
same origin as the tears women and children shed when they have found some protection to cling
to and look back on the threatened danger. For Philip, who a little while ago was associated
continually in Maggie's mind with the sense that Tom might reproach her with some justice,
had now, in this short space, become a sort of outward conscience to her, that she might fly
to for rescue and strength. Her tranquil, tender affection for Philip, with its root deep down
in her childhood, and its memories of long quiet talk confirming by distinct successive impressions
the first instinctive bias,--the fact that in him the appeal was more strongly to her pity
and womanly devotedness than to her vanity or other egoistic excitability of her nature,--seemed
now to make a sort of sacred place, a sanctuary where she could find refuge from an alluring
influence which the best part of herself must resist; which must bring horrible tumult within,
wretchedness without. This new sense of her relation to Philip nullified the anxious scruples
she would otherwise have felt, lest she should overstep the limit of intercourse with him that
Tom would sanction; and she put out her hand to him, and felt the tears in her eyes without
any consciousness of an inward check. The scene was just what Lucy expected, and her kind heart
delighted in bringing Philip and Maggie together again; though, even with all her regard for
Philip, she could not resist the impression that her cousin Tom had some excuse for feeling
shocked at the physical incongruity between the two,--a prosaic person like cousin Tom, who
didn't like poetry and fairy tales. But she began to speak as soon as possible, to set them
at ease.

"This was very good and virtuous of you," she said, in her pretty treble, like the low conversational
notes of little birds, "to come so soon after your arrival. And as it is, I think I will pardon
you for running away in an inopportune manner, and giving your friends no notice. Come and
sit down here," she went on, placing the chair that would suit him best, "and you shall find
yourself treated mercifully."

"You will never govern well, Miss Deane," said Philip, as he seated himself, "because no one
will ever believe in your severity. People will always encourage themselves in misdemeanors
by the certainty that you will be indulgent."

Lucy gave some playful contradiction, but Philip did not hear what it was, for he had naturally
turned toward Maggie, and she was looking at him with that open, affectionate scrutiny which
we give to a friend from whom we have been long separated. What truth, what picture can be painted
and impressed, where the pupils of the eyes are dispersed in water, the water into steam, the
steam into flame, the flame into air, and this in other and other without end: the subject
of sense and cognition turns for ever upon the wheel of mutation?

MIN. Movement is change, and that which is changeable works and operates ever differently, because
the conception and affection follow the reason and condition of the
subject; and he who sees other and other different and differently
must necessarily be blind as regards that beauty which is one and
alone and is the same unity and entity.

SEV. So it is.

The seventh, contained allegorically in the sentiment of the seventh blind man, is the result
of the fire of the affections, whence some become impotent and incapable
of comprehending the truth, by making the affection precede the intellect.

There are those who love before they understand: whence it happens that all things appear to
them according to the colour of their affections, whereas he who would understand the truth
by means of contemplation, ought to be perfectly pure in thought.

MIN.

SEV. That is to say, that the affections are very powerful in hindering the comprehension of the
Truth, notwithstanding that the person may not himself perceive it; just as it happens to a
stupid invalid who does not say that his mouth is bittered but that the food is bitter. Now that
kind of blindness is expressed by him whose eyes are changed and deprived of their natural powers,
by that which the heart has given and imprinted upon it, powerful
not only to change the sense, but besides that, all the faculties
of the soul as the present image shows.

According to the meaning of the eighth, the high intelligible object
has blinded the intellect, as the high superposed sensible has corrupted
the senses.

Thus it would happen to him who should see Jove in his majesty, he
would lose his life and in consequence his senses.

As he who looks aloft sometimes is overcome by the majesty.[AG] Besides, when he comes to
penetrate the Divine species, he passes it like a ray.

Whence say the theologians that the Divine word is more penetrating than sharp point of sword
or knife. Hence is derived the form and impression of His own footstep, upon which nothing
else can be imprinted and sealed.

Therefore, that form being there confirmed and the new strange one
not being able to take its place unless the other yields, consequently
he can say, that he has no power of taking any other, if there is
one who replaces it or scatters it through the necessary want of proportion.

The ninth reason is exemplified, by the ninth who is blind through want of confidence, through
dejection of spirit, the which is caused and brought about also by a great love which He fears
to offend by His temerity. Whence says the Psalm: "Averte oculos
tuos a me, quia ipsi me avolare fecere."

And so he suppresses his eyes so as not to see that which most of all he desires, as he keeps his tongue
from talking with whom he most wishes to speak, from fear that a
defective look or word should humiliate him or bring him in some way
into misfortune.

And this generally proceeds from the apprehension of the excellence of the object above its
potential faculty: whence the most profound and divine theologians
say, that God is more honoured and loved by silence than by words;
as one sees more by shutting the eyes to the species represented,
than by opening them, therefore the negative theology of Pythagoras
and Dionysius is more celebrated than the demonstrative theology of
Aristotle and the scholastic doctors.

[AG]

... Gaze, as thy lips have said, On God Eternal, Very God! See me, see what thou prayest!

* * * * *

O Eyes of God! O Head! My strength of soul is fled. Gone is heart's force, rebuked is mind's desire!
When I behold Thee so, With awful brows a-glow, With burning glance,
and lips lighted by fire, Fierce as those flames which shall Consume,
at close of all, Earth, Heaven!

* * * * *

God is it I did see, This unknown marvel of Thy Form! but fear Mingles with joy! Retake, Dear
Lord! for pity's sake, Thine earthly shape, which earthly eyes may bear! --("The Song Celestial.")
(Sir Edwin Arnold's translation.)

MIN. Let us go; and we will reason by the way.

SEV. As you please.

=Fifth Dialogue=.

Interlocutors:

LAODOMIA. GIULIA.

LAO. Some other time, oh my sister, thou wilt hear what happened to those nine blind men, who
were at first nine most beautiful and amorous youths, who being so inspired by the loveliness
of your face, and having no hope of receiving the reward of their
love, and fearing that such despair would reduce them to final ruin,
went away from the happy Campanian country, and of one accord, those
who at first were rivals for your beauty, swore not to separate until
they had tried in all possible ways to find something more beautiful
than you or at least equal to you; besides which, that they might
discover that mercy and pity which they could not find in your breast
armed with pride; for they believed this was the only remedy which
could bring them out of that cruel captivity.

The third day after their solemn departure, as they were passing by the Circean mount, it pleased
them to go and see those antiquities, the cave and fane of that goddess.

When they were come there, the majesty of the solitary place, the high, storm-beaten rocks, the
murmur of the sea waves which break amongst those caves, and many other circumstances of the locality
and the season combined, made them feel inspired; and one of them I will tell thee, more bold
than the others, spoke these words: "Oh might it please heaven that
in these days, as in the past more happy ages, some wise Circe might
make herself present who, with plants and minerals working her incantations,
would be able to curb nature.

I should believe that she, however proud, would surely be pitiful unto our woes. She, solicited
by our supplications and laments, would condescend either to give a remedy or to concede a grateful
vengeance for the cruelty of our enemy."

Hardly had he finished uttering these words than there became visible to them a palace, which, whoever
had knowledge of human things, could easily comprehend that it was
not the work of man, nor of nature; the form and manner of it I will
explain to thee another time.

Whence, filled with great wonder and touched by hope that some propitious deity, who must have
placed this before them, would explain their condition and fortunes,
they said with one accord they could meet with nothing worse than
death, which they considered a less evil than to live in so much anguish.

Therefore they entered, not finding any door that was shut against them nor janitor who questioned
them. They found themselves in a very richly ornamented room, where with royal majesty, (as one
may say, Apollo was found again by Phaeton;) appears she, who is called his daughter, and
at whose appearance they saw vanish all the figures of many other deities who ministered unto
her. Then, received and comforted by this gracious face, they advanced, and overcome by the splendour
of that majesty, they bent their knee to the earth, and altogether,
with the diversity of tones which their various genius suggested,
they laid open their vows to the goddess.

By her finally, they were treated in such a manner that, blind and homeless, with great labour
having ploughed the seas, passed over rivers, overcome mountains, traversed plains for the space
of ten years, and at the end of which time having arrived under that
temperate sky of the British Isles, and come into the presence of
the lovely, graceful nymphs of Father Thames, they (the nine), having
made humble obeisance, and the nymphs having received them with acts
of purest courtesy, one, the principal amongst them, who later on
will be named, with tragic and lamenting accents laid bare the common
cause in this manner:

Of those, oh gentle Dames, who with closed
urn, Present themselves, whose hearts are pierced Not for a fault
by nature caused, But through a cruel fate, That in a living death,
Does hold them fast, we each and all are blind.

Nine spirits are we, wandering many years, Longing to know; and many lands O'ertravelled, one
day were surprised By a sore accident, To which if you attend, You'll say, oh worthy, oh unhappy
lovers!

An impious Circe, who presumes to boast Of having for her sire this glorious sun, Welcomed us
after many wanderings: Opened a certain urn, With water sprinkled us, And to the sprinkling added
an enchantment.

Waiting the finish of this work of hers We all were quiet, mute, attent, Until she said, "Oh
ye unhappy ones, Blind be ye all, Gather that fruit Those get who fix their thoughts on things
above."

Daughter and Mother of horror and darkness and woe They cried, who sudden were struck blind, It pleased
you then, so proud and harsh, To treat these wretched lovers, Who
put themselves before you, Ready to consecrate to you their hearts.

But when the sudden fury somewhat stayed, Which this new case had brought on them, Each one within
himself withdrew, While rage to grief gave place; To her they turned for pity, With chosen words
companioning their tears.

Now if it please thee, gracious sorceress, If zeal for glory chance to move thy heart, Or milk of
kindness soften it, Be merciful to us, And with thy magic herbs, Heal up the wound imprinted
on our hearts.

If wish to succour rules thy beauteous hand, Make no delay, lest some
of us Unhappy ones reach death, ere we Praising thy act Can each one
say, So much did she torment, yet more did heal.

Then she replied: Oh curious prying minds, Take this my other fatal
urn, Which my own hand may not unclose; Over the wide expanse of earth,
Wander ye still, Search for and visit all the various kingdoms.

Fate hath decreed, it ne'er shall be unclosed Till lofty wisdom, noble
chastity And loveliness with these combined, Shall set their hands
to it; All other efforts vain, To make this fluid open to the sky.

Then should it chance to sprinkle beauteous hands, Of those who come anear for remedy, Its
god-like virtues you may prove, And turning cruel pain Into a sweet
content, Two lovely stars upon the earth you'll see.

Meanwhile be none of you cast down or sad, Although long while in deep obscurity All that the heavens
contain remain concealed, For good so great as this, No pain, however sharp, Can be accounted
worthy of the cost.

That Good to which through blindness you are led, Should make appear all other-having, vile, And every
torment be as pleasure held, Who, hoping to behold Graces unique and rare, May hold in high
disdain all other lights.

Ah, weary ones! Too long, too long our limbs Have wandered o'er the terrene globe, So that
to us it seems As if the shrewd wild beast, With false and flattering hopes, Our bosoms has
encumbered with her wiles.

Wretched henceforth, we see, though late, the witch Concerned to keep us all with promises (And
for our greater hurt), at bay; For surely she believes No woman can
be found Beneath the roof of heaven so dowered as she.

Now that we know that every hope is vain, We yield to destiny and are content, Nor will withdraw
from all our strivings sore; And staying not our steps, Though trembling,
tired and vexed, We languish through the days that yet are ours.

Oh graceful nymphs, that on the grassy banks Of gentle Thames do make your home, Do not disdain,
ye beauteous ones, To try, although in vain, With those white hands
of yours To uncover that which in our urn is hid.

Who knows? perchance it may be on these shores, Where, with the Nereids, may be seen The rapid torrent from below
ascend And wind again Back to its source, That heaven has destined there she shall be found.

One
of the nymphs took the urn in her hand, and without trying to do more offered it to one at a
time, but not one was found who dared to be the first to try (to
open it), but all by common consent, after simply looking at it, referred
and proposed it with respect and reverence to one alone; who, finally,
not so much to exhibit her own glory as to succour those unhappy ones,
and while in a sort of doubt, the urn opened as it were spontaneously
of itself.

But what shall I say to you of the applause of the nymphs? How can you imagine that I can express
the extreme joy of the nine blind men, when, hearing that the urn was open, they felt themselves
sprinkled with the desired waters, they opened their eyes and saw the two suns, and felt they
had gained a double happiness; one, the having recovered the light they had lost, the other
that of the newly discovered light which alone could show them the image of the highest good
upon earth. How, I say, can you expect me to describe the joy and exulting merriment of voices
of spirit and of body which they themselves all together could not express? For a time it was
like seeing so many furious bacchanals, inebriated with that which they saw so plainly, until
at last, the impetus of their fury being somewhat calmed, they put themselves in a row.

73.

The first played the guitar and sang the following:

Oh cliffs, oh deeps, oh thorns, oh snags, oh stones, Oh mounts, oh plains, oh valleys, rivers,
seas, How dear and sweet you show yourselves, For by your aid and favour, To us the sky's
unveiled.

  The fourth with the viola sang:

And
  pierced anon with such a light as this; Blindness worth more than
every other sight, Pains sweeter far than other pleasures are, For
to the fairest light Thou art thyself a guide, Show to the soul all
lower things are null.

The fifth with the Spanish drum sang:

Showing the soul all lower things are null, Seasoning with hope the high thought of the mind,
Was one who pushed us to the only path, And so did show us plain, The fairest work of God, Thus
does a fate benign present itself.[AI]

[AI] The lonely sore-footed pilgrims on their way back to their home are never sure to the
last moment of not losing their way in this limitless desert of illusion and matter called Earth-life.--("The
Secret Doctrine.")

The sixth with a lute sang:

Thus does a fate benign present itself, Who wills not that to good, good should succeed, Or
pain forerunner be of pain, But turning round, the wheel, Now rising, now depressed, As day and
night succeed alternately.

The seventh with the Irish harp:

As day and night succeed alternately; While the great mantle of the lights of night, Blanches the
chariot of diurnal flames, As He who governs all, With everlasting laws, Puts down the high and
raises up the low.

The eighth with the violin:

Puts down the high and raises up the low, He who the infinite machine sustains, With swiftness,
with the medium or with slow, Apportioning the turning Of this gigantic mass, The hidden is unveiled
and open stands.

The ninth with the rebeck:

The hidden is unveiled and open stands, Therefore deny not, but admit the triumph, Incomparable
end of all the pains Of field and mount, Of pools and streams and seas, Of cliffs and deeps,
of thorns and snags and stones.

After each one in this way, singly, playing his instrument, had sung his sistine, they danced altogether
in a circle and sang together in praise of the one Nymph with the softest accents a song which
I am not sure whether I can call to memory.

GIU. I pray you, my sister, do not fail to let me hear so much of it as you can remember!

LAO.

Song of the Illuminati:

"I envy not, oh Jove, the firmament," Said Father Ocean, with the
haughty brow: "For that I am content With that which my own empire
gives to me."

Then answered Jove, "What arrogance is thine.

What to thy riches have been added now, Oh god of the mad waves,
To make thy foolish boasting rise so high?"

"Thou hast," said the sea-god, "in thy command, The flaming sky, where is the burning zone,
In which the heavenly host Of stars and planets stand within thy
sight.[AJ]

"Of these, the world looks most upon the sun, Which, let
me tell you, shineth not so bright, As she who makes of me, The god
most glorious of the mighty whole.

"And I contain within my bosom vast, With other lands, that, where the happy Thames Goes gliding
gaily on, Which has of graceful nymphs a lovely throng.

"There will be found 'mongst those where all are fair, Will make thee
lover more of sea than sky, Oh Jove, High Thunderer! Whose sun shines
pale beside the starry night."

Then answered Jove, "God of the billowy
sea! That one should ere be found more blest than I Fate nevermore
permits, My treasures with thine own run parallel.

"The sun is equal
to thy chiefest nymph, By virtue of the everlasting laws, And pauses
alternating, Amongst my stars she's equal to the sun."

[AJ] Plato
says that [Greek: Theos] is derived from the verb [Greek: Theein],
to move, to run, as the first astronomers who observed the motions
of the heavenly bodies called the planets [Greek: Theoi], the gods.--("The
Secret Doctrine," foot note, p. 2, vol. 1.)

I believe that I have
recalled it entirely.

GIU. You can see that no sentence is wanting
to the perfecting of the proposition, nor rhyme to the completion
of the stanzas. Now if I by the grace of heaven have received beauty,
a greater favour I consider is mine, in that whatever beauty I may
have had it has been in a certain way instrumental in causing that
Divine and only one to be found. I thank the gods, because in that
time, when I was so tender (verde), that the amorous flames could
not be lighted in my breast, by reason of my intractability, such
simple and innocent cruelty was used in order to yield more graces
to my lovers than otherwise it would have been possible for them to
obtain, through any kindness of mine however great.

LAO. As to the
souls of those lovers, I assure you that as they are not ungrateful
to the sorceress Circe for their blindness, grievous thoughts, and
bitter trials, by means of which they have reached so great a good,
so they can be no less grateful to thee.[AK]

GIU. So I desire and
hope. I think the line quoted is a single sentence, but I'm not sure.
The line begins: ["If the love of glory is dear to thy breast,]. Unchanged.

With this idea in her head, she resorted to her usual plan when she wanted to tell or ask her
father anything particular: she found a reason for her aunt Tulliver to leaving the dining-room
after dinner, and seated herself on a small stool at her father's knee. Mr. Deane, under those
circumstances, considered that he tasted some of the most agreeable moments his merits had
purchased him in life, notwithstanding that Lucy, disliking to have her hair powdered with
snuff, usually began by mastering his snuff-box on such occasions.

"You don't want to go to sleep yet, papa, do you?" she said, as she brought up her stool and
opened the large fingers that clutched the snuff-box.

"Not yet," said Mr. Deane, glancing at the reward of merit in the decanter. "But what do you
want?" he added, pinching the dimpled chin fondly,--"to coax some more sovereigns out of my
pocket for your bazaar? Eh?"

"No, I have no base motives at all to-day. I only want to talk, not to beg. I want to know
what made you ask Philip Wakem about his father's farming to-day, papa? It seemed rather odd,
because you never hardly say anything to him about his father; and why should you care about
Mr. Wakem's losing money by his hobby?"

"Something to do with business," said Mr. Deane, waving his hands, as if to repel intrusion
into that mystery.

"But, papa, you always say Mr. Wakem has brought Philip up like a girl; how came you to think
you should get any business knowledge out of him? Those abrupt questions sounded rather oddly.
Philip thought them queer."

"Nonsense, child!" said Mr. Deane, willing to justify his social demeanor, with which he had
taken some pains in his upward progress. "There's a report that Wakem's mill and farm on the
other side of the river--Dorlcote Mill, your uncle Tulliver's, you know--isn't answering so
well as it did. I wanted to see if your friend Philip would let anything out about his father's
being tired of farming."

"Why? Would you buy the mill, papa, if he would part with it?" said Lucy, eagerly. "Oh, tell
me everything; here, you shall have your snuff-box if you'll tell me. Because Maggie says all
their hearts are set on Tom's getting back the mill some time. It was one of the last things
her father said to Tom, that he must get back the mill."

"Hush, you little puss," said Mr. Deane, availing himself of the restored snuff-box. "You must
not say a word about this thing; do you hear? There's very little chance of their getting the
mill or of anybody's getting it out of Wakem's hands. And if he knew that we wanted it with
a view to the Tulliver's getting it again, he'd be the less likely to part with it. It's natural,
after what happened. He behaved well enough to Tulliver before; but a horsewhipping is not
likely to be paid for with sugar-plums."

"Now, papa," said Lucy, with a little air of solemnity, "will you trust me? You must not ask
me all my reasons for what I'm going to say, but I have very strong reasons. And I'm very cautious;
I am, indeed."

"Well, let us hear."

"Why, I believe, if you will let me take Philip Wakem into our confidence,--let me tell him
all about your wish to buy, and what it's for; that my cousins wish to have it, and why they
wish to have it,--I believe Philip would help to bring it about. I know he would desire to do it."

"I don't see how that can be, child," said Mr. Deane, looking puzzled. "Why should he care?"--then,
with a sudden penetrating look at his daughter, "You don't think the poor lad's fond of you,
and so you can make him do what you like?" (Mr. Deane felt quite safe about his daughter's
affections.)

"No, papa; he cares very little about me,--not so much as I care about him. But I have a reason
for being quite sure of what I say. Don't you ask me. And if you ever guess, don't tell me.
Only give me leave to do as I think fit about it."

Lucy rose from her stool to seat herself on her father's knee, and kissed him with that last
request.

"Are you sure you won't do mischief, now?" he said, looking at her with delight.

"Yes, papa, quite sure. I'm very wise; I've got all your business talents. Didn't you admire
my accompt-book, now, when I showed it you?"

"Well, well, if this youngster will keep his counsel, there won't be much harm done. And to
tell the truth, I think there's not much chance for us any other way. Now, let me go off to sleep."

Chapter VIII

Wakem in a New Light

Before three days had passed after the conversation you have just overheard between Lucy and
her father she had contrived to have a private interview with Philip during a visit of Maggie's
to her aunt Glegg. For a day and a night Philip turned over in his mind with restless agitation
all that Lucy had told him in that interview, till he had thoroughly resolved on a course of
action. He thought he saw before him now a possibility of altering his position with respect
to Maggie, and removing at least one obstacle between them. He laid his plan and calculated
all his moves with the fervid deliberation of a chess-player in the days of his first ardor,
and was amazed himself at his sudden genius as a tactician. His plan was as bold as it was
thoroughly calculated. Having watched for a moment when his father had nothing more urgent
on his hands than the newspaper, he went behind him, laid a hand on his shoulder, and said,--

"Father, will you come up into my sanctum, and look at my new sketches? I've arranged them now."

"I'm getting terrible stiff in the joints, Phil, for climbing those stairs of yours," said
Wakem, looking kindly at his son as he laid down his paper. "But come along, then."

"This is a nice place for you, isn't it, Phil?--a capital light that from the roof, eh?" was,
as usual, the first thing he said on entering the painting-room. He liked to remind himself
and his son too that his fatherly indulgence had provided the accommodation. He had been a
good father. Emily would have nothing to reproach him with there, if she came back again from
her grave.

"Come, come," he said, putting his double eye-glass over his nose, and seating himself to take
a general view while he rested, "you've got a famous show here. Upon my word, I don't see that
your things aren't as good as that London artist's--what's his name--that Leyburn gave so much
money for."

Philip shook his head and smiled. He had seated himself on his painting-stool, and had taken
a lead pencil in his hand, with which he was making strong marks to counteract the sense of
tremulousness. He watched his father get up, and walk slowly round, good-naturedly dwelling
on the pictures much longer than his amount of genuine taste for landscape would have prompted,
till he stopped before a stand on which two pictures were placed,--one much larger than the
other, the smaller one in a leather case.

"Bless me! what have you here?" said Wakem, startled by a sudden transition from landscape
to portrait. "I thought you'd left off figures. Who are these?"

"They are the same person," said Philip, with calm promptness, "at different ages."

"And what person?" said Wakem, sharply fixing his eyes with a growing look of suspicion on
the larger picture.

"Miss Tulliver. The small one is something like what she was when I was at school with her
brother at King's Lorton; the larger one is not quite so good a likeness of what she was when
I came from abroad."

Wakem turned round fiercely, with a flushed face, letting his eye-glass fall, and looking at
his son with a savage expression for a moment, as if he was ready to strike that daring feebleness
from the stool. But he threw himself into the armchair again, and thrust his hands into his
trouser-pockets, still looking angrily at his son, however. Philip did not return the look,
but sat quietly watching the point of his pencil.

"And do you mean to say, then, that you have had any acquaintance with her since you came from
abroad?" said Wakem, at last, with that vain effort which rage always makes to throw as much
punishment as it desires to inflict into words and tones, since blows are forbidden.

"Yes; I saw a great deal of her for a whole year before her father's death. We met often in
that thicket--the Red Deeps--near Dorlcote Mill. I love her dearly; I shall never love any
other woman. I have thought of her ever since she was a little girl."

"Go on, sir! And you have corresponded with her all this while?"

"No. I never told her I loved her till just before we parted, and she promised her brother
not to see me again or to correspond with me. I am not sure that she loves me or would consent
to marry me. But if she would consent,--if she did love me well enough,--I should marry her."

"And this is the return you make me for all the indulgences I've heaped on you?" said Wakem,
getting white, and beginning to tremble under an enraged sense of impotence before Philip's
calm defiance and concentration of purpose.

"No, father," said Philip, looking up at him for the first time; "I don't regard it as a return.
You have been an indulgent father to me; but I have always felt that it was because you had
an affectionate wish to give me as much happiness as my unfortunate lot would admit, not that
it was a debt you expected me to pay by sacrificing all my chances of happiness to satisfy
feelings of yours which I can never share."

"I think most sons would share their father's feelings in this case," said Wakem, bitterly.
"The girl's father was an ignorant mad brute, who was within an inch of murdering me. The whole
town knows it. And the brother is just as insolent, only in a cooler way. He forbade her seeing
you, you say; he'll break every bone in your body, for your greater happiness, if you don't
take care. But you seem to have made up your mind; you have counted the consequences, I suppose.
Of course you are independent of me; you can marry this girl to-morrow, if you like; you are
a man of five-and-twenty,--you can go your way, and I can go mine. We need have no more to
do with each other."

Wakem rose and walked toward the door, but something held him back, and instead of leaving
the room, he walked up and down it. Philip was slow to reply, and when he spoke, his tone had
a more incisive quietness and clearness than ever.

"No; I can't marry Miss Tulliver, even if she would have me, if I have only my own resources
to maintain her with. I have been brought up to no profession. I can't offer her poverty as
well as deformity."

"Ah, there is a reason for your clinging to me, doubtless," said Wakem, still bitterly, though
Philip's last words had given him a pang; they had stirred a feeling which had been a habit
for a quarter of a century. He threw himself into the chair again.

"I expected all this," said Philip. "I know these scenes are often happening between father
and son. If I were like other men of my age, I might answer your angry words by still angrier;
we might part; I should marry the woman I love, and have a chance of being as happy as the
rest. But if it will be a satisfaction to you to annihilate the very object of everything you've
done for me, you have an advantage over most fathers; you can completely deprive me of the
only thing that would make my life worth having."

Philip paused, but his father was silent.

"You know best what satisfaction you would have, beyond that of gratifying a ridiculous rancor
worthy only of wandering savages."

"Ridiculous rancor!" Wakem burst out. "What do you mean? Damn it! is a man to be horsewhipped
by a boor and love him for it? Besides, there's that cold, proud devil of a son, who said a
word to me I shall not forget when we had the settling. He would be as pleasant a mark for
a bullet as I know, if he were worth the expense."

"I don't mean your resentment toward them," said Philip, who had his reasons for some sympathy
with this view of Tom, "though a feeling of revenge is not worth much, that you should care
to keep it. I mean your extending the enmity to a helpless girl, who has too much sense and
goodness to share their narrow prejudices. She has never entered into the family quarrels."

"What does that signify? We don't ask what a woman does; we ask whom she belongs to. It's altogether
a degrading thing to you, to think of marrying old Tulliver's daughter."

For the first time in the dialogue, Philip lost some of his self-control, and colored with anger.

"Miss Tulliver," he said, with bitter incisiveness, "has the only grounds of rank that anything
but vulgar folly can suppose to belong to the middle class; she is thoroughly refined, and
her friends, whatever else they may be, are respected for irreproachable honor and integrity.
All St. Ogg's, I fancy, would pronounce her to be more than my equal."

Wakem darted a glance of fierce question at his son; but Philip was not looking at him, and
with a certain penitent consciousness went on, in a few moments, as if in amplification of
his last words,--

"Find a single person in St. Ogg's who will not tell you that a beautiful creature like her
would be throwing herself away on a pitiable object like me."

"Not she!" said Wakem, rising again, and forgetting everything else in a burst of resentful
pride, half fatherly, half personal. "It would be a deuced fine match for her. It's all stuff
about an accidental deformity, when a girl's really attached to a man."

"But girls are not apt to get attached under those circumstances," said Philip.

"Well, then," said Wakem, rather brutally, trying to recover his previous position, "if she
doesn't care for you, you might have spared yourself the trouble of talking to me about her,
and you might have spared me the trouble of refusing my consent to what was never likely to
happen."

Wakem strode to the door, and without looking round again, banged it after him.

Philip was not without confidence that his father would be ultimately wrought upon as he had
expected, by what had passed; but the scene had jarred upon his nerves, which were as sensitive
as a woman's. He determined not to go down to dinner; he couldn't meet his father again that
day. It was Wakem's habit, when he had no company at home, to go out in the evening, often
as early as half-past seven; and as it was far on in the afternoon now, Philip locked up his
room and went out for a long ramble, thinking he would not return until his father was out
of the house again. He got into a boat, and went down the river to a favorite village, where
he dined, and lingered till it was late enough for him to return. He had never had any sort
of quarrel with his father before, and had a sickening fear that this contest, just begun,
might go on for weeks; and what might not happen in that time? He would not allow himself to
define what that involuntary question meant. But if he could once be in the position of Maggie's
accepted, acknowledged lover, there would be less room for vague dread. He went up to his painting-room
again, and threw himself with a sense of fatigue into the armchair, looking round absently
at the views of water and rock that were ranged around, till he fell into a doze, in which
he fancied Maggie was slipping down a glistening, green, slimy channel of a waterfall, and
he was looking on helpless, till he was awakened by what seemed a sudden, awful crash.

It was the opening of the door, and he could hardly have dozen more than a few moments, for
there was no perceptible change in the evening light. It was his father who entered; and when
Philip moved to vacate the chair for him, he said,--

"Sit still. I'd rather walk about."

He stalked up and down the room once or twice, and then, standing opposite Philip with his
hands thrust in his side pockets, he said, as if continuing a conversation that had not been
broken off,--

"But this girl seems to have been fond of you, Phil, else she wouldn't have met you in that way."

Philip's heart was beating rapidly, and a transient flush passed over his face like a gleam.
It was not quite easy to speak at once.

"She liked me at King's Lorton, when she was a little girl, because I used to sit with her
brother a great deal when he had hurt his foot. She had kept that in her memory, and thought
of me as a friend of a long while ago. She didn't think of me as a lover when she met me."

"Well, but you made love to her at last. What did she say then?" said Wakem, walking about again.

"She said she did love me then."

"Confound it, then; what else do you want? Is she a jilt?"

"She was very young then," said Philip, hesitatingly. "I'm afraid she hardly knew what she
felt. I'm afraid our long separation, and the idea that events must always divide us, may have
made a difference."

"But she's in the town. I've seen her at church. Haven't you spoken to her since you came back?"

"Yes, at Mr. Deane's. But I couldn't renew my proposals to her on several grounds. One obstacle
would be removed if you would give your consent,--if you would be willing to think of her as
a daughter-in-law."

Wakem was silent a little while, pausing before Maggie's picture.

"She's not the sort of woman your mother was, though, Phil," he said, at last. "I saw her at
church,--she's handsomer than this,--deuced fine eyes and fine figure, I saw; but rather dangerous
and unmanageable, eh?"

"She's very tender and affectionate, and so simple,--without the airs and petty contrivances
other women have."

"Ah?" said Wakem. Then looking round at his son, "But your mother looked gentler; she had that
brown wavy hair and gray eyes, like yours. You can't remember her very well. It was a thousand
pities I'd no likeness of her."

"Then, shouldn't you be glad for me to have the same sort of happiness, father, to sweeten
my life for me? There can never be another tie so strong to you as that which began eight-and-twenty
years ago, when you married my mother, and you have been tightening it ever since."

"Ah, Phil, you're the only fellow that knows the best of me," said Wakem, giving his hand to
his son. "We must keep together if we can. And now, what am I to do? You must come downstairs
and tell me. Am I to go and call on this dark-eyed damsel?"

The barrier once thrown down in this way, Philip could talk freely to his father of their entire
relation with the Tullivers,--of the desire to get the mill and land back into the family,
and of its transfer to Guest & Co. as an intermediate step. He could venture now to be persuasive
and urgent, and his father yielded with more readiness than he had calculated on.

"I don't care about the mill," he said at last, with a sort of angry compliance. "I've had
an infernal deal of bother lately about the mill. Let them pay me for my improvements, that's
all. But there's one thing you needn't ask me. I shall have no direct transactions with young
Tulliver. If you like to swallow him for his sister's sake, you may; but I've no sauce that
will make him go down."

I leave you to imagine the agreeable feelings with which Philip went to Mr. Deane the next
day, to say that Mr. Wakem was ready to open the negotiations, and Lucy's pretty triumph as
she appealed to her father whether she had not proved her great business abilities. Mr. Deane
was rather puzzled, and suspected that there had been something "going on" among the young
people to which he wanted a clew. But to men of Mr. Deane's stamp, what goes on among the young
people is as extraneous to the real business of life as what goes on among the birds and butterflies,
until it can be shown to have a malign bearing on monetary affairs. And in this case the bearing
appeared to be entirely propitious.

Chapter IX

Charity in Full-Dress

The culmination of Maggie's career as an admired member of society in St. Ogg's was certainly
the day of the bazaar, when her simple noble beauty, clad in a white muslin of some soft-floating
kind, which I suspect must have come from the stores of aunt Pullet's wardrobe, appeared with
marked distinction among the more adorned and conventional women around her. We perhaps never
detect how much of our social demeanor is made up of artificial airs until we see a person
who is at once beautiful and simple; without the beauty, we are apt to call simplicity awkwardness.
The Miss Guests were much too well-bred to have any of the grimaces and affected tones that
belong to pretentious vulgarity; but their stall being next to the one where Maggie sat, it
seemed newly obvious to-day that Miss Guest held her chin too high, and that Miss Laura spoke
and moved continually with a view to effect.

All well-dressed St. Ogg's and its neighborhood were there; and it would have been worth while
to come even from a distance, to see the fine old hall, with its open roof and carved oaken
rafters, and great oaken folding-doors, and light shed down from a height on the many-colored
show beneath; a very quaint place, with broad faded stripes painted on the walls, and here
and there a show of heraldic animals of a bristly, long-snouted character, the cherished emblems
of a noble family once the seigniors of this now civic hall. A grand arch, cut in the upper
wall at one end, surmounted an oaken orchestra, with an open room behind it, where hothouse
plants and stalls for refreshments were disposed; an agreeable resort for gentlemen disposed
to loiter, and yet to exchange the occasional crush down below for a more commodious point
of view. In fact, the perfect fitness of this ancient building for an admirable modern purpose,
that made charity truly elegant, and led through vanity up to the supply of a deficit, was
so striking that hardly a person entered the room without exchanging the remark more than once.
Near the great arch over the orchestra was the stone oriel with painted glass, which was one
of the venerable inconsistencies of the old hall; and it was close by this that Lucy had her
stall, for the convenience of certain large plain articles which she had taken charge of for
Mrs. Kenn. Maggie had begged to sit at the open end of the stall, and to have the sale of these
articles rather than of bead-mats and other elaborate products of which she had but a dim understanding.
But it soon appeared that the gentlemen's dressing-gowns, which were among her commodities,
were objects of such general attention and inquiry, and excited so troublesome a curiosity
as to their lining and comparative merits, together with a determination to test them by trying
on, as to make her post a very conspicuous one. The ladies who had commodities of their own
to sell, and did not want dressing-gowns, saw at once the frivolity and bad taste of this masculine
preference for goods which any tailor could furnish; and it is possible that the emphatic notice
of various kinds which was drawn toward Miss Tulliver on this public occasion, threw a very
strong and unmistakable light on her subsequent conduct in many minds then present. Not that
anger, on account of spurned beauty can dwell in the celestial breasts of charitable ladies,
but rather that the errors of persons who have once been much admired necessarily take a deeper
tinge from the mere force of contrast; and also, that to-day Maggie's conspicuous position,
for the first time, made evident certain characteristics which were subsequently felt to have
an explanatory bearing. There was something rather bold in Miss Tulliver's direct gaze, and
something undefinably coarse in the style of her beauty, which placed her, in the opinion of
all feminine judges, far below her cousin Miss Deane; for the ladies of St. Ogg's had now completely
ceded to Lucy their hypothetic claims on the admiration of Mr. Stephen Guest.

As for dear little Lucy herself, her late benevolent triumph about the Mill, and all the affectionate
projects she was cherishing for Maggie and Philip, helped to give her the highest spirits to-day,
and she felt nothing but pleasure in the evidence of Maggie's attractiveness. It is true, she
was looking very charming herself, and Stephen was paying her the utmost attention on this
public occasion; jealously buying up the articles he had seen under her fingers in the process
of making, and gayly helping her to cajole the male customers into the purchase of the most
effeminate futilities. He chose to lay aside his hat and wear a scarlet fez of her embroidering;
but by superficial observers this was necessarily liable to be interpreted less as a compliment
to Lucy than as a mark of coxcombry. "Guest is a great coxcomb," young Torry observed; "but
then he is a privileged person in St. Ogg's--he carries all before him; if another fellow did
such things, everybody would say he made a fool of himself."

And Stephen purchased absolutely nothing from Maggie, until Lucy said, in rather a vexed undertone,--

"See, now; all the things of Maggie's knitting will be gone, and you will not have bought one.
There are those deliciously soft warm things for the wrists,--do buy them."

"Oh no," said Stephen, "they must be intended for imaginative persons, who can chill themselves
on this warm day by thinking of the frosty Caucasus. Stern reason is my forte, you know. You
must get Philip to buy those. By the way, why doesn't he come?"

"He never likes going where there are many people, though I enjoined him to come. He said he
would buy up any of my goods that the rest of the world rejected. But now, do go and buy something
of Maggie."

"No, no; see, she has got a customer; there is old Wakem himself just coming up."

Lucy's eyes turned with anxious interest toward Maggie to see how she went through this first
interview, since a sadly memorable time, with a man toward whom she must have so strange a
mixture of feelings; but she was pleased to notice that Wakem had tact enough to enter at once
into talk about the bazaar wares, and appear interested in purchasing, smiling now and then
kindly at Maggie, and not calling on her to speak much, as if he observed that she was rather
pale and tremulous.

"Why, Wakem is making himself particularly amiable to your cousin," said Stephen, in an undertone
to Lucy; "is it pure magnanimity? You talked of a family quarrel."

"Oh, that will soon be quite healed, I hope," said Lucy, becoming a little indiscreet in her
satisfaction, and speaking with an air of significance. But Stephen did not appear to notice
this, and as some lady-purchasers came up, he lounged on toward Maggie's end, handling trifles
and standing aloof until Wakem, who had taken out his purse, had finished his t transactions.

"My son came with me," he overheard Wakem saying, "but he has vanished into some other part
of the building, and has left all these charitable gallantries to me. I hope you'll reproach
him for his shabby conduct."

She returned his smile and bow without speaking, and he turned away, only then observing Stephen
and nodding to him. Maggie, conscious that Stephen was still there, busied herself with counting
money, and avoided looking up. She had been well pleased that he had devoted himself to Lucy
to-day, and had not come near her. They had begun the morning with an indifferent salutation,
and both had rejoiced in being aloof from each other, like a patient who has actually done
without his opium, in spite of former failures in resolution. And during the last few days
they had even been making up their minds to failures, looking to the outward events that must
soon come to separate them, as a reason for dispensing with self-conquest in detail.

Stephen moved step by step as if he were being unwillingly dragged, until he had got round
the open end of the stall, and was half hidden by a screen of draperies. Maggie went on counting
her money till she suddenly heard a deep gentle voice saying, "Aren't you very tried? Do let
me bring you something,--some fruit or jelly, mayn't I?"

The unexpected tones shook her like a sudden accidental vibration of a harp close by her.

"Oh no, thank you," she said faintly, and only half looking up for an instant.

"You look so pale," Stephen insisted, in a more entreating tone. "I'm sure you're exhausted.
I must disobey you, and bring something."

"No, indeed, I couldn't take it."

"Are you angry with me? What have I done? Do look at me."

"Pray, go away," said Maggie, looking at him helplessly, her eyes glancing immediately from
him to the opposite corner of the orchestra, which was half hidden by the folds of the old
faded green curtain. Maggie had no sooner uttered this entreaty than she was wretched at the
admission it implied; but Stephen turned away at once, and following her upward glance, he
saw Philip Wakem sealed in the half-hidden corner, so that he could command little more than
that angle of the hall in which Maggie sat. An entirely new though occurred to Stephen, and
linking itself with what he had observed of Wakem's manner, and with Lucy's reply to his observation,
it convinced him that there had been some former relation between Philip and Maggie beyond
that childish one of which he had heard. More than one impulse made him immediately leave the
hall and go upstairs to the refreshment-room, where, walking up to Philip, he sat down behind
him, and put his hand on his shoulder.

"Are you studying for a portrait, Phil," he said, "or for a sketch of that oriel window? By
George, it makes a capital bit from this dark corner, with the curtain just marking it off."

"I have been studying expression," said Philip, curtly.

"What! Miss Tulliver's? It's rather of the savage-moody order to-day, I think,--something of
the fallen princess serving behind a counter. Her cousin sent me to her with a civil offer
to get her some refreshment, but I have been snubbed, as usual. There's natural antipathy between
us, I suppose; I have seldom the honor to please her."

"What a hypocrite you are!" said Philip, flushing angrily.

"What! because experience must have told me that I'm universally pleasing? I admit the law,
but there's some disturbing force here."

"I am going," said Philip, rising abruptly.

"So am I--to get a breath of fresh air; this place gets oppressive. I think I have done suit
and service long enough."

The two friends walked downstairs together without speaking. Philip turned through the outer
door into the court-yard; but Stephen, saying, "Oh, by the by, I must call in here," went on
along the passage to one of the rooms at the other end of the building, which were appropriated
to the town library. He had the room all to himself, and a man requires nothing less than this
when he wants to dash his cap on the table, throw himself astride a chair, and stare at a high
brick wall with a frown which would not have been beneath the occasion if he had been slaying
"the giant Python." The conduct that issues from a moral conflict has often so close a resemblance
to vice that the distinction escapes all outward judgments founded on a mere comparison of
actions. It is clear to you, I hope, that Stephen was not a hypocrite,--capable of deliberate
doubleness for a selfish end; and yet his fluctuations between the indulgence of a feeling
and the systematic concealment of it might have made a good case in support of Philip's accusation.

Meanwhile, Maggie sat at her stall cold and trembling, with that painful sensation in the eyes
which comes from resolutely repressed tears. Was her life to be always like this,--always bringing
some new source of inward strife? She heard confusedly the busy, indifferent voices around
her, and wished her mind could flow into that easy babbling current. It was at this moment
that Dr. Kenn, who had quite lately come into the hall, and was now walking down the middle
with his hands behind him, taking a general view, fixed his eyes on Maggie for the first time,
and was struck with the expression of pain on her beautiful face. She was sitting quite still,
for the stream of customers had lessened at this late hour in the afternoon; the gentlemen
had chiefly chosen the middle of the day, and Maggie's stall was looking rather bare. This,
with her absent, pained expression, finished the contrast between her and her companions, who
were all bright, eager, and busy. He was strongly arrested. Her face had naturally drawn his
attention as a new and striking one at church, and he had been introduced to her during a short
call on business at Mr. Deane's, but he had never spoken more than three words to her. He walked
toward her now, and Maggie, perceiving some one approaching, roused herself to look up and
be prepared to speak. She felt a childlike, instinctive relief from the sense of uneasiness
in this exertion, when she saw it was Dr. Kenn's face that was looking at her; that plain,
middle-aged face, with a grave, penetrating kindness in it, seeming to tell of a human being
who had reached a firm, safe strand, but was looking with helpful pity toward the strugglers
still tossed by the waves, had an effect on Maggie at this moment which was afterward remembered
by her as if it had been a promise. The middle-aged, who have lived through their strongest
emotions, but are yet in the time when memory is still half passionate and not merely contemplative,
should surely be a sort of natural priesthood, whom life has disciplined and consecrated to
be the refuge and rescue of early stumblers and victims of self-despair. Most of us, at some
moment in our young lives, would have welcomed a priest of that natural order in any sort of
canonicals or uncanonicals, but had to scramble upward into all the difficulties of nineteen
entirely without such aid, as Maggie did.

"You find your office rather a fatiguing one, I fear, Miss Tulliver," said Dr. Kenn.

"It is, rather," said Maggie, simply, not being accustomed to simpler amiable denials of obvious
facts.

"But I can tell Mrs. Kenn that you have disposed of her goods very quickly," he added; "she
will be very much obliged to you."

"Oh, I have done nothing; the gentlemen came very fast to buy the dressing-gowns and embroidered
waistcoats, but I think any of the other ladies would have sold more; I didn't know what to
say about them."

Dr. Kenn smiled. "I hope I'm going to have you as a permanent parishioner now, Miss Tulliver;
am I? You have been at a distance from us hitherto."

"I have been a teacher in a school, and I'm going into another situation of the same kind very
soon."

"Ah? I was hoping you would remain among your friends, who are all in this neighborhood, I
believe."

"Oh, I must go," said Maggie, earnestly, looking at Dr. Kenn with an expression of reliance,
as if she had told him her history in those three words. It was one of those moments of implicit
revelation which will sometimes happen even between people who meet quite transiently,--on
a mile's journey, perhaps, or when resting by the wayside. There is always this possibility
of a word or look from a stranger to keep alive the sense of human brotherhood.

Dr. Kenn's ear and eye took in all the signs that this brief confidence of Maggie's was charged
with meaning.

"I understand," he said; "you feel it right to go. But that will not prevent our meeting again,
I hope; it will not prevent my knowing you better, if I can be of any service to you."

He put out his hand and pressed hers kindly before he turned away.

"She has some trouble or other at heart," he thought. "Poor child! she looks as if she might
turn out to be one of

  'The souls by nature pitched too high,
  By suffering plunged too low.'

"There's something wonderfully honest in those beautiful eyes."

It may be surprising that Maggie, among whose many imperfections an excessive delight in admiration
and acknowledged supremacy were not absent now, any more than when she was instructing the
gypsies with a view toward achieving a royal position among them, was not more elated on a
day when she had had the tribute of so many looks and smiles, together with that satisfactory
consciousness which had necessarily come from being taken before Lucy's chevalglass, and made
to look at the full length of her tall beauty, crowned by the night of her massy hair. Maggie
had smiled at herself then, and for the moment had forgotten everything in the sense of her
own beauty. If that state of mind could have lasted, her choice would have been to have Stephen
Guest at her feet, offering her a life filled with all luxuries, with daily incense of adoration
near and distant, and with all possibilities of culture at her command. But there were things
in her stronger than vanity,--passion and affection, and long, deep memories of early discipline
and effort, of early claims on her love and pity; and the stream of vanity was soon swept along
and mingled imperceptibly with that wider current which was at its highest force today, under
the double urgency of the events and inward impulses brought by the last week.

Philip had not spoken to her himself about the removal of obstacles between them on his father's
side,--he shrank from that; but he had told everything to Lucy, with the hope that Maggie,
being informed through her, might give him some encouraging sign that their being brought thus
much nearer to each other was a happiness to her. The rush of conflicting feelings was too
great for Maggie to say much when Lucy, with a face breathing playful joy, like one of Correggio's
cherubs, poured forth her triumphant revelation; and Lucy could hardly be surprised that she
could do little more than cry with gladness at the thought of her father's wish being fulfilled,
and of Tom's getting the Mill again in reward for all his hard striving. The details of preparation
for the bazaar had then come to usurp Lucy's attention for the next few days, and nothing had
been said by the cousins on subjects that were likely to rouse deeper feelings. Philip had
been to the house more than once, but Maggie had had no private conversation with him, and
thus she had been left to fight her inward battle without interference.

But when the bazaar was fairly ended, and the cousins were alone again, resting together at
home, Lucy said,--

"You must give up going to stay with your aunt Moss the day after to-morrow, Maggie; write
a note to her, and tell her you have put it off at my request, and I'll send the man with it.
She won't be displeased; you'll have plenty of time to go by-and-by; and I don't want you to
go out of the way just now."

"Yes, indeed I must go, dear; I can't put it off. I wouldn't leave aunt Gritty out for the
world. And I shall have very little time, for I'm going away to a new situation on the 25th
of June."

"Maggie!" said Lucy, almost white with astonishment.

"I didn't tell you, dear," said Maggie, making a great effort to command herself, "because
you've been so busy. But some time ago I wrote to our old governess, Miss Firniss, to ask her
to let me know if she met with any situation that I could fill, and the other day I had a letter
from her telling me that I could take three orphan pupils of hers to the coast during the holidays,
and then make trial of a situation with her as teacher. I wrote yesterday to accept the offer."

Lucy felt so hurt that for some moments she was unable to speak.

"Maggie," she said at last, "how could you be so unkind to me--not to tell me--to take such
a step--and now!" She hesitated a little, and then added, "And Philip? I thought everything
was going to be so happy. Oh, Maggie, what is the reason? Give it up; let me write. There is
nothing now to keep you and Philip apart."

"Yes," said Maggie, faintly. "There is Tom's feeling. He said I must give him up if I married
Philip. And I know he will not change--at least not for a long while--unless something happened
to soften him."

"But I will talk to him; he's coming back this week. And this good news about the Mill will
soften him. And I'll talk to him about Philip. Tom's always very compliant to me; I don't think
he's so obstinate."

"But I must go," said Maggie, in a distressed voice. "I must leave some time to pack. Don't
press me to stay, dear Lucy."

Lucy was silent for two or three minutes, looking away and ruminating. At length she knelt
down by her cousin, and looking up in her face with anxious seriousness, said,--

"Maggie, is it that you don't love Philip well enough to marry him? Tell me--trust me."

Maggie held Lucy's hands tightly in silence a little while. Her own hands were quite cold.
But when she spoke, her voice was quite clear and distinct.

"Yes, Lucy, I would choose to marry him. I think it would be the best and highest lot for me,--to
make his life happy. He loved me first. No one else could be quite what he is to me. But I
can't divide myself from my brother for life. I must go away, and wait. Pray don't speak to
me again about it."

Lucy obeyed in pain and wonder. The next word she said was,--

"Well, dear Maggie, at least you will go to the dance at Park House to-morrow, and have some
music and brightness, before you go to pay these dull dutiful visits. Ah! here come aunty and
the tea."

Chapter X

The Spell Seems Broken

The suite of rooms opening into each other at Park House looked duly brilliant with lights
and flowers and the personal splendors of sixteen couples, with attendant parents and guardians.
The focus of brilliancy was the long drawing-room, where the dancing went forward, under the
inspiration of the grand piano; the library, into which it opened at one end, had the more
sober illumination of maturity, with caps and cards; and at the other end the pretty sitting-room,
with a conservatory attached, was left as an occasional cool retreat. Lucy, who had laid aside
her black for the first time, and had her pretty slimness set off by an abundant dress of white
crape, was the acknowledged queen of the occasion; for this was one of the Miss Guests' thoroughly
condescending parties, including no member of any aristocracy higher than that of St. Ogg's,
and stretching to the extreme limits of commercial and professional gentility.

Maggie at first refused to dance, saying that she had forgotten all the figures--it was so
many years since she had danced at school; and she was glad to have that excuse, for it is
ill dancing with a heavy heart. But at length the music wrought in her young limbs, and the
longing came; even though it was the horrible young Torry, who walked up a second time to try
and persuade her. She warned him that she could not dance anything but a country-dance; but
he, of course, was willing to wait for that high felicity, meaning only to be complimentary
when he assured her at several intervals that it was a "great bore" that she couldn't waltz,
he would have liked so much to waltz with her. But at last it was the turn of the good old-fashioned
dance which has the least of vanity and the most of merriment in it, and Maggie quite forgot
her troublous life in a childlike enjoyment of that half-rustic rhythm which seems to banish
pretentious etiquette. She felt quite charitably toward young Torry, as his hand bore her along
and held her up in the dance; her eyes and cheeks had that fire of young joy in them which
will flame out if it can find the least breath to fan it; and her simple black dress, with
its bit of black lace, seemed like the dim setting of a jewel.

Stephen had not yet asked her to dance; had not yet paid her more than a passing civility.
Since yesterday, that inward vision of her which perpetually made part of his consciousness,
had been half screened by the image of Philip Wakem, which came across it like a blot; there
was some attachment between her and Philip; at least there was an attachment on his side, which
made her feel in some bondage. Here, then, Stephen told himself, was another claim of honor
which called on him to resist the attraction that was continually threatening to overpower
him. He told himself so; and yet he had once or twice felt a certain savage resistance, and
at another moment a shuddering repugnance, to this intrusion of Philip's image, which almost
made it a new incitement to rush toward Maggie and claim her for himself. Nevertheless, he
had done what he meant to do this evening,--he had kept aloof from her; he had hardly looked
at her; and he had been gayly assiduous to Lucy. But now his eyes were devouring Maggie; he
felt inclined to kick young Torry out of the dance, and take his place. Then he wanted the
dance to end that he might get rid of his partner. The possibility that he too should dance
with Maggie, and have her hand in his so long, was beginning to possess him like a thirst.
But even now their hands were meeting in the dance,--were meeting still to the very end of
it, though they were far off each other.

Stephen hardly knew what happened, or in what automatic way he got through the duties of politeness
in the interval, until he was free and saw Maggie seated alone again, at the farther end of
the room. He made his way toward her round the couples that were forming for the waltz; and
when Maggie became conscious that she was the person he sought, she felt, in spite of all the
thoughts that had gone before, a glowing gladness at heart. Her eyes and cheeks were still
brightened with her childlike enthusiasm in the dance; her whole frame was set to joy and tenderness;
even the coming pain could not seem bitter,--she was ready to welcome it as a part of life,
for life at this moment seemed a keen, vibrating consciousness poised above pleasure or pain.
This one, this last night, she might expand unrestrainedly in the warmth of the present, without
those chill, eating thoughts of the past and the future.

"They're going to waltz again," said Stephen, bending to speak to her, with that glance and
tone of subdued tenderness which young dreams create to themselves in the summer woods when
low, cooing voices fill the air. Such glances and tones bring the breath of poetry with them
into a room that is half stifling with glaring gas and hard flirtation.

"They are going to waltz again. It is rather dizzy work to look on, and the room is very warm;
shall we walk about a little?"

He took her hand and placed it within his arm, and they walked on into the sitting-room, where
the tables were strewn with engravings for the accommodation of visitors who would not want
to look at them. But no visitors were here at this moment. They passed on into the conservatory.

"How strange and unreal the trees and flowers look with the lights among them!" said Maggie,
in a low voice. "They look as if they belonged to an enchanted land, and would never fade away;
I could fancy they were all made of jewels."

She was looking at the tier of geraniums as she spoke, and Stephen made no answer; but he was
looking at her; and does not a supreme poet blend light and sound into one, calling darkness
mute, and light eloquent? Something strangely powerful there was in the light of Stephen's
long gaze, for it made Maggie's face turn toward it and look upward at it, slowly, like a flower
at the ascending brightness. And they walked unsteadily on, without feeling that they were
walking; without feeling anything but that long, grave, mutual gaze which has the solemnity
belonging to all deep human passion. The hovering thought that they must and would renounce
each other made this moment of mute confession more intense in its rapture.

But they had reached the end of the conservatory, and were obliged to pause and turn. The change
of movement brought a new consciousness to Maggie; she blushed deeply, turned away her head,
and drew her arm from Stephen's, going up to some flowers to smell them. Stephen stood motionless,
and still pale.

"Oh, may I get this rose?" said Maggie, making a great effort to say something, and dissipate
the burning sense of irretrievable confession. "I think I am quite wicked with roses; I like
to gather them and smell them till they have no scent left."

Stephen was mute; he was incapable of putting a sentence together, and Maggie bent her arm
a little upward toward the large half-opened rose that had attracted her. Who has not felt
the beauty of a woman's arm? The unspeakable suggestions of tenderness that lie in the dimpled
elbow, and all the varied gently lessening curves, down to the delicate wrist, with its tiniest,
almost imperceptible nicks in the firm softness. A woman's arm touched the soul of a great
sculptor two thousand years ago, so that he wrought an image of it for the Parthenon which
moves us still as it clasps lovingly the timeworn marble of a headless trunk. Maggie's was
such an arm as that, and it had the warm tints of life.

A mad impulse seized on Stephen; he darted toward the arm, and showered kisses on it, clasping
the wrist.

But the next moment Maggie snatched it from him, and glared at him like a wounded war-goddess,
quivering with rage and humiliation.

"How dare you?" She spoke in a deeply shaken, half-smothered voice. "What right have I given
you to insult me?"

She darted from him into the adjoining room, and threw herself on the sofa, panting and trembling.

A horrible punishment was come upon her for the sin of allowing a moment's happiness that was
treachery to Lucy, to Philip, to her own better soul. That momentary happiness had been smitten
with a blight, a leprosy; Stephen thought more lightly of her than he did of Lucy.

As for Stephen, he leaned back against the framework of the conservatory, dizzy with the conflict
of passions,--love, rage, and confused despair; despair at his want of self-mastery, and despair
that he had offended Maggie.

The last feeling surmounted every other; to be by her side again and entreat forgiveness was
the only thing that had the force of a motive for him, and she had not been seated more than
a few minutes when he came and stood humbly before her. But Maggie's bitter rage was unspent.

"Leave me to myself, if you please," she said, with impetuous haughtiness, "and for the future
avoid me."

Stephen turned away, and walked backward and forward at the other end of the room. There was
the dire necessity of going back into the dancing-room again, and he was beginning to be conscious
of that. They had been absent so short a time, that when he went in again the waltz was not ended.

Maggie, too, was not long before she re-entered. All the pride of her nature was stung into
activity; the hateful weakness which had dragged her within reach of this wound to her self-respect
had at least wrought its own cure. The thoughts and temptations of the last month should all
be flung away into an unvisited chamber of memory. There was nothing to allure her now; duty
would be easy, and all the old calm purposes would reign peacefully once more. She re-entered
the drawing-room still with some excited brightness in her face, but with a sense of proud
self-command that defied anything to agitate her. She refused to dance again, but she talked
quite readily and calmly with every one who addressed her. And when they got home that night,
she kissed Lucy with a free heart, almost exulting in this scorching moment, which had delivered
her from the possibility of another word or look that would have the stamp of treachery toward
that gentle, unsuspicious sister.

The next morning Maggie did not set off to Basset quite so soon as she had expected. Her mother
was to accompany her in the carriage, and household business could not be dispatched hastily
by Mrs. Tulliver. So Maggie, who had been in a hurry to prepare herself, had to sit waiting,
equipped for the drive, in the garden. Lucy was busy in the house wrapping up some bazaar presents
for the younger ones at Basset, and when there was a loud ring at the door-bell, Maggie felt
some alarm lest Lucy should bring out Stephen to her; it was sure to be Stephen.

But presently the visitor came out into the garden alone, and seated himself by her on the
garden-chair. It was not Stephen.

"We can just catch the tips of the Scotch firs, Maggie, from this seat," said Philip.

They had taken each other's hands in silence, but Maggie had looked at him with a more complete
revival of the old childlike affectionate smile than he had seen before, and he felt encouraged.

"Yes," she said, "I often look at them, and wish I could see the low sunlight on the stems
again. But I have never been that way but once,--to the churchyard with my mother."

"I have been there, I go there, continually," said Philip. "I have nothing but the past to
live upon."

A keen remembrance and keen pity impelled Maggie to put her hand in Philip's. They had so often
walked hand in hand!

"I remember all the spots," she said,--"just where you told me of particular things, beautiful
stories that I had never heard of before."

"You will go there again soon, won't you, Maggie?" said Philip, getting timid. "The Mill will
soon be your brother's home again."

"Yes; but I shall not be there," said Maggie. "I shall only hear of that happiness. I am going
away again; Lucy has not told you, perhaps?"

"Then the future will never join on to the past again, Maggie? That book is quite closed?"

The gray eyes that had so often looked up at her with entreating worship, looked up at her
now, with a last struggling ray of hope in them, and Maggie met them with her large sincere gaze.

"That book never will be closed, Philip," she said, with grave sadness; "I desire no future
that will break the ties of the past. But the tie to my brother is one of the strongest. I
can do nothing willingly that will divide me always from him."

"Is that the only reason that would keep us apart forever, Maggie?" said Philip, with a desperate
determination to have a definite answer.

"The only reason," said Maggie, with calm decision. And she believed it. At that moment she
felt as if the enchanted cup had been dashed to the ground. The reactionary excitement that
gave her a proud self-mastery had not subsided, and she looked at the future with a sense of
calm choice.

They sat hand in hand without looking at each other or speaking for a few minutes; in Maggie's
mind the first scenes of love and parting were more present than the actual moment, and she
was looking at Philip in the Red Deeps.

Philip felt that he ought to have been thoroughly happy in that answer of hers; she was as
open and transparent as a rock-pool. Why was he not thoroughly happy? Jealousy is never satisfied
with anything short of an omniscience that would detect the subtlest fold of the heart.

Chapter XI

In the Lane

Maggie had been four days at her aunt Moss's giving the early June sunshine quite a new brightness
in the care-dimmed eyes of that affectionate woman, and making an epoch for her cousins great
and small, who were learning her words and actions by heart, as if she had been a transient
avatar of perfect wisdom and beauty.

She was standing on the causeway with her aunt and a group of cousins feeding the chickens,
at that quiet moment in the life of the farmyards before the afternoon milking-time. The great
buildings round the hollow yard were as dreary and tumbledown as ever, but over the old garden-wall
the straggling rose-bushes were beginning to toss their summer weight, and the gray wood and
old bricks of the house, on its higher level, had a look of sleepy age in the broad afternoon
sunlight, that suited the quiescent time. Maggie, with her bonnet over her arm, was smiling
down at the hatch of small fluffy chickens, when her aunt exclaimed,--

"Goodness me! who is that gentleman coming in at the gate?"

It was a gentleman on a tall bay horse; and the flanks and neck of the horse were streaked
black with fast riding. Maggie felt a beating at head and heart, horrible as the sudden leaping
to life of a savage enemy who had feigned death.

"Who is it, my dear?" said Mrs. Moss, seeing in Maggie's face the evidence that she knew.

"It is Mr. Stephen Guest," said Maggie, rather faintly. "My cousin Lucy's--a gentleman who
is very intimate at my cousin's."

Stephen was already close to them, had jumped off his horse, and now raised his hat as he advanced.

"Hold the horse, Willy," said Mrs. Moss to the twelve-year-old boy.

"No, thank you," said Stephen, pulling at the horse's impatiently tossing head. "I must be
going again immediately. I have a message to deliver to you, Miss Tulliver, on private business.
May I take the liberty of asking you to walk a few yards with me?"

He had a half-jaded, half-irritated look, such as a man gets when he has been dogged by some
care or annoyance that makes his bed and his dinner of little use to him. He spoke almost abruptly,
as if his errand were too pressing for him to trouble himself about what would be thought by
Mrs. Moss of his visit and request. Good Mrs. Moss, rather nervous in the presence of this
apparently haughty gentleman, was inwardly wondering whether she would be doing right or wrong
to invite him again to leave his horse and walk in, when Maggie, feeling all the embarrassment
of the situation, and unable to say anything, put on her bonnet, and turned to walk toward
the gate.

Stephen turned too, and walked by her side, leading his horse.

Not a word was spoken till they were out in the lane, and had walked four or five yards, when
Maggie, who had been looking straight before her all the while, turned again to walk back,
saying, with haughty resentment,--

"There is no need for me to go any farther. I don't know whether you consider it gentlemanly
and delicate conduct to place me in a position that forced me to come out with you, or whether
you wished to insult me still further by thrusting an interview upon me in this way."

"Of course you are angry with me for coming," said Stephen, bitterly. "Of course it is of no
consequence what a man has to suffer; it is only your woman's dignity that you care about."

Maggie gave a slight start, such as might have come from the slightest possible electric shock.

"As if it were not enough that I'm entangled in this way; that I'm mad with love for you; that
I resist the strongest passion a man can feel, because I try to be true to other claims; but
you must treat me as if I were a coarse brute, who would willingly offend you. And when, if
I had my own choice, I should ask you to take my hand and my fortune and my whole life, and
do what you liked with them! I know I forgot myself. I took an unwarrantable liberty. I hate
myself for having done it. But I repented immediately; I've been repenting ever since. You
ought not to think it unpardonable; a man who loves with his whole soul, as I do you, is liable
to be mastered by his feelings for a moment; but you know--you must believe--that the worst
pain I could have is to have pained you; that I would give the world to recall the error."

Maggie dared not speak, dared not turn her head. The strength that had come from resentment
was all gone, and her lips were quivering visibly. She could not trust herself to utter the
full forgiveness that rose in answer to that confession.

They were come nearly in front of the gate again, and she paused, trembling.

"You must not say these things; I must not hear them," she said, looking down in misery, as
Stephen came in front of her, to prevent her from going farther toward the gate. "I'm very
sorry for any pain you have to go through; but it is of no use to speak."

"Yes, it is of use," said Stephen, impetuously. "It would be of use if you would treat me with
some sort of pity and consideration, instead of doing me vile injustice in your mind. I could
bear everything more quietly if I knew you didn't hate me for an insolent coxcomb. Look at
me; see what a hunted devil I am; I've been riding thirty miles every day to get away from
the thought of you."

Maggie did not--dared not--look. She had already seen the harassed face. But she said gently,--

"I don't think any evil of you."

"Then, dearest, look at me," said Stephen, in deepest, tenderest tones of entreaty. "Don't
go away from me yet. Give me a moment's happiness; make me feel you've forgiven me."

"Yes, I do forgive you," said Maggie, shaken by those tones, and all the more frightened at
herself. "But pray let me go in again. Pray go away."

A great tear fell from under her lowered eyelids.

"I can't go away from you; I can't leave you," said Stephen, with still more passionate pleading.
"I shall come back again if you send me away with this coldness; I can't answer for myself.
But if you will go with me only a little way I can live on that. You see plainly enough that
your anger has only made me ten times more unreasonable."

Maggie turned. But Tancred, the bay horse, began to make such spirited remonstrances against
this frequent change of direction, that Stephen, catching sight of Willy Moss peeping through
the gate, called out, "Here! just come and hold my horse for five minutes."

"Oh, no," said Maggie, hurriedly, "my aunt will think it so strange."

"Never mind," Stephen answered impatiently; "they don't know the people at St. Ogg's. Lead
him up and down just here for five minutes," he added to Willy, who was now close to them;
and then he turned to Maggie's side, and they walked on. It was clear that she must go on now.

"Take my arm," said Stephen, entreatingly; and she took it, feeling all the while as if she
were sliding downward in a nightmare.

"There is no end to this misery," she began, struggling to repel the influence by speech. "It
is wicked--base--ever allowing a word or look that Lucy--that others might not have seen. Think
of Lucy."

"I do think of her--bless her. If I didn't----" Stephen had laid his hand on Maggie's that
rested on his arm, and they both felt it difficult to speak.

"And I have other ties," Maggie went on, at last, with a desperate effort, "even if Lucy did
not exist."

"You are engaged to Philip Wakem?" said Stephen, hastily. "Is it so?"

"I consider myself engaged to him; I don't mean to marry any one else."

Stephen was silent again until they had turned out of the sun into a side lane, all grassy
and sheltered. Then he burst out impetuously,--

"It is unnatural, it is horrible. Maggie, if you loved me as I love you, we should throw everything
else to the winds for the sake of belonging to each other. We should break all these mistaken
ties that were made in blindness, and determine to marry each other."

"I would rather die than fall into that temptation," said Maggie, with deep, slow distinctness,
all the gathered spiritual force of painful years coming to her aid in this extremity. She
drew her arm from his as she spoke.

"Tell me, then, that you don't care for me," he said, almost violently. "Tell me that you love
some one else better."

It darted through Maggie's mind that here was a mode of releasing herself from outward struggle,--to
tell Stephen that her whole heart was Philip's. But her lips would not utter that, and she
was silent.

"If you do love me, dearest," said Stephen, gently, taking her hand again and laying it within
his arm, "it is better--it is right that we should marry each other. We can't help the pain
it will give. It is come upon us without our seeking; it is natural; it has taken hold of me
in spite of every effort I have made to resist it. God knows, I've been trying to be faithful
to tacit engagements, and I've only made things worse; I'd better have given way at first."

Maggie was silent. If it were not wrong--if she were once convinced of that, and need no longer
beat and struggle against this current, soft and yet strong as the summer stream!

"Say've s' dearest," said Stephen, leaning to look entreatingly in her face. "What could we
care about in the whole world beside, if we belonged to each other?"

Her breath was on his face, his lips were very near hers, but there was a great dread dwelling
in his love for her.

Her lips and eyelids quivered; she opened her eyes full on his for an instant, like a lovely
wild animal timid and struggling under caresses, and then turned sharp round toward home again.

"And after all," he went on, in an impatient tone, trying to defeat his own scruples as well
as hers, "I am breaking no positive engagement; if Lucy's affections had been withdrawn from
me and given to some one else, I should have felt no right to assert a claim on her. If you
are not absolutely pledged to Philip, we are neither of us bound."

"You don't believe that; it is not your real feeling," said Maggie, earnestly. "You feel, as
I do, that the real tie lies in the feelings and expectations we have raised in other minds.
Else all pledges might be broken, when there was no outward penalty. There would be no such
thing as faithfulness."

Stephen was silent; he could not pursue that argument; the opposite conviction had wrought
in him too strongly through his previous time of struggle. But it soon presented itself in
a new form.

"The pledge can't be fulfilled," he said, with impetuous insistence. "It is unnatural; we can
only pretend to give ourselves to any one else. There is wrong in that too; there may be misery
in it for them as well as for us. Maggie, you must see that; you do see that."

He was looking eagerly at her face for the least sign of compliance; his large, firm, gentle
grasp was on her hand. She was silent for a few moments, with her eyes fixed on the ground;
then she drew a deep breath, and said, looking up at him with solemn sadness,--

"Oh, it is difficult,--life is very difficult! It seems right to me sometimes that we should
follow our strongest feeling; but then, such feelings continually come across the ties that
all our former life has made for us,--the ties that have made others dependent on us,--and
would cut them in two. If life were quite easy and simple, as it might have been in Paradise,
and we could always see that one being first toward whom--I mean, if life did not make duties
for us before love comes, love would be a sign that two people ought to belong to each other.
But I see--I feel it is not so now; there are things we must renounce in life; some of us must
resign love. Many things are difficult and dark to me; but I see one thing quite clearly,--that
I must not, cannot, seek my own happiness by sacrificing others. Love is natural; but surely
pity and faithfulness and memory are natural too. And they would live in me still, and punish
me if I did not obey them. I should be haunted by the suffering I had caused. Our love would
be poisoned. Don't urge me; help me,--help me, because I love you."

Maggie had become more and more earnest as she went on; her face had become flushed, and her
eyes fuller and fuller of appealing love. Stephen had the fibre of nobleness in him that vibrated
to her appeal; but in the same moment--how could it be otherwise?--that pleading beauty gained
new power over him.

"Dearest," he said, in scarcely more than a whisper, while his arm stole round her, "I'll do,
I'll bear anything you wish. But--one kiss--one--the last--before we part."

One kiss, and then a long look, until Maggie said tremulously, "Let me go,--let me make haste
back."

She hurried along, and not another word was spoken. Stephen stood still and beckoned when they
came within sight of Willy and the horse, and Maggie went on through the gate. Mrs. Moss was
standing alone at the door of the old porch; she had sent all the cousins in, with kind thoughtfulness.
It might be a joyful thing that Maggie had a rich and handsome lover, but she would naturally
feel embarrassed at coming in again; and it might not be joyful. In either case Mrs. Moss waited
anxiously to receive Maggie by herself. The speaking face told plainly enough that, if there
was joy, it was of a very agitating, dubious sort.

"Sit down here a bit, my dear." She drew Maggie into the porch, and sat down on the bench by
her; there was no privacy in the house.

"Oh, aunt Gritty, I'm very wretched! I wish I could have died when I was fifteen. It seemed
so easy to give things up then; it is so hard now."

The poor child threw her arms round her aunt's neck, and fell into long, deep sobs.

Maggie left her good aunt Gritty at the end of the week, and went to Garum Firs to pay her
visit to aunt Pullet according to agreement. In the mean time very unexpected things had happened,
and there was to be a family party at Garum to discuss and celebrate a change in the fortunes
of the Tullivers, which was likely finally to carry away the shadow of their demerits like
the last limb of an eclipse, and cause their hitherto obscured virtues to shine forth in full-rounded
splendor. It is pleasant to know that a new ministry just come into office are not the only
fellow-men who enjoy a period of high appreciation and full-blown eulogy; in many respectable
families throughout this realm, relatives becoming creditable meet with a similar cordiality
of recognition, which in its fine freedom from the coercion of any antecedents, suggests the
hopeful possibility that we may some day without any notice find ourselves in full millennium,
with cockatrices who have ceased to bite, and wolves that no longer show their teeth with any
but the blandest intentions.

Lucy came so early as to have the start even of aunt Glegg; for she longed to have some undisturbed
talk with Maggie about the wonderful news. It seemed, did it not? said Lucy, with her prettiest
air of wisdom, as if everything, even other people's misfortunes (poor creatures!) were conspiring
now to make poor dear aunt Tulliver, and cousin Tom, and naughty Maggie too, if she were not
obstinately bent on the contrary, as happy as they deserved to be after all their troubles.
To think that the very day--the very day--after Tom had come back from Newcastle, that unfortunate
young Jetsome, whom Mr. Wakem had placed at the Mill, had been pitched off his horse in a drunken
fit, and was lying at St. Ogg's in a dangerous state, so that Wakem had signified his wish
that the new purchasers should enter on the premises at once!

It was very dreadful for that unhappy young man, but it did seem as if the misfortune had happened
then, rather than at any other time, in order that cousin Tom might all the sooner have the
fit reward of his exemplary conduct,--papa thought so very highly of him. Aunt Tulliver must
certainly go to the Mill now, and keep house for Tom; that was rather a loss to Lucy in the
matter of household comfort; but then, to think of poor aunty being in her old place again,
and gradually getting comforts about her there!

On this last point Lucy had her cunning projects, and when she and Maggie had made their dangerous
way down the bright stairs into the handsome parlor, where the very sunbeams seemed cleaner
than elsewhere, she directed her manœuvres, as any other great tactician would have done, against
the weaker side of the enemy.

"Aunt Pullet," she said, seating herself on the sofa, and caressingly adjusting that lady's
floating cap-string, "I want you to make up your mind what linen and things you will give Tom
toward housekeeping; because you are always so generous,--you give such nice things, you know;
and if you set the example, aunt Glegg will follow."

"That she never can, my dear," said Mrs. Pullet, with unusual vigor, "for she hasn't got the
linen to follow suit wi' mine, I can tell you. She'd niver the taste, not if she'd spend the
money. Big checks and live things, like stags and foxes, all her table-linen is,--not a spot
nor a diamond among 'em. But it's poor work dividing one's linen before one dies,--I niver
thought to ha' done that, Bessy," Mrs. Pullet continued, shaking her head and looking at her
sister Tulliver, "when you and me chose the double diamont, the first flax iver we'd spun,
and the Lord knows where yours is gone."

"I'd no choice, I'm sure, sister," said poor Mrs. Tulliver, accustomed to consider herself
in the light of an accused person. "I'm sure it was no wish o' mine, iver, as I should lie
awake o' nights thinking o' my best bleached linen all over the country."

"Take a peppermint, Mrs. Tulliver," said uncle Pullet, feeling that he was offering a cheap
and wholesome form of comfort, which he was recommending by example.

"Oh, but, aunt Pullet," said Lucy, "you've so much beautiful linen. And suppose you had had
daughters! Then you must have divided it when they were married."

"Well, I don't say as I won't do it," said Mrs. Pullet, "for now Tom's so lucky, it's nothing
but right his friends should look on him and help him. There's the tablecloths I bought at
your sale, Bessy; it was nothing but good natur' o' me to buy 'em, for they've been lying in
the chest ever since. But I'm not going to give Maggie any more o' my Indy muslin and things,
if she's to go into service again, when she might stay and keep me company, and do my sewing
for me, if she wasn't wanted at her brother's."

"Going into service" was the expression by which the Dodson mind represented to itself the
position of teacher or governess; and Maggie's return to that menial condition, now circumstances
offered her more eligible prospects, was likely to be a sore point with all her relatives,
besides Lucy. Maggie in her crude form, with her hair down her back, and altogether in a state
of dubious promise, was a most undesirable niece; but now she was capable of being at once
ornamental and useful. The subject was revived in aunt and uncle Glegg's presence, over the
tea and muffins.

"Hegh, hegh!" said Mr. Glegg, good-naturedly patting Maggie on the back, "nonsense, nonsense!
Don't let us hear of you taking a place again, Maggie. Why, you must ha' picked up half-a-dozen
sweethearts at the bazaar; isn't there one of'em the right sort of article? Come, now?"

"Mr. Glegg," said his wife, with that shade of increased politeness in her severity which she
always put on with her crisper fronts, "you'll excuse me, but you're far too light for a man
of your years. It's respect and duty to her aunts, and the rest of her kin as are so good to
her, should have kept my niece from fixing about going away again without consulting us; not
sweethearts, if I'm to use such a word, though it was never heared in my family."

"Why, what did they call us, when we went to see 'em, then, eh, neighbor Pullet? They thought
us sweet enough then," said Mr. Glegg, winking pleasantly; while Mr. Pullet, at the suggestion
of sweetness, took a little more sugar.

"Mr. Glegg," said Mrs. G., "if you're going to be undelicate, let me know."

"La, Jane, your husband's only joking," said Mrs. Pullet; "let him joke while he's got health
and strength. There's poor Mr. Tilt got his mouth drawn all o' one side, and couldn't laugh
if he was to try."

"I'll trouble you for the muffineer, then, Mr. Glegg," said Mrs. G., "if I may be so bold to
interrupt your joking. Though it's other people must see the joke in a niece's putting a slight
on her mother's eldest sister, as is the head o' the family; and only coming in and out on
short visits, all the time she's been in the town, and then settling to go away without my
knowledge,--as I'd laid caps out on purpose for her to make 'em up for me,--and me as have
divided my money so equal----"

"Sister," Mrs. Tulliver broke in anxiously, "I'm sure Maggie never thought o' going away without
staying at your house as well as the others. Not as it's my wish she should go away at all,
but quite contrairy. I'm sure I'm innocent. I've said over and over again, 'My dear, you've
no call to go away.' But there's ten days or a fortnight Maggie'll have before she's fixed
to go; she can stay at your house just as well, and I'll step in when I can, and so will Lucy."

"Bessy," said Mrs. Glegg, "if you'd exercise a little more thought, you might know I should
hardly think it was worth while to unpin a bed, and go to all that trouble now, just at the
end o' the time, when our house isn't above a quarter of an hour's walk from Mr. Deane's. She
can come the first thing in the morning, and go back the last at night, and be thankful she's
got a good aunt so close to her to come and sit with. I know I should, when I was her age."

"La, Jane," said Mrs. Pullet, "it 'ud do your beds good to have somebody to sleep in 'em. There's
that striped room smells dreadful mouldy, and the glass mildewed like anything. I'm sure I
thought I should be struck with death when you took me in."

"Oh, there is Tom!" exclaimed Lucy, clapping her hands. "He's come on Sindbad, as I told him.
I was afraid he was not going to keep his promise."

Maggie jumped up to kiss Tom as he entered, with strong feeling, at this first meeting since
the prospect of returning to the Mill had been opened to him; and she kept his hand, leading
him to the chair by her side. To have no cloud between herself and Tom was still a perpetual
yearning in her, that had its root deeper than all change. He smiled at her very kindly this
evening, and said, "Well, Magsie, how's aunt Moss?"

"Come, come, sir," said Mr. Glegg putting out his hand. "Why, you're such a big man, you carry
all before you, it, seems. You're come into your luck a good deal earlier than us old folks
did; but I wish you joy, I wish you joy. You'll get the Mill all for your own again some day,
I'll be bound. You won't stop half-way up the hill."

"But I hope he'll bear in mind as it's his mother's family as he owes it to," said Mrs. Glegg.
"If he hadn't had them to take after, he'd ha' been poorly off. There was never any failures,
nor lawing, nor wastefulness in our family, nor dying without wills----"

"No, nor sudden deaths," said aunt Pullet; "allays the doctor called in. But Tom had the Dodson
skin; I said that from the first. And I don't know what you mean to do, sister Glegg, but I
mean to give him a tablecloth of all my three biggest sizes but one, besides sheets. I don't
say what more I shall do; but that I shall do, and if I should die to-morrow, Mr. Pullet, you'll
bear it in mind,--though you'll be blundering with the keys, and never remember as that on
the third shelf o' the left-hand wardrobe, behind the night-caps with the broad ties,--not
the narrow-frilled uns,--is the key of the drawer in the Blue Room, where the key o' the Blue
Closet is. You'll make a mistake, and I shall niver be worthy to know it. You've a memory for
my pills and draughts, wonderful,--I'll allays say that of you,--but you're lost among the
keys." This gloomy prospect of the confusion that would ensue on her decease was very affecting
to Mrs. Pullet.

"You carry it too far, Sophy,--that locking in and out," said Mrs. Glegg, in a tone of some
disgust at this folly. "You go beyond your own family. There's nobody can say I don't lock
up; but I do what's reasonable, and no more. And as for the linen, I shall look out what's
serviceable, to make a present of to my nephey; I've got cloth as has never been whitened,
better worth having than other people's fine holland; and I hope he'll lie down in it and think
of his aunt."

Tom thanked Mrs. Glegg, but evaded any promise to meditate nightly on her virtues; and Mrs.
Glegg effected a diversion for him by asking about Mr. Deane's intentions concerning steam.

Lucy had had her far-sighted views in begging Tom to come on Sindbad. It appeared, when it
was time to go home, that the man-servant was to ride the horse, and cousin Tom was to drive
home his mother and Lucy. "You must sit by yourself, aunty," said that contriving young lady,
"because I must sit by Tom; I've a great deal to say to him."

In the eagerness of her affectionate anxiety for Maggie, Lucy could not persuade herself to
defer a conversation about her with Tom, who, she thought, with such a cup of joy before him
as this rapid fulfilment of his wish about the Mill, must become pliant and flexible. Her nature
supplied her with no key to Tom's; and she was puzzled as well as pained to notice the unpleasant
change on his countenance when she gave him the history of the way in which Philip had used
his influence with his father. She had counted on this revelation as a great stroke of policy,
which was to turn Tom's heart toward Philip at once, and, besides that, prove that the elder
Wakem was ready to receive Maggie with all the honors of a daughter-in-law. Nothing was wanted,
then, but for dear Tom, who always had that pleasant smile when he looked at cousin Lucy, to
turn completely round, say the opposite of what he had always said before, and declare that
he, for his part, was delighted that all the old grievances should be healed, and that Maggie
should have Philip with all suitable despatch; in cousin Lucy's opinion nothing could be easier.

But to minds strongly marked by the positive and negative qualities that create severity,--strength
of will, conscious rectitude of purpose, narrowness of imagination and intellect, great power
of self-control, and a disposition to exert control over others,--prejudices come as the natural
food of tendencies which can get no sustenance out of that complex, fragmentary, doubt-provoking
knowledge which we call truth. Agatha was touched by the evidences of his emotion, and her voice
became very gentle. "I fancy it is the same--James Hambleton of Lynn?" Aleck nodded and she went
on: "That's what he told me, the night we were wrecked."

Agatha looked at Aleck, as if she would discover whether he were trustworthy or not, before giving
him more of her story. Presently she continued:

"He's a very brave, a very wonderful man. He jumped overboard to save me, after I fell from
the ladder; and then they left us and we swam ashore. But long before we got there I fainted, and
he brought me in, all the way, though he was nearly dead of exhaustion himself. He had hemorrhage
from overexertion, and afterward a chill. And now there is fever."

Agatha's voice was trembling. Aleck watched her as she told her tale, the flush of happiness
and joy still lighting up his face.

As she finished relating the meager facts which to her denoted so many heart-throbs, a sob drowned her
voice. As Aleck followed the story, his own eyes wavered.

"That's Jim, down to the ground.

Good old boy!" he said.

There was silence for a minute, then he heard Agatha's voice, grown little and faint. "If he should
die--!"

Aleck, still standing by Agatha's couch, suddenly shook himself. "Where is he? Can I see him now?"

Agatha
got up slowly and led the way down the hall, pointing to a door that stood ajar. It was evident
that she was weak.

"I can't go in--I can't bear to see him so ill," she whispered; and as Aleck looked at her before
entering the sick-room, he saw that her eyes were filled with tears.

Agatha went back to her couch, feeling that the heavens had opened. Here was a friend come to her
from she knew not where, whose right it was to assume responsibility for the sick man. He was kind
and good, and he loved her rescuer with the boyish devotion of their school-days. He would
surely help; he would work with her to keep death away. Whatever love and professional skill could
do, should be done; there had been no question as to that, of course, from the beginning.
But here was some one who would double, yes, more than double her own efforts; some one who was
strong and well and capable. Her heart was thankful.

Before Aleck returned from the sick-room, Doctor Thayer's step sounded on the stairs, followed
by the mildly complaining voice of Sallie Kingsbury.

Presently the two men were in a low-voiced conference in the hall. Agatha waited while they talked,
feeling grateful afresh that Doctor Thayer's grim professional wisdom was to be reinforced by
Mr. Van Camp's resources. When the doctor entered Agatha's room, her face had almost the natural
flush of health.

"Ah, Miss Agatha Redmond"--the doctor continued frequently to address her by her full name, half
in affectionate deference and half with some dry sense of humor peculiar to himself--"Miss Agatha
Redmond, so you're beginning to pick up! A good thing, too; for I don't want two patients in one
house like the one out yonder. He's a very sick man, Miss Agatha."

"I know, Doctor. I have seen him grow worse, hour by hour, ever since we came. What can be done?"

"He
needs special nursing now, and your man in there will be worn out presently."

"Oh, that can be managed. Send to Portland, to Boston, or somewhere. We can get a nurse here soon.
Do not spare any trouble. Doctor. I can arrange--"

Doctor Thayer squared himself and paced slowly up and down Agatha's room. He did not reply at once,
and when he did, it was with one of his characteristic turns toward an apparently irrelevant
topic.

"Have you seen Sister Susan?" he inquired, stopping by the side of Agatha's couch and looking down
on her with his shrewd gaze. It was a needless question, for he knew that Agatha had not seen
Mrs. Stoddard. She had been too weak and ill to see anybody. Agatha shook her head.

"Well, Miss Agatha Redmond, Susan's the nurse we need for that young gentleman over there. It's
constant care he must have now, day and night; and if he gets well, it will be good nursing that
does it. There isn't a nurse in this country like Susan, when she once takes hold of a case.
That Mr. Hand in there is all right, but he can't sit up much longer night and day, as he has
been doing. And he isn't a woman. Don't know why it is, but the Lord seems bent on throwing sick
men into women's hands--as if they weren't more than a match for us when we're well!"

Agatha's humorous smile rewarded the doctor's grim comments, if that was what he wanted.

"No, Doctor," she said, with a fleeting touch of her old lightness,
"we're never a match for you.

We may entertain you or nurse you or feed you, or possibly once in a century or two inspire
you; but we're never a match for you."

"For which Heaven be praised!" ejaculated the doctor fervently.

Agatha watched him as he fumbled nervously about the room or clasped his hands behind him under his
long coat-tails. The greenish-black frock-coat hung untidily upon
him, and his white fringe of hair was anything but smooth.

She perceived that something other than medical problems troubled him.

"Would your sister--would Mrs. Stoddard--be willing to come here to
take care of Mr. Hambleton?" she ventured.

"Ask me that," snapped the doctor, "when no man on earth could tell
whether she'll come or not.

She says she won't. She's hurt and she's outraged; or at least she thinks she is. But if you
could get her to think that it was her duty to take care of that poor boy in there, she'd come fast
enough."

Agatha was puzzled. She felt as if there were a dozen ways to turn and only one way that would
lead her aright; and she could not find the clue to that one right
way.

  At last she attacked the doctor boldly.

"Tell
  me, Doctor Thayer," she said earnestly, "just what it is that causes
Mrs. Stoddard to feel hurt and outraged.

Is it simply because I have inherited the money and the house? She
can not possibly know anything about me personally."

The old doctor thrust his under jaw out more belligerently than ever, while turning his answer
over in his mind.

He took two lengths of the room before stopping again by Agatha's side and looking down on her.

"She
says it isn't the money, but that it's the slight Hercules put upon her for leaving the place,
our old home, out of the family. That's one thing; but that isn't the worst. Susan's orthodox,
you know, very orthodox; and she has a prejudice against your profession--serving Satan, she
calls it. She thinks that's what actresses and opera singers do,
though how she knows anything about it, I don't see."

The grim smile shone in the doctor's eyes even while he looked, half anxiously, to see how Agatha
was taking his explanation of Mrs. Stoddard's attitude.

Agatha meditated a moment.

"If it's merely a prejudice in the abstract against my being an opera singer, I think she will
overcome that.

Besides, Mr. Hambleton is neither an actor nor an opera singer; he isn't 'serving Satan.'"

"Well--" the doctor hesitated, and then went on hastily with a great show of irritation, "Susan's
a little set in her views.

She disapproves of the way you came here; says you shouldn't have been out in a boat with two
men, and that it's a judgment for sin, your being drowned, or next door to it. I'm only saying
this, my dear Miss Agatha, to explain to you why Susan--"

But Agatha was enlightened at last, and roused sufficiently to cause two red spots, brighter
than they had ever been in health, to burn on her cheeks. She sat up very straight, facing Doctor
Thayer's worried gaze, and interrupted him in tones ringing with anger.

"Do you mean to tell me, Doctor Thayer, that your sister, the sister of my mother's lifelong
friend, sits in her house and imagines scandalous stories about me, when she knows nothing at
all about the facts or about me? That she thinks I was out in a boat alone with two men? That
she is mean enough to condemn me without knowing the first thing about this awful accident? Oh,
I have no words!" And Agatha covered her burning face with her hands, unable, by mere speech,
to express her outraged feelings. Doctor Thayer edged uneasily about Agatha's couch, with a
manner resembling that of a whipped dog.

"Why, my dear Miss Agatha, Susan will come round in time. She's not so bad, really. She'll come
round in time, only just now we haven't any time to spare. Don't feel so badly; Susan is too
set in her views--"

"'Set!'" cried Agatha. "She's a horrid, un-Christian woman!"

"Oh, no," remonstrated the doctor. "Susan's all right, when you once get used to her. She's a
trifle old-fashioned in her views--"

But Agatha was not listening to the doctor's feeble justification of Susan. She was thinking
hard.

"Doctor Thayer," she urged, "do you want that woman to come here to take care of Mr. Hambleton?
Isn't there any one else in this whole countryside who can nurse a sick man? Why, I can do it myself;
or Mr. Van Camp, his cousin, could do it. Why should you want her, of all people, when she
feels so toward us?"

The moment his professional judgment came into question Doctor Thayer slipped out from the cloud
of embarrassment which had engulfed him in his recent conversation, and assumed the authoritative
voice that Agatha had first heard.

"My dear Miss Agatha Redmond, that is foolish talk.

You are half sick, even now; and it requires a strong person, with no nerves, to do what I desire
done. Mr. Van Camp may be his cousin, but the chances are that he wouldn't know a bromide from a blister;
and good nurses don't grow on bushes in Ilion, nor in Charlesport, either. There isn't one to be
had, so far as I know, and we can't wait to send to Augusta or Portland. The next few days,
especially the next twenty-four hours, are critical."

Agatha listened intently, and a growing resolution shone in her eyes.

"Would Mrs. Stoddard come, if it were not for what you said--about me?" she asked.

"The Lord only knows, but I think she would," replied the poor, harassed
doctor.

"She's always been a regular Dorcas in this neighborhood."

"Dorcas!" cried Agatha, her anger again flaring up. "I should say Sapphira."

"Oh, now, Susan isn't so bad, when you once know her," urged the doctor.

Agatha

got up and went to the window, trailing her traveling rug after her. "She shall come--I'll
bring her. And sometime she shall mend her words about me--but that can wait. If she will only
help to save James Hambleton's life now! Where does she live?" Suddenly, as she stood at the
window, she saw her opportunity. "There's Little Simon down there now under the trees; and his
buggy must be somewhere near.

Will you stay here, Doctor Thayer, with Mr. Hambleton, while I go to see your sister?"

"Hadn't I better drive you over to see Susan myself?" feebly suggested the doctor.

"No, I'll go alone."

There was anger, determination, gunpowder in Agatha's voice.

"But mind you, don't offer her any money," the doctor warned, as he watched her go down the hall and
disappear for an instant in the bedroom where James Hambleton lay.

She came out almost immediately and without a word descended the wide stairway, opened the
dining-room door, and called softly to Sallie Kingsbury.

Doctor Thayer returned to the sick-room. Ten minutes later he heard the wheels of Little Simon's
buggy rolling rapidly up the road in the direction of Susan Stoddard's
place.

CHAPTER XIV

SUSAN STODDARD'S PRAYER

There was a wide porch, spotlessly scrubbed, along the front of the house, and two hydrangeas
blooming gorgeously in tubs, one on either side of the walk.

The house looked new and modern, shiny with paint and furnished with all the conveniences offered
by the relentless progress of our day.

Little Simon had informed Agatha, during their short drive, that Deacon
Stoddard had achieved this "residence" shortly before his death; and
his tone implied that it was the pride of the town, its real treasure.

Even to Agatha's absorbed and preoccupied mind it presented a striking
contrast to the old red house, which had received her so graciously
into its spacious comfort.

She marveled that anything so fresh and modish as the house before
her could have come into being in the old town.

It was next to a certainty that there was a model laundry with set tubs beyond the kitchen, and
equally sure that no old horsehair lounge subtly invited the wearied
traveler to rest.

A cool draft came through the screen door. Within, it was cleaner than anything Agatha had ever
seen. The stair-rail glistened, the polished floors shone. A neat bouquet of sweet peas stood
exactly in the center of a snow-white doily, which was exactly in
the middle of a shiny, round table.

The very door-mat was brand new; Agatha would never have thought of wiping her shoes on it.

Agatha's ring was answered by a half-grown girl, who looked scared when she saw a stranger
at the door. Agatha walked into the parlor, in spite of the girl's hesitation In inviting her,
and directed her to say to Mrs. Stoddard that Miss Redmond, from the old red house, wished particularly
to see her. The girl's face assumed an expression of intelligent and ecstatic curiosity.

"Oh!" she breathed. Then, "She's putting up plums, but she can come out in a few minutes." She could
not go without lingering to look at Agatha, her wide-eyed gaze taking note of her hair, her
dress, her hands, her face. As Agatha became conscious of the ingenuous inspection to which
she was subjected, she smiled at the girl--one of her old, radiant, friendly smiles.

"Run now, and tell Mrs. Stoddard, there's a good child! And sometime you must come to see me
at the red house; will you?"

The girl's face lighted up as if the sun had come through a cloud. She smiled at Agatha in return,
with a "Yes" under her breath. Thus are slaves made.

Left alone in the cool, dim parlor, so orderly and spotless, Agatha had a presentiment of the
prejudice of class and of religion against which she was about to
throw herself.

Susan Stoddard's fanaticism was not merely that of an individual; it represented the stored-up
strength of hardy, conscience-driven generations. The Stoddards might build themselves houses
with model laundries, but they did not thereby transfer their real
treasure from the incorruptible kingdom.

If they were not ruled by aesthetic ideals, neither were they governed
by thoughts of worldly display.

This fragrant, clean room bespoke character and family history. Agatha found herself absently
looking down at a white wax cross, entwined with wax flowers, standing
under a glass on the center-table.

It was a strange piece of handicraft. Its whiteness was suggestive of death, not life, and
the curving leaves and petals, through which the vital sap once flowed,
were beautiful no longer, now that their day of tender freshness was
so inappropriately prolonged.

As Agatha, with mind aloof, wondered vaguely at the laborious patience
exhibited in the work, her eye caught sight of an inscription molded
in the wax pedestal: "Brother."

Her mind was sharply brought back from the impersonal region of speculation. What she saw was
not merely a sentimental, misguided attempt at art; it was Susan
Stoddard's memorial of her brother, Hercules Thayer--the man who had
so unexpectedly influenced Agatha's own life. To Susan Stoddard this
wax cross was the symbol of the companionship of childhood, and of
all the sweet and bitter involved in the inexplicable bond of blood
relationship. Agatha felt more kindly toward her because of this mute,
fantastic memorial. She looked up almost with her characteristic friendly
smile as she heard slow, steady steps coming down the hall.

The eyes
that returned Agatha's look were not smiling, though they did not
look unkind. They gazed, without embarrassment, as without pride,
into Agatha's face, as if they would probe at once to the covered
springs of action. Mrs. Stoddard was a thick-set woman, rather short,
looking toward sixty, with iron-gray hair parted in the middle and
drawn back in an old-fashioned, pretty way.

It was to the credit
of Mrs. Stoddard's breeding that she took no notice of Agatha's peculiar
dress, unsuited as it was to any place but the bedroom, even in the
morning. Mrs. Stoddard herself was neat as a pin in a cotton gown
made for utility, not beauty. She stood for an instant with her clear,
untroubled gaze full upon Agatha, then drew forward a chair from its
mathematical position against the wall. When she spoke, her voice
was a surprise, it was so low and deep, with a resonance like that
of the 'cello. It was not the voice of a young woman; it was, rather,
a rare gift of age, telling how beautiful an old woman's speech could
be. Moreover, it carried refinement of birth and culture, a beauty
of phrase and enunciation, which would have marked her with distinction
anywhere.

"How do you do, Miss Redmond?"

Agatha, standing by the
table with the cross, made no movement toward the chair. She was not
come face to face with Mrs. Stoddard for the purpose of social visitation,
but because, in the warfare of life, she had been sent to the enemy
with a message. That, at least, was Agatha's point of view. Officially,
she was come to plead with Mrs. Stoddard; personally, she was hot
and resentful at her unjust words. Her reply to her hostess' greeting
was brief and her attitude unbending.

"I have come to ask you, Mrs.
Stoddard," Agatha began, though to her chagrin, she found her voice
was unsteady--"I have come personally to ask you, Mrs. Stoddard, if
you will help us in caring for our friend, who is very ill. Your brother,
Doctor Thayer, wishes it. It is a case of life and death, maybe; and
skilful nursing is difficult to find."

Agatha's hand, that rested
on the table, was trembling by the time she finished her speech; she
was vividly conscious of the panic that had come upon her nerves at
a fresh realization of the wall of defense and resistance which she
was attempting to assail. It spoke to her from Mrs. Stoddard's calm,
other-worldly eyes, from her serene, deep voice.

"No, Miss Redmond,
that work is not for me."

"But please, Mrs. Stoddard, will you not
reconsider your decision? It is not for myself I ask, but for another--one
who is suffering."

Mrs. Stoddard's gaze went past Agatha and rested
on the white cross with the inscription, "Brother." She slowly shook
her head, saying again, "No, that work is not for me. The Lord does
not call me there."

As the two women stood there, with the funeral
cross between them, each with her heart's burden of griefs, convictions
and resentments, each recoiled, sensitively, from the other's touch.
But life and the burden life imposes were too strong.

"How can yon
say, Mrs. Stoddard, 'that work is not for me,' when there is suffering
you can relieve, sickness that you can cure? I am asking a hard thing,
I know; but we will help to make it as easy as possible for you, and
we are in great need."

"Should the servants of the Lord falter in
doing His work?" Mrs. Stoddard's voice intoned reverently, while she
looked at Agatha with her sincere eyes. "No. He gives strength to
perform His commands. But sickness and sorrow and death are on every
hand; to some it is appointed for a moment's trial, to others it is
the wages of sin. We can not alter the Lord's decrees."

Agatha stared
at the rapt speaker with amazed eyes, and presently the anger she
had felt at Doctor Thayer's words rose again within her breast, doubly
strong. The doctor had given but a feeble version of the judgment;
here was the real voice hurling anathema, as did the prophets of old.
But even as she listened, she gathered all her force to combat this
sword of the spirit which had so suddenly risen against her.

"You
are a hard and unjust woman, to talk of the 'wages of sin.' What do
you know of my life, or of him who is sick over at the red house?
Who are you, to sit in judgment upon us?"

"I am the humblest of His
servants," replied Susan Stoddard, and there was no shadow of hypocrisy
in her tones. She went on, almost sorrowfully: "But we are sent to
serve and obey. 'Keep ye separate and apart from the children of this
world,' is His commandment, and I have no choice but to obey. Besides,"
and she looked up fearlessly into Agatha's face, "we do know about
you. It is spoken of by all how you follow a wicked and worldly profession.
You can't touch pitch and not be defiled.

The unusual tone, the startling words, arrested Maggie's sob, and she sat quite still, wondering;
as if Stephen might have seen some possibilities that would alter everything, and annul the
wretched facts.

"See, Maggie, how everything has come without our seeking,--in spite of all our efforts. We
never thought of being alone together again; it has all been done by others. See how the tide
is carrying us out, away from all those unnatural bonds that we have been trying to make faster
round us, and trying in vain. It will carry us on to Torby, and we can land there, and get
some carriage, and hurry on to York and then to Scotland,--and never pause a moment till we
are bound to each other, so that only death can part us. It is the only right thing, dearest;
it is the only way of escaping from this wretched entanglement. Everything has concurred to
point it out to us. We have contrived nothing, we have thought of nothing ourselves."

Stephen spoke with deep, earnest pleading. Maggie listened, passing from her startled wonderment
to the yearning after that belief that the tide was doing it all, that she might glide along
with the swift, silent stream, and not struggle any more. But across that stealing influence
came the terrible shadow of past thoughts; and the sudden horror lest now, at last, the moment
of fatal intoxication was close upon her, called up feelings of angry resistance toward Stephen.

"Let me go!" she said, in an agitated tone, flashing an indignant look at him, and trying to
get her hands free. "You have wanted to deprive me of any choice. You knew we were come too
far; you have dared to take advantage of my thoughtlessness. It is unmanly to bring me into
such a position."

Stung by this reproach, he released her hands, moved back to his former place, and folded his
arms, in a sort of desperation at the difficulty Maggie's words had made present to him. If
she would not consent to go on, he must curse himself for the embarrassment he had led her
into. But the reproach was the unendurable thing; the one thing worse than parting with her
was, that she should feel he had acted unworthily toward her. At last he said, in a tone of
suppressed rage,--

"I didn't notice that we had passed Luckreth till we had got to the next village; and then
it came into my mind that we would go on. I can't justify it; I ought to have told you. It
is enough to make you hate me, since you don't love me well enough to make everything else
indifferent to you, as I do you. Shall I stop the boat and try to get you out here? I'll tell
Lucy that I was mad, and that you hate me; and you shall be clear of me forever. No one can
blame you, because I have behaved unpardonably to you."

Maggie was paralyzed; it was easier to resist Stephen's pleading than this picture he had called
up of himself suffering while she was vindicated; easier even to turn away from his look of
tenderness than from this look of angry misery, that seemed to place her in selfish isolation
from him. He had called up a state of feeling in which the reasons which had acted on her conscience
seemed to be transmitted into mere self-regard. The indignant fire in her eyes was quenched,
and she began to look at him with timid distress. She had reproached him for being hurried
into irrevocable trespass,--she, who had been so weak herself.

"As if I shouldn't feel what happened to you--just the same," she said, with reproach of another
kind,--the reproach of love, asking for more trust. This yielding to the idea of Stephen's
suffering was more fatal than the other yielding, because it was less distinguishable from
that sense of others' claims which was the moral basis of her resistance.

He felt all the relenting in her look and tone; it was heaven opening again. He moved to her
side, and took her hand, leaning his elbow on the back of the boat, and saying nothing. He
dreaded to utter another word, he dreaded to make another movement, that might provoke another
reproach or denial from her. Life hung on her consent; everything else was hopeless, confused,
sickening misery. They glided along in this way, both resting in that silence as in a haven,
both dreading lest their feelings should be divided again,--till they became aware that the
clouds had gathered, and that the slightest perceptible freshening of the breeze was growing
and growing, so that the whole character of the day was altered.

"You will be chill, Maggie, in this thin dress. Let me raise the cloak over your shoulders.
Get up an instant, dearest."

Maggie obeyed; there was an unspeakable charm in being told what to do, and having everything
decided for her. She sat down again covered with the cloak, and Stephen took to his oars again,
making haste; for they must try to get to Torby as fast as they could. Maggie was hardly conscious
of having said or done anything decisive. All yielding is attended with a less vivid consciousness
than resistance; it is the partial sleep of thought; it is the submergence of our own personality
by another. Every influence tended to lull her into acquiescence. That dreamy gliding in the
boat which had lasted for four hours, and had brought some weariness and exhaustion; the recoil
of her fatigued sensations from the impracticable difficulty of getting out of the boat at
this unknown distance from home, and walking for long miles,--all helped to bring her into
more complete subjection to that strong, mysterious charm which made a last parting from Stephen
seem the death of all joy, and made the thought of wounding him like the first touch of the
torturing iron before which resolution shrank. And then there was the present happiness of
being with him, which was enough to absorb all her languid energy.

Presently Stephen observed a vessel coming after them. Several vessels, among them the steamer
to Mudport, had passed them with the early tide, but for the last hour they had seen none.
He looked more and more eagerly at this vessel, as if a new thought had come into his mind
along with it, and then he looked at Maggie hesitatingly.

"Maggie, dearest," he said at last, "if this vessel should be going to Mudport, or to any convenient
place on the coast northward, it would be our best plan to get them to take us on board. You
are fatigued, and it may soon rain; it may be a wretched business, getting to Torby in this
boat. It's only a trading vessel, but I dare say you can be made tolerably comfortable. We'll
take the cushions out of the boat. It is really our best plan. They'll be glad enough to take
us. I've got plenty of money about me. I can pay them well."

Maggie's heart began to beat with reawakened alarm at this new proposition; but she was silent,--one
course seemed as difficult as another.

Stephen hailed the vessel. It was a Dutch vessel going to Mudport, the English mate informed
him, and, if this wind held, would be there in less than two days.

"We had got out too far with our boat," said Stephen. "I was trying to make for Torby. But
I'm afraid of the weather; and this lady--my wife--will be exhausted with fatigue and hunger.
Take us on board--will you?--and haul up the boat. I'll pay you well."

Maggie, now really faint and trembling with fear, was t aken on board, making an interesting
object of contemplation to admiring Dutchmen. The mate feared the lady would have a poor time
of it on board, for they had no accommodation for such entirely unlooked-for passengers,--no
private cabin larger than an old-fashioned church-pew. But at least they had Dutch cleanliness,
which makes all other inconveniences tolerable; and the boat cushions were spread into a couch
for Maggie on the poop with all alacrity. But to pace up and down the deck leaning on Stephen--being
upheld by his strength--was the first change that she needed; then came food, and then quiet
reclining on the cushions, with the sense that no new resolution could be taken that day. Everything
must wait till to-morrow. Stephen sat beside her with her hand in his; they could only speak
to each other in low tones; only look at each other now and then, for it would take a long
while to dull the curiosity of the five men on board, and reduce these handsome young strangers
to that minor degree of interest which belongs, in a sailor's regard, to all objects nearer
than the horizon. But Stephen was triumphantly happy. Every other thought or care was thrown
into unmarked perspective by the certainty that Maggie must be his. The leap had been taken
now; he had been tortured by scruples, he had fought fiercely with overmastering inclination,
he had hesitated; but repentance was impossible. He murmured forth in fragmentary sentences
his happiness, his adoration, his tenderness, his belief that their life together must be heaven,
that her presence with him would give rapture to every common day; that to satisfy her lightest
wish was dearer to him than all other bliss; that everything was easy for her sake, except
to part with her; and now they never would part; he would belong to her forever, and all that
was his was hers,--had no value for him except as it was hers. Such things, uttered in low,
broken tones by the one voice that has first stirred the fibre of young passion, have only
a feeble effect--on experienced minds at a distance from them. To poor Maggie they were very
near; they were like nectar held close to thirsty lips; there was, there must be, then, a life
for mortals here below which was not hard and chill,--in which affection would no longer be
self-sacrifice. Stephen's passionate words made the vision of such a life more fully present
to her than it had ever been before; and the vision for the time excluded all realities,--all
except the returning sun-gleams which broke out on the waters as the evening approached, and
mingled with the visionary sunlight of promised happiness; all except the hand that pressed
hers, and the voice that spoke to her, and the eyes that looked at her with grave, unspeakable
love.

There was to be no rain, after all; the clouds rolled off to the horizon again, making the
great purple rampart and long purple isles of that wondrous land which reveals itself to us
when the sun goes down,--the land that the evening star watches over. Maggie was to sleep all
night on the poop; it was better than going below; and she was covered with the warmest wrappings
the ship could furnish. It was still early, when the fatigues of the day brought on a drowsy
longing for perfect rest, and she laid down her head, looking at the faint, dying flush in
the west, where the one golden lamp was getting brighter and brighter. Then she looked up at
Stephen, who was still seated by her, hanging over her as he leaned his arm against the vessel's
side. Behind all the delicious visions of these last hours, which had flowed over her like
a soft stream, and made her entirely passive, there was the dim consciousness that the condition
was a transient one, and that the morrow must bring back the old life of struggle; that there
were thoughts which would presently avenge themselves for this oblivion. But now nothing was
distinct to her; she was being lulled to sleep with that soft stream still flowing over her,
with those delicious visions melting and fading like the wondrous aerial land of the west.

Chapter XIV

Waking

When Maggie was gone to sleep, Stephen, weary too with his unaccustomed amount of rowing, and
with the intense inward life of the last twelve hours, but too restless to sleep, walked and
lounged about the deck with his cigar far on into midnight, not seeing the dark water, hardly
conscious there were stars, living only in the near and distant future. At last fatigue conquered
restlessness, and he rolled himself up in a piece of tarpaulin on the deck near Maggie's feet.

She had fallen asleep before nine, and had been sleeping for six hours before the faintest
hint of a midsummer daybreak was discernible. She awoke from that vivid dreaming which makes
the margin of our deeper rest. She was in a boat on the wide water with Stephen, and in the
gathering darkness something like a star appeared, that grew and grew till they saw it was
the Virgin seated in St. Ogg's boat, and it came nearer and nearer, till they saw the Virgin
was Lucy and the boatman was Philip,--no, not Philip, but her brother, who rowed past without
looking at her; and she rose to stretch out her arms and call to him, and their own boat turned
over with the movement, and they began to sink, till with one spasm of dread she seemed to
awake, and find she was a child again in the parlor at evening twilight, and Tom was not really
angry. From the soothed sense of that false waking she passed to the real waking,--to the plash
of water against the vessel, and the sound of a footstep on the deck, and the awful starlit
sky. There was a moment of utter bewilderment before her mind could get disentangled from the
confused web of dreams; but soon the whole terrible truth urged itself upon her. Stephen was
not by her now; she was alone with her own memory and her own dread. The irrevocable wrong
that must blot her life had been committed; she had brought sorrow into the lives of others,--into
the lives that were knit up with hers by trust and love. The feeling of a few short weeks had
hurried her into the sins her nature had most recoiled from,--breach of faith and cruel selfishness;
she had rent the ties that had given meaning to duty, and had made herself an outlawed soul,
with no guide but the wayward choice of her own passion. And where would that lead her? Where
had it led her now? She had said she would rather die than fall into that temptation. She felt
it now,--now that the consequences of such a fall had come before the outward act was completed.
There was at least this fruit from all her years of striving after the highest and best,--that
her soul though betrayed, beguiled, ensnared, could never deliberately consent to a choice
of the lower. And a choice of what? O God! not a choice of joy, but of conscious cruelty and
hardness; for could she ever cease to see before her Lucy and Philip, with their murdered trust
and hopes? Her life with Stephen could have no sacredness; she must forever sink and wander
vaguely, driven by uncertain impulse; for she had let go the clue of life,--that clue which
once in the far-off years her young need had clutched so strongly. She had renounced all delights
then, before she knew them, before they had come within her reach. Philip had been right when
he told her that she knew nothing of renunciation; she had thought it was quiet ecstasy; she
saw it face to face now,--that sad, patient, loving strength which holds the clue of life,--and
saw that the thorns were forever pressing on its brow. The yesterday, which could never be
revoked,--if she could have changed it now for any length of inward silent endurance, she would
have bowed beneath that cross with a sense of rest.

Day break came and the reddening eastern light, while her past life was grasping her in this
way, with that tightening clutch which comes in the last moments of possible rescue. She could
see Stephen now lying on the deck still fast asleep, and with the sight of him there came a
wave of anguish that found its way in a long-suppressed sob. The worst bitterness of parting--the
thought that urged the sharpest inward cry for help--was the pain it must give to him. But
surmounting everything was the horror at her own possible failure, the dread lest her conscience
should be benumbed again, and not rise to energy till it was too late. Too late! it was too
late already not to have caused misery; too late for everything, perhaps, but to rush away
from the last act of baseness,--the tasting of joys that were wrung from crushed hearts.

The sun was rising now, and Maggie started up with the sense that a day of resistance was beginning
for her. Her eyelashes were still wet with tears, as, with her shawl over her head, she sat
looking at the slowly rounding sun. Something roused Stephen too, and getting up from his hard
bed, he came to sit beside her. The sharp instinct of anxious love saw something to give him
alarm in the very first glance. He had a hovering dread of some resistance in Maggie's nature
that he would be unable to overcome. He had the uneasy consciousness that he had robbed her
of perfect freedom yesterday; there was too much native honor in him, for him not to feel that,
if her will should recoil, his conduct would have been odious, and she would have a right to
reproach him.

But Maggie did not feel that right; she was too conscious of fatal weakness in herself, too
full of the tenderness that comes with the foreseen need for inflicting a wound. She let him
take her hand when he came to sit down beside her, and smiled at him, only with rather a sad
glance; she could say nothing to pain him till the moment of possible parting was nearer. And
so they drank their cup of coffee together, and walked about the deck, and heard the captain's
assurance that they should be in at Mudport by five o'clock, each with an inward burthen; but
in him it was an undefined fear, which he trusted to the coming hours to dissipate; in her
it was a definite resolve on which she was trying silently to tighten her hold. Stephen was
continually, through the morning, expressing his anxiety at the fatigue and discomfort she
was suffering, and alluded to landing and to the change of motion and repose she would have
in a carriage, wanting to assure himself more completely by presupposing that everything would
be as he had arranged it. For a long while Maggie contented herself with assuring him that
she had had a good night's rest, and that she didn't mind about being on the vessel,--it was
not like being on the open sea, it was only a little less pleasant than being in a boat on
the Floss. But a suppressed resolve will betray itself in the eyes, and Stephen became more
and more uneasy as the day advanced, under the sense that Maggie had entirely lost her passiveness.
He longed, but did not dare, to speak of their marriage, of where they would go after it, and
the steps he would take to inform his father, and the rest, of what had happened. He longed
to assure himself of a tacit assent from her. But each time he looked at her, he gathered a
stronger dread of the new, quiet sadness with which she met his eyes. And they were more and
more silent.

"Here we are in sight of Mudport," he said at last. "Now, dearest," he added, turning toward
her with a look that was half beseeching, "the worst part of your fatigue is over. On the land
we can command swiftness. In another hour and a half we shall be in a chaise together, and
that will seem rest to you after this."

Maggie felt it was time to speak; it would only be unkind now to assent by silence. She spoke
in the lowest tone, as he had done, but with distinct decision.

"We shall not be together; we shall have parted."

The blood rushed to Stephen's face.

"We shall not," he said. "I'll die first."

It was as he had dreaded--there was a struggle coming. But neither of them dared to say another
word till the boat was let down, and they were taken to the landing-place. Here there was a
cluster of gazers and passengers awaiting the departure of the steamboat to St. Ogg's. Maggie
had a dim sense, when she had landed, and Stephen was hurrying her along on his arm, that some
one had advanced toward her from that cluster as if he were coming to speak to her. But she
was hurried along, and was indifferent to everything but the coming trial.

A porter guided them to the nearest inn and posting-house, and Stephen gave the order for the
chaise as they passed through the yard. Maggie took no notice of this, and only said, "Ask
them to show us into a room where we can sit down."

When they entered, Maggie did not sit down, and Stephen, whose face had a desperate determination
in it, was about to ring the bell, when she said, in a firm voice,--

"I'm not going; we must part here."

"Maggie," he said, turning round toward her, and speaking in the tones of a man who feels a
process of torture beginning, "do you mean to kill me? What is the use of it now? The whole
thing is done."

"No, it is not done," said Maggie. "Too much is done,--more than we can ever remove the trace
of. But I will go no farther. Don't try to prevail with me again. I couldn't choose yesterday."

What was he to do? He dared not go near her; her anger might leap out, and make a new barrier.
He walked backward and forward in maddening perplexity.

"Maggie," he said at last, pausing before her, and speaking in a tone of imploring wretchedness,
"have some pity--hear me--forgive me for what I did yesterday. I will obey you now; I will
do nothing without your full consent. But don't blight our lives forever by a rash perversity
that can answer no good purpose to any one, that can only create new evils. Sit down, dearest;
wait--think what you are going to do. Don't treat me as if you couldn't trust me."

He had chosen the most effective appeal; but Maggie's will was fixed unswervingly on the coming
wrench. She had made up her mind to suffer.

"We must not wait," she said, in a low but distinct voice; "we must part at once."

"We can't part, Maggie," said Stephen, more impetuously. "I can't bear it. What is the use
of inflicting that misery on me? The blow--whatever it may have been--has been struck now.
Will it help any one else that you should drive me mad?"

"I will not begin any future, even for you," said Maggie, tremulously, "with a deliberate consent
to what ought not to have been. What I told you at Basset I feel now; I would rather have died
than fall into this temptation. It would have been better if we had parted forever then. But
we must part now."

"We will not part," Stephen burst out, instinctively placing his back against the door, forgetting
everything he had said a few moments before; "I will not endure it. You'll make me desperate;
I sha'n't know what I do."

Maggie trembled. She felt that the parting could not be effected suddenly. She must rely on
a slower appeal to Stephen's better self; she must be prepared for a harder task than that
of rushing away while resolution was fresh. She sat down. Stephen, watching her with that look
of desperation which had come over him like a lurid light, approached slowly from the door,
seated himself close beside her, and grasped her hand. Her heart beat like the heart of a frightened
bird; but this direct opposition helped her. She felt her determination growing stronger.

"Remember what you felt weeks ago," she began, with beseeching earnestness; "remember what
we both felt,--that we owed ourselves to others, and must conquer every inclination which could
make us false to that debt. We have failed to keep our resolutions; but the wrong remains the
same."

"No, it does not remain the same," said Stephen. "We have proved that it was impossible to
keep our resolutions. We have proved that the feeling which draws us toward each other is too
strong to be overcome. That natural law surmounts every other; we can't help what it clashes with."

"It is not so, Stephen; I'm quite sure that is wrong. I have tried to think it again and again;
but I see, if we judged in that way, there would be a warrant for all treachery and cruelty;
we should justify breaking the most sacred ties that can ever be formed on earth. If the past
is not to bind us, where can duty lie? We should have no law but the inclination of the moment."

"But there are ties that can't be kept by mere resolution," said Stephen, starting up and walking
about again. "What is outward faithfulness? Would they have thanked us for anything so hollow
as constancy without love?"

Maggie did not answer immediately. She was undergoing an inward as well as an outward contest.
At last she said, with a passionate assertion of her conviction, as much against herself as
against him,--

"That seems right--at first; but when I look further, I'm sure it is not right. Faithfulness
and constancy mean something else besides doing what is easiest and pleasantest to ourselves.
They mean renouncing whatever is opposed to the reliance others have in us,--whatever would
cause misery to those whom the course of our lives has made dependent on us. If we--if I had
been better, nobler, those claims would have been so strongly present with me,--I should have
felt them pressing on my heart so continually, just as they do now in the moments when my conscience
is awake,--that the opposite feeling would never have grown in me, as it has done; it would
have been quenched at once, I should have prayed for help so earnestly, I should have rushed
away as we rush from hideous danger. I feel no excuse for myself, none. I should never have
failed toward Lucy and Philip as I have done, if I had not been weak, selfish, and hard,--able
to think of their pain without a pain to myself that would have destroyed all temptation. Oh,
what is Lucy feeling now? She believed in me--she loved me--she was so good to me. Think of
her----"

Maggie's voice was getting choked as she uttered these last words.

"I can't think of her," said Stephen, stamping as if with pain. "I can think of nothing but
you, Maggie. You demand of a man what is impossible. I felt that once; but I can't go back
to it now. And where is the use of your thinking of it, except to torture me? You can't save
them from pain now; you can only tear yourself from me, and make my life worthless to me. And
even if we could go back, and both fulfil our engagements,--if that were possible now,--it
would be hateful, horrible, to think of your ever being Philip's wife,--of your ever being
the wife of a man you didn't love. We have both been rescued from a mistake."

A deep flush came over Maggie's face, and she couldn't speak. Stephen saw this. He sat down
again, taking her hand in his, and looking at her with passionate entreaty.

"Maggie! Dearest! If you love me, you are mine. Who can have so great a claim on you as I have?
My life is bound up in your love. There is nothing in the past that can annul our right to
each other; it is the first time we have either of us loved with our whole heart and soul."

Maggie was still silent for a little while, looking down. Stephen was in a flutter of new hope;
he was going to triumph. But she raised her eyes and met his with a glance that was filled
with the anguish of regret, not with yielding.

"No, not with my whole heart and soul, Stephen," she said with timid resolution. "I have never
consented to it with my whole mind. There are memories, and affections, and longings after
perfect goodness, that have such a strong hold on me; they would never quit me for long; they
would come back and be pain to me--repentance. I couldn't live in peace if I put the shadow
of a wilful sin between myself and God. I have caused sorrow already--I know--I feel it; but
I have never deliberately consented to it; I have never said, 'They shall suffer, that I may
have joy.' It has never been my will to marry you; if you were to win consent from the momentary
triumph of my feeling for you, you would not have my whole soul. If I could wake back again
into the time before yesterday, I would choose to be true to my calmer affections, and live
without the joy of love."

Stephen loosed her hand, and rising impatiently, walked up and down the room in suppressed rage.

"Good God!" he burst out at last, "what a miserable thing a woman's love is to a man's! I could
commit crimes for you,--and you can balance and choose in that way. But you don't love me;
if you had a tithe of the feeling for me that I have for you, it would be impossible to you
to think for a moment of sacrificing me. But it weighs nothing with you that you are robbing
me of my life's happiness."

Maggie pressed her fingers together almost convulsively as she held them clasped on her lap.
A great terror was upon her, as if she were ever and anon seeing where she stood by great flashes
of lightning, and then again stretched forth her hands in the darkness.

"No, I don't sacrifice you--I couldn't sacrifice you," she said, as soon as she could speak
again; "but I can't believe in a good for you, that I feel, that we both feel, is a wrong toward
others. We can't choose happiness either for ourselves or for another; we can't tell where
that will lie. We can only choose whether we will indulge ourselves in the present moment,
or whether we will renounce that, for the sake of obeying the divine voice within us,--for
the sake of being true to all the motives that sanctify our lives. I know this belief is hard;
it has slipped away from me again and again; but I have felt that if I let it go forever, I
should have no light through the darkness of this life."

"But, Maggie," said Stephen, seating himself by her again, "is it possible you don't see that
what happened yesterday has altered the whole position of things? What infatuation is it, what
obstinate prepossession, that blinds you to that? It is too late to say what we might have
done or what we ought to have done. Admitting the very worst view of what has been done, it
is a fact we must act on now; our position is altered; the right course is no longer what it
was before. We must accept our own actions and start afresh from them. Suppose we had been
married yesterday? It is nearly the same thing. The effect on others would not have been different.
It would only have made this difference to ourselves," Stephen added bitterly, "that you might
have acknowledged then that your tie to me was stronger than to others."

Again a deep flush came over Maggie's face, and she was silent. Stephen thought again that
he was beginning to prevail,--he had never yet believed that he should not prevail; there are
possibilities which our minds shrink from too completely for us to fear them.

"Dearest," he said, in his deepest, tenderest tone, leaning toward her, and putting his arm
round her, "you are mine now,--the world believes it; duty must spring out of that now.

"In a few hours you will be legally mine, and those who had claims on us will submit,--they
will see that there was a force which declared against their claims."

Maggie's eyes opened wide in one terrified look at the face that was close to hers, and she
started up, pale again.

"Oh, I can't do it," she said, in a voice almost of agony; "Stephen, don't ask me--don't urge
me. I can't argue any longer,--I don't know what is wise; but my heart will not let me do it.
I see,--I feel their trouble now; it is as if it were branded on my mind. I have suffered,
and had no one to pity me; and now I have made others suffer. It would never leave me; it would
embitter your love to me. I do care for Philip--in a different way; I remember all we said
to each other; I know how he thought of me as the one promise of his life. He was given to
me that I might make his lot less hard; and I have forsaken him. And Lucy--she has been deceived;
she who trusted me more than any one. I cannot marry you; I cannot take a good for myself that
has been wrung out of their misery. Now the advantage of coming along with me--(His eyes close
once more--the Excursionists implore him to attend to his team.) You will thoroughly understand
there is not the slightest cause to apprehend any danger. I've driven this car fifteen years
without least accident--up to present.

So you can devote your whole attention to the scenery, without needing to keep an eye upon the
Driver. (He points to the abyss.) That is the shortest way down--on this occasion, however,
I shall endeavour not to take it.

(He whips up his horses, and accomplishes the descent at a brisk pace.) There, didn't I tell
you there wouldn't be no accident? Very well, then. P'rhaps you'll believe me another time!

We've had a remarkably lucky escape--I never felt more thankful in my life!

We've got to get back--and he's bound to be worse after he's had
his lunch!

[The M.M.'s appetite for lobster is entirely destroyed by this sinister
prediction; but whether the Driver has been unjustly maligned, or
whether he has sobered himself in the interval--he reappears in a
more sedentary, and less discursive mood, and the journey home proves
agreeably devoid of sensation.

SIMPLE STORIES.
"Be always kind to animals wherever you may be."

RUBY AND THE ROOK.

RUBY,
although she was something of a tomboy, was a pretty and clever girl.

But,
like many pretty and clever little ladies, she was sometimes very
naughty. When she was good, she was as good as gold, but when she
was naughty, she was as naughty as pinchbeck.

The other day, when
her dear Mamma was away for the morning, it happened to be one of
her pinchbeck times. But she could ask nothing yet; she only got into the coach.

Home--where her mother and brother were, Philip, Lucy, the scene of her very cares and trials--was
the haven toward which her mind tended; the sanctuary where sacred relics lay, where she would
be rescued from more falling. The thought of Stephen was like a horrible throbbing pain, which
yet, as such pains do, seemed to urge all other thoughts into activity. But among her thoughts,
what others would say and think of her conduct was hardly present. Love and deep pity and remorseful
anguish left no room for that.

The coach was taking her to York, farther away from home; but she did not learn that until
she was set down in the old city at midnight. It was no matter; she could sleep there, and
start home the next day. She had her purse in her pocket, with all her money in it,--a bank-note
and a sovereign; she had kept it in her pocket from forgetfulness, after going out to make
purchases the day before yesterday.

Did she lie down in the gloomy bedroom of the old inn that night with her will bent unwaveringly
on the path of penitent sacrifice? The great struggles of life are not so easy as that; the
great problems of life are not so clear. In the darkness of that night she saw Stephen's face
turned toward her in passionate, reproachful misery; she lived through again all the tremulous
delights of his presence with her that made existence an easy floating in a stream of joy,
instead of a quiet resolved endurance and effort. The love she had renounced came back upon
her with a cruel charm; she felt herself opening her arms to receive it once more; and then
it seemed to slip away and fade and vanish, leaving only the dying sound of a deep, thrilling
voice that said, "Gone, forever gone."

Book VII

The Final Rescue

Chapter I

The Return to the Mill

Between four and five o'clock on the afternoon of the fifth day from that on which Stephen
and Maggie had left St. Ogg's, Tom Tulliver was standing on the gravel walk outside the old
house at Dorlcote Mill. He was master there now; he had half fulfilled his father's dying wish,
and by years of steady self-government and energetic work he had brought himself near to the
attainment of more than the old respectability which had been the proud inheritance of the
Dodsons and Tullivers.

But Tom's face, as he stood in the hot, still sunshine of that summer afternoon, had no gladness,
no triumph in it. His mouth wore its bitterest expression, his severe brow its hardest and
deepest fold, as he drew down his hat farther over his eyes to shelter them from the sun, and
thrusting his hands deep into his pockets, began to walk up and down the gravel. No news of
his sister had been heard since Bob Jakin had come back in the steamer from Mudport, and put
an end to all improbable suppositions of an accident on the water by stating that he had seen
her land from a vessel with Mr. Stephen Guest. Would the next news be that she was married,--or
what? Probably that she was not married; Tom's mind was set to the expectation of the worst
that could happen,--not death, but disgrace.

As he was walking with his back toward the entrance gate, and his face toward the rushing mill-stream,
a tall, dark-eyed figure, that we know well, approached the gate, and paused to look at him
with a fast-beating heart. Her brother was the human being of whom she had been most afraid
from her childhood upward; afraid with that fear which springs in us when we love one who is
inexorable, unbending, unmodifiable, with a mind that we can never mould ourselves upon, and
yet that we cannot endure to alienate from us.

That deep-rooted fear was shaking Maggie now; but her mind was unswervingly bent on returning
to her brother, as the natural refuge that had been given her. In her deep humiliation under
the retrospect of her own weakness,--in her anguish at the injury she had inflicted,--she almost
desired to endure the severity of Tom's reproof, to submit in patient silence to that harsh,
disapproving judgment against which she had so often rebelled; it seemed no more than just
to her now,--who was weaker than she was? She craved that outward help to her better purpose
which would come from complete, submissive confession; from being in the presence of those
whose looks and words would be a reflection of her own conscience.

Maggie had been kept on her bed at York for a day with that prostrating headache which was
likely to follow on the terrible strain of the previous day and night. There was an expression
of physical pain still about her brow and eyes, and her whole appearance, with her dress so
long unchanged, was worn and distressed. She lifted the latch of the gate and walked in slowly.
Tom did not hear the gate; he was just then close upon the roaring dam; but he presently turned,
and lifting up his eyes, saw the figure whose worn look and loneliness seemed to him a confirmation
of his worst conjectures. He paused, trembling and white with disgust and indignation.

Maggie paused too, three yards before him. She felt the hatred in his face, felt it rushing
through her fibres; but she must speak.

"Tom," she began faintly, "I am come back to you,--I am come back home--for refuge--to tell
you everything."

"You will find no home with me," he answered, with tremulous rage. "You have disgraced us all.
You have disgraced my father's name. You have been a curse to your best friends. You have been
base, deceitful; no motives are strong enough to restrain you. I wash my hands of you forever.
You don't belong to me."

Their mother had come to the door now. She stood paralyzed by the double shock of seeing Maggie
and hearing Tom's words.

"Tom," said Maggie, with more courage, "I am perhaps not so guilty as you believe me to be.
I never meant to give way to my feelings. I struggled against them. I was carried too far in
the boat to come back on Tuesday. I came back as soon as I could."

"I can't believe in you any more," said Tom, gradually passing from the tremulous excitement
of the first moment to cold inflexibility. "You have been carrying on a clandestine relation
with Stephen Guest,--as you did before with another. He went to see you at my aunt Moss's;
you walked alone with him in the lanes; you must have behaved as no modest girl would have
done to her cousin's lover, else that could never have happened. The people at Luckreth saw
you pass; you passed all the other places; you knew what you were doing. You have been using
Philip Wakem as a screen to deceive Lucy,--the kindest friend you ever had. Go and see the
return you have made her. To express the double flavour of this essence requires, I should say,
a subtler and more elaborate method than Mr. W. RILEY has attempted
to use in A Yorkshire Suburb (JENKINS).

He has imagined for the purpose of these sketches an architect, Murgatroyd, who in planning most
of the houses in the locality has attempted to express in brick and
stone the characters of their several occupants.

This is a device which becomes rather monotonous as the book proceeds, besides imposing a series
of strains which neither architecture nor credulity can easily bear. Since these are rather
superior suburbanites, dialect is for the most part absent, and it
is hard to feel that they are very different people from those who
live about the borders of Manchester or London; a character like Mrs.
Flitch, for instance, who is angelic to behold but a spiteful gossip
at heart, is, alas! to be found anywhere.

And where the dialect does crop out it does not seem to be dependent on suburban soil for its raciness.
I don't doubt the accuracy of Mr. RILEY'S Yorkshiremanship, but I do think he has under-estimated
the difficulty of localising the peculiar genius of villadom.

Though billed by her publisher as a merciless analyst, Mrs. MORDAUNT is really (if you want to
fling this kind of title about) an eclectic synthetist or synthetic symbolist. Her wicked
people are prodigiously wicked, wickedness personified, in fact;
her good folk are noble-hearted without stint or measure.

I don't personally think that anybody could be quite so completely and gratuitously evil as
good-looking Charles Hoyland in The Little Soul (HUTCHINSON); or,
being so, could possibly be recommended, still less engaged, as tutor
to a sensitive youth; or, being so engaged, tolerated for two days.

He certainly could not hold down his job long enough to corrupt his
pupil, Anthony Clayton, by exchanging souls with him under the nose
of mad but perceptive Mrs. Clayton and sane sister Diana.

This conspicuously chaste Diana is an attractive person, and so is the recklessly charitable
Dr. McCabe, her appropriate mate, who first had to fly the country
through helping a chorus-girl out of a difficulty and then (more or
less) won the War by revolutionising bacteriology or something like
that.

However, Mrs. MORDAUNT interests because she is so palpably interested
herself.

* * * * *

The scenes of Lure of Contraband (JARROLDS) are laid in the Devonshire of some hundred years ago.
It is, as its title suggests, a tale of smuggling, and it contains
an account of a hand-to-hand fight between the hero and the villain
which I advise all members of the National Sporting Club to read.

They may be shocked by the tactics of the villain, but at the same time they will see what
a bout of fisticuffs meant in those days.

Mr. J. WEARE GIFFARD is a master of atmosphere, and I, at any rate, lived happily in his Appledore,
and imagined myself drinking prime (and cheap) French brandy in the
Beaver Inn; while Lieutenant Perkins, who commanded the "preventive
men," sat in his tall-backed chair by the fireplace and kept his eyes
and ears open to detect anything that was suspicious.

But he was not foolish enough to ask many questions about the French brandy. An excellent yarn,
simply and straight-forwardly told.

* * * * *

* * * *

*

So that when he opened the door and saw Maggie standing before him in her sorrow and weariness,
he had no questions to ask except one which he dared only ask himself,--where was Mr. Stephen
Guest? Bob, for his part, hoped he might be in the warmest department of an asylum understood
to exist in the other world for gentlemen who are likely to be in fallen circumstances there.

The lodgings were vacant, and both Mrs. Jakin the larger and Mrs. Jakin the less were commanded
to make all things comfortable for "the old Missis and the young Miss"; alas that she was still
"Miss!" The ingenious Bob was sorely perplexed as to how this result could have come about;
how Mr. Stephen Guest could have gone away from her, or could have let her go away from him,
when he had the chance of keeping her with him. But he was silent, and would not allow his
wife to ask him a question; would not present himself in the room, lest it should appear like
intrusion and a wish to pry; having the same chivalry toward dark-eyed Maggie as in the days
when he had bought her the memorable present of books.

But after a day or two Mrs. Tulliver was gone to the Mill again for a few hours to see to Tom's
household matters. Maggie had wished this; after the first violent outburst of feeling which
came as soon as she had no longer any active purpose to fulfil, she was less in need of her
mother's presence; she even desired to be alone with her grief. But she had been solitary only
a little while in the old sitting-room that looked on the river, when there came a tap at the
door, and turning round her sad face as she said "Come in," she saw Bob enter, with the baby
in his arms and Mumps at his heels.

"We'll go back, if it disturbs you, Miss," said Bob.

"No," said Maggie, in a low voice, wishing she could smile.

Bob, closing the door behind him, came and stood before her.

"You see, we've got a little un, Miss, and I want'd you to look at it, and take it in your
arms, if you'd be so good. For we made free to name it after you, and it 'ud be better for
your takin' a bit o' notice on it."

Maggie could not speak, but she put out her arms to receive the tiny baby, while Mumps snuffed
at it anxiously, to ascertain that this transference was all right. Maggie's heart had swelled
at this action and speech of Bob's; she knew well enough that it was a way he had chosen to
show his sympathy and respect.

"Sit down, Bob," she said presently, and he sat down in silence, finding his tongue unmanageable
in quite a new fashion, refusing to say what he wanted it to say.

"Bob," she said, after a few moments, looking down at the baby, and holding it anxiously, as
if she feared it might slip from her mind and her fingers, "I have a favor to ask of you."

"Don't you speak so, Miss," said Bob, grasping the skin of Mumps's neck; "if there's anything
I can do for you, I should look upon it as a day's earnings."

"I want you to go to Dr. Kenn's, and ask to speak to him, and tell him that I am here, and
should be very grateful if he would come to me while my mother is away. She will not come back
till evening."

"Eh, Miss, I'd do it in a minute,--it is but a step,--but Dr. Kenn's wife lies dead; she's
to be buried to-morrow; died the day I come from Mudport. It's all the more pity she should
ha' died just now, if you want him. I hardly like to go a-nigh him yet."

"Oh no, Bob," said Maggie, "we must let it be,--till after a few days, perhaps, when you hear
that he is going about again. But perhaps he may be going out of town--to a distance," she
added, with a new sense of despondency at this idea.

"Not he, Miss," said Bob. "He'll none go away. He isn't one o' them gentlefolks as go to cry
at waterin'-places when their wives die; he's got summat else to do. He looks fine and sharp
after the parish, he does. He christened the little un; an' he was at me to know what I did
of a Sunday, as I didn't come to church. But I told him I was upo' the travel three parts o'
the Sundays,--an' then I'm so used to bein' on my legs, I can't sit so long on end,--'an' lors,
sir,' says I, 'a packman can do wi' a small 'lowance o' church; it tastes strong,' says I;
'there's no call to lay it on thick.' Eh, Miss, how good the little un is wi' you! It's like
as if it knowed you; it partly does, I'll be bound,--like the birds know the mornin'."

Bob's tongue was now evidently loosed from its unwonted bondage, and might even be in danger
of doing more work than was required of it. But the subjects on which he longed to be informed
were so steep and difficult of approach, that his tongue was likely to run on along the level
rather than to carry him on that unbeaten road. He felt this, and was silent again for a little
while, ruminating much on the possible forms in which he might put a question. At last he said,
in a more timid voice than usual,--

"Will you give me leave to ask you only one thing, Miss?"

Maggie was rather startled, but she answered, "Yes, Bob, if it is about myself--not about any
one else."

"Well, Miss, it's this. Do you owe anybody a grudge?"

"No, not any one," said Maggie, looking up at him inquiringly. "Why?"

"Oh, lors, Miss," said Bob, pinching Mumps's neck harder than ever. "I wish you did, an' tell
me; I'd leather him till I couldn't see--I would--an' the Justice might do what he liked to
me arter."

"Oh, Bob," said Maggie, smiling faintly, "you're a very good friend to me. But I shouldn't
like to punish any one, even if they'd done me wrong; I've done wrong myself too often."

This view of things was puzzling to Bob, and threw more obscurity than ever over what could
possibly have happened between Stephen and Maggie. But further questions would have been too
intrusive, even if he could have framed them suitably, and he was obliged to carry baby away
again to an expectant mother.

"Happen you'd like Mumps for company, Miss," he said when he had taken the baby again. "He's
rare company, Mumps is; he knows iverything, an' makes no bother about it. If I tell him, he'll
lie before you an' watch you, as still,--just as he watches my pack. You'd better let me leave
him a bit; he'll get fond on you. Lors, it's a fine thing to hev a dumb brute fond on you;
it'll stick to you, an' make no jaw."

"Yes, do leave him, please," said Maggie. "I think I should like to have Mumps for a friend."

"Mumps, lie down there," said Bob, pointing to a place in front of Maggie, "and niver do you
stir till you're spoke to."

Mumps lay down at once, and made no sign of restlessness when his master left the room.

Chapter II

St. Ogg's Passes Judgment

It was soon known throughout St. Ogg's that Miss Tulliver was come back; she had not, then,
eloped in order to be married to Mr. Stephen Guest,--at all events, Mr. Stephen Guest had not
married her; which came to the same thing, so far as her culpability was concerned. We judge
others according to results; how else?--not knowing the process by which results are arrived
at. If Miss Tulliver, after a few months of well-chosen travel, had returned as Mrs. Stephen
Guest, with a post-marital trousseau, and all the advantages possessed even by the most unwelcome
wife of an only son, public opinion, which at St. Ogg's, as else where, always knew what to
think, would have judged in strict consistency with those results. Public opinion, in these
cases, is always of the feminine gender,--not the world, but the world's wife; and she would
have seen that two handsome young people--the gentleman of quite the first family in St. Ogg's--having
found themselves in a false position, had been led into a course which, to say the least of
it, was highly injudicious, and productive of sad pain and disappointment, especially to that
sweet young thing, Miss Deane. Mr. Stephen Guest had certainly not behaved well; but then,
young men were liable to those sudden infatuated attachments; and bad as it might seem in Mrs.
Stephen Guest to admit the faintest advances from her cousin's lover (indeed it had been said
that she was actually engaged to young Wakem,--old Wakem himself had mentioned it), still,
she was very young,--"and a deformed young man, you know!--and young Guest so very fascinating;
and, they say, he positively worships her (to be sure, that can't last!), and he ran away with
her in the boat quite against her will, and what could she do? She couldn't come back then;
no one would have spoken to her; and how very well that maize-colored satinette becomes her
complexion! It seems as if the folds in front were quite come in; several of her dresses are
made so,--they say he thinks nothing too handsome to buy for her. Poor Miss Deane! She is very
pitiable; but then there was no positive engagement; and the air at the coast will do her good.
After all, if young Guest felt no more for her than that it was better for her not to marry
him. What a wonderful marriage for a girl like Miss Tulliver,--quite romantic? Why, young Guest
will put up for the borough at the next election. Nothing like commerce nowadays! That young
Wakem nearly went out of his mind; he always was rather queer; but he's gone abroad again to
be out of the way,--quite the best thing for a deformed young man. Miss Unit declares she will
never visit Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Guest,--such nonsense! pretending to be better than other
people. Society couldn't be carried on if we inquired into private conduct in that way,--and
Christianity tells us to think no evil,--and my belief is, that Miss Unit had no cards sent her."

But the results, we know, were not of a kind to warrant this extenuation of the past. Maggie
had returned without a trousseau, without a husband,--in that degraded and outcast condition
to which error is well known to lead; and the world's wife, with that fine instinct which is
given her for the preservation of Society, saw at once that Miss Tulliver's conduct had been
of the most aggravated kind. Could anything be more detestable? A girl so much indebted to
her friends--whose mother as well as herself had received so much kindness from the Deanes--to
lay the design of winning a young man's affections away from her own cousin, who had behaved
like a sister to her! Winning his affections? That was not the phrase for such a girl as Miss
Tulliver; it would have been more correct to say that she had been actuated by mere unwomanly
boldness and unbridled passion. There was always something questionable about her. That connection
with young Wakem, which, they said, had been carried on for years, looked very ill,--disgusting,
in fact! But with a girl of that disposition! To the world's wife there had always been something
in Miss Tulliver's very physique that a refined instinct felt to be prophetic of harm. As for
poor Mr. Stephen Guest, he was rather pitiable than otherwise; a young man of five-and-twenty
is not to be too severely judged in these cases,--he is really very much at the mercy of a
designing, bold girl. And it was clear that he had given way in spite of himself: he had shaken
her off as soon as he could; indeed, their having parted so soon looked very black indeed--for
her. To be sure, he had written a letter, laying all the blame on himself, and telling the
story in a romantic fashion so as to try and make her appear quite innocent; of course he would
do that! But the refined instinct of the world's wife was not to be deceived; providentially!--else
what would become of Society? Why, her own brother had turned her from his door; he had seen
enough, you might be sure, before he would do that. A truly respectable young man, Mr. Tom
Tulliver; quite likely to rise in the world! His sister's disgrace was naturally a heavy blow
to him. It was to be hoped that she would go out of the neighborhood,--to America, or anywhere,--so
as to purify the air of St. Ogg's from the stain of her presence, extremely dangerous to daughters
there! No good could happen to her; it was only to be hoped she would repent, and that God
would have mercy on her: He had not the care of society on His hands, as the world's wife had.

It required nearly a fortnight for fine instinct to assure itself of these inspirations; indeed,
it was a whole week before Stephen's letter came, telling his father the facts, and adding
that he was gone across to Holland,--had drawn upon the agent at Mudport for money,--was incapable
of any resolution at present.

Maggie, all this while, was too entirely filled with a more agonizing anxiety to spend any
thought on the view that was being taken of her conduct by the world of St. Ogg's; anxiety
about Stephen, Lucy, Philip, beat on her poor heart in a hard, driving, ceaseless storm of
mingled love, remorse, and pity. If she had thought of rejection and injustice at all, it would
have seemed to her that they had done their worst; that she could hardly feel any stroke from
them intolerable since the words she had heard from her brother's lips. Across all her anxiety
for the loved and the injured, those words shot again and again, like a horrible pang that
would have brought misery and dread even into a heaven of delights. The idea of ever recovering
happiness never glimmered in her mind for a moment; it seemed as if every sensitive fibre in
her were too entirely preoccupied by pain ever to vibrate again to another influence. Life
stretched before her as one act of penitence; and all she craved, as she dwelt on her future
lot, was something to guarantee her from more falling; her own weakness haunted her like a
vision of hideous possibilities, that made no peace conceivable except such as lay in the sense
of a sure refuge.

But she was not without practical intentions; the love of independence was too strong an inheritance
and a habit for her not to remember that she must get her bread; and when other projects looked
vague, she fell back on that of returning to her plain sewing, and so getting enough to pay
for her lodging at Bob's. She meant to persuade her mother to return to the Mill by and by,
and live with Tom again; and somehow or other she would maintain herself at St. Ogg's. Dr.
Kenn would perhaps help her and advise her. She remembered his parting words at the bazaar.
She remembered the momentary feeling of reliance that had sprung in her when he was talking
with her, and she waited with yearning expectation for the opportunity of confiding everything
to him. Her mother called every day at Mr. Deane's to learn how Lucy was; the report was always
sad,--nothing had yet roused her from the feeble passivity which had come on with the first
shock. But of Philip, Mrs. Tulliver had learned nothing; naturally, no one whom she met would
speak to her about what related to her daughter. But at last she summoned courage to go and
see sister Glegg, who of course would know everything, and had been even to see Tom at the
Mill in Mrs. Tulliver's absence, though he had said nothing of what had passed on the occasion.

As soon as her mother was gone, Maggie put on her bonnet. She had resolved on walking to the
Rectory and asking to see Dr. Kenn; he was in deep grief, but the grief of another does not
jar upon us in such circumstances. It was the first time she had been beyond the door since
her return; nevertheless her mind was so bent on the purpose of her walk, that the unpleasantness
of meeting people on the way, and being stared at, did not occur to her. But she had no sooner
passed beyond the narrower streets which she had to thread from Bob's dwelling, than she became
aware of unusual glances cast at her; and this consciousness made her hurry along nervously,
afraid to look to right or left. Presently, however, she came full on Mrs. and Miss Turnbull,
old acquaintances of her family; they both looked at her strangely, and turned a little aside
without speaking. All hard looks were pain to Maggie, but her self-reproach was too strong
for resentment. No wonder they will not speak to me, she thought; they are very fond of Lucy.
But now she knew that she was about to pass a group of gentlemen, who were standing at the
door of the billiard-rooms, and she could not help seeing young Torry step out a little with
his glass at his eye, and bow to her with that air of nonchalance which he might have bestowed
on a friendly barmaid.

Maggie's pride was too intense for her not to feel that sting, even in the midst of her sorrow;
and for the first time the thought took strong hold of her that she would have other obloquy
cast on her besides that which was felt to be due to her breach of faith toward Lucy. But she
was at the Rectory now; there, perhaps, she would find something else than retribution. Retribution
may come from any voice; the hardest, cruelest, most imbruted urchin at the street-corner can
inflict it; surely help and pity are rarer things, more needful for the righteous to bestow.

She was shown up at once, after being announced, into Dr. Kenn's study, where he sat amongst
piled-up books, for which he had little appetite, leaning his cheek against the head of his
youngest child, a girl of three. The child was sent away with the servant, and when the door
was closed, Dr. Kenn said, placing a chair for Maggie,--

"I was coming to see you, Miss Tulliver; you have anticipated me; I am glad you did."

Maggie looked at him with her childlike directness as she had done at the bazaar, and said,
"I want to tell you everything." But her eyes filled fast with tears as she said it, and all
the pent-up excitement of her humiliating walk would have its vent before she could say more.

"Do tell me everything," Dr. Kenn said, with quiet kindness in his grave, firm voice. "Think
of me as one to whom a long experience has been granted, which may enable him to help you."

In rather broken sentences, and with some effort at first, but soon with the greater ease that
came from a sense of relief in the confidence, Maggie told the brief story of a struggle that
must be the beginning of a long sorrow. Only the day before, Dr. Kenn had been made acquainted
with the contents of Stephen's letter, and he had believed them at once, without the confirmation
of Maggie's statement. That involuntary plaint of hers, "Oh, I must go," had remained with
him as the sign that she was undergoing some inward conflict.

Maggie dwelt the longest on the feeling which had made her come back to her mother and brother,
which made her cling to all the memories of the past. When she had ended, Dr. Kenn was silent
for some minutes; there was a difficulty on his mind. He rose, and walked up and down the hearth
with his hands behind him. At last he seated himself again, and said, looking at Maggie,--

"Your prompting to go to your nearest friends,--to remain where all the ties of your life have
been formed,--is a true prompting, to which the Church in its original constitution and discipline
responds, opening its arms to the penitent, watching over its children to the last; never abandoning
them until they are hopelessly reprobate. And the Church ought to represent the feeling of
the community, so that every parish should be a family knit together by Christian brotherhood
under a spiritual father. But the ideas of discipline and Christian fraternity are entirely
relaxed,--they can hardly be said to exist in the public mind; they hardly survive except in
the partial, contradictory form they have taken in the narrow communities of schismatics; and
if I were not supported by the firm faith that the Church must ultimately recover the full
force of that constitution which is alone fitted to human needs, I should often lose heart
at observing the want of fellowship and sense of mutual responsibility among my own flock. They
were sorry he had not happened in a little sooner,--they had just sold the very horse he wanted.
I may as well say here that they were not able to find him a horse, but that they used him with the
strictest honor, and that short of supplying his want they were perfect.

In the mean time the irregular dealers began to descend upon him,
as well as amateurs to whom he had mentioned his wish for a horse,
and his premises at certain hours of the morning presented the effect
of a horse-fair, or say rather a museum of equine bricabrac.

At first he blushed at the spectacle, but he soon became hardened to it, and liked the excitement
of driving one horse after another round the block, and deciding upon him. To a horse, they
had none of the qualities commended by the professor, but they had many others which the dealers
praised. These persons were not discouraged when he refused to buy, but cheerfully returned the
next day with others differently ruinous.

They were men of a spirit more obliging than my friend has found in other walks. One of them,
who paid him a prefatory visit in his library, in five minutes augmented from six to seven
hundred and fifty pounds the weight of a pony-horse, which he wished
to sell.

("What you want," said the Chevaliers, "is a pony-horse," and my friend, gratefully catching at
the phrase, had gone about saying he wanted a pony-horse.

After that, hulking brutes of from eleven to thirteen hundred pounds were every day brought to him
as pony-horses.) The same dealer came another day with a mustang, in whom was no fault, and
who had every appearance of speed, but who was only marking time as it is called in military
drill, I believe, when he seemed to be getting swiftly over the ground;
he showed a sociable preference for the curbstone in turning corners,
and was condemned, to be replaced the next evening by a pony-horse
that a child might ride or drive, and that especially would not shy.

Upon experiment, he shied half across the road, and the fact was
reported to the dealer

.


"That letter, as I said, ought to suffice to prevent false impressions concerning you. But
I am bound to tell you, Miss Tulliver, that not only the experience of my whole life, but my
observation within the last three days, makes me fear that there is hardly any evidence which
will save you from the painful effect of false imputations. The persons who are the most incapable
of a conscientious struggle such as yours are precisely those who will be likely to shrink
from you, because they will not believe in your struggle. I fear your life here will be attended
not only with much pain, but with many obstructions. For this reason--and for this only--I
ask you to consider whether it will not perhaps be better for you to take a situation at a
distance, according to your former intention. I will exert myself at once to obtain one for you."

"Oh, if I could but stop here!" said Maggie. "I have no heart to begin a strange life again.
I should have no stay. I should feel like a lonely wanderer, cut off from the past. I have
written to the lady who offered me a situation to excuse myself. If I remained here, I could
perhaps atone in some way to Lucy--to others; I could convince them that I'm sorry. And," she
added, with some of the old proud fire flashing out, "I will not go away because people say
false things of me. They shall learn to retract them. If I must go away at last, because--because
others wish it, I will not go now."

"Well," said Dr. Kenn, after some consideration, "if you determine on that, Miss Tulliver,
you may rely on all the influence my position gives me. I am bound to aid and countenance you
by the very duties of my office as a parish priest. I will add, that personally I have a deep
interest in your peace of mind and welfare."

"The only thing I want is some occupation that will enable me to get my bread and be independent,"
said Maggie. "I shall not want much. I can go on lodging where I am."

"I must think over the subject maturely," said Dr. Kenn, "and in a few days I shall be better
able to ascertain the general feeling. I shall come to see you; I shall bear you constantly
in mind."

When Maggie had left him, Dr. Kenn stood ruminating with his hands behind him, and his eyes
fixed on the carpet, under a painful sense of doubt and difficulty. The tone of Stephen's letter,
which he had read, and the actual relations of all the persons concerned, forced upon him powerfully
the idea of an ultimate marriage between Stephen and Maggie as the least evil; and the impossibility
of their proximity in St. Ogg's on any other supposition, until after years of separation,
threw an insurmountable prospective difficulty over Maggie's stay there. On the other hand,
he entered with all the comprehension of a man who had known spiritual conflict, and lived
through years of devoted service to his fellow-men, into that state of Maggie's heart and conscience
which made the consent to the marriage a desecration to her; her conscience must not be tampered
with; the principle on which she had acted was a safer guide than any balancing of consequences.
His experience told him that intervention was too dubious a responsibility to be lightly incurred;
the possible issue either of an endeavor to restore the former relations with Lucy and Philip,
or of counselling submission to this irruption of a new feeling, was hidden in a darkness all
the more impenetrable because each immediate step was clogged with evil.

The great problem of the shifting relation between passion and duty is clear to no man who
is capable of apprehending it; the question whether the moment has come in which a man has
fallen below the possibility of a renunciation that will carry any efficacy, and must accept
the sway of a passion against which he had struggled as a trespass, is one for which we have
no master-key that will fit all cases. The casuists have become a byword of reproach; but their
perverted spirit of minute discrimination was the shadow of a truth to which eyes and hearts
are too often fatally sealed,--the truth, that moral judgments must remain false and hollow,
unless they are checked and enlightened by a perpetual reference to the special circumstances
that mark the individual lot.

All people of broad, strong sense have an instinctive repugnance to the men of maxims; because
such people early discern that the mysterious complexity of our life is not to be embraced
by maxims, and that to lace ourselves up in formulas of that sort is to repress all the divine
promptings and inspirations that spring from growing insight and sympathy. And the man of maxims
is the popular representative of the minds that are guided in their moral judgment solely by
general rules, thinking that these will lead them to justice by a ready-made patent method,
without the trouble of exerting patience, discrimination, impartiality,--without any care to
assure themselves whether they have the insight that comes from a hardly earned estimate of
temptation, or from a life vivid and intense enough to have created a wide fellow-feeling with
all that is human.

Chapter III

Showing That Old Acquaintances Are Capable of Surprising Us

When Maggie was at home again, her mother brought her news of an unexpected line of conduct
in aunt Glegg. As long as Maggie had not been heard of, Mrs. Glegg had half closed her shutters
and drawn down her blinds. She felt assured that Maggie was drowned; that was far more probable
than that her niece and legatee should have done anything to wound the family honor in the
tenderest point. When at last she learned from Tom that Maggie had come home, and gathered
from him what was her explanation of her absence, she burst forth in severe reproof of Tom
for admitting the worst of his sister until he was compelled. If you were not to stand by your
"kin" as long as there was a shred of honor attributable to them, pray what were you to stand
by? Lightly to admit conduct in one of your own family that would force you to alter your will,
had never been the way of the Dodsons; and though Mrs. Glegg had always augured ill of Maggie's
future at a time when other people were perhaps less clear-sighted, yet fair play was a jewel,
and it was not for her own friends to help to rob the girl of her fair fame, and to cast her
out from family shelter to the scorn of the outer world, until she had become unequivocally
a family disgrace. The circumstances were unprecedented in Mrs. Glegg's experience; nothing
of that kind had happened among the Dodsons before; but it was a case in which her hereditary
rectitude and personal strength of character found a common channel along with her fundamental
ideas of clanship, as they did in her lifelong regard to equity in money matters. She quarrelled
with Mr. Glegg, whose kindness, flowing entirely into compassion for Lucy, made him as hard
in his judgment of Maggie as Mr. Deane himself was; and fuming against her sister Tulliver
because she did not at once come to her for advice and help, shut herself up in her own room
with Baxter's "Saints' Rest" from morning till night, denying herself to all visitors, till
Mr. Glegg brought from Mr. Deane the news of Stephen's letter. Then Mrs. Glegg felt that she
had adequate fighting-ground; then she laid aside Baxter, and was ready to meet all comers.
While Mrs. Pullet could do nothing but shake her head and cry, and wish that cousin Abbot had
died, or any number of funerals had happened rather than this, which had never happened before,
so that there was no knowing how to act, and Mrs. Pullet could never enter St. Ogg's again,
because "acquaintances" knew of it all, Mrs. Glegg only hoped that Mrs. Wooll, or any one else,
would come to her with their false tales about her own niece, and she would know what to say
to that ill-advised person!

Again she had a scene of remonstrance with Tom, all the more severe in proportion to the greater
strength of her present position. But Tom, like other immovable things, seemed only the more
rigidly fixed under that attempt to shake him. Poor Tom! he judged by what he had been able
to see; and the judgment was painful enough to himself. He thought he had the demonstration
of facts observed through years by his own eyes, which gave no warning of their imperfection,
that Maggie's nature was utterly untrustworthy, and too strongly marked with evil tendencies
to be safely treated with leniency. He would act on that demonstration at any cost; but the
thought of it made his days bitter to him. Tom, like every one of us, was imprisoned within
the limits of his own nature, and his education had simply glided over him, leaving a slight
deposit of polish; if you are inclined to be severe on his severity, remember that the responsibility
of tolerance lies with those who have the wider vision. There had arisen in Tom a repulsion
toward Maggie that derived its very intensity from their early childish love in the time when
they had clasped tiny fingers together, and their later sense of nearness in a common duty
and a common sorrow; the sight of her, as he had told her, was hateful to him. In this branch
of the Dodson family aunt Glegg found a stronger nature than her own; a nature in which family
feeling had lost the character of clanship by taking on a doubly deep dye of personal pride.

Mrs. Glegg allowed that Maggie ought to be punished,--she was not a woman to deny that; she
knew what conduct was,--but punished in proportion to the misdeeds proved against her, not
to those which were cast upon her by people outside her own family who might wish to show that
their own kin were better.

"Your aunt Glegg scolded me so as niver was, my dear," said poor Mrs. Tulliver, when she came
back to Maggie, "as I didn't go to her before; she said it wasn't for her to come to me first.
But she spoke like a sister, too; having she allays was, and hard to please,--oh dear!--but
she's said the kindest word as has ever been spoke by you yet, my child. For she says, for
all she's been so set again' having one extry in the house, and making extry spoons and things,
and putting her about in her ways, you shall have a shelter in her house, if you'll go to her
dutiful, and she'll uphold you against folks as say harm of you when they've no call. And I
told her I thought you couldn't bear to see anybody but me, you were so beat down with trouble;
but she said, 'I won't throw ill words at her; there's them out o' th' family 'ull be ready
enough to do that. But I'll give her good advice; an' she must be humble.' It's wonderful o'
Jane; for I'm sure she used to throw everything I did wrong at me,--if it was the raisin-wine
as turned out bad, or the pies too hot, or whativer it was."

"Oh, mother," said poor Maggie, shrinking from the thought of all the contact her bruised mind
would have to bear, "tell her I'm very grateful; I'll go to see her as soon as I can; but I
can't see any one just yet, except Dr. Kenn. I've been to him,--he will advise me, and help
me to get some occupation. I can't live with any one, or be dependent on them, tell aunt Glegg;
I must get my own bread. But did you hear nothing of Philip--Philip Wakem? Have you never seen
any one that has mentioned him?"

"No, my dear; but I've been to Lucy's, and I saw your uncle, and he says they got her to listen
to the letter, and she took notice o' Miss Guest, and asked questions, and the doctor thinks
she's on the turn to be better. What a world this is,--what trouble, oh dear! The law was the
first beginning, and it's gone from bad to worse, all of a sudden, just when the luck seemed
on the turn?" This was the first lamentation that Mrs. Tulliver had let slip to Maggie, but
old habit had been revived by the interview with sister Glegg.

"My poor, poor mother!" Maggie burst out, cut to the heart with pity and compunction, and throwing
her arms round her mother's neck; "I was always naughty and troublesome to you. And now you
might have been happy if it hadn't been for me."

"Eh, my dear," said Mrs. Tulliver, leaning toward the warm young cheek; "I must put up wi'
my children,--I shall never have no more; and if they bring me bad luck, I must be fond on
it. There's nothing else much to be fond on, for my furnitur' went long ago. And you'd got
to be very good once; I can't think how it's turned out the wrong way so!"

Still two or three more days passed, and Maggie heard nothing of Philip; anxiety about him
was becoming her predominant trouble, and she summoned courage at last to inquire about him
of Dr. Kenn, on his next visit to her. He did not even know if Philip was at home. The elder
Wakem was made moody by an accumulation of annoyance; the disappointment in this young Jetsome,
to whom, apparently, he was a good deal attached, had been followed close by the catastrophe
to his son's hopes after he had done violence to his own strong feeling by conceding to them,
and had incautiously mentioned this concession in St. Ogg's; and he was almost fierce in his
brusqueness when any one asked him a question about his son.

But Philip could hardly have been ill, or it would have been known through the calling in of
the medical man; it was probable that he was gone out of the town for a little while. Maggie
sickened under this suspense, and her imagination began to live more and more persistently
in what Philip was enduring. What did he believe about her? 

A horse is never of an even age: that is, he is not six, or eight, or ten, but five, or seven, or nine
years old; he is sometimes, but not often, eleven; he is never thirteen; his favorite time of life
is seven, and he rarely gets beyond it, if on sale. My friend found the number of horses brought
into the world in 1871 quite beyond computation.

  
  He also found that most hard-working horses were sick or ailing,
  as most hard-working men and women are; that perfectly sound horses
  are as rare as perfectly sound human beings, and are apt, like the
  latter, to be vicious.
  
  He began to have a quick eye for the characteristics of horses, and
  could walk round a proffered animal and scan his points with the best.
  "What," he would ask, of a given beast, "makes him let his lower
  lip hang down in that imbecile manner?"
  
  "Oh, he's got a parrot-mouth. Some folks like 'em." Here the
  dealer would pull open the creature's flabby lips, and discover
  a beak like that of a polyp; and the cleansing process on the grass
  or trousers would take place.
  
  Of another. "What makes him trot in that spread-out, squatty way, behind?"
  he demanded, after the usual tour of the block.
  "He travels wide. Horse men prefer that."

They preferred any ugliness
or awkwardness in a horse to the opposite grace or charm, and all
that my friend could urge, in meek withdrawal from negotiation, was
that he was not of an educated taste. In the course of long talks,
which frequently took the form of warnings, he became wise in the
tricks practiced by all dealers except his interlocutor. But perhaps I am wrong; perhaps I feel about you as the
  artist does about the scene over which his soul has brooded with
  love; he would tremble to see it confided to other hands; he would
  never believe that it could bear for another all the meaning and
  the beauty it bears for him.

  "I dared not trust myself to see you that morning; I was filled
  with selfish passion; I was shattered by a night of conscious
  delirium. I told you long ago that I had never been resigned even
  to the mediocrity of my powers; how could I be resigned to the loss
  of the one thing which had ever come to me on earth with the
  promise of such deep joy as would give a new and blessed meaning to
  the foregoing pain,--the promise of another self that would lift my
  aching affection into the divine rapture of an ever-springing,
  ever-satisfied want?

  "But the miseries of that night had prepared me for what came
  before the next. It was no surprise to me. I was certain that he
  had prevailed on you to sacrifice everything to him, and I waited
  with equal certainty to hear of your marriage. I measured your love
  and his by my own. But I was wrong, Maggie. There is something
  stronger in you than your love for him.

  "I will not tell you what I went through in that interval. But even
  in its utmost agony--even in those terrible throes that love must
  suffer before it can be disembodied of selfish desire--my love for
  you sufficed to withhold me from suicide, without the aid of any
  other motive. In the midst of my egoism, I yet could not bear to
  come like a death-shadow across the feast of your joy. I could not
  bear to forsake the world in which you still lived and might need
  me; it was part of the faith I had vowed to you,--to wait and
  endure. 1.
  
  CES. It is said that the best and most excellent things are in the world
  when the whole universe responds from every part, perfectly, to
  those things; and this it is said takes place as the planets arrive
  at Aries, being when that one of the eighth sphere again reaches
  the upper invisible firmament, where is also the other Zodiac;[A] and
  low and evil things prevail when the opposite disposition and order
  supervene, and thus through the power of change comes the continual
  mutation of like and unlike, from one opposite to another. The revolution
  then of the great year of the world is that space of time in which,
  through the most diverse customs and effects, and by the most opposite
  and contrary means, it returns to the same again. As we see in particular
  years such as that of the sun, where the beginning of an opposite
  tendency is the end of one year, and the end of this is the beginning
  of that. Therefore now that we have been in the dregs of
  the sciences, which have brought forth the dregs of opinions,
  which are the cause of the dregs of customs and of works, we may
  certainly expect to return to the better condition.

  
  
  [A] Astronomers distinguish between a fixed and intellectual zodiac;
  and the movable and visible zodiac. According to the former, Aries
  still stands as the first of the signs; that is to say, the
  first thirty degrees of the zodiacal circle, reckoning from the equinoctial
  point in spring, are allotted to Aries in the intellectual zodiac....
  Astronomers generally choose to reckon by the fixed and intellectual
  zodiac.--(Drummond's "Oedipus Judaicus.")

MARICONDO.

  "For some time I have shrunk from writing to you, because I have
  shrunk even from the appearance of wishing to thrust myself before
  you, and so repeating my original error. But you will not
  misconstrue me. I know that we must keep apart for a long while;
  cruel tongues would force us apart, if nothing else did. But I
  shall not go away. The place where you are is the one where my mind
  must live, wherever I might travel. And remember that I am
  unchangeably yours,--yours not with selfish wishes, but with a
  devotion that excludes such wishes.

  "God comfort you, my loving, large-souled Maggie. If every one else
  has misconceived you, remember that you have never been doubted by
  him whose heart recognized you ten years ago.

  "Do not believe any one who says I am ill, because I am not seen
  out of doors. I have only had nervous headaches,--no worse than I
  have sometimes had them before. But the overpowering heat inclines
  me to be perfectly quiescent in the daytime. I am strong enough to
  obey any word which shall tell me that I can serve you by word or
  deed.

                          "Yours to the last,
                           "Philip Wakem."

As Maggie knelt by the bed sobbing, with that letter pressed under her, her feelings again
and again gathered themselves in a whispered cry, always in the same words,--

"O God, is there any happiness in love that could make me forget their pain?"

Chapter IV

Maggie and Lucy

By the end of the week Dr. Kenn had made up his mind that there was only one way in which he
could secure to Maggie a suitable living at St. Ogg's. Even with his twenty years' experience
as a parish priest, he was aghast at the obstinate continuance of imputations against her in
the face of evidence. Hitherto he had been rather more adored and appealed to than was quite
agreeable to him; but now, in attempting to open the ears of women to reason, and their consciences
to justice, on behalf of Maggie Tulliver, he suddenly found himself as powerless as he was
aware he would have been if he had attempted to influence the shape of bonnets. Dr. Kenn could
not be contradicted; he was listened to in silence; but when he left the room, a comparison
of opinions among his hearers yielded much the same result as before. Miss Tulliver had undeniably
acted in a blamable manner, even Dr. Kenn did not deny that; how, then, could he think so lightly
of her as to put that favorable interpretation on everything she had done? Even on the supposition
that required the utmost stretch of belief,--namely, that none of the things said about Miss
Tulliver were true,--still, since they had been said about her, they had cast an odor round
her which must cause her to be shrunk from by every woman who had to take care of her own reputation--and
of Society. To have taken Maggie by the hand and said, "I will not believe unproved evil of
you; my lips shall not utter it; my ears shall be closed against it; I, too, am an erring mortal,
liable to stumble, apt to come short of my most earnest efforts; your lot has been harder than
mine, your temptation greater; let us help each other to stand and walk without more falling,"--to
have done this would have demanded courage, deep pity, self-knowledge, generous trust; would
have demanded a mind that tasted no piquancy in evil-speaking, that felt no self-exaltation
in condemning, that cheated itself with no large words into the belief that life can have any
moral end, any high religion, which excludes the striving after perfect truth, justice, and
love toward the individual men and women who come across our own path. The ladies of St. Ogg's
were not beguiled by any wide speculative conceptions; but they had their favorite abstraction,
called Society, which served to make their consciences perfectly easy in doing what satisfied
their own egoism,--thinking and speaking the worst of Maggie Tulliver, and turning their backs
upon her. It was naturally disappointing to Dr. Kenn, after two years of superfluous incense
from his feminine parishioners, to find them suddenly maintaining their views in opposition
to his; but then they maintained them in opposition to a higher Authority, which they had venerated
longer. That Authority had furnished a very explicit answer to persons who might inquire where
their social duties began, and might be inclined to take wide views as to the starting-point.
The answer had not turned on the ultimate good of Society, but on "a certain man" who was found
in trouble by the wayside.

Not that St. Ogg's was empty of women with some tenderness of heart and conscience; probably
it had as fair a proportion of human goodness in it as any other small trading town of that
day. But until every good man is brave, we must expect to find many good women timid,--too
timid even to believe in the correctness of their own best promptings, when these would place
them in a minority. And the men at St. Ogg's were not all brave, by any means; some of them
were even fond of scandal, and to an extent that might have given their conversation an effeminate
character, if it had not been distinguished by masculine jokes, and by an occasional shrug
of the shoulders at the mutual hatred of women. It was the general feeling of the masculine
mind at St. Ogg's that women were not to be interfered with in their treatment of each other.

And thus every direction in which Dr. Kenn had turned, in the hope of procuring some kind recognition
and some employment for Maggie, proved a disappointment to him. Mrs. James Torry could not
think of taking Maggie as a nursery governess, even temporarily,--a young woman about whom
"such things had been said," and about whom "gentlemen joked"; and Miss Kirke, who had a spinal
complaint, and wanted a reader and companion, felt quite sure that Maggie's mind must be of
a quality with which she, for her part, could not risk any contact. Why did not Miss Tulliver
accept the shelter offered her by her aunt Glegg? It did not become a girl like her to refuse
it. Or else, why did she not go out of the neighborhood, and get a situation where she was
not known? (It was not, apparently, of so much importance that she should carry her dangerous
tendencies into strange families unknown at St. Ogg's.) She must be very bold and hardened
to wish to stay in a parish where she was so much stared at and whispered about.

Dr. Kenn, having great natural firmness, began, in the presence of this opposition, as every
firm man would have done, to contract a certain strength of determination over and above what
would have been called forth by the end in view. He himself wanted a daily governess for his
younger children; and though he had hesitated in the first instance to offer this position
to Maggie, the resolution to protest with the utmost force of his personal and priestly character
against her being crushed and driven away by slander, was now decisive. Maggie gratefully accepted
an employment that gave her duties as well as a support; her days would be filled now, and
solitary evenings would be a welcome rest. She no longer needed the sacrifice her mother made
in staying with her, and Mrs. Tulliver was persuaded to go back to the Mill.

But now it began to be discovered that Dr. Kenn, exemplary as he had hitherto appeared, had
his crotchets, possibly his weaknesses. The masculine mind of St. Ogg's smiled pleasantly,
and did not wonder that Kenn liked to see a fine pair of eyes daily, or that he was inclined
to take so lenient a view of the past; the feminine mind, regarded at that period as less powerful,
took a more melancholy view of the case. If Dr. Kenn should be beguiled into marrying that
Miss Tulliver! It was not safe to be too confident, even about the best of men; an apostle
had fallen, and wept bitterly afterwards; and though Peter's denial was not a close precedent,
his repentance was likely to be.

Maggie had not taken her daily walks to the Rectory for many weeks, before the dreadful possibility
of her some time or other becoming the Rector's wife had been talked of so often in confidence,
that ladies were beginning to discuss how they should behave to her in that position. For Dr.
Kenn, it had been understood, had sat in the schoolroom half an hour one morning, when Miss
Tulliver was giving her lessons,--nay, he had sat there every morning; he had once walked home
with her,--he almost always walked home with her,--and if not, he went to see her in the evening.
What an artful creature she was! What a mother for those children! It was enough to make poor
Mrs. Kenn turn in her grave, that they should be put under the care of this girl only a few
weeks after her death. Would he be so lost to propriety as to marry her before the year was
out? The masculine mind was sarcastic, and thought not.

The Miss Guests saw an alleviation to the sorrow of witnessing a folly in their Rector; at
least their brother would be safe; and their knowledge of Stephen's tenacity was a constant
ground of alarm to them, lest he should come back and marry Maggie. They were not among those
who disbelieved their brother's letter; but they had no confidence in Maggie's adherence to
her renunciation of him; they suspected that she had shrunk rather from the elopement than
from the marriage, and that she lingered in St. Ogg's, relying on his return to her. They had
always thought her disagreeable; they now thought her artful and proud; having quite as good
grounds for that judgment as you and I probably have for many strong opinions of the same kind.
Formerly they had not altogether delighted in the contemplated match with Lucy, but now their
dread of a marriage between Stephen and Maggie added its momentum to their genuine pity and
indignation on behalf of the gentle forsaken girl, in making them desire that he should return
to her. As soon as Lucy was able to leave home, she was to seek relief from the oppressive
heat of this August by going to the coast with the Miss Guests; and it was in their plans that
Stephen should be induced to join them. On the very first hint of gossip concerning Maggie
and Dr. Kenn, the report was conveyed in Miss Guest's letter to her brother.

Maggie had frequent tidings through her mother, or aunt Glegg, or Dr. Kenn, of Lucy's gradual
progress toward recovery, and her thoughts tended continually toward her uncle Deane's house;
she hungered for an interview with Lucy, if it were only for five minutes, to utter a word
of penitence, to be assured by Lucy's own eyes and lips that she did not believe in the willing
treachery of those whom she had loved and trusted. But she knew that even if her uncle's indignation
had not closed his house against her, the agitation of such an interview would have been forbidden
to Lucy. Only to have seen her without speaking would have been some relief; for Maggie was
haunted by a face cruel in its very gentleness; a face that had been turned on hers with glad,
sweet looks of trust and love from the twilight time of memory; changed now to a sad and weary
face by a first heart-stroke. And as the days passed on, that pale image became more and more
distinct; the picture grew and grew into more speaking definiteness under the avenging hand
of remorse; the soft hazel eyes, in their look of pain, were bent forever on Maggie, and pierced
her the more because she could see no anger in them. But Lucy was not yet able to go to church,
or any place where Maggie could see her; and even the hope of that departed, when the news
was told her by aunt Glegg, that Lucy was really going away in a few days to Scarborough with
the Miss Guests, who had been heard to say that they expected their brother to meet them there.

Only those who have known what hardest inward conflict is, can know what Maggie felt as she
sat in her loneliness the evening after hearing that news from Mrs. Glegg,--only those who
have known what it is to dread their own selfish desires as the watching mother would dread
the sleeping-potion that was to still her own pain.

She sat without candle in the twilight, with the window wide open toward the river; the sense
of oppressive heat adding itself undistinguishably to the burthen of her lot. Seated on a chair
against the window, with her arm on the windowsill she was looking blankly at the flowing river,
swift with the backward-rushing tide, struggling to see still the sweet face in its unreproaching
sadness, that seemed now from moment to moment to sink away and be hidden behind a form that
thrust itself between, and made darkness. Hearing the door open, she thought Mrs. Jakin was
coming in with her supper, as usual; and with that repugnance to trivial speech which comes
with languor and wretchedness, she shrank from turning round and saying she wanted nothing;
good little Mrs. Jakin would be sure to make some well-meant remarks. But the next moment,
without her having discerned the sound of a footstep, she felt a light hand on her shoulder,
and heard a voice close to her saying, "Maggie!"

The face was there,--changed, but all the sweeter; the hazel eyes were there, with their heart-piercing
tenderness.

"Maggie!" the soft voice said. "Lucy!" answered a voice with a sharp ring of anguish in it;
and Lucy threw her arms round Maggie's neck, and leaned her pale cheek against the burning brow.

an old fresco.

Lucy rose and said, "Very well, Alice,--in a minute."

"I'm to go away on Friday, Maggie," she added, when Alice had closed the door again. "When
I come back, and am strong, they will let me do as I like. I shall come to you when I please then."

"Lucy," said Maggie, with another great effort, "I pray to God continually that I may never
be the cause of sorrow to you any more."

She pressed the little hand that she held between hers, and looked up into the face that was
bent over hers. Lucy never forgot that look.

"Maggie," she said, in a low voice, that had the solemnity of confession in it, "you are better
than I am. I can't----"

She broke off there, and said no more. But they clasped each other again in a last embrace.

Chapter V

The Last Conflict

In the second week of September, Maggie was again sitting in her lonely room, battling with
the old shadowy enemies that were forever slain and rising again. It was past midnight, and
the rain was beating heavily against the window, driven with fitful force by the rushing, loud-moaning
wind. For the day after Lucy's visit there had been a sudden change in the weather; the heat
and drought had given way to cold variable winds, and heavy falls of rain at intervals; and
she had been forbidden to risk the contemplated journey until the weather should become more
settled. In the counties higher up the Floss the rains had been continuous, and the completion
of the harvest had been arrested. And now, for the last two days, the rains on this lower course
of the river had been incessant, so that the old men had shaken their heads and talked of sixty
years ago, when the same sort of weather, happening about the equinox, brought on the great
floods, which swept the bridge away, and reduced the town to great misery. But the younger
generation, who had seen several small floods, thought lightly of these sombre recollections
and forebodings; and Bob Jakin, naturally prone to take a hopeful view of his own luck, laughed
at his mother when she regretted their having taken a house by the riverside, observing that
but for that they would have had no boats, which were the most lucky of possessions in case
of a flood that obliged them to go to a distance for food.

But the careless and the fearful were alike sleeping in their beds now. There was hope that
the rain would abate by the morrow; threatenings of a worse kind, from sudden thaws after falls
of snow, had often passed off, in the experience of the younger ones; and at the very worst,
the banks would be sure to break lower down the river when the tide came in with violence,
and so the waters would be carried off, without causing more than temporary inconvenience,
and losses that would be felt only by the poorer sort, whom charity would relieve.

All were in their beds now, for it was past midnight; all except some solitary watchers such
as Maggie. She was seated in her little parlor toward the river, with one candle, that left
everything dim in the room except a letter which lay before her on the table. That letter,
which had come to her to-day, was one of the causes that had kept her up far on into the night,
unconscious how the hours were going, careless of seeking rest, with no image of rest coming
across her mind, except of that far, far off rest from which there would be no more waking
for her into this struggling earthly life.

Two days before Maggie received that letter, she had been to the Rectory for the last time.
The heavy rain would have prevented her from going since; but there was another reason. Dr.
Kenn, at first enlightened only by a few hints as to the new turn which gossip and slander
had taken in relation to Maggie, had recently been made more fully aware of it by an earnest
remonstrance from one of his male parishioners against the indiscretion of persisting in the
attempt to overcome the prevalent feeling in the parish by a course of resistance. Dr. Kenn,
having a conscience void of offence in the matter, was still inclined to persevere,--was still
averse to give way before a public sentiment that was odious and contemptible; but he was finally
wrought upon by the consideration of the peculiar responsibility attached to his office, of
avoiding the appearance of evil,--an "appearance" that is always dependent on the average quality
of surrounding minds. Where these minds are low and gross, the area of that "appearance" is
proportionately widened. Perhaps he was in danger of acting from obstinacy; perhaps it was
his duty to succumb. Conscientious people are apt to see their duty in that which is the most
painful course; and to recede was always painful to Dr. Kenn. He made up his mind that he must
advise Maggie to go away from St. Ogg's for a time; and he performed that difficult task with
as much delicacy as he could, only stating in vague terms that he found his attempt to countenance
her stay was a source of discord between himself and his parishioners, that was likely to obstruct
his usefulness as a clergyman. He begged her to allow him to write to a clerical friend of
his, who might possibly take her into his own family as governess; and, if not, would probably
know of some other available position for a young woman in whose welfare Dr. Kenn felt a strong
interest.

Poor Maggie listened with a trembling lip; she could say nothing but a faint "Thank you, I
shall be grateful"; and she walked back to her lodgings, through the driving rain, with a new
sense of desolation. She must be a lonely wanderer; she must go out among fresh faces, that
would look at her wonderingly, because the days did not seem joyful to her; she must begin
a new life, in which she would have to rouse herself to receive new impressions; and she was
so unspeakably, sickeningly weary! There was no home, no help for the erring; even those who
pitied were constrained to hardness. But ought she to complain? Ought she to shrink in this
way from the long penance of life, which was all the possibility she had of lightening the
load to some other sufferers, and so changing that passionate error into a new force of unselfish
human love? All the next day she sat in her lonely room, with a window darkened by the cloud
and the driving rain, thinking of that future, and wrestling for patience; for what repose
could poor Maggie ever win except by wrestling?

And on the third day--this day of which she had just sat out the close--the letter had come
which was lying on the table before her.

The letter was from Stephen. He was come back from Holland; he was at Mudport again, unknown
to any of his friends, and had written to her from that place, enclosing the letter to a person
whom he trusted in St. Ogg's. From beginning to end it was a passionate cry of reproach; an
appeal against her useless sacrifice of him, of herself, against that perverted notion of right
which led her to crush all his hopes, for the sake of a mere idea, and not any substantial
good,--his hopes, whom she loved, and who loved her with that single overpowering passion,
that worship, which a man never gives to a woman more than once in his life.

"They have written to me that you are to marry Kenn. As if I should believe that! Perhaps they
have told you some such fables about me. Perhaps they tell you I've been 'travelling.' My body
has been dragged about somewhere; but I have never travelled from the hideous place where you
left me; where I started up from the stupor of helpless rage to find you gone.

"Maggie! whose pain can have been like mine? Whose injury is like mine? Who besides me has
met that long look of love that has burnt itself into my soul, so that no other image can come
there? Maggie, call me back to you! Call me back to life and goodness! I am banished from both
now. I have no motives; I am indifferent to everything. Two months have only deepened the certainty
that I can never care for life without you. Write me one word; say 'Come!' In two days I should
be with you. Maggie, have you forgotten what it was to be together,--to be within reach of
a look, to be within hearing of each other's voice?"

When Maggie first read this letter she felt as if her real temptation had only just begun.
At the entrance of the chill dark cavern, we turn with unworn courage from the warm light;
but how, when we have trodden far in the damp darkness, and have begun to be faint and weary;
how, if there is a sudden opening above us, and we are invited back again to the life-nourishing
day? The leap of natural longing from under the pressure of pain is so strong, that all less
immediate motives are likely to be forgotten--till the pain has been escaped from.

For hours Maggie felt as if her struggle had been in vain. For hours every other thought that
she strove to summon was thrust aside by the image of Stephen waiting for the single word that
would bring him to her. She did not read the letter: she heard him uttering it, and the voice
shook her with its old strange power. All the day before she had been filled with the vision
of a lonely future through which she must carry the burthen of regret, upheld only by clinging
faith. And here, close within her reach, urging itself upon her even as a claim, was another
future, in which hard endurance and effort were to be exchanged for easy, delicious leaning
on another's loving strength! And yet that promise of joy in the place of sadness did not make
the dire force of the temptation to Maggie.

It was Stephen's tone of misery, it was the doubt in the justice of her own resolve, that made
the balance tremble, and made her once start from her seat to reach the pen and paper, and
write "Come!"

But close upon that decisive act, her mind recoiled; and the sense of contradiction with her
past self in her moments of strength and clearness came upon her like a pang of conscious degradation.
No, she must wait; she must pray; the light that had forsaken her would come again; she should
feel again what she had felt when she had fled away, under an inspiration strong enough to
conquer agony,--to conquer love; she should feel again what she had felt when Lucy stood by
her, when Philip's letter had stirred all the fibres that bound her to the calmer past.

She sat quite still, far on into the night, with no impulse to change her attitude, without
active force enough even for the mental act of prayer; only waiting for the light that would
surely come again. And with all this we crowd our memories with genealogies: this one is intent
upon the deciphering of writings, that other is occupied in multiplying childish sophisms, and we
shall see, for example, a volume full of: Cor est fons vitae. Nix est alba, ergo cornix est fons
vitae alba, and one prattles about the noun; was it first, or the verb; the other, whether the
sea was first or the springs; again, another tries to revive obsolete vocabularies which,
because they were once used and approved by some old writer, must now be exalted to the stars.
Yet another takes his stand upon the false or the true orthography,
and so on, with various similar nonsense only worthy of contempt.

They fast, they become thin and emaciated, they scourge the skin, and lengthen the beard, they
rot, and in these things they place the anchor of their highest good.

They despise fortune, and put up these as shield and refuge against the strokes of fate. With
such-like most vile thoughts they think to mount to the stars, to
be equal to gods, and to understand the good and the beautiful which
philosophy promises.

CES.

A grand thing, indeed, that time, which does not suffice for necessary things, however carefully we use it,
should come to be chiefly consumed about superfluous things, and things vile and shameful.

Is
it not rather a thing to laugh at than to praise in Archimedes, that at the time when the city
was in confusion, everything in ruins, fire broken out in his room, enemies there at his back
who had it in their power to make him lose his brain, his life, his
art; that he, meanwhile, having abandoned all desire or intention
of saving his life, lost it while he was inquiring, perhaps, into
the proportion of the curve to the straight line, of the diameter
to the circle, or other similar mathesis, as suitable for youth, as
it were unsuitable for one who, being old, should be intent upon things
more worthy of being put as the end of human desires?


The door was ajar; she went in and shook him by the shoulder.

"Bob, the flood is come! it is in the house; let us see if we can make the boats safe."

She lighted his candle, while the poor wife, snatching up her baby, burst into screams; and
then she hurried down again to see if the waters were rising fast. There was a step down into
the room at the door leading from the staircase; she saw that the water was already on a level
with the step. While she was looking, something came with a tremendous crash against the window,
and sent the leaded panes and the old wooden framework inward in shivers, the water pouring
in after it.

"It is the boat!" cried Maggie. "Bob, come down to get the boats!"

And without a moment's shudder of fear, she plunged through the water, which was rising fast
to her knees, and by the glimmering light of the candle she had left on the stairs, she mounted
on to the window-sill, and crept into the boat, which was left with the prow lodging and protruding
through the window. Bob was not long after her, hurrying without shoes or stockings, but with
the lanthorn in his hand.

"Why, they're both here,--both the boats," said Bob, as he got into the one where Maggie was.
"It's wonderful this fastening isn't broke too, as well as the mooring."

In the excitement of getting into the other boat, unfastening it, and mastering an oar, Bob
was not struck with the danger Maggie incurred. We are not apt to fear for the fearless, when
we are companions in their danger, and Bob's mind was absorbed in possible expedients for the
safety of the helpless indoors. The fact that Maggie had been up, had waked him, and had taken
the lead in activity, gave Bob a vague impression of her as one who would help to protect,
not need to be protected. She too had got possession of an oar, and had pushed off, so as to
release the boat from the overhanging window-frame.

"The water's rising so fast," said Bob, "I doubt it'll be in at the chambers before long,--th'
house is so low. I've more mind to get Prissy and the child and the mother into the boat, if
I could, and trusten to the water,--for th' old house is none so safe. And if I let go the
boat--but you," he exclaimed, suddenly lifting the light of his lanthorn on Maggie, as she
stood in the rain with the oar in her hand and her black hair streaming.

Maggie had no time to answer, for a new tidal current swept along the line of the houses, and
drove both the boats out on to the wide water, with a force that carried them far past the
meeting current of the river.

In the first moments Maggie felt nothing, thought of nothing, but that she had suddenly passed
away from that life which she had been dreading; it was the transition of death, without its
agony,--and she was alone in the darkness with God.

The whole thing had been so rapid, so dreamlike, that the threads of ordinary association were
broken; she sank down on the seat clutching the oar mechanically, and for a long while had
no distinct conception of her position. The first thing that waked her to fuller consciousness
was the cessation of the rain, and a perception that the darkness was divided by the faintest
light, which parted the overhanging gloom from the immeasurable watery level below. She was
driven out upon the flood,--that awful visitation of God which her father used to talk of;
which had made the nightmare of her childish dreams. Ah me, my lights! where are the zeal and
art With which to tranquillize the afflicted sense?

Tell me my soul; what time and in what place Shall I thy deep transcendent
woe assuage?

And thou my heart, what solace can I bring As compensation to thy heavy pain? When, oh unquiet
and perturbed mind, Wilt thou the soul for debt and dole receive With heart, with spirit and
the sorrowing eyes?

[F] Let no one suppose that we may attain to this true light and perfect knowledge by hearsay,
or by reading and study, nor yet by high skill and great learning.--("Theologia Germanica.")

The
mind which aspires to the divine splendour flees from the society of the crowd and retires from the
multitude of subjects, as much as from the community of studies,
opinions and sentences; seeing that the peril of contracting vices
and illusions is greater, according to the number of persons with
whom one is allied.

In the public shows, said the moral philosopher, by means of pleasure, vices are more easily engendered.
If one aspires to the supreme splendour, let him retire as much as he can, from union and support,
into himself (Di sorte che non sia simile a molti, per che son molti; e non sia nemico di molti
per che son dissimili), so that he be not like unto many, because they are many; and be not
adverse to many, because they are dissimilar; if it be possible, let him retain the one and
the other; otherwise he will incline to that which seems to him best.

Onward she paddled and rowed by turns in the growing twilight; her wet clothes clung round
her, and her streaming hair was dashed about by the wind, but she was hardly conscious of any
bodily sensations,--except a sensation of strength, inspired by mighty emotion. Along with
the sense of danger and possible rescue for those long-remembered beings at the old home, there
was an undefined sense of reconcilement with her brother; what quarrel, what harshness, what
unbelief in each other can subsist in the presence of a great calamity, when all the artificial
vesture of our life is gone, and we are all one with each other in primitive mortal needs?
Vaguely Maggie felt this, in the strong resurgent love toward her brother that swept away all
the later impressions of hard, cruel offence and misunderstanding, and left only the deep,
underlying, unshakable memories of early union.

But now there was a large dark mass in the distance, and near to her Maggie could discern the
current of the river. The dark mass must be--yes, it was--St. Ogg's. Ah, now she knew which
way to look for the first glimpse of the well-known trees--the gray willows, the now yellowing
chestnuts--and above them the old roof! But there was no color, no shape yet; all was faint
and dim. More and more strongly the energies seemed to come and put themselves forth, as if
her life were a stored-up force that was being spent in this hour, unneeded for any future.

She must get her boat into the current of the Floss, else she would never be able to pass the
Ripple and approach the house; this was the thought that occurred to her, as she imagined with
more and more vividness the state of things round the old home. But then she might be carried
very far down, and be unable to guide her boat out of the current again. For the first time
distinct ideas of danger began to press upon her; but there was no choice of courses, no room
for hesitation, and she floated into the current. Swiftly she went now without effort; more
and more clearly in the lessening distance and the growing light she began to discern the objects
that she knew must be the well-known trees and roofs; nay, she was not far off a rushing, muddy
current that must be the strangely altered Ripple.

Great God! there were floating masses in it, that might dash against her boat as she passed,
and cause her to perish too soon. What were those masses?

For the first time Maggie's heart began to beat in an agony of dread. She sat helpless, dimly
conscious that she was being floated along, more intensely conscious of the anticipated clash.
But the horror was transient; it passed away before the oncoming warehouses of St. Ogg's. She
had passed the mouth of the Ripple, then; now, she must use all her skill and power to manage
the boat and get it if possible out of the current. She could see now that the bridge was broken
down; she could see the masts of a stranded vessel far out over the watery field. But no boats
were to be seen moving on the river,--such as had been laid hands on were employed in the flooded
streets.

With new resolution, Maggie seized her oar, and stood up again to paddle; but the now ebbing
tide added to the swiftness of the river, and she was carried along beyond the bridge. She
could hear shouts from the windows overlooking the river, as if the people there were calling
to her. It was not till she had passed on nearly to Tofton that she could get the boat clear
of the current. Then with one yearning look toward her uncle Deane's house that lay farther
down the river, she took to both her oars and rowed with all her might across the watery fields,
back toward the Mill. Color was beginning to awake now, and as she approached the Dorlcote
fields, she could discern the tints of the trees, could see the old Scotch firs far to the
right, and the home chestnuts,--oh, how deep they lay in the water,--deeper than the trees
on this side the hill! And the roof of the Mill--where was it? Those heavy fragments hurrying
down the Ripple,--what had they meant? But it was not the house,--the house stood firm; drowned
up to the first story, but still firm,--or was it broken in at the end toward the Mill?

With panting joy that she was there at last,--joy that overcame all distress,--Maggie neared
the front of the house. At first she heard no sound; she saw no object moving. Her boat was
on a level with the upstairs window. She called out in a loud, piercing voice,--

"Tom, where are you? Mother, where are you? Here is Maggie!"

Soon, from the window of the attic in the central gable, she heard Tom's voice,--

"Who is it? Have you brought a boat?"

"It is I, Tom,--Maggie. Where is mother?"

"She is not here; she went to Garum the day before yesterday. I'll come down to the lower window."

"Alone, Maggie?" said Tom, in a voice of deep astonishment, as he opened the middle window,
on a level with the boat.

"Yes, Tom; God has taken care of me, to bring me to you. Get in quickly. Is there no one else?"

"No," said Tom, stepping into the boat; "I fear the man is drowned; he was carried down the
Ripple, I think, when part of the Mill fell with the crash of trees and stones against it;
I've shouted again and again, and there has been no answer. Give me the oars, Maggie."

It was not till Tom had pushed off and they were on the wide water,--he face to face with Maggie,--that
the full meaning of what had happened rushed upon his mind. It came with so overpowering a
force,--it was such a new revelation to his spirit, of the depths in life that had lain beyond
his vision, which he had fancied so keen and clear,--that he was unable to ask a question.
They sat mutely gazing at each other,--Maggie with eyes of intense life looking out from a
weary, beaten face; Tom pale, with a certain awe and humiliation. Thought was busy though the
lips were silent; and though he could ask no question, he guessed a story of almost miraculous,
divinely protected effort. But at last a mist gathered over the blue-gray eyes, and the lips
found a word they could utter,--the old childish "Magsie!"

Maggie could make no answer but a long, deep sob of that mysterious, wondrous happiness that
is one with pain.

As soon as she could speak, she said, "We will go to Lucy, Tom; we'll go and see if she is
safe, and then we can help the rest."

Tom rowed with untired vigor, and with a different speed from poor Maggie's. The boat was soon
in the current of the river again, and soon they would be at Tofton.

"Park House stands high up out of the flood," said Maggie. "Perhaps they have got Lucy there."

Nothing else was said; a new danger was being carried toward them by the river. Some wooden
machinery had just given way on one of the wharves, and huge fragments were being floated along.
The sun was rising now, and the wide area of watery desolation was spread out in dreadful clearness
around them; in dreadful clearness floated onward the hurrying, threatening masses. A large
company in a boat that was working its way along under the Tofton houses observed their danger,
and shouted, "Get out of the current!"

But that could not be done at once; and Tom, looking before him, saw death rushing on them.
Huge fragments, clinging together in fatal fellowship, made one wide mass across the stream.

"It is coming, Maggie!" Tom said, in a deep, hoarse voice, loosing the oars, and clasping her.

The next instant the boat was no longer seen upon the water, and the huge mass was hurrying
on in hideous triumph.

But soon the keel of the boat reappeared, a black speck on the golden water.

The boat reappeared, but brother and sister had gone down in an embrace never to be parted;
living through again in one supreme moment the days when they had clasped their little hands
in love, and roamed the daisied fields together.

Conclusion

Nature repairs her ravages,--repairs them with her sunshine, and with human labor. The desolation
wrought by that flood had left little visible trace on the face of the earth, five years after. Truth,
it seemed, might be absent or present in a horse-trade, but mystery was essential.

The dealers had a jargon of their own, in which my friend became an
expert.

They did not say that a horse weighed a thousand pounds, but ten
hundred; he was not worth a hundred and twenty-five dollars, but one
and a quarter; he was not going on seven years old, but was coming
seven.

There are curious facts, by the way, in regard to the age of horses which are not generally
known.
 To the eyes that
have dwelt on the past, there is no thorough repair.

Dorlcote Mill was rebuilt. And Dorlcote churchyard--where the brick grave that held a father
whom we know, was found with the stone laid prostrate upon it after the flood--had recovered
all its grassy order and decent quiet.

Near that brick grave there was a tomb erected, very soon after the flood, for two bodies that
were found in close embrace; and it was visited at different moments by two men who both felt
that their keenest joy and keenest sorrow were forever buried there.

One of them visited the tomb again with a sweet face beside him; but that was years after.

The other was always solitary. His great companionship was among the trees of the Red Deeps,
where the buried joy seemed still to hover, like a revisiting spirit.

The tomb bore the names of Tom and Maggie Tulliver, and below the names it was written,--

               "In their death they were not divided."
