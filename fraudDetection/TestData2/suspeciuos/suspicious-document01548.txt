First of all, in our consideration and in order of greatness, stands the name of Aldus Manutius.
The books of the Aldine press, all with the well-known sign of the anchor and dolphin, are
familiar to most students of the classics. Aldus was born in 1450, the very year of Gutenberg's
invention. For the first forty years of his life he was a scholar, devoting himself to the
Latin classics and to the mastery of the newly revived Greek language and literature. His intimate
association with Pico della Mirandola and other Italian scholars, as well as with many of the
learned Greeks who then frequented Italian courts and cities, led him to conceive the great
plan upon which his later career was based. This was nothing less than to issue practically
the whole body of classic literature, Greek as well as Latin, in editions distinguished from
all that had preceded in two important respects. First, they were to be not reprints of received
uncritical texts but new revisions made by competent scholars based upon a comparison of all
the best available manuscripts. Secondly, they were to be printed not in ponderous and costly
folios but in small octavos of convenient size, small but clear type, and low price. This was
not primarily a commercial venture like the cheap texts of the classics issued in the nineteenth
century by Teubner and other German publishers, but resembled rather in its broad humanistic
spirit such a recent enterprise as the Loeb Classical Library. The purpose in each case was
to revive and encourage the reading of the classics not alone by schoolboys but by men of all
ages and all professions. But there is this important difference, that Mr. Loeb is a retired
millionaire who employs scholars to do all the work and merely foots the bill, while Aldus
was a poor man dependent upon such capital as he could borrow from his patrons, and had at
the same time to perform for himself a large part of the editorial labors on his books. Mr.
Loeb commands the latest and most complete resources of the modern art of printing; Aldus helped
to make that art. Mr. Loeb's editors may employ when they choose the style of type known as
italic; Aldus invented it. Mr. Loeb's publishers have at their command all the advertising
and selling machinery of a great modern business concern, and yet they do not, and probably
can not, make the classics pay for themselves, but must meet the deficits out of an endowment.
Aldus had to organize his own selling system, his advertising had to be largely by private
correspondence with scholars and book-sellers throughout Europe laboriously composed with his
own hand; yet it was imperative that the business become as soon as possible self-supporting,
or at least that losses in one quarter should be recouped by profits in another.

It was in his edition of Virgil, 1501, that Aldus first employed the new cursive or sloping
letter which later came to be known in English printing as italic type. According to tradition
he copied it closely from the handwriting of the Italian poet Petrarch. The type was very compact,
covering many more words on a page than the roman of that day, and was used as a body type,
not as in our day for isolated words and phrases set apart for emphasis or other distinction
from the rest of the text. Aldus also, though not the first to cast Greek type, gave his Greek
fonts an elegance which was soon imitated, like the italic, by other printers. By the introduction
of small types which were at the same time legible, and by adopting for his classical texts
a small format suitable for pocket-size books, Aldus invented the modern small book. No longer
was it necessary for a scholar to rest a heavy folio on a table in order to read; he might
carry with him on a journey half a dozen of these beautiful little books in no more space than
a single volume of the older printers. Furthermore, his prices were low. The pocket editions
or small octavos sold for about two lire, or forty cents in the money of that day, the purchasing
power of which in modern money is estimated at not above two dollars.

This popularizing of literature and of classical learning did not meet with universal favor
amongst his countrymen. We read of one Italian who warned Aldus that if he kept on spreading
Italian scholarship beyond the Alps at nominal prices the outer barbarians would no longer
come to Italy to study Greek, but would stay at home and read their Aldine editions without
adding a penny to the income of Italian cities. Such a fear was not unfounded, for the poorer
scholars of Germany and the Netherlands did actually find that they could stay at home and
get for a few francs the ripest results of Italian and Greek scholarship. This gave Aldus no
concern; if he could render international services to learning, if he could help to set up
among the humbler scholars of other lands such a fine rivalry of competitive coöperation as
already existed among such leaders as Erasmus and Sir Thomas More, he should be well content
to live laborious days and to die poor. Both these he did; but he gathered around him such
a company of friends and collaborators as few men have enjoyed; he must have breathed with
a rare exhilaration, born of honest and richly productive toil, the very air of Athens in her
glory; and he must have realized sometimes amid the dust and heat of the printing shop that
it was given to him at much cost of life and grinding toil to stand upon the threshold of the
golden age alike of typography and of the revival of learning. In 1514, the year before his
death, Aldus wrote to a friend a letter of which I borrow a translation from George Haven Putnam's
Books and Their Makers during the Middle Ages. This is the picture Aldus drew of his daily routine:

          "I am hampered in my work by a thousand
          interruptions. Nearly every hour comes a letter
          from some scholar, and if I undertook to reply to
          them all, I should be obliged to devote day and
          night to scribbling. Then through the day come
          calls from all kinds of visitors. Some desire
          merely to give a word of greeting, others want to
          know what there is new, while the greater number
          come to my office because they happen to have
          nothing else to do. 'Let us look in upon Aldus,'
          they say to each other. Then they loaf in and sit
          and chatter to no purpose. Even these people with
          no business are not so bad as those who have a
          poem to offer or something in prose (usually very
          prosy indeed) which they wish to see printed with
          the name of Aldus. These interruptions are now
          becoming too serious for me, and I must take steps
          to lessen them. Many letters I simply leave
          unanswered, while to others I send very brief
          replies; and as I do this not from pride or from
          discourtesy, but simply in order to be able to go
          on with my task of printing good books, it must
          not be taken hardly. As a warning to the heedless
          visitors who use up my office hours to no purpose,
          I have now put up a big notice on the door of my
          office to the following effect: Whoever thou art,
          thou art earnestly requested by Aldus to state thy
          business briefly and to take thy departure
          promptly. In this way thou mayest be of service
          even as was Hercules to the weary Atlas. For this
          is a place of work for all who enter."
