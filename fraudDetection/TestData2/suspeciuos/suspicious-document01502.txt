'An address?  Whose?'

'Well,' he said, without looking at her, 'I fancy there are still some of the Blakes, (the
word came out with a certain effort) 'living at Bilton, and perhaps you could find out from
them the address I want; or, perhaps,' he added quickly, for she understood now, and eager
words were on her lips, 'perhaps you know.

He had not slept very much during the night, for his mind had been too full of the change that
was coming in his life, and of the difference that the presence of Edith and little Zoe would
make in the dull, old house.  Sad and worn and altered, was she!  Ah! that would soon pass
away with kindness and care and happiness, and the cough that had sounded so hollow and ominous
should be nursed away, and Edith should be a girl again, a girl as she ought to be yet by right
of her years; and those five years of suffering and estrangement should be altogether forgotten
as if they had never been.

He went into the bedroom next his, that had been Edith's--that was to be Edith's again--and,
looking round it, noticed with satisfaction that Jane had kept it just as it had been in the
old days; and he pushed the bed a little to one side to make room for a cot to stand beside
it, a cot which he remembered in the night as having stood for years in the lumber-room up
in the roof, and which he now with much difficulty dragged out from behind some heavy boxes,
and fitted together, wishing there had been time to give it a coat of paint, and yet glad,
with a tremulous sort of gladness, that there was not, seeing that it would be wanted that
very night.

And just then Jane Sands came up to call him to breakfast, and stood looking from the cot to
her master's dusty coat, with such a look of delighted comprehension on her face, that the
organist felt that no words were needed to prepare her for what was going to happen.

'I thought,' he said, 'it had better be brought down.'

'Where shall it go?' she asked.

'In Miss----in the room next mine,' he said, 'and it will want a good airing.'

'Shall I make up the bed too?' she asked.

'Yes, you may as well.'

'Oh, master,' she said, the tears shaking in her voice and shining in her eyes; 'will they
be wanted soon?  Will they, maybe, be wanted to-night?'

His own voice felt suspiciously shaky; his own eyes could not see the old cot, nor Jane's beaming
face quite plainly, so he only gave a gruff assent and turned away.

'What a good, kind creature she is!' he thought.  'What a welcome she will give Edith and Edith's
little Zoe!'

During the morning he heard her up in the room sweeping and scrubbing, as if for these five
years it had been left a prey to dust and dirt; and when he went out after dinner to give a
lesson at Bilton, she was still at it with an energy worthy of a woman, half her age.

That stupid little girl at Bilton, who generally found her music-lesson such an intolerable
weariness to the flesh, and was conscious that it was no less so to her teacher, found the
half-hour to-day quite pleasant.  Mr Robins had never been so kind and cheerful, quite amusing,
laughing at her mistakes, and allowing her to play just the things she knew best, and to get
up in the middle of the lesson to go to the window and see a long procession of gypsy vans
going by to Smithurst fair.

It was such a very beautiful day; perhaps it was this that produced such a good effect on the
organist's temper.  There had been a frost that morning, but it was not enough to strip the
trees, but only to turn the elms a richer gold, and the beeches a warmer red, and the oaks
a ruddier brown; while in the hedges the purple dogwood, and hawthorn, and bramble leaves made
a wonderful variety of rich tints in the full bright sunshine, which set the birds twittering
with a momentary delusion that it might be spring.
