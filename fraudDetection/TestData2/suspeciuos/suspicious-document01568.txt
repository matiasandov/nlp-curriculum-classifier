I was thunderstruck. The expedition against England, I knew, was no new project. Three years
before a secret envoy from the Queen of Scots, an Italian named Ridolfi, had come to propose
to Philip that, in concert with the Pope, he should reestablish the Catholic faith in England
and place Mary Stuart upon the throne. It was a scheme attractive to Philip, since it agreed
at once with his policy and his religion. But it had been abandoned under the dissuasions of
Alva, who accounted that it would be too costly even if successful. Here it was again, emanating
now directly from the Holy See, but in a slightly altered form.

"Why Don John of Austria?" I asked him.

"A great soldier of the faith. And the Queen of Scots must have a husband."

"I should have thought that she had had husbands enough by now," said I.

"His Holiness does not appear to share that view," he answered tartly.

"I wonder will the King," said I.

"The Catholic King is ever an obedient child of Mother Church," the oily Nuncio reminded me,
to reprove my doubt.

But I knew better--that the King's own policy was the measure of his obedience. This the Nuncio
should learn for himself; for if I knew anything of Philip's mind, I knew precisely how he
would welcome this proposal.

"Will you see the King now?" I suggested maliciously, anxious to witness the humbling of his
priestly arrogance.

"Not yet. It is upon that I came to see you. I am instructed first to consult with one Escoda
as to the manner in which this matter shall be presented to His Majesty. Who is Escoda?"

"I never heard of him," said I. "Perhaps he comes from Rome."

"No, no. Strange!" he muttered, frowning, and plucked a parchment from his sleeve. "It is here."
He peered slowly at the writing, and slowly spelled out the name: "Juan de Escoda."

In a flash it came to me.

"Escovedo you mean," I cried,

"Yes, yes--Escovedo, to be sure," he agreed, having consulted the writing once more. "Where is he?"

"On his way to Madrid with Don John," I informed him. "He is Don John's secretary."

"I will do nothing, then, until he arrives," he said, and took his leave.

Oh, monstrous indiscretion! That dispatch from Rome so cunningly and secretly contrived in
cipher had yet contained no warning that Escovedo's share in this should be concealed. There
are none so imprudent as the sly. I sought the King at once, and told him all that I had learnt.
He was aghast. Indeed, I never saw him more near to anger. For Philip of Spain was not the
man to show wrath or any other emotion. He had a fish-like, cold, impenetrable inscrutability.
True, his yellow skin grew yellower, his gaping mouth gaped wider, his goggle eyes goggled
more than usual. Left to himself, I think he would have disgraced Don John and banished Escovedo
there and then, as he did, indeed, suggest. And I have since had cause enough to wish to God
that I had left him to himself.

"Who will replace Don John in Flanders?" I asked him quietly. He stared at me. "He is useful
to you there. Use him, Sire, to your own ends."

"But they will press this English business."

"Acquiesce."

"Acquiesce? Are you mad?"

"Seem to acquiesce. Temporize. Answer them, 'One thing at a time.' Say, 'When the Flanders
business is happily concluded, we will think of England.' Give them hope that success in Flanders
will dispose you to support the other project. Thus you offer Don John an incentive to succeed,
yet commit yourself to nothing."

"And this dog Escovedo?"

"Is a dog who betrays himself by his bark. We will listen for it."

And thus it was determined; thus was Don John suckled on the windy pap of hope when presently
he came to Court with Escovedo at his heels. Distended by that empty fare he went off to the
Low Countries, leaving Escovedo in Madrid to represent him, with secret instructions to advance
his plans.

Now Escovedo's talents were far inferior to my conception of them.

He was just a greedy schemer, without the wit to dissemble his appetite or the patience necessary
to secure attainment.

Affairs in Flanders went none too well, yet that did not set a curb upon him. He pressed his
master's business upon the King with an ardour amounting to disrespect, and disrespect was
a thing the awful majesty of Philip could never brook. Escovedo complained of delays, of indecision,
and finally--in the summer of '76--he wrote the King a letter of fierce upbraidings, criticizing
his policy in terms that were contemptuous, and which entirely exasperated Philip.

It was in vain I strove to warn the fellow of whither he was drifting; in vain I admonished
and sought to curb his headlong recklessness. I have said that I had a friendship for him,
and because of that I took more pains, perhaps, than I should have taken in another's case.

"Unless you put some judgment into that head of yours, my friend, you will leave it in this
business," I told him one day.

He flung into a passion at the admonition, heaped abuse upon me, swore that it was I who thwarted
him, I who opposed the fulfilment of Don John's desires and fostered the dilatory policy of
the King.

I left him after that to pursue his course, having no wish to quarrel with this headstrong
upstart; yet, liking him as I did, I spared no endeavour to shield him from the consequences
he provoked. But that letter of his to Philip made the task a difficult one. Philip showed
it to me.

"If that man," he said, "had uttered to my face what he has dared to write, I do not think
I should have been able to contain myself without visible change of countenance. It is a sanguinary
letter."

I set myself to calm him as best I could.

"The man is indiscreet, which has its advantage, for we always know whither an indiscreet man
is heading. His zeal for his master blinds him and makes him rash. It is better, perhaps, than
if he were secretive and crafty."

With such arguments I appeased his wrath against the secretary. But I knew that his hatred
of Escovedo, his thirst for Escovedo's blood, dated from that moment in which Escovedo had
forgotten the reverence due to majesty. I was glad when at last he took himself off to Flanders
to rejoin Don John. But that was very far from setting a term to his pestering. The Flanders
affair was going so badly that the hopes of an English throne to follow were dwindling fast.
Something else must be devised against the worst, and now Don John and Escovedo began to consider
the acquisition of power in Spain itself. Their ambition aimed at giving Don John the standing
of an Infante. Both of them wrote to me to advance this fresh project of theirs, to work for
their recall, so that they could ally themselves with my party--the Archbishop's party--and
ensure its continuing supreme. Escovedo wrote me a letter that was little better than an attempt
to bribe me. The King was ageing, and the Prince was too young to relieve him of the heavy
duties of State. Don John should shoulder these, and in so doing Escovedo and myself should
be hoisted into greater power.

I carried all those letters to the King, and at his suggestion I even pretended to lend an
ear to these proposals that we might draw from Escovedo a fuller betrayal of his real ultimate
aims. It was dangerous, and I enjoined the King to move carefully.

"Be discreet," I warned him, "for if my artifice were discovered, I should not be of any further
use to you at all. In my conscience I am satisfied that in acting as I do I am performing no
more than my duty. I require no theology other than my own to understand that much."

"My theology," he answered me, "takes much the same view. You would have failed in your duty
to God and me had you failed to enlighten me on the score of this deception. These things,"
he added in a dull voice, "appal me."

So I wrote to Don John, urging him as one who counselled him for his good, who had no interest
but his own at heart, to remain in Flanders until the work there should be satisfactorily completed.
He did so, since he was left no choice in the matter, but the intrigues continued. Later we
saw how far he was from having forsaken his dreams of England, when I discovered that he had
engaged the Pope to assist him with six thousand men and one hundred and fifty thousand ducats
when the time for that adventure should be ripe.

And then, quite suddenly, entirely unheralded, Escovedo reappeared in Madrid, having come to
press Philip in person for reinforcements that should enable Don John to finish the campaign.
He brought news that there had been a fresh rupture of the patched-up peace, that Don John
had taken the field once more, and had forcibly made himself master of Namur. This was contrary
to all the orders we had sent, a direct overriding of Philip's wishes. The King desired peace
in the Low Countries because he was in no case just then to renew the war, and Escovedo's impudently
couched demands completed his exasperation.

"My will," he said, "is as naught before the ambitions of these two. You sent my clear instructions
to Escovedo, who was placed with Don John that he might render him pliant to my wishes. Instead,
he stiffens him in rebellion. There must be an end to this man."

"Sire," I cried, "it may be they think to advance your interests."

"Heaven help me!" he cried. "Did ever villain wear so transparent a mask as this dog Escovedo?
To advance my interests--that will be his tale, no doubt. He will advance them where I do not
wish them advanced; he will advance them to my ruin; he will stake all on a success in Flanders
that shall be the preliminary to a descent upon England in the interests of Don John. I say
there must be an end to this man before he works more mischief."

Again I set myself to calm him, as I had so often done before, and again I was the shield between
Escovedo and the royal lightnings, of whose menace to blot him out the fool had no suspicion.
For months things hung there, until, in January of '78, when war had been forced in earnest
upon Spain by Elizabeth's support of the Low Countries, Don John won the great victory of Gemblours.
This somewhat raised the King's depression, somewhat dissipated his overgrowing mistrust of
his half-brother, and gave him patience to read the letters in which Don John urged him to
send money--to throw wood on the fire whilst it was alight, or else resign himself to the loss
of Flanders for all time. As it meant also resigning himself to the loss of all hope of England
for all time, Escovedo's activities were just then increased a hundredfold.

"Send me money and Escovedo," was the burden of the almost daily letters from Don John to me,
and at my elbow was Escovedo, perpetually pressing me to bend the King to his master's will.
Another matter on which he pressed me then was that I should obtain for himself the governorship
of the Castle of Mogro, which commands the port of Santander, an ambition this which intrigued
me deeply, for I confess I could not fathom what it had to do with all the rest.

And then something else happened. From the Spanish Ambassador at the Louvre we learnt one day
of a secret federation entered into between Don John and the Guises, known as the Defence of
the Two Crowns. Its object was as obscure as its title. But it afforded the last drop to the
cup of Philip's mistrust. This time it was directly against Don John that he inveighed to me.
And to defend Don John, in the interests of common justice, I was forced to place the blame
where it belonged.

"Nay, Sire," I assured him, "these ambitions are not Don John's. With all his fevered dreams
of greatness, Don John has ever been, will ever be, loyal to his King."

"If you know anything of temptation," he answered me, "you should know that there is a breaking-point
to every man's resistance of it. How long will Don John remain loyal while Escovedo feeds his
disloyalty, adds daily to the weight of temptation the burden of a fresh ambition? I tell you,
man, I feel safe no longer." He rose up before me, a blotch on his sallow face, his fingers
tugging nervously at the tuft of straw-coloured beard. "I tell you some blow is about to fall
unless we avert it. This man this fellow Escovedo--must be dispatched before he can kill us."

I shrugged and affected carelessness to soothe him.

"A contemptible dreamer," I said. "Pity him, Sire. He has his uses. To remove him would be
to remove a channel through which we can always obtain knowledge precisely of what is doing."

Again I prevailed, and there the matter hung a while. But the King was right, his fears were
well inspired. Escovedo, always impatient, was becoming desperate under persistent frustration.
I reasoned with him--was he not still my friend?--I held him off, urged prudence and patience
upon him, and generally sought to temporize. I was as intent upon saving him from leaving his
skin in this business as I was, on the other hand, intent upon doing my duty without pause
or scruple to my King. But the fool forced my hand. A Court is a foul place always, even so
attenuated a Court as that which Philip of Spain encouraged. Rumour thrives in it, scandal
blossoms luxuriantly in its fetid atmosphere. And rumour and scandal had been busy with the
Princess of Eboli and me, though I did not dream it.

We had been indiscreet, no doubt. We had been seen together in public too often. We had gone
to the play together more than once; she had been present with me at a bull-fight on one occasion,
and it was matter of common gossip, as I was to learn, that I was a too frequent visitor at
her house.

Another visitor there was Escovedo when in Madrid. Have I not said that in his early days he
had been one of Eboli's secretaries? On that account the house of Eboli remained open to him
at all times. The Princess liked him, was kindly disposed towards him, and encouraged his visits.
We met there more than once. One day we left together, and that day the fool set spark to a
train that led straight to the mine on which, all unconsciously, he stood.

"A word of advice in season, Don Antonio," he said as we stepped forth together. "Do not go
so often to visit the Princess."

I sought to pull my arm from his, but he dung to it and pinned it to his side.

"Nay, now--nay, now!" he soothed me. "Not so hot, my friend. What the devil have I said to
provoke resentment? I advise you as your friend."

"In future advise that other friend of yours, the devil," I answered angrily, and pulled my
arm away at last. "Don Juan, you have presumed, I think. I did not seek your advice. It is
yourself that stands in need of advice this moment more than any man in Spain."

"Lord of the World," he exclaimed in amiable protest, "listen to him! I speak because I owe
friendship to the Princess. Men whisper of your comings and goings, I tell you. And the King,
you know well, should he hear of this I am in danger of losing my only friend at Court, and so--"

"Another word of this," I broke in fiercely, "now or at any other time, and I'll skewer you
like a rabbit!"

I had stopped. My face was thrust within a hand's-breadth of his own; I had tossed back my
cloak, and my fingers clutched the hilt of my sword. He became grave. His fine eyes--he had
great, sombre, liquid eyes, such as you'll scarcely ever see outside of Spain--considered me
thoughtfully a moment. Then he laughed lightly and fell back a pace.

"Pish!" said he. "Saint James! I am no rabbit for your skewering. If it comes to skewers, I
am a useful man of my hands, Antonio. Come, man"--and again he took my arm--"if I presume,
forgive it out of the assurance that I am moved solely by interest and concern for you. We
have been friends too long that I should be denied."

I had grown cool again, and I realized that perhaps my show of anger had been imprudent. So
I relented now, and we went our ways together without further show of ill-humour on my part,
or further advice on his. But the matter did not end there. Indeed, it but began. Going early
in the afternoon of the morrow to visit Anne, I found her in tears--tears, as I was to discover,
of anger.

Escovedo had been to visit her before me, and he had dared to reproach her on the same subject.

"You are talked about, you and Perez," he had informed her, "and the thing may have evil consequences.
It is because I have eaten our bread that I tell you this for your own good."

She had risen up in a great passion.

"You will leave my house, and never set foot in it again," she had told him. "You should learn
that grooms and lackeys have no concern in the conduct of great ladies. It is because you have
eaten my bread that I tell you this for your own good."

It drove him out incontinently, but it left her in the condition in which I was later to discover
her. I set myself to soothe her. I swore that Escovedo should be punished. But she would not
be soothed. She blamed herself for an unpardonable rashness. She should not have taken that
tone with Escovedo. He could avenge himself by telling Philip, and if he told Philip, and Philip
believed him--as Philip would, being jealous and mistrustful beyond all men--my ruin must follow.
She had thought only of herself in dismissing him in that high-handed manner. Coming since
to think of me it was that she had fallen into this despair. She clung to me in tears.

"Forgive me, Antonio. The fault is all mine--the fault of all. Always have I known that this
danger must overhang you as a penalty for loving me. Always I knew it, and, knowing it, I should
have been stronger. I should have sent you from me at the first. But I was so starved of love
from childhood till I met you. I hungered so for love--for your love, Antonio--that I had not
the strength. I was weak and selfish, and because I was ready and glad to pay the price myself,
whatever it should be and whenever asked, I did not take thought enough for you."

"Take no thought now," I implored her, holding her close.

"I must. I can't help it. I have raised this peril for you. He will go to Philip."

"Not he; he dare not. I am his only hope. I am the ladder by which he hopes to scale the heaven
of his high ambition. If he destroys me, there is the kennel for himself. He knows it."

"Do you say that to comfort me, or is it really true?"

"God's truth, sweetheart," I swore, and drew her closer.

She was comforted long before I left her. But as I stepped out into the street again a man
accosted me. Evidently he had been on the watch, awaiting me. He fell into step beside me almost
before I realized his presence. It was Escovedo.

"So," he said, very sinister, "you'll not be warned."

"Nor will you," I answered, no whit less sinister myself.

It was broad daylight. A pale March sunshine was beating down upon the cobbled streets, and
passers-by were plentiful. There was no fingering of hilts or talk of skewering on either side.
Nor must I show any of the anger that was boiling in me. My face was too well known in Madrid
streets, and a Secretary of State does not parade emotions to the rabble. So I walked stiff
and dignified amain, that dog in step with me the while.

"She will have told you what I have said to her," he murmured.

"And what she said to you. It was less than your deserts."

"Groom and lackey, eh?" said he. "And less than I deserve--a man of my estate. Oh, ho! Groom
and lackey! Those are epithets to be washed out in blood and tears."

"You rant," I said.

"Or else to be paid for--handsomely." His tone was sly--so sly that I answered nothing, for
to answer a sly man is to assist him, and my business was to let him betray the cause of this
slyness. Followed a spell of silence. Then, "Do you know," said he, "that several of her relatives
are thinking seriously of killing you?"

"Many men have thought seriously of that--so seriously that they never attempted it. Antonio
Perez is not easily murdered, Don Juan, as you may discover."

It was a boast that I may claim to have since justified.

"Shall I tell you their names?" quoth he.

"If you want to ruin them."

"Ha!" It was a short bark of a laugh. "You talk glibly of ruining--but then you talk to a groom
and lackey." The epithets rankled in his mind; they were poison to his blood, it seemed. It
takes a woman to find words that burn and blister a man. "Yet groom and lackey that I am, I
hold you both in the hollow of my hand. If I close that hand, it will be very bad for you,
very bad for her. If, for instance, I were to tell King Philip that I have seen her in your arms--"

"You dog!"

"I have--I swear to God I have, with these two eyes--at least with one of them, applied to
the keyhole half an hour ago. Her servants passed me in; a ducat or two well bestowed--you
understand?"

We had reached the door of my house. I paused and turned to him.

"You will come in?" I invited.

"As the wolf said to the lamb, eh? Well, why not?" And we went in.

"You are well housed," he commented, his greedy, envious eyes considering all the tokens of
my wealth. "It were a pity to lose so much, I think. The King is at the Escurial, I am told."

He was. He had gone thither into retreat, that he might cleanse his pious, murky soul against
the coming of Eastertide.

"You would not, I am sure, compel me to undertake so tedious a journey," said he.

"Will you put off this slyness and be plain?" I bade him. "You have some bargain in your mind.
Propound it."

He did, and left me aghast.

"You have temporized long enough, Perez," he began. "You have been hunting with the dogs and
running with the stag. There must be an end to all that. Stand by me now, and I will make you
greater than you are, greater than you could ever dream to be. Oppose me, betray me--for I
am going to be very frank--and the King shall hear things from me that will mean your ruin
and hers. You understand?"

Then came his demands. First of all the command of the fortress of Mogro for himself. I must
obtain him that at once. Secondly, I must see to it that Philip pledged himself to support
Don John's expedition against England and Elizabeth and to seat Don John upon the throne with
Mary Stuart for his wife. These things must come about, and quickly, or I perished. Nor was
that all. Indeed, no more than a beginning. He opened out the vista of his dreams, that having
blackmailed me on the one hand, he might now bribe me on the other. Once England was theirs,
he aimed at no less than a descent upon Spain itself. That was why he wanted Mogro to facilitate
a landing at Santander. Thus, as the Christians had originally come down from the mountains
of the Asturias to drive the Moors from the Peninsula, so should the forces of Don John descend
again to reconquer it for himself.

It was a madman's fancy utterly--fruit of a brain that ambition had completely addled; and
I do not believe that Don John had any part in it or even knowledge of it. Escovedo saw himself,
perhaps, upon the throne of one or the other of the two kingdoms as Don John's vice-regent--for
himself and for me, if I stood by him, there was such power in store as no man ever dreamed
of. If I refused, he would destroy me.

"And if I go straight to the Escurial and lay this project before the King?" I asked him.

He smiled.

"You will force me to tell him that it is a lie invented to deliver you from a man who can
destroy you by the knowledge he possesses, knowledge which I shall at once impart to Philip.
Think what that will mean to you. Think," he added very wickedly, "what it will mean to her."

As I am a Christian, I believe that had it been but the consideration of myself I would have
flung him from my house upon the instant and bade him do his worst. But he was well advised
to remind me of her. Whatever Philip's punishment of me, it would be as nothing to his punishment
of that long-suffering woman who had betrayed him. Oh, I assure you it is a very evil, ill
judged thing to have a king for rival, particularly a fish-souled tyrant of King Philip's kind.

I was all limp with dread. I passed a hand across my brow, and found it chill and moist.

"I am in your hands, Escovedo," I confessed miserably.

"Say, rather, that we are partners. Forget all else." He was eager, joyous, believing all accomplished,
such was his faith in my influence with Philip. "And now, Mogro for me, and England for Don
John. About it with dispatch."

"The King is in retreat. We must wait some days."

"Till Easter, then." And he held out his hand. I took it limply, thus clenching the bargain
of infamy between us. What else was there for me. What, otherwise, was to become of Anne?

Oh, I may have been self-seeking and made the most of my position, as was afterwards urged
against me. I may have been extortionate and venal, and I may have taken regal bribes to expedite
affairs. But always was I loyal and devoted to the King. Never once had I been bribed to aught
that ran counter to his interests; never until now, when at a stroke I had sold my honour and
pledged myself to this betrayal of my trust.

Not in all Spain was there a more miserable man than I. All night I sat in the room where I
was wont to work, and to my wife's entreaties that I should take some rest I answered that
the affairs of Spain compelled attention. And when morning found me haggard and distraught
came a courier from Philip with a letter.

"I have letters from Don John," he wrote, "more insistent than ever in their tone. He demands
the instant dispatch of money and Escovedo. I have been thinking, and this letter confirms
my every fear. I have cause to apprehend some stroke that may disturb the public peace and
ruin Don John himself if he is allowed to retain Escovedo any longer in his service. I am writing
to Don John that I will see to it that Escovedo is promptly dispatched as he requests. Do you
see him dispatched, then, in precise accordance with his deserts, and this at once, before
the villain kills us."

My skin bristled as I read. Here was fatality itself at work. Philip was at his old fears--and,
Heaven knows, he was not without justification of his intuitions, as I had learnt by now--that
Escovedo meditated the most desperate measures. He was urging me again, as he had urged me
before, and more than once, to dispatch this traitor whose restless existence so perpetually
perturbed him. I was not deceived as to the meaning he set upon that word "dispatch." I knew
quite well the nature of the dispatch he bade me contrive.

Conceive now my temptation. Escovedo dead, I should be safe, and Anne would be safe, and this
without any such betrayal as was being forced upon me. And that death the King himself commanded
a secret, royal execution, such as his confessor Frey Diego de Chaves has since defended as
an expedient measure within the royal prerogative. He had commanded it before quite unequivocally,
but always I had stood between Escovedo and the sword. Was I to continue in that attitude?
Could it humanly be expected of me in all the circumstances again to seek to deflect the royal
wrath from that too daring head? I was, after all, only a man, subject to the temptations of
the flesh, and there was a woman whom I loved better than my own salvation to whose peace and
happiness that fellow Escovedo was become a menace.

If he lived, and for as long as he lived, she and I were to be as slaves of his will, and I
was to drag my honour and my loyalty through the foul kennels of his disordered ambitions.
And the King my master was bidding me clearly see to it that he died immediately.

I sat down and wrote at once, and the burden of my letter was: "Be more explicit, Sire. What
manner of dispatch is it your will that Escovedo should be given?"

On the morrow, which was Thursday of Holy Week, that note of mine was returned to me, and on
the margin of it, in Philip's own hand, Escovedo's death-warrant. "I mean that it would be
well to hasten the death of this rascal before some act of his should render it too late; for
he never rests, nor will anything turn him from his usual ways. Do it, then, and do it quickly,
before he kills us."

There was no more to be said. My instructions were clear and definite. Obedience alone remained.
I went about it.

Just as all my life I have been blessed with the staunchest friends, so have I, too, been blessed
with the most faithful servants. And of these none was more faithful than my steward, Diego
Martinez, unless, indeed, it be my equerry, Gil de Mesa, who to this day follows my evil fortunes.
But Mesa at that time was as yet untried, whilst in Diego I knew that I had a man devoted to
me heart and soul, a man who would allow himself to be torn limb from limb on the rack on my
behalf.

I placed the affair in Diego's hands. I told him that I was acting under orders from the King,
and that the thing at issue was the private execution of a dangerous traitor, who could not
be brought to trial lest there he should impeach of complicity one whose birth and blood must
be shielded from all scandal. I bade him get what men he required, and see the thing done with
the least possible delay. And thereupon I instantly withdrew from Madrid and went to Alcala.

Diego engaged five men to assist him in the task; these were a young officer named Enriquez,
a lackey named Rubio, the two Aragonese--Mesa and Insausti--and another whose name was Bosque.
He clearly meant to take no chances, but I incline to think that he overdid precaution, and
employed more hands than were necessary for the job. However, the six of them lurked in waiting
on three successive nights for Escovedo near his house in the little square of Santiago. At
last, on the night of Easter Monday, March 31st, they caught him and dispatched him. He died
almost before he realized himself beset, from a sword-thrust with which Insausti transfixed
him. But there were at least half a dozen wounds in the body when it was found. Diego, I have
said, was a man who made quite certain.

No sooner was it done than they dispersed, whilst the lackey Rubio, instantly quitting Madrid,
brought me news of the deed to Alcala, and the assurance that no arrests had been made. But
there was a great ado in Madrid upon the morrow, as you may imagine, for it is no everyday
occurrence to find a royal secretary murdered in the streets.

The alcaldes set out upon a rigorous search, and they began by arresting and questioning all
who attempted to leave the city. On the next day they harassed with their perquisitions all
those who let lodgings. They were still at this work in the evening when I returned to Madrid,
brought back--as it would seem--from my country rest by the news of this murder of my friend
and colleague. I bore myself as I should have done had I no knowledge of how the thing had
been contrived. That was a necessity as imperative as it was odious, and no part of it more
odious than the visit of condolence I was forced to pay to the Escovedo family, which I found
plunged in grief.

From the very outset suspicion pointed its finger at me, although there were no visible traces
to connect me with the deed. Rumour, however, was astir, and as I had powerful friends, so,
too, I had the powerful enemies which envy must always be breeding for men in high places such
as mine. Escovedo's wife mistrusted me, though at first she seems equally to have suspected
in this deed the hand of the Duke of Alva, who was hostile to Don John and all his creatures.
Very soon, as a result of this, came the Court alcalde to visit and question me. His stated
object was in the hope that I might give him information which would lead to the discovery
of the assassin; but his real object, rendered apparent by the searching, insistent nature
of his questions, was to lead me to incriminate myself. I presented a bold front. I pretended
to see in this, perhaps, the work of the Flemish States. I deplored--that I might remind him
of it--my absence from Madrid at the time.

He was followed by another high official, who came in simulated friendship to warn me that
certain rumours linking me with the deed were in circulation, in reality to trap me into some
admission, to watch my countenance for some betraying sign.

I endured it stoutly, but inwardly I was shaken, as I wrote to Philip, giving him full details
of what had been said and what answers I had returned, what bitter draughts I had been forced
to swallow.

He wrote in reply: "I find that you answered very well. Continue to be prudent. They will tell
you a thousand things, not for the sake of telling them, but in the hope of drawing something
out of you. The bitter draughts you mention are inevitable. But use all the dissimulation and
address of which you are capable."

We corresponded daily after that, and I told him of every step I took; how I kept my men about
me, for fear that if they attempted to leave Madrid they would be arrested, and how, finally,
I contrived their departure one by one, under conditions that placed them beyond all suspicion.
Juan de Mesa set out for Aragon on a mission concerned with the administration of some property
of the Princess of Eboli's. Rubio, Insausti, and Enriquez were each given an ensign's commission,
bearing the King's own signature, and ordered to join the armies in various parts of Italy;
the first was sent to Milan, the second to Sicily, and the last to Naples. Bosque went back
to Aragon. Thus all were placed beyond the reach of the active justice of Castile, all save
myself--and the King, who wrote to me expressing his satisfaction that there had been no arrests.

But rumour continued to give tongue, and the burden of its tale was that the murder had been
my work, in complicity with the Princess of Eboli. How they came to drag her name into the
affair I do not know. It may have been pure malice trading upon its knowledge of the relations
between us. She may have lent colour to the charge by her own precipitancy in denying it. She
announced indignantly that she was being accused, almost before this had come to pass, and
as indignantly protested against the accusation, and threatened those who dared to voice it.

The end of it all was that, a month later, the Escovedo family drew up a memorial for the consideration
of the King, in which they laid the murder to my charge, and Philip consented to receive Don
Pedro de Escovedo--the dead man's son--and promised him that he would consider the memorial,
and that he would deliver up to justice whomsoever he thought right. He was embarrassed by
these demands of the Escovedos, my own danger, his duty as king, and his interests as an accomplice,
or, rather, as the originator of the deed.

The Escovedos were powerfully seconded by Vasquez, the Secretary of the Council, a member of
Alva's party, a secret enemy of my own, consumed by jealousy of my power, and no longer fearing
to disclose himself and assail me since he believed himself possessed of the means of ruining
me. He spoke darkly to the King of a woman concerned in this business, without yet daring to
mention Anne by name, and urged him for the satisfaction of the State, where evil rumours were
abroad, to order an inquiry that should reveal the truth of the affair.

It was Philip himself who informed me of what had passed, sneering at the wildness of rumours
that missed the truth so wildly, and when I evinced distress at my position, he sought to reassure
me; he even wrote to me after I had left him: "As long as I live you have nothing to fear.
Others may change, but I never change, as you should know who know me."

That was a letter that epitomized many others written me in those days to Madrid from the Escurial,
whither he had returned. And those letters comforted me not only by their expressed assurances,
but by the greater assurance implicit in them of the King's good faith. I had by now a great
mass of his notes dealing with the Escovedo business, in almost every one of which he betrayed
his own share as the chief murderer, showing that I was no more than his dutiful instrument
in that execution. With those letters in my power what need I ever fear? Not Philip himself
would dare to betray me.

But I went now in a new dread--the dread of being myself murdered. There were threats of it
in the air. The Escovedo family and their partisans, who included all my enemies, and even
some members of the Eboli family, who considered that I had sullied the honour of their name
by my relations with Anne, talked openly of vengeance, so that I was driven to surround myself
by armed attendants whenever now I went abroad.

I appealed again to Philip to protect me. I even begged him to permit me to retire from my
Ministerial office, that thus the clamant envy that inspired my persecution might be deprived
of its incentive. Finally, I begged him to order me to stand my trial, that thus, since I was
confident that no evidence could be produced against me, I should force an acquittal from the
courts and lay the matter to rest for all time.

"Go and see the President of Castile," he bade me. "Tell him the causes that led to the death
of Escovedo, and then let him talk to Don Pedro de Escovedo and to Vasquez, so as to induce
them to desist."

I did as I was bidden, and when the president, who was the Bishop of Pati, had heard me, he
sent for my two chief enemies.

"I have, Don Pedro," he said, "your memorial to the King in which you accuse Don Antonio Perez
of the murder of your father. And I am to assure you in the King's name that justice will be
done upon the murderer, whoever he may be, without regard to rank. But I am first to engage
you to consider well what evidence you have to justify your charge against a person of such
consideration. For should your proofs be insufficient I warn you that matters are likely to
take a bad turn for yourself. Finally, before you answer me, let me add, upon my word as a
priest, that Antonio Perez is as innocent as I am."

It was the truth--the absolute truth, so far as it was known to Philip and to the Bishop--for,
indeed, I was no more than the instrument of my master's will.

Don Pedro looked foolish, almost awed. He was as a man who suddenly becomes aware that he has
missed stepping over the edge of a chasm in which destruction awaited him. He may have bethought
him at last that all his rantings had no better authority than suspicions which no evidence
could support.

"Sir," he faltered, "since you tell me this, I pledge you my word on behalf of myself and my
family to make no more mention of this death against Don Antonio."

The Bishop swung then upon Vasquez, and his brow became furrowed with contemptuous anger.

"As for you, sir, you have heard--which was more than your due, for it is not your business
by virtue of your office, nor have you any obligations towards the deceased, such as excuse
Don Pedro's rashness, to pursue the murderers of Escovedo. Your solicitude in this matter brings
you under a suspicion the more odious since you are a priest. I warn you, sir, to abstain,
for this affair is different far from anything that you imagine."

But envy is a fierce goad, a consuming, irresistible passion, corroding wisdom and deaf to
all prudent counsels. Vasquez could not abstain. Ridden by his devil of spite and jealousy,
he would not pause until he had destroyed either himself or me.

Since Escovedo's immediate family now washed their hands of the affair, Vasquez sought out
more distant relatives of the murdered man, and stirred them up until they went in their turn
to pester the courts, not only with accusations against myself, but with accusations that now
openly linked with mine the name of the Princess of Eboli.

We were driven to the brink of despair, and in this Anne wrote to Philip. It was a madness.
She made too great haste to excuse herself. She demanded protection from Vasquez and the evil
rumours he was putting abroad, implored the King to make an example of men who could push so
far their daring and irreverence, and to punish that Moorish dog Vasquez--I dare say there
was Moorish blood in the fellow's veins--as he deserved.

I think our ruin dated from that letter. Philip sent for me to the Escurial. He wished to know
more precisely what the accusations were. I told him, denying them. Then he desired of the
Princess proof of what she alleged against Vasquez, and she had no difficulty in satisfying
him. He seemed to believe our assurance that all was lies. Yet he did not move to punish Vasquez.
But then I knew that sluggishness was his great characteristic. "Time and I are one," he would
say when I pressed on matters.

After that it was open war in the Council between me and Vasquez. The climax came when I was
at the Escurial. I had sent a servant to Vasquez for certain State papers to be submitted to
the King. He brought them, and folded in them a fiercely denunciatory letter full of insults
and injuries, not the least of which was the imputation that my blood was not clean, my caste
not good.

In a passion I sought Philip, beside myself almost, trembling under the insult.

"See, Sire, what this Moorish thief has dared to write me. It transcends all bearing. Either
you take satisfaction for me of these insults or you permit me to take it for myself."

He appeared to share my indignation, promised to give me leave to proceed against the man,
but bade me first wait a while until certain business in the competent hands of Vasquez should
be transacted. But weeks grew into months, and nothing was done. We were in April of '79, a
year after the murder, and I was grown so uneasy, so sensitive to dangers about me, that I
dared no longer visit Anne. And then Philip's confessor, Frey Diego de Chaves, came to me one
day with a request on the King's part that I should make my peace with Vasquez.

"If he will retract," was my condition. And Chaves went to see my enemy. What passed between
them, what Vasquez may have told him, what he may have added to those rumours of my relations
with Anne, I do not know. But I know that from that date there was a change in the King's attitude
towards me, a change in the tone of the letters that he sent me, and, this continuing, I wrote
to him at last releasing him from his promise to afford me satisfaction against Vasquez, assuring
him that since, himself, he could forgive the injuries against us both, I could easily forgive
those I had received myself, and finally begging his permission to resign my office and retire.

Anne had contributed to this. She had sent for me, and in tears had besought me to make my
peace with Vasquez since the King desired it, and this was no time in which to attempt resistance
to his wishes. I remained with her some hours, comforting her, for she was in the very depths
of despair, persuaded that we were both ruined, and inconsolable in the thought that the blame
of this was all her own.

It may be that I was watched, perhaps more closely than I imagined. It may be that spies were
close about us, set by the jealous Philip, who desired confirmation or refutation of the things
he had been told, the rumours that were gnawing at his vitals.

I left her, little dreaming that I was never to see her again in this life. That night I was
arrested at my house by the Court alcalde upon an order from the King. The paltry reason advanced
was my refusal to make my peace with Vasquez, and this when already the King was in possession
of my letter acknowledging my readiness to do so; for the King was in Madrid, unknown to me.
He came, it seems, that he might be present at another arrest effected that same night. From
the porch of the Church of Santa Maria Mayor, he watched his alguazils enter the house of the
Princess of Eboli, bring her forth, bestow her in a waiting carriage that was to bear her away
to the fortress of Pinto, to an imprisonment which was later exchanged for exile to Pastrana
lasting as long as life itself.

To sin against a Prince is worse, it seems, than to sin against God Himself. For God forgives,
but princes, wounded in their vanity and pride, know nothing of forgiveness.

I was kept for four months a prisoner by the alcalde, no charge being preferred against me.
Then, because my health was suffering grievously from confinement and the anxiety of suspense,
I was moved to my own house, and detained there for another eight months under close guard.
My friends besought the King in vain either to restore me to liberty or to bring me to trial.
He told them the affair was of a nature very different from anything they deemed, and so evaded
all demands.

In the summer of 1580, Philip went to Lisbon to take formal possession of the crown of Portugal,
which he had inherited. I sent my wife to him to intercede for me. But he refused to see her,
and so I was left to continue the victim of his vindictive lethargy. After a year of this,
upon my giving a formal promise to renounce all hostility towards Vasquez, and never seek to
do him harm in any way, I was accorded some degree of liberty. I was allowed to go out and
to receive visitors, but not to visit any one myself.

Followed a further pause. Vasquez was now a man of power, for my party had fallen with me,
and his own had supplanted it in the royal councils. It was by his work that at last, in '84,
I was brought to trial upon a charge of corruption and misappropriation. I knew that my enemies
had, meanwhile, become possessed of Enriquez, and that he was ready to give evidence, that
he was making no secret of his share in the death of Escovedo, and that the King was being
pressed by the Escovedos to bring me to trial upon the charge of murder. Instead, the other
charge alone was preferred.

It was urged against me that I had kept a greater state than any grandee of Spain, that when
I went abroad I did so with a retinue befitting a prince, that I had sold my favour and accepted
bribes from foreign princes to guard their interests with the King of Spain.

They sentenced me to two years' imprisonment in a fortress, to be followed by ten years of
exile, and I was to make, within nine days, restitution of some twenty million maravedis*--the
alleged extent of my misappropriations--besides some jewels and furniture which I had received
from the Princess of Eboli, and which I was now ordered to deliver up to the heirs of the late
Prince.

         *Ten thousand pounds, but with at least five times the
          present purchasing power of that sum.

Perquisitions had been made in my house, and my papers ransacked. Well I knew what they had
sought. For the thought of the letters that had passed between Philip and myself at the time
of Escovedo's death must now be troubling his peace of mind. I had taken due precautions when
first I had seen the gathering clouds foreshadowing this change of weather. I had bestowed
those papers safely in two iron-bound chests which had been concealed away against the time
when I might need them to save my neck. And because now he failed to find what he sought--the
evidence of his own share in the deed and his present base duplicity--Philip dared not slip
the leash from those dogs who would be at my throat for the murder of Escovedo. That was why
he bade them proceed against me only on the lesser charge of corruption.

I was taken to the fortress of Turruegano, and there they came to demand of me the surrender
of my papers which the alcalde had failed to discover at my house. I imagined the uneasiness
of Philip in dispatching those emissaries. I almost laughed as I refused. Those papers were
my buckler against worse befalling me than had befallen already. Even now, if too hard pressed,
I might find the opportunity of breaking my bonds by means of them. I sometimes wonder why
I did not apply myself to that. Yet there is small cause for wonder, really. From boyhood,
almost, King Philip had been my master. Loyalty to him was a habit that went to the very roots
of my being. I had served him without conscience and without scruple, and the notion of betraying
him, save as a very last and very desperate resource, was inconceivable. I do not think he
ever knew the depth and breadth of that loyalty of mine.

My refusal led those sons of dogs to attempt to frighten my wife with threats of unmentionable
horrors unless she delivered up the papers I had secreted. She and our children were threatened
with perpetual imprisonment on bread and water if she persisted in refusing to surrender them.
But she held out against all threats, and remained firm even under the oily persecution to
the same end of Philip's confessor, Frey Diego. Finally, I was notified that, in view of her
stubbornness and my own, she and our children were cast into prison, and that there they would
remain until I saw fit to become submissive to the royal will.

It is a subtle form of mental torture that will bid a man contemplate the suffering for his
sake to which those who are dear to him are being subjected.

I raged and stormed before the officer who brought me this infamous piece of news. I gave vent
to my impotent anger in blasphemous expressions that were afterwards to be used against me.
The officer was subtly sympathetic.

"I understand your grief, Don Antonio," he said. "Believe me, I feel for you--so much that
I urge you to set an end to the captivity of those dear ones who are innocent, who are suffering
for your sake."

"And so make an end of myself?" I asked him fiercely.

"Reflection may show that even that is your duty in the circumstances."

I looked into his smug face, and I was within an ace of striking him. Then I controlled myself,
and my will was snapped.

"Very well," I said. "The papers shall be surrendered. Let my steward, Diego Martinez, come
to me here, and he shall receive my instructions to deliver the chests containing them to my
wife, that she in turn may deliver them to the King."

He withdrew, well pleased. No doubt he would take great credit to himself for this. Within
three days, such haste did they make, my faithful steward stood before me in my prison at Turruegano.

You conceive the despair that had overwhelmed me after giving my consent, the consciousness
that it was my life I was surrendering with those papers,--that without them I should be utterly
defenceless. But in the three days that were sped I had been thinking, and not quite in vain.

Martinez left me with precise instructions, as a result of which those two iron-bound chests,
locked and sealed, were delivered, together with the keys, to the royal confessor. Martinez
was asked what they contained.

"I do not know," he answered. "My orders are merely to deliver them."

I can conceive the King's relief and joy in his conviction that thus had he drawn my teeth,
that betide now what might, I could never defend or justify myself. The immediate sequel took
me by surprise. We were at the end of '85, and my health was suffering from my confinement
and its privations. And now my captivity was mitigated. My wife Juana even succeeded in obtaining
permission that I should be taken home to Madrid, and there for fourteen months I enjoyed a
half liberty, and received the visits of my old friends, among whom were numbered most of the
members of the Court.

I imagined at first that since my teeth were drawn the King despised me, and intended nothing
further. But I was soon to be disillusioned on that score. It began with the arrest of Martinez
on a charge of complicity in the murder of Escovedo. And then one day I was again arrested,
without warning, and carried off for a while to the fortress of Pinto. Thence I was brought
back in close captivity to Madrid, and there I learnt at last what had been stirring.

In the previous summer King Philip had gone into Aragon to preside over the Cortes, and Vasquez,
who had gone with him, had seized the opportunity to examine the ensign Enriquez, who had,
meanwhile, denounced himself of complicity in the murder of Escovedo. Enriquez made a full
confession--turned accuser under a promise of full pardon for himself and charged Mesa, Rubio,
and my steward Martinez with complicity, denouncing Martinez as the ringleader of the business.
The other two, Insausti and Bosque, were already dead.

Immediately Vasquez attempted to seize the survivors. But Mesa had gone to earth in Aragon,
and Rubio was with him. Martinez alone remained, and him they seized and questioned. He remained
as cool and master of himself as he was true and loyal to me. Their threats made no impression
on him. He maintained that the tale was all a lie, begotten of spite, that I had been Escovedo's
best friend, that I had been greatly afflicted by his death, and that no man could have done
more than I to discover his real murderers. They confronted him with Enriquez, and the confrontation
no whit disturbed him. He handled the traitor contemptuously as a perjured, suborned witness,
a false servant, a man who, as he proceeded to show, was a scoundrel steeped in crime, whose
word was utterly worthless, and who, no doubt, had been bought to bring these charges against
his sometime master.

The situation, thanks to Martinez's stoutness, had reached a deadlock. Between the assertions
of one man, who was revealed to the judges for a worthless scoundrel, and the denials of the
other, against whom nothing was known, it was impossible for the court of inquiry to reach
any conclusion. At least another witness must be obtained. And Vasquez laboured with all his
might and arts and wiles to draw Rubio out of Aragon into the clutches of the justice of Castile.
But he laboured in vain, for I had secretly found the means to instruct my trusty Mesa to retain
the fellow where he was.

In this inconclusive state of things the months dragged on and my captivity continued. I wrote
to Philip, imploring his mercy, complaining of these unjust delays on the part of Vasquez,
which threatened to go on forever, and begging His Majesty to command the conclusion of the
affair. That was in August of '89. You see how time had sped. All that came of my appeal was
at first an increased rigour of imprisonment, and then a visit from Vasquez to examine and
question me upon the testimony of Enriquez. As you can imagine, the attempt to lure me into
self-betrayal was completely fruitless. My enemy withdrew, baffled, to go question my wife,
but without any better success.

Nevertheless, Vasquez proclaimed the charge established against myself and Martinez, and allowed
us ten days in which to prepare our answer. Immediately upon that Don Pedro de Escovedo lodged
a formal indictment against us, and I was put into irons.

To rebut the evidence of one single, tainted witness I produced six witnesses of high repute,
including the Secretary of the Council of Aragon. They testified for me that I was at Alcala
at the time of Escovedo's death, that I had always been Escovedo's friend, that I was a good
Christian incapable of such a deed, and that Enriquez as an evil man whose word was worthless,
a false witness inspired by vengeance.

Thus, in spite of the ill-will of my judges and the hatred of my enemies, it was impossible
legally to condemn me upon the evidence. There were documents enough in existence to have proved
my part in the affair; but not one of them dared the King produce, since they would also show
me to have been no more than his instrument. And so, desiring my death as it was now clear
he did, he must sit impotently brooding there with what patience he could command, like a gigantic,
evil spider into whose web I obstinately refused to fling myself.

My hopes began to revive. When at last the court announced that it postponed judgment whilst
fresh evidence was sought, there was an outcry of indignation on all sides. This was a tyrannical
abuse of power, men said; and I joined my voice to theirs to demand that judgment be pronounced
and my liberty restored to me, pointing out that I had already languished years in captivity
without any charge against me--beyond that of corruption, which had been purged by now--having
been established.

Then at last the King stirred in his diabolical underground manner. He sent his confessor to
me in prison. The friar was mild and benign.

"My poor friend," he said, "why do you allow yourself to suffer in this fashion, when a word
from you can set a term to it? Confess the deed without fear, since at the same time you can
advance a peremptory reason of State to justify it."

It was too obvious a trap. Did I make confession, indeed, upon such grounds, they would demand
of me proof of what I asserted; and meanwhile the documents to prove it had been extorted from
me and had passed into the King's possession. In the result I should be ruined completely as
one who, to the crime of murder, added a wicked, insidious falsehood touching the honour of
his King.

But I said naught of this. I met guile with guile. "Alas! I have been tempted," I answered
him. "But I thank Heaven I have known even in my extremity how to resist the temptation of
such disloyalty. I cannot forget, Brother Diego, that amongst the letters from the King was
one that said, 'Be not troubled by anything your enemies may do against you. I shall not abandon
you, and be sure their animosity cannot prevail. But you must understand that it must not be
discovered that this death took place by my order."'

"But if the King were to release you from that command?" he asked.

"When His Majesty in his goodness and generosity sends me a note in his own hand to say, 'You
may confess that it was by my express order that you contrived the death of Escovedo,' then
I shall thankfully account myself absolved from the silence his service imposes on me."

He looked at me narrowly. He may have suspected that I saw through the transparent device to
ruin me, and that in a sense I mocked him with my answer.

He withdrew, and for some days nothing further happened. Then the rigours of my captivity were
still further increased. I was allowed to communicate with no one, and even the alguazil who
guarded me was forbidden, under pain of death, to speak to me.

And in January I was visited by Vasquez, who brought me a letter from the King, not, indeed,
addressed to me and in the terms I had suggested, but to Vasquez himself, and it ran:

You may tell Antonio Perez from me, and, if necessary, show him this letter, that he is aware
of my knowledge of having ordered him to put Escovedo to death and of the motives which he
told me existed for this measure; and that as it imports for the satisfaction of my conscience
that it be ascertained whether or not those motives were sufficient, I order him to state them
in the fullest detail, and to advance proof of what he then alleged to me, which is not unknown
to yourself, since I have clearly imparted it to you. When I shall have seen his answers, and
the reasons he advances, I shall give order that such measures be taken as may befit.

I, THE KING

You see what a twist he had given to the facts. It was I who had urged the death of Escovedo;
it was I who had advanced reasons which he had considered sufficient, trusting to my word;
and it was because of this he had consented to give the order. Let me confess so much, let
me prove it, and prove, too, that the motives I had advanced were sound ones, or I must be
destroyed. That was all clear. And that false king held fast the two trunks of papers that
would have given the lie to this atrocious note of his, that would have proved that again and
again I had shielded Escovedo from the death his king designed for him.

I looked into the face of my enemy, and there was a twisted smile on my lips.

"What fresh trap is this?" I asked him. "King Philip never wrote that note."

"You should know his hand. Look closer," he bade me harshly.

"I know his hand--none better. But I claim, too, to know something of his heart. And I know
that it is not the heart of a perjured liar such as penned those lines."

That was as near as a man dared to go in expressing his true opinion of a prince.

"For the rest," I said, "I do not understand it. I know nothing of the death of Escovedo. I
have nothing to add to what already I have said in open court unless it be to protest against
you, who are a passionate, hostile judge."

Six times in the month that followed did Vasquez come to me, accompanied now by a notary, to
press me to confess. At last, seeing that no persuasions could bend my obstinacy, they resorted
to other measures.

"You will drive us to use the torture upon you so that we may loosen your tongue!" snarled
Vasquez fiercely, enraged by my obduracy.

I laughed at the threat. I was a noble of Spain, by birth immune from torture. They dared not
violate the law. But they did dare. There was no law, human or divine, the King was not prepared
to violate so that he might slake his vengeance upon the man who had dared to love where he
had loved.

They delivered me naked into the hands of the executioner, and I underwent the question at
the rope. They warned me that if I lost my life or the use of any of my limbs, it would be
solely by my own fault. I advanced my nobility and the state of my health as all-sufficient
reasons why the torture should not be applied to me, reminding them that for eleven years already
I had suffered persecution and detention, so that my vigour was all gone.

For the last time they summoned me to answer as the King desired. And then, since I still refused,
the executioner was recalled, he crossed my arms upon my breast, bound them securely, thrust
a long rod beneath the cord, and, seizing one end of this in either hand, gave the first turn.

I screamed. I could not help it, enfeebled as I was. But my spirit being stouter than my flesh,
I still refused to answer. Not indeed, until they had given the rope eight turns, not until
it had sliced through my muscles and crushed the bone of one of my arms, so that to this day
it remains of little use to me, did they conquer me. I had reached the limit of endurance.

"In Christ's name, release me!" I gasped. "I will say anything you wish."

Released at last, half swooning, smothered in blood, agonized by pain, I confessed that it
was myself had procured the death of Escovedo for reasons of State and acting upon the orders
of the King. The notary made haste to write down my words, and, when I had done, it was demanded
of me that I should advance proof of the State reasons which I had alleged.

Oh, I had never been under any delusion on that score, as I have shown you. The demand did
not take me by surprise at all. I was waiting for it, knowing that my answer to it would pronounce
my doom. But I delivered it none the less.

"My papers have been taken from me, and without them I can prove nothing. With them I could
prove my words abundantly."

They left me then. On the morrow, as I afterwards learnt, they read my confession to my devoted
Martinez, and the poor fellow, who hitherto had remained staunch and silent under every test,
seeing that there was no further purpose to be served by silence, gave them the confirmation
they desired of Enriquez's accusation.

Meanwhile, I was very ill, in a raging fever as you may well conceive, and in answer to my
prayer my own doctor was permitted to visit me in prison. He announced that he found my case
extremely grave, and that I must perish unless I were relieved. As a consequence, and considering
my weakness and the uselessness just then of both my arms, one of which was broken, first a
page of my own, then other servants, and lastly my wife were allowed to come and tend me.

That was at the end of February. By the middle of April my wounds had healed, I had recovered
the use of my limbs, though one remains half maimed for life, and my condition had undergone
a very considerable improvement. But of this I allowed no sign to show, no suspicion even.
I continued to lie there day after day in a state of complete collapse, so that whilst I was
quickly gathering strength it was believed by my gaolers that I was steadily sinking, and that
I should soon be dead.

My only hope, you see, lay now in evasion, and it was for this that I was thus craftily preparing.
Once out of Castile I could deal with Philip, and he should not find me as impotent, as toothless
as he believed. But I go too fast.

One night at last, on April 20th, by when all measures had been concerted, and Gil de Mesa
awaited me outside with horses--the whole having been contrived by my dear wife--I made the
attempt. My apparent condition had naturally led to carelessness in guarding me. Who would
guard a helpless, dying man? Soon after dark I rose, donned over my own clothes a petticoat
and a hooded cloak belonging to my wife, and thus muffed walked out of my cell, past the guards,
and so out of the prison unchallenged. I joined Gil de Mesa, discarded my feminine disguise,
mounted and set out with him upon that ninety-mile journey into Aragon.

We reached Saragossa in safety, and there my first act was to surrender myself to the Grand
Justiciary of Aragon to stand my trial for the murder of Escovedo with which I was charged.

It must have sent a shudder through the wicked Philip when he received news of that. A very
stricken man he must have been, for he must have suspected something of the truth, that if
I dared, after all the evidence amassed now against me, including my own confession under torture,
openly to seek a judgment, it was because I must possess some unsuspected means of establishing
all the truth--the truth that must make his own name stink in the nostrils of the world. And
so it was. Have you supposed that Antonio Perez, who had spent his life in studying the underground
methods of burrowing statecraft, had allowed himself to be taken quite so easily in their snare?
Have you imagined that when I sent for Diego Martinez to come to me at Turruegano and instructed
him touching the surrender of those two chests of documents, that I did not also instruct him
carefully touching the abstraction in the first instance of a few serviceable papers and the
renewal of the seals that should conceal the fact that he had tampered with the chests? If
you have thought that, you have done me less than justice. There had been so much correspondence
between Philip and myself, so many notes had passed touching the death of Escovedo, and there
was that habit of Philip's of writing his replies in marginal notes to my own letters and so
returning them, that it was unthinkable he should have kept them all in his memory, and the
abstraction of three or four could not conceivably be detected by him.

Ever since then those few letters, of a most deeply incriminating character, selected with
great acumen by my steward, had secretly remained in the possession of my wife. Yet I had not
dared produce them in Castile, knowing that I should instantly have been deprived of them,
and with them of my last hope. They remained concealed against precisely such a time as this,
when, beyond the immediate reach of Philip's justice, I should startle the world and clear
my own character by their production.

You know the ancient privileges enjoyed by Aragon, privileges of which the Aragonese are so
jealous that a King of Castile may not assume the title of King of Aragon until, bareheaded,
he shall have received from the Grand Justiciary of Aragon the following admonition: "We, who
are of equal worth and greater power than you, constitute you our king on the condition that
you respect our privileges, and not otherwise." And to that the king must solemnly bind himself
by oath, whose violation would raise in revolt against him the very cobbles of the streets.
No king of Spain had ever yet been found to dare violate the constitution and the fueros of
Aragon, the independence of their cortes, or parliament, composed of the four orders of the
State. The Grand Justiciary's Court was superior to any royally constituted tribunal in the
kingdom; to that court it was the privilege of any man to appeal for justice in any cause;
and there justice was measured out with a stern impartiality that had not its like in any other
State of Europe.

That was the tribunal to which I made surrender of my person and my cause. There was an attempt
on the part of Philip to seize me and drag me back to Castile and his vengeance. His officers
broke into the prison for that purpose, and already I was in their power, when the men of the
Justiciary, followed by an excited mob, which threatened open rebellion at this violation of
their ancient rights, delivered me from their hands.

Baffled in this--and I can imagine his fury, which has since been vented on the Aragonese--Philip
sent his representatives and his jurists to accuse me before the Court of the Grand Justiciary
and to conduct my prosecution.

The trial began, exciting the most profound interest, not only in Aragon, but also in Castile,
which, as I afterwards learnt, had openly rejoiced at my escape. It proceeded with the delays
and longueurs that are inseparable from the sluggish majesty of the law. One of these pauses
I wrote to Philip, inviting him to desist, and to grant me the liberty to live out my days
in peace with my family in some remote corner of his kingdom. I warned him that I was not helpless
before his persecution, as he imagined; that whilst I had made surrender of two chests of papers,
I yet retained enough authentic documents--letters in his own hand--to make my innocence and
his guilt apparent in a startling degree, with very evil consequences to himself.

His answer was to seize my wife and children and cast them into prison, and then order the
courts of Madrid to pronounce sentence of death against me for the murder of Escovedo. Such
were the sops with which he sought to quench his vindictive rage.

Thereupon the trial proceeded. I prepared my long memorial of the affair, supporting it with
proofs in the shape of those letters I had retained. And then at last Philip of Spain took
fright. He was warned by one of his representatives that there was little doubt I should be
acquitted on all counts, and, too late, he sought to save his face by ordering the cessation
of the prosecution he had instructed.

He stated that since I had chosen a line of defence, to answer which--as it could be answered--it
would be necessary to touch upon matters of a secrecy that was inviolable, and to introduce
personages whose reputation and honour was of more consequence to the State than the condemnation
of Antonio Perez, he preferred to renounce the prosecution before the tribunal of Aragon. But
he added a certificate upon his royal word to the effect that my crimes were greater than had
ever been the crimes of any man, and that, whilst he renounced the prosecution before the courts
of Aragon, he retained the right to demand of me an account of my actions before any other
tribunal at any future time.

My acquittal followed immediately. And immediately again that was succeeded by fresh charges
against me on behalf of the King. First it was sought to prove that I had procured the death
of two of my servants--a charge which I easily dispersed by proving them to have died natural
deaths. Then it was sought to prosecute me on the charge of corruption, for which I had once
already been prosecuted, condemned, and punished. Confidently I demanded my release, and Philip
must have ground his teeth in rage to see his prey escaping him, to see himself the butt of
scorn and contempt for the wrongs that it became clear he had done me.

One weapon remained to him, and a terrible weapon this--the Holy Office of the Inquisition,
a court before which all temporal courts must bow and quail. He launched its power against
me, and behold me, in the moment when I accounted myself the victor in the unequal contest,
accused of the dread sin of heresy. Words lightly weighed--uttered by me in prison under stress--had
been zealously gathered up y spies.

On one occasion I had exclaimed: "I think God sleeps where my affairs are concerned, and I
am in danger of losing my faith." The Holy Office held this to be a scandalous proposition,
offensive to pious ears.

Again, when I heard of the arrest of my wife and children I had cried out in rage: "God sleeps!
God sleeps! There cannot be a God!"

This they argued at length to be rank heresy, since it is man's duty positively to believe,
and who does not believe is an infidel.

Yet again it seems I had exclaimed: "Should things so come to pass, I shall refuse to believe
in God!" This was accounted blasphemous, scandalous, and not without suspicion of heresy.

Upon these grounds the Supreme Council of the Inquisition at Madrid drew up its impeachment,
and delivered it to the inquisitors of Aragon at Saragossa. These at once sent their familiars
to demand the surrender of me from the Grand Justiciary, in whose hands I still remained. The
Grand Justiciary incontinently refused to yield me up.

Thereupon the three Inquisitors drew up a peremptory demand, addressed to the lieutenants of
the Justiciary, summoning them by virtue of holy obedience, under pain of greater excommunication,
of a fine in the case of each of them of one thousand ducats, and other penalties to which
they might later be condemned, to deliver me up within three hours to the pursuivants of the
Holy Office.

This was the end of the Justiciary's resistance. He dared not refuse a demand so framed, and
surrender of me was duly made. But the news of what was doing had run abroad. I had no lack
of friends, whom I instantly warned of what was afoot, and they had seen to it that the knowledge
spread in an inflammatory manner. Saragossa began to stir at once. Here was a thinly masked
violation of their ancient privileges. If they suffered this precedent of circumventing their
rights, what was to become of their liberties in future, who would be secure against an unjust
persecution? For their sympathies were all with me throughout that trial.

I was scarcely in the prison of the Holy Office before the dread cry of Contrafueros! was ringing
through the streets of Saragossa, summoning the citizens to arm and come forth in defence of
their inviolable rights. They stormed the palace of the Grand Justiciary, demanded that he
should defend the fueros, to whose guardianship he had been elected. Receiving no satisfaction,
they attacked the palace of the Inquisition, clamouring insistently that I should immediately
be returned to the Justiciary's prison, whence I had so unwarrantably been taken.

The Inquisitors remained firm a while, but the danger was increasing hourly. In the end they
submitted, for the sake of their skins, and considering, no doubt, a later vengeance for this
outrage upon their holy authority. But it was not done until faggots had been stacked against
the Holy House, and the exasperated mob had threatened to burn them out of it.

"Castilian hypocrites!" had been the insurgent roar. "Surrender your prisoner, or you shall
be roasted in the fire in which you roast so many!"

Blood was shed in the streets. The King's representative died of wounds that he received in
the affray, whilst the Viceroy himself was assailed and compelled to intervene and procure
my deliverance.

For the moment I was out of danger. But for the moment only. There was no question now of my
enlargement. The Grand Justiciary, intimidated by what had taken place, by the precise expression
of the King's will, dared not set me at liberty. And then the Holy Office, under the direction
of the King, went to work in that subterranean way which it has made its own; legal quibbles
were raised to soothe the sensibilities of the Aragonese with respect to my removal from the
Justiciary's prison to that of the Holy Office. Strong forces of troops were brought to Saragossa
to overawe the plebeian insolence, and so, by the following September, all the preliminaries
being concluded, the Inquisition came in force and in form to take possession of me.

The mob looked on and murmured; but it was intimidated by the show of ordered force; it had
perhaps tired a little of the whole affair, and did not see that it should shed its blood and
lay up trouble for itself for the sake of one who, after all, was of no account in the affairs
of Aragon. I stood upon the threshold of my ruin. All my activities were to go unrewarded.
Doom awaited me. And then the unexpected happened. The alguazil of the Holy Office was in the
very act of setting the gyves upon my legs when the first shot was fired, followed almost at
once by a fusillade.

It was Gil de Mesa, faithfullest servant that ever any man possessed. He had raised an armed
band, consisting of some Aragonese gentlemen and their servants, and with this he fell like
a thunderbolt upon the Castilian men-at-arms and the familiars of the Inquisition. The alguazil
fled, leaving me one leg free, the other burdened by the gyve, and as he fled so fled all others,
being thus taken unawares. The Inquisitors scuttled to the nearest shelter; the Viceroy threw
himself into his house and barricaded the door. There was no one to guide, no one to direct.
The soldiery in these circumstances, and accounting themselves overpowered, offered no resistance.
They, too, fled before the fusillade and the hail of shot that descended on them.

Before I realized what had happened, the iron had been struck from my leg, I was mounted on
a horse, and, with Gil at my side, I was galloping out of Saragossa by the gate of Santa Engracia,
and breasting the slopes with little cause to fear pursuit just yet, such was the disorder
we had left behind.

And there, very briefly, you have the story of my sufferings and my escapes. Not entirely to
be baulked, numerous arrests were made by the Inquisitors in Saragossa when order was at last
restored. There followed an auto-da-fe, the most horrible and vindictive of all those horrors,
in which many suffered for having displayed the weakness of charity towards a persecuted man.
And, since my body was no longer in their clutches, they none the less sentenced me to death
as contumaciously absent, and my effigy was burnt in the holy fires they lighted, amongst the
human candles which they offered up for the greater honour and glory of a merciful God. Let
me say no more, lest I blaspheme in earnest.

After months of wandering and hiding, Gil and I made our way here into Navarre, where we remain
the guests of Protestant King Henri IV, who does not love King Philip any better since he has
heard my story.

Still King Philip's vengeance does not sleep. Twice has he sent after me his assassins--since
assassination is the only weapon now remaining to him. But his poor tools have each time been
taken, exposed to Philip's greater infamy and shame--and hanged as they deserve who can so
vilely serve so vile a master. It has even been sought to bribe my faithful Gil de Mesa into
turning his hand against me, and that attempt, too, has been given the fullest publication.
Meanwhile, my death to-day could no longer avail Philip very much. My memorial is published
throughout Europe for all to read. It has been avidly read until Philip of Spain has earned
the contempt of every upright man. In his own dominions the voice of execration has been raised
against him. One of his own nobles has contemptuously announced that Spain under Philip has
become unsafe for any gentleman, and that a betrayal of a subject by his king is without parallel
in history.

That is some measure of vengeance. But if I am spared I shall not leave it there. Henry of
Navarre is on the point of turning Catholic that his interests may be better served. Elizabeth
of England remains. In her dominions, where thrives the righteous hatred of Philip and all
the evil that he stands for, I shall find a welcome and a channel for the activities that are
to show him that Antonio Perez lives. I have sent him word that when he is weary of the conflict
he can signify his surrender by delivering from their prison my wife and children, upon whom
he seeks still to visit some of the vengeance I have succeeded in eluding. When he does that,
then will I hold my hand. But not before.

"That, madame, is my story," said Don Antonio, after a pause, and from narrowing eyes looked
at the beauty who had heard him through.

Daylight had faded whilst the tale was telling. Night was come, and lights had long since been
fetched, the curtains drawn over the long windows that looked out across the parkland to the river.

Twice only had he paused in all that narrative. Once when he had described the avowal of his
love for Anne, Princess of Eboli, when a burst of sobs from her had come to interrupt him;
again when a curious bird-note had rung out upon the gathering dusk. Then he stopped to listen.

"Curious that," he had said--"an eagle's cry. I have not heard it these many months, not since
I left the hills of Aragon."

Thereafter he had continued to the end.

Considering her now, his glance inscrutable, he said:

"You weep, madame. Tell me, what is it that has moved you--the contemplation of my sufferings,
or of your own duplicity?"

She started up, very white, her eyes scared.

"I do not understand you. What do you mean, sir?"

"I mean, madame, that God did not give you so much beauty that you should use it in the decoying
of an unfortunate, that you should hire it at an assassin's fee to serve the crapulous King
of Spain."

He rose and towered before her, a figure at once of anger, dignity, and some compassion.

"So much ardour from youth and beauty to age and infirmity was in itself suspicious. The Catholic
King has the guile of Satan, I remembered. I wondered, and hoped my suspicions might be unfounded.
Yet prudence made me test them, that the danger, if it existed, should manifest itself and
be destroyed. So I came to tell you all my story, so that if you did the thing I feared, you
might come to the knowledge of precisely what it was you did. I have learnt whilst here that
what I suspected is--alas! quite true. You were a lure, a decoy sent to work my ruin, to draw
me into a trap where daggers waited for me. Why did you do this? What was the bribe that could
corrupt you, lovely lady?"

Sobs shook her. Her will gave way before his melancholy sternness.

"I do not know by what wizardry you have discovered it!" she cried. "It was true; but it is
true no longer. I knew not what I did. By that window, across the meadows, you can reach the
river in safety." She rose, controlling her emotion that she might instruct him. "They wait
for you in the enclosed garden."

He smiled wistfully.

"They waited, madame. They wait no longer, unless it be for death. That eagle's cry, thrice
repeated, was the signal from my faithful Gil, not only that the trap was discovered, but that
those who baited it were taken. Suspecting what I did, I took my measures ere I came. Antonio
Perez, as I have told you, is not an easy man to murder. Unlike Philip, I do not make war on
women, and I have no reckoning to present to you. But I am curious, madame, to know what led
you to this baseness."

"I--I thought you evil, and--and they bribed me. I was offered ten thousand ducats for your
head. We are very poor, we Chantenacs, and so I fell. But, sir--sir"--she was on her knees
to him now, and she had caught his hand in hers--"poor as I am, all that I have is yours to
do with as you will, to help to avenge yourself upon that Spanish monster. Take what you will.
Take all I have."

His smile grew gentler. Gently he raised her.

"Madame," he said, "I am myself a sinner, as I have shown you, a man unequal to resisting temptation
when it took me in its trammels. Of all that you offer, I will take only the right to this kiss."

And bending, he bore her hand to his lips.

Then he went out to join Gil and his men, who waited in the courtyard, guarding three prisoners
they had taken.

Perez considered them by the light of the lantern that Gil held aloft for him.

"One of you," he announced, "shall return to Castile and give tidings to Philip, his master,
that Antonio Perez leaves for England and the Court of Elizabeth, to aid her, by his knowledge
of the affairs of Spain, in her measures against the Catholic King, and to continue his holy
work, which is to make the name of Philip II stink in the nostrils of all honest men. One of
you I will spare for that purpose. You shall draw lots for it in the morning. The other two
must hang."

IV. THE NIGHT OF CHARITY--The Case Of The Lady Alice Lisle

Of all the cases tried in the course of that terrible circuit, justly known as the Bloody Assizes,
the only one that survives at all in the popular memory is the case of the Lady Alice Lisle.
Her advanced age, the fact that she was the first woman known in English history to have suffered
death for no worse an offence than that of having exercised the feminine prerogative of mercy,
and the further fact that, even so, this offence--technical as it was--was never fully proved
against her, are all circumstances which have left their indelible stamp of horror upon the
public mind. There is also the further circumstance that hers was the first case tried in the
West by that terrible Chief Justice, Baron Jeffreys of Wem.

But the feature that renders her case peculiarly interesting to the historical psychologist--and
it is a feature that is in danger of being overlooked--is that she cannot really be said to
have suffered for the technical offence for which she took her trial. That was the pretext
rather than the cause. In reality she was the innocent victim of a relentless, undiscerning
Nemesis.

The battle of Sedgemoor had been fought and lost by the Protestant champion, James, Duke of
Monmouth. In the West, which had answered the Duke's summons to revolt, there was established
now a horrible reign of terror reflecting the bigoted, pitiless, vindictive nature of the King.
Faversham had left Colonel Percy Kirke in command at Bridgwater, a ruthless ruffian, who at
one time had commanded the Tangier garrison, and whose men were full worthy of their commander.
Kirke's Lambs they were called, in an irony provoked by the emblem of the Paschal Lamb on the
flag of this, the First Tangier Regiment, originally levied to wage war upon the infidel.

From Bridgwater Colonel Kirke made a horrible punitive progress to Taunton, where he put up
at the White Hart Inn. Now, there was a very solid signpost standing upon a triangular patch
of green before the door of the White Hart, and Colonel Kirke conceived the quite facetious
notion of converting this advertisement of hospitality into a gallows--a signpost of temporal
welfare into a signpost of eternity. So forth he fetched the prisoners he had brought in chains
from Bridgwater, and proceeded, without any form of trial whatsoever, to string them up before
the inn. The story runs that as they were hoisted to that improvised gibbet, Kirke and his
officers, standing at the windows, raised their glasses to pledge their happy deliverance;
then, when the victims began to kick convulsively, Kirke would order the drums to strike up,
so that the gentlemen might have music for their better dancing.

The colonel, you see, was a humorist, as humour was then understood upon the northern shores
of Africa, where he had been schooled.

When, eventually, Colonel Kirke was recalled and reprimanded, it was not because of his barbarities
many of which transcend the possibilities of decent print--but because of a lenity which this
venal gentleman began to display when he discovered that many of his victims were willing to
pay handsomely for mercy.

Meanwhile, under his reign of terror, men who had cause to fear the terrible hand of the King's
vengeance went into hiding wherever they could. Among those who escaped into Hampshire, thinking
themselves safer in a county that had not participated in the war, were a dissenting parson
named George Hicks, who had been in Monmouth's army, and a lawyer named Richard Nelthorp, outlawed
for participation in the Rye House Plot. In his desperate quest for shelter, Hicks bethought
him of the charitable Nonconformist lady of Moyle's Court, the widow of that John Lisle who
had been one of Cromwell's Lords Commissioners of the Great Seal, and most active in bringing
King Charles I to justice.

John Lisle had fled to Switzerland at the Restoration; but Stuart vengeance had followed him,
set a price upon his head, and procured his murder at Lausanne. That was twenty years ago.
Since then his lady, because she was known to have befriended and sheltered many Royalists,
and because she had some stout Tory friends to plead for her, was allowed to remain in tranquil
possession of her estates. And there the Lady Alice Lisle--so called by courtesy, since Cromwell's
titles did not at law survive the Restoration--might have ended her days in peace, but that
it was written that those who hated her--innocent and aged though she was--for the name she
bore, who included her in the rancour which had procured her husband's assassination, were
to be fully satisfied. And the instrument of fate was this parson Hicks. He prevailed upon
Dunne, a baker of Warminster, and a Nonconformist, to convey to the Lady Lisle his prayer for
shelter. With that message Dunne set out on July 25th for Ellingham, a journey of some twenty
miles. He went by way of Fovant and Chalk to Salisbury Plain. But as he did not know the way
thence, he sought out a co-religionist named Barter, who undertook, for a consideration, to
go with him and direct him.

Together the pair came in the late afternoon of that Saturday to the handsome house of Moyle's
Court, and to my lady's steward, who received them. Dunne, who appears to have been silly and
imprudent, states that he is sent to know if my lady will entertain a minister named Hicks.

Carpenter, the steward, a staid, elderly fellow, took fright at once. Although he may not have
associated an absconding Presbyterian parson with the late rebellion, he must have supposed
at least that he was one of those against whom there were warrants for preaching in forbidden
private meetings. So to her ladyship above stairs Carpenter conveyed a warning with the message.

But that slight, frail, homely lady of seventy, with kindly eyes of a faded blue, smiled upon
his fears. She had sheltered fugitives before--in the old days of the Commonwealth--and nothing
but good had ever come of it. She would see this messenger.

With misgivings, Carpenter haled Dunne into her presence, and left them alone together. The
impression conveyed by Dunne was that Hicks was in hiding from the warrants that were out against
all Nonconformist preachers. But when he mentioned that Hicks had a companion, she desired
to know his name.

"I do not know, my lady. But I do not think he has been in the army, either."

She considered a while. But in the end pity conquered doubt in her sweetly charitable soul.

"Very well," she said, "I will give them entertainment for a week. Bring them on Tuesday after
dark, and come by the back way through the orchard, that they may not be seen."

And upon this she rose, and took up an ebony cane, herself to reconduct him and to see to his
entertainment before he left. Not until they came to the kitchen did she realize that he had
a companion. At sight of Barter, who rose respectfully when she entered, she checked, turned
to Dunne, and whispered something, to which his answer provoked from her a laugh.

Now Barter, intrigued by this whispering and laughing, of which he deemed himself the object,
questioned Dunne upon it as they rode forth again together.

"She asked me if you knew aught of the business," replied Dunne; "and I answered 'No."'

"Business, say'st thou?" quoth Barter. "What business?"

"Sure, the business on which we came," Dunne evaded; and he laughed.

It was an answer that left Barter uneasy. Nor was his mind set at rest by the parting words
with which Dunne accompanied the half-crown for his services.

"This is but an earnest of what's to come if you will meet me here on Tuesday to show me the
way to Moyle's Court again. I shall be bringing two gentlemen with me--wealthy men, of a half-score
thousand pounds a year apiece. I tell you there will be a fine booty for my part, so fine that
I shall never want for money again all the days of my life. And, so that you meet us here,
you too may count upon a handsome reward."

Consenting, Barter went his ways home. But as he pondered Dunne's silly speech, and marvelled
that honest men should pay so disproportionately for an honest service, he came to the reasonable
conclusion that he had to do with rebels. This made him so uneasy that he resolved at last
to lodge information with the nearest justice.

Now, it happened, by the irony of Fate, that the justice sought by Barter was one Colonel Penruddock--the
vindictive son of that Penruddock whom the late John Lisle--whilst Lord President of the High
Court--had sentenced to death some thirty years ago for participation in an unsuccessful Wiltshire
rising against the Commonwealth.

The colonel, a lean, stark man of forty-five, heard with interest Barter's story.

"Art an honest fellow!" he commended him. "What are the names of these rogues?"

"The fellow named no names, sir."

"Well, well, we shall discover that for ourselves when we come to take them at this trysting-place.
Whither do you say you are to conduct them?"

"To Moyle's Court, sir, where my Lady Lisle is to give them entertainment."

The colonel stared a moment; then a heavy smile came to light the saturnine face under the
heavy periwig. Beyond that he gave no sign of what was passing in his mind.

"You may go," he said slowly, at last. "Be sure we shall be at the tryst to take these rascals."

But the colonel did not keep his promise. To Barter's surprise, there were no soldiers at the
tryst on Salisbury Plain on the following Tuesday; and he was suffered to lead Dunne and the
two men with him the short, corpulent Mr. Hicks and the long, lean Nelthorp--to Moyle's Court
without interference.

The rich reward that Dunne had promised him amounted in actual fact to five shillings, that
he had from Nelthorpe at parting. Puzzled by Colonel Penruddock's failure to do his part, Barter
went off at once to the colonel's house to inform him that the pair were now at Lady Lisle's.

"Why, that is very well," said the colonel, his smile more sinister than ever. "Trouble not
yourself about that."

And Barter, the unreasoning instrument of Fate, was not to know that the apprehending of a
couple of traitorous Jack Presbyters was of small account to Colonel Penruddock by comparison
with the satisfaction of the blood-feud between himself and the House of Lisle.

Meanwhile the fugitives were being entertained at Moyle's Court, and whilst they sat at supper
in a room above-stairs, Dunne being still of the party, my lady came in person to see that
they had all that they required, and stayed a little while in talk with them. There was some
mention of Monmouth and the battle of Sedgemoor, which was natural, that being the topic of
the hour.

My lady asked no questions at the time regarding Hicks's long, lean companion. But it occurred
to her later that perhaps she should know more about him. Early next morning, therefore, she
sent for Hicks as he was in the act of sitting down to breakfast, and by her direct questions
elicited from him that this companion was that Richard Nelthorp outlawed for his share in the
Rye House Plot. Not only was the information alarming, but it gave her a sense that she had
not been dealt with fairly, as indeed she told him.

"You will see, sir," she concluded, "that you cannot bide here. So long as I thought it was
on the score of Nonconformity alone that you were suffering persecution, I was willing to take
some risk in hiding you. But since your friend is what he is, the risk is greater than I should
be asked to face, for my own sake and for that of my daughters. Nor can I say that I have ever
held plottings and civil war in anything but abhorrence--as much in the old days as now. I
am a loyal woman, and as a loyal woman I must bid you take your friend hence as soon as your
fast is broken."

The corpulent and swarthy Hicks stood dejectedly before her. He might have pleaded, but at
that moment there came a loud knocking at the gates below, and instantly Carpenter flung into
the room with a white, scared face and whirling gestures.

"Soldiers, my lady!" he panted in affright. "We have been betrayed. The presence of Mr. Hicks
here is known. What shall we do? What shall we do?"

She stood quite still, her countenance entirely unchanged, unless it were to smile a little
upon Carpenter's terror. The mercy of her nature rose dominant now.

"Why, we must hide these poor fellows as best we can," said she; and Hicks flung down upon
one knee to kiss her hand with protestations that he would sooner be hanged than bring trouble
upon her house.

But she insisted, calm and self-contained; and Carpenter carried Hicks away to bestow him,
together with Dunne, in a hole in the malt-house under a heap of sacking. Nelthorp had already
vanished completely on his own initiative.

Meanwhile, the insistent knocking at the gate continued. Came shouted demands to open in the
name of the King, until from a window my lady's daughters looked out to challenge those who
knocked.

Colonel Penruddock, who had come in person with the soldiers to raid the house of his hereditary
foe, stood forth to answer, very stiff and brave in his scarlet coat and black plumed hat.

"You have rebels in the house," he announced, "and I require you in the King's name to deliver
them up to me."

And then, before they could answer him, came Carpenter to, unbar the door, and admit them to
the court. Penruddock, standing squarely before the steward, admonished him very sternly.

"Friend," said he, "you had best be ingenuous with me and discover who are in your lady's house,
for it is within my knowledge that some strangers came hither last night."

The stricken Carpenter stood white-faced and trembling.

"Sir--sir--" he faltered.

But the colonel was impatient.

"Come, come, my friend. Since I know they are here, there's an end on't. Show me where they
are hid if you would save your own neck from the halter."

It was enough for Carpenter. The pair in the malthouse might have eluded all search but for
the steward's pusillanimity. Incontinently, he betrayed the hiding-place.

"But, sir, of your charity do not tell my mistress that I have told you. Pray, sir--"

Penruddock brushed him aside as if he had been a pestering fly, and with his men went in, and
straight to the spot where Hicks and Dunne were lurking. When he had taken them, he swung round
on Carpenter, who had followed.

"These be but two," he said, "and to my knowledge three rogues came hither last night. No shufling
with me, rascal. Where have you bestowed the other?"

"I swear, as Heaven's my witness, I do not know where he is," protested the afflicted steward,
truly enough.

Penruddock turned to his men.

"Make search," he bade them; and search was made in the ruthless manner of such searches.

The brutal soldiers passed from room to room beating the wainscoting with pike and musket-butts,
splintering and smashing heedlessly. Presses were burst open and their contents scattered;
chests were broken into and emptied, the searchers appropriating such objects as took their
fancy, with true military cynicism. A mirror was shattered, and some boards of the floor were
torn up because a sergeant conceived that the blows of his halbert rang hollow.

When the tumult was at its height, came her ladyship at last into the room, where Colonel Penruddock
stood watching the operations of his men. She stood in the doorway leaning upon her ebony cane,
her faded eyes considering the gaunt soldier with reproachful question.

"Sir," she asked him with gentle irony, masking her agitation, "has my house been given over
to pillage?"

He bowed, doffing his plumed hat with an almost excessive courtesy.

"To search, madame," he corrected her. And added: "In the King's name."

"The King," she answered, "may give you authority to search my house, but not to plunder it.
Your men are robbing and destroying."

He shrugged. It was the way of soldiers. Fine manners, he suggested, were not to be expected
of their kind. And he harangued her upon the wrong she had done in harbouring rebels and giving
entertainment to the King's enemies.

"That is not true," said she. "I know of no King's enemies."

He smiled darkly upon her from his great height. She was so frail a body and so old that surely
it was not worth a man's while to sacrifice her on the altar of revenge. But not so thought
Colonel Penruddock. Therefore he smiled.

"Two of them, a snivelling Jack Presbyter named Hicks and a rascal named Dunne, are taken already.
Pray, madame, be so free and ingenuous with me aye, and so kind to yourself--as if there be
any other person concealed in your house--and I am sure there is somebody else--to deliver
him up, and you shall come to no further trouble."

She looked up at him, and returned him smile for smile.

"I know nothing," she said, "of what you tell me, or of what you ask."

His countenance hardened.

"Then, mistress, the search must go on."

But a shout from the adjoining room announced that it was at an end. Nelthorp had been discovered
and dragged from the chimney into which he had crept.

Almost exactly a month later--on August 27th the Lady Alice Lisle was brought to the bar of
the court-house at Winchester upon a charge of high treason.

The indictment ran that secretly, wickedly, and traitorously she did entertain, conceal, comfort,
uphold, and maintain John Hicks, knowing him to be a false traitor, against the duty of her
allegiance and against the peace of "our sovereign lord the King that now is."

Demurely dressed in grey, the little white-haired lady calmly faced the Lord Chief Justice
Jeffreys and the four judges of oyer and terminer who sat with him, and confidently made her
plea of "Not Guilty."

It was inconceivable that Christian men should deal harshly with her for a technical offence
amounting to an act of Christian charity. And the judge, sitting there in his robe of scarlet
reversed with ermine, looked a gentle, kindly man; his handsome, oval, youthful face--Jeffreys
was in his thirty-sixth year--set in the heavy black periwig, was so pale that the mouth made
a vivid line of scarlet; and the eyes that now surveyed her were large and liquid and compassionate,
as it seemed to her.

She was not to know that the pallor which gave him so interesting an air, and the dark stains
which lent his eyes that gentle wistfulness, were the advertisements at once of the debauch
that had kept him from his bed until after two o'clock that morning and of the inexorable disease
that slowly gnawed away his life and enraged him out of all humanity.

And the confidence his gentle countenance inspired was confirmed by the first words he had
occasion to address to her. She had interrupted counsel to the Crown when, in his opening address
to the jury--composed of some of the most considerable gentlemen of Hampshire--he seemed to
imply that she had been in sympathy with Monmouth's cause. She was, of course, without counsel,
and must look herself to her defence.

"My lord," she cried, "I abhorred that rebellion as much as any woman in the world!"

Jeffreys leaned forward with a restraining gesture.

"Look you, Mrs. Lisle," he admonished her sweetly, "because we must observe the common and
usual methods of trial in your case I must interrupt you now." And upon that he promised that
she should be fully heard in her own defence at the proper time, and that himself he would
instruct her in the forms of law to her advantage. He reassured her by reverent allusions to
the great Judge of Heaven and Earth, in whose sight they stood, that she should have justice.
"And as to what you say concerning yourself," he concluded, "I pray God with all my heart you
may be innocent."

He was benign and reassuring. But she had the first taste of his true quality in the examination
of Dunne--a most unwilling witness.

Reluctantly, under the pressure put upon him, did Dunne yield up the tale of how he had conducted
the two absconders to my lady's house with her consent, and it was sought to prove that she
was aware of their connection with the rebellion. The stubbornly evasive Dunne was asked at last:

"Do you believe that she knew Mr. Hicks before?"

He returned the answer that already he had returned to many questions of the sort.

"I cannot tell truly."

Jeffreys stirred in his scarlet robes, and his wistful eyes grew terrible as they bent from
under beetling brows upon the witness.

"Why," he asked, "dost thou think that she would entertain any one she had no knowledge of
merely upon thy message? Mr. Dunne, Mr. Dunne! Have a care. It may be more is known to me of
this matter than you think for."

"My lord, I speak nothing but the truth!" bleated the terrified Dunne.

"I only bid you have a care," Jeffreys smiled; and his smile was more terrible than his frown.
"Truth never wants a subterfuge; it always loves to appear naked; it needs no enamel nor any
covering. But lying and snivelling and canting and Hicksing always appear in masquerade. Come,
go on with your evidence."

But Dunne was reluctant to go on, and out of his reluctance he lied foolishly, and pretended
that both Hicks and Nelthorp were unknown to him. When pressed to say why he should have served
two men whom he had never seen before, he answered:

"All the reason that induced me to it was that they said they were men in debt, and desired
to be concealed for a while."

Then the thunder was heard in Jeffreys' voice.

"Dost thou believe that any one here believes thee? Prithee, what trade art thou?"

"My lord," stammered the unfortunate, "I--I am a baker by trade."

"And wilt thou bake thy bread at such easy rates? Upon my word, then, thou art very kind. Prithee,
tell me. I believe thou dost use to bake on Sundays, dost thou not?"

"No, my lord, I do not!" cried Dunne indignantly.

"Alackaday! Art precise in that," sneered the judge. "But thou canst travel on Sundays to lead
rogues into lurking-holes."

Later, when to implicate the prisoner, it was sought to draw from Dunne a full account of the
reception she had given his companions, his terror under the bullying to which he was subjected
made him contradict himself more flagrantly than ever. Jeffreys addressed the jury.

"You see, gentlemen, what a precious fellow this is; a very pretty tool to be employed upon
such an errand; a knave that nobody would trust for half a crown. A Turk has more title to
an eternity of bliss than these pretenders to Christianity."

And as there was no more to be got from Dunne just then, he was presently dismissed, and Barter's
damning evidence was taken. Thereafter the wretched Dunne was recalled, to be bullied by Jeffreys
in blasphemous terms that may not be printed here.

Barter had told the Court how my lady had come into the kitchen with Dunne, and how, when he
had afterwards questioned Dunne as to why they had whispered and laughed together, Dunne told
him she had asked "If he knew aught of the business." Jeffreys sought now to wring from Dunne
what was this business to which he had so mysteriously alluded--this with the object of establishing
Lady Lisle's knowledge of Hicks's treason.

Dunne resisted more stubbornly than ever. Jeffreys, exasperated--since without the admission
it would be difficult to convict her ladyship--invited the jury to take notice of the strange,
horrible carriage of the fellow, and heaped abuse upon the snivelling, canting sect of which
he was a member. Finally, he reminded Dunne of his oath to tell the truth, and addressed him
with a sort of loving ferocity.

"What shall it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul?" bellowed that terrible
judge, his eyes aflame. "Is not this the voice of Scripture itself? And wilt thou hazard so
dear and precious a thing as thy soul for a lie? Thou wretch! All the mountains and hills of
the world heaped upon one another will not cover thee from the vengeance of the Great God for
this transgression of false-witness bearing."

"I cannot tell what to say, my lord," gasped Dunne.

In his rage to see all efforts vain, the judge's language became that of the cockpit. Recovering
at last, he tried gentleness again, and very elaborately invited Dunne, in my lady's own interest,
to tell him what was the business to which he had referred to Barter.

"She asked me whether I did not know that Hicks was a Nonconformist."

"That cannot be all. There must be something more in it."

"Yes, my lord," Dunne protested, "it is all. I know nothing more."

"Was there ever such an impudent rascal?" roared the judge. "Dolt think that, after all the
pains I have been at to get an answer, thou canst banter me with such sham stuff as this? Hold
the candle to his brazen face, that we may see it clearly."

Dunne stood terrified and trembling under the glance of those terrible eyes.

"My lord," he cried, "I am so baulked, I am cluttered out of my senses."

Again he was put down whilst Colonel Penruddock gave his evidence of the apprehension of the
rebels. When he had told how he found Hicks and Dunne concealed under some stuff in the malt-house,
Dunne was brought back yet again, that Jeffreys might resume his cross-examination.

"Dunne, how came you to hide yourself in the malthouse?"

"My lord," said Dunne foolishly, "I was frighted by the noise."

"Prithee, what needest thou be afraid of, for thou didst not know Hicks nor Nelthorp; and my
lady only asked thee whether Hicks were a Nonconformist parson. Surely, so very innocent a
soul needed no occasion to be afraid. I doubt there was something in the case of that business
we were talking of before. If we could but get out of thee what it was."

But Dunne continued to evade.

"My lord, I heard a great noise in the house, and did not know what it meant. So I went and
hid myself."

"It is very strange thou shouldst hide thyself for a little noise, when thou knewest nothing
of the business."

Again the witness, with a candle still held close to his nose, complained that he was quite
cluttered out of his senses, and did not know what he was saying.

"But to tell the truth would not rob thee of any of thy senses, if ever thou hadst any," Jeffreys
told him angrily. "But it would seem that neither thou nor thy mistress, the prisoner, had
any; for she knew nothing of it either, though she had sent for them thither."

"My lord," cried her ladyship at that, "I hope I shall not be condemned without being heard."

"No, God forbid, Mrs. Lisle," he answered; and then viciously flashed forth a hint of the true
forces of Nemesis at work against her. "That was a sort of practice in your late husband's
time--you know very well what I mean--but God be thanked it is not so now."

Came next the reluctant evidence of Carpenter and his wife, and after that there was yet a
fourth equally futile attempt to drag from Dunne an admission that her ladyship was acquainted
with Hicks's share in the rebellion. But if stupid, Dunne at least was staunch, and so, with
a wealth of valedictory invective, Jeffreys dismissed him, and addressed at last the prisoner,
inviting her to speak in her own defence.

She rose to do so, fearlessly yet gently.

"My lord, what I have to say is this. I knew of nobody's coming to my house but Mr. Hicks,
and for him I was informed that he did abscond by reason of warrants that were out against
him for preaching in private meetings; for that reason I sent to him to come by night. But
I had never heard that Nelthorp was to come with him, nor what name Nelthorp had till after
he had come to my house. I could die upon it. As for Mr. Hicks, I did not in the least suspect
that he had been in the army, being a Presbyterian minister that used to preach and not to fight."

"But I will tell you," Jeffreys interrupted her, "that there is not one of those lying, snivelling,
canting Presbyterian rascals but one way or the other had a hand in the late horrid conspiracy
and rebellion."

"My lord, I abhorred both the principles and the practices of the late rebellion," she protested;
adding that if she had been tried in London, my Lady Abergavenny and many other persons of
quality could have testified with what detestation she had spoken of the rebellion, and that
she had been in London until Monmouth had been beheaded.

"If I had known the time of my trial in the country," she pursued, "I could have had the testimony
of those persons of honour for me. But, my lord, I have been told, and so I thought it would
have been, that I should not have been tried for harbouring Mr. Hicks until he should himself
be convict as a traitor. I did abhor those that were in the plot and conspiracy against the
King. I know my duty to my King better, and have always exercised it. I defy anybody in the
world that ever knew contrary to come and give testimony."

His voice broke harshly upon the pause. "Have you any more to say?"

"As to what they say to my denying Nelthorp to be in the house," she resumed. "I was in very
great consternation and fear of the soldiers, who were very rude and violent. I beseech your
lordship to make that construction of it, and not harbour an ill opinion of me because of those
false reports that go about of me, relating to my carriage towards the old King, that I was
anyways consenting to the death of King Charles I; for, my lord, that is as false as God is
true. I was not out of my chamber all the day in which that king was beheaded, and I believe
I shed more tears for him than any other woman then living.

"And I do repeat it, my lord, as I hope to attain salvation, I never did know Nelthorp, nor
did I know of anybody's coming but Mr. Hicks. Him I knew to be a Nonconformist minister, and
there being, as is well known, warrants out to apprehend all Nonconformist ministers, I was
willing to give him shelter from these warrants, which I knew was no treason."

"Have you any more to say for yourself?" he asked her.

"My lord," she was beginning, "I came but five days before this into the country."

"Nay," he broke in, "I cannot tell when you came into the country, nor I don't care. It seems
you came in time to harbour rebels."

She protested that if she would have ventured her life for anything, it would have been to
serve the King.

"But, though I could not fight for him myself, my son did; he was actually in arms on the King's
side in this business. It was I that bred him in loyalty and to fight for the King."

"Well, have you done?" he asked her brutally.

"Yes, my lord," she answered; and resumed her seat, trembling a little from the exertion and
emotion of her address.

His charge to the jury began. It was very long, and the first half of it was taken up with
windy rhetoric in which the Almighty was invoked at every turn. It degenerated at one time
into a sermon upon the text of "render unto Caesar," inveighing against the Presbyterian religion.
And the dull length of his lordship's periods, combined with the monotone in which he spoke,
lulled the wearied lady at the bar into slumber. She awakened with a start when suddenly his
fist crashed down and his voice rose in fierce denunciation of the late rebellion. But she
was dozing again--so calm and so little moved was she--before he had come to apply his denunciations
to her own case, and this in spite of all her protests that she had held the rebellion in abhorrence.

It was all calculated to prejudice the minds of the jurymen before he came to the facts and
the law of the case. And that charge of his throughout, far from being a judicial summing-up,
was a virulent address for the prosecution, just as his bearing hitherto in examining and cross-examining
witnesses had been that of counsel for the Crown. The statement that she had made in her own
defence he utterly ignored, save in one particular, where he saw his opportunity further to
prejudice her case.

"I am sorry," he said, his face lengthening, "to remember something that dropped even from
the gentlewoman herself. She pretends to religion and loyalty very much--how greatly she wept
at the death of King Charles the Martyr--and owns her great obligations to the late king and
his royal brother. And yet no sooner is one in the grave than she forgets all gratitude and
entertains those that were rebels against his royal successor.

"I will not say," he continued with deliberate emphasis, "what hand her husband had in the
death of that blessed martyr; she has enough to answer for her own guilt; and I must confess
that it ought not, one way or other, to make any ingredient into this case what she was in
former times."

But he had dragged it in, protesting that it should not influence the case, yet coldly, calculatingly
intending it to do so. She was the widow of a regicide, reason and to spare in the views of
himself and his royal master why she should be hounded to her death upon any pretext.

Thereafter he reviewed the evidence against her, dwelt upon the shuffling of Dunne, deduced
that the reason for so much lying was to conceal the damning truth--namely, that she knew Hicks
for a rebel when she gave him shelter, and thus became the partner of his horrible guilt. Upon
that he charged them to find their verdict "without any consideration of persons, but considering
only the truth."

Nevertheless, although his commands were clear, some of the jury would seem to have feared
the God whom Jeffreys invoked so constantly. One of them rose to ask him pertinently, in point
of law, whether it was treason to have harboured Hicks before the man had been convicted of
treason.

Curtly he answered them that beyond doubt it was, and upon that assurance the jury withdrew,
the Court settled down into an expectant silence, and her ladyship dozed again in her chair.

The minutes passed. It was growing late, and Jeffreys was eager to be done with this prejudged
affair, that he might dine in peace. His voice broke the stillness of the court, protesting
his angry wonder at the need to deliberate in so plain a case. He was threatening to adjourn
and let the jury lie by all night if they did not bring in their verdict quickly. When, at
the end of a half-hour, they returned, his fierce, impatient glance found them ominously grave.

"My lord," said Mr. Whistler, the foreman, "we have to beg of your lordship some directions
before we can bring our verdict. We have some doubt upon us whether there be sufficient proof
that she knew Hicks to have been in the army."

Well might they doubt it, for there was no proof at all. Yet he never hesitated to answer them.

"There is as full proof as proof can be. But you are judges of the proof. For my part, I thought
there was no difficulty in it."

"My lord," the foreman insisted, "we are in some doubt about it."

"I cannot help your doubts," he said irritably. "Was there not proved a discourse of the battle
and of the battle and of the army at supper-time?"

"But, my lord, we are not satisfied that she had notice that Hicks was in the army."

He glowered upon them in silence for a moment. They deserved to be themselves indicted for
their slowness to perceive where lay their duty to their king.

"I cannot tell what would satisfy you," he said; and sneered. "Did she not inquire of Dunne
whether Hicks had been in the army? And when he told her he did not know, she did not say she
would refuse if he had been, but ordered him to come by night, by which it is evident she suspected
it."

He ignored, you see, her own complete explanation of that circumstance.

"And when Hicks and Nelthorp came, did she not discourse with them about the battle and the
army?" (As if that were not at the time a common topic of discussion.) "Come, come, gentlemen,"
he said, with amazing impudence, "it is plain proof."

But Mr. Whistler was not yet satisfied.

"We do not remember, my lord, that it was proved that she asked any such question."

That put him in a passion.

"Sure," he bellowed, "you do not remember anything that has passed. Did not Dunne tell you
there was such a discourse, and she was by? But if there were no such proof, the circumstances
and management of the thing are as full proof as can be. I wonder what it is you doubt of!"

Mrs. Lisle had risen. There was a faint flush of excitement on her grey old face.

"My lord, I hope--" she began, in trembling tones, to get no further.

"You must not speak now!" thundered her terrible judge; and thus struck her silent.

The brief resistance to his formidable will was soon at an end. Within a quarter of an hour
the jury announced their verdict. They found her guilty.

"Gentlemen," said his lordship, "I did not think I should have occasion to speak after your
verdict, but, finding some hesitancy and doubt among you, I cannot but say I wonder it should
come about; for I think, in my conscience, the evidence was as full and plain as it could be,
and if I had been among you, and she had been my own mother, I should have found her guilty."

She was brought up for sentence on the morrow, together with several others subsequently convicted.
Amid fresh invectives against the religion she practised, he condemned her to be burned alive--which
was the proper punishment for high treason--ordering the sheriff to prepare for her execution
that same afternoon.

"But look you, Mrs. Lisle," he added, "we that are the judges shall stay in town an hour or
two. You shall have pen, ink, and paper, and if, in the mean time, you employ that pen, ink,
and paper and that hour or two well--you understand what I mean it may be that you shall hear
further from us in a deferring of this execution."

What was this meaning that he assumed she understood? Jeffreys had knowledge of Kirke's profitable
traffic in the West, and it is known that he spared no means of acquiring an estate suitable
to his rank which he did not possess by way of patrimony. Thus cynically he invited a bribe.

It is the only inference that explains the subsequent rancour he displayed against her, aroused
by her neglect to profit by his suggestions. The intercession of the divines of Winchester
procured her a week's reprieve, and in that week her puissant friends in London, headed by
the Earl of Abergavenny, petitioned the King on her behalf. Even Feversham, the victor of Sedgemoor,
begged her life of the King--bribed to it, as men say, by an offer of a thousand pounds. But
the King withheld his mercy upon the plea that he had promised Lord Jeffreys he would not reprieve
her, and the utmost clemency influential petitions could wring from James II was that she should
be beheaded instead of burned.

She suffered in the market-place of Winchester on September 2d. Christian charity was all her
sin, and for this her head was demanded in atonement. She yielded it with a gentle fortitude
and resolution. In lieu of speech, she left with the sheriff a pathetic document wherein she
protests her innocence of all offence against the King, and forgives her enemies specifically--the
judge, who prejudiced her case, and forgot that "the Court should be counsel for the prisoner,"
and Colonel Penruddock, "though he told me he could have taken those men before they came to
my house."

Between those lines you may read the true reason why the Lady Alice Lisle died. She died to
slake the cruelly vindictive thirst of King James II on the one hand, and Colonel Penruddock
on the other, against her husband who had been dead for twenty years.

V. THE NIGHT OF MASSACRE--The Story Of The Saint Bartholomew

There are elements of mystery about the massacre of Saint Bartholomew over which, presumably,
historians will continue to dispute as long as histories are written. Indeed, it is largely
of their disputes that the mystery is begotten. Broadly speaking, these historians may be divided
into two schools--Catholic and anti-Catholic. The former have made it their business to show
that the massacre was purely a political affair, having no concern with religion; the latter
have been equally at pains to prove it purely an act of religious persecution having no concern
with politics. Those who adopt the latter point of view insist that the affair was long premeditated,
that it had its source in something concerted some seven years earlier between Catherine of
Medicis and the sinister Duke of Alva. And they would seem to suggest that Henry of Navarre,
the nominal head of the Protestant party, was brought to Paris to wed Marguerite de Valois
merely so that by this means the Protestant nobles of the kingdom, coming to the capital for
the wedding, should be lured to their destruction.

It does not lie within the purview of the present narrative to enter into a consideration of
the arguments of the two schools, nor will it be attempted.

But it may briefly be stated that the truth lies probably in a middle course of reasoning--that
the massacre was political in conception and religious in execution; or, in other words, that
statecraft deliberately made use of fanaticism as of a tool; that the massacre was brought
about by a sudden determination begotten of opportunity which is but another word for Chance.

Against the theory of premeditation the following cardinal facts may be urged:

(a) The impossibility of guarding for seven years a secret that several must have shared;

(b) The fact that neither Charles IX nor his mother Catherine were in any sense bigoted Catholics,
or even of a normal religious sincerity.

(c) The lack of concerted action--so far as the kingdom generally was concerned--in the execution
of the massacre.

A subsidiary disproof lies in the attempted assassination of Coligny two days before the massacre,
an act which might, by putting the Huguenots on their guard, have caused the miscarriage of
the entire plan--had it existed.

It must be borne in mind that for years France had been divided by religious differences into
two camps, and that civil war between Catholic and Huguenot had ravaged and distracted the
country. At the head of the Protestant party stood that fine soldier Gaspard de Chatillon,
Admiral de Coligny, virtually the Protestant King of France, a man who raised armies, maintaining
them by taxes levied upon Protestant subjects, and treated with Charles IX as prince with prince.
At the head of the Catholic party--the other imperium in imperio--stood the Duke of Guise.
The third and weakest party in the State, serving, as it seemed, little purpose beyond that
of holding the scales between the other turbulent two, was the party of the King.

The motives and events that precipitated the massacre are set forth in the narration of the
King's brother, the Duke of Anjou (afterwards Henri III). It was made by him to Miron, his
physician and confidential servant in Cracow, when he ruled there later as King of Poland,
under circumstances which place it beyond suspicion of being intended to serve ulterior aims.
For partial corroboration, and for other details of the massacre itself, we have the narratives,
among others, of Sully, who was then a young man in the train of the King of Navarre, and of
Lusignan, a gentleman of the Admiral's household. We shall closely follow these in our reconstruction
of the event and its immediate causes.

The gay chatter of the gallants and ladies thronging the long gallery of the Louvre sank and
murmured into silence, and a movement was made to yield a free passage to the King, who had
suddenly made his appearance leaning affectionately upon the shoulder of the Admiral de Coligny.

The Duke of Anjou, a slender, graceful young man in a gold-embroidered suit of violet, forgot
the interest he was taking in his beautiful hands to bend lower over the handsome Madame de
Nemours what time the unfriendly eyes of both were turned upon the Admiral.

The King and the great Huguenot leader came slowly down the gallery, an oddly contrasting pair.
Coligny would have been the taller by a half-head but for his stoop, yet in spite of it there
was energy and military vigour in his carriage, just as there was a severe dignity amounting
to haughtiness in his scarred and wrinkled countenance. A bullet that had pierced his cheek
and broken three of his teeth at the battle of Moncontour had left a livid scar that lost itself
in his long white beard. His forehead was high and bald, and his eyes were of a steely keenness
under their tufted brows. He was dressed with Calvinistic simplicity entirely in black, and
just as this contrasted with the King's suit of sulphur-coloured satin, so did the gravity
of his countenance contrast with the stupidity of his sovereign's.

Charles IX, a slimly built young man in his twenty-fourth year, was of a pallid, muddy complexion,
with great, shifty, greenish eyes, and a thick, pendulous nose. The protruding upper lip of
his long, thin mouth gave him an oafish expression, which was increased by his habit of carrying
his head craned forward.

His nature was precisely what you would have expected from his appearance--dull and gross.
He was chiefly distinguished among men of birth for general obscenity of speech and morphological
inventiveness in blasphemy.

At the end of the gallery Coligny stooped to kiss the royal hand in leave-taking. With his
other hand Charles patted the Admiral's shoulder.

"Count me your friend," he said, "body and soul, heart and bowels, even as I count you mine.
Fare you well, my father."

Coligny departed, and the King retraced his steps, walking quickly, his head hunched between
his shoulders, his baleful eyes looking neither to left nor right. As he passed out, the Duke
of Anjou quitted the side of Madame de Nemours, and went after him. Then at last the suspended
chatter of the courtiers broke loose again.

The King was pacing his cabinet--a simple room furnished with a medley of objects appertaining
to study, to devotion, and to hunting. A large picture of the Virgin hung from a wall flanked
on either side by an arquebus, and carrying a hunting-horn on one of its upper corners. A little
alabaster holy-water font near the door, crowned by a sprig of palm, seemed to serve as a receptacle
for hawk-bells and straps. There was a writing-table of beautifully carved walnut near the
leaded window, littered with books and papers--a treatise on hunting lay cheek by jowl with
a Book of Hours; a string of rosary beads and a dog-whip lay across an open copy of Ronsard's
verses. The King was quite the vilest poetaster of his day.

Charles looked over his shoulder as his brother entered. The scowl on his face deepened when
he saw who came, and with a grunt he viciously kicked the liver-coloured hound that lay stretched
at his feet. The hound fled yelping to a corner, the Duke checked, startled, in his advance.

"Well?" growled the King. "Well? Am I never to have peace? Am I never to be alone? What now?
Bowels of God! What do you want?"

His green eyes smouldered, his right hand opened and closed on the gold hilt of the dagger
at his girdle:

Scared by the maniac ferocity of this reception, the young Duke precipitately withdrew.

"It is nothing. Another time, since I disturb you now." He bowed and vanished, followed by
an evil, cackling laugh.

Anjou knew how little his brother loved him, and he confesses how much he feared him in that
moment. But under his fear it is obvious that there was lively resentment. He went straight
in quest of his mother, whose darling he was, to bear her the tale of the King's mood, and
what he accounted, no doubt rightly, the cause of it.

"It is the work of that pestilential Huguenot admiral," he announced, at the end of a long
tirade, "It is always thus with him after he has seen Coligny."

Catherine of Medicis considered. She was a fat, comfortable woman, with a thick nose, pinched
lips, and sleepy eyes.

"Charles," she said at length, in her monotonous, emotionless voice, "is a weathercock that
turns with every wind that blows upon him. You should know him by now." And she yawned, so
that one who did not know her and her habit of perpetually yawning might have supposed that
she was but indifferently interested.

They were alone together in the intimate little tapestried room she called her oratory. She
half sat, half reclined upon a couch of rose brocade. Anjou stood over by the window, his back
to it, so that his pale face was in shadow. He considered his beautiful hands, which he was
reluctant to lower, lest the blood should flow into them and mar their white perfection.

"The Admiral's influence over him is increasing," he complained, "and he uses it to lessen
our own."

"Do I not know it?" came her dull voice.

"It is time to end it," said Anjou passionately, "before he ends us. Your influence grows weaker
every day and the Admiral's stronger. Charles begins to take sides with him against us. We
shall have him a tool of the Huguenot party before all is done. Ah, mon Dieu! You should have
seen him leaning upon the shoulder of that old parpaillot, calling him 'my father,' and protesting
himself his devoted friend 'body and soul, heart and bowels,' in his own words. And when I
seek him afterwards, he scowls and snarls at me, and fingers his dagger as if he would have
it in my throat. It is plain to see upon what subject the old scoundrel entertained him." And
again he repeated, more fiercely than before: "It is time to end it!"

"I know," she said, ever emotionless before so much emotion. "And it shall be ended. The old
assassin should have been hanged years ago for guiding the hand that shot Francois de Guise.
Daily he becomes a greater danger, to Charles, to ourselves, and to France. He is embroiling
us with Spain through this Huguenot army he is raising to go and fight the battles of Calvinism
in Flanders. A fine thing that. Ah, per Dio!" For a moment her voice was a little warmed and
quickened. "Catholic France at war with Catholic Spain for the sake of Huguenot Flanders!"
She laughed shortly. Then her voice reverted to its habitual sleepy level. "You are right.
It is time to end it. Coligny is the head of this rebellious beast. If we cut off the head,
perhaps the beast will perish. We will consult the Duke of Guise." She yawned again. "Yes,
the Duke of Guise will be ready to lend us his counsel and his aid. Decidedly we must get rid
of the Admiral."

That was on Monday, August 18th of that year 1572, and such was the firm purpose and energy
of that fat and seemingly sluggish woman, that within two days all necessary measures were
taken, and Maurevert, the assassin, was at his post in the house of Vilaine, in the Cloisters
of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois, procured for the purpose by Madame de Nemours, who bore the Admiral
a mortal hatred.

It was not, however, until the following Friday that Maurevert was given the opportunity of
carrying out the task to which he had been hired. On that morning, as the Admiral was passing,
accompanied by a few gentlemen of his household, returning from the Louvre to his house in
the Rue Betisy, the assassin did his work. There was a sudden arquebusade from a first-floor
window, and a bullet smashed two fingers of the Admiral's right hand, and lodged itself in
the muscles of his left arm.

With his maimed and bleeding hand he pointed to the window whence the shot had been fired,
bidding his gentlemen to force a way into the house and take the assassin. But whilst they
were breaking in at the front, Maurevert was making his escape by the back, where a horse waited
for him, and, though pursued, he was never overtaken.

News of the event was instantly borne to the King. It found him at tennis with the Duke of
Guise and the Admiral's son-in-law, Teligny.

"In this assassin's work, Sire," said the blunt gentleman whom Coligny had sent, "the Admiral
desires you to see the proof of the worth of the agreement between himself and Monsieur de
Guise that followed upon the treaty of peace of Saint-Germain."

The Duke of Guise drew himself stiffly up, but said no word. The King, livid with rage, looked
at him balefully a moment, then to vent some of his fury he smashed his racket against the wall.

"God's Blood!" he cried, mouthing horribly. "Am I then never to have rest?" He flung away the
broken remnants of his racket, and went out cursing. Questioning the messenger further, he
learnt that the shot had been fired from the house of Vilaine, a sometime tutor to the Duke
of Guise, and that the horse upon which the assassin had fled had been held for him by a groom
in the Guise livery.

Meanwhile the Duke and Monsieur de Teligny had gone their ways with no word spoken between
them--Guise to shut himself up in his hotel and assemble his friends, Teligny to repair at
once to his father-in-law.

At two o'clock in the afternoon, in response to an urgent request from the Admiral, the King
went to visit him, accompanied by the Queen-Mother, by his brothers Anjou and Alencon, and
a number of officers and courtiers. The royal party saw nothing of the excitement which had
been prevailing in the city ever since the morning's event, an excitement which subsided at
their approach. The King was gloomy, resentful, and silent, having so far refused to discuss
the matter with any one, denying audience even to his mother. Catherine and Anjou were vexed
by the miscarriage of the affair, anxious and no less silent than the King.

They found the Admiral awaiting them, calm and composed. The famous Ambroise Pare had amputated
the two broken fingers, and had dealt with the wound in the arm. But although Coligny might
be considered to have escaped lightly, and not to be in any danger, a rumour was abroad that
the bullet was poisoned; and neither the Admiral nor his people seem to have rejected the possibility.
One suspects, indeed, that capital was made out of it. It was felt, perhaps, that thus should
the Admiral maintain a greater influence with the King. For in any uncertainty as to whether
Coligny would live or die, the King's feelings must be more deeply stirred than if he knew
that the wound carried no peril to life.

Followed closely by his mother and his brothers, Charles swept through the spacious ante-chamber,
thronged now with grim-faced, resentful Huguenot gentlemen, and so entered the room where Coligny
reclined upon a day bed near the window. The Admiral made shift to rise, but this the King
hurried forward to prevent.

"Rest yourself, my dear father!" he cried, in accents of deep concern. "Heart of God! What
is this they have done to you? Assure me, at least, that your life is safe, or, by the Mass,
I'll--"

"I hold my life from God," the Admiral replied gravely, "and when He requires it of me I will
yield it up. That is nothing."

"Nothing? God's Blood! Nothing? The hurt is yours, my father, but the outrage mine; and I swear
to you, by the Blood and the Death, that I will take such a vengeance as shall never be forgotten!"

Thereupon he fell into such a storm of imprecation and blasphemy that the Admiral, a sincerely
devout, God-fearing heretic, shuddered to hear him.

"Calm, Sire!" he begged at last, laying his sound hand upon the King's velvet sleeve. "Be calm
and listen, for it is not to speak of myself, of these wounds, or of the wrong done me, that
I have presumed to beg you to visit me. This attempt to murder me is but a sign of the evil
that is stirring in France to sap your authority and power. But--" He checked and looked at
the three who stood immediately behind the King. "What I have to say is, if you will deign
to listen, for your private ear."

The King jerked round in a fashion peculiar to him; his every action was abrupt and spasmodic.
He eyed his mother and brothers shiftily. It was beyond his power to look any one directly
in the face.

"Outside!" he commanded, waving an impatient hand almost in their faces. "Do you hear? Leave
me to talk with my father the Admiral."

The young dukes fell back at once, ever in dread of provoking the horrible displays of passion
that invariably followed upon any resistance of his feeble will. But the sluggish Catherine
was not so easily moved.

"Is Monsieur de Coligny strong enough, do you think, to treat of affairs at present? Consider
his condition, I beg," she enjoined in her level voice.

"I thank you for your consideration, madame," said the Admiral, the ghost of an ironic smile
about his lips. "But I am strong enough, thank God! And even though my strength were less than
it is, it would be more heavily taxed by the thought that I had neglected my duty to His Majesty
than it ever could be by the performance of that duty."

"Ha! You hear?" snapped the King. "Go, then; go!"

They went, returning to the ante-chamber to wait until the audience should conclude. The three
stood there in the embrasure of a window that looked out upon the hot, sunlit courtyard. There,
as Anjou himself tells us, they found themselves hemmed about by some two hundred sullen, grim-faced
gentlemen and officers of the Admiral's party, who eyed them without dissembling their hostility,
who preserved a silence that was disturbed only by the murmurs of their constant whisperings,
and who moved to and fro before the royal group utterly careless of the proper degree of deference
and respect.

Isolated thus in that hostile throng, Catherine and her sons became more and more uneasy, so
that, as the Queen-Mother afterwards confessed, she was never in any place where her tarrying
was attended by so much fear, or her departure thence by so much pleasure.

It was this fear that spurred her at last to put an end to that secret conference in the room
beyond. She did it in characteristic manner. In the most complete outward composure, stifling
a yawn as she went, she moved deliberately across to the door, her sons following, rapped shortly
on the panel, and entered without waiting to be bidden.

The King, who was standing by the Admiral's side, wheeled sharply at the sound of the opening
door. His eyes blazed with sudden anger when he beheld his mother, but she was the first to speak.

"My son," she said, "I am concerned for the poor Admiral. He will have the fever if you continue
to permit him to weary himself with affairs at present. It is not to treat him as a friend
to prolong this interview. Let business wait until he is recovered, which will be the sooner
if he is given rest at present."

Coligny stroked his white beard in silence, while the King flared out, striding towards her:

"Par la Mort Dieu! What is this sudden concern for the Admiral?"

"Not sudden, my son," she answered in her dull voice, her eyes intent upon him, with something
magnetic in their sleepy glance that seemed to rob him of half his will. "None knows more accurately
than I the Admiral's precise, value to France."

Anjou behind her may have smiled at that equivocal phrase.

"God's Bowels! Am I King, or what am I?"

"It ill becomes a king to abuse the strength of a poor wounded subject," she returned, her
eyes ever regarding him steadily. "Come, Charles. Another day, when the Admiral shall have
recovered more fully, you may continue this discourse. Come now."

His anger was subdued to mere sullenness, almost infantile in its outward petulant expression.
He attempted to meet her glance, and he was completely lost.

"Perhaps... Ah, Ventre Dieu, my mother is right! Let the matter rest, then, my father. We will
talk of it again as soon as you are well."

He stepped up to the couch, and held out his hand.

Coligny took it, and his eyes looked up wistfully into the weak young face of his King.

"I thank you, Sire, for coming and for hearing me. Another day, if I am spared, I may tell
you more. Meanwhile, bear well in mind what I have said already. I have no interests in this
world but your own, Sire." And he kissed the royal hand in farewell.

Not until they were back in the Louvre did the Queen attempt to break upon the King's gloomy
abstraction, to learn--as learn she must--the subject of the Admiral's confidential communication.

Accompanied by Anjou, she sought him in his cabinet, nor would she be denied. He sat at his
writing-table, his head sunken between his shoulders, his receding chin in his cupped palms.
He glared at the pair as they entered, swore savagely, and demanded their business with him.

Catherine sat down with massive calm. Anjou remained standing beside and slightly behind her,
leaning upon the back of her tall chair.

"My son," she said bluntly, "I have come to learn what passed between you and Coligny."

"What passed? What concern is that of yours?"

"All your concerns are mine," she answered tranquilly. "I am your mother."

"And I am your king!" he answered, banging the table. "And I mean to be king!"

"By the grace of God and the favour of Monsieur de Coligny," she sneered, with unruffled calm.

"What's that?" His mouth fell open, and his eyes stared. A crimson flush overspread his muddy
complexion. "What's that?"

Her dull glance met and held his own whilst calmly she repeated her sneering words.

"And that is why I have come to you," she added. "If you are unable to rule without guidance,
I must at least do what I can so that the guidance shall not be that of a rebel, of one who
guides you to the end that he may master you."

"Master me!" he screamed. He rose in his indignation and faced her. But his glance, unable
to support her steady eyes, faltered and fell away. Foul oaths poured from his royal lips.
"Master me!" he repeated.

"Aye--master you," she answered him. "Master you until the little remnant of your authority
shall have been sapped; until you are no more than a puppet in the hands of the Huguenot party,
a roi faineant, a king of straw."

"By God, madame, were you not my mother--"

"It is because I am your mother that I seek to save you."

He looked at her again, but again his glance faltered. He paced the length of the room and
back, mouthing and muttering. Then he came to stand, leaning on the prie-dieu, facing her.

"By God's Death, madame, since you demand to know what the Admiral said, you shall. You prove
to me that what he told me was no more than true. He told me that a king is only recognized
in France as long as he is a power for good or ill over his subjects; that this power, together
with the management of all State affairs, is slipping, by the crafty contrivances of yourself
and Anjou there, out of my hands into your own; that this power and authority which you are
both stealing from me may one day be used against me and my kingdom. And he bade me be on my
guard against you both and take my measures. He gave me this counsel, madame, because he deemed
it his duty as one of my most loyal and faithful servants at the point of death, and--"

"The shameless hypocrite!" her dull, contemptuous voice interrupted him. "At the point of death!
Two broken fingers and a flesh-wound in the arm and he represents himself as in articulo mortis
that he may play upon you, and make you believe his lies."

Her stolidity of manner and her logic, ponderous and irresistible, had their effect. His big,
green eyes seemed to dilate, his mouth fell open.

"If--" he began, and checked, rapped out an oath, and checked again. "Are they lies, madame?"
he asked slowly.

She caught the straining note of hope in that question of his--a hope founded upon vanity,
the vanity to be king in fact, as well as king in name. She rose.

"To ask me that--me, your mother--is to insult me. Come, Anjou."

And on that she departed, craftily, leaving her suggestion to prey upon his mind.

But once alone in her oratory with Anjou, her habitual torpor was sloughed away. For once she
quivered and crimsoned and raised her voice, whilst for once her sleepy eyes kindled and flashed
as she inveighed against Coligny and the Huguenots.

For the moment, however, there was no more to be done. The stroke had failed; Coligny had survived
the attempt upon his life, and there was danger that on the recoil the blow might smite those
who had launched it. But on the morrow, which was Saturday, things suddenly assumed a very
different complexion.

That great Catholic leader, the powerful, handsome Duke of Guise, who, more than suspected
of having inspired the attempted assassination, had kept his hotel since yesterday, now sought
the Queen-Mother with news of what was happening in the city. Armed bands of Huguenot nobles
were riding through the streets, clamouring:

"Death to the assassins of the Admiral! Down with the Guisards!"

And, although a regiment of Gardes Francaises had been hastily brought to Paris to keep order,
the Duke feared grave trouble in a city which the royal wedding had filled with Huguenot gentlemen
and their following. Then, too, there were rumours that the Huguenots were arming everywhere--rumours
which, whether true or not, were, under the circumstances, sufficiently natural and probable
to be taken seriously.

Leaving Guise in her oratory, and summoning her darling Anjou, Catherine at once sought the
King. She may have believed the rumours, and she may even have stated them as facts beyond
dispute so as to strengthen and establish her case against Gaspard de Coligny.

"King Gaspard I," she told him, "is already taking his measures. The Huguenots are arming;
officers have been dispatched into the provinces to levy troops. The Admiral has ordered the
raising of ten thousand horse in Germany, and another ten thousand Swiss mercenaries in the
Cantons."

He stared at her vacuously. Some such rumour had already reached him, and he conceived that
here was definite confirmation of it.

"You may determine now who are your friends, who your loyal servants," she told him. "How is
so much force to be resisted in the state in which you find yourself? The Catholics exhausted,
and weary as they are by a civil war in which their king was of little account to them, are
going to arm so as to offer what resistance they can without depending upon you. Thus, within
your State you will have two great parties under arms, neither of which can be called your
own. Unless you stir yourself, and quickly, unless you choose now between friends and foes,
you will find yourself alone, isolated, in grave peril, without authority or power."

He sank overwhelmed to a chair, and took his head in his hands, cogitating. When next he looked
at her there was positive fear in his great eyes, a fear evoked by contemplation of the picture
which her words had painted for him.

He looked from her to Anjou.

"What then?" he asked. "What then? How is the danger to be averted?"

"By a simple stroke of the sword," she answered calmly. "Slice off at a blow the head of this
beast of rebellion, this hydra of heresy."

He huddled back, horror in his eyes. His hands slid slowly along the carved arms of his chair,
and clenched the ends so tightly that his knuckles looked like knobs of marble.

"Kill the Admiral?" he said slowly.

"The Admiral and the chief Huguenot leaders," she said, much in the tone she might have used,
were it a matter of wringing the necks of a dozen capons.

"Ah, ca! Par la Mort Dieu!" He heaved himself up, raging. "Thus would your hatred of him be
served. Thus would you--"

Coolly she sliced into his foaming speech.

"Not I--not I!" she said. "Do nothing upon my advice. Summon your Council. Send for Tavannes,
Biragues, Retz, and the others. Consult with them. They are your friends; you trust and believe
in them. When they know the facts, see if their counsel will differ from your mother's. Send
for them; they are in the Louvre now."

He looked at her a moment.

"Very well," he said; and reeled to the door, bawling hoarsely his orders.

They came, one by one--the Marshal de Tavannes, the Duke of Retz, the Duke of Nevers, the Chancellor
de Biragues, and lastly the Duke of Guise, upon whom the King scowled a jealous hatred that
was now fully alive.

The window, which overlooked the quay and the river, stood open to admit what air might be
stirring on that hot day of August.

Charles sat at his writing-table, sullen and moody, twining a string of beads about his fingers.
Catherine occupied the chair over beyond the table, Anjou sitting near her on a stool. The
others stood respectfully awaiting that the King should make known his wishes. The shifty royal
glance swept over them from under lowering brows; then it rested almost in challenge upon his
mother.

"Tell them," he bade her curtly.

She told them what already she had told her son, relating all now with greater detail and circumstance.
For some moments nothing was heard in that room but the steady drone of her unemotional voice.
When she had finished, she yawned and settled herself to hear what might be answered.

"Well," snapped the King, "you have heard. What do you advise? Speak out!"

Nevers was the first to answer.

"There is no other way," he said stiffly, "but that which Her Majesty advises. The danger is
grave. If it is to be averted, action must be prompt and effective."

Tavannes clasped his hands behind him and said much the same, as did presently the Chancellor.

Twisting and untwisting his chaplet of beads about his long fingers, his eyes averted, the
King heard each in turn. Then he looked up. His glance, deliberately ignoring Guise, settled
upon the Duke of Retz, who held aloof.

"And you, Monsieur le Marechal, what is your counsel?"

Retz drew himself up, as if bracing himself to meet opposing forces. He was a little pale,
but quite composed.

"If there is a man whom I should hate," he said, "it is this Gaspard de Coligny, who has defamed
me and all my family by the foul accusations he has put abroad. But I will not," he added firmly,
"take vengeance upon my enemies at the expense of my king and master. I cannot counsel a course
so disastrous to Your Majesty and the whole kingdom. Did we act as we have been advised, Sire,
can you doubt that we should be taxed--and rightly taxed in view of the treaty that has been
signed--with perfidy and disloyalty?"

Dead silence followed that bombshell of opposition, coming from a quarter whence it was least
expected. For Catherine and Anjou had confidently counted upon the Duke's hatred of Coligny
to ensure his support of their designs.

A little colour crept into the pale cheeks of the King. His glance kindled out of its sullenness.
He was as one who sees sudden hope amid despair.

"That is the truth," he said. "Messieurs, and you, madame my mother, you have heard the truth.
How do you like it?"

"Monsieur de Retz is deceived by an excess of loyalty," said Anjou quickly. "Because he bears
a personal enmity to the Admiral, he conceives that it would hurt his honour to speak otherwise.
It must savour to him, as he has said, of using his king and master to avenge his own personal
wrongs. We can respect Monsieur de Retz's view, although we hold it mistaken."

"Will Monsieur de Retz tell us what other course lies open?" quoth the bluff Tavannes.

"Some other course must be found," cried the King, rousing himself. "It must be found, do you
hear? I will not have you touch the life of my friend the Admiral. I will not have it--by the
Blood!"

A hubbub followed, all speaking at once, until the King banged the table, and reminded them
that his cabinet was not a fish-market.

"I say that there is no other way," Catherine insisted. "There cannot be two kings in France,
nor can there be two parties. For your own safety's sake, and for the safety of your kingdom,
I beseech you so to contrive that in France there be but one party with one head--yourself."

"Two kings in France?" he said. "What two kings?"

"Yourself and Gaspard I--King Coligny, the King of the Huguenots."

"He is my subject--my faithful, loyal subject," the King protested, but with less assurance.

"A subject who raises forces of his own, levies taxes of his own, garrisons Huguenot cities,"
said Biragues. "That is a very dangerous type of subject, Sire."

"A subject who forces you into war with Protestant Flanders against Catholic Spain," added
the blunt Tavannes.

"Forces me?" roared the King, half rising, his eyes aflash. "That is a very daring word."

"It would be if the proof were absent. Remember, Sire, his very speech to you before you permitted
him to embark upon preparations for this war. 'Give us leave,' he said, 'to make war in Flanders,
or we shall be compelled to make war upon yourself.'"

The King winced and turned livid. Sweat stood in beads upon his brow. He was touched in his
most sensitive spot. That speech of Coligny's was of all things the one he most desired to
forget. He twisted the chaplet so that the beads bit deeply into his fingers.

"Sire," Tavannes continued, "were I a king, and did a subject so address me, I should have
his head within the hour. Yet worse has happened since, worse is happening now. The Huguenots
are arming. They ride arrogantly through the streets of your capital, stirring up rebellion.
They are here in force, and the danger grows acute and imminent."

Charles writhed before them. He mopped his brow with a shaking hand.

"The danger--yes. I see that. I admit the danger. But Coligny--"

"Is it to be King Gaspard or King Charles?" rasped the voice of Catherine.

The chaplet snapped suddenly in the King's fingers. He sprang to his feet, deathly pale.

"So be it!" he cried. "Since it is necessary to kill the Admiral, kill him, then. Kill him!"
he screamed, in a fury that seemed aimed at those who forced this course upon him. "Kill him--but
see to it also that at the same time you kill every Huguenot in France, so that not one shall
be left to reproach me. Not one, do you hear? Take your measures and let the thing be done
at once." And on that, his face livid and twitching, his limbs shaking, he flung out of the
room and left them.

It was all the warrant they required, and they set to work at once there in the King's own
cabinet, where he had left them. Guise, who had hitherto been no more than a silent spectator,
assumed now the most active part. Upon his own shoulders he took the charge of seeing the Admiral
done to death.

The remainder of the day and a portion of the evening were spent in concerting ways and means.
They assured themselves of the Provost of the merchants of Paris, of the officers of the Gardes
Francaises and the three thousand Swiss, of the Captains of the quarters and other notoriously
factious persons who could be trusted as leaders. By ten o'clock at night all preparations
were made and it was agreed that the ringing of the bell of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois for matins
was to be the signal for the massacre.

A gentleman of the Admiral's household taking his way homeward that night passed several men
bearing sheaves of pikes upon their shoulders, and never suspected whom these weapons were
to arm. He met several small companies of soldiers marching quietly, their weapons shouldered,
their matches glowing, and still he suspected nothing, whilst in one quarter he stopped to
watch a man whose behaviour seemed curious, and discovered that he was chalking a white cross
upon the doors of certain houses.

Meeting soon afterwards another man with a bundle of weapons on his shoulder, the intrigued
Huguenot gentleman asked him bluntly what he carried and whither he went.

"It is for the divertissement at the Louvre tonight," he was answered.

But in the Louvre the Queen-Mother and the Catholic leaders, the labours of preparation ended,
were snatching a brief rest. Between two and three o'clock in the morning Catherine and Anjou
repaired again to the King's cabinet. They found him waiting there, his face haggard and his
eyes fevered.

He had spent a part of the evening at billiards, and among the players had been La Rochefoucauld,
of whom he was fond, and who had left him with a jest at eleven o'clock, little dreaming that
it was for the last time.

The three of them crossed to the window overlooking the river. They opened it, and peered out
fearfully. Even Catherine trembled now that the hour approached. The air was fresh and cool,
swept clean by the stirring breeze of the dawn, whose first ghostly gleams were already in
the sky. Suddenly, somewhere near at hand, a pistol cracked. The noise affected them oddly.
The King fell into an ague and his teeth chattered audibly. Panic seized him.

"By the Blood, it shall not be! It shall not be!" he cried suddenly.

He looked at his mother and his brother and they looked at him; ghastly were the faces of all
three, their eyes wide and staring with horror.

Charles swore in his terror that he would cancel all commands. And since Catherine and Anjou
made no attempt to hinder him, he summoned an officer and bade him seek out the Duke of Guise
at once and command him to stay his hand.

The messenger eventually found the Duke in the courtyard of the Admiral's house, standing over
the Admiral's dead body, which his assassins had flung down from the bedroom window. Guise
laughed, and stirred the head of the corpse with his foot, answering that the message came
too late. Even as he spoke the great bell of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois began to ring for matins.

The royal party huddled at that window of the Louvre heard it at the same moment, and heard,
as if in immediate answer, shots of arquebus and pistol, cries and screams near at hand, and
then, gradually swelling from a murmur, the baying of the fierce multitude. Other bells gave
tongue, until from every steeple in Paris the alarm rang out. The red glow from thousands of
torches flushed the heavens with a rosy tint as of dawn, the air grew heavy with the smell
of pitch and resin.

The King, clutching the sill of the window, poured out a stream of blasphemy from between his
chattering teeth. Then the hubbub rose suddenly near at hand. The neighbourhood of the Louvre
was populous with Huguenots, and into it now poured the excited Catholic citizens and soldiers.
Soon the quay beneath the palace windows presented the fiercest spectacle of any quarter, of Paris.

Half-clad men, women, and children fled screaming before the assassins, until they were checked
by the chains that everywhere had been placed across the streets. Some sought the river, hoping
to find a way of escape. But with Satanic foresight, the boats usually moored there had been
conveyed to the other side. Thus some hundreds of Huguenots were brought to bay, and done to
death under the very eyes of the King who had unleashed this horror. Doors were crashed open,
flames rose to heaven, men and women were shot down under the palace wall, bodies were flung
from windows, and on every side--in the words of D'Aubigne--the blood now flowed, seeking the
river.

The King watched a while, screams and curses pouring from his lips to be lost in the horrible
uproar. He turned, perhaps to upbraid his mother and his brother, but found that they were
no longer at his side. Behind him in the room a page was crouching, watching him with a white,
horrified face.

Suddenly the King laughed--it was the fierce, hysterical laugh of a madman. His eyes fell on
the arquebuses flanking the picture of the Mother of Mercy. He took one of them down, then
caught the boy by the collar of his doublet and dragged him forward to the window.

"Hither, and load for me!" he bade him, between peals of his terrible laughter. Then he levelled
the weapon across the sill of the window. "Parpaillots! Parpaillots!" he screamed. "Kill! Kill!"
and he discharged the arquebus into a fleeing group of Huguenots.

Five days later, the King--who by now had thrown the blame of the whole affair, with its slaughter
of some two thousand Huguenots, upon the Guises and their hatred of Coligny--rode out to Montfaucon
to behold the decapitated body of the Admiral, which hung from the gallows in chains. A courtier
of a poor but obtrusive wit leaned towards him.

"The Admiral becomes noisome, I think," he said.

The King's green eyes considered him, his lips curling grimly.

"The body of a dead enemy always smells sweet," he said. But in all that royal gallery of history
you will hardly find a more truly absurd figure than that of the resplendent Roi Soleil, the
Grand Monarque, the Fourteenth Louis of France.

I am not aware that he has ever been laughed at; certainly never to the extent which he deserves.
The flatterers of his day, inevitable products of his reign, did their work so thoroughly that
even in secret they do not appear to have dared to utter--possibly they did not even dare to
think--the truth about him. Their work survives, and when you have assessed the monstrous flattery
at its true worth, swept it aside and come down to the real facts of his life, you make the
discovery that the proudest title their sycophancy could bestow and his own fatuity accept--Le
Roi Soleil, the Sun-King--makes him what indeed he is: a king of opera bouffe. There is about
him at times something almost reminiscent of the Court buffoons of a century before, who puffed
themselves out with mock pride, and aped a sort of sovereignty to excite laughter; with this
difference, however, that in his own case it was not intended to be amusing.

A heartless voluptuary of mediocre intelligence, he contrived to wrap himself in what Saint-Simon
has called a "terrible majesty." He was obsessed by the idea of the dignity, almost the divinity--of
kingship. I cannot believe that he conceived himself human. He appears to have held that being
king was very like being God, and he duped the world by ceremonials of etiquette that were
very nearly sacramental. We find him burdening the most simple and personal acts of everyday
life with a succession of rites of an amazing complexity. Thus, when he rose in the morning,
princes of the blood and the first gentlemen of France were in attendance: one to present to
him his stockings, another to proffer on bended knee the royal garters, a third to perform
the ceremony of handing him his wig, and so on until the toilette of his plump, not unhandsome
person was complete. You miss the incense, you feel that some noble thurifer should have fumigated
him at each stage. Perhaps he never thought of it.

The evil fruits of his reign--evil, that is to say, from the point of view of his order, which
was swept away as so much anachronistic rubbish--did not come until a hundred years later.
In his own day France was great, and this not because but in spite of him. After all, he was
not the absolute ruler he conceived himself. There were such capable men as Colbert and Louvois
at the King's side'; there was the great genius of France which manifests itself when and as
it will, whatever the regime--and there was Madame de Montespan to whose influence not a little
of Louis's glory may be ascribed, since the most splendid years of his reign were those between
1668 and 1678 when she was maitresse en titre and more than Queen of France. The women played
a great part at the Court of Louis XIV, and those upon whom he turned his dark eyes were in
the main as wax under the solar rays of the Sun-King. But Madame de Montespan had discovered
the secret of reversing matters, so that in her hands it was the King who became as wax for
her modelling. It is with this secret--a page of the secret history of France that we are here
concerned.

Francoises Athenais de Tonnay-Charente had come to Court in 1660 as a maid of honour to the
Queen. Of a wit and grace to match her superb beauty, she was also of a perfervid piety, a
daily communicant, a model of virtue to all maids of honour. This until the Devil tempted her.
When that happened, she did not merely eat an apple; she devoured an entire orchard. Pride
and ambition brought about her downfall. She shared the universal jealousy of which Louise
de la Valliere was a victim, and coveted the honours and the splendour by which that unfortunate
favourite was surrounded.

Not even her marriage with the Marquis de Montespan some three years after her coming to Court
sufficed to overcome the longings born of her covetousness and ambition. And then, when the
Sun-King looked with favour upon her opulent charms, when at last she saw the object of her
ambition within reach, that husband of hers went very near to wrecking everything by his unreasonable
behaviour. This preposterous marquis had the effrontery to dispute his wife with Jupiter, was
so purblind as not to appreciate the honour the Sun-King proposed to do him.

In putting it thus, I but make myself the mouthpiece of the Court.

When Montespan began to make trouble by railing furiously against the friendship of the King
for his wife, his behaviour so amazed the King's cousin, Mademoiselle de Montpensier, that
she called him "an extravagant and extraordinary man." To his face she told him that he must
be mad to behave in this fashion; and so incredibly distorted were his views, that he did not
at all agree with her. He provoked scenes with the King, in which he quoted Scripture, made
opposite allusions to King David which were in the very worst taste, and even ventured to suggest
that the Sun-King might have to reckon with the judgment of God. If he escaped a lettre de
cachet and a dungeon in the Bastille, it can only have been because the King feared the further
spread of a scandal injurious to the sacrosanctity of his royal dignity.

The Marchioness fumed in private and sneered in public. When Mademoiselle de Montpensier suggested
that for his safety's sake she should control her husband's antics, she expressed her bitterness.

"He and my parrot," she said, "amuse the Court to my shame."

In the end, finding that neither by upbraiding the King nor by beating his wife could he prevail,
Monsieur de Montespan resigned himself after his own fashion. He went into widower's mourning,
dressed his servants in black, and came ostentatiously to Court in a mourning coach to take
ceremonious leave of his friends. It was an affair that profoundly irritated the Sun-King,
and very nearly made him ridiculous.

Thereafter Montespan abandoned his wife to the King. He withdrew first to his country seat,
and, later, from France, having received more than a hint that Louis was intending to settle
his score with him. By that time Madame de Montespan was firmly established as maitresse en
titre, and in January of 1669 she gave birth to the Duke of Maine, the first of the seven children
she was to bear the King. Parliament was to legitimize them all, declaring them royal children
of France, and the country was to provide titles, dignities, and royal rent-rolls for them
and their heirs forever. Do you wonder that there was a revolution a century later, and that
the people, grown weary of the parasitic anachronism of royalty, should have risen to throw
off the intolerable burden it imposed upon them?

The splendour of Madame de Montespan in those days was something the like of which had never
been seen at the Court of France. On her estate of Clagny, near Versailles, stood now a magnificent
chateau. Louis had begun by building a country villa, which satisfied her not at all.

"That," she told him, "might do very well for an opera-girl"; whereupon the infatuated monarch
had no alternative but to command its demolition, and call in the famous architect, Mansard,
to erect in its place an ultraroyal residence.

At Versailles itself, whilst the long-suffering Queen had to be content with ten rooms on the
second floor, Madame de Montespan was installed in twice that number on the first; and whilst
a simple page sufficed to carry the Queen's train at Court, nothing less than the wife of a
marshal of France must perform the same office for the favourite. She kept royal state as few
queens have ever kept it. She was assigned a troop of royal bodyguards for escort, and when
she travelled there was a never-ending train to follow her six-horse coach, and officers of
State came to receive her with royal honours wherever she passed.

In her immeasurable pride she became a tyrant, even over the King himself.

"Thunderous and triumphant," Madame de Sevigne describes her in those days when the Sun-King
was her utter and almost timid slave.

But constancy is not a Jovian virtue. Jupiter grew restless, and then, shaking off all restraint,
plunged into inconstancy of the most scandalous and flagrant kind. It is doubtful if the history
of royal amours, with all its fecundity, can furnish a parallel. Within a few months, Madame
de Soubise, Mademoiselle de Rochefort-Theobon, Madame de Louvigny, Madame de Ludres, and some
lesser ones passed in rapid succession through the furnace of the Sun-King's affection--which
is to say, through the royal bed--and at last the Court was amazed to see the Widow Scarron,
who had been appointed governess to Madame de Montespan's royal children, empanoplied in a
dignity and ceremony that left no doubt on the score of her true position at Court.

And so, after seven years of absolute sway in which homage had been paid her almost in awe
by noble and simple alike, Madame de Montespan, neglected now by Louis, moved amid reflections
of that neglect, with arrogantly smiling lips and desperate rage in her heart. She sneered
openly at the royal lack of taste, allowed her barbed wit to make offensive sport with the
ladies who supplanted her; yet, ravaged by jealousy, she feared for herself the fate which
through her had overtaken La Valliere.

That fear was with her now as she sat in the window embrasure, hell in her heart and a reflection
of it in her eyes, as, fallen almost to the rank of a spectator in that comedy wherein she
was accustomed to the leading part, she watched the shifting, chattering, glittering crowd.
And as she watched, her line of vision was crossed to her undoing by the slender, wellknit
figure of de Vanens, who, dressed from head to foot in black, detached sharply from that dazzling
throng. His face was pale and saturnine, his eyes dark, very level, and singularly piercing.
Thus his appearance served to underline the peculiar fascination which he exerted, the rather
sinister appeal which he made to the imagination.

This young Provencal nobleman was known to dabble in magic, and there were one or two dark
passages in his past life of which more than a whisper had gone abroad. Of being a student
of alchemy, a "philosopher"--that is to say, a seeker after the philosopher's stone, which
was to effect the transmutation of metals--he made no secret. But if you taxed him with demoniacal
practices he would deny it, yet in a way that carried no conviction.

To this dangerous fellow Madame de Montespan now made appeal in her desperate need.

Their eyes met as he was sauntering past, and with a lazy smile and a languid wave of her fan
she beckoned him to her side.

"They tell me, Vanens," said she, "that your philosophy succeeds so well that you are transmuting
copper into silver."

His piercing eyes surveyed her, narrowing; a smile flickered over his thin lips.

"They tell you the truth," he said. "I have cast a bar which has been purchased as good silver
by the Mint."

Her interest quickened. "By the Mint!" she echoed, amazed. "But, then, my friend--" She was
breathless with excitement. "It is a miracle."

"No less," he admitted. "But there is the greater miracle to come--the transmutation of base
metal into gold."

"And you will perform it?"

"Let me but conquer the secret of solidifying mercury, and the rest is naught. I shall conquer
it, and soon."

He spoke with easy confidence, a man stating something that he knew beyond the possibility
of doubt. The Marquise became thoughtful. She sighed.

"You are the master of deep secrets, Vanens. Have you none that will soften flinty hearts,
make them responsive?"

He considered this woman whom Saint-Simon has called "beautiful as the day," and his smile
broadened.

"Look in your mirror for the alchemy needed there," he bade her.

Anger rippled across the perfect face. She lowered

"I have looked--in vain. Can you not help me, Vanens, you who know so much?"

"A love-philtre?" said he, and hummed. "Are you in earnest?"

"Do you mock me with that question? Is not my need proclaimed for all to see?"

Vanens became grave.

"It is not an alchemy in which myself I dabble," he said slowly. "But I am acquainted with
those who do."

She clutched his wrist in her eagerness.

"I will pay well," she said.

"You will need to. Such things are costly." He glanced round to see that none was listening,
then bending nearer: "There is a sorceress named La Voisin in the Rue de la Tannerie, well
known as a fortuneteller to many ladies of the Court, who at a word from me will do your need."

La Montespan turned white. The piety in which she had been reared--the habits of which clung
to her despite the irregularity of her life-made her recoil before the thing that she desired.
Sorcery was of the Devil. She told him so. But Vanens laughed.

"So that it be effective. . ." said he with a shrug.

And then across the room floated a woman's trilling laugh. She looked in the direction of the
sound and beheld the gorgeous figure of the King bending--yet haughty and condescending even
in adoration--over handsome Madame de Ludres. Pride and ambition rose up in sudden fury to
trample on religious feeling. Let Vanens take her to this witch of his, for be the aid what
it might, she must have it.

And so, one dark night late in the year, Louis de Vanens handed a masked and muffled lady from
a coach at the corner of the Rue de la Tannerie, and conducted her to the house of La Voisin.

The door was opened for them by a young woman of some twenty years of age--Marguerite Monvoisin,
the daughter of the witch--who led them upstairs to a room that was handsomely furnished and
hung with fantastic tapestry of red designs upon a black ground--designs that took monstrous
shapes in the flickering light of a cluster of candles. Black curtains parted, and from between
them stepped a short, plump woman, of a certain comeliness, with two round black beads of eyes.
She was fantastically robed in a cloak of crimson velvet, lined with costly furs and closely
studded with double-headed eagles in fine gold, which must have been worth a prince's ransom;
and she wore red shoes on each of which there was the same eagle design in gold.

"Ah, Vanens!" she said familiarly.

He bowed.

"I bring you," he announced, "a lady who has need of your skill."

And he waved a hand towards the tall cloaked figure at his side.

La Voisin looked at the masked face.

"Velvet faces tell me little, Madame la Marquise," she said calmly. "Nor, believe me, will
the King look at a countenance that you conceal from me."

There was an exclamation of surprise and anger from Madame de Montespan. She plucked off her mask.

"You knew me?"

"Can you wonder?" asked La Voisin, "since I have told you what you carry concealed in your heart?"

Madame de Montespan was as credulous as only the very devout can be.

"Since that is so, since you know already what I seek, tell me can you procure it me?" she
asked in a fever of excitement. "I will pay well."

La Voisin smiled darkly.

"Obdurate, indeed, is the case that will not yield to such medicine as mine," she said. "Let
me consider first what must be done. In a few days I shall bring you word. But have you courage
for a great ordeal?"

"For any ordeal that will give me what I want."

"In a few days, then, you shall hear from me," said the witch, and so dismissed the great lady.

Leaving a heavy purse behind her, as Vanens had instructed her, the Marchioness departed with
her escort. And there, with that initiation, as far as we can ascertain, ended Louis de Vanens's
connection with the affair.

At Clagny Madame de Montespan waited for three days in a fever of impatience for the coming
of the witch. But when at last La Voisin presented herself, the proposal that she had to make
was one before which the Marchioness recoiled in horror and some indignation.

The magic that La Voisin suggested involved a coadjutor, the Abbe Guibourg, and the black mass
to be celebrated by him. Madame de Montespan had heard something of these dread sacrificial
rites to Satan; sufficient to fill her with loathing and disgust of the whitefaced, beady-eyed
woman who dared to insult her by the proposal. She fumed and raged a while, and even went near
to striking La Voisin, who looked on with inscrutable face and stony, almost contemptuous,
indifference. Before that impenetrable, almost uncanny, calm, Madame de Montespan's fury at
last abated. Then the urgency of her need becoming paramount, she desired more clearly to be
told what would be expected of her. What the witch told her was more appalling than anything
she could have imagined. But La Voisin argued:

"Can anything be accomplished without cost? Can anything be gained in this life without payment
of some kind?"

"But the price of this is monstrous!" Madame de Montespan protested.

"Measure it by the worldly advantages to be gained. They are not small, madame. To enjoy boundless
wealth, boundless power, and boundless honour, to be more than queen--is not all this worth
some sacrifice?"

To Madame de Montespan it must have been worth any sacrifice in this world or the next, since
in the end she conquered her disgust, and agreed to lend herself to this horror.

Three masses, she was told, would be necessary to ensure success, and it was determined that
they should be celebrated in the chapel of the Chateau de Villebousin, where Guibourg had been
almoner, to which he had access, and which was at the time untenanted.

The chateau was a gloomy mediaeval fortress, blackened by age, and standing, surrounded by
a moat, in a lonely spot some two miles to the south of Paris. Thither on a dark, gusty night
of March came Madame de Montespan, accompanied by her confidential waiting-woman, Mademoiselle
Desceillets. They left the coach to await them on the Orleans road, and thence, escorted by
a single male attendant, they made their way by a rutted, sodden path towards the grim castle
looming faintly through the enveloping gloom.

The wind howled dismally about the crenellated turrets; and a row of poplars, standing like
black, phantasmal guardians of the evil place, bent groaning before its fury. From the running
waters of the moat, swollen by recent rains, came a gurgling sound that was indescribably wicked.

Desocillets was frightened by the dark, the desolate loneliness and eeriness of the place;
but she dared utter no complaint as she stumbled forward over the uneven ground, through the
gloom and the buffeting wind, compelled by the suasion of her mistress's imperious will. Thus,
by a drawbridge spanning dark, oily waters, they came into a vast courtyard and an atmosphere
as of mildew. A studded door stood ajar, and through the gap, from a guiding beacon of infamy,
fell a rhomb of yellow light, suddenly obscured by a squat female figure when the steps of
the Marchioness and her companions fell upon the stones of the yard.

It was La Voisin who stood on the threshold to receive her client. In the stone-flagged hall
behind her the light of a lantern revealed her daughter, Marguerite Monvoisin, and a short,
crafty-faced, misshapen fellow in black homespun and a red wig--a magician named Lesage, one
of La Voisin's coadjutors, a rogue of some talent who exploited the witches of Paris to his
own profit.

Leaving Leroy--the Marchioness's male attendant below in this fellow's company, La Voisin took
up a candle and lighted Madame de Montespan up the broad stone staircase, draughty and cold,
to the ante-room of the chapel on the floor above. Mademoiselle Desceillets followed closely
and fearfully, and Marguerite Monvoisin came last.

They entered the ante-room, a spacious chamber, bare of furniture save for an oaken table in
the middle, some faded and mildewed tapestries, and a cane-backed settle of twisted walnut
over against the wall. An alabaster lamp on the table made an island of light in that place
of gloom, and within the circle of its feeble rays stood a gross old man of some seventy years
of age in sacerdotal garments of unusual design: the white alb worn over a greasy cassock was
studded with black fir-cones; the stole and maniple were of black satin, with fir-cones wrought
in yellow thread.

His inflamed countenance was of a revolting hideousness: his cheeks were covered by a network
of blue veins, his eyes squinted horribly, his lips vanished inwards over toothless gums, and
a fringe of white hair hung in matted wisps from his high, bald crown. This was the infamous
Abbe Guibourg, sacristan of Saint Denis, an ordained priest who had consecrated himself to
the service of the Devil.

He received the great lady with a low bow which, despite herself, she acknowledged by a shudder.
She was very pale, and her eyes were dilating and preternaturally bright. Fear began to possess
her, yet she suffered herself to be ushered into the chapel, which was dimly illumined by a
couple of candles standing beside a basin on a table. The altar light had been extinguished.
Her maid would have hung back, but that she feared to be parted from her mistress. She passed
in with her in the wake of Guibourg, and followed by La Voisin, who closed the door, leaving
her daughter in the ante-room.

Although she had never been a participant in any of the sorceries practised by her mother,
yet Marguerite was fully aware of their extent, and more than guessed what horrors were taking
place beyond the closed doors of the chapel. The very thought of them filled her with loathing
and disgust as she sat waiting, huddled in a corner of the settle. And yet when presently through
the closed doors came the drone of the voice of that unclean celebrant, to blend with the whine
of the wind in the chimney, Marguerite, urged by a morbid curiosity she could not conquer,
crept shuddering to the door, which directly faced the altar, and going down on her knees applied
her eye to the keyhole.

What she saw may very well have appalled her considering the exalted station of Madame de Montespan.
She beheld the white, sculptural form of the royal favourite lying at full length supine upon
the altar, her arms outstretched, holding a lighted candle in each hand. Immediately before
her stood the Abbe Guibourg, his body screening the chalice and its position from the eye of
the watching girl.

She heard the whine of his voice pattering the Latin of the mass, which he was reciting backwards
from the last gospel; and occasionally she heard responses muttered by her mother, who with
Mademoiselle Desceillets was beyond Marguerite's narrow range of vision.

Apart from the interest lent to the proceedings by the presence of the royal favourite the
affair must have seemed now very stupid and pointless to Marguerite, although she would certainly
not have found it so had she known enough Latin to understand the horrible perversion of the
Credo. But when the Offertory was reached, matters suddenly quickened. In stealing away from
the door, she was no more than in time to avoid being caught spying by her mother, who now
issued from the chapel.

La Voisin crossed the ante-room briskly and went out.

Within a very few minutes she was back again, her approach now heralded by the feeble, quavering
squeals of a very young child.

Marguerite Monvoisin was sufficiently acquainted with the ghastly rites to guess what was impending.
She was young, and herself a mother. She had her share of the maternal instinct alive in every
female animal--with the occasional exception of the human pervert--and the hoarse, plaintive
cries of that young child chilled her to the soul with horror. She felt the skin roughening
and tightening upon her body, and a sense of physical sickness overcame her. That and the fear
of her mother kept her stiff and frozen in an angle of the settle until La Voisin had passed
through and reentered the chapel bearing that piteous bundle in her arms.

Then, when the door had closed again, the girl, horrified and fascinated, sped back to watch.
She saw that unclean priest turn and receive the child from La Voisin. As it changed hands
its cries were stilled.

Guibourg faced the altar once more, that little wisp of humanity that was but a few days old
held now aloft, naked, in his criminal hands. His muttering, slobbering voice pronouncing the
words of that demoniac consecration reached the ears of the petrified girl at the keyhole.

"Ashtaroth, Asmodeus, Princes of Affection, I conjure you to acknowledge the sacrifice I offer
to you of this child for the things I ask of you, which are that the King's love for me shall
be continued, and that honoured by princes and princesses nothing shall be denied me of all
that I may ask."

A sudden gust of wind smote and rattled the windows of the chapel and the ante-room, as if
the legions of hell had flung themselves against the walls of the chateau. There was a rush
and clatter in the chimney of the ante-room's vast, empty fireplace, and through the din Marguerite,
as her failing limbs sank under her and she slithered down in a heap against the chapel door,
seemed to hear a burst of exultantly cruel satanic laughter. With chattering teeth and burning
eyes she sat huddled, listening in terror. The child began to cry again, more violently, more
piteously; then, quite suddenly, there was a little choking cough, a gurgle, the chink of metal
against earthenware, and silence.

When some moments later the squat figure of La Voisin emerged from the chapel, Marguerite was
back in the shadows, hunched on the settle to which she had crawled. She saw that her mother
now carried a basin under her arm, and she did not need the evidence of her eyes to inform
her of the dreadful contents that the witch was bearing away in it.

Meanwhile in the chapel the ineffably blasphemous rites proceeded. To the warm human blood
which had been caught in the consecrated chalice, Guibourg had added, among other foulnesses,
powdered cantharides, the dust of desiccated moles, and the blood of bats. By the addition
of flour he had wrought the ingredients into an ineffable paste, and over this, through the
door, which La Voisin had left ajar, Marguerite heard his voice pronouncing the dread words
of Transubstantiation.

Marguerite's horror mounted until it threatened to suffocate her. It was as if some hellish
miasma, released by Guibourg's monstrous incantations, crept through to permeate and poison
the air she breathed.

It would be a half-hour later when Madame de Montespan at last came out. She was of a ghastly
pallor, her limbs shook and trembled under her as she stepped forth, and there was a wild horror
in her staring eyes. Yet she contrived to carry herself almost defiantly erect, and she spoke
sharply to the half-swooning Desceillets, who staggered after her.

She took her departure from that unholy place bearing with her the host compounded of devilish
ingredients which when dried and reduced to powder was to be administered to the King to ensure
the renewal of his failing affection for her.

The Marchioness contrived that a creature of her own, an officer of the buttery in her pay,
should introduce it into the royal soup. The immediate and not unnatural result was that the
King was taken violently ill, and Madame de Montespan's anxiety and suspense were increased
thereby. On his recovery, however, it would seem that the demoniac sacrament--thrice repeated
by then--had not been in vain.

The sequel, indeed, appeared to justify Madame de Montespan's faith in sorcery, and to compensate
her for all the horror to which in her despair she had submitted. Madame de Ludres found herself
coldly regarded by the convalescent King. Very soon she was discarded, the Widow Scarron neglected,
and the fickle monarch was once more at the feet of the lovely marchioness, her utter and devoted
slave.

Thus was Madame de Montespan "thunderously triumphant" once more, and established as firmly
as 'ever in the Sun-King's favour. Madame de Sevigne, in speaking of this phase of their relations,
dilates upon the completeness of the reconciliation, and tells us that the ardour of the first
years seemed now to have returned. And for two whole years it continued thus. Never before
had Madame de Montespan's sway been more absolute, no shadow came to trouble, the serenity
of her rule.

But it proved, after all, to be no more than the last flare of an expiring fire that was definitely
quenched at last, in 1679, by Mademoiselle de Fontanges. A maid of honour to madame, she was
a child of not more than eighteen years, fair and flaxen, with pink cheeks and large, childish
eyes; and it was for this doll that the regal Montespan now found herself discarded.

Honours rained upon the new favourite. Louis made her a duchess with an income of twenty thousand
livres, and deeply though this may have disgusted his subjects, it disgusted Madame de Montespan
still more. Blinded by rage she openly abused the new duchess, and provoked a fairly public
scene with Louis, in which she gave him her true opinion of him with a disturbing frankness.

"You dishonour yourself," she informed him among other things. "And you betray your taste when
you make love to a pink-and-white doll, a little fool that has no more wit nor manners than
if she were painted on canvas!" Then, with an increase of scorn, she delivered herself of an
unpardonable apostrophe: "You, a king, to accept the inheritance of that chit's rustic lovers!"

He flushed and scowled upon her.

"That is an infamous falsehood!" he exclaimed. "Madame, you are unbearable!" He was very angry,
and it infuriated him the more that she should stand so coldly mocking before an anger that
could bow the proudest heads in France. "You have the pride of Satan, your greed is insatiable,
your domineering spirit utterly insufferable, and you have the most false and poisonous tongue
in the world!"

Her brutal answer bludgeoned that high divinity to earth.

"With all my imperfections," she sneered, "at least I do not smell as badly as you do!"

It was an answer that extinguished her last chance. It was fatal to the dignity, to the "terrible
majesty" of Louis. It stripped him of all divinity, and revealed him authoritatively as intensely
and even unpleasantly human. It was beyond hope of pardon.

His face turned the colour of wax. A glacial silence hung over the agonized witnesses of that
royal humiliation. Then, without a word, in a vain attempt to rescue the dignity she had so
cruelly mauled, he turned, his red heels clicked rapidly and unsteadily across the polished
floor, and he was gone.

When Madame de Montespan realized exactly what she had done, nothing but rage remained to her--rage
and its offspring, vindictiveness. The Duchess of Fontanges must not enjoy her victory, nor
must Louis escape punishment for his faithlessness. La Voisin should afford her the means to
accomplish this. And so she goes once more to the Rue de la Tannerie.

Now, the matter of Madame de Montespan's present needs was one in which the witches were particularly
expert. Were you troubled with a rival, did your husband persist in surviving your affection
for him, did those from whom you had expectations cling obstinately and inconsiderately to
life, the witches by incantations and the use of powders--in which arsenic was the dominant
charm--could usually put the matter right for you. Indeed, so wide and general was the practice
of poisoning become, that the authorities, lately aroused to the fact by the sensational revelations
of the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, had set up in this year 1670 the tribunal known as the
Chambre Ardente to inquire into the matter, and to conduct prosecutions.

La Voisin promised help to the Marchioness. She called in another witch of horrible repute,
named La Filastre, her coadjutor Lesage, and two expert poisoners, Romani and Bertrand, who
devised an ingenious plot for the murder of the Duchess of Fontanges. They were to visit her,
Romani as a cloth merchant, and Bertrand as his servant, to offer her their wares, including
some Grenoble gloves, which were the most beautiful gloves in the world and unfailingly irresistible
to ladies. These gloves they prepared in accordance with certain magical recipes in such a
way that the Duchess, after wearing them, must die a lingering death in which there could be
no suspicion of poisoning.

The King was to be dealt with by means of a petition steeped in similar powders, and should
receive his death by taking it into his hands. La Voisin herself was to go to Saint-Germain
to present this petition on Monday, March 13th, one of those days on which, according to ancient
custom, all comers were admitted to the royal presence.

Thus they disposed. But Fate was already silently stalking La Voisin.

It is to the fact that an obscure and vulgar woman had drunk one glass of wine too many three
months earlier that the King owed his escape.

If you are interested in the almost grotesque disparity that can lie between cause and effect,
here is a subject for you. Three months earlier a tailor named Vigoureux, whose wife secretly
practised magic, had entertained a few friends to dinner, amongst whom was an intimate of his
wife's, named Marie Bosse. This Marie Bosse it was who drank that excessive glass of wine which,
drowning prudence, led her to boast of the famous trade she drove as a fortune-teller to the
nobility, and even to hint of something further.

"Another three poisonings," she chuckled, "and I shall retire with my fortune made!"

An attorney who was present pricked up his ears, bethought him of the tales that were afloat,
and gave information to the police. The police set a trap for Marie Bosse, and she betrayed
herself. Later, under torture, she betrayed La Vigoureux. La Vigoureux betrayed others, and
these others again.

The arrest of Marie Bosse was like knocking down the first of a row of ninepins, but none could
have suspected that the last of these stood in the royal apartments.

On the day before she was to repair to Saint-Germain, La Voisin, betrayed in her turn, received
a surprise visit from the police--who, of course, had no knowledge of the regicide their action
was thwarting--and she was carried off to the Chatelet. Put to the question, she revealed a
great deal; but her terror of the horrible punishment reserved for regicides prevented her
to the day of her death at the stake--in February of 1680 from saying a word of her association
with Madame de Montespan.

But there were others whom she betrayed under torture, and whose arrest followed quickly upon
her own, who had not her strength of character. Among these were La Filastre and the magician
Lesage. When it was found that these two corroborated each other in the incredible things which
they related, the Chambre Ardente took fright. La Reynie, who presided over it, laid the matter
before the King, and the King, horror-stricken by the discovery of the revolting practices
in which the mother of his children had been engaged, suspended the sittings of the Chambre
Ardente, and commanded that no further proceedings should be taken against Lesage and La Filastre,
and none initiated against Romani, Bertrand, the Abbe Guibourg, and the scores of other poisoners
and magicians who had been arrested, and who were acquainted with Madame de Montespan's unholy
traffic.

But it was not out of any desire to spare Madame de Montespan that the King proceeded in this
manner; he was concerned only to spare himself and his royal dignity. He feared above all things
the scandal and ridicule which must touch him as a result of publicity, and because he feared
it so much, he could impose no punishment upon Madame de Montespan.

This he made known to her at the interview between them procured by his minister Louvois, at
about the time that the sittings of the Chambre Ardente were suspended.

To this interview that proud, domineering woman came in dread, and in tears and humility for
once. The King's bearing was cold and hard. Cold and hard were the words in which he declared
the extent of his knowledge of her infamy, words which revealed the loathing and disgust this
knowledge brought him. If at first she was terror-stricken, crushed under the indictment, yet
she was never of a temper to bear reproaches long. Under his scorn her anger kindled and her
humility was sloughed.

"What then?" she cried at last, eyes aflash through lingering tears. "Is the blame all mine?
If all this is true, it is no less true that I was driven to it by my love for you and the
despair to which your heartlessness and infidelity reduced me. To you," she continued, gathering
force at every word, "I sacrificed everything--my honour, a noble husband who loved me, all
that a woman prizes. And what did you give me in exchange? Your cruel fickleness exposed me
to the low mockery of the lick-spittles of your Court. Do you wonder that I went mad, and that
in my madness I sacrificed what shreds of self-respect you had left me? And now it seems I
have lost all but life. Take that, too, if it be your pleasure. Heaven knows it has little
value left for me! But remember that in striking me you strike the mother of your children--the
legitimate children of France. Remember that!"

He remembered it. Indeed, he was never in danger of forgetting it; for she might have added
that he would be striking also at himself and at that royal dignity which was his religion.
And so that all scandalous comment might be avoided she was actually allowed to remain at Court,
although no longer in her first-floor apartments; and it was not until ten years later that
she departed to withdraw to the community of Saint Joseph.

But even in her disgrace this woman, secretly convicted among other abominations of attempting
to procure the poisoning of the King and of her rival, enjoyed an annual pension of 1,200.000
livres; whilst none dared proceed against those who shared her guilt--not even the infamous
Guibourg, the poisoners Romani and Bertrand, and La Filastre--nor yet against some scores of
associates of these, who were known to live by sorcery and poisonings, and who might be privy
to the part played by Madame de Montespan in that horrible night of magic at the Chateau de
Villebousin.

The hot blast of revolution was needed to sweep France clean.

VII. THE NIGHT OF GEMS--The "Affairs" Of The Queen's Necklace

Under the stars of a tepid, scented night of August of 1784, Prince Louis de Rohan, Cardinal
of Strasbourg, Grand Almoner of France, made his way with quickened pulses through the Park
of Versailles to a momentous assignation in the Grove of Venus.

This illustrious member of an illustrious House, that derived from both the royal lines of
Valois and Bourbon, was a man in the prime of life, of a fine height, still retaining something
of the willowy slenderness that had been his in youth, and of a gentle, almost womanly beauty
of countenance.

In a grey cloak and a round, grey hat with gold cords, followed closely by two shadowy attendant
figures, he stepped briskly amain, eager to open those gates across the path of his ambition,
locked against him hitherto by the very hands from which he now went to receive the key.

He deserves your sympathy, this elegant Cardinal-Prince, who had been the victim of the malice
and schemings of the relentless Austrian Empress since the days when he represented the King
of France at the Court of Vienna.

The state he had kept there had been more than royal and royal in the dazzling French manner,
which was perturbing to a woman of Marie Therese's solid German notions. His hunting-parties,
his supper-parties, the fetes he gave upon every occasion, the worldly inventiveness, the sumptuousness
and reckless extravagance that made each of these affairs seem like a supplement to "The Arabian
Nights' Entertainments," the sybaritic luxury of his surroundings, the incredible prodigality
of his expenditure, all served profoundly to scandalize and embitter the Empress.

That a priest in gay, secular clothes should hunt the stag on horseback filled her with horror
at his levity; that he should flirt discreetly with the noble ladies of Vienna made her despair
of his morals; whilst his personal elegance and irresistible charm were proofs to her of a
profligacy that perverted the Court over which she ruled.

She laboured for the extinction of his pernicious brilliance, and intrigued for his recall.
She made no attempt to conceal her hostility, nor did she love him any the better because he
met her frigid haughtiness with an ironical urbanity that seemed ever to put her in the wrong.
And then one day he permitted his wit to be bitingly imprudent.

"Marie Therese," he wrote to D'Aiguillon, "holds in one hand a handkerchief to receive her
tears for the misfortunes of oppressed Poland, and in the other a sword to continue its partition."

To say that in this witticism lay one of the causes of the French Revolution may seem at first
glance an outrageous overstatement. Yet it is certain that, but for that imprudent phrase,
the need would never have arisen that sent Rohan across the Park of Versailles on that August
night to an assignation that in the sequel was to place a terrible weapon in the hands of the
Revolutionary party.

D'Aiguillon had published the gibe. It had reached the ears of Marie Antoinette, and from her
it had travelled back to her mother in Vienna. It aroused in the Empress a resentment and a
bitterness that did not rest until the splendid Cardinal-Prince was recalled from his embassy.
It did not rest even then. By the ridicule to which the gibe exposed her--and if you know Marie
Therese at all, you can imagine what that meant--it provoked a hostility that was indefatigably
to labour against him.

The Cardinal was ambitious, he had confidence in his talents and in the driving force of his
mighty family, and he looked to become another Richelieu or Mazarin, the first Minister of
the Crown, the empurpled ruler of France, the guiding power behind the throne. All this he
looked confidently to achieve; all this he might have achieved but for the obstacle that Marie
Therese's resentment flung across his path. The Empress saw to it that, through the person
of her daughter, her hatred should pursue him even into France.

Obedient ever to the iron will of her mother, sharing her mother's resentment, Marie Antoinette
exerted all her influence to thwart this Cardinal whom her mother had taught her to regard
as a dangerous, unprincipled man.

On his return from Vienna bearing letters from Marie Therese to Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette,
the Cardinal found himself coldly received by the dull King, and discouraged from remaining
at Court, whilst the Queen refused to grant him so much as the audience necessary for the delivery
of these letters, desiring him to forward them instead.

The chagrined Cardinal had no illusions. He beheld here the hand of Marie Therese controlling
Marie Antoinette, and, through Marie Antoinette, the King himself. Worse followed. He who had
dreamt himself another Richelieu could only with difficulty obtain the promised position of
Grand Almoner of France, and this solely as a result of the powerful and insistent influence
exerted by his family.

He perceived that if he was to succeed at all he must begin by softening the rigorous attitude
which the Queen maintained towards him. To that end he addressed himself. But three successive
letters he wrote to the Queen remained unanswered. Through other channels persistently he begged
for an audience that he might come in person to express his regrets for the offending indiscretion.
But the Queen remained unmoved, ruled ever by the Austrian Empress, who through her daughter
sought to guide the affairs of France.

Rohan was reduced to despair, and then in an evil hour his path was crossed by Jeanne de la
Motte de Valois, who enjoyed the reputation of secretly possessing the friendship of the Queen,
exerting a sort of back-stair influence, and who lived on that reputation.

As a drowning man clutches at a straw, so the Cardinal-Prince Louis de Rohan, Grand Almoner
of France, Landgrave of Alsace, Commander of the Order of the Holy Ghost, clutched at this
faiseuse d'affaires to help him in his desperate need.

Jeanne de la Motte de Valois--perhaps the most astounding adventuress that ever lived by her
wits and her beauty--had begun life by begging her bread in the streets. She laid claim to
left-handed descent from the royal line of Valois, and, her claim supported by the Marchioness
Boulainvilliers, who had befriended her, she had obtained from the Crown a small pension, and
had married the unscrupulous Marc Antoine de la Motte, a young soldier in the Burgundy regiment
of the Gendarmerie.

Later, in the autumn of 1786, her protectress presented her to Cardinal de Rohan. His Eminence,
interested in the lady's extraordinary history, in her remarkable beauty, vivacity, and wit,
received the De la Mottes at his sumptuous chateau at Saverne, near Strasbourg, heard her story
in greater detail, promised his protection, and as an earnest of his kindly intentions obtained
for her husband a captain's commission in the Dragoons.

Thereafter you see the De la Mottes in Paris and at Versailles, hustled from lodging to lodging
for failure to pay what they owe; and finally installed in a house in the Rue Neuve Saint-Gilles.
There they kept a sort of state, spending lavishly, now the money borrowed from the Cardinal,
or upon the Cardinal's security; now the proceeds of pawned goods that had been bought on credit,
and of other swindles practised upon those who were impressed by the lady's name and lineage
and the patronage of the great Cardinal which she enjoyed.

To live on your wits is no easy matter. It demands infinite address, coolness, daring, and
resource qualities which Madame de la Motte possessed in the highest degree, so that, harassed
and pressed by creditors, she yet contrived to evade their attacks and to present a calm and,
therefore, confidence-inspiring front to the world.

The truth of Madame de la Motte de Valois's reputation for influence at Court was never doubted.
There was nothing in the character of Marie Antoinette to occasion such doubts. Indiscreet
in many things, Her Majesty was most notoriously so in her attachments, as witness her intimacy
with Madame de Polignac and the Princesse de Lambelle. And the public voice had magnified--as
it will--those indiscretions until it had torn her character into shreds.

The fame of the Countess Jeanne de Valois--as Madame de la Motte now styled herself--increasing,
she was employed as an intermediary by place-seekers and people with suits to prefer, who gratefully
purchased her promises to interest herself on their behalf at Court.

And then into her web of intrigue blundered the Cardinal de Rohan, who, as he confessed, "was
completely blinded by his immense desire to regain the good graces of the Queen." She aroused
fresh hope in his despairing heart by protesting that, as some return for all the favours she
had received from him, she would not rest until she had disposed the Queen more favourably
towards him.

Later came assurances that the Queen's hostility was melting under her persuasions, and at
last she announced that she was authorized by Her Majesty to invite him to submit the justification
which so long and so vainly he had sought permission to present.

Rohan, in a vertigo of satisfaction, indited his justification, forwarded it to the Queen by
the hand of the Countess, and some days later received a note in the Queen's hand upon blue-edged
paper adorned by the lilies of France.

"I rejoice," wrote Marie Antoinette, "to find at last that you were not in fault. I cannot
yet grant you the audience you desire, but as soon as the circumstances allow of it I shall
let you know. Be discreet."

Upon the advice of the Countess of Valois, His Eminence sent a reply expressive of his deep
gratitude and joy.

Thus began a correspondence between Queen and Cardinal which continued regularly for a space
of three months, growing gradually more confidential and intimate. As time passed his solicitations
of an audience became more pressing, until at last the Queen wrote announcing that, actuated
by esteem and affection for him who had so long been kept in banishment, she herself desired
the meeting. But it must be secret. An open audience would still be premature; he had numerous
enemies at Court, who, thus forewarned, might so exert themselves against him as yet to ruin all.

To receive such a letter from a beautiful woman, and that woman a queen whose glories her inaccessibility
had magnified a thousandfold in his imagination, must have all but turned the Cardinal's head.
The secrecy of the correspondence, culminating in a clandestine meeting, seemed to establish
between them an intimacy impossible under other circumstances.

Into the warp of his ambition was now woven another, tenderly romantic, though infinitely respectful,
feeling.

You realize, I hope, the frame of mind in which the Cardinal-Prince took his way through that
luminous, fragrant summer night towards the Grove of Venus. He went to lay the cornerstone
of the proud edifice of his ambitions. To him it was a night of nights--a night of gems, he
pronounced it, looking up into the jewelled vault of heaven. And in that phrase he was singularly
prophetic.

By an avenue of boxwood and yoke-elm he entered into an open glade, in the middle of which
there was a circle where the intended statue of Venus was never placed. But if the cold marble
effigy of a goddess were absent, the warm, living figure of a queen stood, all in shimmering
white amid the gloom, awaiting him.

Rohan checked a moment, his breath arrested, his pulses quickened. Then he sped forward, and,
flinging off his wide-brimmed hat, he prostrated himself to kiss the hem of her white cambric
gown. Something--a rose that she let fall--brushed lightly past his cheek. Reverently he recovered
it, accounting it a tangible symbol of her favour, and he looked up into the proud, lovely
face--which, although but dimly discernible, was yet unmistakable to him protesting his gratitude
and devotion. He perceived that she was trembling, and caught the quiver in the voice that
answered him.

"You may hope that the past will be forgiven."

And then, before he could drink more deeply of this cup of delight, came rapid steps to interrupt
them. A slender man, in whom the Cardinal seemed to recognize the Queen's valet Desclaux, thrust
through the curtains of foliage into the grove.

"Quick, madame!" he exclaimed in agitation. "Madame la Comtesse and Mademoiselle d'Artois are
approaching!"

The Queen was whirled away, and the Cardinal discreetly effaced himself, his happiness tempered
by chagrin at the interruption.

When, on the morrow, the Countess of Valois brought him a blue-bordered note with Her Majesty's
wishes that he should patiently await a propitious season for his public restoration to royal
favour, he resigned himself with the most complete and satisfied submission. Had he not the
memory of her voice and the rose she had given him? Soon afterwards came a blue-bordered note
in which Marie Antoinette advised him to withdraw to his Bishopric of Strasbourg until she
should judge that the desired season of his reinstatement had arrived.

Obediently Rohan withdrew.

It was in the following December that the Countess of Valois's good offices at Court were solicited
by a new client, and that she first beheld the famous diamond necklace.

It had been made by the Court jewellers of the Rue Vendome--Bohmer and Bassenge--and intended
for the Countess du Barry. On the assembling of its component gems Bohmer had laboured for
five years and travelled all over Europe, with the result that he had achieved not so much
a necklace as a blazing scarf of diamonds of a splendour outrivalling any jewel that the world
had ever seen.

Unfortunately, Bohmer was too long over the task. Louis XV died inopportunely, and the firm
found itself with a necklace worth two million livres on its hands.

Hopes were founded upon Marie Antoinette's reputed extravagance. But the price appalled her,
while Louis XVI met the importunities of the jeweller with the reply that the country needed
a ship of war more urgently than a necklace.

Thereafter Bohmer offered it in various Courts of Europe, but always without success. Things
were becoming awkward. The firm had borrowed heavily to pay for the stones, and anxiety seems
to have driven Bohmer to the verge of desperation. Again he offered the necklace to the King,
announcing himself ready to make terms, and to accept payment in instalments; but again it
was refused.

Bohmer now became that pest to society, the man with a grievance that he must be venting everywhere.
On one occasion he so far forgot himself as to intrude upon the Queen as she was walking in
the gardens of the Trianon. Flinging himself upon his knees before her, he protested with sobs
that he was in despair, and that unless she purchased the necklace he would go and drown himself.
His tears left her unmoved to anything but scorn.

"Get up, Bohmer!" she bade him. "I don't like such scenes. I have refused the necklace, and
I don't want to hear of it again. Instead of drowning yourself, break it up and sell the diamonds
separately."

He did neither one nor the other, but continued to air his grievance; and among those who heard
him was one Laporte, an impecunious visitor at the house of the Countess of Valois.

Bohmer had said that he would pay a thousand louis to any one who found him a purchaser for
the necklace. That was enough to stir the needy Laporte. He mentioned the matter to the Countess,
and enlisted her interest. Then he told Bohmer of her great influence with the Queen, and brought
the jeweller to visit her with the necklace.

Dazzled by the fire of those gems, the Countess nevertheless protested--but in an arch manner
calculated to convince Bohmer of the contrary--that she had no power to influence Her Majesty.
Yet yielding with apparent reluctance to his importunities, she, nevertheless, ended by promising
to see what could be done.

On January 3d the Cardinal came back from Strasbourg. Correspondence with the Queen, through
Madame de Valois, had continued during his absence, and now, within a few days of his return,
an opportunity was to be afforded him of proving his readiness to serve Her Majesty, and of
placing her under a profound obligation to him.

The Countess brought him a letter from Marie Antoinette, in which the Queen expressed her desire
to acquire the necklace, but added that, being without the requisite funds at the moment, it
would be necessary to settle the terms and arrange the instalments, which should be paid at
intervals of three months. For this she required an intermediary who in himself would be a
sufficient guarantee to the Bohmers, and she ended by inviting His Eminence to act on her behalf.

That invitation the Cardinal, who had been waiting ever since the meeting in the Grove of Venus
for an opportunity of proving himself, accepted with alacrity.

And so, on January 24th, the Countess drives up to the Grand Balcon, the jewellers' shop in
the Rue Vendome. Her dark eyes sparkle, the lovely, piquant face is wreathed in smiles.

"Messieurs," she greets the anxious partners, "I think I can promise you that the necklace
will very shortly be sold."

The jewellers gasp in the immensity of the hope her words arouse.

"The purchase," she goes on to inform them, "will be effected by a very great nobleman."

Bassenge bursts into voluble gratitude. She cuts it short.

"That nobleman is the Cardinal-Prince Louis de Rohan. It is with him that you will arrange
the affair, and I advise you," she adds in a confidential tone, "to take every precaution,
especially in the matter of the terms of payment that may be proposed to you. That is all,
I think, messieurs. You will, of course, bear in mind that it is no concern of mine, and that
I do not so much as want my name mentioned in connection with it."

"Perfectly, madame," splutters Bohmer, who is perspiring, although the air is cold--"perfectly!
We understand, and we are profoundly grateful. If--" His hands fumble nervously at a case.
"If you would deign, madame, to accept this trifle as an earnest of our indebtedness, we--"

There is a tinge of haughtiness in her manner as she interrupts him.

"You do not appear to understand, Bohmer, that the matter does not at all concern me. I have
done nothing," she insists; then, melting into smiles, "My only desire," she adds, "was to
be of service to you."

And upon that she departs, leaving them profoundly impressed by her graciousness and still
more by her refusal to accept a valuable jewel.

On the morrow the great nobleman she had heralded, the Cardinal himself, alighted at the Grand
Balcon, coming, on the Queen's behalf, to see the necklace and settle the terms. By the end
of the week the bargain was concluded. The price was fixed at 1,600,000 livres, which the Queen
was to pay in four instalments extending over two years, the first falling due on the following
August 1st.

These terms the Cardinal embodied in a note which he forwarded to Madame de la Motte, that
they might be ratified by the Queen.

The Countess returned the note to him next day.

"Her Majesty is pleased and grateful," she announced, "and she approves of all that you have
done. But she does not wish to sign anything."

On that point, however, the Cardinal was insistent. The magnitude of the transaction demanded
it, and he positively refused to move further without Her Majesty's signature.

The Countess departed to return again on the last day of the month with the document completed
as the Cardinal required, bearing now the signature "Marie Antoinette de France," and the terms
marked "approved" in the Queen's hand.

"The Queen," Madame de la Motte informed him, "is making this purchase secretly, without the
King's knowledge, and she particularly begs that this note shall not leave Your Eminence's
hands. Do not, therefore, allow any one to see it."

Rohan gave the required promise, but, not conceiving that the Bohmers were included in it,
he showed them the note and the Queen's signature when they came to wait upon him with the
necklace on the morrow.

In the dusk of evening a closed carriage drew up at the door of Madame de la Motte Valois's
lodging on the Place Dauphine at Versailles. Rohan alighted, and went upstairs with a casket
under his arm.

Madame awaited him in a white-panelled, indifferently lighted room, to which there was an alcove
with glass doors.

"You have brought the necklace?"

"It is here," he replied, tapping the box with his gloved hand.

"Her Majesty is expecting it to-night. Her messenger should arrive at any moment. She will
be pleased with Your Eminence."

"That is all that I can desire," he answered gravely; and sat down in answer to her invitation,
the precious casket on his knees.

Waiting thus, they talked desultorily for some moments. At last came steps upon the stairs.

"Quick! The alcove!" she exclaimed. "You must not be seen by Her Majesty's messenger."

Rohan, with ready understanding, a miracle of discretion, effaced himself into the alcove,
through the glass doors of which he could see what passed.

The door was opened by madame's maid with the announcement:

"From the Queen."

A tall, slender young man in black, the Queen's attendant of that other night of gems--the
night of the Grove of Venus--stepped quickly into the room, bowed like a courtier to Madame
de la Motte, and presented a note.

Madame broke the seal, then begged the messenger to withdraw for a moment. When he had gone,
she turned to the Cardinal, who stood in the doorway of the alcove.

"That is Desclaux, Her Majesty's valet," she said; and held out to him the note, which requested
the delivery of the necklace to the bearer.

A moment later the messenger was reintroduced to receive the casket from the hands of Madame
de la Motte. Within five minutes the Cardinal was in his carriage again, driving happily back
to Paris with his dreams of a queen's gratitude and confidence.

Two days later, meeting Bohmer at Versailles, the Cardinal suggested to him that he should
offer his thanks to the Queen for having purchased the necklace.

Bohmer sought an opportunity for this in vain. None offered. It was also in vain that he waited
to hear that the Queen had worn the necklace. But he does not appear to have been anxious on
that score. Moreover, the Queen's abstention was credibly explained by Madame de la Motte to
Laporte with the statement that Her Majesty did not wish to wear the necklace until it was
paid for.

With the same explanation she answered the Cardinal's inquiries in the following July, when
he returned from a three months' sojourn in Strasbourg.

And she took the opportunity to represent to him that one of the reasons why the Queen could
not yet consider the necklace quite her own was that she found the price too high.

"Indeed, she may be constrained to return it, after all, unless the Bohmers are prepared to
be reasonable."

If His Eminence was a little dismayed by this, at least any nascent uneasiness was quieted.
He consented to see the jewellers in the matter, and on July 10th--three weeks before the first
instalment was due--he presented himself at the Grand Balcon to convey the Queen's wishes to
the Bohmers.

Bohmer scarcely troubled to prevent disgust from showing on his keen, swarthy countenance.
Had not his client been a queen and her intermediary a cardinal, he would, no doubt, have afforded
it full expression.

"The price agreed upon was already greatly below the value of the necklace," he grumbled. "I
should never have accepted it but for the difficulties under which we have been placed by the
purchase of the stones--the money we owe and the interest we are forced to pay. A further reduction
is impossible."

The handsome Cardinal was suave, courtly, regretful, but firm. Since that was the case, there
would be no alternative but to return the necklace.

Bohmer took fright. The annulment of the sale would bring him face to face with ruin. Reluctantly,
feeling that he was being imposed upon, he reduced the price by two hundred thousand livres,
and even consented to write the Queen the following letter, whose epistolary grace suggests
the Cardinal's dictation:

MADAME,--We are happy to hazard the thought that our submission with zeal and respect to the
last arrangement proposed constitutes a proof of our devotion and obedience to the orders of
Your Majesty. And we have genuine satisfaction in thinking that the most beautiful set of diamonds
in existence will serve to adorn the greatest and best of queens.

Now it happened that Bohmer was about to deliver personally to the Queen some jewels with which
the King was presenting her on the occasion of the baptism of his nephew. He availed himself
of that opportunity, two days later, personally to hand his letter to Her Majesty. But chance
brought the Comptroller-General into the room before she had opened it, and as a result the
jeweller departed while the letter was, still unread.

Afterwards, in the presence of Madame de Campan, who relates the matter in her memoirs, the
Queen opened the note, pored over it a while, and then, perhaps with vivid memories of Bohmer's
threat of suicide:

"Listen to what that madman Bohmer writes to me," she said, and read the lines aloud. "You
guessed the riddles in the 'Mercure' this morning. I wonder could you guess me this one."

And, with a half-contemptuous shrug, she held the sheet in the flame of one of the tapers that
stood alight on the table for the purpose of sealing letters.

"That man exists for my torment," she continued. "He has always some mad notion in his head,
and must always be visiting it upon me. When next you see him, pray convince him how little
I care for diamonds."

And there the matter was dismissed.

Days passed, and then a week before the instalment of 350,000 livres was due, the Cardinal
received a visit from Madame de la Motte on the Queen's behalf.

"Her Majesty," madame announced, "seems embarrassed about the instalment. She does not wish
to trouble you by writing about it. But I have thought of a way by which you could render yourself
agreeable to her and, at the same time, set her mind at rest. Could you not raise a loan for
the amount?"

Had not the Cardinal himself dictated to Bohmer a letter which Bohmer himself had delivered
to the Queen, he must inevitably have suspected by now that all was not as it should be. But,
satisfied as he was by that circumstance, he addressed himself to the matter which Madame de
la Motte proposed. But, although Rohan was extraordinarily wealthy, he had ever been correspondingly
lavish.

Moreover, to complicate matters, there had been the bankruptcy of his nephew, the Prince de
Guimenee, whose debts had amounted to some three million livres. Characteristically, and for
the sake of the family honour, Rohan had taken the whole of this burden upon his own shoulders.
Hence his resources were in a crippled condition, and it was beyond his power to advance so
considerable a sum at such short notice. Nor did he succeed in obtaining a loan within the
little time at his disposal.

His anxieties on this score were increased by a letter from the Queen which Madame de la Motte
brought him on July 30th, in which Her Majesty wrote that the first instalment could not be
paid until October 1st; but that on that date a payment of seven hundred thousand livres--half
of the revised price--would unfailingly be made. Together with this letter, Madame de la Motte
handed him thirty thousand livres, interest on the instalment due, with which to pacify the
jewellers.

But the jewellers were not so easily to be pacified. Bohmer, at the end of his patience, definitely
refused to grant the postponement or to receive the thirty thousand livres other than as on
account of the instalment due.

The Cardinal departed in vexation. Something must be done at once, or his secret relations
with the Queen would be disclosed, thus precipitating a catastrophe and a scandal. He summoned
Madame de la Motte, flung her into a panic with his news and sent her away to see what she
could do. What she actually did would have surprised him. Realizing that a crisis had been
reached calling for bold measures, she sent for Bassenge, the milder of the two partners. He
came to the Rue Neuve Saint-Gilles, protesting that he was being abused.

"Abused?" quoth she, taking him up on the word. "Abused, do you say?" She laughed sharply.
"Say duped, my friend; for that is what has happened to you. You are the victim of a swindle."

Bassenge turned white; his prominent eyes bulged in his rather pasty face.

"What are you saying, madame?" His voice was husky.

"The Queen's signature on the note in the Cardinal's possession is a forgery."

"A forgery! The Queen's signature? Oh, mon Dieu!" He stared at her, and his knees began to
tremble. "How do you know, madame?"

"I have seen it," she answered.

"But--but--"

His nerveless limbs succumbing under him, he sank without ceremony to a chair that was opportunely
near him. With the same lack of ceremony, mechanically, in a dazed manner, he mopped the sweat
that stood in beads on his brow, then raised his wig and mopped his head.

"There is no need to waste emotion," said she composedly. "The Cardinal de Rohan is very rich.
You must look to him. He will pay you."

"Will he?"

Hope and doubt were blended in the question.

"What else?" she asked. "Can you conceive that he will permit such a scandal to burst about
his name and the name of the Queen?"

Bassenge saw light. The rights and wrongs of the case, and who might be the guilty parties,
were matters of very secondary importance. What mattered was that the firm should recover the
14,000,000 livres for which the necklace had been sold; and Bassenge was quick to attach full
value to the words of Madame de la Motte.

Unfortunately for everybody concerned, including the jewellers themselves, Bohmer's mind was
less supple. Panic-stricken by Bassenge's report, he was all for the direct method. There was
no persuading him to proceed cautiously, and to begin by visiting the Cardinal. He tore away
to Versailles at once, intent upon seeing the Queen. But the Queen, as we know, had had enough
of Bohmer. He had to content himself with pouring his mixture of intercessions and demands
into the ears of Madame de Campan.

"You have been swindled, Bohmer," said the Queen's lady promptly. "Her Majesty never received
the necklace."

Bohmer would not be convinced. Disbelieving, and goaded to fury, he returned to Bassenge.

Bassenge, however, though perturbed, retained his calm. The Cardinal, he insisted, was their
security, and it was impossible to doubt that the Cardinal would fulfil his obligations at
all costs, rather than be overwhelmed by a scandal.

And this, no doubt, is what would have happened but for that hasty visit of Bohmer's to Versailles.
It ruined everything. As a result of it, Bohmer was summoned to wait instantly upon the Queen
in the mater of some paste buckles.

The Queen received the jeweller in private, and her greeting proved that the paste buckles
were a mere pretext. She demanded to know the meaning of his words to Madame de Campan.

Bohmer could not rid himself of the notion that he was being trifled with. Had he not written
and himself delivered to the Queen a letter in which he thanked her for purchasing the necklace,
and had not that letter remained unanswered--a silent admission that the necklace was in her
hands? In his exasperation he became insolent.

"The meaning, madame? The meaning is that I require payment for my necklace, that the patience
of my creditors is exhausted, and that unless you order the money to be paid, I am a ruined man!"

Marie Antoinette considered him in cold, imperious anger.

"Are you daring to suggest that your necklace is in my possession?"

Bohmer was white to the lips, his hands worked nervously.

"Does Your Majesty deny it?"

"You are insolent!" she exclaimed. "You will be good enough to answer questions, not to ask
them. Answer me, then. Do you suggest that I have your necklace?"

But a desperate man is not easily intimidated.

"No, madame; I affirm it! It was the Countess of Valois who--"

"Who is the Countess of Valois?"

That sudden question, sharply uttered, was a sword of doubt through the heart of Bohmer's confidence.
He stared wide-eyed a moment at the indignant lady before him, then collected himself, and
made as plain a tale as he could of the circumstances under which he had parted with the necklace
Madame de la Motte's intervention, the mediation of the Cardinal de Rohan with Her Majesty's
signed approval of the terms, and the delivery of the necklace to His Eminence for transmission
to the Queen.

Marie Antoinette listened in increasing horror and anger. A flush crept into her pale cheeks.

"You will prepare and send me a written statement of what you have just told me," she said.
"You have leave to go."

That interview took place on August 9th. The 15th was the Feast of the Assumption, and also
the name-day of the Queen, therefore a gala day at Court, bringing a concourse of nobility
to Versailles. Mass was to be celebrated in the royal chapel at ten o'clock, and the celebrant,
as by custom established for the occasion, was the Grand Almoner of France, the Cardinal de Rohan.

But at ten o'clock a meeting was being held in the King's cabinet, composed of the King and
Queen, the Baron de Breteuil, and the Keeper of the Seals, Miromesnil. They were met, as they
believed, to decide upon a course of action in the matter of a diamond necklace. In reality,
these puppets in the hands of destiny were helping to decide the fate of the French monarchy.

The King, fat, heavy, and phlegmatic, sat in a gilded chair by an ormolu-encrusted writing-table.
His bovine eyes were troubled. Two wrinkles of vexation puckered the flesh above his great
nose. Beside, and slightly behind him, stood the Queen, white and imperious, whilst facing
them stood Monsieur de Breteuil, reading aloud the statement which Bohmer had drawn up.

When he had done, there was a moment's utter silence. Then the King spoke, his voice almost
plaintive.

"What is to be done, then? But what is to be done?"

It was the Queen who answered him, harshly and angrily.

"When the Roman purple and a princely title are but masks to cover a swindler, there is only
one thing to be done. This swindler must be exposed and punished."

"But," the King faltered, "we have not heard the Cardinal."

"Can you think that Bohmer, that any man, would dare to lie upon such a matter?"

"But consider, madame, the Cardinal's rank and family," calmly interposed the prudent Miromesnil;
"consider the stir, the scandal that must ensue if this matter is made public."

But the obedient daughter of Marie Therese, hating Rohan at her mother's bidding and for her
mother's sake, was impatient of any such wise considerations.

"What shall the scandal signify to us?" she demanded. The King looked at Breteuil.

"And you, Baron? What is your view?"

Breteuil, Rohan's mortal enemy, raised his shoulders and flipped the document.

"In the face of this, Sire, it seems to me that the only course is to arrest the Cardinal."

"You believe, then--" began the King, and checked, leaving the sentence unfinished.

But Breteuil had understood.

"I know that the Cardinal must be pressed for money," he said. "Ever prodigal in his expenditure,
he is further saddled with the debts of the Prince de Guimenee."

"And you can believe," the King cried, "that a Prince of the House of Rohan, however pressed
for money, could--Oh, it is unimaginable!"

"Yet has he not stolen my name?" the Queen cut in. "Is he not proven a common, stupid forger?"

"We have not heard him," the King reminded her gently.

"And His Eminence might be able to explain," ventured Miromesnil. "It were certainly prudent
to give him the opportunity."

Slowly the King nodded his great, powdered head. "Go and find him. Bring him at once!" he bade
Breteuil; and Breteuil bowed and departed.

Very soon he returned, and he held the door whilst the handsome Cardinal, little dreaming what
lay before him, serene and calm, a commanding figure in his cassock of scarlet watered silk,
rustled forward into the royal presence, and so came face to face with the Queen for the first
time since that romantic night a year ago in the Grove of Venus.

Abruptly the King launched his thunderbolt.

"Cousin," he asked, "what purchase is this of a diamond necklace that you are said to have
made in the Queen's name?"

King and Cardinal looked into each other's eyes, the King's narrowing, the Cardinal's dilating,
the King leaning forward in his chair, elbows on the table, the Cardinal standing tense and
suddenly rigid.

Slowly the colour ebbed from Rohan's face, leaving it deathly pale. His eyes sought the Queen,
and found her contemptuous glance, her curling lip. Then at last his handsome head sank a little
forward.

"Sire," he said unsteadily, "I see that I have been duped. But I have duped nobody."

"You have no reason to be troubled, then. You need but to explain."

Explain! That was precisely what he could not do. Besides, what was the nature of the explanation
demanded of him? Whilst he stood stricken there, it was the Queen who solved this question.

"If, indeed, you have been duped," she said scornfully, her colour high, her eyes like points
of steel, "you have been self-duped. But even then it is beyond belief that self-deception
could have urged you to the lengths of passing yourself off as my intermediary--you, who should
know yourself to be the last man in France I should employ, you to whom I have not spoken once
in eight years." Tears of anger glistened in her eyes; her voice shrilled up. "And yet, since
you have not denied it, since you put forward this pitiful plea that you have been duped, we
must believe the unbelievable."

Thus at a blow she shattered the fond hopes he had been cherishing ever since the night of
gems--of gems, forsooth!--in the Grove of Venus; thus she laid his ambition in ruins about
him, and left the man himself half stunned.

Observing his disorder, the ponderous but kindly monarch rose.

"Come, my cousin," he said more gently, "collect yourself. Sit down here and write what you
may have to say in answer."

And with that he passed into the library beyond, accompanied by the Queen and the two Ministers.

Alone, Rohan staggered forward and sank nervelessly into the chair. He took up a pen, pondered
a moment, and began to write. But he did not yet see clear. He could not yet grasp the extent
to which he had been deceived, could not yet believe that those treasured notes from Marie
Antoinette were forgeries, that it was not the Queen who had met him in the Grove of Venus
and given him the rose whose faded petals kept those letters company in a portfolio of red
morocco. But at least it was clear to him that, for the sake of honour--the Queen's honour--he
must assume it so; and in that assumption he now penned his statement.

When it was completed, himself he bore it to the King in the library.

Louis read it with frowning brows; then passed it to the Queen.

"Have you the necklace now?" he asked Rohan.

"Sir, I left it in the hands of this woman Valois."

"Where is this woman?"

"I do not know, Sire."

"And the letter of authority bearing the Queen's signature, which the jewellers say you presented
to them--where is that?"

"I have it, Sire. I will place it before you. It is only now that I realize that it is a forgery."

"Only now!" exclaimed the Queen in scorn.

"Her Majesty's name has been compromised," said the King sternly. "It must be cleared. As King
and as husband my duty is clear. Your Eminence must submit to arrest."

Rohan fell back a step in stupefaction. For disgrace and dismissal he was prepared, but not
for this.

"Arrest?" he whispered. "Ah, wait, Sire. The publicity! The scandal! Think of that! As for
the necklace, I will pay for it myself, and so pay for my credulous folly. I beseech you, Sire,
to let the matter end here. I implore it for my own sake, for the sake of the Prince de Soubise
and the name of Rohan, which would be smirched unjustly and to no good purpose."

He spoke with warmth and force; and, without adding more, yet conveyed an impression that much
more could be said for the course he urged.

The King hesitated, considering. Noting this, the prudent, far-seeing Miromesnil ventured to
develop the arguments at which Rohan had hinted, laying stress upon the desirability of avoiding
scandal.

Louis was nodding, convinced, when Marie Antoinette, unable longer to contain her rancour,
broke into opposition of those prudent measures.

"This hideous affair must be disclosed," she insisted. "It is due to me that it should publicly
be set right. The Cardinal shall tell the world how he came to suppose that, not having spoken
to him for eight years, I could have wished to make use of his services in the purchase of
this necklace."

She was in tears, and her weak, easily swayed husband accounted her justified in her demand.
And so, to the great consternation of all the world, Prince Louis de Rohan was arrested like
a common thief.

A foolish, indiscreet, short-sighted woman had allowed her rancour to override all other considerations--careless
of consequences, careless of injustice so that her resentment, glutted by her hatred of the
Cardinal, should be gratified. The ungenerous act was terribly to recoil upon her. In tears
and blood was she to expiate her lack of charity; very soon she was to reap its bitter fruits.

Saint-Just, a very prominent counsellor of the Parliament, one of the most advanced apostles
of the new ideas that were to find full fruition in the Revolution, expressed the popular feeling
in the matter.

"Great and joyful affair! A cardinal and a queen implicated in a forgery and a swindle! Filth
on the crosier and the sceptre! What a triumph for the ideas of liberty!"

At the trial that followed before Parliament, Madame de la Motte, a man named Reteaux de Villette--who
had forged the Queen's hand and impersonated Desclaux and a Mademoiselle d'Oliva--who had used
her striking resemblance to Marie Antoinette to impersonate the Queen in the Grove of Venus
were found guilty and sentenced. But the necklace was not recovered. It had been broken up,
and some of the diamonds were already sold; others were being sold in London by Captain de
la Motte, who had gone thither for the purpose, and who prudently remained there.

The Cardinal was acquitted, amid intense public joy and acclamation, which must have been gall
and wormwood to the Queen. His powerful family, the clergy of France, and the very people,
with whom he had ever been popular, had all laboured strenuously to vindicate him. And thus
it befell that the one man the Queen had aimed at crushing was the only person connected with
the affair who came out of it unhurt. The Queen's animus against the Cardinal aroused against
her the animus of his friends of all classes. Appalling libels of her were circulated throughout
Europe. It was thought and argued that she was more deeply implicated in the swindle than had
transpired, that Madame de la Motte was a scapegoat, that the Queen should have stood her trial
with the others, and that she was saved only by the royalty that hedged her.

Conceive what a weapon this placed in the hands of the men of the new ideas of liberty--men
who were bent on proving the corruption of a system they sought to destroy!

Marie Antoinette should have foreseen something of this. She might have done so had not her
hatred blinded her, had she been less intent upon seizing the opportunity at all costs to make
Rohan pay for his barbed witticism upon her mother. She might have been spared much had she
but spared Rohan when the chance was hers. As it was, the malevolent echoes of the affair and
of Saint-Just's exultation were never out of her ears. They followed her to her trial eight
years later before the revolutionary tribunal. They followed her to the very scaffold, of which
they had undoubtedly supplied a plank.

VIII, THE NIGHT OF TERROR--The Drownings At Nantes Under Carrier

The Revolutionary Committee of the city of Nantes, reinforced by some of the administrators
of the district and a few members of the People's Society, sat in the noble hall of the Cour
des Comptes, which still retained much of its pre-republican sumptuousness. They sat expectantly--Goullin,
the attorney, president of the committee, a frail, elegant valetudinarian, fierily eloquent;
Grandmaison, the fencing-master, who once had been a gentleman, fierce of eye and inflamed
of countenance; Minee, the sometime bishop, now departmental president; Pierre Chaux, the bankrupt
merchant; the sans-culotte Forget, of the People's Society, an unclean, ill-kempt ruffian;
and some thirty others called like these from every walk of life.

Lamps were lighted, and under their yellow glare the huddled company--for the month was December,
and the air of the vast room was chill and dank--looked anxious and ill at ease.

Suddenly the doors were thrown open by an usher; and his voice rang loud in announcement--

"The Citizen Representative Carrier."

The great man came in, stepping quickly. Of middle height, very frail and delicate, his clay-colored
face was long and thin, with arched eyebrows, a high nose, and a loose, coarse mouth. His deeply
sunken dark eyes glared fiercely, and wisps of dead-black hair, which had escaped the confining
ribbon of his queue, hung about his livid brow. He was wrapped in a riding-coat of bottle-green,
heavily lined with fur, the skirts reaching down to the tops of his Hessian boots, and the
enormous turned-up collar almost touching the brim of his round hat. Under the coat his waist
was girt with the tricolour of office, and there were gold rings in his ears.

Such at the age of five-and-thirty was Jean Baptiste Carrier, Representative of the Convention
with the Army of the West, the attorney who once had been intended by devout parents for the
priesthood. He had been a month in Nantes, sent thither to purge the body politic.

He reached a chair placed in the focus of the gathering, which sat in a semicircle. Standing
by it, one of his lean hands resting upon the back, he surveyed them, disgust in his glance,
a sneer curling his lip, so terrible and brutal of aspect despite his frailness that more than
one of those stout fellows quailed now before him.

Suddenly he broke into torrential speech, his voice shrill and harsh:

"I do not know by what fatality it happens, but happen it does, that during the month that
I have been in Nantes you have never ceased to give me reason to complain of you. I have summoned
you to meet me here that you may justify yourselves, if you can, for your ineptitude!" And
he flung himself into the chair, drawing his fur-lined coat about him. "Let me hear from you!"
he snapped.

Minee, the unfrocked bishop, preserving still a certain episcopal portliness of figure, a certain
episcopal oiliness of speech, respectfully implored the representative to be more precise.

The invitation flung him into a passion. His irascibility, indeed, deserved to become a byword.

"Name of a name!" he shrilled, his sunken eyes ablaze, his face convulsed. "Is there a thing
I can mention in this filthy city of yours that is not wrong? Everything is wrong! You have
failed in your duty to provide adequately for the army of Vendee. Angers has fallen, and now
the brigands are threatening Nantes itself. There is abject want in the city, disease is rampant;
people are dying of hunger in the streets and of typhus in the prisons. And sacre nom!--you
ask me to be precise! I'll be precise in telling you where lies the fault. It lies in your
lousy administration. Do you call yourselves administrators? You--" He became unprintable.
"I have come here to shake you out of your torpor, and by--I'll shake you out of it or I'll
have the blasted heads off the lot of you."

They shivered with chill fear under the wild glare of his sunken eyes.

"Well?" he barked after a long pause. "Are you all dumb as well as idiots?"

It was the ruffian Forget who had the courage to answer him:

"I have told the People's Society that if the machine works badly it is because the Citizen
Carrier refuses to consult with the administration."

"You told them that, did you, you--liar?" screeched Carrier. "Am I not here now to consult
with you? And should I not have come before had you suggested it? Instead, you have waited
until, of my own accord, I should come to tell you that your administration is ruining Nantes."

Goullin, the eloquent and elegant Goullin, rose to soothe him:

"Citizen Representative, we admit the truth of all that you have said. There has been a misunderstanding.
We could not take it upon ourselves to summon the august representative of the Sacred People.
I We have awaited your own good pleasure, and now that you have made this manifest, there is
no reason why the machine should not work effectively. The evils of which you speak exist,
alas! But they are not so deeply rooted that, working under your guidance and advice, we cannot
uproot them, rendering the soil fertile once more of good under the beneficent fertilizing
showers of liberty."

Mollified, Carrier grunted approval.

"That is well said, Citizen Goullin. The fertilizer needed by the soil is blood--the bad blood
of aristocrats and federalists, and I can promise you, in the name of the august people, that
it shall be abundantly provided."

The assembly broke into applause, and his vanity melted to it. He stood up, expressed his gratification
at being so completely understood, opened his arms, and invited the departmental president,
Minee, to come down and receive the kiss of brotherhood.

Thereafter they passed to the consideration of measures of improvement, of measures to combat
famine and disease. In Carrier's view there was only one way of accomplishing this--the number
of mouths to be fed must be reduced, the diseased must be eliminated. It was the direct, the
radical, the heroic method.

That very day six prisoners in Le Bouffay had been sentenced to death for attempting to escape.

"How do we know," he asked, "that those six include all the guilty? How do we know that all
in Le Bouffay do not share the guilt? The prisoners are riddled with disease, which spreads
to the good patriots of Nantes; they eat bread, which is scarce, whilst good patriots starve.
We must have the heads off all those blasted swine!" He took fire at his own suggestion. "Aye,
that would be a useful measure. We'll deal with it at once. Let some one fetch the President
of the Revolutionary Tribunal."

He was fetched--a man of good family and a lawyer, named Francois Phelippes.

"Citizen President," Carrier greeted him, "the administration of Nantes has been considering
an important measure. To-day you sentenced to death six prisoners in Le Bouffay for attempting
to escape. You are to postpone execution so as to include all the Bouffay prisoners in the
sentence."

Although an ardent revolutionary, Phelippes was a logically minded man with a lawyer's reverence
for the sacredness of legal form. This command, issued with such cynical coldness, and repudiated
by none of those present, seemed to him as grotesque and ridiculous as it was horrible.

"But that is impossible, Citizen Representative," said he.

"Impossible!" snarled Carrier. "A fool's word. The administration desires you to understand
that it is not impossible. The sacred will of the august people--"

Phelippes interrupted him without ceremony.

"There is no power in France that can countermand the execution of a sentence of the law."

"No--no power!"

Carrier's loose mouth fell open. He was too amazed to be angry.

"Moreover," Phelippes pursued calmly, "there is the fact that all the other prisoners in Le
Bouffay are innocent of the offence for which the six are to die."

"What has that to do with it?" roared Carrier. "Last year I rode a she-ass that could argue
better than you! In the name of--, what has that to do with it?"

But there were members of the assembly who thought with Phelippes, and who, whilst lacking
the courage to express themselves, yet found courage to support another who so boldly expressed
them.

Carrier sprang up quivering with rage before that opposition. "It seems to me," he snarled,
"that there are more than the scoundrels in Le Bouffay who need to be shortened by a head for
the good of the nation. I tell you that you are slaying the commonweal by your slowness and
circumspection. Let all the scoundrels perish!"

A handsome, vicious youngster named Robin made chorus.

"Patriots are without bread! It is fitting that the scoundrels should die, and not eat the
bread of starving patriots."

Carrier shook his fist at the assembly.

"You hear, you--! I cannot pardon whom the law condemns."

It was an unfortunate word, and Phelippes fastened on it.

"That is the truth, Citizen Representative," said Phelippes. "And as for the prisoners in Le
Bouffay, you will wait until the law condemns them."

And without staying to hear more, he departed as firmly as he had come, indifferent to the
sudden uproar.

When he had gone, the Representative flung himself into his chair again, biting his lip.

"There goes a fellow who will find his way to the guillotine in time," he growled.

But he was glad to be rid of him, and would not have him brought back. He saw how the opposition
of Phelippes had stiffened the weaker opposition of some of those in the assembly. If he was
to have his way he would contrive better without the legal-minded President of the Revolutionary
Tribunal. And his way he had in the end, though not until he had stormed and cursed and reviled
the few who dared to offer remonstrances to his plan of wholesale slaughter.

When at last he took his departure, it was agreed that the assembly should proceed to elect
a jury which was to undertake the duty of drawing up immediately a list of those confined in
the prisons of Nantes. This list they were to deliver when ready to the committee, which would
know how to proceed, for Carrier had made his meaning perfectly clear. The first salutary measure
necessary to combat the evils besetting the city was to wipe out at once the inmates of all
the prisons in Nantes.

In the chill December dawn of the next day the committee--which had sat all night under the
presidency of Goullin forwarded a list of some five hundred prisoners to General Boivin, the
commandant of the city of Nantes, together with an order to collect them without a moment's
delay, take them to L'Eperonniere, and there have them shot.

But Boivin was a soldier, and a soldier is not a sans-culotte. He took the order to Phelippes,
with the announcement that he had no intention of obeying it. Phelippes, to Boivin's amazement,
agreed with him. He sent the order back to the committee, denouncing it as flagrantly illegal,
and reminding them that it was illegal to remove any prisoner, no matter by whose order, without
such an order as might follow upon a decision of the Tribunal.

The committee, intimidated by this firmness on the part of the President of the Revolutionary
Tribunal, dared not insist, and there the matter remained.

When Carrier learnt of it the things he said were less than ever fit for publication. He raved
like a madman at the very thought that a quibbling lawyer should stand in the very path of
him, the august representative of the Sacred People.

It had happened that fifty-three priests, who had been brought to Nantes a few days before,
were waiting in the sheds of the entrepot for prison accommodation, so that their names did
not yet appear upon any of the prison registers. As a solatium to his wounded feelings, he
ordered his friends of the Marat Company to get rid of them.

Lamberty, the leader of the Marats, asked him how it should be done.

"How?" he croaked. "Not so much mystery, my friend. Fling the swine into the water, and so
let's be rid of them. There will be plenty of their kind left in France."

But he seems to have explained himself further, and what precisely were his orders, and how
they were obeyed, transpires from a letter which he wrote to the Convention, stating that those
fifty-three wretched priests, "being confined in a boat on the Loire, were last night swallowed
up by the river." And he added the apostrophe, "What a revolutionary torrent is the Loire!"

The Convention had no illusions as to his real meaning; and when Carrier heard that his letter
had been applauded by the National Assembly, he felt himself encouraged to break down all barriers
of mere legality that might obstruct his path. And, after all, what the Revolutionary Committee
as a body--intimidated by Phelippes--dared not do could be done by his faithful and less punctilious
friends of the Marat Company.

This Marat Company, the police of the Revolutionary Committee, enrolled from the scourings
of Nantes' sans-culottism, and captained by a ruffian named Fleury, had been called into being
by Carrier himself with the assistance of Goullin.

On the night of the 24th Frimaire of the year III (December 14, 1793, old style), which was
a Saturday, Fleury mustered some thirty of his men, and took them to the Cour des Comptes,
where they were awaited by Goullin, Bachelier, Grandmaison, and some other members of the committee
entirely devoted to Carrier. From these the Marats received their formal instructions.

"Plague," Goullin informed them, "is raging in the gaols, and its ravages must be arrested.
You will therefore proceed this evening to the prison of Le Bouffay in order to take over the
prisoners whom you will march up to the Quay La Fosse, whence they will be shipped to Belle Isle."

In a cell of that sordid old building known as Le Bouffay lay a cocassier, an egg and poultry
dealer, arrested some three years before upon a charge of having stolen a horse, and since
forgotten. His own version was that a person of whom he knew very little had entrusted him
with the sale of the stolen animal in possession of which he was discovered.

The story sounds familiar; it is the sort of story that must have done duty many times; and
it is probable that the cocassier was no better than he should have been. Nevertheless Fate
selected him to be one of her unconscious instruments. His name was Leroy, and we have his
own word for it that he was a staunch patriot. The horse business was certainly in the best
vein of sans-culottism.

Leroy was awakened about ten o'clock that night by sounds that were very unusual in that sombre,
sepulchral prison. They were sounds of unbridled revelry--snatches of ribald song, bursts of
coarse, reverberating laughter and they proceeded, as it seemed to him, from the courtyard
and the porter's lodge.

He crawled from the dank straw which served him for a bed, and approached the door to listen.
Clearly the porter Laqueze was entertaining friends and making unusually merry. It was also
to be gathered that Laqueze's friends were getting very drunk. What the devil did it mean?

His curiosity was soon to be very fully gratified. Came heavy steps up the stone staircase,
the clatter of sabots, the clank of weapons, and through the grille of his door an increasing
light began to beat.

Some one was singing the "Carmagnole" in drunken, discordant tones. Keys rattled, bolts were
drawn; doors were being flung open. The noise increased. Above the general din he heard the
detestable voice of the turnkey.

"Come and see my birds in their cages. Come and see my pretty birds."

Leroy began to have an uneasy premonition that the merrymaking portended sinister things.

"Get up, all of you!" bawled the turnkey. "Up and pack your traps. You're to go on a voyage.
No laggards, now. Up with you!"

The door of Leroy's cell was thrown open in its turn, and he found himself confronting a group
of drunken ruffians. One of these--a red-capped giant with long, black mustaches and a bundle
of ropes over one arm suddenly pounced upon him. The cocassier was an active, vigorous young
man. But, actuated by fear and discretion, he permitted himself tamely to be led away.

Along the stone-flagged corridor he went, and on every hand beheld his fellow-prisoners in
the same plight, being similarly dragged from their cells and similarly hurried below. At the
head of the stairs one fellow, perfectly drunk, was holding a list, hiccupping over names which
he garbled ludicrously as he called them out. He was lighted in his task by a candle held by
another who was no less drunk. The swaying pair seemed to inter-support one another grotesquely.

Leroy suffered himself to be led down the stairs, and so came to the porter's lodge, where
he beheld a half-dozen Marats assembled round a table, with bumpers of wine before them, bawling,
singing, cursing, and cracking lewd jests at the expense of each prisoner as he entered. The
place was in a litter. A lamp had been smashed, and there was a puddle of wine on the floor
from a bottle that had been knocked over. On a bench against the wall were ranged a number
of prisoners, others lay huddled on the floor, and all of them were pinioned.

Two or three of the Marats lurched up to Leroy, and ran their hands over him, turning out his
pockets, and cursing him foully for their emptiness. He saw the same office performed upon
others, and saw them stripped of money, pocket-books, watches, rings, buckles, and whatever
else of value they happened to possess. One man, a priest, was even deprived of his shoes by
a ruffian who was in want of foot-gear.

As they were pinioning his wrists, Leroy looked up. He confesses that he was scared.

"What is this for?" he asked. "Does it mean death?"

With an oath he was bidden to ask no questions.

"If I die," he assured them, "you will be killing a good republican."

A tall man with an inflamed countenance and fierce, black eyes, that were somewhat vitreous,
now leered down upon him.

"You babbling fool! It's not your life, it's your property we want."

This was Grandmaison, the fencing-master, who once had been a gentleman. He had been supping
with Carrier, and he had only just arrived at Le Bouffay, accompanied by Goullin. He found
the work behind time, and told them so.

"Leave that fellow now, Jolly. He's fast enough. Up and fetch the rest. It's time to be going...
time to be going."

Flung aside now that he was pinioned, Leroy sat down on the floor and looked about him. Near
him an elderly man was begging for a cup of water. They greeted the prayer with jeering laughter.

"Water! By Sainte Guillotine, he asks for water!" The drunken sans-culottes were intensely
amused. "Patience, my friend--patience, and you shall drink your fill. You shall drink from
the great cup."

Soon the porter's lodge was crowded with prisoners, and they were overflowing into the passage.

Came Grandmaison cursing and swearing at the sluggishness of the Marats, reminding them--as
he had been reminding them for the last hour--that it was time to be off, that the tide was
on the ebb.

Stimulated by him, Jolly--the red-capped giant with the black mustaches--and some others of
the Marat Company, set themselves to tie the prisoners into chains of twenty, further to ensure
against possible evasion. They were driven into the chilly courtyard, and there Grandmaison,
followed by a fellow with a lantern, passed along the ranks counting them.

The result infuriated him.

"A hundred and five!" he roared, and swore horribly. "You have been here nearly five hours,
and in all that time you have managed to truss up only a hundred and five. Are we never to
get through with it? I tell you the tide is ebbing. It is time to be off."

Laqueze, the porter of Le Bouffay, with whose food and wine those myrmidons of the committee
had made so disgracefully free, came to assure him that he had all who were in the prison.

"All?" cried Grandmaison, aghast. "But according to the list there should have been nearer
two hundred." And he raised his voice to call: "Goullin! Hola, Goullin! Where the devil is
Goullin?"

"The list," Laqueze told him, "was drawn up from the register. But you have not noted that
many have died since they came--we have had the fever here--and that a few are now in hospital."

"In hospital! Bah! Go up, some of you, and fetch them. We are taking them somewhere where they
will be cured." And then he hailed the elegant Goullin, who came up wrapped in a cloak. "Here's
a fine bathing-party!" he grumbled. "A rare hundred of these swine!"

Goullin turned to Laqueze.

"What have you done with the fifteen brigands I sent you this evening?"

"But they only reached Nantes to-day," said Laqueze, who understood nothing of these extraordinary
proceedings. "They have not yet been registered, not even examined."

"I asked you what you have done with them?" snapped Goullin.

"They are upstairs."

"Then fetch them. They are as good as any others."

With these, and a dozen or so dragged from sick-beds, the total was made up to about a hundred
and thirty.

The Marats, further reinforced now by half a company of National Guards, set out from the prison
towards five o'clock in the morning; urging their victims along with blows and curses.

Our cocassier found himself bound wrist to wrist with a young Capuchin brother, who stumbled
along in patient resignation, his head bowed, his lips moving as if he were in prayer.

"Can you guess what they are going to do with us?" murmured Leroy.

He caught the faint gleam of the Capuchin's eyes in the gloom.

"I do not know, brother. Commend yourself to God, and so be prepared for whatever may befall."

The answer was not very comforting to a man of Leroy's temperament. He stumbled on, and they
came now upon the Place du Bouffay, where the red guillotine loomed in ghostly outline, and
headed towards the Quai Tourville. Thence they were marched by the river the whole length of
the Quai La Fosse. Fear spreading amongst them, some clamours were raised, to be instantly
silenced by blows and assurances that they were to be shipped to Belle Isle, where they were
to be set to work to build a fort.

The cocassier thought this likely enough, and found it more comforting than saying his prayers--a
trick which he had long since lost.

As they defiled along the quays, an occasional window was thrown up, and an inquisitive head
protruded, to be almost instantly withdrawn again.

On the Cale Robin at last they were herded into a shed which opened on to the water. Here they
found a large lighter alongside, and they beheld in the lantern-light the silhouettes of a
half-dozen shipwrights busily at work upon it, whilst the place rang with the blows of hammers
and the scream of saws.

Some of those nearest the barge saw what was being done. Two great ports were being opened
in the vessel's side, and over one of these thus opened the shipwrights were nailing planks.
They observed that these ports, which remained above the water-line now that the barge was
empty, would be well below it once she were laden, and conceiving that they perceived at last
the inhuman fate awaiting them, their terror rose again. They remembered snatches of conversation
and grim jests uttered by the Marats in Le Bouffay, which suddenly became clear, and the alarm
spreading amongst them, they writhed and clamoured, screamed for mercy, cursed and raved.

Blows were showered upon them. In vain was it sought to quiet them again with that fable of
a fort to be constructed on Belle Isle. One of them in a frenzy of despair tore himself free
of his bonds, profited by a moment of confusion, and vanished so thoroughly that Grandmaison
and his men lost a quarter of an hour seeking him in vain, and would have so spent the remainder
of the night but for a sharp word from a man in a greatcoat and a round hat who stood looking
on in conversation with Goullin.

"Get on, man! Never mind that one! We'll have him later. It will be daylight soon. You've wasted
time enough already."

It was Carrier.

He had come in person to see the execution of his orders, and at his command Grandmaison now
proceeded to the loading. A ladder was set against the side of the lighter by which the prisoners
were to descend. The cords binding them in chains were now severed, and they were left pinioned
only by the wrists. They were ordered to embark. But as they were slow to obey, and as some,
indeed, hung back wailing and interceding, he and Jolly took them by their collars, thrust
them to the edge, and bundled them neck and crop down into the hold, recking nothing of broken
limbs. Finding this method of embarkation more expeditious, the use of the ladder was neglected
thenceforth.

Among the last to be thus flung aboard was our cocassier Leroy. He fell soft upon a heaving,
writhing mass of humanity, which only gradually shook down and sorted itself out on the bottom
of the lighter when the hatches overhead were being nailed down. Yet by an odd chance the young
Capuchin and Leroy, who had been companions in the chain, were not separated even now. Amid
the human welter in that agitated place of darkness, the cries and wails that rang around him,
Leroy recognized the voice of the young friar exhorting them to prayer.

They were in the stern of the vessel, against one of the sides, and Leroy, who still kept a
grip on the wits by which he had lived, bade the Capuchin hold up his wrists. Then he went
nosing like a dog, until at last he found them, and his strong teeth fastened upon the cord
that bound them, and began with infinite patience to gnaw it through.

Meanwhile that floating coffin had left its moorings and was gliding with the stream. On the
hatches sat Grandmaison, with Jolly and two other Marats, howling the "Carmagnole" to drown
the cries of the wretches underneath, and beating time with their feet upon the deck.

Leroy's teeth worked on like a rat's until at last the cord was severed. Then, lest they should
be parted in the general heaving and shifting of that human mass, those teeth of his fastened
upon the Capuchin's sleeve.

"Take hold of me!" he commanded as distinctly as he could; and the Capuchin gratefully obeyed.
"Now untie my wrists!"

The Capuchin's hands slid along Leroy's arms until they found his hands, and there his fingers
grew busy, groping at the knots. It was no easy matter to untie them in the dark, guided by
sense of touch alone. But the friar was persistent and patient, and in the end the last knot
ran loose, and our cocassier was unpinioned.

It comforted him out of all proportion to the advantage. At least his hands were free for any
emergency that might offer. That he depended in such a situation, and with no illusions as
to what was to happen, upon emergency, shows how tenacious he was of hope.

He had been released not a moment too soon. Overhead, Grandmaison and his men were no longer
singing. They were moving about. Something bumped against the side of the vessel, near the
bow, obviously a boat, and voices came up from below the level of the deck. Then the lighter
shuddered under a great blow upon the planks of the forecastle port. The cries in the hold
redoubled. Panting, cursing, wailing men hurtled against Leroy, and almost crushed him for
a moment under their weight as the vessel heaved to starboard. Came a succession of blows,
not only on the port in the bow, but also on that astern. There was a cracking and rending
of timbers, and the water rushed in.

Then the happenings in that black darkness became indescribably horrible. In their frenzy not
a few had torn themselves free of their bonds. These hurled themselves towards the open ports
through which the water was pouring. They tore at the planks with desperate, lacerated hands.
Some got their arms through, seeking convulsively to widen the openings and so to gain an egress.
But outside in the shipwrights' boat stood Grandmaison, the fencing-master, brandishing a butcher's
sword.

With derision and foul objurgations he slashed at protruding arms and hands, thrust his sword
again and again through the port into that close-packed, weltering mass, until at last the
shipwrights backed away the boat to escape the suction of the sinking lighter.

The vessel, with its doomed freight of a hundred and thirty human lives, settled down slowly
by the head, and the wailing and cursing was suddenly silenced as the icy waters of the Loire
eddied over it and raced on.

Caught in the swirl of water, Leroy had been carried up against the deck of the lighter. Instinctively
he had clutched at a crossbeam. The water raced over his head, and then, to his surprise, receded,
beat up once or twice as the lighter grounded, and finally settled on a level with his shoulders.

He was quick to realize what had happened. The lighter had gone down by the head on a shallow.
Her stern remained slightly protruding, so that in that part of her between the level of the
water and the deck there was a clear space of perhaps a foot or a foot and a half. Yet of the
hundred and thirty doomed wretches on board he was the only one who had profited by this extraordinary
chance.

Leroy hung on there; and thereafter for two hours, to use his own expression, he floated upon
corpses. A man of less vigorous mettle, moral and physical, could never have withstood the
ordeal of a two hours' immersion in the ice-cold water of that December morning. Leroy clung
on, and hoped. I have said that he was tenacious of hope. And soon after daybreak he was justified
of his confidence in his luck. As the first livid gleams of light began to suffuse the water
in which he floated, a creaking of rowlocks and a sound of voices reached his ears. A boat
was passing down the river.

Leroy shouted, and his voice rang hollow and sepulchral on the morning stillness. The creak
of oars ceased abruptly. He shouted again, and was answered. The oars worked now at twice their
former speed. The boat was alongside. Blows of a grapnel tore at the planking of the deck until
there was a hole big enough to admit the passage of his body.

He looked through the faint mist which he had feared never to see again, heaved himself up
with what remained him of strength until his breast was on a level with the deck, and beheld
two men in a boat.

But, exhausted by the effort, his numbed limbs refused to support him. He sank back, and went
overhead, fearing now, indeed, that help had arrived too late. But as he struggled to the surface
the bight of a rope smacked the water within the hold. Convulsively he clutched it, wound it
about one arm, and bade them haul.

Thus they dragged him out and aboard their own craft, and put him ashore at the nearest point
willing out of humanity to do so much, but daring to do no more when he had told them how he
came where they had found him.

Half naked, numbed through and through, with chattering teeth and failing limbs, Leroy staggered
into the guard-house at Chantenay. Soldiers of the Blues stripped him of his sodden rags, wrapped
him in a blanket, thawed him outwardly before a fire and inwardly with gruel, and then invited
him to give an account of himself.

The story of the horse will have led you to suppose him a ready liar. He drew now upon that
gift of his, represented himself as a mariner from Montoir, and told a harrowing tale of shipwreck.
Unfortunately, he overdid it. There was present a fellow who knew something of the sea, and
something of Montoir, to whom Leroy's tale did not ring quite true. To rid themselves of responsibility,
the soldiers carried him before the Revolutionary Committee of Nantes.

Even here all might have gone well with him, since there was no member of that body with seacraft
to penetrate his imposture. But as ill-chance would have it, one of the members sitting that
day was the black-mustached sans-culotte Jolly, the very man who had dragged Leroy out of his
cell last night and tied him up.

At sight of him Jolly's eyes bulged in his head.

"Where the devil have you come from?" he greeted him thunderously.

Leroy quailed. Jolly's associates stared. But Jolly explained to them:

"He was of last night's bathing party. And he has the impudence to come before us like this.
Take him away and shove him back into the water."

But Bachelier, a man who, next to the President Goullin, exerted the greatest influence in
the committee, was gifted with a sense of humour worthy of the Revolution. He went off into
peals of laughter as he surveyed the crestfallen cocassier, and, perhaps because Leroy's situation
amused him, he was disposed to be humane.

"No, no!" he said. "Take him back to Le Bouffay for the present. Let the Tribunal deal with him."

So back to Le Bouffay went Leroy, back to his dungeon, his fetid straw and his bread and water,
there to be forgotten again, as he had been forgotten before, until Fate should need him.

It is to him that we owe most of the materials from which we are able to reconstruct in detail
that first of Carrier's drownings on a grand scale, conceived as an expeditious means of ridding
the city of useless mouths, of easing the straitened circumstances resulting from misgovernment.

Very soon it was followed by others, and, custom increasing Carrier's audacity, these drownings--there
were in all some twenty-three noyades--ceased to be conducted in the secrecy of the night,
or to be confined to men. They were made presently to include women--of whom at one drowning
alone, in Novose, three hundred perished under the most revolting circumstances--and even little
children. Carrier himself admitted that during the three months of his rule some three thousand
victims visited the national bathing-place, whilst other, and no doubt more veracious, accounts
treble that number of those who received the National Baptism.

Soon these wholesale drownings had become an institution, a sort of national spectacle that
Carrier and his committee felt themselves in duty bound to provide.

But at length a point was reached beyond which it seemed difficult to continue them. So expeditious
was the measure, that soon the obvious material was exhausted. The prisons were empty. Yet
habits, once contracted, are not easily relinquished. Carrier would be looking elsewhere for
material, and there was no saying where he might look, or who would be safe. Soon the committee
heard a rumour that the Representative intended to depose it and to appoint a new one, whereupon
many of its members, who were conscious of lukewarmness, began to grow uneasy.

Uneasy, too, became the members of the People's Society. They had sent a deputation to Carrier
with suggestions for the better conduct of the protracted campaign of La Vendee. This was a
sore point with the Representative. He received the patriots with the foulest abuse, and had
them flung downstairs by his secretaries.

Into this atmosphere of general mistrust and apprehension came the most ridiculous Deus ex
machina that ever was in the person of the very young and very rash Marc Antoine Jullien. His
father, the Deputy Jullien, was an intimate of Robespierre's, by whose influence Marc Antoine
was appointed to the office of Agent of the Committee of Public Safety, and sent on a tour
of inspection to report upon public feeling and the conduct of the Convention's Representatives.

Arriving in Nantes at the end of January of '94, one of Marc Antoine's first visits happened
to be to the People's Society, which was still quivering with rage at the indignities offered
by Carrier to its deputation.

Marc Antoine was shocked by what he heard, so shocked that instead of going to visit the Representative
on the morrow, he spent the morning inditing a letter to Robespierre, in which he set forth
in detail the abuses of which Carrier was guilty, and the deplorable state of misery in which
he found the city of Nantes.

That night, as Marc Antoine was sinking into the peaceful slumber of the man with duty done,
he was rudely aroused by an officer and a couple of men of the National Guard, who announced
to him that he was under arrest, and bade him rise and dress.

Marc Antoine flounced out of bed in a temper, and flaunted his credentials. The officer remained
unmoved. He was acting upon orders from the Citizen Representative.

Still in a temper, Marc Antoine hurriedly dressed himself. He would soon show this Representative
that it is not safe to trifle with Agents of the Public Safety. The Citizen Representative
should hear from him. The officer, still unimpressed, bundled him into a waiting carriage,
and bore him away to the Maison Villetreux, on the island where Carrier had his residence.

Carrier had gone to bed. But he was awake, and he sat up promptly when the young muscadin from
Paris was roughly thrust into his room by the soldiers. The mere sight of the Representative
sufficed to evaporate Marc Antoine's anger, and with it his courage.

Carrier's pallor was of a grey-green from the rage that possessed him. His black eyes smouldered
like those of an animal seen in the gloom, and his tumbled black hair, fluttering about his
moist brow, increased the terrific aspect of his countenance. Marc Antoine shrank and was dumb.

"So," said Carrier, regarding him steadily, terribly, "you are the thing that dares to denounce
me to the Safety, that ventures to find fault with my work!" From under his pillow he drew
Marc Antoine's letter to Robespierre. "Is this yours?"

At the sight of this violation of his correspondence with the Incorruptible, Marc Antoine's
indignation awoke, and revived his courage.

"It is mine," he answered. "By what right have you intercepted it?"

"By what right?" Carrier put a leg out of bed. "So you question my right, do you? You have
so imposed yourself upon folk that you are given powers, and you come here to air them, by--"

"You shall answer to the Citizen Robespierre for your conduct," Marc Antoine threatened him.

"Aha!" Carrier revealed his teeth in a smile of ineffable wickedness. He slipped from the bed,
and crouching slightly as if about to spring, he pointed a lean finger at his captive.

"You are of those with whom it is dangerous to deal publicly, and you presume upon that. But
you can be dealt with privily, and you shall. I have you, and, by--, you shall not escape me,
you--!"

Marc Antoine looked into the Representative's face, and saw there the wickedness of his intent.
He stiffened. Nature had endowed him with wits, and he used them now.

"Citizen Carrier," he said, "I understand. I am to be murdered to-night in the gloom and the
silence. But you shall perish after me in daylight, and amid the execrations of the people.
You may have intercepted my letters to my father and to Robespierre. But if I do not leave
Nantes, my father will come to ask an account of you, and you will end your life on the scaffold
like the miserable assassin that you are."

Of all that tirade, but one sentence had remained as if corroded into the mind of Carrier.
"My letters to my father and to Robespierre," the astute Marc Antoine had said. And Marc Antoine
saw the Representative's mouth loosen, saw a glint of fear replace the ferocity in his dark eyes.

What Marc Antoine intended to suggest had instantly leapt to Carrier's mind--that there had
been a second letter which his agents had missed. They should pay for that. But, meanwhile,
if it were true, he dare not for his neck's sake go further in this matter. He may have suspected
that it was not true. But he had no means of testing that suspicion. Marc Antoine, you see,
was subtle.

"Your father?" growled the Representative. "Who is your father?"

"The Deputy Jullien."

"What?" Carrier straightened himself, affecting an immense astonishment. "You are the son of
the Deputy Julien?" He burst into a laugh. He came forward, holding out both his hands. He
could be subtle, too, you see. "My friend, why did you not say so sooner? See in what a ghastly
mistake you have let me flounder. I imagined you--of course, it was foolish of me--to be a
proscribed rascal from Angers, of the same name."

He had fallen upon Marc Antoine's neck, and was embracing him.

"Forgive me, my friend!" he besought him. "Come and dine with me to-morrow, and we will laugh
over it together."

But Marc Antoine had no mind to dine with Carrier, although he promised to do so readily enough.
Back at his inn, scarce believing that he had got away alive, still sweating with terror at
the very thought of his near escape, he packed his valise, and, by virtue of his commission,
obtained post-horses at once.

On the morrow from Angers, safe beyond the reach of Carrier, he wrote again to Robespierre,
and this time also to his father.

"In Nantes," he wrote, "I found the old regime in its worst form." He knew the jargon of Liberty,
the tune that set the patriots a-dancing. "Carrier's insolent secretaries emulate the intolerable
haughtiness of a ci-devant minister's lackeys. Carrier himself lives surrounded by luxury,
pampered by women 'and parasites, keeping a harem and a court. He tramples justice in the mud.
He has had all those who filled the prisons flung untried into the Loire. The city of Nantes,"
he concluded, "needs saving. The Vendean revolt must be suppressed, and Carrier the slayer
of Liberty recalled."

The letter had its effect, and Carrier was recalled to Paris, but not in disgrace. Failing
health was urged as the solicitous reason for his retirement from the arduous duties of governing
Nantes.

In the Convention his return made little stir, and even when early in the following July he
learnt that Bourbotte, his successor at Nantes, had ordered the arrest of Goullin, Bachelier,
Grandmaison, and his other friends of the committee, on the score of the drownings and the
appropriation of national property confiscated from emigres, he remained calm, satisfied that
his own position was unassailable.

But the members of the Committee of Nantes were sent to Paris for trial, and their arrival
there took place on that most memorable date in the annals of the Revolution, the 10th Thermidor
(July 29, 1794, O.S.), the day on which Robespierre fell and the floodgates of vengeance upon
the terrorists were flung open.

You have seen in the case of Marc Antoine Jullien how quick Carrier could be to take a cue.
In a coach he followed the tumbril that bore Robespierre to execution, radiant of countenance
and shouting with the loudest, "Death to the traitor!" On the morrow from the rostrum of the
Convention, he passionately represented himself as a victim of the fallen tyrant, cleverly
turning to his own credit the Marc Antoine affair, reminding the Convention how he had himself
been denounced to Robespierre. He was greeted with applause in that atmosphere of Thermidorean
reaction.

But Nemesis was stalking him relentlessly if silently.

Among a batch of prisoners whom a chain of curious chances had brought from Nantes to Paris
was our old friend Leroy the cocassier, required now as a witness against the members of the
committee.

Having acquainted the court with the grounds of his arrest, and the fact that for three years
he had lain forgotten and without trial in the pestilential prison of Le Bouffay, Leroy passed
on to a recital of his sufferings on that night of terror when he had gone down the Loire in
the doomed lighter. He told his tale with an artlessness that rendered it the more moving and
convincing. The audience crowding the chamber of justice shuddered with horror, and sobbed
over the details of his torments, wept for joy over his miraculous preservation. At the close
he was applauded on all sides, which bewildered him a little, for he had never known anything
but abuse in all his chequered life.

And then, at the promptings of that spirit of reaction that was abroad in those days when France
was awakening from the nightmare of terror, some one made there and then a collection on his
behalf, and came to thrust into his hands a great bundle of assignats and bank bills, which
to the humble cocassier represented almost a fortune. It was his turn to weep.

Then the crowd in the court which had heard his story shouted for the head of Carrier. The
demand was taken up by the whole of Paris, and finally his associates of the Convention handed
him over to the Revolutionary Tribunal.

He came before it on November 25th, and he could not find counsel to defend him. Six advocates
named in succession by the President refused to plead the cause of so inhuman a monster. In
a rage, at last Carrier announced that he would defend himself. He did.

He took the line that his business in Nantes had been chiefly concerned with provisioning the
Army of the West; that he had had little to do with the policing of Nantes, which he left entirely
to the Revolutionary Committee; and that he had no knowledge of the things said to have taken
place. But Goullin, Bachelier, and the others were there to fling back the accusation in their
endeavours to save their own necks at the expense of his.

He was sentenced on the very anniversary of that terrible night on which the men of the Marat
Company broke into the prison of Le Bouffay, and he was accompanied in the tumbril by Grandmaison
the pitiless, who was now filled with self-pity to such an extent that he wept bitterly.

The crowd, which had hooted and insulted him from the Conciergerie to the Place de Greve, fell
suddenly silent as he mounted the scaffold, his step firm, but his shoulders bowed, and his
eyes upon the ground.

Suddenly upon the silence, grotesquely, horribly merry, broke the sound of a clarinet playing
the "Ca ira!"

Jerking himself erect, Carrier turned and flung the last of his terrible glances at the musician.

A moment later the knife fell with a thud, and a bleeding head rolled into the basket, the
eyes still staring, but powerless now to inspire terror.

Upon the general silence broke an echo of the stroke.

"Vlan!" cried a voice. "And there's a fine end to a great drowner!"

It was Leroy the cocassier. The crowd took up the cry.

IX. THE NIGHT OF NUPTIALS--Charles The Bold And Sapphira Danvelt

When Philip the Good succumbed at Bruges of an apoplexy in the early part of the year 1467,
the occasion was represented to the stout folk of Flanders as a favourable one to break the
Burgundian yoke under which they laboured. It was so represented by the agents of that astute
king, Louis XI, who ever preferred guile to the direct and costly exertion of force.

Charles, surnamed the Bold (le Temeraire), the new Duke of Burgundy, was of all the French
King's enemies by far the most formidable and menacing just then; and the wily King, who knew
better than to measure himself with a foe that was formidable, conceived a way to embarrass
the Duke and cripple his resources at the very outset of his reign. To this end did he send
his agents into the Duke's Flemish dominions, there to intrigue with the powerful and to stir
up the spirit of sedition that never did more than slumber in the hearts of those turbulent
burghers.

It was from the Belfry Tower of the populous, wealthy city of Ghent--then one of the most populous
and wealthy cities of Europe--that the call to arms first rang out, summoning the city's forty
thousand weavers to quit their looms and take up weapons--the sword, the pike, and that arm
so peculiarly Flemish, known as the goedendag. From Ghent the fierce flame of revolt spread
rapidly to the valley of the Meuse, and the scarcely less important city of Liege, where the
powerful guilds of armourers and leather workers proved as ready for battle as the weavers
of Ghent.

They made a brave enough show until Charles the Bold came face to face with them at Saint-Trond,
and smashed the mutinous burgher army into shards, leaving them in their slaughtered thousands
upon the stricken field.

The Duke was very angry. He felt that the Flemings had sought to take a base advantage of him
at a moment when it was supposed he would not be equal to protecting his interests, and he
intended to brand it for all time upon their minds that it was not safe to take such liberties
with their liege lord. Thus, when a dozen of the most important burghers of Liege came out
to him very humbly in their shirts, with halters round their necks, to kneel in the dust at
his feet and offer him the keys of the city, he spurned the offer with angry disdain.

"You shall be taught," he told them, "how little I require your keys, and I hope that you will
remember the lesson for your own good."

On the morrow his pioneers began to smash a breach, twenty fathoms wide, in one of the walls
of the city, rolling the rubble into the ditch to fill it up at the spot. When the operation
was complete, Charles rode through the gap, as a conqueror, with vizor lowered and lance on
thigh at the head of his Burgundians, into his city of Liege, whose fortifications he commanded
should be permanently demolished.

That was the end of the Flemish rising of 1467 against Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy. The
weavers returned to their looms, the armourers to their forges, and the glove-makers and leather
workers to their shears. Peace was restored; and to see that it was kept, Charles appointed
military governors of his confidence where he deemed them necessary.

One of these was Claudius von Rhynsault, who had followed the Duke's fortunes for some years
now, a born leader of men, a fellow of infinite address at arms and resource in battle, and
of a bold, reckless courage that nothing could ever daunt. It was perhaps this last quality
that rendered him so esteemed of Charles, himself named the Bold, whose view of courage was
that it was a virtue so lofty that in the nature of its possessor there could, perforce, be
nothing mean.

So now, to mark his esteem of this stalwart German, the Duke made him Governor of the province
of Zeeland, and dispatched him thither to stamp out there any lingering sparks of revolt, and
to rule it in his name as ducal lieutenant.

Thus, upon a fair May morning, came Claud of Ryhnsault and his hardy riders to the town of
Middelburg, the capital of Zeeland, to take up his residence at the Gravenhof in the main square,
and thence to dispense justice throughout that land of dykes in his master's princely name.
This justice the German captain dispensed with merciless rigour, conceiving that to be the
proper way to uproot rebellious tendencies. It was inevitable that he should follow such a
course, impelled to it by a remorseless cruelty in his nature, of which the Duke his master
had seen no hint, else he might have thought twice before making him Governor of Zeeland, for
Charles--despite his rigour when treachery was to be punished--was a just and humane prince.

Now, amongst those arrested and flung into Middelburg gaol as a result of Rhynsault's ruthless
perquisitions and inquisitions was a wealthy young burgher named Philip Danvelt. His arrest
was occasioned by a letter signed "Philip Danvelt" found in the house of a marked rebel who
had been first tortured and then hanged. The letter, of a date immediately preceding the late
rising, promised assistance in the shape of arms and money.

Brought before Rhynsault for examination, in a cheerless hall of the Gravenhof, Danvelt's defence
was a denial upon oath that he had ever taken or offered to take any part in the rebellion.
Told of the letter found, and of the date it bore, he laughed. That letter made everything
very simple and clear. At the date it bore he had been away at Flushing marrying a wife, whom
he had since brought thence to Middelburg. It was ludicrous, he urged, to suppose that in such
a season--of all seasons in a man's life--he should have been concerned with rebellion or correspondence
with rebels, and, urging this, he laughed again.

Now, the German captain did not like burghers who laughed in his presence. It argued a lack
of proper awe for the dignity of his office and the importance of his person. From his high
seat at the Judgment-board, flanked by clerks and hedged about by men-at-arms, he scowled upon
the flaxen-haired, fresh-complexioned young burgher who bore himself so very easily. He was
a big, handsome man, this Rhynsault, of perhaps some thirty years of age. His thick hair was
of a reddish brown, and his beardless face was cast in bold lines and tanned by exposure to
the colour of mahogany, save where the pale line of a scar crossed his left cheek.

"Yet, I tell you, the letter bears your signature," he grumbled sourly.

"My name, perhaps," smiled the amiable Danvelt, "but assuredly not my signature."

"Herrgott!" swore the German captain. "Is this a riddle? What is the difference?"

Feeling himself secure, that very foolish burgher ventured to be mildly insolent.

"It is a riddle that the meanest of your clerks there can read for you," said he.

The Governor's blue eyes gleamed like steel as they, fastened upon Danvelt, his heavy jaw seemed
to thrust itself forward, and a dull flush crept into his cheeks. Then he swore.

"Beim blute Gottes!" quoth he, "do you whet your trader's wit upon me, scum?"

And to the waiting men-at-arms:

"Take him back to his dungeon," he commanded, "that in its quiet he may study a proper carriage
before he is next brought before us."

Danvelt was haled away to gaol again, to repent him of his pertness and to reflect that, under
the governorship of Claudius von Rhynsault, it was not only the guilty who had need to go warily.

The Governor sat back in his chair with a grunt. His secretary, on his immediate right, leaned
towards him.

"It were easy to test the truth of the man's assertion," said he. "Let his servants and his
wife attend and be questioned as to when he was in Flushing and when married."

"Aye," growled von Rhynsault. "Let it be done. I don't doubt we shall discover that the dog
was lying."

But no such discovery was made when, on the morrow, Danvelt's household and his wife stood
before the Governor to answer his questions. Their replies most fully bore out the tale Danvelt
had told, and appeared in other ways to place it beyond all doubt that he had taken no part,
in deed or even in thought, in the rebellion against the Duke of Burgundy. His wife protested
it solemnly and piteously.

"To this I can swear, my lord," she concluded. "I am sure no evidence can be brought against
him, who was ever loyal and ever concerned with his affairs and with me at the time in question.
My lord"--she held out her hands towards the grim German, and her lovely eyes gleamed with
unshed tears of supplication--"I implore you to believe me, and in default of witnesses against
him to restore my husband to me."

Rhynsault's blue eyes kindled now as they considered her, and his full red lips slowly parted
in the faintest and most inscrutable of smiles. She was very fair to look upon--of middle height
and most exquisite shape. Her gown, of palest saffron, edged with fur, high-waisted according
to the mode, and fitted closely to the gently swelling bust, was cut low to display the white
perfection of her neck. Her softly rounded face looked absurdly childlike under the tall-crowned
hennin, from which a wispy veil floated behind her as she moved.

In silence, then, for a spell, the German mercenary pondered her with those slowly kindling
eyes, that slowly spreading, indefinite smile. Then he stirred, and to his secretary he muttered
shortly:

"The woman lies. In private I may snare the truth from her."

He rose--a tall, massively imposing figure in a low-girdled tunic of deep purple velvet, open
at the breast, and gold-laced across a white silken undervest.

"There is some evidence," he informed her gruffly. "Come with me, and you shall see it for
yourself."

He led the way from that cheerless hall by a dark corridor to a small snug room, richly hung
and carpeted, where a servant waited. He dismissed the fellow, and in the same breath bade
her enter, watching her the while from under lowered brows. One of her women had followed;
but admittance was denied her. Danvelt's wife must enter his room alone.

Whilst she waited there, with scared eyes and fluttering bosom, he went to take from an oaken
coffer the letter signed "Philip Danvelt." He folded the sheet so that the name only was to
be read, and came to thrust it under her eyes.

"What name is that?" he asked her gruffly.

Her answer was very prompt.

"It is my husband's, but not the writing--it is another hand; some other Philip Danvelt; there
will be others in Zeeland."

He laughed softly, looking at her ever with that odd intentness, and under his gaze she shrank
and cowered in terror; it spoke to her of some nameless evil; the tepid air of the luxurious
room was stifling her.

"If I believed you, your husband would be delivered from his prison--from all danger; and he
stands, I swear to you, in mortal peril."

"Ah, but you must believe me. There are others who can bear witness."

"I care naught for others," he broke in, with harsh and arrogant contempt. Then he softened
his voice to a lover's key. "But I might accept your word that this is not your husband's hand,
even though I did not believe you."

She did not understand, and so she could only stare at him with those round, brown eyes of
hers dilating, her lovely cheeks blanching with horrid fear.

"Why, see," he said at length, with an easy, gruff good-humour, "I place the life of Philip
Danvelt in those fair hands to do with as you please. Surely, sweeting, you will not be so
unkind as to destroy it."

And as he spoke his face bent nearer to her own, his flaming eyes devoured her, and his arm
slipped softly, snake-like round her to draw her to him. But before it had closed its grip
she had started away, springing back in horror, an outcry already on her pale lips.

"One word," he admonished her sharply, "and it speaks your husband's doom!"

"Oh, let me go, let me go!" she cried in anguish.

"And leave your husband in the hangman's hands?" he asked.

"Let me go! Let me go!" was all that she could answer him, expressing the only thought of which
in that dread moment her mind was capable.

That and the loathing on her face wounded his vanity for this beast was vain. His manner changed,
and the abysmal brute in him was revealed in the anger he displayed. With foul imprecations
he drove her out.

Next day a messenger from the Governor waited upon her at her house with a brief note to inform
her that her husband would be hanged upon the morrow. Incredulity was succeeded by a numb,
stony, dry-eyed grief, in which she sat alone for hours--a woman entranced. At last, towards
dusk, she summoned a couple of her grooms to attend and light her, and made her way, ever in
that odd somnambulistic state, to the gaol of Middelburg. She announced herself to the head
gaoler as the wife of Philip Danvelt, lying under sentence of death, and that she was come
to take her last leave of him. It was not a thing to be denied, nor had the gaoler any orders
to deny it.

So she was ushered into the dank cell where Philip waited for his doom, and by the yellow wheel
of light of the lantern that hung from the shallow vaulted ceiling she beheld the ghastly change
that the news of impending death had wrought in him. No longer was he the self-assured young
burgher who, conscious of his innocence and worldly importance, had used a certain careless
insolence with the Governor of Zeeland. Here she beheld a man of livid and distorted face,
wild-eyed, his hair and garments in disarray, suggesting the physical convulsions to which
he had yielded in his despair and rage.

"Sapphira!" he cried at sight of her. A sigh of anguish and he flung himself, shuddering and
sobbing, upon her breast. She put her arms about him, soothed him gently, and drew him back
to the wooden chair from which he had leapt to greet her.

He took his head in his hands and poured out the fierce anguish of his soul. To die innocent
as he was, to be the victim of an arbitrary, unjust power! And to perish at his age!

Hearing him rave, she shivered out of an agony of compassion and also of some terror for herself.
She would that he found it less hard to die. And thinking this she thought further, and uttered
some of her thought aloud.

"I could have saved you, my poor Philip."

He started up, and showed her again that livid, distorted face of his.

"What do you mean?" he asked hoarsely. "You could have saved me, do you say? Then--then why--"

"Ah, but the price, my dear," she sobbed.

"Price?" quoth he in sudden, fierce contempt. "What price is too great to pay for life? Does
this Rhynsault want all our wealth, then yield it to him yield it so that I may live--"

"Should I have hesitated had it been but that?" she interrupted.

And then she told him, whilst he sat there hunched and shuddering.

"The dog! The foul German dog!" he muttered through clenched teeth.

"So that you see, my dear," she pursued brokenly, "it was too great a price. Yourself, you
could not have condoned it, or done aught else but loathe me afterwards."

But he was not as stout-mettled as she deemed him, or else the all-consuming thirst of life,
youth's stark horror of death, made him a temporizing craven in that hour.

"Who knows?" he answered. "Certes, I do not. But a thing so done, a thing in which the will
and mind have no part, resolves itself perhaps into a sacrifice--"

He broke off there, perhaps from very shame. After all he was a man, and there are limits to
what manhood will permit of one.

But those words of his sank deeply into her soul. They rang again and again in her ears as
she took her anguished way home after the agony of their farewells, and in the end they drove
her out again that very night to seek the Governor of Zeeland.

Rhynsault was at supper when she came, and without quitting the table bade them usher her into
his presence. He found her very white, but singularly calm and purposeful in her bearing.

"Well, mistress?"

"May I speak to you alone?"

Her voice was as steady as her glance.

He waved away the attendants, drank a deep draught from the cup at his elbow, wiped his mouth
with the back of his hand, and sat back in his tall chair to hear her.

"Yesterday," she said, "you made, or seemed to make, me a proposal."

He looked up at first in surprise, then with a faint smile on his coarse, red mouth. His glance
had read her meaning clearly.

"Look you, mistress, here I am lord of life and death. Yet in the case of your husband I yield
up that power to you. Say but the word and I sign the order for his gaol delivery at dawn."

"I have come to say that word," she informed him.

A moment he looked up at her, his smile broadening, a flush mounting to his cheek-bones. Then
he rose and sent his chair crashing behind him to the ground.

"Herrgott!" he grunted; and he gathered her slim, trembling body to his massive gold-laced breast.

Soon after sunrise on the morrow she was beating at the gates of Middelburg gaol, a paper clutched
convulsively in her left hand.

She was admitted, and to the head gaoler she showed the paper that she carried.

"An order from the Governor of Zeeland for the gaol delivery of Philip Danvelt!" she announced
almost hysterically.

The gaoler scanned the paper, then her face. His lips tightened.

"Come this way," he said; and led her down a gloomy corridor to the cell where yesterday she
had seen her husband.

He threw wide the door, and Sapphira sprang in.

"Philip!" she cried, and checked as suddenly.

He lay supine and still upon the miserable pallet, his hands folded upon his breast, his face
waxen, his eyes staring glassily through half-closed lids.

She sped to his side in a sudden chill of terror. She fell on her knees and touched him.

"Dead!" she screamed, and, kneeling, span round questioning to face the gaoler in the doorway.
"Dead!"

"He was hanged at daybreak, mistress," said the gaoler gently.

She rocked a moment, moaning, then fell suddenly forward across her husband's body in a swoon.

That evening she was again at the Gravenhof to see Rhynsault, and again she was admitted--a
haggard faced woman now, in whom there was no trace of beauty left. She came to stand before
the Governor, considered him in silence a moment with a loathing unutterable in her glance,
then launched into fierce recriminations of his broken faith.

He heard her out, then shrugged and smiled indulgently.

"I performed no less than I promised," said he. "I pledged my word to Danvelt's gaol delivery,
and was not my gaol delivery effective? You could hardly suppose that I should allow it to
be of such a fashion as to interfere with our future happy meetings."

Before his leering glance she fled in terror, followed by the sound of his bestial laugh.

For a week thereafter she kept her house and brooded. Then one day she sallied forth all dressed
in deepest mourning and attended by a train of servants, and, embarking upon a flat-bottomed
barge, was borne up the river Scheldt towards Antwerp. Bruges was her ultimate destination,
of which she left no word behind her, and took the longest way round to reach it. From Antwerp
her barge voyaged on to Ghent, and thence by canal, drawn by four stout Flemish horses, at
last to the magnificent city where the Dukes of Burgundy kept their Court.

Under the June sunshine the opulent city of Bruges hummed with activity like the great human
hive it was. For Bruges at this date was the market of the world, the very centre of the world's
commerce, the cosmopolis of the age. Within its walls were established the agencies of a score
of foreign great trading companies, and the ambassadors of no less a number of foreign Powers.
Here on a day you might hear every language of civilization spoken in the broad thoroughfares
under the shadow of such imposing buildings as you would not have found together in another
city of Europe. To the harbour came the richly laden argosies from Venice and Genoa, from Germany
and the Baltic, from Constantinople and from England, and in her thronged markets Lombard and
Venetian, Levantine, Teuton, and Saxon stood jostling one another to buy and sell.

It was past noon, and the great belfry above the Gothic Cloth Hall in the Grande Place was
casting a lengthening shadow athwart the crowded square. Above the Babel of voices sounded
on a sudden the note of a horn, and there was a cry of "The Duke! The Duke!" followed by a
general scuttle of the multitude to leave a clear way down the middle of the great square.

A gorgeous cavalcade some twoscore strong came into sight, advancing at an amble, a ducal hunting
party returning to the palace. A hush fell upon the burgher crowd as it pressed back respectfully
to gaze; and to the din of human voices succeeded now the clatter of hoofs upon the kidney-stones
of the square, the jangle of hawkbells, the baying of hounds, and the occasional note of the
horn that had first brought warning of the Duke's approach.

It was a splendid iridescent company, flaunting in its apparel every colour of the prism. There
were great lords in silks and velvets of every hue, their legs encased in the finest skins
of Spain; there were great ladies, in tall, pointed hennins or bicorne headdresses and floating
veils, with embroidered gowns that swept down below the bellies of their richly harnessed palfreys.
And along the flanks of this cavalcade ran grooms and huntsmen in green and leather, their
jagged liripipes flung about their necks, leading the leashed hounds.
