*****Note II.--No doubt it will be difficult for those who think about things loosely, and
have not been accustomed to know them by their primary causes, to comprehend the  demonstration
of Prop. vii.:  for such persons make no distinction between the modifications of substances
and the substances themselves, and are ignorant of the manner in which things are produced;
hence they may attribute to substances the beginning which they observe in natural objects.
Those who are ignorant of true causes make complete confusion--think that trees might talk
just as well as men--that men might be formed from stones as well as from seed; and imagine
that any form might be changed into any other. So, also, those who confuse the two natures,
divine and human, readily attribute human  passions to the deity, especially so long as they
do not know how passions originate in the mind. But, if people would consider the nature of
substance, they would have no doubt about the truth of Prop. vii.  In fact, this proposition
would be a universal axiom, and accounted a truism. For, by substance, would be understood
that which is in itself, and is conceived through itself--that is, something of which the conception
requires not the  conception of anything else; whereas modifications exist in something external
to themselves, and a conception of them is formed by means of a conception of the things in
which they exist.  Therefore, we may have true ideas of non-existent modifications; for, although
they may have no actual existence apart from the conceiving intellect, yet their essence is
so involved in something external to themselves that they may through it be conceived.  Whereas
the only truth substances can have, external to the intellect, must  consist in their existence,
because they are conceived through themselves. Therefore, for a person to say that he has a
clear and distinct--that is, a true--idea of a substance, but that he is not sure whether such
substance exists, would be the same as if he said that he had a true idea, but was not sure
whether or no it was false (a little consideration will make this plain); or if anyone affirmed
that substance is created, it would be the same as saying that a false idea was true--in short,
the height of absurdity.  It must, then, necessarily be admitted that the existence of substance
as its essence is an eternal truth.  And we can hence conclude by another process of reasoning--that
there is but one such substance.  I think that this may profitably be done at once; and, in
order to proceed regularly with the demonstration, we must premise:--

+++++1.  The true definition of a thing neither involves nor expresses anything beyond the
nature of the thing defined.  From this it follows that--

+++++2.  No definition implies or expresses a certain number of individuals, inasmuch as it
expresses nothing beyond the nature of the thing defined.  For instance, the definition of
a triangle expresses nothing beyond the actual nature of a triangle:  it does not imply any
fixed number of triangles.

+++++3.  There is necessarily for each individual existent thing a cause why it should  exist.

+++++4.  This cause of existence must either be contained in the nature and definition of the
thing defined, or must be postulated apart from such definition.

It therefore follows that, if a given number of individual things exist in nature, there must
be some cause for the existence of exactly that number, neither more nor less.  For example,
if twenty men exist in the universe (for simplicity's sake, I will suppose them existing simultaneously,
and to have had no predecessors), and we want to account for the existence of these twenty
men, it will not be enough to show the cause of human existence in general; we must also show
why there are exactly twenty men, neither more nor less:  for a cause must be assigned for
the existence of each individual.  Now this cause cannot be contained in the actual nature
of man, for the true definition of man does not involve any consideration of the number twenty.
Consequently, the cause for the existence of these twenty men, and, consequently, of each of
them, must necessarily be sought externally to each individual. Hence we may lay down the absolute
rule, that everything which may consist of several individuals must have an external cause.
And, as it has been shown already that existence appertains to the nature of substance, existence
must necessarily be included in its definition; and from its definition alone existence must
be deducible.  But from its definition (as we have shown, Notes ii., iii.), we cannot infer
the existence of several substances; therefore it follows that there is only one substance
of the same nature.  Q.E.D.

IX.  The more reality or being a thing has, the greater the number of its attributes (Def. iv.).

X.  Each particular attribute of the one substance must be conceived through itself.

>>>>>Proof--An attribute is that which the intellect perceives of substance, as  constituting
its essence (Def. iv.), and, therefore, must be conceived through itself (Def. iii.).  Q.E.D.

*****Note--It is thus evident that, though two attributes are, in fact, conceived as distinct--that
is, one without the help of the other--yet we cannot, therefore, conclude  that they constitute
two entities, or two different substances.  For it is the nature of substance that each of
its attributes is conceived through itself, inasmuch as all the attributes it has have always
existed simultaneously in it, and none could be produced by any other; but each expresses the
reality or being of substance.  It is, then, far from an absurdity to ascribe several attributes
to one substance:  for nothing in nature is more clear than that each and every entity must
be conceived under some attribute, and that its  reality or being is in proportion to the number
of its attributes expressing necessity or eternity and infinity. Consequently it is abundantly
clear, that an absolutely infinite being must necessarily be defined as consisting in infinite
attributes, each of which expresses a  certain eternal and infinite essence.

If anyone now ask, by what sign shall he be able to distinguish different substances, let him
read the following propositions, which show that there is but one substance in the universe,
and that it is absolutely infinite, wherefore such a sign would be sought in vain.

XI. But this (Prop. vii.) is absurd.  Therefore God necessarily exists.

>>>>>Another proof--Of everything whatsoever a cause or reason must be assigned,  either for
its existence, or for its non-existence--e.g. if a triangle exist, a reason or cause must be
granted for its existence; if, on the contrary, it does not exist, a cause must also be granted,
which prevents it from existing, or annuls its existence.  This reason or cause must either
be contained in the nature of the thing in question, or be external to it.  For instance, the
reason for the non-existence of a square circle is indicated in its nature, namely, because
it would involve a contradiction.  On the other hand, the existence of substance follows also
solely from its nature, inasmuch as its nature involves existence. (See Prop. vii.)

 But the reason for the existence of a triangle or a circle does
not follow from the nature of those figures, but from the order
of universal nature in extension.  From the latter it must
follow, either that a triangle necessarily exists, or that it is
impossible that it should exist.  So much is self-evident.  It
follows therefrom that a thing necessarily exists, if no cause or
reason be granted which prevents its existence.

If, then, no cause or reason can be given, which prevents the existence of God, or which destroys
his existence, we must certainly conclude that he necessarily does exist.  If such a reason
or cause should be given, it must either be drawn from the very nature of God, or be external
to him--that is, drawn from another substance of another nature.  For if it were of the same
nature, God, by that very fact, would be admitted to exist.  But substance of another nature
could have nothing in common with God (by Prop. ii.), and therefore would be unable either
to cause or to destroy his existence.

As, then, a reason or cause which would annul the divine existence cannot be drawn from  anything
external to the divine nature, such cause must perforce, if God does not exist, be drawn from
God's own nature, which would involve a contradiction.  To make such an affirmation about a
being absolutely infinite and supremely perfect is absurd; therefore, neither in the nature
of God, nor externally to his nature, can a cause or reason be assigned which would annul his
existence.  Therefore, God necessarily exists.  Q.E.D.

>>>>>Another proof--The potentiality of non-existence is a negation of power, and contrariwise
the potentiality of existence is a power, as is obvious.  If, then, that which necessarily
exists is nothing but finite beings, such finite beings are more powerful than a being absolutely
infinite, which is obviously absurd; therefore, either nothing exists, or else a being absolutely
infinite necessarily exists also.  Now we exist either in ourselves, or in  something else
which necessarily exists (see Ax. i. and Prop. vii.).  Therefore a being absolutely infinite--in
other words, God (Def. vi.)--necessarily exists. Q.E.D.

*****Note--In this last proof, I have purposely shown God's existence 'a posteriori,' so that
the proof might be more easily followed, not because, from the same premises, God's existence
does not follow 'a priori.'  For, as the potentiality of existence is a power, it follows that,
in proportion as reality increases in the nature of a thing, so also will it increase its strength
for existence.  Therefore a being absolutely infinite, such as God, has from himself an absolutely
infinite power of existence, and hence he does absolutely exist. Perhaps there will be many
who will be unable to see the force of this proof, inasmuch as they are accustomed only to
consider those things which flow from external causes.  Of  such things, they see that those
which quickly come to pass--that is, quickly come into existence--quickly also disappear; whereas
they regard as more difficult of accomplishment --that is, not so easily brought into existence--those
things which they conceive as more complicated.

However, to do away with this misconception, I need not here show the measure of truth in the
proverb, "What comes quickly, goes quickly," nor discuss whether, from the point of view of
universal nature, all things are equally easy, or otherwise:  I need only remark that I am
not here speaking of things, which come to pass through causes external to themselves, but
only of substances which (by Prop. vi.) cannot be produced by any external cause.   Things
which are produced by external causes, whether they consist of many parts or few, owe whatsoever
perfection or reality they possess solely to the efficacy of their external  cause; wherefore
the existence of substance must arise solely from its own nature, which is nothing else but
its essence.  Thus, the perfection of a thing does not annul its existence,  but, on the contrary,
asserts it.  Imperfection, on the other hand, does annul it; therefore we cannot be more certain
of the existence of anything, than of the existence of a being absolutely infinite or perfect--that
is, of God.  For inasmuch as his essence excludes all imperfection, and involves absolute perfection,
all cause for doubt concerning his existence is done away, and the utmost certainty on the
question is given. This, I think, will be evident to every moderately attentive reader.

XII.  No attribute of substance can be conceived from which it would follow that substance
can be divided.

>>>>>Proof--The parts into which substance as thus conceived would be divided either  will
retain the nature of substance, or they will not.  If the former, then (by Prop. viii.) each
part will necessarily be infinite, and (by Prop vi.) self-caused, and (by Prop. v.) will perforce
consist of a different attribute, so that, in that case, several substances could be formed
out of one substance, which (by Prop. vi.) is absurd.  Moreover, the parts (by Prop. ii.) would
have nothing in common with their whole, and the whole (by Def. iv. and Prop. X) could both
exist and be conceived without its parts, which everyone will admit to be absurd.  If we adopt
the second alternative--namely, that the parts will not retain the  nature of substance--then,
if the whole substance were divided into equal parts, it would  lose the nature of substance,
and would cease to exist, which (by Prop. vii.) is absurd.

XIII.  Substance absolutely infinite is indivisible.

>>>>>Proof--If it could be divided, the parts into which it was divided would either retain
the nature of absolutely infinite substance, or they would not.  If the former, we should have
several substances of the same nature, which (by Prop. v.) is absurd.  If the latter,  then
(by Prop. vii.) substance absolutely infinite could cease to exist, which (by Prop. xi.) is
also absurd.

<<<<<Corollary--It follows that no substance, and consequently no extended substance, in so
far as it is substance, is divisible.

*****Note--The indivisibility of substance may be more easily understood as follows.  The nature
of substance can only be conceived as infinite, and by a part of substance, nothing else can
be understood than finite substance, which (by Prop. viii.) involves a manifest  contradiction.

XIV.  Besides God no substance can be granted or conceived.

>>>>>Proof--As God is a being absolutely infinite, of whom no attribute that expresses the
essence of substance can be denied (by Def. vi.), and he necessarily exists (by Prop. xi.);
if any substance besides God were granted, it would have to be explained by some attribute
of God, and thus two substances with the same attribute would exist, which (by Prop. v.) is
absurd; therefore, besides God no substance can be granted, or consequently be conceived. If
it could be conceived, it would necessarily have to be conceived as existent; but this (by
the first part of this proof) is absurd.  Therefore, besides God no substance can be granted
or conceived.  Q.E.D.

<<<<<Corollary I.--Clearly, therefore:  1.  God is one, that is (by Def. vi.) only one substance
can be granted in the universe, and that substance is absolutely infinite, as we have already
indicated (in the note to Prop. x.).

<<<<<Corollary II.--It follows:  2.  That extension and thought are either attributes of God
or (by Ax. i.) accidents ("affectiones") of the attributes of God.

XV.  Whatsoever is, is in God, and without God nothing can be, or be conceived.

>>>>>Proof--Besides God, no substance is granted or can be conceived (by Prop. xiv.), that
is (by Def. iii.) nothing which is in itself and is conceived through itself.  But modes (by
Def. v.) can neither be, nor be conceived without substance; wherefore they can only be in
the divine nature, and can only through it be conceived.  But substances and modes form the
sum total of existence (by Ax. i.), therefore, without God nothing can be, or be conceived.  Q.E.D.

*****Note--Some assert that God, like a man, consists of body and mind, and is  susceptible
of passions.  How far such persons have strayed from the truth is sufficiently evident from
what has been said.  But these I pass over.  For all who have in anywise reflected on the divine
nature deny that God has a body.  Of this they find excellent proof in the fact that we understand
by body a definite quantity, so long, so broad, so deep, bounded by a certain shape, and it
is the height of absurdity to predicate such a thing of God, a being absolutely infinite. 
But meanwhile by other reasons with which they try to prove their point, they show that they
think corporeal or extended substance wholly apart from the divine nature, and say it was created
by God.  Wherefrom the divine nature can have been created, they are wholly ignorant; thus
they clearly show that they do not know  the meaning of their own words.  I myself have proved
sufficiently clearly, at any rate in my own judgment (Cor. Prop. vi., and Note 2, Prop. viii.),
that no substance can be  produced or created by anything other than itself.  Further, I showed
(in Prop. xiv.) that  besides God no substance can be granted or conceived. Hence we drew the
conclusion that extended substance is one of the infinite attributes of God.  However, in order
to explain more fully, I will refute the arguments of my adversaries, which all start from
the following points:--

Extended substance, in so far as it is substance, consists, as they think, in parts, wherefore
they deny that it can be infinite, or consequently, that it can appertain to God.  This they
illustrate with many examples, of which I will take one or two.  If extended substance, they
say, is infinite, let it be conceived to be divided into two parts; each part will then be
either finite or infinite.  If the former, then infinite substance is composed of two finite
parts, which is absurd.  If the latter, then one infinite will be twice as large as another
infinite, which is also absurd.

Further, if an infinite line be measured out in foot lengths, it will consist of an infinite
number of such parts; it would equally consist of an infinite number of parts, if each part
measured only an inch:  therefore, one infinity would be twelve times as great as the other.

Lastly, if from a single point there be conceived to be drawn two diverging lines which at
first are at a definite distance apart, but are produced to infinity, it is certain that the
distance between the two lines will be continually increased, until at length it changes from
definite to indefinable.  As these absurdities follow, it is said, from considering quantity
as infinite, the conclusion is drawn that extended substance must necessarily be finite, and,
consequently, cannot appertain to the nature of God.

The second argument is also drawn from God's supreme perfection. God, it is said,  inasmuch
as he is a supremely perfect being, cannot be passive; but extended substance, insofar as it
is divisible, is passive.  It follows, therefore, that extended substance does not appertain
to the essence of God.

Such are the arguments I find on the subject in writers, who by them try to prove that extended
substance is unworthy of the divine nature, and cannot possibly appertain thereto.  However,
I think an attentive reader will see that I have already answered their propositions; for all
their arguments are founded on the hypothesis that extended substance is composed of parts,
and such a hypothesis I have shown (Prop. xii., and Cor. Prop. xiii.) to be absurd.  Moreover,
anyone who reflects will see that all these absurdities (if  absurdities they be, which I am
not now discussing), from which it is sought to extract the conclusion that extended substance
is finite, do not at all follow from the notion of an infinite quantity, but merely from the
notion that an infinite quantity is measurable, and composed of finite parts: therefore, the
only fair conclusion to be drawn is that infinite quantity is not measurable, and cannot be
composed of finite parts.  This is exactly what we have already proved (in Prop. xii.).  Wherefore
the weapon which they aimed at us has in reality recoiled upon themselves.  If, from this absurdity
of theirs, they persist in drawing the conclusion that extended substance must be finite, they
will in good sooth be acting like a man who asserts that circles have the properties of squares,
and, finding himself thereby landed in absurdities, proceeds to deny that circles have any
center, from which all lines drawn to the circumference are equal.  For, taking extended substance,
which can only be conceived as infinite, one, and indivisible (Props. viii., v., xii.) they
assert, in order to prove that it is finite, that it is composed of finite parts, and that
it can be multiplied and divided.

So, also, others, after asserting that a line is composed of points, can produce many arguments
to prove that a line cannot be infinitely divided.  Assuredly it is not less absurd to assert
that extended substance is made up of bodies or parts, than it would be to assert that a solid
is made up of surfaces, a surface of lines, and a line of points.  This must be admitted by
all who know clear reason to be infallible, and most of all by those who deny the possibility
of a vacuum.  For if extended substance could be so divided that its parts were really separate,
why should not one part admit of being destroyed, the others remaining joined together as before?
And why should all be so fitted into one another as to leave no vacuum?  Surely in the case
of things, which are really distinct one from the other, one can exist without the other, and
can remain in its original condition.  As, then, there does not exist a vacuum in nature (of
which anon), but all parts are bound to come together to prevent it, it follows from this that
the parts cannot really be distinguished, and that extended substance in so far as it is substance
cannot be divided.

If anyone asks me the further question, Why are we naturally so prone to divide quantity? I
answer, that quantity is conceived by us in two ways; in the abstract and superficially, as
we imagine it; or as substance, as we conceive it solely by the intellect. If, then, we regard
quantity as it is represented in our imagination, which we often and more easily do, we shall
find that it is finite, divisible, and compounded of parts; but if we regard it as it is represented
in our intellect, and conceive it as substance, which it is very difficult to do, we shall
then, as I have sufficiently proved, find that it is infinite, one, and indivisible.  This
will be plain enough to all who make a distinction between the intellect and the  imagination,
especially if it be remembered that matter is everywhere the same, that its parts are not distinguishable,
except in so far as we conceive matter as diversely modified, whence its parts are distinguished,
not really, but modally.  For instance, water, in so far as it is water, we conceive to be
divided, and its parts to be separated one from the other; but not in so far as it is extended
substance; from this point of view it is neither separated nor  divisible.  Further, water,
in so far as it is water, is produced and corrupted; but, in so far as it is substance, it
is neither produced nor corrupted.

I think I have now answered the second argument; it is, in fact, founded on the same assumption
as the first--namely, that matter, in so far as it is substance, is divisible, and composed
of parts.  Even if it were so, I do not know why it should be considered unworthy of the divine
nature, inasmuch as besides God (by Prop. xiv.) no substance can be granted, wherefrom it could
receive its modifications.  All things, I repeat, are in God, and all things which come to
pass, come to pass solely through the laws of the infinite nature of God, and follow (as I
will shortly show) from the necessity of his essence.   Wherefore it can in nowise be said
that God is passive in respect to anything other than himself, or that extended substance is
unworthy of the divine nature, even if it be supposed divisible, so long as it is granted to
be infinite and eternal.  But enough of this for the present.

XVI.  From the necessity of the divine nature must follow an infinite number of things in 
infinite ways--that is, all things which can fall within the sphere of infinite intellect.

>>>>>Proof--This proposition will be clear to everyone, who remembers that from the given definition
of any thing the intellect infers several properties, which really necessarily follow therefrom
(that is, from the actual essence of the thing defined); and it infers more properties in proportion
as the definition of the thing expresses more reality, that is, in proportion as the essence
of the thing defined involves more reality.  Now, as the divine nature has absolutely infinite
attributes (by Def. vi.), of which each expresses infinite essence after its kind, it follows
that from the necessity of its nature an infinite number of things (that is, everything which
can fall within the sphere of an infinite intellect) must necessarily follow.  Q.E.D.

<<<<<Corollary I.--Hence it follows, that God is the efficient cause of all that can fall within
the sphere of an infinite intellect.

<<<<<Corollary II.--It also follows that God is a cause in himself, and not through an accident
of his nature.

<<<<<Corollary III.--It follows, thirdly, that God is the absolutely first cause.

XVII.  God acts solely by the laws of his own nature, and is not constrained by anyone.

>>>>>Proof--We have just shown (in Prop. xvi.), that solely from the necessity of the divine
nature, or, what is the same thing, solely from the laws of his nature, an infinite  number
of things absolutely follow in an infinite number of ways; and we proved (in Prop. xv.), that
without God nothing can be nor be conceived; but that all things are in God. Wherefore nothing
can exist outside himself, whereby he can be conditioned or constrained to act.  Wherefore
God acts solely by the laws of his own nature, and is not constrained by anyone.  Q.E.D.

<<<<<Corollary I--It follows:  1.  That there can be no cause which, either extrinsically or
intrinsically, besides the perfection of his own nature, moves God to act.

<<<<<Corollary II--It follows:  2.  That God is the sole free cause.  For God alone exists
by the sole necessity of his nature (by Prop. xi. and Prop. xiv., Cor. i.), and acts by the
sole necessity of his own nature, wherefore God is (by Def. vii.) the sole free cause.  Q.E.D.

*****Note--Others think that God is a free cause, because he can, as they think, bring it about,
that those things which we have said follow from his nature--that is, which are in his power,
should not come to pass, or should not be produced by him.  But this is the same as if they
said, that God could bring it about, that it should follow from the nature of a  triangle that
its three interior angles should not be equal to two right angles; or that from a given cause
no effect should follow, which is absurd.

Moreover, I will show below, without the aid of this proposition, that neither intellect nor
will appertain to God's nature.  I know that there are many who think that they can show, that
supreme intellect and free will do appertain to God's nature; for they say they know of nothing
more perfect, which they can attribute to God, than that which is the highest perfection in
ourselves.  Further, although they conceive God as actually supremely intelligent, they yet
do not believe that he can bring into existence everything which he actually understands, for
they think that they would thus destroy God's power.  If, they contend, God had created everything
which is in his intellect, he would not be able to create anything more, and this, they think,
would clash with God's omnipotence; therefore, they prefer to asset that God is indifferent
to all things, and that he creates nothing except that which he has decided, by some absolute
exercise of will, to create.  However, I think I have shown sufficiently clearly (by Prop.
xvi.) that from God's supreme power, or infinite nature, an infinite number of things--that
is, all things have necessarily flowed forth in an infinite number of ways, or always flow
from the same necessity; in the same way as from the nature of a triangle it follows from eternity
and for eternity, that its three interior angles are equal to two right angles.  Wherefore
the omnipotence of God has been displayed from all eternity, and will for all eternity remain
in the same state of activity. This manner of treating the question attributes to God an omnipotence,
in my opinion, far more perfect.  For, otherwise, we are compelled to confess that God understands
an infinite number of creatable things, which he will never be able to create, for, if he created
all that he understands, he would, according to this showing, exhaust his omnipotence, and
render himself imperfect.  Wherefore, in order to establish that God is perfect, we should
be reduced to establishing at the same time, that he cannot bring to pass everything over which
his power extends; this seems to be a hypothesis most absurd, and most repugnant to God's omnipotence.

Further (to say a word concerning the intellect and the will which we attribute to God), if
intellect and will appertain to the eternal essence of God, we must take these words in some
significance quite different from those they usually bear.  For intellect and will, which should
constitute the essence of God, would perforce be as far apart as the poles from the human intellect
and will, in fact, would have nothing in common with them but the name; there would be about
as much correspondence between the two as there is between the Dog, the heavenly constellation,
and a dog, an animal that barks.  This I will prove as follows.  If intellect belongs to the
divine nature, it cannot be in nature, as ours is generally thought to be, posterior to, or
simultaneous with the things understood, inasmuch as God is prior to all things by reason of
his causality (Prop. xvi., Cor. i.).  On the  contrary, the truth and formal essence of things
is as it is, because it exists by representation as such in the intellect of God.  Wherefore
the intellect of God, in so far as it is conceived to constitute God's essence, is, in reality,
the cause of things, both of their essence and of their existence.  This seems to have been
recognized by those who have asserted, that God's intellect, God's will, and God's power, are
one and the same.  As, therefore, God's intellect is the sole cause of things, namely, both
of their essence and existence, it must necessarily differ from them in respect to its essence,
and in respect to its existence.  For a cause differs from a thing it causes, precisely in
the quality which the latter gains from the former.

For example, a man is the cause of another man's existence, but not of his essence (for the
latter is an eternal truth), and, therefore, the two men may be entirely similar in essence,
but must be different in existence; and hence if the existence of one of them cease, the existence
of the other will not necessarily cease also; but if the essence of one could be destroyed,
and be made false, the essence of the other would be destroyed also.  The  reasoning would
be identical in the case of the will, as anyone can easily see.
