THE END OF THE TETHER

By Joseph Conrad

I

For a long time after the course of the steamer Sofala had been altered for the land, the low
swampy coast had retained its appearance of a mere smudge of darkness beyond a belt of glitter.
The sunrays seemed to fall violently upon the calm sea--seemed to shatter themselves upon an
adamantine surface into sparkling dust, into a dazzling vapor of light that blinded the eye
and wearied the brain with its unsteady brightness.

Captain Whalley did not look at it. When his Serang, approaching the roomy cane arm-chair which
he filled capably, had informed him in a low voice that the course was to be altered, he had
risen at once and had remained on his feet, face forward, while the head of his ship swung
through a quarter of a circle. He had not uttered a single word, not even the word to steady
the helm. It was the Serang, an elderly, alert, little Malay, with a very dark skin, who murmured
the order to the helmsman. And then slowly Captain Whalley sat down again in the arm-chair
on the bridge and fixed his eyes on the deck between his feet.

He could not hope to see anything new upon this lane of the sea. He had been on these coasts
for the last three years. From Low Cape to Malantan the distance was fifty miles, six hours'
steaming for the old ship with the tide, or seven against. Then you steered straight for the
land, and by-and-by three palms would appear on the sky, tall and slim, and with their disheveled
heads in a bunch, as if in confidential criticism of the dark mangroves. The Sofala would be
headed towards the somber strip of the coast, which at a given moment, as the ship closed with
it obliquely, would show several clean shining fractures--the brimful estuary of a river. Then
on through a brown liquid, three parts water and one part black earth, on and on between the
low shores, three parts black earth and one part brackish water, the Sofala would plow her
way up-stream, as she had done once every month for these seven years or more, long before
he was aware of her existence, long before he had ever thought of having anything to do with
her and her invariable voyages. The old ship ought to have known the road better than her men,
who had not been kept so long at it without a change; better than the faithful Serang, whom
he had brought over from his last ship to keep the captain's watch; better than he himself,
who had been her captain for the last three years only. She could always be depended upon to
make her courses. Her compasses were never out. She was no trouble at all to take about, as
if her great age had given her knowledge, wisdom, and steadiness. She made her landfalls to
a degree of the bearing, and almost to a minute of her allowed time. At any moment, as he sat
on the bridge without looking up, or lay sleepless in his bed, simply by reckoning the days
and the hours he could tell where he was--the precise spot of the beat. He knew it well too,
this monotonous huckster's round, up and down the Straits; he knew its order and its sights
and its people. Malacca to begin with, in at daylight and out at dusk, to cross over with a
rigid phosphorescent wake this highway of the Far East. Darkness and gleams on the water, clear
stars on a black sky, perhaps the lights of a home steamer keeping her unswerving course in
the middle, or maybe the elusive shadow of a native craft with her mat sails flitting by silently--and
the low land on the other side in sight at daylight. At noon the three palms of the next place
of call, up a sluggish river. The only white man residing there was a retired young sailor,
with whom he had become friendly in the course of many voyages. Sixty miles farther on there
was another place of call, a deep bay with only a couple of houses on the beach. And so on,
in and out, picking up coastwise cargo here and there, and finishing with a hundred miles'
steady steaming through the maze of an archipelago of small islands up to a large native town
at the end of the beat. There was a three days' rest for the old ship before he started her
again in inverse order, seeing the same shores from another bearing, hearing the same voices
in the same places, back again to the Sofala's port of registry on the great highway to the
East, where he would take up a berth nearly opposite the big stone pile of the harbor office
till it was time to start again on the old round of 1600 miles and thirty days. Not a very
enterprising life, this, for Captain Whalley, Henry Whalley, otherwise Dare-devil Harry--Whalley
of the Condor, a famous clipper in her day. No. Not a very enterprising life for a man who
had served famous firms, who had sailed famous ships (more than one or two of them his own);
who had made famous passages, had been the pioneer of new routes and new trades; who had steered
across the unsurveyed tracts of the South Seas, and had seen the sun rise on uncharted islands.
Fifty years at sea, and forty out in the East ("a pretty thorough apprenticeship," he used
to remark smilingly), had made him honorably known to a generation of shipowners and merchants
in all the ports from Bombay clear over to where the East merges into the West upon the coast
of the two Americas. His fame remained writ, not very large but plain enough, on the Admiralty
charts. Was there not somewhere between Australia and China a Whalley Island and a Condor Reef?
On that dangerous coral formation the celebrated clipper had hung stranded for three days,
her captain and crew throwing her cargo overboard with one hand and with the other, as it were,
keeping off her a flotilla of savage war-canoes. At that time neither the island nor the reef
had any official existence. Later the officers of her Majesty's steam vessel Fusilier, dispatched
to make a survey of the route, recognized in the adoption of these two names the enterprise
of the man and the solidity of the ship. Besides, as anyone who cares may see, the "General
Directory," vol. ii. p. 410, begins the description of the "Malotu or Whalley Passage" with
the words: "This advantageous route, first discovered in 1850 by Captain Whalley in the ship
Condor," &c., and ends by recommending it warmly to sailing vessels leaving the China ports
for the south in the months from December to April inclusive.

This was the clearest gain he had out of life. Nothing could rob him of this kind of fame.
The piercing of the Isthmus of Suez, like the breaking of a dam, had let in upon the East a
flood of new ships, new men, new methods of trade. It had changed the face of the Eastern seas
and the very spirit of their life; so that his early experiences meant nothing whatever to
the new generation of seamen.

In those bygone days he had handled many thousands of pounds of his employers' money and of
his own; he had attended faithfully, as by law a shipmaster is expected to do, to the conflicting
interests of owners, charterers, and underwriters. He had never lost a ship or consented to
a shady transaction; and he had lasted well, outlasting in the end the conditions that had
gone to the making of his name. He had buried his wife (in the Gulf of Petchili), had married
off his daughter to the man of her unlucky choice, and had lost more than an ample competence
in the crash of the notorious Travancore and Deccan Banking Corporation, whose downfall had
shaken the East like an earthquake. And he was sixty-five years old.

II

His age sat lightly enough on him; and of his ruin he was not ashamed. He had not been alone
to believe in the stability of the Banking Corporation. Men whose judgment in matters of finance
was as expert as his seamanship had commended the prudence of his investments, and had themselves
lost much money in the great failure. The only difference between him and them was that he
had lost his all. And yet not his all. There had remained to him from his lost fortune a very
pretty little bark, Fair Maid, which he had bought to occupy his leisure of a retired sailor--"to
play with," as he expressed it himself.

He had formally declared himself tired of the sea the year preceding his daughter's marriage.
But after the young couple had gone to settle in Melbourne he found out that he could not make
himself happy on shore. He was too much of a merchant sea-captain for mere yachting to satisfy
him. He wanted the illusion of affairs; and his acquisition of the Fair Maid preserved the
continuity of his life. He introduced her to his acquaintances in various ports as "my last
command." When he grew too old to be trusted with a ship, he would lay her up and go ashore
to be buried, leaving directions in his will to have the bark towed out and scuttled decently
in deep water on the day of the funeral. His daughter would not grudge him the satisfaction
of knowing that no stranger would handle his last command after him. With the fortune he was
able to leave her, the value of a 500-ton bark was neither here nor there. All this would be
said with a jocular twinkle in his eye: the vigorous old man had too much vitality for the
sentimentalism of regret; and a little wistfully withal, because he was at home in life, taking
a genuine pleasure in its feelings and its possessions; in the dignity of his reputation and
his wealth, in his love for his daughter, and in his satisfaction with the ship--the plaything
of his lonely leisure.

He had the cabin arranged in accordance with his simple ideal of comfort at sea. A big bookcase
(he was a great reader) occupied one side of his stateroom; the portrait of his late wife,
a flat bituminous oil-painting representing the profile and one long black ringlet of a young
woman, faced his bed-place. Three chronometers ticked him to sleep and greeted him on waking
with the tiny competition of their beats. He rose at five every day. The officer of the morning
watch, drinking his early cup of coffee aft by the wheel, would hear through the wide orifice
of the copper ventilators all the splashings, blowings, and splutterings of his captain's toilet.
These noises would be followed by a sustained deep murmur of the Lord's Prayer recited in a
loud earnest voice. Five minutes afterwards the head and shoulders of Captain Whalley emerged
out of the companion-hatchway. Invariably he paused for a while on the stairs, looking all
round at the horizon; upwards at the trim of the sails; inhaling deep draughts of the fresh
air. Only then he would step out on the poop, acknowledging the hand raised to the peak of
the cap with a majestic and benign "Good morning to you." He walked the deck till eight scrupulously.
Sometimes, not above twice a year, he had to use a thick cudgel-like stick on account of a
stiffness in the hip--a slight touch of rheumatism, he supposed. Otherwise he knew nothing
of the ills of the flesh. At the ringing of the breakfast bell he went below to feed his canaries,
wind up the chronometers, and take the head of the table. From there he had before his eyes
the big carbon photographs of his daughter, her husband, and two fat-legged babies --his grandchildren--set
in black frames into the maplewood bulkheads of the cuddy. After breakfast he dusted the glass
over these portraits himself with a cloth, and brushed the oil painting of his wife with a
plumate kept suspended from a small brass hook by the side of the heavy gold frame. Then with
the door of his stateroom shut, he would sit down on the couch under the portrait to read a
chapter out of a thick pocket Bible--her Bible. But on some days he only sat there for half
an hour with his finger between the leaves and the closed book resting on his knees. Perhaps
he had remembered suddenly how fond of boat-sailing she used to be.

She had been a real shipmate and a true woman too. It was like an article of faith with him
that there never had been, and never could be, a brighter, cheerier home anywhere afloat or
ashore than his home under the poop-deck of the Condor, with the big main cabin all white and
gold, garlanded as if for a perpetual festival with an unfading wreath. She had decorated the
center of every panel with a cluster of home flowers. It took her a twelvemonth to go round
the cuddy with this labor of love. To him it had remained a marvel of painting, the highest
achievement of taste and skill; and as to old Swinburne, his mate, every time he came down
to his meals he stood transfixed with admiration before the progress of the work. You could
almost smell these roses, he declared, sniffing the faint flavor of turpentine which at that
time pervaded the saloon, and (as he confessed afterwards) made him somewhat less hearty than
usual in tackling his food. But there was nothing of the sort to interfere with his enjoyment
of her singing. "Mrs. Whalley is a regular out-and-out nightingale, sir," he would pronounce
with a judicial air after listening profoundly over the skylight to the very end of the piece.
In fine weather, in the second dog-watch, the two men could hear her trills and roulades going
on to the accompaniment of the piano in the cabin. On the very day they got engaged he had
written to London for the instrument; but they had been married for over a year before it reached
them, coming out round the Cape. The big case made part of the first direct general cargo landed
in Hong-kong harbor--an event that to the men who walked the busy quays of to-day seemed as
hazily remote as the dark ages of history. But Captain Whalley could in a half hour of solitude
live again all his life, with its romance, its idyl, and its sorrow. He had to close her eyes
himself. She went away from under the ensign like a sailor's wife, a sailor herself at heart.
He had read the service over her, out of her own prayer-book, without a break in his voice.
When he raised his eyes he could see old Swinburne facing him with his cap pressed to his breast,
and his rugged, weather-beaten, impassive face streaming with drops of water like a lump of
chipped red granite in a shower. It was all very well for that old sea-dog to cry. He had to
read on to the end; but after the splash he did not remember much of what happened for the
next few days. An elderly sailor of the crew, deft at needlework, put together a mourning frock
for the child out of one of her black skirts.

He was not likely to forget; but you cannot dam up life like a sluggish stream. It will break
out and flow over a man's troubles, it will close upon a sorrow like the sea upon a dead body,
no matter how much love has gone to the bottom. And the world is not bad. People had been very
kind to him; especially Mrs. Gardner, the wife of the senior partner in Gardner, Patteson,
& Co., the owners of the Condor. It was she who volunteered to look after the little one, and
in due course took her to England (something of a journey in those days, even by the overland
mail route) with her own girls to finish her education. It was ten years before he saw her again.

As a little child she had never been frightened of bad weather; she would beg to be taken up
on deck in the bosom of his oilskin coat to watch the big seas hurling themselves upon the
Condor. The swirl and crash of the waves seemed to fill her small soul with a breathless delight.
"A good boy spoiled," he used to say of her in joke. He had named her Ivy because of the sound
of the word, and obscurely fascinated by a vague association of ideas. She had twined herself
tightly round his heart, and he intended her to cling close to her father as to a tower of
strength; forgetting, while she was little, that in the nature of things she would probably
elect to cling to someone else. But he loved life well enough for even that event to give him
a certain satisfaction, apart from his more intimate feeling of loss.

After he had purchased the Fair Maid to occupy his loneliness, he hastened to accept a rather
unprofitable freight to Australia simply for the opportunity of seeing his daughter in her
own home. What made him dissatisfied there was not to see that she clung now to somebody else,
but that the prop she had selected seemed on closer examination "a rather poor stick"--even
in the matter of health. He disliked his son-in-law's studied civility perhaps more than his
method of handling the sum of money he had given Ivy at her marriage. But of his apprehensions
he said nothing. Only on the day of his departure, with the hall-door open already, holding
her hands and looking steadily into her eyes, he had said, "You know, my dear, all I have is
for you and the chicks. Mind you write to me openly." She had answered him by an almost imperceptible
movement of her head. She resembled her mother in the color of her eyes, and in character--and
also in this, that she understood him without many words.

Sure enough she had to write; and some of these letters made Captain Whalley lift his white
eye-brows. For the rest he considered he was reaping the true reward of his life by being thus
able to produce on demand whatever was needed. He had not enjoyed himself so much in a way
since his wife had died. Characteristically enough his son-in-law's punctuality in failure
caused him at a distance to feel a sort of kindness towards the man. The fellow was so perpetually
being jammed on a lee shore that to charge it all to his reckless navigation would be manifestly
unfair. No, no! He knew well what that meant. It was bad luck. His own had been simply marvelous,
but he had seen in his life too many good men--seamen and others--go under with the sheer weight
of bad luck not to recognize the fatal signs. For all that, he was cogitating on the best way
of tying up very strictly every penny he had to leave, when, with a preliminary rumble of rumors
(whose first sound reached him in Shanghai as it happened), the shock of the big failure came;
and, after passing through the phases of stupor, of incredulity, of indignation, he had to
accept the fact that he had nothing to speak of to leave.

Upon that, as if he had only waited for this catastrophe, the unlucky man, away there in Melbourne,
gave up his unprofitable game, and sat down--in an invalid's bath-chair at that too. "He will
never walk again," wrote the wife. For the first time in his life Captain Whalley was a bit
staggered.

The Fair Maid had to go to work in bitter earnest now. It was no longer a matter of preserving
alive the memory of Dare-devil Harry Whalley in the Eastern Seas, or of keeping an old man
in pocket-money and clothes, with, perhaps, a bill for a few hundred first-class cigars thrown
in at the end of the year. He would have to buckle-to, and keep her going hard on a scant allowance
of gilt for the ginger-bread scrolls at her stem and stern.

This necessity opened his eyes to the fundamental changes of the world. Of his past only the
familiar names remained, here and there, but the things and the men, as he had known them,
were gone. The name of Gardner, Patteson, & Co. was still displayed on the walls of warehouses
by the waterside, on the brass plates and window-panes in the business quarters of more than
one Eastern port, but there was no longer a Gardner or a Patteson in the firm. There was no
longer for Captain Whalley an arm-chair and a welcome in the private office, with a bit of
business ready to be put in the way of an old friend, for the sake of bygone services. The
husbands of the Gardner girls sat behind the desks in that room where, long after he had left
the employ, he had kept his right of entrance in the old man's time. Their ships now had yellow
funnels with black tops, and a time-table of appointed routes like a confounded service of
tramways. The winds of December and June were all one to them; their captains (excellent young
men he doubted not) were, to be sure, familiar with Whalley Island, because of late years the
Government had established a white fixed light on the north end (with a red danger sector over
the Condor Reef), but most of them would have been extremely surprised to hear that a flesh-and-blood
Whalley still existed--an old man going about the world trying to pick up a cargo here and
there for his little bark.

And everywhere it was the same. Departed the men who would have nodded appreciatively at the
mention of his name, and would have thought themselves bound in honor to do something for Dare-devil
Harry Whalley. Departed the opportunities which he would have known how to seize; and gone
with them the white-winged flock of clippers that lived in the boisterous uncertain life of
the winds, skimming big fortunes out of the foam of the sea. In a world that pared down the
profits to an irreducible minimum, in a world that was able to count its disengaged tonnage
twice over every day, and in which lean charters were snapped up by cable three months in advance,
there were no chances of fortune for an individual wandering haphazard with a little bark--hardly
indeed any room to exist.

He found it more difficult from year to year. He suffered greatly from the smallness of remittances
he was able to send his daughter. Meantime he had given up good cigars, and even in the matter
of inferior cheroots limited himself to six a day. He never told her of his difficulties, and
she never enlarged upon her struggle to live. Their confidence in each other needed no explanations,
and their perfect understanding endured without protestations of gratitude or regret. He would
have been shocked if she had taken it into her head to thank him in so many words, but he found
it perfectly natural that she should tell him she needed two hundred pounds.

He had come in with the Fair Maid in ballast to look for a freight in the Sofala's port of
registry, and her letter met him there. Its tenor was that it was no use mincing matters. Her
only resource was in opening a boarding-house, for which the prospects, she judged, were good.
Good enough, at any rate, to make her tell him frankly that with two hundred pounds she could
make a start. He had torn the envelope open, hastily, on deck, where it was handed to him by
the ship-chandler's runner, who had brought his mail at the moment of anchoring. For the second
time in his life he was appalled, and remained stock-still at the cabin door with the paper
trembling between his fingers. Open a boarding-house! Two hundred pounds for a start! The only
resource! And he did not know where to lay his hands on two hundred pence.

All that night Captain Whalley walked the poop of his anchored ship, as though he had been
about to close with the land in thick weather, and uncertain of his position after a run of
many gray days without a sight of sun, moon, or stars. The black night twinkled with the guiding
lights of seamen and the steady straight lines of lights on shore; and all around the Fair
Maid the riding lights of ships cast trembling trails upon the water of the roadstead. Captain
Whalley saw not a gleam anywhere till the dawn broke and he found out that his clothing was
soaked through with the heavy dew.

His ship was awake. He stopped short, stroked his wet beard, and descended the poop ladder
backwards, with tired feet. At the sight of him the chief officer, lounging about sleepily
on the quarterdeck, remained open-mouthed in the middle of a great early-morning yawn.

"Good morning to you," pronounced Captain Whalley solemnly, passing into the cabin. But he
checked himself in the doorway, and without looking back, "By the bye," he said, "there should
be an empty wooden case put away in the lazarette. It has not been broken up--has it?"

The mate shut his mouth, and then asked as if dazed, "What empty case, sir?"

"A big flat packing-case belonging to that painting in my room. Let it be taken up on deck
and tell the carpenter to look it over. I may want to use it before long."

The chief officer did not stir a limb till he had heard the door of the captain's state-room
slam within the cuddy. Then he beckoned aft the second mate with his forefinger to tell him
that there was something "in the wind."

When the bell rang Captain Whalley's authoritative voice boomed out through a closed door,
"Sit down and don't wait for me." And his impressed officers took their places, exchanging
looks and whispers across the table. What! No breakfast? And after apparently knocking about
all night on deck, too! Clearly, there was something in the wind. In the skylight above their
heads, bowed earnestly over the plates, three wire cages rocked and rattled to the restless
jumping of the hungry canaries; and they could detect the sounds of their "old man's" deliberate
movements within his state-room. Captain Whalley was methodically winding up the chronometers,
dusting the portrait of his late wife, getting a clean white shirt out of the drawers, making
himself ready in his punctilious unhurried manner to go ashore. He could not have swallowed
a single mouthful of food that morning. He had made up his mind to sell the Fair Maid.

III

Just at that time the Japanese were casting far and wide for ships of European build, and he
had no difficulty in finding a purchaser, a speculator who drove a hard bargain, but paid cash
down for the Fair Maid, with a view to a profitable resale. Thus it came about that Captain
Whalley found himself on a certain afternoon descending the steps of one of the most important
post-offices of the East with a slip of bluish paper in his hand. This was the receipt of a
registered letter enclosing a draft for two hundred pounds, and addressed to Melbourne. Captain
Whalley pushed the paper into his waistcoat-pocket, took his stick from under his arm, and
walked down the street.

It was a recently opened and untidy thoroughfare with rudimentary side-walks and a soft layer
of dust cushioning the whole width of the road. One end touched the slummy street of Chinese
shops near the harbor, the other drove straight on, without houses, for a couple of miles,
through patches of jungle-like vegetation, to the yard gates of the new Consolidated Docks
Company. The crude frontages of the new Government buildings alternated with the blank fencing
of vacant plots, and the view of the sky seemed to give an added spaciousness to the broad
vista. It was empty and shunned by natives after business hours, as though they had expected
to see one of the tigers from the neighborhood of the New Waterworks on the hill coming at
a loping canter down the middle to get a Chinese shopkeeper for supper. Captain Whalley was
not dwarfed by the solitude of the grandly planned street. He had too fine a presence for that.
He was only a lonely figure walking purposefully, with a great white beard like a pilgrim,
and with a thick stick that resembled a weapon. On one side the new Courts of Justice had a
low and unadorned portico of squat columns half concealed by a few old trees left in the approach.
On the other the pavilion wings of the new Colonial Treasury came out to the line of the street.
But Captain Whalley, who had now no ship and no home, remembered in passing that on that very
site when he first came out from England there had stood a fishing village, a few mat huts
erected on piles between a muddy tidal creek and a miry pathway that went writhing into a tangled
wilderness without any docks or waterworks.

No ship--no home. And his poor Ivy away there had no home either. A boarding-house is no sort
of home though it may get you a living. His feelings were horribly rasped by the idea of the
boarding-house. In his rank of life he had that truly aristocratic temperament characterized
by a scorn of vulgar gentility and by prejudiced views as to the derogatory nature of certain
occupations. For his own part he had always preferred sailing merchant ships (which is a straightforward
occupation) to buying and selling merchandise, of which the essence is to get the better of
somebody in a bargain--an undignified trial of wits at best. His father had been Colonel Whalley
(retired) of the H. E. I. Company's service, with very slender means besides his pension, but
with distinguished connections. He could remember as a boy how frequently waiters at the inns,
country tradesmen and small people of that sort, used to "My lord" the old warrior on the strength
of his appearance.

Captain Whalley himself (he would have entered the Navy if his father had not died before he
was fourteen) had something of a grand air which would have suited an old and glorious admiral;
but he became lost like a straw in the eddy of a brook amongst the swarm of brown and yellow
humanity filling a thoroughfare, that by contrast with the vast and empty avenue he had left
seemed as narrow as a lane and absolutely riotous with life. The walls of the houses were blue;
the shops of the Chinamen yawned like cavernous lairs; heaps of nondescript merchandise overflowed
the gloom of the long range of arcades, and the fiery serenity of sunset took the middle of
the street from end to end with a glow like the reflection of a fire. It fell on the bright
colors and the dark faces of the bare-footed crowd, on the pallid yellow backs of the half-naked
jostling coolies, on the accouterments of a tall Sikh trooper with a parted beard and fierce
mustaches on sentry before the gate of the police compound. Looming very big above the heads
in a red haze of dust, the tightly packed car of the cable tramway navigated cautiously up
the human stream, with the incessant blare of its horn, in the manner of a steamer groping
in a fog.

Captain Whalley emerged like a diver on the other side, and in the desert shade between the
walls of closed warehouses removed his hat to cool his brow. A certain disrepute attached to
the calling of a landlady of a boarding-house. These women were said to be rapacious, unscrupulous,
untruthful; and though he contemned no class of his fellow-creatures--God forbid!--these were
suspicions to which it was unseemly that a Whalley should lay herself open. He had not expostulated
with her, however. He was confident she shared his feelings; he was sorry for her; he trusted
her judgment; he considered it a merciful dispensation that he could help her once more,--but
in his aristocratic heart of hearts he would have found it more easy to reconcile himself to
the idea of her turning seamstress. Vaguely he remembered reading years ago a touching piece
called the "Song of the Shirt." It was all very well making songs about poor women. The granddaughter
of Colonel Whalley, the landlady of a boarding-house! Pooh! He replaced his hat, dived into
two pockets, and stopping a moment to apply a flaring match to the end of a cheap cheroot,
blew an embittered cloud of smoke at a world that could hold such surprises.

Of one thing he was certain--that she was the own child of a clever mother. Now he had got
over the wrench of parting with his ship, he perceived clearly that such a step had been unavoidable.
Perhaps he had been growing aware of it all along with an unconfessed knowledge. But she, far
away there, must have had an intuitive perception of it, with the pluck to face that truth
and the courage to speak out--all the qualities which had made her mother a woman of such excellent
counsel.

It would have had to come to that in the end! It was fortunate she had forced his hand. In
another year or two it would have been an utterly barren sale. To keep the ship going he had
been involving himself deeper every year. He was defenseless before the insidious work of adversity,
to whose more open assaults he could present a firm front; like a cliff that stands unmoved
the open battering of the sea, with a lofty ignorance of the treacherous backwash undermining
its base. As it was, every liability satisfied, her request answered, and owing no man a penny,
there remained to him from the proceeds a sum of five hundred pounds put away safely. In addition
he had upon his person some forty odd dollars--enough to pay his hotel bill, providing he did
not linger too long in the modest bedroom where he had taken refuge.

Scantily furnished, and with a waxed floor, it opened into one of the side-verandas. The straggling
building of bricks, as airy as a bird-cage, resounded with the incessant flapping of rattan
screens worried by the wind between the white-washed square pillars of the sea-front. The rooms
were lofty, a ripple of sunshine flowed over the ceilings; and the periodical invasions of
tourists from some passenger steamer in the harbor flitted through the wind-swept dusk of the
apartments with the tumult of their unfamiliar voices and impermanent presences, like relays
of migratory shades condemned to speed headlong round the earth without leaving a trace. The
babble of their irruptions ebbed out as suddenly as it had arisen; the draughty corridors and
the long chairs of the verandas knew their sight-seeing hurry or their prostrate repose no
more; and Captain Whalley, substantial and dignified, left well-nigh alone in the vast hotel
by each light-hearted skurry, felt more and more like a stranded tourist with no aim in view,
like a forlorn traveler without a home. In the solitude of his room he smoked thoughtfully,
gazing at the two sea-chests which held all that he could call his own in this world. A thick
roll of charts in a sheath of sailcloth leaned in a corner; the flat packing-case containing
the portrait in oils and the three carbon photographs had been pushed under the bed. He was
tired of discussing terms, of assisting at surveys, of all the routine of the business. What
to the other parties was merely the sale of a ship was to him a momentous event involving a
radically new view of existence. He knew that after this ship there would be no other; and
the hopes of his youth, the exercise of his abilities, every feeling and achievement of his
manhood, had been indissolubly connected with ships. He had served ships; he had owned ships;
and even the years of his actual retirement from the sea had been made bearable by the idea
that he had only to stretch out his hand full of money to get a ship. He had been at liberty
to feel as though he were the owner of all the ships in the world. The selling of this one
was weary work; but when she passed from him at last, when he signed the last receipt, it was
as though all the ships had gone out of the world together, leaving him on the shore of inaccessible
oceans with seven hundred pounds in his hands.

Striding firmly, without haste, along the quay, Captain Whalley averted his glances from the
familiar roadstead. Two generations of seamen born since his first day at sea stood between
him and all these ships at the anchorage. His own was sold, and he had been asking himself,
What next?

From the feeling of loneliness, of inward emptiness,--and of loss too, as if his very soul
had been taken out of him forcibly,--there had sprung at first a desire to start right off
and join his daughter. "Here are the last pence," he would say to her; "take them, my dear.
And here's your old father: you must take him too."

His soul recoiled, as if afraid of what lay hidden at the bottom of this impulse. Give up!
Never! When one is thoroughly weary all sorts of nonsense come into one's head. A pretty gift
it would have been for a poor woman--this seven hundred pounds with the incumbrance of a hale
old fellow more than likely to last for years and years to come. Was he not as fit to die in
harness as any of the youngsters in charge of these anchored ships out yonder? He was as solid
now as ever he had been. But as to who would give him work to do, that was another matter.
Were he, with his appearance and antecedents, to go about looking for a junior's berth, people,
he was afraid, would not take him seriously; or else if he succeeded in impressing them, he
would maybe obtain their pity, which would be like stripping yourself naked to be kicked. He
was not anxious to give himself away for less than nothing. He had no use for anybody's pity.
On the other hand, a command--the only thing he could try for with due regard for common decency--was
not likely to be lying in wait for him at the corner of the next street. Commands don't go
a-begging nowadays. Ever since he had come ashore to carry out the business of the sale he
had kept his ears open, but had heard no hint of one being vacant in the port. And even if
there had been one, his successful past itself stood in his way. He had been his own employer
too long. The only credential he could produce was the testimony of his whole life. What better
recommendation could anyone require? But vaguely he felt that the unique document would be
looked upon as an archaic curiosity of the Eastern waters, a screed traced in obsolete words--in
a half-forgotten language.

IV

Revolving these thoughts, he strolled on near the railings of the quay, broad-chested, without
a stoop, as though his big shoulders had never felt the burden of the loads that must be carried
between the cradle and the grave. No single betraying fold or line of care disfigured the reposeful
modeling of his face. It was full and untanned; and the upper part emerged, massively quiet,
out of the downward flow of silvery hair, with the striking delicacy of its clear complexion
and the powerful width of the forehead. The first cast of his glance fell on you candid and
swift, like a boy's; but because of the ragged snowy thatch of the eyebrows the affability
of his attention acquired the character of a dark and searching scrutiny. With age he had put
on flesh a little, had increased his girth like an old tree presenting no symptoms of decay;
and even the opulent, lustrous ripple of white hairs upon his chest seemed an attribute of
unquenchable vitality and vigor.

Once rather proud of his great bodily strength, and even of his personal appearance, conscious
of his worth, and firm in his rectitude, there had remained to him, like the heritage of departed
prosperity, the tranquil bearing of a man who had proved himself fit in every sort of way for
the life of his choice. He strode on squarely under the projecting brim of an ancient Panama
hat. It had a low crown, a crease through its whole diameter, a narrow black ribbon. Imperishable
and a little discolored, this headgear made it easy to pick him out from afar on thronged wharves
and in the busy streets. He had never adopted the comparatively modern fashion of pipeclayed
cork helmets. He disliked the form; and he hoped he could manage to keep a cool head to the
end of his life without all these contrivances for hygienic ventilation. His hair was cropped
close, his linen always of immaculate whiteness; a suit of thin gray flannel, worn threadbare
but scrupulously brushed, floated about his burly limbs, adding to his bulk by the looseness
of its cut. The years had mellowed the good-humored, imperturbable audacity of his prime into
a temper carelessly serene; and the leisurely tapping of his iron-shod stick accompanied his
footfalls with a self-confident sound on the flagstones. It was impossible to connect such
a fine presence and this unruffled aspect with the belittling troubles of poverty; the man's
whole existence appeared to pass before you, facile and large, in the freedom of means as ample
as the clothing of his body.

The irrational dread of having to break into his five hundred pounds for personal expenses
in the hotel disturbed the steady poise of his mind. There was no time to lose. The bill was
running up. He nourished the hope that this five hundred would perhaps be the means, if everything
else failed, of obtaining some work which, keeping his body and soul together (not a matter
of great outlay), would enable him to be of use to his daughter. To his mind it was her own
money which he employed, as it were, in backing her father and solely for her benefit. Once
at work, he would help her with the greater part of his earnings; he was good for many years
yet, and this boarding-house business, he argued to himself, whatever the prospects, could
not be much of a gold-mine from the first start. But what work? He was ready to lay hold of
anything in an honest way so that it came quickly to his hand; because the five hundred pounds
must be preserved intact for eventual use. That was the great point. With the entire five hundred
one felt a substance at one's back; but it seemed to him that should he let it dwindle to four-fifty
or even four-eighty, all the efficiency would be gone out of the money, as though there were
some magic power in the round figure. But what sort of work?

Confronted by that haunting question as by an uneasy ghost, for whom he had no exorcising formula,
Captain Whalley stopped short on the apex of a small bridge spanning steeply the bed of a canalized
creek with granite shores. Moored between the square blocks a seagoing Malay prau floated half
hidden under the arch of masonry, with her spars lowered down, without a sound of life on board,
and covered from stem to stern with a ridge of palm-leaf mats. He had left behind him the overheated
pavements bordered by the stone frontages that, like the sheer face of cliffs, followed the
sweep of the quays; and an unconfined spaciousness of orderly and sylvan aspect opened before
him its wide plots of rolled grass, like pieces of green carpet smoothly pegged out, its long
ranges of trees lined up in colossal porticos of dark shafts roofed with a vault of branches.

Some of these avenues ended at the sea. It was a terraced shore; and beyond, upon the level
expanse, profound and glistening like the gaze of a dark-blue eye, an oblique band of stippled
purple lengthened itself indefinitely through the gap between a couple of verdant twin islets.
The masts and spars of a few ships far away, hull down in the outer roads, sprang straight
from the water in a fine maze of rosy lines penciled on the clear shadow of the eastern board.
Captain Whalley gave them a long glance. The ship, once his own, was anchored out there. It
was staggering to think that it was open to him no longer to take a boat at the jetty and get
himself pulled off to her when the evening came. To no ship. Perhaps never more. Before the
sale was concluded, and till the purchase-money had been paid, he had spent daily some time
on board the Fair Maid. The money had been paid this very morning, and now, all at once, there
was positively no ship that he could go on board of when he liked; no ship that would need
his presence in order to do her work--to live. It seemed an incredible state of affairs, something
too bizarre to last. And the sea was full of craft of all sorts. There was that prau lying
so still swathed in her shroud of sewn palm-leaves--she too had her indispensable man. They
lived through each other, this Malay he had never seen, and this high-sterned thing of no size
that seemed to be resting after a long journey. And of all the ships in sight, near and far,
each was provided with a man, the man without whom the finest ship is a dead thing, a floating
and purposeless log.

After his one glance at the roadstead he went on, since there was nothing to turn back for,
and the time must be got through somehow. The avenues of big trees ran straight over the Esplanade,
cutting each other at diverse angles, columnar below and luxuriant above. The interlaced boughs
high up there seemed to slumber; not a leaf stirred overhead: and the reedy cast-iron lampposts
in the middle of the road, gilt like scepters, diminished in a long perspective, with their
globes of white porcelain atop, resembling a barbarous decoration of ostriches' eggs displayed
in a row. The flaming sky kindled a tiny crimson spark upon the glistening surface of each
glassy shell.

With his chin sunk a little, his hands behind his back, and the end of his stick marking the
gravel with a faint wavering line at his heels, Captain Whalley reflected that if a ship without
a man was like a body without a soul, a sailor without a ship was of not much more account
in this world than an aimless log adrift upon the sea. The log might be sound enough by itself,
tough of fiber, and hard to destroy--but what of that! And a sudden sense of irremediable idleness
weighted his feet like a great fatigue.

A succession of open carriages came bowling along the newly opened sea-road. You could see
across the wide grass-plots the discs of vibration made by the spokes. The bright domes of
the parasols swayed lightly outwards like full-blown blossoms on the rim of a vase; and the
quiet sheet of dark-blue water, crossed by a bar of purple, made a background for the spinning
wheels and the high action of the horses, whilst the turbaned heads of the Indian servants
elevated above the line of the sea horizon glided rapidly on the paler blue of the sky. In
an open space near the little bridge each turn-out trotted smartly in a wide curve away from
the sunset; then pulling up sharp, entered the main alley in a long slow-moving file with the
great red stillness of the sky at the back. The trunks of mighty trees stood all touched with
red on the same side, the air seemed aflame under the high foliage, the very ground under the
hoofs of the horses was red. The wheels turned solemnly; one after another the sunshades drooped,
folding their colors like gorgeous flowers shutting their petals at the end of the day. In
the whole half-mile of human beings no voice uttered a distinct word, only a faint thudding
noise went on mingled with slight jingling sounds, and the motionless heads and shoulders of
men and women sitting in couples emerged stolidly above the lowered hoods--as if wooden. But
one carriage and pair coming late did not join the line.

It fled along in a noiseless roll; but on entering the avenue one of the dark bays snorted,
arching his neck and shying against the steel-tipped pole; a flake of foam fell from the bit
upon the point of a satiny shoulder, and the dusky face of the coachman leaned forward at once
over the hands taking a fresh grip of the reins. It was a long dark-green landau, having a
dignified and buoyant motion between the sharply curved C-springs, and a sort of strictly official
majesty in its supreme elegance. It seemed more roomy than is usual, its horses seemed slightly
bigger, the appointments a shade more perfect, the servants perched somewhat higher on the
box. The dresses of three women--two young and pretty, and one, handsome, large, of mature
age--seemed to fill completely the shallow body of the carriage. The fourth face was that of
a man, heavy lidded, distinguished and sallow, with a somber, thick, iron-gray imperial and
mustaches, which somehow had the air of solid appendages. His Excellency--

The rapid motion of that one equipage made all the others appear utterly inferior, blighted,
and reduced to crawl painfully at a snail's pace. The landau distanced the whole file in a
sort of sustained rush; the features of the occupant whirling out of sight left behind an impression
of fixed stares and impassive vacancy; and after it had vanished in full flight as it were,
notwithstanding the long line of vehicles hugging the curb at a walk, the whole lofty vista
of the avenue seemed to lie open and emptied of life in the enlarged impression of an august
solitude.

Captain Whalley had lifted his head to look, and his mind, disturbed in its meditation, turned
with wonder (as men's minds will do) to matters of no importance. It struck him that it was
to this port, where he had just sold his last ship, that he had come with the very first he
had ever owned, and with his head full of a plan for opening a new trade with a distant part
of the Archipelago. The then governor had given him no end of encouragement. No Excellency
he--this Mr. Denham--this governor with his jacket off; a man who tended night and day, so
to speak, the growing prosperity of the settlement with the self-forgetful devotion of a nurse
for a child she loves; a lone bachelor who lived as in a camp with the few servants and his
three dogs in what was called then the Government Bungalow: a low-roofed structure on the half-cleared
slope of a hill, with a new flagstaff in front and a police orderly on the veranda. He remembered
toiling up that hill under a heavy sun for his audience; the unfurnished aspect of the cool
shaded room; the long table covered at one end with piles of papers, and with two guns, a brass
telescope, a small bottle of oil with a feather stuck in the neck at the other--and the flattering
attention given to him by the man in power. It was an undertaking full of risk he had come
to expound, but a twenty minutes' talk in the Government Bungalow on the hill had made it go
smoothly from the start. And as he was retiring Mr. Denham, already seated before the papers,
called out after him, "Next month the Dido starts for a cruise that way, and I shall request
her captain officially to give you a look in and see how you get on." The Dido was one of the
smart frigates on the China station--and five-and-thirty years make a big slice of time. Five-and-thirty
years ago an enterprise like his had for the colony enough importance to be looked after by
a Queen's ship. A big slice of time. Individuals were of some account then. Men like himself;
men, too, like poor Evans, for instance, with his red face, his coal-black whiskers, and his
restless eyes, who had set up the first patent slip for repairing small ships, on the edge
of the forest, in a lonely bay three miles up the coast. Mr. Denham had encouraged that enterprise
too, and yet somehow poor Evans had ended by dying at home deucedly hard up. His son, they
said, was squeezing oil out of cocoa-nuts for a living on some God-forsaken islet of the Indian
Ocean; but it was from that patent slip in a lonely wooded bay that had sprung the workshops
of the Consolidated Docks Company, with its three graving basins carved out of solid rock,
its wharves, its jetties, its electric-light plant, its steam-power houses--with its gigantic
sheer-legs, fit to lift the heaviest weight ever carried afloat, and whose head could be seen
like the top of a queer white monument peeping over bushy points of land and sandy promontories,
as you approached the New Harbor from the west.

There had been a time when men counted: there were not so many carriages in the colony then,
though Mr. Denham, he fancied, had a buggy. And Captain Whalley seemed to be swept out of the
great avenue by the swirl of a mental backwash. He remembered muddy shores, a harbor without
quays, the one solitary wooden pier (but that was a public work) jutting out crookedly, the
first coal-sheds erected on Monkey Point, that caught fire mysteriously and smoldered for days,
so that amazed ships came into a roadstead full of sulphurous smoke, and the sun hung blood-red
at midday. He remembered the things, the faces, and something more besides--like the faint
flavor of a cup quaffed to the bottom, like a subtle sparkle of the air that was not to be
found in the atmosphere of to-day.

In this evocation, swift and full of detail like a flash of magnesium light into the niches
of a dark memorial hall, Captain Whalley contemplated things once important, the efforts of
small men, the growth of a great place, but now robbed of all consequence by the greatness
of accomplished facts, by hopes greater still; and they gave him for a moment such an almost
physical grip upon time, such a comprehension of our unchangeable feelings, that he stopped
short, struck the ground with his stick, and ejaculated mentally, "What the devil am I doing
here!" He seemed lost in a sort of surprise; but he heard his name called out in wheezy tones
once, twice--and turned on his heels slowly.

He beheld then, waddling towards him autocratically, a man of an old-fashioned and gouty aspect,
with hair as white as his own, but with shaved, florid cheeks, wearing a necktie--almost a
neckcloth--whose stiff ends projected far beyond his chin; with round legs, round arms, a round
body, a round face--generally producing the effect of his short figure having been distended
by means of an air-pump as much as the seams of his clothing would stand. This was the Master-Attendant
of the port. A master-attendant is a superior sort of harbor-master; a person, out in the East,
of some consequence in his sphere; a Government official, a magistrate for the waters of the
port, and possessed of vast but ill-defined disciplinary authority over seamen of all classes.
This particular Master-Attendant was reported to consider it miserably inadequate, on the ground
that it did not include the power of life and death. This was a jocular exaggeration. Captain
Eliott was fairly satisfied with his position, and nursed no inconsiderable sense of such power
as he had. His conceited and tyrannical disposition did not allow him to let it dwindle in
his hands for want of use. The uproarious, choleric frankness of his comments on people's character
and conduct caused him to be feared at bottom; though in conversation many pretended not to
mind him in the least, others would only smile sourly at the mention of his name, and there
were even some who dared to pronounce him "a meddlesome old ruffian." But for almost all of
them one of Captain Eliott's outbreaks was nearly as distasteful to face as a chance of annihilation.

V

As soon as he had come up quite close he said, mouthing in a growl--

"What's this I hear, Whalley? Is it true you're selling the Fair Maid?"

Captain Whalley, looking away, said the thing was done--money had been paid that morning; and
the other expressed at once his approbation of such an extremely sensible proceeding. He had
got out of his trap to stretch his legs, he explained, on his way home to dinner. Sir Frederick
looked well at the end of his time. Didn't he?

Captain Whalley could not say; had only noticed the carriage going past.

The Master-Attendant, plunging his hands into the pockets of an alpaca jacket inappropriately
short and tight for a man of his age and appearance, strutted with a slight limp, and with
his head reaching only to the shoulder of Captain Whalley, who walked easily, staring straight
before him. They had been good comrades years ago, almost intimates. At the time when Whalley
commanded the renowned Condor, Eliott had charge of the nearly as famous Ringdove for the same
owners; and when the appointment of Master-Attendant was created, Whalley would have been the
only other serious candidate. But Captain Whalley, then in the prime of life, was resolved
to serve no one but his own auspicious Fortune. Far away, tending his hot irons, he was glad
to hear the other had been successful. There was a worldly suppleness in bluff Ned Eliott that
would serve him well in that sort of official appointment. And they were so dissimilar at bottom
that as they came slowly to the end of the avenue before the Cathedral, it had never come into
Whalley's head that he might have been in that man's place--provided for to the end of his days.

The sacred edifice, standing in solemn isolation amongst the converging avenues of enormous
trees, as if to put grave thoughts of heaven into the hours of ease, presented a closed Gothic
portal to the light and glory of the west. The glass of the rosace above the ogive glowed like
fiery coal in the deep carvings of a wheel of stone. The two men faced about.

"I'll tell you what they ought to do next, Whalley," growled Captain Eliott suddenly.

"Well?"

"They ought to send a real live lord out here when Sir Frederick's time is up. Eh?"

Captain Whalley perfunctorily did not see why a lord of the right sort should not do as well
as anyone else. But this was not the other's point of view.

"No, no. Place runs itself. Nothing can stop it now. Good enough for a lord," he growled in
short sentences. "Look at the changes in our time. We need a lord here now. They have got a
lord in Bombay."

He dined once or twice every year at the Government House--a many-windowed, arcaded palace
upon a hill laid out in roads and gardens. And lately he had been taking about a duke in his
Master-Attendant's steam-launch to visit the harbor improvements. Before that he had "most
obligingly" gone out in person to pick out a good berth for the ducal yacht. Afterwards he
had an invitation to lunch on board. The duchess herself lunched with them. A big woman with
a red face. Complexion quite sunburnt. He should think ruined. Very gracious manners. They
were going on to Japan. . . .

He ejaculated these details for Captain Whalley's edification, pausing to blow out his cheeks
as if with a pent-up sense of importance, and repeatedly protruding his thick lips till the
blunt crimson end of his nose seemed to dip into the milk of his mustache. The place ran itself;
it was fit for any lord; it gave no trouble except in its Marine department--in its Marine
department he repeated twice, and after a heavy snort began to relate how the other day her
Majesty's Consul-General in French Cochin-China had cabled to him--in his official capacity--asking
for a qualified man to be sent over to take charge of a Glasgow ship whose master had died
in Saigon.

"I sent word of it to the officers' quarters in the Sailors' Home," he continued, while the
limp in his gait seemed to grow more accentuated with the increasing irritation of his voice.
"Place's full of them. Twice as many men as there are berths going in the local trade. All
hungry for an easy job. Twice as many--and--What d'you think, Whalley? . . ."

He stopped short; his hands clenched and thrust deeply downwards, seemed ready to burst the
pockets of his jacket. A slight sigh escaped Captain Whalley.

"Hey? You would think they would be falling over each other. Not a bit of it. Frightened to
go home. Nice and warm out here to lie about a veranda waiting for a job. I sit and wait in
my office. Nobody. What did they suppose? That I was going to sit there like a dummy with the
Consul-General's cable before me? Not likely. So I looked up a list of them I keep by me and
sent word for Hamilton--the worst loafer of them all--and just made him go. Threatened to instruct
the steward of the Sailors' Home to have him turned out neck and crop. He did not think the
berth was good enough--if--you--please. 'I've your little records by me,' said I. 'You came
ashore here eighteen months ago, and you haven't done six months' work since. You are in debt
for your board now at the Home, and I suppose you reckon the Marine Office will pay in the
end. Eh? So it shall; but if you don't take this chance, away you go to England, assisted passage,
by the first homeward steamer that comes along. You are no better than a pauper. We don't want
any white paupers here.' I scared him. But look at the trouble all this gave me."

"You would not have had any trouble," Captain Whalley said almost involuntarily, "if you had
sent for me."

Captain Eliott was immensely amused; he shook with laughter as he walked. But suddenly he stopped
laughing. A vague recollection had crossed his mind. Hadn't he heard it said at the time of
the Travancore and Deccan smash that poor Whalley had been cleaned out completely. "Fellow's
hard up, by heavens!" he thought; and at once he cast a sidelong upward glance at his companion.
But Captain Whalley was smiling austerely straight before him, with a carriage of the head
inconceivable in a penniless man--and he became reassured. Impossible. Could not have lost
everything. That ship had been only a hobby of his. And the reflection that a man who had confessed
to receiving that very morning a presumably large sum of money was not likely to spring upon
him a demand for a small loan put him entirely at his ease again. There had come a long pause
in their talk, however, and not knowing how to begin again, he growled out soberly, "We old
fellows ought to take a rest now."

"The best thing for some of us would be to die at the oar," Captain Whalley said negligently.

"Come, now. Aren't you a bit tired by this time of the whole show?" muttered the other sullenly.

"Are you?"

Captain Eliott was. Infernally tired. He only hung on to his berth so long in order to get
his pension on the highest scale before he went home. It would be no better than poverty, anyhow;
still, it was the only thing between him and the workhouse. And he had a family. Three girls,
as Whalley knew. He gave "Harry, old boy," to understand that these three girls were a source
of the greatest anxiety and worry to him. Enough to drive a man distracted.

"Why? What have they been doing now?" asked Captain Whalley with a sort of amused absent-mindedness.

"Doing! Doing nothing. That's just it. Lawn-tennis and silly novels from morning to night. . . ."

If one of them at least had been a boy. But all three! And, as ill-luck would have it, there
did not seem to be any decent young fellows left in the world. When he looked around in the
club he saw only a lot of conceited popinjays too selfish to think of making a good woman happy.
Extreme indigence stared him in the face with all that crowd to keep at home. He had cherished
the idea of building himself a little house in the country--in Surrey--to end his days in,
but he was afraid it was out of the question, . . . and his staring eyes rolled upwards with
such a pathetic anxiety that Captain Whalley charitably nodded down at him, restraining a sort
of sickening desire to laugh.

"You must know what it is yourself, Harry. Girls are the very devil for worry and anxiety."

"Ay! But mine is doing well," Captain Whalley pronounced slowly, staring to the end of the avenue.

The Master-Attendant was glad to hear this. Uncommonly glad. He remembered her well. A pretty
girl she was.

Captain Whalley, stepping out carelessly, assented as if in a dream.

"She was pretty."

The procession of carriages was breaking up.

One after another they left the file to go off at a trot, animating the vast avenue with their
scattered life and movement; but soon the aspect of dignified solitude returned and took possession
of the straight wide road. A syce in white stood at the head of a Burmah pony harnessed to
a varnished two-wheel cart; and the whole thing waiting by the curb seemed no bigger than a
child's toy forgotten under the soaring trees. Captain Eliott waddled up to it and made as
if to clamber in, but refrained; and keeping one hand resting easily on the shaft, he changed
the conversation from his pension, his daughters, and his poverty back again to the only other
topic in the world--the Marine Office, the men and the ships of the port.

He proceeded to give instances of what was expected of him; and his thick voice drowsed in
the still air like the obstinate droning of an enormous bumble-bee. Captain Whalley did not
know what was the force or the weakness that prevented him from saying good-night and walking
away. It was as though he had been too tired to make the effort. How queer. More queer than
any of Ned's instances. Or was it that overpowering sense of idleness alone that made him stand
there and listen to these stories. Nothing very real had ever troubled Ned Eliott; and gradually
he seemed to detect deep in, as if wrapped up in the gross wheezy rumble, something of the
clear hearty voice of the young captain of the Ringdove. He wondered if he too had changed
to the same extent; and it seemed to him that the voice of his old chum had not changed so
very much--that the man was the same. Not a bad fellow the pleasant, jolly Ned Eliott, friendly,
well up to his business--and always a bit of a humbug. He remembered how he used to amuse his
poor wife. She could read him like an open book. When the Condor and the Ringdove happened
to be in port together, she would frequently ask him to bring Captain Eliott to dinner. They
had not met often since those old days. Not once in five years, perhaps. He regarded from under
his white eyebrows this man he could not bring himself to take into his confidence at this
juncture; and the other went on with his intimate outpourings, and as remote from his hearer
as though he had been talking on a hill-top a mile away. 

[1093] 'My acquaintance,' wrote Richardson (Corres. iv. 317), 'lies chiefly among the ladies; I
care not who knows it.' Mrs. Piozzi, in a marginal note on her own copy of the Piozzi Letters,
says:--'Dr. Johnson said, that if Mr. Richardson had lived till I came out, my praises would
have added two or three years to his life. "For," says Dr. Johnson, "that fellow died merely from
want of change among his flatterers: he perished for want of more, like a man obliged to breathe
the same air till it is exhausted."' Hayward's Piozzi, i. 311. In her Journey, i. 265, she
says:--'Richardson had seen little, and Johnson has often told me that he had read little.' See ante,
iv. 28.

[1094] He may live like a gentleman, but he must not 'call himself Farmer, and go about with a little
round hat.' Ante, p. 111.

[1095] Boswell italicises this word, I think, because Johnson objected
to the misuse of it.

at college."' Ante, iii.

[1096] As I have been scrupulously exact in relating anecdotes concerning other persons, I
shall not withhold any part of this story, however ludicrous.--I was so successful in this
boyish frolick, that the universal cry of the galleries was, 'Encore the cow! Encore the cow!'
In the pride of my heart, I attempted imitations of some other animals, but with very inferior
effect. My reverend friend, anxious for my fame, with an air of the utmost gravity and earnestness,
addressed me thus: 'My dear sir, I would confine myself to the cow.' BOSWELL. Blair's advice
was expressed more emphatically, and with a peculiar burr--'Stick
to the cow, mon.' WALTER SCOTT.

Boswell's record, which moreover is far more humorous, is much more trustworthy than Scott's tradition.

of a man's life is often compared to the winding up of a well-written play, where the principal
persons still act in character, whatever the fate is which they undergo....
That innocent mirth which had been so conspicuous in Sir Thomas More's
life did not forsake him to the last.

His death was of a piece with his life. There was nothing in it new, forced, or affected.' The

He was as eager about a new paper to his wife's drawing-room, or his own new wig, as about a new
tragedy or a new epic poem.' He adds, that he was 'capable of the most profound conversation,
when circumstances led to it.

He had not the least desire to shine, but was delighted beyond measure to shew other people
in their best guise to his friends. "Did not I shew you the lion well to-day?" used he to say
after the exhibition of a remarkable stranger.' He had no wit, and for humour hardly a relish.
Robertson's reputation for wisdom may have been easily won. Dr. A. Carlyle says (ib. p. 287):--'Robertson's
translations and paraphrases on other people's thoughts were so beautiful and so harmless that
I never saw anybody lay claim to their own.' He may have flattered Johnson by dexterously echoing
his sentiments.

[1100] In the Marmor Norfolciense (ante, i. 141) Johnson says:--'I know that the knowledge
of the alphabet is so disreputable among these gentlemen [of the army], that those who have
by ill-fortune formerly been taught it have partly forgot it by disuse, and partly concealed
it from the world, to avoid the railleries and insults to which their education might make them
liable.' Johnson's Works, vi. III. See ante, iii. 265.

[1101] 'One of the young ladies had her slate before her, on which I wrote a question consisting
of three figures to be multiplied by two figures. She looked upon it, and quivering her fingers
in a manner which I thought very pretty, but of which I knew not whether it was art or play,
multiplied the sum regularly in two lines, observing the decimal place; but did not add the
two lines together, probably disdaining so easy an operation.' Johnson's Works, ix. 161.

[1103] One of the best criticks of our age 'does not wish to prevent the admirers of the incorrect and
nerveless style which generally prevailed for a century before Dr.
Johnson's energetick writings were known, from enjoying the laugh
that this story may produce, in which he is very ready to join them.'
He, however, requests me to observe, that 'my friend very properly
chose a long word on this occasion, not, it is believed, from any
predilection for polysyllables, (though he certainly had a due respect
for them,) but in order to put Mr. Braidwood's skill to the strictest
test, and to try the efficacy of his instruction by the most difficult
exertion of the organs of his pupils.' BOSWELL.

'One of the best critics of our age' is, I believe, Malone. See ante,

[1106] Johnson himself had laughed at them (ante, ii. 210) and accused them of foppery (ante, ii.
237).

[1107] Johnson said, 'I never think I have hit hard, unless it rebounds (ante, ii. 335), and, 'I
would rather be attacked than unnoticed' (ante, iii.

375). When he was told of a caricature 'of the nine muses flogging him round Parnassus,' he said,
'Sir, I am very glad to hear this. I hope the day will never arrive when I shall neither be the
object of calumny or ridicule, for then I shall be neglected and forgotten.' Croker's Boswell,
p. 837. See ante, ii. 61, and pp. 174, 273. 'There was much laughter when M. de Lesseps mentioned
that on his first visit to England the publisher who brought out the report of his meeting charged,
as the first item of his bill, "£50 for attacking the book in order to make it succeed." "Since
then," observed M. de Lesseps, "I have been attacked gratuitously, and have got on without
paying."' The Times, Feb. 19, 1884.

[1110] He would have been astonished had he known that a few miles from Edinburgh he had passed
through two villages of serfs. The coal-hewers and salt-makers of Tranent and Preston-Pans were
still sold with the soil. 'In Scotland domestic slavery is unknown, except so far as regards
the coal-hewers and salt-makers, whose condition, it must be confessed, bears some resemblance
to slavery; because all who have once acted in either of the capacities are compellable to serve,
and fixed to their respective places of employment during life.' Hargrave's Argument in the
case of James Sommersett, 1772. Had Johnson known this he might have given as his toast when
in company with some very grave men at Edinburgh:--'Here's to the
next insurrection of the slaves in Scotland.' Ante, iii.

200.

[1111] The year following in the House of Commons he railed at the London booksellers, 'who,
he positively asserted, entirely governed the newspapers.' 'For his part,' he added, 'he had ordered
that no English newspaper should come within his doors for three months.' Parl. Hist. xvii. 1090.

it.

One of his friends 'hoped that they might, as habitual visitors, escape hearing the usual endless

the spectacle, and reflected that it was he who had forced Lord Howard
upon the confidence of Russel, he retired, and, by a Roman death,
put an end to his misery.' Dalrymple's Memoirs of Great Britain and
Ireland, vol. i. p. 36.

[1118] Dr. A. Carlyle (Auto. p. 293) says of Robertson and Blair:--'Having
been bred at a time when the common people thought to play with cards
or dice was a sin, and everybody thought it an indecorum in clergymen,
they could neither of them play at golf or bowls, and far less at
cards or backgammon, and on that account were very unhappy when from
home in friends' houses in the country in rainy weather.

As I had set the first example of playing at cards at home with unlocked
door [Carlyle was a minister], and so relieved the clergy from ridicule
on that side, they both learned to play at whist after they were sixty.'

[1121] He wrote to Boswell on Nov. 16, 1776 (ante, iii. 93):--'The expedition to the Hebrides
was the most pleasant journey that I ever made.' In his Diary he recorded on Jan. 9, 1774:--'In
the autumn I took a journey to the Hebrides, but my mind was not free from perturbation.' Pr.
and Med. p. 136. The following letter to Dr. Taylor I have copied from the original in the
possession of my friend Mr. M. M. Holloway:--

'DEAR SIR,

'When I was at Edinburgh I had a letter from you, telling me that in answer to some enquiry
you were informed that I was in the Sky. I was then I suppose in the western islands of Scotland;
I set out on the northern expedition August 6, and came back to Fleet-street, November 26. I have
seen a new region.

'I have been upon seven of the islands, and probably should have visited
many more, had we not begun our journey so late in the year, that
the stormy weather came upon us, and the storms have I believe for
about five months hardly any intermission.

'Your Letter told me that you were better. When you write do not forget to confirm that account. I
had very little ill health while I was on the journey, and bore rain and wind tolerably well.
I had a cold and deafness only for a few days, and those days I passed at a good house. I have
traversed the east coast of Scotland from south to north from Edinburgh to Inverness, and
the west coast from north to south, from the Highlands to Glasgow, and am come back as I went,

'Sir,

'Your
affectionate humble servant,

'SAM. JOHNSON.'

reason or perceptible benefit.' Johnson's Works, ix.

[1139] Every reader will, I am sure, join with me in warm admiration of the truly patriotic writer
of this letter. I know not which most to applaud--that good sense and liberality of mind, which
could see and admit the defects of his native country, to which no man is a more zealous friend:--or
that candour, which induced him to give just praise to the minister whom he honestly and strenuously
opposed. BOSWELL.

[1140] The original MS. is now in my possession.

[1141] The passage that gave offence was as follows:--'Mr. Macleod is the proprietor of the
islands of Raasay, Rona, and Fladda, and possesses an extensive district in Sky. The estate has not
during four hundred years gained or lost a single acre.

He acknowledges Macleod of Dunvegan as his chief, though his ancestors have formerly disputed the
pre-eminence.' First edition, p. 132. The second edition was not published till the year after
Johnson's death. In it the passage remains unchanged. To it the following note was prefixed:
'Strand, Oct. 26, 1785.

Since this work was printed off, the publisher, having been informed
that the author some years ago had promised the Laird of Raasay to
correct in a future edition a passage concerning him, thinks it a
justice due to that gentleman to insert here the advertisement relative
to this matter, which was published by Dr. Johnson's desire in the
Edinburgh newspapers in the year 1775, and which has been lately reprinted
in Mr. Boswell's Tour to the Hebrides.' (It is not unlikely that the
publication of Boswell's Tour occasioned a fresh demand for Johnson's
Journey.) In later editions all the words after 'a single acre' are
silently struck out.

Johnson's Works, ix. 55. See ante, ii.

382.

[1142] Rasay was highly gratified, and afterwards visited and dined with Dr. Johnson at his
house in London. BOSWELL. Johnson wrote on May 12, 1775:--'I have offended; and what is stranger,
have justly offended, the nation of Rasay. If they could come hither, they would be as fierce
as the Americans. Rasay has written to Boswell an account of the injury done him by representing
his house as subordinate to that of Dunvegan. Boswell has his letter, and, I believe, copied
my answer. I have appeased him, if a degraded chief can possibly be appeased: but it will be thirteen
days--days of resentment and discontent--before my recantation can reach him. Many a dirk will
imagination, during that interval, fix in my heart. I really question
if at this time my life would not be in danger, if distance did not
secure it. Boswell will find his way to Streatham before he goes,
and will detail this great affair.' Piozzi Letters, i. 216.

[1143]
In like manner he communicated to Sir William Forbes part of his journal
from which he made the Life of Johnson. Ante, iii. 208.

[1144] In
justice both to Sir William Forbes, and myself, it is proper to mention,
that the papers which were submitted to his perusal contained only
an account of our Tour from the time that Dr. Johnson and I set out
from Edinburgh (p. 58), and consequently did not contain the elogium
on Sir William Forbes, (p. 24), which he never saw till this book
appeared in print; nor did he even know, when he wrote the above letter,
that this Journal was to be published. BOSWELL. This note is not in
the first edition.

[1151] Having found, on a revision of the
first edition of this work, that, notwithstanding my best care, a
few observations had escaped me, which arose from the instant impression,
the publication of which might perhaps be considered as passing the
bounds of a strict decorum, I immediately ordered that they should
be omitted in the subsequent editions. I was pleased to find that
they did not amount in the whole to a page. If any of the same kind
are yet left, it is owing to inadvertence alone, no man being more
unwilling to give pain to others than I am.

A contemptible scribbler,
of whom I have learned no more than that, after having disgraced and
deserted the clerical character, he picks up in London a scanty livelihood
by scurrilous lampoons under a feigned name, has impudently and falsely
asserted that the passages omitted were defamatory, and that the omission
was not voluntary, but compulsory. The last insinuation I took the
trouble publickly to disprove; yet, like one of Pope's dunces, he
persevered in 'the lie o'erthrown.' [Prologue to the Satires, l. 350.]
As to the charge of defamation, there is an obvious and certain mode
of refuting it. Any person who thinks it worth while to compare one
edition with the other, will find that the passages omitted were not
in the least degree of that nature, but exactly such as I have represented
them in the former part of this note, the hasty effusion of momentary
feelings, which the delicacy of politeness should have suppressed.
BOSWELL. In the second edition this note ended at the first paragraph,
the latter part being added in the third. For the 'few observations
omitted' see ante, pp. 148, 381, 388.

The 'contemptible scribbler'
was, I believe, John Wolcot, better known by his assumed name of Peter
Pindar. He had been a clergyman. In his Epistle to Boswell (Works,
i. 219), he says in reference to the passages about Sir A. Macdonald
(afterwards Lord Macdonald):--'A letter of severe remonstrance was
sent to Mr. B., who, in consequence, omitted in the second edition
of his Journal what is so generally pleasing to the public, viz.,
the scandalous passages relative to that nobleman.' It was in a letter
to the Gent. Mag. 1786, p. 285, that Boswell 'publickly disproved
the insinuation' made 'in a late scurrilous publication' that these
passages 'were omitted in consequence of a letter from his Lordship.
Nor was any application,' he continues, 'made to me by the nobleman
alluded to at any time to make any alteration in my Journal.'

[1155] Johnson, it should seem, did not allow that there was
any pleasure in writing poetry. 219. What Johnson always sought was
to sufficiently occupy the mind. So long as that was done, that labour
would, I believe, seem to him the pleasanter which required the less
thought.

[1159] A writer in the Gent. Mag. 1786, p. 388, with
some reason says:--'I heartily wish Mr. Boswell would get this Latin
poem translated.'

[1160] Boswell, briefly mentioning the tour which
Johnson made to Wales in the year 1774 with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, says:--'I
do not find that he kept any journal or notes of what he saw there'
(ante, ii. 285). A journal had been kept however, which in 1816 was
edited and published by Mr. Duppa. Mrs. Piozzi, writing in October
of that year, says that three years earlier she had been shewn the
MS. by a Mr. White, and that it was genuine. 'The gentleman who possessed
it seemed shy of letting me read the whole, and did not, as it appeared,
like being asked how it came into his hands.' Hayward's Piozzi, ii.

Captain Whalley seemed to brace himself up in his chair, but gave no recognition whatever to
his presence. The other puffed jets of smoke; then suddenly--

"I could never understand that new mania of yours of having this Malay here for your shadow,
partner."

Captain Whalley got up from the chair in all his imposing stature and walked across to the
binnacle, holding such an unswerving course that the other had to back away hurriedly, and
remained as if intimidated, with the pipe trembling in his hand. "Walk over me now," he muttered
in a sort of astounded and discomfited whisper. Then slowly and distinctly he said--

"I--am--not--dirt." And then added defiantly, "As you seem to think."

The Serang jerked out--

"See the palms now, Tuan."

Captain Whalley strode forward to the rail; but his eyes, instead of going straight to the
point, with the assured keen glance of a sailor, wandered irresolutely in space, as though
he, the discoverer of new routes, had lost his way upon this narrow sea.

Another white man, the mate, came up on the bridge. He was tall, young, lean, with a mustache
like a trooper, and something malicious in the eye. He took up a position beside the engineer.
Captain Whalley, with his back to them, inquired--

"What's on the log?"

"Eighty-five," answered the mate quickly, and nudged the engineer with his elbow.

Captain Whalley's muscular hands squeezed the iron rail with an extraordinary force; his eyes
glared with an enormous effort; he knitted his eyebrows, the perspiration fell from under his
hat,--and in a faint voice he murmured, "Steady her, Serang--when she is on the proper bearing."

The silent Malay stepped back, waited a little, and lifted his arm warningly to the helmsman.
The wheel revolved rapidly to meet the swing of the ship. Again the made nudged the engineer.
But Massy turned upon him.

"Mr. Sterne," he said violently, "let me tell you--as a shipowner--that you are no better than
a confounded fool."

VII

Sterne went down smirking and apparently not at all disconcerted, but the engineer Massy remained
on the bridge, moving about with uneasy self-assertion. Everybody on board was his inferior--everyone
without exception. He paid their wages and found them in their food. They ate more of his bread
and pocketed more of his money than they were worth; and they had no care in the world, while
he alone had to meet all the difficulties of shipowning. When he contemplated his position
in all its menacing entirety, it seemed to him that he had been for years the prey of a band
of parasites: and for years he had scowled at everybody connected with the Sofala except, perhaps,
at the Chinese firemen who served to get her along. Their use was manifest: they were an indispensable
part of the machinery of which he was the master.

When he passed along his decks he shouldered those he came across brutally; but the Malay deck
hands had learned to dodge out of his way. He had to bring himself to tolerate them because
of the necessary manual labor of the ship which must be done. He had to struggle and plan and
scheme to keep the Sofala afloat--and what did he get for it? Not even enough respect. They
could not have given him enough of that if all their thoughts and all their actions had been
directed to that end. The vanity of possession, the vainglory of power, had passed away by
this time, and there remained only the material embarrassments, the fear of losing that position
which had turned out not worth having, and an anxiety of thought which no abject subservience
of men could repay.

He walked up and down. The bridge was his own after all. He had paid for it; and with the stem
of the pipe in his hand he would stop short at times as if to listen with a profound and concentrated
attention to the deadened beat of the engines (his own engines) and the slight grinding of
the steering chains upon the continuous low wash of water alongside. But for these sounds,
the ship might have been lying as still as if moored to a bank, and as silent as if abandoned
by every living soul; only the coast, the low coast of mud and mangroves with the three palms
in a bunch at the back, grew slowly more distinct in its long straight line, without a single
feature to arrest attention. The native passengers of the Sofala lay about on mats under the
awnings; the smoke of her funnel seemed the only sign of her life and connected with her gliding
motion in a mysterious manner.

Captain Whalley on his feet, with a pair of binoculars in his hand and the little Malay Serang
at his elbow, like an old giant attended by a wizened pigmy, was taking her over the shallow
water of the bar.

This submarine ridge of mud, scoured by the stream out of the soft bottom of the river and
heaped up far out on the hard bottom of the sea, was difficult to get over. The alluvial coast
having no distinguishing marks, the bearings of the crossing-place had to be taken from the
shape of the mountains inland. The guidance of a form flattened and uneven at the top like
a grinder tooth, and of another smooth, saddle-backed summit, had to be searched for within
the great unclouded glare that seemed to shift and float like a dry fiery mist, filling the
air, ascending from the water, shrouding the distances, scorching to the eye. In this veil
of light the near edge of the shore alone stood out almost coal-black with an opaque and motionless
solidity. Thirty miles away the serrated range of the interior stretched across the horizon,
its outlines and shades of blue, faint and tremulous like a background painted on airy gossamer
on the quivering fabric of an impalpable curtain let down to the plain of alluvial soil; and
the openings of the estuary appeared, shining white, like bits of silver let into the square
pieces snipped clean and sharp out of the body of the land bordered with mangroves.

On the forepart of the bridge the giant and the pigmy muttered to each other frequently in
quiet tones. Behind them Massy stood sideways with an expression of disdain and suspense on
his face. His globular eyes were perfectly motionless, and he seemed to have forgotten the
long pipe he held in his hand.

On the fore-deck below the bridge, steeply roofed with the white slopes of the awnings, a young
lascar seaman had clambered outside the rail. He adjusted quickly a broad band of sail canvas
under his armpits, and throwing his chest against it, leaned out far over the water. The sleeves
of his thin cotton shirt, cut off close to the shoulder, bared his brown arm of full rounded
form and with a satiny skin like a woman's. He swung it rigidly with the rotary and menacing
action of a slinger: the 14-lb. weight hurtled circling in the air, then suddenly flew ahead
as far as the curve of the bow. The wet thin line swished like scratched silk running through
the dark fingers of the man, and the plunge of the lead close to the ship's side made a vanishing
silvery scar upon the golden glitter; then after an interval the voice of the young Malay uplifted
and long-drawn declared the depth of the water in his own language.

"Tiga stengah," he cried after each splash and pause, gathering the line busily for another
cast. "Tiga stengah," which means three fathom and a half. For a mile or so from seaward there
was a uniform depth of water right up to the bar. "Half-three. Half-three. Half-three,"--and
his modulated cry, returned leisurely and monotonous, like the repeated call of a bird, seemed
to float away in sunshine and disappear in the spacious silence of the empty sea and of a lifeless
shore lying open, north and south, east and west, without the stir of a single cloud-shadow
or the whisper of any other voice.

The owner-engineer of the Sofala remained very still behind the two seamen of different race,
creed, and color; the European with the time-defying vigor of his old frame, the little Malay,
old, too, but slight and shrunken like a withered brown leaf blown by a chance wind under the
mighty shadow of the other. Very busy looking forward at the land, they had not a glance to
spare; and Massy, glaring at them from behind, seemed to resent their attention to their duty
like a personal slight upon himself.

This was unreasonable; but he had lived in his own world of unreasonable resentments for many
years. At last, passing his moist palm over the rare lanky wisps of coarse hair on the top
of his yellow head, he began to talk slowly.

"A leadsman, you want! I suppose that's your correct mail-boat style. Haven't you enough judgment
to tell where you are by looking at the land? Why, before I had been a twelvemonth in the trade
I was up to that trick--and I am only an engineer. I can point to you from here where the bar
is, and I could tell you besides that you are as likely as not to stick her in the mud in about
five minutes from now; only you would call it interfering, I suppose. And there's that written
agreement of ours, that says I mustn't interfere."

His voice stopped. Captain Whalley, without relaxing the set severity of his features, moved
his lips to ask in a quick mumble--

"How near, Serang?"

"Very near now, Tuan," the Malay muttered rapidly.

"Dead slow," said the Captain aloud in a firm tone.

The Serang snatched at the handle of the telegraph. A gong clanged down below. Massy with a
scornful snigger walked off and put his head down the engineroom skylight.

"You may expect some rare fooling with the engines, Jack," he bellowed. The space into which
he stared was deep and full of gloom; and the gray gleams of steel down there seemed cool after
the intense glare of the sea around the ship. The air, however, came up clammy and hot on his
face. A short hoot on which it would have been impossible to put any sort of interpretation
came from the bottom cavernously. This was the way in which the second engineer answered his chief.

He was a middle-aged man with an inattentive manner, and apparently wrapped up in such a taciturn
concern for his engines that he seemed to have lost the use of speech. When addressed directly
his only answer would be a grunt or a hoot, according to the distance. For all the years he
had been in the Sofala he had never been known to exchange as much as a frank Good-morning
with any of his shipmates. He did not seem aware that men came and went in the world; he did
not seem to see them at all. Indeed he never recognized his ship mates on shore. At table (the
four white men of the Sofala messed together) he sat looking into his plate dispassionately,
but at the end of the meal would jump up and bolt down below as if a sudden thought had impelled
him to rush and see whether somebody had not stolen the engines while he dined. In port at
the end of the trip he went ashore regularly, but no one knew where he spent his evenings or
in what manner. The local coasting fleet had preserved a wild and incoherent tale of his infatuation
for the wife of a sergeant in an Irish infantry regiment. The regiment, however, had done its
turn of garrison duty there ages before, and was gone somewhere to the other side of the earth,
out of men's knowledge. Twice or perhaps three times in the course of the year he would take
too much to drink. On these occasions he returned on board at an earlier hour than usual; ran
across the deck balancing himself with his spread arms like a tight-rope walker; and locking
the door of his cabin, he would converse and argue with himself the livelong night in an amazing
variety of tones; storm, sneer, and whine with an inexhaustible persistence. Massy in his berth
next door, raising himself on his elbow, would discover that his second had remembered the
name of every white man that had passed through the Sofala for years and years back. He remembered
the names of men that had died, that had gone home, that had gone to America: he remembered
in his cups the names of men whose connection with the ship had been so short that Massy had
almost forgotten its circumstances and could barely recall their faces. The inebriated voice
on the other side of the bulkhead commented upon them all with an extraordinary and ingenious
venom of scandalous inventions. It seems they had all offended him in some way, and in return
he had found them all out. He muttered darkly; he laughed sardonically; he crushed them one
after another; but of his chief, Massy, he babbled with an envious and naive admiration. Clever
scoundrel! Don't meet the likes of him every day. Just look at him. Ha! Great! Ship of his
own. Wouldn't catch him going wrong. No fear--the beast! And Massy, after listening with a
gratified smile to these artless tributes to his greatness, would begin to shout, thumping
at the bulkhead with both fists--

"Shut up, you lunatic! Won't you let me go to sleep, you fool!"

But a half smile of pride lingered on his lips; outside the solitary lascar told off for night
duty in harbor, perhaps a youth fresh from a forest village, would stand motionless in the
shadows of the deck listening to the endless drunken gabble. His heart would be thumping with
breathless awe of white men: the arbitrary and obstinate men who pursue inflexibly their incomprehensible
purposes,--beings with weird intonations in the voice, moved by unaccountable feelings, actuated
by inscrutable motives.

VIII

For a while after his second's answering hoot Massy hung over the engine-room gloomily. Captain
Whalley, who, by the power of five hundred pounds, had kept his command for three years, might
have been suspected of never having seen that coast before. He seemed unable to put down his
glasses, as though they had been glued under his contracted eyebrows. This settled frown gave
to his face an air of invincible and just severity; but his raised elbow trembled slightly,
and the perspiration poured from under his hat as if a second sun had suddenly blazed up at
the zenith by the side of the ardent still globe already there, in whose blinding white heat
the earth whirled and shone like a mote of dust.

From time to time, still holding up his glasses, he raised his other hand to wipe his streaming
face. The drops rolled down his cheeks, fell like rain upon the white hairs of his beard, and
brusquely, as if guided by an uncontrollable and anxious impulse, his arm reached out to the
stand of the engine-room telegraph.

The gong clanged down below. The balanced vibration of the dead-slow speed ceased together
with every sound and tremor in the ship, as if the great stillness that reigned upon the coast
had stolen in through her sides of iron and taken possession of her innermost recesses. The
illusion of perfect immobility seemed to fall upon her from the luminous blue dome without
a stain arching over a flat sea without a stir. The faint breeze she had made for herself expired,
as if all at once the air had become too thick to budge; even the slight hiss of the water
on her stem died out. The narrow, long hull, carrying its way without a ripple, seemed to approach
the shoal water of the bar by stealth. The plunge of the lead with the mournful, mechanical
cry of the lascar came at longer and longer intervals; and the men on her bridge seemed to
hold their breath. The Malay at the helm looked fixedly at the compass card, the Captain and
the Serang stared at the coast.

Massy had left the skylight, and, walking flat-footed, had returned softly to the very spot
on the bridge he had occupied before. A slow, lingering grin exposed his set of big white teeth:
they gleamed evenly in the shade of the awning like the keyboard of a piano in a dusky room.

At last, pretending to talk to himself in excessive astonishment, he said not very loud--

"Stop the engines now. What next, I wonder?"

He waited, stooping from the shoulders, his head bowed, his glance oblique. Then raising his
voice a shade--

"If I dared make an absurd remark I would say that you haven't the stomach to . . ."

But a yelling spirit of excitement, like some frantic soul wandering unsuspected in the vast
stillness of the coast, had seized upon the body of the lascar at the lead. The languid monotony
of his sing-song changed to a swift, sharp clamor. The weight flew after a single whir, the
line whistled, splash followed splash in haste. The water had shoaled, and the man, instead
of the drowsy tale of fathoms, was calling out the soundings in feet.

"Fifteen feet. Fifteen, fifteen! Fourteen, fourteen . . ."

Captain Whalley lowered the arm holding the glasses. It descended slowly as if by its own weight;
no other part of his towering body stirred; and the swift cries with their eager warning note
passed him by as though he had been deaf.

Massy, very still, and turning an attentive ear, had fastened his eyes upon the silvery, close-cropped
back of the steady old head. The ship herself seemed to be arrested but for the gradual decrease
of depth under her keel.

"Thirteen feet . . . Thirteen! Twelve!" cried the leadsman anxiously below the bridge. And
suddenly the barefooted Serang stepped away noiselessly to steal a glance over the side.

Narrow of shoulder, in a suit of faded blue cotton, an old gray felt hat rammed down on his
head, with a hollow in the nape of his dark neck, and with his slender limbs, he appeared from
the back no bigger than a boy of fourteen. There was a childlike impulsiveness in the curiosity
with which he watched the spread of the voluminous, yellowish convolutions rolling up from
below to the surface of the blue water like massive clouds driving slowly upwards on the unfathomable
sky. He was not startled at the sight in the least. It was not doubt, but the certitude that
the keel of the Sofala must be stirring the mud now, which made him peep over the side.

His peering eyes, set aslant in a face of the Chinese type, a little old face, immovable, as
if carved in old brown oak, had informed him long before that the ship was not headed at the
bar properly. Paid off from the Fair Maid, together with the rest of the crew, after the completion
of the sale, he had hung, in his faded blue suit and floppy gray hat, about the doors of the
Harbor Office, till one day, seeing Captain Whalley coming along to get a crew for the Sofala,
he had put himself quietly in the way, with his bare feet in the dust and an upward mute glance.
The eyes of his old commander had fallen on him favorably--it must have been an auspicious
day--and in less than half an hour the white men in the "Ofiss" had written his name on a document
as Serang of the fire-ship Sofala. Since that time he had repeatedly looked at that estuary,
upon that coast, from this bridge and from this side of the bar. The record of the visual world
fell through his eyes upon his unspeculating mind as on a sensitized plate through the lens
of a camera. His knowledge was absolute and precise; nevertheless, had he been asked his opinion,
and especially if questioned in the downright, alarming manner of white men, he would have
displayed the hesitation of ignorance. He was certain of his facts--but such a certitude counted
for little against the doubt what answer would be pleasing. Fifty years ago, in a jungle village,
and before he was a day old, his father (who died without ever seeing a white face) had had
his nativity cast by a man of skill and wisdom in astrology, because in the arrangement of
the stars may be read the last word of human destiny. His destiny had been to thrive by the
favor of various white men on the sea. He had swept the decks of ships, had tended their helms,
had minded their stores, had risen at last to be a Serang; and his placid mind had remained
as incapable of penetrating the simplest motives of those he served as they themselves were
incapable of detecting through the crust of the earth the secret nature of its heart, which
may be fire or may be stone. But he had no doubt whatever that the Sofala was out of the proper
track for crossing the bar at Batu Beru.

It was a slight error. The ship could not have been more than twice her own length too far
to the northward; and a white man at a loss for a cause (since it was impossible to suspect
Captain Whalley of blundering ignorance, of want of skill, or of neglect) would have been inclined
to doubt the testimony of his senses. It was some such feeling that kept Massy motionless,
with his teeth laid bare by an anxious grin. Not so the Serang. He was not troubled by any
intellectual mistrust of his senses. If his captain chose to stir the mud it was well. He had
known in his life white men indulge in outbreaks equally strange. He was only genuinely interested
to see what would come of it. At last, apparently satisfied, he stepped back from the rail.

He had made no sound: Captain Whalley, however, seemed to have observed the movements of his
Serang. Holding his head rigidly, he asked with a mere stir of his lips--

"Going ahead still, Serang?"

"Still going a little, Tuan," answered the Malay. Then added casually, "She is over."

The lead confirmed his words; the depth of water increased at every cast, and the soul of excitement
departed suddenly from the lascar swung in the canvas belt over the Sofala's side. Captain
Whalley ordered the lead in, set the engines ahead without haste, and averting his eyes from
the coast directed the Serang to keep a course for the middle of the entrance.

Massy brought the palm of his hand with a loud smack against his thigh.

"You grazed on the bar. Just look astern and see if you didn't. Look at the track she left.
You can see it plainly. Upon my soul, I thought you would! What made you do that? What on earth
made you do that? I believe you are trying to scare me."

He talked slowly, as it were circumspectly, keeping his prominent black eyes on his captain.
There was also a slight plaintive note in his rising choler, for, primarily, it was the clear
sense of a wrong suffered undeservedly that made him hate the man who, for a beggarly five
hundred pounds, claimed a sixth part of the profits under the three years' agreement. Whenever
his resentment got the better of the awe the person of Captain Whalley inspired he would positively
whimper with fury.

"You don't know what to invent to plague my life out of me. I would not have thought that a
man of your sort would condescend . . ."

He paused, half hopefully, half timidly, whenever Captain Whalley made the slightest movement
in the deck-chair, as though expecting to be conciliated by a soft speech or else rushed upon
and hunted off the bridge.

"I am puzzled," he went on again, with the watchful unsmiling baring of his big teeth. "I don't
know what to think. I do believe you are trying to frighten me. You very nearly planted her
on the bar for at least twelve hours, besides getting the engines choked with mud. Ships can't
afford to lose twelve hours on a trip nowadays--as you ought to know very well, and do know
very well to be sure, only . . ."

His slow volubility, the sideways cranings of his neck, the black glances out of the very corners
of his eyes, left Captain Whalley unmoved. He looked at the deck with a severe frown. Massy
waited for some little time, then began to threaten plaintively.

"You think you've got me bound hand and foot in that agreement. You think you can torment me
in any way you please. Ah! But remember it has another six weeks to run yet. There's time for
me to dismiss you before the three years are out. You will do yet something that will give
me the chance to dismiss you, and make you wait a twelvemonth for your money before you can
take yourself off and pull out your five hundred, and leave me without a penny to get the new
boilers for her. You gloat over that idea--don't you? I do believe you sit here gloating. It's
as if I had sold my soul for five hundred pounds to be everlastingly damned in the end. . . ."

He paused, without apparent exasperation, then continued evenly--

". . . With the boilers worn out and the survey hanging over my head, Captain Whalley--Captain
Whalley, I say, what do you do with your money? You must have stacks of money somewhere--a
man like you must. It stands to reason. I am not a fool, you know, Captain Whalley--partner."

Again he paused, as though he had done for good. He passed his tongue over his lips, gave a
backward glance at the Serang conning the ship with quiet whispers and slight signs of the
hand. The wash of the propeller sent a swift ripple, crested with dark froth, upon a long flat
spit of black slime. The Sofala had entered the river; the trail she had stirred up over the
bar was a mile astern of her now, out of sight, had disappeared utterly; and the smooth, empty
sea along the coast was left behind in the glittering desolation of sunshine. On each side
of her, low down, the growth of somber twisted mangroves covered the semi-liquid banks; and
Massy continued in his old tone, with an abrupt start, as if his speech had been ground out
of him, like the tune of a music-box, by turning a handle.

"Though if anybody ever got the best of me, it is you. I don't mind saying this. I've said
it--there! What more can you want? Isn't that enough for your pride, Captain Whalley. You got
over me from the first. It's all of a piece, when I look back at it. You allowed me to insert
that clause about intemperance without saying anything, only looking very sick when I made
a point of it going in black on white. How could I tell what was wrong about you. There's generally
something wrong somewhere. And, lo and behold! when you come on board it turns out that you've
been in the habit of drinking nothing but water for years and years."

His dogmatic reproachful whine stopped. He brooded profoundly, after the manner of crafty and
unintelligent men. It seemed inconceivable that Captain Whalley should not laugh at the expression
of disgust that overspread the heavy, yellow countenance. But Captain Whalley never raised
his eyes--sitting in his arm-chair, outraged, dignified, and motionless.

"Much good it was to me," Massy remonstrated monotonously, "to insert a clause for dismissal
for intemperance against a man who drinks nothing but water. And you looked so upset, too,
when I read my draft in the lawyer's office that morning, Captain Whalley,--you looked so crestfallen,
that I made sure I had gone home on your weak spot. A shipowner can't be too careful as to
the sort of skipper he gets. You must have been laughing at me in your sleeve all the blessed
time. . . . Eh? What are you going to say?"

Captain Whalley had only shuffled his feet slightly. A dull animosity became apparent in Massy's
sideways stare.

"But recollect that there are other grounds of dismissal. There's habitual carelessness, amounting
to incompetence--there's gross and persistent neglect of duty. I am not quite as big a fool
as you try to make me out to be. You have been careless of late--leaving everything to that
Serang. Why! I've seen you letting that old fool of a Malay take bearings for you, as if you
were too big to attend to your work yourself. And what do you call that silly touch-and-go
manner in which you took the ship over the bar just now? You expect me to put up with that?"

Leaning on his elbow against the ladder abaft the bridge, Sterne, the mate, tried to hear,
blinking the while from the distance at the second engineer, who had come up for a moment,
and stood in the engine-room companion. Wiping his hands on a bunch of cotton waste, he looked
about with indifference to the right and left at the river banks slipping astern of the Sofala
steadily.

Massy turned full at the chair. The character of his whine became again threatening.

"Take care. I may yet dismiss you and freeze to your money for a year. I may . . ."

But before the silent, rigid immobility of the man whose money had come in the nick of time
to save him from utter ruin, his voice died out in his throat.

"Not that I want you to go," he resumed after a silence, and in an absurdly insinuating tone.
"I want nothing better than to be friends and renew the agreement, if you will consent to find
another couple of hundred to help with the new boilers, Captain Whalley. I've told you before.
She must have new boilers; you know it as well as I do. Have you thought this over?"

He waited. The slender stem of the pipe with its bulky lump of a bowl at the end hung down
from his thick lips. It had gone out. Suddenly he took it from between his teeth and wrung
his hands slightly.

"Don't you believe me?" He thrust the pipe bowl into the pocket of his shiny black jacket.

"It's like dealing with the devil," he said. "Why don't you speak? At first you were so high
and mighty with me I hardly dared to creep about my own deck. Now I can't get a word from you.
You don't seem to see me at all. What does it mean? Upon my soul, you terrify me with this
deaf and dumb trick. What's going on in that head of yours? What are you plotting against me
there so hard that you can't say a word? You will never make me believe that you--you--don't
know where to lay your hands on a couple of hundred. You have made me curse the day I was born.
. . ."

"Mr. Massy," said Captain Whalley suddenly, without stirring.

The engineer started violently.

"If that is so I can only beg you to forgive me."

"Starboard," muttered the Serang to the helmsman; and the Sofala began to swing round the bend
into the second reach.

"Ough!" Massy shuddered. "You make my blood run cold. What made you come here? What made you
come aboard that evening all of a sudden, with your high talk and your money--tempting me?
I always wondered what was your motive? You fastened yourself on me to have easy times and
grow fat on my life blood, I tell you. Was that it? I believe you are the greatest miser in
the world, or else why . . ."

"No. I am only poor," interrupted Captain Whalley, stonily.

"Steady," murmured the Serang. Massy turned away with his chin on his shoulder.

"I don't believe it," he said in his dogmatic tone. Captain Whalley made no movement. "There
you sit like a gorged vulture--exactly like a vulture."

He embraced the middle of the reach and both the banks in one blank unseeing circular glance,
and left the bridge slowly.

IX

On turning to descend Massy perceived the head of Sterne the mate loitering, with his sly confident
smile, his red mustaches and blinking eyes, at the foot of the ladder.

Sterne had been a junior in one of the larger shipping concerns before joining the Sofala.
He had thrown up his berth, he said, "on general principles." The promotion in the employ was
very slow, he complained, and he thought it was time for him to try and get on a bit in the
world. It seemed as though nobody would ever die or leave the firm; they all stuck fast in
their berths till they got mildewed; he was tired of waiting; and he feared that when a vacancy
did occur the best servants were by no means sure of being treated fairly. Besides, the captain
he had to serve under--Captain Provost--was an unaccountable sort of man, and, he fancied,
had taken a dislike to him for some reason or other. For doing rather more than his bare duty
as likely as not. When he had done anything wrong he could take a talking to, like a man; but
he expected to be treated like a man too, and not to be addressed invariably as though he were
a dog. He had asked Captain Provost plump and plain to tell him where he was at fault, and
Captain Provost, in a most scornful way, had told him that he was a perfect officer, and that
if he disliked the way he was being spoken to there was the gangway--he could take himself
off ashore at once. But everybody knew what sort of man Captain Provost was. It was no use
appealing to the office. Captain Provost had too much influence in the employ. All the same,
they had to give him a good character. He made bold to say there was nothing in the world against
him, and, as he had happened to hear that the mate of the Sofala had been taken to the hospital
that morning with a sunstroke, he thought there would be no harm in seeing whether he would
not do. . . .

He had come to Captain Whalley freshly shaved, red-faced, thin-flanked, throwing out his lean
chest; and had recited his little tale with an open and manly assurance. Now and then his eyelids
quivered slightly, his hand would steal up to the end of the flaming mustache; his eyebrows
were straight, furry, of a chestnut color, and the directness of his frank gaze seemed to tremble
on the verge of impudence. Captain Whalley had engaged him temporarily; then, the other man
having been ordered home by the doctors, he had remained for the next trip, and then the next.
He had now attained permanency, and the performance of his duties was marked by an air of serious,
single-minded application. Directly he was spoken to, he began to smile attentively, with a
great deference expressed in his whole attitude; but there was in the rapid winking which went
on all the time something quizzical, as though he had possessed the secret of some universal
joke cheating all creation and impenetrable to other mortals.

Grave and smiling he watched Massy come down step by step; when the chief engineer had reached
the deck he swung about, and they found themselves face to face. Matched as to height and utterly
dissimilar, they confronted each other as if there had been something between them--something
else than the bright strip of sunlight that, falling through the wide lacing of two awnings,
cut crosswise the narrow planking of the deck and separated their feet as it were a stream;
something profound and subtle and incalculable, like an unexpressed understanding, a secret
mistrust, or some sort of fear.

At last Sterne, blinking his deep-set eyes and sticking forward his scraped, clean-cut chin,
as crimson as the rest of his face, murmured--

"You've seen? He grazed! You've seen?"

Massy, contemptuous, and without raising his yellow, fleshy countenance, replied in the same
pitch--

"Maybe. But if it had been you we would have been stuck fast in the mud."

"Pardon me, Mr. Massy. I beg to deny it. Of course a shipowner may say what he jolly well pleases
on his own deck. That's all right; but I beg to . . ."

"Get out of my way!"

The other had a slight start, the impulse of suppressed indignation perhaps, but held his ground.
Massy's downward glance wandered right and left, as though the deck all round Sterne had been
bestrewn with eggs that must not be broken, and he had looked irritably for places where he
could set his feet in flight. In the end he too did not move, though there was plenty of room
to pass on.

"I heard you say up there," went on the mate--"and a very just remark it was too--that there's
always something wrong. . . ."

"Eavesdropping is what's wrong with you, Mr. Sterne."

"Now, if you would only listen to me for a moment, Mr. Massy, sir, I could . . ."

"You are a sneak," interrupted Massy in a great hurry, and even managed to get so far as to
repeat, "a common sneak," before the mate had broken in argumentatively--

"Now, sir, what is it you want? You want . . ."

"I want--I want," stammered Massy, infuriated and astonished--"I want. How do you know that
I want anything? How dare you? . . . What do you mean? . . . What are you after--you . . ."

"Promotion." Sterne silenced him with a sort of candid bravado. The engineer's round soft cheeks
quivered still, but he said quietly enough--

"You are only worrying my head off," and Sterne met him with a confident little smile.

"A chap in business I know (well up in the world he is now) used to tell me that this was the
proper way. 'Always push on to the front,' he would say. 'Keep yourself well before your boss.
Interfere whenever you get a chance. Show him what you know. Worry him into seeing you.' That
was his advice. Now I know no other boss than you here. You are the owner, and no one else
counts for that much in my eyes. See, Mr. Massy? I want to get on. I make no secret of it that
I am one of the sort that means to get on. These are the men to make use of, sir. You haven't
arrived at the top of the tree, sir, without finding that out--I dare say."

"Worry your boss in order to get on," mumbled Massy, as if awestruck by the irreverent originality
of the idea. "I shouldn't wonder if this was just what the Blue Anchor people kicked you out
of the employ for. Is that what you call getting on? You shall get on in the same way here
if you aren't careful--I can promise you."

At this Sterne hung his head, thoughtful, perplexed, winking hard at the deck. All his attempts
to enter into confidential relations with his owner had led of late to nothing better than
these dark threats of dismissal; and a threat of dismissal would check him at once into a hesitating
silence as though he were not sure that the proper time for defying it had come. On this occasion
he seemed to have lost his tongue for a moment, and Massy, getting in motion, heavily passed
him by with an abortive attempt at shouldering. Sterne defeated it by stepping aside. He turned
then swiftly, opening his mouth very wide as if to shout something after the engineer, but
seemed to think better of it.

Always--as he was ready to confess--on the lookout for an opening to get on, it had become
an instinct with him to watch the conduct of his immediate superiors for something "that one
could lay hold of." "This is good-bye, mon enfant, for I leave the ship at dawn with the tug, so
that I do avoid those reporters from newspapers and the contract conspirators. I have advised
Nannette that you go to the Ritz-Carlton to await your Uncle if he be not upon the dock. I go to
the grain fields of Canada and then to the West of America.... I would that it could be au revoir.
Upon a day that shall come, beautiful lady, perhaps it will be permitted
to me to... Non, vive la France! It
filled the leisure of his waking hours with the reveries of careful plans and compromising
discoveries--the dreams of his sleep with images of lucky turns and favorable accidents. Skippers
had been known to sicken and die at sea, than which nothing could be better to give a smart
mate a chance of showing what he's made of. They also would tumble overboard sometimes: he
had heard of one or two such cases. Others again . . . But, as it were constitutionally, he
was faithful to the belief that the conduct of no single one of them would stand the test of
careful watching by a man who "knew what's what" and who kept his eyes "skinned pretty well"
all the time.

After he had gained a permanent footing on board the Sofala he allowed his perennial hope to
rise high. To begin with, it was a great advantage to have an old man for captain: the sort
of man besides who in the nature of things was likely to give up the job before long from one
cause or another. Sterne was greatly chagrined, however, to notice that he did not seem anyway
near being past his work yet. Still, these old men go to pieces all at once sometimes. Then
there was the owner-engineer close at hand to be impressed by his zeal and steadiness. Sterne
never for a moment doubted the obvious nature of his own merits (he was really an excellent
officer); only, nowadays, professional merit alone does not take a man along fast enough. A
chap must have some push in him, and must keep his wits at work too to help him forward. He
made up his mind to inherit the charge of this steamer if it was to be done at all; not indeed
estimating the command of the Sofala as a very great catch, but for the reason that, out East
especially, to make a start is everything, and one command leads to another.

He began by promising himself to behave with great circumspection; Massy's somber and fantastic
humors intimidated him as being outside one's usual sea experience; but he was quite intelligent
enough to realize almost from the first that he was there in the presence of an exceptional
situation. His peculiar prying imagination penetrated it quickly; the feeling that there was
in it an element which eluded his grasp exasperated his impatience to get on. And so one trip
came to an end, then another, and he had begun his third before he saw an opening by which
he could step in with any sort of effect. It had all been very queer and very obscure; something
had been going on near him, as if separated by a chasm from the common life and the working
routine of the ship, which was exactly like the life and the routine of any other coasting
steamer of that class.

Then one day he made his discovery.

It came to him after all these weeks of watchful observation and puzzled surmises, suddenly,
like the long-sought solution of a riddle that suggests itself to the mind in a flash. Not
with the same authority, however. Great heavens! Could it be that? And after remaining thunderstruck
for a few seconds he tried to shake it off with self-contumely, as though it had been the product
of an unhealthy bias towards the Incredible, the Inexplicable, the Unheard-of--the Mad!

This--the illuminating moment--had occurred the trip before, on the return passage. They had
just left a place of call on the mainland called Pangu; they were steaming straight out of
a bay. To the east a massive headland closed the view, with the tilted edges of the rocky strata
showing through its ragged clothing of rank bushes and thorny creepers. The wind had begun
to sing in the rigging; the sea along the coast, green and as if swollen a little above the
line of the horizon, seemed to pour itself over, time after time, with a slow and thundering
fall, into the shadow of the leeward cape; and across the wide opening the nearest of a group
of small islands stood enveloped in the hazy yellow light of a breezy sunrise; still farther
out the hummocky tops of other islets peeped out motionless above the water of the channels
between, scoured tumultuously by the breeze.

The usual track of the Sofala both going and returning on every trip led her for a few miles
along this reefinfested region. Her parent--loved not he his child above all earthly things! As
traders love the merchandize from which their profit springs: Old age came by, with tott'ring
step, and, for the sordid gold With which the dotard urged his suit, the maiden's peace was
sold And thus (for oh! her sire's stern heart was steel'd against her pray'r) The hand he
ne'er had gain'd from love, he won from her despair.

I saw them through the churchyard pass, but such a nuptial train I
would not for the wealth of worlds should greet my sight again. The thunderstorms of the coast
broke frequently over that cluster; it turned then shadowy in its whole extent; it turned more
dark, and as if more still in the play of fire; as if more impenetrably silent in the peals
of thunder; its blurred shapes vanished--dissolving utterly at times in the thick rain--to
reappear clear-cut and black in the stormy light against the gray sheet of the cloud--scattered
on the slaty round table of the sea. Unscathed by storms, resisting the work of years, unfretted
by the strife of the world, there it lay unchanged as on that day, four hundred years ago,
when first beheld by Western eyes from the deck of a high-pooped caravel.

It was one of these secluded spots that may be found on the busy sea, as on land you come sometimes
upon the clustered houses of a hamlet untouched by men's restlessness, untouched by their need,
by their thought, and as if forgotten by time itself. The lives of uncounted generations had
passed it by, and the multitudes of seafowl, urging their way from all the points of the horizon
to sleep on the outer rocks of the group, unrolled the converging evolutions of their flight
in long somber streamers upon the glow of the sky. The palpitating cloud of their wings soared
and stooped over the pinnacles of the rocks, over the rocks slender like spires, squat like
martello towers; over the pyramidal heaps like fallen ruins, over the lines of bald bowlders
showing like a wall of stones battered to pieces and scorched by lightning--with the sleepy,
clear glimmer of water in every breach. The noise of their continuous and violent screaming
filled the air.

This great noise would meet the Sofala coming up from Batu Beru; it would meet her on quiet
evenings, a pitiless and savage clamor enfeebled by distance, the clamor of seabirds settling
to rest, and struggling for a footing at the end of the day. No one noticed it especially on
board; it was the voice of their ship's unerring landfall, ending the steady stretch of a hundred
miles. She had made good her course, she had run her distance till the punctual islets began
to emerge one by one, the points of rocks, the hummocks of earth . . . and the cloud of birds
hovered--the restless cloud emitting a strident and cruel uproar, the sound of the familiar
scene, the living part of the broken land beneath, of the outspread sea, and of the high sky
without a flaw.

But when the Sofala happened to close with the land after sunset she would find everything
very still there under the mantle of the night. All would be still, dumb, almost invisible--but
for the blotting out of the low constellations occulted in turns behind the vague masses of
the islets whose true outlines eluded the eye amongst the dark spaces of the heaven: and the
ship's three lights, resembling three stars--the red and the green with the white above--her
three lights, like three companion stars wandering on the earth, held their unswerving course
for the passage at the southern end of the group. Sometimes there were human eyes open to watch
them come nearer, traveling smoothly in the somber void; the eyes of a naked fisherman in his
canoe floating over a reef. He thought drowsily: "Ha! The fire-ship that once in every moon
goes in and comes out of Pangu bay." More he did not know of her. And just as he had detected
the faint rhythm of the propeller beating the calm water a mile and a half away, the time would
come for the Sofala to alter her course, the lights would swing off him their triple beam--and
disappear.

A few miserable, half-naked families, a sort of outcast tribe of long-haired, lean, and wild-eyed
people, strove for their living in this lonely wilderness of islets, lying like an abandoned
outwork of the land at the gates of the bay. Within the knots and loops of the rocks the water
rested more transparent than crystal under their crooked and leaky canoes, scooped out of the
trunk of a tree: the forms of the bottom undulated slightly to the dip of a paddle; and the
men seemed to hang in the air, they seemed to hang inclosed within the fibers of a dark, sodden
log, fishing patiently in a strange, unsteady, pellucid, green air above the shoals.

Their bodies stalked brown and emaciated as if dried up in the sunshine; their lives ran out
silently; the homes where they were born, went to rest, and died--flimsy sheds of rushes and
coarse grass eked out with a few ragged mats--were hidden out of sight from the open sea. No
glow of their household fires ever kindled for a seaman a red spark upon the blind night of
the group: and the calms of the coast, the flaming long calms of the equator, the unbreathing,
concentrated calms like the deep introspection of a passionate nature, brooded awfully for
days and weeks together over the unchangeable inheritance of their children; till at last the
stones, hot like live embers, scorched the naked sole, till the water clung warm, and sickly,
and as if thickened, about the legs of lean men with girded loins, wading thigh-deep in the
pale blaze of the shallows. And it would happen now and then that the Sofala, through some
delay in one of the ports of call, would heave in sight making for Pangu bay as late as noonday.

Only a blurring cloud at first, the thin mist of her smoke would arise mysteriously from an
empty point on the clear line of sea and sky. The taciturn fishermen within the reefs would
extend their lean arms towards the offing; and the brown figures stooping on the tiny beaches,
the brown figures of men, women, and children grubbing in the sand in search of turtles' eggs,
would rise up, crooked elbow aloft and hand over the eyes, to watch this monthly apparition
glide straight on, swerve off--and go by. Their ears caught the panting of that ship; their
eyes followed her till she passed between the two capes of the mainland going at full speed
as though she hoped to make her way unchecked into the very bosom of the earth.

On such days the luminous sea would give no sign of the dangers lurking on both sides of her
path. Everything remained still, crushed by the overwhelming power of the light; and the whole
group, opaque in the sunshine,--the rocks resembling pinnacles, the rocks resembling spires,
the rocks resembling ruins; the forms of islets resembling beehives, resembling mole-hills,
the islets recalling the shapes of haystacks, the contours of ivy-clad towers,--would stand
reflected together upside down in the unwrinkled water, like carved toys of ebony disposed
on the silvered plate-glass of a mirror.

The first touch of blowing weather would envelop the whole at once in the spume of the windward
breakers, as if in a sudden cloudlike burst of steam; and the clear water seemed fairly to
boil in all the passages. The provoked sea outlined exactly in a design of angry foam the wide
base of the group; the submerged level of broken waste and refuse left over from the building
of the coast near by, projecting its dangerous spurs, all awash, far into the channel, and
bristling with wicked long spits often a mile long: with deadly spits made of froth and stones.

And even nothing more than a brisk breeze--as on that morning, the voyage before, when the
Sofala left Pangu bay early, and Mr. Sterne's discovery was to blossom out like a flower of
incredible and evil aspect from the tiny seed of instinctive suspicion,--even such a breeze
had enough strength to tear the placid mask from the face of the sea. To Sterne, gazing with
indifference, it had been like a revelation to behold for the first time the dangers marked
by the hissing livid patches on the water as distinctly as on the engraved paper of a chart.
It came into his mind that this was the sort of day most favorable for a stranger attempting
the passage: a clear day, just windy enough for the sea to break on every ledge, buoying, as
it were, the channel plainly to the sight; whereas during a calm you had nothing to depend
on but the compass and the practiced judgment of your eye. And yet the successive captains
of the Sofala had had to take her through at night more than once. Nowadays you could not afford
to throw away six or seven hours of a steamer's time. That you couldn't. But then use is everything,
and with proper care . . . The channel was broad and safe enough; the main point was to hit
upon the entrance correctly in the dark--for if a man got himself involved in that stretch
of broken water over yonder he would never get out with a whole ship--if he ever got out at all.

This was Sterne's last train of thought independent of the great discovery. He had just seen
to the securing of the anchor, and had remained forward idling away a moment or two. The captain
was in charge on the bridge. With a slight yawn he had turned away from his survey of the sea
and had leaned his shoulders against the fish davit.

These, properly speaking, were the very last moments of ease he was to know on board the Sofala.
All the instants that came after were to be pregnant with purpose and intolerable with perplexity.
No more idle, random thoughts; the discovery would put them on the rack, till sometimes he
wished to goodness he had been fool enough not to make it at all. And yet, if his chance to
get on rested on the discovery of "something wrong," he could not have hoped for a greater
stroke of luck.

X

The knowledge was too disturbing, really. There was "something wrong" with a vengeance, and
the moral certitude of it was at first simply frightful to contemplate. Sterne had been looking
aft in a mood so idle, that for once he was thinking no harm of anyone. His captain on the
bridge presented himself naturally to his sight. How insignificant, how casual was the thought
that had started the train of discovery--like an accidental spark that suffices to ignite the
charge of a tremendous mine!

Caught under by the breeze, the awnings of the foredeck bellied upwards and collapsed slowly,
and above their heavy flapping the gray stuff of Captain Whalley's roomy coat fluttered incessantly
around his arms and trunk. He faced the wind in full light, with his great silvery beard blown
forcibly against his chest; the eyebrows overhung heavily the shadows whence his glance appeared
to be staring ahead piercingly. Sterne could just detect the twin gleam of the whites shifting
under the shaggy arches of the brow. At short range these eyes, for all the man's affable manner,
seemed to look you through and through. Sterne never could defend himself from that feeling
when he had occasion to speak with his captain. He did not like it. What a big heavy man he
appeared up there, with that little shrimp of a Serang in close attendance--as was usual in
this extraordinary steamer! Confounded absurd custom that. He resented it. Surely the old fellow
could have looked after his ship without that loafing native at his elbow. Sterne wriggled
his shoulders with disgust. What was it? Indolence or what?

That old skipper must have been growing lazy for years. They all grew lazy out East here (Sterne
was very conscious of his own unimpaired activity); they got slack all over. But he towered
very erect on the bridge; and quite low by his side, as you see a small child looking over
the edge of a table, the battered soft hat and the brown face of the Serang peeped over the
white canvas screen of the rail.

No doubt the Malay was standing back, nearer to the wheel; but the great disparity of size
in close association amused Sterne like the observation of a bizarre fact in nature. They were
as queer fish out of the sea as any in it.

He saw Captain Whalley turn his head quickly to speak to his Serang; the wind whipped the whole
white mass of the beard sideways. He would be directing the chap to look at the compass for
him, or what not. Of course. Too much trouble to step over and see for himself. Sterne's scorn
for that bodily indolence which overtakes white men in the East increased on reflection. Some
of them would be utterly lost if they hadn't all these natives at their beck and call; they
grew perfectly shameless about it too. He was not of that sort, thank God! It wasn't in him
to make himself dependent for his work on any shriveled-up little Malay like that. As if one
could ever trust a silly native for anything in the world! But that fine old man thought differently,
it seems. There they were together, never far apart; a pair of them, recalling to the mind
an old whale attended by a little pilot-fish.

The fancifulness of the comparison made him smile. A whale with an inseparable pilot-fish!
That's what the old man looked like; for it could not be said he looked like a shark, though
Mr. Massy had called him that very name. But Mr. Massy did not mind what he said in his savage
fits. Sterne smiled to himself--and gradually the ideas evoked by the sound, by the imagined
shape of the word pilot-fish; the ideas of aid, of guidance needed and received, came uppermost
in his mind: the word pilot awakened the idea of trust, of dependence, the idea of welcome,
clear-eyed help brought to the seaman groping for the land in the dark: groping blindly in
fogs: feeling their way in the thick weather of the gales that, filling the air with a salt
mist blown up from the sea, contract the range of sight on all sides to a shrunken horizon
that seems within reach of the hand.

A pilot sees better than a stranger, because his local knowledge, like a sharper vision, completes
the shapes of things hurriedly glimpsed; penetrates the veils of mist spread over the land
by the storms of the sea; defines with certitude the outlines of a coast lying under the pall
of fog, the forms of landmarks half buried in a starless night as in a shallow grave. He recognizes
because he already knows. It is not to his far-reaching eye but to his more extensive knowledge
that the pilot looks for certitude; for this certitude of the ship's position on which may
depend a man's good fame and the peace of his conscience, the justification of the trust deposited
in his hands, with his own life too, which is seldom wholly his to throw away, and the humble
lives of others rooted in distant affections, perhaps, and made as weighty as the lives of
kings by the burden of the awaiting mystery. The pilot's knowledge brings relief and certitude
to the commander of a ship; the Serang, however, in his fanciful suggestion of a pilot-fish
attending a whale, could not in any way be credited with a superior knowledge. Why should he
have it? These two men had come on that run together--the white and the brown--on the same
day: and of course a white man would learn more in a week than the best native would in a month.
He was made to stick to the skipper as though he were of some use--as the pilot-fish, they
say, is to the whale. But how--it was very marked--how? A pilot-fish--a pilot--a . . . But
if not superior knowledge then . . .

Sterne's discovery was made. It was repugnant to his imagination, shocking to his ideas of
honesty, shocking to his conception of mankind. This enormity affected one's outlook on what
was possible in this world: it was as if for instance the sun had turned blue, throwing a new
and sinister light on men and nature. Really in the first moment he had felt sickish, as though
he had got a blow below the belt: for a second the very color of the sea seemed changed--appeared
queer to his wandering eye; and he had a passing, unsteady sensation in all his limbs as though
the earth had started turning the other way.

A very natural incredulity succeeding this sense of upheaval brought a measure of relief. He
had gasped; it was over. But afterwards during all that day sudden paroxysms of wonder would
come over him in the midst of his occupations. He would stop and shake his head. The revolt
of his incredulity had passed away almost as quick as the first emotion of discovery, and for
the next twenty-four hours he had no sleep. That would never do. At meal-times (he took the
foot of the table set up for the white men on the bridge) he could not help losing himself
in a fascinated contemplation of Captain Whalley opposite. He watched the deliberate upward
movements of the arm; the old man put his food to his lips as though he never expected to find
any taste in his daily bread, as though he did not know anything about it. He fed himself like
a somnambulist. "It's an awful sight," thought Sterne; and he watched the long period of mournful,
silent immobility, with a big brown hand lying loosely closed by the side of the plate, till
he noticed the two engineers to the right and left looking at him in astonishment. He would
close his mouth in a hurry then, and lowering his eyes, wink rapidly at his plate. It was awful
to see the old chap sitting there; it was even awful to think that with three words he could
blow him up sky-high. All he had to do was to raise his voice and pronounce a single short
sentence, and yet that simple act seemed as impossible to attempt as moving the sun out of
its place in the sky. The old chap could eat in his terrific mechanical way; but Sterne, from
mental excitement, could not--not that evening, at any rate.

He had had ample time since to get accustomed to the strain of the meal-hours. He would never
have believed it. But then use is everything; only the very potency of his success prevented
anything resembling elation. He felt like a man who, in his legitimate search for a loaded
gun to help him on his way through the world, chances to come upon a torpedo--upon a live torpedo
with a shattering charge in its head and a pressure of many atmospheres in its tail. It is
the sort of weapon to make its possessor careworn and nervous. He had no mind to be blown up
himself; and he could not get rid of the notion that the explosion was bound to damage him
too in some way.

This vague apprehension had restrained him at first. He was able now to eat and sleep with
that fearful weapon by his side, with the conviction of its power always in mind. It had not
been arrived at by any reflective process; but once the idea had entered his head, the conviction
had followed overwhelmingly in a multitude of observed little facts to which before he had
given only a languid attention. The abrupt and faltering intonations of the deep voice; the
taciturnity put on like an armor; the deliberate, as if guarded, movements; the long immobilities,
as if the man he watched had been afraid to disturb the very air: every familiar gesture, every
word uttered in his hearing, every sigh overheard, had acquired a special significance, a confirmatory
import.

Every day that passed over the Sofala appeared to Sterne simply crammed full with proofs--with
incontrovertible proofs. At night, when off duty, he would steal out of his cabin in pyjamas
(for more proofs) and stand a full hour, perhaps, on his bare feet below the bridge, as absolutely
motionless as the awning stanchion in its deck socket near by. On the stretches of easy navigation
it is not usual for a coasting captain to remain on deck all the time of his watch. The Serang
keeps it for him as a matter of custom; in open water, on a straight course, he is usually
trusted to look after the ship by himself. But this old man seemed incapable of remaining quietly
down below. No doubt he could not sleep. And no wonder. This was also a proof. Suddenly in
the silence of the ship panting upon the still, dark sea, Sterne would hear a low voice above
him exclaiming nervously--

"Serang!"

"Tuan!"

"You are watching the compass well?"

"Yes, I am watching, Tuan."

"The ship is making her course?"

"She is, Tuan. Very straight."

"It is well; and remember, Serang, that the order is that you are to mind the helmsmen and
keep a lookout with care, the same as if I were not on deck."

Then, when the Serang had made his answer, the low tones on the bridge would cease, and everything
round Sterne seemed to become more still and more profoundly silent. Slightly chilled and with
his back aching a little from long immobility, he would steal away to his room on the port
side of the deck. He had long since parted with the last vestige of incredulity; of the original
emotions, set into a tumult by the discovery, some trace of the first awe alone remained. Not
the awe of the man himself--he could blow him up sky-high with six words--rather it was an
awestruck indignation at the reckless perversity of avarice (what else could it be?), at the
mad and somber resolution that for the sake of a few dollars more seemed to set at naught the
common rule of conscience and pretended to struggle against the very decree of Providence.

You could not find another man like this one in the whole round world--thank God. There was
something devilishly dauntless in the character of such a deception which made you pause.

Other considerations occurring to his prudence had kept him tongue-tied from day to day. It
seemed to him now that it would yet have been easier to speak out in the first hour of discovery.
He almost regretted not having made a row at once. But then the very monstrosity of the disclosure
. . . Why! He could hardly face it himself, let alone pointing it out to somebody else. Moreover,
with a desperado of that sort one never knew. The object was not to get him out (that was as
well as done already), but to step into his place. Bizarre as the thought seemed he might have
shown fight. A fellow up to working such a fraud would have enough cheek for anything; a fellow
that, as it were, stood up against God Almighty Himself. He was a horrid marvel--that's what
he was: he was perfectly capable of brazening out the affair scandalously till he got him (Sterne)
kicked out of the ship and everlastingly damaged his prospects in this part of the East. Yet
if you want to get on something must be risked. At times Sterne thought he had been unduly
timid of taking action in the past; and what was worse, it had come to this, that in the present
he did not seem to know what action to take.

Massy's savage moroseness was too disconcerting. It was an incalculable factor of the situation.
You could not tell what there was behind that insulting ferocity. How could one trust such
a temper; it did not put Sterne in bodily fear for himself, but it frightened him exceedingly
as to his prospects.

Though of course inclined to credit himself with exceptional powers of observation, he had
by now lived too long with his discovery. He had gone on looking at nothing else, till at last
one day it occurred to him that the thing was so obvious that no one could miss seeing it.
There were four white men in all on board the Sofala. Jack, the second engineer, was too dull
to notice anything that took place out of his engine-room. Remained Massy--the owner--the interested
person--nearly going mad with worry. Sterne had heard and seen more than enough on board to
know what ailed him; but his exasperation seemed to make him deaf to cautious overtures. If
he had only known it, there was the very thing he wanted. But how could you bargain with a
man of that sort? It was like going into a tiger's den with a piece of raw meat in your hand.
He was as likely as not to rend you for your pains. In fact, he was always threatening to do
that very thing; and the urgency of the case, combined with the impossibility of handling it
with safety, made Sterne in his watches below toss and mutter open-eyed in his bunk, for hours,
as though he had been burning with fever.

Occurrences like the crossing of the bar just now were extremely alarming to his prospects.
He did not want to be left behind by some swift catastrophe. Massy being on the bridge, the
old man had to brace himself up and make a show, he supposed. But it was getting very bad with
him, very bad indeed, now. Even Massy had been emboldened to find fault this time; Sterne,
listening at the foot of the ladder, had heard the other's whimpering and artless denunciations.
Luckily the beast was very stupid and could not see the why of all this. However, small blame
to him; it took a clever man to hit upon the cause. Nevertheless, it was high time to do something.
The old man's game could not be kept up for many days more.

"I may yet lose my life at this fooling--let alone my chance," Sterne mumbled angrily to himself,
after the stooping back of the chief engineer had disappeared round the corner of the skylight.
Yes, no doubt--he thought; but to blurt out his knowledge would not advance his prospects.
On the contrary, it would blast them utterly as likely as not. He dreaded another failure.
He had a vague consciousness of not being much liked by his fellows in this part of the world;
inexplicably enough, for he had done nothing to them. Envy, he supposed. People were always
down on a clever chap who made no bones about his determination to get on. To do your duty
and count on the gratitude of that brute Massy would be sheer folly. He was a bad lot. Unmanly!
A vicious man! Bad! Bad! A brute! A brute without a spark of anything human about him; without
so much as simple curiosity even, or else surely he would have responded in some way to all
these hints he had been given. . . . Such insensibility was almost mysterious. Massy's state
of exasperation seemed to Sterne to have made him stupid beyond the ordinary silliness of shipowners.

Sterne, meditating on the embarrassments of that stupidity, forgot himself completely. His
stony, unwinking stare was fixed on the planks of the deck.

The slight quiver agitating the whole fabric of the ship was more perceptible in the silent
river, shaded and still like a forest path. The Sofala, gliding with an even motion, had passed
beyond the coast-belt of mud and mangroves. The shores rose higher, in firm sloping banks,
and the forest of big trees came down to the brink. Where the earth had been crumbled by the
floods it showed a steep brown cut, denuding a mass of roots intertwined as if wrestling underground;
and in the air, the interlaced boughs, bound and loaded with creepers, carried on the struggle
for life, mingled their foliage in one solid wall of leaves, with here and there the shape
of an enormous dark pillar soaring, or a ragged opening, as if torn by the flight of a cannonball,
disclosing the impenetrable gloom within, the secular inviolable shade of the virgin forest.
The thump of the engines reverberated regularly like the strokes of a metronome beating the
measure of the vast silence, the shadow of the western wall had fallen across the river, and
the smoke pouring backwards from the funnel eddied down behind the ship, spread a thin dusky
veil over the somber water, which, checked by the flood-tide, seemed to lie stagnant in the
whole straight length of the reaches.

Sterne's body, as if rooted on the spot, trembled slightly from top to toe with the internal
vibration of the ship; from under his feet came sometimes a sudden clang of iron, the noisy
burst of a shout below; to the right the leaves of the tree-tops caught the rays of the low
sun, and seemed to shine with a golden green light of their own shimmering around the highest
boughs which stood out black against a smooth blue sky that seemed to droop over the bed of
the river like the roof of a tent. The passengers for Batu Beru, kneeling on the planks, were
engaged in rolling their bedding of mats busily; they tied up bundles, they snapped the locks
of wooden chests. A pockmarked peddler of small wares threw his head back to drain into his
throat the last drops out of an earthenware bottle before putting it away in a roll of blankets.
Knots of traveling traders standing about the deck conversed in low tones; the followers of
a small Rajah from down the coast, broad-faced, simple young fellows in white drawers and round
white cotton caps with their colored sarongs twisted across their bronze shoulders, squatted
on their hams on the hatch, chewing betel with bright red mouths as if they had been tasting
blood. Their spears, lying piled up together within the circle of their bare toes, resembled
a casual bundle of dry bamboos; a thin, livid Chinaman, with a bulky package wrapped up in
leaves already thrust under his arm, gazed ahead eagerly; a wandering Kling rubbed his teeth
with a bit of wood, pouring over the side a bright stream of water out of his lips; the fat
Rajah dozed in a shabby deck-chair,--and at the turn of every bend the two walls of leaves
reappeared running parallel along the banks, with their impenetrable solidity fading at the
top to a vaporous mistiness of countless slender twigs growing free, of young delicate branches
shooting from the topmost limbs of hoary trunks, of feathery heads of climbers like delicate
silver sprays standing up without a quiver. There was not a sign of a clearing anywhere; not
a trace of human habitation, except when in one place, on the bare end of a low point under
an isolated group of slender tree-ferns, the jagged, tangled remnants of an old hut on piles
appeared with that peculiar aspect of ruined bamboo walls that look as if smashed with a club.
Farther on, half hidden under the drooping bushes, a canoe containing a man and a woman, together
with a dozen green cocoanuts in a heap, rocked helplessly after the Sofala had passed, like
a navigating contrivance of venturesome insects, of traveling ants; while two glassy folds
of water streaming away from each bow of the steamer across the whole width of the river ran
with her up stream smoothly, fretting their outer ends into a brown whispering tumble of froth
against the miry foot of each bank.

"I must," thought Sterne, "bring that brute Massy to his bearings. It's getting too absurd
in the end. Here's the old man up there buried in his chair--he may just as well be in his
grave for all the use he'll ever be in the world--and the Serang's in charge. Because that's
what he is. In charge. In the place that's mine by rights. I must bring that savage brute to
his bearings. I'll do it at once, too . . ."

When the mate made an abrupt start, a little brown half-naked boy, with large black eyes, and
the string of a written charm round his neck, became panic-struck at once. He dropped the banana
he had been munching, and ran to the knee of a grave dark Arab in flowing robes, sitting like
a Biblical figure, incongruously, on a yellow tin trunk corded with a rope of twisted rattan.
The father, unmoved, put out his hand to pat the little shaven poll protectingly.

XI

Sterne crossed the deck upon the track of the chief engineer. Jack, the second, retreating
backwards down the engine-room ladder, and still wiping his hands, treated him to an incomprehensible
grin of white teeth out of his grimy hard face; Massy was nowhere to be seen. He must have
gone straight into his berth. Sterne scratched at the door softly, then, putting his lips to
the rose of the ventilator, said--

"I must speak to you, Mr. Massy. Just give me a minute or two."

"I am busy. Go away from my door."

"But pray, Mr. Massy . . ."

"You go away. D'you hear? Take yourself off altogether--to the other end of the ship--quite
away . . ." The voice inside dropped low. "To the devil."

Sterne paused: then very quietly--

"It's rather pressing. When do you think you will be at liberty, sir?"

The answer to this was an exasperated "Never"; and at once Sterne, with a very firm expression
of face, turned the handle.

Mr. Massy's stateroom--a narrow, one-berth cabin--smelt strongly of soap, and presented to
view a swept, dusted, unadorned neatness, not so much bare as barren, not so much severe as
starved and lacking in humanity, like the ward of a public hospital, or rather (owing to the
small size) like the clean retreat of a desperately poor but exemplary person. Not a single
photograph frame ornamented the bulkheads; not a single article of clothing, not as much as
a spare cap, hung from the brass hooks. All the inside was painted in one plain tint of pale
blue; two big sea-chests in sailcloth covers and with iron padlocks fitted exactly in the space
under the bunk. One glance was enough to embrace all the strip of scrubbed planks within the
four unconcealed corners. The absence of the usual settee was striking; the teak-wood top of
the washing-stand seemed hermetically closed, and so was the lid of the writing-desk, which
protruded from the partition at the foot of the bed-place, containing a mattress as thin as
a pancake under a threadbare blanket with a faded red stripe, and a folded mosquito-net against
the nights spent in harbor. There was not a scrap of paper anywhere in sight, no boots on the
floor, no litter of any sort, not a speck of dust anywhere; no traces of pipe-ash even, which,
in a heavy smoker, was morally revolting, like a manifestation of extreme hypocrisy; and the
bottom of the old wooden arm-chair (the only seat there), polished with much use, shone as
if its shabbiness had been waxed. The screen of leaves on the bank, passing as if unrolled
endlessly in the round opening of the port, sent a wavering network of light and shade into
the place.

Sterne, holding the door open with one hand, had thrust in his head and shoulders. At this
amazing intrusion Massy, who was doing absolutely nothing, jumped up speechless.

"Don't call names," murmured Sterne hurriedly. "I won't be called names. I think of nothing
but your good, Mr. Massy."

A pause as of extreme astonishment followed. They both seemed to have lost their tongues. Then
the mate went on with a discreet glibness.

"You simply couldn't conceive what's going on on board your ship. It wouldn't enter your head
for a moment. You are too good--too--too upright, Mr. Massy, to suspect anybody of such a .
. . It's enough to make your hair stand on end."

He watched for the effect: Massy seemed dazed, uncomprehending. He only passed the palm of
his hand on the coal-black wisps plastered across the top of his head. In a tone suddenly changed
to confidential audacity Sterne hastened on.

"Remember that there's only six weeks left to run . . ." The other was looking at him stonily
. . . "so anyhow you shall require a captain for the ship before long."

Then only, as if that suggestion had scarified his flesh in the manner of red-hot iron, Massy
gave a start and seemed ready to shriek. He contained himself by a great effort.

"Require a captain," he repeated with scathing slowness. "Who requires a captain? You dare
to tell me that I need any of you humbugging sailors to run my ship. You and your likes have
been fattening on me for years. It would have hurt me less to throw my money overboard. Pam--pe--red
us--e--less f-f-f-frauds. The old ship knows as much as the best of you." He snapped his teeth
audibly and growled through them, "The silly law requires a captain."

Sterne had taken heart of grace meantime.

"And the silly insurance people too, as well," he said lightly. "But never mind that. What
I want to ask is: Why shouldn't I do, sir? I don't say but you could take a steamer about the
world as well as any of us sailors. I don't pretend to tell you that it is a very great trick
. . ." He emitted a short, hollow guffaw, familiarly . . . "I didn't make the law--but there
it is; and I am an active young fellow! I quite hold with your ideas; I know your ways by this
time, Mr. Massy. I wouldn't try to give myself airs like that--that--er lazy specimen of an
old man up there."

He put a marked emphasis on the last sentence, to lead Massy away from the track in case .
. . but he did not doubt of now holding his success. The chief engineer seemed nonplused, like
a slow man invited to catch hold of a whirligig of some sort.

"What you want, sir, is a chap with no nonsense about him, who would be content to be your
sailing-master. Quite right, too. Well, I am fit for the work as much as that Serang. Because
that's what it amounts to. Do you know, sir, that a dam' Malay like a monkey is in charge of
your ship--and no one else. Just listen to his feet pit-patting above us on the bridge--real
officer in charge. He's taking her up the river while the great man is wallowing in the chair--perhaps
asleep; and if he is, that would not make it much worse either--take my word for it."

He tried to thrust himself farther in. Massy, with lowered forehead, one hand grasping the
back of the arm-chair, did not budge.

"You think, sir, that the man has got you tight in his agreement . . ." Massy raised a heavy
snarling face at this . . . "Well, sir, one can't help hearing of it on board. It's no secret.
And it has been the talk on shore for years; fellows have been making bets about it. No, sir!
It's you who have got him at your mercy. You will say that you can't dismiss him for indolence.
Difficult to prove in court, and so on. Why, yes. But if you say the word, sir, I can tell
you something about his indolence that will give you the clear right to fire him out on the
spot and put me in charge for the rest of this very trip--yes, sir, before we leave Batu Beru--and
make him pay a dollar a day for his keep till we get back, if you like. Now, what do you think
of that? Come, sir. Say the word. It's really well worth your while, and I am quite ready to
take your bare word. A definite statement from you would be as good as a bond."

His eyes began to shine. He insisted. A simple statement,--and he thought to himself that he
would manage somehow to stick in his berth as long as it suited him. He would make himself
indispensable; the ship had a bad name in her port; it would be easy to scare the fellows off.
Massy would have to keep him.

"A definite statement from me would be enough," Massy repeated slowly.

"Yes, sir. It would." Sterne stuck out his chin cheerily and blinked at close quarters with
that unconscious impudence which had the power to enrage Massy beyond anything.

The engineer spoke very distinctly.

"Listen well to me, then, Mr. Sterne: I wouldn't--d'ye hear?--I wouldn't promise you the value
of two pence for anything you can tell me."

He struck Sterne's arm away with a smart blow, and catching hold of the handle pulled the door
to. The terrific slam darkened the cabin instantaneously to his eye as if after the flash of
an explosion. At once he dropped into the chair. "Oh, no! You don't!" he whispered faintly.

The ship had in that place to shave the bank so close that the gigantic wall of leaves came
gliding like a shutter against the port; the darkness of the primeval forest seemed to flow
into that bare cabin with the odor of rotting leaves, of sodden soil--the strong muddy smell
of the living earth steaming uncovered after the passing of a deluge. The bushes swished loudly
alongside; above there was a series of crackling sounds, with a sharp rain of small broken
branches falling on the bridge; a creeper with a great rustle snapped on the head of a boat
davit, and a long, luxuriant green twig actually whipped in and out of the open port, leaving
behind a few torn leaves that remained suddenly at rest on Mr. Massy's blanket. Then, the ship
sheering out in the stream, the light began to return but did not augment beyond a subdued
clearness: for the sun was very low already, and the river, wending its sinuous course through
a multitude of secular trees as if at the bottom of a precipitous gorge, had been already invaded
by a deepening gloom--the swift precursor of the night.

"Oh, no, you don't!" murmured the engineer again. His lips trembled almost imperceptibly; his
hands too, a little: and to calm himself he opened the writing-desk, spread out a sheet of
thin grayish paper covered with a mass of printed figures and began to scan them attentively
for the twentieth time this trip at least.

With his elbows propped, his head between his hands, he seemed to lose himself in the study
of an abstruse problem in mathematics. It was the list of the winning numbers from the last
drawing of the great lottery which had been the one inspiring fact of so many years of his
existence. The conception of a life deprived of that periodical sheet of paper had slipped
away from him entirely, as another man, according to his nature, would not have been able to
conceive a world without fresh air, without activity, or without affection. A great pile of
flimsy sheets had been growing for years in his desk, while the Sofala, driven by the faithful
Jack, wore out her boilers in tramping up and down the Straits, from cape to cape, from river
to river, from bay to bay; accumulating by that hard labor of an overworked, starved ship the
blackened mass of these documents. Massy kept them under lock and key like a treasure. There
was in them, as in the experience of life, the fascination of hope, the excitement of a half-penetrated
mystery, the longing of a half-satisfied desire.

For days together, on a trip, he would shut himself up in his berth with them: the thump of
the toiling engines pulsated in his ear; and he would weary his brain poring over the rows
of disconnected figures, bewildering by their senseless sequence, resembling the hazards of
destiny itself. He nourished a conviction that there must be some logic lurking somewhere in
the results of chance. He thought he had seen its very form. His head swam; his limbs ached;
he puffed at his pipe mechanically; a contemplative stupor would soothe the fretfulness of
his temper, like the passive bodily quietude procured by a drug, while the intellect remains
tensely on the stretch. Nine, nine, aught, four, two. He made a note. The next winning number
of the great prize was forty-seven thousand and five. These numbers of course would have to
be avoided in the future when writing to Manilla for the tickets. He mumbled, pencil in hand
. . . "and five. Hm . . . hm." He wetted his finger: the papers rustled. Ha! But what's this?
Three years ago, in the September drawing, it was number nine, aught, four, two that took the
first prize. Most remarkable. There was a hint there of a definite rule! He was afraid of missing
some recondite principle in the overwhelming wealth of his material. What could it be? and
for half an hour he would remain dead still, bent low over the desk, without twitching a muscle.
At his back the whole berth would be thick with a heavy body of smoke, as if a bomb had burst
in there, unnoticed, unheard.

At last he would lock up the desk with the decision of unshaken confidence, jump and go out.
He would walk swiftly back and forth on that part of the foredeck which was kept clear of the
lumber and of the bodies of the native passengers. They were a great nuisance, but they were
also a source of profit that could not be disdained. He needed every penny of profit the Sofala
could make. Little enough it was, in all conscience! The incertitude of chance gave him no
concern, since he had somehow arrived at the conviction that, in the course of years, every
number was bound to have his winning turn. It was simply a matter of time and of taking as
many tickets as he could afford for every drawing. He generally took rather more; all the earnings
of the ship went that way, and also the wages he allowed himself as chief engineer. It was
the wages he paid to others that he begrudged with a reasoned and at the same time a passionate
regret. He scowled at the lascars with their deck brooms, at the quartermasters rubbing the
brass rails with greasy rags; he was eager to shake his fist and roar abuse in bad Malay at
the poor carpenter--a timid, sickly, opium-fuddled Chinaman, in loose blue drawers for all
costume, who invariably dropped his tools and fled below, with streaming tail and shaking all
over, before the fury of that "devil." But it was when he raised up his eyes to the bridge
where one of these sailor frauds was always planted by law in charge of his ship that he felt
almost dizzy with rage. He abominated them all; it was an old feud, from the time he first
went to sea, an unlicked cub with a great opinion of himself, in the engine-room. The slights
that had been put upon him. The persecutions he had suffered at the hands of skippers--of absolute
nobodies in a steamship after all. And now that he had risen to be a shipowner they were still
a plague to him: he had absolutely to pay away precious money to the conceited useless loafers:--As
if a fully qualified engineer--who was the owner as well--were not fit to be trusted with the
whole charge of a ship. Well! he made it pretty warm for them; but it was a poor consolation.
He had come in time to hate the ship too for the repairs she required, for the coal-bills he
had to pay, for the poor beggarly freights she earned. He would clench his hand as he walked
and hit the rail a sudden blow, viciously, as though she could be made to feel pain. And yet
he could not do without er; he needed her; he must hang on to her tooth and nail to keep his
head above water till the expected flood of fortune came sweeping up and landed him safely
on the high shore of his ambition.

It was now to do nothing, nothing whatever, and have plenty of money to do it on. He had tasted
of power, the highest form of it his limited experience was aware of--the power of shipowning.
What a deception! Vanity of vanities! He wondered at his folly. He had thrown away the substance
for the shadow. Of the gratification of wealth he did not know enough to excite his imagination
with any visions of luxury. [902] On quitting the island Johnson wrote: 'We now left those illustrious
ruins, by which Mr. Boswell was much affected, nor would I willingly be thought to have looked upon
them without some emotion.' Ib. p. 150.

[903] Psalm xc. 4. Five weeks later he wrote:--'I have been as wild as ever;' and then comes a
passage which the Editor has thought it needful to suppress. Ib.p.128.

[905] Boswell here speaks as an Englishman. He should have written 'a M'Ginnis.' See ante, p.
135, note 3.

[906] 'The fruitfulness of Iona is now its whole prosperity. The inhabitants are remarkably gross,
and remarkably neglected; I know not if they are visited by any minister. The island, which was
once the metropolis of learning and piety, has now no school for education, nor temple for worship,
only two inhabitants that can speak English, and not one that can write or read.' Johnson's
Works, ix. 149. Scott, who visited it in 1810, writes:--'There are many monuments of singular
curiosity, forming a strange contrast to the squalid and dejected
poverty of the present inhabitants.' Lockhart's Scott, ed.

1839, iii. 285. In 1814, on a second visit, he writes:--'Iona, the last time I saw it, seemed
to me to contain the most wretched people I had anywhere seen. But either they have got better
since I was here, or my eyes, familiarized with the wretchedness of Zetland and the Harris, are less
shocked with that of Iona.' He found a schoolmaster there. Ib. iv. 324.

[907] Johnson's Jacobite friend, Dr. King (ante, i. 279), says of Pulteney, on his being made
Earl of Bath:--'He deserted the cause of his country; he betrayed his friends and adherents; he
ruined his character, and from a most glorious eminence sunk down to a degree of contempt. The
first time Sir Robert (who was now Earl of Orford) met him in the House of Lords, he threw
out this reproach:--"My Lord Bath, you and I are now two as insignificant
men as any in England."

In which he spoke the truth of my Lord Bath, but not of himself. For my Lord Orford was consulted
by the ministers to the last day of his life.' King's Anec. p. 43.

[908] See ante, i. 431, and iii. 326.

[909] 'Sir Robert Walpole detested war. This made Dr. Johnson say of him, "He was the best minister
this country ever had, as, if we would have let him (he speaks of his own violent faction), he
would have kept the country in perpetual peace."' Seward's Biographiana, p. 554. See ante, i. 131.

Appendix C.

[911] I think it incumbent on me to make some observation on this strong satirical sally on my
classical companion, Mr. Wilkes. Reporting it lately from memory, in his presence, I expressed
it thus:--'They knew he would rob their shops, if he durst; they knew he would debauch their
daughters, if he could;' which, according to the French phrase, may be said renchérir on Dr.
Johnson; but on looking into my Journal, I found it as above, and would by no means make any
addition.

Mr. Wilkes received both readings with a good humour that I cannot enough admire. Indeed both he
and I (as, with respect to myself, the reader has more than once had occasion to observe in the
course of this Journal,) are too fond of a bon mot, not to relish it, though we should be ourselves
the object of it.

Let me add, in justice to the gentleman here mentioned, that at a subsequent period, he was
elected chief magistrate of London [in 1774], and discharged the duties of that high office with
great honour to himself, and advantage to the city. Some years before Dr. Johnson died, I was
fortunate enough to bring him and Mr. Wilkes together; the consequence of which was, that
they were ever afterwards on easy and not unfriendly terms. The particulars I shall have great
pleasure in relating at large in my Life of Dr. Johnson. BOSWELL. In the copy of Boswell's Letter to
the People of Scotland in the British Museum is entered in Boswell's own hand--

'Comes jucundus in via pro vehiculo est.

To John Wilkes, Esq.: as pleasant a companion as ever lived.

From the Author.

--will my Wilkes retreat, And see, once seen before, that ancient seat, etc.'

See ante, iii. 64, 183; iv. 101, 224, note 2.

[913] Our afternoon journey was through a country of such gloomy desolation that Mr. Boswell thought
no part of the Highlands equally terrifick.' Johnson's Works, ix.

150.

[914] Johnson describes Lochbuy as 'a true Highland laird, rough and haughty, and tenacious of
his dignity: who, hearing my name, inquired whether I was of the Johnstons of Glencoe (sic)
or of Ardnamurchan.' Ib.

[915] Boswell totally misapprehended Lochbuy's meaning. There are two septs of the powerful clan
of M'Donaid, who are called Mac-Ian, that is John's-son; and as Highlanders often translate their
names when they go to the Lowlands,--as Gregor-son for Mac-Gregor, Farquhar-son for Mac-Farquhar,--Lochbuy
supposed that Dr. Johnson might be one of the Mac-Ians of Ardnamurchan, or of Glencro. Boswell's
explanation was nothing to the purpose. The Johnstons are a clan distinguished in Scottish border
history, and as brave as any Highland clan that ever wore brogues; but they lay entirely out
of Lochbuy's knowledge--nor was he thinking of them. WALTER SCOTT.

[916] This maxim, however, has been controverted. See Blackstone's Commentaries, vol. ii. p.
291; and the authorities there quoted. BOSWELL. 'Blackstone says:--From these loose authorities,
which Fitzherbert does not hesitate to reject as being contrary to reason, the maxim that a
man shall not stultify himself hath been handed down as settled law;
though later opinions, feeling the inconvenience of the rule, have
in many points endeavoured to restrain it.' Ib. p. 292.

[917] Begging pardon of the Doctor and his conductor, I have often
seen and partaken of cold sheep's head at as good breakfast-tables
as ever they sat at.

This protest is something in the manner of the late Culrossie, who
fought a duel for the honour of Aberdeen butter.

I have passed over all the Doctor's other reproaches upon Scotland,
but the sheep's head I will defend totis viribus.

Dr. Johnson himself must have forgiven my zeal on this occasion;
for if, as he says, dinner be the thing of which a man thinks oftenest
during the day, breakfast must be that of which he thinks first in
the morning.

WALTER SCOTT.

I do not know where Johnson says this. Perhaps Scott was thinking of a passage in Mrs. Piozzi's
Anec. p. 149, where she writes that he said: 'A man seldom thinks with more earnestness of any
thing than he does of his dinner.'

[918] A horrible place it was. Johnson describes it (Works, ix. 152) as 'a deep subterraneous cavity,
walled on the sides, and arched on the top, into which the descent is through a narrow door,
by a ladder or a rope.'

[919] See ante, p. 177.

[920] Sir Allan M'Lean, like many Highland chiefs, was embarrassed in his private affairs, and
exposed to unpleasant solicitations from attorneys, called, in Scotland, writers (which indeed
was the chief motive of his retiring to Inchkenneth). Upon one occasion he made a visit to a
friend, then residing at Carron lodge, on the banks of the Carron,
where the banks of that river are studded with pretty villas: Sir
Allan, admiring the landscape, asked his friend, whom that handsome
seat belonged to.

'M---, the writer to the signet,' was the reply.

'Umph!' said Sir Allan, but not with an accent of assent, 'I mean that other house.' 'Oh ! that belongs
to a very honest fellow Jamie---, also a writer to the signet.' 'Umph!'
said the Highland chief of M'Lean with more emphasis than before,
'And yon smaller house?' 'That belongs to a Stirling man; I forget
his name, but I am sure he is a writer too; for---.' Sir Allan who
had recoiled a quarter of a circle backward at every response, now
wheeled the circle entire and turned his back on the landscape, saying,
'My good friend, I must own you have a pretty situation here; but
d--n your neighbourhood.' WALTER SCOTT.

[921] Loch Awe.

[922] 'Pope's talent lay remarkably in what one may naturally enough
term the condensation of thoughts.

I think no other English poet ever brought so much sense into the
same number of lines with equal smoothness, ease, and poetical beauty.

Let him who doubts of this peruse his Essay on Man with attention.' Shenstone's Essays on Men
and Manners.

[Works, 4th edit. ii. 159.] 'He [Gray] approved an observation of Shenstone, that "Pope had the
art of condensing a thought."' Nicholls' Reminiscences of Gray, p.
37.

And Swift [in his Lines on the death of Dr. Swift], himself a great
condenser, says--

'In Pope I cannot read a line But with a sigh I
wish it mine; When he can in one couplet fix More sense than I can
do in six.'

P. CUNNINGHAM.

[923] He is described by Walpole in his Letters, viii.

5.

[924] 'The night came on while we had yet a great part of the way
to go, though not so dark but that we could discern the cataracts
which poured down the hills on one side, and fell into one general
channel, that ran with great violence on the other.

155.

[925] I never tasted whiskey except once for experiment at the inn
in Inverary, when I thought it preferable to any English malt brandy.

It was strong, but not pungent, and was free from the empyreumatick taste or smell. What was
the process I had no opportunity of inquiring, nor do I wish to improve
the art of making poison pleasant.' Johnson's Works, ix.

52. Smollett, medical man though he was, looked upon whisky as anything but poison. 'I am told
that it is given with great success to infants, as a cordial in the
confluent small-pox.' Humphry Clinker.

Letter of Sept. 3.

[926] Regale in this sense is not in Johnson's Dictionary. It was, however, a favourite word at this
time. Thus, Mrs. Piozzi, in her Journey through France, ii. 297, says:--'A large dish of hot
chocolate thickened with bread and cream is a common afternoon's
regale here.' Miss Burney often uses the word.

[927] Boswell, in answering Garrick's letter seven months later, improved
on this comparison.

'It was,' he writes, 'a pine-apple of the finest flavour, which had
a high zest indeed among the heath-covered mountains of Scotia.' Garrick
Corres. i. 621.

[933] See ante, p. 129.

[936] I have suppressed my friend's name from an apprehension of wounding
his sensibility; but I would not withhold from my readers a passage
which shews Mr. Garrick's mode of writing as the Manager of a Theatre,
and contains a pleasing trait of his domestick life.

His judgment of dramatick pieces, so far as concerns their exhibition on the stage, must be allowed
to have considerable weight. But from the effect which a perusal of the tragedy here condemned had
upon myself, and from the opinions of some eminent criticks, I venture to pronounce that it
has much poetical merit; and its authour has distinguished himself by several performances
which shew that the epithet poetaster was, in the present instance, much misapplied. BOSWELL.
Johnson mentioned this quarrel between Garrick and the poet on March
25, 1773 (Piozzi Letters, i. 80).

'M---- is preparing a whole pamphlet against G----, and G---- is, I suppose, collecting materials
to confute M----.' M---- was Mickle, the translator of the Lusiad and author of the Ballad
of Cumnor Hall (ante, ii. 182). Had it not been for this 'poetaster,' Kenilworth might never
have been written. Scott, in the preface, tells how 'the first stanza of Cunmor Hall had a
peculiar species of enchantment for his youthful ear, the force of which is not even now entirely
spent.' The play that was refused was the Siege of Marseilles. Ever since the success of Hughes's
Siege of Damascus 'a siege had become a popular title' (ante, iii. 259, note 1).

[938] Dr. Morell once entered the school-room at Winchester College, 'in which some junior boys were
writing their exercises, one of whom, struck no less with his air and manner than with the questions
he put to them, whispered to his school-fellows, "Is he not a fine old Grecian?" The Doctor,
overhearing this, turned hastily round and exclaimed, "I am indeed an old Grecian, my little man.
Did you never see my head before my Thesaurus?"' The Praepostors, learning the dignity of their
visitor, in a most respectful manner showed him the College. Wooll's Life of Dr. Warton, p.
329. Mason writing to Horace Walpole about some odes, says:--'They are so lopped and mangled,
that they are worse now than the productions of Handel's poet, Dr. Morell.' Walpole's Letters,
v. 420. Morell compiled the words for Handel's Oratorios.

[940] I doubt whether any other instance can be found of love being sent to Johnson.

[946] Elizabeth Gunning, celebrated (like her sister, Lady Coventry) for her personal charms,
had been previously Duchess of Hamilton, and was mother of Douglas, Duke of Hamilton, the competitor
for the Douglas property with the late Lord Douglas: she was, of course, prejudiced against Boswell,
who had shewn all the bustling importance of his character in the Douglas cause, and it was
said, I know not on what authority, that he headed the mob which broke the windows of some
of the judges, and of Lord Auchinleck, his father, in particular.

I found no instance here of extraordinary longevity. A cottager grows
old over his oaten cakes like a citizen at a turtle feast. He is,
indeed, seldom incommoded by corpulence, Poverty preserves him from
sinking under the burden of himself, but he escapes no other injury
of time.' Johnson's Works, ix. 81.

maiden name was Gunning. The Duchess of Argyle was alive when Boswell
published his Journal.

Lord Macaulay's grandfather who was thus reprimanded. Mr. Trevelyan
remarks (Life of Macaulay, i. 7), 'When we think what well-known ground
this [subject] was to Lord Macaulay, it is impossible to suppress
a wish that the great talker had been at hand to avenge his grandfather.'
The result might well have been, however, that the great talker would
have been reduced to silence--one of those brilliant flashes of silence

paragraph which he read. BOSWELL. He began to read it on August 18
(ante, p. 58, note 2).

[969] See ante, ii. 320.

[970] Act i. sc.
1. The best known passage in Douglas is the speech beginning 'My name
is Norval.' Act ii. The play affords a few quotations more or less
known, as:--

'I found myself As women wish to be who love their lords.'
Act i.

'He seldom errs Who thinks the worse he can of womankind.'
Act iii. He managed to keep an almost military discipline amongst the coolies
of the estate he had dragged into the light of day out of the tangle and shadows of the jungle;
and the white shirt he put on every evening with its stiff glossy front and high collar looked
as if he had meant to preserve the decent ceremony of evening-dress, but had wound a thick
crimson sash above his hips as a concession to the wilderness, once his adversary, now his
vanquished companion.

Moreover, it was a hygienic precaution. Worn wide open in front, a short jacket of some airy
silken stuff floated from his shoulders. His fluffy, fair hair, thin at the top, curled slightly
at the sides; a carefully arranged mustache, an ungarnished forehead, the gleam of low patent
shoes peeping under the wide bottom of trowsers cut straight from the same stuff as the gossamer
coat, completed a figure recalling, with its sash, a pirate chief of romance, and at the same
time the elegance of a slightly bald dandy indulging, in seclusion, a taste for unorthodox costume.

It was his evening get-up. The proper time for the Sofala to arrive at Batu Beru was an hour
before sunset, and he looked picturesque, and somehow quite correct too, walking at the water's
edge on the background of grass slope crowned with a low long bungalow with an immensely steep
roof of palm thatch, and clad to the eaves in flowering creepers. While the Sofala was being
made fast he strolled in the shade of the few trees left near the landing-place, waiting till
he could go on board. Her white men were not of his kind. The old Sultan (though his wistful
invasions were a nuisance) was really much more acceptable to his fastidious taste. But still
they were white; the periodical visits of the ship made a break in the well-filled sameness
of the days without disturbing his privacy. Moreover, they were necessary from a business point
of view; and through a strain of preciseness in his nature he was irritated when she failed
to appear at the appointed time.

The cause of the irregularity was too absurd, and Massy, in his opinion, was a contemptible
idiot. The first time the Sofala reappeared under the new agreement swinging out of the bend
below, after he had almost given up all hope of ever seeing her again, he felt so angry that
he did not go down at once to the landing-place. His servants had come running to him with
the news, and he had dragged a chair close against the front rail of the veranda, spread his
elbows out, rested his chin on his hands, and went on glaring at her fixedly while she was
being made fast opposite his house. He could make out easily all the white faces on board.
Who on earth was that kind of patriarch they had got there on the bridge now?

At last he sprang up and walked down the gravel path. It was a fact that the very gravel for
his paths had been imported by the Sofala. Exasperated out of his quiet superciliousness, without
looking at anyone right or left, he accosted Massy straightway in so determined a manner that
the engineer, taken aback, began to stammer unintelligibly. Nothing could be heard but the
words: "Mr. Van Wyk . . . Indeed, Mr. Van Wyk . . . For the future, Mr. Van Wyk"--and by the
suffusion of blood Massy's vast bilious face acquired an unnatural orange tint, out of which
the disconcerted coal-black eyes shone in an extraordinary manner.

"Nonsense. I am tired of this. I wonder you have the impudence to come alongside my jetty as
if I had it made for your convenience alone."

Massy tried to protest earnestly. Mr. Van Wyk was very angry. He had a good mind to ask that
German firm--those people in Malacca--what was their name?--boats with green funnels. They
would be only too glad of the opening to put one of their small steamers on the run. Yes; Schnitzler,
Jacob Schnitzler, would in a moment. Yes. He had decided to write without delay.

In his agitation Massy caught up his falling pipe.

"You don't mean it, sir!" he shrieked.

"You shouldn't mismanage your business in this ridiculous manner."

Mr. Van Wyk turned on his heel. The other three whites on the bridge had not stirred during
the scene. Massy walked hastily from side to side, puffed out his cheeks, suffocated.

"Stuck up Dutchman!"

And he moaned out feverishly a long tale of griefs. The efforts he had made for all these years
to please that man. This was the return you got for it, eh? Pretty. Write to Schnitzler--let
in the green-funnel boats--get an old Hamburg Jew to ruin him. No, really he could laugh. .
. . He laughed sobbingly. . . . Ha! ha! ha! And make him carry the letter in his own ship presumably.

He stumbled across a grating and swore. He would not hesitate to fling the Dutchman's correspondence
overboard--the whole confounded bundle. He had never, never made any charge for that accommodation.
But Captain Whalley, his new partner, would not let him probably; besides, it would be only
putting off the evil day. For his own part he would make a hole in the water rather than look
on tamely at the green funnels overrunning his trade.

He raved aloud. The China boys hung back with the dishes at the foot of the ladder. He yelled
from the bridge down at the deck, "Aren't we going to have any chow this evening at all?" then
turned violently to Captain Whalley, who waited, grave and patient, at the head of the table,
smoothing his beard in silence now and then with a forbearing gesture.

"You don't seem to care what happens to me. Don't you see that this affects your interests
as much as mine? It's no joking matter."

He took the foot of the table growling between his teeth.

"Unless you have a few thousands put away somewhere. I haven't."

Mr. Van Wyk dined in his thoroughly lit-up bungalow, putting a point of splendor in the night
of his clearing above the dark bank of the river. Afterwards he sat down to his piano, and
in a pause he became aware of slow footsteps passing on the path along the front. A plank or
two creaked under a heavy tread; he swung half round on the music-stool, listening with his
fingertips at rest on the keyboard. His little terrier barked violently, backing in from the
veranda. A deep voice apologized gravely for "this intrusion." He walked out quickly.

At the head of the steps the patriarchal figure, who was the new captain of the Sofala apparently
(he had seen a round dozen of them, but not one of that sort), towered without advancing. The
little dog barked unceasingly, till a flick of Mr. Van Wyk's handkerchief made him spring aside
into silence. Captain Whalley, opening the matter, was met by a punctiliously polite but determined
opposition.

They carried on their discussion standing where they had come face to face. Mr. Van Wyk observed
his visitor with attention. Then at last, as if forced out of his reserve--

"I am surprised that you should intercede for such a confounded fool."

This outbreak was almost complimentary, as if its meaning had been, "That such a man as you
should intercede!" Captain Whalley let it pass by without flinching. One would have thought
he had heard nothing. He simply went on to state that he was personally interested in putting
things straight between them. Personally . . .

But Mr. Van Wyk, really carried away by his disgust with Massy, became very incisive--

"Indeed--if I am to be frank with you--his whole character does not seem to me particularly
estimable or trustworthy . . ."

Captain Whalley, always straight, seemed to grow an inch taller and broader, as if the girth
of his chest had suddenly expanded under his beard.

"My dear sir, you don't think I came here to discuss a man with whom I am--I am--h'm--closely
associated."

A sort of solemn silence lasted for a moment. He was not used to asking favors, but the importance
he attached to this affair had made him willing to try. . . . Mr. Van Wyk, favorably impressed,
and suddenly mollified by a desire to laugh, interrupted--

"That's all right if you make it a personal matter; but you can do no less than sit down and
smoke a cigar with me."

A slight pause, then Captain Whalley stepped forward heavily. As to the regularity of the service,
for the future he made himself responsible for it; and his name was Whalley--perhaps to a sailor
(he was speaking to a sailor, was he not?) not altogether unfamiliar. There was a lighthouse
now, on an island. Maybe Mr. Van Wyk himself . . .

"Oh yes. Oh indeed." Mr. Van Wyk caught on at once. He indicated a chair. How very interesting.
For his own part he had seen some service in the last Acheen War, but had never been so far
East. Whalley Island? Of course. Now that was very interesting. What changes his guest must
have seen since.

"I can look further back even--on a whole half-century."

Captain Whalley expanded a bit. The flavor of a good cigar (it was a weakness) had gone straight
to his heart, also the civility of that young man. There was something in that accidental contact
of which he had been starved in his years of struggle.

The front wall retreating made a square recess furnished like a room. A lamp with a milky glass
shade, suspended below the slope of the high roof at the end of a slender brass chain, threw
a bright round of light upon a little table bearing an open book and an ivory paper-knife.
And, in the translucent shadows beyond, other tables could be seen, a number of easy-chairs
of various shapes, with a great profusion of skin rugs strewn on the teakwood planking all
over the veranda. The flowering creepers scented the air. Their foliage clipped out between
the uprights made as if several frames of thick unstirring leaves reflecting the lamplight
in a green glow. Through the opening at his elbow Captain Whalley could see the gangway lantern
of the Sofala burning dim by the shore, the shadowy masses of the town beyond the open lustrous
darkness of the river, and, as if hung along the straight edge of the projecting eaves, a narrow
black strip of the night sky full of stars--resplendent. The famous cigar in hand he had a
moment of complacency.

"A trifle. Somebody must lead the way. I just showed that the thing could be done; but you
men brought up to the use of steam cannot conceive the vast importance of my bit of venturesomeness
to the Eastern trade of the time. Why, that new route reduced the average time of a southern
passage by eleven days for more than half the year. Eleven days! It's on record. But the remarkable
thing--speaking to a sailor--I should say was . . ."

He talked well, without egotism, professionally. The powerful voice, produced without effort,
filled the bungalow even into the empty rooms with a deep and limpid resonance, seemed to make
a stillness outside; and Mr. Van Wyk was surprised by the serene quality of its tone, like
the perfection of manly gentleness. Nursing one small foot, in a silk sock and a patent leather
shoe, on his knee, he was immensely entertained. It was as if nobody could talk like this now,
and the overshadowed eyes, the flowing white beard, the big frame, the serenity, the whole
temper of the man, were an amazing survival from the prehistoric times of the world coming
up to him out of the sea.

Captain Whalley had been also the pioneer of the early trade in the Gulf of Pe-tchi-li. He
even found occasion to mention that he had buried his "dear wife" there six-and-twenty years
ago. Mr. Van Wyk, impassive, could not help speculating in his mind swiftly as to the sort
of woman that would mate with such a man. Did they make an adventurous and well-matched pair?
No. Very possible she had been small, frail, no doubt very feminine--or most likely commonplace
with domestic instincts, utterly insignificant. But Captain Whalley was no garrulous bore,
and shaking his head as if to dissipate the momentary gloom that had settled on his handsome
old face, he alluded conversationally to Mr. Van Wyk's solitude.

Mr. Van Wyk affirmed that sometimes he had more company than he wanted. He mentioned smilingly
some of the peculiarities of his intercourse with "My Sultan." He made his visits in force.
Those people damaged his grass plot in front (it was not easy to obtain some approach to a
lawn in the tropics) and the other day had broken down some rare bushes he had planted over
there. And Captain Whalley remembered immediately that, in 'forty-seven, the then Sultan, "this
man's grandfather," had been notorious as a great protector of the piratical fleets of praus
from farther East. They had a safe refuge in the river at Batu Beru. He financed more especially
a Balinini chief called Haji Daman. Captain Whalley, nodding significantly his bushy white
eyebrows, had very good reason to know something of that. The world had progressed since that time.

Mr. Van Wyk demurred with unexpected acrimony. Progressed in what? he wanted to know.

Why, in knowledge of truth, in decency, in justice, in order--in honesty too, since men harmed
each other mostly from ignorance. It was, Captain Whalley concluded quaintly, more pleasant
to live in.

Mr. Van Wyk whimsically would not admit that Mr. Massy, for instance, was more pleasant naturally
than the Balinini pirates.

The river had not gained much by the change. They were in their way every bit as honest. Massy
was less ferocious than Haji Daman no doubt, but . . .

"And what about you, my good sir?" Captain Whalley laughed a deep soft laugh. "You are an improvement,
surely."

He continued in a vein of pleasantry. A good cigar was better than a knock on the head--the
sort of welcome he would have found on this river forty or fifty years ago. Then leaning forward
slightly, he became earnestly serious. It seems as if, outside their own sea-gypsy tribes,
these rovers had hated all mankind with an incomprehensible, bloodthirsty hatred. Meantime
their depredations had been stopped, and what was the consequence? The new generation was orderly,
peaceable, settled in prosperous villages. He could speak from personal knowledge. And even
the few survivors of that time--old men now--had changed so much, that it would have been unkind
to remember against them that they had ever slit a throat in their lives. He had one especially
in his mind's eye: a dignified, venerable headman of a certain large coast village about sixty
miles sou'west of Tampasuk. It did one's heart good to see him--to hear that man speak. He
might have been a ferocious savage once. What men wanted was to be checked by superior intelligence,
by superior knowledge, by superior force too--yes, by force held in trust from God and sanctified
by its use in accordance with His declared will. Captain Whalley believed a disposition for
good existed in every man, even if the world were not a very happy place as a whole. In the
wisdom of men he had not so much confidence. The disposition had to be helped up pretty sharply
sometimes, he admitted. They might be silly, wrongheaded, unhappy; but naturally evil--no.
There was at bottom a complete harmlessness at least . . .

"Is there?" Mr. Van Wyk snapped acrimoniously.

Captain Whalley laughed at the interjection, in the good humor of large, tolerating certitude.
He could look back at half a century, he pointed out. The smoke oozed placidly through the
white hairs hiding his kindly lips.

"At all events," he resumed after a pause, "I am glad that they've had no time to do you much
harm as yet."

This allusion to his comparative youthfulness did not offend Mr. Van Wyk, who got up and wriggled
his shoulders with an enigmatic half-smile. They walked out together amicably into the starry
night towards the river-side. Their footsteps resounded unequally on the dark path. At the
shore end of the gangway the lantern, hung low to the handrail, threw a vivid light on the
white legs and the big black feet of Mr. Massy waiting about anxiously. From the waist upwards
he remained shadowy, with a row of buttons gleaming up to the vague outline of his chin.

"You may thank Captain Whalley for this," Mr. Van Wyk said curtly to him before turning away.

The lamps on the veranda flung three long squares of light between the uprights far over the
grass. A bat flitted before his face like a circling flake of velvety blackness. Along the
jasmine hedge the night air seemed heavy with the fall of perfumed dew; flowerbeds bordered
the path; the clipped bushes uprose in dark rounded clumps here and there before the house;
the dense foliage of creepers filtered the sheen of the lamplight within in a soft glow all
along the front; and everything near and far stood still in a great immobility, in a great
sweetness.

Mr. Van Wyk (a few years before he had had occasion to imagine himself treated more badly than
anybody alive had ever been by a woman) felt for Captain Whalley's optimistic views the disdain
of a man who had once been credulous himself. His disgust with the world (the woman for a time
had filled it for him completely) had taken the form of activity in retirement, because, though
capable of great depth of feeling, he was energetic and essentially practical. But there was
in that uncommon old sailor, drifting on the outskirts of his busy solitude, something that
fascinated his skepticism. His very simplicity (amusing enough) was like a delicate refinement
of an upright character. The striking dignity of manner could be nothing else, in a man reduced
to such a humble position, but the expression of something essentially noble in the character.
With all his trust in mankind he was no fool; the serenity of his temper at the end of so many
years, since it could not obviously have been appeased by success, wore an air of profound
wisdom. Mr. Van Wyk was amused at it sometimes. Even the very physical traits of the old captain
of the Sofala, his powerful frame, his reposeful mien, his intelligent, handsome face, the
big limbs, the benign courtesy, the touch of rugged severity in the shaggy eyebrows, made up
a seductive personality. Mr. Van Wyk disliked littleness of every kind, but there was nothing
small about that man, and in the exemplary regularity of many trips an intimacy had grown up
between them, a warm feeling at bottom under a kindly stateliness of forms agreeable to his
fastidiousness.

They kept their respective opinions on all worldly matters. His other convictions Captain Whalley
never intruded. The difference of their ages was like another bond between them. Once, when
twitted with the uncharitableness of his youth, Mr. Van Wyk, running his eye over the vast
proportions of his interlocutor, retorted in friendly banter--

"Oh. You'll come to my way of thinking yet. You'll have plenty of time. Don't call yourself
old: you look good for a round hundred."

But he could not help his stinging incisiveness, and though moderating it by an almost affectionate
smile, he added--

"And by then you will probably consent to die from sheer disgust."

Captain Whalley, smiling too, shook his head. "God forbid!"

He thought that perhaps on the whole he deserved something better than to die in such sentiments.
The time of course would have to come, and he trusted to his Maker to provide a manner of going
out of which he need not be ashamed. For the rest he hoped he would live to a hundred if need
be: other men had been known; it would be no miracle. He expected no miracles.

The pronounced, argumentative tone caused Mr. Van Wyk to raise his head and look at him steadily.
Captain Whalley was gazing fixedly with a rapt expression, as though he had seen his Creator's
favorable decree written in mysterious characters on the wall. He kept perfectly motionless
for a few seconds, then got his vast bulk on to his feet so impetuously that Mr. Van Wyk was
startled.

He struck first a heavy blow on his inflated chest: and, throwing out horizontally a big arm
that remained steady, extended in the air like the limb of a tree on a windless day--

"Not a pain or an ache there. Can you see this shake in the least?"

His voice was low, in an awing, confident contrast with the headlong emphasis of his movements.
He sat down abruptly.

"This isn't to boast of it, you know. I am nothing," he said in his effortless strong voice,
that seemed to come out as naturally as a river flows. He picked up the stump of the cigar
he had laid aside, and added peacefully, with a slight nod, "As it happens, my life is necessary;
it isn't my own, it isn't--God knows."

He did not say much for the rest of the evening, but several times Mr. Van Wyk detected a faint
smile of assurance flitting under the heavy mustache.

Later on Captain Whalley would now and then consent to dine "at the house." He could even be
induced to drink a glass of wine. "Don't think I am afraid of it, my good sir," he explained.
"There was a very good reason why I should give it up."

On another occasion, leaning back at ease, he remarked, "You have treated me most--most humanely,
my dear Mr. Van Wyk, from the very first."

"You'll admit there was some merit," Mr. Van Wyk hinted slyly. "An associate of that excellent
Massy. . . . Well, well, my dear captain, I won't say a word against him."

"It would be no use your saying anything against him," Captain Whalley affirmed a little moodily.
"As I've told you before, my life--my work, is necessary, not for myself alone. I can't choose"
. . . He paused, turned the glass before him right round. . . . "I have an only child--a daughter."

The ample downward sweep of his arm over the table seemed to suggest a small girl at a vast
distance. "I hope to see her once more before I die. Meantime it's enough to know that she
has me sound and solid, thank God. You can't understand how one feels. Bone of my bone, flesh
of my flesh; the very image of my poor wife. Well, she . . ."

Again he paused, then pronounced stoically the words, "She has a hard struggle."

And his head fell on his breast, his eyebrows remained knitted, as by an effort of meditation.
But generally his mind seemed steeped in the serenity of boundless trust in a higher power.
Mr. Van Wyk wondered sometimes how much of it was due to the splendid vitality of the man,
to the bodily vigor which seems to impart something of its force to the soul. But he had learned
to like him very much.

XIII

This was the reason why Mr. Sterne's confidential communication, delivered hurriedly on the
shore alongside the dark silent ship, had disturbed his equanimity. It was the most incomprehensible
and unexpected thing that could happen; and the perturbation of his spirit was so great that,
forgetting all about his letters, he ran rapidly up the bridge ladder.

The portable table was being put together for dinner to the left of the wheel by two pig-tailed
"boys," who as usual snarled at each other over the job, while another, a doleful, burly, very
yellow Chinaman, resembling Mr. Massy, waited apathetically with the cloth over his arm and
a pile of thick dinner-plates against his chest. A common cabin lamp with its globe missing,
brought up from below, had been hooked to the wooden framework of the awning; the side-screens
had been lowered all round; Captain Whalley filling the depths of the wicker-chair seemed to
sit benumbed in a canvas tent crudely lighted, and used for the storing of nautical objects;
a shabby steering-wheel, a battered brass binnacle on a stout mahogany stand, two dingy life-buoys,
an old cork fender lying in a corner, dilapidated deck-lockers with loops of thin rope instead
of door-handles.

He shook off the appearance of numbness to return Mr. Van Wyk's unusually brisk greeting, but
relapsed directly afterwards. To accept a pressing invitation to dinner "up at the house" cost
him another very visible physical effort. Mr. Van Wyk, perplexed, folded his arms, and leaning
back against the rail, with his little, black, shiny feet well out, examined him covertly.

"I've noticed of late that you are not quite yourself, old friend."

He put an affectionate gentleness into the last two words. The real intimacy of their intercourse
had never been so vividly expressed before.

"Tut, tut, tut!"

The wicker-chair creaked heavily.

"Irritable," commented Mr. Van Wyk to himself; and aloud, "I'll expect to see you in half an
hour, then," he said negligently, moving off.

"In half an hour," Captain Whalley's rigid silvery head repeated behind him as if out of a trance.

Amidships, below, two voices, close against the engineroom, could be heard answering each other--one
angry and slow, the other alert.

"I tell you the beast has locked himself in to get drunk."

"Can't help it now, Mr. Massy. After all, a man has a right to shut himself up in his cabin
in his own time."

"Not to get drunk."

"I heard him swear that the worry with the boilers was enough to drive any man to drink," Sterne
said maliciously.

Massy hissed out something about bursting the door in. Mr. Van Wyk, to avoid them, crossed
in the dark to the other side of the deserted deck. The planking of the little wharf rattled
faintly under his hasty feet.

"Mr. Van Wyk! Mr. Van Wyk!"

He walked on: somebody was running on the path. "You've forgotten to get your mail."

Sterne, holding a bundle of papers in his hand, caught up with him.

"Oh, thanks."

But, as the other continued at his elbow, Mr. Van Wyk stopped short. The overhanging eaves,
descending low upon the lighted front of the bungalow, threw their black straight-edged shadow
into the great body of the night on that side. Everything was very still. A tinkle of cutlery
and a slight jingle of glasses were heard. Mr. Van Wyk's servants were laying the table for
two on the veranda.

"I'm afraid you give me no credit whatever for my good intentions in the matter I've spoken
to you about," said Sterne.

"I simply don't understand you."

"Captain Whalley is a very audacious man, but he will understand that his game is up. That's
all that anybody need ever know of it from me. Believe me, I am very considerate in this, but
duty is duty. I don't want to make a fuss. All I ask you, as his friend, is to tell him from
me that the game's up. That will be sufficient."

Mr. Van Wyk felt a loathsome dismay at this queer privilege of friendship. He would not demean
himself by asking for the slightest explanation; to drive the other away with contumely he
did not think prudent--as yet, at any rate. So much assurance staggered him. Who could tell
what there could be in it, he thought? His regard for Captain Whalley had the tenacity of a
disinterested sentiment, and his practical instinct coming to his aid, he concealed his scorn.

"I gather, then, that this is something grave."

"Very grave," Sterne assented solemnly, delighted at having produced an effect at last. He
was ready to add some effusive protestations of regret at the "unavoidable necessity," but
Mr. Van Wyk cut him short--very civilly, however.

Once on the veranda Mr. Van Wyk put his hands in his pockets, and, straddling his legs, stared
down at a black panther skin lying on the floor before a rocking-chair. "It looks as if the
fellow had not the pluck to play his own precious game openly," he thought.

This was true enough. In the face of Massy's last rebuff Sterne dared not declare his knowledge.
His object was simply to get charge of the steamer and keep it for some time. Massy would never
forgive him for forcing himself on; but if Captain Whalley left the ship of his own accord,
the command would devolve upon him for the rest of the trip; so he hit upon the brilliant idea
of scaring the old man away. A vague menace, a mere hint, would be enough in such a brazen
case; and, with a strange admixture of compassion, he thought that Batu Beru was a very good
place for throwing up the sponge. The skipper could go ashore quietly, and stay with that Dutchman
of his. Weren't these two as thick as thieves together? And on reflection he seemed to see
that there was a way to work the whole thing through that great friend of the old man's. This
was another brilliant idea. He had an inborn preference for circuitous methods. In this particular
case he desired to remain in the background as much as possible, to avoid exasperating Massy
needlessly. No fuss! Let it all happen naturally.

Mr. Van Wyk all through the dinner was conscious of a sense of isolation that invades sometimes
the closeness of human intercourse. Captain Whalley failed lamentably and obviously in his
attempts to eat something. He seemed overcome by a strange absentmindedness. His hand would
hover irresolutely, as if left without guidance by a preoccupied mind. Mr. Van Wyk had heard
him coming up from a long way off in the profound stillness of the river-side, and had noticed
the irresolute character of the footfalls. The toe of his boot had struck the bottom stair
as though he had come along mooning with his head in the air right up to the steps of the veranda.
Had the captain of the Sofala been another sort of man he would have suspected the work of
age there. But one glance at him was enough. Time--after, indeed, marking him for its own--had
given him up to his usefulness, in which his simple faith would see a proof of Divine mercy.
"How could I contrive to warn him?" Mr. Van Wyk wondered, as if Captain Whalley had been miles
and miles away, out of sight and earshot of all evil. He was sickened by an immense disgust
of Sterne. To even mention his threat to a man like Whalley would be positively indecent. There
was something more vile and insulting in its hint than in a definite charge of crime--the debasing
taint of blackmailing. "What could anyone bring against him?" he asked himself. This was a
limpid personality. "And for what object?" The Power that man trusted had thought fit to leave
him nothing on earth that envy could lay hold of, except a bare crust of bread.

"Won't you try some of this?" he asked, pushing a dish slightly. Suddenly it seemed to Mr.
Van Wyk that Sterne might possibly be coveting the command of the Sofala. His cynicism was
quite startled by what looked like a proof that no man may count himself safe from his kind
unless in the very abyss of misery. An intrigue of that sort was hardly worth troubling about,
he judged; but still, with such a fool as Massy to deal with, Whalley ought to and must be warned.

At this moment Captain Whalley, bolt upright, the deep cavities of the eyes overhung by a bushy
frown, and one large brown hand resting on each side of his empty plate, spoke across the tablecloth
abruptly--"Mr. Van Wyk, you've always treated me with the most humane consideration."

"My dear captain, you make too much of a simple fact that I am not a savage." Mr. Van Wyk,
utterly revolted by the thought of Sterne's obscure attempt, raised his voice incisively, as
if the mate had been hiding somewhere within earshot. "Any consideration I have been able to
show was no more than the rightful due of a character I've learned to regard by this time with
an esteem that nothing can shake."

A slight ring of glass made him lift his eyes from the slice of pine-apple he was cutting into
small pieces on his plate. In changing his position Captain Whalley had contrived to upset
an empty tumbler.

Without looking that way, leaning sideways on his elbow, his other hand shading his brow, he
groped shakily for it, then desisted. Van Wyk stared blankly, as if something momentous had
happened all at once. He did not know why he should feel so startled; but he forgot Sterne
utterly for the moment.

"Why, what's the matter?"

And Captain Whalley, half-averted, in a deadened, agitated voice, muttered--

"Esteem!"

"And I may add something more," Mr. Van Wyk, very steady-eyed, pronounced slowly.

"Hold! Enough!" Captain Whalley did not change his attitude or raise his voice. "Say no more!
I can make you no return. I am too poor even for that now. Your esteem is worth having. You
are not a man that would stoop to deceive the poorest sort of devil on earth, or make a ship
unseaworthy every time he takes her to sea."

Mr. Van Wyk, leaning forward, his face gone pink all over, with the starched table-napkin over
his knees, was inclined to mistrust his senses, his power of comprehension, the sanity of his
guest.

"Where? Why? In the name of God!--what's this? What ship? I don't understand who . . ."

"Then, in the name of God, it is I! A ship's unseaworthy when her captain can't see. I am going
blind."

Mr. Van Wyk made a slight movement, and sat very still afterwards for a few seconds; then,
with the thought of Sterne's "The game's up," he ducked under the table to pick up the napkin
which had slipped off his knees. This was the game that was up. And at the same time the muffled
voice of Captain Whalley passed over him--

"I've deceived them all. Nobody knows."

He emerged flushed to the eyes. Captain Whalley, motionless under the full blaze of the lamp,
shaded his face with his hand.

"And you had that courage?"

"Call it by what name you like. But you are a humane man--a--a--gentleman, Mr. Van Wyk. You
may have asked me what I had done with my conscience."

He seemed to muse, profoundly silent, very still in his mournful pose.

"I began to tamper with it in my pride. You begin to see a lot of things when you are going
blind. I could not be frank with an old chum even. I was not frank with Massy--no, not altogether.
I knew he took me for a wealthy sailor fool, and I let him. I wanted to keep up my importance--because
there was poor Ivy away there--my daughter. What did I want to trade on his misery for? I did
trade on it--for her. And now, what mercy could I expect from him? He would trade on mine if
he knew it. He would hunt the old fraud out, and stick to the money for a year. Ivy's money.
And I haven't kept a penny for myself. How am I going to live for a year. A year! In a year
there will be no sun in the sky for her father."

His deep voice came out, awfully veiled, as though he had been overwhelmed by the earth of
a landslide, and talking to you of the thoughts that haunt the dead in their graves. A cold
shudder ran down Mr. Van Wyk's back.

"And how long is it since you have . . .?" he began.

"It was a long time before I could bring myself to believe in this--this visitation." Captain
Whalley spoke with gloomy patience from under his hand.

He had not thought he had deserved it. He had begun by deceiving himself from day to day, from
week to week. He had the Serang at hand there--an old servant. It came on gradually, and when
he could no longer deceive himself . . .

His voice died out almost.

"Rather than give her up I set myself to deceive you all."

"It's incredible," whispered Mr. Van Wyk. Captain Whalley's appalling murmur flowed on.

"Not even the sign of God's anger could make me forget her. How could I forsake my child, feeling
my vigor all the time--the blood warm within me? Warm as yours. It seems to me that, like the
blinded Samson, I would find the strength to shake down a temple upon my head. She's a struggling
woman--my own child that we used to pray over together, my poor wife and I. Do you remember
that day I as well as told you that I believed God would let me live to a hundred for her sake?
What sin is there in loving your child? Do you see it? I was ready for her sake to live for
ever. I half believed I would. I've been praying for death since. Ha! Presumptuous man--you
wanted to live . . ."

A tremendous, shuddering upheaval of that big frame, shaken by a gasping sob, set the glasses
jingling all over the table, seemed to make the whole house tremble to the roof-tree. And Mr.
Van Wyk, whose feeling of outraged love had been translated into a form of struggle with nature,
understood very well that, for that man whose whole life had been conditioned by action, there
could exist no other expression for all the emotions; that, to voluntarily cease venturing,
doing, enduring, for his child's sake, would have been exactly like plucking his warm love
for her out of his living heart. Something too monstrous, too impossible, even to conceive.

Captain Whalley had not changed his attitude, that seemed to express something of shame, sorrow,
and defiance.

"I have even deceived you. If it had not been for that word 'esteem.' These are not the words
for me. I would have lied to you. Haven't I lied to you? Weren't you going to trust your property
on board this very trip?"

"I have a floating yearly policy," Mr. Van Wyk said almost unwittingly, and was amazed at the
sudden cropping up of a commercial detail.

"The ship is unseaworthy, I tell you. The policy would be invalid if it were known . . ."

"We shall share the guilt, then."

"Nothing could make mine less," said Captain Whalley.

He had not dared to consult a doctor; the man would have perhaps asked who he was, what he
was doing; Massy might have heard something. He had lived on without any help, human or divine.
The very prayers stuck in his throat. What was there to pray for? and death seemed as far as
ever. Once he got into his cabin he dared not come out again; when he sat down he dared not
get up; he dared not raise his eyes to anybody's face; he felt reluctant to look upon the sea
or up to the sky. The world was fading before his great fear of giving himself away. The old
ship was his last friend; he was not afraid of her; he knew every inch of her deck; but at
her too he hardly dared to look, for fear of finding he could see less than the day before.
A great incertitude enveloped him. The horizon was gone; the sky mingled darkly with the sea.
Who was this figure standing over yonder? what was this thing lying down there? And a frightful
doubt of the reality of what he could see made even the remnant of sight that remained to him
an added torment, a pitfall always open for his miserable pretense. He was afraid to stumble
inexcusably over something--to say a fatal Yes or No to a question. The hand of God was upon
him, but it could not tear him away from his child. And, as if in a nightmare of humiliation,
every featureless man seemed an enemy.

He let his hand fall heavily on the table. Mr. Van Wyk, arms down, chin on breast, with a gleam
of white teeth pressing on the lower lip, meditated on Sterne's "The game's up."

"The Serang of course does not know."

"Nobody," said Captain Whalley, with assurance.

"Ah yes. Nobody. Very well. Can you keep it up to the end of the trip? That is the last under
the agreement with Massy."

Captain Whalley got up and stood erect, very stately, with the great white beard lying like
a silver breastplate over the awful secret of his heart. Yes; that was the only hope there
was for him of ever seeing her again, of securing the money, the last he could do for her,
before he crept away somewhere--useless, a burden, a reproach to himself. His voice faltered.

"Think of it! Never see her any more: the only human being besides myself now on earth that
can remember my wife. She's just like her mother. Lucky the poor woman is where there are no
tears shed over those they loved on earth and that remain to pray not to be led into temptation--because,
I suppose, the blessed know the secret of grace in God's dealings with His created children."

He swayed a little, said with austere dignity--

"I don't. I know only the child He has given me."

And he began to walk. Mr. Van Wyk, jumping up, saw the full meaning of the rigid head, the
hesitating feet, the vaguely extended hand. His heart was beating fast; he moved a chair aside,
and instinctively advanced as if to offer his arm. But Captain Whalley passed him by, making
for the stairs quite straight.

"He could not see me at all out of his line," Van Wyk thought, with a sort of awe. Then going
to the head of the stairs, he asked a little tremulously--

"What is it like--like a mist--like . . ."

Captain Whalley, half-way down, stopped, and turned round undismayed to answer.

"It is as if the light were ebbing out of the world. Have you ever watched the ebbing sea on
an open stretch of sands withdrawing farther and farther away from you? It is like this--only
there will be no flood to follow. Never. It is as if the sun were growing smaller, the stars
going out one by one. There can't be many left that I can see by this. But I haven't had the
courage to look of late . . ." He must have been able to make out Mr. Van Wyk, because he checked
him by an authoritative gesture and a stoical--

"I can get about alone yet."

It was as if he had taken his line, and would accept no help from men, after having been cast
out, like a presumptuous Titan, from his heaven. Mr. Van Wyk, arrested, seemed to count the
footsteps right out of earshot. He walked between the tables, tapping smartly with his heels,
took up a paper-knife, dropped it after a vague glance along the blade; then happening upon
the piano, struck a few chords again and again, vigorously, standing up before the keyboard
with an attentive poise of the head like a piano-tuner; closing it, he pivoted on his heels
brusquely, avoided the little terrier sleeping trustfully on crossed forepaws, came upon the
stairs next, and, as though he had lost his balance on the top step, ran down headlong out
of the house. His servants, beginning to clear the table, heard him mutter to himself (evil
words no doubt) down there, and then after a pause go away with a strolling gait in the direction
of the wharf.

The bulwarks of the Sofala lying alongside the bank made a low, black wall on the undulating
contour of the shore. Two masts and a funnel uprose from behind it with a great rake, as if
about to fall: a solid, square elevation in the middle bore the ghostly shapes of white boats,
the curves of davits, lines of rail and stanchions, all confused and mingling darkly everywhere;
but low down, amidships, a single lighted port stared out on the night, perfectly round, like
a small, full moon, whose yellow beam caught a patch of wet mud, the edge of trodden grass,
two turns of heavy cable wound round the foot of a thick wooden post in the ground.

Mr. Van Wyk, peering alongside, heard a muzzy boastful voice apparently jeering at a person
called Prendergast. It mouthed abuse thickly, choked; then pronounced very distinctly the word
"Murphy," and chuckled. Glass tinkled tremulously. All these sounds came from the lighted port.
Mr. Van Wyk hesitated, stooped; it was impossible to look through unless he went down into the mud.

"Sterne," he said, half aloud.

The drunken voice within said gladly--

"Sterne--of course. Look at him blink. Look at him! Sterne, Whalley, Massy. Massy, Whalley,
Sterne. But Massy's the best. You can't come over him. He would just love to see you starve."

Mr. Van Wyk moved away, made out farther forward a shadowy head stuck out from under the awnings
as if on the watch, and spoke quietly in Malay, "Is the mate asleep?"

"No. Here, at your service."

In a moment Sterne appeared, walking as noiselessly as a cat on the wharf.

"It's so jolly dark, and I had no idea you would be down to-night."

"What's this horrible raving?" asked Mr. Van Wyk, as if to explain the cause of a shudder than
ran over him audibly.

"Jack's broken out on a drunk. That's our second. It's his way. He will be right enough by
to-morrow afternoon, only Mr. Massy will keep on worrying up and down the deck. We had better
get away."

He muttered suggestively of a talk "up at the house." He had long desired to effect an entrance
there, but Mr. Van Wyk nonchalantly demurred: it would not, he feared, be quite prudent, perhaps;
and the opaque black shadow under one of the two big trees left at the landing-place swallowed
them up, impenetrably dense, by the side of the wide river, that seemed to spin into threads
of glitter the light of a few big stars dropped here and there upon its outspread and flowing
stillness.

"The situation is grave beyond doubt," Mr. Van Wyk said. Ghost-like in their white clothes
they could not distinguish each others' features, and their feet made no sound on the soft
earth. A sort of purring was heard. Mr. Sterne felt gratified by such a beginning.

"I thought, Mr. Van Wyk, a gentleman of your sort would see at once how awkwardly I was situated."

"Yes, very. Obviously his health is bad. Perhaps he's breaking up. I see, and he himself is
well aware--I assume I am speaking to a man of sense--he is well aware that his legs are giving
out."

"His legs--ah!" Mr. Sterne was disconcerted, and then turned sulky. "You may call it his legs
if you like; what I want to know is whether he intends to clear out quietly. That's a good
one, too! His legs! Pooh!"

"Why, yes. Only look at the way he walks." Mr. Van Wyk took him up in a perfectly cool and
undoubting tone. "The question, however, is whether your sense of duty does not carry you too
far from your true interest. After all, I too could do something to serve you. You know who I am."

"Everybody along the Straits has heard of you, sir."

Mr. Van Wyk presumed that this meant something favorable. Sterne had a soft laugh at this pleasantry.
He should think so! To the opening statement, that the partnership agreement was to expire
at the end of this very trip, he gave an attentive assent. He was aware. One heard of nothing
else on board all the blessed day long. As to Massy, it was no secret that he was in a jolly
deep hole with these worn-out boilers. He would have to borrow somewhere a couple of hundred
first of all to pay off the captain; and then he would have to raise money on mortgage upon
the ship for the new boilers--that is, if he could find a lender at all. At best it meant loss
of time, a break in the trade, short earnings for the year--and there was always the danger
of having his connection filched away from him by the Germans. It was whispered about that
he had already tried two firms. Neither would have anything to do with him. Ship too old, and
the man too well known in the place. . . . Mr. Sterne's final rapid winking remained buried
in the deep darkness sibilating with his whispers.

"Supposing, then, he got the loan," Mr. Van Wyk resumed in a deliberate undertone, "on your
own showing he's more than likely to get a mortgagee's man thrust upon him as captain. For
my part, I know that I would make that very stipulation myself if I had to find the money.
And as a matter of fact I am thinking of doing so. It would be worth my while in many ways.
Do you see how this would bear on the case under discussion?"

"Thank you, sir. I am sure you couldn't get anybody that would care more for your interests."

"Well, it suits my interest that Captain Whalley should finish his time. I shall probably take
a passage with you down the Straits. If that can be done, I'll be on the spot when all these
changes take place, and in a position to look after your interests."

"Mr. Van Wyk, I want nothing better. I am sure I am infinitely . . ."

"I take it, then, that this may be done without any trouble."

"Well, sir, what risk there is can't be helped; but (speaking to you as my employer now) the
thing is more safe than it looks. If anybody had told me of it I wouldn't have believed it,
but I have been looking on myself. That old Serang has been trained up to the game. There's
nothing the matter with his--his--limbs, sir. He's got used to doing things himself in a remarkable
way. And let me tell you, sir, that Captain Whalley, poor man, is by no means useless. Fact.
Let me explain to you, sir. He stiffens up that old monkey of a Malay, who knows well enough
what to do. Why, he must have kept captain's watches in all sorts of country ships off and
on for the last five-and-twenty years. These natives, sir, as long as they have a white man
close at the back, will go on doing the right thing most surprisingly well--even if left quite
to themselves. Only the white man must be of the sort to put starch into them, and the captain
is just the one for that. Why, sir, he has drilled him so well that now he needs hardly speak
at all. I have seen that little wrinkled ape made to take the ship out of Pangu Bay on a blowy
morning and on all through the islands; take her out first-rate, sir, dodging under the old
man's elbow, and in such quiet style that you could not have told for the life of you which
of the two was doing the work up there. That's where our poor friend would be still of use
to the ship even if--if--he could no longer lift a foot, sir. Provided the Serang does not
know that there's anything wrong."

"He doesn't."

"Naturally not. Quite beyond his apprehension. They aren't capable of finding out anything
about us, sir."

"You seem to be a shrewd man," said Mr. Van Wyk in a choked mutter, as though he were feeling sick.

"You'll find me a good enough servant, sir."

Mr. Sterne hoped now for a handshake at least, but unexpectedly, with a "What's this? Better
not to be seen together," Mr. Van Wyk's white shape wavered, and instantly seemed to melt away
in the black air under the roof of boughs. The mate was startled. Yes. There was that faint
thumping clatter.

He stole out silently from under the shade. The lighted port-hole shone from afar. His head
swam with the intoxication of sudden success. What a thing it was to have a gentleman to deal
with! He crept aboard, and there was something weird in the shadowy stretch of empty decks,
echoing with shouts and blows proceeding from a darker part amidships. Mr. Massy was raging
before the door of the berth: the drunken voice within flowed on undisturbed in the violent
racket of kicks.

"Shut up! Put your light out and turn in, you confounded swilling pig--you! D'you hear me,
you beast?"

The kicking stopped, and in the pause the muzzy oracular voice announced from within--

"Ah! Massy, now--that's another thing. Massy's deep."

"Who's that aft there? You, Sterne? He'll drink himself into a fit of horrors." The chief engineer
appeared vague and big at the corner of the engineroom.

"He will be good enough for duty to-morrow. I would let him be, Mr. Massy."

Sterne slipped away into his berth, and at once had to sit down. His head swam with exultation.
He got into his bunk as if in a dream. A feeling of profound peace, of pacific joy, came over
him. On deck all was quiet.

Mr. Massy, with his ear against the door of Jack's cabin, listened critically to a deep stertorous
breathing within. This was a dead-drunk sleep. The bout was over: tranquilized on that score,
he too went in, and with slow wriggles got out of his old tweed jacket. It was a garment with
many pockets, which he used to put on at odd times of the day, being subject to sudden chilly
fits, and when he felt warmed he would take it off and hang it about anywhere all over the
ship. It would be seen swinging on belaying-pins, thrown over the heads of winches, suspended
on people's very door-handles for that matter. Was he not the owner? But his favorite place
was a hook on a wooden awning stanchion on the bridge, almost against the binnacle. He had
even in the early days more than one tussle on that point with Captain Whalley, who desired
the bridge to be kept tidy. He had been overawed then. Of late, though, he had been able to
defy his partner with impunity. Captain Whalley never seemed to notice anything now. As to
the Malays, in their awe of that scowling man not one of the crew would dream of laying a hand
on the thing, no matter where or what it swung from.

With an unexpectedness which made Mr. Massy jump and drop the coat at his feet, there came
from the next berth the crash and thud of a headlong, jingling, clattering fall. The faithful
Jack must have dropped to sleep suddenly as he sat at his revels, and now had gone over chair
and all, breaking, as it seemed by the sound, every single glass and bottle in the place. After
the terrific smash all was still for a time in there, as though he had killed himself outright
on the spot. Mr. Massy held his breath. At last a sleepy uneasy groaning sigh was exhaled slowly
on the other side of the bulkhead.

"I hope to goodness he's too drunk to wake up now," muttered Mr. Massy.

The sound of a softly knowing laugh nearly drove him to despair. He swore violently under his
breath. The fool would keep him awake all night now for certain. He cursed his luck. He wanted
to forget his maddening troubles in sleep sometimes. He could detect no movements. Without
apparently making the slightest attempt to get up, Jack went on sniggering to himself where
he lay; then began to speak, where he had left off as it were--

"Massy! I love the dirty rascal. He would like to see his poor old Jack starve--but just you
look where he has climbed to." . . . He hiccoughed in a superior, leisurely manner. . . . "Ship-owning
it with the best. A lottery ticket you want. Ha! ha! I will give you lottery tickets, my boy.
Let the old ship sink and the old chum starve--that's right. He don't go wrong--Massy don't.
Not he. He's a genius--that man is. That's the way to win your money. Ship and chum must go."

"The silly fool has taken it to heart," muttered Massy to himself. And, listening with a softened
expression of face for any slight sign of returning drowsiness, he was discouraged profoundly
by a burst of laughter full of joyful irony.

"Would like to see her at the bottom of the sea! Oh, you clever, clever devil! Wish her sunk,
eh? I should think you would, my boy; the damned old thing and all your troubles with her.
Rake in the insurance money --turn your back on your old chum--all's well--gentleman again."

A grim stillness had come over Massy's face. Only his big black eyes rolled uneasily. The raving
fool. And yet it was all true. Yes. Lottery tickets, too. All true. What? Beginning again?
He wished he wouldn't. . . .

But it was even so. The imaginative drunkard on the other side of the bulkhead shook off the
deathlike stillness that after his last words had fallen on the dark ship moored to a silent shore.

"Don't you dare to say anything against George Massy, Esquire. When he's tired of waiting he
will do away with her. Look out! Down she goes--chum and all. He'll know how to . . ."

The voice hesitated, weary, dreamy, lost, as if dying away in a vast open space.

". . . Find a trick that will work. He's up to it--never fear . . ."

He must have been very drunk, for at last the heavy sleep gripped him with the suddenness of
a magic spell, and the last word lengthened itself into an interminable, noisy, in-drawn snore.
And then even the snoring stopped, and all was still.

But it seemed as though Mr. Massy had suddenly come to doubt the efficacy of sleep as against
a man's troubles; or perhaps he had found the relief he needed in the stillness of a calm contemplation
that may contain the vivid thoughts of wealth, of a stroke of luck, of long idleness, and may
bring before you the imagined form of every desire; for, turning about and throwing his arms
over the edge of his bunk, he stood there with his feet on his favorite old coat, looking out
through the round port into the night over the river. Sometimes a breath of wind would enter
and touch his face, a cool breath charged with the damp, fresh feel from a vast body of water.
A glimmer here and there was all he could see of it; and once he might after all suppose he
had dozed off, since there appeared before his vision, unexpectedly and connected with no dream,
a row of flaming and gigantic figures--three naught seven one two--making up a number such
as you may see on a lottery ticket. His shrivell'd hand was wet with tears she pour'd, alas! in
vain, And it trembled like an autumn leaf beneath the beating rain.

I've seen her since that fatal morn--her golden fetters rest As e'en the weight of incubus,
upon her aching breast.

And when the victor, Death, shall come to deal the welcome blow, He will not find one rose to
swell the wreath that decks his brow: For oh! her cheek is blanch'd by grief which time may not
assuage,-- Thus early Beauty sheds her bloom on the wintry breast
of Age.

Our commendation of the "Keepsake" might be extended much further, were we to consult our inclination
to do justice to its high character. With so lavish an expenditure and such an array of talent
as we have shown it to contain, to wonder at its success,

Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.

We congratulate the proprietors on their prospects of remuneration, for the attractions of their
publication are irresistible. It is altogether a splendid enterprise, and we doubt not the reward
will be more than proportionate to the expectation it has raised--both
in the proprietors and their patrons--the public.

THE ANNIVERSARY,

EDITED BY ALLAN CUNNINGHAM.

Perhaps we are getting too panegyrical, for panegyric savours of the poppy; but we must not flinch
from our duty.

Allan Cunningham--there is poetry in the name, written or sung--and high-wrought poetry too, in
nearly every production to which that name is attached--and among these "The Anniversary for 1829." All
the departments of this work too, (as in the "Keepsake") are unique. Mr. Sharpe, the proprietor,
is a man of refined taste, his Editor and his contributors are men of first-rate genius, the
Painters and Engravers are of the first rank, and the volume is printed at Mr. Whittingham's
Chiswick-press.

Excellence must always be the result of such a combination of talent, and so it proves in the
Anniversary. As might have been expected from the talent of its editor, the volume is superior
in its poetical attractions--both in number and quality.

By way of variety, we begin with the poetry. First is a stirring little ballad, the Warrior, by
the editor; then, a humorous epistle from Robert Southey, Esq. to Allan Cunningham, in which
the laureat deals forth his ire on the "misresemblances and villanous
visages" which have been published as his portrait.[1] Next is a gem
of another water, Edderline's Dream, by Professor Wilson, the supposed
editor of "Blackwood's Magazine." This is throughout a very beautiful
composition, but we must content ourselves with the following extract:--

EDDERLINE'S
SLEEP.

Castle-Oban is lost in the darkness of night, For the moon
is swept from the starless heaven, And the latest line of lowering
light That lingered on the stormy even, A dim-seen line, half cloud,
half wave, Hath sunk into the weltering grave. Castle-Oban is dark
without and within, And downwards to the fearful din, Where Ocean
with his thunder shocks Stuns the green foundation rocks, Through
the green abyss that mocks his eye, Oft hath the eerie watchman sent
A shuddering look, a shivering sigh, From the edge of the howling
battlement! From six to eight, in the course of duty, the Serang looked alone after the ship.
She had a clear road before her now till about three in the morning, when she would close with
the Pangu group. At eight Mr. Sterne came out cheerily to take charge again till midnight.
At ten he was still chirruping and humming to himself on the bridge, and about that time Mr.
Van Wyk's thought abandoned the Sofala. Mr. Van Wyk had fallen asleep at last.

Massy, blocking the engine-room companion, jerked himself into his tweed jacket surlily, while
the second waited with a scowl.

"Oh. You came out? You sot! Well, what have you got to say for yourself?"

He had been in charge of the engines till then. A somber fury darkened his mind: a hot anger
against the ship, against the facts of life, against the men for their cheating, against himself
too--because of an inward tremor of his heart.

An incomprehensible growl answered him.

"What? Can't you open your mouth now? You yelp out your infernal rot loud enough when you are
drunk. What do you mean by abusing people in that way?--you old useless boozer, you!"

"Can't help it. Don't remember anything about it. You shouldn't listen."

"You dare to tell me! What do you mean by going on a drunk like this!"

"Don't ask me. Sick of the dam' boilers--you would be. Sick of life."

"I wish you were dead, then. You've made me sick of you. Don't you remember the uproar you
made last night? You miserable old soaker!"

"No; I don't. Don't want to. Drink is drink."

"I wonder what prevents me from kicking you out. What do you want here?"

"Relieve you. You've been long enough down there, George."

"Don't you George me--you tippling old rascal, you! If I were to die to-morrow you would starve.
Remember that. Say Mr. Massy."

"Mr. Massy," repeated the other stolidly.

Disheveled, with dull blood-shot eyes, a snuffy, grimy shirt, greasy trowsers, naked feet thrust
into ragged slippers, he bolted in head down directly Massy had made way for him.

The chief engineer looked around. The deck was empty as far as the taffrail. All the native
passengers had left in Batu Beru this time, and no others had joined. The dial of the patent
log tinkled periodically in the dark at the end of the ship. It was a dead calm, and, under
the clouded sky, through the still air that seemed to cling warm, with a seaweed smell, to
her slim hull, on a sea of somber gray and unwrinkled, the ship moved on an even keel, as if
floating detached in empty space. But Mr. Massy slapped his forehead, tottered a little, caught
hold of a belaying-pin at the foot of the mast.

"I shall go mad," he muttered, walking across the deck unsteadily. A shovel was scraping loose
coal down below--a fire-door clanged. Sterne on the bridge began whistling a new tune.

Captain Whalley, sitting on the couch, awake and fully dressed, heard the door of his cabin
open. He did not move in the least, waiting to recognize the voice, with an appalling strain
of prudence.

A bulkhead lamp blazed on the white paint, the crimson plush, the brown varnish of mahogany
tops. The white wood packing-case under the bed-place had remained unopened for three years
now, as though Captain Whalley had felt that, after the Fair Maid was gone, there could be
no abiding-place on earth for his affections. His hands rested on his knees; his handsome head
with big eyebrows presented a rigid profile to the doorway. The expected voice spoke out at last.

"Once more, then. What am I to call you?"

Ha! Massy. Again. The weariness of it crushed his heart--and the pain of shame was almost more
than he could bear without crying out.

"Well. Is it to be 'partner' still?"

"You don't know what you ask."

"I know what I want . . ."

Massy stepped in and closed the door.

". . . And I am going to have a try for it with you once more."

His whine was half persuasive, half menacing.

"For it's no manner of use to tell me that you are poor. You don't spend anything on yourself,
that's true enough; but there's another name for that. You think you are going to have what
you want out of me for three years, and then cast me off without hearing what I think of you.
You think I would have submitted to your airs if I had known you had only a beggarly five hundred
pounds in the world. You ought to have told me."

"Perhaps," said Captain Whalley, bowing his head. "And yet it has saved you." . . . Massy laughed
scornfully. . . . "I have told you often enough since."

"And I don't believe you now. When I think how I let you lord it over my ship! Do you remember
how you used to bullyrag me about my coat and your bridge? It was in his way. His bridge! 'And
I won't be a party to this--and I couldn't think of doing that.' Honest man! And now it all
comes out. 'I am poor, and I can't. I have only this five hundred in the world.'"

He contemplated the immobility of Captain Whalley, that seemed to present an inconquerable
obstacle in his path. His face took a mournful cast.

"You are a hard man."

"Enough," said Captain Whalley, turning upon him. "You shall get nothing from me, because I
have nothing of mine to give away now."

"Tell that to the marines!"

Mr. Massy, going out, looked back once; then the door closed, and Captain Whalley, alone, sat
as still as before. He had nothing of his own--even his past of honor, of truth, of just pride,
was gone. All his spotless life had fallen into the abyss. He had said his last good-by to
it. But what belonged to her, that he meant to save. Only a little money. He would take it
to her in his own hands--this last gift of a man that had lasted too long. And an immense and
fierce impulse, the very passion of paternity, flamed up with all the unquenched vigor of his
worthless life in a desire to see her face.

Just across the deck Massy had gone straight to his cabin, struck a light, and hunted up the
note of the dreamed number whose figures had flamed up also with the fierceness of another
passion. He must contrive somehow not to miss a drawing. That number meant something. But what
expedient could he contrive to keep himself going?

"Wretched miser!" he mumbled.

If Mr. Sterne could at no time have told him anything new about his partner, he could have
told Mr. Sterne that another use could be made of a man's affliction than just to kick him
out, and thus defer the term of a difficult payment for a year. To keep the secret of the affliction
and induce him to stay was a better move. If without means, he would be anxious to remain;
and that settled the question of refunding him his share. He did not know exactly how much
Captain Whalley was disabled; but if it so happened that he put the ship ashore somewhere for
good and all, it was not the owner's fault--was it? He was not obliged to know that there was
anything wrong. But probably nobody would raise such a point, and the ship was fully insured.
He had had enough self-restraint to pay up the premiums. But this was not all. He could not
believe Captain Whalley to be so confoundedly destitute as not to have some more money put
away somewhere. If he, Massy, could get hold of it, that would pay for the boilers, and everything
went on as before. And if she got lost in the end, so much the better. He hated her: he loathed
the troubles that took his mind off the chances of fortune. He wished her at the bottom of
the sea, and the insurance money in his pocket. And as, baffled, he left Captain Whalley's
cabin, he enveloped in the same hatred the ship with the worn-out boilers and the man with
the dimmed eyes.

And our conduct after all is so much a matter of outside suggestion, that had it not been for
his Jack's drunken gabble he would have there and then had it out with this miserable man,
who would neither help, nor stay, nor yet lose the ship. The old fraud! He longed to kick him
out. But he restrained himself. Time enough for that--when he liked. There was a fearful new
thought put into his head. Wasn't he up to it after all? How that beast Jack had raved! "Find
a safe trick to get rid of her." Well, Jack was not so far wrong. A very clever trick had occurred
to him. Aye! But what of the risk?

A feeling of pride--the pride of superiority to common prejudices--crept into his breast, made
his heart beat fast, his mouth turn dry. Not everybody would dare; but he was Massy, and he
was up to it!

Six bells were struck on deck. Eleven! He drank a glass of water, and sat down for ten minutes
or so to calm himself. Then he got out of his chest a small bull's-eye lantern of his own and
lit it.

Almost opposite his berth, across the narrow passage under the bridge, there was, in the iron
deck-structure covering the stokehold fiddle and the boiler-space, a storeroom with iron sides,
iron roof, iron-plated floor, too, on account of the heat below. All sorts of rubbish was shot
there: it had a mound of scrap-iron in a corner; rows of empty oil-cans; sacks of cotton-waste,
with a heap of charcoal, a deck-forge, fragments of an old hencoop, winch-covers all in rags,
remnants of lamps, and a brown felt hat, discarded by a man dead now (of a fever on the Brazil
coast), who had been once mate of the Sofala, had remained for years jammed forcibly behind
a length of burst copper pipe, flung at some time or other out of the engine-room. A complete
and imperious blackness pervaded that Capharnaum of forgotten things. A small shaft of light
from Mr. Massy's bull's-eye fell slanting right through it.

His coat was unbuttoned; he shot the bolt of the door (there was no other opening), and, squatting
before the scrap-heap, began to pack his pockets with pieces of iron. He packed them carefully,
as if the rusty nuts, the broken bolts, the links of cargo chain, had been so much gold he
had that one chance to carry away. He packed his side-pockets till they bulged, the breast
pocket, the pockets inside. He turned over the pieces. Some he rejected. A small mist of powdered
rust began to rise about his busy hands. Mr. Massy knew something of the scientific basis of
his clever trick. If you want to deflect the magnetic needle of a ship's compass, soft iron
is the best; likewise many small pieces in the pockets of a jacket would have more effect than
a few large ones, because in that way you obtain a greater amount of surface for weight in
your iron, and it's surface that tells.

He slipped out swiftly--two strides sufficed--and in his cabin he perceived that his hands
were all red--red with rust. It disconcerted him, as though he had found them covered with
blood: he looked himself over hastily. Why, his trowsers too! He had been rubbing his rusty
palms on his legs.

He tore off the waistband button in his haste, brushed his coat, washed his hands. Then the
air of guilt left him, and he sat down to wait. 

This coquetry, or whatever it may be called, of so wretched a being, was truly ludicrous. Dr.
Johnson and I afterwards were merry upon it. I said it was he who alarmed the poor woman's
virtue. 'No, Sir, (said he,) she'll say "there came a wicked young fellow, a wild dog, who
I believe would have ravished me, had there not been with him a grave old gentleman, who repressed
him: but when he gets out of the sight of his tutor, I'll warrant
you he'll spare no woman he meets, young or old."' 'No, Sir, (I replied,)
she'll say, "There was a terrible ruffian who would have forced me,
had it not been for a civil decent young man who, I take it, was an
angel sent from heaven to protect me."'

Dr. Johnson would not hurt
her delicacy, by insisting on 'seeing her bed-chamber,' like Archer
in the Beaux Stratagem[419].

But my curiosity was more ardent; I lighted a piece of paper, and went into the place where the
bed was. There was a little partition of wicker, rather more neatly done than that for the fold,
and close by the wall was a kind of bedstead of wood with heath upon
it by way of bed! at the foot of which I saw some sort of blankets
or covering rolled up in a heap.

The woman's name was Fraser; so was her husband's. He was a man of eighty. Mr. Fraser of Balnain
allows him to live in this hut, and keep sixty goats, for taking
care of his woods, where he then was.

They had five children, the eldest only thirteen. Two were gone to Inverness to buy meal[420];
the rest were looking after the goats.

 "It's funny," he said to himself, "but
you can never tell whether that man has seen you or not. He might have heard me breathe this time."

He was a wonderful man when all was said and done. They said he had had a name in his day.
Mr. Sterne could well believe it; and he concluded serenely that Captain Whalley must be able
to see people more or less --as himself just now, for instance--but not being certain of anybody,
had to keep up that unnoticing silence of manner for fear of giving himself away. Mr. Sterne
was a shrewd guesser.

This necessity of every moment brought home to Captain Whalley's heart the humiliation of his
falsehood. He had drifted into it from paternal love, from incredulity, from boundless trust
in divine justice meted out to men's feelings on this earth. He would give his poor Ivy the
benefit of another month's work; perhaps the affliction was only temporary. Surely God would
not rob his child of his power to help, and cast him naked into a night without end. He had
caught at every hope; and when the evidence of his misfortune was stronger than hope, he tried
not to believe the manifest thing.

In vain. In the steadily darkening universe a sinister clearness fell upon his ideas. In the
illuminating moments of suffering he saw life, men, all things, the whole earth with all her
burden of created nature, as he had never seen them before.

Sometimes he was seized with a sudden vertigo and an overwhelming terror; and then the image
of his daughter appeared. Her, too, he had never seen so clearly before. Was it possible that
he should ever be unable to do anything whatever for her? Nothing. And not see her any more? Never.

Why? The punishment was too great for a little presumption, for a little pride. And at last
he came to cling to his deception with a fierce determination to carry it out to the end, to
save her money intact, and behold her once more with his own eyes. Afterwards--what? The idea
of suicide was revolting to the vigor of his manhood. He had prayed for death till the prayers
had stuck in his throat. All the days of his life he had prayed for daily bread, and not to
be led into temptation, in a childlike humility of spirit. Did words mean anything? Whence
did the gift of speech come? The violent beating of his heart reverberated in his head--seemed
to shake his brain to pieces.

He sat down heavily in the deck-chair to keep the pretense of his watch. The night was dark.
All the nights were dark now.

"Serang," he said, half aloud.

"Ada, Tuan. I am here."

"There are clouds on the sky?"

"There are, Tuan."

"Let her be steered straight. North."

"She is going north, Tuan."

The Serang stepped back. Captain Whalley recognized Massy's footfalls on the bridge.

The engineer walked over to port and returned, passing behind the chair several times. Captain
Whalley detected an unusual character as of prudent care in this prowling. The near presence
of that man brought with it always a recrudescence of moral suffering for Captain Whalley.
It was not remorse. After all, he had done nothing but good to the poor devil. There was also
a sense of danger--the necessity of a greater care.

Massy stopped and said--

"So you still say you must go?"

"I must indeed."

"And you couldn't at least leave the money for a term of years?"

"Impossible."

"Can't trust it with me without your care, eh?"

Captain Whalley remained silent. Massy sighed deeply over the back of the chair.

"It would just do to save me," he said in a tremulous voice.

"I've saved you once."

The chief engineer took off his coat with careful movements, and proceeded to feel for the
brass hook screwed into the wooden stanchion. For this purpose he placed himself right in front
of the binnacle, thus hiding completely the compass-card from the quartermaster at the wheel.
"Tuan!" the lascar at last murmured softly, meaning to let the white man know that he could
not see to steer.

Mr. Massy had accomplished his purpose. The coat was hanging from the nail, within six inches
of the binnacle. And directly he had stepped aside the quartermaster, a middle-aged, pock-marked,
Sumatra Malay, almost as dark as a negro, perceived with amazement that in that short time,
in this smooth water, with no wind at all, the ship had gone swinging far out of her course.
He had never known her get away like this before. With a slight grunt of astonishment he turned
the wheel hastily to bring her head back north, which was the course. The grinding of the steering-chains,
the chiding murmurs of the Serang, who had come over to the wheel, made a slight stir, which
attracted Captain Whalley's anxious attention. He said, "Take better care." Then everything
settled to the usual quiet on the bridge. Mr. Massy had disappeared.

But the iron in the pockets of the coat had done its work; and the Sofala, heading north by
the compass, made untrue by this simple device, was no longer making a safe course for Pangu Bay.

The hiss of water parted by her stem, the throb of her engines, all the sounds of her faithful
and laborious life, went on uninterrupted in the great calm of the sea joining on all sides
the motionless layer of cloud over the sky. A gentle stillness as vast as the world seemed
to wait upon her path, enveloping her lovingly in a supreme caress. Mr. Massy thought there
could be no better night for an arranged shipwreck.

Run up high and dry on one of the reefs east of Pangu--wait for daylight--hole in the bottom--out
boats--Pangu Bay same evening. That's about it. As soon as she touched he would hasten on the
bridge, get hold of the coat (nobody would notice in the dark), and shake it upside-down over
the side, or even fling it into the sea. A detail. Who could guess? Coat been seen hanging
there from that hook hundreds of times. Nevertheless, when he sat down on the lower step of
the bridge-ladder his knees knocked together a little. The waiting part was the worst of it.
At times he would begin to pant quickly, as though he had been running, and then breathe largely,
swelling with the intimate sense of a mastered fate. Now and then he would hear the shuffle
of the Serang's bare feet up there: quiet, low voices would exchange a few words, and lapse
almost at once into silence. . . .

"Tell me directly you see any land, Serang."

"Yes, Tuan. Not yet."

"No, not yet," Captain Whalley would agree.

The ship had been the best friend of his decline. He had sent all the money he had made by
and in the Sofala to his daughter. His thought lingered on the name. How often he and his wife
had talked over the cot of the child in the big stern-cabin of the Condor; she would grow up,
she would marry, she would love them, they would live near her and look at her happiness--it
would go on without end. Well, his wife was dead, to the child he had given all he had to give;
he wished he could come near her, see her, see her face once, live in the sound of her voice,
that could make the darkness of the living grave ready for him supportable. He had been starved
of love too long. He imagined her tenderness.

The Serang had been peering forward, and now and then glancing at the chair. 'No, Sir. If learning cannot
support a man, if he must sit with his hands across till somebody
feeds him, it is as to him a bad thing, and it is better as it is.

With patronage, what flattery! what falsehood!

While a man is in equilibrio, he throws truth among the multitude, and lets them take it as
they please: in patronage, he must say what pleases his patron, and
it is an equal chance whether that be truth or falsehood.' WATSON.

'But is not the case now, that, instead of flattering one person,
we flatter the age?' JOHNSON.

'No, Sir.

The world always lets a man tell what he thinks, his own way.

I wonder, however, that so many people have written, who might have let it alone. That people should
endeavour to excel in conversation, I do not wonder; because in conversation praise is instantly
reverberated[174].'

We talked of change of manners.

Dr. Johnson observed, that our drinking less than our ancestors was owing to the change from
ale to wine.' I remember, (said he,) when all the decent people in Lichfield got drunk every night,
and were not the worse thought of[175]. Ale was cheap, so you pressed strongly. When a man
must bring a bottle of wine, he is not in such haste. Smoking has
gone out.

To be sure, it is a shocking thing, blowing smoke out of our mouths
into other people's mouths, eyes, and noses, and having the same thing
done to us.

Yet I cannot account, why a thing which requires so little exertion,
and yet preserves the mind from total vacuity, should have gone out[176].

Every man has something by which he calms himself: beating with his feet, or so[177]. I remember
when people in England changed a shirt only once a week[178]: a Pandour, when he gets a shirt,
greases it to make it last. Formerly, good tradesmen had no fire but in the kitchen; never in the parlour,
except on Sunday. My father, who was a magistrate of Lichfield, lived thus. They never began
to have a fire in the parlour, but on leaving off business, or some great revolution of their
life.' Dr. Watson said, the hall was as a kitchen, in old squires'
houses.

JOHNSON. 'No, Sir.

The hall was for great occasions, and never was used for domestick refection[179].' We talked of
the Union, and what money it had brought into Scotland

.


"What's this?"

Captain Whalley fell on his knees, with groping hands extended in a frank gesture of blindness.
They trembled, these hands feeling for the truth. He saw it. Iron near the compass. Wrong course.
Wreck her! His ship. Oh no. Not that.

"Jump and stop her!" he roared out in a voice not his own.

He ran himself--hands forward, a blind man, and while the clanging of the gong echoed still
all over the ship, she seemed to butt full tilt into the side of a mountain.

It was low water along the north side of the strait. Mr. Massy had not reckoned on that. Instead
of running aground for half her length, the Sofala butted the sheer ridge of a stone reef which
would have been awash at high water. This made the shock absolutely terrific. Everybody in
the ship that was standing was thrown down headlong: the shaken rigging made a great rattling
to the very trucks. All the lights went out: several chain-guys, snapping, clattered against
the funnel: there were crashes, pings of parted wire-rope, splintering sounds, loud cracks,
the masthead lamp flew over the bows, and all the doors about the deck began to bang heavily.
Then, after having hit, she rebounded, hit the second time the very same spot like a battering-ram.
This completed the havoc: the funnel, with all the guys gone, fell over with a hollow sound
of thunder, smashing the wheel to bits, crushing the frame of the awnings, breaking the lockers,
filling the bridge with a mass of splinters, sticks, and broken wood. Captain Whalley picked
himself up and stood knee-deep in wreckage, torn, bleeding, knowing the nature of the danger
he had escaped mostly by the sound, and holding Mr. Massy's coat in his arms.

By this time Sterne (he had been flung out of his bunk) had set the engines astern. They worked
for a few turns, then a voice bawled out, "Get out of the damned engine-room, Jack!"--and they
stopped; but the ship had gone clear of the reef and lay still, with a heavy cloud of steam
issuing from the broken deckpipes, and vanishing in wispy shapes into the night. Notwithstanding
the suddenness of the disaster there was no shouting, as if the very violence of the shock
had half-stunned the shadowy lot of people swaying here and there about her decks. The voice
of the Serang pronounced distinctly above the confused murmurs--

"Eight fathom." He had heaved the lead.

Mr. Sterne cried out next in a strained pitch--

"Where the devil has she got to? Where are we?"

Captain Whalley replied in a calm bass--

"Amongst the reefs to the eastward."

"You know it, sir? Then she will never get out again."

"She will be sunk in five minutes. Boats, Sterne. Even one will save you all in this calm."

The Chinaman stokers went in a disorderly rush for the port boats. Nobody tried to check them.
The Malays, after a moment of confusion, became quiet, and Mr. Sterne showed a good countenance.
Captain Whalley had not moved. His thoughts were darker than this night in which he had lost
his first ship.

"He made me lose a ship."

Another tall figure standing before him amongst the litter of the smash on the bridge whispered
insanely--

"Say nothing of it."

Massy stumbled closer. Captain Whalley heard the chattering of his teeth.

"I have the coat."

"Throw it down and come along," urged the chattering voice. "B-b-b-b-boat!"

"You will get fifteen years for this."

Mr. Massy had lost his voice. His speech was a mere dry rustling in his throat.

"Have mercy!"

"Had you any when you made me lose my ship? Mr. Massy, you shall get fifteen years for this!"

"I wanted money! Money! My own money! I will give you some money. Take half of it. You love
money yourself."

"There's a justice . . ."

Massy made an awful effort, and in a strange, half choked utterance--

"You blind devil! It's you that drove me to it."

Captain Whalley, hugging the coat to his breast, made no sound. The light had ebbed for ever
from the world--let everything go. But this man should not escape scot-free.

Sterne's voice commanded--

"Lower away!"

The blocks rattled.

"Now then," he cried, "over with you. This way. You, Jack, here. Mr. Massy! Mr. Massy! Captain!
Quick, sir! Let's get--

"I shall go to prison for trying to cheat the insurance, but you'll get exposed; you, honest
man, who has been cheating me. You are poor. Aren't you? You've nothing but the five hundred
pounds. Well, you have nothing at all now. The ship's lost, and the insurance won't be paid."

Captain Whalley did not move. True! Ivy's money! Gone in this wreck. Again he had a flash of
insight. He was indeed at the end of his tether.

Urgent voices cried out together alongside. Massy did not seem able to tear himself away from
the bridge. He chattered and hissed despairingly--

"Give it up to me! Give it up!"

"No," said Captain Whalley; "I could not give it up. You had better go. Don't wait, man, if
you want to live. She's settling down by the head fast. No; I shall keep it, but I shall stay
on board."

Massy did not seem to understand; but the love of life, awakened suddenly, drove him away from
the bridge.

Captain Whalley laid the coat down, and stumbled amongst the heaps of wreckage to the side.

"Is Mr. Massy in with you?" he called out into the night.

Sterne from the boat shouted--

"Yes; we've got him. Come along, sir. It's madness to stay longer."

Captain Whalley felt along the rail carefully, and, without a word, cast off the painter. They
were expecting him still down there. They were waiting, till a voice suddenly exclaimed--

"We are adrift! Shove off!"

"Captain Whalley! Leap! . . . pull up a little . . . leap! You can swim."

In that old heart, in that vigorous body, there was, that nothing should be wanting, a horror
of death that apparently could not be overcome by the horror of blindness. But after all, for
Ivy he had carried his point, walking in his darkness to the very verge of a crime. God had
not listened to his prayers. The light had finished ebbing out of the world; not a glimmer.
It was a dark waste; but it was unseemly that a Whalley who had gone so far to carry a point
should continue to live. He must pay the price.

"Leap as far as you can, sir; we will pick you up."

They did not hear him answer. But their shouting seemed to remind him of something. He groped
his way back, and sought for Mr. Massy's coat. He could swim indeed; people sucked down by
the whirlpool of a sinking ship do come up sometimes to the surface, and it was unseemly that
a Whalley, who had made up his mind to die, should be beguiled by chance into a struggle. He
would put all these pieces of iron into his own pockets.

They, looking from the boat, saw the Sofala, a black mass upon a black sea, lying still at
an appalling cant. No sound came from her. Then, with a great bizarre shuffling noise, as if
the boilers had broken through the bulkheads, and with a faint muffled detonation, where the
ship had been there appeared for a moment something standing upright and narrow, like a rock
out of the sea. Then that too disappeared.

When the Sofala failed to come back to Batu Beru at the proper time, Mr. Van Wyk understood
at once that he would never see her any more. I made my way into it and by a very nice fiction
of an invalid brother whom I was taking to the South of America I was able to buy for a few dollars
less than was in my pocket two most interesting bags of apparel for a handsome young man of fashion.
The man who assisted me to buy was very large, with a head only ornamented
with a drapery of gray hair around the edges, and he spoke much of
what his son deemed suitable to make appearance in the prevailing
mode.

"He's at tea at the Ritz-Carlton with a lady friend this afternoon, and I wish you could have
saw him when he left the store to meet her," he said as he laid the last of the silk scarfs
and hose into one of the large flat bags I had purchased and which he had packed as I selected.
"He had on the match to these gray tweeds and was fitted out in lavender
from the skin out.

Now what are you going to do about shoes, Miss?"

"That I do not know, kind sir," I made answer with a great perplexity. "I think that the feet of my
relative are about the size of those I possess."

"Most women would wear shoes near the size of their brothers' if they didn't prefer to waddle
and limp along with their feet scrouged. Go over to the shoe department and the clerk will fit
you out with what you need in about two sizes larger than you wear.

If they are not right you can tell just about what will be, and exchange
'em by special messenger.

I'll pack all this shipshape before you come back." With which direction I left the kind man and
made my way to another of equal kindness.

"I have had upon my feet the shoes of my brother when in accidents
while at hunting and fishing, and I think I can ascertain a good fitting,"
I made a falsification to the very polite young man who stood with
attention and sympathy to wait upon me.

"We'll make a selection and then try one pair on," he advised me.

And
as I gave to him a fine description of the clothing I had purchased
he brought forth in accord many wonderful boots and shoes for the
riding and a walking and also for the dance.
I gave him chase right aboard, and he told me then he was going to make his fortune dead sure
in Manilla. I could go to the devil for all he cared. And yet he as good as promised to give
me the command if I didn't talk too much."

"You never said anything . . ." Mr. Van Wyk began.

"Not I, sir. Why should I? I mean to get on, but the dead aren't in my way," said Sterne. His
eyelids were beating rapidly, then drooped for an instant. "Besides, sir, it would have been
an awkward business. You made me hold my tongue just a bit too long."

"Do you know how it was that Captain Whalley remained on board? Did he really refuse to leave?
Come now! Or was it perhaps an accidental . . .?"

"Nothing!" Sterne interrupted with energy. "I tell you I yelled for him to leap overboard.
He simply must have cast off the painter of the boat himself. We all yelled to him--that is,
Jack and I. He wouldn't even answer us. The ship was as silent as a grave to the last. Then
the boilers fetched away, and down she went. Accident! Not it! The game was up, sir, I tell you."

This was all that Sterne had to say.

Mr. Van Wyk had been of course made the guest of the club for a fortnight, and it was there
that he met the lawyer in whose office had been signed the agreement between Massy and Captain
Whalley.

"Extraordinary old man," he said. "He came into my office from nowhere in particular as you
may say, with his five hundred pounds to place, and that engineer fellow following him anxiously.
And now he is gone out a little inexplicably, just as he came. I could never understand him
quite. There was no mystery at all about that Massy, eh? I wonder whether Whalley refused to
leave the ship. It would have been foolish. He was blameless, as the court found."

Mr. Van Wyk had known him well, he said, and he could not believe in suicide. Such an act would
not have been in character with what he knew of the man.

"It is my opinion, too," the lawyer agreed. The general theory was that the captain had remained
too long on board trying to save something of importance. Perhaps the chart which would clear
him, or else something of value in his cabin. The painter of the boat had come adrift of itself
it was supposed. However, strange to say, some little time before that voyage poor Whalley
had called in his office and had left with him a sealed envelope addressed to his daughter,
to be forwarded to her in case of his death. Still it was nothing very unusual, especially
in a man of his age. Mr. Van Wyk shook his head. Captain Whalley looked good for a hundred years.

"Perfectly true," assented the lawyer. "The old fellow looked as though he had come into the
world full-grown and with that long beard. I could never, somehow, imagine him either younger
or older--don't you know. There was a sense of physical power about that man too. And perhaps
that was the secret of that something peculiar in his person which struck everybody who came
in contact with him. He looked indestructible by any ordinary means that put an end to the
rest of us. His deliberate, stately courtesy of manner was full of significance. It was as
though he were certain of having plenty of time for everything. Yes, there was something indestructible
about him; and the way he talked sometimes you might have thought he believed it himself. When
he called on me last with that letter he wanted me to take charge of, he was not depressed
at all. Perhaps a shade more deliberate in his talk and manner. Not depressed in the least.
Had he a presentiment, I wonder? Perhaps! Still it seems a miserable end for such a striking
figure."

"Oh yes! It was a miserable end," Mr. Van Wyk said, with so much fervor that the lawyer looked
up at him curiously; and afterwards, after parting with him, he remarked to an acquaintance--

"Queer person that Dutch tobacco-planter from Batu Beru. Know anything of him?"

"Heaps of money," answered the bank manager. "I hear he's going home by the next mail to form
a company to take over his estates. Another tobacco district thrown open. He's wise, I think.
These good times won't last for ever."

In the southern hemisphere Captain Whalley's daughter had no presentiment of evil when she
opened the envelope addressed to her in the lawyer's handwriting. She had received it in the
afternoon; all the boarders had gone out, her boys were at school, her husband sat upstairs
in his big arm-chair with a book, thin-faced, wrapped up in rugs to the waist. The house was
still, and the grayness of a cloudy day lay against the panes of three lofty windows.

In a shabby dining-room, where a faint cold smell of dishes lingered all the year round, sitting
at the end of a long table surrounded by many chairs pushed in with their backs close against
the edge of the perpetually laid table-cloth, she read the opening sentence: "Most profound
regret--painful duty--your father is no more--in accordance with his instructions--fatal casualty--consolation--no
blame attached to his memory. . . ."

Her face was thin, her temples a little sunk under the smooth bands of black hair, her lips
remained resolutely compressed, while her dark eyes grew larger, till at last, with a low cry,
she stood up, and instantly stooped to pick up another envelope which had slipped off her knees
on to the floor.

She tore it open, snatched out the inclosure. . . .

"My dearest child," it said, "I am writing this while I am able yet to write legibly. I am
trying hard to save for you all the money that is left; I have only kept it to serve you better.
It is yours. It shall not be lost: it shall not be touched. There's five hundred pounds. Of
what I have earned I have kept nothing back till now. For the future, if I live, I must keep
back some--a little--to bring me to you. I must come to you. I must see you once more.

"It is hard to believe that you will ever look on these lines. God seems to have forgotten
me. I want to see you--and yet death would be a greater favor. If you ever read these words,
I charge you to begin by thanking a God merciful at last, for I shall be dead then, and it
will be well. My dear, I am at the end of my tether."

The next paragraph began with the words: "My sight is going . . ."

She read no more that day. The hand holding up the paper to her eyes fell slowly, and her slender
figure in a plain black dress walked rigidly to the window. Her eyes were dry: no cry of sorrow
or whisper of thanks went up to heaven from her lips. Life had been too hard, for all the efforts
of his love. It had silenced her emotions. But for the first time in all these years its sting
had departed, the carking care of poverty, the meanness of a hard struggle for bread. Even
the image of her husband and of her children seemed to glide away from her into the gray twilight;
it was her father's face alone that she saw, as though he had come to see her, always quiet
and big, as she had seen him last, but with something more august and tender in his aspect.

She slipped his folded letter between the two buttons of her plain black bodice, and leaning
her forehead against a window-pane remained there till dusk, perfectly motionless, giving him
all the time she could spare. Gone! Was it possible? My God, was it possible! The blow had
come softened by the spaces of the earth, by the years of absence. There had been whole days
when she had not thought of him at all--had no time. But she had loved him, she felt she had
loved him, after all.
