Out of the darkness came the devout words; they seemed to take wing, as though to pierce the
shrouding mist and scatter it; but they themselves were finally dissolved in the triumph and
blackness. . . .

I did not have to urge the old man to continue his tale.  His prayers over, he picked up the
thread of his narrative, as if something were driving him to give a full account of what he
had passed through.--

The day I became acquainted with Jacob--continued the old man--I consider the beginning of
a new period in my life.  I became accustomed to consider him my superior, whose behavior had
to be taken as an example.  Jacob spoke as an authority whenever he did speak, and he never
wavered in his decisions.  Whenever he happened to be in doubt, his father would "instruct"
him in his dreams.  Thus we lived according to Jacob's decisions and dreams.  I got used to
eating forbidden food, to breaking the Sabbath, and trespassing against all the ordinances
of the ritual without compunction.  And yet Jacob used to preach to us, to bear floggings and
all kinds of punishments rather than turn traitor to our faith.  So I got the notion that our
faith is neither prayers, nor a collection of ordinances of varying importance, but something
I could not name, nor point to with my finger.  Jacob, I thought, certainly knows all about
it; but I do not.  All I could was to feel it; so could Anna.  Otherwise she would not have
called me Zhid, and would not have hated me so much, in spite of seeing me break all the ordinances
of the Jewish ritual.

At times I thought that I and my comrades were captains in God's army, that all His ordinances
were not meant for us, but for the plain soldiers of the line.  They, the rank and file, must
be subjected to discipline, must know how to submit to authority; all of which does not apply
to the commanding officers.  It seemed to me that this was what the Holy One, blessed be He,
had deigned to reveal to us through the dreams of Jacob: there is another religion for you,
the elect.  You will surely know what is forbidden, and what is permitted. . . .

Sometimes, again, I imagined that I might best prove true to my faith if I set my heart against
the temptation that Satan had put before me in the person of Marusya.  If I turned away from
her, I thought, I might at once gain my share in the future world.  So I armed myself against
Marusya's influence in every possible way.  I firmly resolved to throw back at her any food
she might offer me. If she laid her hand on me, I would push it away from me, and tell her
plainly that I was a Jew, and she--a nobody.

So I fought with her shadow, and, indeed, got the best of it as long as she herself was away.
But the moment she appeared, all my weapons became useless.  She made me feel like one drunk.
I could not withstand the wild-fire of her eye, nor the charm of her merry talk, nor the wonderful
attraction of her whole person.  At the same time there was not a trace of deviltry about her:
it was simply an attraction which I could not resist.  And when she laid her soft hand on me,
I bent under it, and gave myself up entirely.  And she did what she wanted: where buttons were
missing, she sewed them on; and where a patch was needed, she put it in.  She was a little
mother to me.  She used to bring me all kinds of delicacies and order me to eat them; and I
could not disobey her.  In short, she made me forget Jacob and his teachings.  But the moment
I met Jacob I forgot Marusya's charms, and reminded myself that it was sinful to accept favors
in exile.  Then I would repent of my past actions from the very depths of my heart--till I
again was face to face with Marusya.  I was between the hammer and the anvil.

My meetings with Jacob were regular and frequent.  After what according to Jacob's calendar
was the Ninth of Av, we met nightly in the valley on Peter's estate, till a disagreement broke
out among us.  I would not permit the cattle of the whole neighborhood to browse on the estate
of my patron, and Simeon and Reuben would not agree to let my patron's horses be brought to
the meadows of their patrons.  Our congregation nearly broke up.  But here Jacob intervened
with his expert decision.

"Boys," said he, "you must know that 'going out for the night' is really a form of stealing.
True, we do not steal for our own benefit.  Yet, as long as we have a hand in it, we must manage
it in a fair way.  So let us figure out how many horses every one of our patrons possesses.
And let us arrange the nights according to the number of horses each of the patrons has.  According
to this calculation we shall change places.  We shall spend more nights in the meadows of those
who have more horses.  That will make 'fair stealing.'"

The plan of Jacob was accepted, not as a proposition, but as an order.  Since that time we
began to "steal with justice."  And our patrons slept peacefully, delighted with their unpunished
thievery, till a Gentile boy, one Serge Ivanovich, joined us on one of his own "nights."  He
was the son of the village elder, and a cousin of Peter Khlopov.  He was compelled to obey
Jacob, but the next morning he blabbed about it all over the village.

Of course, our patrons were angry.  Jacob took the whole blame on himself, and suffered punishment
for all of us.  Then "Jacob's Klaus" was closed, because our patrons gave up sending us out
"for the night."

Well, if you please, their dissatisfaction was not entirely groundless: they found themselves
fooled by us, and cheated in a way.  For every one of them had been thinking that his horse
would bring him some profit every night, equal to the value of the horse's browsing.  Seven
nights, seven times that profit; thirty nights, thirty times that profit. . . .  All at once
these "profits" had vanished: it turned out that every horse had been browsing at the expense
of his own master; so the expected profits became a total loss.  Of course, stealing is stealing.
But then, they argued, had the Zhid youngsters any right to meddle with their affairs?  Was
it their property that was being stolen?  As one of my Gentile acquaintances told me once:
"The trouble with the Jews is that they are always pushing themselves in where they are not
wanted at all."

Indeed, it was this fault of ours that Serge kept pointing out to me and berating us for. 
Well, Jacob's Klaus had been closed.  But we managed to get together in different places. 
Once in a while we came to see one another at our patron's houses, and they did not object.

I do not know who told Marusya what kind of a chap Jacob was, and what he thought of her; but
she hated him from the moment she first saw him, when he came to visit me.

"He is a real savage," she would say.  "I never saw such a Jew.  I am simply afraid of him.
I am afraid of those wild eyes of his.  I detest him, anyway."  That is what she used to tell me.

Whenever Jacob came to see me, and Marusya happened to be in the room, she would walk out immediately,
and would not return before he was out of the house.  I rather liked it.  I could not be giving
in to both of them at the same time.

Such were the surroundings that shaped my life during those days. Peter befriended me; but
Anna kept on worrying me and making me miserable.  Marusya loved me as a sister loves a brother,
and the fire of her eyes ate into my heart.  Jacob kept preaching to me that it was wrong to
accept favors from Gentiles, and that we had to fight for our faith.  Serge became my bitter
enemy from the time he betrayed our scheme of "honest stealing."

To top it all, my sergeant tried to put me through the paces of the military drill, and succeeded.

But my own self seemed to have been totally forgotten and left out of the account.

By and by the summer passed, and most of the following winter; and in the Khlopov household
preparations were made for some holiday, I forget which.  Those days of preparation were our
most miserable days in exile.  When Anna was busy on the eve of a holiday, I could not help
remembering our own Sabbath eves at home, the Sabbath days in the Klaus, as well as the other
holidays, and all the things that are so dear to the heart of the Jewish boy.  That was the
time when I felt especially lonely and homesick; it was as though a fever were burning within
me.  Then neither tears nor even Marusya's company did me any good.  I felt as if red-hot coals
had been packed up right here in my breast.  Did you ever feel that way?  I felt like rolling
on the ground and pressing my chest against something hard. I felt I was going mad.  I felt
like jumping, crying, singing, and fighting all at once.  I felt as if even lashes would be
welcome, simply to get rid of that horrible heartache.

On that particular day Khlopov was late in coming home.  Marusya remarked that she had seen
her father enter the tavern.  Then Anna began to curse "our Moshko," the tavern keeper.  Marusya
objected:

"Tut, tut, mother, is it any of Moshko's fault?  Does he compel papa to go there?  Does he
compel him to drink?"

Then Anna few into a temper, and poured out a torrent of curses and insults on Marusya.  I
don't know what happened to me then.  My blood was up; my fists tightened.  It was a dangerous
moment; I was ready to pounce upon Anna.  I did not know that Marusya had been watching me
all the while from behind, and understood all that was passing within me.  Presently the door
opened, and Khlopov entered, rather tipsy, hopping and jigging.  That was his way when in his
cups.  When he was under the influence of liquor, his soul seemed to spread beyond its usual
limits and light up his face with smiles. At such moments he would be ready to hug, to kiss,
or to cry; or else to curse, to fight, and to laugh at the same time.

Right here you can see the difference between the Jew and the Gentile.  The finer soul of the
Jew may contract and settle on the very point of his nose.  But the grosser soul of the Gentile
needs, as it were, more space to spread over.  This, I believe, is why Khlopov never failed
to get a clean shave on the eve of every holiday.

As soon as Khlopov had entered the room, he began to play with me and Marusya.  He gave us
candy, and insisted on dancing a jig with us.

Anna met him with a frown:  "Drunk again?"  But this time her eyes seemed to have no power
over Khlopov.  He could not stand it any longer, and gave tit for tat.  "Zhidovka!" he shouted.
I looked at Anna: she turned red.  Marusya blushed.  Khlopov sobered up, and his soul shrank
to its usual size.  Anna went to her room.  The spell was broken.

The word "Zhidovka" hurled at Anna made me start back.  What could it mean, I wondered.  I
felt sorry for Khlopov, for Marusya, for Anna, and for the holiday mood that had been spoilt
by a single word.  And it seemed to me it was my fault to some extent.  Who, I thought, had
anything in common with Zhidovka if not myself?  Or was it Khlopov?--

Here the old man was interrupted by the neighing of the horses.

The forward horse seemed to be getting proud of the comparative freedom he enjoyed, and bit
his neighbor, only to remind him of it. The latter, unable to turn around in the harness, resented
the insult by kicking.  But then the driver plied the whip, and there was peace again.

"Would you take the trouble to dismount?  Just walk up that hill: it will do you good to warm
yourselves up a little after sitting so long in one place."

That was the driver's suggestion; and as no one refuses obedience to drivers on the road, we
dismounted.
