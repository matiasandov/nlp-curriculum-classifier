What a picture that letter gives us of the half humorous, half pathetic spirit in which the
great publisher endured the daily grind. Twenty years of it wore him out, but his dolphin-and-anchor
trade-mark still after four centuries preaches patience and hope to all who undertake great
burdens for the enlightenment of mankind.

The Aldine press did not confine its efforts to the ancient classics, but printed editions
of Dante and Petrarch and other Italian poets, and produced the first editions of some of the
most important works of Erasmus. But all of its publications belonged in general to the movement
known as humanism, the field of ancient and contemporary poetry, drama, philosophy, history,
and art. Aldus left to others, especially to the great ecclesiastical printers of Venice and
of Rome, the printing of the scriptures, the works of the church fathers, and the innumerable
volumes of theological controversy with which the age abounded. In France, on the other hand,
the great publishing house of the Estiennes, or Stephani, to whom we next direct our attention,
divided its efforts between the secular and sacred literature. Inasmuch as the history of the
Stephanus establishment is typical of the influence of printing upon the Renaissance, and of
the Renaissance upon printing, which is the subject of this paper, we may well examine some
aspects of its career.

Printing had been introduced into France in 1469 by the ecclesiastics of the Sorbonne. The pursuit
being indiscreetly conducted by the patriots, and a fresh royalist division arriving to support
Morillo, the fortune of the day was changed. Each party was alternately defeated, and both rallied
their dispersed corps to reengage at Ortiz. For the first generation the French printers
enjoyed a considerable freedom from censorship and burdensome restrictions. They published,
like the Venetians, both the Greek and Latin classics and the works of contemporary writers.
Both Louis XII. and Francis I. gave their patronage and encouragement to various eminent scholar-printers
who flourished between the establishment of the first publishing-houses in Paris and the beginning
of the sixteenth century. I pass over all these to select as the typical French printers of
the Renaissance the family founded by Henri Estienne the elder. His first book, a Latin translation
of Aristotle's Ethica, appeared in 1504. From that date for nearly a hundred years the house
of Stephanus and his descendants led the publishing business in France. Both in the artistic
advancement of the art of printing and in the intellectual advancement of French thought by
their selection of the works to be issued they earned a right to the enduring gratitude of mankind.

Henri Estienne, the founder of the house, who died in 1520, had published during these sixteen
years at least one hundred separate works. Although they were mostly Latin, many of them revealed
Estienne's knowledge of and devotion to the new Greek studies, and this tendency on his part
was at once suspected as heretical by the orthodox doctors of the Sorbonne. The favor of King
Francis was not at all times sufficient to protect him from persecution, and an increasing
severity of censorship arose, the full force of which began to be evident in the time of his
son Robert.

After Henri's death his business was for a time carried on by his widow's second husband, Simon
Colines, a scholar and humanist of brilliant attainments. Both while at the head of the house
of Stephanus and later when he had withdrawn from that in favor of Robert Estienne his stepson
and set up a separate publishing business, Colines added much to the prestige of French printing.
He caused Greek fonts to be cast, not inferior to those of the Venetian printers, and began
to publish the Greek classics in beautiful editions. It was Colines, rather than either the
elder or the younger Estienne, who elevated the artistic side of French printing by engaging
the services of such famous typographical experts as Geofroy Tory, and adding to his books
illustrations of the highest excellence, as well as decorative initials and borders. Indeed
it may be said that after the death of Aldus supremacy in the fine art of book-making gradually
passed from Venice to Paris.

The greatest of the Estiennes was Robert, son of Henri Estienne and stepson of Colines, who
was in control of the house from 1524 to his death in 1559. The very first book he published
was an edition of the Latin Testament. Although following in the main the Vulgate or official
Bible of the Roman Church, he introduced certain corrections based on his knowledge of the
Greek text. This marked the beginning of a long controversy between Estienne and the orthodox
divines of the Sorbonne, which lasted almost throughout his life. In following years he published
many editions of the Latin scriptures, each time with additional corrections, and eventually
with his own notes and comments, in some cases attacking the received doctrines of the Church.
A Hebrew Old Testament, in 1546, was followed in 1550 by the Greek New Testament. The next
year he published a new edition of the Testament in which for the first time it was divided
into verses, a precedent followed in Bible printing ever since. It was not merely the fact
of his printing the scriptures at all that angered the heresy-hunters, but much more Estienne's
notes and comments, in which, like Luther in Germany and Tyndale in England, he sided with
the views of the Reformers.

What distinguishes Robert Estienne from the ordinary Protestant scholars and publishers of
his time is the fact that he was not only a Reformer but a humanist of broad and tolerant culture.
In all the illustrious group of that age there is scarcely another like him in this union of
religious zeal and of scholarly culture. Luther and Calvin and Tyndale had the one; Erasmus
is the most eminent example of the other, with such great publishers as Aldus and Froben his
worthy supporters. He is fond of giving toasts, which he always prefaces in the most eloquent and
appropriate manner; and his enthusiasm is so great, that he frequently mounts his chair, or the
table, to propose them. Although the cigar is almost universally used in South America, Bolivar
never smokes, nor does he permit smoking in his presence. He is never without proper officers
in waiting, and keeps up a considerable degree of etiquette. Disinterested
in the extreme with regard to pecuniary affairs, he is insatiably
covetous of fame.
