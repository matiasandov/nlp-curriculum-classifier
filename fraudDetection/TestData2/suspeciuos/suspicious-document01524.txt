Thus did this cool hand take possession of an established industry, and in much the same fashion
did she continue to manage it. There were unsuppressible protests; there was covert anguish;
there was even a strike--but it was a short one. When the printers remained away from their
late Newspaper Building, on Wednesday afternoon, Florence had an interview with Herbert after
dinner at his own door. He explained coldly that Henry and he had grown tired of the printing-press
and had decided to put in all their spare time building a theatre in Henry's attic; but Florence
gave him to understand that the theatre could not be; she preferred the Oriole.

Henry and Herbert had both stopped "speaking" to Patty Fairchild, for each believed her treacherous
to himself; but Florence now informed Herbert that far from depending on mere hearsay, she
had in her own possession the confession of his knowledge that he had ocular beauty; that she
had discovered the paper where Patty had lost it; and that it was now in a secure place, and
in an envelope, upon the outside of which was already written, "For Wallie Torbin. Kindness
of Florence A."

Herbert surrendered.

So did Henry Rooter, a little later that evening, after a telephoned conversation with the
slave-driver.

Therefore, the two miserable printers were back in their places the next afternoon. They told
each other that the theatre they had planned wasn't so much after all; and anyhow your father
and mother didn't last all your life, and it was better to do what they wanted, and be polite
while they were alive.

And on Saturday the new Oriole, now in every jot and item the inspired organ of feminism, made
its undeniably sensational appearance.

A copy, neatly folded, was placed in the hand of Noble Dill, as he set forth for his place
of business, after lunching at home with his mother. Florence was the person who placed it
there; she came hurriedly from somewhere in the neighbourhood, out of what yard or alley he
did not notice, and slipped the little oblong sheet into his lax fingers.

"There!" she said breathlessly. "There's a good deal about you in it this week, Mr. Dill, and
I guess--I guess----"

"What, Florence?"

"I guess maybe you'll----" She looked up at him shyly; then, with no more to say, turned and
ran back in the direction whence she had come. Noble walked on, not at once examining her little
gift, but carrying it absently in fingers still lax at the end of a dangling arm. There was
no life in him for anything. Julia was away.

Away! And yet the dazzling creature looked at him from sky, from earth, from air; looked at
him with the most poignant kindness, yet always shook her head! She had answered his first
letter by a kind little note, his second by a kinder and littler one, and his third, fourth,
fifth, and sixth by no note at all; but by the kindest message (through one of her aunts) that
she was thinking about him a great deal. And even this was three weeks ago. Since then from
Julia--nothing at all!

But yesterday something a little stimulating had happened. On the street, downtown, he had
come face to face, momentarily, with Julia's father; and for the first time in Noble's life
Mr. Atwater nodded to him pleasantly. Noble went on his way, elated. Was there not something
almost fatherly in this strange greeting?

An event so singular might be interpreted in the happiest way: What had Julia written her father,
to change him so toward Noble? And Noble was still dreamily interpreting as he walked down
the street with The North End Daily Oriole idle in an idle hand.

He found a use for that hand presently, and, having sighed, lifted it to press it upon his
brow, but did not complete the gesture. As his hand came within the scope of his gaze, levelled
on the unfathomable distance, he observed that the fingers held a sheet of printed paper; and
he remembered Florence. Instead of pressing his brow he unfolded the journal she had thrust
upon him. As he began to read, his eye was lustreless, his gait slack and dreary; but soon
his whole demeanour changed, it cannot be said for the better.

CHAPTER TWENTY

Throughout that afternoon adult members of the Atwater family connection made futile efforts
to secure all the copies of the week's edition of The North End Daily Oriole. It could not be done.

It was a trying time for "the family." Great Aunt Carrie said that she had the "worst afternoon
of any of 'em," because young Newland Sanders came to her house at two and did not leave until
five; all the time counting over, one by one, the hours he'd spent with Julia since she was
seventeen and turned out, unfortunately, to be a Beauty. Newland had not restrained himself,
Aunt Carrie said, and long before he left she wished Julia had never been born--and as for
Herbert Illingsworth Atwater, Junior, the only thing to do with him was to send him to some
strict Military School.

Florence's father telephoned to her mother from downtown at three, and said that Mr. George
Plum and the ardent vocalist, Clairdyce, had just left his office. They had not called in company,
however, but coincidentally; and each had a copy of The North End Daily Oriole, already somewhat
worn with folding and unfolding. Mr. Clairdyce's condition was one of desperate calm, Florence's
father said, but Mr. Plum's agitation left him rather unpresentable for the street, though
he had finally gone forth with his hair just as he had rumpled it, and with his hat in his
hand. They wished the truth, they said: Was it true or was it not true? Mr. Atwater had told
them that he feared Julia was indeed engaged, though he knew nothing of her fiancé's previous
marriage or marriages, or of the number of his children. They had responded that they cared
nothing about that. This man Crum's record was a matter of indifference to them, they said.
All they wanted to know was whether Julia was engaged or not--and she was! 

Charles has put down what he conceives to be your principal objections, and I think the best
course I can take will be to state what occurs to me upon each of them.

1.

I should not think that it would be in any degree disreputable to his character as a Clergyman.
I should on the contrary think the offer honourable to him; and the pursuit of Natural History,
though certainly not professional, is very suitable to a clergyman.

2.

I hardly know how to meet this objection, but he would have definite objects upon which to employ
himself, and might acquire and strengthen habits of application, and I should think would be
as likely to do so as in any way in which he is likely to pass the next two years at home.

3.
The notion did not occur to me in reading the letters; and on reading them again with that
object in my mind I see no ground for it.

4. I cannot conceive that the Admiralty would send out a bad vessel on such a service. As to objections
to the expedition, they will differ in each man's case, and nothing would, I think, be inferred
in Charles's case, if it were known that others had objected.

5.

You are a much better judge of Charles's character than I can be.

If on comparing this mode of spending the next two years with the
way in which he will probably spend them, if he does not accept this
offer, you think him more likely to be rendered unsteady and unable
to settle, it is undoubtedly a weighty objection.

Is it not the case that sailors are prone to settle in domestic and quiet habits?

6.

I can form no opinion on this further than that if appointed by the
Admiralty he will have a claim to be as well accommodated as the vessel
will allow.

7. If I saw Charles now absorbed in professional studies I should probably think it would not be
advisable to interrupt them; but this is not, and, I think, will not be the case with him. His present
pursuit of knowledge is in the same track as he would have to follow
in the expedition.

8. The undertaking would be useless as regards his profession, but looking upon him as a man
of enlarged curiosity, it affords him such an opportunity of seeing men and things as happens to few.

You
will bear in mind that I have had very little time for consideration, and that you and Charles
are the persons who must decide.

I am, My dear Doctor, Affectionately yours, JOSIAH WEDGWOOD.

CHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Cambridge, Red Lion [September 2], 1831.

My dear Sir,

I am just arrived; you will guess the reason. My father has changed his mind. I trust the place
is not given away.

I am very much fatigued, and am going to bed.

I dare say you have not yet got my second letter.

How soon shall I come to you in the morning?

Send a verbal answer.

Good-night, Yours, C. DARWIN.

CHARLES DARWIN TO MISS SUSAN DARWIN. Cambridge, Sunday Morning [September 4].

My dear Susan,

As a letter would not have gone yesterday, I put off writing till to-day. I had rather a wearisome
journey, but got into Cambridge very fresh.

The whole of yesterday I spent with Henslow, thinking of what is to be done, and that I find
is a great deal. By great good luck I know a man of the name of Wood, nephew of Lord Londonderry.
He is a great friend of Captain Fitz-Roy, and has written to him about me. I heard a part of
Captain Fitz- Roy's letter, dated some time ago, in which he says:
"I have a right good set of officers, and most of my men have been
there before." It seems he has been there for the last few years;
he was then second in command with the same vessel that he has now
chosen. He is only twenty-three years old, but [has] seen a deal of
service, and won the gold medal at Portsmouth. The Admiralty say his
maps are most perfect. He had choice of two vessels, and he chose
the smallest. Henslow will give me letters to all travellers in town
whom he thinks may assist me.

Peacock has sole appointment of Naturalist.
The first person offered was Leonard Jenyns, who was so near accepting
it that he packed up his clothes. But having [a] living, he did not
think it right to leave it--to the great regret of all his family.
Henslow himself was not very far from accepting it, for Mrs. Henslow
most generously, and without being asked, gave her consent; but she
looked so miserable that Henslow at once settled the point.

...

I
am afraid there will be a good deal of expense at first. Henslow is
much against taking many things; it is [the] mistake all young travellers
fall into. I write as if it was settled, but Henslow tells me BY NO
MEANS to make up my mind till I have had long conversations with Captains
Beaufort and Fitz-Roy. Good-bye. You will hear from me constantly.
Direct 17 Spring Gardens. TELL NOBODY in Shropshire yet. Be sure not.

C.
DARWIN.

I was so tired that evening I was in Shrewsbury that I thanked
none of you for your kindness half so much as I felt.

Love to my
father.

The reason I don't want people told in Shropshire: in case
I should not go, it will make it more flat. There was a touch of wistfulness about her, too; as of one whose
benevolence must renounce all hope of comprehension and reward.

Now, among those who observed her unusual expression was a gentleman of great dimensions disposed
in a closed automobile that went labouring among mudholes in an unpaved outskirt of the town.
He rapped upon the glass before him, to get the driver's attention, and a moment later the
car drew up beside Florence, as she stood in a deep reverie at the intersection of two roads.

Uncle Joseph opened the door and took his cigar from his mouth. "Get in, Florence," he said.
"I'll take you for a ride." She started violently; whereupon he restored the cigar to his mouth,
puffed upon it, breathing heavily the while as was his wont, and added, "I'm not going home.
I'm out for a nice long ride. Get in."

"I was takin' a walk," she said dubiously. "I haf to take a whole lot of exercise, and I ought
to walk and walk and walk. I guess I ought to keep on walkin'."

"Get in," he said. "I'm out riding. I don't know when I'll get home!"

Florence stepped in, Uncle Joseph closed the door, and the car slowly bumped onward.

"You know where Herbert is?" Uncle Joseph inquired.

"No," said Florence, in a gentle voice.

"I do," he said. "Herbert and your friend Henry Rooter came to our house with one of the last
copies of the Oriole they were distributing to subscribers; and after I read it I kind of foresaw
that the feller responsible for their owning a printing-press was going to be in some sort
of family trouble or other. I had quite a talk with 'em and they hinted they hadn't had much
to do with this number of the paper, except the mechanical end of it; but they wouldn't come
out right full with what they meant. They seemed to have some good reason for protecting a
third party, and said quite a good deal about their fathers and mothers being but mortal and
so on; so Henry and Herbert thought they oughtn't to expose this third party--whoever she may
happen to be. Well, I thought they better not stay too long, because I was compromised enough
already, without being seen in their company; and I gave 'em something to help 'em out with
at the movies. You can stay at movies an awful long time, and if you've got money enough to
go to several of 'em, why, you're fixed for pretty near as long as you please. A body ought
to be able to live a couple o' months at the movies for nine or ten dollars, I should think."

He was silent for a time, then asked, "I don't suppose your papa and mamma will be worrying
about you, will they, Florence?"

"Oh, no!" she said quickly. "Not in the least! There was nothin' at all for me to do at our
house this afternoon."

"That's good," he said, "because before we go back I was thinking some of driving around by
way of Texas."

Florence looked at him trustfully and said nothing. It seemed to her that he suspected something;
she was not sure; but his conversation was a little peculiar, though not in the least sinister.
Indeed she was able to make out that he had more the air of an accomplice than of a prosecutor
or a detective. Nevertheless, she was convinced that far, far the best course for her to pursue,
during the next few days, would be one of steadfast reserve. And such a course was congenial
to her mood, which was subdued, not to say apprehensive; though she was sure her recent conduct,
if viewed sympathetically, would be found at least Christian. The trouble was that probably
it would not be viewed sympathetically. No one would understand how carefully and tactfully
she had prepared the items of the Oriole to lead suavely up to the news of Aunt Julia's engagement
and break it to Noble Dill in a manner that would save his reason.

Therefore, on account of this probable lack of comprehension on the part of the family and
public, it seemed to her that the only wise and good course to follow would be to claim nothing
for herself, but to allow Herbert and Henry to remain undisturbed in full credit for publishing
the Oriole. This involved a disappointment, it is true; nevertheless, she decided to bear it.

She had looked forward to surprising "the family" delightfully. As they fluttered in exclamation
about her, she had expected to say, "Oh, the poem isn't so much, I guess--I wrote it quite
a few days ago and I'm writing a couple new ones now--but I did take quite a lot o' time and
trouble with the rest of the paper, because I had to write every single word of it, or else
let Henry and Herbert try to, and 'course they'd just of ruined it. Oh, it isn't so much to
talk about, I guess; it just sort of comes to me to do things that way."

Thirteen attempts to exercise a great philanthropy, and every grown person in sight, with the
possible exception of Great-Uncle Joseph, goes into wholly unanticipated fits of horror. Cause
and effect have no honest relation: Fate operates without justice or even rational sequence;
life and the universe appear to be governed, not in order and with system, but by Chance, becoming
sinister at any moment without reason.

And while Florence, thus a pessimist, sat beside fat Uncle Joseph during their long, long drive,
relatives of hers were indeed going into fits; at least, so Florence would have described their
gestures and incoherences of comment. Moreover, after the movies, straight into such a fitful
scene did the luckless Herbert walk when urged homeward by thoughts of food, at about six that
evening. Henry Rooter had strongly advised him against entering the house.

"You better not," he said earnestly. "Honest, you better not, Herbert!"

"Well, we got apple dumplings for dinner," Herbert said, his tone showing the strain of mental
uncertainty. "Eliza told me this morning we were goin' to have 'em. I kind of hate to go in,
but I guess I better, Henry."

"You won't see any apple dumplings," Henry predicted.

"Well, I believe I better try it, Henry."

"You better come home with me. My father and mother'll be perfectly willing to have you."

"I know that," said Herbert. "But I guess I better go in and try it, anyhow, Henry. I didn't
have anything to do with what's in the Oriole. It's every last word ole Florence's doing. I
haven't got any more right to be picked on for that than a child."

"Yes," Henry admitted. "But if you go and tell 'em so, I bet she'd get even with you some way
that would probably get me in trouble, too, before we get through with the job. I wouldn't
tell 'em if I was you, Herbert!"

"Well, I wasn't intending to," Herbert responded gloomily; and the thought of each, unknown
to the other, was the same, consisting of a symbolic likeness of Wallie Torbin at his worst.
"I ought to tell on Florence; by rights I ought," said Herbert; "but I've decided I won't.
There's no tellin' what she wouldn't do. Not that she could do anything to me, particyourly----"

"Nor me, either," his friend interposed hurriedly. "I don't worry about anything like that!
Still, if I was you I wouldn't tell. She's only a girl, we got to remember."

"Yes," said Herbert. "That's the way I look at it, Henry; and the way I look at it is just
simply this: long as she is a girl, why, simply let her go. You can't tell what she'd do, and
so what's the use to go and tell on a girl?"

"That's the way I look at it," Henry agreed. "What's the use? If I was in your place, I'd act
just the same way you do."

"Well," said Herbert, "I guess I better go on in the house, Henry. It's a good while after dark."

"You're makin' a big mistake!" Henry Rooter called after him. "You won't see any apple dumplings,
I bet a hunderd dollars! You better come on home with me."

Herbert no more than half opened his front door before he perceived that his friend's advice
had been excellent. So clearly Herbert perceived this, that he impulsively decided not to open
the door any farther, but on the contrary to close it and retire; and he would have done so,
had his mother not reached forth and detained him. She was, in fact, just inside that door,
standing in the hall with one of his great-aunts, one of his aunts, two aunts-by-marriage,
and an elderly unmarried cousin, who were all just on the point of leaving. However, they changed
their minds and decided to remain, now that Herbert was among them.

The captive's father joined them, a few minutes later, but it had already become clear to Herbert
that The North End Daily Oriole was in one sense a thing of the past, though in another sense
this former owner and proprietor was certain that he would never hear the last of it. However,
on account of the life of blackmail and slavery now led by the members of the old régime, the
Oriole's extinction was far less painful to Herbert than his father supposed; and the latter
wasted a great deal of severity, insisting that the printing-press should be returned that
very night to Uncle Joseph. Herbert's heartiest retrospective wish was that the ole printing-press
had been returned to Uncle Joseph long ago.

"If you can find him to give it to!" Aunt Harriet suggested. "Nobody knows where he goes when
he gets the way he did this afternoon when we were discussing it with him! I only hope he'll
be back to-night!"

"He can't stay away forever," Aunt Fanny remarked. "That garage is charging him five dollars
an hour for the automobile he's in, and surely even Joseph will decide there's a limit to wildness
some time!"

"I don't care when he comes back," Herbert's father declared grimly. "O, my dear sir," said the
artist, "they are under the sea." This is a very fine illustration of facts, if Darwinism
may boast of facts, for the connecting links between species are
"under the sea" of oblivion, never to be found, and the old species
"have passed over."

Mr. Darwin's apology is in these words: "Every one will admit that the geological record is
imperfect; but very few can believe that it is so very imperfect as my theory demands." This
is a grand concession. The "wild speculation" has no support from geology. The blanket of
oblivion, which Mr. Darwin and his friends spread over the difficulty, is "millions of years."
In that length of time the missing species, or links, would, of course,
all pass out of sight.

Is this true? No. In the geological record millions of specimens are fossilized and laid away
in nature's great cabinet. Why not find a few of the missing links there? Just one. "One fact,
gentlemen, if you please."

Science is certain knowledge.

Is there certain knowledge of missing links? Gentlemen, just bridge one gulf for us; the gulf lying
between any two species will do.

We get impatient, standing and gazing.

Look! Can you see across?

Mr. Darwin says, "Professor Haeckel, in his general Morphology and
other works, has brought his great knowledge and abilities to bear
on what he calls phylogeny or the lines of descent of all organic
beings."--Origin of Species, p. 381.

This author, Mr. Haeckel, has "lines of descent" which involves the idea of a plurality of
beginnings in the history of organic being; that is, Mr. Haeckel claims a vertebrate series with
a vertebrate lying at the base of the series, and an articulate series
with an articulate lying at its base.

So there must be A SPECIAL CREATION AT LAST.

Hear him: "There appears, indeed, to be a limit given to the adaptability
of every organism by the type of its tribe or phylum.

Thus, for example, no vertebrate animal can acquire the ventral nerve
chord of articulate animals instead of the characteristic spinal marrow
of the vertebrate animals."--History of Creation, vol.

1, p. 250. So the vertebrate must forever remain a vertebrate, and
the articulate forever an articulate.

Were they both evolved from the same unit?

We are anxious to know, how from a pulpy mass of flesh, from a moneron,
a creature of one substance, vertebrates were evolved.

We would like to know, also, how a creature of more than one substance
could be evolved from a creature of one substance without more being
gotten out of the thing than there was in it.



"Old man Dill said they were all pretty anxious," said Mr. Atwater. "They're afraid Noble has--they're
afraid he's disappeared."

Aunt Fanny screamed.

Then, in perfect accord, they all turned to look at Herbert, who rose and would have retired
upstairs had he been permitted.

As that perturbing evening wore on, word gradually reached the most outlying members of the
Atwater family connection that Noble Dill was missing. Ordinarily, this bit of news would have
caused them no severe anxiety. Noble's person and intellect were so commonplace--"insignificant"
was the term usually preferred in his own circle--that he was considered to be as nearly negligible
as it is charitable to consider a fellow-being. True, there was one thing that set him apart;
he was found worthy of a superlative when he fell in love with Julia; and of course this distinction
caused him to become better known and more talked about than he had been in his earlier youth.

However, the eccentricities of a person in such an extremity of love are seldom valued except
as comedy, and even then with no warmth of heart for the comedian, but rather with an incredulous
disdain; so it is safe to say that under other circumstances, Noble might have been missing,
indeed, and few of the Atwaters would have missed him. But as matters stood they worried a
great deal about him, fearing that a rash act on his part might reflect notoriety upon themselves
on account of their beautiful relative--and The North End Daily Oriole. And when nine o'clock
came and Mrs. Dill reported to Herbert's father, over the telephone, that nothing had yet been
heard of her son, the pressure of those who were blaming the Oriole more than they blamed Julia
became so wearing that Herbert decided he would rather spend the remaining days of his life
running away from Wallie Torbin than put in any more of such a dog's evening as he was putting
in. Thus he defined it.

He made a confession; that is to say, it was a proclamation. He proclaimed his innocence. He
began history with a description of events distinctly subsequent to Sunday pastimes with Patty
Fairchild, and explained how he and Henry had felt that their parents would not always be with
them, and as their parents wished them to be polite, they had resolved to be polite to Florence.
Proceeding, he related in detail her whole journalistic exploit.

Of the matter in hand he told the perfect and absolute truth--and was immediately refuted,
confuted, and demonstrated to be a false witness by Aunt Fanny, Aunt Carrie, and Cousin Virginia,
who had all heard him vehemently declare, no longer ago than the preceding Sunday evening,
that he and his partner had taken secure measures to prevent Florence from ever again setting
foot within the Newspaper Building. In addition, he was quite showered with definitions; and
these, though so various, all sought to phrase but the one subject: his conduct in seeking
to drag Florence into the mire, when she was absent and could not defend herself. Poor Florence
would answer later in the evening, he was told severely; and though her cause was thus championed
against the slander, it is true that some of her defenders felt stirrings of curiosity in regard
to Florence. In fact, there was getting to be something almost like a cloud upon her reputation.
There were several things for her to explain;--among them, her taking it upon herself to see
that Noble received a copy of the Oriole, and also her sudden departure from home and rather
odd protraction of absence therefrom. It was not thought she was in good company. Uncle Joseph
had telephoned from a suburb that they were dining at a farmhouse and would thence descend
to the general region of the movies.

"Nobody knows what that man'll do, when he decides to!" Aunt Carrie said nervously. "Letting
the poor child stay up so late! She ought to be in bed this minute, even if it is Saturday
night! If man lived up in the bushes, like the Chimpanzee and other apes, he would need more movable
ribs so that he might not be ruined by broken ribs every time he
might happen to fall.

Is there no evidence of design here?

* * * * *

All unbelievers who advocate the idea of spontaneous generation try to get more out of matter
than there was in it, viz: life, sensation, intelligence and moral
nature.

Can you get more out of a thing than there is in it? Is there life
without antecedent life, etc.? Unbeliever, are you mocking the Bible
because somebody said the Lord created something of nothing, and at
the same time advocating spontaneous generation, and thereby professing
to get more evolved than was involved? He had no indifference more profound than that upon which
her strained conception of the relation between cause and effect seemed to touch;--from his
point of view, to be missing should be the lightest of calamities. It is true that he was concerned
with the restoration of Noble Dill to the rest of the Dills so far as such an event might affect
his own incomparable misfortunes, but not otherwise. He regarded Noble and Noble's disappearance
merely as unfair damage to himself, and he continued to look at this sorrowing great-aunt of
his until his thoughts made his strange gaze appear to her so hardened that she shook her head
and looked away.

"Poor young Mr. Dill!" she said. "If someone could only have been with him and kept talking
to him until he got used to the idea a little!"

Cousin Virginia nodded comprehendingly. "Yes, it might have tided him over," she said. "He
wasn't handsome, nor impressive, of course, nor anything like that, but he always spoke so
nicely to people on the street. I'm sure he never harmed even a kitten, poor soul!"

"I'm sure he never did," Herbert's mother agreed gently. "Not even a kitten. I do wonder where
he is now."

But Aunt Fanny uttered a little cry of protest. "I'm afraid we may hear!" she said. "Any moment!"

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

These sympathetic women had unanimously set their expectation in so romantically pessimistic
a groove that the most tragic news of Noble would have surprised them little. But if the truth
of his whereabouts could have been made known to them, as they sat thus together at what was
developing virtually into his wake, with Herbert as a compulsory participant, they would have
turned the session into a riot of amazement. Noble was in the very last place (they would have
said, when calmer) where anybody in the world could have even madly dreamed of looking for
him! They would have been right about it. No one could have expected to find Noble to-night
inside the old, four-square brick house of H. I. Atwater, Senior, chief of the Atwaters and
father of too gentle Julia. Moreover, Mr. Atwater himself was not at present in the house;
he had closed and locked it the day before, giving the servants a week's vacation and telling
them not to return till he sent for them; and he had then gone out of town to look over a hominy-mill
he thought of buying. And yet, as the wake went on, there was a light in the house, and under
that light sat Noble Dill.

Returning home, after Florence had placed the shattering paper within his hand, Noble had changed
his shoes and his tie. He was but a mechanism; he had no motive. The shoes he put on were no
better than those he took off; the fresh tie was no lovelier than the one he had worn; nor
had it even the lucidity to be a purple one, as the banner of grief. No; his action was, if
so viewed, "crazy," as Aunt Fanny had called it. Agitation first took this form; that was all.
Love and change of dress are so closely allied; and in happier days, when Noble had come home
from work and would see Julia in the evening, he usually changed his clothes. No doubt there
is some faint tracery here, probably too indistinct to repay contemplation.

When he left the house he walked rapidly downtown, and toward the end of this one-mile journey
he ran; but as he was then approaching the railway station, no one thought him eccentric. He
was, however, for when he entered the station he went to a bench and sat looking upward for
more than ten minutes before he rose, went to a ticket window and asked for a time-table.

"What road?" the clerk inquired.

"All points South," said Noble.

He placed the time-table, still folded, in his pocket, rested an elbow on the brass apron of
the window, and would have given himself up to reflections, though urged to move away. Several
people, wishing to buy tickets, had formed a line behind him; they perceived that Noble had
nothing more to say to the clerk, and the latter encouraged their protests, even going so far
as to inquire: "For heaven's sakes, can't you let these folk buy their tickets?" And since
Noble still did not move: "My gosh, haven't you got no feet?"

"Feet? Oh, yes," said Noble gently. "I'm going away." And went back to his seat.

Afterwhile, he sought to study his time-table. Ordinarily, his mind was one of those able to
decipher and comprehend railway time-tables; he had few gifts, but this was one of them. It
failed him now; so he wandered back to the ticket-window, and, after urgent coaching, eventually
took his place at the end instead of at the head of the line that waited there. In his turn
he came again to the window, and departed from it after a conversation with the clerk that
left the latter in accord with Aunt Fanny Atwater's commiserating adjective, though the clerk's
own pity was expressed in argot. "The poor nut!" he explained to his next client. "Wants to
buy a ticket on a train that don't pull out until ten thirty-five to-night; and me fillin'
it all out, stampin' it and everything, what for? Turned out all his pockets and couldn't come
within eight dollars o' the price! Where you want to go?"

Noble went back to his bench and sat there for a long time, though there was no time, long
or short, for him. He was not yet consciously suffering; nor was he thinking at all. True,
he had a dim, persistent impulse to action--or why should he be at the station?--but for the
clearest expression of his condition it is necessary to borrow a culinary symbol; he was jelling.
But the state of shock was slowly dispersing, while a perception of approaching anguish as
slowly increased. He was beginning to swallow nothing at intervals and the intervals were growing
shorter.

Dusk was misting down, outdoors, when with dragging steps he came out of the station. He looked
hazily up and down the street, where the corner-lamps and shop-windows now were lighted; and,
after dreary hesitation, he went in search of a pawn-shop, and found one. The old man who operated
it must have been a philanthropist, for Noble was so fortunate as to secure a loan of nine
dollars upon his watch. Surprised at this, he returned to the station, and went back to the
same old bench.

It was fully occupied, and he stood for some time looking with vague reproach at the large
family of coloured people who had taken it. He had a feeling that he lived there and that these
coloured people were trespassers; but upon becoming aware that part of an orange was being
rubbed over his left shoe by the youngest of the children, he groaned abruptly and found another
bench.

A little after six o'clock a clanging and commotion in the train-shed outside, attending the
arrival of a "through express," stirred him from his torpor, and he walked heavily across the
room to the same ticket-window he had twice blocked; but there was no queue attached to it
now. He rested his elbow upon the apron and his chin upon his hand, while the clerk waited
until he should state his wishes. This was a new clerk, who had just relieved the other.

"Well! Well!" he said at last.

"I'll take it now," Noble responded.

"What'll you take now?"

"That ticket."

"What ticket?"

"The same one I wanted before," Noble sighed.

The clerk gave him a piercing look, glanced out of the window and saw that there were no other
clients, then went to a desk at the farther end of his compartment, and took up some clerical
work he had in hand.

Noble leaned upon the apron of the window, waiting; and if he thought anything, he thought
the man was serving him.

The high, vaulted room became resonant with voices and the blurred echoes of mingling footsteps
on the marble floor, as passengers from the express hurried anxiously to the street, or more
gaily straggled through, shouting with friends who came to greet them; and among these moving
groups there walked a youthful fine lady noticeably enlivening to the dullest eye. I always
regretted that I was not able to examine the great craters on Albemarle Island, one of the Galapagos.
In New Zealand urge on them to look out for erratic boulders and marks of old glaciers.

Urge the use of the dredge in the Tropics; how little or nothing we know of the limit of life
downward in the hot seas?

My present work leads me to perceive how much the domestic animals have been neglected in out of the
way countries.

The Revillagigedo Island off Mexico, I believe, has never been trodden by foot of naturalist.

If the expedition sticks to such places as Rio, Cape of Good Hope,
Ceylon and Australia, etc., it will not do much.

Ever yours most truly, C. DARWIN.

[The following passage occurs in a letter to Mr. Fox, February 22, 1857, and has reference
to the book on Evolution on which he was still at work. The remainder of the letter is made
up in details of no interest:

"I am got most deeply interested in my subject; though I wish I could
set less value on the bauble fame, either present or posthumous, than
I do, but not I think, to any extreme degree: yet, if I know myself,
I would work just as hard, though with less gusto, if I knew that
my book would be published for ever anonymously."]

CHARLES DARWIN
TO A.R. WALLACE.

Moor Park, May 1st, 1857.

My dear Sir,

I am much obliged for your letter of October 10th, from Celebes, received
a few days ago; in a laborious undertaking, sympathy is a valuable
and real encouragement.

By your letter and even still more by your paper ('On the law that has regulated the introduction
of new species.'--Ann.

Nat. Hist., 1855.) in the Annals, a year or more ago, I can plainly see that we have thought
much alike and to a certain extent have come to similar conclusions. In regard to the Paper in
the Annals, I agree to the truth of almost every word of your paper;
and I dare say that you will agree with me that it is very rare to
find oneself agreeing pretty closely with any theoretical paper; for
it is lamentable how each man draws his own different conclusions
from the very same facts.

This summer will make the 20th year (!) since I opened my first note-book, on the question how
and in what way do species and varieties differ from each other.

I am now preparing my work for publication, but I find the subject so very large, that though
I have written many chapters, I do not suppose I shall go to press for two years. I have never
heard how long you intend staying in the Malay Archipelago; I wish I might profit by the publication
of your Travels there before my work appears, for no doubt you will reap a large harvest of
facts.

I have acted already in accordance with your advice of keeping domestic
varieties, and those appearing in a state of nature, distinct; but
I have sometimes doubted of the wisdom of this, and therefore I am
glad to be backed by your opinion.

I must confess, however, I rather doubt the truth of the now very prevalent doctrine of all
our domestic animals having descended from several wild stocks; though I do not doubt that
it is so in some cases. I think there is rather better evidence on the sterility of hybrid animals
than you seem to admit: and in regard to plants the collection of
carefully recorded facts by Kolreuter and Gaertner (and Herbert,)
is ENORMOUS.

I most entirely agree with you on the little effects of "climatal conditions," which one sees
referred to ad nauseam in all books: I suppose some very little effect
must be attributed to such influences, but I fully believe that they
are very slight. Now she went cheerily on: "Perhaps not, as you don't answer.
I shouldn't be so bold! Do you suppose anybody at all will be glad to see me?"

"I--I----" He seemed to hope that words would come in their own good time.

"Noble!" she cried. "Don't be so glum!" And she touched his arm with her muff, a fluffy contact
causing within him a short convulsion, naturally invisible. "Noble, aren't you going to tell
me what's all the news?"

"There's--some," he managed to inform her. "Some--some news."

"What is it?"

"It's--it's----"

"Never mind," she said soothingly. "Get your breath; I can wait. I hope nothing's wrong in
your family, Noble."

"No. Oh, no."

"It isn't just my turning up unexpectedly that's upset you so, of course," she dared to say.
"Naturally, I know better than to think such a thing as that."

"Oh, Julia!" he said. "Oh, Julia!"

"What is it, Noble?"

"Noth-ing," he murmured, disjointing the word.

"How odd you happened to be there at the station," she said, "just when my train came in! You're
sure you weren't going away anywhere?"

"No; oh, no."

She was thoughtful, then laughed confidentially. "You're the only person in town that knows
I'm home, Noble."

"I'm glad," he said humbly.

She laughed again. "I came all of a sudden--on an impulse. It's a little idiotic. I'll tell
you all about it, Noble. You see, ten or twelve days ago I wrote the family a more or less
indiscreet letter. That is, I told them something I wanted them to be discreet about, and,
of course, when I got to thinking it over, I knew they wouldn't. You see, I wrote them something
I wanted them to keep a secret, but the more I thought about it, the more I saw I'd better
hurry back. Yesterday it got into my head that I'd better jump on the next train for home!"

She paused, then added, "So I did! About ten or twelve days is as long as anybody has a right
to expect the Atwater family connection to keep the deadliest kind of a secret, isn't it?"
And as he did not respond, she explained, modestly, "Of course, it wasn't a very deadly secret;
it was really about something of only the least importance."

The jar of this understatement restored Noble's voice to a sudden and startling loudness. "'Only
the least importance'!" he shouted. "With a man named Crum!"

"What!" she cried

"Crum!" Noble insisted. "That's exactly what it said his name was!"

"What said his name was?"

"The North End Daily Oriole!"

"What in heaven's name is that?"

"It's the children's paper, Herbert's and Florence's: your own niece and nephew, Julia! You
don't mean you deny it, do you, Julia?"

She was in great confusion: "Do I deny what?"

"That his name's Crum!" Noble said passionately. "That his name's Crum and that he's a widower
and he's been divorced and's got nobody knows how many children!"

Julia sought to collect herself. "I don't know what you're talking about," she said. "If you
mean that I happened to meet a very charming man while I was away, and that his name happened
to be Crum, I don't know why I should go to the trouble of denying it. But if Mr. Crum has
had the experiences you say he has, it is certainly news to me! I think someone told me he
was only twenty-six years old. He looked rather younger."

"You 'think someone told' you!" Noble groaned. "Oh, Julia! And here it is, all down in black
and white, in my pocket!"

"I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about." Julia's tone was cold, and she drew
herself up haughtily, though the gesture was ineffective in the darkness of that quivering
interior. The quivering stopped just then, however, as the taxicab came to a rather abrupt
halt before her house. 

I then asked him how they grew in common years and how on leap-years, but soon found that he knew
absolutely nothing of how they grew at any time, but he stuck to his belief.

After a time I heard from my first informant, who, with many apologies,
said that he should not have written to me had he not heard the statement
from several intelligent farmers; but that he had since spoken again
to every one of them, and not one knew in the least what he had himself
meant.

So that here a belief--if indeed a statement with no definite idea attached to it can be called
a belief--had spread over almost the whole of England without any vestige of evidence.

I have known in the course of my life only three intentionally falsified statements, and one of these
may have been a hoax (and there have been several scientific hoaxes)
which, however, took in an American Agricultural Journal.

It related to the formation in Holland of a new breed of oxen by
the crossing of distinct species of Bos (some of which I happen to
know are sterile together), and the author had the impudence to state
that he had corresponded with me, and that I had been deeply impressed
with the importance of his result.

The article was sent to me by the editor of an English Agricultural Journal, asking for my
opinion before republishing it.

A second case was an account of several varieties, raised by the author from several species of
Primula, which had spontaneously yielded a full complement of seed, although the parent plants
had been carefully protected from the access of insects. This account was published before I
had discovered the meaning of heterostylism, and the whole statement
must have been fraudulent, or there was neglect in excluding insects
so gross as to be scarcely credible.

The third case was more curious: Mr. Huth published in his book on 'Consanguineous Marriage' some long
extracts from a Belgian author, who stated that he had interbred rabbits in the closest manner
for very many generations, without the least injurious effects. The account was published in
a most respectable Journal, that of the Royal Society of Belgium; but I could not avoid feeling
doubts--I hardly know why, except that there were no accidents of
any kind, and my experience in breeding animals made me think this
very improbable.

 Thus, seeing Julia again was always a discovery. And this glance over her shoulder
as she left a room--not a honeyed glance but rather inscrutable, yet implying that she thought
of the occupant, and might continue to think of him while gone from him--this was one of those
ways of hers that experience could never drill out of her.

"I'm Robinson Crusoe, Noble," she said, when she came back. "I suppose I might as well take
off my furs, though." But first she unfastened the great bouquet she wore and tossed it upon
a table. Noble was standing close to the table, and he moved away from it hurriedly--a revulsion
that she failed to notice. She went on to explain, as she dropped her cloak and stole upon
a chair: "Papa's gone away for at least a week. He's taken his ulster. It doesn't make any
difference what the weather is, but when he's going away for a week or longer, he always takes
it with him, except in summer. If he's only going to be gone two or three days he takes his
short overcoat. And unless I'm here when he leaves town he always gives the servants a holiday
till he gets back; so they've gone and even taken Gamin with 'em, and I'm all alone in the
house. I can't get even Kitty Silver back until to-morrow, and then I'll probably have to hunt
from house to house among her relatives. Papa left yesterday, because the numbers on his desk
calender are pulled off up to to-day, and that's the first thing he does when he comes down
for breakfast. So here I am, Robinson Crusoe for to-night at least."

"I suppose," said Noble huskily, "I suppose you'll go to some of your aunts or brothers or
cousins or something."

"No," she said. "My trunk may come up from the station almost any time, and if I close the
house they'll take it back."

"You needn't bother about that, Julia. I'll look after it."

"How?"

"I could sit on the porch till it comes," he said. "I'd tell 'em you wanted 'em to leave it."
He hesitated, painfully. "I--if you want to lock up the house I--I could wait out on the porch
with your trunk, to see that it was safe, until you come back to-morrow morning."

She looked full at him, and he plaintively endured the examination.

"Noble!" Undoubtedly she had a moment's shame that any creature should come to such a pass
for her sake. "What crazy nonsense!" she said; and sat upon a stool before the crackling fire.
"Do sit down, Noble--unless your dinner will be waiting for you at home?"

"No," he murmured. "They never wait for me. Don't you want me to look after your trunk?"

"Not by sitting all night with it on the porch!" she said. "I'm going to stay here myself.
I'm not going out; I don't want to see any of the family to-night."

"I thought you said you were hungry?"

"I am; but there's enough in the pantry. I looked."

"Well, if you don't want to see any of 'em," he suggested, "and they know your father's away
and think the house is empty, they're liable to notice the lights and come in, and then you'd
have to see 'em."

"No, you can't see the lights of this room from the street, and I lit the lamp at the other
end of the hall. The light near the front door," Julia added, "I put out."

"You did?"

"I can't see any of 'em to-night," she said resolutely. "Besides, I want to find out what you
meant by what you said in the taxicab before I do anything else."

"What I meant in the taxicab?" he echoed. "Oh, Julia! Julia!"

She frowned, first at the fire, then, turning her head, at Noble. "You seem to feel reproachful
about something," she observed.

"No, I don't. I don't feel reproachful, Julia. I don't know what I feel, but I don't feel reproachful."

She smiled faintly. "Don't you? Well, there's something perhaps you do feel, and that's hungry.
Will you stay to dinner with me--if I go and get it?"

"What?"

"You can have dinner with me--if you want to? You can stay till ten o'clock--if you want to?
Wait!" she said, and jumped up and ran out of the room.

Half an hour later she came back and called softly to him from the doorway; and he followed
her to the dining-room.

"It isn't much of a dinner, Noble," she said, a little tremulously, being for once (though
strictly as a cook) genuinely apologetic;--but the scrambled eggs, cold lamb, salad, and coffee
were quite as "much of a dinner" as Noble wanted. To him everything on that table was hallowed,
yet excruciating.

"Let's eat first and talk afterward," Julia proposed; but what she meant by "talk" evidently
did not exclude interchange of information regarding weather and the health of acquaintances,
for she spoke freely upon these subjects, while Noble murmured in response and swallowed a
little of the sacred food, but more often swallowed nothing. Bitterest of all was his thought
of what this unexampled seclusion with Julia could have meant to him, were those poisonous
violets not at her waist--for she had put them on again--and were there no Crum in the South.
Without these fatal obstructions, the present moment would have been to him a bit of what he
often thought of as "dream life"; but all its sweetness was a hurt.

"Now we'll talk!" said Julia, when she had brought him back to the library fire again, and
they were seated before it. "Don't you want to smoke?" He shook his head dismally, having no
heart for what she proposed. "Well, then," she said briskly, but a little ruefully, "let's
get to the bottom of things. Just what did you mean you had 'in black and white' in your pocket?"

Slowly Noble drew forth the historic copy of The North End Daily Oriole; and with face averted,
placed it in her extended hand.

"What in the world!" she exclaimed, unfolding it; and then as its title and statement of ownership
came into view, "Oh, yes! I see. Aunt Carrie wrote me that Uncle Joseph had given Herbert a
printing-press. I suppose Herbert's the editor?"

"And that Rooter boy," Noble said sadly. "I think maybe your little niece Florence has something
to do with it, too." 

I find to my great surprise that a ship is singularly comfortable for all sorts of work. Everything
is so close at hand, and being cramped makes one so methodical, that
in the end I have been a gainer.

I already have got to look at going to sea as a regular quiet place,
like going back to home after staying away from it.

In short, I find a ship a very comfortable house, with everything you want, and if it was not
for sea-sickness the whole world would be sailors.

I do not think there is much danger of Erasmus setting the example,
but in case there should be, he may rely upon it he does not know
one-tenth of the sufferings of sea-sickness.

I like the officers much more than I did at first, especially Wickham,
and young King and Stokes, and indeed all of them.

 "I mean
this dreadful story about poor Mr. Crum!"

"But it's true," he said.

"Noble Dill!"

"Julia?"

"Do you dare to say you believed it?"

He sprang up. "It isn't true?"

"Not one word of it! I told you Mr. Crum is only twenty-six. He hasn't been out of college
more than three or four years, and it's the most terrible slander to say he's ever been married
at all!"

Noble dropped back into his chair of misery. "I thought you meant it wasn't true."

"I've just told you there isn't one word of tr----"

"But you're--engaged," Noble gulped. "You're engaged to him, Julia!"

She appeared not to hear this. "I suppose it can be lived down," she said. "To think of Uncle
Joseph putting such a thing into the hands of those awful children!"

"But, Julia, you're eng----"

"Noble!" she said sharply.

"Well, you are eng----"

Julia drew herself up. "Different people mean different things by that word," she said with
severity, like an annoyed school-teacher. "There are any number of shades of meaning to words;
and if I used the word you mention, in writing home to the family, I may have used a certain
shade and they may have thought I intended another."

"But, Julia----"

"Mr. Crum is a charming young man," she continued with the same primness. "I liked him very
much indeed. I liked him very, very much. I liked him very, very----"

"I understand," he interrupted. "Don't say it any more, Julia."

"No; you don't understand! At first I liked him very much--in fact, I still do, of course--I'm
sure he's one of the best and most attractive young men in the world. I think he's a man any
girl ought to be happy with, if he were only to be considered by himself. I don't deny that.
I liked him very much indeed, and I don't deny that for several days after he--after he proposed
to me--I don't deny I thought something serious might come of it. But at that time, Noble,
I hadn't--hadn't really thought of what it meant to give up living here at home, with all the
family and everything--and friends--friends like you, Noble. I hadn't thought what it would
mean to me to give all this up. And besides, there was something very important. At the time
I wrote that letter mentioning poor Mr. Crum to the family, Noble, I hadn't--I hadn't----"
She paused, visibly in some distress. "I hadn't----"

"You hadn't what?" he cried.

"I hadn't met his mother!" 

But I shall now in a day or two begin to look over my old notes on
species.

What a deal I shall have to discuss with you; I shall have to look
sharp that I do not 'progress' into one of the greatest bores in life,
to the few like you with lots of knowledge."]

CHAPTER 1.X.

THE GROWTH
OF THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES.'

[The growth of the 'Origin of Species'
has been briefly described in my father's words (above).

The letters given in the present and following chapters will illustrate and amplify the history
thus sketched out.

It is clear that in the early part of the voyage of the "Beagle" he
did not feel it inconsistent with his views to express himself in
thoroughly orthodox language as to the genesis of new species.

Thus in 1834 he wrote (MS. Journals, page 468.) at Valparaiso: "I
have already found beds of recent shells yet retaining their colour
at an elevation of 1300 feet, and beneath, the level country is strewn
with them.

It seems not a very improbable conjecture that the want of animals may be owing to none having
been created since this country was raised from the sea."

This passage does not occur in the published 'Journal,' the last proof
of which was finished in 1837; and this fact harmonizes with the change
we know to have been proceeding in his views.

But in the published 'Journal' we find passages which show a point of view more in accordance
with orthodox theological natural history than with his later views. Thus, in speaking of the
birds Synallaxis and Scytalopus (1st edition page 353; 2nd edition page 289), he says: "When
finding, as in this case, any animal which seems to play so insignificant a part in the great
scheme of nature, one is apt to wonder why a distinct species should
have been created."

A comparison of the two editions of the 'Journal' is instructive,
as giving some idea of the development of his views on evolution.

 He appeared to be
in a torment of tormenting; and his success was proved by the pounding of bricks, parts of
bricks and rocks of size upon the other side of the fence, as close to the crack as might be.

"Oh, dolling!" he wailed, his tone poisonously amorous. "Oh, dolling Henery! Oo's dot de mos'
booful eyes in a dray bid nasty world. Henery! Oh, has I dot booful eyes, dolling Pattywatty?
Yes, I has! I has dot pretty eyes!" His voice rose unbearably. "Oh, what prettiest eyes I dot!
Me and Herbie Atwater! Oh, my booful eyes! Oh, my booful----"

But even as he reached this apex, the head, shoulders, and arms of Herbert Atwater rose momentarily
above the fence across the alley, behind the tormentor. Herbert's expression was implacably
resentful, and so was the gesture with which he hurled an object at the comedian preoccupied
with the opposite fence. This object, upon reaching its goal, as it did more with a splash
than a thud, was revealed as a tomato, presumably in a useless state. The taunter screamed
in astonishment, and after looking vainly for an assailant, began necessarily to remove his coat.

Noble, passing on, thought he recognized the boy as one of the Torbin family, but he was not
sure, and he had no idea that the episode was in any possible manner to be connected with his
own recent history. How blindly we walk our ways! As Noble flourished down the street, there
appeared a wan face at a prison window; and the large eyes looked out upon him wistfully. But
Noble went on, as unwitting that he had to do with this prison as that he had to do with Master
Torbin's tomato.

The face at the window was not like Charlotte Corday's, nor was the window barred, though the
prisoner knew a little solace in wondering if she did not suggest that famous picture. For
all purposes, except during school hours, the room was certainly a cell; and the term of imprisonment
was set at three days. Uncle Joseph had been unable to remain at the movies forever: people
do have to go home eventually, especially when accompanied by thirteen-year-old great-nieces.
Florence had finally to face the question awaiting her; and it would have been better for her
had she used less imagination in her replies.

Yet she was not wholly despondent as her eyes followed the disappearing figure of Noble Dill.
His wholesome sprightliness was visible at any distance; and who would not take a little pride
in having been even the mistaken instrument of saving so gay a young man from the loss of his
reason? No; Florence was not cast down. Day-after-to-morrow she would taste Freedom again,
and her profoundest regret was that after all her Aunt Julia was not to be married. Florence
had made definite plans for the wedding, especially for the principal figure at the ceremony.
This figure, as Florence saw things, would have been that of the "Flower Girl," naturally a
niece of the bride; but she was able to dismiss the bright dream with some philosophy. And
to console her for everything, had she not a star in her soul? Had she not discovered that
she could write poetry whenever she felt like it?

Noble passed from her sight, but nevertheless continued his radiant progress down Julia's Street.
Life stretched before him, serene, ineffably fragrant, unending. He saw it as a flower-strewn
sequence of calls upon Julia, walks with Julia, talks with Julia by the library fire. Old Mr.
Atwater was to be away four days longer, and Julia, that great-hearted bride-not-to-be, had
given him her promise.

Blushing, indeed divinely, she had promised him upon her sacred word, never so long as she
lived, to be engaged to anybody at all.
