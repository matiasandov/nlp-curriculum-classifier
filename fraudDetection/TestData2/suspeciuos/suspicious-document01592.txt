NINA BALATKA

by

ANTHONY TROLLOPE

INTRODUCTION

Anthony Trollope was an established novelist of great renown when Nina Balatka was published
in 1866, twenty years after his first novel. Except for La Vendee, his third novel, set in
France during the Revolution, all his previous works were set in England or Ireland and dealt
with the upper levels of society: the nobility and the landed gentry (wealthy or impoverished),
and a few well-to-do merchants--people several strata above the social levels of the characters
popularized by his contemporary Dickens. Most of Trollope's early novels were set in the countryside
or in provincial towns, with occasional forays into London. The first of his political novels,
Can You Forgive Her, dealing with the Pallisers was published in 1864, two years before Nina.
By the time he began writing Nina, shortly after a tour of Europe, Trollope was a master at
chronicling the habits, foibles, customs, and ways of life of his chosen subjects.

Nina Balatka is, on the surface, a love story--not an unusual theme for Trollope. Romance and
courtship were woven throughout all his previous works, often with two, three, or even more
pairs of lovers per novel. Most of his heroes and heroines, after facing numerous hurdles,
often of their own making, were eventually happily united by the next-to-last chapter. A few
were doomed to disappointment (Johnny Eames never won the heart of Lily Dale through two of
the "Barsetshire" novels), but marital bliss--or at least the prospect of bliss--was the usual
outcome. Even so, the reader of Trollope soon notices his analytical description of Victorian
courtship and marriage. In the circles of Trollope's characters, only the wealthy could afford
to marry for love; those without wealth had to marry for money, sometimes with disastrous consequences.
By the time of Nina, Trollope's best exploration of this subject was the marriage between Plantagenet
Palliser and Lady Glencora M'Cluskie, the former a cold fish and the latter a hot-blooded heiress
in love with a penniless scoundrel (Can You Forgive Her? 1865). 

CHAPTER XIII

Bathroom # #

When you feel love in the gutter, does not produce enough satisfaction
the look, study and walk along its banks, he feels the need for greater
intimacy with him, diving into waters.

Like our ancestors, we become newts.

But this is not always easy, and during the winter when cold air whistling through the branches,
when snow covers the ground or surface water in the glass sheets are formed, are few very active
men who dare to swim in the icy water. Contact with tap water can
indeed force those who are not afraid to rub elbows with it; however,
before the ceremony bath we often seems uniquely dangerous. Anton is rather cold as lovers go, seldom whispering words of endearment to Nina. But
it is the fourth difference which really sets this novel apart and makes it both a masterpiece
and an enigma. That fourth--and most important--difference is clearly stated in the remarkable
opening sentence of the novel:

     Nina Balatka was a maiden of Prague, born of Christian parents,
     and herself a Christian--but she loved a Jew; and this is her
     story.

Marriage--even worse, love--between a Christian and a Jew would have been unacceptable to Victorian
British readers. Blatant anti-semitism was prevalent--perhaps ubiquitous--among the upper classes.

Let us consider the origins of this anti-semitism. Jews were first allowed into England by
William the Conqueror. For a while they prospered, largely through money-lending, an occupation
to which they were restricted. In the 13th century a series of increasingly oppressive laws
and taxes reduced the Jewish community to poverty, and the Jews were expelled from England
in 1290. They were not allowed to return until 1656, when Oliver Cromwell authorized their
entry over the objections of British merchants. Legal protection for the Jews increased gradually;
even the "Act for the More Effectual Suppressing of Blasphemy and Profaneness" (1698) recognized
the practice of Judaism as legal, but there were probably only a few hundred Jews in the entire
country. The British Jewish community grew gradually, and efforts to emancipate the Jews were
included in various "Reform Acts" in the first half of the 19th century, although many failed
to become law. Gradually Jews were admitted to the bar and other professions. Full citizenship
and rights, including the right to sit in Parliament, were granted in 1858--only seven years
before Trollope began writing Nina Balatka. By this time wealthy Jewish families were growing
in number. This upward mobility and increasing economic and political power no doubt made the
British upper classes envious and resentful, fuelling anti-semitism.

Trollope chose to have Nina published anonymously in Blackwood's Magazine for reasons which
he described in his autobiography:

     From the commencement of my success as a writer . . . [1]

Why did Trollope start his "new" career with a novel whose central theme was a subject of distaste
at best--more likely revulsion--to the vast majority of the reading public? Perhaps the nature
of the novel itself led him to consider publishing it anonymously, although we know he was
not averse to controversial subjects. In his first book, The Macdermots of Ballycloran, which
he thought had the best plot of all his novels, the principal female character is seduced by
a scoundrel and dies giving birth to an illegitimate child.

Certainly Nina was well-suited for the experiment because of it's different setting and subject
matter. Perhaps further to disguise his authorship, Trollope wrote Nina in a style of prose
that reads almost like a translation from a foreign language.

The experiment did not last long enough to test Trollope's hypothesis. Mr. Hutton, critic for
the Spectator, recognized Trollope as the author and so stated in his review. Trollope did
not deny the accusation.

One cannot discuss Nina Balatka without addressing the question, was Trollope himself anti-semitic?
A careful reading of his works does not provide a clear answer. Jews appear in some of his
books and are referred to in others, often as disreputable characters or money-lenders. They
are seldom mentioned by his Christian characters with respect, probably realistically reflecting
the sentiments of the classes he wrote about. Some of his greatest villains in his later novels--Melmotte
in The Way We Live Now (1875) and Lopez in The Prime Minister (1876)--are rumored to be Jewish,
but Trollope never unequivocally identifies them as Jewish. Perhaps his Christian characters
expect them to be Jewish because they are foreigners and villains.

However, if one ignores the dialogue of his characters, even the descriptive and editorial
comments by Trollope himself at first seem anti-semitic. He consistently uses "Jew" as a pejorative
adjective instead of "Jewish." His descriptions of the appearance of Jewish characters are
usually unflattering and stereotypical. Even Anton Trendellsohn, the hero of Nina Balatka,
is described as follows:

     To those who know the outward types of his race there could be no
     doubt that Anton Trendellsohn was a very Jew among Jews. He was
     certainly a handsome man, not now very young, having reached some
     year certainly in advance of thirty, and his face was full of
     intellect. He was slightly made, below the middle height, but was
     well made in every limb, with small feet and hands, and small
     ears, and a well-turned neck. He was very dark--dark as a man can
     be, and yet show no sign of colour in his blood. No white man
     could be more dark and swarthy than Anton Trendellsohn. His eyes,
     however, which were quite black, were very bright. His jet-black
     hair, as it clustered round his ears, had in it something of a
     curl. Had it been allowed to grow, it would almost have hung in
     ringlets; but it was worn very short, as though its owner were
     jealous even of the curl. Anton Trendellsohn was decidedly a
     handsome man; but his eyes were somewhat too close together in his
     face, and the bridge of his aquiline nose was not sharply cut, as
     is mostly the case with such a nose on a Christian face. The olive
     oval face was without doubt the face of a Jew, and the mouth was
     greedy, and the teeth were perfect and bright, and the movement of
     the man's body was the movement of a Jew.

This is not the typical description of the romantic hero of a Victorian novel. Even so, Trollope's
description of Anton is less derogatory than his description of Ezekiel Brehgert, a character
in a later novel, The Way We Live Now:

     He was a fat, greasy man, good-looking in a certain degree, about
     fifty, with hair dyed black, and beard and moustache dyed a dark
     purple colour. The charm of his face consisted in a pair of very
     bright black eyes, which were, however, set too near together in
     his face for the general delight of Christians. He was stout fat
     all over rather than corpulent and had that look of command in his
     face which has become common to master-butchers, probably by long
     intercourse with sheep and oxen.

The case for Trollope being anti-semitic is harder to support, however, when one considers
the behavior of his Jewish characters. Brehgert, whose physical description above is stereotypic,
is one of the few characters in The Way We Live Now whose actions are completely honorable.
Trollope wrote 16 novels before Nina Balatka; only two of those contain Jewish characters.
The first, who plays a minor role in Orley Farm (1862), is Soloman Aram, an attorney--a Victorian
Rumpole --known for defending the accused at the Old Bailey. His skill is needed to defend
Lady Mason against a charge of perjury, much to the distaste of her Christian advisors. He
acts with dignity and shows great consideration for the personal comfort of Lady Mason during
her trial. The second Jewish character in Trollope's novels was Mr. Hart, a London tailor who
runs for a seat in Parliament in Rachel Ray (1863). This served no purpose in the plot; the
situation probably was included because legislation to allow Jews to serve in Parliament had
been passed only five years before, and the issue was still one of public discussion. Mr. Hart's
appearance is brief; he speaks only one or two lines, and the reader is not told enough about
him to judge his character. Trollope describes him thus:

     . . . and then the Jewish hero, the tailor himself, came among
     them, and astonished their minds by the ease and volubility of his
     speeches. He did not pronounce his words with any of those soft
     slushy Judaic utterances by which they had been taught to believe
     he would disgrace himself. His nose was not hookey, with any
     especial hook, nor was it thicker at the bridge than was becoming.
     He was a dapper little man, with bright eyes, quick motion, ready
     tongue, and a very new hat. It seemed that he knew well how to
     canvass. He had a smile and a good word for all--enemies as well
     as friends.

In that novel, Trollope, himself, comments on prejudice and bigotry:

     . . . Mrs. Ray, in her quiet way, expressed much joy that Mr.
     Comfort's son-in-law should have been successful, and that
     Baslehurst should not have disgraced itself by any connection
     with a Jew. To her it had appeared monstrous that such a one
     should have been even permitted to show himself in the town as a
     candidate for its representation. To such she would have denied
     all civil rights, and almost all social rights. For a true spirit
     of persecution one should always go to a woman; and the milder,
     the sweeter, the more loving, the more womanly the woman, the
     stronger will be that spirit within her. Strong love for the thing
     loved necessitates strong hatred for the thing hated, and thence
     comes the spirit of persecution. They in England who are now
     keenest against the Jews, who would again take from them rights
     that they have lately won, are certainly those who think most of
     the faith of a Christian. The most deadly enemies of the Roman
     Catholics are they who love best their religion as Protestants.
     When we look to individuals we always find it so, though it
     hardly suits us to admit as much when we discuss these subjects
     broadly. To Mrs. Ray it was wonderful that a Jew should have been
     entertained in Baslehurst as a future member for the borough, and
     that he should have been admitted to speak aloud within a few
     yards of the church tower!

Nina Balatka presents a sharp contrast between the behaviors of the Jewish and Christian characters.
Nina and her father Josef Balatka live on the edge of poverty; he was cheated out of his business
by his Christian brother-in-law, who is now wealthy. Josef's only source of money was to sell
his house to Anton Trendellsohn's father, who for many years has allowed Josef and Nina to
remain in the house without paying any rent. Nina's Christian relatives use every form of deceit
in their attempt to turn Anton against Nina. Nina's Aunt Sophie spews invective in every direction.
She tells Nina, "Impudent girl!--brazen-faced, impudent, bad girl! Do you not know that you
would bring disgrace upon us all?" To Nina's father she says, "Tell me that at once, Josef,
that I may know. Has she your sanction for--for--for this accursed abomination?" To her husband
she says, "Oh, I hate them! I do hate them! Anything is fair against a Jew." And during a meeting
with Anton she exclaims, "How dares he come here to talk of his love? It is filthy--it is worse
than filthy--it is profane."

Anton's family also opposes the marriage, but Anton's father's behavior toward Nina is in sharp
contrast to that of her aunt:

     The old man's heart was softened towards her. He could not bring
     himself to say a word to her of direct encouragement, but he
     kissed her before she went, telling her that she was a good girl,
     and bidding her have no care as to the house in the Kleinseite. As
     long as he lived, and her father, her father should not be
     disturbed.

Anton, being more a businessman than a lover, at times behaves insensitively toward Nina. Otherwise,
throughout the novel, the Jewish characters act with honesty and kindness. Even the Jewish
maiden who wants to marry Anton does not scheme to break up his engagement to Nina but rather
befriends Nina and eventually saves her life. One has to wonder whether Trollope intended this
contrast to induce his readers to reconsider their prejudices. Consider his perception of his
duty as a writer:

     . . . [1]

Given Trollope's philosophy, it is reasonable to believe that the actions of his characters
should speak louder than their words. If so, Trollope might well have been holding up a mirror
to his audience that they might examine their own prejudices. Unfortunately, we shall never know.

Nina Balatka was the daughter of one Josef Balatka, an old merchant of Prague, who was living
at the time of this story; but Nina's mother was dead. Josef, in the course of his business,
had become closely connected with a certain Jew named Trendellsohn, who lived in a mean house
in the Jews' quarter in Prague--habitation in that one allotted portion of the town having
been the enforced custom with the Jews then, as it still is now. In business with Trendellsohn,
the father, there was Anton, his son; and Anton Trendellsohn was the Jew whom Nina Balatka
loved. Now it had so happened that Josef Balatka, Nina's father, had drifted out of a partnership
with Karil Zamenoy, a wealthy Christian merchant of Prague, and had drifted into a partnership
with Trendellsohn. How this had come to pass needs not to be told here, as it had all occurred
in years when Nina was an infant. But in these shiftings Balatka became a ruined man, and at
the time of which I write he and his daughter were almost penniless. The reader must know that
Karil Zamenoy and Josef Balatka had married sisters. Josef's wife, Nina's mother, had long
been dead, having died--so said Sophie Zamenoy, her sister--of a broken heart; of a heart that
had broken itself in grief, because her husband had joined his fortunes with those of a Jew.
Whether the disgrace of the alliance or its disastrous result may have broken the lady's heart,
or whether she may have died of a pleurisy, as the doctors said, we need not inquire here.
Her soul had been long at rest, and her spirit, we may hope, had ceased to fret itself in horror
at contact with a Jew. But Sophie Zamenoy was alive and strong, and could still hate a Jew
as intensely as Jews ever were hated in those earlier days in which hatred could satisfy itself
with persecution. In her time but little power was left to Madame Zamenoy to persecute the
Trendellsohns other than that which nature had given to her in the bitterness of her tongue.
She could revile them behind their back, or, if opportunity offered, to their faces; and both
she had done often, telling the world of Prague that the Trendellsohns had killed her sister,
and robbed her foolish brother-in-law. But hitherto the full vial of her wrath had not been
emptied, as it came to be emptied afterwards; for she had not yet learned the mad iniquity
of her niece. But at the moment of which I now speak, Nina herself knew her own iniquity, hardly
knowing, however, whether her love did or did not disgrace her. But she did know that any thought
as to that was too late. She loved the man, and had told him so; and were he gipsy as well
as Jew, it would be required of her that she should go out with him into the wilderness. And
Nina Balatka was prepared to go out into the wilderness. Karil Zamenoy and his wife were prosperous
people, and lived in a comfortable modern house in the New Town. It stood in a straight street,
and at the back of the house there ran another straight street. This part of the city is very
little like that old Prague, which may not be so comfortable, but which, of all cities on the
earth, is surely the most picturesque. Here lived Sophie Zamenoy; and so far up in the world
had she mounted, that she had a coach of her own in which to be drawn about the thoroughfares
of Prague and its suburbs, and a stout little pair of Bohemian horses--ponies they were called
by those who wished to detract somewhat from Madame Zamenoy's position. Madame Zamenoy had
been at Paris, and took much delight in telling her friends that the carriage also was Parisian;
but, in truth, it had come no further than from Dresden. Josef Balatka and his daughter were
very, very poor; but, poor as they were, they lived in a large house, which, at least nominally,
belonged to old Balatka himself, and which had been his residence in the days of his better
fortunes. It was in the Kleinseite, that narrow portion of the town, which lies on the other
side of the river Moldau--the further side, that is, from the so-called Old and New Town, on
the western side of the river, immediately under the great hill of the Hradschin. The Old Town
and the New Town are thus on one side of the river, and the Kleinseite and the Hradschin on
the other. To those who know Prague, it need not here be explained that the streets of the
Kleinseite are wonderful in their picturesque architecture, wonderful in their lights and shades,
wonderful in their strange mixture of shops and palaces-- and now, alas! also of Austrian barracks--and
wonderful in their intricacy and great steepness of ascent. Balatka's house stood in a small
courtyard near to the river, but altogether hidden from it, somewhat to the right of the main
street of the Kleinseite as you pass over the bridge. A lane, for it is little more, turning
from the main street between the side walls of what were once two palaces, comes suddenly into
a small square, and from a corner of this square there is an open stone archway leading into
a court. In this court is the door, or doors, as I may say, of the house in which Balatka lived
with his daughter Nina. Opposite to these two doors was the blind wall of another residence.
Balatka's house occupied two sides of the court, and no other window, therefore, besides his
own looked either upon it or upon him. The aspect of the place is such as to strike with wonder
a stranger to Prague--that in the heart of so large a city there should be an abode so sequestered,
so isolated, so desolate, and yet so close to the thickest throng of life. But there are others
such, perhaps many others such, in Prague; and Nina Balatka, who had been born there, thought
nothing of the quaintness of her abode. Immediately over the little square stood the palace
of the Hradschin, the wide-spreading residence of the old kings of Bohemia, now the habitation
of an ex- emperor of the House of Hapsburg, who must surely find the thousand chambers of the
royal mansion all too wide a retreat for the use of his old age. So immediately did the imperial
hill tower over the spot on which Balatka lived, that it would seem at night, when the moon
was shining as it shines only at Prague, that the colonnades of the palace were the upper storeys
of some enormous edifice, of which the broken merchant's small courtyard formed a lower portion.
The long rows of windows would glimmer in the sheen of the night, and Nina would stand in the
gloom of the archway counting them till they would seem to be uncountable, and wondering what
might be the thoughts of those who abode there. But those who abode there were few in number,
and their thoughts were hardly worthy of Nina's speculation. The windows of kings' palaces
look out from many chambers. The windows of the Hradschin look out, as we are told, from a
thousand. But the rooms within have seldom many tenants, nor the tenants, perhaps, many thoughts.
Chamber after chamber, you shall pass through them by the score, and know by signs unconsciously
recognised that there is not, and never has been, true habitation within them. Windows almost
innumerable are there, that they may be seen from the outside--and such is the use of palaces.
But Nina, as she would look, would people the rooms with throngs of bright inhabitants, and
would think of the joys of happy girls who were loved by Christian youths, and who could dare
to tell their friends of their love. The large island of the Camargue,
the edges are in the distance between the two Rhone, and has at least five hundred miles in area,
is in itself a present of the river that once was part of the mountains of Switzerland and Savoy
. Such is the current geological work, colossal work that continues unabated. However, the most profound
silence reigns around him. Sitting in the shade of a willow, will try in vain to feel the
buzz of the town of Arles, which is seen, with only his feet, Roman archways and Saracen towers.
The only sound is that of the locomotives and wagons that roll across the river making the ground
shudder. Were not visible, but distant thunder harmonizes well with the immensity of the Rhone, it
seems the voice of the River. We believe that the son of the sea, should have, like the ocean,
its eternal and formidable roar.

Below the bifurcation, the two rivers have long sinuous in its course. The waters released from
one to the other side bathe the foot of the last hill and reflect the towers of the latter
city. And the smoke rising from the houses to be confused with the distant haze, and the banks,
filled with golden bark trees, displayed no more than huts and half-hidden villas rare in the
vegetable. Finally, the last house left behind, and we would be completely alone if some obscure craft,
similar to large insects, not the river bogaran. The trees on the shore not happen so often and
are less high, a little lower and there is nothing but weeds, and then to the plants disappear:
there is no other vegetation than the canes on the ground still muddy
out over the water just earthy.

This site presents nature as it was for thousands of centuries before
the man moved into the banks of rivers and streams that feed it.

As in the days of pleriosauro, land and water are mixed in a chaos of mud banks, islands emerging
here and there, but just different water that bathes them shine like it and reflect the space
clouds. Liquid canvas stretching between these islands, but do not mix with the mud at the bottom:
they are more liquid mud mud from the banks. Everywhere you are surrounded by land in formation, and
yet, as we are already at sea, so beautiful is the place where we are. Is, in fact, the entire
space was covered with eyes once Tues The river has little to prune filling, but the floor, newly
formed, not yet claimed. Without huge drainage works are likely to ever be in a position to
be inhabited by men, because of its mud and stagnant water leak deadly
miasma.

Arrived at the towns that were once domains of sea, river, gradually content is becoming more widespread
and less deep. Finally, it approaches the sea and fresh water, quiet sliding, going to crash into the
foaming waves of salt water that is agitated with continuous noise.

In the clash of the liquid mass, the river water mixes quickly with the waves of the vast chasm,
but even after confused, still works. All the clouds of mud that had torn from their upper edges
and had even suspended, are rejected by the waves towards the river bed, not being able to
go further, are deposited on the bottom and form a sort of bastion serving Mobile temporal boundary
between the two elements in conflict. Love to her should be so sacred that no other sacredness should be
able to touch its sanctity. She had thought much of love, but had never loved before. Now she
loved, and, heart and soul, she belonged to him to whom she had devoted herself. Whatever suffering
might be before her, though it were suffering unto death, she would endure it if her lover
demanded such endurance. Hitherto, there was but one person who suspected her. In her father's
house there still remained an old dependant, who, though he was a man, was cook and housemaid,
and washer-woman and servant-of-all-work; or perhaps it would be more true to say that he and
Nina between them did all that the requirements of the house demanded. Souchey--for that was
his name--was very faithful, but with his fidelity had come a want of reverence towards his
master and mistress, and an absence of all respectful demeanour. The enjoyment of this apparent
independence by Souchey himself went far, perhaps, in lieu of wages.

"Nina," he said to her one morning, "you are seeing too much of Anton Trendellsohn."

"What do you mean by that, Souchey?" said the girl, sharply.

"You are seeing too much of Anton Trendellsohn," repeated the old man.

"I have to see him on father's account. You know that. You know that, Souchey, and you shouldn't
say such things."

"You are seeing too much of Anton Trendellsohn," said Souchey for the third time. "Anton Trendellsohn
is a Jew."

Then Nina knew that Souchey had read her secret, and was sure that it would spread from him
through Lotta Luxa, her aunt's confidential maid, up to her aunt's ears. Not that Souchey would
be untrue to her on behalf of Madame Zamenoy, whom he hated; but that he would think himself
bound by his religious duty--he who never went near priest or mass himself--to save his mistress
from the perils of the Jew. The story of her love must be told, and Nina preferred to tell
it herself to having it told for her by her servant Souchey. She must see Anton. When the evening
therefore had come, and there was sufficient dusk upon the bridge to allow of her passing over
without observation, she put her old cloak upon her shoulders, with the hood drawn over her
head, and, crossing the river, turned to the left and made her way through the narrow crooked
streets which led to the Jews' quarter. She knew the path well, and could have found it with
blindfolded eyes. In the middle of that close and densely populated region of Prague stands
the old Jewish synagogue--the oldest place of worship belonging to the Jews in Europe, as they
delight to tell you; and in a pinched-up, high-gabled house immediately behind the synagogue,
at the corner of two streets, each so narrow as hardly to admit a vehicle, dwelt the Trendellsohns.
On the basement floor there had once been a shop. There was no shop now, for the Trendellsohns
were rich, and no longer dealt in retail matters; but there had been no care, or perhaps no
ambition, at work, to alter the appearance of their residence, and the old shutters were upon
the window, making the house look as though it were deserted. There was a high-pitched sharp
roof over the gable, which, as the building stood alone fronting upon the synagogue, made it
so remarkable, that all who knew Prague well, knew the house in which the Trendellsohns lived.
Nina had often wished, as in latter days she had entered it, that it was less remarkable, so
that she might have gone in and out with smaller risk of observation. It was now the beginning
of September, and the clocks of the town had just struck eight as Nina put her hand on the
lock of the Jew's door. As usual it was not bolted, and she was able to enter without waiting
in the street for a servant to come to her. She went at once along the narrow passage and up
the gloomy wooden stairs, at the foot of which there hung a small lamp, giving just light enough
to expel the actual blackness of night. On the first landing Nina knocked at a door, and was
desired to enter by a soft female voice. The only occupant of the room when she entered was
a dark-haired child, some twelve years old perhaps, but small in stature and delicate, and,
as appeared to the eye, almost wan. "Well, Ruth dear," said Nina, "is Anton at home this evening?"

"He is up-stairs with grandfather, Nina. Shall I tell him?"

"If you will, dear," said Nina, stooping down and kissing her.

"Nice Nina, dear Nina, good Nina," said the girl, rubbing her glossy curls against her friend's
cheeks. "Ah, dear, how I wish you lived here!"

"But I have a father, as you have a grandfather, Ruth."

"And he is a Christian."

"And so am I, Ruth."

"But you like us, and are good, and nice, and dear--and oh, Nina, you are so beautiful! I wish
you were one of us, and lived here. There is Miriam Harter--her hair is as light as yours,
and her eyes are as grey."

"What has that to do with it?"

"Only I am so dark, and most of us are dark here in Prague. Anton says that away in Palestine
our girls are as fair as the girls in Saxony."

"And does not Anton like girls to be dark?"

"Anton likes fair hair--such as yours--and bright grey eyes such as you have got. I said they
were green, and he pulled my ears. But now I look, Nina, I think they are green. And so bright!
I can see my own in them, though it is so dark. That is what they call looking babies."

"Go to your uncle, Ruth, and tell him that I want him--on business."

"I will, and he'll come to you. He won't let me come down again, so kiss me, Nina; good-bye."

Nina kissed the child again, and then was left alone in the room. It was a comfortable chamber,
having in it sofas and arm-chairs--much more comfortable, Nina used to think, than her aunt's
grand drawing-room in the Windberg-gasse, which was covered all over with a carpet, after the
fashion of drawing-rooms in Paris; but the Jew's sitting-room was dark, with walls painted
a gloomy green colour, and there was but one small lamp of oil upon the table. But yet Nina
loved the room, and as she sat there waiting for her lover, she wished that it had been her
lot to have been born a Jewess. Only, had that been so, her hair might perhaps have been black,
and her eyes dark, and Anton would not have liked her. She put her hand up for a moment to
her rich brown tresses, and felt them as she took joy in thinking that Anton Trendellsohn loved
to look upon fair beauty.

After a short while Anton Trendellsohn came down. But not the less on that account had he behaved
with Christian forbearance to his Christian debtor, Josef Balatka, and with Christian chivalry
to Balatka's daughter, till that chivalry had turned itself into love.

"Nina," he said, putting out his hand, and holding hers as he spoke, "I hardly expected you
this evening; but I am glad to see you--very glad."

"I hope I am not troubling you, Anton?"

"How can you trouble me? The sun does not trouble us when we want light and heat."

"Can I give you light and heat?"

"The light and heat I love best, Nina."

"If I thought that--if I could really think that--I would be happy still, and would mind nothing."

"And what is it you do mind?"

"There are things to trouble us, of course. When aunt Sophie says that all of us have our troubles--even
she--I suppose that even she speaks the truth."

"Your aunt Sophie is a fool."

"I should not mind if she were only a fool. But a fool can sometimes be right."

"And she has been scolding you because--you--prefer a Jew to a Christian."

"No--not yet, Anton. She does not know it yet; but she must know it."

"Sit down, Nina." He was still holding her by the hand; and now, as he spoke, he led her to
a sofa which stood between the two windows. There he seated her, and sat by her side, still
holding her hand in his. "Yes," he said, "she must know it of course--when the time comes;
and if she guesses it before, you must put up with her guesses. A few sharp words from a foolish
woman will not frighten you, I hope."

"No words will frighten me out of my love, if you mean that--neither words nor anything else."

"I believe you. You are brave, Nina. I know that. Though you will cry if one but frowns at
you, yet you are brave."

"Do not you frown at me, Anton."

"I am one of those that do frown at times, I suppose; but I will be true to you, Nina, if you
will be true to me."

"I will be true to you--true as the sun."

As she made her promise she turned her sweet face up to his, and he leaned over her, and kissed
her.

"And what is it that has disturbed you now, Nina? What has Madame Zamenoy said to you?"

"She has said nothing--as yet. She suspects nothing--as yet."

"Then let her remain as she is."

"But, Anton, Souchey knows, and he will talk."

"Souchey! And do you care for that?"

"I care for nothing--for nothing; for nothing, that is, in the way of preventing me. Do what
they will, they cannot tear my love from my heart."

"Nor can they take you away, or lock you up."

"I fear nothing of that sort, Anton. All that I really fear is secrecy. Would it not be best
that I should tell father?"

"What!--now, at once?"

"If you will let me. I suppose he must know it soon."

"You can if you please."

"Souchey will tell him."

"Will Souchey dare to speak of you like that?" asked the Jew.

"Oh, yes; Souchey dares to say anything to father now. Besides, it is true. Why should not
Souchey say it?"

"But you have not spoken to Souchey; you have not told him?"

"I! No indeed. I have spoken never a word to anyone about that--only to you. How should I speak
to another without your bidding? But when they speak to me I must answer them. If father asks
me whether there be aught between you and me, shall I not tell him then?"

"It would be better to be silent for a while."

"But shall I lie to him? I should not mind Souchey nor aunt Sophie much; but I never yet told
a lie to father."

"I do not tell you to lie."

"Let me tell it all. Anton, and then, whatever they may say, whatever they may do, I shall
not mind. I wish that they knew it, and then I could stand up against them. Then I could tell
Ziska that which would make him hold his tongue for ever."

"Ziska! Who cares for Ziska?"

"You need not, at any rate."

"The truth is, Nina, that I cannot be married till I have settled all this about the houses
in the Kleinseite. The very fact that you would be your father's heir prevents my doing so."

"Do you think that I wish to hurry you? I would rather stay as I am, knowing that you love me."

"Dear Nina! But when your aunt shall once know your secret, she will give you no peace till
you are out of her power. She will leave no stone unturned to make you give up your Jew lover."

"She may as well leave the turning of such stones alone."

"But if she heard nothing of it till she heard that we were married--"

"Ah! but that is impossible. I could not do that without telling father, and father would surely
tell my aunt."

"You may do as you will, Nina; but it may be, when they shall know it, that therefore there
may be new difficulty made about the houses. Karil Zamenoy has the papers, which are in truth
mine--or my father's--which should be here in my iron box." And Trendellsohn, as he spoke,
put his hand forcibly on the seat beside him, as though the iron box to which he alluded were
within his reach.

"I know they are yours," said Nina.

"Yes; and without them, should your father die, I could not claim my property. The Zamenoys
might say they held it on your behalf--and you my wife at the time! Do you see, Nina? I could
not stand that--I would not stand that."

"I understand it well, Anton."

"The houses are mine--or ours, rather. Your father has long since had the money, and more than
the money. He knew that the houses were to be ours."

"He knows it well. You do not think that he is holding back the papers?"

"He should get them for me. He should not drive me to press him for them. I know they are at
Karil Zamenoy's counting-house; but your uncle told me, when I spoke to him, that he had no
business with me; if I had a claim on him, there was the law. I have no claim on him. But I
let your father have the money when he wanted it, on his promise that the deeds should be forthcoming.
A Christian would not have been such a fool."

"Oh, Anton, do not speak to me like that."

"But was I not a fool? See how it is now. Were you and I to become man and wife, they would
never give them up, though they are my own--my own. No; we must wait; and you--you must demand
them from your uncle."

"I will demand them. And as for waiting, I care nothing for that if you love me."

"I do love you."

"Then all shall be well with me; and I will ask for the papers. Father, I know, wishes that
you should have all that is your own. He would leave the house to-morrow if you desired it."

"He is welcome to remain there."

"And now, Anton, good-night."

"Good-night, Nina."

"When shall I see you again?"

"When you please, and as often. Have I not said that you are light and heat to me? Can the
sun rise too often for those who love it?" Then she held her hand up to be kissed, and kissed
his in return, and went silently down the stairs into the street. He had said once in the course
of the conversation--nay, twice, as she came to remember in thinking over it--that she might
do as she would about telling her friends; and she had been almost craftily careful to say
nothing herself, and to draw nothing from him, which could be held as militating against this
authority, or as subsequently negativing the permission so given. She would undoubtedly tell
her father--and her aunt; and would as certainly demand from her uncle those documents of which
Anton Trendellsohn had spoken to her.

CHAPTER II

Nina, as she returned home from the Jews' quarter to her father's house in the Kleinseite,
paused for a while on the bridge to make some resolution--some resolution that should be fixed--as
to her immediate conduct. Should she first tell her story to her father, or first to her aunt
Sophie? There were reasons for and against either plan. And if to her father first, then should
she tell it to-night? She was nervously anxious to rush at once at her difficulties, and to
be known to all who belonged to her as the girl who had given herself to the Jew. It was now
late in the evening, and the moon was shining brightly on the palace over against her. The
colonnades seemed to be so close to her that there could hardly be room for any portion of
the city to cluster itself between them and the river. She stood looking up at the great building,
and fell again into her trick of counting the windows, thereby saving herself a while from
the difficult task of following out the train of her thoughts. But what were the windows of
the palace to her? So she walked on again till she reached a spot on the bridge at which she
almost always paused a moment to perform a little act of devotion. There, having a place in
the long row of huge statues which adorn the bridge, is the figure of the martyr St John Nepomucene,
who at this spot was thrown into the river because he would not betray the secrets of a queen's
confession, and was drowned, and who has ever been, from that period downwards, the favourite
saint of Prague--and of bridges. On the balustrade, near the figure, there is a small plate
inserted in the stone-work and good Catholics, as they pass over the river, put their hands
upon the plate, and then kiss their fingers. So shall they be saved from drowning and from
all perils of the water--as far, at least, as that special transit of the river may be perilous.
Nina, as a child, had always touched the stone, and then touched her lips, and did the act
without much thought as to the saving power of St John Nepomucene. But now, as she carried
her hand up to her face, she did think of the deed. Had she, who was about to marry a Jew,
any right to ask for the assistance of a Christian saint? And would such a deed that she now
proposed to herself put her beyond the pale of Christian aid? Would the Madonna herself desert
her should she marry a Jew? If she were to become truer than ever to her faith--more diligent,
more thoughtful, more constant in all acts of devotion--would the blessed Mary help to save
her, even though she should commit this great sin? Would the mild-eyed, sweet Saviour, who
had forgiven so many women, who had saved from a cruel death the woman taken in adultery, who
had been so gracious to the Samaritan woman at the well--would He turn from her the graciousness
of His dear eyes, and bid her go out for ever from among the faithful? Madame Zamenoy would
tell her so, and so would Sister Teresa, an old nun, who was on most friendly terms with Madame
Zamenoy, and whom Nina altogether hated; and so would the priest, to whom, alas! she would
be bound to give faith. And if this were so, whither should she turn for comfort? She could
not become a Jewess! She might call herself one; but how could she be a Jewess with her strong
faith in St Nicholas, who was the saint of her own Church, and in St John of the River, and
in the Madonna? No; she must be an outcast from all religions, a Pariah, one devoted absolutely
to the everlasting torments which lie beyond Purgatory--unless, indeed, unless that mild- eyed
Saviour would be content to take her faith and her acts of hidden worship, despite her aunt,
despite that odious nun, and despite the very priest himself! She did not know how this might
be with her, but she did know that all the teaching of her life was against any such hope.

But what was--what could be the good of such thoughts to her? Had not things gone too far with
her for such thoughts to be useful? She loved the Jew, and had told him so; and not all the
penalties with which the priests might threaten her could lessen her love, or make her think
of her safety here or hereafter, as a thing to be compared with her love. Religion was much
to her; the fear of the everlasting wrath of Heaven was much to her; but love was paramount!
What if it were her soul? Would she not give even her soul for her love, if, for her love's
sake, her soul should be required from her? When she reached the archway, she had made up her
mind that she would tell her aunt first, and that she would do so early on the following day.
Were she to tell her father first, her father might probably forbid her to speak on the subject
to Madame Zamenoy, thinking that his own eloquence and that of the priest might prevail to
put an end to so terrible an iniquity, and that so Madame Zamenoy might never learn the tidings.
Nina, thinking of all this, and being quite determined that the Zamenoys should know what she
intended to tell them, resolved that she would say nothing on that night at home.

"You are very late, Nina," said her father to her, crossly, as soon as she entered the room
in which they lived. It was a wide apartment, having in it now but little furniture--two rickety
tables, a few chairs, an old bureau in which Balatka kept, under lock and key, all that still
belonged to him personally, and a little desk, which was Nina's own repository.

"Yes, father, I am late; but not very late. I have been with Anton Trendellsohn."

"And what have you been there for now?"

"Anton Trendellsohn has been talking to me about the papers which uncle Karil has. He wants
to have them himself. He says they are his."

"I suppose he means that we are to be turned out of the old house."

"No, father; he does not mean that. He is not a cruel man. But he says that--that he cannot
settle anything about the property without having the papers. I suppose that is true."

"He has the rent of the other houses," said Balatka.

"Yes; but if the papers are his, he ought to have them."

"Did he send for them?"

"No, father; he did not send."

"And what made you go?"

"I am so of often going there. He had spoken to me before about this. He thinks you do not
like him to come here, and you never go there yourself."

After this there was a pause for a few minutes, and Nina was settling herself to her work.
Then the old man spoke again.

"Nina, I fear you see too much of Anton Trendellsohn." The words were the very words of Souchey;
and Nina was sure that her father and the servant had been discussing her conduct. It was no
more than she had expected, but her father's words had come very quickly upon Souchey's speech
to herself. What did it signify? Everybody would know it all before twenty-four hours had passed
by. Nina, however, was determined to defend herself at the present moment, thinking that there
was something of injustice in her father's remarks. "As for seeing him often, father, I have
done it because your business has required it. When you were ill in April I had to be there
almost daily."

"But you need not have gone to-night. He did not send for you."

"But it is needful that something should be done to get for him that which is his own." As
she said this there came to her a sting of conscience, a thought that reminded her that, though
she was not lying to her father in words, she was in fact deceiving him; and remembering her
assertion to her lover that she had never spoken falsely to her father, she blushed with shame
as she sat in the darkness of her seat.

"To-morrow father," she said, "I will talk to you more about this, and you shall not at any
rate say that I keep anything from you."

"I have never said so, Nina."

"It is late now, father. Will you not go to bed?"

Old Balatka yielded to this suggestion, and went to his bed; and Nina, after some hour or two,
went to hers. But before doing so she opened the little desk that stood in the corner of their
sitting-room, of which the key was always in her pocket, and took out everything that it contained.
There were many letters there, of which most were on matters of business--letters which in
few houses would come into the hands of such a one as Nina Balatka, but which, through the
weakness of her father's health, had come into hers. Many of these she now read; some few she
tore and burned in the stove, and others she tied in bundles and put back carefully into their
place. There was not a paper in the desk which did not pass under her eye, and as to which
she did not come to some conclusion, either to keep it or to burn it. There were no love-letters
there. Nina Balatka had never yet received such a letter as that. She saw her lover too frequently
to feel much the need of written expressions of love; and such scraps of his writing as there
were in the bundles, referred altogether to small matters of business. When she had thus arranged
her papers, she too went to bed. On the next morning, when she gave her father his breakfast,
she was very silent. She made for him a little chocolate, and cut for him a few slips of white
bread to dip into it. For herself, she cut a slice from a black loaf made of rye flour, and
mixed with water a small quantity of the thin sour wine of the country. Her meal may have been
worth perhaps a couple of kreutzers, or something less than a penny, whereas that of her father
may have cost twice as much. Nina was a close and sparing housekeeper, but with all her economy
she could not feed three people upon nothing. Latterly, from month to month, she had sold one
thing out of the house after another, knowing as each article went that provision from such
store as that must soon fail her. But anything was better than taking money from her aunt whom
she hated--except taking money from the Jew whom she loved. From him she had taken none, though
it had been often offered. "You have lost more than enough by father," she had said to him
when the offer had been made. "What I give to the wife of my bosom shall never be reckoned
as lost," he had answered. She had loved him for the words, and had pressed his hand in hers--but
she had not taken his money. From her aunt some small meagre supply had been accepted from
time to time--a florin or two now, and a florin or two again--given with repeated intimations
on aunt Sophie's part, that her husband Karil could not be expected to maintain the house in
the Kleinseite. Nina had not felt herself justified in refusing such gifts from her aunt to
her father, but as each occasion came she told herself that some speedy end must be put to
this state of things. Her aunt's generosity would not sustain her father, and her aunt's generosity
nearly killed herself. On this very morning she would do that which should certainly put an
end to a state of things so disagreeable. After breakfast, therefore, she started at once for
the house in the Windberg-gasse, leaving her father still in his bed. She walked very quick,
looking neither to the right nor the left, across the bridge, along the river-side, and then
up into the straight ugly streets of the New Town. The distance from her father's house was
nearly two miles, and yet the journey was made in half an hour. She had never walked so quickly
through the streets of Prague before; and when she reached the end of the Windberg-gasse, she
had to pause a moment to collect her thoughts and her breath. But it was only for a moment,
and then the bell was rung.

Yes; her aunt was at home. At ten in the morning that was a matter of course. She was shown,
not into the grand drawing-room, which was only used on grand occasions, but into a little
back parlour which, in spite of the wealth and magnificence of the Zamenoys, was not so clean
as the room in the Kleinseite, and certainly not so comfortable as the Jew's apartment. There
was no carpet; but that was not much, as carpets in Prague were not in common use. There were
two tables crowded with things needed for household purposes, half-a-dozen chairs of different
patterns, a box of sawdust close under the wall, placed there that papa Zamenoy might spit
into it when it pleased him. There was a crowd of clothes and linen hanging round the stove,
which projected far into the room; and spread upon the table, close to which was placed mamma
Zamenoy's chair, was an article of papa Zamenoy's dress, on which mamma Zamenoy was about to
employ her talents in the art of tailoring. All this, however, was nothing to Nina, nor was
the dirt on the floor much to her, though she had often thought that if she were to go and
live with aunt Sophie, she would contrive to make some improvement as to the cleanliness of
the house.

"Your aunt will be down soon," said Lotta Luxa as they passed through the passage. "She is
very angry, Nina, at not seeing you all the last week."

"I don't know why she should be angry, Lotta. I did not say I would come."

Lotta Luxa was a sharp little woman, over forty years of age, with quick green eyes and thin
red-tipped nose, looking as though Paris might have been the town of her birth rather than
Prague. She wore short petticoats, clean stockings, an old pair of slippers; and in the back
of her hair she still carried that Diana's dart which maidens wear in those parts when they
are not only maidens unmarried, but maidens also disengaged. No one had yet succeeded in drawing
Lotta Luxa's arrow from her head, though Souchey, from the other side of the river, had made
repeated attempts to do so. For Lotta Luxa had a little money of her own, and poor Souchey
had none. Lotta muttered something about the thoughtless thanklessness of young people, and
then took herself down- stairs. Nina opened the door of the back parlour, and found her cousin
Ziska sitting alone with his feet propped upon the stove.

"What, Ziska," she said, "you not at work by ten o'clock!"

"I was not well last night, and took physic this morning," said Ziska. "Something had disagreed
with me."

"I'm sorry for that, Ziska. You eat too much fruit, I suppose."

"Lotta says it was the sausage, but I don't think it was. I'm very fond of sausage, and everybody
must be ill sometimes. She'll be down here again directly;" and Ziska with his head nodded
at the chair in which his mother was wont to sit.

Nina, whose mind was quite full of her business, was determined to go to work at once. "I'm
glad to have you alone for a moment, Ziska," she said.

"And so am I very glad; only I wish I had not taken physic, it makes one so uncomfortable."

At this moment Nina had in her heart no charity towards her cousin, and did not care for his
discomfort. "Ziska," she said, "Anton Trendellsohn wants to have the papers about the houses
in the Kleinseite. He says that they are his, and you have them."

Ziska hated Anton Trendellsohn, hardly knowing why he hated him. "If Trendellsohn wants anything
of us," said he, "why does he not come to the office? He knows where to find us."

"Yes, Ziska, he knows where to find you; but, as he says, he has no business with you--no business
as to which he can make a demand. He thinks, therefore, you would merely bid him begone."

"Very likely. One doesn't want to see more of a Jew than one can help."

"That Jew, Ziska, owns the house in which father lives. That Jew, Ziska, is the best friend
that--that--that father has."

"I'm sorry you think so, Nina."

"How can I help thinking it? You can't deny, nor can uncle, that the houses belong to him.
The papers got into uncle's hands when he and father were together, and I think they ought
to be given up now. Father thinks that the Trendellsohns should have them. Even though they
are Jews, they have a right to their own."

"You know nothing about it, Nina. How should you know about such things as that?"

"I am driven to know. Father is ill, and cannot come himself."

"Oh, laws! I am so uncomfortable. I never will take stuff from Lotta Luxa again. She thinks
a man is the same as a horse."

This little episode put a stop to the conversation about the title- deeds, and then Madame
Zamenoy entered the room. Madame Zamenoy was a woman of a portly demeanour, well fitted to
do honour by her personal presence to that carriage and horses with which Providence and an
indulgent husband had blessed her. And when she was dressed in her full panoply of French millinery--the
materials of which had come from England, and the manufacture of which had taken place in Prague--she
looked the carriage and horses well enough. But of a morning she was accustomed to go about
the house in a pale-tinted wrapper, which, pale- tinted as it was, should have been in the
washing-tub much oftener than was the case with it--if not for cleanliness, then for mere decency
of appearance.

And the mode in which she carried her matutinal curls, done up with black pins, very visible
to the eye, was not in itself becoming. The handkerchief which she wore in lieu of cap, might
have been excused on the score of its ugliness, as Madame Zamenoy was no longer young, had
it not been open to such manifest condemnation for other sins. And in this guise she would
go about the house from morning to night on days not made sacred by the use of the carriage.
Now Lotta Luxa was clean in the midst of her work; and one would have thought that the cleanliness
of the maid would have shamed the slatternly ways of the mistress. But Madame Zamenoy and Lotta
Luxa had lived together long, and probably knew each other well.

"Well, Nina," she said, "so you've come at last?"

"Yes; I've come, aunt. And as I want to say something very particular to you yourself, perhaps
Ziska won't mind going out of the room for a minute." Nina had not sat down since she had been
in the room, and was now standing before her aunt with almost militant firmness. She was resolved
to rush at once at the terrible subject which she had in hand, but she could not do so in the
presence of her cousin Ziska.

Ziska groaned audibly. "Ziska isn't well this morning," said Madame Zamenoy, "and I do not
wish to have him disturbed."

"Then perhaps you'll come into the front parlour, aunt."

"What can there be that you cannot say before Ziska?"

"There is something, aunt," said Nina.

If there were a secret, Madame Zamenoy decidedly wished to hear it, and therefore, after pausing
to consider the matter for a moment or two, she led the way into the front parlour.

"And now, Nina, what is it? I hope you have not disturbed me in this way for anything that
is a trifle."

"It is no trifle to me, aunt. I am going to be married to--Anton Trendellsohn." She said the
words slowly, standing bolt-upright, at her greatest height, as she spoke them, and looking
her aunt full in the face with something of defiance both in her eyes and in the tone of her
voice. She had almost said, "Anton Trendellsohn, the Jew;" and when her speech was finished,
and admitted of no addition, she reproached herself with pusillanimity in that she had omitted
the word which had always been so odious, and would now be doubly odious--odious to her aunt
in a tenfold degree.

Madame Zamenoy stood for a while speechless--struck with horror. The tidings which she heard
were so unexpected, so strange, and so abominable, that they seemed at first to crush her.
Nina was her niece--her sister's child; and though she might be repudiated, reviled, persecuted,
and perhaps punished, still she must retain her relationship to her injured relatives. And
it seemed to Madame Zamenoy as though the marriage of which Nina spoke was a thing to be done
at once, out of hand--as though the disgusting nuptials were to take place on that day or on
the next, and could not now be avoided. It occurred to her that old Balatka himself was a consenting
party, and that utter degradation was to fall upon the family instantly. There was that in
Nina's air and manner, as she spoke of her own iniquity, which made the elder woman feel for
the moment that she was helpless to prevent the evil with which she was threatened.

"Anton Trendellsohn--a Jew," she said, at last.

"Yes, aunt; Anton Trendellsohn, the Jew. I am engaged to him as his wife."

There was a something of doubtful futurity in the word engaged, which gave a slight feeling
of relief to Madame Zamenoy, and taught her to entertain a hope that there might be yet room
for escape. "Marry a Jew, Nina," she said; "it cannot be possible!"

"It is possible, aunt. Other Jews in Prague have married Christians."

"Yes, I know it. Some are huge wells where
huge rivers disappear, others are simple depressions in the soil, species nest well lined
with grass, where the beautiful autumn days can be enjoyed the warm caress of the sun without
fear of air passing over the dry grass whistling of level. Some of these holes are blocked and
filled gradually, but there are others widen and deepen noticeably from year to year. Some openings
that seemed shelter snake, which we had not put his hand for fear of being bitten, was a principle
the abyss, the rains and landslides have widened both the interior, many of them are now beginning
with declines of red clay furrowed by the stream of waters. Of these natural wells, the most
picturesque are the furthest from the birth of the source. Where are these the plain, whose
plan is already unequal, ends abruptly the foot of a rocky wall beside which opens a valley
which carries water to a distant river. The rocks rise up to the sky with a beautiful light golden
brown facade, but its bases are hidden by a grove of oak and chestnut, thanks to the vegetables
and variety foliage, the contrast too hard which would form a steep wall of rocks with flat horizontal
surface appears smooth. In the thickest of the forest site is where is the abyss. On edge, some
shrubs bend their stems to the surface blue, seen through the branches of the oak, birch just
dropped over the sima delicate branches. On arriving at these sites is necessary to take some
precautions, because the ground is too rugged and have no curb well as those building engineers. Move

into the void.

a red spot seen in the darkness of the background on a ledge of rock, is an infinitely small

Also, can be lowered into the well, and I am one of those who have had the pleasure. Adventure

but not in itself is nothing seductive, and none of those who made
these declines are in the abyss available to repeat it.

A rope, provided by a nearby farmer, is bound tightly to the trunk of an oak tree and dropping
it into a tailspin, sweet swings by actuation of the small stream of water, which wets the

her on every side, and who were seldom countrymen of her own, over and above the law? Were
there not still dark dungeons and steel locks and hard hearts? Though the law might justify
her, how would that serve her, if men--if men and women, were determined to persecute her?
As she walked home, however, she resolved that dark dungeons and steel locks and hard hearts
might do their worst against her. She had set her will upon one thing in this world, and from
that one thing no persecution should drive her. They might kill her, perhaps. Yes, they might
kill her; and then there would be an end of it. But to that end she would force them to come
before she would yield. So much she swore to herself as she walked home on that morning to
the Kleinseite.

Madame Zamenoy, when Nina left her, sat in solitary consideration for some twenty minutes,
and then called for her chief confidant, Lotta Luxa. With many expressions of awe, and with
much denunciation of her niece's iniquity, she told to Lotta what she had heard, speaking of
Nina as one who was utterly lost and abandoned. Lotta, however, did not express so much indignant
surprise as her mistress expected, though she was willing enough to join in abuse against Nina
Balatka.

"That comes of letting girls go about just as they please among the men," said Lotta.

"But a Jew!" said Madame Zamenoy. "If it had been any kind of a Christian, I could understand it."

"Trendellsohn has such a hold upon her, and upon her father," said Lotta.

"But a Jew! She has been to confession, has she not?"

"Regularly," said Lotta Luxa.

"Dear, dear! what a false hypocrite! And at mass?"

"Four mornings a-week always."

"And to tell me, after it all, that she means to marry a Jew. Of course, Lotta, we must prevent
it."

"But how? Her father will do whatever she bids him."

"Father Jerome would do anything for me."

"Father Jerome can do little or nothing if she has the bit between her teeth," said Lotta.
"She is as obstinate as a mule when she pleases. She is not like other girls. You cannot frighten
her out of anything."

"I'll try, at least," said Madame Zamenoy.

"Yes, we can try," said Lotta.

"Would not the mayor help us--that is, if we were driven to go to that?"

"I doubt if he could do anything. He would be afraid to use a high hand. He is Bohemian. The
head of the police might do something, if we could get at him."

"She might be taken away."

"Where could they take her?" asked Lotta. "No; they could not take her anywhere."

"Not into a convent--out of the way somewhere in Italy?"

"Oh, heaven, no! They are afraid of that sort of thing now. All Prague would know of it, and
would talk; and the Jews would be stronger than the priests; and the English people would hear
of it, and there would be the very mischief."

"The times have come to be very bad, Lotta."

"That's as may be," said Lotta as though she had her doubts upon the subject. "That's as may
be. But it isn't easy to put a young woman away now without her will. Things have changed--partly
for the worse, perhaps, and partly for the better. Things are changing every day. My wonder
is that he should wish to many her."

"The men think her very pretty. Ziska is mad about her," said Madame Zamenoy.

"But Ziska is a calf to Anton Trendellsohn. Anton Trendellsohn has cut his wise teeth. Like
them all, he loves his money; and she has not got a kreutzer."

"But he has promised to marry her. You may be sure of that."

"Very likely. A man always promises that when he wants a girl to be kind to him. But why should
he stick to it? What can he get by marrying Nina--a penniless girl, with a pauper for a father?
The Trendellsohns have squeezed that sponge dry already."

This was a new light to Madame Zamenoy, and one that was not altogether unpleasant to her eyes.
That her niece should have promised herself to a Jew was dreadful, and that her niece should
be afterwards jilted by the Jew was a poor remedy. But still it was a remedy, and therefore
she listened.

"If nothing else can be done, we could perhaps put him against it," said Lotta Luxa.

Madame Zamenoy on that occasion said but little more, but she agreed with her servant that
it would be better to resort to any means than to submit to the degradation of an alliance
with the Jew.

CHAPTER III

On the third day after Nina's visit to her aunt, Ziska Zamenoy came across to the Kleinseite
on a visit to old Balatka. In the mean time Nina had told the story of her love to her father,
and the effect on Balatka had simply been that he had not got out of his bed since. For himself
he would have cared, perhaps, but little as to the Jewish marriage, had he not known that those
belonging to him would have cared so much. He had no strong religious prejudice of his own,
nor indeed had he strong feeling of any kind. He loved his daughter, and wished her well; but
even for her he had been unable to exert himself in his younger days, and now simply expected
from her hands all the comfort which remained to him in this world. The priest he knew would
attack him, and to the priest he would be able to make no answer. But to Trendellsohn, Jew
as he was, he would trust in worldly matters, rather than to the Zamenoys; and were it not
that he feared the Zamenoys, and could not escape from his close connection with them, he would
have been half inclined to let the girl marry the Jew. Souchey, indeed, had frightened him
on the subject when it had first been mentioned to him; and Nina, coming with her own assurance
so quickly after Souchey's suspicion, had upset him; but his feeling in regard to Nina had
none of that bitter anger, no touch of that abhorrence which animated the breast of his sister-in-law.
When Ziska came to him he was alone in his bedroom. Ziska had heard the news, as had all the
household in the Windberg-gasse, and had come over to his uncle's house to see what he could
do, by his own diplomacy, to put an end to an engagement which was to him doubly calamitous.
"Uncle Josef," he said, sitting by the old man's bed, have you heard what Nina is doing?"

"What she is doing!" said the uncle. "What is she doing?" A lane that starts at the fountain's
edge, winds up the hill to parallel the trees, then can be seen no more when it is over run by tall
shoots in the fold of the land. It at last arrives at the plain that
grows abundant grain. I have known him since he was born."

"Do you wish to have him for a son-in-law?"

"For a son-in-law?"

"Yes, for a son-in-law--Anton Trendellsohn, the Jew. Would he be a good husband for our Nina?
You say nothing, uncle Josef."

"What am I to say?"

"You have heard of it, then? Why can you not answer me, uncle Josef? Have you heard that Trendellsohn
has dared to ask Nina to be his wife?"

"There is not so much of daring in it, Ziska. Among you all the poor girl is a beggar. If some
one does not take pity on her, she will starve soon."

"Take pity on her! Do not we all take pity on her?"

"No," said Josef Balatka, turning angrily against his nephew; "not a scrap of pity--not a morsel
of love. You cannot rid yourself of her quite--of her or me--and that is your pity."

"You are wrong there."

"Very well; then let me be wrong. I can understand what is before my eyes. Look round the house
and see what we are coming to. Nina at the present moment has not got a florin in her purse.
We are starving, or next to it, and yet you wonder that she should be willing to marry an honest
man who has plenty of money."

"But he is a Jew!"

"Yes; he is a Jew. I know that."

"And Nina knows it."

"Of course she does. Do you go home and eat nothing for a week, and then see whether a Jew's
bread will poison you."

"But to marry him, uncle Josef!"

"It is very bad. I know it is bad, but what can I do? If she says she will do it, how can I
help it? She has been a good child to me--a very good child; and am I to lie here and see her
starve? You would not give to your dog the morsel of bread which she ate this morning before
she went out."

All this was a new light to Ziska. He knew that his uncle and cousin were very poor, and had
halted in his love because he was ashamed of their poverty; but he had never thought of them
as people hungry from want of food, or cold from want of clothes. It may be said of him, to
his credit, that his love had been too strong for his shame, and that he had made up his mind
to marry his cousin Nina in spite of her poverty. When Lotta Luxa had called him a calf she
had not inappropriately defined one side of his character. He was a good- looking well-grown
young man, not very wise, quickly susceptible to female influences, and gifted with eyes capable
of convincing him that Nina Balatka was by far the prettiest woman whom he ever saw. This
ravine, the same as other tiny side valleys, is one of the tributaries of the main channel,
albeit one that is intermittent. But it's odd to walk along it's dry bed because you can see
in it the way the water has flowed. And when it was known to Madame
Zamenoy and to her husband Karil that Ziska had set his heart upon having his cousin, they
had expressed no displeasure at the prospect, poor as the Balatkas were. "There is no knowing
how it may go about the houses in the Kleinseite," Karil Zamenoy had said. "Old Trendellsohn
gets the rent and the interest, but he has little or nothing to show for them--merely a written
surrender from Josef, which is worth nothing." No hindrance, therefore was placed in the way
of Ziska's suit, and Nina might have been already accepted in the Windberg-gasse had Nina chosen
to smile upon Ziska. Now Ziska was told that the girl he loved was to marry a Jew because she
was starving, and the tidings threw a new light upon him. Why had he not offered assistance
to Nina? It was not surprising that Nina should be so hard to him--to him who had as yet offered
her nothing in her poverty but a few cold compliments.

"She shall have bread enough, if that is what she wants," said Ziska.

"Bread and kindness," said the old man.

"She shall have kindness too, uncle Josef. I love Nina better than any Jew in Prague can love her."

"Why should not a Jew love? I believe the man loves her well. Why else should he wish to make
her his wife?"

"And I love her well--and I would make her my wife."

"You want to marry Nina!"

"Yes, uncle Josef. I wish to marry Nina. I will marry her to-morrow-- or, for that matter,
to-day--if she will have me."

"You! Ziska Zamenoy!"

"I, Ziska Zamenoy."

"And what would your mother say?"

"Both father and mother will consent. There need be no hindrance if Nina will agree. I did
not know that you were so badly off. I did not indeed, or I would have come to you myself and
seen to it."

Old Balatka did not answer for a while, having turned himself in his bed to think of the proposition
which had been made to him. "Would you not like to have me for a son-in-law better than a Jew,
uncle Josef?" said Ziska, pleading for himself as best he knew how to plead.

"Have you ever spoken to Nina?" said the old man.

"Well, no; not exactly to say what I have said to you. When one loves a girl as I love her,
somehow--I don't know how--But I am ready to do so at once.

"Ah, Ziska, if you had done it sooner!"

"But is it too late? You say she has taken up with this man because you are both so poor. She
cannot like a Jew best."

"But she is true--so true!"

"If you mean about her promise to Trendellsohn, Father Jerome would tell her in a minute that
she should not keep such a promise to a Jew."

"She would not mind Father Jerome."

"And what does she mind? Will she not mind you?"

"Me; yes--she will mind me, to give me my food."

"Will she not obey you?"

"How am I to bid her obey me? But I will try, Ziska."

"You would not wish her to marry a Jew?"

"No, Ziska; certainly I should not wish it."

"And you will give me your consent?"

"Yes, if it be any good to you."

"It will be good if you will be round with her, telling her that she must not do such a thing
as this. Love a Jew! It is impossible. As you have been so very poor, she may be forgiven for
having thought of it. Tell her that, uncle Josef; and whatever you do, be firm with her."

"There she is in the next room," said the father, who had heard his daughter's entrance. Ziska's
face had assumed something of a defiant look while he was recommending firmness to the old
man; but now that the girl of whom he had spoken was so near at hand, there returned to his
brow the young calf-like expression with which Lotta Luxa was so well acquainted. "There she
is, and you will speak to her yourself now," said Balatka.

Ziska got up to go, but as he did so he fumbled in his pocket and brought forth a little bundle
of bank-notes. A bundle of bank-notes in Prague may be not little, and yet represent very little
money. When bank-notes are passed for two-pence and become thick with use, a man may have a
great mass of paper currency in his pocket without being rich. On this occasion, however, Ziska
tendered to his uncle no two- penny notes. The creature finally recognized us and
wagged his tail in welcome.

Our special area was a small island where we could go in through either the mill, which was built across
the stream, or, it was possible to slide along a ledge that was built outside the house. There were
blades for the miller to regulate the flow of water. We liked going in this way and in a couple
of jumps we got to the island. It lies in the shade of a great walnut tree with smooth bark. With
just a few stopovers we were able to see a beautiful view of trees, the brook, glorious waterfalls
and the ancient walls. It provided a view that was charming beyond
belief.

"Then I will take it for kindness," said Nina.

"Why should there be quarrelling among relatives?" said the old man from among the bed-clothes.

"Why, indeed?" said Ziska.

"Why, indeed," said Nina, "--if it could be helped?"

She knew that the outward serenity of the words spoken was too good to be a fair representation
of thoughts below in the mind of any of them. It could not be that Ziska had come there to
express even his own consent to her marriage with Anton Trendellsohn; and without such consent
there must of necessity be a continuation of quarrelling. "Have you been speaking to father,
Ziska, about those papers?" Nina was determined that there should be no glozing of matters,
no soft words used effectually to stop her in her projected course. So she rushed at once at
the subject which she thought most important in Ziska's presence.

"What papers?" said Ziska.

"The papers which belong to Anton Trendellsohn about this house and the others. They are his,
and you would not wish to keep things which belong to another, even though he should be a--Jew."

Then it occurred to Ziska that Trendellsohn might be willing to give up Nina if he got the
papers, and that Nina might be willing to be free from the Jew by the same arrangement. It
could not be that such a girl as Nina Balatka should prefer the love of a Jew to the love of
a Christian. So at least Ziska argued in his own mind. "I do not want to keep anything that
belongs to anybody," said Ziska. "If the papers are with us, I am willing that they should
be given up--that is, if it be right that they should be given up."

"It is right," said Nina.

"I believe the Trendellsohns should have them--either father or son," said old Balatka.

"Of course they should have them," said Nina; "either father or son--it makes no matter which."

"I will try and see to it," said Ziska.

"Pray do," said Nina; "it will be only just; and one would not wish to rob even a Jew, I suppose."
Ziska understood nothing of what was intended by the tone of her voice, and began to think
that there might really be ground for hope.

"Nina," he said, "your father is not quite well. I want you to speak to me in the next room."

"Certainly, Ziska, if you wish it. Father, I will come again to you soon. Souchey is making
your soup, and I will bring it to you when it is ready." Then she led the way into the sitting-room,
and as Ziska came through, she carefully shut the door. The walls dividing the rooms were very
thick, and the door stood in a deep recess, so that no sound could be heard from one room to
another. Nina did not wish that her father should hear what might now pass between herself
and her cousin, and therefore she was careful to shut the door close.

"Ziska," said she, as soon as they were together, "I am very glad that you have come here.
My aunt is so angry with me that I cannot speak with her, and uncle Karil only snubs me if
I say a word to him about business. He would snub me, no doubt, worse than ever now; and yet
who is there here to speak of such matters if I may not do so? You see how it is with father."

"He is not able to do much, I suppose."

"He is able to do nothing, and there is nothing for him to do--nothing that can be of any use.
But of course he should see that those who have been good to him are not--are not injured because
of their kindness."

"You mean those Jews--the Trendellsohns."

"Yes, those Jews the Trendellsohns! You would not rob a man because he is a Jew," said she,
repeating the old words.

"They know how to take care of themselves, Nina."

"Very likely."

"They have managed to get all your father's property between them."

"I don't know how that is. Father says that the business which uncle and you have was once
his, and that he made it. In these matters the weakest always goes to the wall. Father has
no son to help him, as uncle Karil has--and old Trendellsohn."

"You may help him better than any son."

"I will help him if I can. Will you and uncle give up those papers which you have kept since
father left them with uncle Karil, just that they might be safe?"

This question Ziska would not answer at once. The matter was one on which he wished to negotiate,
and he was driven to the necessity of considering what might be the best line for his diplomacy.
"I am sure, Ziska," continued Nina, "you will understand why I ask this. Father is too weak
to make the demand, and uncle would listen to nothing that Anton Trendellsohn would say to him."

"They say that you have betrothed yourself to this Jew, Nina."

"It is true. But that has nothing to do with it."

"He is very anxious to have the deeds?"

"Of course he is anxious. Father is old and poorly; and what would he do if father were to die?"

"Nina, he shall have them--if he will give you up." 

In the North, where there are many fountains, streams and rivers, the springs are ignored. In the South
however, care is given to the springs. The people in the North value the rivers for the trade and
commerce it brings in. If they value the rivers, they should also take care of the source that
feeds them.


"Nina," said Ziska, throwing all his passion into his voice, as he best knew how, "it cannot
be that you should love this man."

"Why not love him?"

"A Jew!"

"Yes--a Jew! I do love him."

"Nina!"

"What have you to say, Ziska? Whatever you say, do not abuse him. It is my affair, not yours.
You may think what you like of me for taking such a husband, but remember that he is to be
my husband."

"Nina, let me be your husband."

"No, Ziska; that cannot be."

"I love you. I love you fifty times better than he can do. Is not a Christian's love better
than a Jew's?"

"Because I do not love you. Can there be any other reason in such a matter? I do not love you.
I do not care if I never see you. But him I love with all my heart. To see him is the only
delight of my life. To sit beside him, with his hand in mine, and my head on his shoulder,
is heaven to me. To obey him is my duty; to serve him is my pleasure. To be loved by him is
the only good thing which God has given me on earth. Now, Ziska, you will know why I cannot
be your wife." Still she stood before him, and still she looked up into his face, keeping her
gaze upon him even after her words were finished.

"Accursed Jew!" said Ziska.

"That is right, Ziska; curse him; it is so easy."

"And you too will be cursed--here and hereafter. If you marry a Jew you will be accursed to
all eternity."

"That, too, is very easy to say."

"It is not I who say it. The priest will tell you the same."

"Let him tell me so; it is his business, but it is not yours. You say it because you cannot
have what you want yourself; that is all. When shall I call in the Ross Markt for the papers?"
In the Ross Markt was the house of business of Karil Zamenoy, and there, as Nina well knew,
were kept the documents which she was so anxious to obtain. But the demand at this moment was
made simply with the object of vexing Ziska, and urging him on to further anger.

"Unless you will give up Anton Trendellsohn, you had better not come to the Ross Markt."

"I will never give him up."

"We will see. Perhaps he will give you up after a while. It will be a fine thing to be jilted
by a Jew."

"The Jew, at any rate, shall not be jilted by the Christian. And now, if you please, I will
ask you to go. I do not choose to be insulted in father's house. It is his house still."

"Nina, I will give you one more chance."

"You can give me no chance that will do you or me any good. If you will go, that is all I want
of you now."

For a moment or two Ziska stood in doubt as to what he would next do or say. Then he took up
his hat and went away without another word. On that same evening some one rang the bell at
the door of the house in the Windberg-gasse in a most humble manner--with that weak, hesitating
hand which, by the tone which it produces, seems to insinuate that no one need hurry to answer
such an appeal, and that the answer, when made, may be made by the lowest personage in the
house. In this instance, however, Lotta Luxa did answer the bell, and not the stout Bohemian
girl who acted in the household of Madame Zamenoy as assistant and fag to Lotta. And Lotta
found Nina at the door, enveloped in her cloak. "Lotta," she said, "will you kindly give this
to my cousin Ziska?" Then, not waiting for a word, she started away so quickly that Lotta had
not a chance of speaking to her, no power of uttering an audible word of abuse. When Ziska
opened the parcel thus brought to him, he found it to contain all the notes which he had given
to Josef Balatka.

CHAPTER IV

When Nina returned to her father after Ziska's departure, a very few words made everything
clear between them. "I would not have him if there was not another man in the world," Nina
had said. "He thinks that it is only Anton Trendellsohn that prevents it, but he knows nothing
about what a girl feels. He thinks that because we are poor I am to be bought, this way or
that way, by a little money. Is that a man, father, that any girl can love?" Then the father
had confessed his receipt of the bank-notes from Ziska, and we already know to what result
that confession had led.

Till she had delivered her packet into the hands of Lotta Luxa, she maintained her spirits
by the excitement of the thing she was doing. Though she should die in the streets of hunger,
she would take no money from Ziska Zamenoy. But the question now was not only of her wants,
but of her father's. That she, for herself, would be justified in returning Ziska's money there
could be no doubt; but was she equally justified in giving back money that had been given to
her father? As she walked to the Windberg-gasse, still holding the parcel of notes in her hand,
she had no such qualms of conscience; but as she returned, when it was altogether too late
for repentance, she made pictures to herself of terrible scenes in which her father suffered
all the pangs of want, because she had compelled him to part with this money. If she were to
say one word to Anton Trendellsohn, all her trouble on that head would be over. Anton Trendellsohn
would at once give her enough to satisfy their immediate wants. Thousands, priests and heads
of nations, perfidious or full of good intentions, have reinforced the whip and gag, or have more
limited ability to make repeated in all ages the ideas of obedience in order to kill and degrade
the spirit wills, but Fortunately, all those pastors who wanted to enslave man by the terror,
the overwhelming ignorance or routine, have failed to create a world in his own image, could
not make nature a large garden of fragrant orange trees, with gnarled trees as monsters and dwarves,
with valleys cut as geometrical figures and rock carvings to the fashion.
 Even aunt Sophie had been softened at that moment, and had shown some tenderness
to the orphan child. "You are to keep it always for her sake," aunt Sophie had said; and Nina
had hitherto kept the trinket, when all other things were gone, in remembrance of her mother.
She had hitherto reconciled herself to keeping her little treasure, when all other things were
going, by the sacredness of the deposit; and had told herself that even for her father's sake
she must not part with the gift which had come to her from her mother. But now she comforted
herself by the reflection that the necklace would produce for her enough to repay her father
that present from Ziska which she had taken from him. Her father had pleaded sorely to be allowed
to keep the notes. In her emotion at the moment she had been imperative with him, and her resolution
had prevailed. But she thought of his entreaties as she returned home, and of his poverty and
wants, and she determined that the necklace should go. It would produce for her at any rate
as much as Ziska had given. She wished that she had brought it with her, as she passed the
open door of a certain pawnbroker, which she had entered often during the last six months,
and whither she intended to take her treasure, so that she might comfort her father on her
return with the sight of the money. But she had it not, and she went home empty-handed. "And
now, Nina, I suppose we may starve," said her father, whom she found sitting close to the stove
in the kitchen, while Souchey was kneeling before it, putting in at the little open door morsels
of fuel which were lamentably insufficient for the poor man's purpose of raising a fire. The
weather, indeed, was as yet warm--so warm that in the middle of the day the heat was matter
of complaint to Josef Balatka; but in the evening he would become chill; and as there existed
some small necessity for cooking, he would beg that he might thus enjoy the warmth of the kitchen.

"Yes, we shall starve now," said Souchey, complacently. "There is not much doubt about our
starving."

"Souchey, I wonder you should speak like that before father," said Nina.

"And why shouldn't he speak?" said Balatka. "I think he has as much right as any one."

"He has no right to make things worse than they are."

"I don't know how I could do that, Nina," said the servant. "What made you take that money
back to your aunt?"

"I didn't take it back to my aunt."

"Well, to any of the family then? I suppose it came from your aunt?"

"It came from my cousin Ziska, and I thought it better to give it back. Souchey, do not you
come in between father and me. There are troubles enough; do not you make them worse."

"If I had been here you should never have taken it back again," said Souchey, obstinately. 

Today because of all the roads that cut through the land in every direction, you only need to navigate
the river as entertainment and the sheer joy of holding a paddle and feeling the waves underneath
your boat.

"Who will give it you, Nina?"

"Never mind, father, I will have it."

"She will beg it from her Jew lover," said Souchey.

"Souchey," said she, with her eyes flashing fire at him, "if you cannot treat your master's
daughter better than that, you may as well go."

"Is it not true?" demanded Souchey.

"No, it is not true; it is false. I have never taken money from Anton; nor shall I do so till
we are married."

"And that will be never," said Souchey. "It is as well to speak out at once. The priest will
not let it be done."

"All the priests in Prague cannot hinder it," said Nina.

"That is true," said Balatka.

"We shall see," said Souchey. "And in the mean time what is the good of fighting with the Zamenoys?
They are your only friends, Nina, and therefore you take delight in quarrelling with them.
When people have money, they should be allowed to have a little pride." Nina said nothing further
on the occasion, though Souchey and her father went on grumbling for an hour. She discovered,
however, from various words that her father allowed to fall from him, that his opposition to
her marriage had nearly faded away. It seemed to be his opinion that if she were to marry the
Jew, the sooner she did it the better. Now, Nina was determined that she would marry the Jew,
though heaven and earth should meet in consequence. She would marry him if he would marry her.
They had told her that the Jew would jilt her. She did not put much faith in the threat; but
even that was more probable than that she should jilt him.
