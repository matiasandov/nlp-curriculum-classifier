Kellaart's Golunda Newera is, I fancy, the same, although the measurement he gives is less.
Head and body, 3-1/4 inches; tail, 2-1/2. The description tallies, although Kellaart goes upon
difference in size and the omission of Gray to state that G. meltada had the upper incisors
grooved. He says that "this rat is found in pairs in the black soil of Newara Elia, and is
a great destroyer of peas and potatoes." So its habits agree.

GENUS HAPALOMYS.

This was formed by Blyth on a specimen from Burmah of a murine animal "with a long and delicately
fine pelage and exceedingly long tail, the terminal fourth of which is remarkably flattened
and furnished with hair more developed than in perhaps any other truly murine form; limbs short,
with the toes remarkably corrugated underneath; the balls of the inguinal phalanges greatly
developed, protruding beyond the minute claws of the fore-feet, and equally with the more developed
claws of the hind-feet; head short; the ears small and inconspicuous; the skull approaches
in form that of Mus Indicus,[27] but the rodential tusks are broader and flatter to the front.
Molars as in the Muridae generally, but much worn in the specimen under examination; they are
considerably less directed outward than usual, and the bony palate has therefore the appearance
of being narrow; the superorbital ridges project much outward in form of a thin bony plate,
and there is a considerable process at the base of the zygoma anteriorly and posteriorly to
the anti-orbital foramen; zygomata broad, and compressed about the middle."

[Footnote 27: Nesokia Blythiana.]

NO. 380. HAPALOMYS LONGICAUDATUS.

HABITAT.--Shway Gheen, in the valley of the Sitang river in Burmah, or its adjacent hills.

DESCRIPTION.--"Fur long and soft, measuring about five-eights of an inch on the upper parts,
slaty for the basal two-thirds, then glistening brown with black tips, and a few long hairs
of very fine texture interspersed; lower parts dull white; whiskers black, long and fine, and
there is a tuft of fine blackish-hair anterior to the ears."--Blyth. Of another specimen, female:
5-1/4 inches; tail, 7-1/2 inches; sole, 1-1/8 inch; ears posteriorly, 1-1/4 inch.

Specimens of adult male and female with a young one were forwarded to the Asiatic Society's
Museum by Major Berdmore.

       *       *       *       *       *

We have now come to the end of the purely murine group as far as they exist within the limits
assigned to these investigations. I ought perhaps to give some short notices of the following
specimens discovered in Thibet by the Abbe David, and described by Professor Milne-Edwards
in his 'Recherches sur les Mammiferes.'

NO. 381. MUS OUANG-THOMAE. The Kiangsi Rat.

HABITAT.--Kiangsi in Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--A tawny grey above, mixed with long hairs, tipped with brown, greyish below;
between the fore-paws a crescent of pure white, which is a distinguishing mark of the species.

SIZE.--A little less than Mus rattus, which is about seven inches long; tail an inch longer.

This rat Professor Milne-Edwards describes from a single specimen; it is apparently rare, and
was named after the Abbe David's Chinese servant--'Recherches sur les Mammiferes,' p. 290.

inside of limbs yellowish-grey; ears large, nearly naked; incisors deep yellow; tail brown,
covered with short hairs.

SIZE.--About 7-3/4 inches; tail, 6-1/4 inches.--'Mammiferes,' p. 289.

NO. 383. MUS GRISEIPECTUS. The Grey-breasted Rat.

HABITAT.--Moupin; Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--Brown above; the under-parts of a clear grey.

NO. 386. MUS PYGMAEUS. The Pigmy Mouse.

HABITAT.--Moupin; Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--Distinguished by its very short ears and the square form of its head; deep brown
above; greyish-yellow beneath; tail shorter than in the common mouse.

SIZE.--About 2-3/4 inches; tail, about 2 inches.--'Mammiferes,' p. 291.

ARVICOLINAE.

In this sub-family the molars are generally semi-rooted or rootless. The Arvicolinae or Voles
consist of the American Musquash (Fiber zibethicus), a very beaver-like water rat of large
size; the Lemmings (Myodes), of which there are several species which are celebrated for their
vast migrations; and the true Vole (Arvicola), which is the only genus found in India, and
then only in the colder climate of the Himalayas. There are several species in Europe, of which
three are found in England. According to Professor Dallas, the true Voles number about fifty
species, arranged by various writers under a considerable number of sub-genera. In India we
have only eight known species, and two more from the adjacent country of Thibet.

The European forms of Arvicolae have been divided by Blasius into four sub-genera of two divisions--the
first division having rooted molars in the adult animal--containing one sub-genus only, Hypudaeus
of Illiger; the second division consists of three sub-genera with rootless molars, viz. Paludicola,
Agricola, and Arvicola, which last has again been subdivided into long-eared and short-eared
Voles--Arvicola and Microtus--distinguished by the former having eight and the latter four
mammae, and respectively six and four tubercles on the plantae, the ears of the latter being
almost hidden by the fur.

None of the forms with which we have now to deal belong to the first division, for, as far
as the matter has been investigated, the Indian Voles have rootless molars, but the character
of the teeth in some differs from the European forms, and therefore Mr. Blanford has proposed
a new section, Alticola, for their reception. I have not space here, nor would it accord with
the popular character of this work, to go minutely into all the variation of dentition which
distinguish the different species. To those who wish to continue to the minutest details the
study of the Indian Voles, I recommend a most careful and elaborate paper on them by Mr. W.
T. Blanford, F.R.S., in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. L., pt. ii.; but
without entering into the microscopic particulars of each species, I may here give a general
idea of the formation of the teeth of the Arvicolae differing as it does so much from others
of the myomorphic or mouse-like group of rodents. In these the general contour of the molar
teeth is roundish oblong, the margins being wavy or indented, according to the convolutions
of the enamel, but in the Voles there is a sharp angularity about these indentations; the marginal
lines, instead of being in well-rounded curves, are sharply zigzag, forming acute angles. If
you were to draw two close parallel zigzag lines it would give you some idea of the contour
of these teeth. The molars are in fact composed of alternating triangular prisms, with the
outer folds of enamel forming deep and acute angles. The other characteristics of this family
are: skull, with brain case rhomboidal, frontals much contracted; infra-orbital opening typical;
limbs moderate; tail moderate, or short and hairy.

GENUS ARVICOLA.

Muzzle blunt; fore-feet small, with short claws; soles naked; tail longer than the hind-foot,
clad with short hairs; incisors plain, smooth in front. The fore-feet in some species have
but a small wart in place of a thumb; in others there is a small thumb with a minute claw.
The hind-feet have five toes.

NO. 387. ARVICOLA STOLICZKANUS. The Yarkand Vole.

HABITAT.--Yarkand.

DESCRIPTION.--"Bright ferruginous brown above, pure white beneath; fur soft, rather woolly,
0.5 to 0.6 inch long on the middle of the back, the basal portion throughout both head and
body being dark leaden grey; this is the case on the back for about three-quarters of the length
of the hairs; the remaining quarter is rufous white, tipped with darker rufous, whilst numerous
rather longer hairs are dark rufous-brown at the ends; rather a sharp line divides the rufous
of the back from the white belly; upper part of the head the same colour as the back; upper
whiskers dark brown, lower, including the longest, white; ears small, rounded, hairy, completely
concealed by the fur, with rather short bright rufous hair near the margin inside; and covered
outside with longer and paler hair; feet small, the thumb of the fore-foot quite rudimentary
and clawless; remaining claws long, compressed, sharply pointed, but much concealed by the
long white hairs which cover the upper part of the foot, sales naked; tarsus hairy below, a
few hairs between the pads of the toes; tail short, apparently about a quarter the length of
the body and head together, covered with stiff fulvescent white hair, which extends about half
an inch beyond the end."--W. T. Blanford, 'Sc. Res. of Second Yarkand Mission,' p. 43.

SIZE.--Head and body, about 4 inches; tail, with hair, 1-1/2.

NO. 388. ARVICOLA STRACHEYI. The Kumaon Vole.

HABITAT.--Kumaon.

DESCRIPTION.--Light brown above, with a greyish tint and dusky forehead; under-parts, feet,
and tail white; ears small, not longer than the fur, and thickly clad with hair; feet of moderate
size; thumb as in the last; tail short and covered with white hairs.

SIZE.--Head and body, about 3.7 inches; tail; 0.7.

This vole was procured first by Capt. (now Lieut.-Gen.) R. Strachey at Kumaon.

NO. 389. ARVICOLA WYNNEI. The Murree Vole.

NATIVE NAME.--Kannees.

HABITAT.--Northern Himalayas; Murree.

DESCRIPTION.--Dark brown above, with a slight greyish tinge; head rufescent, and under-parts
pale brown; tail dark brown; ears short and rounded, hidden by the fur; fore-feet rather large;
thumb small, with a short claw; incisors orange.

NO. 390. ARVICOLA ROYLEI. The Cashmere Vole (Jerdon's No. 202).

HABITAT.--Kashmir; Kunawur near Chini at 12,000 feet.

DESCRIPTION.--Yellowish-brown, with a rufous tint on the back, paler below; tail brown above,
whitish underneath; feet concolorous with the under-part; ears small, hairy and nearly hidden
by the fur; incisors yellow in front.

Jerdon states he got this vole at Kunawur, near Chini, again on the south side of the Barendo
pass, and also in the Pir Punjal.

NO. 391. ARVICOLA BLANFORDI. The Gilgit Vole.

HABITAT.--Kashmir territory; Gilgit, at an elevation of 9000 to 10,000 feet.

DESCRIPTION.--Light greyish-brown above, slightly tinged with rufous; greyish-white underneath;
fur soft, the basal three-fourths being slaty grey, the rest fawn colour, in some instances
with black tips, the hairs of the under-parts being white tipped; ears moderately large, well
above the fur, hairy; very long whiskers, chiefly white, a few brown; feet whitish, moderate
size; tail cylindrical, not tapering, and well clad with hair, which project about a fifth
of an inch beyond the end of the vertebrae.

This vole was described by Dr. J. Scully in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History,' for
November, 1880, vol. vi., and he named it after Mr. W. T. Blanford. It is said to be common
on the mountains around Gilgit.

       *       *       *       *       *

The next two species come under the section Paludicola.

NO. 392. ARVICOLA BLYTHII.

HABITAT.--Western Thibet, Leh and Ladakh.

DESCRIPTION.--General colour above yellowish-brown, below pale isabelline; fur soft; basal
two-thirds of the upper hairs, and one-half of the lower hairs, dark slaty; the upper hairs
are tipped, some isabelline and some, which are coarser and longer, dark brown; ears round,
small, equal, with the fur thinly clad with pale brown hairs inside, and more thickly so with
longer hairs outside; upper whiskers dark brown, lower whitish; feet pale isabelline; soles
naked; tail cylindrical, distinctly ringed, covered with short light brown hair like the under-parts
in colour.

SIZE.--Head and body, about 3 to 4 inches; tail, 1 to 1-1/4 inch.

Mr. Blanford has written fully regarding this species, which was the type of Blyth's genus
Phaiomys, in the 'Scientific Results of the Second Yarkand Mission,' page 39, in which he contends,
after going through a mass of literature on the subject, that there are no grounds for constituting
it the type of a new species; and, if this be conceded, then the specific name given by Blyth,
viz. leucurus, being forestalled, it is necessary to rename it, which he has done in honour
of that well-known naturalist.

NO. 393. ARVICOLA MANDARINUS. The Afghan Vole.

HABITAT.--Afghanistan; Chinese Mongolia.

DESCRIPTION.--Light greyish rufescent brown above, white beneath; ears short, hidden by the
fur and hairy; feet whitish; tail rufescent brown.

SIZE.--About 4 inches; tail about 1 inch.

This vole, which is described and figured by Milne-Edwards, is supposed to have been found
in Afghanistan from a specimen in Griffith's collection. A. mandarinus comes from Chinese Mongolia,
and it is figured in the 'Recherches sur les Mammiferes.'

       *       *       *       *       *

The next species was made a separate genus, Neodon, by Hodgson, which has been adopted by Jerdon;
but there are no good grounds for continuing this separation. Mr. Blanford is certainly of
this opinion, and in his remarks on it (see his 'Sc. Results Second Yarkand Mission,' pp. 41-42)
he writes: "The genus Neodon, appears to be founded on characters of only specific importance,
and the type N. Sikimensis is, I think, a true Arvicola."

NO. 394. ARVICOLA SIKIMENSIS. The Sikim Vole (Jerdon's No. 203).

NATIVE NAMES.--Phalchua, Nepalese, apparently Hindi; Cheekyu, Kiranti; Singphuci, Thibetan.

HABITAT.--Nepal; Sikim; Thibet.

DESCRIPTION.--Fur soft and silky. "Deep brownish-black above with a slight rusty shade, minutely
and copiously grizzled with hairs of a deep ferruginous tint" (Horsfield). Or a deep golden
brown from yellow hairs being intermixed; bluish-grey beneath, with a slight fulvous tint;
fur leaden grey for the basal three-fourths, the terminal fourth being brownish or tawny with
some tipped black; the hairs of the under-parts are dipped with dirty white; ears project beyond
the fur moderately, and are hairy; feet very slender; tail thinly clad with short brown hair.
The female has six mammae. Horsfield gives 5 inches for head and body.

According to Jerdon this vole has only been procured in Sikim near Darjeeling, at heights varying
from 7000 to 15,000 feet; but I believe the area it inhabits to be much larger. Hodgson found
his specimens at Darjeeling, and on one occasion got a nest in a hollow tree in the forest;
it was saucer-shaped, of soft grass without any lining, and contained a male, female, and two
young. The latter were "2-1/8 inches long, hairy above, nude below, and blind; the ears also
closed." Jerdon writes: "Mr. Atkinson found it under fallen trees and stones on the top of
Tonglo, near Darjeeling, 10,000 feet, whence also I had a specimen brought me."

       *       *       *       *       *

The next species is one described and figured by Professor Milne-Edwards, and from Thibet he
has two illustrations of it--one of an entire blackish-brown, the other darker above, but with
the black belly.

NO. 395. ARVICOLA MELANOGASTER.

HABITAT.--Moupin in Tibet.

DESCRIPTION.--"It is characterised by the colour of the lower parts, which are a blackish-grey.
The upper parts are sometimes as black as a mole, sometimes grizzled with brown" ('Mammiferes,'
p. 284). The brown specimen with the dark belly is evidently a rarity.

FAMILY SPALACIDAE.

The members of this family are characterised by very large incisors; some have premolars, as
in Bathyergus and two other genera, but not in the Spalacinae, of which our bamboo-rat (Rhizomys)
is the representative in India. "The grinding teeth are rooted, not tuberculate, but with re-entering
enamel folds; infra-orbital opening moderate or small, with no perpendicular plate; occipital
plane high, often sloped boldly forward; palate narrow; form cylindrical; eye and ear-conch
very small, sometimes rudimentary; limbs short and stout; claws large; tail short or absent"
(Alston, 'P. Z. S.' 1876, p. 86). There are two subfamilies--Spalacinae and Bathyerginae.

GENUS RHIZOMYS--THE BAMBOO-RAT.

"Form robust; eyes very small; ears very short, naked; pollex rudimentary; tail rather short,
partially haired; skull broad; occipital plane only slightly sloped forward; infra-orbital
opening small, sub-triangular; upper incisors arched forward; no premolar; upper molars with
one deep internal and two or more external enamel-folds; the lower molars reversed."--Alston.

NO. 396. RHIZOMYS BADIUS. The Chestnut Bamboo-Rat (Jerdon's No. 201).

NATIVE NAME.--Known to the Chingpaws or Kakhyens as the Yewcron.--Anderson.

HABITAT.--The Sikim and Nepal Terai; Burmah; Arakan; Kakhyen Hills.

DESCRIPTION.--Fine fur, of a grey or slaty grey for two-thirds of the basal portion, the remaining
upper third being from a deep to a bright chestnut. "Most intense on the head, and dullest
on the rump" (Anderson). "Below dark ashy grey" (Jerdon). "The fur of the under-parts in these
Eastern examples of the species" (referring to those from the Kakhyen hills) "is paler and
more reddish than chestnut, whereas in some Nepal animals it inclines even to slaty grey, washed
with reddish. The area immediately around the muzzle and the chin is pale brownish, with a
tinge of greyish, and the teeth are brilliant reddish, the nose, ears, feet, and tail being
pale flesh-coloured" (Anderson, 'Anat. and Zool. Res.' p. 329).

SIZE.--Head and body, 7 inches; tail, about 2-1/2 inches.

Jerdon says of this species that "it eats the roots of bamboos and other trees, constructing
burrows under the roots. It is said to be very bold, and easily taken." "In Burmah it constructs
its burrows amongst a rank and tall jungle grass, on the roots of which it is said to live"
(Anderson). Blyth, who writes of the Burmese form, says: "it is barely separable from R. badius,
from which it seems to differ only in its much brighter colouring."

NO. 397. RHIZOMYS ERYTHROGENYS. The Red-cheeked Bamboo-Rat.

HABITAT.--Burmah; the Salween hill tracts; Tenasserim.

DESCRIPTION.--Upper parts dark iron grey; almost black on the top of the head; the upper lip,
chin and upper part of the throat are white, also the chest and belly, which are however more
or less tinged with grey and reddish; the lower portion of the throat is dark grey; the sides
of the head and cheeks are bright golden red; the feet are sparsely clad and leaden coloured,
except the toes of the hind feet, which are fleshy white; tail rather thick at the base, quite
naked, not scaly, and of a leaden hue; claws rather broad, and moderately strong.

SIZE (of the living female).--Head and body, 14-3/4 inches; tail, 5.35 inches.

Dr. Anderson, from whose work I have taken the above description, and who was the first to
describe and name this animal, says that a female was recently received in the Zoological Gardens
from Mr. A. H. Hildebrand.

NO. 398. RHIZOMYS PRUINOSUS. The Hoary Bamboo-Rat.

HABITAT.--Assam; very common about Cherrapoonjee; Burmah; Kakhyen hills east of Bhamo.

DESCRIPTION.--Brown above, grizzled with white; the base of the fur being slaty grey, tipped
with brown, and intermixed with longer hairs, terminating in white bands; underneath much the
same, only the white-tipped hairs are shorter and less numerous; whiskers dark brown; the head
is generally more grey; ears, nose, feet and tail of a dusky flesh tint; tail one-third of
the body.

SIZE.--Head and-body, about 11 to 13 inches; tail, 3 to 4 inches.

NO. 399. RHIZOMYS MINOR. The Small Bamboo-Rat.

NATIVE NAME.--Khai, Aracanese.

HABITAT.--Burmah, Upper Martaban, and at Yanageen on the Irrawaddy.--Blyth.

DESCRIPTION.--"Dark sooty brown above, slightly tinged with deep umber, which is most distinct
on the sides of the head and neck, and in reflected light; the under parts are like the upper,
only the brown tint is almost absent; the whiskers are black, and tail very sparsely haired"
(Anderson). "Dusky brown colour, with white muzzle and around the eye, and pale naked feet"
(Blyth).

Blyth says he obtained a living specimen in Upper Martaban, and recognised it as the same as
what had been obtained in Siam. The Rev. Mr. Mason writes of it: "This animal, which burrows
under old bamboo roots, resembles a marmot more than a rat; yet it has much of the rat in its
habits. I one night caught a specimen gnawing a cocoa-nut, while camping out in the jungles."

       *       *       *       *       *

I may here mention a curious little animal, which is apparently a link between the MURIDAE
and the SPALACIDAE, Myospalax fuscocapillus, named and described by Blyth ('J. A. S. B.' xv.
p. 141), found at Quetta, where it is called the "Quetta mole." A full account of it by Mr.
W. T. Blanford is to be found in the 'Journal Asiatic Society of Bengal,' (vol. L. pt. ii.).

FAMILY DIPODIDAE.

This family contains a form of rodent similar to, yet more pronounced than, the jerboa rats,
of which I have already treated. It includes the true Jerboas (Dipus), the American Jumping
Mice (Zapus), the Alactaga, and the Cape Jumping Hare (Pedetes caffer). The characteristics
of the family are as follows:--

"Incisors compressed; premolars present or absent; grinding teeth rooted or rootless, not tuberculate,
with more or fewer transverse enamel folds; skull with the brain-case short and broad; infra-orbital
opening rounded, very large (often as large as the orbit); zygomatic arch slender, curved downwards;
the malar ascending in front to the lachrymal in a flattened perpendicular plate; facial surface
of maxillaries minutely perforated; mastoid portion of auditory bullae usually greatly developed;
metatarsal bones elongated, often fused into a cannon bone; form gracile; front portion of
body and fore-limbs very small; hind limbs long and strong, with from three to five digits;
tail long, hairy. Three sub-families" (Alston On the Order GLIRES, 'P. Z. S.' 1876). The three
sub-families are Zapodidae,[28] Dipodinae and Pedetinae, but we have only to deal with the second.

[Footnote 28: Formerly Jaculinae.]

GENUS DIPUS--THE JERBOAS.

Hind feet with three digits; tail cylindrical and tufted; incisors grooved; premolars absent,
or, if found, then in the upper jaw and rudimentary; skull with very broad occipital region;
greatly developed auditory bullae; the cervical vertebrae are more or less anchylosed, and
the metatarsals are united. They are not found in the plains of India, though one species inhabits
Yarkand, and two more are found in Eastern Persia.

NO. 400. DIPUS LAGOPUS. The Yarkand Jerboa.

HABITAT.--Koshtak, south of Yarkand; Yarkand; and Yangihissar.--Blanford.

DESCRIPTION.--"Colour above light sandy brown, slightly washed with dusky, below pure white;
a white band across the outside of the thigh; tail pale brown above, whitish below, with a
tuft of longer hair, altogether about 2-1/2 inches long; at the end the terminal portion pure
white, the proximal portion black or dark-brown on the upper part and sides, but brown or white
beneath the tail. The fur is very soft and rather long, 0.6 to 0.8 inch in the middle of the
back; on the upper parts it is ashy grey at the base and for the greater parts of its length,
pale sandy brown near the end; the extreme tip dusky brown; on the lower parts it is white
throughout; ears about half the length of the head, oval, naked inside, thinly clothed with
short brown hair outside; face sandy; the hairs grey at the base; sides of head whitish; whiskers
as usual very long, exceeding three inches; the uppermost brown; the longest white, except
at the base; the lower entirely white; the long hairs beneath the hind feet all white, as are
the feet throughout."--Blanford, 'Sc. Res. of Sec. Yarkand Mission,' pp. 58,59.

GENUS ALACTAGA.

"Hind feet with five digits, of which the first and fifth do not reach the ground; tail cylindrical,
tufted; skull with the occipital region less broad, and the auditory bullae smaller; infra-orbital
opening with no separate canal for the nerve; incisors plain. One very small premolar present
above only."--Alston.

NO. 401. ALACTAGA INDICA.

NATIVE NAME.--Khanee, Afghan.

HABITAT.--Afghanistan; Eastern Persia.

DESCRIPTION.--Fawn colour above; the hair with black tips and ashy grey at the base; under-parts
white; upper parts of thigh white; a black spot behind and inside the thigh just below the
white; remainder of the outside and lower part of the inside of the thighs brown; a white line
running down the front, and extending over the upper portion of the tarsi and feet; proximal
portion of tarsus brown at the sides. (See 'Blanford's Eastern Persia,' vol. ii. p. 77.) The
tail is brown with a white tip; ears thinly clad with brown hairs; head brown above, whitish
around the eyes; whiskers black.

This animal is unfortunately named, as it is not Indian at all; equally unfortunate, as Mr.
Blanford has shown, is Blyth's name Bactrianus, for it does not inhabit that tract, so the
original title stands. Hutton, in his 'Rough Notes on the Zoology of Candahar' ('J. A. S. B.'
xv. p. 137), writes of it as follows: "This beautiful little animal is abundant over all the
stony plains throughout the country, burrowing deeply, and when unearthed bounding away with
most surprising agility after the manner of the kangaroo-rat. It is easily tamed, and lives
happily enough in confinement if furnished with plenty of room to leap about. It sleeps all
day, and so soundly that it may be taken from its cage and examined without awaking it; or
at most it will half open one eye in a drowsy manner for an instant, and immediately close
it again in sleep. It retires to its burrows about the end of October, and remains dormant
till the following April, when it throws off its lethargy and again comes forth." There is
a good engraving of this animal in Cassel's new Natural History.

We have now closed our account of the Myomorpha or Mouse-like Rodents, and will proceed to
the next Section, HYSTRICOMORPHA, or Porcupine-like Rodents.

SECTION III.--HYSTRICOMORPHA. PORCUPINE-LIKE RODENTS.

This section contains six families, viz.:--

  Octodontidae  = 3 sub-families, 18 genera.
  Hystricidae   = 2 sub-families, 5 genera.
  Chinchillidae = 5 genera, of which two are fossil.
  Dasyproctidae = 2 genera.
  Dionymidae    = 1 genus.
  Caviidae      = 3 genera.
