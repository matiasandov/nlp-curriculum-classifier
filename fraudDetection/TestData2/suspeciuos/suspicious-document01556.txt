“Ah, now you mention a most valuable piece of property, for a woman like that—who models her
conduct on the pattern of Aunt Betsey Trotwood, in David Copperfield’s household, is a jewel
of such magnitude and brilliancy, that she will some day be seen sparkling in Abraham’s bosom,
from a distance of millions of miles.”

“Well, how would you cook mothers-in-law?”

“Make a delicious dish of your husband and then take a pinch—a good pinch—of mother-in-law,
and throw her in as ‘sass.’ Speaking of this, remember that too many cooks spoil the broth,
and wife and mother-in-law combined generally make a pretty mess of the husband.”

                                  VI

I was feeling a trifle dull and heavy one afternoon, and after several vain efforts to do good
work, decided that a vigorous tramp would set my blood to flowing, and the wheels of my thinking
mill to revolving. So out I started toward the lake, as usual. There had been a storm off the
Michigan shore, and we were just beginning to get evidence of it, in the big waves that were
tumbling on the beach, I like the lake in this mood—in any mood, indeed, but especially when
it is rough and wild.

After quite a brisk tramp along, or near the beach, I turned back; but before going home again,
I wished to come in closer contact with the tumultuous waters. At risk of being wet by the
spray, which the waves were tossing on high, much as an excited horse tosses the foam from
his chafing mouth, I climbed around the little bathing house, set on the shore end of the pier,
and then boldly walked out, and took my seat in the midst of the tumult.

The passion of the lake was magnificent; far out—as far as eye could stretch—there were oncoming
waves; the clan was gathering, and all in battle array. What an overwhelming charge they made!
Surely no one could resist that onslaught. There was no deliberation, as was usual with a moderately
heavy sea; no calm, inevitable heaving of the water; no steady rising, ever higher and higher,
until it crested, curved, and fell with a boom. There was nothing of this to-day; no preparation;
everything was ready; the warriors, armed and mounted, were already making the attack.

For a time I gloried in it all; even the anger of the waves was more admirable than terrific
in my sight. It seemed as though they interpreted my boldness as defiance, and accepted the
challenge. From near, from far, they were coming, and all upon me, or if that is taking too
much to myself, they were making their attack upon the shore, meaning to claim it for their
own, and incidentally to sweep me, a poor, insignificant atom, from their sight.

By and by I found myself oppressed with the desolation of the scene. As the day waned, and
the chill that foreshadows night fell upon me, or rather rose upon me, from the cold waters,
I began to feel lonely and unprotected. The waves looked so hungry, so cruel; they reached
out and up toward me; they encircled with the inevitable, as with a relentless fate. I began
to be afraid of them, and I rose to go back to shore.

Unlike the ocean, the lake is fixed; but that day the increase of the waves, in height and
fury, had the effect of a rising tide. I realized that it would be very difficult for me to
get off the pier alone, and I was more than relieved to see Randolph Chance, who had come down
for a look at the lake before taking his train to the city. He joined me without trouble; a
man can perform those feats so easily, whereas a woman is physically hampered.

“You’re in rather a bleak place, Miss Leigh,” he said.

“Yes, I have just begun to realize that.”

“Oh, well, we’ll manage to get off safely; but you mustn’t mind a little wetting. Just give
yourself to me, and we’ll be on shore in a minute.”

I gladly did as he bade me; it was luxury just then to have some one as strong and capable
as he take the reins. He led me around the bathing house, and then lifted me from the pier.
As he set me safely on the shore, his eyes met mine, and his look was a revelation to me. I
was, for a moment, too startled to think, and the strangest sensation I ever experienced crept
over me. If a look could speak, Randolph Chance—but I did not put it into words—not then, at
least, but it was all very strange to me—most inexplicable.

We walked on quietly, both, I dare say, feeling our silence to be a trifle awkward. It was
for this reason that I decided to shorten the time of our being together, by stopping at the
house of a friend. The wetting I had received from the waves did not amount to anything for
one so hardy as myself, so I was not deterred on that account.

The house where I stopped was a pleasant resort for me. Both Mr. and Mrs. Bachelor were interesting
people. I had known Mr. Bachelor for fifteen years. He had once been one of our young men,
as the saying is, young merely in the sense of being single, not in actual years, for at the
time I met him he was nearer the forty than the thirty line. Nature seemed to have marked him
for single—cussedness, I had almost said, from the first. He was no favorite with any set,
being grumpy, fussy, and peculiar. But five years after he rose into sight above my horizon
he married a most sensible, lovely woman; not a child, by the way, for she was almost forty;
and in less than no time, it seemed to us, had a family of four children about him, one following
the other so closely that the predecessor was all but overtaken. At first we said among ourselves
that he must have borrowed these infants, and stuck them up in his home for appearance’s sake,
in some such manner as the proprietor of a summer hotel once stuck a number of trees in his
grounds, to make a sandy, barren spot seem fertile and enticing. But by and by we became convinced
that these little human shoots were his very own, not alone because they evinced some disagreeable
crotchets similar to his, but also because of the love he bore them, and the change they wrought
in his character and life. Even around court the man was regarded differently; warmth and esteem
being extended him now in place of the dislike he had formerly aroused. He had never ceased
to be a study to me, and a certain flavor of romance hung about his home—a delightful flavor,
that made it an attractive visiting spot. So it was with considerable pleasure that I called
upon this particular day.

I was shown into the parlor—a comfortable room, back of which was a most home-like apartment,
called the study. As I sat there, awaiting Mrs. Bachelor’s coming, I noticed that her husband’s
desk, which stood in the center of the study, was strewn with dolls, and paraphernalia closely
related thereto. My observations were interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Bachelor, who welcomed
me in her cordial, cheery way. A minute later Mr. Bachelor came in, and gave me what was for
him, a most friendly greeting. He excused himself in a little while, and went into his study.
He had, so his wife explained, been ill with a cold for a day or two, and had been working
at home the while, to make ready for the approaching trial of an important case.

Upon his entering the study, a scene occurred which I shall endeavor to give you as near to
the life as possible. As a matter of course he steered directly for his desk, and his eye immediately
fell upon a quantity of grandchildren, variously disposed thereon.

“Well, I declare!” he exclaimed; “if this isn’t outrageous!” and he gathered up the whole crop—there
were fully a dozen dolls, in all stages of development, and much doll furniture, and toggery
of all kinds.

After dumping the obnoxious elements on to a divan, he returned to his desk, and with much
grumbling sorted out his law-papers, and went to work. But soon after he had cleared his visage,
as it were, his small daughter—a pretty child, four years old—ran into the room hugging two
puggy puppies, and two kittens of tender age. It did not take her long to grasp the situation.
Running to the divan, she uttered a series of cries, indicative both of alarm and displeasure.

“What—what—what is the matter?” said Mr. Bachelor, who had probably forgotten his offense by
this time.

“You naughty papa!” cried the child; “what did you disturve my dollies for?”

“What did you put them on my desk for?” queried her father indignantly; “the idea! I haven’t
a spot on earth I can call my own.”

“You’ve just mussed their best frocks all up,” continued the child, who, without paying the
slightest attention to her father’s vigorous protest, was rapidly replacing her family, puppies,
kittens, and all, on the desk.

“I tell you I can’t have them here! I have important papers around, and I must be allowed to
work in peace. Take them off!”

He started to sweep them on to the floor, but the little girl uttered a shriek.

“Papa, papa, don’t,” she screamed. Then, as he desisted, she added, “They’ve just dot to be
here—it’s the bestest, highest table, and the little doggies and kitties can’t jump off, and
I’m doing to have a tea-party with Mamie Williams. You must put your nasty old papers somewhere
else.”

“This is an outrage!” he exclaimed, standing up and declaiming as if he were in court; “this
is imposition run riot; it has reached a climax, and I’ll endure it no longer. Evidently I
have no rights that even the smallest and youngest in the household is bound to respect. It
is a notorious fact that I am ruled with a rod of iron, and that even this baby of the family
flouts me. I say I will stand it no longer. I have been held with a tight rein, and a curb
bit, but I will turn at last.”

In his excitement, his metaphors became confused, horses and worms being all mixed up in a heap.

“Take the desk, take the whole of it, and to-morrow I shall leave the house! I shall go back
to my bachelor quarters, where I once lived in peace.”

The child regarded him seriously, from out her great, brown eyes.

“Don’t go away, papa,” she said at last, “you may have a little of your desk, if you won’t
take too much. I didn’t mean to be cross at you,” she added, with a pathetic quiver of her lip.

“Well, well!” exclaimed the father hastily, “there, there!” and he laid his hand softly on
her curly little head, “I guess we’ll get on somehow; if I can have a part of the desk, that’ll
answer. It’s big enough for two, I guess.”

And he began moving his papers around.

“Not there, papa,” said the little tyrant; “no, that’s the sunny side, and little bowwow must
be there, ’cause he’s dot the badest cold, and the kitties haven’t dot but little weeny eyes
yet, and they must be where it’s most lightest.”

“Well, well, well, where may I sit? I must get to work.”

“You may sit right there, and you mustn’t fiddet, ’cause you’ll upset dolly’s crib, if you do.”

Soon he was safely bestowed, off on one side, and as he obediently kept to his limitations,
all proceeded happily.

During this domestic scrimmage, Mrs. Bachelor went on chatting in her lively, pleasant fashion
with me, never betraying, in any way, that she overheard the scene in the study. I was so occupied
with it, that I could pay no heed to her remarks; but she was a wise woman, and knew that her
husband was being cooked to a delicious turn, and that any interference on her part, would
spoil the dish. I have since learned that occasionally, when she sees that the fire is really
too hot for him, she comes to his rescue.

“If he sputters and fizzes, don’t be anxious; some husbands do this till they are quite done.”

Evidently Mrs. Bachelor has studied her cook-book.

                                  VII

The little touch of sentiment that flashed, as it were, from Randolph Chance as he lifted me
off the pier, was presently blotted, as far as effect upon me was concerned, by the return
of Miss Sprig to the Purblind household, and the renewal of his attentions to her. At least
I regarded them as renewed, and I coldly turned my back upon him, and let him go his way, without
further thought or speculation.

I was daily becoming more interested in another acquaintance—Mr. Gregory, a man of years, whom
I had known for some time. He had been a visitor at our house when my parents were living,
and had, from time to time, shown me friendly attentions since their death. He frequently invited
me to places of entertainment, something Randolph Chance seldom did, and in many ways contributed
to my comfort and happiness. Single women are very dependent upon their men friends for pleasures
of this sort; few of them care to go out at night alone, and even when they go in company with
each other, the occasion lacks a zest which belongs to it when a woman has an escort. It is
strange that many men—many of those who believe in the dependence of women, fall into the selfish
habit of going alone to theater, concert, and lecture, and so force the women of their acquaintance
into a position which their sentiments would seem to deprecate.

While in no way obtrusive, or gushing in his attentions, Mr. Gregory was most thoughtful and
kind, and few women are without appreciation of conduct of this type.

Life flowed on with me with a quiet current. I was not a woman to make scenes with myself or
others, and my circumstances were such as to permit of an undisturbed tenor of way.

One bright afternoon, just as I returned from a long walk, Mrs. Purblind ran over to see me,
and soon afterward, Mrs. Cynic dropped in. I never could bear this latter woman; something
malevolent seems to emanate from her; something that is more or less unhealthful to the moral
nature of all who come in contact with it, just as the miasma from a swamp is poisonous to
the physical being.

It chanced that I had just finished writing a little story, drawn from the life-page of my
domestic experience; it was so endeared to my memory that I was not like to forget it, and
yet, in the course of years, its outlines would probably fade a trifle if I did not take care
to preserve their distinctness; for that reason I had written it out.

I ought to have had better sense than to read anything of this kind to Mrs. Cynic. In the presence
of such people, that which is fresh, beautiful, and holy withers, as a cluster of dewy wild
flowers is parched and killed by the hot, sterile breath of a furnace.

Usually I have some judgment in such matters, but that day all discretion seemed to take wings.

A remark of Mrs. Purblind’s led up to the subject. This little woman can say ugly things at
times, but they are stung out of her, as it were, by some particular hurt, and are not the
expression of her real nature. She has a kind, good heart, though her judgment and tact are
somewhat lacking.

We happened to be speaking of men, and something was said about their capacity for devotion,
when Mrs. Purblind exclaimed:

“Devotion! the masculine nature doesn’t know the meaning of the word, unless it is devotion
to self.”

“I must read you a little story I’ve written to-day. It’s a true one, remember—I think I shall
call it, ‘Devotion’.”

I went to my desk, took out the manuscript, and read as follows:
