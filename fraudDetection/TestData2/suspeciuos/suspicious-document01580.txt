Philip leaned back wearily in the armchair he had chosen. He was beat. Take six days a week,
ten hours a day, and multiply by fifty-two and you get three hundred and twelve. Three hundred
and twelve days a year, hunting down clients, talking, walking, driving, expounding; trying
in his early thirties to build the foundation he should have begun building in his early twenties--the
foundation for the family he had suddenly realized he wanted and someday hoped to have. Sometimes
he wished that ambition had missed him altogether instead of waiting for so long to strike.
Sometimes he wished he could have gone right on being what he once had been. After all, there
was nothing wrong in living in cheap hotels and even cheaper rooming houses; there was nothing
wrong in being a lackadaisical door-to-door salesman with run-down heels.

Nothing wrong, that is, except the aching want that came over you sometimes, and the loneliness
of long and empty evenings.

Zarathustra had re-entered the room and was sitting in the middle of the floor again. He had
not returned empty-handed--or rather, empty-mouthed--although the object he had brought with
him was not the sort of object dogs generally pick up. It was a rose--

A green rose.

       *       *       *       *       *

Disbelievingly, Philip leaned forward and took it from the animal's mouth. Before he had a
chance to examine it, however, footsteps sounded in the next room, and prompted by he knew
not what, he thrust the rose into his suitcoat pocket. An instant later, Judith Darrow came
through the archway bearing a large tray. After setting it down on the coffee table, she poured
two cups of coffee from a little silver pot and indicated a plate of sandwiches. "Please help
yourself," she said.

She sat down in the other chair and sipped her coffee. He had one of the sandwiches, found
that he didn't want any more. Somehow, her proximity, coupled with her silence, made him feel
uncomfortable. "Has your husband already left for Pfleugersville?" he asked politely.

Her gray-green eyes grew cold. "Yes, he left quite some time ago," she said. "A year ago, as
a matter of fact. But for parts unknown, not Pfleugersville. Pfleugersville wasn't accessible
then, anyway. He had a brunette on one arm, a redhead on the other, and a pint of Cutty Sark
in his hip pocket."

Philip was distressed. "I ... I didn't mean to pry," he said. "I'm--"

"Sorry? Why should you be? Some men are born to settle down and raise children and others are
born to drink and philander. It's as simple as that."

"Is it?" something made Philip ask. "Into which category would you say I fall?"

"You're in a class by yourself." Tiny silver flecks had come into her eyes, and he realized
to his astonishment that they were flecks of malevolence. "You've never married, but playing
the field hasn't made you one hundred per cent cynical. You're still convinced that somewhere
there is a woman worthy of your devotion. And you're quite right--the world is full of them."

His face tingled as though she had slapped it, and in a sense, she had. He restrained his anger
with difficulty. "I didn't know that my celibacy was that noticeable," he said.

"It isn't. I took the liberty of having a private investigator check into your background.
It proved to be unsavory in some respects, as I implied before, but unlike the backgrounds
of the other real-estate agents I had checked, it contained not the slightest hint of dishonesty.
The nature of my business is such that I need someone of maximum integrity to contract it with.
I had to go far and wide to find you."

"You're being unfair," Philip said, mollified despite himself. "Most real-estate agents are
honest. As a matter of fact, there's one in the same office building with me that I'd trust
with the family jewels--if I had any family jewels."

"Good," Judith Darrow said. "I gambled on you knowing someone like that."

He waited for her to elaborate, and when she did not he finished his coffee and stood up. "If
you don't mind, I'll turn in," he said. "I've had a pretty hard day."

"I'll show you your room."

She got two candles, lit them, and after placing them in gilt candlesticks, handed one of the
candlesticks to him. The room was on the third floor in under the eaves--as faraway from hers,
probably, as the size of the house permitted. Philip did not mind. He liked to sleep in rooms
under eaves. There was an enchantment about the rain on the roof that people who slept in less
celestial bowers never got to know. After Judith left, he threw open the single window and
undressed and climbed into bed. Remembering the rose, he got it out of his coat pocket and
examined it by candlelight. It was green all right--even greener than he had at first thought.
Its scent was reminiscent of the summer breeze that was blowing through the downstairs rooms,
though not at all in keeping with the chill October air that was coming through his bedroom
window. He laid it on the table beside the bed and blew out the candle. He would go looking
for the bush tomorrow.

       *       *       *       *       *

Philip was an early riser, and dawn had not yet departed when, fully dressed, he left the room
with the rose in his coat pocket and quietly descended the stairs. Entering the living room,
he found Zarathustra curled up in one of the armchairs, and for a moment he had the eerie impression
that the animal had extended one of his shaggy ears and was scratching his back with it. When
Philip did a doubletake, however, the ear was back to normal size and reposing on its owner's
tawny cheek. Rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, he said, "Come on, Zarathustra, we're going
for a walk."

He headed for the back door, Zarathustra at his heels. A double door leading off the dining
room barred his way and proved to be locked. Frowning, he returned to the living room. "All
right," he said to Zarathustra, "we'll go out the front way then."

He walked around the side of the house, his canine companion trotting beside him. The side
yard turned out to be disappointing. It contained no roses--green ones, or any other kind.
About all it did contain that was worthy of notice was a dog house--an ancient affair that
was much too large for Zarathustra and which probably dated from the days when Judith had owned
a larger dog. The yard itself was a mess: the grass hadn't been cut all summer, the shrubbery
was ragged, and dead leaves lay everywhere. A similar state of affairs existed next door, and
glancing across lots, he saw that the same desuetude prevailed throughout the entire neighborhood.
Obviously the good citizens of Valleyview had lost interest in their real estate long before
they had moved out.

At length his explorations led him to the back door. If there were green roses anywhere, the
trellis that adorned the small back porch was the logical place for them to be. He found nothing
but bedraggled Virginia creeper and more dead leaves.

He tried the back door, and finding it locked, circled the rest of the way around the house.
Judith was waiting for him on the front porch. "How nice of you to walk Zarathustra," she said
icily. "I do hope you found the yard in order."

The yellow dress she was wearing did not match the tone of her voice, and the frilly blue apron
tied round her waist belied the frostiness of her gray-green eyes. Nevertheless, her rancor
was real. "Sorry," he said. "I didn't know your back yard was out of bounds." Then, "If you'll
give me a list of the places you want evaluated, I'll get started right away."

"I'll take you around again personally--after we have breakfast."

Again he was consigned to the living room while she performed the necessary culinary operations,
and again she served him by tray. Clearly she did not want him in the kitchen, or anywhere
near it. He was not much of a one for mysteries, but this one was intriguing him more and more
by the minute.

Breakfast over, she told him to wait on the front porch while she did the dishes, and instructed
Zarathustra to keep him company. She had two voices: the one she used in addressing Zarathustra
contained overtones of summer, and the one she used in addressing Philip contained overtones
of fall. "Some day," Philip told the little dog, "that chip she carries on her shoulder is
going to fall off of its own accord, and by then it will be too late--the way it was too late
for me when I found out that the person I'd been running away from all my life was myself in
wolf's clothing."

"Ruf," said Zarathustra, looking up at him with benign golden eyes. "Ruf-ruf!"

       *       *       *       *       *

Presently Judith re-appeared, sans apron, and the three of them set forth into the golden October
day. It was Philip's first experience in evaluating an entire village, but he had a knack for
estimating the worth of property, and by the time noon came around, he had the job half done.
"If you people had made even half an effort to keep your places up," he told Judith over cold-cut
sandwiches and coffee in her living room, "we could have asked for a third again as much. Why
in the world did you let everything go to pot just because you were moving some place else?"

She shrugged. "It's hard to get anyone to do housework these days--not to mention gardening.
Besides, in addition to the servant problem, there's another consideration--human nature. When
you've lived in a shack all your life and you suddenly acquire a palace, you cease caring very
much what the shack looks like."

"Shack!" Philip was indignant. "Why, this house is lovely! Practically every house you've shown
me is lovely. Old, yes--but oldness is an essential part of the loveliness of houses. If Pfleugersville
is on the order of most housing developments I've seen, you and your neighbors are going to
be good and sorry one of these fine days!"

"But Pfleugersville isn't on the order of most housing developments you've seen. In fact, it's
not a housing development at all. But let's not go into that. Anyway, we're concerned with
Valleyview, not Pfleugersville."

"Very well," Philip said. "This afternoon should wind things up so far as the appraising goes."

       *       *       *       *       *

That evening, after a coffee-less supper--both the gas and the water had been turned off that
afternoon--he totaled up his figures. They made quite a respectable sum. He looked across the
coffee table, which he had commandeered as a desk, to where Judith, with the dubious help of
Zarathustra, was sorting out a pile of manila envelopes which she had placed in the middle
of the living-room floor. "I'll do my best to sell everything," he said, "but it's going to
be difficult going till we get a few families living here. People are reluctant about moving
into empty neighborhoods, and businessmen aren't keen about opening up business places before
the customers are available. But I think it'll work out all right. There's a plaza not far
from here that will provide a place to shop until the local markets are functioning, and Valleyview
is part of a centralized school district." He slipped the paper he had been figuring on into
his brief case, closed the case and stood up. "I'll keep in touch with you."

Judith shook her head. "You'll do nothing of the sort. As soon as you leave, I'm moving to
Pfleugersville. My business here is finished."

"I'll keep in touch with you there then. All you have to do is give me your address and phone
number."

She shook her head again. "I could give you both, but neither would do you any good. But that's
beside the point. Valleyview is your responsibility now--not mine."

Philip sat back down again. "You can start explaining any time," he said.

"It's very simple. The property owners of Valleyview signed all of their houses and places
of business over to me. I, in turn, have signed all of them over to you--with the qualification,
of course, that after selling them you will be entitled to no more than your usual commission."
She withdrew a paper from one of the manila envelopes. "After selling them," she went on, "you
are to divide the proceeds equally among the four charities specified in this contract." She
handed him the paper. "Do you understand now why I tried so hard to find a trustworthy agent?"

Philip was staring at the paper, unable, in his astonishment, to read the words it contained.
"Suppose," he said presently, "that circumstances should make it impossible for me to carry
out my end of the agreement?"

"In case of illness, you will already have taken the necessary steps to transfer the property
to another agent who, in your opinion, is as completely honest as you are, and in case of death,
you will already have taken the necessary steps to bequeath the property to the same agent;
and he, in both cases, will already have agreed to the terms laid down in the contract you're
holding in your hands. Why don't you read it?"

       *       *       *       *       *

Now that his astonishment had abated somewhat, Philip found that he could do so. "But this
still doesn't make sense," he said a short while later. "Obviously you and the rest of the
owners have purchased new houses. Would it be presumptuous of me to ask how you're going to
pay for them when you're virtually giving your old houses away?"

"I'm afraid it would be, Mr. Myles." She withdrew another paper from the envelope and handed
it to him. "This is the other copy. If you'll kindly affix your signature to both, we can bring
our business to a close. As you'll notice, I've already signed."

"But if you're going to be incommunicado," Philip pointed out, anger building up in him despite
all he could do to stop it, "what good will your copy do you?"

Judith's countenance took on a glacial quality. So did her voice. "My copy will go into the
hands of a trusted attorney, sealed in an envelope which I have already instructed him not
to open till five years from this date. If, at the time it is opened, you have violated the
terms of our agreement, he will institute legal proceedings at once. Fortunately, although
the Valleyview post office is closed, a mail truck passes through every weekday evening at
eight. It's not that I don't trust you, Mr. Myles--but you are a man, you know."

Philip was tempted to tear up the two copies then and there, and toss the pieces into the air.
But he didn't, for the very good reason that he couldn't afford to. Instead, he bore down viciously
on his pen and brought his name to life twice in large and angry letters. He handed Judith
one copy, slipped the other into his breast pocket and got to his feet. "That," he said, "brings
our official business to a close. Now I'd like to add an unofficial word of advice. It seems
to me that you're exacting an exorbitant price from the world for your husband's having sold
you out for a brunette and a redhead and a pint of Scotch. I've been sold out lots of times
for less than that, but I found out long ago that the world doesn't pay its bills even when
you ask a fair price for the damages done to you. I suggest that you write the matter off as
a bad debt and forget about it; then maybe you'll become a human being again."

She had risen to her feet and was standing stiffly before him. She put him in mind of an exquisite
and fragile statue, and for a moment he had the feeling that if he were to reach out and touch
her, she would shatter into a million pieces. She did not move for some time, nor did he; then
she bent down, picked up three of the manila envelopes, straightened, and handed them to him.
"Two of these contain the deeds, maps and other records you will need," she said in a dead
voice. "The third contains the keys to the houses and business places. Each key is tagged with
the correct address. Good-by, Mr. Myles."

"Good-by," Philip said.

He looked around the room intending to say good-by to Zarathustra, but Zarathustra was nowhere
to be seen. Finally he went into the hall, opened the front door and stepped out into the night.
A full moon was rising in the east. He walked down the moonlit walk, climbed into his car and
threw his brief case and the manila envelopes into the back seat. Soon, Valleyview was far
behind him.

But not as far as it should have been. He couldn't get the green rose out of his mind. He couldn't
get Judith Darrow out of his mind either. Nor could he exorcise the summer breeze that kept
wafting through the crevices in his common sense.

A green rose and a grass widow and a breeze with a green breath. A whole town taking off for
greener pastures....

He reached into his coat pocket and touched the rose. It was no more than a stem and a handful
of petals now, but its reality could not be denied. But roses do not bloom in autumn, and green
roses do not bloom at all--

"Ruf!"

He had turned into the new highway some time ago, and was driving along it at a brisk sixty-five.
Now, disbelievingly, he slowed, and pulled over onto the shoulder. Sure enough, he had a stowaway
in the back seat--a tawny-haired stowaway with golden eyes, over-sized ears, and a restless,
white-tipped tail. "Zarathustra!" he gasped. "How in the dickens did you get in there?"

"Ruf," Zarathustra replied.

Philip groaned. Now he would have to go all the way back to Valleyview. Now he would have to
see Judith Darrow again. Now he would have to--He paused in midthought, astonished at the abrupt
acceleration of his heartbeat. "Well I'll be damned!" he said, and without further preamble
transferred Zarathustra to the front seat, U-turned, and started back.

       *       *       *       *       *

The gasoline lantern had been moved out of the living-room window, but a light still showed
beyond the panes. He pulled over to the curb and turned off the ignition. He gave one of Zarathustra's
over-sized ears a playful tug, absently noting a series of small nodules along its lower extremity.
"Come on, Zarathustra," he said. "I may as well deliver you personally while I'm at it."

After locking the car, he started up the walk, Zarathustra at his heels. He knocked on the
front door. Presently he knocked again. The door creaked, swung partially open. He frowned.
Had she forgotten to latch it? he wondered. Or had she deliberately left it unlatched so that
Zarathustra could get in? Zarathustra himself lent plausibility to the latter conjecture by
rising up on his hind legs and pushing the door the rest of the way open with his forepaws,
after which he trotted into the hall and disappeared.

Philip pounded on the panels. "Miss Darrow!" he called. "Judith!"

No answer. He called again. Still no answer.

A summer breeze came traipsing out of the house and engulfed him in the scent of roses. What
kind of roses? he wondered. Green ones?

He stepped into the hall and closed the door behind him. He made his way into the living room.
The two chairs were gone, and so was the coffee table. He walked through the living room and
into the library; through the library and into the dining room. The gasoline lantern burned
brightly on the dining-room table, its harsh white light bathing bare floors and naked walls.
