Of course, in winter time, or in the late fall or early spring, when the sun-dogs appear, that
is a pretty sure sign of cold weather. The old woman had come home at night. When she entered the room in the morning, recognized they
immediately that something was wrong happened. Her heart was inflamed with anger; she let
her daughters one after another come forward and demanded justice. The saying is that only fools
and Indians predict weather, in the mountains!

Note 23, page 39: Scouts as well as anybody else should have their teeth approved of by a dentist,
before starting out on the long trail. The tooth-ache saps the strength, and a cavity might
result in a serious abscess, far from proper treatment.

Note 24, page 40: In the thick timber where there are many trees the chance of course is less
that the tree which you are under will be struck by the lightning. But to seek refuge under
any tree, in a field or other open place, is dangerous. Many persons are killed, every summer,
by seeking some lone tree or small clump of trees, or a high-standing tree, in a thunder-storm.

Note 25, page 47: The low soft spot is not so good as the high hard spot, to sleep on. Green
grass is damp, and softness gathers dampness. Cowboys and rangers always spread their beds
on a little elevation, where the ground is drier and where there is a breeze for ventilation
and to keep the insects away.

Note 26, page 49: Nobody can cook by a big fire, without cooking himself too! The smaller the
fire the better, as long as it is enough. Just a handful of twigs at a time will cook coffee
or roast a chunk of meat. It is an old scout saying that "Little wood feeds the fire, much
wood puts it out." Cook by coals rather than by flame. In the West cedar makes the best coals,
the cleanest flame; sage makes a very hot fire, and burns to ashes which hold the fire, but
it does not give hard coals. Anything pitchy smokes the camp.

In the mountains meat wrapped in a gunnysack or a tarpaulin, to protect from the flies, and
hung in the shade and particularly in a tree where the air circulates, will keep a long, long time.

Note 27, page 49: The brass eyes in the edges of the Elk Scouts' tarps here would come into
good use for stretching the tarp as a low "A" shelter-tent or dog-tent. The small shelter-tents
of the United States Army are called by the soldiers "pup" tents.

Note 28, page 53: The notion that many persons have, of taking guns with them into the mountains
or the hills, for protection from wild animals, is a foolish notion. In this day and age the
wild animals have been so disciplined by man that they are afraid of him. They would rather
run than fight; and throughout the greater part of the United States in North America the animals
who could be dangerous are scarce. Guns do much more harm than the animals themselves; and
it is the wounded animal which is dangerous. To pack a big gun on the ordinary trail through
the wilderness country West or East is the mark of a tenderfoot, unless the gun is needed for
meat. Many and many a seasoned wilderness dweller--ranger, cowboy, rancher, prospector--travels
afoot or horseback day after day, night after night, and never carries a gun, never needs a gun.

CHAPTER VI

Note 29, page 61: One of the regulations of the United States Army Pack Transportation Department
says that packers must treat all the mules kindly, for a mule remembers kindness and never
forgets injury. Packers must not even throw stones, to drive a mule into line. Of course, Boy
Scouts know that kindness with animals always wins out over harshness, and that there is no
greater cowardliness than the abuse of a helpless beast.

Note 30, page 62: Highness and dryness, wood and water, and grazing for the animals are the
requirements of the Scouts' camp on the pack trail.

Note 31, page 63: By camp law bird or four-foot or other harmless animals within say two hundred
yards of camp is safe from injury by man. This also prevents reckless shooting about camp.
The wild life near camp is one of the chief charms of camping in the wilderness. No Scout wishes
to leave a trail of blood and murder and suffering, to mark his progress through meadow and timber.

Note 32, page 67: This division of watches or guards should be noted by Scouts. Bed-mates or
bunkies should not follow one another on guard; for A wakes B when he crawls out; and after
he has changed with B, and has slept two or three hours, he is waked again by B crawling in.
But each Scout listed for guard duty should so be listed that he is not disturbed through at
least two of the watches. 

The dark man stood with folded arms before him. "Your Nordland Ross," said he, "it is still a
long way fast enough."

"Dear Hager, let me live!" cried the boy again, "when I grow up, I
will my Castle and give all the beautiful forests, which belong to it!

"

"The sooner I will get yet," said the colonel.

As the boy lowered his head and shouted: "I give myself to the merciful God!"

"That was the right word!" said the evil man, but the boy jumped up and again flew on the walls
of the chamber along, the Colonel ran him like a venison. But when they came to the curtained
mirror, the boy's feet became entangled in the shroud that he suddenly crashed to the ground.
There was the evil man-about him. At the same moment - so is told - when he raised his arm
to punch and protective of the little boy hands about crossed his
heart, the old caretaker was deep in the rear of crate of the basement,
where a servant was busy with the bleed of a barrel Ingelheim.

"Have you heard nothing, Casper, "he said and put the lamp, which he held in his hand, on the
barrel

The servant shook his head. "I was," said the old man, "when I heard the squire Kuno call my
name. "

"You are mistaken, Master," replied the servant; "! Here listens to anything below"

For a while it was on, cried the old man again: "To God, Casper, as it has me again called, and
that was a cry from my throat Junkers "!

The servant went on with
his work. "I hear only run the red wine from the barrel," he said.

But
the old man did not calm down, he went up to the castle, he went from
door to door, first in the ground floor and then upstairs in the upper
floor. When he the door the remote armories opened the door, he flashed
the mirror opposite of the Cyprian, on the evening the sun was shining.
 But
of course there are two sides to a parole; and if it is not accepted as honestly as it is given,
then there is no bargain. But if there is the slightest doubt or argument, then the Scout ought
to stay a prisoner, rather than escape with dishonor, charged with breaking his word. That
the other fellow is dishonest is no excuse for the Scout being dishonest, too.

Note 37, page 89: The sign for escape is this: Bridger crossed his wrists, with his fists doubled,
and wrenched them apart, upward, as if breaking a cord binding them. He may have used the "Go"
sign, which is the hand extended, edge up, in front of the hip, and pushed forward with an
upward motion, as if climbing a trail.

Note 38, page 94: An old scout method of tying a prisoner's arms behind his back is to place
the hands there with their backs together, and to tie the thumbs and the little fingers! This
requires only ordinary cord and not much of it, and even a strip from a handkerchief will do.
To prevent the prisoner from running away, he may be stood up against a tree and his arms passed
behind that, before the hands are tied.

CHAPTER IX

Note 39, page 100: Persons who are lost and are going it blindly on foot usually keep inclining
to the left, because they step a little farther with the right foot than with the left. After
a time they complete a circle. Scouts should watch themselves and note whether they are making
toward the left or not. Horses, too, are supposed to circle toward the left. But all this applies
chiefly to the level country. In the mountains and hills the course is irregular, as the person
or horse climbs up and down, picking the easier way. And on a slope anybody is always slipping
downward a little, on a slant toward the bottom, unless he lines his trail by a tree or rock.

Scouts when they think that they are lost should hold to their good sense. If they feel themselves
growing panicky, they had better sit down and wait until they can reason things out. The Scout
who takes matters easy can get along for a couple of days until he is found or has worked himself
free; but the Scout who runs and chases and sobs and shrieks wears himself down so that he
is no good.

To be lost among the hills or mountains is much less serious than to be lost upon the flat
plains. The mountains and hills have landmarks; the plains have maybe none. In the mountains
and hills the Scout who is looking for camp or companions should get up on a ridge, and make
a smoke--the two-smoke "lost" signal--and wait, and look for other smokes. If he feels that
he must travel, because camp is too far or cannot see his smoke, or does not suspect that he
is lost, his best plan is to strike a stream and stick to it until it brings him out. Travel
by a stream is sometimes jungly; but in the mountains, ranches and cabins are located beside
streams. Downstream is of course the easier direction.

It is a bad plan to try short cuts, when finding a way. The Scout may think that by leaving
a trail or a stream and striking off up a draw or over a point he will save distance. But there
is the chance that he will not come out where he expects to come out, and that he will be in
a worse fix than before. When a course is once decided upon, the Scout should follow it through,
taking it as easy as possible.

Note 40, page 106: Old-time scouts had to make all their fires by flint and steel; and it is
well for modern Scouts to practice this. When the ground is too wet, and would be apt to put
out the little blaze, the fire can be started in a frying-pan. Matches are very convenient,
but they must be warded from dampness. They can be carried in a corked bottle; they can be
dipped, before leaving home, in melted paraffin, which will coat them water-proof; and dampness
can be rubbed out of them by friction by rolling them rapidly between the palms of the hands
and scratching them quick. When every object is soaked through, matches (if dry) may be lighted
upon a stone which has been rubbed violently against another stone.

If the Scout has a rifle or pistol or gun, then he can make a fire by shooting powder into
a bunch of tinder--raveled handkerchief or coat lining, or frazzled cedar bark. The bullet
or the shot should be drawn out of the cartridge, and the powder made loose, and the tinder
should be fastened so that it will not be blown away.

In the rain a blanket or coat or hat should be held over the little blaze, until the flames
are strong.

It was the old-time scouts who taught even the Indians to make fire by flint and steel, or
by two flints. Two chunks of granite, especially when iron is contained, will answer. The Indians
previously had used fire-sticks and were very careful to save coals. But they saw that "knocking
fire out of rocks" was much easier.

Note 41, page 108: Scouts of course know the Big Dipper or the Great Bear, and the Little Dipper
or the Little Bear, in the sky. The Big Dipper points to the North Star or Pole Star, and the
North Star or Pole Star is the star in the end of the handle of the Little Dipper. These two
formations up above are the Clock of the Heavens.

The "Guardians of the Pole" are the two stars which make the bottom of the cup of the Big Dipper.
They are supposed to be sentinels marching around and around the tent of the North Star, as
they are carried along by the Big Dipper. For the stars of the Big and the Little Dipper, like
all the other stars, circuit the North Star once in about every twenty-four hours.

But the old-time scouts of plains and mountains told time by the "Pointers," which are the
two bright stars forming the end of the cup of the Big Dipper. These point to the Pole Star,
and they move just as the "Guardians of the Pole" move. They are easier to watch than the "Guardians
of the Pole," and are more like an hour-hand. With every hour they, and the "Guardians of the
Pole," and all the Dipper stars move in the same direction as the sun one and one-half the
distance between the stars forming the top of the Big Dipper's cup. The Scout with a good memory
and a good eye for distance can guess pretty nearly how time passes.

He has another method, too. The circuit of the stars is not quite the same as the circuit of
the sun; for the stars swing about from starting-place to starting-place in about four minutes
less than twenty-four hours, so that every month they gain 120 minutes, or two hours. On May
1, at nine in the evening, the "Pointers" of the Big Dipper are straight overhead, and point
downward at the Pole Star, and if we could see them twelve hours later, or at nine in the morning,
we should find them opposite, below the Pole Star, and pointing up at it. On June 1, they would
arrive overhead two hours earlier, or at seven in the evening, and by nine o'clock would be
west of overhead, while at seven and nine in the morning they would be opposite, or halfway
around. On August 1 their halfway places would be at three in the afternoon and three in the
morning.

So, figuring each month, and knowing where the "Pointers" are at nine, or at midnight, or at
three in the morning, the Scout can read, for several nights running without appreciable change,
what time it is. And on the plains the old trappers were accustomed to look up out of their
buffalo-robes and say, "By the Pointers it is midnight."

The Big Dipper swings on such a wide circle that sometimes it drops into the hills or into
mist. The Little Dipper stays high in the sky. Therefore sailors choose the two brighter stars
in the end of the cup of the Little Dipper, and watch them, for an hour-hand.

The Blackfeet Indians call the Big Dipper the Seven Brothers, and they, and also other plains
people such as sheep-herders and cowboys, tell the time by the "Last Brother," which is the
star in the end of the handle. "The Last Brother is pointing to the east," or "The Last Brother
is pointing downwards to the prairie," say the Indians. And by that they mean the hour is so
and so.

Note 42, page 109: The "Papoose on the old Squaw's Back" is a tiny star, Alcor, very close
to the star Mizar which forms the bend in the handle of the Big Dipper. To see this tiny star
is a test for eyesight. The Sioux Indians say that the Big Dipper is four warriors carrying
a funeral bier, followed by a train of mourners. The second star in the train (or the star
in the bend) is the widow of the slain brave, with her little child, or the Little Sister,
weeping beside her!

The Blackfeet and other Indians say that the Pole Star (which does not move) is a hole in the
sky, through which streams the light from the magical country beyond. They call it "the star
that stands still."

By the "Lost Children" Jim Bridger meant the Pleiades. These stars, forming a cluster or nebula,
sink below the western horizon in the spring and do not appear in the sky again until autumn;
and the following is the reason why. They were once six children in a Blackfeet camp. The Blackfeet
hunters had killed many buffalo, and among them some buffalo calves. The little yellow hides
of the buffalo calves were given to the children of the camp to play with, but six of the children
were poor and did not get any. The other children made much fun of the six, and plagued them
so that they drove them out of the camp. After wandering ashamed and afraid on the prairie,
the six finally were taken up into the sky. So they are not seen in the spring and summer,
when the buffalo calves are yellow; but in the autumn and winter, when the buffalo calves are
black, they come out.

Nearly everybody can see the six stars of the Pleiades, and good eyesight can make out seven.
By turning the head and gazing sideways the seven are made plainer. An English girl has eyesight
so remarkable that she has counted twelve.

The Western Indians have had names for many of the stars and the planets and the constellations,
and the night sky has been of much company and use to them and to the old plainsmen and mountaineers,
just as it was to Jim Bridger at this time.

Mars is "Big-Fire-Star"; Jupiter is "Morning Star," or when evening star is "The Lance"; Venus
is "Day Star," because sometimes it is so bright that it can be seen in the day. Scouts should
know by the almanac what is the morning star, and then when it rises over the camp or the trail
they are told that morning is at hand.

Note 43, page 110: Sunday comes to the trail, to the mountains and plains and field and forest,
just as often as to the town and the farm. The Scout will feel much better, mentally and physically,
when he observes Sunday. This one day in the seven can be made different by a change from the
ordinary routine: by a good cleaning up; by only a short march, just enough for exercise; by
a whole day in camp, if possible; by an avoidance of harm to bird or beast; by some especial
arrangement, which will say, "This is Sunday." The real Jedediah Smith, fur-hunter and explorer,
found as much profit in his Bible as in his rifle, amidst the wilderness; and the Scout of
to-day should include the Bible in the outfit. It reads well out in the great open, it is full
of nature lore of sky and water and earth, and it is a great comforter and sweetener of trail
and camp.

CHAPTER X

Note 44, page 112: The smoke signal has been in use for many, many years. The Indians of the
West used it much, and whenever an army detachment or other strangers traversed the plains
and the hills their course was marked by the smoke signals of Indian scouts. To make smoke
signals, first a moderate blaze is started; then damp or green stuff is piled on, for a smudge;
and the column of smoke is cut into puffs by a blanket or coat held over like a cup and suddenly
jerked off. A high place should be selected for the smoke signal, so as to distinguish it from
the ordinary camp-fire, which is not as a rule made on a high place,--that is, in hostile country.
A still day is necessary for accurate smoke signaling. This signaling is being recommended
for the United States Forestry Service, so that Rangers and Guards can telegraph warnings and
news by the Morse or the Army and Navy alphabet. A short puff would be the dot, a long puff
the dash; or one short puff would be "1," two short puffs close together "2," and a long puff
"3." This Army and Navy code is explained under Note 48.

The Indians had secret codes, for the smoke signals; and used dense smokes and thin smokes,
both. Green pine and spruce and fire boughs raise a thick black smoke.

In army scouting on the plains the following signals were customary:

"Wish to communicate." Three smokes side by side.

"Enemy discovered." Two puffs, repeated at fifteen-minute intervals. Boy Scouts need not have
the intervals so long. One minute is enough, for a standard.

"Many enemy discovered." Three puffs, at intervals.

"Come to council," or "Join forces." Four puffs, repeated.

"March to the north." Two smokes, of two puffs each.

"March to the south." Two smokes, of three puffs each.

"March to the east." Three smokes, of two puffs each.

"March to the west." Three smokes, of three puffs each.

Plainsmen and woodsmen understand the following signals also:

"Camp is here." One smoke, one puff at intervals.

"Help. I am lost." Two fires, occasional single puffs.

"Good news." Three steady smokes.

Scouts' patrols can invent their own code of smokes, by number of smokes, by puffs, and by
intervals between puffs. Of course, the single fire is much more easily managed by one person.

Note 45, page 116: The Red Fox Scouts probably carried with them a liquid carbolic and antiseptic
soap, which comes put up in small bottles with patent shaker stoppers. A few drops of this
in some water makes a splendid wash for wounds, and is harmless. Druggists and surgical supply
stores can furnish Scouts with this soap. Being non-poisonous, good for a gargle as well as
for external use, it is superior to many other antiseptic washes. A spool of surgeons' adhesive
tape, say three-quarter inch wide, a roll of sterilized absorbent cotton, and a roll of sterilized
gauze will of course be included in the Scouts' first-aid kit.

CHAPTER XI

Note 46, page 124: Bichloride of mercury is a strong antiseptic, and much favored for disinfecting
dishes and other vessels used by sick people. It is convenient to carry, in a form known as
Bernay's tablets. They come white or blue, and one is dissolved in water to make a solution.
They are very poisonous, internally, and Scouts must look out that none of the solution enters
the stomach. Of course, there are many antiseptic substances for washing wounds: potash and
borax are good, especially in the form of potassium permanganate and boric acid. Anything in
a tablet or a powdery form is easier to pack than anything in a liquid form. What happened? "

The boy stirred the faded lips. "It has done me a blow on his heart," he stammered.

"Who, who did?" whispered the mother. "Wolf, speak a single word yet, who has done? "

The boy pointed an incriminating finger at the mirror .-- And the dying child in her arms holding,
they looked into the glass prevented the Cyprian. But while came of looking the horror in her face, and her
light blue eyes were stone like a diamond. For in the evening light
that broke through the murky window, she saw the deepest reason as
aggregated Mist the figure of a child, as mournful crouched there
on the ground and seemed to sleep. And if the rope or cloth is wet, it will stick better.

Note 48, page 140: All Scouts should know how to wigwag messages. There are three alphabets
which may be used in telegraphing by wigwagging with a flag or with the cap: the American Morse,
such as is used in this country by the regular telegraph, the Continental Morse, and the Army
and Navy. The American Morse is dots and dashes and spaces; but the Continental Morse is different,
because it does not have any spaces. It is employed in Europe and in submarine cable work.
Commonly the system is known as the Army and Navy.

Scouts will find that knowing the American Morse or dot-and-dash telegraph signs will be of
much value because these can be used both in wigwag and in electric-wire work; but Scouts to
be of assistance to their country in military time must know the Army and Navy alphabet, which
is easier to learn.

Instead of the dot and the dash and the space, the figures 1, 2, and 3 are used. The figure
1, like the wigwag dot, is a quick sweep of the flag to the right, from the perpendicular to
the level of the waist, or one quarter of a circle. The figure 2 is a similar sweep to the
left. The figure 3 is a "front," or sweeping the flag straight down, before, and instantly
returning it to the upright again. The perpendicular or upright is the beginning of every motion.
The "front" ends things: words, sentences, messages, etc.

Here is the Army and Navy alphabet: "A," you see, would be dip to left, and return; to left,
and return. "B," a left, a right, a right, and a left.

This Army and Navy alphabet is easier to read, because it does away with the pausing or lengthening
of the motions, to make the spaces which help to form some of the Morse letters. Every letter
is reeled straight off without a break.

Two flags are used in wigwagging. A white flag with a red square in the center is used against
a dark background; a red flag with a white square in the center is used against the sky or
against a mixed background. But of course in emergency anything must be tried, and for a short
distance the Scout can use his hat or cap, or handkerchief, or even his arm alone. The motions
should be sharp and quick and distinct, with a perpendicular between each motion and a "front"
between words. The Army rate with the large service flag is five or six words a minute.

The beam of a searchlight is used just as a flag is used, to sweep upward for "perpendicular,"
downward for "front," and to right and to left. "Is not it, my husband," cried the countess, who flung a glance "When the world lies
inside reflected in soft moonlight?" The frame was milled Steel, in which thousands of facets of the
captured and refracted light beam, as in color Fire flashed.

Soon the beautiful plant was set up in the bedroom of the couple, and each morning, while the
servant who combs her blonde hair or the silk braid into a knot , put the good countess sat
with folded hands in front of the mirror and looked Cyprian devout and full of hope in their
own sweet face. But if the Fruehsonne the Facets of the frame lit, then the image of the beautiful
woman sitting in a circle of Star sparks.
 It is called the Semaphore system--like
the semaphore block signals of railroads. It is more convenient for windy weather, because
the flags are shorter and smaller than the flags of the three-motion wigwag.

Scouts should have in their library a copy of the United States Signal Corps booklet, "Manual
of Visual Signaling," which can be had at a small price from the Government Printing Office
at Washington. This tells all about the different systems of day and night signaling, and shows
alphabets, signal flags, codes, ciphers, and so forth.

The Indians of the plains and mountains have had systems of signaling as perfect as those of
the Army and Navy. In early days of the Army on the plains, the Indians passed news along among
themselves over long distances faster than it was passed by the military telegraph. They used
a smoke code; and they used also mirror-flashes, blanket-waving, pony-running, foot-running,
and hand gestures.

Their secret signals were never told; no threats or bribes could make an Indian divulge his
tribal or his band code. Not even the white men who lived with the Indians could learn it.
Once some Army officers watched a Sioux chief, posted on a little knoll, drill his red cavalry
for an hour, without a word or a gesture; all he used was a little looking-glass held in the
palm of his hand.

However, some of the signs were general. A tremulous motion or flash meant game or enemy. Several
quick flashes, close together, meant "Come on." A beam to the left meant "By the left"; to
the right meant "By the right."

When looking for buffalo, the number of flashes would tell how many bands of buffalo were sighted,
and a quivering motion would bid the hunters to "Come on."

Scouts will find some blanket signs handy. If the blanket is too large to manage, fold it once.

"Who are you?" Hold the blanket by the two upper corners, in front, and bend with it far to
the right and to the left.

"We want peace." Hold the blanket by the two upper corners, in front, and bending forward lay
it flat upon the ground.

"Keep away," or "No." Hold up the blanket, grasping the two upper corners. Cross the arms,
still with hands grasping the corners. Bring right arm back to front and right, almost opening
the blanket again. Repeat.

"Go back" or "Hide." Hold up blanket by two corners opposite right shoulder, and swing it to
right and down, several times.

"Alarm!" Toss the blanket several times, as high as possible.

"Something (or somebody) in sight." Hold up blanket by the two corners opposite right shoulder.
Then swing the right corner around to left and to right. Repeat.

"Come on" or "Approach." Hold blanket up by two upper corners in front of the body. Swing the
right arm and corner to the left. Repeat.

Pony-running signals are usually in a circle, or forward and backward, on the side of a hill
or the crest. If the movements are fast, then the news is exciting and important. If they are
made in full view of the surrounding country, then the danger is not close. If they are made
under cover, then the danger is near. If they are made under cover and the rider suddenly stops
and hides, then everybody must hide, or retreat, for the enemy is too strong. The bigger the
movements, the more the enemy or the more the game. A dodging zigzag course shows that the
scout is pursued or apt to be pursued. A furious riding back and forth along a crest means
that a war party is returning successful. Boy Scouts can make the motions on foot, and by a
code of circles and figure eights, etc., can signal many things.

Signals by the hand and arm alone are convenient to know.

"Who are you?" is made by waving the right hand to right and to left in quick succession.

"We are friends" is made by raising both hands and grasping the left with the right, as if
shaking hands.

"We are enemies" is made by placing the right fist against the forehead, and turning it from
side to side.

"Halt" or "Keep away" is made by raising the right hand, palm to the front, and moving it forward
and back. 

Was quickly ordered the prosecution of the old, but the next morning all were on foam-covered Rossen empty-thing
back home. - "So let us for burying the dead," he said, "And send a messenger to the new master
of this beautiful goods!" Both arms stretched wide may mean "Go back" or "Halt"; both arms partly dropped may
mean "No," partly raised may mean "Yes." And so on. These were plain signals.

Note 49, page 141: A sprain, such as a sprained wrist or ankle, for instance, is a serious
injury, and must not be made light of or neglected. If not properly and promptly treated, it
is likely to leave the cords or ligaments permanently weak. When treatment may begin at once,
the injured joint should be laid bare, even if by cutting the shoe instead of unlacing it and
pulling it off, and the coldest water should be applied lavishly. The joint may well be plunged
into an icy spring or stream, or held under a running faucet. If the joint can be kept elevated,
so that the blood will not flow into it so readily, so much the better.

If some distance has to be covered before the injured person arrives in reach of treatment,
the shoe might as well remain on, to act as a bandage and a support--although it probably will
have to be cut off later. If the joint is not the ankle joint, a tight, stout bandage should
be fastened around. Nobody should try to step upon his sprained ankle or use his sprained wrist,
or whatever joint it may be.
