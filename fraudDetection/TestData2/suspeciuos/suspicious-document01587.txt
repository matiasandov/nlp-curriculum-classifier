I dare not be sanguine enough to hope that I shall be successful, but I have tried thus far
to show, first, the past and present condition of the Gipsies; second, the little we, as a
nation, have done to reclaim them; and, third, what we ought to do to improve them in the future,
so as to remove the stigma from our shoulders of having 20,000 to 30,000 Gipsies, show people,
and others living in vans, &c., in our midst, fast drifting into heathenism and barbarism,
not five per cent. of whom can read and write, at least, so far as the Gipsies are concerned;
and those children travelling with “gingerbread” stalls, rifle galleries, and auctioneers are
but little better, for all the parents tell me their children lose in the summer what little
they learn at school in the winter, for the want of means being adopted whereby their children
could go to school during the daytime as they are travelling through the country with their
wares, i.e., at their halting-places.

In bringing this book to a close, I would say, in the name of all that is just, fair, honourable,
and reasonable, in the name of science, religion, philosophy, and humanity, and in the name
of all that is Christ-like, God-like, and heavenly, I ask, nay I claim, the attention of our
noble Queen—whose deep interest in the children of the labouring population is unbounded—statesmen,
Christians, and my countrymen to the condition of the Gipsies and their children, whose condition
is herein feebly described, and whose cause I have ventured to take in hand, praying them to
adopt measures and to pass such laws that will wipe out the disgrace of having so many thousands
of poor, ignorant, uneducated, wretched, and lost Gipsy children in our midst, who cannot read
and write, on the following grounds—

First.  Their Indian origin, which I venture to think has been satisfactorily proved, and over
which country our Queen is the Empress; consequently, our Gipsies ought and have as much need
to be taken in hand and their condition improved by the State as the Thugs in India have been,
with such beneficial results, a class similar in many respects to our Gipsies.

Second.  As the Government in 1877 passed an act, called “The Canal Boats Act,” dealing pretty
much with the same class of people as the Gipsies and other travelling children, they ought,
in all fairness, to extend the principle to those living in tents and vans.

Third.  As small-pox, fevers, and other infectious diseases are at times very prevalent among
them—a medical officer being called in only under the rarest occasion—and as the tents and
vans are not under any sanitary arrangements, there is, therefore, urgent need for some sort
of sanitary supervision and control to be exercised over their wretched habitations to prevent
the spread of disease in such a stealthy manner.

Fourth.  As the Government took steps some three centuries ago to class the Gipsies as rogues
and vagabonds, but took no steps at the same time to improve their condition or even to encourage
them to get upon the right paths for leading an honourable and industrious life, the time has
now come, I think, both in justice and equity, for the Government to adopt some means to catch
the young hedge-bottom “Bob Rats,” and to deal out to them measures that will Christianise
and civilise them to such an extent that the Gipsies will not in the future be deserving of
the epithets passed upon them by the Government for their sins of omission and commission.

Fifth.  By passing an Act of Parliament, as I suggest, or amending the Canal Boats Act, in
accordance with the plan I have laid down, and embodying the suggestions herein contained,
the Government will complete the educational system and bring under the educational and sanitary
laws the lowest dregs of society, which have hitherto been left out in the cold, to grope about
in the dark as their inclinations might lead them.

Sixth.  The families who are seeking a living as hawkers, show people, &c., apart from the
Gipsies, are on the increase.  By travelling up and down the country in this way they not only
escape rates and taxes, but their children are going without education, as no provision is
made in the education acts to meet cases of this kind.  By bringing the Gipsy children under
the influence of the schoolmaster our law-makers will be adding the last stroke to the system
of compulsory education introduced and carried into law through its first difficult and intricate
phases by the Right Hon. W. E. Forster, M.P., when he was at the head of the Education Department
under the Liberal Government, and through its second stages by the Right Hon. Lord Sandon,
M.P., when he was at the head of the Education Department under the Conservative Government.

Seventh.  There is an universal desire among people of the classes I have before referred to
for the education of their children, in fact, I have not met with one exception during my inquiries,
and the Gipsies will be glad to make some sacrifices to carry it out if the Government will
do their part in the matter.

Eighth.  The Gipsies and other travellers of the same kind use our roads, locate on our commons,
live in our lanes, and send their poor, halt, maimed, and blind to our workhouses, infirmaries,
and asylums, towards the support of which they do not contribute one farthing.

Ninth.  As a Christian nation professing to send the Gospel all over the world, to preach glad
tidings, peace upon earth and good-will towards men everywhere, to take steps for the conversion
of the Gipsies in India, the African, the Chinese, the South Sea Islander, the Turk, the black,
the white, the bond, the free, in fact everywhere where an Englishman goes the Gospel is supposed
to go too, and yet—and it is with sadness, sorrow, and shame I relate it—we have had on an
average during the last three hundred and sixty-five years not less than 15,000 Gipsies moving
among us, and not less than 150,000 have died and been buried, either under water, in the ditches,
or on the roadside, on the commons, or in the cemeteries or churchyards, and we, as Christians
of Christian England, have not spent 150,000 pence to reclaim the adult Gipsies, or to educate
their children.

Tenth.  As a civilised country we are supposed to lead the van in civilising the world by passing
the most humane, righteous, just, and liberal laws, carrying them out on the plan of tempering
justice with mercy; but in matters concerning the interests and welfare of the Gipsies we are,
as I have shown previously, a long way in the rear.  We have passed laws to improve the condition
of the agricultural labourer’s child, children working in mines, children working in factories,
performing boys, climbing boys, children working in brick-yards, children working and living
on canal-boats, and a thousand others; but we have done nothing for the poor Gipsy child or
its home.  In things pertaining to their present and eternal welfare they have asked for bread
and we have given them a stone; and they have asked for fish and we have given them a serpent.
We have allowed them to wander and lose themselves in the dark wilds of sin and iniquity without
shedding upon their path the light of Gospel truths or the blessings of education; and to-day
the Gipsy children are dying, where thousands have died before, among the brambles and in the
thicket of bad example, ignorance, and evil training, into which we have allowed them to stray
blinded by the evil associations of Gipsy life.

    “An aged woman walks along,
    Her piercing scream is on the air,
    Her head and streaming locks are bare,
    She sadly sobs ‘My child, my child!’”

A faint voice is heard in the distance calling out—

    “My dying daughter, where art thou?
    Call on our gods and they shall come.”

                             “So mote it be.”

THE LIFE OF GEORGE SMITH, OF COALVILLE.

“The name of George Smith, of Coalville, is familiar as household words, and the unpretending
memoir just published by Messrs. Haughton & Co. of him, to whose deep sympathy and ceaseless
effort the populations of our brick-yards and canals owe so much, will be read with interest
by all.”—The Graphic.

“Readers of Mr. Smith’s letters in numerous papers, and of his descriptive articles in the
Illustrated London News, Graphic, and other journals and magazines, will be glad to possess
this little work, which tells the story of his career in a brief but interesting manner. The
book is elegantly printed on good paper, and is embellished with an excellent portrait and
with an engraving of Mr. Smith among the Gipsy children.”—Capital and Labour.

“This is ‘a chapter’ in philanthropy, yet it contains three times as much in the way of practical
philanthropy as would suffice to make any man a benefactor to his generation.  His devoted,
self-denying, persistent, and successful endeavours on behalf of the brick-yard children, the
canal population, and more recently the Gipsy ‘arabs,’ of our country and time, are concisely
and vividly set forth in this neat volume.”—The Christian.

“The name of George Smith, and his noble work amongst the canal-boat folk and the Gipsies,
have become familiar and welcome to multitudes in Great Britain.  This volume is an excellent
sketch of Mr. Smith; it contains a capital likeness, and should be read by all who desire to
possess increasing zeal in rescuing the perishing.”—Christian Age.

“A smartly written biography of a man who may be justly termed the Children’s Friend.  It is
well got up, and contains an excellent portrait of the great social reformer.  It is well that
this fascinating sketch should be given to the world.”—Literary World.

“In this book we are presented with a sketch of the life and labours—labours which have been
attended with a large measure of success—of one of the most devoted of living philanthropists.”—Scotsman.

“A fine biography, which every one should read in order to understand the noble character of
a man who must be pronounced a great benefactor.”—Free Press.

OUR CANAL POPULATION: A CRY FROM THE BOAT CABINS, WITH REMEDY.

                      New Edition, with Supplement.
              By GEORGE SMITH, F.S.A., Coalville, Leicester.

“A little book called ‘Our Canal Population,’ lately published and written by Mr. George Smith,
of Coalville, furnishes the most incredible details of what is going on on our silent highways.”—Morning
Advertiser.

“The notorious state of ‘Our Canal Population,’ the women and children who live on barges,
and in whose condition Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, has awakened public interest, is described
as ‘revolting and intolerable.’  If only a part of the statements made were true it would be
enough to make the ears of them that hear it tingle for pity and shame.”—Daily News.

“Although the statements made by Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, in ‘Our Canal Population,’
were doubtless, in some instances, open to the charge of exaggeration, in the main they were
largely correct.  Mr. Smith has earned the thanks of the community in this philanthropic object,
as he previously earned our thanks for his efforts to ameliorate the condition of children
in the brick-yards.”—Standard.

“Canal Boats.—On the 1st inst. came into operation an Act (the 40 and 41 Vic., c. 60) which
is calculated to do much good.  Hitherto ‘Our Canal Population’ were left pretty much to themselves.
They were considered outside the pale of local and educational authorities.  They were permitted
to live in their boats as they pleased, and to bring up their children without any interference
from school authorities.  Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, whose efforts on behalf of the children
employed in brick-fields were attended with such beneficial results, turned his attention to
‘Our Canal Population,’ and the credit likely to be won by the passing of the Act of last Session
will be mainly his.”—The Times.

“Mr. George Smith, of Coalville, who has done so much for the well-being of ‘Our Canal Population,’
is now busied in attempts to ameliorate the condition of juvenile Gipsies.”—Daily Telegraph.

“This gentleman represents by name, at least, a very large family, but he has won for himself
considerable distinction among the ‘Smiths’ for his unparalleled efforts to ameliorate the
wretched condition of ‘Our Canal Population’ on the English canals, the women and children
working in the brick-yards, and the Gipsy children.”—Christian Herald.

THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN FROM THE BRICK-YARDS OF ENGLAND, AND HOW THE CRY HAS BEEN HEARD,

            With Observations on the Carrying-out of the Act.

                By GEORGE SMITH, of Coalville, Leicester.
                              SIXTH EDITION.

“We heartily commend to our readers’ notice a new edition of a work which is full of thrilling
interest to those who sympathise with childhood, whose hearts bleed at the story of its wrongs
and leap for joy at any humane or beneficial measures on its behalf.”—Sunday School Chronicle.

“This book, now in its sixth edition, has many capital illustrations, and is a monument to
the patient self-denial and unwearying zeal brought to bear in favour of the poor children
by the author.”—Weekly Times.

“His cry for the protection for the helpless little ones is one that must assuredly command
attention.”—Daily Chronicle.

“This book is the record of a splendid service nobly done.  The author is likewise the hero
of it.  The value of the book is enhanced by the careful and tasteful manner in which Messrs.
Haughton have fulfilled their share of the undertaking.”—Derby Reporter.

“This is a title of an interesting work.  The whole forms a most interesting record of a noble-hearted
work.  We hope the book will meet, as it deserves, with an increasingly large circulation.”—Derbyshire
Advertiser.

“‘The Cry of the Children’ and ‘Our Canal Population’ are unique in many ways.  They have brought
prominently before public attention two unsuspected blots upon our civilisation.  We wish any
word of our’s could give still wider publicity to his self-denying labours.”—Live Stock Journal.

“Mr. Smith writes with vehement energy, which he puts into everything he does.  Some will perhaps
think that his language is occasionally too little measured, but then it is probable that a
man of more delicacy of feeling and expression would have never undertaken, and we think it
is certain that he would never have carried through, the work which Mr. George Smith has accomplished.
That work is of no small value.”—Staffordshire Sentinel.

“A good deal of new matter is inserted in this edition, including an interesting account of
the history and progress of the movement. . . . The volume is certainly worthy of a careful
perusal.”—Birmingham Gazette.

“In it is written the author’s account of his single-handed struggle for the emancipation of
the poor children of the brick-yards—a struggle long and patiently sustained, and which at
last, in 1872, met with its past merited reward in freeing 10,000 of these little ones from
their dark slavery.”—The Graphic.

“This is a deeply interesting book, both from the facts which it sets forth and the cause it
advocates.”—Christian Age.

“Every true philanthropist will read with deep interest Mr. Smith’s account of the history
and the passing of the Act, which marks one of the brightest victories yet won over prejudice
and self-interest in the United Kingdom.”—Derby Mercury.

“This excellently got-up work will strike a cord of sympathy in the bosoms of all who are interested
in the works of Christianity and philanthropy. . . .  Should find a place upon every book-shelf
because its contents are of thrilling interest. . . .  The book is essentially a statement
of facts, and no one can peruse its pages without feeling the impulse of the living spirit
which breathes in this ‘Cry of the Children.’”—Potteries Examiner.

“Mr. George Smith has, in his ‘Cry of the Children from the Brick-yards of England,’ raised
issues too serious, and advanced pleas too passionate, to be treated with indifference.”—Daily
Telegraph.

“In the present volume, which contains a number of excellent woodcuts, we have gathered up
the full story of the evils which used to prevail, which in the hands of a person of less moral
courage and perseverance than Mr. Smith would have failed.”—Leicester Daily Post.

Life of the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone, M.P.

“A carefully prepared story of the public life of Mr. Gladstone in the several spheres of politics
and literature.  It would be well if similar books to this were as sensibly compiled.  It is
a handy and useful little book, honestly worth its price.”—Christian World.

“Written with great fairness and impartiality, as well as with considerable literary ability.
It furnishes the reader with a key to the study of that which is undoubtedly one of the greatest
characters of modern times.  We can hardly conceive of a more useful political publication
at the present moment.  It is clear, pains-taking, and dispassionate.  We commend it to the
favourable attention of all.”—Leads Mercury.

“Those who desire to know what Mr. Gladstone’s life has been, and what are the objects to which
he has devoted himself, what have been the growth of his political mind and the tendency of
his political conduct, will do well to get this book.  It is neatly and simply written, and
contains a great many facts which have a bearing even beyond the life of its subject.”—Scotsman.

“No one can read this book without advantage.  The author has presented Mr. Gladstone in a
manner easily recognisable by friends and foes alike. The volume forms an important chapter
in Parliamentary history, extending over half a century.”—Literary World.

“Bearing, as it does throughout, the impress of thought and calm judgment, as well as of an
intimate knowledge of the varied aspects of the subject dealt with, it should be of universal
interest.”—Morning Post.

“The author has rendered a splendid service to Methodism.  Much that the writer tells us with
respect to the various agencies of Methodism is extremely interesting.”—Edinburgh Daily Review.

so that during his long itinerant ministry, multitudes were led to the Saviour. . . .  Those

yet saintly man.”—The Christian.

Footnotes:

{8}  Since writing the foregoing concerning Mahmood or Mahmud, I came across the enclosed,
taken from an article in the Daily News, January 11, 1880, which confirms my statements as
regards one of the main causes why the Gipsies or Indians left their native country:—“Ghuznee
was the capital of Mahmud of Ghuznee, or Mahmud the Destroyer, as he is known in Eastern story,
the first of the Mohammedan conquerors of India, and the only one who had his home in Afghanistan,
though he was himself of Turki or Mongol nationality.  Seventeen times did he issue forth from
his native mountains, spreading fire and sword over the plains of Hindustan, westward as far
as the Ganges Valley, and southward to the shore of Gujerat.  Seventeen times did he return
to Ghuznee laden with the spoil of Rajput kings and the shrines of Hindu pilgrimage.  In one
of these expeditions his goal was the far-famed temple of Somnauth or Somnauth Patan in Gujerat.
Resistance was vain, and equally useless were the tears of the Brahmins, who besought him to
take their treasures, but at least spare their idol.  With his own hand, and with the mace
which is the counterpart of Excalibar in Oriental legend, he smote the face of the idol, and
a torrent of precious stones gushed out.  When Keane’s army took Ghuznee in 1839, this mace
was still to be seen hanging up over the sarcophagus of Mahmud, and the tomb was then entered
through folding gates, which tradition asserted to be those of the Temple of Somnauth. Lord
Ellenborough gave instructions to General Nott to bring back with him to India both the mace
and the gates.  The latter, as is well-known, now lie mouldering in the lumber-room of the
fort at Agra, for their authenticity is absolutely indefensible; but the mace could nowhere
be found by the British plunderer.  Mahmud reigned from 997 to 1030 A.D., and in his days Ghuznee
was probably the first city in Asia.  The extensive ruins of his city stretch northwards along
the Cabul road for more than two miles from the present town; but all that now remains standing
are two lofty pillars or minarets, 400 yards apart, one bearing the name of Mahmud, the other
that of his son Masaud.  Beyond these ruins again is the Roza or Garden, which surrounds the
mausoleum of Mahmud. The building itself is a poor structure, and can hardly date back for
eight centuries.  The great conqueror is said to rest beneath a marble slab, which bears an
inscription in Cufic characters, thus interpreted by Major (now Sir Henry) Rawlinson: ‘May
there be forgiveness of God upon him, who is the great lord, the noble Nizam-ud-din (Ruler
of the Faith) Abul Kasim Mahmud, the son of Sabaktagin!  May God have mercy upon him!’ The
Ghuznevide dynasty founded by Mahmud lasted for more than a century after his death, though
with greatly restricted dominions.  Finally, it was extinguished in 1152 by one of those awful
acts of atrocity which are fortunately recorded only in the East.  Allah-ud-din, Prince of
Ghore, a town in the north-western hills of Afghanistan, marched upon Ghuznee to avenge the
death of two of his brothers.  The king was slain in battle, and the city given up to be sacked.
The common orders of the people were all massacred upon the spot; the nobles were taken to
Ghore, and there put to death, and their blood used to cement the rising walls of the capital.”

{176}  The “Czardas” is a solitary public-house, an institution which plays a considerable
part in all romantic poems or romantic novels whose scene is laid in Hungary, as a fitting
haunt for brigands, horse-thieves, Gipsies, Jews, political refugees, strolling players, vagabond
poets, and other melodramatic personages.

{219}  The fact of Ryley having at his death a caravan, pony, carpets, curtains, blankets,
mirrors, china, crockery, metal pots and dishes, &c., seems hardly, in my mind, to be in accord
with his doing no work for years, smoking under railroad arches and loitering about beershops.
I expect, if the truth were known, the whole of his furniture and stock-in-trade could have
been placed upon a wheelbarrow.
