A conveyance, transfer or lien executed by either husband or wife, to or in favor of the other
shall be valid to the same extent as between other persons [§3397.] When the rights of creditors
might be prejudiced by transfers of property between husband and wife, such transactions will
be closely scrutinized, and the utmost good faith must plainly appear, but where no fraudulent
intention is shown they will be upheld if based upon an adequate consideration. If a conveyance
is made by the husband to the wife when the husband is largely indebted and insolvent, such
conveyance is presumptively fraudulent, but a conveyance to a wife in payment of a valid claim,
even though made at a time when the husband is largely indebted to others, will not be considered
fraudulent the wife having the same right as other creditors to obtain payment. All contracts
between husband and wife where no other consideration appears than an agreement to perform
some duty already incumbent upon the parties, because of their relations as husband and wife,
are against public policy, and will not be enforced in law. Such, for example, as a promise
by the husband to pay money to the wife to induce her to live with him, when she has no legal
ground for not living with him; or an agreement to allow the husband to obtain a divorce when
he has no legal cause for divorce, or a conveyance of property in consideration of future care
and support because the husband is growing old; or a contract between husband and wife by which
the husband agrees to pay the wife at stated intervals, sums of money, in consideration of
the faithful performance by the wife of the obligations incident to the marriage relation.
But our courts have held that exempt property may be transferred by the husband to the wife
without any consideration; that a deed from husband to wife in consideration of a dismissal
by the latter, of a proceeding for divorce, is valid; that a contract between husband and wife
by which the wife, for a consideration, after a decree of divorce, agrees to release all her
dower interest in the real estate of the husband, is binding. Voluntary conveyances, in favor
of third parties, by a man or woman in contemplation of marriage, and with the evident intention
of defeating the marital rights of the other party, in such property, will be held fraudulent,
and may be set aside in an action by the injured party after marriage. Contracts and conveyances
made before marriage and duly recorded, will not be set aside on account of the marriage relation,
as the fact of recording is sufficient to charge the wife with notice of the transactions.
Ante-nuptial contracts, if free from fraud and imposition, are valid, and such a contract stipulating
that each is to have the untrammeled and sole control of his or her own property, real and
personal, as though no marriage had taken place, will be enforced. The dower right of each
in the other's property is completely waived by such contract.

[Sidenote: Abandonment of either.]

In case the husband or wife abandons the other and leaves the state, and is absent therefrom
for one year without providing for the maintenance and support of his or her family, or is
confined in jail or the penitentiary for the period of one year or upward, the district court
of the county where the husband or wife, so abandoned or not confined, resides, may, on application
by petition setting forth fully the facts, authorize him or her, to manage, control, sell and
encumber the property of the husband or wife for the support and maintenance of the family
and for the purpose of paying debts. Notice of such proceedings shall be given as in ordinary
actions, and anything done under or by virtue of the order of the court, shall be valid to
the same extent as if the same was done by the party owning the property. [§3398.] A wife who
is abandoned by her husband without her fault, may pledge his credit for necessaries, and if
left in the management of his business may make all contracts incident to such management.
She may also sell exempt property and apply the proceeds towards the support of the family
before absolutely forced to do so by the destitution of the family.

[Sidenote: Contracts and sales binding.]

All contracts, sales or incumbrances made by either husband or wife by virtue of the power
contemplated in the preceding section, shall be binding on both, and during such absence or
confinement, the person acting under such power, may sue and be sued thereon, and for all acts
done, the property of both shall be liable. No suit or proceeding shall abate or be in anywise
affected by the return or release of the person confined, but he or she may be permitted to
prosecute or defend jointly with the other. [§3399.]

[Sidenote: Decree set aside.]

The husband or wife affected by the proceedings contemplated in the preceding sections, may
have the order or decree of the court set aside or annulled, but the setting aside of such
decree or order shall in nowise affect any act done thereunder. [§3400.]

[Sidenote: Attorney in fact.]

A husband or wife may constitute the other his or her attorney in fact, to control and dispose
of his or her property for their mutual benefit, and may revoke the same to the same extent
and manner as other persons. [§3401.] The fact of the marital relation does not, of itself,
establish the presumption that the husband is the agent of the wife, for the transaction of
business for her, but in order to bind her, he must be expressly authorized to act as agent,
or she must, after knowledge of the act, expressly or impliedly ratify it. Such agency or ratification
may be established by circumstances, and the degree of evidence required in such cases, is
less than is necessary to establish an agency between independent parties, or the ratification
by the husband, of acts done by the wife or his agent.

[Sidenote: Wages of wife.]

A wife may receive the wages of her personal labor and maintain an action therefor in her own
name, and hold the same in her own right; she may prosecute and defend all actions at law or
in equity for the preservation and protection of her rights and property as if unmarried. [§3402.]
The husband is entitled to the wife's labor and assistance in the duties and obligations growing
out of the marriage relation, and to her earnings, if she is not engaged in a separate business
on her own account; but her earnings for services performed for others than her husband or
acquired in carrying on an independent business, belong to her alone. Such earnings may be
invested in property and it will be exempt from seizure for debts of her husband.

She may bring actions for injuries to herself, whether of person, property or reputation in
the same manner as if she were unmarried. If she suffers personal injury by which the husband
is deprived of her services or society he has a right of recovery for such loss and for expenses
for medicine and medical treatment. The wife cannot recover in such case, unless it appears
that she has expended her own money in payment of such expenses. If, at the time of the injury
she is engaged in a separate business, and death results, the husband may still recover for
loss of society and expenses, but an action for damages can be brought only by the administrator
of her estate. Although husband or wife may maintain an action against the other for the recovery
of property, neither has a right of action for damages sustained by the infliction of personal
injury, and this is true even though the one inflicting the injury has been criminally convicted
and fined for the assault.

[Sidenote: Property of one not liable for debts of the other.]

Neither husband or wife is liable for the debts or liabilities of the other incurred before
marriage, and except as herein otherwise declared, they are not liable for the separate debts
of each other; nor are the wages, earnings, or property of either, nor is the rent or income
of such property liable for the separate debts of the other [§3403.] The husband is liable
for necessaries furnished the wife, upon an implied obligation to provide for her a reasonable
support. The term "necessaries," is not confined to the supply of things actually demanded
for her sustenance, such as food, clothing and medicine, but includes all that may be needful
for her comfort and happiness according to her rank and station in society. In determining
the extent of the husband's liability, it is always proper to consider the wife's social position
and the circumstances and condition of the family, and these will, of course, vary in each
particular case. It has been held that jewelry is included in the term necessaries and that
attorney's fees in divorce proceedings by the wife, can be recovered from the husband. If the
wife is compelled to leave her husband because of cruel and improper conduct on his part, the
husband is still presumed to have extended to her a general credit for necessaries, such as
meat, drink, clothes, medicine, etc., suitable to his degree and circumstances.

[Sidenote: Contracts of wife.]

Contracts may be made by a wife and liabilities incurred, and the same enforced by or against
her to the same extent and in the same manner as if she were unmarried [§3404.] By this provision
a wife is clothed with the same rights enjoyed by her husband, and must, therefore, assume
the same liabilities. She has the same freedom to contract in reference to her property, or
other matters, and will be held to the same strict accountability. The law will enforce her
obligations with the same impartiality, whether such obligations are express or implied. She
may contract with reference to all kinds of property, including real estate, and may mortgage
her property as security for the debt of another, in precisely the same manner that her husband
could do in similar cases.

[Sidenote: Family expenses.]

The expenses of the family and the education of the children are chargeable upon the property
of both husband and wife, or of either of them, and in relation thereto they may be sued jointly
or separately. [§3405.] Both husband and wife are personally responsible for family expenses.
The credit may be extended to the husband and the contract made with him alone, and the wife
will be liable though she may have no knowledge of the purchase and has given no consent thereto.
It is sufficient to show that the articles were used, or kept for use in the family, and a
judgment may be rendered against the wife alone. But the husband cannot subject the property
of his wife to any liability for articles for family use when it appears that such articles
were not a necessity, if the wife has objected to the purchase and notified the seller that
she will not pay for the same. "Expenses of the family," are not limited to necessary expenses,
but whatever is kept or used in the family is included in the term. A piano, an organ, a watch
and other jewelry, a cook stove and fixtures, have all been held to come within the term "family
expense," for which the property of the wife is liable. But a reaping machine, though used
by the husband in the business by which he supports his family, is not a legitimate item of
family expense, nor can a plow be included therein. The expense of treatment of a wife at a
hospital for the insane, has been held not to be a family expense. Money borrowed by the husband
and used in the purchase of articles which, if obtained on credit, would constitute items of
family expense, cannot itself form such an item of family expense, that the wife may be held
liable, unless the money was furnished at her request, and the account assigned to the party
furnishing the money. If a merchant with whom the husband has no account is notified in writing,
not to sell goods to the wife and charge them to him, the merchant cannot hold the husband
responsible, unless it appears that the latter fails to provide necessaries otherwise for his
family. If the family is supported in whole, or in part, by the wife, she cannot recover back
the money thus expended, from her husband or his estate, as the law places such duty equally
on both.

[Sidenote: Removal from homestead.]

Neither husband nor wife can remove the other, nor their children from their homestead without
his or her consent, and if he abandons her, she is entitled to the custody of their minor children,
unless the district court, upon application for that purpose, shall, for good cause, otherwise
direct [§3406.]

[Sidenote: Conveyance of property.]

When either the husband or wife is insane, and incapable of executing a deed, and relinquishing
or conveying his or her right to the real property of the other, the sane person may petition
the district court of the county where such petitioner resides, or of the county where said
real estate is situated, setting forth the facts and praying for an order authorizing the applicant
or some other person to execute a deed of conveyance and thereby relinquish the interest of
either in the real property of the other [§3407.]

[Sidenote: Proceedings and decree.]

Upon such application the court has power to appoint some person or attorney guardian of the
person alleged to be insane, who shall ascertain as to the propriety, good faith and necessity
of the prayer of the petitioner, and who shall have power to resist said application. If the
court is satisfied that the petition is made in good faith, and that the petitioner is the
proper person to exercise the power and make the conveyance, and that such power is necessary
and proper, said court shall enter up a decree authorizing the execution of all such conveyances,
for and in the name of such husband or wife, by such person as the court may appoint [§§3408-3409.]

[Sidenote: Appointment, Revocation.]

All deeds executed by the person thus appointed shall be valid in law, and shall convey the
interest of such insane person in the real estate so conveyed; said power shall cease and become
void as soon as he or she shall become sane and of sound mind, and apply to the court to revoke
said power, and the same shall be evoked; but such revocation shall in nowise affect conveyances
previously made. [§3410.]

CHAPTER IV.

DIVORCE, ANNULLING MARRIAGES AND ALIMONY.

[Sidenote: Jurisdiction.]

The district court where either party resides, has, jurisdiction of the subject matter of this
chapter. [§3411]. State legislatures have power to grant divorces in all cases where such power
has not been conferred on the courts of the state by some constitutional provision or legislative
enactment. The legislature of this state has been deprived of the power to grant divorces for
any cause by Article 3, §27, of the constitution, which provides that "no divorce shall be
granted by the general assembly." A divorce obtained from a court not having jurisdiction is
absolutely void. The residence necessary to give the court jurisdiction must be permanent,
or at least of a sufficient period of time to indicate an intention of continued residence
and citizenship. The general rule is that the domicile of the wife and children is to be considered
the same as that of the husband, but in a proceeding for divorce the law recognizes that husband
and wife have separate domiciles, and a valid divorce may be granted where only one of the
parties resides, but if they reside in different states, the court having jurisdiction of the
party making application for the divorce may grant the decree, but it has no authority to make
a decree as to the custody of the children, if they are non-residents of the state where the
decree of divorce is rendered. A decree of divorce can always be set aside for fraud in obtaining
it.

[Sidenote: Petition.]

When the application for divorce is against a party not residing in this state, the petition,
in addition to the facts on account of which the applicant claims the relief sought, must state
that such applicant has been for the last year a resident of the state, stating the town and
county in which he has resided, and the length of his residence therein, after deducting all
absences from the state; that he is now a resident thereof; that such residence has been in
good faith and not for the purpose of obtaining a divorce only; and it must in all cases state
that the application is made in good faith and for the purpose set forth in the petition. [§3412.]

[Sidenote: Verification. Evidence. Hearing.]

All the allegations of the petition must be verified by oath and proved by competent evidence.
No divorce shall be granted on the evidence of the applicant alone, and all such actions shall
be heard in open court on the testimony of witnesses or depositions. [§3413.] No divorce can
be granted by consent of parties unless grounds therefor can be shown by competent evidence,
and if collusion or conrivance on the part of the defendant can be shown, such fact will be
a valid defense.

[Sidenote: Causes.]

Divorce from the bonds of matrimony may be decreed against the husband for the following causes:

1. When he has committed adultery subsequent to the marriage;

2. When he wilfully deserts his wife and absents himself without a reasonable cause for the
space of two years;

3. When he is convicted of felony after the marriage;

4. When, after marriage, he becomes addicted to habitual drunkenness;

5. When he is guilty of such inhuman treatment as to endanger the life of his wife. [§3414.]

A previous law of our state provided that when it was fully apparent to the court that the
parties could not live in peace and happiness together, and that their welfare required a separation,
a decree of divorce might be granted, but no valid divorce can now be granted for any other
cause than for some one of those enumerated above; and this is true, although it may plainly
appear that a party has wholly disregarded his marriage vows and obligations in various other ways.

[Adultery.]

As the direct fact of adultery can seldom be proved, when a divorce is asked on this ground,
it will be sufficient if the fact can be shown by circumstances which would be inconsistent
with any rational theory of innocence, and such as would lead the guarded discretion of a just
mind to the conclusion of the truth of the facts. The disposition of the parties may be shown,
with the fact of their being together and having an opportunity to commit the act.

[Sidenote: Desertion.]

A reasonable cause for desertion must be some wrongful conduct on the part of the other party,
and must be of such a serious nature that it would prima facie entitle the party deserting
to a divorce. If husband and wife mutually agree to separate, such separation will not constitute
ground for divorce, unless the party applying for the divorce, in good faith expresses a desire
to live with the other. Where the wife is compelled to leave her husband on account of inhuman
treatment, such as would entitle her to a divorce, such desertion cannot be made the basis
of proceedings for divorce by the husband, for in such case he and not she is guilty of desertion,
and this may be alleged by the wife, with other causes, in seeking a divorce. A wife may be
justified in leaving her husband because of his failure to protect her from insult and abuse,
and when she leaves him for this cause, her desertion will not be grounds for divorce.

[Sidenote: Felony.]

A conviction for felony which may be subject to reversal does not constitute ground for divorce,
but such conviction must be final and absolute.

[Sidenote: Drunkenness.]

If a woman marries a man knowing him to be intemperate, though she does so in the hope of reforming
him, the courts will not interfere after marriage to grant her relief from the result of her
misplaced confidence, but where the habit has been acquired subsequent to the marriage and
has become fixed and the husband is habitually drunk, though not in such condition during business
hours, it is such habitual drunkenness as will entitle the wife to a divorce.

[Sidenote: Cruel treatment.]

Cruel and inhuman treatment, to constitute ground for divorce must be of such a nature as to
endanger life, but need not necessarily consist of physical violence. Even where no single
act or number of acts can be shown which might cause reasonable apprehension of harm to life,
if the ill treatment as an entirety is of a nature to affect the mind and undermine health
to such a degree that the life will be ultimately endangered, it will entitle the injured party
to a divorce. Ungovernable outbursts of rage, the use of profane and obscene language, applying
insulting epithets to the wife in the presence of others, acts of cruelty and neglect in sickness,
coupled with failure to provide suitable food and clothing, have all been held to be such cruelty,
which, if long continued, would result in danger to life. Condonation is always a valid defense
in proceedings for divorce. If the wrong is once forgiven, it cannot afterwards be made a ground
for divorce, but the mere fact that a wife continues to live in the same house with her husband,
and does the household work, is not such condonation as will defeat her action.

[Sidenote: Husband from wife.]

The husband may obtain a divorce from his wife for like causes, and also when the wife at the
time of the marriage was pregnant by another than her husband, unless such husband had an illegitimate
child or children then living, which was unknown to the wife at the time of the marriage. [§3415.]
In many other states, divorce will be granted to the husband, for the cause here named, but
in no other state is it provided that in such case, a husband who had an illegitimate child
at the time of the marriage, unknown to the wife, cannot take advantage of this fact to obtain
a divorce.

[Sidenote: Cross petition.]

The defendant may obtain a divorce for the causes as above stated, by filing a cross petition.
[§3416.]

[Sidenote: Maintenance during litigation.]

The court may order either party to pay the clerk a sum of money for the separate support and
maintenance of the adverse party and the children, and to enable such party to prosecute or
defend the action. [§3417.] In applying for an order granting temporary alimony it is not necessary
to show that the party making the application is entitled to a divorce. It is sufficient if
it appears that such party is without means of support and unable to prosecute the action without
such allowance. The fact of marriage must be either admitted or proved. The court may allow
attorney's fees in proceedings for divorce and alimony, but the party against whom the action
is brought, is not liable, if the other party is unsuccessful. Where the applicant for divorce
is ordered to pay a certain sum of money to enable the defendant to defend, it he fails to
obey this order, the action may be dismissed.

If it appears that the father is an unfit person to have the custody of the children, pending
a proceeding for divorce, the court has power to provide for their custody and maintenance
as may be for the best interest of the children.

[Sidenote: Attachment.]

A judgment or order for temporary alimony is a lien upon the property of the person against
whom the order is directed, and such property may be levied upon by attachment and held to
satisfy the decree of the court. [§3418.] Attachment may be allowed without bond and it may
be granted in a suit to annul an illegal marriage as well as in one for divorce. It may be
levied on the homestead as well as other property. The disposition of property by the defendant
may also be restrained by injunction.

[Sidenote: Showing.]

In making such orders, the court or judge shall take into consideration the age, condition,
sex and pecuniary condition of the parties, and such other matters as are deemed pertinent,
which may be shown by affidavits in addition to the pleadings or otherwise, as the court or
judge may direct. [§3419.]

[Sidenote: Alimony, Custody of children, Changes.]

When a divorce is decreed, the court may make such order in relation to the children, property,
parties, and the maintenance of the parties as shall be right and proper. Subsequent changes
may be made by the court, in these respects when circumstances render them expedient. [§8420.]
In granting a divorce, full power is given the court over the questions of permanent alimony
and custody of children, and the amount of alimony will be determined by a careful consideration
of the circumstances of the parties. The allowance is usually for a certain sum of money, but
the court may set apart a specific portion of property as alimony. Only in rare cases and under
peculiar circumstances will alimony be granted to the party in fault. A judgment for alimony
may be made a lien upon specific property, and the court may declare it a lien on the homestead.
The court granting a divorce and alimony retains jurisdiction of the same, and upon a subsequent
change in the circumstances of the parties, may modify or change the decree in relation to
alimony and custody of children as may seem just and proper and for the best interests of all
parties. A suit for alimony without divorce may be brought, where the wife has been compelled
to leave her husband on account of misconduct on his part justifying the separation. The disposition
of the children is entirely within the discretion of the court, and the custody may be given
to either party or may be taken from both and given to a guardian, if it can be shown that
neither parent is a proper person to care for them. The best good of the child will be the
first and most important consideration in determining to whom the custody shall be given.

[Sidenote: Forfeiture.]

When a divorce is decreed the guilty party forfeits all rights acquired by the marriage. [§3421.]
After a decree of divorce neither party can have any interest in the property of the other
except that which is granted by the decree, and this applies to claim for dower in case of
survival.

[Sidenote: Annulling illegal marriages.]

Marriages may be annulled for the following causes:

1. Where marriage between the parties is prohibited by law.

2. Where either party was impotent at the time of the marriage.

3. Where either party has a husband or wife at the time of the marriage, provided they have
not continued to live and cohabit together after the death of the former husband or wife.

4. Where either party was insane or idiotic at the time of the marriage. [§3422.] If a person
marries who has a husband or wife living such marriage is absolutely void. In case of absence
of the husband a presumption of death does not arise until he has been absent seven years without
intelligence concerning him. Where a party is insane or idiotic, and is therefore incapable
of consenting, a marriage with such person will be void. When a marriage is absolutely void
by law, it is not necessary to bring an action to annul it, before contracting a subsequent
legal marriage.

[Sidenote: Petition.]
