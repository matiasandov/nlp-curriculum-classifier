The vision rises before me, as my mind harks back to this second trip of seven hundred miles,
of cold, rainy nights, when, urged by Muir to make one more point, the natives passed the last
favorable camping place and we blindly groped for hours in pitchy darkness, trying to find
a friendly beach. The intensely phosphorescent water flashed about us, the only relief to the
inky blackness of the night. Occasionally a salmon or a big halibut, disturbed by our canoe,
went streaming like a meteor through the water, throwing off coruscations of light. As we neared
the shore, the waves breaking upon the rocks furnished us the only illumination. Sometimes
their black tops with waving seaweed, surrounded by phosphorescent breakers, would have the
appearance of mouths set with gleaming teeth rushing at us out of the dark as if to devour
us. Then would come the landing on a sandy beach, the march through the seaweed up to the wet
woods, a fusillade of exploding fucus pods accompanying us as if the outraged fairies were
bombarding us with tiny guns. Then would ensue a tedious groping with the lantern for a camping
place and for some dry, fat spruce wood from which to coax a fire; then the big camp-fire,
the bean-pot and coffee-pot, the cheerful song and story, and the deep, dreamless sleep that
only the weary voyageur or hunter can know.

Four or five days sufficed to bring us to our first objective--Sumdum or Holkham Bay, with
its three wonderful arms. Here we were to find the lost glacier. This deep fiord has two great
prongs. Neither of them figured in Vancouver's chart, and so far as records go we were the
first to enter and follow to its end the longest of these, Endicott Arm. We entered the bay
at night, caught again by the darkness, and groped our way uncertainly. We probably would have
spent most of the night trying to find a landing place had not the gleam of a fire greeted
us, flashing through the trees, disappearing as an island intervened, and again opening up
with its fair ray as we pushed on. An hour's steady paddling brought us to the camp of some
Cassiar miners--my friends. They were here at the foot of a glacier stream, from the bed of
which they had been sluicing gold. Just now they were in hard luck, as the constant rains had
swelled the glacial stream, burst through their wing-dams, swept away their sluice-boxes and
destroyed the work of the summer. Strong men of the wilderness as they were, they were not
discouraged, but were discussing plans for prospecting new places and trying it again here
next summer. Hot coffee and fried venison emphasized their welcome, and we in return could
give them a little news from the outside world, from which they had been shut off completely
for months.

Muir called us before daylight the next morning. He had been up since two or three o'clock,
"studying the night effects," he said, listening to the roaring and crunching of the charging
ice as it came out of Endicott Arm, spreading out like the skirmish line of an army and grinding
against the rocky point just below us. He had even attempted a moonlight climb up the sloping
face of a high promontory with Stickeen as his companion, but was unable to get to the top,
owing to the smoothness of the granite rock. It was newly glaciated--this whole region--and
the hard rubbing ice-tools had polished the granite like a monument. A hasty meal and we were off.

"We'll find it this time," said Muir.

A miner crawled out of his blankets and came to see us start. "If it's scenery you're after,"
he said, "ten miles up the bay there's the nicest canyon you ever saw. It has no name that
I know of, but it is sure some scenery."
