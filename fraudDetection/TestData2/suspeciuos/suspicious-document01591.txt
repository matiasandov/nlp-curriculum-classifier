BOOK IV THE PARLIAMENT 1399-1461

CHAPTER V THE HOUSE OF LANCASTER 1399-1422

[Sidenote: Henry the Fourth]

Once safe in the Tower, it was easy to wrest from Richard a resignation of his crown; and this
resignation was solemnly accepted by the Parliament which met at the close of September 1399.
But the resignation was confirmed by a solemn Act of Deposition. The coronation oath was read,
and a long impeachment which stated the breach of the promises made in it was followed by a
solemn vote of both Houses which removed Richard from the state and authority of king. According
to the strict rules of hereditary descent as construed by the feudal lawyers by an assumed
analogy with the rules which governed descent of ordinary estates the crown would now have
passed to a house which had at an earlier period played a leading part in the revolutions of
the Edwards. The great-grandson of the Mortimer who brought about the deposition of Edward
the Second had married the daughter and heiress of Lionel of Clarence, the third son of Edward
the Third. The childlessness of Richard and the death of Edward's second son without issue
placed Edmund Mortimer, the son of the Earl who had fallen in Ireland, first among the claimants
of the crown; but he was now a child of six years old, the strict rule of hereditary descent
had never received any formal recognition in the case of the Crown, and precedent suggested
a right of Parliament to choose in such a case a successor among any other members of the Royal
House. Only one such successor was in fact possible. Whatever defects such a claim might present
were more than covered by the solemn recognition of Parliament. The two Archbishops, taking
the new sovereign by the hand, seated him upon the throne, and Henry in emphatic words ratified
the compact between himself and his people. "Sirs," he said to the prelates, lords, knights,
and burgesses gathered round him, "I thank God and you, spiritual and temporal, and all estates
of the land; and do you to wit it is not my will that any man think that by way of conquest
I would disinherit any of his heritage, franchises, or other rights that he ought to have,
nor put him out of the good that he has and has had by the good laws and customs of the realm,
except those persons that have been against the good purpose and the common profit of the realm."

[Sidenote: Statute of Heresy]

The deposition of a king, the setting aside of one claimant and the elevation of another to
the throne, marked the triumph of the English Parliament over the monarchy. The struggle of
the Edwards against its gradual advance had culminated in the bold effort of Richard the Second
to supersede it by a commission dependent on the Crown. But the House of Lancaster was precluded
by its very position from any renewal of the struggle. It was not merely that the exhaustion
of the treasury by the war and revolt which followed Henry's accession left him even more than
the kings who had gone before in the hands of the Estates; it was that his very right to the
Crown lay in an acknowledgement of their highest pretensions. He had been raised to the throne
by a Parliamentary revolution. His claim to obedience had throughout to rest on a Parliamentary
title. During no period of our early history therefore were the powers of the two Houses so
frankly recognized. The tone of Henry the Fourth till the very close of his reign is that of
humble compliance in all but ecclesiastical matters with the prayers of the Parliament, and
even his imperious successor shrank almost with timidity from any conflict with it. But the
Crown had been bought by pledges less noble than this. Arundel was not only the representative
of constitutional rule; he was also the representative of religious persecution. No prelate
had been so bitter a foe of the Lollards, and the support which the Church had given to the
recent revolution had no doubt sprung from its belief that a sovereign whom Arundel placed
on the throne would deal pitilessly with the growing heresy. The expectations of the clergy
were soon realized. In the first Convocation of his reign Henry declared himself the protector
of the Church and ordered the prelates to take measures for the suppression of heresy and of
the wandering preachers. His declaration was but a prelude to the Statute of Heresy which was
passed at the opening of 1401. By the provisions of this infamous Act the hindrances which
had till now neutralized the efforts of the bishops to enforce the common law were utterly
taken away. Not only were they permitted to arrest all preachers of heresy, all schoolmasters
infected with heretical teaching, all owners and writers of heretical books, and to imprison
them even if they recanted at the king's pleasure, but a refusal to abjure or a relapse after
abjuration enabled them to hand over the heretic to the civil officers, and by these--so ran
the first legal enactment of religious bloodshed which defiled our Statute-book--he was to
be burned on a high place before the people. The statute was hardly passed when William Sautre
became its first victim. Sautre, while a parish priest at Lynn, had been cited before the Bishop
of Norwich two years before for heresy and forced to recant. But he still continued to preach
against the worship of images, against pilgrimages, and against transubstantiation, till the
Statute of Heresy strengthened Arundel's hands. In February, 1401, Sautre was brought before
the Primate as a relapsed heretic, and on refusing to recant a second time was degraded from
his orders. He was handed to the secular power, and on the issue of a royal writ publicly burned.

[Sidenote: England and France]

The support of the nobles had been partly won by a hope hardly less fatal to the peace of the
realm, the hope of a renewal of the strife with France. The peace of Richard's later years
had sprung not merely from the policy of the English king, but from the madness of Charles
the Sixth of France. France fell into the hands of its king's uncle, the Duke of Burgundy,
and as the Duke was ruler of Flanders and peace with England was a necessity for Flemish industry,
his policy went hand in hand with that of Richard. His rival, the king's brother, Lewis, Duke
of Orleans, was the head of the French war-party; and it was with the view of bringing about
war that he supported Henry of Lancaster in his exile at the French court. Burgundy on the
other hand listened to Richard's denunciation of Henry as a traitor, and strove to prevent
his departure. But his efforts were in vain, and he had to witness a revolution which hurled
Richard from the throne, deprived Isabella of her crown, and restored to power the baronial
party of which Gloucester, the advocate of war, had long been the head. The dread of war was
increased by a pledge which Henry was said to have given at his coronation that he would not
only head an army in its march into France but that he would march further into France than
ever his grandfather had done. The French Court retorted by refusing to acknowledge Henry as
king, while the truce concluded with Richard came at his death legally to an end. In spite
of this defiance however Burgundy remained true to the interests of Flanders, and Henry clung
to a truce which gave him time to establish his throne. But the influence of the baronial party
in England made peace hard to keep; the Duke of Orleans urged on France to war; and the hatred
of the two peoples broke through the policy of the two governments. Count Waleran of St. Pol,
who had married Richard's half-sister, put out to sea with a fleet which swept the east coast
and entered the Channel. Pirates from Britanny and Navarre soon swarmed in the narrow seas,
and their ravages were paid back by those of pirates from the Cinque Ports. A more formidable
trouble broke out in the north. The enmity of France roused as of old the enmity of Scotland;
the Scotch king Robert the Third refused to acknowledge Henry, and Scotch freebooters cruised
along the northern coast.

[Sidenote: Richard's death]

Attack from without woke attack from within the realm. Henry had shown little taste for bloodshed
in his conduct of the revolution. Save those of the royal councillors whom he found at Bristol
no one had been put to death. Though a deputation of lords with Archbishop Arundel at its head
pressed him to take Richard's life, he steadily refused, and kept him a prisoner at Pomfret.
The judgements against Gloucester, Warwick, and Arundel were reversed, but the lords who had
appealed the Duke were only punished by the loss of the dignities which they had received as
their reward. Richard's brother and nephew by the half-blood, the Dukes of Exeter and Surrey,
became again Earls of Huntingdon and Kent. York's son, the Duke of Albemarle, sank once more
into Earl of Rutland. Beaufort, Earl of Somerset, lost his new Marquisate of Dorset; Spenser
lost his Earldom of Gloucester. But in spite of a stormy scene among the lords in Parliament
Henry refused to exact further punishment; and his real temper was seen in a statute which
forbade all such appeals and left treason to be dealt with by ordinary process of law. But
the times were too rough for mercy such as this. Clouds no sooner gathered round the new king
than the degraded lords leagued with the Earl of Salisbury and the deposed Bishop of Carlisle
to release Richard and to murder Henry. Betrayed by Rutland in the spring of 1400, and threatened
by the king's march from London, they fled to Cirencester; but the town was against them, its
burghers killed Kent and Salisbury, and drove out the rest. A terrible retribution followed.
Lord Spenser and the Earl of Huntingdon were taken and summarily beheaded; thirty more conspirators
fell into the king's hands to meet the same fate. They drew with them in their doom the wretched
prisoner in whose name they had risen. A great council held after the suppression of the revolt
prayed "that if Richard, the late king, be alive, as some suppose he is, it be ordained that
he be well and securely guarded for the safety of the states of the king and kingdom; but if
he be dead, then that he be openly showed to the people that they may have knowledge thereof."
The ominous words were soon followed by news of Richard's death in prison. His body was brought
to St. Paul's, Henry himself with the princes of the blood royal bearing the pall: and the
face was left uncovered to meet rumours that the prisoner had been assassinated by his keeper,
Sir Piers Exton.

[Sidenote: Revolt of Wales]

In June Henry marched northward to end the trouble from the Scots. With their usual policy
the Scottish army under the Duke of Albany withdrew as the English crossed the border, and
looked coolly on while Henry invested the castle of Edinburgh. The wants of his army forced
him in fact to raise the siege; but even success would have been fruitless, for he was recalled
by trouble nearer home. Wales was in full revolt. The country had been devoted to Richard;
and so notorious was its disaffection to the new line that when Henry's son knelt at his father's
feet to receive a grant of the Principality a shrewd bystander murmured, "He must conquer it
if he will have it." The death of the fallen king only added to the Welsh disquiet, for in
spite of the public exhibition of his body he was believed to be still alive. Some hold that
he had escaped to Scotland, and an impostor who took his name was long maintained at the Scottish
Court. In Wales it was believed that he was still a prisoner in Chester Castle. But the trouble
would have died away had it not been raised into revolt by the energy of Owen Glyndwr or Glendower.
Owen was a descendant of one of the last native Princes, Llewelyn-ap-Jorwerth, and the lord
of considerable estates in Merioneth. He had been squire of the body to Richard the Second,
and had clung to him till he was seized at Flint. It was probably his known aversion from the
revolution which had deposed his master that brought on him the hostility of Lord Grey of Ruthin,
the stay of the Lancastrian cause in North Wales; and the same political ground may have existed
for the refusal of the Parliament to listen to his prayer for redress and for the restoration
of the lands which Grey had seized. But the refusal was embittered by words of insult; when
the Bishop of St. Asaph warned them of Owen's power the lords retorted that "they cared not
for barefoot knaves." They were soon to be made to care. At the close of 1400 Owen rose in
revolt, burned the town of Ruthin, and took the title of Prince of Wales.

[Sidenote: Owen Glyndwr]

His action at once changed the disaffection into a national revolt. His raids on the Marches
and his capture of Radnor marked its importance, and Henry marched against him in the summer
of 1401. But Glyndwr's post at Corwen defied attack, and the pressure in the north forced the
king to march away into Scotland. Henry Percy, who held the castles of North Wales as Constable,
was left to suppress the rebellion, but Owen met Percy's arrival by the capture of Conway,
and the king was forced to hurry fresh forces under his son Henry to the west. The boy was
too young as yet to show the military and political ability which was to find its first field
in these Welsh campaigns, and his presence did little to stay the growth of revolt. While Owen's
lands were being harried Owen was stirring the people of Caermarthen into rebellion and pressing
the siege of Abergavenny; nor could the presence of English troops save Shropshire from pillage.
Everywhere the Welshmen rose for their "Prince"; the Bards declared his victories to have been
foretold by Merlin; even the Welsh scholars at Oxford left the University in a body and joined
his standard. The castles of Ruthin, Hawarden, and Flint fell into his hands, and with his
capture of Conway gave him command of North Wales. The arrival of help from Scotland and the
hope of help from France gave fresh vigour to Owen's action, and though Percy held his ground
stubbornly on the coast and even recovered Conway he at last threw up his command in disgust.
A fresh inroad of Henry on his return from Scotland again failed to bring Owen to battle, and
the negotiations which he carried on during the following winter were a mere blind to cover
preparations for a new attack. So strong had Glyndwr become in 1402 that in June he was able
to face an English army in the open field at Brynglas and to defeat it with a loss of a thousand
men. The king again marched to the border to revenge this blow. But the storms which met him
as he entered the hills, storms which his archers ascribed to the magic powers of Owen, ruined
his army, and he was forced to withdraw as of old. A raid over the northern border distracted
the English forces. A Scottish army entered England with the impostor who bore Richard's name,
and though it was utterly defeated by Henry Percy in September at Homildon Hill the respite
had served Owen well. He sallied out from the inaccessible fastnesses in which he had held
Henry at bay to win victories which were followed by the adhesion of all North Wales and of
great part of South Wales to his cause.

[Sidenote: The Percies]

What gave life to these attacks and conspiracies was the hostility of France. The influence
of the Duke of Burgundy was still strong enough to prevent any formal hostilities, but the
war party was gaining more and more the ascendant. Its head, the Duke of Orleans, had fanned
the growing flame by sending a formal defiance to Henry the Fourth as the murderer of Richard.
French knights were among the prisoners whom the Percies took at Homildon Hill; and it may
have been through their intervention that the Percies themselves were now brought into correspondence
with the court of France. No house had played a greater part in the overthrow of Richard, or
had been more richly rewarded by the new king. But old grudges existed between the house of
Percy and the house of Lancaster. The Earl of Northumberland had been at bitter variance with
John of Gaunt; and though a common dread of Richard's enmity had thrown the Percies and Henry
together the new king and his powerful subjects were soon parted again. Henry had ground indeed
for distrust. The death of Richard left the young Mortimer, Earl of March, next claimant in
blood of the crown, and the king had shown his sense of this danger by imprisoning the earl
and his sisters in the Tower. But this imprisonment made their uncle, Sir Edmund Mortimer,
the representative of their house; and Edmund withdrew to the Welsh Marches, refusing to own
Henry for king. The danger was averted by the luck which threw Sir Edmund as a captive into
the hands of Owen Glyndwr in the battle of Brynglas. It was natural that Henry should refuse
to allow Mortimer's kinsmen to ransom so formidable an enemy; but among these kinsmen Henry
Percy ranked himself through his marriage with Sir Edmund's sister, and the refusal served
as a pretext for a final breach with the king.

[Sidenote: Overthrow of the Percies]

Percy had withdrawn from the Welsh war in wrath at the inadequate support which Henry gave
him; and his anger had been increased by a delay in repayment of the sums spent by his house
in the contest with Scotland, as well as by the king's demand that he should surrender the
Earl of Douglas whom he had taken prisoner at Homildon Hill. He now became the centre of a
great conspiracy to place the Earl of March upon the throne. His father, the Earl of Northumberland,
his uncle, Thomas Percy, the Earl of Worcester, joined in the plot. Sir Edmund Mortimer negotiated
for aid from Owen Glyndwr; the Earl of Douglas threw in his fortunes with the confederates;
and Henry Percy himself crossed to France and obtained promises of support. The war party had
now gained the upper hand at the French court; in 1403 preparations were made to attack Calais,
and a Breton fleet put to sea. At the news of its presence in the Channel Henry Percy and the
Earl of Worcester at once rose in the north and struck across England to join Owen Glyndwr
in Wales, while the Earl of Northumberland gathered a second army and advanced more slowly
to their support. But Glyndwr was still busy with the siege of Caermarthen, and the king by
a hasty march flung himself across the road of the Percies as they reached Shrewsbury. On the
twenty-third of July a fierce fight ended in the defeat of the rebel force. Henry Percy was
slain in battle, the Earl of Worcester taken and beheaded; while Northumberland, who had been
delayed by an army under his rival in the north, Neville, Earl of Westmoreland, was thrown
into prison, and only pardoned on his protestations of innocence. The quick, hard blow did
its work. The young Earl of March betrayed the plans of his partizans to purchase pardon. The
Breton fleet, which had defeated an English fleet in the Channel and made a descent upon Plymouth,
withdrew to its harbours; and though the Duke of Burgundy was on the point of commencing the
siege of Calais the plans of an attack on that town were no more heard of.

[Sidenote: Henry's difficulties]

But the difficulty of Wales remained as great as ever. The discouragement of Owen at the failure
of the conspiracy of the Percies was removed by the open aid of the French Court. In July 1404
the French king in a formal treaty owned Glyndwr as Prince of Wales, and his promises of aid
gave fresh heart to the insurgents. What hampered Henry's efforts most in meeting this danger
was the want of money. At the opening of 1404 the Parliament grudgingly gave a subsidy of a
twentieth, but the treasury called for fresh supplies in October, and the wearied Commons fell
back on their old proposal of a confiscation of Church property. Under the influence of Archbishop
Arundel the Lords succeeded in quashing the project, and a new subsidy was voted; but the treasury
was soon as empty as before. Treason was still rife; the Duke of York, who had played so conspicuous
a part in Richard's day as Earl of Rutland, was sent for a while to the Tower on suspicion
of complicity in an attempt of his sister to release the Earl of March; and Glyndwr remained
unconquerable.

[Sidenote: Turn of the tide]

But fortune was now beginning to turn. The danger from Scotland was suddenly removed. King
Robert resolved to send his son James for training to the court of France, but the boy was
driven to the English coast by a storm and Henry refused to release him. Had the Scots been
friends, the king jested, they would have sent James to him for education, as he knew the French
tongue quite as well as King Charles. Robert died of grief at the news; and Scotland fell into
the hands of his brother, the Duke of Albany, whose one aim was that his nephew should remain
a prisoner. James grew up at the English Court; and, prisoner though he was, the excellence
of his training was seen in the poetry and intelligence of his later life. But with its king
as a hostage Scotland was no longer to be dreaded as a foe. France too was weakened at this
moment; for in 1405 the long-smouldering jealousy between the Dukes of Orleans and of Burgundy
broke out at last into open strife. The break did little indeed to check the desultory hostilities
which were going on. A Breton fleet made descents on Portland and Dartmouth. The Count of Armagnac,
the strongest supporter of Orleans and the war party, led troops against the frontier of Guienne.
But the weakness of France and the exhaustion of its treasury prevented any formal denunciation
of the truce or declaration of war. Though Henry could spare not a soldier for Guienne Armagnac
did little hurt. An English fleet repaid the ravages of the Bretons by harrying the coast of
Britanny; and the turn of French politics soon gave Frenchmen too much work at home to spare
men for work abroad. At the close of 1407 the murder of the Duke of Orleans by the order of
the Duke of Burgundy changed the weak and fitful strife which had been going on into a struggle
of the bitterest hate. The Count of Armagnac placed himself at the head of the murdered duke's
partizans; and in their furious antagonism Armagnac and Burgundian alike sought aid from the
English king.

[Sidenote: Prince Henry]

But the fortune which favoured Henry elsewhere was still slow to turn in the West. In the opening
of 1405 the king's son, Henry Prince of Wales, had taken the field against Glyndwr. Young as
he was, Henry was already a tried soldier. As a boy of thirteen he had headed an incursion
into Scotland in the year of his father's accession to the throne. At fifteen he fought in
the front of the royal army in the desperate fight at Shrewsbury. Slight and tall in stature
as he seemed, he had outgrown the weakness of his earlier years and was vigorous and swift
of foot; his manners were courteous, his air grave and reserved; and though wild tales ran
of revels and riots among his friends, the poets whom he favoured and Lydgate whom he set to
translate "the drery piteous tale of him of Troy" saw in him a youth "both manful and vertuous."
There was little time indeed for mere riot in a life so busy as Henry's, nor were many opportunities
for self-indulgence to be found in campaigns against Glyndwr. What fitted the young general
of seventeen for the thankless work in Wales was his stern, immoveable will. But fortune as
yet had few smiles for the king in this quarter, and his constant ill-success continued to
wake fresh troubles within England itself. The repulse of the young prince in a spring campaign
in 1405 was at once followed by a revolt in the north. The pardon of Northumberland had left
him still a foe; the Earl of Nottingham was son of Henry's opponent, the banished Duke of Norfolk;
Scrope, Archbishop of York, was brother of Richard's counsellor, the Earl of Wiltshire, who
had been beheaded on the surrender of Bristol. Their rising in May might have proved a serious
danger had not the treachery of Ralph Neville, the Earl of Westmoreland, who still remained
steady to the Lancastrian cause, secured the arrest of some of its leaders. Scrope and Lord
Nottingham were beheaded, while Northumberland and his partizan Lord Bardolf fled into Scotland
and from thence to Wales. Succours from France stirred the king to a renewed attack on Glyndwr
in November; but with the same ill-success. Storms and want of food wrecked the English army
and forced it to retreat; a year of rest raised Glyndwr to new strength; and when the long-promised
body of eight thousand Frenchmen joined him in 1407 he ventured even to cross the border and
to threaten Worcester. The threat was a vain one and the Welsh army soon withdrew; but the
insult gave fresh heart to Henry's foes, and in 1408 Northumberland and Bardolf again appeared
in the north. Their overthrow at Bramham Moor put an end to the danger from the Percies; for
Northumberland and Bardolf alike fell on the field. But Wales remained as defiant as ever.
In 1409 a body of Welshmen poured ravaging into Shropshire; many of the English towns had fallen
into Glyndwr's hands; and some of the Marcher Lords made private truces with him.

[Sidenote: Oldcastle]

The weakness which was produced by this ill-success in the West as well as these constant battlings
with disaffection within the realm was seen in the attitude of the Lollards. Lollardry was
far from having been crushed by the Statute of Heresy. The death of the Earl of Salisbury in
the first of the revolts against Henry's throne, though his gory head was welcomed into London
by a procession of abbots and bishops who went out singing psalms of thanksgiving to meet it,
only transferred the leadership of the party to one of the foremost warriors of the time, Sir
John Oldcastle. If we believe his opponents, and we have no information about him save from
hostile sources, he was of lowly origin, and his rise must have been due to his own capacity
and services to the Crown. In his youth he had listened to the preaching of Wyclif, and his
Lollardry--if we may judge from its tone in later years--was a violent fanaticism. But this
formed no obstacle to his rise in Richard's reign; his marriage with the heiress of that house
made him Lord Cobham; and the accession of Henry of Lancaster, to whose cause he seems to have
clung in these younger days, brought him fairly to the front. His skill in arms found recognition
in his appointment as sheriff of Herefordshire and as castellan of Brecknock; and he was among
the leaders who were chosen in later years for service in France. His warlike renown endeared
him to the king, and Prince Henry counted him among the most illustrious of his servants. The
favour of the royal house was the more noteable that Oldcastle was known as "leader and captain"
of the Lollards. His Kentish castle of Cowling served as the headquarters of the sect, and
their preachers were openly entertained at his houses in London or on the Welsh border. The
Convocation of 1413 charged him with being "the principal receiver, favourer, protector, and
defender of them; and that, especially in the dioceses of London, Rochester, and Hereford,
he hath sent out the said Lollards to preach ... and hath been present at their wicked sermons,
grievously punishing with threatenings, terror, and the power of the secular sword such as
did withstand them, alleging and affirming among other matters that we, the bishops, had no
power to make any such Constitutions" as the Provincial Constitutions, in which they had forbidden
the preaching of unlicensed preachers. The bold stand of Lord Cobham drew fresh influence from
the sanctity of his life. Though the clergy charged him with the foulest heresy, they owned
that he shrouded it "under a veil of holiness." What chiefly moved their wrath was that he
"armed the hands of laymen for the spoil of the Church." The phrase seems to hint that Oldcastle
was the mover in the repeated attempts of the Commons to supply the needs of the State by a
confiscation of Church property. In 1404 they prayed that the needs of the kingdom might be
defrayed by a confiscation of Church lands, and though this prayer was fiercely met by Archbishop
Arundel it was renewed in 1410. The Commons declared as before that by devoting the revenues
of the prelates to the service of the state maintenance could be made for fifteen earls, fifteen
hundred knights, and six thousand squires, while a hundred hospitals might be established for
the sick and infirm. Such proposals had been commonly made by the baronial party with which
the house of Lancaster had in former days been connected, and hostile as they were to the Church
as an establishment they had no necessary connexion with any hostility to its doctrines. But
a direct sympathy with Lollardism was seen in the further proposals of the Commons. They prayed
for the abolition of episcopal jurisdiction over the clergy and for a mitigation of the Statute
of Heresy.

[Sidenote: Action of Prince Henry]

But formidable as the movement seemed it found a formidable opponent. The steady fighting of
Prince Henry had at last met the danger from Wales, and Glyndwr, though still unconquered,
saw district after district submit again to English rule. From Wales the Prince returned to
bring his will to bear on England itself. It was through his strenuous opposition that the
proposals of the Commons in 1410 were rejected by the Lords. He gave at the same moment a more
terrible proof of his loyalty to the Church in personally assisting at the burning of a layman,
Thomas Badby, for a denial of transubstantiation. The prayers of the sufferer were taken for
a recantation, and the Prince ordered the fire to be plucked away. But when the offer of life
and a pension failed to break the spirit of the Lollard Henry pitilessly bade him be hurled
back to his doom. The Prince was now the virtual ruler of the realm. His father's earlier popularity
had disappeared amidst the troubles and heavy taxation of his reign. He was already a victim
to the attack of epilepsy which brought him to the grave; and in the opening of 1410 the Parliament
called for the appointment of a Continual Council. The Council was appointed, and the Prince
placed at its head. His energy was soon seen in a more active interposition in the affairs
of France. So bitter had the hatred grown between the Burgundian and Armagnac parties that
both in turn appealed again to England for help. The Burgundian alliance found favour with
the Council. In August, 1411, the Duke of Burgundy offered his daughter in marriage to the
Prince as the price of English aid, and four thousand men with Lord Cobham among their leaders
were sent to join his forces at Paris. Their help enabled Duke John to bring his opponents
to battle at St. Cloud, and to win a decisive victory in November. But already the king was
showing himself impatient of the Council's control; and the Parliament significantly prayed
that "as there had been a great murmur among your people that you have had in your heart a
heavy load against some of your lieges come to this present Parliament," they might be formally
declared to be "faithful lieges and servants." The prayer was granted, but in spite of the
support which the Houses gave to the Prince, Henry the Fourth was resolute to assert his power.
At the close of 1411 he declared his will to stand in as great freedom, prerogative, and franchise
as any of his predecessors had done, and annulled on that ground the appointment of the Continual
Council.

[Sidenote: Death of Henry the Fourth]

The king's blow had been dealt at the instigation of his queen, and it seems to have been prompted
as much by a resolve to change the outer policy which the Prince had adopted as to free himself
from the Council. The dismissal of the English troops by John of Burgundy after his victory
at St. Cloud had irritated the English Court; and the Duke of Orleans took advantage of this
turn of feeling to offer Catharine, the French king's daughter, in marriage to the Prince,
and to promise the restoration of all that England claimed in Guienne and Poitou. In spite
of the efforts of the Prince and the Duke of Burgundy a treaty of alliance with Orleans was
signed on these terms in May, 1412, and a force under the king's second son, the Duke of Clarence,
disembarked at La Hogue. But the very profusion of the Orleanist offers threw doubt on their
sincerity. The Duke was only using the English aid to put a pressure on his antagonist, and
its landing in August at once brought John of Burgundy to a seeming submission. While Clarence
penetrated by Normandy and Maine into the Orleanais and a second English force sailed for Calais,
both the French parties joined in pledging their services to King Charles "against his adversary
of England." Before this union Clarence was forced in November to accept promise of payment
for his men from the Duke of Orleans and to fall back on Bordeaux. The failure no doubt gave
fresh strength to Prince Henry. In the opening of 1412 he had been discharged from the Council
and Clarence set in his place at its head; he had been defeated in his attempts to renew the
Burgundian alliance, and had striven in vain to hinder Clarence from sailing. The break grew
into an open quarrel. Letters were sent into various counties refuting the charges of the Prince's
detractors, and in September Henry himself appeared before his father with a crowd of his friends
and supporters demanding the punishment of those who accused him. The charges made against
him were that he sought to bring about the king's removal from the throne; and "the great recourse
of people unto him, of which his court was at all times more abundant than his father's," gave
colour to the accusation. Henry the Fourth owned his belief in these charges, but promised
to call a Parliament for his son's vindication; and the Parliament met in the February of 1413.
But a new attack of epilepsy had weakened the king's strength; and though galleys were gathered
for a Crusade which he had vowed he was too weak to meet the Houses on their assembly. If we
may trust a charge which was afterwards denied, the king's half-brother, Bishop Henry of Winchester,
one of the Beaufort children of John of Gaunt, acting in secret co-operation with the Prince,
now brought the peers to pray Henry to suffer his son to be crowned in his stead. The king's
refusal was the last act of a dying man. Before the end of March he breathed his last in the
"Jerusalem Chamber" within the Abbot's house at Westminster; and the Prince obtained the crown
which he had sought.

[Sidenote: Suppression of the Lollards]

The removal of Archbishop Arundel from the Chancellorship, which was given to Henry Beaufort
of Winchester, was among the first acts of Henry the Fifth; and it is probable that this blow
at the great foe of the Lollards gave encouragement to the hopes of Oldcastle. He seized the
opportunity of the coronation in April to press his opinions on the young king, though probably
rather with a view to the plunder of the Church than to any directly religious end. From the
words of the clerical chroniclers it is plain that Henry had no mind as yet for any open strife
with either party, and that he quietly put the matter aside. He was in fact busy with foreign
affairs. The Duke of Clarence was recalled from Bordeaux, and a new truce concluded with France.
The policy of Henry was clearly to look on for a while at the shifting politics of the distracted
kingdom. Soon after his accession another revolution in Paris gave the charge of the mad King
Charles, and with it the nominal government of the realm, to the Duke of Orleans; and his cause
derived fresh strength from the support of the young Dauphin, who was afterwards to play so
great a part in the history of France as Charles the Seventh. John of Burgundy withdrew to
Flanders, and both parties again sought Henry's aid. But his hands were tied as yet by trouble
at home. Oldcastle was far from having abandoned his projects, discouraged as they had been
by his master; while the suspicions of Henry's favour to the Lollard cause which could hardly
fail to be roused by his favour to the Lollard leader only spurred the bold spirit of Arundel
to energetic action. A council of bishops gathered in the summer to denounce Lollardry and
at once called on Henry to suffer Oldcastle to be brought to justice. The king pleaded for
delay in the case of one who was so close a friend, and strove personally to convince Lord
Cobham of his errors. All however was in vain, and Oldcastle withdrew to his castle of Cowling,
while Arundel summoned him before his court and convicted him as a heretic. His open defiance
at last forced the king to act. In September a body of royal troops arrested Lord Cobham and
carried him to the Tower; but his life was still spared, and after a month's confinement his
imprisonment was relaxed on his promise of recantation. Cobham however had now resolved on
open resistance. He broke from the Tower in November, and from his hiding-place organized a
vast revolt. At the opening of 1414 a secret order summoned the Lollards to assemble in St.
Giles's Fields outside London. We gather, if not the real aims of the rising, at least the
terror it caused, from Henry's statement that its purpose was "to destroy himself, his brothers,
and several of the spiritual and temporal lords"; from Cobham's later declarations it is probable
that the pretext of the rising was to release Richard, whom he asserted to be still alive,
and to set him again on the throne. But the vigilance of the young king prevented the junction
of the Lollards within the city with their confederates without, and these as they appeared
at the place of meeting were dispersed by the royal troops.

[Sidenote: Renewal of the French War]

The failure of the rising only increased the rigour of the law. Magistrates were directed to
arrest all heretics and hand them over to the bishops; a conviction of heresy was made to entail
forfeiture of blood and estate; and the execution of thirty-nine prominent Lollards as traitors
gave terrible earnest of the king's resolve to suppress their sect. Oldcastle escaped, and
for four years longer strove to rouse revolt after revolt. He was at last captured on the Welsh
border and burned as a heretic; but from the moment when his attempt at revolt was crushed
in St. Giles's Fields the dread of Lollardry was broken and Henry was free to take a more energetic
course of policy on the other side the sea. He had already been silently preparing for action
by conciliatory measures, by restoring Henry Percy's son to the Earldom of Northumberland,
by the release of the Earl of March, and by the solemn burial of Richard the Second at Westminster.
The suppression of the Lollard revolt was followed by a demand for the restoration of the English
possessions in France, and by alliances and preparations for war. Burgundy stood aloof in a
sullen neutrality, and the Duke of Orleans, who was now virtually ruler of the French kingdom,
in vain proposed concession after concession. All negotiation indeed broke down when Henry
formally put forward his claim on the crown of France. No claim could have been more utterly
baseless, for the Parliamentary title by which the House of Lancaster held England could give
it no right over France, and the strict law of hereditary succession which Edward asserted
could be pleaded, if pleaded at all, only by the House of Mortimer. Not only the claim indeed,
but the very nature of the war itself was wholly different from that of Edward the Third. Edward
had been forced into the struggle against his will by the ceaseless attacks of France, and
his claim of the crown was little but an afterthought to secure the alliance of Flanders. The
war of Henry on the other hand, though in form a mere renewal of the earlier struggle on the
close of the truce made by Richard the Second, was in fact an aggression on the part of a nation
tempted by the helplessness of its opponent and galled by the memory of former defeat. Its
one excuse lay in the attacks which France for the past fifteen years had directed against
the Lancastrian throne, its encouragement of every enemy without and of every traitor within.
Henry may fairly have regarded such a ceaseless hostility, continued even through years of
weakness, as forcing him in sheer self-defence to secure his realm against the weightier attack
which might be looked for, should France recover her strength.

[Sidenote: Agincourt]

In the summer of 1415 the king prepared to sail from Southampton, when a plot reminded him
of the insecurity of his throne. The Earl of March was faithful: but he was childless, and
his claim would pass at his death through a sister who had wedded the Earl of Cambridge, a
son of the Duke of York, to her child Richard, the Duke who was to play so great a part in
the War of the Roses. It was to secure his boy's claims that the Earl of Cambridge seized on
the king's departure to conspire with Lord Scrope and Sir Thomas Grey to proclaim the Earl
of March king. The plot however was discovered and the plotters beheaded before the king sailed
in August for the Norman coast. His first exploit was the capture of Harfleur. Dysentery made
havoc in his ranks during the siege, and it was with a mere handful of men that he resolved
to insult the enemy by a daring march like that of Edward upon Calais. The discord however
on which he probably reckoned for security vanished before the actual appearance of the invaders
in the heart of France; and when his weary and half-starved force succeeded in crossing the
Somme it found sixty thousand Frenchmen encamped on the field of Agincourt right across its
line of march. Their position, flanked on either side by woods, but with a front so narrow
that the dense masses were drawn up thirty men deep, though strong for purposes of defence
was ill suited for attack; and the French leaders, warned by the experience of Crécy and Poitiers,
resolved to await the English advance. Henry on the other hand had no choice between attack
and unconditional surrender. His troops were starving, and the way to Calais lay across the
French army. But the king's courage rose with the peril. A knight in his train wished that
the thousands of stout warriors lying idle that night in England had been standing in his ranks.
Henry answered with a burst of scorn. "I would not have a single man more," he replied. "If
God give us the victory, it will be plain we owe it to His grace. If not, the fewer we are,
the less loss for England." Starving and sick as they were, the handful of men whom he led
shared the spirit of their king. As the chill rainy night passed away he drew up his army on
the twenty-fifth of October and boldly gave battle. The English archers bared their arms and
breasts to give fair play to "the crooked stick and the grey goose wing," but for which--as
the rime ran--"England were but a fling," and with a great shout sprang forward to the attack.
The sight of their advance roused the fiery pride of the French; the wise resolve of their
leaders was forgotten, and the dense mass of men-at-arms plunged heavily forward through miry
ground on the English front. But at the first sign of movement Henry had halted his line, and
fixing in the ground the sharpened stakes with which each man was furnished his archers poured
their fatal arrow-flights into the hostile ranks. The carnage was terrible, for though the
desperate charges of the French knighthood at last drove the English archers to the neighbouring
woods, from the skirt of these woods they were still able to pour their shot into the enemy's
flanks, while Henry with the men-at-arms around him flung himself on the French line. In the
terrible struggle which followed the king bore off the palm of bravery: he was felled once
by a blow from a French mace and the crown of his helmet was cleft by the sword of the Duke
of Alençon; but the enemy was at last broken, and the defeat of the main body of the French
was followed by the rout of their reserve. The triumph was more complete, as the odds were
even greater, than at Crécy. Eleven thousand Frenchmen lay dead on the field, and more than
a hundred princes and great lords were among the fallen.

[Sidenote: Conquest of Normandy]

The immediate result of the battle of Agincourt was small, for the English army was too exhausted
for pursuit, and it made its way to Calais only to return to England. Through 1416 the war
was limited to a contest for the command of the Channel, till the increasing bitterness of
the strife between the Burgundians and Armagnacs, and the consent of John of Burgundy to conclude
an alliance, encouraged Henry to resume his attempt to recover Normandy. Whatever may have
been his aim in this enterprise--whether it were, as has been suggested, to provide a refuge
for his house, should its power be broken in England, or simply to acquire a command of the
seas--the patience and skill with which his object was accomplished raise him high in the rank
of military leaders. Disembarking in July 1417 with an army of forty thousand men near the
mouth of the Touque, he stormed Caen, received the surrender of Bayeux, reduced Alençon and
Falaise, and detaching his brother the Duke of Gloucester in the spring of 1418 to occupy the
Cotentin made himself master of Avranches and Domfront. With Lower Normandy wholly in his hands,
he advanced upon Evreux, captured Louviers, and seizing Pont-de-l'Arche, threw his troops across
the Seine. The end of these masterly movements was now revealed. Rouen was at this time the
largest and wealthiest of the towns of France; its walls were defended by a powerful artillery;
Alan Blanchard, a brave and resolute patriot, infused the fire of his own temper into the vast
population; and the garrison, already strong, was backed by fifteen thousand citizens in arms.
But the genius of Henry was more than equal to the difficulties with which he had to deal.
He had secured himself from an attack on his rear by the reduction of Lower Normandy, his earlier
occupation of Harfleur severed the town from the sea, and his conquest of Pont-de-l'Arche cut
it off from relief on the side of Paris. Slowly but steadily the king drew his lines of investment
round the doomed city; a flotilla was brought up from Harfleur, a bridge of boats thrown over
the Seine above the town, the deep trenches of the besiegers protected by posts, and the desperate
sallies of the garrison stubbornly beaten back. For six months Rouen held resolutely out, but
famine told fast on the vast throng of country folk who had taken refuge within its walls.
Twelve thousand of these were at last thrust out of the city gates, but the cold policy of
the conqueror refused them passage, and they perished between the trenches and the walls. In
the hour of their agony women gave birth to infants, but even the new-born babes which were
drawn up in baskets to receive baptism were lowered again to die on their mothers' breasts.
It was little better within the town itself. As winter drew on one-half of the population wasted
away. "War," said the terrible king, "has three handmaidens ever waiting on her, Fire, Blood,
and Famine, and I have chosen the meekest maid of the three." But his demand of unconditional
surrender nerved the citizens to a resolve of despair; they determined to fire the city and
fling themselves in a mass on the English lines; and Henry, fearful lest his prize should escape
him at the last, was driven to offer terms. Those who rejected a foreign yoke were suffered
to leave the city, but his vengeance reserved its victim in Alan Blanchard, and the brave patriot
was at Henry's orders put to death in cold blood.

[Sidenote: Death of Henry the Fifth]

A few sieges completed the reduction of Normandy. The king's designs were still limited to
the acquisition of that province; and pausing in his career of conquest, he strove to win its
loyalty by a remission of taxation and a redress of grievances, and to seal its possession
by a formal peace with the French Crown. The conferences however which were held for this purpose
at Pontoise in 1419 failed through the temporary reconciliation of the French factions, while
the length and expense of the war began to rouse remonstrance and discontent at home. The king's
difficulties were at their height when the assassination of John of Burgundy at Montereau in
the very presence of the Dauphin with whom he had come to hold conference rekindled the fires
of civil strife. The whole Burgundian party with the new Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good,
at its head flung itself in a wild thirst for revenge into Henry's hands. The mad king, Charles
the Sixth, with his queen and daughters was in Philip's power; and in his resolve to exclude
the Dauphin from the throne the Duke stooped to buy English aid by giving Catharine, the eldest
of the French princesses, in marriage to Henry, by conferring on him the Regency during the
life of Charles, and recognizing his succession to the crown at that sovereign's death. A treaty
which embodied these terms was solemnly ratified by Charles himself in a conference at Troyes
in May 1420; and Henry, who in his new capacity of Regent undertook to conquer in the name
of his father-in-law the territory held by the Dauphin, reduced the towns of the Upper Seine,
and at Christmas entered Paris in triumph side by side with the king. The States-General of
the realm were solemnly convened to the capital; and strange as the provisions of the Treaty
of Troyes must have seemed they were confirmed without a murmur. Henry was formally recognized
as the future sovereign of France. A defeat of his brother Clarence at Baugé in Anjou in the
spring of 1421 called him back to the war. His reappearance in the field was marked by the
capture of Dreux, and a repulse before Orleans was redeemed in the summer of 1422 by his success
in the long and obstinate siege of Meaux. At no time had the fortunes of Henry reached a higher
pitch than at the moment when he felt the touch of death. In the month which followed the surrender
of Meaux he fell ill at Corbeil; the rapidity of his disease baffled the skill of the physicians;
and at the close of August, with a strangely characteristic regret that he had not lived to
achieve the conquest of Jerusalem, the great conqueror passed away.

CHAPTER VI THE WARS OF THE ROSES 1422-1461

[Sidenote: Plans of Henry V]

At the moment when death so suddenly stayed his course the greatness of Henry the Fifth had
reached its highest point. In England his victories had hushed the last murmurs of disaffection.
The death of the Earl of Cambridge, the childhood of his son, removed all danger from the claims
of the house of York. The ruin of Lord Cobham, the formal condemnation of Wyclif's doctrines
in the Council of Constance, broke the political and the religious strength of Lollardry. Henry
had won the Church by his orthodoxy, the nobles by his warlike prowess, the whole people by
his revival of the glories of Crécy and Poitiers. In France his cool policy had transformed
him from a foreign conqueror into a legal heir to the crown. The King was in his hands, the
Queen devoted to his cause, the Duke of Burgundy was his ally, his title of Regent and of successor
to the throne rested on the formal recognition of the estates of the realm. Although southern
France still clung to the Dauphin, the progress of Henry to the very moment of his death promised
a speedy mastery of the whole country. His European position was a commanding one. Lord of
the two great western kingdoms, he was linked by close ties of blood with the royal lines of
Portugal and Castille; and his restless activity showed itself in his efforts to procure the
adoption of his brother John as her successor by the queen of Naples, and in the marriage of
a younger brother, Humphrey, with Jacqueline, the Countess of Holland and Hainault. Dreams
of a vaster enterprise filled the soul of the great conqueror himself; he loved to read the
story of Godfrey of Bouillon and cherished the hope of a crusade which should beat back the
Ottoman and again rescue the Holy Land from heathen hands. Such a crusade might still have
saved Constantinople, and averted from Europe the danger which threatened it through the century
that followed the fall of the imperial city. Nor was the enterprise a dream in the hands of
the cool, practical warrior and ruler of whom a contemporary could say, "He transacts all his
affairs himself, he considers well before he undertakes them, he never does anything fruitlessly."

[Sidenote: John of Bedford]

But the hopes of far-off conquests found a sudden close in Henry's death. His son, Henry the
Sixth of England, was a child of but nine months old: and though he was peacefully recognized
as king in his English realm and as heir to the throne in the realm of France his position
was a very different one from his father's. The death of King Charles indeed, two months after
that of his son-in-law, did little to weaken it; and at first nothing seemed lost. The Dauphin
at once proclaimed himself Charles the Seventh of France: but Henry was owned as Sovereign
over the whole of the territory which Charles had actually ruled; and the incursions which
the partizans of Charles, now reinforced by Lombard soldiers from the Milanese and by four
thousand Scots under the Earl of Douglas, made with fresh vigour across the Loire were easily
repulsed by Duke John of Bedford, the late king's brother, who had been named in his will Regent
of France. In genius for war as in political capacity John was hardly inferior to Henry himself.
Drawing closer his alliance with the Duke of Burgundy by marriage with that prince's sister,
and holding that of Britanny by a patient diplomacy, he completed the conquest of Northern
France, secured his communications with Normandy by the capture of Meulan, and made himself
master of the line of the Yonne by a victory near Auxerre. In 1424 the Constable of Buchan
pushed from the Loire to the very borders of Normandy to arrest his progress, and attacked
the English army at Verneuil. But a repulse hardly less disastrous than that of Agincourt left
a third of the French knighthood on the field: and the Regent was preparing to cross the Loire
for a final struggle with "the King of Bourges" as the English in mockery called Charles the
Seventh when his career of victory was broken by troubles at home.

[Sidenote: Humphrey of Gloucester]

In England the Lancastrian throne was still too newly established to remain unshaken by the
succession of a child of nine months old. Nor was the younger brother of Henry the Fifth, Duke
Humphrey of Gloucester, whom the late king's will named as Regent of the realm, a man of the
same noble temper as the Duke of Bedford. Intellectually the figure of Humphrey is one of extreme
interest, for he is the first Englishman in whom we can trace the faint influence of that revival
of knowledge which was to bring about the coming renascence of the western world. Humphrey
was not merely a patron of poets and men of letters, of Lydgate and William of Worcester and
Abbot Whethamstede of St. Albans, as his brother and other princes of the day had been, but
his patronage seems to have sprung from a genuine interest in learning itself. He was a zealous
collector of books and was able to bequeath to the University of Oxford a library of a hundred
and thirty volumes. A gift of books indeed was a passport to his favour, and before the title
of each volume he possessed the Duke wrote words which expressed his love of them, "moun bien
mondain," "my worldly goods"! Lydgate tells us how "notwithstanding his state and dignyte his
corage never doth appalle to studie in books of antiquitie." His studies drew him to the revival
of classic learning which was becoming a passion across the Alps. One wandering scholar from
Forli, who took the pompous name of Titus Livius and who wrote at his request the biography
of Henry the Fifth, Humphrey made his court poet and orator. The Duke probably aided Poggio
Bracciolini in his search for classical manuscripts when he visited England in 1420. Leonardo
Aretino, one of the scholars who gathered about Cosmo de Medici, dedicated to him a translation
of the Politics of Aristotle, and when another Italian scholar sent him a fragment of a translation
of Plato's Republic the Duke wrote to beg him to send the rest. But with its love of learning
Humphrey combined the restlessness, the immorality, the selfish, boundless ambition which characterized
the age of the Renascence. His life was sullied by sensual excesses, his greed of power shook
his nephew's throne. So utterly was he already distrusted that the late king's nomination of
him as Regent was set aside by the royal Council, and he was suffered only to preside at its
deliberations with the nominal title of Protector during Bedford's absence. The real direction
of affairs fell into the hands of his uncle, Henry Beaufort, the Bishop of Winchester, a legitimated
son of John of Gaunt by his mistress Catharine Swynford.

[Sidenote: Jacqueline of Hainault]

Two years of useless opposition disgusted the Duke with this nominal Protectorship, and in
1424 he left the realm to push his fortunes in the Netherlands. Jacqueline, the daughter and
heiress of William, Count of Holland and Hainault, had originally wedded John, Duke of Brabant;
but after a few years of strife she had procured a divorce from one of the three claimants
who now disputed the Papacy, and at the close of Henry the Fifth's reign she had sought shelter
in England. At his brother's death the Duke of Gloucester avowed his marriage with her and
adopted her claims as his own. To support them in arms however was to alienate Philip of Burgundy,
who was already looking forward to the inheritance of his childless nephew, the Duke of Brabant;
and as the alliance with Burgundy was the main strength of the English cause in France, neither
Bedford, who had shown his sense of its value by a marriage with the Duke's sister, nor the
English council were likely to support measures which would imperil or weaken it. Such considerations
however had little weight with Humphrey; and in October 1424 he set sail for Calais without
their knowledge with a body of five thousand men. In a few months he succeeded in restoring
Hainault to Jacqueline, and Philip at once grew lukewarm in his adherence to the English cause.
Though Bedford's efforts prevented any final break, the Duke withdrew his forces from France
to aid John of Brabant in the recovery of Hainault and Holland. Gloucester challenged Philip
to decide their claims by single combat. But the enterprise was abandoned as hastily as it
had been begun. The Duke of Gloucester was already disgusted with Jacqueline and enamoured
of a lady in her suite, Eleanor, the daughter of Lord Cobham; and in the summer of 1425 he
suddenly returned with her to England and left his wife to defend herself as she might.

[Sidenote: Henry Beaufort]

What really called him back was more than his passion for Eleanor Cobham or the natural versatility
of his temper; it was the advance of a rival in England to further power over the realm. This
was his uncle, Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester. The bishop had already played a leading
political part. He was charged with having spurred Henry the Fifth to the ambitious demands
of power which he made during his father's lifetime; he became chancellor on his accession;
and at his death the king left him guardian of the person of his boy. He looked on Gloucester's
ambition as a danger to his charge, withstood his recognition as Regent, and remained at the
head of the Council that reduced his office of Protector to a name. The Duke's absence in Hainault
gave fresh strength to his opponent: and the nomination of the Bishop to the Chancellorship
marked him out as the virtual ruler of the realm. On the news of this appointment Gloucester
hurried back to accept what he looked on as a challenge to open strife. The Londoners rose
in his name to attack Beaufort's palace in Southwark, and at the close of 1425 Bedford had
to quit his work in France to appease the strife. In the following year Gloucester laid a formal
bill of accusation against the bishop before the Parliament, but its rejection forced him to
a show of reconciliation, and Bedford was able to return to France. Hardly was he gone however
when the quarrel began anew. Humphrey found a fresh weapon against Beaufort in his acceptance
of the dignity of a Cardinal and of a Papal Legate in England; and the jealousy which this
step aroused drove the Bishop to withdraw for a while from the Council and to give place to
his unscrupulous opponent.

[Sidenote: Siege of Orleans]

Beaufort possessed an administrative ability, the loss of which was a heavy blow to the struggling
Regent over sea, where Humphrey's restless ambition had already paralyzed Bedford's efforts.
Much of his strength rested on his Burgundian ally, and the force of Burgundy was drawn to
other quarters. Though Hainault had been easily won back on Gloucester's retreat and Jacqueline
taken prisoner, her escape from prison enabled her to hold Holland for three years against
the forces of the Duke of Brabant and after his death against those of the Duke of Burgundy
to whom he bequeathed his dominions. The political strife in England itself was still more
fatal in diverting the supplies of men and money which were needful for a vigorous prosecution
of the war. To maintain even the handful of forces left to him Bedford was driven to have recourse
to mere forays which did little but increase the general misery. The north of France indeed
was being fast reduced to a desert by the bands of marauders which traversed it. The husbandmen
fled for refuge to the towns till these in fear of famine shut their gates against them. Then
in their despair they threw themselves into the woods and became brigands in their turn. So
terrible was the devastation that two hostile bodies of troops failed at one time even to find
one another in the desolate Beauce. Misery and disease killed a hundred thousand people in
Paris alone. At last the cessation of the war in Holland and the temporary lull of strife in
England enabled the Regent to take up again his long-interrupted advance upon the South. Orleans
was the key to the Loire; and its reduction would throw open Bourges where Charles held his
court. Bedford's resources indeed were still inadequate for such a siege; and though the arrival
of reinforcements from England under the Earl of Salisbury enabled him to invest it in October
1428 with ten thousand men, the fact that so small a force could undertake the siege of such
a town as Orleans shows at once the exhaustion of England and the terror which still hung over
France. As the siege went on however even these numbers were reduced. A new fit of jealousy
on the part of the Duke of Burgundy brought about a recall of his soldiers from the siege,
and after their withdrawal only three thousand Englishmen remained in the trenches. But the
long series of English victories had so demoralized the French soldiery, that in February 1429
a mere detachment of archers under Sir John Fastolfe repulsed a whole army in what was called
"the Battle of the Herrings" from the convoy of provisions which the victors brought in triumph
into the camp before Orleans. Though the town swarmed with men-at-arms not a single sally was
ventured on through the six months' siege, and Charles the Seventh did nothing for its aid
but shut himself up in Chinon and weep helplessly.

[Sidenote: Jeanne Darc]

But the success of this handful of besiegers rested wholly on the spell of terror which had
been cast over France, and at this moment the appearance of a peasant maiden broke the spell.
Jeanne Darc was the child of a labourer of Domrémy, a little village in the neighbourhood of
Vaucouleurs on the borders of Lorraine and Champagne. Just without the cottage where she was
born began the great woods of the Vosges where the children of Domrémy drank in poetry and
legend from fairy ring and haunted well, hung their flower garlands on the sacred trees, and
sang songs to the "good people" who might not drink of the fountain because of their sins.
Jeanne loved the forest; its birds and beasts came lovingly to her at her childish call. But
at home men saw nothing in her but "a good girl, simple and pleasant in her ways," spinning
and sewing by her mother's side while the other girls went to the fields, tender to the poor
and sick, fond of church, and listening to the church-bell with a dreamy passion of delight
which never left her. This quiet life was broken by the storm of war as it at last came home
to Domrémy. As the outcasts and wounded passed by the little village the young peasant girl
gave them her bed and nursed them in their sickness. Her whole nature summed itself up in one
absorbing passion: she "had pity," to use the phrase for ever on her lip, "on the fair realm
of France." As her passion grew she recalled old prophecies that a maid from the Lorraine border
should save the land; she saw visions; St. Michael appeared to her in a flood of blinding light,
and bade her go to the help of the king and restore to him his realm. "Messire," answered the
girl, "I am but a poor maiden; I know not how to ride to the wars, or to lead men-at-arms."
The archangel returned to give her courage, and to tell her of "the pity" that there was in
heaven for the fair realm of France. The girl wept and longed that the angels who appeared
to her would carry her away, but her mission was clear. It was in vain that her father when
he heard her purpose swore to drown her ere she should go to the field with men-at-arms. It
was in vain that the priest, the wise people of the village, the captain of Vaucouleurs, doubted
and refused to aid her. "I must go to the King," persisted the peasant girl, "even if I wear
my limbs to the very knees." "I had far rather rest and spin by my mother's side," she pleaded
with a touching pathos, "for this is no work of my choosing, but I must go and do it, for my
Lord wills it." "And who," they asked, "is your Lord?" "He is God." Words such as these touched
the rough captain at last: he took Jeanne by the hand and swore to lead her to the king. She
reached Chinon in the opening of March, but here too she found hesitation and doubt. The theologians
proved from their books that they ought not to believe her. "There is more in God's book than
in yours," Jeanne answered simply. At last Charles himself received her in the midst of a throng
of nobles and soldiers. "Gentle Dauphin," said the girl, "my name is Jeanne the Maid. The Heavenly
King sends me to tell you that you shall be anointed and crowned in the town of Reims, and
you shall be lieutenant of the Heavenly King who is the King of France."

[Sidenote: Relief of Orleans]

Orleans had already been driven by famine to offers of surrender when Jeanne appeared in the
French court, and a force was gathering under the Count of Dunois at Blois for a final effort
at its relief. It was at the head of this force that Jeanne placed herself. The girl was in
her eighteenth year, tall, finely formed, with all the vigour and activity of her peasant rearing,
able to stay from dawn to nightfall on horseback without meat or drink. As she mounted her
charger, clad in white armour from head to foot, with a great white banner studded with fleur-de-lys
waving over her head, she seemed "a thing wholly divine, whether to see or hear." The ten thousand
men-at-arms who followed her from Blois, rough plunderers whose only prayer was that of La
Hire, "Sire Dieu, I pray you to do for La Hire what La Hire would do for you, were you captain-at-arms
and he God," left off their oaths and foul living at her word and gathered round the altars
on their march. Her shrewd peasant humour helped her to manage the wild soldiery, and her followers
laughed over their camp-fires at an old warrior who had been so puzzled by her prohibition
of oaths that she suffered him still to swear by his bâton. For in the midst of her enthusiasm
her good sense never left her. The people crowded round her as she rode along, praying her
to work miracles, and bringing crosses and chaplets to be blest by her touch. "Touch them yourself,"
she said to an old Dame Margaret; "your touch will be just as good as mine." But her faith
in her mission remained as firm as ever. "The Maid prays and requires you," she wrote to Bedford,
"to work no more distraction in France but to come in her company to rescue the Holy Sepulchre
from the Turk." "I bring you," she told Dunois when he sallied out of Orleans to meet her after
her two days' march from Blois, "I bring you the best aid ever sent to any one, the aid of
the King of Heaven." The besiegers looked on overawed as she entered Orleans and, riding round
the walls, bade the people shake off their fear of the forts which surrounded them. Her enthusiasm
drove the hesitating generals to engage the handful of besiegers, and the enormous disproportion
of forces at once made itself felt. Fort after fort was taken till only the strongest remained,
and then the council of war resolved to adjourn the attack. "You have taken your counsel,"
replied Jeanne, "and I take mine." Placing herself at the head of the men-at-arms, she ordered
the gates to be thrown open, and led them against the fort. Few as they were, the English fought
desperately, and the Maid, who had fallen wounded while endeavouring to scale its walls, was
borne into a vineyard, while Dunois sounded the retreat. "Wait a while!" the girl imperiously
pleaded, "eat and drink! so soon as my standard touches the wall you shall enter the fort."
It touched, and the assailants burst in. On the next day the siege was abandoned, and on the
eighth of May the force which had conducted it withdrew in good order to the north.

[Sidenote: Coronation of Charles]

In the midst of her triumph Jeanne still remained the pure, tender-hearted peasant girl of
the Vosges. Her first visit as she entered Orleans was to the great church, and there, as she
knelt at mass, she wept in such a passion of devotion that "all the people wept with her."
Her tears burst forth afresh at her first sight of bloodshed and of the corpses strewn over
the battle-field. She grew frightened at her first wound, and only threw off the touch of womanly
fear when she heard the signal for retreat. Yet more womanly was the purity with which she
passed through the brutal warriors of a mediæval camp. It was her care for her honour that
led her to clothe herself in a soldier's dress. She wept hot tears when told of the foul taunts
of the English, and called passionately on God to witness her chastity. "Yield thee, yield
thee, Glasdale," she cried to the English warrior whose insults had been foulest as he fell
wounded at her feet; "you called me harlot! I have great pity on your soul." But all thought
of herself was lost in the thought of her mission. It was in vain that the French generals
strove to remain on the Loire. Jeanne was resolute to complete her task, and while the English
remained panic-stricken around Paris she brought Charles to march upon Reims, the old crowning-place
of the kings of France. Troyes and Châlons submitted as she reached them, Reims drove out the
English garrison and threw open her gates to the king.

[Sidenote: Capture of Jeanne]

With his coronation the Maid felt her errand to be over. "O gentle King, the pleasure of God
is done," she cried, as she flung herself at the feet of Charles and asked leave to go home.
"Would it were His good will," she pleaded with the Archbishop as he forced her to remain,
"that I might go and keep sheep once more with my sisters and my brothers: they would be so
glad to see me again!" But the policy of the French Court detained her while the cities of
the North of France opened their gates to the newly-consecrated king. Bedford however, who
had been left without money or men, had now received reinforcements. Excluded as Cardinal Beaufort
had been from the Council by Gloucester's intrigues, he poured his wealth without stint into
the exhausted treasury till his loans to the Crown reached the sum of half-a-million; and at
this crisis he unscrupulously diverted an army which he had levied at his own cost for a crusade
against the Hussites in Bohemia to his nephew's aid. The tide of success turned again. Charles,
after a repulse before the walls of Paris, fell back behind the Loire; while the towns on the
Oise submitted anew to the Duke of Burgundy, whose more active aid Bedford had bought by the
cession of Champagne. In the struggle against Duke Philip Jeanne fought with her usual bravery
but with the fatal consciousness that her mission was at an end, and during the defence of
Compiègne in the May of 1430 she fell into the power of the Bastard of Vendôme, to be sold
by her captor into the hands of the Duke of Burgundy and by the Duke into the hands of the
English. To the English her triumphs were victories of sorcery, and after a year's imprisonment
she was brought to trial on a charge of heresy before an ecclesiastical court with the Bishop
of Beauvais at its head.

[Sidenote: Death of Jeanne]

Throughout the long process which followed every art was used to entangle her in her talk.
But the simple shrewdness of the peasant girl foiled the efforts of her judges. "Do you believe,"
they asked, "that you are in a state of grace?" "If I am not," she replied, "God will put me
in it. If I am, God will keep me in it." Her capture, they argued, showed that God had forsaken
her. "Since it has pleased God that I should be taken," she answered meekly, "it is for the
best." "Will you submit," they demanded at last, "to the judgement of the Church Militant?"
"I have come to the King of France," Jeanne replied, "by commission from God and from the Church
Triumphant above: to that Church I submit." "I had far rather die," she ended passionately,
"than renounce what I have done by my Lord's command." They deprived her of mass. "Our Lord
can make me hear it without your aid," she said, weeping. "Do your voices," asked the judges,
"forbid you to submit to the Church and the Pope?" "Ah, no! our Lord first served." Sick, and
deprived of all religious aid, it was no wonder that as the long trial dragged on and question
followed question Jeanne's firmness wavered. On the charge of sorcery and diabolical possession
she still appealed firmly to God. "I hold to my Judge," she said, as her earthly judges gave
sentence against her, "to the King of Heaven and Earth. God has always been my Lord in all
that I have done. The devil has never had power over me." It was only with a view to be delivered
from the military prison and transferred to the prisons of the Church that she consented to
a formal abjuration of heresy. She feared in fact among the soldiery those outrages to her
honour, to guard against which she had from the first assumed the dress of a man. In the eyes
of the Church her dress was a crime and she abandoned it; but a renewed affront forced her
to resume the one safeguard left her, and the return to it was treated as a relapse into heresy
which doomed her to death. At the close of May, 1431, a great pile was raised in the market-place
of Rouen where her statue stands now. Even the brutal soldiers who snatched the hated "witch"
from the hands of the clergy and hurried her to her doom were hushed as she reached the stake.
One indeed passed to her a rough cross he had made from a stick he held, and she clasped it
to her bosom. As her eyes ranged over the city from the lofty scaffold she was heard to murmur,
"O Rouen, Rouen, I have great fear lest you suffer for my death." "Yes! my voices were of God!"
she suddenly cried as the last moment came; "they have never deceived me!" Soon the flames
reached her, the girl's head sank on her breast, there was one cry of "Jesus!"--"We are lost,"
an English soldier muttered as the crowd broke up; "we have burned a Saint."

[Sidenote: Death of Bedford]

The English cause was indeed irretrievably lost. In spite of a pompous coronation of the boy-king
Henry at Paris at the close of 1431, Bedford with the cool wisdom of his temper seems to have
abandoned from this time all hope of permanently retaining France and to have fallen back on
his brother's original plan of securing Normandy. Henry's Court was established for a year
at Rouen, a university founded at Caen, and whatever rapine and disorder might be permitted
elsewhere, justice, good government, and security for trade were steadily maintained through
the favoured provinces. At home Bedford was resolutely backed by Cardinal Beaufort, whose services
to the state as well as his real powers had at last succeeded in outweighing Duke Humphrey's
opposition and in restoring him to the head of the royal Council. Beaufort's diplomatic ability
was seen in the truces he wrung from Scotland, and in his personal efforts to prevent the impending
reconciliation of the Duke of Burgundy with the French king. But the death of the duke's sister,
who was the wife of Bedford, severed the last link which bound Philip to the English cause.
He pressed for peace: and conferences for this purpose were held at Arras in 1435. Their failure
only served him as a pretext for concluding a formal treaty with Charles; and his desertion
was followed by a yet more fatal blow to the English cause in the death of Bedford. The loss
of the Regent was the signal for the loss of Paris. In the spring of 1436 the city rose suddenly
against its English garrison and declared for King Charles. Henry's dominion shrank at once
to Normandy and the outlying fortresses of Picardy and Maine. But reduced as they were to a
mere handful, and fronted by a whole nation in arms, the English soldiers struggled on with
as desperate a bravery as in their days of triumph. Lord Talbot, the most daring of their leaders,
forded the Somme with the water up to his chin to relieve Crotoy, and threw his men across
the Oise in the face of a French army to relieve Pontoise.

[Sidenote: Richard of York]

Bedford found for the moment an able and vigorous successor in the Duke of York. Richard of
York was the son of the Earl of Cambridge who had been beheaded by Henry the Fifth; his mother
was Anne, the heiress of the Mortimers and of their claim to the English crown as representatives
of the third son of Edward the Third, Lionel of Clarence. It was to assert this claim on his
son's behalf that the Earl embarked in the fatal plot which cost him his head. But his death
left Richard a mere boy in the wardship of the Crown, and for years to come all danger from
his pretensions was at an end. Nor did the young Duke give any sign of a desire to assert them
as he grew to manhood. He appeared content with a lineage and wealth which placed him at the
head of the English baronage; for he had inherited from his uncle the Dukedom of York, his
wide possessions embraced the estates of the families which united in him, the houses of York,
of Clarence, and of Mortimer, and his double descent from Edward the Third, if it did no more,
set him near to the Crown. The nobles looked up to him as the head of their order, and his
political position recalled that of the Lancastrian Earls at an earlier time. But the position
of Richard was as yet that of a faithful servant of the Crown; and as Regent of France he displayed
the abilities both of a statesman and of a general. During the brief space of his regency the
tide of ill fortune was stemmed; and towns and castles were recovered along the border.

[Sidenote: Eleanor Cobham]

His recall after a twelvemonth's success is the first indication of the jealousy which the
ruling house felt of triumphs gained by one who might some day assert his claim to the throne.
Two years later, in 1440, the Duke was restored to his post, but it was now too late to do
more than stand on the defensive, and all York's ability was required to preserve Normandy
and Maine. Men and money alike came scantily from England--where the Duke of Gloucester, freed
from the check which Bedford had laid on him while he lived, was again stirring against Beaufort
and the Council. But his influence had been weakened by a marriage with his mistress, Eleanor
Cobham, and in 1441 it was all but destroyed by an incident which paints the temper of the
time. The restless love of knowledge which was the one redeeming feature in Duke Humphrey's
character drew to him not only scholars but a horde of the astrologers and claimants of magical
powers, who were the natural product of an age in which the faith of the Middle Ages was dying
out before the double attack of scepticism and heresy. Amongst these was a priest named Roger
Bolinbroke. Bolinbroke was seized on a charge of compassing the king's death by sorcery; and
the sudden flight of Eleanor Cobham to the sanctuary at Westminster was soon explained by a
like accusation. Her judges found that she had made a waxen image of the king and slowly melted
it at a fire, a process which was held to account for Henry's growing weakness both of body
and mind. The Duchess was doomed to penance for her crime; she was led bareheaded and barefooted
in a white penance-sheet through the streets of London, and then thrown into prison for life.
Humphrey never rallied from the blow. But his retirement from public affairs was soon followed
by that of his rival, Cardinal Beaufort. Age forced Beaufort to withdraw to Winchester; and
the Council was from that time swayed mainly by the Earl of Suffolk, William de la Pole, a
grandson of the minister of Richard the Second.

[Sidenote: The Beauforts]

Few houses had served the Crown more faithfully than that of De la Pole. His father fell at
the siege of Harfleur; his brother had been slain at Agincourt; William himself had served
and been taken prisoner in the war with France. But as a statesman he was powerless in the
hands of the Beauforts, and from this moment the policy of the Beauforts drew England nearer
and nearer to the chaos of civil war. John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and his brother, Edmund,
Earl of Dorset, were now the representatives of this house. They were grandsons of John of
Gaunt by his mistress, Catharine Swynford. In later days Catharine became John's wife, and
his uncle's influence over Richard at the close of that king's reign was shown in a royal ordinance
which legitimated those of his children by her who had been born before marriage. The ordinance
was confirmed by an Act of Parliament, which as it passed the Houses was expressed in the widest
and most general terms; but before issuing this as a statute Henry the Fourth inserted provisions
which left the Beauforts illegitimate in blood so far as regarded the inheritance of the crown.
Such royal alterations of statutes however had been illegal since the time of Edward the Third;
and the Beauforts never recognized the force of this provision. But whether they stood in the
line of succession or no, the favour which was shown them alike by Henry the Fifth and his
son drew them close to the throne, and the weakness of Henry the Sixth left them at this moment
the mainstay of the House of Lancaster. Edmund Beaufort had taken an active part in the French
wars, and had distinguished himself by the capture of Harfleur and the relief of Calais. But
he was hated for his pride and avarice, and the popular hate grew as he showed his jealousy
of the Duke of York. Loyal indeed as Richard had proved himself as yet, the pretensions of
his house were the most formidable danger which fronted the throne; and with a weak and imbecile
king we can hardly wonder that the Beauforts deemed it madness to leave in the Duke's hands
the wide power of a Regent in France and the command of the armies across the sea. In 1444
York was recalled, and his post was taken by Edmund Beaufort himself.

[Sidenote: Loss of Normandy]

But the claim which York drew from the house of Mortimer was not his only claim to the crown;
as the descendant of Edward the Third's fifth son the crown would naturally devolve upon him
on the extinction of the House of Lancaster, and of the direct line of that house Henry the
Sixth was the one survivor. It was to check these hopes by continuing the Lancastrian succession
that Suffolk in 1445 brought about the marriage of the young king with Margaret, the daughter
of Duke René of Anjou. But the marriage had another end. The English ministers were anxious
for the close of the war; and in the kinship between Margaret and King Charles of France they
saw a chance of bringing it about. A truce was concluded as a prelude to a future peace, and
the marriage-treaty paved the way for it by ceding not only Anjou, of which England possessed
nothing, but Maine, the bulwark of Normandy, to Duke René. For his part in this negotiation
Suffolk was raised to the rank of marquis; but the terms of the treaty and the delays which
still averted a final peace gave new strength to the war-party with Gloucester at its head,
and troubles were looked for in the Parliament which met at the opening of 1447. The danger
was roughly met. Gloucester was arrested as he rode to Parliament on a charge of secret conspiracy;
and a few days later he was found dead in his lodging. Suspicions of murder were added to the
hatred against Suffolk; and his voluntary submission to an enquiry by the Council into his
conduct in the marriage-treaty, which was followed by his acquittal of all blame, did little
to counteract this. What was yet more fatal to Suffolk was the renewal of the war. In the face
of the agitation against it the English ministers had never dared to execute the provisions
of the marriage-treaty; and in 1448 Charles the Seventh sent an army to enforce the cession
of Le Mans. Its surrender averted the struggle for a moment. But in the spring of 1449 a body
of English soldiers from Normandy, mutinous at their want of pay, crossed the border and sacked
the rich town of Fougères in Britanny. Edmund Beaufort, who had now succeeded to the dukedom
of Somerset, protested his innocence of this breach of truce, but he either could not or would
not make restitution, and the war was renewed. From this moment it was a mere series of French
successes. In two months half Normandy was in the hands of Dunois; Rouen rose against her feeble
garrison and threw open her gates to Charles; and the defeat at Fourmigny of an English force
which was sent to Somerset's aid was a signal for revolt throughout the rest of the provinces.
The surrender of Cherbourg in August, 1450, left Henry not a foot of Norman ground.

[Sidenote: National discontent]

The loss of Normandy was generally laid to the charge of Somerset. He was charged with a miserly
hoarding of supplies as well as planning in conjunction with Suffolk the fatal sack of Fougères.
His incapacity as a general added to the resentment at his recall of the Duke of York, a recall
which had been marked as a disgrace by the despatch of Richard into an honourable banishment
as lieutenant of Ireland. But it was this very recall which proved most helpful to York. Had
he remained in France he could hardly have averted the loss of Normandy, though he might have
delayed it. As it was the shame of its loss fell upon Somerset, while the general hatred of
the Beauforts and the growing contempt of the king whom they ruled expressed itself in a sudden
rush of popular favour towards the man whom his disgrace had marked out as the object of their
ill-will. From this moment the hopes of a better and a stronger government centred themselves
in the Duke of York. The news of the French successes was at once followed by an outbreak of
national wrath. Political ballads denounced Suffolk as the ape with his clog that had tied
Talbot, the good "dog" who was longing to grip the Frenchmen. When the Bishop of Chichester,
who had been sent to pay the sailors at Portsmouth, strove to put off the men with less than
their due, they fell on him and slew him. Suffolk was impeached, and only saved from condemnation
by submitting himself to the king's mercy. He was sent into exile, but as he crossed the sea
he was intercepted by a ship of Kentishmen, beheaded, and his body thrown on the sands at Dover.

[Sidenote: Revolt of Kent]

Kent was the centre of the national resentment. It was the great manufacturing district of
the day, seething with a busy population, and especially concerned with the French contest
through the piracy of the Cinque Ports. Every house along its coast showed some spoil from
the wars. Here more than anywhere the loss of the great province whose cliffs could be seen
from its shores was felt as a crowning disgrace, and as we shall see from the after complaints
of its insurgents, political wrongs added their fire to the national shame. Justice was ill
administered; taxation was unequal and extortionate. Redress for such evils would now naturally
have been sought from Parliament; but the weakness of the Crown gave the great nobles power
to rob the freeholders of their franchise and return the knights of the shire. Nor could redress
be looked for from the Court. The murder of Suffolk was the act of Kentishmen, and Suffolk's
friends still held control over the royal councils. The parishes sent their due contingent
of armed men; we know that in many hundreds the constables formally summoned their legal force
to war. The insurgents were joined by more than a hundred esquires and gentlemen; and two great
landholders of Sussex, the Abbot of Battle and the Prior of Lewes, openly favoured their cause.
John Cade, a soldier of some experience in the French wars, took at this crisis the significant
name of Mortimer and placed himself at their head. The army, now twenty thousand men strong,
marched in the beginning of June on Blackheath. On the advance of the king with an equal force
however they determined to lay their complaint before the royal Council and withdraw to their
homes. The "Complaint of the Commons of Kent" is of high value in the light which it throws
on the condition of the people. Not one of the demands touches on religious reform. The question
of villeinage and serfage finds no place in it. In the seventy years which had intervened since
the last peasant rising, villeinage had died naturally away before the progress of social change.
The Statutes of Apparel, which from this time encumber the Statute-book, show in their anxiety
to curtail the dress of the labourer and the farmer the progress of these classes in comfort
and wealth; and from the language of the statutes themselves it is plain that as wages rose
both farmer and labourer went on clothing themselves better in spite of sumptuary provisions.
With the exception of a demand for the repeal of the Statute of Labourers, the programme of
the Commons was not social but political. The "Complaint" calls for administrative and economical
reforms; it denounces the exclusion of the Duke of York and other nobles from the royal councils;
it calls for a change of ministry, a more careful expenditure of the royal revenue, and for
the restoration of freedom of election which had been broken in upon by the interference both
of the Crown and the great landowners.

[Sidenote: Suppression of the revolt]

The Council refused to receive the "Complaint," and a body of troops under Sir Humphrey Stafford
fell on the Kentishmen as they reached Sevenoaks. This attack however was roughly beaten off,
and Cade's host turned back to encounter the royal army. But the royal army itself was already
calling for justice on the traitors who misled the king; and at the approach of the Kentishmen
it broke up in disorder. Its dispersion was followed by Henry's flight to Kenilworth and the
entry of the Kentishmen into London, where the execution of Lord Say, the most unpopular of
the royal ministers, broke the obstinacy of his colleagues. For three days the peasants entered
the city freely, retiring at nightfall to their camp across the river: but on the fifth of
July the men of London, goaded by the outrages of the rabble whom their presence roused to
plunder, closed the bridge against them, and beat back an attack with great slaughter. The
Kentishmen still however lay unbroken in Southwark, while Bishop Waynflete conferred with Cade
on behalf of the Council. Their "Complaint" was received, pardons were granted to all who had
joined in the rising, and the insurgents dispersed quietly to their homes. Cade had striven
in vain to retain them in arms; on their dispersion he formed a new force by throwing open
the gaols, and carried off the booty he had won to Rochester. Here however his men quarrelled
over the plunder; his force broke up, and Cade himself was slain by Iden, the Sheriff of Kent,
as he fled into Sussex.

[Sidenote: York and the Beauforts]

Kent remained restless through the year, and a rising in Wiltshire showed the growing and widespread
trouble of the time. The "Complaint" indeed had only been received to be laid aside. No attempt
was made to redress the grievances which it stated or to reform the government. On the contrary
the main object of popular hate, the Duke of Somerset, was at once recalled from Normandy to
take his place at the head of the royal Council. York on the other hand, whose recall had been
pressed in the "Complaint," was looked upon as an open foe. "Strange language," indeed, had
long before the Kentish rising been uttered about the Duke. Men had threatened that he "should
be fetched with many thousands," and the expectation of his coming to reform the government
became so general that orders were given to close the western ports against his landing. If
we believe the Duke himself, he was forced to move at last by efforts to indict him as a traitor
in Ireland itself. Crossing at Michaelmas to Wales in spite of the efforts to arrest him, he
gathered four thousand men on his estates and marched upon London. No serious effort was made
to prevent his approach to the king; and Henry found himself helpless to resist his demand
of a Parliament and of the admission of new councillors to the royal council-board. Parliament
met in November, and a bitter strife between York and Somerset ended in the arrest of the latter.
A demand which at once followed shows the importance of his fall. Henry the Sixth still remained
childless; and Young, a member for Bristol, proposed in the Commons that the Duke of York should
be declared heir to the throne. But the blow was averted by repeated prorogations, and Henry's
sympathies were shown by the committal of Young to the Tower, by the release of Somerset, and
by his promotion to the captaincy of Calais, the most important military post under the Crown.
The Commons indeed still remained resolute. When they again met in the summer of 1451 they
called for the removal of Somerset and his creatures from the king's presence. But Henry evaded
the demand, and the dissolution of the Houses announced the royal resolve to govern in defiance
of the national will.

[Sidenote: Failure of York]

The contest between the Houses and the Crown had cost England her last possessions across the
Channel. As York marched upon London Charles closed on the fragment of the duchy of Guienne
which still remained to the descendants of Eleanor. In a few months all was won. Bourg and
Blaye surrendered in the spring of 1451, Bordeaux in the summer; two months later the loss
of Bayonne ended the war in the south. Of all the English possessions in France only Calais
remained; and in 1452 Calais was threatened with attack. The news of this crowning danger again
called York to the front. On the declaration of Henry's will to resist all change in the government
the Duke had retired to his castle of Ludlow, arresting the whispers of his enemies with a
solemn protest that he was true liegeman to the king. But after events show that he was planning
a more decisive course of action than that which had broken down with the dissolution of the
Parliament, and the news of the approaching siege gave ground for taking such a course at once.
Somerset had been appointed Captain of Calais, and as his incapacity had lost England Normandy,
it would cost her--so England believed--her last fortress in France. It was said indeed that
the Duke was negotiating with Burgundy for its surrender. In the spring of 1452 therefore York
again marched on London, but this time with a large body of ordnance and an army which the
arrival of reinforcements under Lord Cobham and the Earl of Devonshire raised to over twenty
thousand men. Eluding the host which gathered round the king and Somerset he passed by the
capital, whose gates had been closed by Henry's orders, and entering Kent took post at Dartford.
His army was soon fronted by the superior force of the king, but the interposition of the more
moderate lords of the Council averted open conflict. Henry promised that Somerset should be
put on his trial on the charges advanced by the Duke, and York on this pledge disbanded his
men. But the pledge was at once broken. Somerset remained in power. York found himself practically
a prisoner, and only won his release by an oath to refrain from further "routs" or assemblies.

[Sidenote: Loss of Guienne]

Two such decisive failures seemed for the time to have utterly broken Richard's power. Weakened
as the crown had been by losses abroad, it was clearly strong enough as yet to hold its own
against the chief of the baronage. A general amnesty indeed sheltered York's adherents and
enabled the Duke himself to retire safely to Ludlow, but for more than a year his rival Somerset
wielded without opposition the power Richard had striven to wrest from him. A favourable turn
in the progress of the war gave fresh vigour to the Government. The French forces were abruptly
called from their march against Calais to the recovery of the south. The towns of Guienne had
opened their gates to Charles on his pledge to respect their franchises, but the need of the
French treasury was too great to respect the royal word, and heavy taxation turned the hopes
of Gascony to its old masters. On the landing of an English force under Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,
a general revolt restored to the English their possessions on the Garonne. Somerset used this
break of better fortune to obtain heavy subsidies from Parliament in 1453; but ere the twenty
thousand men whose levy was voted could cross the Channel a terrible blow had again ruined
the English cause. In a march to relieve Castillon on the Dordogne Shrewsbury suddenly found
himself face to face with the whole French army. His men were mown down by its guns, and the
Earl himself left dead on the field. His fall was the signal for a general submission. Town
after town again threw open its gates to Charles, and Bordeaux capitulated in October.

[Sidenote: Madness of the King]

The final loss of Gascony fell upon England at a moment when two events at home changed the
whole face of affairs. After eight years of childlessness the king became in October the father
of a son. With the birth of this boy the rivalry of York and the Beauforts for the right of
succession ceased to be the mainspring of English politics; and the crown seemed again to rise
out of the turmoil of warring factions. But with the birth of the son came the madness of the
father. Henry the Sixth sank into a state of idiotcy which made his rule impossible, and his
ministers were forced to call a great Council of peers to devise means for the government of
the realm. York took his seat at this council, and the mood of the nobles was seen in the charges
of misgovernment which were at once made against Somerset, and in his committal to the Tower.
But Somerset was no longer at the head of the royal party. With the birth of her son the queen,
Margaret of Anjou, came to the front. Her restless despotic temper was quickened to action
by the dangers which she saw threatening her boy's heritage of the crown; and the demand to
be invested with the full royal power which she made after a vain effort to rouse her husband
from his lethargy aimed directly at the exclusion of the Duke of York. The demand however was
roughly set aside; the Lords gave permission to York to summon a Parliament as the king's lieutenant;
and on the assembly of the Houses in the spring of 1454, as the mental alienation of the king
continued, the Lords chose Richard Protector of the Realm. With Somerset in prison little opposition
could be made to the Protectorate, and that little was soon put down. But the nation had hardly
time to feel the guidance of Richard's steady hand when it was removed. At the opening of 1455
the king recovered his senses, and York's Protectorate came at once to an end.

[Sidenote: York's revolt]

Henry had no sooner grasped power again than he fell back on his old policy. The queen became
his chief adviser. The Duke of Somerset was released from the Tower and owned by Henry in formal
court as his true and faithful liegeman. York on the other hand was deprived of the government
of Calais, and summoned with his friends to a council at Leicester, whose object was to provide
for the surety of the king's person. Prominent among these friends were two Earls of the house
of Neville. We have seen how great a part the Nevilles played after the accession of the house
of Lancaster; it was mainly to their efforts that Henry the Fourth owed the overthrow of the
Percies, their rivals in the mastery of the north; and from that moment their wealth and power
had been steadily growing. Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, was one of the mightiest barons
of the realm; but his power was all but equalled by that of his son, a second Richard, who
had won the Earldom of Warwick by his marriage with the heiress of the Beauchamps. The marriage
of York to Salisbury's sister, Cecily Neville, had bound both the earls to his cause, and under
his Protectorate Salisbury had been created Chancellor. But he was stripped of this office
on the Duke's fall; and their summons to the council of Leicester was held by the Nevilles
to threaten ruin to themselves as to York. The three nobles at once took arms to secure, as
they alleged, safe access to the king's person. Henry at the news of their approach mustered
two thousand men, and with Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland, and other nobles in his train,
advanced to St. Albans.

[Sidenote: The civil war]

On the 23rd of May York and the two Earls encamped without the town, and called on Henry "to
deliver such as we will accuse, and they to have like as they have deserved and done." The
king's reply was as bold as the demand. "Rather than they shall have any lord here with me
at this time," he replied, "I shall this day for their sake and in this quarrel myself live
and die." A summons to disperse as traitors left York and his fellow-nobles no hope but in
an attack. At eventide three assaults were made on the town. Warwick was the first to break
in, and the sound of his trumpets in the streets turned the fight into a rout. Death had answered
the prayer which Henry rejected, for the Duke of Somerset with Lord Clifford and the Earl of
Northumberland was among the fallen. The king himself fell into the victors' hands. The three
lords kneeling before him prayed him to take them for his true liegemen, and then rode by his
side in triumph into London, where a parliament was at once summoned which confirmed the acts
of the Duke; and on a return of the king's malady again nominated York as Protector. But in
the spring of 1456 Henry's recovery again ended the Duke's rule; and for two years the warring
parties sullenly watched one another. A temporary reconciliation between them was brought about
by the misery of the realm, but an attempt of the queen to arrest the Nevilles in 1458 caused
a fresh outbreak of war. Salisbury defeated Lord Audley in a fight at Bloreheath in Staffordshire,
and York with the two Earls raised his standard at Ludlow. But the crown was still stronger
than any force of the baronage. The king marched rapidly on the insurgents, and a decisive
battle was only averted by the desertion of a part of the Yorkist army and the disbanding of
the rest. The Duke himself fled to Ireland, the Earls to Calais, while the queen, summoning
a Parliament at Coventry in November, pressed on their attainder. But the check, whatever its
cause, had been merely a temporary one. York and Warwick planned a fresh attempt from their
secure retreats in Ireland and Calais; and in the midsummer of 1460 the Earls of Salisbury
and Warwick, with Richard's son Edward, the young Earl of March, again landed in Kent. Backed
by a general rising of the county they entered London amidst the acclamations of its citizens.
The royal army was defeated in a hard-fought action at Northampton in July. Margaret fled to
Scotland, and Henry was left a prisoner in the hands of the Duke of York.

[Sidenote: Richard claims the crown]

The position of York as heir-presumptive to the crown by his descent from Edmund of Langley
had ceased with the birth of a son to Henry the Sixth: but the victory of Northampton no sooner
raised him to the supreme control of affairs than he ventured to assert the far more dangerous
claims which he had secretly cherished as the representative of Lionel of Clarence, and to
their consciousness of which was owing the hostility of Henry and his queen. Such a claim was
in direct opposition to that power of the two Houses whose growth had been the work of the
past hundred years. There was no constitutional ground for any limitation of the right of Parliament
to set aside an elder branch in favour of a younger, and in the Parliamentary Act which placed
the House of Lancaster on the throne the claim of the House of Mortimer had been deliberately
set aside. Possession, too, told against the Yorkist pretensions. To modern minds the best
reply to Richard's claim lay in the words used at a later time by Henry himself. How then can
my right be disputed?" Long and undisturbed possession as well as a distinctly legal title
by free vote of Parliament was in favour of the House of Lancaster. But the persecution of
the Lollards, the interference with elections, the odium of the war, the shame of the long
misgovernment, told fatally against the weak and imbecile king whose reign had been a long
battle of contending factions. That the misrule had been serious was shown by the attitude
of the commercial class. It was the rising of Kent, the great manufacturing district of the
realm, which brought about the victory of Northampton. Throughout the struggle which followed
London and the great merchant towns were steady for the House of York. Zeal for the Lancastrian
cause was found only in Wales, in northern England, and in the south-western shires. It is
absurd to suppose that the shrewd traders of Cheapside were moved by an abstract question of
hereditary right, or that the wild Welshmen believed themselves to be supporting the right
of Parliament to regulate the succession. But it marks the power which Parliament had gained
that, directly as his claims ran in the teeth of a succession established by it, the Duke of
York felt himself compelled to convene the two Houses in October and to lay his claim before
the Lords as a petition of right. Neither oaths nor the numerous Acts which had settled and
confirmed the right to the crown in the House of Lancaster could destroy, he pleaded, his hereditary
claim. The bulk of the Lords refrained from attendance, and those who were present received
the petition with hardly concealed reluctance. They solved the question, as they hoped, by
a compromise. They refused to dethrone the king, but they had sworn no fealty to his child,
and at Henry's death they agreed to receive the Duke as successor to the crown.

[Sidenote: Wars of the Roses]

But the open display of York's pretensions at once united the partizans of the royal House
in a vigorous resistance; and the deadly struggle which received the name of the Wars of the
Roses from the white rose which formed the badge of the House of York and the red rose which
was the cognizance of the House of Lancaster began in a gathering of the North round Lord Clifford
and of the West round Henry, Duke of Somerset, the son of the Duke who had fallen at St. Albans.
York, who hurried in December to meet the first with a far inferior force, was defeated and
slain at Wakefield. The passion of civil war broke fiercely out on the field. The Earl of Salisbury
who had been taken prisoner was hurried to the block. The head of Duke Richard, crowned in
mockery with a diadem of paper, is said to have been impaled on the walls of York. His second
son, Lord Rutland, fell crying for mercy on his knees before Clifford. But Clifford's father
had been the first to fall in the battle of St. Albans which opened the struggle. "As your
father killed mine," cried the savage baron, while he plunged his dagger in the young noble's
breast, "I will kill you!" The brutal deed was soon to be avenged. Richard's eldest son, Edward,
the Earl of March, was busy gathering a force on the Welsh border in support of his father
at the moment when the Duke was defeated and slain. Young as he was Edward showed in this hour
of apparent ruin the quickness and vigour of his temper, and routing on his march a body of
Lancastrians at Mortimer's Cross struck boldly upon London. It was on London that the Lancastrian
army had moved after its victory at Wakefield. A desperate struggle took place at St. Albans
where a force of Kentish men with the Earl of Warwick strove to bar its march on the capital,
but Warwick's force broke under cover of night and an immediate advance of the conquerors might
have decided the contest. Margaret however paused to sully her victory by a series of bloody
executions, and the rough northerners who formed the bulk of her army scattered to pillage
while Edward, hurrying from the west, appeared before the capital. The citizens rallied at
his call, and cries of "Long live King Edward!" rang round the handsome young leader as he
rode through the streets. A council of Yorkist lords, hastily summoned, resolved that the compromise
agreed on in Parliament was at an end and that Henry of Lancaster had forfeited the throne.
The final issue however now lay not with Parliament, but with the sword. Disappointed of London,
the Lancastrian army fell rapidly back on the North, and Edward hurried as rapidly in pursuit.
On the 29th of March, 1461, the two armies encountered one another at Towton Field, near Tadcaster.
In the numbers engaged, as well as in the terrible obstinacy of the struggle, no such battle
had been seen in England since the fight of Senlac. The two armies together numbered nearly
120,000 men. The day had just broken when the Yorkists advanced through a thick snowfall, and
for six hours the battle raged with desperate bravery on either side. At one critical moment
Warwick saw his men falter, and stabbing his horse before them, swore on the cross of his sword
to win or die on the field. The battle was turned at last by the arrival of the Duke of Norfolk
with a fresh force from the Eastern Counties, and at noon the Lancastrians gave way. A river
in their rear turned the retreat into a rout, and the flight and carnage, for no quarter was
given on either side, went on through the night and the morrow. Edward's herald counted more
than 20,000 Lancastrian corpses on the field. The losses of the conquerors were hardly less
heavy than those of the conquered. But their triumph was complete. The Earl of Northumberland
was slain; the Earls of Devonshire and Wiltshire were taken and beheaded; the Duke of Somerset
fled into exile. Henry himself with his queen was forced to fly over the border and to find
a refuge in Scotland. The cause of the House of Lancaster was lost; and with the victory of
Towton the crown of England passed to Edward of York.

AUTHORITIES FOR BOOK V 1461-1540

Edward the Fifth is the subject of a work attributed to Sir Thomas More, and which almost certainly
derives much of its information from Archbishop Morton. Whatever its historical worth may be,
it is remarkable in its English form as the first historical work of any literary value which
we possess written in our modern prose. The "Letters and Papers of Richard the Third and Henry
the Seventh," some "Memorials of Henry the Seventh," including his life by Bernard André of
Toulouse, and a volume of "Materials" for a history of his reign have been edited for the Rolls
Series. A biography of Henry is among the works of Lord Bacon. The history of Erasmus in England
must be followed in his own interesting letters; the most accessible edition of the typical
book of the revival, the "Utopia," is the Elizabethan translation, published by Mr. Arber.
Mr. Lupton has done much to increase our scanty knowledge of Colet by his recent editions of
several of his works. Halle's Chronicle extends from the reign of Edward the Fourth to that
of Henry the Eighth; for the latter he is copied by Grafton and followed by Holinshed. Cavendish
has given a faithful and touching account of Wolsey in his later days, but for any real knowledge
of his administration or the foreign policy of Henry the Eighth we must turn from these to
the invaluable Calendars of State Papers for this period from the English, Spanish, and Austrian
archives, with the prefaces of Professor Brewer and Mr. Bergenroth. Cromwell's early life as
told by Foxe is a mass of fable, and the State Papers afford the only real information as to
his ministry. For Sir Thomas More we have a touching life by his son-in-law, Roper. The more
important documents for the religious history of the time will be found in Mr. Pocock's edition
of Burnet's "History of the Reformation"; those relating to the dissolution of the monasteries
in the collection of letters on that subject published by the Camden Society, and in the "Original
Letters" of Sir Henry Ellis. A mass of materials of very various value has been accumulated
by Strype in his collections, which commence at this period.

CHAPTER I THE HOUSE OF YORK 1461-1485

[Sidenote: English freedom]

With the victory of Towton the war of the succession came practically to an end. Though Margaret
still struggled on the northern border and the treachery of Warwick for a while drove the new
king from his realm, this gleam of returning fortune only brought a more fatal ruin on the
House of Lancaster and seated the House of York more firmly on the throne. But the Wars of
the Roses did far more than ruin one royal house or set up another. They found England, in
the words of Commines, "among all the world's lordships of which I have knowledge, that where
the public weal is best ordered, and where least violence reigns over the people." An English
king--the shrewd observer noticed--"can undertake no enterprise of account without assembling
his Parliament, which is a thing most wise and holy, and therefore are these kings stronger
and better served" than the despotic sovereigns of the Continent. The English kingship, as
a judge, Sir John Fortescue, could boast when writing at this time, was not an absolute but
a limited monarchy; the land was not a land where the will of the prince was itself the law,
but where the prince could neither make laws nor impose taxes save by his subjects' consent.
At no time had Parliament played so constant and prominent a part in the government of the
realm. At no time had the principles of constitutional liberty seemed so thoroughly understood
and so dear to the people at large. The long Parliamentary contest between the Crown and the
two Houses since the days of Edward the First had firmly established the great securities of
national liberty--the right of freedom from arbitrary taxation, from arbitrary legislation,
from arbitrary imprisonment, and the responsibility of even the highest servants of the Crown
to Parliament and to the law.

[Sidenote: Results of the Wars of the Roses]

But with the close of the struggle for the succession this liberty wholly disappeared. If the
Wars of the Roses failed in utterly destroying English freedom, they succeeded in arresting
its progress for more than a hundred years. With them we enter on an epoch of constitutional
retrogression in which the slow work of the age that went before it was rapidly undone. From
the accession of Edward the Fourth Parliamentary life was almost suspended, or was turned into
a mere form by the overpowering influence of the Crown. The legislative powers of the two Houses
were usurped by the royal Council. Arbitrary taxation reappeared in benevolences and forced
loans. Personal liberty was almost extinguished by a formidable spy-system and by the constant
practice of arbitrary imprisonment. Justice was degraded by the prodigal use of bills of attainder,
by a wide extension of the judicial power of the royal Council, by the servility of judges,
by the coercion of juries. So vast and sweeping was the change that to careless observers of
a later day the constitutional monarchy of the Edwards and the Henries seemed suddenly to have
transformed itself under the Tudors into a despotism as complete as the despotism of the Turk.
Such a view is no doubt exaggerated and unjust. Bend and strain the law as he might, there
never was a time when the most wilful of English rulers failed to own the restraints of law;
and the obedience of the most servile among English subjects lay within bounds, at once political
and religious, which no theory of king-worship could bring them to overpass. But even if we
make these reserves, the character of the monarchy from the days of Edward the Fourth to the
days of Elizabeth remains something strange and isolated in our history. It is hard to connect
the kingship of the old English, the Norman, the Angevin, or the Plantagenet kings with the
kingship of the House of York or of the House of Tudor.

[Sidenote: New strength of the Crown]

The primary cause of this great change lay in the recovery of its older strength by the Crown.
Through the last hundred and fifty years the monarchy had been hampered by the pressure of
the war. Through the last fifty it had been weakened by the insecurity of a disputed succession.
It was to obtain supplies for the strife with Scotland and the strife with France that the
earlier Plantagenets had been forced to yield to the ever-growing claims which were advanced
by the Parliament. It was to win the consent of Parliament to its occupation of the throne
and its support against every rival that the House of Lancaster bent yet more humbly to its
demands. But with the loss of Guienne the war with France came virtually to an end. The war
with Scotland died down into a series of border forays. The Wars of the Roses settled the question
of the succession, first by the seeming extinction of the House of Lancaster, and then by the
utter ruin of the House of York. The royal treasury was not only relieved from the drain which
had left the crown at the mercy of the Third Estate; it was filled as it had never been filled
before by the forfeitures and confiscations of the civil war. In the one bill of attainder
which followed Towton twelve great nobles and more than a hundred knights and squires were
stripped of their estates to the king's profit. Nearly a fifth of the land is said to have
passed into the royal possession at one period or other of the civil strife. Edward the Fourth
and Henry the Seventh not only possessed a power untrammelled by the difficulties which had
beset the Crown since the days of Edward the First, but they were masters of a wealth such
as the Crown had never known since the days of Henry the Second.

[Sidenote: Its New Policy]

Throughout their reigns these kings showed a firm resolve to shun the two rocks on which the
monarchy had been so nearly wrecked. No policy was too inglorious that enabled them to avoid
the need of war. The inheritance of a warlike policy, the consciousness of great military abilities,
the cry of his own people for a renewal of the struggle, failed to lure Edward from his system
of peace. Henry clung to peace in spite of the threatening growth of the French monarchy: he
refused to be drawn into any serious war even by its acquisition of Britanny and of a coast-line
that ran unbroken along the Channel. Nor was any expedient too degrading if it swelled the
royal hoard. Edward by a single stroke, the grant of the customs to the king for life, secured
a source of revenue which went far to relieve the Crown from its dependence on Parliament.
He stooped to add to the gold which his confiscations amassed by trading on a vast scale; his
ships, freighted with tin, wool, and cloth, made the name of the merchant-king famous in the
ports of Italy and Greece. Henry was as adroit and as shameless a financier as his predecessor.
He was his own treasurer, he kept his own accounts, he ticked off with his own hand the compositions
he levied on the western shires for their abortive revolts.

[Sidenote: Suspension of Parliamentary life]

With peace and a full treasury the need for calling Parliament together was removed. The collapse
of the Houses was in itself a revolution. Up to this moment they had played a more and more
prominent part in the government of the realm. The progress made under the earlier Plantagenets
had gone as steadily on under Henry the Fourth and his successors. The Commons had continued
their advance. Not only had the right of self-taxation and of the initiation of laws been explicitly
yielded to them, but they had interfered with the administration of the state, had directed
the application of subsidies, and called royal ministers to account by repeated instances of
impeachment. Under the first two kings of the House of Lancaster Parliament had been summoned
almost every year. Under Henry the Sixth an important step was made in constitutional progress
by abandoning the old custom of presenting the requests of Parliament in the form of petitions
which were subsequently moulded into statutes by the royal Council. The statute itself in its
final shape was now presented for the royal assent and the Crown deprived of all opportunity
of modifying it. But with the reign of Edward the Fourth not only this progress but the very
action of Parliament comes almost to an end. For the first time since the days of John not
a single law which promoted freedom or remedied the abuses of power was even proposed. The
Houses indeed were only rarely called together by Edward; they were only twice summoned during
the last thirteen years of Henry the Seventh.

[Sidenote: Parliament and the Civil War]

But this discontinuance of Parliamentary life was not due merely to the new financial system
of the Crown. The policy of the kings was aided by the internal weakness of Parliament itself.
No institution suffered more from the civil war. During its progress the Houses had become
mere gatherings of nobles with their retainers and partizans. They were like armed camps to
which the great lords came with small armies at their backs. When arms were prohibited the
retainers of the warring barons appeared, as in the Club Parliament of 1426, with clubs on
their shoulders. When clubs were forbidden they hid stones and balls of lead in their clothes.
Amidst scenes such as these the faith in and reverence for Parliaments could hardly fail to
die away. But the very success of the House of York was a more fatal blow to the trust in them.
It was by the act of the Houses that the Lancastrian line had been raised to the throne. Its
title was a Parliamentary title. Its existence was in fact a contention that the will of Parliament
could override the claims of blood in the succession to the throne. With all this the civil
war dealt roughly and decisively. The Parliamentary line was driven from the throne. The Parliamentary
title was set aside as usurpation. The House of York based its claim to the throne on the incapacity
of Parliament to set aside pretensions which were based on sheer nearness of blood. The fall
of the House of Lancaster, the accession of the Yorkist kings, must have seemed to the men
who had witnessed the struggle a crushing defeat of the Parliament.

[Sidenote: Ruin of Feudal Organization]

Weakened by failure, discredited by faction, no longer needful as a source of supplies, it
was easy for the Monarchy to rid itself of the check of the two Houses, and their riddance
at once restored the Crown to the power it had held under the earlier kings. But in actual
fact Edward the Fourth found himself the possessor of a far greater authority than this. The
structure of feudal society fronted a feudal king with two great rival powers in the Baronage
and the Church. Even in England, though feudalism had far less hold than elsewhere, the noble
and the priest formed effective checks on the monarchy. But at the close of the Wars of the
Roses these older checks no longer served as restraints upon the action of the Crown. With
the growth of Parliament the weight of the Baronage as a separate constitutional element in
the realm, even the separate influence of the Church, had fallen more and more into decay.
For their irregular and individual action was gradually substituted the legal and continuous
action of the three Estates; and now that the assembly of the estates practically ceased it
was too late to revive the older checks which in earlier days had fettered the action of the
Crown. Nor was the growth of Parliament the only cause for the weakness of these feudal restraints.
The older social order which had prevailed throughout Western Europe since the fall of the
Roman Empire was now passing away. The speculation of the twelfth century, the scholastic criticism
of the thirteenth, the Lollardry and socialism of the fourteenth century, had at last done
their work. The spell of the past, the spell of custom and tradition, which had enchained the
minds of men was roughly broken. The supremacy of the warrior in a world of war, the severance
of privileged from unprivileged classes, no longer seemed the one natural structure of society.
The belief in its possession of supernatural truths and supernatural powers no longer held
man in unquestioning awe of the priesthood. The strength of the Church was sapped alike by
theological and moral revolt, while the growth of new classes, the new greed of peace and of
the wealth that comes of peace, the advance of industry, the division of property, the progress
of centralized government, dealt fatal blows at the feudal organization of the state.

[Sidenote: Weakness of the Baronage]

Nor was the danger merely an external one. Noble and priest alike were beginning to disbelieve
in themselves. The new knowledge which was now dawning on the world, the direct contact with
the Greek and Roman literatures which was just beginning to exert its influence on Western
Europe, told above all on these wealthier and more refined classes. The young scholar or noble
who crossed the Alps brought from the schools of Florence the dim impression of a republican
liberty or an imperial order which disenchanted him of the world in which he found himself.
He looked on the feudalism about him as a brutal anarchy, he looked on the Church itself as
the supplanter of a nobler and more philosophic morality. Besides this moral change, the barons
had suffered politically from the decrease of their numbers in the House of Lords. The statement
which attributes the lessening of the baronage to the Wars of the Roses seems indeed to be
an error. Although Henry the Seventh, in dread of opposition to his throne, summoned only a
portion of the temporal peers to his first Parliament, there were as many barons at his accession
as at the accession of Henry the Sixth. Of the greater houses only those of Beaufort and Tiptoft
were extinguished by the civil war. The decline of the baronage, the extinction of the greater
families, the break-up of the great estates, had in fact been going on throughout the reign
of the Edwards; and it was after Agincourt that the number of temporal peers sank to its lowest
ebb. From that time till the time of the Tudors they numbered but fifty-two. A reduction in
the numbers of the baronage however might have been more than compensated by the concentration
of great estates in the hands of the houses that survived. What wrecked it as a military force
was the revolution which was taking place in the art of war. The introduction of gunpowder
ruined feudalism. The mounted and heavily-armed knight gave way to the meaner footman. Fortresses
which had been impregnable against the attacks of the Middle Ages crumbled before the new artillery.
Although gunpowder had been in use as early as Crécy, it was not till the accession of the
House of Lancaster that it was really brought into effective employment as a military resource.
But the revolution in warfare was immediate. The wars of Henry the Fifth were wars of sieges.
The "Last of the Barons," as Warwick has picturesquely been styled, relied mainly on his train
of artillery. It was artillery that turned the day at Barnet and Tewkesbury, and that gave
Henry the Seventh his victory over the formidable dangers which assailed him. The strength
which the change gave to the Crown was in fact almost irresistible. Throughout the Middle Ages
the call of a great baron had been enough to raise a formidable revolt. Yeomen and retainers
took down the bow from their chimney corner, knights buckled on their armour, and in a few
days a host threatened the throne. Without artillery however such a force was now helpless,
and the one train of artillery in the kingdom lay at the disposal of the king.

[Sidenote: Weakness of the Church]

The Church too was in no less peril than the baronage. In England as elsewhere the great ecclesiastical
body still seemed imposing from the memories of its past, its immense wealth, its tradition
of statesmanship, its long association with the intellectual and religious aspirations of men,
its hold on social life. But its real power was small. Its moral inertness, its lack of spiritual
enthusiasm, gave it less and less hold on the religious minds of the day. Its energies indeed
seemed absorbed in a mere clinging to existence. For in spite of steady repression Lollardry
still lived on, no longer indeed as an organized movement, but in scattered and secret groups
whose sole bond was a common loyalty to the Bible and a common spirit of revolt against the
religion of their day. Nine years after the accession of Henry the Sixth the Duke of Gloucester
was traversing England with men-at-arms to repress the risings of the Lollards and hinder the
circulation of their invectives against the clergy. In 1449 "Bible men" were still formidable
enough to call a prelate to the front as a controversialist: and the very title of Bishop Pecock's
work, "A Repressor of overmuch blaming of the clergy," shows the damage done by their virulent
criticism. Its most fatal effect was to rob the priesthood of moral power. Taunted with a love
of wealth, with a lower standard of life than that of the ploughman and weaver who gathered
to read the Bible by night, dreading in themselves any burst of emotion or enthusiasm as a
possible prelude to heresy, the clergy ceased to be the moral leaders of the nation. They plunged
as deeply as the men about them into the darkest superstition, and above all into the belief
in sorcery and magic which formed so remarkable a feature of the time. It was for conspiracy
with a priest to waste the king's life by sorcery that Eleanor Cobham did penance through the
streets of London. The mist which wrapped the battle-field of Barnet was attributed to the
incantations of Friar Bungay. The one pure figure which rises out of the greed, the selfishness,
the scepticism of the time, the figure of Joan of Arc, was looked on by the doctors and priests
who judged her as that of a sorceress.

The prevalence of such beliefs tells its own tale of the intellectual state of the clergy.
They were ceasing in fact to be an intellectual class at all. The monasteries were no longer
seats of learning. "I find in them," says Poggio, an Italian scholar who visited England some
twenty years after Chaucer's death, "men given up to sensuality in abundance but very few lovers
of learning and those of a barbarous sort, skilled more in quibbles and sophisms than in literature."
The statement is no doubt coloured by the contempt of the new scholars for the scholastic philosophy
which had taken the place of letters in England as elsewhere, but even scholasticism was now
at its lowest ebb. The erection of colleges, which began in the thirteenth century but made
little progress till the time we have reached, failed to arrest the quick decline of the universities
both in the numbers and learning of their students. Those at Oxford amounted to only a fifth
of the scholars who had attended its lectures a century before, and Oxford Latin became proverbial
for a jargon in which the very tradition of grammar had been lost. Literature, which had till
now rested mainly in the hands of the clergy, came almost to an end. Of all its nobler forms
history alone lingered on; but it lingered in compilations or extracts from past writers, such
as make up the so-called works of Walsingham, in jejune monastic annals, or worthless popular
compendiums. The only real trace of mental activity was seen in the numerous treatises which
dealt with alchemy or magic, the elixir of life, or the philosopher's stone; a fungous growth
which even more clearly than the absence of healthier letters witnessed to the progress of
intellectual decay.

Somewhat of their old independence lingered indeed among the lower clergy and the monastic
orders; it was in fact the successful resistance of the last to an effort made to establish
arbitrary taxation which brought about their ruin. Up to the terrible statutes of Thomas Cromwell
the clergy in convocation still asserted boldly their older rights against the Crown. But it
was through its prelates that the Church exercised a directly political influence, and these
showed a different temper from the clergy. Their weakness told directly on the constitutional
progress of the realm, for through the diminution in the number of the peers temporal the greater
part of the House of Lords was now composed of spiritual peers, of bishops and the greater
abbots. Driven by sheer need, by the attack of the barons on their temporal possessions and
of the Lollard on their spiritual authority, into dependence on the Crown, their weight was
thrown into the scale of the monarchy.

[Sidenote: Change in the Lower House]

And while the ruin of the baronage, and the weakness of the prelacy, broke the power of the
House of Lords, the restriction of the suffrage broke the growing strength of the House of
Commons. Even before the outbreak of the civil war the striving of the proprietary classes,
landowners and merchants, after special privileges which the Crown alone could bestow, had
produced important constitutional results. The character of the House of Commons had been changed
by the restriction of both the borough and the county franchise. Up to this time all freemen
settling in a borough, and paying their dues to it became by the mere fact of settlement its
burgesses.

[Sidenote: Restriction of Borough Freedom]

But during the reign of Henry the Sixth and still more under Edward the Fourth this largeness
of borough life was roughly curtailed. The trade companies which vindicated civic freedom from
the tyranny of the older merchant gilds themselves tended to become a narrow and exclusive
oligarchy. Most of the boroughs had by this time acquired civic property, and it was with the
aim of securing their own enjoyment of this against any share of it by "strangers" that the
existing burgesses for the most part procured charters of incorporation from the Crown, which
turned them into a close body and excluded from their number all who were not burgesses by
birth or who failed henceforth to purchase their right of entrance by a long apprenticeship.
In addition to this narrowing of the burgess-body the internal government of the boroughs had
almost universally passed since the failure of the Communal movement in the thirteenth century
from the free gathering of the citizens in borough-mote into the hands of Common Councils,
either self-elected or elected by the wealthier burgesses; and to these councils, or to a yet
more restricted number of "select men" belonging to them, clauses in the new charters generally
confined the right of choosing their representatives in Parliament. It was with this restriction
that the long process of degradation began which ended in reducing the representation of our
boroughs to a mere mockery. Influences which would have had small weight over the town at large
proved irresistible by the small body of corporators or "select men." Great nobles, neighbouring
landowners, the Crown itself, seized on the boroughs as their prey, and dictated the choice
of their representatives. Corruption did whatever force failed to do: and from the Wars of
the Roses to the days of Pitt the voice of the people had to be looked for not in the members
for the towns but in the knights for the counties.

[Sidenote: Restriction of County Franchise]

The restriction of the county franchise on the other hand was the direct work of the Parliament
itself. Economic changes were fast widening the franchise in the shires. The number of freeholders
increased with the subdivision of estates and the social changes which we have already noticed.
But this increase of independence was marked by "riots and divisions between the gentlemen
and other people" which the statesmen of the day attributed to the excessive number of voters.
In many counties the power of the great lords undoubtedly enabled them to control elections
through the number of their retainers. In Cade's revolt the Kentishmen complained that "the
people of the shire are not allowed to have their free elections in the choosing of knights
for the shire, but letters have been sent from divers estates to the great nobles of the county,
the which enforceth their tenants and other people by force to choose other persons than the
common will is." It was primarily to check this abuse that a statute of the reign of Henry
the Sixth restricted in 1430 the right of voting in shires to freeholders holding land worth
forty shillings, a sum equal in our money to at least twenty pounds a year and representing
a far higher proportional income at the present time. Whatever its original purpose may have
been, the result of the statute was a wide disfranchisement. It was aimed, in its own words,
against voters "of no value, whereof every of them pretended to have a voice equivalent with
the more worthy knights and esquires dwelling in the same counties." But in actual working
the statute was interpreted in a more destructive fashion than its words were intended to convey.
Up to this time all suitors who attended at the Sheriff's Court had voted without question
for the Knight of the Shire, but by the new statute the great bulk of the existing voters,
every leaseholder and every copyholder, found themselves implicitly deprived of their franchise.

[Sidenote: The French War and the Baronage]

The kingship of Edward and his successors therefore was not a mere restoration of the kingship
of John or of Henry the Second. It was the kingship of those kings apart from the constitutional
forces which in their case stood side by side with kingship, controlling and regulating its
action, apart from the force of custom, from the strong arm of the baron, from the religious
sanctions which formed so effective a weapon in the hands of the priest, in a word, apart from
that social organization from which our political constitution had sprung; even the power of
Parliament itself died down at the very moment when the cessation of war, the opening of new
sources of revenue, the cry for protection against social anarchy, doubled the strength of
the Crown. The force of the monarchy however lay above all in its position as the one representative
of national order and in its policy of peace. For two hundred years England had been almost
constantly at war, and to war without had been added discord and misrule within. The violence
and anarchy which had always clung like a taint to the baronage grew more and more unbearable
as the nation moved forward to a more settled peacefulness and industry. At the very time however
when this movement became most pronounced under Edward the Third, the tendency of the nobles
to violence received a new impulse from the war with France. Long before the struggle was over
it had done its fatal work on the mood of the English noble. His aim had become little more
than a lust for gold, a longing after plunder, after the pillage of farms, the sack of cities,
the ransom of captives. So intense was the greed of gain that in the later years of the war
only a threat of death could keep the fighting-men in their ranks, and the results of victory
after victory were lost through the anxiety of the conquerors to deposit their booty and captives
safely at home. The moment the hand of such leaders as Henry the Fifth or Bedford was removed
the war died down into mere massacre and brigandage. "If God had been a captain now-a-days,"
exclaimed a French general, "he would have turned marauder."

[Sidenote: Grant of Liveries]

The temper thus nursed on the fields of France found at last scope for action in England itself.
Even before the outbreak of the War of the Roses the nobles had become as lawless and dissolute
at home as they were greedy and cruel abroad. But with the struggle of York and Lancaster and
the paralysis of government which it brought with it, all hold over the baronage was gone;
and the lawlessness and brutality of their temper showed itself without a check. The disorder
which their violence wrought in a single district of the country is brought home by the Paston
Letters, an invaluable series of domestic correspondence which lifts for us a corner of the
veil that hides the social state of England in the fifteenth century. We see houses sacked,
judges overawed or driven from the bench, peaceful men hewn down by assassins or plundered
by armed bands, women carried off to forced marriages, elections controlled by brute force,
parliaments degraded into camps of armed retainers. As the number of their actual vassals declined
with the progress of enfranchisement and the upgrowth of the freeholder, the nobles had found
a substitute for them in the grant of their "liveries," the badges of their households, to
the smaller gentry and farmers of their neighbourhood, and this artificial revival of the dying
feudalism became one of the curses of the day. The outlaw, the broken soldier returning penniless
from the wars, found shelter and wages in the train of the greater barons, and furnished them
with a force ready at any moment for violence or civil strife. The same motives which brought
the freeman of the tenth century to commend himself to thegn or baron forced the yeoman or
smaller gentleman of the fifteenth to don the cognizance of his powerful neighbour, and ask
for a grant of "livery," or to seek at his hand "maintenance" in the law-courts, and thus secure
his aid and patronage in fray or suit. For to meddle with such a retainer was perilous even
for sheriff or judge; and the force which a noble could summon at his call sufficed to overawe
a law-court or to drag a culprit from prison or dock. The evils of the system of "maintenance"
had been felt long before the Wars of the Roses; and statutes both of Edward the First and
of Richard the Second had been aimed against it. But it was in the civil war that it showed
itself in its full force. The weakness of the Crown and the strife of political factions for
supremacy left the nobles masters of the field; and the white rose of the House of York, the
red rose of the House of Lancaster, the portcullis of the Beauforts, the pied bull of the Nevilles,
the bear and ragged staff which Warwick borrowed from the Beauchamps, were seen on hundreds
of breasts in Parliament or on the battle-field.

[Sidenote: The Social Revolution]

The lawlessness of the baronage tended as it had always tended to the profit of the crown by
driving the people at large to seek for order and protection at the hands of the monarchy.
And at this moment the craving for such a protection was strengthened by the general growth
of wealth and industry. The smaller proprietors of the counties were growing fast both in wealth
and numbers, while the burgess class in the cities were drawing fresh riches from the developement
of trade which characterized this period. The noble himself owed his importance to his wealth.
Poggio, as he wandered through the island, noted that "the noble who has the greatest revenue
is most respected; and that even men of gentle blood attend to country business and sell their
wool and cattle, not thinking it any disparagement to engage in rural industry." Slowly but
surely the foreign commerce of the country, hitherto conducted by the Italian, the Hanse merchant,
or the trader of Catalonia or southern Gaul, was passing into English hands. English merchants
were settled at Florence and at Venice. English merchant ships appeared in the Baltic. The
first faint upgrowth of manufactures was seen in a crowd of protective statutes which formed
a marked feature in the legislation of Edward the Fourth. The weight which the industrial classes
had acquired was seen in the bounds which their opinion set to the Wars of the Roses. England
presented to Philippe de Commines the rare spectacle of a land where, brutal as was its civil
strife, "there are no buildings destroyed or demolished by war, and where the mischief of it
falls on those who make the war." The ruin and bloodshed were limited in fact to the great
lords and their feudal retainers. If the towns once or twice threw themselves, as at Towton,
into the struggle, the trading and agricultural classes for the most part stood wholly apart
from it. While the baronage was dashing itself to pieces in battle after battle justice went
on undisturbed. The law-courts sat at Westminster. The judges rode on circuit as of old. The
system of jury trial took more and more its modern form by the separation of the jurors from
the witnesses.

But beneath this outer order and prosperity the growth of wealth in the trading classes was
fast bringing about a social revolution which tended as strongly as the outrages of the baronage
to the profit of the crown. The rise in the price of wool was giving a fresh impulse to the
changes in agriculture which had begun with the Black Death and were to go steadily on for
a hundred years to come. These changes were the throwing together of the smaller holdings,
and the introduction of sheep-farming on an enormous scale. The new wealth of the merchant
classes helped on the change. They began to invest largely in land, and these "farming gentlemen
and clerking knights," as Latimer bitterly styled them, were restrained by few traditions or
associations in their eviction of the smaller tenants. The land indeed had been greatly underlet,
and as its value rose with the peace and firm government of the early Tudors the temptation
to raise the customary rents became irresistible. "That which went heretofore for twenty or
forty pounds a year," we learn in Henry the Eighth's day, "now is let for fifty or a hundred."
But it had been only by this low scale of rent that the small yeomanry class had been enabled
to exist.

[Sidenote: Evictions and Enclosures]

Increase of rent ended with such tenants in the relinquishment of their holdings, but the bitterness
of the ejections which the new system of cultivation necessitated was increased by the iniquitous
means that were often employed to bring them about. The farmers, if we believe More in 1515,
were "got rid of either by fraud or force, or tired out with repeated wrongs into parting with
their property." "In this way it comes to pass that these poor wretches, men, women, husbands,
orphans, widows, parents with little children, households greater in number than in wealth
(for arable farming requires many hands, while one shepherd and herdsman will suffice for a
pasture farm), all these emigrate from their native fields without knowing where to go." The
sale of their scanty household stuff drove them to wander homeless abroad, to be thrown into
prison as vagabonds, to beg and to steal. Yet in the face of such a spectacle as this we still
find the old complaint of scarcity of labour, and the old legal remedy for it in a fixed scale
of wages. The social disorder, in fact, baffled the sagacity of English statesmen, and they
could find no better remedy for it than laws against the further extension of sheep-farms,
and a formidable increase of public executions. Both were alike fruitless. Enclosures and evictions
went on as before and swelled the numbers and the turbulence of the floating labour class.
The riots against "enclosures," of which we first hear in the time of Henry the Sixth and which
became a constant feature of the Tudor period, are indications not only of a perpetual strife
going on in every quarter between the landowners and the smaller peasant class, but of a mass
of social discontent which was to seek constant outlets in violence and revolution.

And into this mass of disorder the break-up of the military households and the return of wounded
and disabled soldiers from the wars introduced a dangerous leaven of outrage and crime. England
for the first time saw a distinct criminal class in the organized gangs of robbers which began
to infest the roads and were always ready to gather round the standard of revolt. The gallows
did its work in vain. "If you do not remedy the evils which produce thieves," More urged with
bitter truth, "the rigorous execution of justice in punishing thieves will be vain." But even
More could only suggest a remedy which, efficacious as it was subsequently to prove, had yet
to wait a century for its realization. "Let the woollen manufacture be introduced, so that
honest employment may be found for those whom want has made thieves or will make thieves ere
long." The extension of industry at last succeeded in absorbing this mass of surplus labour,
but the process was not complete till the close of Elizabeth's day, and throughout the time
of the Tudors the discontent of the labour class bound the wealthier classes to the crown.
It was in truth this social danger which lay at the root of the Tudor despotism. For the proprietary
classes the repression of the poor was a question of life and death. Employer and proprietor
were ready to surrender freedom into the hands of the one power which could preserve them from
social anarchy. It was to the selfish panic of the landowners that England owed the Statute
of Labourers and its terrible heritage of pauperism. It was to the selfish panic of both landowner
and merchant that she owed the despotism of the Monarchy.

[Sidenote: The Nevilles]

Thus we find that in the years which followed the Wars of the Roses a change passed over the
spirit of English government which was little short of a revolution. As the country tasted
the sweets of rest and firm government that reaction of feeling, that horror of fresh civil
wars, that content with its own internal growth and indifference to foreign aggrandizement,
which distinguished the epoch of the Tudors, began to assert its power. The Crown became identified
with the thought of national prosperity, almost with the thought of national existence. Loyalty
drew to itself the force of patriotism. Devotion to the crown became one in men's minds with
devotion to their country. For almost a hundred years England lost all sense of a national
individuality; it saw itself only in the Crown. The tendency became irresistible as the nation
owned in the power of its kings its one security for social order, its one bulwark against
feudal outrage and popular anarchy. The change however was a slow and gradual one. It is with
the victory of Towton that the new power of the Monarchy begins, but in the years that immediately
followed this victory there was little to promise the triumph of the Crown. The king, Edward
the Fourth, was but a boy of nineteen; and decisive as his march upon London proved, he had
as yet given few signs of political ability. His luxurious temper showed itself in the pomp
and gaiety of his court, in feast and tourney, or in love-passages with city wives and noble
ladies. The work of government, the defence of the new throne against its restless foes, he
left as yet to sterner hands. Among the few great houses who recalled the might of the older
baronage two families of the northern border stood first in power and repute. The Percies had
played the chief part in the revolution which gave the crown to the House of Lancaster. Their
rivals, the Nevilles, had set the line of York on the throne. Fortune seemed to delight in
adding lands and wealth to the last powerful family. The heiress of the Montacutes brought
the Earldom of Salisbury and the barony of Monthermer to a second son of their chief, the Earl
of Westmoreland; and Salisbury's son, Richard Neville, won the Earldom of Warwick with the
hand of the heiress of the Beauchamps. The ruin of the Percies, whose lands and Earldom of
Northumberland were granted to Warwick's brother, Lord Montagu, raised the Nevilles to unrivalled
greatness in the land. Warwick, who on his father's death added the Earldom of Salisbury to
his earlier titles, had like his father warmly espoused the cause of Richard of York, and it
was to his counsels that men ascribed the decisive step by which his cousin Edward of March
assumed the crown. From St. Albans to Towton he had been the foremost among the assailants
of the Lancastrian line; and the death of his uncle and father, the youth of the king, and
the glory of the great victory which confirmed his throne, placed the Earl at the head of the
Yorkist party.

[Sidenote: Warwick]

Warwick's services were munificently rewarded by a grant of vast estates from the confiscated
lands of the Lancastrian baronage, and by his elevation to the highest posts in the service
of the State. He was Captain of Calais, Admiral of the fleet in the Channel, and Warden of
the Western Marches. The command of the northern border lay in the hands of his brother, Lord
Montagu. A younger brother, George Neville, already raised to the post of Lord Chancellor,
was soon to receive the See of York. Lesser rewards fell to Warwick's uncles, the minor chiefs
of the House of Neville, Lords Falconberg, Abergavenny, and Latimer. The vast power which such
an accumulation of wealth and honours placed at the Earl's disposal was wielded with consummate
ability. In outer seeming Warwick was the very type of the feudal baron. He could raise armies
at his call from his own earldoms. Six hundred liveried retainers followed him to Parliament.
Thousands of dependants feasted in his courtyard. But few men were really further from the
feudal ideal. Active and ruthless warrior as he was, his enemies denied to the Earl the gift
of personal daring. In war he showed himself more general than soldier, and in spite of a series
of victories his genius was not so much military as diplomatic. A Burgundian chronicler who
knew him well describes him as the craftiest man of his day, "le plus soubtil homme de son
vivant." Secret, patient, without faith or loyalty, ruthless, unscrupulous, what Warwick excelled
in was intrigue, treachery, the contrivance of plots, and sudden desertions.

His temper brought out in terrible relief the moral disorganization of the time. The old order
of the world was passing away. Since the fall of the Roman Empire civil society had been held
together by the power of the given word, by the "fealty" and "loyalty" that bound vassal to
lord and lord to king. A common faith in its possession of supernatural truths and supernatural
powers had bound men together in the religious society which knew itself as the Church. But
the spell of religious belief was now broken and the feudal conception of society was passing
away. On the other hand the individual sense of personal duty, the political consciousness
of each citizen that national order and national welfare are essential to his own well-being,
had not yet come. The bonds which had held the world together through so many ages loosened
and broke only to leave man face to face with his own selfishness. The motives that sway and
ennoble the common conduct of men were powerless over the ruling classes. Pope and king, bishop
and noble, vied with each other in greed, in self-seeking, in lust, in faithlessness, in a
pitiless cruelty. It is this moral degradation that flings so dark a shade over the Wars of
the Roses. From no period in our annals do we turn with such weariness and disgust. Their savage
battles, their ruthless executions, their shameless treasons, seem all the more terrible from
the pure selfishness of the ends for which men fought, for the utter want of all nobleness
and chivalry in the contest itself, of all great result in its close. And it is this moral
disorganization that expresses itself in the men whom the civil war left behind it. Of honour,
of loyalty, of good faith, Warwick knew nothing. He had fought for the House of Neville rather
than for the House of York, had set Edward on the throne as a puppet whom he could rule at
his will, and his policy seemed to have gained its end in leaving the Earl master of the realm.

[Sidenote: Edward the Fourth]

In the three years which followed Towton the power of the Nevilles overshadowed that of the
king. Warwick was now all-powerful in the state, but the cessation of the war was the signal
for a silent strife between the Earl and his young sovereign. In Edward indeed Warwick was
to meet not only a consummate general but a politician whose subtlety and rapidity of conception
were far above his own. As a mere boy Edward had shown himself among the ablest and the most
pitiless of the warriors of the civil war. He had looked on with cool ruthlessness while grey-haired
nobles were hurried to the block. The terrible bloodshed of Towton woke no pity in his heart;
he turned from it only to frame a vast bill of attainder which drove twelve great nobles and
a hundred knights to beggary and exile. When treachery placed his harmless rival in his power
he visited him with cruel insult. His military ability had been displayed in his rapid march
upon London, the fierce blow which freed him from his enemy in the rear, the decisive victory
at Towton. But his political ability was slower in developing itself. In his earliest years
he showed little taste for the work of rule. While Warwick was winning triumphs on battle-field
after battle-field, the young king seemed to abandon himself to a voluptuous indolence, to
revels with the city wives of London, and to the caresses of mistresses like Jane Shore. Tall
in stature and of singular beauty, his winning manners and gay carelessness of bearing secured
Edward a popularity which had been denied to nobler kings. When he asked a rich old lady for
ten pounds towards a war with France, she answered, "For thy comely face thou shalt have twenty."
The king thanked and kissed her, and the old woman made her twenty forty. In outer appearance
indeed no one could contrast more utterly with the subtle sovereigns of his time, with the
mean-visaged Lewis of France or the meanly-clad Ferdinand of Aragon. But Edward's work was
the same as theirs and it was done as completely. While jesting with aldermen, or dallying
with mistresses, or idling over new pages from the printing press at Westminster, Edward was
silently laying the foundations of an absolute rule.

The very faults of his nature helped him to success. His pleasure-loving and self-indulgent
temper needed the pressure of emergency, of actual danger, to flash out into action. Men like
Commines who saw him only in moments of security and indolence scorned Edward as dull, sensual,
easy to be led and gulled by keener wits. It was in the hour of need and despair that his genius
showed itself, cool, rapid, subtle, utterly fearless, moving straight to its aim through clouds
of treachery and intrigue, and striking hard when its aim was reached. But even in his idler
hours his purpose never wavered. His indolence and gaiety were in fact mere veils thrown over
a will of steel. From the first his aim was to free the Crown from the control of the baronage.
He made no secret of his hostility to the nobles. At Towton as in all his after battles he
bade his followers slay knight and baron, but spare the commons. In his earliest Parliament,
that of 1461, he renewed the statutes against giving of liveries, and though this enactment
proved as fruitless as its predecessors to reduce the households of the baronage it marked
Edward's resolve to adhere to the invariable policy of the Crown in striving for their reduction.
But efforts like these, though they indicated the young king's policy, could produce little
effect so long as the mightiest of the barons overawed the throne. Yet even a king as bold
as Edward might well have shrunk from a struggle with Warwick. The Earl was all-powerful in
the state; the military resources of the realm were in his hands. As Captain of Calais he was
master of the one disciplined force at the disposal of the Crown, and as admiral he controlled
the royal fleet. The strength he drew from his wide possessions, from his vast wealth (for
his official revenues alone were estimated at eighty thousand crowns a year), from his warlike
renown and his wide kinship, was backed by his personal popularity. Above all the Yorkist party,
bound to Warwick by a long series of victories, looked on him rather than on the young and
untried king as its head.

[Sidenote: Lewis the Eleventh]

The policy of Warwick pointed to a close alliance with France. The Hundred Years War, though
it had driven the English from Guienne and the south, had left the French Monarchy hemmed in
by great feudatories on every other border. Britanny was almost independent in the west. On
the east the house of Anjou lay, restless and ambitious, in Lorraine and Provence, while the
house of Burgundy occupied its hereditary duchy and Franche Comté. On the northern frontier
the same Burgundian house was massing together into a single state nearly all the crowd of
counties, marquisates, and dukedoms which now make up Holland and Belgium. Nobles hardly less
powerful or more dependent on the Crown held the central provinces of the kingdom when Lewis
the Eleventh mounted its throne but a few months after Edward's accession. The temper of the
new king drove him to a strife for the mastery of his realm, and his efforts after centralization
and a more effective rule soon goaded the baronage into a mood of revolt. But Lewis saw well
that a struggle with it was only possible if England stood aloof. His father's cool sagacity
had planned the securing of his conquests by the marriage of Lewis himself to an English wife,
and though this project had fallen through, and the civil wars had given safety to France to
the end of Charles's reign, the ruin of the Lancastrian cause at Towton again roused the danger
of attack from England at the moment when Lewis mounted the throne. Its young and warlike king,
the great baron who was still fresh from the glory of Towton, might well resolve to win back
the heritage of Eleanor, that Duchy of Guienne which had been lost but some ten years before.
Even if such an effort proved fruitless, Lewis saw that an English war would not only ruin
his plans for the overthrow of the nobles, but would leave him more than ever at their mercy.
Above all it would throw him helplessly into the hands of the Burgundian Duke. In the new struggle
as in the old the friendship of Burgundy could alone bring a favourable issue, and such a friendship
would have to be paid for by sacrifices even more terrible than those which had been wrenched
from the need of Charles the Seventh. The passing of Burgundy from the side of England to the
side of France after the Treaty of Arras had been bought by the cession to its Duke of the
towns along the Somme, of that Picardy which brought the Burgundian frontier to some fifty
miles from Paris. Sacrifices even more costly would have to buy the aid of Burgundy in a struggle
with Edward the Fourth.

[Sidenote: The Triple Alliance]

How vivid was his sense of these dangers was seen in the eagerness of Lewis to get the truce
with England renewed and extended. But his efforts for a general peace broke down before the
demands of the English council for the restoration of Normandy and Guienne. Nor were his difficulties
from England alone. An English alliance was unpopular in France itself. "Seek no friendship
from the English, Sire!" said Pierre de Brézé, the Seneschal of Normandy, "for the more they
love you, the more all Frenchmen will hate you!" All Lewis could do was to fetter Edward's
action by giving him work at home. When Margaret appealed to him for aid after Towton he refused
any formal help, but her pledge to surrender Calais in case of success drew from him some succour
in money and men which enabled the queen to renew the struggle in the north. Though her effort
failed, the hint so roughly given had been enough to change the mood of the English statesmen;
the truce with France was renewed, and a different reception met the new proposals of alliance
which followed it. Lewis indeed was now busy with an even more pressing danger. In any struggle
of the king with England or the nobles what gave Burgundy its chief weight was the possession
of the towns on the Somme, and it was his consciousness of the vital importance of these to
his throne that spurred Lewis to a bold and dexterous diplomacy by which Duke Philip the Good,
under the influence of counsellors who looked to the French king for protection against the
Duke's son, Charles of Charolais, was brought to surrender Picardy on payment of the sum stipulated
for its ransom in the Treaty of Arras. The formal surrender of the towns on the Somme took
place in October 1463, but they were hardly his own when Lewis turned to press his alliance
upon England. From Picardy, where he was busy in securing his newly-won possessions, he sought
an interview with Warwick. His danger indeed was still great; for the irritated nobles were
already drawing together into a League of the Public Weal, and Charles of Charolais, indignant
at the counsellors who severed him from his father and at the king who traded through them
on the Duke's dotage, was eager to place himself at its head. But these counsellors, the Croys,
saw their own ruin as well as the ruin of Lewis in the success of a league of which Charles
was the head; and at their instigation Duke Philip busied himself at the opening of 1464 as
the mediator of an alliance which would secure Lewis against it, a triple alliance between
Burgundy and the French and English kings.

[Sidenote: Warwick's Policy]

Such an alliance had now become Warwick's settled policy. In it lay the certainty of peace
at home as abroad, the assurance of security to the throne which he had built up. While Henry
was sheltered in Scotland where French influence was supreme, and while Margaret of Anjou could
look for aid from France, the house of York could hope for no cessation of the civil war. A
union between France, Burgundy, and England left the partizans of Lancaster without hope. When
Lewis therefore summoned him to an interview on the Somme, Warwick, though unable to quit England
in face of the dangers which still threatened from the north, promised to send his brother
the Chancellor to conduct a negotiation. Whether the mission took place or no, the questions
not only of peace with France but of a marriage between Edward and one of the French king's
kinswomen were discussed in the English Council as early as the spring of 1464, for in the
May of that year a Burgundian agent announced to the Croys that an English embassy would be
despatched to St. Omer on the coming St. John's day to confer with Lewis and Duke Philip on
the peace and the marriage-treaty. But at this very moment Warwick, followed by the king, was
hurrying to meet a new rising which Margaret had brought about by a landing in the north. On
15th May the Lancastrians were finally routed by Lord Montagu in the battle of Hexham, and
the queen and her child driven over the Scotch border. The defeat of this rising seemed at
last to bring the miserable war to a close. The victory of Hexham, with the capture of Henry
that followed a year later, successes which were accepted by foreign powers as a final settlement
of the civil strife, left Edward's hands free as they had never been free before, while his
good fortune quickened the anxiety of Lewis, who felt every day the toils of the great confederacy
of the French princes closing more tightly round him. But Margaret was still in his hands,
and Warwick remained firm in his policy of alliance. At Michaelmas the Earl prepared to cross
the sea for the meeting at St. Omer.

[Sidenote: Edward's Marriage]

It was this moment that Edward chose for a sudden and decisive blow. Only six days before the
departure of the embassy the young king informed his Council that he was already wedded. By
a second match with a Kentish knight, Sir Richard Woodville, Jacquetta of Luxemburg, the widow
of the Regent Duke of Bedford, had become the mother of a daughter Elizabeth. Elizabeth married
Sir John Grey, a Lancastrian partizan, but his fall some few years back in the second battle
of St. Albans left her a widow, and she returned to her mother's home. Here on his march northward
to meet the rising which ended at Hexham, she caught the young king's fancy. At the opening
of May, at the moment when Warwick's purpose to conclude the marriage-treaty was announced
to the court of Burgundy, Edward secretly made her his wife. He reserved, however, the announcement
of his marriage till the very eve of the negotiations, when its disclosure served not only
to shatter Warwick's plans but to strike a sudden and decisive blow at the sway he had wielded
till now in the royal Council. The blow in fact was so sudden and unexpected that Warwick could
only take refuge in a feigned submission. "The King," wrote one of his partizans, Lord Wenlock,
to the Court of Burgundy, "has taken a wife at his pleasure, without knowledge of them whom
he ought to have called to counsel him; by reason of which it is highly displeasing to many
great lords and to the bulk of his Council. But since the marriage has gone so far that it
cannot be helped, we must take patience in spite of ourselves." Not only did the negotiations
with France come to an end, but the Earl found himself cut off from the king's counsels. "As
one knows not," wrote his adherent, "seeing the marriage is made in this way, what purpose
the King may have to go on with the other two points, truce or peace, the opinion of the Council
is that my Lord of Warwick will not pass the sea till one learns the King's will and pleasure
on that point." Even Warwick indeed might have paused before the new aspect of affairs across
the Channel. For at this moment the growing weakness of Duke Philip enabled Charles of Charolais
to overthrow the Croys, and to become the virtual ruler of the Burgundian states. At the close
of 1464 the League of the Public Weal drew fast to a head, and Charles despatched the Chancellor
of Burgundy to secure the aid of England. But the English Council met the advances of the League
with coldness. Edward himself could have seen little save danger to his throne from its triumph.
Count Charles, proud of his connexion with the House of Lancaster through his Portuguese mother,
a descendant of John of Gaunt, was known to be hostile to the Yorkist throne. The foremost
of his colleagues, John of Calabria, was a son of René of Anjou and a brother of Margaret.
Another of the conspirators, the Count of Maine, was Margaret's uncle. It was significant that
the Duke of Somerset had found a place in the train of Charles of Charolais. On the other hand
the warmest advocates of the French alliance could hardly press for closer relations with a
king whose ruin seemed certain, and even Warwick must have been held back by the utter collapse
of the royal power when the League attacked Lewis in 1465. Deserted by every great noble, and
cooped up within the walls of Paris, the French king could only save himself by a humiliating
submission to the demands of the Leaguers.

[Sidenote: The Woodvilles]

The close of the struggle justified Edward's policy of inaction, for the terms of the peace
told strongly for English interests. The restoration of the towns on the Somme to Burgundy,
the cession of Normandy to the king's brother, Francis, the hostility of Britanny, not only
detached the whole western coast from the hold of Lewis, but forced its possessors to look
for aid to the English king who lay in their rear. Edward himself seemed at this moment freed
from the last danger of revolt at home, for after some helpless wanderings Henry the Sixth
was betrayed into the hands of his enemies and brought in triumph to London. His feet were
tied to the stirrups, he was led thrice round the pillory, and then sent as a prisoner to the
Tower. But Edward had little time to enjoy his good luck at home and abroad. No sooner had
the army of the League broken up than its work was undone. The restless genius of Lewis detached
prince from prince, won over the houses of Britanny and Anjou to friendship, snatched back
Normandy in January 1466, and gathered an army in Picardy to meet attack either from England
or Count Charles. From neither however was any serious danger to be feared. Charles was held
at home till the close of the year by revolts at Liége and Dinant, while a war of factions
within Edward's court distracted the energies of England. The young king had rapidly followed
up the blow of his marriage by raising his wife's family to a greatness which was meant to
balance that of the Nevilles. The queen's father, Lord Rivers, was made treasurer and constable;
her brothers and sisters were matched with great nobles and heiresses; the heiress of the Duke
of Exeter, Edward's niece, whose hand Warwick sought for his brother's son, was betrothed to
Elizabeth's son by her former marriage. The king's confidence was given to his new kinsmen,
and Warwick saw himself checked even at the council-board by the influence of the Woodvilles.
Still true to an alliance with France, he was met by their advocacy of an alliance with Burgundy,
where Charles of Charolais through his father's sickness and age was now supreme. Both powers
were equally eager for English aid. Lewis despatched an envoy to prolong the truce from his
camp on the Somme, and proposed to renew negotiations for a marriage treaty by seeking the
hand of Edward's sister, Margaret, for a French prince. Though "the thing which Charles hated
most," as Commines tells us, "was the house of York," the stress of politics drew him as irresistibly
to Edward. His wife, Isabella of Bourbon, had died during the war of the League, and much as
such a union was "against his heart," the activity of Lewis forced him at the close of 1466
to seek to buy English aid by demanding Margaret's hand in marriage.

[Sidenote: The two Alliances]

It is from this moment that the two great lines of our foreign policy become settled and defined.
In drawing together the states of the Low Countries into a single political body, the Burgundian
Dukes had built up a power which has ever since served as a barrier against the advance of
France to the north or its mastery of the Rhine. To maintain this power, whether in the hands
of the Dukes or their successors, the Spaniard or the Emperor, has always been a foremost object
of English statesmanship; and the Burgundian alliance in its earlier or later shapes has been
the constant rival of the alliance with France. At this moment however the attitude of Burgundy
was one rather of attack than of defence. If Charles did not aim at the direct conquest of
France, he looked to such a weakening of it as would prevent Lewis from hindering the great
plan on which he had set his heart, the plan of uniting his scattered dominions on the northern
and eastern frontier of his rival by the annexation of Lorraine, and of raising them into a
great European power by extending his dominion along the whole course of the Rhine. His policy
was still to strengthen the great feudatories against the Crown. "I love France so much," he
laughed, "that I had rather it had six kings than one"; and weak as the league of the Public
Weal had proved he was already trying to build up a new confederacy against Lewis. In this
confederacy he strove that England should take part. Throughout 1466 the English court was
the field for a diplomatic struggle between Charles and Lewis. Warwick pressed Margaret's marriage
with one of the French princes. The marriage with Charles was backed by the Woodvilles. Edward
bore himself between the two parties with matchless perfidy. Apparently yielding to the counsels
of the Earl, he despatched him in 1467 to treat for peace with Lewis at Rouen. Warwick was
received with honours which marked the importance of his mission in the French king's eyes.
Bishops and clergy went out to meet him, his attendants received gifts of velvet robes and
the rich stuffs of Rouen, and for twelve days the Earl and Lewis were seen busy in secret conference.
But while the Earl was busy with the French king the Great Bastard of Burgundy crossed to England,
and a sumptuous tourney, in which he figured with one of the Woodvilles, hardly veiled the
progress of counter-negotiations between Charles and Edward himself. The young king seized
on the honours paid to Warwick as the pretext for an outburst of jealousy. The seals were suddenly
taken from his brother, the Archbishop of York, and when the Earl himself returned with a draft-treaty,
stipulating a pension from France and a reference of the English claims on Normandy and Guienne
to the Pope's decision, Edward listened coldly and disavowed his envoy.

[Sidenote: The overthrow of Warwick]

Bitter reproaches on his intrigues with the French king marked even more vividly the close
of Warwick's power. He withdrew from court to his castle of Middleham, while the conclusion
of a marriage-treaty between Charles and Margaret proved the triumph of his rivals. The death
of his father in the summer of 1467 raised Charles to the Dukedom of Burgundy, and his diplomatic
success in England was followed by preparations for a new struggle with the French king. In
1468 a formal league bound England, Burgundy, and Britanny together against Lewis. While Charles
gathered an army in Picardy Edward bound himself to throw a body of troops into the strong
places of Normandy which were held by the Breton Duke; and six thousand mounted archers under
the queen's brother, Anthony, Lord Scales, were held ready to cross the Channel. Parliament
was called together in May, and the announcement of the Burgundian alliance and of the king's
purpose to recover his heritage over sea was met by a large grant of supplies from the Commons.
In June the pompous marriage of Margaret with the Burgundian Duke set its seal on Edward's
policy. How strongly the current of national feeling ran in its favour was seen in Warwick's
humiliation. Warwick was helpless. The king's dexterous use of his conference with Lewis and
of the honours he had received from him gave him the colour of a false Englishman and of a
friend to France. Warwick lost power over the Yorkists. The war party, who formed the bulk
of it, went hotly with the king; the merchants, who were its most powerful support, leaned
to a close connexion with the master of Flanders and the Lower Rhine. The danger of his position
drove Warwick further and further from his old standing ground; he clung for aid to Lewis;
he became the French king's pensioner and dependent. At the French court he was looked upon
already as a partizan of the House of Lancaster. Edward dexterously seized on the rumour to
cut him off more completely from his old party. He called on him to confront his accusers;
and though Warwick purged himself of the charge, the stigma remained. The victor of Towton
was no longer counted as a good Yorkist. But, triumphant as he was, Edward had no mind to drive
the Earl into revolt, nor was Warwick ready for revenge. The two subtle enemies drew together
again. The Earl appeared at court; he was formally reconciled both to the king and to the Woodvilles;
as though to announce his conversion to the Burgundian alliance he rode before the new Duchess
Margaret on her way to the sea. His submission removed the last obstacle to the king's action,
and Edward declared his purpose to take the field in person against the king of France.

[Sidenote: The Marriage of Clarence]

But at the moment when the danger seemed greatest the quick, hard blows of Lewis paralyzed
the League. He called Margaret from Bar to Harfleur, where her faithful adherent Jasper Tudor,
the Earl of Pembroke, prepared to cross with a small force of French soldiers into Wales. The
dread of a Lancastrian rising should Margaret land in England hindered Lord Scales from crossing
the sea; and marking the slowness with which the Burgundian troops gathered in Picardy Lewis
flung himself in September on the Breton Duke, reduced him to submission, and exacted the surrender
of the Norman towns which offered an entry for the English troops. His eagerness to complete
his work by persuading Charles to recognize his failure in a personal interview threw him into
the Duke's hands; and though he was released at the end of the year it was only on humiliating
terms. But the danger from the triple alliance was over; he had bought a fresh peace with Burgundy,
and Edward's hopes of French conquest were utterly foiled. We can hardly doubt that this failure
told on the startling revolution which marked the following year. Master of Calais, wealthy,
powerful as he was, Warwick had shown by his feigned submission a consciousness that single-handed
he was no match for the king. In detaching from him the confidence of the Yorkist party which
had regarded him as its head, Edward had robbed him of his strength. But the king was far from
having won the Yorkist party to himself. His marriage with the widow of a slain Lancastrian,
his promotion of a Lancastrian family to the highest honours, estranged him from the men who
had fought his way to the Crown. Warwick saw that the Yorkists could still be rallied round
the elder of Edward's brothers, the Duke of Clarence; and the temper of Clarence, weak and
greedy of power, hating the Woodvilles, looking on himself as heir to the crown yet dreading
the claims of Edward's daughter Elizabeth, lent itself to his arts. The spring of 1469 was
spent in intrigues to win over Clarence by offering him the hand of Warwick's elder daughter
and co-heiress, and in preparations for a rising in Lancashire. So secretly were these conducted
that Edward was utterly taken by surprise when Clarence and the Earl met in July at Calais
and the marriage of the Duke proved the signal for a rising at home.

[Sidenote: Warwick's failure]

The revolt turned out a formidable one. The first force sent against it was cut to pieces at
Edgecote near Banbury, and its leaders, Earl Rivers and one of the queen's brothers, taken
and beheaded. Edward was hurrying to the support of this advanced body when it was defeated;
but on the news his force melted away and he was driven to fall back upon London. Galled as
he had been by his brother's marriage, the king saw nothing in it save the greed of Clarence
for the Earl's heritage, and it was with little distrust that he summoned Warwick with the
trained troops who formed the garrison of Calais to his aid. The Duke and Earl at once crossed
the Channel. Gathering troops as they moved, they joined Edward near Oxford, and the end of
their plot was at last revealed. No sooner had the armies united than Edward found himself
virtually a prisoner in Warwick's hands. But the bold scheme broke down. The Yorkist nobles
demanded the king's liberation. London called for it. The Duke of Burgundy "practised secretly,"
says Commines, "that King Edward might escape," and threatened to break off all trade with
Flanders if he were not freed. Warwick could look for support only to the Lancastrians, but
the Lancastrians demanded Henry's restoration as the price of their aid. Such a demand was
fatal to the plan for placing Clarence on the throne, and Warwick was thrown back on a formal
reconciliation with the king. Edward was freed, and Duke and Earl withdrew to their estates
for the winter. But the impulse which Warwick had given to his adherents brought about a new
rising in the spring of 1470. A force gathered in Lincolnshire under Sir Robert Welles with
the avowed purpose of setting Clarence on the throne; and Warwick and the Duke, though summoned
to Edward's camp on pain of being held for traitors, remained sullenly aloof. The king however
was now ready for the strife. A rapid march to the north ended in the rout of the insurgents,
and Edward turned on the instigators of the rising. But Clarence and the Earl could gather
no force to meet him. Yorkist and Lancastrian alike held aloof, and they were driven to flight.
Calais, though held by Warwick's deputy, repulsed them from its walls, and the Earl's fleet
was forced to take refuge in the harbours of France.

[Sidenote: Warwick in France]

The long struggle seemed at last over. In subtlety as in warlike daring the young king had
proved himself more than a match for the "subtlest man of men now living." He had driven him
to throw himself on "our adversary of France." Warwick's hold over the Yorkists was all but
gone. His own brothers, the Earl of Northumberland and the Archbishop of York, held with the
king, and Edward counted on the first as a firm friend. Warwick had lost Calais. Though he
still retained his fleet he was forced to support it by making prizes of Flemish ships, and
this involved him in fresh difficulties. The Duke of Burgundy made the reception of these ships
in French harbours the pretext for a new strife with Lewis; he seized the goods of French merchants
at Bruges and demanded redress. Lewis was in no humour for risking for so small a matter the
peace he had won, and refused to see or speak with Warwick till the prizes were restored. But
he was soon driven from this neutral position. The violent language of Duke Charles showed
his desire to renew the war with France in the faith that Warwick's presence at the French
court would ensure Edward's support; and Lewis resolved to prevent such a war by giving Edward
work to do at home. He supplied Warwick with money and men, and pressed him to hasten his departure
for England. "You know," he wrote to an agent, "the desire I have for Warwick's return to England,
as well because I wish to see him get the better of his enemies as that at least through him
the realm of England may be again thrown into confusion, so as to avoid the questions which
have arisen out of his residence here." But Warwick was too cautious a statesman to hope to
win England with French troops only. His hopes of Yorkist aid were over with the failure of
Clarence; and, covered as he was with Lancastrian blood, he turned to the House of Lancaster.
Margaret was summoned to the French court; the mediation of Lewis bent her proud spirit to
a reconciliation on Warwick's promise to restore her husband to the throne, and after a fortnight's
struggle she consented at the close of July to betroth her son to the earl's second daughter,
Anne Neville. Such an alliance shielded Warwick, as he trusted, from Lancastrian vengeance,
but it at once detached Clarence from his cause. Edward had already made secret overtures to
his brother, and though Warwick strove to reconcile the Duke to his new policy by a provision
that in default of heirs to the son of Margaret Clarence should inherit the throne, the Duke's
resentment drew him back to his brother's side. But whether by Edward's counsel or no his resentment
was concealed; Clarence swore fealty to the house of Lancaster, and joined in the preparations
which Warwick was making for a landing in England.

[Sidenote: Edward driven out]

What the Earl really counted on was not so much Lancastrian aid as Yorkist treason. Edward
reckoned on the loyalty of Warwick's brothers, the Archbishop of York and Lord Montagu. The
last indeed he "loved," and Montagu's firm allegiance during his brother's defection seemed
to justify his confidence in him. But in his desire to redress some of the wrongs of the civil
war Edward had utterly estranged the Nevilles. In 1469 he released Henry Percy from the Tower,
and restored to him the title and estates of his father, the attainted Earl of Northumberland.
Montagu had possessed both as his share of the Yorkist spoil, and though Edward made him a
marquis in amends he had ever since nursed plans of revenge. From after events it is clear
that he had already pledged himself to betray the king. But his treachery was veiled with consummate
art, and in spite of repeated warnings from Burgundy Edward remained unconcerned at the threats
of invasion. Of the Yorkist party he held himself secure since Warwick's desertion of their
cause; of the Lancastrians he had little fear; and the powerful fleet of Duke Charles prisoned
the Earl's ships in the Norman harbours. Fortune however was with his foes. A rising called
Edward to the north in September, and while he was engaged in its suppression a storm swept
the Burgundian ships from the Channel. Warwick seized the opportunity to cross the sea. On
the thirteenth of September he landed with Clarence at Dartmouth, and with an army which grew
at every step pushed rapidly northward to meet the king. Taken as he was by surprise, Edward
felt little dread of the conflict. He relied on the secret promises of Clarence and on the
repeated oaths of the two Nevilles, and called on Charles of Burgundy to cut off Warwick's
retreat by sea after the victory on which he counted. But the Earl's army no sooner drew near
than cries of "Long live King Henry!" from Montagu's camp announced his treason. Panic spread
through the royal forces; and in the rout that followed Edward could only fly to the shore,
and embarking some eight hundred men who still clung to him in a few trading vessels which
he found there set sail for the coast of Holland.

[Sidenote: Warwick's triumph]

In a single fortnight Warwick had destroyed a throne. The work of Towton was undone. The House
of Lancaster was restored. Henry the Sixth was drawn from the Tower to play again the part
of king, while his rival could only appeal as a destitute fugitive to the friendship of Charles
the Bold. But Charles had small friendship to give. His disgust at the sudden overthrow of
his plans for a joint attack on Lewis was quickened by a sense of danger. England was now at
the French king's disposal, and the coalition of England and Burgundy against France which
he had planned seemed likely to become a coalition of France and England against Burgundy.
Lewis indeed was quick to seize on the new turn of affairs. Thanksgivings were ordered in every
French town. Margaret and her son were feasted royally at Paris. An embassy crossed the sea
to conclude a treaty of alliance, and Warwick promised that an immediate force of four thousand
men should be despatched to Calais. With English aid the king felt he could become assailant
in his turn; he declared the Duke of Burgundy a rebel, and pushed his army rapidly to the Somme.
How keenly Charles felt his danger was seen in his refusal to receive Edward at his court,
and in his desperate attempts to conciliate the new English government. His friendship, he
said, was not for this or that English king but for England. He again boasted of his Lancastrian
blood. He despatched the Lancastrian Dukes of Somerset and Exeter, who had found refuge ever
since Towton at his court, to carry fair words to Margaret. The queen and her son were still
at Paris, detained as it was said by unfavourable winds, but really by the wish of Lewis to
hold a check upon Warwick and by their own distrust of him. Triumphant indeed as he seemed,
the Earl found himself alone in the hour of his triumph. The marriage of Prince Edward with
Anne Neville, which had been promised as soon as Henry was restored, was his one security against
the vengeance of the Lancastrians, and the continued delays of Margaret showed little eagerness
to redeem her promise. The heads of the Lancastrian party, the Dukes of Somerset and Exeter,
had pledged themselves to Charles the Bold at their departure from his court to bring about
Warwick's ruin. From Lewis he could look for no further help, for the remonstrances of the
English merchants compelled him in spite of the treaty he had concluded to keep the troops
he had promised against Burgundy at home. Of his own main supporters Clarence was only waiting
for an opportunity of deserting him. Even his brother Montagu shrank from striking fresh blows
to further the triumph of a party which aimed at the ruin of the Nevilles, and looked forward
with dread to the coming of the queen.

[Sidenote: Fall of Warwick]

The preparations for her departure in March brought matters to a head. With a French queen
on the throne a French alliance became an instant danger for Burgundy, and Charles was driven
to lend a secret ear to Edward's prayer for aid. Money and ships were placed at his service,
and on the fourteenth of March 1471 the young king landed at Ravenspur on the estuary of the
Humber with a force of two thousand men. In the north all remained quiet. York opened its gates
when Edward professed to be seeking not the crown but his father's dukedom. Montagu lay motionless
at Pomfret as the little army marched by him to the south. Routing at Newark a force which
had gathered on his flank, Edward pushed straight for Warwick, who had hurried from London
to raise an army in his own county. His forces were already larger than those of his cousin,
but the Earl cautiously waited within the walls of Coventry for the reinforcements under Clarence
and Montagu which he believed to be hastening to his aid. The arrival of Clarence however was
at once followed by his junction with Edward, and the offer of "good conditions" shows that
Warwick himself was contemplating a similar treason when the coming of two Lancastrian leaders,
the Duke of Exeter and the Earl of Oxford, put an end to the negotiation. The union of Montagu
with his brother forced Edward to decisive action; he marched upon London, followed closely
by Warwick's army, and found its gates opened by the perfidy of Archbishop Neville. Again master
of Henry of Lancaster who passed anew to the Tower, Edward sallied afresh from the capital
two days after his arrival with an army strongly reinforced. At early dawn on the fourteenth
of April the two hosts fronted one another at Barnet. A thick mist covered the field, and beneath
its veil Warwick's men fought fiercely till dread of mutual betrayal ended the strife. Montagu's
followers attacked the Lancastrian soldiers of Lord Oxford, whether as some said through an
error which sprang from the similarity of his cognizance to that of Edward, or as the Lancastrians
alleged while themselves in the act of deserting to the enemy. Warwick himself was charged
with cowardly flight. In three hours the medley of carnage and treason was over. Four thousand
men lay on the field; and the Earl and his brother were found among the slain.

[Sidenote: Battle of Tewkesbury]

But the fall of the Nevilles was far from giving rest to Edward. The restoration of Henry,
the return of their old leaders, had revived the hopes of the Lancastrian party; and in the
ruin of Warwick they saw only the removal of an obstacle to their cause. The great Lancastrian
lords had been looking forward to a struggle with the Earl on Margaret's arrival, and their
jealousy of him was seen in the choice of the queen's landing-place. Instead of joining her
husband and the Nevilles in London she disembarked from the French fleet at Weymouth, to find
the men of the western counties already flocking to the standards of the Duke of Somerset and
of the Courtenays, the Welsh arming at the call of Jasper Tudor, and Cheshire and Lancashire
only waiting for her presence to rise. A march upon London with forces such as these would
have left Warwick at her mercy and freed the Lancastrian throne from the supremacy of the Nevilles.
The news of Barnet which followed hard on the queen's landing scattered these plans to the
winds; but the means which had been designed to overawe Warwick might still be employed against
his conqueror. Moving to Exeter to gather the men of Devonshire and Cornwall, Margaret turned
through Taunton on Bath to hear that Edward was already encamped in her front at Cirencester.
The young king's action showed his genius for war. Barnet was hardly fought when he was pushing
to the west. After a halt at Abingdon to gain news of Margaret's movements he moved rapidly
by Cirencester and Malmesbury towards the Lancastrians at Bath. But Margaret was as eager to
avoid a battle before her Welsh reinforcements reached her as Edward was to force one on. Slipping
aside to Bristol, and detaching a small body of troops to amuse the king by a feint upon Sodbury,
her army reached Berkeley by a night-march and hurried forward through the following day to
Tewkesbury. But rapid as their movements had been, they had failed to outstrip Edward. Marching
on an inner line along the open Cotswold country while his enemy was struggling through the
deep and tangled lanes of the Severn valley, the king was now near enough to bring Margaret
to bay; and the Lancastrian leaders were forced to take their stand on the slopes south of
the town, in a position approachable only through "foul lanes and deep dykes." Here Edward
at once fell on them at daybreak of the fourth of May. His army, if smaller in numbers, was
superior in military quality to the motley host gathered round the queen, for as at Barnet
he had with him a force of Germans armed with hand-guns, then a new weapon in war, and a fine
train of artillery. It was probably the fire from these that drew Somerset from the strong
position which he held, but his repulse and the rout of the force he led was followed up with
quick decision. A general advance broke the Lancastrian lines, and all was over. Three thousand
were cut down on the field, and a large number of fugitives were taken in the town and abbey.
To the leaders short shrift was given. Edward was resolute to make an end of his foes. The
fall of the Duke of Somerset extinguished the male branch of the house of Beaufort. Margaret
was a prisoner; and with the murder of her son after his surrender on the field and the mysterious
death of Henry the Sixth in the Tower which followed the king's return to the capital the direct
line of Lancaster passed away.

[Sidenote: Charles and the Empire]

Edward was at last master of his realm. No noble was likely to measure swords with the conqueror
of the Nevilles. The one rival who could revive the Lancastrian claims, the last heir of the
house of Beaufort, Henry Tudor, was a boy and an exile. The king was free to display his genius
for war on nobler fields than those of Barnet and Tewkesbury, and for a while his temper and
the passion of his people alike drove him to the strife with France. But the country was too
exhausted to meddle in the attack on Lewis which Charles, assured at any rate against English
hostility, renewed in 1472 in union with the Dukes of Guienne and Britanny, and which was foiled
as of old through the death of the one ally and the desertion of the other. The failure aided
in giving a turn to his policy, which was to bring about immense results on the after history
of Europe. French as he was in blood, the nature of his possessions had made Charles from the
first a German prince rather than a French. If he held of Lewis his duchy of Burgundy, his
domain on the Somme, and Flanders west of the Scheldt, the mass of his dominions was held of
the Empire. While he failed too in extending his power on the one side it widened rapidly on
the other. In war after war he had been unable to gain an inch of French ground beyond the
towns of the Somme. But year after year had seen new gains on his German frontier. Elsass and
the Breisgau passed into his hands as security for a loan to the Austrian Duke Sigismund; in
1473 he seized Lorraine by force of arms, and inherited from its Duke Gelderland and the county
of Cleves. Master of the Upper Rhine and Lower Rhine, as well as of a crowd of German princedoms,
Charles was now the mightiest among the princes of the Empire, and in actual power superior
to the Emperor himself. The house of Austria, in which the Imperial crown seemed to be becoming
hereditary, was weakened by attacks from without as by divisions within, by the loss of Bohemia
and Hungary, by the loss of its hold over German Switzerland, and still more by the mean and
spiritless temper of its Imperial head, Frederick the Third. But its ambition remained boundless
as ever; and in the Burgundian dominion, destined now to be the heritage of a girl, for Mary
was the Duke's only child, it saw the means of building up a greatness such as it had never
known. Its overtures at once turned the Duke's ambition from France to Germany. He was ready
to give his daughter's hand to Frederick's son, Maximilian; but his price was that of succession
to the Imperial crown, and his election to the dignity of King of the Romans. In such an event
the Empire and his vast dominions would pass together at his death to Maximilian, and the aim
of the Austrian House would be realized. It was to negotiate this marriage, a marriage which
in the end was destined to shape the political map of modern Europe, that Duke and Emperor
met in 1473 at Trier.

[Sidenote: Peace with France]

But if Frederick's policy was to strengthen his house the policy of the princes of the Empire
lay in keeping it weak; and their pressure was backed by suspicions of the Duke's treachery,
and of the possibility of a later marriage whose male progeny might for ever exclude the house
of Austria from the Imperial throne. Frederick's sudden flight broke up the conference; but
Charles was far from relinquishing his plans. To win the mastery of the whole Rhine valley
was the first step in their realization, and at the opening of 1474 he undertook the siege
of Neuss, whose reduction meant that of Köln and of the central district which broke his sway
along it. But vast as were the new dreams of ambition which thus opened before Charles, he
had given no open sign of his change of purpose. Lewis watched his progress on the Rhine almost
as jealously as his attitude on the Somme; and the friendship of England was still of the highest
value as a check on any attempt of France to interrupt his plans. With this view the Duke maintained
his relations with England and fed Edward's hopes of a joint invasion. In the summer of 1474,
on the eve of his march upon the Rhine, he concluded a treaty for an attack on France which
was to open on his return after the capture of Neuss. Edward was to recover Normandy and Aquitaine
as well as his "kingdom of France"; Champagne and Bar were to be the prizes of Charles. Through
the whole of 1474 the English king prepared actively for war. A treaty was concluded with Britanny.
The nation was wild with enthusiasm. Large supplies were granted by Parliament: and a large
army gathered for the coming campaign. The plan of attack was a masterly one. While Edward
moved from Normandy on Paris, the forces of Burgundy and of Britanny on his right hand and
his left were to converge on the same point. But the aim of Charles in these negotiations was
simply to hold Lewis from any intervention in his campaign on the Rhine. The siege of Neuss
was not opened till the close of July, and its difficulties soon unfolded themselves. Once
master of the whole Rhineland, the house of Austria saw that Charles would be strong enough
to wrest from it the succession to the Empire; and while Sigismund paid back his loan and roused
Elsass to revolt the Emperor Frederick brought the whole force of Germany to the relief of
the town. From that moment the siege was a hopeless one, but Charles clung to it with stubborn
pride through autumn, winter, and spring, and it was only at the close of June 1475 that the
menace of new leagues against his dominions on the upper Rhineland forced him to withdraw.
So broken was his army that he could not, even if he would, have aided in carrying out the
schemes of the preceding year. But an English invasion would secure him from attack by Lewis
till his forces could be reorganized; and with the same unscrupulous selfishness as of old
Charles pledged himself to co-operate and called on Edward to cross the Channel. In July Edward
landed with an army of twenty-four thousand men at Calais. In numbers and in completeness of
equipment no such force had as yet left English shores. But no Burgundian force was seen on
the Somme; and after long delays Charles proposed that Edward should advance alone upon Paris
on his assurance that the fortresses of the Somme would open their gates. The English army
crossed the Somme and approached St. Quentin, but it was repulsed from the walls by a discharge
of artillery. It was now the middle of August, and heavy rains prevented further advance; while
only excuses for delay came from Britanny and it became every day clearer that the Burgundian
Duke had no real purpose to aid. Lewis seized the moment of despair to propose peace on terms
which a conqueror might have accepted, the security of Britanny, the payment of what the English
deemed a tribute of fifty thousand crowns a year, and the betrothal of Edward's daughter to
the Dauphin. A separate treaty provided for mutual aid in case of revolt among the subjects
of either king; and for mutual shelter should either be driven from his realm. In spite of
remonstrances from the Duke of Burgundy this truce was signed at the close of August and the
English soldiers recrossed the sea.

[Sidenote: Edward's policy]

The desertion of Charles threw Edward, whether he would or no, on the French alliance; and
the ruin of the Duke explains the tenacity with which he clung to it. Defeated by the Swiss
at Morat in the following year, Charles fell in the opening of 1477 on the field of Nanci,
and his vast dominion was left in his daughter's charge. Lewis seized Picardy and Artois, the
Burgundian duchy and Franche Comté: and strove to gain the rest by forcing on Mary of Burgundy
the hand of the Dauphin. But the Imperial dreams which had been fatal to Charles had to be
carried out through the very ruin they wrought. Pressed by revolt in Flanders, and by the French
king's greed, Mary gave her hand to the Emperor's son, Maximilian; and her heritage passed
to the Austrian house. Edward took no part in the war between Lewis and Maximilian which followed
on the marriage. The contest between England and France had drifted into a mightier European
struggle between France and the House of Austria; and from this struggle the king wisely held
aloof. He saw what Henry the Seventh saw after him, and what Henry the Eighth learned at last
to see, that England could only join in such a contest as the tool of one or other of the combatants,
a tool to be used while the struggle lasted and to be thrown aside as soon as it was over.
With the growth of Austrian power England was secure from French aggression; and rapidly as
Lewis was adding province after province to his dominions his loyalty to the pledge he had
given of leaving Britanny untouched and his anxiety to conclude a closer treaty of amity in
1478 showed the price he set on his English alliance. Nor was Edward's course guided solely
by considerations of foreign policy. A French alliance meant peace; and peace was needful for
the plans which Edward proceeded steadily to carry out. With the closing years of his reign
the Monarchy took a new colour. The introduction of an elaborate spy system, the use of the
rack, and the practice of interference with the purity of justice gave the first signs of an
arbitrary rule which the Tudors were to develope. It was on his creation of a new financial
system that the king laid the foundation of a despotic rule. Rich, and secure at home as abroad,
Edward had small need to call the Houses together; no parliament met for five years, and when
one was called at last it was suffered to do little but raise the custom duties, which were
now granted to the king for life. Sums were extorted from the clergy; monopolies were sold;
the confiscations of the civil war filled the royal exchequer; Edward did not disdain to turn
merchant on his own account. The promise of a French war had not only drawn heavy subsidies
from the Commons, much of which remained in the royal treasury through the abrupt close of
the strife, but enabled the king to deal a deadly blow at the liberty which the Commons had
won. Edward set aside the usage of contracting loans by authority of parliament; and calling
before him the merchants of London, begged from each a gift or "benevolence" in proportion
to the royal needs. How bitterly this exaction was resented even by the classes with whom the
king had been most popular was seen in the protest which the citizens addressed to his successor
against these "extortions and new impositions against the laws of God and man and the liberty
and laws of this realm." But for the moment resistance was fruitless, and the "benevolence"
of Edward was suffered to furnish a precedent for the forced loans of Wolsey and of Charles
the First.

[Sidenote: Popularization of knowledge]

In the history of intellectual progress his reign takes a brighter colour. The founder of a
new despotism presents a claim to our regard as the patron of Caxton. It is in the life of
the first English printer that we see the new upgrowth of larger and more national energies
which were to compensate for the decay of the narrower energies of the Middle Age. Beneath
the mouldering forms of the old world a new world was bursting into life; if the fifteenth
century was an age of death it was an age of birth as well, of that new birth, that Renascence,
from which the after life of Europe was to flow. The force which till now concentrated itself
in privileged classes was beginning to diffuse itself through nations. The tendency of the
time was to expansion, to diffusion. The smaller gentry and the merchant class rose in importance
as the nobles fell. Religion and morality passed out of the hands of the priesthood into those
of the laity. Knowledge became vulgarized, it stooped to lower and meaner forms that it might
educate the whole people. England was slow to catch the intellectual fire which was already
burning brightly across the Alps, but even amidst the turmoil of its wars and revolutions intelligence
was being more widely spread. While the older literary class was dying out, a glance beneath
the surface shows us the stir of a new interest in knowledge amongst the masses of the people
itself. The very character of the authorship of the time, its love of compendiums and abridgements
of such scientific and historical knowledge as the world believed it possessed, its dramatic
performances or mysteries, the commonplace morality of its poets, the popularity of its rimed
chronicles, are proof that literature was ceasing to be the possession of a purely intellectual
class, and was beginning to appeal to the nation at large. The correspondence of the Paston
family not only displays a fluency and grammatical correctness which would have been impossible
a few years before, but shows country squires discussing about books and gathering libraries.
The increased use of linen paper in place of the costlier parchment helped in the popularization
of letters. In no former age had finer copies of books been produced; in none had so many been
transcribed. This increased demand for their production caused the processes of copying and
illuminating manuscripts to be transferred from the scriptoria of the religious houses into
the hands of trade-gilds like the Gild of St. John at Bruges or the Brothers of the Pen at
Brussels. It was in fact this increase of demand for books, pamphlets, or fly-sheets, especially
of a grammatical or religious character, in the middle of the fifteenth century that brought
about the introduction of printing. We meet with the first records of the printer's art in
rude sheets struck off from wooden blocks, "block-books" as they are now called. Later on came
the vast advance of printing from separate and moveable types. Originating at Maintz with the
three famous printers, Gutenberg, Fust, and Schoeffer, this new process travelled southward
to Strassburg, crossed the Alps to Venice, where it lent itself through the Aldi to the spread
of Greek literature in Europe, and then floated down the Rhine to the towns of Flanders.

[Sidenote: Caxton]

It was probably at the press of Colard Mansion, in a little room over the porch of St. Donat's
at Bruges, that William Caxton learned the art which he was the first to introduce into England.
A Kentish boy by birth, but apprenticed to a London mercer, Caxton had already spent thirty
years of his manhood in Flanders as Governor of the English gild of Merchant Adventurers there
when we find him engaged as copyist in the service of Edward's sister, Duchess Margaret of
Burgundy. But the tedious process of copying was soon thrown aside for the new art which Colard
Mansion had introduced into Bruges. "For as much as in the writing of the same," Caxton tells
us in the preface to his first printed work, the Tales of Troy, "my pen is worn, my hand weary
and not steadfast, mine eyes dimmed with over much looking on the white paper, and my courage
not so prone and ready to labour as it hath been, and that age creepeth on me daily and feebleth
all the body, and also because I have promised to divers gentlemen and to my friends to address
to them as hastily as I might the said book, therefore I have practised and learned at my great
charge and dispense to ordain this said book in print after the manner and form as ye may see,
and is not written with pen and ink as other books be, to the end that every man may have them
at once, for all the books of this story here emprynted as ye see were begun in one day and
also finished in one day." The printing-press was the precious freight he brought back to England
in 1476 after an absence of five-and-thirty years. Through the next fifteen, at an age when
other men look for ease and retirement, we see him plunging with characteristic energy into
his new occupation. His "red pale," or heraldic shield marked with a red bar down the middle,
invited buyers to the press he established in the Almonry at Westminster, a little enclosure
containing a chapel and almshouses near the west front of the church, where the alms of the
abbey were distributed to the poor. "If it please any man, spiritual or temporal," runs his
advertisement, "to buy any pyes of two or three commemorations of Salisbury use emprynted after
the form of the present letter, which be well and truly correct, let him come to Westminster
into the Almonry at the red pale, and he shall have them good chepe." Caxton was a practical
man of business, as this advertisement shows, no rival of the Venetian Aldi or of the classical
printers of Rome, but resolved to get a living from his trade, supplying priests with service
books and preachers with sermons, furnishing the clerk with his "Golden Legend" and knight
and baron with "joyous and pleasant histories of chivalry." But while careful to win his daily
bread, he found time to do much for what of higher literature lay fairly to hand. He printed
all the English poetry of any moment which was then in existence. His reverence for that "worshipful
man, Geoffrey Chaucer," who "ought to be eternally remembered," is shown not merely by his
edition of the "Canterbury Tales," but by his reprint of them when a purer text of the poem
offered itself. The poems of Lydgate and Gower were added to those of Chaucer. The Chronicle
of Brut and Higden's "Polychronicon" were the only available works of an historical character
then existing in the English tongue, and Caxton not only printed them but himself continued
the latter up to his own time. A translation of Boethius, a version of the Æneid from the French,
and a tract or two of Cicero, were the stray first-fruits of the classical press in England.

[Sidenote: Caxton's work]

Busy as was Caxton's printing-press, he was even busier as a translator than as a printer.
More than four thousand of his printed pages are from works of his own rendering. The need
of these translations shows the popular drift of literature at the time; but, keen as the demand
seems to have been, there is nothing mechanical in the temper with which Caxton prepared to
meet it. A natural, simple-hearted taste and enthusiasm, especially for the style and forms
of language, breaks out in his curious prefaces. "Having no work in hand," he says in the preface
to his Æneid, "I sitting in my study where as lay many divers pamphlets and books, happened
that to my hand came a little book in French, which late was translated out of Latin by some
noble clerk of France--which book is named Eneydos, and made in Latin by that noble poet and
great clerk Vergyl--in which book I had great pleasure by reason of the fair and honest termes
and wordes in French which I never saw to-fore-like, none so pleasant nor so well ordered,
which book as me seemed should be much requisite for noble men to see, as well for the eloquence
as the histories; and when I had advised me to this said book I deliberated and concluded to
translate it into English, and forthwith took a pen and ink and wrote a leaf or twain." But
the work of translation involved a choice of English which made Caxton's work important in
the history of our language. He stood between two schools of translation, that of French affectation
and English pedantry. It was a moment when the character of our literary tongue was being settled,
and it is curious to see in his own words the struggle over it which was going on in Caxton's
time. "Some honest and great clerks have been with me and desired me to write the most curious
terms that I could find"; on the other hand, "some gentlemen of late blamed me, saying that
in my translations I had over many curious terms which could not be understood of common people,
and desired me to use old and homely terms in my translations." "Fain would I please every
man," comments the good-humoured printer, but his sturdy sense saved him alike from the temptations
of the court and the schools. His own taste pointed to English, but "to the common terms that
be daily used" rather than to the English of his antiquarian advisers. "I took an old book
and read therein, and certainly the English was so rude and broad I could not well understand
it," while the Old-English charters which the Abbot of Westminster lent as models from the
archives of his house seemed "more like to Dutch than to English." To adopt current phraseology
however was by no means easy at a time when even the speech of common talk was in a state of
rapid flux. "Our language now used varieth far from that which was used and spoken when I was
born." Not only so, but the tongue of each shire was still peculiar to itself and hardly intelligible
to men of another county. "Common English that is spoken in one shire varieth from another
so much, that in my days happened that certain merchants were in a ship in Thames for to have
sailed over the sea into Zealand, and for lack of wind they tarried at Foreland and went on
land for to refresh them. And one of them, named Sheffield, a mercer, came into a house and
asked for meat, and especially he asked them after eggs. And the good wife answered that she
could speak no French. And the merchant was angry, for he also could speak no French, but would
have eggs, but she understood him not. And then at last another said he would have eyren, then
the good wife said she understood him well. Lo! what should a man in these days now write,"
adds the puzzled printer, "eggs or eyren? certainly it is hard to please every man by cause
of diversity and change of language." His own mother-tongue too was that of "Kent in the Weald,
where I doubt not is spoken as broad and rude English as in any place in England"; and coupling
this with his long absence in Flanders we can hardly wonder at the confession he makes over
his first translation, that "when all these things came to fore me, after that I had made and
written a five or six quires, I fell in despair of this work, and purposed never to have continued
therein, and the quires laid apart, and in two years after laboured no more in this work."
He was still however busy translating when he died. All difficulties in fact were lightened
by the general interest which his labours aroused. When the length of the "Golden Legend" makes
him "half desperate to have accomplished it" and ready to "lay it apart," the Earl of Arundel
solicits him in no wise to leave it and promises a yearly fee of a buck in summer and a doe
in winter, once it were done. "Many noble and divers gentle men of this realm came and demanded
many and often times wherefore I have not made and imprinted the noble history of the 'San
Graal.'" We see his visitors discussing with the sagacious printer the historic existence of
Arthur. Duchess Margaret of Somerset lent him her "Blanchardine and Eglantine"; an Archdeacon
of Colchester brought him his translation of the work called "Cato"; a mercer of London pressed
him to undertake the "Royal Book" of Philip le Bel. Earl Rivers chatted with him over his own
translation of the "Sayings of the Philosophers." Even kings showed their interest in his work;
his "Tully" was printed under the patronage of Edward the Fourth, his "Order of Chivalry" dedicated
to Richard the Third, his "Fayts of Arms" published at the desire of Henry the Seventh. Caxton
profited in fact by the wide literary interest which was a mark of the time. The fashion of
large and gorgeous libraries had passed from the French to the English princes of his day:
Henry the Sixth had a valuable collection of books; that of the Louvre was seized by Duke Humphrey
of Gloucester and formed the basis of the fine library which he presented to the University
of Oxford. Great nobles took an active and personal part in the literary revival. The warrior,
Sir John Fastolf, was a well-known lover of books. Earl Rivers was himself one of the authors
of the day; he found leisure in the intervals of pilgrimages and politics to translate the
"Sayings of the Philosophers" and a couple of religious tracts for Caxton's press. A friend
of far greater intellectual distinction however than these was found in John Tiptoft Earl of
Worcester. He had wandered during the reign of Henry the Sixth in search of learning to Italy,
had studied at her universities and become a teacher at Padua, where the elegance of his Latinity
drew tears from the most learned of the Popes, Pius the Second, better known as Æneas Sylvius.
Caxton can find no words warm enough to express his admiration of one "which in his time flowered
in virtue and cunning, to whom I know none like among the lords of the temporality in science
and moral virtue." But the ruthlessness of the Renascence appeared in Tiptoft side by side
with its intellectual vigour, and the fall of one whose cruelty had earned him the surname
of "the Butcher" even amidst the horrors of civil war was greeted with sorrow by none but the
faithful printer.

[Sidenote: Richard of Gloucester]

Among the nobles who encouraged the work of Caxton was the king's youngest brother, Richard
Duke of Gloucester. Edward had never forgiven Clarence his desertion; and his impeachment in
1478 on a charge of treason, a charge soon followed by his death in the Tower, brought Richard
nearer to the throne. Ruthless and subtle as Edward himself, the Duke was already renowned
as a warrior; his courage and military skill had been shown at Barnet and Tewkesbury; and at
the close of Edward's reign an outbreak of strife with the Scots enabled him to march in triumph
upon Edinburgh in 1482. The sudden death of his brother called Richard at once to the front.
Worn with excesses, though little more than forty years old, Edward died in the spring of 1483,
and his son Edward the Fifth succeeded peacefully to the throne. The succession of a boy of
thirteen woke again the fierce rivalries of the court. The Woodvilles had the young king in
their hands; but Lord Hastings, the chief adviser of his father, at once joined with Gloucester
and the Duke of Buckingham, the heir of Edward the Third's youngest son and one of the greatest
nobles of the realm, to overthrow them. The efforts of the queen-mother to obtain the regency
were foiled, Lord Rivers and two Woodvilles were seized and sent to the block, and the king
transferred to the charge of Richard, who was proclaimed by a great council of bishops and
nobles Protector of the Realm. But if he hated the queen's kindred Hastings was as loyal as
the Woodvilles themselves to the children of Edward the Fourth; and the next step of the two
Dukes was to remove this obstacle. Little more than a month had passed after the overthrow
of the Woodvilles when Richard suddenly entered the Council-chamber and charged Hastings with
sorcery and attempts upon his life. As he dashed his hand upon the table the room filled with
soldiery. "I will not dine," said the Duke, turning to the minister, "till they have brought
me your head." Hastings was hurried to execution in the courtyard of the Tower, his fellow-counsellors
thrown into prison, and the last check on Richard's ambition was removed. Buckingham lent him
his aid in a claim of the crown; and on the twenty-fifth of June the Duke consented after some
show of reluctance to listen to the prayer of a Parliament hastily gathered together, which,
setting aside Edward's children as the fruit of an unlawful marriage and those of Clarence
as disabled by his attainder, besought him to take the office and title of king.

[Sidenote: Henry Tudor]

Violent as his acts had been, Richard's career had as yet jarred little with popular sentiment.
The Woodvilles were unpopular, Hastings was detested as the agent of Edward's despotism, the
reign of a child-king was generally deemed impossible. The country, longing only for peace
after all its storms, called for a vigorous and active ruler; and Richard's vigour and ability
were seen in his encounter with the first danger that threatened his throne. The new revolution
had again roused the hopes of the Lancastrian party. With the deaths of Henry the Sixth and
his son all the descendants of Henry the Fourth passed away; but the line of John of Gaunt
still survived in the heir of the Beauforts. The legality of the royal act which barred their
claim to the crown was a more than questionable one; the Beauforts had never admitted it, and
the conduct of Henry the Sixth in his earlier years points to a belief in their right of succession.
Their male line was extinguished by the fall of the last Duke of Somerset at Tewkesbury, but
the claim of the house was still maintained by the son of Margaret Beaufort, the daughter of
Duke John and great-grand-daughter of John of Gaunt. While still but a girl Margaret had become
both wife and mother. She had wedded the Earl of Richmond, Edmund Tudor, a son of Henry the
Fifth's widow, Katharine of France, by a marriage with a Welsh squire, Owen Tudor; and had
given birth to a son, the later Henry the Seventh. From very childhood the life of Henry had
been a troubled one. His father died in the year of his birth; his uncle and guardian, Jasper,
Earl of Pembroke, was driven from the realm on the fall of the House of Lancaster; and the
boy himself, attainted at five years old, remained a prisoner till the restoration of Henry
the Sixth by Lord Warwick. But Edward's fresh success drove him from the realm, and escaping
to Britanny he was held there, half-guest, half-prisoner, by its Duke. The extinction of the
direct Lancastrian line had given Henry a new importance. Edward the Fourth never ceased to
strive for his surrender, and if the Breton Duke refused to give him up, his alliance with
the English king was too valuable to be imperilled by suffering him to go free. The value of
such a check on Richard was seen by Lewis of France; and his demands for Henry's surrender
into his hands drove the Duke of Britanny, who was now influenced by a minister in Richard's
pay, to seek for aid from England. In June the king sent a thousand archers to Britanny; but
the troubles of the Duchy had done more for Henry than Lewis could have done. The nobles rose
against Duke and minister; and in the struggle that followed the young Earl was free to set
sail as he would.

[Sidenote: Richard's reign]

He found unexpected aid in the Duke of Buckingham, whose support had done much to put Richard
on the throne. Though rewarded with numerous grants and the post of Constable, Buckingham's
greed was still unsated; and on the refusal of his demand of the lands belonging to the earldom
of Hereford the Duke lent his ear to the counsels of Margaret Beaufort, who had married his
brother, Henry Stafford, but still remained true to the cause of her boy. Buckingham looked
no doubt to the chance of fooling Yorkist and Lancastrian alike, and of pressing his own claims
to the throne on Richard's fall. But he was in the hands of subtler plotters. Morton, the exiled
Bishop of Ely, had founded a scheme of union on the disappearance of Edward the Fifth and his
brother, who had been imprisoned in the Tower since Richard's accession to the throne, and
were now believed to have been murdered by his orders. The death of the boys left their sister
Elizabeth, who had taken sanctuary at Westminster with her mother, the heiress of Edward the
Fourth; and the scheme of Morton was to unite the discontented Yorkists with what remained
of the Lancastrian party by the marriage of Elizabeth with Henry Tudor. The queen-mother and
her kindred gave their consent to this plan, and a wide revolt was organized under Buckingham's
leadership. In October 1483 the Woodvilles and their adherents rose in Wiltshire, Kent, and
Berkshire, the Courtenays in Devon, while Buckingham marched to their support from Wales. Troubles
in Britanny had at this moment freed Henry Tudor, and on the news of the rising he sailed with
a strong fleet and five thousand soldiers on board. A proclamation of the new pretender announced
to the nation what seems as yet to have been carefully hidden, the death of the princes in
the Tower. But, whether the story was believed or no, the duration of the revolt was too short
for it to tell upon public opinion. Henry's fleet was driven back by a storm, Buckingham was
delayed by a flood in the Severn, and the smaller outbreaks were quickly put down. Richard
showed little inclination to deal roughly with the insurgents. Buckingham indeed was beheaded,
but the bulk of his followers were pardoned, and the overthrow of her hopes reconciled the
queen-mother to the king. She quitted the sanctuary with Elizabeth, and thus broke up the league
on which Henry's hopes hung. But Richard was too wary a statesman to trust for safety to mere
force of arms. He resolved to enlist the nation on his side. During his brother's reign he
had watched the upgrowth of public discontent as the new policy of the monarchy developed itself,
and he now appealed to England as the restorer of its ancient liberties. Richard met the appeal
by convoking Parliament in January 1484, and by sweeping measures of reform. The practice of
extorting money by benevolences was declared illegal, while grants of pardons and remissions
of forfeitures reversed in some measure the policy of terror by which Edward at once held the
country in awe and filled his treasury. Numerous statutes broke the slumbers of Parliamentary
legislation. A series of mercantile enactments strove to protect the growing interests of English
commerce. The king's love of literature showed itself in a provision that no statutes should
act as a hindrance "to any artificer or merchant stranger, of what nation or country he be,
for bringing into this realm or selling by retail or otherwise of any manner of books, written
or imprinted." His prohibition of the iniquitous seizure of goods before conviction of felony
which had prevailed during Edward's reign, his liberation of the bondmen who still remained
unenfranchised on the royal domain, and his religious foundations show Richard's keen anxiety
to purchase a popularity in which the bloody opening of his reign might be forgotten.

[Sidenote: Bosworth Field]

It was doubtless the same wish to render his throne popular which led Richard to revive the
schemes of a war with France. He had strongly remonstrated against his brother's withdrawal
and alliance in 1475, and it must have been rather a suspicion of his warlike designs than
any horror at the ruthlessness of his ambition which led Lewis the Eleventh on his death-bed
to refuse to recognize his accession. At the close of Edward the Fourth's reign the alliance
which had bound the two countries together was brought to an end by the ambition and faithlessness
of the French king. The war between Lewis and Maximilian ended at the close of 1482 through
the sudden death of Mary of Burgundy and the reluctance of the Flemish towns to own Maximilian's
authority as guardian of her son, Philip, the heir of the Burgundian states. Lewis was able
to conclude a treaty at Arras, by which Philip's sister, Margaret, was betrothed to the Dauphin
Charles, and brought with her as dower the counties of Artois and Burgundy. By the treaty with
England Charles was already betrothed to Edward's daughter, Elizabeth; and this open breach
of treaty was followed by the cessation of the subsidy which had been punctually paid since
1475. France in fact had no more need of buying English neutrality. Galled as he was, Edward's
death but a few months later hindered any open quarrel, but the refusal of Lewis to recognize
Richard and his attempts to force from Britanny the surrender of Henry Tudor added to the estrangement
of the two courts; and we can hardly wonder that on the death of the French king only a few
months after his accession Richard seized the opportunity which the troubles at the French
court afforded him. Charles the Eighth was a minor; and the control of power was disputed as
of old between the Regent, Anne of Beaujeu, and the Duke of Orleans. Orleans entered into correspondence
with Richard and Maximilian, whom Anne's policy was preventing from gaining the mastery over
the Low Countries, and preparations were making for a coalition which would have again brought
an English army and the young English king on to the soil of France. It was to provide against
this danger that Anne had received Henry Tudor at the French court when the threat of delivering
him up to Richard forced him to quit Britanny after the failure of his first expedition; and
she met the new coalition by encouraging the Earl to renew his attack. Had Richard retained
his popularity the attempt must have ended in a failure even more disastrous than before. But
the news of the royal children's murder had slowly spread through the nation, and even the
most pitiless shrank aghast before this crowning deed of blood. The pretence of a constitutional
rule too was soon thrown off, and in the opening of 1485 a general irritation was caused by
the levy of benevolences in defiance of the statute which had just been passed. The king felt
himself safe; the consent of the queen-mother to his contemplated marriage with her daughter
Elizabeth appeared to secure him against any danger from the discontented Yorkists; and Henry,
alone and in exile, seemed a small danger. Henry however had no sooner landed at Milford Haven
than a wide conspiracy revealed itself. Lord Stanley had as yet stood foremost among Richard's
adherents; he had supported him in the rising of 1483 and had been rewarded with Buckingham's
post of Constable. His brother too stood high in the king's confidence. But Margaret Beaufort,
again left a widow, wedded Lord Stanley; and turned her third marriage, as she had turned her
second, to the profit of her boy. A pledge of support from her husband explains the haste with
which Henry pressed forward to his encounter with the king. The treason however was skilfully
veiled; and though defection after defection warned Richard of his danger as Henry moved against
him, the Stanleys still remained by his side and held command of a large body of his forces.
But the armies no sooner met on the twenty-second of August at Bosworth Field in Leicestershire
than their treason was declared. The forces under Lord Stanley abandoned the king when the
battle began; a second body of troops under the Earl of Northumberland drew off as it opened.
In the crisis of the fight Sir William Stanley passed over to Henry's side. With a cry of "Treason!
treason!" Richard flung himself into the thick of the battle, and in the fury of his despair
he had already dashed the Lancastrian standard to the ground and hewed his way into the presence
of his rival when he fell overpowered with numbers, and the crown which he had worn and which
was found as the struggle ended lying near a hawthorn bush was placed on the head of the conqueror.

CHAPTER II THE REVIVAL OF LEARNING 1485-1514

[Sidenote: Henry the Seventh]

Still young, for he was hardly thirty when his victory at Bosworth placed him on the throne,
the temper of Henry the Seventh seemed to promise the reign of a poetic dreamer rather than
of a statesman. The spare form, the sallow face, the quick eye, lit now and then with a fire
that told of his Celtic blood, the shy, solitary humour which was only broken by outbursts
of pleasant converse or genial sarcasm, told of an inner concentration and enthusiasm; and
to the last Henry's mind remained imaginative and adventurous. He dreamed of crusades, he dwelt
with delight on the legends of Arthur which Caxton gave to the world in the year of his accession.
His tastes were literary and artistic. He called foreign scholars to his court to serve as
secretaries and historiographers; he trained his children in the highest culture of their day;
he was a patron of the new printing press, a lover of books and of art. The chapel at Westminster
which bears his name reflects his passion for architecture. But life gave Henry little leisure
for dreams or culture. From the first he had to struggle for very existence against the dangers
that beset him. A battle and treason had given him the throne; treason and a battle might dash
him from it. His claim of blood was an uncertain and disputable one even by men of his own
party. He stood attainted by solemn Act of Parliament; and though the judges ruled that the
possession of the crown cleared all attaint the stigma and peril remained. His victory had
been a surprise; he could not trust the nobles; of fifty-two peers he dared summon only a part
to the Parliament which assembled after his coronation and gave its recognition to his claim
of the crown. The Act made no mention of hereditary right, or of any right by conquest, but
simply declared "that the inheritance of the crown should be, rest, remain, and abide in the
most royal person of their sovereign Lord, King Henry the Seventh, and the heirs of his body
lawfully ensuing." Such a declaration gave Henry a true Parliamentary title to his throne;
and his consciousness of this was shown in a second Act which assumed him to have been king
since the death of Henry the Sixth and attainted Richard and his adherents as rebels and traitors.
But such an Act was too manifestly unjust to give real strength to his throne; it was in fact
practically undone in 1495 when a new statute declared that no one should henceforth be attainted
for serving a de facto king; and so insecure seemed Henry's title that no power acknowledged
him as king save France and the Pope, and the support of France--gained as men believed by
a pledge to abandon the English claims on Normandy and Guienne--was as perilous at home as
it was useful abroad.

[Sidenote: Revolt of Simnel]

It was in vain that he carried out his promise to Morton and the Woodvilles by marrying Elizabeth
of York; he had significantly delayed the marriage till he was owned as king in his own right,
and a purely Lancastrian claim to the throne roused wrath in every Yorkist which no after match
could allay. During the early years of his reign the country was troubled with local insurrections,
some so obscure that they have escaped the notice of our chroniclers, some, like that of Lovel
and of the Staffords, general and formidable. The turmoil within was quickened by encouragement
from without. The Yorkist sympathies of the Earl of Kildare, the deputy of Ireland, offered
a starting-point for a descent from the west; while the sister of Edward the Fourth, the Duchess
Margaret of Burgundy, a fanatic in the cause of her house, was ready to aid any Yorkist attempt
from Flanders. A trivial rising in 1486 proved to be the prelude of a vast conspiracy in the
following year. The Earl of Warwick, the son of the Duke of Clarence and thus next male heir
of the Yorkist line, had been secured by Henry as by Richard in the Tower; but in the opening
of 1487 Lambert Simnel, a boy carefully trained for the purpose of this imposture, landed under
his name in Ireland. The whole island espoused Simnel's cause, the Lord Deputy supported him,
and he was soon joined by the Earl of Lincoln, John de la Pole, the son of a sister of Edward
the Fourth by the Duke of Suffolk, and who on the death of Richard's son had been recognized
by that sovereign as his heir. Edward's queen and the Woodvilles seem to have joined in the
plot, and Margaret sent troops which enabled the pretender to land in Lancashire. But Henry
was quick to meet the danger, and the impostor's defeat at Stoke near Newark proved fatal to
the hopes of the Yorkists. Simnel was taken and made a scullion in the king's kitchen, Lincoln
fell on the field.

[Sidenote: Henry's Government]

The victory of Stoke set Henry free to turn to the inner government of his realm. He took up
with a new vigour and fulness the policy of Edward the Fourth. Parliament was only summoned
on rare and critical occasions. It was but twice convened during the last thirteen years of
Henry's reign. The chief aim of the king was the accumulation of a treasure which should relieve
him from the need of ever appealing for its aid. Subsidies granted for the support of wars
which Henry evaded formed the base of a royal treasure which was swelled by the revival of
dormant claims of the crown, by the exaction of fines for the breach of forgotten tenures,
and by a host of petty extortions. Benevolences were again revived. A dilemma of Henry's minister,
which received the name of "Morton's fork," extorted gifts to the exchequer from men who lived
handsomely on the ground that their wealth was manifest, and from those who lived plainly on
the plea that economy had made them wealthy. Still greater sums were drawn from those who were
compromised in the revolts which chequered the king's rule. It was with his own hand that Henry
endorsed the rolls of fines imposed after every insurrection. So successful were these efforts
that at the end of his reign the king bequeathed a hoard of two millions to his successor.
The same imitation of Edward's policy was seen in Henry's civil government. Broken as was the
strength of the baronage, there still remained lords whom the new monarch watched with a jealous
solicitude. Their power lay in the hosts of disorderly retainers who swarmed round their houses,
ready to furnish a force in case of revolt, while in peace they became centres of outrage and
defiance to the law. Edward had ordered the dissolution of these military households in his
Statute of Liveries, and the statute was enforced by Henry with the utmost severity. On a visit
to the Earl of Oxford, one of the most devoted adherents of the Lancastrian cause, the king
found two long lines of liveried retainers drawn up to receive him. "I thank you for your good
cheer, my Lord," said Henry as they parted, "but I may not endure to have my laws broken in
my sight. My attorney must speak with you." The Earl was glad to escape with a fine of £10,000.
It was with a special view to the suppression of this danger that Henry employed the criminal
jurisdiction of the royal Council. The king in his Council had always asserted a right in the
last resort to enforce justice and peace by dealing with offenders too strong to be dealt with
by his ordinary courts. Henry systematized this occasional jurisdiction by appointing in 1486
a committee of his Council as a regular court, to which the place where it usually sat gave
the name of the Court of Star Chamber. The king's aim was probably little more than a purpose
to enforce order on the land by bringing the great nobles before his own judgement-seat; but
the establishment of the court as a regular and no longer an exceptional tribunal, whose traditional
powers were confirmed by Parliamentary statute, and where the absence of a jury cancelled the
prisoner's right to be tried by his peers, furnished his son with an instrument of tyranny
which laid justice at the feet of the monarchy.

[Sidenote: War of Britanny]

In his foreign policy Henry like Edward clung to a system of peace. His aim was to keep England
apart, independent of the two great continental powers which during the Wars of the Roses had
made revolutions at their will. Peace indeed was what Henry needed, whether for the general
welfare of the land, or for the building up of his own system of rule. Peace however was hard
to win. The old quarrel with France seemed indeed at an end; for it was Henry's pledge of friendship
which had bought the French aid that enabled him to mount the throne. But in England itself
hatred of the French burned fiercely as ever; and the growth of the French monarchy in extent
and power through the policy of Lewis the Eleventh, his extinction of the great feudatories,
and the administrative centralization he introduced, made even the coolest English statesman
look on it as a danger to the realm. Only Britanny broke the long stretch of French coast which
fronted England; and the steady refusal of Edward the Fourth to suffer Lewis to attack the
Duchy showed the English sense of its value. Under its new king however, Charles the Eighth,
France showed her purpose of annexing Britanny. Henry contented himself for a while with sending
a few volunteers to aid in resistance; but when the death of the Duke left Britanny and its
heiress, Anne, at the mercy of the French king the country called at once for war. Henry was
driven to find allies in the states which equally dreaded the French advance, in the house
of Austria and in the new power of Spain, to call on Parliament for supplies, and to cross
the Channel in 1492 with twenty-five thousand men. But his allies failed him; a marriage of
Charles with Anne gave the Duchy irretrievably to the French king; and troubles at home brought
Henry to listen to terms of peace on payment of a heavy subsidy.

[Sidenote: Henry and Ireland]

Both kings indeed were eager for peace. Charles was anxious to free his hands for the designs
he was forming against Italy. What forced Henry to close the war was the appearance of a new
pretender. At the opening of 1492, at the moment when the king was threatening a descent on
the French coast, a youth calling himself Richard, Duke of York, landed suddenly in Ireland.
His story of an escape from the Tower and of his bringing up in Portugal was accepted by a
crowd of partizans; but he was soon called by Charles to France, and his presence there adroitly
used to wring peace from the English king as the price of his abandonment. At the conclusion
of peace the pretender found a new refuge with Duchess Margaret; his claims were recognized
by the House of Austria and the king of Scots; while Henry, who declared the youth's true name
to be Perkin Warbeck, weakened his cause by conflicting accounts of his origin and history.
Fresh Yorkist plots sprang up in England. The Duchess gathered a fleet, Maximilian sent soldiers
to the young claimant's aid, and in 1495 he sailed for England with a force as large as that
which had followed Henry ten years before. But he found a different England. Though fierce
outbreaks still took place in the north, the country at large had tasted the new sweets of
order and firm government, and that reaction of feeling, that horror of civil wars, which gave
their strength to the Tudors had already begun to show its force. The pretender's troops landed
at Deal only to be seized by the country folk and hanged as pirates. Their leader sailed on
to Ireland. Here too however he found a new state of things. Since the recall of Richard and
his army in 1399 English sovereignty over the island had dwindled to a shadow. For a hundred
years the native chieftains had ruled without check on one side the Pale, and the lords of
the Pale had ruled with but little check on the other. But in 1494 Henry took the country in
hand. Sir Edward Poynings, a tried soldier, was despatched as deputy to Ireland with troops
at his back. English officers, English judges were quietly sent over. The Lords of the Pale
were scared by the seizure of their leader, the Earl of Kildare. The Parliament of the Pale
was bridled by a statute passed at the Deputy's dictation; the famous Poynings Act, by which
it was forbidden to treat of any matters save those first approved of by the English king and
his Council. It was this new Ireland that the pretender found when he appeared off its coast.
He withdrew in despair, and Henry at once set about finishing his work. The time had not yet
come when England was strong enough to hold Ireland by her own strength. For a while the Lords
of the Pale must still serve as the English garrison against the unconquered Irish, and Henry
called his prisoner Kildare to his presence. "All Ireland cannot rule this man," grumbled his
ministers. "Then shall he rule all Ireland," laughed the king, and Kildare returned as Lord
Deputy to hold the country loyally in Henry's name.

[Sidenote: Henry and Scotland]

The same political forecast, winning from very danger the elements of future security, was
seen in the king's dealings with Scotland. From the moment when England finally abandoned the
fruitless effort to subdue it the story of Scotland had been a miserable one. Whatever peace
might be concluded, a sleepless dread of the old danger from the south tied the country to
an alliance with France, and this alliance dragged it into the vortex of the Hundred Years
War. But after the final defeat and capture of David on the field of Neville's Cross the struggle
died down on both sides into marauding forays and battles, like those of Otterburn and Homildon
Hill, in which alternate victories were won by the feudal lords of the Scotch or English border.
The ballad of "Chevy Chase" brings home to us the spirit of the contest, the daring and defiance
which stirred Sidney's heart "like a trumpet." But the effect of the struggle on the internal
developement of Scotland was utterly ruinous. The houses of Douglas and of March which it raised
into supremacy only interrupted their strife with England to battle fiercely with one another
or to coerce their king. The power of the Crown sank in fact into insignificance under the
earlier sovereigns of the line of Stuart which succeeded to the throne on the extinction of
the male line of Bruce in 1371. Invasions and civil feuds not only arrested but even rolled
back the national industry and prosperity. The country was a chaos of disorder and misrule,
in which the peasant and the trader were the victims of feudal outrage. The Border became a
lawless land, where robbery and violence reigned utterly without check. So pitiable seemed
the state of the kingdom that at the opening of the fifteenth century the clans of the Highlands
drew together to swoop upon it as a certain prey; but the common peril united the factions
of the nobles, and the victory of Harlaw saved the Lowlands from the rule of the Celt.

[Sidenote: Margaret Tudor]

A great name at last broke the line of the Scottish kings. Schooled by a long captivity in
England, James the First returned to his realm in 1424 to be the ablest of her rulers as he
was the first of her poets. In the twelve years of a wonderful reign justice and order were
restored for the while, the Scotch Parliament organized, the clans of the Highlands assailed
in their own fastnesses and reduced to swear fealty to the "Saxon" king. James turned to assail
the great houses; but feudal violence was still too strong for the hand of the law, and a band
of ruffians who burst into his chamber left the king lifeless with sixteen stabs in his body.
His death in 1437 was the signal for a struggle between the House of Douglas and the Crown
which lasted through half a century. Order however crept gradually in; the exile of the Douglases
left the Scottish monarchs supreme in the Lowlands; while their dominion over the Highlands
was secured by the ruin of the Lords of the Isles. But in its outer policy the country still
followed in the wake of France; every quarrel between French king and English king brought
danger with it on the Scottish border; and the war of Britanny at once set James the Fourth
among Henry's foes. James welcomed the fugitive pretender at his court after his failure in
Ireland, wedded him to his cousin, and in 1497 marched with him to the south. Not a man however
greeted the Yorkist claimant, the country mustered to fight him; and an outbreak among his
nobles, many of whom Henry had in his pay, called the Scot-king back again. Abandonment of
the pretender was the first provision of peace between the two countries. Forced to quit Scotland
the youth threw himself on the Cornish coast, drawn there by a revolt in June, only two months
before his landing, which had been stirred up by the heavy taxation for the Scotch war, and
in which a force of Cornishmen had actually pushed upon London and only been dispersed by the
king's artillery on Blackheath. His temper however shrank from any real encounter; and though
he succeeded in raising a body of Cornishmen and marched on Taunton, at the approach of the
royal forces he fled from his army, took sanctuary at Beaulieu, and surrendered on promise
of life. But the close of this danger made no break in Henry's policy of winning Scotland to
a new attitude towards his realm. The lure to James was the hand of the English king's daughter,
Margaret Tudor. For five years the negotiations dragged wearily along. The bitter hate of the
two peoples blocked the way, and even Henry's ministers objected that the English crown might
be made by the match the heritage of a Scottish king. "Then," they said, "Scotland will annex
England." "No," said the king with shrewd sense; "in such a case England would annex Scotland,
for the greater always draws to it the less." His steady pressure at last won the day. In 1502
the marriage-treaty with the Scot-king was formally concluded; and quiet, as Henry trusted,
secured in the north.

[Sidenote: The Spanish Marriage]

The marriage of Margaret was to bring the House of Stuart at an after time to the English throne.
But results as momentous and far more immediate followed on the marriage of Henry's sons. From
the outset of his reign Henry had been driven to seek the friendship and alliance of Spain.
Though his policy to the last remained one of peace, yet the acquisition of Britanny forced
him to guard against attack from France and the mastery of the Channel which the possession
of the Breton ports was likely to give to the French fleet. The same dread of French attack
drew Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabel of Castile, whose marriage was building up the new monarchy
of Spain, to the side of the English king; and only a few years after his accession they offered
the hand of their daughter Catharine for his eldest son. But the invasion of Italy by Charles
the Eighth drew French ambition to a distant strife, and once delivered from the pressure of
immediate danger Henry held warily back from a close connexion with the Spanish realms which
might have involved him in continental wars. It was not till 1501 that the marriage-treaty
was really carried out. The Low Countries had now passed to the son of Mary of Burgundy by
her husband Maximilian, the Austrian Archduke Philip. The Yorkist sympathies of the Duchess
Margaret were shared by Philip, and Flanders had till now been the starting-point of the pretenders
who had threatened Henry's crown. But Philip's marriage with Juana, the daughter of Ferdinand
and Isabel, bound him to the cause of Spain, and it was to secure his throne by winning Philip's
alliance, as well as to gain in the friendship of the Low Countries a fresh check upon French
attack, that Henry yielded to Ferdinand's renewed demand for the union of Arthur and Catharine.
The match was made in blood. Henry's own temper was merciful and even generous; he punished
rebellion for the most part by fines rather than bloodshed, and he had been content to imprison
or degrade his rivals. But the Spanish ruthlessness would see no living claimant left to endanger
Catharine's throne, and Perkin Warbeck and the Earl of Warwick were put to death on a charge
of conspiracy before the landing of the bride.

Catharine however was widow almost as soon as wife, for only three months after his wedding
Arthur sickened and died. But a contest with France for Southern Italy, which Ferdinand claimed
as king of Aragon, now made the friendship of England more precious than ever to the Spanish
sovereigns; and Isabel pressed for her daughter's union with the king's second son, Henry,
whom his brother's death left heir to the throne. In his anxiety to avoid a breach with Spain
the king suffered Henry to be betrothed to Catharine, and threw the burthen of decision on
Rome. A dispensation was necessary, and the case was of course the more difficult if the first
marriage had been completed. The pleadings were put in, though both Julius the Second and Henry
were in no haste for a decision. But the victories of Spain in Southern Italy enabled Isabel
to put fresh pressure on the Pope, and on a denial being given of the consummation of the earlier
marriage Julius was brought to sign a bull legitimating, even in case of such a consummation,
the later one. Henry however still shrank from any real union. His aim was neither to complete
the marriage, which would have alienated France, nor to wholly break it off and so alienate
Spain. A balanced position between the two battling powers allowed him to remain at peace,
to maintain an independent policy, and to pursue his system of home-government. He guarded
his son's interests therefore by suggesting that he should enter a secret protest against the
validity of his betrothal; and Catharine remained through the later years of his reign at the
English court betrothed but unmarried, sick with love-longing and baffled pride.

[Sidenote: The Renascence]

But great as were the issues of Henry's policy, it shrinks into littleness if we turn from
it to the weighty movements which were now stirring the minds of men. The world was passing
through changes more momentous than any it had witnessed since the victory of Christianity
and the fall of the Roman Empire. Its physical bounds were suddenly enlarged. The discoveries
of Copernicus revealed to man the secret of the universe. Portuguese mariners doubled the Cape
of Good Hope and anchored their merchant fleets in the harbours of India. Columbus crossed
the untraversed ocean to add a New World to the Old. Sebastian Cabot, starting from the port
of Bristol, threaded his way among the icebergs of Labrador. This sudden contact with new lands,
new faiths, new races of men quickened the slumbering intelligence of Europe into a strange
curiosity. The first book of voyages that told of the Western World, the travels of Amerigo
Vespucci, was soon "in everybody's hands." The "Utopia" of More, in its wide range of speculation
on every subject of human thought and action, tells us how roughly and utterly the narrowness
and limitation of human life had been broken up. At the very hour when the intellectual energy
of the Middle Ages had sunk into exhaustion the capture of Constantinople by the Turks and
the flight of its Greek scholars to the shores of Italy opened anew the science and literature
of an older world. The exiled Greek scholars were welcomed in Italy; and Florence, so long
the home of freedom and of art, became the home of an intellectual Revival. The poetry of Homer,
the drama of Sophocles, the philosophy of Aristotle and of Plato woke again to life beneath
the shadow of the mighty dome with which Brunelleschi had just crowned the City by the Arno.
All the restless energy which Florence had so long thrown into the cause of liberty she flung,
now that her liberty was reft from her, into the cause of letters. The galleys of her merchants
brought back manuscripts from the East as the most precious portion of their freight. In the
palaces of her nobles fragments of classic sculpture ranged themselves beneath the frescoes
of Ghirlandajo. The recovery of a treatise of Cicero's or a tract of Sallust's from the dust
of a monastic library was welcomed by the group of statesmen and artists who gathered in the
Rucellai gardens with a thrill of enthusiasm. Foreign scholars soon flocked over the Alps to
learn Greek, the key of the new knowledge, from the Florentine teachers. Grocyn, a fellow of
New College, was perhaps the first Englishman who studied under the Greek exile, Chalcondylas;
and the Greek lectures which he delivered in Oxford on his return in 1491 mark the opening
of a new period in our history. Physical as well as literary activity awoke with the rediscovery
of the teachers of Greece; and the continuous progress of English science may be dated from
the day when Linacre, another Oxford student, returned from the lectures of the Florentine
Politian to revive the older tradition of medicine by his translation of Galen.

[Sidenote: John Colet]

But from the first it was manifest that the revival of letters would take a tone in England
very different from the tone it had taken in Italy, a tone less literary, less largely human,
but more moral, more religious, more practical in its bearings both upon society and politics.
The awakening of a rational Christianity, whether in England or in the Teutonic world at large,
begins with the Italian studies of John Colet; and the vigour and earnestness of Colet were
the best proof of the strength with which the new movement was to affect English religion.
He came back to Oxford utterly untouched by the Platonic mysticism or the semi-serious infidelity
which characterized the group of scholars round Lorenzo the Magnificent. He was hardly more
influenced by their literary enthusiasm. The knowledge of Greek seems to have had one almost
exclusive end for him, and this was a religious end. Greek was the key by which he could unlock
the Gospels and the New Testament, and in these he thought that he could find a new religious
standing-ground. It was this resolve of Colet to throw aside the traditional dogmas of his
day and to discover a rational and practical religion in the Gospels themselves which gave
its peculiar stamp to the theology of the Renascence. His faith stood simply on a vivid realization
of the person of Christ. In the prominence which such a view gave to the moral life, in his
free criticism of the earlier Scriptures, in his tendency to simple forms of doctrine and confessions
of faith, Colet struck the keynote of a mode of religious thought as strongly in contrast with
that of the later Reformation as with that of Catholicism itself. The allegorical and mystical
theology on which the Middle Ages had spent their intellectual vigour to such little purpose
fell before his rejection of all but the historical and grammatical sense of the Biblical text.
In his lectures on the Romans we find hardly a single quotation from the Fathers or the scholastic
teachers. The great fabric of belief built up by the mediæval doctors seemed to him simply
"the corruptions of the Schoolmen." In the life and sayings of its Founder he saw a simple
and rational Christianity, whose fittest expression was the Apostles' creed. "About the rest,"
he said with characteristic impatience, "let divines dispute as they will." Of his attitude
towards the coarser aspects of the current religion his behaviour at a later time before the
famous shrine of St. Thomas at Canterbury gives us a rough indication. As the blaze of its
jewels, its costly sculptures, its elaborate metal-work burst on Colet's view, he suggested
with bitter irony that a saint so lavish to the poor in his lifetime would certainly prefer
that they should possess the wealth heaped round him since his death. With petulant disgust
he rejected the rags of the martyr which were offered for his adoration and the shoe which
was offered for his kiss. The earnestness, the religious zeal, the very impatience and want
of sympathy with the past which we see in every word and act of the man burst out in the lectures
on St. Paul's Epistles which he delivered at Oxford in 1497. Even to the most critical among
his hearers he seemed "like one inspired, raised in voice, eye, his whole countenance and mien,
out of himself."

[Sidenote: Erasmus]

Severe as was the outer life of the new teacher, a severity marked by his plain black robe
and the frugal table which he preserved amidst his later dignities, his lively conversation,
his frank simplicity, the purity and nobleness of his life, even the keen outbursts of his
troublesome temper, endeared him to a group of scholars, foremost among whom stood Erasmus
and Thomas More. "Greece has crossed the Alps," cried the exiled Argyropulos on hearing a translation
of Thucydides by the German Reuchlin; but the glory, whether of Reuchlin or of the Teutonic
scholars who followed him, was soon eclipsed by that of Erasmus. His enormous industry, the
vast store of classical learning which he gradually accumulated, Erasmus shared with others
of his day. In patristic study he may have stood beneath Luther; in originality and profoundness
of thought he was certainly inferior to More. His theology, though he made a greater mark on
the world by it than even by his scholarship, he derived almost without change from Colet.
But his combination of vast learning with keen observation, of acuteness of remark with a lively
fancy, of genial wit with a perfect good sense--his union of as sincere a piety and as profound
a zeal for rational religion as Colet's with a dispassionate fairness towards older faiths,
a large love of secular culture, and a genial freedom and play of mind--this union was his
own, and it was through this that Erasmus embodied for the Teutonic peoples the quickening
influence of the New Learning during the long scholar-life which began at Paris and ended amidst
sorrow and darkness at Basle. At the time of Colet's return from Italy Erasmus was young and
comparatively unknown, but the chivalrous enthusiasm of the new movement breaks out in his
letters from Paris, whither he had wandered as a scholar. "I have given up my whole soul to
Greek learning," he writes, "and as soon as I get any money I shall buy Greek books--and then
I shall buy some clothes." It was in despair of reaching Italy that the young scholar made
his way in 1498 to Oxford, as the one place on this side the Alps where he would be enabled
through the teaching of Grocyn to acquire a knowledge of Greek. But he had no sooner arrived
there than all feeling of regret vanished away. "I have found in Oxford," he writes, "so much
polish and learning that now I hardly care about going to Italy at all, save for the sake of
having been there. When I listen to my friend Colet it seems like listening to Plato himself.
Who does not wonder at the wide range of Grocyn's knowledge? What can be more searching, deep,
and refined than the judgement of Linacre? When did Nature mould a temper more gentle, endearing,
and happy than the temper of Thomas More?"

[Sidenote: Revival of Letters]

But the new movement was far from being bounded by the walls of Oxford. The printing press
was making letters the common property of all. In the last thirty years of the fifteenth century
ten thousand editions of books and pamphlets are said to have been published throughout Europe,
the most important half of them of course in Italy. All the Latin authors were accessible to
every student before the century closed. Almost all the more valuable authors of Greece were
published in the twenty years that followed. The profound influence of this burst of the two
great classic literatures on the world at once made itself felt. "For the first time," to use
the picturesque phrase of M. Taine, "men opened their eyes and saw." The human mind seemed
to gather new energies at the sight of the vast field which opened before it. It attacked every
province of knowledge, and in a few years it transformed all. Experimental science, the science
of philology, the science of politics, the critical investigation of religious truth, all took
their origin from this Renascence--this "New Birth" of the world. Art, if it lost much in purity
and propriety, gained in scope and in the fearlessness of its love of Nature. Literature, if
crushed for the moment by the overpowering attraction of the great models of Greece and Rome,
revived with a grandeur of form, a large spirit of humanity, such as it has never known since
their day. In England the influence of the new movement extended far beyond the little group
in which it had a few years before seemed concentrated. The great churchmen became its patrons.
Langton, Bishop of Winchester, took delight in examining the young scholars of his episcopal
family every evening, and sent all the most promising of them to study across the Alps. Learning
found a yet warmer friend in the Archbishop of Canterbury.

[Sidenote: Warham]

Immersed as Archbishop Warham was in the business of the state, he was no mere politician.
The eulogies which Erasmus lavished on him while he lived, his praises of the Primate's learning,
of his ability in business, his pleasant humour, his modesty, his fidelity to friends, may
pass for what eulogies of living men are commonly worth. But it is difficult to doubt the sincerity
of the glowing picture which he drew of him when death had destroyed all interest in mere adulation.
The letters indeed which passed between the great churchman and the wandering scholar, the
quiet, simple-hearted grace which amidst constant instances of munificence preserved the perfect
equality of literary friendship, the enlightened piety to which Erasmus could address the noble
words of his preface to St. Jerome, confirm the judgement of every good man of Warham's day.
The Archbishop's life was a simple one; and an hour's pleasant reading, a quiet chat with some
learned new-comer, alone broke the endless round of civil and ecclesiastical business. His
favourite relaxation was to sup among a group of scholarly visitors, enjoying their fun and
retorting with fun of his own. Colet, who had now become Dean of St. Paul's and whose sermons
were stirring all London, might often be seen with Grocyn and Linacre at the Primate's board.
There too might probably have been seen Thomas More, who, young as he was, was already famous
through his lectures at St. Lawrence on "The City of God." But the scholar-world found more
than supper or fun at the Primate's board. His purse was ever open to relieve their poverty.
"Had I found such a patron in my youth," Erasmus wrote long after, "I too might have been counted
among the fortunate ones." It was with Grocyn that Erasmus on a second visit to England rowed
up the river to Warham's board at Lambeth, and in spite of an unpromising beginning the acquaintance
turned out wonderfully well. The Primate loved him, Erasmus wrote home, as if he were his father
or his brother, and his generosity surpassed that of all his friends. He offered him a sinecure,
and when he declined it he bestowed on him a pension of a hundred crowns a year. When Erasmus
wandered to Paris it was Warham's invitation which recalled him to England. When the rest of
his patrons left him to starve on the sour beer of Cambridge it was Warham who sent him fifty
angels. "I wish there were thirty legions of them," the Primate puns in his good-humoured way.

[Sidenote: Henry the Eighth]

Real however as this progress was, the group of scholars who represented the New Learning in
England still remained a little one through the reign of Henry the Seventh. But the king's
death in 1509 wholly changed their position. A "New Order," to use their own enthusiastic phrase,
dawned on them in the accession of his son. Henry the Eighth had hardly completed his eighteenth
year when he mounted the throne; but his manly beauty, his bodily vigour, and skill in arms,
seemed matched by a frank and generous temper and a nobleness of political aims. Pole, his
bitterest enemy, owned in later days that at the beginning of his reign Henry's nature was
one "from which all excellent things might have been hoped." Already in stature and strength
a king among his fellows, taller than any, bigger than any, a mighty wrestler, a mighty hunter,
an archer of the best, a knight who bore down rider after rider in the tourney, the young monarch
combined with this bodily lordliness a largeness and versatility of mind which was to be the
special characteristic of the age that had begun. His fine voice, his love of music, his skill
on lute or organ, the taste for poetry that made him delight in Surrey's verse, the taste for
art which made him delight in Holbein's canvas, left room for tendencies of a more practical
sort, for dabbling in medicine, or for a real skill in shipbuilding. There was a popular fibre
in Henry's nature which made him seek throughout his reign the love of his people; and at its
outset he gave promise of a more popular system of government by checking the extortion which
had been practised under colour of enforcing forgotten laws, and by bringing his father's financial
ministers, Empson and Dudley, to trial on a charge of treason. His sympathies were known to
be heartily with the New Learning; he was a clever linguist, he had a taste that never left
him for theological study, he was a fair scholar. Even as a boy of nine he had roused by his
wit and attainments the wonder of Erasmus, and now that he mounted the throne the great scholar
hurried back to England to pour out his exultation in the "Praise of Folly," a song of triumph
over the old world of ignorance and bigotry that was to vanish away before the light and knowledge
of the new reign. Folly in his amusing little book mounts a pulpit in cap and bells, and pelts
with her satire the absurdities of the world around her, the superstition of the monk, the
pedantry of the grammarian, the dogmatism of the doctors, of the schools, the selfishness and
tyranny of kings.

[Sidenote: Colet's School]

The irony of Erasmus was backed by the earnest effort of Colet. He seized the opportunity to
commence the work of educational reform by devoting in 1510 his private fortune to the foundation
of a Grammar School beside St. Paul's. The bent of its founder's mind was shown by the image
of the Child Jesus over the master's chair with the words "Hear ye Him" graven beneath it.
"Lift up your little white hands for me," wrote the Dean to his scholars in words which prove
the tenderness that lay beneath the stern outer seeming of the man,--"for me which prayeth
for you to God." All the educational designs of the reformers were carried out in the new foundation.
The old methods of instruction were superseded by fresh grammars composed by Erasmus and other
scholars for its use. Lilly, an Oxford student who had studied Greek in the East, was placed
at its head. The injunctions of the founder aimed at the union of rational religion with sound
learning, at the exclusion of the scholastic logic, and at the steady diffusion of the two
classical literatures. The more bigoted of the clergy were quick to take alarm. "No wonder,"
More wrote to the Dean, "your school raises a storm, for it is like the wooden horse in which
armed Greeks were hidden for the ruin of barbarous Troy." But the cry of alarm passed helplessly
away. Not only did the study of Greek creep gradually into the schools which existed, but the
example of Colet was followed by a crowd of imitators. More grammar schools, it has been said,
were founded in the latter years of Henry than in the three centuries before. The impulse only
grew the stronger as the direct influence of the New Learning passed away. The grammar schools
of Edward the Sixth and of Elizabeth, in a word the system of middle-class education which
by the close of the century had changed the very face of England, were the outcome of Colet's
foundation of St. Paul's.

[Sidenote: The Universities]

But the "armed Greeks" of More's apologue found a yet wider field in the reform of the higher
education of the country. On the Universities the influence of the New Learning was like a
passing from death to life. Erasmus gives us a picture of what happened in 1516 at Cambridge
where he was himself for a time a teacher of Greek. "Scarcely thirty years ago nothing was
taught here but the Parva Logicalia, Alexander, those antiquated exercises from Aristotle,
and the Quæstiones of Scotus. As time went on better studies were added, mathematics, a new,
or at any rate a renovated, Aristotle, and a knowledge of Greek literature. What has been the
result? The University is now so flourishing that it can compete with the best universities
of the age." William Latimer and Croke returned from Italy and carried on the work of Erasmus
at Cambridge, where Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, himself one of the foremost scholars of the
new movement, lent it his powerful support. At Oxford the Revival met with a fiercer opposition.
The contest took the form of boyish frays, in which the youthful partizans and opponents of
the New Learning took sides as Greeks and Trojans. The young king himself had to summon one
of its fiercest enemies to Woodstock, and to impose silence on the tirades which were delivered
from the University pulpit. The preacher alleged that he was carried away by the Spirit. "Yes,"
retorted the king, "by the spirit, not of wisdom, but of folly." But even at Oxford the contest
was soon at an end. Fox, Bishop of Winchester, established the first Greek lecture there in
his new college of Corpus Christi, and a Professorship of Greek was at a later time established
by the Crown. "The students," wrote an eye-witness in 1520, "rush to Greek letters, they endure
watching, fasting, toil, and hunger in the pursuit of them." The work was crowned at last by
the munificent foundation of Cardinal College, to share in whose teaching Wolsey invited the
most eminent of the living scholars of Europe, and for whose library he promised to obtain
copies of all the manuscripts in the Vatican.

[Sidenote: Church Reform]

From the reform of education the New Learning pressed on to the reform of the Church. It was
by Warham's commission that Colet was enabled in 1512 to address the Convocation of the Clergy
in words which set before them with unsparing severity the religious ideal of the new movement.
"Would that for once," burst forth the fiery preacher, "you would remember your name and profession
and take thought for the reformation of the Church! Never was it more necessary, and never
did the state of the Church need more vigorous endeavours." "We are troubled with heretics,"
he went on, "but no heresy of theirs is so fatal to us and to the people at large as the vicious
and depraved lives of the clergy. That is the worst heresy of all." It was the reform of the
bishops that must precede that of the clergy, the reform of the clergy that would lead to a
general revival of religion in the people at large. The accumulation of benefices, the luxury
and worldliness of the priesthood, must be abandoned. The prelates ought to be busy preachers,
to forsake the Court and labour in their own dioceses. Care should be taken for the ordination
and promotion of worthy ministers, residence should be enforced, the low standard of clerical
morality should be raised. It is plain that the men of the New Learning looked forward, not
to a reform of doctrine but to a reform of life, not to a revolution which should sweep away
the older superstitions which they despised but to a regeneration of spiritual feeling before
which these superstitions would inevitably fade away. Colet was soon charged with heresy by
the Bishop of London. Warham however protected him, and Henry to whom the Dean was denounced
bade him go boldly on. "Let every man have his own doctor," said the young king after a long
interview, "but this man is the doctor for me!"

[Sidenote: Henry's Temper]

But for the success of the new reform, a reform which could only be wrought out by the tranquil
spread of knowledge and the gradual enlightenment of the human conscience, the one thing needful
was peace; and peace was already vanishing away. Splendid as were the gifts with which Nature
had endowed Henry the Eighth, there lay beneath them all a boundless selfishness. It was this
personal will and appetite that was in Henry the Eighth to shape the very course of English
history, to override the highest interests of the state, to trample under foot the wisest counsels,
to crush with the blind ingratitude of fate the servants who opposed it. Even Wolsey, while
he recoiled from the monstrous form which had revealed itself, could hardly have dreamed of
the work which that royal courage and yet more royal appetite was to accomplish in the years
to come. As yet however Henry was far from having reached the height of self-assertion which
bowed all constitutional law and even the religion of his realm beneath his personal will.
But one of the earliest acts of his reign gave an earnest of the part which the new strength
of the crown was to enable an English king to play. Through the later years of Henry the Seventh
Catharine of Aragon had been recognized at the English court simply as Arthur's widow and Princess
Dowager of Wales. Her betrothal to Prince Henry was looked upon as cancelled by his protest,
and though the king was cautious not to break openly with Spain by sending her home, he was
resolute not to suffer a marriage which would bring a break with France and give Ferdinand
an opportunity of dragging England into the strife between the two great powers of the west.

[Sidenote: France]

But with the young king's accession this policy of cautious isolation was at once put aside.
There were grave political reasons indeed for the quick resolve which bore down the opposition
of counsellors like Warham. As cool a head as that of Henry the Seventh was needed to watch
without panic the rapid march of French greatness. In mere extent France had grown with a startling
rapidity since the close of her long strife with England. Guienne had fallen to Charles the
Seventh. Provence, Roussillon, and the Duchy of Burgundy had successively swelled the realm
of Lewis the Eleventh. Britanny had been added to that of Charles the Eighth. From Calais to
Bayonne, from the Jura to the Channel, stretched a wide and highly organized realm, whose disciplined
army and unrivalled artillery lifted it high above its neighbours in force of war. The efficiency
of its army was seen in the sudden invasion and conquest of Italy while England was busy with
the pretended Duke of York. The passage of the Alps by Charles the Eighth shook the whole political
structure of Europe. In wealth, in political repute, in arms, in letters, in arts, Italy at
this moment stood foremost among the peoples of Western Christendom, and the mastery which
Charles won over it at a single blow lifted France at once above the states around her. Twice
repulsed from Naples, she remained under the successor of Charles, Lewis the Twelfth, mistress
of the Duchy of Milan and of the bulk of Northern Italy; the princes and republics of Central
Italy grouped themselves about her; and at the close of Henry the Seventh's reign the ruin
of Venice in the League of Cambray crushed the last Italian state which could oppose her designs
on the whole peninsula. It was this new and mighty power, a France that stretched from the
Atlantic to the Mincio, that fronted the young king at his accession and startled him from
his father's attitude of isolation. He sought Ferdinand's alliance none the less that it meant
war, for his temper was haughty and adventurous, his pride dwelt on the older claims of England
to Normandy and Guienne, and his devotion to the Papacy drew him to listen to the cry of Julius
the Second, and to long like a crusader to free Rome from the French pressure. Nor was it of
less moment to a will such as the young king's that Catharine's passionate love for him had
roused as ardent a love in return.

[Sidenote: Ferdinand of Aragon]

Two months therefore after his accession the Infanta became the wife of Henry the Eighth. The
influence of the king of Aragon became all-powerful in the English council chamber. Catharine
spoke of her husband and herself as Ferdinand's subjects. The young king wrote that he would
obey Ferdinand as he had obeyed his own father. His obedience was soon to be tested. Ferdinand
seized on his new ally as a pawn in the great game which he was playing on the European chess-board,
a game which left its traces on the political and religious map of Europe for centuries after
him. It was not without good ground that Henry the Seventh faced so coolly the menacing growth
of France. He saw what his son failed to see, that the cool, wary king of Aragon was building
up as quickly a power which was great enough to cope with it, and that grow as the two rivals
might they were matched too evenly to render England's position a really dangerous one. While
the French kings aimed at the aggrandizement of a country, Ferdinand aimed at the aggrandizement
of a House. Through the marriage of their daughter and heiress Juana with the son of the Emperor
Maximilian, the Archduke Philip, the blood of Ferdinand and Isabel had merged in that of the
House of Austria, and the aim of Ferdinand was nothing less than to give to the Austrian House
the whole world of the west. Charles of Austria, the issue of Philip's marriage, had been destined
from his birth by both his grandfathers, Maximilian and Ferdinand, to succeed to the empire;
Franche Comté and the state built up by the Burgundian Dukes in the Netherlands had already
passed into his hands at the death of his father; the madness of his mother left him next heir
of Castille; the death of Ferdinand would bring him Aragon and the dominion of the kings of
Aragon in Southern Italy; that of Maximilian would add the Archduchy of Austria, with the dependencies
in the south and its hopes of increase by the winning through marriage of the realms of Bohemia
and Hungary. A share in the Austrian Archduchy indeed belonged to Charles's brother, the Archduke
Ferdinand; but a kingdom in Northern Italy would at once compensate Ferdinand for his abandonment
of this heritage and extend the Austrian supremacy over the Peninsula, for Rome and Central
Italy would be helpless in the grasp of the power which ruled at both Naples and Milan. A war
alone could drive France from the Milanese, but such a war might be waged by a league of European
powers which would remain as a check upon France, should she attempt to hinder this vast union
of states in the hand of Charles or to wrest from him the Imperial Crown. Such a league, the
Holy League as it was called from the accession to it of the Pope, Ferdinand was enabled to
form at the close of 1511 by the kinship of the Emperor, the desire of Venice and Julius the
Second to free Italy from the stranger, and the warlike temper of Henry the Eighth.

[Sidenote: The Holy League]

Dreams of new Crécys and Agincourts roused the ardour of the young king; and the campaign of
1512 opened with his avowal of the old claims on his "heritage of France." But the subtle intriguer
in whose hands he lay pushed steadily to his own great ends. The League drove the French from
the Milanese. An English army which landed under the Marquis of Dorset at Fontarabia to attack
Guienne found itself used as a covering force to shield Ferdinand's seizure of Navarre, the
one road through which France could attack his grandson's heritage of Spain. The troops mutinied
and sailed home; Scotland, roused again by the danger of France, threatened invasion; the world
scoffed at Englishmen as useless for war. Henry's spirit however rose with the need. In 1513
he landed in person in the north of France, and a sudden rout of the French cavalry in an engagement
near Guinegate, which received from its bloodless character the name of the Battle of the Spurs,
gave him the fortresses of Térouanne and Tournay. A victory yet more decisive awaited his arms
at home. A Scotch army crossed the border, with James the Fourth at its head; but on the 9th
of September it was met by an English force under the Earl of Surrey at Flodden in Northumberland.
James "fell near his banner," and his army was driven off the field with heavy loss. Flushed
with this new glory, the young king was resolute to continue the war when in the opening of
1514 he found himself left alone by the dissolution of the League. Ferdinand had gained his
ends, and had no mind to fight longer simply to realize the dreams of his son-in-law. Henry
had indeed gained much. The might of France was broken. The Papacy was restored to freedom.
England had again figured as a great power in Europe. But the millions left by his father were
exhausted, his subjects had been drained by repeated subsidies, and, furious as he was at the
treachery of his Spanish ally, Henry was driven to conclude a peace.

[Sidenote: Protest of the New Learning]

To the hopes of the New Learning this sudden outbreak of the spirit of war, this change of
the monarch from whom they had looked for a "new order" into a vulgar conqueror, proved a bitter
disappointment. Colet thundered from the pulpit of St. Paul's that "an unjust peace is better
than the justest war," and protested that "when men out of hatred and ambition fight with and
destroy one another, they fight under the banner, not of Christ, but of the devil." Erasmus
quitted Cambridge with a bitter satire against the "madness" around him. "It is the people,"
he said, in words which must have startled his age,--"it is the people who build cities, while
the madness of princes destroys them." The sovereigns of his time appeared to him like ravenous
birds pouncing with beak and claw on the hard-won wealth and knowledge of mankind. "Kings who
are scarcely men," he exclaimed in bitter irony, "are called 'divine'; they are 'invincible'
though they fly from every battle-field; 'serene' though they turn the world upside down in
a storm of war; 'illustrious' though they grovel in ignorance of all that is noble; 'Catholic'
though they follow anything rather than Christ. Of all birds the Eagle alone has seemed to
wise men the type of royalty, a bird neither beautiful nor musical nor good for food, but murderous,
greedy, hateful to all, the curse of all, and with its great powers of doing harm only surpassed
by its desire to do it." It was the first time in modern history that religion had formally
dissociated itself from the ambition of princes and the horrors of war, or that the new spirit
of criticism had ventured not only to question but to deny what had till then seemed the primary
truths of political order.

[Sidenote: The Jerome of Erasmus]

But the indignation of the New Learning was diverted to more practical ends by the sudden peace.
However he had disappointed its hopes, Henry still remained its friend. Through all the changes
of his terrible career his home was a home of letters. His boy, Edward the Sixth, was a fair
scholar in both the classical languages. His daughter Mary wrote good Latin letters. Elizabeth
began every day with an hour's reading in the Greek Testament, the tragedies of Sophocles,
or the orations of Demosthenes. The ladies of the Court caught the royal fashion and were found
poring over the pages of Plato. Widely as Henry's ministers differed from each other, they
all agreed in sharing and fostering the culture around them. The panic of the scholar-group
therefore soon passed away. Colet toiled on with his educational efforts; Erasmus forwarded
to England the works which English liberality was enabling him to produce abroad. Warham extended
to him as generous an aid as the protection he had afforded to Colet. His edition of the works
of St. Jerome had been begun under the Primate's encouragement during the great scholar's residence
at Cambridge, and it appeared with a dedication to the Archbishop on its title-page. That Erasmus
could find protection in Warham's name for a work which boldly recalled Christendom to the
path of sound Biblical criticism, that he could address him in words so outspoken as those
of his preface, shows how fully the Primate sympathized with the highest efforts of the New
Learning. Nowhere had the spirit of enquiry so firmly set itself against the claims of authority.
"Synods and decrees, and even councils," wrote Erasmus, "are by no means in my judgement the
fittest modes of repressing error, unless truth depend simply on authority. But on the contrary,
the more dogmas there are, the more fruitful is the ground in producing heresies. Never was
the Christian faith purer or more undefiled than when the world was content with a single creed,
and that the shortest creed we have." It is touching even now to listen to such an appeal of
reason and of culture against the tide of dogmatism which was soon to flood Christendom with
Augsburg Confessions and Creeds of Pope Pius and Westminster Catechisms and Thirty-nine Articles.

[Sidenote: The New Testament of Erasmus]

But the principles which Erasmus urged in his "Jerome" were urged with far greater clearness
and force in a work that laid the foundation of the future Reformation, the edition of the
Greek Testament on which he had been engaged at Cambridge and whose production was almost wholly
due to the encouragement and assistance he received from English scholars. In itself the book
was a bold defiance of theological tradition. It set aside the Latin version of the Vulgate
which had secured universal acceptance in the Church. Its method of interpretation was based,
not on received dogmas, but on the literal meaning of the text. Its real end was the end at
which Colet had aimed in his Oxford lectures. Erasmus desired to set Christ himself in the
place of the Church, to recall men from the teaching of Christian theologians to the teaching
of the Founder of Christianity. The whole value of the Gospels to him lay in the vividness
with which they brought home to their readers the personal impression of Christ himself. "Were
we to have seen him with our own eyes, we should not have so intimate a knowledge as they give
us of Christ, speaking, healing, dying, rising again, as it were in our very presence." All
the superstitions of mediæval worship faded away in the light of this personal worship of Christ.
"If the footprints of Christ are shown us in any place, we kneel down and adore them. Why do
we not rather venerate the living and breathing picture of him in these books? We deck statues
of wood and stone with gold and gems for the love of Christ. Yet they only profess to represent
to us the outer form of his body, while these books present us with a living picture of his
holy mind." In the same way the actual teaching of Christ was made to supersede the mysterious
dogmas of the older ecclesiastical teaching. "As though Christ taught such subtleties," burst
out Erasmus: "subtleties that can scarcely be understood even by a few theologians--or as though
the strength of the Christian religion consisted in man's ignorance of it! It may be the safer
course," he goes on with characteristic irony, "to conceal the state mysteries of kings, but
Christ desired his mysteries to be spread abroad as openly as was possible." In the diffusion,
in the universal knowledge of the teaching of Christ the foundation of a reformed Christianity
had still, he urged, to be laid. With the tacit approval of the Primate of a Church which from
the time of Wyclif had held the translation and reading of the Bible in the common tongue to
be heresy and a crime punishable with the fire, Erasmus boldly avowed his wish for a Bible
open and intelligible to all. "I wish that even the weakest woman might read the Gospels and
the Epistles of St. Paul. I wish that they were translated into all languages, so as to be
read and understood not only by Scots and Irishmen, but even by Saracens and Turks. But the
first step to their being read is to make them intelligible to the reader. I long for the day
when the husbandman shall sing portions of them to himself as he follows the plough, when the
weaver shall hum them to the tune of his shuttle, when the traveller shall while away with
their stories the weariness of his journey." From the moment of its publication in 1516 the
New Testament of Erasmus became the topic of the day; the Court, the Universities, every household
to which the New Learning had penetrated, read and discussed it. But, bold as its language
may have seemed, Warham not only expressed his approbation, but lent the work--as he wrote
to its author--"to bishop after bishop." The most influential of his suffragans, Bishop Fox
of Winchester, declared that the mere version was worth ten commentaries, one of the most learned,
Fisher of Rochester, entertained Erasmus at his house.

[Sidenote: More]

Daring and full of promise as were these efforts of the New Learning in the direction of educational
and religious reform, its political and social speculations took a far wider range in the "Utopia"
of Thomas More. Even in the household of Cardinal Morton, where he had spent his childhood,
More's precocious ability had raised the highest hopes. "Whoever may live to see it," the grey-haired
statesman used to say, "this boy now waiting at table will turn out a marvellous man." We have
seen the spell which his wonderful learning and the sweetness of his temper threw at Oxford
over Colet and Erasmus; and young as he was, More no sooner quitted the University than he
was known throughout Europe as one of the foremost figures in the new movement. The keen, irregular
face, the grey restless eye, the thin mobile lips, the tumbled brown hair, the careless gait
and dress, as they remain stamped on the canvas of Holbein, picture the inner soul of the man,
his vivacity, his restless, all-devouring intellect, his keen and even reckless wit, the kindly,
half-sad humour that drew its strange veil of laughter and tears over the deep, tender reverence
of the soul within. In a higher, because in a sweeter and more loveable form than Colet, More
is the representative of the religious tendency of the New Learning in England. The young law-student
who laughed at the superstition and asceticism of the monks of his day wore a hair shirt next
his skin, and schooled himself by penances for the cell he desired among the Carthusians. It
was characteristic of the man that among all the gay, profligate scholars of the Italian Renascence
he chose as the object of his admiration the disciple of Savonarola, Pico di Mirandola. Free-thinker
as the bigots who listened to his daring speculations termed him, his eye would brighten and
his tongue falter as he spoke with friends of heaven and the after-life. When he took office,
it was with the open stipulation "first to look to God, and after God to the King."

In his outer bearing indeed there was nothing of the monk or recluse. The brightness and freedom
of the New Learning seemed incarnate in the young scholar with his gay talk, his winsomeness
of manner, his reckless epigrams, his passionate love of music, his omnivorous reading, his
paradoxical speculations, his gibes at monks, his schoolboy fervour of liberty. But events
were soon to prove that beneath this sunny nature lay a stern inflexibility of conscientious
resolve. The Florentine scholars penned declamations against tyrants while they covered with
their flatteries the tyranny of the house of Medici. More no sooner entered Parliament in 1504
than his ready argument and keen sense of justice led to the rejection of the demand for a
heavy subsidy. "A beardless boy," said the courtiers,--and More was only twenty-six,--"has
disappointed the King's purpose"; and during the rest of Henry the Seventh's reign the young
lawyer found it prudent to withdraw from public life. But the withdrawal had little effect
on his buoyant activity. He rose at once into repute at the bar. He wrote his "Life of Edward
the Fifth," the first work in which what we may call modern English prose appears written with
purity and clearness of style and a freedom either from antiquated forms of expression or classical
pedantry. His ascetic dreams were replaced by the affections of home. It is when we get a glimpse
of him in his house at Chelsea that we understand the endearing epithets which Erasmus always
lavishes upon More. The delight of the young husband was to train the girl he had chosen for
his wife in his own taste for letters and for music. The reserve which the age exacted from
parents was thrown to the winds in More's intercourse with his children. He loved teaching
them, and lured them to their deeper studies by the coins and curiosities he had gathered in
his cabinet. He was as fond of their pets and their games as his children themselves, and would
take grave scholars and statesmen into the garden to see his girls' rabbit-hutches or to watch
the gambols of their favourite monkey. "I have given you kisses enough," he wrote to his little
ones in merry verse when far away on political business, "but stripes hardly ever."

[Sidenote: The Utopia]

The accession of Henry the Eighth drew More back into the political current. It was at his
house that Erasmus penned the "Praise of Folly," and the work, in its Latin title, "Moriæ Encomium,"
embodied in playful fun his love of the extravagant humour of More. He was already in Henry's
favour; he was soon called to the royal court and used in the king's service. But More "tried
as hard to keep out of court," says his descendant, "as most men try to get into it." When
the charm of his conversation gave so much pleasure to the young sovereign "that he could not
once in a month get leave to go home to his wife or children, whose company he much desired,...
he began thereupon to dissemble his nature, and so, little by little, from his former mirth
to dissemble himself." He shared to the full the disappointment of his friends at the sudden
outbreak of Henry's warlike temper, but the Peace again brought him to Henry's side and he
was soon in the king's confidence both as a counsellor and as a diplomatist. It was on one
of his diplomatic missions that More describes himself as hearing news of the Kingdom of "Nowhere."
"On a certain day when I had heard mass in Our Lady's Church, which is the fairest, the most
gorgeous and curious church of building in all the city of Antwerp and also most frequented
of people, and service being over I was ready to go home to my lodgings, I chanced to espy
my friend Peter Gilles talking with a certain stranger, a man well stricken in age, with a
black sun-burnt face a large beard, and a cloke cast trimly about his shoulders, whom by his
favour and apparell forthwith I judged to be a mariner." The sailor turned out to have been
a companion of Amerigo Vespucci in those voyages to the New World "that be now in print and
abroad in every man's hand," and on More's invitation he accompanied him to his house, and
"there in my garden upon a bench covered with green turves we sate down, talking together"
of the man's marvellous adventures, his desertion in America by Vespucci, his wanderings over
the country under the equinoctial line, and at last of his stay in the Kingdom of "Nowhere."

It was the story of "Nowhere," or Utopia, which More began in 1515 to embody in the wonderful
book which reveals to us the heart of the New Learning. As yet the movement had been one of
scholars and divines. Its plans of reform had been almost exclusively intellectual and religious.
But in More the same free play of thought which had shaken off the old forms of education and
faith turned to question the old forms of society and politics. From a world where fifteen
hundred years of Christian teaching had produced social injustice, religious intolerance, and
political tyranny the humourist philosopher turned to a "Nowhere" in which the mere efforts
of natural human virtue realized those ends of security, equality, brotherhood, and freedom
for which the very institution of society seemed to have been framed. It is as he wanders through
this dreamland of the new reason that More touches the great problems which were fast opening
before the modern world, problems of labour, of crime, of conscience, of government. Merely
to have seen and to have examined questions such as these would prove the keenness of his intellect,
but its far-reaching originality is shown in the solutions which he proposes. Amidst much that
is the pure play of an exuberant fancy, much that is mere recollection of the dreams of bygone
dreamers, we find again and again the most important social and political discoveries of later
times anticipated by the genius of Thomas More.

[Sidenote: Labour and Health]

In some points, such as his treatment of the question of Labour, he still remains far in advance
of current opinion. The whole system of society around him seemed to him "nothing but a conspiracy
of the rich against the poor." Its economic legislation from the Statute of Labourers to the
statutes by which the Parliament of 1515 strove to fix a standard of wages was simply the carrying
out of such a conspiracy by process of law. "The rich are ever striving to pare away something
further from the daily wages of the poor by private fraud and even by public law, so that the
wrong already existing (for it is a wrong that those from whom the State derives most benefit
should receive least reward) is made yet greater by means of the law of the State." "The rich
devise every means by which they may in the first place secure to themselves what they have
amassed by wrong, and then take to their own use and profit at the lowest possible price the
work and labour of the poor. And so soon as the rich decide on adopting these devices in the
name of the public, then they become law." The result was the wretched existence to which the
labour class was doomed, "a life so wretched that even a beast's life seems enviable." No such
cry of pity for the poor, of protest against the system of agrarian and manufacturing tyranny
which found its expression in the Statute-book had been heard since the days of Piers Ploughman.
But from Christendom More turns with a smile to "Nowhere." In "Nowhere" the aim of legislation
is to secure the welfare, social, industrial, intellectual, religious, of the community at
large, and of the labour-class as the true basis of a well-ordered commonwealth. The end of
its labour-laws was simply the welfare of the labourer. Goods were possessed indeed in common,
but work was compulsory with all. The period of toil was shortened to the nine hours demanded
by modern artizans, and the object of this curtailment was the intellectual improvement of
the worker. For herein they conceive the felicity of this life to consist." A public system
of education enabled the Utopians to avail themselves of their leisure. While in England half
of the population could read no English, every child was well taught in "Nowhere." The physical
aspects of society were cared for as attentively as its moral. The houses of Utopia "in the
beginning were very low and like homely cottages or poor shepherd huts made at all adventures
of every rude piece of timber that came first to hand, with mud walls and ridged roofs thatched
over with straw." The picture was really that of the common English town of More's day, the
home of squalor and pestilence. In Utopia however they had at last come to realize the connexion
between public morality and the health which springs from light, air, comfort, and cleanliness.
"The streets were twenty feet broad; the houses backed by spacious gardens, and curiously builded
after a gorgeous and gallant sort, with their stories one after another. The outsides of the
walls be made either of hard flint, or of plaster, or else of brick; and the inner sides be
well strengthened by timber work. The roofs be plain and flat, covered over with plaster, so
tempered that no fire can hurt or perish it, and withstanding the violence of the weather better
than lead. They keep the wind out of their windows with glass, for it is there much used, and
sometimes also with fine linen cloth dipped in oil or amber, and that for two commodities,
for by this means more light cometh in and the wind is better kept out."

[Sidenote: Crime]

The same foresight which appears in More's treatment of the questions of Labour and the Public
Health is yet more apparent in his treatment of the question of Crime. He was the first to
suggest that punishment was less effective in suppressing it than prevention. "If you allow
your people to be badly taught, their morals to be corrupted from childhood, and then when
they are men punish them for the very crimes to which they have been trained in childhood--what
is this but to make thieves, and then to punish them?" He was the first to plead for proportion
between the punishment and the crime, and to point out the folly of the cruel penalties of
his day. "Simple theft is not so great an offence as to be punished with death." If a thief
and a murderer are sure of the same penalty, More shows that the law is simply tempting the
thief to secure his theft by murder. "While we go about to make thieves afraid, we are really
provoking them to kill good men." The end of all punishment he declares to be reformation,
"nothing else but the destruction of vice and the saving of men." He advises "so using and
ordering criminals that they cannot choose but be good, and what harm soever they did before,
the residue of their lives to make amends for the same." Above all he urges that to be remedial
punishment must be wrought out by labour and hope, so that "none is hopeless or in despair
to recover again his former state of freedom by giving good tokens and likelihood of himself
that he will ever after that live a true and honest man." It is not too much to say that in
the great principles More lays down he anticipated every one of the improvements in our criminal
system which have distinguished the last hundred years.

[Sidenote: Religion]

His treatment of the religious question was even more in advance of his age. If the houses
of Utopia were strangely in contrast with the halls of England, where the bones from every
dinner lay rotting in the dirty straw which strewed the floor, where the smoke curled about
the rafters, and the wind whistled through the unglazed windows; if its penal legislation had
little likeness to the gallows which stood out so frequently against our English sky; the religion
of "Nowhere" was in yet stronger conflict with the faith of Christendom. It rested simply on
nature and reason. It held that God's design was the happiness of man, and that the ascetic
rejection of human delights, save for the common good, was thanklessness to the Giver. Christianity
indeed had already reached Utopia, but it had few priests; religion found its centre rather
in the family than in the congregation: and each household confessed its faults to its own
natural head. A yet stranger characteristic was seen in the peaceable way in which it lived
side by side with the older religions. More than a century before William of Orange More discerned
and proclaimed the great principle of religious toleration. In "Nowhere" it was lawful to every
man to be of what religion he would. Even the disbelievers in a Divine Being or in the immortality
of man, who by a single exception to its perfect religious indifference were excluded from
public office, were excluded, not on the ground of their religious belief, but because their
opinions were deemed to be degrading to mankind and therefore to incapacitate those who held
them from governing in a noble temper. But they were subject to no punishment, because the
people of Utopia were "persuaded that it is not in a man's power to believe what he list."
The religion which a man held he might propagate by argument, though not by violence or insult
to the religion of others. But while each sect performed its rites in private, all assembled
for public worship in a spacious temple, where the vast throng, clad in white, and grouped
round a priest clothed in fair raiment wrought marvellously out of birds' plumage, joined in
hymns and prayers so framed as to be acceptable to all. The importance of this public devotion
lay in the evidence it afforded that liberty of conscience could be combined with religious unity.

[Sidenote: Political Liberty]

But even more important than More's defence of religious freedom was his firm maintenance of
political liberty against the monarchy. Steady and irresistible as was the growth of the royal
power, it was far from seeming to the keenest political thinker of that day so natural and
inevitable a developement of our history as it seems to some writers in our own. In political
hints which lie scattered over the whole of the Utopia More notes with a bitter irony the advance
of the new despotism. It was only in "Nowhere" that a sovereign was "removable on suspicion
of a design to enslave his people." In England the work of slavery was being quietly wrought,
hints the great lawyer, through the law. "There will never be wanting some pretence for deciding
in the king's favour; as that equity is on his side, or the strict letter of the law, or some
forced interpretation of it: or if none of these, that the royal prerogative ought with conscientious
judges to outweigh all other considerations." We are startled at the precision with which More
describes the processes by which the law-courts were to lend themselves to the advance of tyranny
till their crowning judgement in the case of ship-money. But behind these judicial expedients
lay great principles of absolutism, which partly from the example of foreign monarchies, partly
from the sense of social and political insecurity, and yet more from the isolated position
of the Crown, were gradually winning their way in public opinion. "These notions"--More goes
boldly on in words written, it must be remembered, within the precincts of Henry's court and
beneath the eye of Wolsey--"these notions are fostered by the maxim that the king can do no
wrong, however much he may wish to do it; that not only the property but the persons of his
subjects are his own; and that a man has a right to no more than the king's goodness thinks
fit not to take from him." It is only in the light of this emphatic protest against the king-worship
which was soon to override liberty and law that we can understand More's later career. Steady
to the last in his loyalty to Parliaments, as steady in his resistance to mere personal rule,
it was with a smile as fearless as the smile with which he penned the half-jesting words of
his Utopia that he sealed them with his blood on Tower Hill.

CHAPTER III WOLSEY 1514-1529

[Sidenote: Wolsey's rise]

"There are many things in the Commonwealth of Nowhere that I rather wish than hope to see embodied
in our own." It was with these words of characteristic irony that More closed the first work
which embodied the dreams of the New Learning. Destined as they were to fulfilment in the course
of ages, its schemes of social, religious, and political reform broke in fact helplessly against
the temper of the time. At the moment when More was pleading the cause of justice between rich
and poor social discontent was being fanned by new exactions and sterner laws into a fiercer
flame. While he was advocating toleration and Christian comprehension Christendom stood on
the verge of a religious strife which was to rend it for ever in pieces. While he aimed sarcasm
after sarcasm at king-worship the new despotism of the Monarchy was being organised into a
vast and all-embracing system by the genius of Thomas Wolsey. Wolsey was the son of a wealthy
townsman of Ipswich whose ability had raised him into notice at the close of the preceding
reign, and who had been taken by Bishop Fox into the service of the Crown. The activity which
he showed in organizing and equipping the royal army for the campaign of 1513 won for him a
foremost place in the confidence of Henry the Eighth. The young king lavished dignities on
him with a profusion that marked the completeness of his trust. From the post of royal almoner
he was advanced in 1513 to the see of Tournay. At the opening of 1514 he became bishop of Lincoln;
at its close he was translated to the archbishoprick of York. In 1515 Henry procured from Rome
his elevation to the office of cardinal and raised him to the post of chancellor. So quick
a rise stirred envy in the men about him; and his rivals noted bitterly the songs, the dances,
and carousals which had won, as they believed, the favour of the king. But sensuous and worldly
as was Wolsey's temper, his powers lifted him high above the level of a court favourite. His
noble bearing, his varied ability, his enormous capacity for toil, the natural breadth and
grandeur of his mind, marked him naturally out as the minister of a king who showed throughout
his reign a keen eye for greatness in the men about him.

[Sidenote: Wolsey's policy]

Wolsey's mind was European rather than English; it dwelt little on home affairs but turned
almost exclusively to the general politics of the European powers and of England as one of
them. Whatever might be Henry's disappointment in the issue of his French campaigns the young
king might dwell with justifiable pride on the general result of his foreign policy. If his
direct gains from the Holy League had been little, he had at any rate won security on the side
of France. The loss of Navarre and of the Milanese left Lewis a far less dangerous neighbour
than he had seemed at Henry's accession, while the appearance of the Swiss soldiery during
the war of the League destroyed the military supremacy which France had enjoyed from the days
of Charles the Eighth. But if the war had freed England from the fear of French pressure Wolsey
was as resolute to free her from the dictation of Ferdinand, and this the resentment of Henry
at his unscrupulous desertion enabled him to bring about. Crippled as she was, France was no
longer formidable as a foe; and her alliance would not only break the supremacy of Ferdinand
over English policy but secure Henry on his northern border. Her husband's death at Flodden
and the infancy of their son raised Margaret Tudor to the Scotch regency, and seemed to promise
Henry a hold on his troublesome neighbours. But her marriage a year later with the Earl of
Angus, Archibald Douglas, soon left the Regent powerless among the factions of warring nobles.
She appealed to her brother for aid, while her opponents called on the Duke of Albany, the
son of the Albany who had been driven to France in 1484 and heir to the crown after the infant
king, to return and take the regency. Albany held broad lands in France; he had won fame as
a French general; and Scotland in his hands would be simply a means of French attack. A French
alliance not only freed Henry from dependence on Ferdinand but would meet this danger from
the north; and in the summer of 1514 a treaty was concluded with the French king and ratified
by his marriage with Henry's youngest sister, Mary Tudor.

[Sidenote: Francis the First]

The treaty was hardly signed when the death of Lewis in January 1515 undid this marriage and
placed his young cousin, Francis the First, upon the throne. But the old king's death brought
no change of policy. Francis at once prepared to renew the war in Italy, and for this purpose
he needed the friendship of his two neighbours in the west and the north, Henry and the ruler
of the Netherlands, the young Charles of Austria. Both were willing to give their friendship.
Charles, jealous of Maximilian's desire to bring him into tutelage, looked to a French alliance
as a security against the pressure of the Emperor, while Henry and Wolsey were eager to despatch
Francis on a campaign across the Alps, which would at any rate while it lasted remove all fear
of an attack on England. A yet stronger ground in the minds of both Charles and Henry for facilitating
the French king's march was their secret belief that his invasion of the Milanese would bring
the young king to inevitable ruin, for the Emperor and Ferdinand of Aragon were leagued with
every Italian state against Francis, and a Swiss army prepared to dispute with him the possession
of the Milanese. Charles therefore betrothed himself to the French king's sister, and Henry
concluded a fresh treaty with him in the spring of 1515. But the dreams of both rulers were
roughly broken. Francis succeeded both in crossing the Alps and in beating the Swiss army.
His victory in the greatest battle of the age, the battle of Marignano, at once gave him the
Milanese and laid the rest of Italy at his feet. The work of the Holy Alliance was undone,
and the dominion which England had dreaded in the hands of Lewis the Twelfth was restored in
the younger and more vigorous hands of his successor. Neither the king nor the Cardinal could
hide their chagrin when the French minister announced his master's victory, but it was no time
for an open breach. All Wolsey could do was to set himself secretly to hamper the French king's
work. English gold hindered any reconciliation between France and the Swiss, and enabled Maximilian
to lead a joint army of Swiss and Imperial soldiers in the following year over the Alps.

[Sidenote: Charles the Fifth]

But the campaign broke down. At this juncture indeed the death of Ferdinand in January 1516
changed the whole aspect of European politics. It at once opened to Charles of Austria his
Spanish and Neapolitan heritage. The presence of the young king was urgently called for by
the troubles that followed in Castile, and Charles saw that peace was needed for the gathering
into his hands of realms so widely scattered as his own. Maximilian too was ready to set aside
all other aims to secure the aggrandizement of his house. After an inactive campaign therefore
the Emperor negotiated secretly with France, and the treaty of Noyon which Charles concluded
with Francis in August 1516 was completed in March 1517 by the accession of Maximilian to their
alliance in the Treaty of Cambray. To all outer seeming the Treaty of Cambray left Francis
supreme in the west, unequalled in military repute, a soldier who at twenty had withstood and
broken the league of all Europe in arms, master of the Milanese, and through his alliances
with Venice, Florence, and the Pope virtually master of all Italy save the Neapolitan realm.
On the other hand the treaty left England exposed and alone, should France choose this moment
for attack. Francis was well aware of Wolsey's efforts against him, and the state of Scotland
offered the ready means of bringing about a quarrel. While Henry, anxious as he was to aid
his sister, was fettered by the fear that English intervention would bring French intervention
in its train and endanger the newly concluded alliance, Albany succeeded in evading the English
cruisers and landing in the May of 1515. He was at once declared Protector of the realm by
the Parliament at Edinburgh. Margaret on the other hand was driven into Stirling, and after
a short siege forced to take refuge in England. The influence of Albany and the French party
whom he headed secured for Francis in any struggle the aid of Scotland. But neither Henry nor
his minister really dreaded danger from the Treaty of Cambray; on the contrary it solved all
their difficulties. So well did they understand the aim of Charles in concluding it that they
gave him the gold which enabled him to reach Spain. Master of Castile and Aragon, of Naples
and the Netherlands, the Spanish king rose into a check on the French monarchy such as the
policy of Henry or Wolsey had never been able to construct before. Instead of towering over
Europe, Francis found himself confronted in the hour of his pride by a rival whom he was never
to overcome; while England, deserted and isolated as she seemed for the moment, was eagerly
sought in alliance by both princes. In October 1518 Francis strove to bind her to his cause
by a new treaty of peace, in which England sold Tournay to France and the hand of the French
dauphin was promised to Henry's daughter Mary, now a child of two years old.

[Sidenote: Wolsey's greatness]

At the close of 1518 therefore the policy of Wolsey seemed justified by success. He had found
England a power of the second order, overawed by France and dictated to by Ferdinand of Spain.
She now stood in the forefront of European affairs, a state whose alliance was desired alike
by French king and Spanish king, and which dealt on equal terms with Pope or Emperor. In European
cabinets Wolsey was regarded as hardly less a power to be conciliated than his royal master.
Both Charles and Francis sought his friendship; and in the years which followed his official
emoluments were swelled by pensions from both princes. At home the king loaded him with new
proofs of favour. The revenues of two sees whose tenants were foreigners fell into his hands;
he held the bishoprick of Winchester and the abbacy of St. Albans. He spent this vast wealth
with princely ostentation. His pomp was almost royal. A train of prelates and nobles followed
him as he moved; his household was composed of five hundred persons of noble birth, and its
chief posts were occupied by knights and barons of the realm. Two of the houses he built, Hampton
Court and York House, the later Whitehall, were splendid enough to serve at his fall as royal
palaces. Nor was this magnificence a mere show of power. The whole direction of home and foreign
affairs rested with Wolsey alone. His toil was ceaseless. The morning was for the most part
given to his business as chancellor in Westminster Hall and at the Star-Chamber; but nightfall
still found him labouring at exchequer business or home administration, managing Church affairs,
unravelling the complexities of Irish misgovernment, planning schools and colleges, above all
drawing and studying despatches and transacting the whole diplomatic correspondence of the
state. Greedy as was his passion for toil, Wolsey felt the pressure of this enormous mass of
business, and his imperious tones, his angry outbursts of impatience, showed him to be overworked.
Even his vigorous frame gave way. Still a strong and handsome man in 1518 at the age of forty-seven,
Wolsey was already an old man, broken by disease, when he fell from power at fifty-eight. But
enormous as was the mass of work which he undertook, it was thoroughly done. His administration
of the royal treasury was rigidly economical. The number of his despatches is hardly less remarkable
than the care he bestowed on each. Even More, an avowed enemy, owns that as Chancellor he surpassed
all men's expectations. The court of Chancery indeed became so crowded through the character
for expedition and justice which it gained under his rule that subordinate courts had to be
created for its relief.

[Sidenote: Concentration of secular and ecclesiastical power]

But not even with this concentration of authority in a single hand was Henry content. At the
close of 1517 he procured from the Pope the Cardinal's appointment as Legate a latere in the
realm. Such a Legate was entrusted with powers almost as full as those of the Pope himself;
his jurisdiction extended over every bishop and priest, it overrode every privilege or exemption
of abbey or cell, while his court superseded that of Rome as the final court of ecclesiastical
appeal for the realm. Already wielding the full powers of secular justice in his capacity of
Chancellor and of president of the royal Council, Wolsey wielded the full power of spiritual
justice in his capacity of Legate. His elevation was no mere freak of royal favour; it was
the result of a distinct policy. The moment had come when the Monarchy was to gather up all
government into the personal grasp of the king. The checks which had been imposed on the action
of the sovereign by the presence of great prelates and lords at his council were practically
removed. His fellow-councillors learned to hold their peace when the haughty minister "clapped
his rod on the board." The restraints of public justice were equally done away. Even the distant
check of Rome was gone. All secular, all ecclesiastical power was summed up in a single hand.
It was this concentration of authority in Wolsey which accustomed England to a system of personal
government under Henry and his successors. It was the Cardinal's long tenure of the whole Papal
authority within the realm, and the consequent suspension of appeals to Rome, that led men
to acquiesce at a later time in Henry's own claim of religious supremacy. For proud as was
Wolsey's bearing and high as were his natural powers he stood before England as the mere creature
of the king. Greatness, wealth, authority he held, and owned he held, simply at the royal will.
In raising his low-born favourite to the head of church and state Henry was gathering all religious
as well as all civil authority into his personal grasp. The nation which trembled before Wolsey
learned to tremble before the master who could destroy Wolsey with a breath.

[Sidenote: Rivalry of Charles and Francis]

The rise of Charles of Austria gave a new turn to Wolsey's policy. Till now France had been
a pressing danger, and the political scheme both of Henry and his minister lay in organizing
leagues to check her greatness or in diverting her activity to the fields of Lombardy. But
from the moment of Ferdinand's death this power of Francis was balanced by the power of Charles.
Possessor of the Netherlands, of Franche Comté, of Spain, Charles already pressed France on
its northern, eastern, and southern borders when the death of his grandfather Maximilian in
the spring of 1519 added to his dominions the heritage of the House of Austria in Swabia and
on the Danube. It did yet more for him in opening to him the Empire. The intrigues of Maximilian
had secured for Charles promises of support from a majority of the Electors, and though Francis
redoubled his efforts and Henry the Eighth sent an envoy to push his own succession, the cry
of Germany for a German head carried all before it. In June 1519 Charles was elected Emperor;
and France saw herself girt in on every side by a power whose greed was even greater than her
own. For, boy of nineteen as he was, Charles from the first moment of his rule meant to make
himself master of the world; and France, thrown suddenly on the defensive, nerved herself for
the coming struggle. Both needed the gold and friendship of England. Convinced as he was of
Henry's treachery in the Imperial election, where the English sovereign had promised Francis
his support, the French king clung to the alliance which Wolsey in his uncertainty as to the
actual drift of Charles had concluded in 1518, and pressed for an interview with Henry himself.
But the need of France had woke dreams of more than mere safety or a balanced neutrality in
Wolsey and his master. The time seemed come at last for a bolder game. The claim on the French
crown had never been waived; the dream of recovering at least Guienne and Normandy still lived
on in the hearts of English statesmen; and the subtle, unscrupulous youth who was now planning
his blow for the mastery of the world knew well how to seize upon dreams such as these. Nor
was Wolsey forgotten. If Henry coveted France, his minister coveted no less a prize than the
Papacy; and the young Emperor was lavish of promises of support in any coming election. The
result of his seductions was quickly seen. While Henry deferred the interview with Francis
till the summer of 1520, Charles had already planned a meeting with his uncle in the opening
of the year.

[Sidenote: League with Charles]

What importance Charles attached to this meeting was seen in his leaving Spain ablaze with
revolt behind him to keep his engagement. He landed at Dover in the end of May, and King and
Emperor rode alone to Canterbury, but of the promises or pledges which passed we know little
save from the after-course of English politics. Nothing could have differed more vividly from
this simple ride than the interview with Francis which followed in June. A camp of three hundred
white tents surrounded a faery palace with gilded posterns and brightly-coloured oriels which
rose like a dream from the barren plain of Guisnes, its walls hung with tapestry, its roof
embossed with roses, its golden fountain spouting wine over the greensward. But all this pomp
and splendour, the chivalrous embraces and tourneys of the kings, the gorgeous entry of Wolsey
in his crimson robe on a mule trapped with gold, the fresh treaty which ratified the alliance,
hardly veiled the new English purpose. A second interview between Charles and his uncle as
he returned from the meeting with Francis ended in a secret confederacy of the two sovereigns
and the promise of the Emperor to marry his cousin, Henry's one child, Mary Tudor. With her
hand passed the heritage of the English Crown. Henry had now ceased to hope for a son from
Catharine, and Mary was his destined successor. Her right to the throne was asserted by a deed
which proved how utterly the baronage now lay at the mercy of the king. The Duke of Buckingham
stood first in blood as in power among the English nobles; he was the descendant of Edward
the Third's youngest son, and if Mary's succession were denied he stood heir to the throne.
His hopes had been fanned by prophets and astrologers, and wild words told his purpose to seize
the crown on Henry's death in defiance of every opponent. But word and act had for two years
been watched by the king; and in 1521 the Duke was arrested, condemned as a traitor by his
peers, and beheaded on Tower Hill. His blood was a pledge of Henry's sincerity which Charles
could not mistake. Francis on the other hand had never for a moment been deceived by the profuse
assurances of friendship which the king and Wolsey lavished on him. A revolt of the Spanish
towns offered a favourable opportunity for an attack on his rival, and a French army passed
over the Pyrenees into Navarre while Francis himself prepared to invade the Netherlands. Both
princes appealed for aid under their separate treaties to Henry; and the English sovereign,
whom the quick stroke of the French had taken by surprise, could only gain time by a feigned
mediation in which Wolsey visited both Emperor and King. But at the close of the year England
was at last ready for action, and Wolsey's solemn decision that Francis was the aggressor was
followed in November by a secret league which was concluded at Calais between the Pope, the
Emperor, and Henry.

[Sidenote: Benevolences]

The conquest of the Milanese by the imperial generals turned at this moment the balance of
the war, and as the struggle went on the accession of Venice and the lesser Italian republics,
of the king of Hungary and Ferdinand of Austria, to whom Charles had ceded his share in the
hereditary duchy of their house, to the alliance for the recovery of Italy from the French,
threatened ruin to the cause of Francis. In real power however the two combatants were still
fairly matched. If she stood alone, France was rich and compact, while her opponents were scattered,
distracted by warring aims, and all equally poor. The wealth which had given Henry his weight
in the counsels of Europe at the opening of his reign had been exhausted by his earlier wars,
and Wolsey's economy had done nothing more than tide the crown through the past years of peace.
But now that Henry had promised to raise forty thousand men for the coming campaign the ordinary
resources of the treasury were utterly insufficient. With the instinct of despotism Wolsey
shrank from reviving the tradition of the Parliament. Though Henry had thrice called the Houses
together to supply the expenses of his earlier struggle with France his minister had governed
through seven years of peace without once assembling them. War made a Parliament inevitable,
but for a while Wolsey strove to delay its summons by a wide extension of the practice which
Edward the Fourth had invented of raising money by gifts called "Benevolences," or by forced
loans nominally to be repaid by a coming Parliament. Large sums were assessed upon every county.
Twenty thousand pounds were exacted from London, and its wealthier citizens were summoned before
the Cardinal and required to give an account of the value of their estates. Commissioners were
sent into each shire for the purposes of assessment, and precepts were issued on their information,
requiring in some cases supplies of soldiers, in others a tenth of a man's income, for the
king's service. So poor however was the return that the Earl of Surrey, who was sent as general
to Calais, could muster only a force of seventeen thousand men; and while Charles succeeded
in driving the French from Milan, the English campaign dwindled into a mere raid upon Picardy,
from which the army fell back, broken with want and disease.

[Sidenote: Wolsey and the Parliament]

The Cardinal was driven to call the Estates together in April 1523; and the conduct of the
Commons showed how little the new policy of the Monarchy had as yet done to change the temper
of the nation or to break its loyalty to the tradition of constitutional freedom. Wolsey needed
the sum of eight hundred thousand pounds, and proposed to raise it by a property tax of twenty
per cent. Such a demand was unprecedented, but the Cardinal counted on his presence to bear
down all opposition, and made the demand in person. He was received with obstinate silence.
It was in vain that he called on member after member to answer; and his appeal to More, who
had been elected to fill the chair of the House of Commons, was met by the Speaker's falling
on his knees and representing his powerlessness to reply till he had received instructions
from the House itself. The effort to overawe the Commons had in fact failed, and Wolsey was
forced to retire. He had no sooner withdrawn than an angry debate began, and the Cardinal returned
to answer the objections which were raised to the subsidy. But the Commons again foiled the
minister's attempt to influence their deliberations by refusing to discuss the matter in his
presence. The struggle continued for a fortnight; and though successful in procuring a grant
the court party were forced to content themselves with less than half of Wolsey's original
demand. The Church displayed as independent a spirit. Wolsey's aim of breaking down constitutional
traditions was shown, as in the case of the Commons, by his setting aside the old assembly
of the provincial convocations, and as Legate summoning the clergy to meet in a national synod.
But the clergy held as stubbornly to constitutional usage as the laity, and the Cardinal was
forced to lay his demand before them in their separate convocations. Even here however the
enormous grant he asked was disputed for four months, and the matter had at last to be settled
by a compromise.

[Sidenote: War with France]

It was plain that England was far from having sunk to a slavish submission to the monarchy.
But galled as Wolsey was by the resistance, his mind was too full of vast schemes of foreign
conquest to turn to any resolute conflict with opposition at home. The treason of the Duke
of Bourbon stirred a new hope of conquering France. Bourbon was Constable of France, the highest
of the French nobles both from his blood and the almost independent power he wielded in his
own duchy and in Provence. But a legal process by which Francis sought to recall his vast possessions
to the domain of the crown threatened him with ruin; and driven to secret revolt, he pledged
himself to rise against the king on the appearance of the allied armies in the heart of the
realm. His offer was eagerly accepted, and so confident were the conspirators of success that
they at once settled the division of their spoil. To Henry his hopes seemed at last near their
realization; and while Burgundy fell naturally to Charles, his ally claimed what remained of
France and the French crown. The departure of Francis with his army for Italy was to be the
signal for the execution of the scheme, a joint army of English and Imperialists advancing
to Bourbon's aid from the north while a force of Spaniards and Germans marched to the same
point from the south. As the French troops moved to the Alps a German force penetrated in August
into Lorraine, an English army disembarked at Calais, and a body of Spaniards descended from
the Pyrenees. But at the moment of its realization the discovery of the plot and an order for
his arrest foiled Bourbon's designs; and his precipitate flight threw these skilful plans into
confusion. Francis remained in his realm. Though the army which he sent over the Alps was driven
back from the walls of Milan it still held to Piedmont, while the allied force in northern
France under the command of the Duke of Suffolk advanced to the Oise only to find itself unsupported
and to fall hastily back, and the slow advance of the Spaniards frustrated the campaign in
Guienne. In Scotland alone a gleam of success lighted on the English arms. At the close of
the former war Albany had withdrawn to France and Margaret regained her power; but a quarrel
both with her husband and the English king brought the queen-mother herself to invite the Duke
to return. On the outbreak of the new struggle with Francis Henry at once insisted on his withdrawal,
and though Albany marched on England with a large and well-equipped army, the threats of the
English commander so wrought on him that he engaged to disband it and fled over sea. Henry
and his sister drew together again; and Margaret announced that her son, James the Fifth, who
had now reached his twelfth year, assumed the government as king, while Lord Surrey advanced
across the border to support her against the French party among the nobles. But the presence
of an English army roused the whole people to arms. Albany was recalled; and Surrey saw himself
forced to retreat while the Duke with sixty thousand men crossed the border and formed the
siege of Wark. But again his cowardice ruined all. No sooner did Surrey, now heavily reinforced,
advance to offer battle than Albany fell back to Lauder. Laying down the regency he set sail
for France, and the resumption of her power by Margaret relieved England from its dread of
a Scotch attack.

[Sidenote: Henry and Charles]

Baffled as he had been, Henry still clung to his schemes of a French crown; and the defeat
of the French army in Lombardy in 1524, the evacuation of Italy, and the advance of the Imperialist
troops into France itself revived his hopes of success. Unable to set an army on foot in Picardy,
he furnished the Emperor with supplies which enabled his troops to enter the south. But the
selfish policy of Charles was at once shown by the siege of Marseilles. While Henry had gained
nothing from the alliance Charles had gained the Milanese, and he was now preparing by the
conquest of Provence and the Mediterranean coast to link his possessions in Italy with his
possessions in Spain. Such a project was more practical and statesmanlike than the visions
of a conquest of France; but it was not to further the Emperor's greatness that England had
wasted money and men. Henry felt that he was tricked as he had been tricked in 1523. Then as
now it was clearly the aim of Charles to humble Francis, but not to transfer the French crown
to his English ally. Nor was the resentment of Wolsey at the Emperor's treachery less than
that of the king. At the death of Leo the Tenth, as at the death of his successor, Charles
had fulfilled his pledge to the Cardinal by directing his party in the Sacred College to support
his choice. But secret directions counteracted the open ones; and Wolsey had seen the tutor
of the Emperor, Adrian the Sixth, and his partizan, Clement the Seventh, successively raised
to the papal chair. The eyes of both king and minister were at last opened, and Henry drew
cautiously from his ally, suspending further payments to Bourbon's army, and opening secret
negotiations with France. But the face of affairs was changed anew by the obstinate resistance
of Marseilles, the ruin and retreat of the Imperialist forces, and the sudden advance of Francis
with a new army over the Alps. Though Milan was saved from his grasp, the Imperial troops were
surrounded and besieged in Pavia. For three months they held stubbornly out, but famine at
last forced them to a desperate resolve; and in February 1525, at a moment when the French
army was weakened by the despatch of forces to Southern Italy, a sudden attack of the Imperialists
ended in a crushing victory. The French were utterly routed and Francis himself remained a
prisoner in the hands of the conquerors. The ruin as it seemed of France roused into fresh
life the hopes of the English king. Again drawing closely to Charles he offered to join the
Emperor in an invasion of France with forty thousand men, to head his own forces, and to furnish
heavy subsidies for the cost of the war. Should the allies prove successful and Henry be crowned
king of France, he pledged himself to cede to Bourbon Dauphiny and his duchy, to surrender
Burgundy, Provence, and Languedoc to the Emperor, and to give Charles the hand of his daughter,
Mary, and with it the heritage of two crowns which would in the end make him master of the world.

[Sidenote: Resistance to Benevolences]

Though such a project seemed hardly perhaps as possible to Wolsey as to his master it served
to test the sincerity of Charles in his adhesion to the alliance. But whether they were in
earnest or no in proposing it, king and minister had alike to face the difficulty of an empty
treasury. Money was again needed for action, but to obtain a new grant from Parliament was
impossible, nor was Wolsey eager to meet fresh rebuffs from the spirit of the Commons or the
clergy. He was driven once more to the system of Benevolences. In every county a tenth was
demanded from the laity and a fourth from the clergy by the royal commissioners. But the demand
was met by a general resistance. The political instinct of the nation discerned as of old that
in the question of self-taxation was involved that of the very existence of freedom. The clergy
put themselves in the forefront of the opposition, and preached from every pulpit that the
commission was contrary to the liberties of the realm and that the king could take no man's
goods but by process of law. Archbishop Warham, who was pressing the demand in Kent, was forced
to write to the court that "there was sore grudging and murmuring among the people." "If men
should give their goods by a commission," said the Kentish squires, "then it would be worse
than the taxes of France, and England should be bond, not free." So stirred was the nation
that Wolsey bent to the storm and offered to rely on the voluntary loans of each subject. But
the statute of Richard the Third which declared all exaction of Benevolences illegal was recalled
to memory; the demand was evaded by London, and the Commissioners were driven out of Kent.
A revolt actually broke out among the weavers of Suffolk; the men of Cambridge banded for resistance;
the Norwich clothiers, though they yielded at first, soon threatened to rise. "Who is your
captain?" the Duke of Norfolk asked the crowd. "His name is Poverty," was the answer, "for
he and his cousin Necessity have brought us to this doing." There was in fact a general strike
of the employers. Clothmakers discharged their workers, farmers put away their servants. "They
say the King asketh so much that they be not able to do as they have done before this time."
Such a peasant insurrection as was raging in Germany was only prevented by the unconditional
withdrawal of the royal demand.

[Sidenote: End of the Austrian Alliance]

The check was too rough a one not to rouse both Wolsey and the king. Henry was wroth at the
need of giving way before rebels, and yet more wroth at the blow which the strife had dealt
to the popularity on which he set so great a store. Wolsey was more keenly hurt by the overthrow
of his hopes for a decisive campaign. Without money it was impossible to take advantage of
the prostration of France or bring the Emperor to any serious effort for its subjection and
partition. But Charles had no purpose in any case of playing the English game, or of carrying
out the pledges by which he had lured England into war. He concluded an armistice with his
prisoner, and used Wolsey's French negotiations in the previous year as a ground for evading
fulfilment of his stipulations. The alliance was in fact at an end; and the schemes of winning
anew "our inheritance of France" had ended in utter failure. So sharp a blow could hardly fail
to shake Wolsey's power. The popular clamour against him on the score of the Benevolences found
echoes at court; and it was only by a dexterous gift to Henry of his newly-built palace at
Hampton Court that Wolsey again won his old influence over the king. Buried indeed as both
Henry and his minister were in schemes of distant ambition, the sudden and general resistance
of England woke them to an uneasy consciousness that their dream of uncontrolled authority
was yet to find hindrances in the temper of the people they ruled. And at this moment a new
and irresistible power began to quicken the national love of freedom and law. It was the influence
of religion which was destined to ruin the fabric of the Monarchy; and the year which saw the
defeat of the Crown in its exaction of Benevolences saw the translation of the English Bible.

[Sidenote: Luther]

While Charles and Francis were struggling for the lordship of the world, Germany had been shaken
by the outburst of the Reformation. "That Luther has a fine genius!" laughed Leo the Tenth
when he heard in 1517 that a German Professor had nailed some Propositions denouncing the abuse
of Indulgences, or of the Papal power to remit certain penalties attached to the commission
of sins, against the doors of a church at Wittemberg. But the "Quarrel of Friars," as the controversy
was termed contemptuously at Rome, soon took larger proportions. If at the outset Luther flung
himself "prostrate at the feet" of the Papacy and owned its voice as the voice of Christ, the
sentence of Leo no sooner confirmed the doctrine of Indulgences than their opponent appealed
to a future Council of the Church. In 1520 the rupture was complete. A Papal Bull formally
condemned the errors of the Reformer, and Luther publicly consigned the Bull to the flames.
A second condemnation expelled him from the bosom of the Church, and the ban of the Empire
was soon added to that of the Papacy. Charles the Fifth had bought Leo's alliance with himself
and England by a promise of repressing the new heresy; and its author was called to appear
before him in a Diet at Worms. "Here stand I; I can none other," Luther replied to the young
Emperor as he pressed him to recant; and from a hiding-place in the Thuringian forest where
he was sheltered after his condemnation by the Elector of Saxony he denounced not merely, as
at first, the abuses of the Papacy, but the Papacy itself. The heresies of Wyclif were revived;
the infallibility, the authority of the Roman See, the truth of its doctrines, the efficacy
of its worship, were denied and scoffed at in vigorous pamphlets which issued from his retreat
and were dispersed throughout the world by the new printing-press. Germany welcomed them with
enthusiasm. Its old resentment against the oppression of Rome, the moral revolt in its more
religious minds against the secularity and corruption of the Church, the disgust of the New
Learning at the superstition which the Papacy now formally protected, combined to secure for
Luther a widespread popularity and the protection of the northern princes of the Empire.

[Sidenote: Luther and the New Learning]

In England his protest seemed at first to find no echo. The king himself was both on political
and religious grounds firm on the Papal side. England and Rome were drawn to a close alliance
by the identity of their political position. Each was hard pressed between the same great powers;
Rome had to hold its own between the masters of southern and the masters of northern Italy,
as England had to hold her own between the rulers of France and of the Netherlands. From the
outset of his reign to the actual break with Clement the Seventh the policy of Henry is always
at one with that of the Papacy. Nor were the king's religious tendencies hostile to it. He
was a trained theologian and proud of his theological knowledge, but to the end his convictions
remained firmly on the side of the doctrines which Luther denied. In 1521 therefore he entered
the lists against Luther with an "Assertion of the Seven Sacraments" for which he was rewarded
by Leo with the title of "Defender of the Faith." The insolent abuse of the Reformer's answer
called More and Fisher into the field. The influence of the New Learning was now strong at
the English Court. Colet and Grocyn were among its foremost preachers; Linacre was Henry's
physician; More was a privy councillor; Pace was one of the Secretaries of State; Tunstall
was Master of the Rolls. And as yet the New Learning, though scared by Luther's intemperate
language, had steadily backed him in his struggle. Erasmus pleaded for him with the Emperor.
Ulrich von Hutten attacked the friars in satires and invectives as violent as his own. But
the temper of the Renascence was even more antagonistic to the temper of Luther than that of
Rome itself. From the golden dream of a new age wrought peaceably and purely by the slow progress
of intelligence, the growth of letters, the developement of human virtue, the Reformer of Wittemberg
turned away with horror. He had little or no sympathy with the new culture. He despised reason
as heartily as any Papal dogmatist could despise it. He hated the very thought of toleration
or comprehension. He had been driven by a moral and intellectual compulsion to declare the
Roman system a false one, but it was only to replace it by another system of doctrine just
as elaborate, and claiming precisely the same infallibility. To degrade human nature was to
attack the very base of the New Learning; and his attack on it called the foremost of its teachers
to the field. But Erasmus no sooner advanced to its defence than Luther declared man to be
utterly enslaved by original sin and incapable through any efforts of his own of discovering
truth or of arriving at goodness. Such a doctrine not only annihilated the piety and wisdom
of the classic past, from which the New Learning had drawn its larger views of life and of
the world; it trampled in the dust reason itself, the very instrument by which More and Erasmus
hoped to regenerate both knowledge and religion. To More especially, with his keener perception
of its future effect, this sudden revival of a purely theological and dogmatic spirit, severing
Christendom into warring camps and ruining all hopes of union and tolerance, was especially
hateful. The temper which hitherto had seemed so "endearing, gentle, and happy," suddenly gave
way. His reply to Luther's attack upon the king sank to the level of the work it answered;
and though that of Bishop Fisher was calmer and more argumentative the divorce of the New Learning
from the Reformation seemed complete.

[Sidenote: Tyndale]

But if the world of scholars and thinkers stood aloof from the new movement it found a warmer
welcome in the larger world where men are stirred rather by emotion than by thought. There
was an England of which even More and Colet knew little in which Luther's words kindled a fire
that was never to die. As a great social and political movement Lollardry had ceased to exist,
and little remained of the directly religious impulse given by Wyclif beyond a vague restlessness
and discontent with the system of the Church. But weak and fitful as was the life of Lollardry
the prosecutions whose records lie scattered over the bishops' registers failed wholly to kill
it. The smouldering embers needed but a breath to fan them into flame, and the breath came
from William Tyndale. Born among the Cotswolds when Bosworth Field gave England to the Tudors,
Tyndale passed from Oxford to Cambridge to feel the full impulse given by the appearance there
of the New Testament of Erasmus. From that moment one thought was at his heart. He "perceived
by experience how that it was impossible to establish the lay people in any truth except the
scripture were plainly laid before their eyes in their mother-tongue." "If God spare my life,"
he said to a learned controversialist, "ere many years I will cause a boy that driveth the
plough shall know more of the scripture than thou dost." But he was a man of forty before his
dream became fact. Drawn from his retirement in Gloucestershire by the news of Luther's protest
at Wittemberg, he found shelter for a year with a London Alderman, Humfrey Monmouth. The book
at which he studied was the Bible. But it was soon needful to quit England if his purpose was
to hold. "I understood at the last not only that there was no room in my lord of London's palace
to translate the New Testament, but also that there was no place to do it in all England."
From Hamburg, where he took refuge in 1524, he probably soon found his way to the little town
which had suddenly become the sacred city of the Reformation. Students of all nations were
flocking there with an enthusiasm which resembled that of the Crusades. "As they came in sight
of the town," a contemporary tells us, "they returned thanks to God with clasped hands, for
from Wittemberg, as heretofore from Jerusalem, the light of evangelical truth had spread to
the utmost parts of the earth."

[Sidenote: Translation of the Bible]

Such a visit could only fire Tyndale to face the "poverty, exile, bitter absence from friends,
hunger and thirst and cold, great dangers, and innumerable other hard and sharp fightings,"
which the work he had set himself was to bring with it. In 1525 his version of the New Testament
was completed, and means were furnished by English merchants for printing it at Köln. But Tyndale
had soon to fly with his sheets to Worms, a city whose Lutheran tendencies made it a safer
refuge, and it was from Worms that six thousand copies of the New Testament were sent in 1526
to English shores. The king was keenly opposed to a book which he looked on as made "at the
solicitation and instance of Luther"; and even the men of the New Learning from whom it might
have hoped for welcome were estranged from it by its Lutheran origin. We can only fairly judge
their action by viewing it in the light of the time. What Warham and More saw over sea might
well have turned them from a movement which seemed breaking down the very foundations of religion
and society. Not only was the fabric of the Church rent asunder and the centre of Christian
unity denounced as "Babylon," but the reform itself seemed passing into anarchy. Luther was
steadily moving onward from the denial of one Catholic dogma to that of another; and what Luther
still clung to his followers were ready to fling away. Carlstadt was denouncing the reformer
of Wittemberg as fiercely as Luther himself had denounced the Pope, and meanwhile the religious
excitement was kindling wild dreams of social revolution, and men stood aghast at the horrors
of a Peasant-War which broke out in Southern Germany. It was not therefore as a mere translation
of the Bible that Tyndale's work reached England. It came as a part of the Lutheran movement,
and it bore the Lutheran stamp in its version of ecclesiastical words. "Church" became "congregation,"
"priest" was changed into "elder." It came too in company with Luther's bitter invectives and
reprints of the tracts of Wyclif, which the German traders of the Steelyard were importing
in large numbers. We can hardly wonder that More denounced the book as heretical, or that Warham
ordered it to be given up by all who possessed it.

[Sidenote: Wolsey and Lutheranism]

Wolsey took little heed of religious matters, but his policy was one of political adhesion
to Rome, and he presided over a solemn penance to which some Steelyard men submitted in St.
Paul's. "With six and thirty abbots, mitred priors, and bishops, and he in his whole pomp mitred"
the Cardinal looked on while "great baskets full of books ... were commanded after the great
fire was made before the Rood of Northen," the crucifix by the great north door of the cathedral,
"thus to be burned, and those heretics to go thrice about the fire and to cast in their fagots."
But scenes and denunciations such as these were vain in the presence of an enthusiasm which
grew every hour. "Englishmen," says a scholar of the time, "were so eager for the gospel as
to affirm that they would buy a New Testament even if they had to give a hundred thousand pieces
of money for it." Bibles and pamphlets were smuggled over to England and circulated among the
poorer and trading classes through the agency of an association of "Christian Brethren," consisting
principally of London tradesmen and citizens, but whose missionaries spread over the country
at large. They found their way at once to the Universities, where the intellectual impulse
given by the New Learning was quickening religious speculation. Cambridge had already won a
name for heresy; Barnes, one of its foremost scholars, had to carry his fagot before Wolsey
at St. Paul's; two other Cambridge teachers, Bilney and Latimer, were already known as "Lutherans."
The Cambridge scholars whom Wolsey introduced into Cardinal College which he was founding spread
the contagion through Oxford. A group of "Brethren" was formed in Cardinal College for the
secret reading and discussion of the Epistles; and this soon included the more intelligent
and learned scholars of the University. It was in vain that Clark, the centre of this group,
strove to dissuade fresh members from joining it by warnings of the impending dangers. But
in spite of the panic of the Protestants, some of whom fled over sea, little severity was really
exercised. Henry's chief anxiety indeed was lest in the outburst against heresy the interest
of the New Learning should suffer harm. This was remarkably shown in the protection he extended
to one who was destined to eclipse even the fame of Colet as a popular preacher. Hugh Latimer
was the son of a Leicestershire yeoman, whose armour the boy had buckled on in Henry the Seventh's
days ere he set out to meet the Cornish insurgents at Blackheath field. Latimer has himself
described the soldierly training of his youth. At fourteen he was at Cambridge, flinging himself
into the New Learning which was winning its way there with a zeal that at last told on his
physical strength. The ardour of his mental efforts left its mark on him in ailments and enfeebled
health from which, vigorous as he was, his frame never wholly freed itself. But he was destined
to be known, not as a scholar, but as a preacher. In his addresses from the pulpit the sturdy
good sense of the man shook off the pedantry of the schools as well as the subtlety of the
theologian. He had little turn for speculation, and in the religious changes of the day we
find him constantly lagging behind his brother reformers. But he had the moral earnestness
of a Jewish prophet, and his denunciations of wrong had a prophetic directness and fire. His
irony was yet more telling than his invective. "I would ask you a strange question," he said
once at Paul's Cross to a ring of Bishops; "who is the most diligent prelate in all England,
that passeth all the rest in doing of his office? I will tell you. It is the Devil! of all
the pack of them that have cure, the Devil shall go for my money; for he ordereth his business.
Therefore, you unpreaching prelates, learn of the Devil to be diligent in your office. If you
will not learn of God, for shame learn of the Devil." But Latimer was far from limiting himself
to invective. His homely humour breaks in with story and apologue; his earnestness is always
tempered with good sense; his plain and simple style quickens with a shrewd mother-wit. He
talks to his hearers as a man talks to his friends, telling stories such as we have given of
his own life at home, or chatting about the changes and chances of the day with a transparent
simplicity and truth that raises even his chat into grandeur. His theme is always the actual
world about him, and in his simple lessons of loyalty, of industry, of pity for the poor, he
touches upon almost every subject from the plough to the throne. No such preaching had been
heard in England before his day, and with the growth of his fame grew the danger of persecution.
There were moments when, bold as he was, Latimer's heart failed him. "If I had not trust that
God will help me," he wrote once, "I think the ocean sea would have divided my Lord of London
and me by this day." A citation for heresy at last brought the danger home. "I intend," he
wrote with his peculiar medley of humour and pathos, "to make merry with my parishioners this
Christmas, for all the sorrow, lest perchance I may never return to them again." But he was
saved throughout by the steady protection of the Court. Wolsey upheld him against the threats
of the Bishop of Ely; Henry made him his own chaplain; and the king's interposition at this
critical moment forced Latimer's judges to content themselves with a few vague words of submission.

[Sidenote: Anne Boleyn]

What really sheltered the reforming movement was Wolsey's indifference to all but political
matters. In spite of the foundation of Cardinal College in which he was now engaged, and of
the suppression of some lesser monasteries for its endowment, the men of the New Learning looked
on him as really devoid of any interest in the revival of letters or in their hopes of a general
enlightenment. He took hardly more heed of the new Lutheranism. His mind had no religious turn,
and the quarrel of faiths was with him simply one factor in the political game which he was
carrying on and which at this moment became more complex and absorbing than ever. The victory
of Pavia had ruined that system of balance which Henry the Seventh and in his earlier days
Henry the Eighth had striven to preserve. But the ruin had not been to England's profit, but
to the profit of its ally. While the Emperor stood supreme in Europe Henry had won nothing
from the war, and it was plain that Charles meant him to win nothing. He set aside all projects
of a joint invasion; he broke his pledge to wed Mary Tudor and married a princess of Portugal;
he pressed for a peace with France which would give him Burgundy. It was time for Henry and
his minister to change their course. They resolved to withdraw from all active part in the
rivalry of the two powers. In June, 1525, a treaty was secretly concluded with France. But
Henry remained on fair terms with the Emperor; and though England joined the Holy League for
the deliverance of Italy from the Spaniards which was formed between France, the Pope, and
the lesser Italian states on the release of Francis in the spring of 1526 by virtue of a treaty
which he at once repudiated, she took no part in the lingering war which went on across the
Alps. Charles was too prudent to resent Henry's alliance with his foes, and from this moment
the country remained virtually at peace. No longer spurred by the interest of great events,
the king ceased to take a busy part in foreign politics, and gave himself to hunting and sport.
Among the fairest and gayest ladies of his court stood Anne Boleyn. She was sprung of a merchant
family which had but lately risen to distinction through two great marriages, that of her grandfather
with the heiress of the Earls of Ormond, and that of her father, Sir Thomas Boleyn, with a
sister of the Duke of Norfolk. It was probably through his kinship with the Duke, who was now
Lord Treasurer and high in the king's confidence, that Boleyn was employed throughout Henry's
reign in state business, and his diplomatic abilities had secured his appointment as envoy
both to France and to the Emperor. His son, George Boleyn, a man of culture and a poet, was
among the group of young courtiers in whose society Henry took most pleasure. Anne was his
youngest daughter; born in 1507, she was still but a girl of fifteen when the outbreak of war
drew her from a stay in France to the English court. Her beauty was small, but her bright eyes,
her flowing hair, her gaiety and wit, soon won favour with the king, and only a month after
her return in 1522 the grant of honours to her father marked her influence over Henry. Fresh
gifts in the following years showed that the favour continued; but in 1524 a new colour was
given to this intimacy by a resolve on the king's part to break his marriage with the queen.
Catharine had now reached middle age; her personal charms had departed. The death of every
child save Mary may have woke scruples as to the lawfulness of a marriage on which a curse
seemed to rest; the need of a male heir for public security may have deepened this impression.
But whatever were the grounds of his action we find Henry from this moment pressing the Roman
See to grant him a divorce.

[Sidenote: The Divorce]

It is probable that the matter was already mooted in 1525, a year which saw new proof of Anne's
influence in the elevation of Sir Thomas Boleyn to the baronage as Lord Rochford. It is certain
that it was the object of secret negotiation with the Pope in 1526. No sovereign stood higher
in the favour of Rome than Henry, whose alliance had ever been ready in its distress and who
was even now prompt with aid in money. But Clement's consent to his wish meant a break with
the Emperor, Catharine's nephew; and the exhaustion of France, the weakness of the league in
which the lesser Italian states strove to maintain their independence against Charles after
the battle of Pavia, left the Pope at the Emperor's mercy. While the English envoy was mooting
the question of divorce in 1526 the surprise of Rome by an Imperial force brought home to Clement
his utter helplessness. It is hard to discover what part Wolsey had as yet taken in the matter
or whether as in other cases Henry had till now been acting alone, though the Cardinal himself
tells us that on Catharine's first discovery of the intrigue she attributed the proposal of
divorce to "my procurement and setting forth." But from this point his intervention is clear.
As legate he took cognizance of all matrimonial causes, and in May 1527 a collusive action
was brought in his court against Henry for cohabiting with his brother's wife. The king appeared
by proctor; but the suit was suddenly dropped. Secret as were the proceedings, they had now
reached Catharine's ear; and as she refused to admit the facts on which Henry rested his case
her appeal would have carried the matter to the tribunal of the Pope, and Clement's decision
could hardly be a favourable one.

[Sidenote: Wolsey and the Divorce]

The Pope was now in fact a prisoner in the Emperor's hands. At the very moment of the suit
Rome was stormed and sacked by the army of the Duke of Bourbon. "If the Pope's holiness fortune
either to be slain or taken," Wolsey wrote to the king when the news of this event reached
England, "it shall not a little hinder your Grace's affairs." But it was needful for the Cardinal
to find some expedient to carry out the king's will, for the group around Anne were using her
skilfully for their purposes. A great party had now gathered to her support. Her uncle, the
Duke of Norfolk, an able and ambitious man, counted on her rise to set him at the head of the
council-board; the brilliant group of young courtiers to which her brother belonged saw in
her success their own elevation; and the Duke of Suffolk with the bulk of the nobles hoped
through her means to bring about the ruin of the statesman before whom they trembled. What
most served their plans was the growth of Henry's passion. "If it please you," the king wrote
at this time to Anne Boleyn, "to do the office of a true, loyal mistress, and give yourself
body and heart to me, who have been and mean to be your loyal servant, I promise you not only
the name but that I shall make you my sole mistress, remove all others from my affection, and
serve you only." What stirred Henry's wrath most was Catharine's "stiff and obstinate" refusal
to bow to his will. Wolsey's advice that "your Grace should handle her both gently and doulcely"
only goaded Henry's impatience. He lent an ear to the rivals who charged his minister with
slackness in the cause, and danger drove the Cardinal to a bolder and yet more unscrupulous
device. The entire subjection of Italy to the Emperor was drawing closer the French alliance;
and a new treaty had been concluded in April. But this had hardly been signed when the sack
of Rome and the danger of the Pope called for bolder measures. Wolsey was despatched on a solemn
embassy to Francis to promise an English subsidy on the despatch of a French army across the
Alps. But he aimed at turning the Pope's situation to the profit of the divorce. Clement was
virtually a prisoner in the Castle of St. Angelo; and as it was impossible for him to fulfil
freely the function of a Pope, Wolsey proposed in conjunction with Francis to call a meeting
of the College of Cardinals at Avignon which should exercise the papal powers till Clement's
liberation. As Wolsey was to preside over this assembly, it would be easy to win from it a
favourable answer to Henry's request.

[Sidenote: The Legatine Commission]

But Clement had no mind to surrender his power, and secret orders from the Pope prevented the
Italian Cardinals from attending such an assembly. Nor was Wolsey more fortunate in another
plan for bringing about the same end by inducing Clement to delegate to him his full powers
westward of the Alps. Henry's trust in him was fast waning before these failures and the steady
pressure of his rivals at court, and the coldness of the king on his return in September was
an omen of his minister's fall. Henry was in fact resolved to take his own course; and while
Wolsey sought from the Pope a commission enabling him to try the case in his legatine court
and pronounce the marriage null and void by sentence of law, Henry had determined at the suggestion
of the Boleyns and apparently of Thomas Cranmer, a Cambridge scholar who was serving as their
chaplain, to seek without Wolsey's knowledge from Clement either his approval of a divorce,
or if a divorce could not be obtained a dispensation to re-marry without any divorce at all.
For some months his envoys could find no admission to the Pope; and though in December Clement
succeeded in escaping to Orvieto and drew some courage from the entry of the French army into
Italy, his temper was still too timid to venture on any decided course. He refused the dispensation
altogether. Wolsey's proposal for leaving the matter to a legatine court found better favour;
but when the commission reached England it was found to be "of no effect or authority." What
Henry wanted was not merely a divorce but the express sanction of the Pope to his divorce,
and this Clement steadily evaded. A fresh embassy with Wolsey's favourite and secretary, Stephen
Gardiner, at its head reached Orvieto in March 1528 to find in spite of Gardiner's threats
hardly better success; but Clement at last consented to a legatine commission for the trial
of the case in England. In this commission Cardinal Campeggio, who was looked upon as a partisan
of the English king, was joined with Wolsey.

[Sidenote: The Papal difficulties]

Great as the concession seemed, this gleam of success failed to hide from the minister the
dangers which gathered round him. The great nobles whom he had practically shut out from the
king's counsels were longing for his fall. The Boleyns and the young courtiers looked on him
as cool in Anne's cause. He was hated alike by men of the old doctrine and men of the new.
The clergy had never forgotten his extortions, the monks saw him suppressing small monasteries.
The foundation of Cardinal College failed to reconcile to him the scholars of the New Learning;
their poet, Skelton, was among his bitterest assailants. The Protestants, goaded by the persecution
of this very year, hated him with a deadly hatred. His French alliances, his declaration of
war with the Emperor, hindered the trade with Flanders and secured the hostility of the merchant
class. The country at large, galled with murrain and famine and panic-struck by an outbreak
of the sweating sickness which carried off two thousand in London alone, laid all its suffering
at the door of the Cardinal. And now that Henry's mood itself became uncertain Wolsey knew
his hour was come. Were the marriage once made, he told the French ambassador, and a male heir
born to the realm, he would withdraw from state affairs and serve God for the rest of his life.
But the divorce had still to be brought about ere marriage could be made or heir be born. Henry
indeed had seized on the grant of a commission as if the matter were at an end. Anne Boleyn
was installed in the royal palace, and honoured with the state of a wife. The new legate, Campeggio,
held the bishoprick of Salisbury, and had been asked for as judge from the belief that he would
favour the king's cause. But he bore secret instructions from the Pope to bring about if possible
a reconciliation between Henry and the queen, and in no case to pronounce sentence without
reference to Rome. The slowness of his journey presaged ill; he did not reach England till
the end of September, and a month was wasted in vain efforts to bring Henry to a reconciliation
or Catharine to retirement into a monastery. A new difficulty disclosed itself in the supposed
existence of a brief issued by Pope Julius and now in the possession of the Emperor, which
overruled all the objections to the earlier dispensation on which Henry relied. The hearing
of the cause was delayed through the winter, while new embassies strove to induce Clement to
declare this brief also invalid. Not only was such a demand glaringly unjust, but the progress
of the Imperial arms brought vividly home to the Pope its injustice. The danger which he feared
was not merely a danger to his temporal domain in Italy. It was a danger to the Papacy itself.
It was in vain that new embassies threatened Clement with the loss of his spiritual power over
England. To break with the Emperor was to risk the loss of his spiritual power over a far larger
world. Charles had already consented to the suspension of the judgement of his diet at Worms,
a consent which gave security to the new Protestantism in North Germany. If he burned heretics
in the Netherlands, he employed them in his armies. Lutheran soldiers had played their part
in the sack of Rome. Lutheranism had spread from North Germany along the Rhine, it was now
pushing fast into the hereditary possessions of the Austrian House, it had all but mastered
the Low Countries. France itself was mined with heresy; and were Charles once to give way,
the whole continent would be lost to Rome.

[Sidenote: The Trial of the Divorce]

Amidst difficulties such as these the Papal court saw no course open save one of delay. But
the long delay told fatally for Wolsey's fortunes. Even Clement blamed him for having hindered
Henry from judging the matter in his own realm and marrying on the sentence of his own courts,
and the Boleyns naturally looked upon his policy as dictated by hatred to Anne. Norfolk and
the great peers took courage from the bitter tone of the girl; and Henry himself charged the
Cardinal with a failure in fulfilling the promises he had made him. King and minister still
clung indeed passionately to their hopes from Rome. But in 1529 Charles met their pressure
with a pressure of his own; and the progress of his arms decided Clement to avoke the cause
to Rome. Wolsey could only hope to anticipate this decision by pushing the trial hastily forward,
and at the end of May the two Legates opened their court in the great hall of the Blackfriars.
King and queen were cited to appear before them when the court again met on the eighteenth
of June. Henry briefly announced his resolve to live no longer in mortal sin. The queen offered
an appeal to Clement, and on the refusal of the Legates to admit it flung herself at Henry's
feet. "Sire," said Catharine, "I beseech you to pity me, a woman and a stranger, without an
assured friend and without an indifferent counsellor. I take God to witness that I have always
been to you a true and loyal wife, that I have made it my constant duty to seek your pleasure,
that I have loved all whom you loved, whether I have reason or not, whether they are friends
to me or foes. I have been your wife for years; I have brought you many children. God knows
that when I came to your bed I was a virgin, and I put it to your own conscience to say whether
it was not so. If there be any offence which can be alleged against me I consent to depart
with infamy; if not, then I pray you to do me justice." The piteous appeal was wasted on a
king who was already entertaining Anne Boleyn with royal state in his own palace; the trial
proceeded, and on the twenty-third of July the court assembled to pronounce sentence. Henry's
hopes were at their highest when they were suddenly dashed to the ground. At the opening of
the proceedings Campeggio rose to declare the court adjourned to the following October.

[Sidenote: Henry's wrath]

The adjournment was a mere evasion. The pressure of the Imperialists had at last forced Clement
to summon the cause to his own tribunal at Rome, and the jurisdiction of the Legates was at
an end. "Now see I," cried the Duke of Suffolk as he dashed his hand on the table, "that the
old saw is true, that there was never Legate or Cardinal that did good to England!" The Duke
only echoed his master's wrath. Through the twenty years of his reign Henry had known nothing
of opposition to his will. His imperious temper had chafed at the weary negotiations, the subterfuges
and perfidies of the Pope. Though the commission was his own device, his pride must have been
sorely galled by the summons to the Legates' court. The warmest adherents of the older faith
revolted against the degradation of the crown. "It was the strangest and newest sight and device,"
says Cavendish, "that ever we read or heard of in any history or chronicle in any region that
a King and Queen should be convented and constrained by process compellatory to appear in any
court as common persons, within their own realm and dominion, to abide the judgement and decree
of their own subjects, having the royal diadem and prerogative thereof." Even this degradation
had been borne in vain. Foreign and Papal tribunal as that of the Legates really was, it lay
within Henry's kingdom and had the air of an English court. But the citation to Rome was a
summons to the king to plead in a court without his realm. Wolsey had himself warned Clement
of the hopelessness of expecting Henry to submit to such humiliation as this. "If the King
be cited to appear in person or by proxy and his prerogative be interfered with, none of his
subjects will tolerate the insult.... To cite the King to Rome, to threaten him with excommunication,
is no more tolerable than to deprive him of his royal dignity.... If he were to appear in Italy
it would be at the head of a formidable army." But Clement had been deaf to the warning, and
the case had been avoked out of the realm.

[Sidenote: Wolsey's fall]

Henry's wrath fell at once on Wolsey. Whatever furtherance or hindrance the Cardinal had given
to his re-marriage, it was Wolsey who had dissuaded him from acting at the first independently,
from conducting the cause in his own courts and acting on the sentence of his own judges. Whether
to secure the succession by a more indisputable decision or to preserve uninjured the prerogatives
of the Papal See, it was Wolsey who had counselled him to seek a divorce from Rome and promised
him success in his suit. And in this counsel Wolsey stood alone. Even Clement had urged the
king to carry out his original purpose when it was too late. All that the Pope sought was to
be freed from the necessity of meddling in the matter at all. It was Wolsey who had forced
Papal intervention on him, as he had forced it on Henry, and the failure of his plans was fatal
to him. From the close of the Legatine court Henry would see him no more, and his favourite,
Stephen Gardiner, who had become chief Secretary of State, succeeded him in the king's confidence.
If Wolsey still remained minister for a while, it was because the thread of the complex foreign
negotiations which he was conducting could not be roughly broken. Here too however failure
awaited him. His diplomacy sought to bring fresh pressure on the Pope and to provide a fresh
check on the Emperor by a closer alliance with France. But Francis was anxious to recover his
children who had remained as hostages for his return; he was weary of the long struggle, and
hopeless of aid from his Italian allies. At this crisis of his fate therefore Wolsey saw himself
deceived and outwitted by the conclusion of peace between France and the Emperor in a new treaty
at Cambray. Not only was his French policy no longer possible, but a reconciliation with Charles
was absolutely needful, and such a reconciliation could only be brought about by Wolsey's fall.
In October, on the very day that the Cardinal took his place with a haughty countenance and
all his former pomp in the Court of Chancery, an indictment was preferred against him by the
king's attorney for receiving bulls from Rome in violation of the Statute of Præmunire. A few
days later he was deprived of the seals. Wolsey was prostrated by the blow. In a series of
abject appeals he offered to give up everything that he possessed if the king would but cease
from his displeasure. "His face," wrote the French ambassador, "is dwindled to half its natural
size. In truth his misery is such that his enemies, Englishmen as they are, cannot help pitying
him." For the moment Henry seemed contented with his disgrace. A thousand boats full of Londoners
covered the Thames to see the Cardinal's barge pass to the Tower, but he was permitted to retire
to Esher. Although judgement of forfeiture and imprisonment was given against him in the King's
Bench at the close of October, in the following February he received a pardon on surrender
of his vast possessions to the Crown and was permitted to withdraw to his diocese of York,
the one dignity he had been suffered to retain.

CHAPTER IV THOMAS CROMWELL 1529-1540

[Sidenote: The new Despotism]

The ten years which follow the fall of Wolsey are among the most momentous in our history.
The Monarchy at last realized its power, and the work for which Wolsey had paved the way was
carried out with a terrible thoroughness. The one great institution which could still offer
resistance to the royal will was struck down. The Church became a mere instrument of the central
despotism. The people learned their helplessness in rebellions easily suppressed and avenged
with ruthless severity. A reign of terror, organized with consummate and merciless skill, held
England panic-stricken at Henry's feet. The noblest heads rolled from the block. Virtue and
learning could not save Thomas More; royal descent could not save Lady Salisbury. The putting
away of one queen, the execution of another, taught England that nothing was too high for Henry's
"courage" or too sacred for his "appetite." Parliament assembled only to sanction acts of unscrupulous
tyranny, or to build up by its own statutes the fabric of absolute rule. All the constitutional
safeguards of English freedom were swept away. Arbitrary taxation, arbitrary legislation, arbitrary
imprisonment were powers claimed without dispute and unsparingly used by the Crown.

The history of this great revolution, for it is nothing less, is the history of a single man.
In the whole line of English statesmen there is no one of whom we would willingly know so much,
no one of whom we really know so little, as of Thomas Cromwell. When he meets us in Henry's
service he had already passed middle life; and during his earlier years it is hardly possible
to do more than disentangle a few fragmentary facts from the mass of fable which gathered round
them. His youth was one of roving adventure. Whether he was the son of a poor blacksmith at
Putney or no, he could hardly have been more than a boy when he was engaged in the service
of the Marchioness of Dorset, and he must still have been young when he took part as a common
soldier in the wars of Italy, a "ruffian," as he owned afterwards to Cranmer, in the most unscrupulous
school the world contained. But it was a school in which he learned lessons even more dangerous
than those of the camp. He not only mastered the Italian language but drank in the manners
and tone of the Italy around him, the Italy of the Borgias and the Medici. It was with Italian
versatility that he turned from the camp to the counting-house; he was certainly engaged as
a commercial agent to one of the Venetian traders; tradition finds him as a clerk at Antwerp;
and in 1512 history at last encounters him as a thriving wool merchant at Middelburg in Zealand.

[Sidenote: Cromwell and Wolsey]

Returning to England, Cromwell continued to amass wealth as years went on by adding the trade
of scrivener, something between that of a banker and attorney, to his other occupations, as
well as by advancing money to the poorer nobles; and on the outbreak of the second war with
France we find him a busy and influential member of the Commons in Parliament. Five years later,
in 1528, the aim of his ambition was declared by his entering into Wolsey's service. The Cardinal
needed a man of business for the suppression of the smaller monasteries which he had undertaken
as well as for the transfer of their revenues to his foundations at Oxford and Ipswich, and
he showed his usual skill in the choice of men by finding such an agent in Cromwell. The task
was an unpopular one, and it was carried out with a rough indifference to the feelings it aroused
which involved Cromwell in the hate that was gathering round his master. But his wonderful
self-reliance and sense of power only broke upon the world at Wolsey's fall. Of the hundreds
of dependants who waited on the Cardinal's nod, Cromwell, hated and in danger as he must have
known himself to be, was the only one who clung to his master at the last. His plan was to
purchase not only his master's safety but his own. Wolsey was persuaded to buy off the hostility
of the courtiers by giving his personal confirmation to the prodigal grants of pensions and
annuities which had been already made from his revenues, while Cromwell acquired importance
as the go-between in these transactions. "Then began both noblemen and others who had patents
from the King," for grants from the Cardinal's estate, "to make earnest suit to Master Cromwell
for to solicit their causes, and for his pains therein they promised not only to reward him,
but to show him such pleasure as should be in their power." But if Cromwell showed his consummate
craft in thus serving himself as well as his master, he can have had no personal reasons for
the stand he made in the Parliament which was summoned in November against a bill for disqualifying
the Cardinal for all after employment, which was introduced by Norfolk and More. It was by
Cromwell that this was defeated and it was by him that the negotiations were conducted which
permitted the fallen minister to withdraw pardoned to York.

A general esteem seems to have rewarded this rare instance of fidelity to a ruined patron.
Cromwell however had done more than save himself from ruin. The negotiations for Wolsey's pensions
had given him access to the king, and "by his witty demeanour he grew continually in the King's
favour." But the favour had been won by more than "witty demeanour." In a private interview
with Henry Cromwell boldly advised him to cut the knot of the divorce by the simple exercise
of his own supremacy. The advice struck the key-note of the later policy by which the daring
counsellor was to change the whole face of Church and State; but Henry still clung to the hopes
held out by the new ministers who had followed Wolsey, and shrank perhaps as yet from the bare
absolutism to which Cromwell called him. The advice at any rate was concealed; and, though
high in the king's favour, his new servant waited patiently the progress of events.

[Sidenote: The Howards]

The first result of Wolsey's fall was a marked change in the system of administration. Both
the Tudor kings had carried on their government mainly through the agency of great ecclesiastics.
Archbishop Morton and Bishop Fox had been successively ministers of Henry the Seventh. Wolsey
had been the minister of Henry the Eighth. But with the ruin of the Cardinal the rule of the
churchmen ceased. The seals were given to Sir Thomas More. The real direction of affairs lay
in the hands of two great nobles, of the Duke of Suffolk who was President of the Council,
and of the Lord Treasurer, Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk. From this hour to the close
of the age of the Tudors the Howards were to play a prominent part in English history. They
had originally sprung from the circle of lawyers who rose to wealth and honour through their
employment by the Crown. Their earliest known ancestor was a judge under Edward the First;
and his descendants remained wealthy landowners in the eastern counties till early in the fifteenth
century they were suddenly raised to distinction by the marriage of Sir Robert Howard with
a wife who became heiress of the houses of Arundel and Norfolk, the Fitz-Alans and the Mowbrays.
John Howard, the issue of this marriage, was a prominent Yorkist and stood high in the favour
of the Yorkist kings. He was one of the councillors of Edward the Fourth, and received from
Richard the Third the old dignities of the house of Mowbray, the office of Earl Marshal and
the Dukedom of Norfolk. But he had hardly risen to greatness when he fell fighting by Richard's
side at Bosworth Field. His son was taken prisoner in the same battle and remained for three
years in the Tower. But his refusal to join in the rising of the Earl of Lincoln was rewarded
by Henry the Seventh with his release, his restoration to the Earldom of Surrey, and his employment
in the service of the crown where he soon took rank among the king's most trusted councillors.
His military abilities were seen in campaigns against the Scots which won back for him the
office of Earl Marshal, and in the victory of Flodden which restored to him the Dukedom of
Norfolk. The son of this victor of Flodden, Thomas, Earl of Surrey, had already served as lieutenant
in Ireland and as general against Albany on the Scottish frontier before his succession to
the dukedom in 1524. His coolness and tact had displayed themselves during the revolt against
Benevolences, when his influence alone averted a rising in the Eastern Counties. Since Buckingham's
death his house stood at the head of the English nobility: his office of Lord Treasurer placed
him high at the royal council board; and Henry's love for his niece, Anne Boleyn, gave a fresh
spur to the duke's ambition. But his influence had till now been overshadowed by the greatness
of Wolsey. With the Cardinal's fall however he at once came to the front. Though he had bowed
to the royal policy, he was known as the leader of the party which clung to alliance with the
Emperor, and now that such an alliance was needful Henry counted on Norfolk to renew the friendship
with Charles.

[Sidenote: The Parliament]

An even greater revolution was seen in the summons of a Parliament which met in November 1529.
Its assembly was no doubt prompted in part by the actual needs of the Crown, for Henry was
not only penniless but overwhelmed with debts and Parliament alone could give him freedom from
these embarrassments. But the importance of the questions brought before the Houses, and their
repeated assembly throughout the rest of Henry's reign, point to a definite change in the royal
system. The policy of Edward the Fourth, of Henry the Seventh, and of Wolsey was abandoned.
Instead of looking on Parliament as a danger the monarchy now felt itself strong enough to
use it as a tool. The obedience of the Commons was seen in the readiness with which they at
once passed a bill to release the crown from its debts. But Henry counted on more than obedience.
He counted, and justly counted, on the warm support of the Houses in his actual strife with
Rome. The plan of a divorce was no doubt unpopular. So violent was the indignation against
Anne Boleyn that she hardly dared to stir abroad. But popular feeling ran almost as bitterly
against the Papacy. The sight of an English king and an English queen pleading before a foreign
tribunal revived the old resentment against the subjection of Englishmen to Papal courts. The
helplessness of Clement in the grasp of the Emperor recalled the helplessness of the Popes
at Avignon in the grasp of the kings of France. That Henry should sue for justice to Rome was
galling enough, but the hottest adherent of the Papacy was outraged when the suit of his king
was granted or refused at the will of Charles. It was against this degradation of the Crown
that the Statutes of Provisors and Præmunire had been long since aimed. The need of Papal support
to their disputed title which had been felt by the Houses of Lancaster and York had held these
statutes in suspense, and the Legatine Court of Wolsey had openly defied them. They were still
however legally in force; they were part of the Parliamentary tradition; and it was certain
that Parliament would be as ready as ever to enforce the independent jurisdiction of the Crown.

[Sidenote: Hopes of the New Learning]

Not less significant was the attitude of the New Learning. On Wolsey's fall the seals had been
offered to Warham, and it was probably at his counsel that they were finally given to Sir Thomas
More. The chancellor's dream, if we may judge it from the acts of his brief ministry, seems
to have been that of carrying out the religious reformation which had been demanded by Colet
and Erasmus while checking the spirit of revolt against the unity of the Church. His severities
against the Protestants, exaggerated as they have been by polemic rancour, remain the one stain
on a memory that knows no other. But it was only by a rigid severance of the cause of reform
from what seemed to him the cause of revolution that More could hope for a successful issue
to the projects of reform which the council laid before Parliament. The Petition of the Commons
sounded like an echo of Colet's famous address to the Convocation. It remonstrated against
the legislation of the clergy in Convocation without the king's assent or that of his subjects,
the oppressive procedure of the Church Courts, the abuses of ecclesiastical patronage, and
the excessive number of holydays. Henry referred the Petition to the bishops, but they could
devise no means of redress, and the ministry persisted in pushing through the Houses their
bills for ecclesiastical reform. The importance of the new measures lay really in the action
of Parliament. They were an explicit announcement that church-reform was now to be undertaken,
not by the clergy, but by the people at large. On the other hand it was clear that it would
be carried out in a spirit of loyalty to the church. The Commons forced from Bishop Fisher
an apology for words which were taken as a doubt thrown on their orthodoxy. Henry forbade the
circulation of Tyndale's translation of the Bible as executed in a Protestant spirit. The reforming
measures however were pushed resolutely on. Though the questions of Convocation and the Bishops'
courts were adjourned for further consideration, the fees of the courts were curtailed, the
clergy restricted from lay employments, pluralities restrained, and residence enforced.

[Sidenote: Death of Wolsey]

Not less characteristic of the New Learning was the intellectual pressure it strove to bring
to bear on the wavering Pope. Cranmer was still active in the cause of Anne Boleyn; he had
just published a book in favour of the divorce; and he now urged on the ministry an appeal
to the learned opinion of Christendom by calling for the judgement of the chief universities
of Europe. His counsel was adopted; but Norfolk trusted to coarser means of attaining his end.
Like most of the English nobles and the whole of the merchant class, his sympathies were with
the House of Burgundy; he looked upon Wolsey as the real hindrance to the divorce through the
French policy which had driven Charles into a hostile attitude; and he counted on the Cardinal's
fall to bring about a renewal of friendship with the Emperor and to ensure his support. The
father of Anne Boleyn, now created Earl of Wiltshire, was sent in 1530 on this errand to the
Imperial Court. But Charles remained firm to Catharine's cause, and Clement would do nothing
in defiance of the Emperor. Nor was the appeal to the learned world more successful. In France
the profuse bribery of the English agents would have failed with the university of Paris but
for the interference of Francis himself, eager to regain Henry's goodwill by this office of
friendship. As shameless an exercise of the king's own authority was needed to wring an approval
of his cause from Oxford and Cambridge. In Germany the very Protestants, then in the fervour
of their moral revival and hoping little from a proclaimed opponent of Luther, were dead against
the king. So far as could be seen from Cranmer's test every learned man in Christendom but
for bribery and threats would have condemned the royal cause. Henry was embittered by failures
which he attributed to the unskilful diplomacy of his new counsellors; and it was rumoured
that he had been heard to regret the loss of the more dexterous statesman whom they had overthrown.
Wolsey, who since the beginning of the year had remained at York, though busy in appearance
with the duties of his see, was hoping more and more as the months passed by for his recall.
But the jealousy of his political enemies was roused by the king's regrets, and the pitiless
hand of Norfolk was seen in the quick and deadly blow which he dealt at his fallen rival. On
the fourth of November, on the eve of his installation feast, the Cardinal was arrested on
a charge of high treason and conducted by the Lieutenant of the Tower towards London. Already
broken by his enormous labours, by internal disease, and the sense of his fall, Wolsey accepted
the arrest as a sentence of death. An attack of dysentery forced him to rest at the abbey of
Leicester, and as he reached the gate he said feebly to the brethren who met him, "I am come
to lay my bones among you." On his death-bed his thoughts still clung to the prince whom he
had served. "Had I but served God as diligently as I have served the king," murmured the dying
man, "He would not have given me over in my grey hairs. But this is my due reward for my pains
and study, not regarding my service to God, but only my duty to my prince."

[Sidenote: Cromwell's Policy]

No words could paint with so terrible a truthfulness the spirit of the new despotism which
Wolsey had done more than any of those who went before him to build up. From tempers like his
all sense of loyalty to England, to its freedom, to its institutions, had utterly passed away,
and the one duty which the statesman owned was a duty to his "prince." To what issues such
a conception of a statesman's duty might lead was now to be seen in the career of a greater
than Wolsey. The two dukes had struck down the Cardinal only to set up another master in his
room. Since his interview with Henry Cromwell had remained in the king's service, where his
steady advance in the royal favour was marked by his elevation to the post of Secretary of
State. His patience was at last rewarded by the failure of the policy for which his own had
been set aside. At the close of 1530 the college of cardinals formally rejected the king's
request for leave to decide the whole matter in his own spiritual courts; and the defeat of
Norfolk's project drove Henry nearer and nearer to the bold plan from which he had shrunk at
Wolsey's fall. Cromwell was again ready with his suggestion that the king should disavow the
Papal jurisdiction, declare himself Head of the Church within his realm, and obtain a divorce
from his own Ecclesiastical Courts. But he looked on the divorce as simply the prelude to a
series of changes which the new minister was bent upon accomplishing. In all his chequered
life what had left its deepest stamp on him was Italy. Not only in the rapidity and ruthlessness
of his designs, but in their larger scope, their clearer purpose, and their admirable combination,
the Italian state-craft entered with Cromwell into English politics. He is in fact the first
English minister in whom we can trace through the whole period of his rule the steady working
out of a great and definite aim, that of raising the king to absolute authority on the ruins
of every rival power within the realm. It was not that Cromwell was a mere slave of tyranny.
Whether we may trust the tale that carries him in his youth to Florence or no, his statesmanship
was closely modelled on the ideal of the Florentine thinker whose book was constantly in his
hand. Even as a servant of Wolsey he startled the future Cardinal, Reginald Pole, by bidding
him take for his manual in politics the "Prince" of Machiavelli. Machiavelli hoped to find
in Cæsar Borgia or in the later Lorenzo de' Medici a tyrant who after crushing all rival tyrannies
might unite and regenerate Italy; and terrible and ruthless as his policy was, the final aim
of Cromwell seems to have been that of Machiavelli, an aim of securing enlightenment and order
for England by the concentration of all authority in the crown.

[Sidenote: The Headship of the Church]

The first step towards such an end was the freeing the monarchy from its spiritual obedience
to Rome. What the first of the Tudors had done for the political independence of the kingdom,
the second was to do for its ecclesiastical independence. Henry the Seventh had freed England
from the interference of France or the House of Burgundy; and in the question of the divorce
Cromwell saw the means of bringing Henry the Eighth to free it from the interference of the
Papacy. In such an effort resistance could be looked for only from the clergy. But their resistance
was what Cromwell desired. The last check on royal absolutism which had survived the Wars of
the Roses lay in the wealth, the independent synods and jurisdiction, and the religious claims
of the church; and for the success of the new policy it was necessary to reduce the great ecclesiastical
body to a mere department of the State in which all authority should flow from the sovereign
alone, his will be the only law, his decision the only test of truth. Such a change however
was hardly to be wrought without a struggle; and the question of national independence in all
ecclesiastical matters furnished ground on which the crown could conduct this struggle to the
best advantage. The secretary's first blow showed how unscrupulously the struggle was to be
waged. A year had passed since Wolsey had been convicted of a breach of the Statute of Præmunire.
The pedantry of the judges declared the whole nation to have been formally involved in the
same charge by its acceptance of his authority. The legal absurdity was now redressed by a
general pardon, but from this pardon the clergy found themselves omitted. In the spring of
1531 Convocation was assembled to be told that forgiveness could be bought at no less a price
than the payment of a fine amounting to a million of our present money, and the acknowledgement
of the king as "the chief protector, the only and supreme lord, and Head of the Church and
Clergy of England." Unjust as was the first demand, they at once submitted to it; against the
second they struggled hard. But their appeals to Henry and Cromwell met only with demands for
instant obedience. A compromise was at last arrived at by the insertion of a qualifying phrase
"So far as the law of Christ will allow"; and with this addition the words were again submitted
by Warham to the Convocation. There was a general silence. "Whoever is silent seems to consent,"
said the Archbishop. "Then are we all silent," replied a voice from among the crowd.

[Sidenote: Catharine put away]

There is no ground for thinking that the "Headship of the Church" which Henry claimed in this
submission was more than a warning addressed to the independent spirit of the clergy, or that
it bore as yet the meaning which was afterwards attached to it. It certainly implied no independence
of Rome, for negotiations were still being carried on with the Papal Court. But it told Clement
plainly that in any strife that might come between himself and Henry the clergy were in the
king's hand, and that he must look for no aid from them in any struggle with the crown. The
warning was backed by an address to the Pope from the Lords and some of the Commons who assembled
after a fresh prorogation of the Houses in the spring. "The cause of his Majesty," the Peers
were made to say, "is the cause of each of ourselves." They laid before the Pope what they
represented as the judgement of the Universities in favour of the divorce; but they faced boldly
the event of its rejection. In the summer the banishment of Catharine from the king's palace
to a house at Ampthill showed the firmness of Henry's resolve. Each of these acts was no doubt
intended to tell on the Pope's decision, for Henry still clung to the hope of extorting from
Clement a favourable answer, and at the close of the year a fresh embassy with Gardiner, now
Bishop of Winchester, at its head was despatched to the Papal court. But the embassy failed
like its predecessors, and at the opening of 1532 Cromwell was free to take more decisive steps
in the course on which he had entered.

[Sidenote: More's withdrawal]

What the nature of his policy was to be had already been detected by eyes as keen as his own.
More had seen in Wolsey's fall an opening for the realization of those schemes of religious
and even of political reform on which the scholars of the New Learning had long been brooding.
The substitution of the Lords of the Council for the autocratic rule of the Cardinal-minister,
the break-up of the great mass of powers which had been gathered into a single hand, the summons
of a Parliament, the ecclesiastical reforms which it at once sanctioned, were measures which
promised a more legal and constitutional system of government. The question of the divorce
presented to More no serious difficulty. Untenable as Henry's claim seemed to the now Chancellor,
his faith in the omnipotence of Parliament would have enabled him to submit to any statute
which named a new spouse as queen and her children as heirs to the crown. But as Cromwell's
policy unfolded itself he saw that more than this was impending. The Catholic instinct of his
mind, the dread of a rent Christendom and of the wars and bigotry that must come of its rending,
united with More's theological convictions to resist any spiritual severance of England from
the Papacy. His love for freedom, his revolt against the growing autocracy of the crown, the
very height and grandeur of his own spiritual convictions, all bent him to withstand a system
which would concentrate in the king the whole power of Church as of State, would leave him
without the one check that remained on his despotism, and make him arbiter of the religious
faith of his subjects. The later revolt of the Puritans against the king-worship which Cromwell
established proved the justice of the prevision which forced More in the spring of 1532 to
resign the post of Chancellor.

[Sidenote: England and Rome]

But the revolution from which he shrank was an inevitable one. Till now every Englishman had
practically owned a double life and a double allegiance. As citizen of a temporal state his
life was bounded by English shores and his loyalty due exclusively to his English king. But
as citizen of the state spiritual he belonged not to England but to Christendom. The law which
governed him was not a national law but a law that embraced every European nation, and the
ordinary course of judicial appeals in ecclesiastical cases proved to him that the sovereignty
in all matters of conscience or religion lay not at Westminster but at Rome. Such a distinction
could scarcely fail to bring embarrassment with it as the sense of national life and national
pride waxed stronger; and from the reign of the Edwards the problem of reconciling the spiritual
and temporal relations of the realm grew daily more difficult. Parliament had hardly risen
into life when it became the organ of the national jealousy whether of any Papal jurisdiction
without the realm or of the separate life and separate jurisdiction of the clergy within it.
The movement was long arrested by religious reaction and civil war. But the fresh sense of
national greatness which sprang from the policy of Henry the Eighth, the fresh sense of national
unity as the Monarchy gathered all power into its single hand, would have itself revived the
contest even without the spur of the divorce. What the question of the divorce really did was
to stimulate the movement by bringing into clearer view the wreck of the great Christian commonwealth
of which England had till now formed a part and the impossibility of any real exercise of a
spiritual sovereignty over it by the weakened Papacy, as well as by outraging the national
pride through the summons of the king to a foreign bar and the submission of English interests
to the will of a foreign Emperor.

[Sidenote: Act of Appeals]

With such a spur as this the movement which More dreaded moved forward as quickly as Cromwell
desired. The time had come when England was to claim for herself the fulness of power, ecclesiastical
as well as temporal, within her bounds; and in the concentration of all authority within the
hands of the sovereign which was the political characteristic of the time to claim this power
for the nation was to claim it for the king. The import of that headship of the Church which
Henry had assumed in the preceding year was brought fully out in one of the propositions laid
before the Convocation of 1532. "The King's Majesty," runs this memorable clause, "hath as
well the care of the souls of his subjects as their bodies; and may by the law of God by his
Parliament make laws touching and concerning as well the one as the other." The principle embodied
in these words was carried out in a series of decisive measures. Rome was dealt with in the
same unsparing fashion. The Parliament forbade by statute any further appeals to the Papal
Court; and on a petition from the clergy in Convocation the Houses granted power to the king
to suspend the payments of first-fruits, or the year's revenue which each bishop paid to Rome
on his election to a see. All judicial, all financial connexion with the Papacy was broken
by these two measures. The last indeed was as yet but a menace which Henry might use in his
negotiations with Clement. The hope which had been entertained of aid from Charles was now
abandoned; and the overthrow of Norfolk and his policy of alliance with the Empire was seen
at the midsummer of 1532 in the conclusion of a league with France. Cromwell had fallen back
on Wolsey's system; and the divorce was now to be looked for from the united pressure of the
French and English kings on the Papal court.

[Sidenote: Marriage of Anne Boleyn]

But the pressure was as unsuccessful as before. In November Clement threatened the king with
excommunication if he did not restore Catharine to her place as queen and abstain from all
intercourse with Anne Boleyn till the case was tried. But Henry still refused to submit to
the judgement of any court outside his realm; and the Pope, ready as he was with evasion and
delay, dared not alienate Charles by consenting to a trial within it. The lavish pledges which
Francis had given in an interview during the preceding summer may have aided to spur the king
to a decisive step which closed the long debate. At the opening of 1533 Henry was privately
married to Anne Boleyn. The match however was carefully kept secret while the Papal sanction
was being gained for the appointment of Cranmer to the See of Canterbury which had become vacant
by Archbishop Warham's death in the preceding year. But Cranmer's consecration at the close
of March was the signal for more open action, and Cromwell's policy was at last brought fairly
into play. The new primate at once laid the question of the king's marriage before the two
Houses of Convocation, and both voted that the licence of Pope Julius had been beyond the Papal
powers and that the marriage which it authorized was void. In May the king's suit was brought
before the Archbishop in his court at Dunstable; his judgement annulled the marriage with Catharine
as void from the beginning, and pronounced the marriage with Anne Boleyn, which her pregnancy
had forced Henry to reveal, a lawful marriage. A week later the hand of Cranmer placed upon
Anne's brow the crown which she had coveted so long.

[Sidenote: Act of Supremacy]

"There was much murmuring" at measures such as these. But Charles, though still loyal to his
aunt's cause, had no mind to incur risks for her; and Clement, though he annulled Cranmer's
proceedings, hesitated as yet to take sterner action. Henry on the other hand, conscious that
the die was thrown, moved rapidly forward in the path that Cromwell had opened. The Pope's
reversal of the primate's judgement was answered by an appeal to a General Council. The decision
of the cardinals to whom the case was referred in the spring of 1534, a decision which asserted
the lawfulness of Catharine's marriage, was met by the enforcement of the long-suspended statute
forbidding the payment of first-fruits to the Pope. Though the King was still firm in his resistance
to Lutheran opinions and at this moment endeavoured to prevent by statute the importation of
Lutheran books, the less scrupulous hand of his minister was seen already striving to find
a counterpoise to the hostility of the Emperor in an alliance with the Lutheran princes of
North Germany. Cromwell was now fast rising to a power which rivalled Wolsey's. His elevation
to the post of Lord Privy Seal placed him on a level with the great nobles of the Council board;
and Norfolk, constant in his hopes of reconciliation with Charles and the Papacy, saw his plans
set aside for the wider and more daring projects of "the blacksmith's son." Cromwell still
clung to the political engine whose powers he had turned to the service of the Crown. The Parliament
which had been summoned at Wolsey's fall met steadily year after year; and measure after measure
had shown its accordance with the royal will in the strife with Rome. It was now called to
deal a final blow. Step by step the ground had been cleared for the great Statute by which
the new character of the English Church was defined in the session of 1534. The Statute ordered
that the king "shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the only supreme head on earth of the
Church of England, and shall have and enjoy annexed and united to the Imperial Crown of this
realm as well the title and state thereof as all the honours, jurisdictions, authorities, immunities,
profits, and commodities to the said dignity belonging, with full power to visit, repress,
redress, reform, and amend all such errors, heresies, abuses, contempts, and enormities, which
by any manner of spiritual authority or jurisdiction might or may lawfully be reformed."

[Sidenote: The Vicar-General]

The full import of the Act of Supremacy was only seen in the following year. At the opening
of 1535 Henry formally took the title of "on earth Supreme Head of the Church of England,"
and some months later Cromwell was raised to the post of Vicar-General or Vicegerent of the
king in all matters ecclesiastical. His title, like his office, recalled the system of Wolsey.
It was not only as Legate but in later years as Vicar-General of the Pope that Wolsey had brought
all spiritual causes in England to an English court. The supreme ecclesiastical jurisdiction
in the realm passed into the hands of a minister who as Chancellor already exercised its supreme
civil jurisdiction. The Papal power had therefore long seemed transferred to the Crown before
the legislative measures which followed the divorce actually transferred it. It was in fact
the system of Catholicism itself that trained men to look without surprise on the concentration
of all spiritual and secular authority in Cromwell. Successor to Wolsey as Keeper of the Great
Seal, it seemed natural enough that Cromwell should succeed him also as Vicar-General of the
Church and that the union of the two powers should be restored in the hands of a minister of
the king. But the mere fact that these powers were united in the hands not of a priest but
of a layman showed the new drift of the royal policy. The Church was no longer to be brought
indirectly under the royal power; in the policy of Cromwell it was to be openly laid prostrate
at the foot of the throne.

[Sidenote: Subjection of the Bishops]

And this policy his position enabled him to carry out with a terrible thoroughness. One great
step towards its realization had already been taken in the statute which annihilated the free
legislative powers of the convocations of the Clergy. Another followed in an act which under
the pretext of restoring the free election of bishops turned every prelate into a nominee of
the king. The election of bishops by the chapters of their cathedral churches had long become
formal, and their appointment had since the time of the Edwards been practically made by the
Papacy on the nomination of the Crown. The privilege of free election was now with bitter irony
restored to the chapters, but they were compelled on pain of præmunire to choose whatever candidate
was recommended by the king. This strange expedient has lasted till the present time, though
its character has wholly changed with the developement of constitutional rule. The nomination
of bishops has ever since the accession of the Georges passed from the King in person to the
Minister who represents the will of the people. Practically therefore an English prelate, alone
among all the prelates of the world, is now raised to his episcopal throne by the same popular
election which raised Ambrose to his episcopal chair at Milan. But at the moment of the change
Cromwell's measure reduced the English bishops to absolute dependence on the Crown. Their dependence
would have been complete had his policy been thoroughly carried out and the royal power of
deposition put in force as well as that of appointment. As it was Henry could warn the Archbishop
of Dublin that if he persevered in his "proud folly, we be able to remove you again and to
put another man of more virtue and honesty in your place." By the more ardent partizans of
the Reformation this dependence of the bishops on the Crown was fully recognized. On the death
of Henry the Eighth Cranmer took out a new commission from Edward for the exercise of his office.
Latimer, when the royal policy clashed with his belief, felt bound to resign the See of Worcester.
If the power of deposition was quietly abandoned by Elizabeth, the abandonment was due not
so much to any deference for the religious instincts of the nation as to the fact that the
steady servility of the bishops rendered its exercise unnecessary.

[Sidenote: The Religious Houses]

A second step in Cromwell's policy followed hard on this enslavement of the episcopate. Master
of Convocation, absolute master of the bishops, Henry had become master of the monastic orders
through the right of visitation over them which had been transferred by the Act of Supremacy
from the Papacy to the Crown. The monks were soon to know what this right of visitation implied
in the hands of the Vicar-General. As an outlet for religious enthusiasm monasticism was practically
dead. The friar, now that his fervour of devotion and his intellectual energy had passed away,
had sunk into a mere beggar. The monks had become mere land-owners. Most of the religious houses
were anxious only to enlarge their revenues and to diminish the number of those who shared
them. In the general carelessness which prevailed as to the spiritual objects of their trust,
in the wasteful management of their estates, in the indolence and self-indulgence which for
the most part characterized them, the monastic establishments simply exhibited the faults of
all corporate bodies that have outlived the work which they were created to perform. They were
no more unpopular however than such corporate bodies generally are. The Lollard cry for their
suppression had died away. In the north, where some of the greatest abbeys were situated, the
monks were on good terms with the country gentry and their houses served as schools for their
children; nor is there any sign of a different feeling elsewhere.

[Sidenote: Suppression of the Lesser Monasteries]

But they had drawn on themselves at once the hatred of the New Learning and of the Monarchy.
In the early days of the revival of letters Popes and bishops had joined with princes and scholars
in welcoming the diffusion of culture and the hopes of religious reform. But though an abbot
or a prior here or there might be found among the supporters of the movement, the monastic
orders as a whole repelled it with unswerving obstinacy. The quarrel only became more bitter
as years went on. The keen sarcasms of Erasmus, the insolent buffoonery of Hutten, were lavished
on the "lovers of darkness" and of the cloister. In England Colet and More echoed with greater
reserve the scorn and invective of their friends. The Monarchy had other causes for its hate.
In Cromwell's system there was no room for either the virtues or the vices of monasticism,
for its indolence and superstition, or for its independence of the throne. The bold stand which
the monastic orders had made against benevolences had never been forgiven, while the revenues
of their foundations offered spoil vast enough to fill the royal treasury and secure a host
of friends for the new reforms. Two royal commissioners therefore were despatched on a general
visitation of the religious houses, and their reports formed a "Black Book" which was laid
before Parliament in 1536. It was acknowledged that about a third of the houses, including
the bulk of the larger abbeys, were fairly and decently conducted. The rest were charged with
drunkenness, with simony, and with the foulest and most revolting crimes. The character of
the visitors, the sweeping nature of their report, and the long debate which followed on its
reception, leaves little doubt that these charges were grossly exaggerated. But the want of
any effective discipline which had resulted from their exemption from all but Papal supervision
told fatally against monastic morality even in abbeys like St. Albans; and the acknowledgement
of Warham, as well as a partial measure of suppression begun by Wolsey, go some way to prove
that in the smaller houses at least indolence had passed into crime. A cry of "Down with them"
broke from the Commons as the report was read. The country however was still far from desiring
the utter downfall of the monastic system, and a long and bitter debate was followed by a compromise
which suppressed all houses whose income fell below £200 a year. Of the thousand religious
houses which then existed in England nearly four hundred were dissolved under this Act and
their revenues granted to the Crown.

[Sidenote: Enslavement of the Clergy]

The secular clergy alone remained; and injunction after injunction from the Vicar-General taught
rector and vicar that they must learn to regard themselves as mere mouthpieces of the royal
will. The Church was gagged. With the instinct of genius Cromwell discerned the part which
the pulpit, as the one means which then existed of speaking to the people at large, was to
play in the religious and political struggle that was at hand; and he resolved to turn it to
the profit of the Monarchy. The restriction of the right of preaching to priests who received
licenses from the Crown silenced every voice of opposition. Even to those who received these
licenses theological controversy was forbidden; and a high-handed process of "tuning the pulpits"
by express directions as to the subject and tenor of each special discourse made the preachers
at every crisis mere means of diffusing the royal will. As a first step in this process every
bishop, abbot, and parish priest was required by the new Vicar-General to preach against the
usurpation of the Papacy and to proclaim the king as supreme Head of the Church on earth. The
very topics of the sermon were carefully prescribed; the bishops were held responsible for
the compliance of the clergy with these orders; and the sheriffs were held responsible for
the obedience of the bishops.

[Sidenote: The Terror]

While the great revolution which struck down the Church was in progress England looked silently
on. In all the earlier ecclesiastical changes, in the contest over the Papal jurisdiction and
Papal exactions, in the reform of the Church courts, even in the curtailment of the legislative
independence of the clergy, the nation as a whole had gone with the king. But from the enslavement
of the priesthood, from the gagging of the pulpits, from the suppression of the monasteries,
the bulk of the nation stood aloof. There were few voices indeed of protest. Before Cromwell's
rise and after his fall from power the reign of Henry the Eighth witnessed no more than the
common tyranny and bloodshed of the time. But the years of Cromwell's administration form the
one period in our history which deserves the name that men have given to the rule of Robespierre.
It was the English Terror. It was by terror that Cromwell mastered the king. Cranmer could
plead for him at a later time with Henry as "one whose surety was only by your Majesty, who
loved your Majesty, as I ever thought, no less than God." But the attitude of Cromwell towards
the king was something more than that of absolute dependence and unquestioning devotion. He
was "so vigilant to preserve your Majesty from all treasons," adds the Primate, "that few could
be so secretly conceived but he detected the same from the beginning." Henry, like every Tudor,
was fearless of open danger, but tremulously sensitive to the lightest breath of hidden disloyalty;
and it was on this dread that Cromwell based the fabric of his power. He was hardly secretary
before spies were scattered broadcast over the land. Secret denunciations poured into the open
ear of the minister. The air was thick with tales of plots and conspiracies, and with the detection
and suppression of each Cromwell tightened his hold on the king.

As it was by terror that he mastered the king, so it was by terror that he mastered the people.
Men felt in England, to use the figure by which Erasmus paints the time, "as if a scorpion
lay sleeping under every stone." The confessional had no secrets for Cromwell. Men's talk with
their closest friends found its way to his ear. "Words idly spoken," the murmurs of a petulant
abbot, the ravings of a moon-struck nun, were, as the nobles cried passionately at his fall,
"tortured into treason." The only chance of safety lay in silence. "Friends who used to write
and send me presents," Erasmus tells us, "now send neither letter nor gifts, nor receive any
from any one, and this through fear." But even the refuge of silence was closed by a law more
infamous than any that has ever blotted the Statute-book of England. Not only was thought made
treason, but men were forced to reveal their thoughts on pain of their very silence being punished
with the penalties of treason. All trust in the older bulwarks of liberty was destroyed by
a policy as daring as it was unscrupulous. The noblest institutions were degraded into instruments
of terror. Though Wolsey had strained the law to the utmost he had made no open attack on the
freedom of justice. If he shrank from assembling Parliaments it was from his sense that they
were the bulwarks of liberty. But under Cromwell the coercion of juries and the management
of judges rendered the courts mere mouthpieces of the royal will: and where even this shadow
of justice proved an obstacle to bloodshed, Parliament was brought into play to pass bill after
bill of attainder. "He shall be judged by the bloody laws he has himself made," was the cry
of the Council at the moment of his fall, and by a singular retribution the crowning injustice
which he sought to introduce even into the practice of attainder, the condemnation of a man
without hearing his defence, was only practised on himself.

[Sidenote: Cromwell's Temper]

But ruthless as was the Terror of Cromwell it was of a nobler type than the Terror of France.
He never struck uselessly or capriciously, or stooped to the meaner victims of the guillotine.
His blows were effective just because he chose his victims from among the noblest and the best.
If he struck at the Church, it was through the Carthusians, the holiest and the most renowned
of English Churchmen. If he struck at the baronage, it was through Lady Salisbury, in whose
veins flowed the blood of kings. If he struck at the New Learning, it was through the murder
of Sir Thomas More. But no personal vindictiveness mingled with his crime. In temper indeed,
so far as we can judge from the few stories which lingered among his friends, he was a generous,
kindly-hearted man, with pleasant and winning manners which atoned for a certain awkwardness
of person, and with a constancy of friendship which won him a host of devoted adherents. But
no touch either of love or hate swayed him from his course. The student of Machiavelli had
not studied the "Prince" in vain. He had reduced bloodshed to a system. Fragments of his papers
still show us with what a business-like brevity he ticked off human lives among the casual
"remembrances" of the day. "Item, the Abbot of Reading to be sent down to be tried and executed
at Reading." "Item, to know the King's pleasure touching Master More." "Item, when Master Fisher
shall go to his execution, and the other." It is indeed this utter absence of all passion,
of all personal feeling, that makes the figure of Cromwell the most terrible in our history.

[Sidenote: Cromwell and More]

The choice of his first victim showed the ruthless precision with which Cromwell was to strike.
In the general opinion of Europe the foremost Englishman of the time was Sir Thomas More. As
the policy of the divorce ended in an open rupture with Rome he had withdrawn silently from
the ministry, but his silent disapproval of the new policy was more telling than the opposition
of obscurer foes. To Cromwell there must have been something specially galling in More's attitude
of reserve. The religious reforms of the New Learning were being rapidly carried out, but it
was plain that the man who represented the very life of the New Learning believed that the
sacrifice of liberty and justice was too dear a price to pay even for religious reform. In
the actual changes which the divorce brought about there was nothing to move More to active
or open opposition. Though he looked on the divorce and re-marriage as without religious warrant,
he found no difficulty in accepting an Act of Succession passed in 1534 which declared the
marriage of Anne Boleyn valid, annulled the title of Catharine's child, Mary, and declared
the children of Anne the only lawful heirs to the crown. His faith in the power of Parliament
over all civil matters was too complete to admit a doubt of its competence to regulate the
succession to the throne. But by the same Act an oath recognizing the succession as then arranged
was ordered to be taken by all persons; and this oath contained an acknowledgement that the
marriage with Catharine was against Scripture and invalid from the beginning. Henry had long
known More's belief on this point; and the summons to take this oath was simply a summons to
death. More was at his house at Chelsea when the summons called him to Lambeth, to the house
where he had bandied fun with Warham and Erasmus or bent over the easel of Holbein. For a moment
there may have been some passing impulse to yield. But it was soon over. Triumphant in all
else, the monarchy was to find its power stop short at the conscience of man. The great battle
of spiritual freedom, the battle of the Protestant against Mary, of the Catholic against Elizabeth,
of the Puritan against Charles, of the Independent against the Presbyterian, began at the moment
when More refused to bend or to deny his convictions at a king's bidding.

[Sidenote: More sent to the Tower]

"I thank the Lord," More said with a sudden start as the boat dropped silently down the river
from his garden steps in the early morning, "I thank the Lord that the field is won." At Lambeth
Cranmer and his fellow-commissioners tendered to him the new oath of allegiance; but, as they
expected, it was refused. They bade him walk in the garden that he might reconsider his reply.
The day was hot and More seated himself in a window from which he could look down into the
crowded court. Even in the presence of death the quick sympathy of his nature could enjoy the
humour and life of the throng below. "I saw," he said afterwards, "Master Latimer very merry
in the court, for he laughed and took one or twain by the neck so handsomely that if they had
been women I should have weened that he waxed wanton." The crowd below was chiefly of priests,
rectors, and vicars, pressing to take the oath that More found harder than death. He bore them
no grudge for it. When he heard the voice of one who was known to have boggled hard at the
oath a little while before calling loudly and ostentatiously for drink, he only noted him with
his peculiar humour. "He drank," More supposed, "either from dryness or from gladness" or "to
show quod ille notus erat Pontifici." He was called in again at last, but only repeated his
refusal. It was in vain that Cranmer plied him with distinctions which perplexed even the subtle
wit of the ex-chancellor; More remained unshaken and passed to the Tower. He was followed there
by Bishop Fisher of Rochester, the most aged and venerable of the English prelates, who was
charged with countenancing treason by listening to the prophecies of a religious fanatic called
"The Nun of Kent." But for the moment even Cromwell shrank from their blood. They remained
prisoners while a new and more terrible engine was devised to crush out the silent but widespread
opposition to the religious changes.

[Sidenote: Death of More]

By a statute passed at the close of 1534 a new treason was created in the denial of the king's
titles; and in the opening of 1535 Henry assumed as we have seen the title of "on earth supreme
head of the Church of England." The measure was at once followed up by a blow at victims hardly
less venerable than More. In the general relaxation of the religious life the charity and devotion
of the brethren of the Charter-house had won the reverence even of those who condemned monasticism.
After a stubborn resistance they had acknowledged the royal Supremacy and taken the oath of
submission prescribed by the Act. But by an infamous construction of the statute which made
the denial of the Supremacy treason, the refusal of satisfactory answers to official questions
as to a conscientious belief in it was held to be equivalent to open denial. The aim of the
new measure was well known, and the brethren prepared to die. In the agony of waiting enthusiasm
brought its imaginative consolations; "when the Host was lifted up there came as it were a
whisper of air which breathed upon our faces as we knelt; and there came a sweet soft sound
of music." They had not long however to wait, for their refusal to answer was the signal for
their doom. Three of the brethren went to the gallows; the rest were flung into Newgate, chained
to posts in a noisome dungeon where, "tied and not able to stir," they were left to perish
of gaol-fever and starvation. In a fortnight five were dead and the rest at the point of death,
"almost despatched," Cromwell's envoy wrote to him, "by the hand of God, of which, considering
their behaviour, I am not sorry." Their death was soon followed by that of More. The interval
of imprisonment had failed to break his resolution, and the new statute sufficed to bring him
to the block. With Fisher he was convicted of denying the king's title as only supreme head
of the Church. The old Bishop approached the scaffold with a book of the New Testament in his
hand. He opened it at a venture ere he knelt, and read, "This is life eternal, to know Thee,
the only true God." In July More followed his fellow-prisoner to the block. Just before the
fatal blow he moved his beard carefully from the reach of the doomsman's axe. "Pity that should
be cut," he was heard to mutter with a touch of the old sad irony, "that has never committed
treason."

[Sidenote: Cromwell and the Nobles]

Cromwell had at last reached his aim. England lay panic-stricken at the feet of the "low-born
knave," as the nobles called him, who represented the omnipotence of the crown. Like Wolsey
he concentrated in his hands the whole administration of the state; he was at once foreign
minister and home minister, and vicar-general of the Church, the creator of a new fleet, the
organizer of armies, the president of the terrible Star Chamber. His Italian indifference to
the mere show of power stood out in strong contrast with the pomp of the Cardinal. Cromwell's
personal habits were simple and unostentatious; if he clutched at money, it was to feed the
army of spies whom he maintained at his own expense, and whose work he surveyed with a ceaseless
vigilance. For his activity was boundless. More than fifty volumes remain of the gigantic mass
of his correspondence. Thousands of letters from "poor bedesmen," from outraged wives and wronged
labourers and persecuted heretics flowed in to the all-powerful minister whose system of personal
government turned him into the universal court of appeal. But powerful as he was, and mighty
as was the work which he had accomplished, he knew that harder blows had to be struck before
his position was secure. The new changes, above all the irritation which had been caused by
the outrages with which the dissolution of the monasteries was accompanied, gave point to the
mutinous temper that prevailed throughout the country; for the revolution in agriculture was
still going on, and evictions furnished embittered outcasts to swell the ranks of any rising.
Nor did it seem as though revolt, if it once broke out, would want leaders to head it. The
nobles who had writhed under the rule of the Cardinal, writhed yet more bitterly under the
rule of one whom they looked upon not only as Wolsey's tool, but as a low-born upstart. "The
world will never mend," Lord Hussey had been heard to say, "till we fight for it." "Knaves
rule about the king!" cried Lord Exeter, "I trust some day to give them a buffet." At this
moment too the hopes of political reaction were stirred by the fate of one whom the friends
of the old order looked upon as the source of all their troubles. In the spring of 1536, while
the dissolution of the monasteries was marking the triumph of the new policy, Anne Boleyn was
suddenly charged with adultery, and sent to the Tower. A few days later she was tried, condemned,
and brought to the block. The queen's ruin was everywhere taken as an omen of ruin to the cause
which had become identified with her own, and the old nobility mustered courage to face the
minister who held them at his feet.

[Sidenote: Pilgrimage of Grace]

They found their opportunity in the discontent of the north, where the monasteries had been
popular, and where the rougher mood of the people turned easily to resistance. In the autumn
of 1536 a rising broke out in Lincolnshire, and this was hardly quelled when all Yorkshire
rose in arms. From every parish the farmers marched with the parish priest at their head upon
York, and the surrender of this city determined the waverers. In a few days Skipton Castle,
where the Earl of Cumberland held out with a handful of men, was the only spot north of the
Humber which remained true to the king. Durham rose at the call of the chiefs of the house
of Neville, Lords Westmoreland and Latimer. Though the Earl of Northumberland feigned sickness,
the Percies joined the revolt. Lord Darcy, the chief of the Yorkshire nobles, surrendered Pomfret,
and was acknowledged as their chief by the insurgents. The whole nobility of the north were
now enlisted in the "Pilgrimage of Grace," as the rising called itself, and thirty thousand
"tall men and well horsed" moved on the Don demanding the reversal of the royal policy, a reunion
with Rome, the restoration of Catharine's daughter, Mary, to her rights as heiress of the Crown,
redress for the wrongs done to the Church, and above all the driving away of base-born councillors,
or in other words, the fall of Cromwell. Though their advance was checked by negotiation, the
organization of the revolt went steadily on throughout the winter, and a Parliament of the
North which gathered at Pomfret formally adopted the demands of the insurgents. Only six thousand
men under Norfolk barred their way southward, and the Midland counties were known to be disaffected.

[Sidenote: Its Suppression]

But Cromwell remained undaunted by the peril. He suffered indeed Norfolk to negotiate; and
allowed Henry under pressure from his Council to promise pardon and a free Parliament at York,
a pledge which Norfolk and Darcy alike construed into an acceptance of the demands made by
the insurgents. Their leaders at once flung aside the badge of the Five Wounds which they had
worn with a cry, "We will wear no badge but that of our Lord the King," and nobles and farmers
dispersed to their homes in triumph. But the towns of the North were no sooner garrisoned and
Norfolk's army in the heart of Yorkshire than the veil was flung aside. A few isolated outbreaks
in the spring of 1537 gave a pretext for the withdrawal of every concession. The arrest of
the leaders of the "Pilgrimage of Grace" was followed by ruthless severities. The country was
covered with gibbets. Whole districts were given up to military execution. But it was on the
leaders of the rising that Cromwell's hand fell heaviest. He seized his opportunity for dealing
at the northern nobles a fatal blow. "Cromwell," one of the chief among them broke fiercely
out as he stood at the Council board, "it is thou that art the very special and chief cause
of all this rebellion and wickedness, and dost daily travail to bring us to our ends and strike
off our heads. I trust that ere thou die, though thou wouldst procure all the noblest heads
within the realm to be stricken off, yet there shall one head remain that shall strike off
thy head." But the warning was unheeded. Lord Darcy, who stood first among the nobles of Yorkshire,
and Lord Hussey, who stood first among the nobles of Lincolnshire, went alike to the block.
The Abbot of Barlings, who had ridden into Lincoln with his canons in full armour, swung with
his brother Abbots of Whalley, Woburn, and Sawley from the gallows. The Abbots of Fountains
and of Jervaulx were hanged at Tyburn side by side with the representative of the great line
of Percy. Lady Bulmer was burned at the stake. Sir Robert Constable was hanged in chains before
the gate of Hull.

[Sidenote: Ireland]

The defeat of the northern revolt showed the immense force which the monarchy had gained. Even
among the rebels themselves not a voice had threatened Henry's throne. It was not at the king
that they aimed these blows, but at the "low-born knaves" who stood about the king. At this
moment too Henry's position was strengthened by the birth of an heir. On the death of Anne
Boleyn he had married Jane Seymour, the daughter of a Wiltshire knight; and in 1537 this queen
died in giving birth to a boy, the future Edward the Sixth. The triumph of the Crown at home
was doubled by its triumph in the great dependency which had so long held the English authority
at bay, across St. George's Channel. Though Henry the Seventh had begun the work of bridling
Ireland he had no strength for exacting a real submission; and the great Norman lords of the
Pale, the Butlers and Geraldines, the De la Poers and the Fitzpatricks, though subjects in
name, remained in fact defiant of the royal authority. In manners and outer seeming they had
sunk into mere natives; their feuds were as incessant as those of the Irish septs; and their
despotism combined the horrors of feudal oppression with those of Celtic anarchy. Crushed by
taxation, by oppression, by misgovernment, plundered alike by native marauders and by the troops
levied to disperse them, the wretched descendants of the first English settlers preferred even
Irish misrule to English "order," and the border of the Pale retreated steadily towards Dublin.
The towns of the seaboard, sheltered by their walls and their municipal self-government, formed
the only exceptions to the general chaos; elsewhere throughout its dominions the English Government,
though still strong enough to break down any open revolt, was a mere phantom of rule. From
the Celtic tribes without the Pale even the remnant of civilization and of native union which
had lingered on to the time of Strongbow had vanished away. The feuds of the Irish septs were
as bitter as their hatred of the stranger; and the Government at Dublin found it easy to maintain
a strife which saved it the necessity of self-defence among a people whose "nature is such
that for money one shall have the son to war against the father, and the father against his
child." During the first thirty years of the sixteenth century the annals of the country which
remained under native rule record more than a hundred raids and battles between clans of the
north alone.

[Sidenote: Ireland and Cromwell]

But the time came at last for a vigorous attempt on the part of England to introduce order
into this chaos of turbulence and misrule. To Henry the Eighth the policy of forbearance, of
ruling Ireland through the great Irish lords, was utterly hateful. His purpose was to rule
in Ireland as thoroughly and effectively as he ruled in England, and during the latter half
of his reign he bent his whole energies to accomplish this aim. From the first hour of his
accession indeed the Irish lords felt the heavier hand of a master. The Geraldines, who had
been suffered under the preceding reign to govern Ireland in the name of the Crown, were quick
to discover that the Crown would no longer stoop to be their tool. Their head, the Earl of
Kildare, was called to England and thrown into the Tower. The great house resolved to frighten
England again into a conviction of its helplessness; and a rising of Lord Thomas Fitzgerald
in 1534 followed the usual fashion of Irish revolts. A murder of the Archbishop of Dublin,
a capture of the city, a repulse before its castle, a harrying of the Pale, ended in a sudden
disappearance of the rebels among the bogs and forests of the border on the advance of the
English forces. It had been usual to meet such an onset as this by a raid of the same character,
by a corresponding failure before the castle of the rebellious noble, and a retreat like his
own which served as a preliminary to negotiations and a compromise. Unluckily for the Fitzgeralds
Henry resolved to take Ireland seriously in hand, and he had Cromwell to execute his will.
Skeffington, a new Lord Deputy who was sent over in 1535, brought with him a train of artillery
which worked a startling change in the political aspect of the island. The castles that had
hitherto sheltered rebellion were battered into ruins. Maynooth, a stronghold from which the
Geraldines threatened Dublin and ruled the Pale at their will, was beaten down in a fortnight.
So crushing and unforeseen was the blow that resistance was at once at an end. Not only was
the power of the great Norman house which had towered over Ireland utterly broken, but only
a single boy was left to preserve its name.

[Sidenote: Conquest of Ireland]

With the fall of the Fitzgeralds Ireland felt itself in a master's grasp. "Irishmen," wrote
one of the Lord Justices to Cromwell, "were never in such fear as now. The king's sessions
are being kept in five shires more than formerly." Not only were the Englishmen of the Pale
at Henry's feet but the kerns of Wicklow and Wexford sent in their submission; and for the
first time in men's memory an English army appeared in Munster and reduced the south to obedience.
The border of the Pale was crossed, and the wide territory where the Celtic tribes had preserved
their independence since the days of the Angevins was trampled into subjection. A castle of
the O'Briens which guarded the passage of the Shannon was taken by assault, and its fall carried
with it the submission of Clare. The capture of Athlone brought about the reduction of Connaught,
and assured the loyalty of the great Norman house of the De Burghs or Bourkes who had assumed
an almost royal authority in the west. The resistance of the tribes of the north was broken
in a victory at Bellahoe. In seven years, partly through the vigour of Skeffington's successor,
Lord Leonard Grey, and still more through the resolute will of Henry and Cromwell, the power
of the Crown, which had been limited to the walls of Dublin, was acknowledged over the length
and breadth of the land.

[Sidenote: Henry's Irish Government]

But submission was far from being all that Henry desired. His aim was to civilize the people
whom he had conquered--to rule not by force but by law. But the only conception of law which
the king or his ministers could frame was that of English law. The customary law which prevailed
without the Pale, the native system of clan government and common tenure of land by the tribe,
as well as the poetry and literature which threw their lustre over the Irish tongue, were either
unknown to the English statesmen or despised by them as barbarous. The one mode of civilizing
Ireland and redressing its chaotic misrule which presented itself to their minds was that of
destroying the whole Celtic tradition of the Irish people--that of "making Ireland English"
in manners, in law, and in tongue. The Deputy, Parliament, Judges, Sheriffs, which already
existed within the Pale, furnished a faint copy of English institutions; and it was hoped that
these might be gradually extended over the whole island. The English language and mode of life
would follow, it was believed, the English law. The one effectual way of bringing about such
a change as this lay in a complete conquest of the island, and in its colonization by English
settlers; but from this course, pressed on him as it was by his own lieutenants and by the
settlers of the Pale, even the iron will of Cromwell shrank. It was at once too bloody and
too expensive. To win over the chiefs, to turn them by policy and a patient generosity into
English nobles, to use the traditional devotion of their tribal dependence as a means of diffusing
the new civilization of their chiefs, to trust to time and steady government for the gradual
reformation of the country, was a policy safer, cheaper, more humane, and more statesmanlike.

It was this system which, even before the fall of the Geraldines, Henry had resolved to adopt;
and it was this that he pressed on Ireland when the conquest laid it at his feet. The chiefs
were to be persuaded of the advantages of justice and legal rule. Their fear of any purpose
to "expel them from their lands and dominions lawfully possessed" was to be dispelled by a
promise "to conserve them as their own." Even their remonstrances against the introduction
of English law were to be regarded, and the course of justice to be enforced or mitigated according
to the circumstances of the country. In the resumption of lands or rights which clearly belonged
to the Crown "sober ways, politic shifts, and amiable persuasions" were to be preferred to
rigorous dealing. It was this system of conciliation which was in the main carried out by the
English Government under Henry and his two successors. Chieftain after chieftain was won over
to the acceptance of the indenture which guaranteed him in the possession of his lands and
left his authority over his tribesmen untouched on condition of a pledge of loyalty, of abstinence
from illegal wars and exactions on his fellow-subjects, and of rendering a fixed tribute and
service in war-time to the Crown. The sole test of loyalty demanded was the acceptance of an
English title and the education of a son at the English court; though in some cases, like that
of the O'Neills, a promise was exacted to use the English language and dress, and to encourage
tillage and husbandry. Compliance with conditions such as these was procured not merely by
the terror of the royal name but by heavy bribes. The chieftains in fact profited greatly by
the change. Not only were the lands of the suppressed abbeys granted to them on their assumption
of their new titles, but the English law-courts, ignoring the Irish custom by which the land
belonged to the tribe at large, regarded the chiefs as the sole proprietors of the soil. The
merits of the system were unquestionable; its faults were such as a statesman of that day could
hardly be expected to perceive. The Tudor politicians held that the one hope for the regeneration
of Ireland lay in its absorbing the civilization of England. The prohibition of the national
dress, customs, laws, and language must have seemed to them merely the suppression of a barbarism
which stood in the way of all improvement.

[Sidenote: Cromwell's Reform of Religion]

With England and Ireland alike at his feet Cromwell could venture on a last and crowning change.
He could claim for the monarchy the right of dictating at its pleasure the form of faith and
doctrine to be taught throughout the land. Henry had remained true to the standpoint of the
New Learning; and the sympathies of Cromwell were mainly with those of his master. They had
no wish for any violent break with the ecclesiastical forms of the past. They desired religious
reform rather than religious revolution, a simplification of doctrine rather than any radical
change in it, the purification of worship rather than the introduction of any wholly new ritual.
Their theology remained, as they believed, a Catholic theology, but a theology cleared of the
superstitious growths which obscured the true Catholicism of the early Church. In a word their
dream was the dream of Erasmus and Colet. The spirit of Erasmus was seen in the Articles of
religion which were laid before Convocation in 1536, in the acknowledgement of Justification
by Faith, a doctrine for which the founders of the New Learning, such as Contarini and Pole,
were struggling at Rome itself, in the condemnation of purgatory, of pardons, and of masses
for the dead, as it was seen in the admission of prayers for the dead and in the retention
of the ceremonies of the church without material change. A series of royal injunctions which
followed carried out the same policy of reform. Pilgrimages were suppressed; the excessive
number of holy days was curtailed; the worship of images and relics was discouraged in words
which seem almost copied from the protest of Erasmus. His appeal for a translation of the Bible
which weavers might repeat at their shuttle and ploughmen sing at their plough received at
last a reply. At the outset of the ministry of Norfolk and More the king had promised an English
version of the scriptures, while prohibiting the circulation of Tyndale's Lutheran translation.
The work however lagged in the hands of the bishops; and as a preliminary measure the Creed,
the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments were now rendered into English, and ordered to
be taught by every schoolmaster and father of a family to his children and pupils. But the
bishops' version still hung on hand; till in despair of its appearance a friend of Archbishop
Cranmer, Miles Coverdale, was employed to correct and revise the translation of Tyndale; and
the Bible which he edited was published in 1538 under the avowed patronage of Henry himself.

[Sidenote: The Lutheran Alliance]

But the force of events was already carrying England far from the standpoint of Erasmus or
More. The dream of the New Learning was to be wrought out through the progress of education
and piety. In the policy of Cromwell reform was to be brought about by the brute force of the
Monarchy. The story of the royal supremacy was graven even on the titlepage of the new Bible.
It is Henry on his throne who gives the sacred volume to Cranmer, ere Cranmer and Cromwell
can distribute it to the throng of priests and laymen below. Hitherto men had looked on religious
truth as a gift from the Church. They were now to look on it as a gift from the king. The very
gratitude of Englishmen for fresh spiritual enlightenment was to tell to the profit of the
royal power. No conception could be further from that of the New Learning, from the plea for
intellectual freedom which runs through the life of Erasmus or the craving for political liberty
which gives nobleness to the speculations of More. Nor was it possible for Henry himself to
avoid drifting from the standpoint he had chosen. He had written against Luther; he had persisted
in opposing Lutheran doctrine; he had passed new laws to hinder the circulation of Lutheran
books in his realm. But influences from without as from within drove him nearer to Lutheranism.
If the encouragement of Francis had done somewhat to bring about his final breach with the
Papacy, he soon found little will in the French king to follow him in any course of separation
from Rome; and the French alliance threatened to become useless as a shelter against the wrath
of the Emperor. Charles was goaded into action by the bill annulling Mary's right of succession;
and in 1535 he proposed to unite his house with that of Francis by close intermarriage and
to sanction Mary's marriage with a son of the French king, if Francis would join in an attack
on England. Whether such a proposal was serious or no, Henry had to dread attack from Charles
himself and to look for new allies against it. He was driven to offer his alliance to the Lutheran
princes of North Germany, who dreaded like himself the power of the Emperor, and who were now
gathering in the League of Schmalkald.

[Sidenote: The Articles of 1536]

But the German Princes made agreement as to doctrine a condition of their alliance; and their
pressure was backed by Henry's partizans among the clergy at home. In Cromwell's scheme for
mastering the priesthood it had been needful to place men on whom the king could rely at their
head. Cranmer became Primate, Latimer became Bishop of Worcester, Shaxton and Barlow were raised
to the sees of Salisbury and St. David's, Hilsey to that of Rochester, Goodrich to that of
Ely, Fox to that of Hereford. But it was hard to find men among the clergy who paused at Henry's
theological resting-place; and of these prelates all except Latimer were known to sympathize
with Lutheranism, though Cranmer lagged far behind his fellows in their zeal for reform. The
influence of these men as well as of an attempt to comply at least partly with the demand of
the German Princes left its stamp on the Articles of 1536. For the principle of Catholicism,
of a universal form of faith overspreading all temporal dominions, the Lutheran states had
substituted the principle of territorial religion, of the right of each sovereign or people
to determine the form of belief which should be held within their bounds. The severance from
Rome had already brought Henry to this principle; and the Act of Supremacy was its emphatic
assertion. In England too, as in North Germany, the repudiation of the Papal authority as a
ground of faith, of the voice of the Pope as a declaration of truth, had driven men to find
such a ground and declaration in the Bible; and the Articles expressly based the faith of the
Church of England on the Bible and the three Creeds. With such fundamental principles of agreement
it was possible to borrow from the Augsburg Confession five of the ten articles which Henry
laid before the Convocation. If penance was still retained as a sacrament, baptism and the
Lord's Supper were alone maintained to be sacraments with it; the doctrine of Transubstantiation
which Henry stubbornly maintained differed so little from the doctrine maintained by Luther
that the words of Lutheran formularies were borrowed to explain it; Confession was admitted
by the Lutheran Churches as well as by the English. The veneration of saints and the doctrine
of prayer to them, though still retained, was so modified as to present little difficulty even
to a Lutheran.

[Sidenote: The Irish Churches]

However disguised in form, the doctrinal advance made in the Articles of 1536 was an immense
one; and a vehement opposition might have been looked for from those of the bishops like Gardiner,
who while they agreed with Henry's policy of establishing a national Church remained opposed
to any change in faith. But the Articles had been drawn up by Henry's own hand, and all whisper
of opposition was hushed. Bishops, abbots, clergy, not only subscribed to them, but carried
out with implicit obedience the injunctions which put their doctrine roughly into practice;
and the failure of the Pilgrimage of Grace in the following autumn ended all thought of resistance
among the laity. But Cromwell found a different reception for his reforms when he turned to
extend them to the sister island. The religious aspect of Ireland was hardly less chaotic than
its political aspect had been. Ever since Strongbow's landing there had been no one Irish Church,
simply because there had been no one Irish nation. There was not the slightest difference in
doctrine or discipline between the Church without the Pale and the Church within it. But within
the Pale the clergy were exclusively of English blood and speech, and without it they were
exclusively of Irish. Irishmen were shut out by law from abbeys and churches within the English
boundary, and the ill-will of the natives shut out Englishmen from churches and abbeys outside
it. As to the religious state of the country, it was much on a level with its political condition.
Feuds and misrule told fatally on ecclesiastical discipline. The bishops were political officers,
or hard fighters like the chiefs around them; their sees were neglected, their cathedrals abandoned
to decay. Through whole dioceses the churches lay in ruins and without priests. The only preaching
done in the country was done by the begging friars, and the results of the friars' preaching
were small. "If the King do not provide a remedy," it was said in 1525, "there will be no more
Christentie than in the middle of Turkey."

[Sidenote: Ireland and the Supremacy]

Unfortunately the remedy which Henry provided was worse than the disease. Politically Ireland
was one with England, and the great revolution which was severing the one country from the
Papacy extended itself naturally to the other. The results of it indeed at first seemed small
enough. The Supremacy, a question which had convulsed England, passed over into Ireland to
meet its only obstacle in a general indifference. Everybody was ready to accept it without
a thought of the consequences. The bishops and clergy within the Pale bent to the king's will
as easily as their fellows in England, and their example was followed by at least four prelates
of dioceses without the Pale. The native chieftains made no more scruple than the Lords of
the Council in renouncing obedience to the Bishop of Rome, and in acknowledging Henry as the
"Supreme Head of the Church of England and Ireland under Christ." There was none of the resistance
to the dissolution of the abbeys which had been witnessed on the other side of the Channel,
and the greedy chieftains showed themselves perfectly willing to share the plunder of the Church.
But the results of the measure were fatal to the little culture and religion which even the
past centuries of disorder had spared. Such as they were, the religious houses were the only
schools that Ireland contained. The system of vicars, so general in England, was rare in Ireland;
churches in the patronage of the abbeys were for the most part served by the religious themselves,
and the dissolution of their houses suspended public worship over large districts of the country.
The friars, hitherto the only preachers, and who continued to labour and teach in spite of
the efforts of the Government, were thrown necessarily into a position of antagonism to the
English rule.

[Sidenote: Ireland and the Religious Changes]

Had the ecclesiastical changes which were forced on the country ended here however, in the
end little harm would have been done. But in England the breach with Rome, the destruction
of the monastic orders, and the establishment of the Supremacy, had roused in a portion of
the people itself a desire for theological change which Henry shared and was cautiously satisfying.
In Ireland the spirit of the Reformation never existed among the people at all. They accepted
the legislative measures passed in the English Parliament without any dream of theological
consequences or of any change in the doctrine or ceremonies of the Church. Not a single voice
demanded the abolition of pilgrimages, or the destruction of images, or the reform of public
worship. The mission of Archbishop Browne in 1535 "for the plucking down of idols and extinguishing
of idolatry" was a first step in the long effort of the English Government to force a new faith
on a people who to a man clung passionately to their old religion. Browne's attempts at "tuning
the pulpits" were met by a sullen and significant opposition. "Neither by gentle exhortation,"
the Archbishop wrote to Cromwell, "nor by evangelical instruction, neither by oath of them
solemnly taken, nor yet by threats of sharp correction may I persuade or induce any whether
religious or secular since my coming over once to preach the Word of God nor the just title
of our illustrious Prince." Even the acceptance of the Supremacy, which had been so quietly
effected, was brought into question when its results became clear. The bishops abstained from
compliance with the order to erase the Pope's name out of their mass-books. The pulpits remained
steadily silent. When Browne ordered the destruction of the images and relics in his own cathedral,
he had to report that the prior and canons "find them so sweet for their gain that they heed
not my words." Cromwell however was resolute for a religious uniformity between the two islands,
and the Primate borrowed some of his patron's vigour. Recalcitrant priests were thrown into
prison, images were plucked down from the rood-loft, and the most venerable of Irish relics,
the staff of St. Patrick, was burned in the market-place. But he found no support in his vigour
save from across the Channel. The Irish Council looked coldly on; even the Lord Deputy still
knelt to say prayers before an image at Trim. A sullen dogged opposition baffled Cromwell's
efforts, and their only result was to unite all Ireland against the Crown.

[Sidenote: The English Protestants]

But Cromwell found it easier to deal with Irish inaction than with the feverish activity which
his reforms stirred in England itself. It was impossible to strike blow after blow at the Church
without rousing wild hopes in the party who sympathized with the work which Luther was doing
over-sea. Few as these "Lutherans" or "Protestants" still were in numbers, their new hopes
made them a formidable force; and in the school of persecution they had learned a violence
which delighted in outrages on the faith which had so long trampled them under foot. At the
very outset of Cromwell's changes four Suffolk youths broke into a church at Dovercourt, tore
down a wonder-working crucifix, and burned it in the fields. The suppression of the lesser
monasteries was the signal for a new outburst of ribald insult to the old religion. The roughness,
insolence, and extortion of the Commissioners sent to effect it drove the whole monastic body
to despair. Their servants rode along the road with copes for doublets or tunicles for saddle-cloths,
and scattered panic among the larger houses which were left. Some sold their jewels and relics
to provide for the evil day they saw approaching. Some begged of their own will for dissolution.
It was worse when fresh ordinances of the Vicar-General ordered the removal of objects of superstitious
veneration. Their removal, bitter enough to those whose religion twined itself around the image
or the relic which was taken away, was embittered yet more by the insults with which it was
accompanied. A miraculous rood at Boxley, which bowed its head and stirred its eyes, was paraded
from market to market and exhibited as a juggle before the Court. Images of the Virgin were
stripped of their costly vestments and sent to be publicly burned at London. Latimer forwarded
to the capital the figure of Our Lady, which he had thrust out of his cathedral church at Worcester,
with rough words of scorn: "She with her old sister of Walsingham, her younger sister of Ipswich,
and their two other sisters of Doncaster and Penrice, would make a jolly muster at Smithfield."
Fresh orders were given to fling all relics from their reliquaries, and to level every shrine
with the ground. In 1538 the bones of St. Thomas of Canterbury were torn from the stately shrine
which had been the glory of his metropolitan church, and his name was erased from the service-books
as that of a traitor.

The introduction of the English Bible into churches gave a new opening for the zeal of the
Protestants. In spite of royal injunctions that it should be read decently and without comment,
the young zealots of the party prided themselves on shouting it out to a circle of excited
hearers during the service of mass, and accompanied their reading with violent expositions.
Protestant maidens took the new English primer to church with them and studied it ostentatiously
during matins. Insult passed into open violence when the Bishops' Courts were invaded and broken
up by Protestant mobs; and law and public opinion were outraged at once when priests who favoured
the new doctrines began openly to bring home wives to their vicarages. A fiery outburst of
popular discussion compensated for the silence of the pulpits. The new Scriptures, in Henry's
bitter words of complaint, were "disputed, rimed, sung, and jangled in every tavern and alehouse."
The articles which dictated the belief of the English Church roused a furious controversy.
Above all, the Sacrament of the Mass, the centre of the Catholic system of faith and worship,
and which still remained sacred to the bulk of Englishmen, was attacked with a scurrility and
profaneness which passes belief. The doctrine of Transubstantiation, which was as yet recognized
by law, was held up to scorn in ballads and mystery plays. In one church a Protestant lawyer
raised a dog in his hands when the priest elevated the Host. The most sacred words of the old
worship, the words of consecration, "Hoc est corpus," were travestied into a nickname for jugglery
as "Hocus-pocus."

[Sidenote: The Six Articles]

It was by this attack on the Mass, even more than by the other outrages, that the temper both
of Henry and the nation was stirred to a deep resentment. With the Protestants Henry had no
sympathy whatever. He was a man of the New Learning; he was proud of his orthodoxy and of his
title of Defender of the Faith. And above all he shared to the utmost his people's love of
order, their clinging to the past, their hatred of extravagance and excess. The first sign
of reaction was seen in the Parliament of 1539. Never had the Houses shown so little care for
political liberty. The Monarchy seemed to free itself from all parliamentary restrictions whatever
when a formal statute gave the king's proclamations the force of parliamentary laws. Nor did
the Church find favour with them. No word of the old opposition was heard when a bill was introduced
granting to the king the greater monasteries which had been saved in 1536. More than six hundred
religious houses fell at a blow, and so great was the spoil that the king promised never again
to call on his people for subsidies. But the Houses were equally at one in withstanding the
new innovations in religion, and an act for "abolishing diversity of opinions in certain articles
concerning Christian religion" passed with general assent. On the doctrine of Transubstantiation,
which was reasserted by the first of six Articles to which the Act owes its usual name, there
was no difference of feeling or belief between the men of the New Learning and the older Catholics.
But the road to a further instalment of even moderate reform seemed closed by the five other
articles which sanctioned communion in one kind, the celibacy of the clergy, monastic vows,
private masses, and auricular confession. A more terrible feature of the reaction was the revival
of persecution. Burning was denounced as the penalty for a denial of transubstantiation; on
a second offence it became the penalty for an infraction of the other five doctrines. A refusal
to confess or to attend Mass was made felony. It was in vain that Cranmer, with the five bishops
who partially sympathized with the Protestants, struggled against the bill in the Lords: the
Commons were "all of one opinion," and Henry himself acted as spokesman on the side of the
articles. In London alone five hundred Protestants were indicted under the new act. Latimer
and Shaxton were imprisoned, and the former forced into a resignation of his see. Cranmer himself
was only saved by Henry's personal favour.

[Sidenote: Cromwell's last Struggle]

But the first burst of triumph was no sooner spent than the hand of Cromwell made itself felt.
Though his opinions remained those of the New Learning and differed little from the general
sentiment which found itself represented in the act, he leaned instinctively to the one party
which did not long for his fall. His wish was to restrain the Protestant excesses, but he had
no mind to ruin the Protestants. In a little time therefore the bishops were quietly released.
The London indictments were quashed. The magistrates were checked in their enforcement of the
law, while a general pardon cleared the prisons of the heretics who had been arrested under
its provisions. A few months after the enactment of the Six Articles we find from a Protestant
letter that persecution had wholly ceased, "the Word is powerfully preached and books of every
kind may safely be exposed for sale." Never indeed had Cromwell shown such greatness as in
his last struggle against Fate. "Beknaved" by the king, whose confidence in him waned as he
discerned the full meaning of the religious changes which Cromwell had brought about, met too
by a growing opposition in the Council as his favour declined, the temper of the man remained
indomitable as ever. He stood absolutely alone. Wolsey, hated as he had been by the nobles,
had been supported by the Church; but Churchmen hated Cromwell with an even fiercer hate than
the nobles themselves. His only friends were the Protestants, and their friendship was more
fatal than the hatred of his foes. But he showed no signs of fear or of halting in the course
he had entered on. So long as Henry supported him, however reluctant his support might be,
he was more than a match for his foes. He was strong enough to expel his chief opponent, Bishop
Gardiner of Winchester, from the royal Council. He met the hostility of the nobles with a threat
which marked his power. "If the lords would handle him so, he would give them such a breakfast
as never was made in England, and that the proudest of them should know."

[Sidenote: The Courtenays and the Poles]

He soon gave a terrible earnest of the way in which he could fulfil his threat. The opposition
to his system gathered above all round two houses which represented what yet lingered of the
Yorkist tradition, the Courtenays and the Poles. Courtenay, the Marquis of Exeter, was of royal
blood, a grandson through his mother of Edward the Fourth. He was known to have bitterly denounced
the "knaves that ruled about the King"; and his threats to "give them some day a buffet" were
formidable in the mouth of one whose influence in the western counties was supreme. Margaret,
the Countess of Salisbury, a daughter of the Duke of Clarence by the heiress of the Earl of
Warwick, and a niece of Edward the Fourth, had married Sir Richard Pole, and became mother
of Lord Montacute as of Sir Geoffry and Reginald Pole. The temper of her house might be guessed
from the conduct of the younger of the three brothers. After refusing the highest favours from
Henry as the price of his approval of the divorce, Reginald Pole had taken refuge at Rome,
where he had bitterly attacked the king in a book on "The Unity of the Church." "There may
be found ways enough in Italy," Cromwell wrote to him in significant words, "to rid a treacherous
subject. When Justice can take no place by process of law at home, sometimes she may be enforced
to take new means abroad." But he had left hostages in Henry's hands. "Pity that the folly
of one witless fool," Cromwell wrote ominously, "should be the ruin of so great a family. Let
him follow ambition as fast as he can, those that little have offended (saving that he is of
their kin), were it not for the great mercy and benignity of the prince, should and might feel
what it is to have such a traitor as their kinsman." The "great mercy and benignity of the
prince" was no longer to shelter them. In 1538 the Pope, Paul the Third, published a bull of
excommunication and deposition against Henry, and Pole pressed the Emperor vigorously though
ineffectually to carry the bull into execution. His efforts only brought about, as Cromwell
had threatened, the ruin of his house. His brother Lord Montacute and the Marquis of Exeter,
with other friends of the two great families, were arrested on a charge of treason and executed
in the opening of 1539, while the Countess of Salisbury was attainted in Parliament and sent
to the Tower.

[Sidenote: The Lutheran Marriage]

Almost as terrible an act of bloodshed closed the year. The abbots of Glastonbury, Reading,
and Colchester, men who had sate as mitred abbots among the lords, were charged with a denial
of the king's supremacy and hanged as traitors. But Cromwell relied for success on more than
terror. His single will forced on a scheme of foreign policy whose aim was to bind England
to the cause of the Reformation while it bound Henry helplessly to his minister. The daring
boast which his enemies laid afterwards to Cromwell's charge, whether uttered or not, is but
the expression of his system, "In brief time he would bring things to such a pass that the
King with all his power should not be able to hinder him." His plans rested, like the plan
which proved fatal to Wolsey, on a fresh marriage of his master. Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour,
had died in childbirth; and in the opening of 1540 Cromwell replaced her by a German consort,
Anne of Cleves, a sister-in-law of the Lutheran Elector of Saxony. He dared even to resist
Henry's caprice when the king revolted on their first interview from the coarse features and
unwieldy form of his new bride. For the moment Cromwell had brought matters "to such a pass"
that it was impossible to recoil from the marriage, and the minister's elevation to the Earldom
of Essex seemed to proclaim his success. The marriage of Anne of Cleves however was but the
first step in a policy which, had it been carried out as he designed it, would have anticipated
the triumphs of Richelieu. Charles and the House of Austria could alone bring about a Catholic
reaction strong enough to arrest and roll back the Reformation; and Cromwell was no sooner
united with the princes of North Germany than he sought to league them with France for the
overthrow of the Emperor.

[Sidenote: Fall of Cromwell]

Had he succeeded, the whole face of Europe would have been changed, Southern Germany would
have been secured for Protestantism, and the Thirty Years War averted. But he failed as men
failed who stand ahead of their age. The German princes shrank from a contest with the Emperor,
France from a struggle which would be fatal to Catholicism; and Henry, left alone to bear the
resentment of the House of Austria and chained to a wife he loathed, turned savagely on his
minister. In June the long struggle came to an end. The nobles sprang on Cromwell with a fierceness
that told of their long-hoarded hate. Taunts and execrations burst from the Lords at the Council
table as the Duke of Norfolk, who had been entrusted with the minister's arrest, tore the ensign
of the Garter from his neck. At the charge of treason Cromwell flung his cap on the ground
with a passionate cry of despair. "This then," he exclaimed, "is my guerdon for the services
I have done! On your consciences, I ask you, am I a traitor?" Then with a sudden sense that
all was over he bade his foes make quick work, and not leave him to languish in prison. Quick
work was made. A few days after his arrest he was attainted in Parliament, and at the close
of July a burst of popular applause hailed his death on the scaffold.
