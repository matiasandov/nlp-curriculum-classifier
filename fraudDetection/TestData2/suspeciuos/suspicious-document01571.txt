                               PREFACE.

In No 216 of “The Medical Record” (Dec. 15th, 1874) was published an article written by me,
entitled “On some of the Uses of Galvanic and Faradic Baths.”

The interest manifested in the subject, as evidenced by numerous letters of inquiry since received
from physicians in almost all parts of the United States, and some in Europe, has induced me
to write the present treatise, in which I have endeavored to present to the profession, as
far as lies in my power, all that is necessary to a full comprehension of the electro-balneological
treatment.

When it is considered that in the employment of electric baths I have been to a great extent
groping in the dark, that I have been deprived of the advantage of having the experience of
others to guide me, it will not appear surprising that I should have met with many disappointments.
My failures have been illustrative of the fact that the electric bath is no more a panacea
for all ills than any other remedial agent. Applicable as it is to a great variety of pathological
conditions, it meets with many where it is destined to have negative or at best imperfect results.
Far from discouraging me, however, failures have served to inspire me with fresh ardor to seek
for light, and to persevere in my efforts to establish on the basis of statistical truth, the
therapeutic merits of the agent which I employed.

In view of the imperfectness of the results thus far obtained, I should consider the present
work premature, did I not find a justification for it in my desire to induce other and abler
observers to investigate the subject, and place it on whatever footing it may merit.

To say that I am fully conscious of the shortcomings of my work, would be but feebly to express
my convictions in this respect. I beg the reader however to consider that the subject is not
a hackneyed one, that mine has not been the work of the compiler who remodels the brain-work
of others. It may be crude and rough, it may lack the gloss and polish that is the result of
much handling, but I have at least the consciousness that it has the merits of originality
and candor.

                              CHAPTER I.

                            THE APPARATUS. 

                                                                  I did speak to her the other day when Mr. Layard wished to marry her,
a match I was naturally anxious for, but the results were not satisfactory."

"Still,

I think you might try."

                              "Very well, I will try; and, Colonel Monk, I cannot tell you how grieved
I am to have brought all this trouble on you."

                             

                        "Not a bit," answered the Colonel cheerfully.

"I am an old student of human nature, and I rather enjoy it; it's like watching the puppets on
a stage. Only we mustn't let the comedy grow into a tragedy."

"Ah! that's what I am afraid of, some tragedy. Stella is a woman who takes things hard, and if any affection
really has sprung up----"

                              

                 

"----It will no doubt evaporate with the usual hysterics and morning headache. Bless me! I have known
dozens of them, and felt some myself in my time--the headaches, I mean, not the other things. Don't be
alarmed if she gets angry, Mr. Fregelius, but just appeal to her
reason; she will see the force of it afterwards."

                              

               An hour or so later the Colonel started for a walk on the beach to
look at some damage which a high tide had done to the cliff. As he
was nearing the Abbey steps on his return he saw the figure of a woman
standing quite still upon the sands. An inspection through his eyeglass
revealed that it was Stella, and instinct told him her errand.

"This
is rather awkward," he thought, as he braced himself to battle, "especially
as I like that girl and don't want to hurt her feelings. Hullo! Miss
Fregelius, are you taking the air?

                          THE ELECTRIC BATH.

                              CHAPTER I.

                            THE APPARATUS.

To a proper comprehension of the succeeding chapters, it is necessary first of all to be familiar
with the apparatus employed in carrying out electro-balneological treatment, and I therefore
proceed to give a description of this.[1] It may conveniently be divided as follows, viz.

    a. The tub;

    b. The electrodes and connections;

    c. The water;

    d. Chemicals;

    e. The batteries.

(a) The Tub. This must be made of a non-conducting material. Of substances that will answer,
I will mention: wood, porcelain, soapstone, vulcanized rubber, or glass. In choosing one of
these materials, regard should be had to the facility of attaching the electrodes. In this
respect wood deserves the preference over all the others mentioned. Where economy is to be
studied, it has a further item in its favor.

The tubs, which I have now in use for nearly three years are made of wood, and I find them
to answer very well. It must not be forgotten, however, that a wooden tub requires to be well
painted on the inside, in order to prevent its becoming water-soaked, because in that event
it would become a conductor of electricity, and interfere to some extent, with the administration
of the electric current in the bath.

The shape and size of the tub may be the same as those of an ordinary bath tub. To suit individual
cases however, its length may be made to vary. The only peculiarity in its construction is
at the head. Here, instead of slanting, it is made square, and the slightly concave (from side
to side) board against which the back of the bather is to rest, is fitted in afterwards. This
is necessary, because it is very difficult to make a wooden tub with a slanting back water-tight.
If the length of the tub from outside to outside is made to measure about five feet ten inches,
the back-rest fitted in at a proper slant will bring the inside of the tub to about the right
length for an average male adult. All around the upper edge of the tub runs a wooden coping,
which must not be fastened down however until all the attachments for conducting the current
are in situ. Along that portion of the top of the tub where required—and this will depend on
the situation of the binding posts presently to be mentioned—and underneath the coping, runs
a groove for the reception of the wires that are to connect the carbon electrodes on the inside
of the tub with the binding posts on the outside. This groove is continued vertically along
the inside of the back-rest and foot of the tub respectively, to communicate at either end
with the bed for the reception of the carbon plates. These vertical grooves should at their
lower end be a little over ¼ inch deep, in order to admit of the wires being introduced beneath
the carbons.

The face of the foot of the tub and that of the back-rest, should have in their centres (from
side to side) and commencing at about five inches from the bottom of the tub, a bed for the
reception of the carbons. The dimensions of these receptacles must of course correspond to
those of the carbon plates to be employed as electrodes. Those which I use measure 12×8″ at
the head, 8×6″ at the foot of the tub. They are ¼″ thick. They are placed so as to have their
long diameter correspond to the height of the tub. The bed which is to receive the carbon at
the head of the tub must be deeper than ¼″ on account of the concavity of the back-rest.

In order to adapt a tub to individuals of different lengths, it will be found advantageous
to have two small vertical cleats on each side of the tub, near the foot and bottom, for the
reception of a foot-board, which will practically shorten the tub and adapt it to persons of
different lengths. This board may conveniently be six inches wide, and should have a number
of perforations about an inch in diameter, for the transmission of the current to the feet.
1¼″ pine plank is the most suitable wood to use in the construction of the tub. This is preferable
to any of the hard woods, because of the greater facility of fitting in the electrodes etc.
It is also the most economical.

(b) The electrodes and connections. These consist of two carbon plates, two brass binding posts,
and insulated wires to connect the carbons with the binding posts, and these with the battery.
The carbons are such as are ordinarily employed in the construction of galvanic batteries,
and can, as well as the wire and binding posts, be procured from any house that deals in telegraph
material. Their size is to some extent optional; the dimensions I have given above however
answer very well.

The inside of the tub having received one or preferably two coats of paint, the carbons are
now fitted in the receptacles provided for them. The next step is the attaching of the binding
posts. These should be of the kind known as “single” binding posts with “wood screws.” The
most convenient location for them will be found on the coping covering the horizontal portion
at the head of the tub. Here the coping, as it has to cover not only the upper edge of the
head of the tub, but that of the back-rest also, is of necessity much wider than at any other
portion, and thus affords most room for the binding posts.

Having marked out then a site for the binding posts, say in the centre of the coping at the
head of the tub—which should now be placed in position—and about two inches apart, the posts
are laid aside to be put in place when the wires are all in situ, and the coping fastened down.

In order to facilitate the description of the placing of the wires by means of which communication
is to be established between the electrodes and the binding posts, I shall term the end of
the wire that is to be attached to the electrodes the distal, that which is attached to the
binding posts the proximal end. A gimlet hole sufficiently large to admit of the passage of
one wire should be made half an inch outwards from the centre of the site of each binding post.
The best wire to use is about No. 16 copper wire, coated with gutta percha or rubber. The site
of the posts being as above suggested, it will be found that the wire which is to connect the
head electrode with one post requires to be about 18 inches long, that which runs from the
other post to the foot-electrode, between eight and nine feet. The distal ends of the wires
should be stripped of their coating for a length of about three inches, the proximal ends for
about two inches. The denuded portion of the distal ends should be rolled up in the form of
a spiral coil; this will insure their constant impinging on the carbons more certainly than
could be expected from a simple straight end of wire.

The carbons having now been fitted in their beds, the distal end (coil) of the head wire is
placed beneath the carbon, and the wire itself continued up along the vertical groove to either
one of the gimlet holes. Through this, from within outward, the proximal end of the wire is
now drawn and left for the present. The distal end of the second wire having now been placed
beneath the carbon at the foot of the tub, this wire is continued up through the vertical groove,
along the upper edge of the foot of the tub to the side nearest the binding post to which the
wire is to be attached, along the groove on the upper edge of this side to the head of the
tub, and thence to the respective gimlet hole, and through this, from within outward. The wires
being now all in position, all the coping is next screwed or nailed down firmly, care being
taken that the screws or nails used for this purpose do not injure any of the wires. The coping
fastened down, the binding posts are now screwed down in the sites previously marked out for
them. Before they are screwed entirely down, the denuded portion of the proximal end of each
wire is securely wound around the screw of the respective binding post, and the posts are then
firmly screwed down, holding the proximal ends of the wires in place. Connection is now established
between the binding posts and the head and foot electrodes respectively. The vertical grooves
are now to be filled in with putty and painted over, care being taken to keep the carbon free
from paint. The last step towards completing the apparatus is to fasten the carbons in their
beds. The simplest way of doing this is by stretching over each carbon a piece of muslin, folded
double, and tacking this down around the edges. Zinc or galvanized iron tacks are best. Copper
tacks should be avoided on account of their superior conductivity.

In order to be able when required to localize the current in special portions of the body,
it is well to be provided with what I have termed a “surface board.” This is a piece of black
walnut, say 14 in. long by 5 in. wide, ¾ thick, having in the centre a bed to accommodate a
carbon plate, say 5 in. long by 2 in. wide, ¼ thick. From the centre of this bed a gimlet hole
pierces the board. The denuded end of an insulated wire is drawn through this gimlet hole from
without inward (toward the bed) and twisted in the form of a spiral to prevent its slipping
back, as well as to insure its more certain connection with the carbon. The carbon is now placed
in the bed, and kept there by a piece of muslin drawn over it and tacked down. The wire should
be of sufficient length to reach the battery. I shall speak further on of the use to be made
of the surface board.

c) The Water. The quantity of water may be the same as that in an ordinary bath. Is she living?"

"Oh,
no. She died a great many years ago. The old gentleman has only one child left--a girl."

"What is her name?" asked someone idly, in a break of the general conversation, so that everybody
paused to listen to his reply.

"Stella--Stella Fregelius; a very unusual girl."

Then the conversation broke out again with renewed vigour, and all
that those at Morris's end of the table could catch were snatches
such as: "Wonderful eyes"; "Independent young person"; "Well read
and musical"; "Oh, yes! poor as church mice, that's why he accepted
my offer."

At this point the Doctor began a rather vehement argument with Mr.
Porson as to the advisability of countervailing duties to force foreign
nations to abandon the sugar bounties, and no more was heard of Mr.
Tomley and his plans. Where these are added to the water of the bath, it is for one of three purposes:
viz. 1)—To exercise a direct therapeutic influence on the patient, either internally by being
absorbed, or externally by their action on the skin; 2)—Through chemical affinity to aid in
eliminating certain metallic substances from the body; or 3)—To further the absorption of morbid
deposits. The various indications in these respects will be treated of in their proper places.

e) The Batteries. In the choice of this, the most important part of the electro-balneological
apparatus, the greatest circumspection is necessary. Inferior instruments and such as are liable
to get out of order frequently, have time and again been the means of discouraging the beginner
in electro-therapeutics, and causing him to abandon the study of an art, the pursuit of which
would have well repaid him for all his labor. Fortunately our manufacturers here in New York
turn out very good instruments, and if a physician purchases an inferior one, the fault is his own.

Two different currents are required for the baths, viz. 1)—The galvanic, which may be employed
either in the constant or interrupted (by means of a rheotome) form; and 2)—the faradic or
induced current. Several manufacturers of this city turn out good and serviceable faradic instruments.
Those which I have been in the habit of using for some years past are manufactured by the Galvano-Faradic
Manufacturing Company, and they have given me unvarying satisfaction. By means of a recently
introduced attachment to their batteries, termed the “fine adjustment,” a current of exquisite
“fineness” (rapidity of interruption) is obtained, thus removing the only inferiority that
has heretofore distinguished American from the best imported instruments. The instrument is
very easy of management, and its liability to get out of order very small.

As however the galvanic current is of vastly greater importance in a therapeutic respect, than
the faradic, so also much greater care is required in the choice of a galvanic than a faradic
battery. In making choice of a galvanic battery, we have to consider its relative quantity,
intensity, constancy, permanency, economy of running expenses, and facility of management.
We cannot be guided here by the same considerations that guide us in the choice of a battery
for office use, where the séances are usually brief and the elements taxed not nearly so much
as in the administration of baths. It is not within the scope of this work to enter into a
description of the various galvanic batteries that are in use. Neither do I believe that, in
a therapeutic sense, there is much difference between the various batteries ordinarily found
described in text-books on electro-therapeutics.

Where the battery is to be stationary, a zinc-copper battery, such as the Hill battery for
example, is preferable both on account of its constancy and the economy of running it. Of this
there should be fully sixty cells, communicating with the bath through a current selector,
by means of which the current from any desired number of cells can be obtained. The electro-susceptibility
of different individuals varies to such an extent that this is absolutely necessary. Where
a portable battery is desired, the Stöhrer zinc-carbon battery will be found the most useful.

I have mentioned these two batteries simply because I have them in use, and they give me satisfaction.
There are many others, however, that will answer equally well. On the whole, any battery possessing
quantity and intensity in a medium degree will answer. 

    If the Lord of spirits can weigh the "dust whereof we are made" and
still be merciful, shall his bright messengers trample it in scorn
and hate?

    Will they not also consider the longings of the heart and its
    uprightness, and be pitiful towards the failings of the flesh?
