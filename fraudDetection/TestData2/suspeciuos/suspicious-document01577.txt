THE INTRINSIC NATURE AND VALUE OF LEARNING, AND ITS INFLUENCE UPON LABOR.

[Lecture before the American Institute of Instruction.]

Words and terms have, to different minds, various significations; and we often find definitions
changing in the progress of events. Bailey says learning is "skill in languages or sciences."
To this, Walker adds what he calls "literature," and "skill in anything, good or bad." Dr.
Webster enlarges the meaning of the word still more, and says, "Learning is the knowledge of
principles or facts received by instruction or study; acquired knowledge or ideas in any branch
of science or literature; erudition; literature; science; knowledge acquired by experience,
experiment, or observation." Milton gives us a rhetorical definition in a negative form, which
is of equal value, at least, with any authority yet cited.

This is kindred to the saying of Locke, that "men of much reading are greatly learned, but
may be little knowing." We must give to the term learning a broad definition, if we accept
Milton's statement that its end "is to repair the ruins of our first parents by regaining to
know God aright;" for this necessarily implies that we are to study carefully everything relating
to the nature of our existence, to the spot and scene of our existence, with its mysterious
phenomena, and its comparatively unexplained laws. And we must, moreover, always keep in view
the personal relations and duties which the Creator has imposed upon the members of the human
race. The knowledge of these relations and duties is one form of learning; the disposition
and the ability to observe and practise these relations and duties, is another and a higher
form of learning. The first is the learning of the theologian, the schoolman; the latter is
the learning of the practical Christian. Both ought to exist; but when they are separated,
we place things above signs, facts above forms, life above ideas. Law and justice ought always
to be united; but when by error, or fraud, or usurpation, they are separated, we observe the
forms of law, but we respect the principles of justice. This is a good illustration of the
principles which guide to a true distinction in the forms of learning. Of all the definitions
enumerated, we must give to the word learning the broadest signification. It is safe to accept
the statement of the great poet, that a man may be acquainted with many languages, and yet
not be learned; even as the apostle said he should become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal,
if he had not charity, though he spoke with the tongues of men and angels. Learning includes,
no doubt, a knowledge of the languages, the sciences, and all literature; but it includes also
much else; and this much else may be more important than the enumerated branches. The term
learned has been limited, usually, by exclusive application to the schoolmen; but it is a matter
of doubt, especially in this country, upon the broad definition laid down, whether there is
more learning in the schools, or out of them. This remark, if true, is no reflection upon the
schools, but much in favor of the world. Those were dark ages when learning was confined to
the schools; and, though we can never be too grateful for their existence, and the fidelity
with which they preserved the knowledge of other days, that is surely a higher attainment in
the life of the race, when the learning of the world exceeds the learning of the cloister,
the school, and the college.

In a private conversation, Professor Guyot made a remark which seems to have a public value.
"You give to your schools," said he, "credit that is really due to the world. Looking at America
with the eye of an European, it appears to me that your world is doing more and your schools
are doing less, in the cause of education, than you are inclined to believe." For one, though
I ought, as much as any, to stand for the schools, I give a qualified assent to the truth of
this observation. There is much learning among us which we cannot trace directly to the schools;
but the schools have introduced and fostered a spirit which has given to the world the power
to make itself learned. It is much easier to disseminate what is called the spirit of education,
than it was to create that spirit, and preserve it when there were few to do it homage. For
this we are indebted to the schools. Unobserved in the process of change, but happy in its
results, the business of education is not now confined to professional teachers.

The greatest change of all has been wrought by the attention given to female education, so
that the mother of this generation is not compelled to rely exclusively upon the school and
the paid teacher, public or private, but can herself, as the teacher ordained by nature, aid
her children in the preparatory studies of life. This power does not often manifest itself
in a regular system of domestic school studies and discipline, but its influence is felt in
a higher home preparation, and in the exhibition of better ideas of what a school should be.
And we may assume, with all due respect to our maternal ancestry, that this fact is a modern
feature, comparatively, in American civilization. Female education has given rise to some excesses
of opinion and conduct; but the world is entirely safe, especially the self-styled lords of
creation, and may wisely advocate a system of general education without regard to sex, and
leave the effect to those laws of nature and revelation which are to all and in all, and cannot
permanently be avoided or disobeyed.

The number of educators has strangely increased, and they often appear where they might least
be expected. We speak of the revival of education, and think only of the change that has taken
place in the last twenty years in the appropriations of money, the style of school-houses,
and the fitness of professional teachers for the work in which they are engaged; but these
changes, though great, are scarcely more noteworthy than those that have occurred in the management
of our shops, mills, and farms. When we write the sign or utter the sound which symbolizes
Teacher, what figure, being, or qualities, are brought before us? We should see a person who,
in the pursuit of knowledge, is self-moving, and, in the exercise of the influence which knowledge
gives, is able to appreciate the qualities of others; and who, moreover, possesses enough of
inventive power to devise means by which he can lead pupils, students, or hearers, in the way
they ought to go. We naturally look for such persons in the lecture-room, the school, and the
pulpit. And we find them there; but they are also to be found in other places. There are thousands
of such men in America, engaged in the active pursuits of the day. They are farmers, mechanics,
merchants, operatives. They do not often follow text-books, and therefor are none the worse,
but much the better teachers. Insensibly they have taken on the spirit of the teacher and the
school, and, apparently ignorant of the fact, are, in the quiet pursuits of daily life, leaders
of classes following some great thought, or devoted to some practical investigation. And in
one respect these teachers are of a higher order than some--not all, nor most--of our professional
teachers. They never cease to be students. When a man or woman puts on the garb of the teacher,
and throws off the garb of the student, you will soon find that person so dwindled and dwarfed,
that neither will hang upon the shoulders. This happens sometimes in the school, but never
in the world.

The last twenty-five years have produced two new features in our civilization, that are at
once a cause and a product of learning. I speak of the Press, and of Associations for mutual
improvement.

The newspaper press of America, having its centre in the city of New York, is more influential
than the press of any other country. It may not be conducted with greater ability; though,
if compared with the English press, the chief difference unfavorable to America is found in
the character of the leading editorial articles. In enterprise, in telegraphic business, maritime,
and political news and information, the press of the United States is not behind that of Great
Britain.

It must, however, be admitted that a given subject is usually more thoroughly discussed in
a single issue from the English press; but it is by no means certain that public questions
are, upon the whole, better canvassed in England than in America. Indeed, the opposite is probably
true. Our press will follow a subject day after day, with the aid of new thoughts and facts,
until it is well understood by the reader. European ideas of journalism cannot be followed
blindly by the press of America. The journalist in Europe writes for a select few. His readers
are usually persons of leisure, if they have not always culture and taste; and the issue of
the morning paper is to them what the appearance of the quarterly, heavy or racy, is to the
cultivated American reader.

But the American journalist, whatever his taste may be, cannot afford to address himself to
so small an audience. He writes literally for the million; for I take it to be no exaggeration
to say that paragraphs and articles are often read by millions of people in America. This fact
is an important one, as it furnishes a good test of the standard taste and learning of the
people. Our press answers the demand which the people make upon it. The mass of newspaper readers
are not, in a scholastic sense, well-educated persons. Newspaper writers do not, therefore,
trouble themselves about the colleges with their professors, but they seek rather to gain the
attention and secure the support of the great body of the people, who know nothing of colleges
except through the newspapers. We have always been permitted to infer the intellectual and
moral character of the audiences of Demosthenes, from the orations of Demosthenes; and may
we not also infer the character of the American people, from the character of the press that
they support? In a single issue may often be found an editorial article upon some question
of present interest; a sermon, address, or speech, from a leading mind of the country or the
world; letters from various quarters of the globe; extracts from established literary and scientific
journals; original essays upon political, literary, scientific, and religious subjects; and
items of local or general interest for all classes of readers. This product of the press, in
quantity and quality, could not be distributed, week after week, and year after year, among
an ignorant class of people. It could be accepted by intelligent, thinking, progressive minds
only; and, as a fact necessarily coëxisting, we find the newspaper press equally essential
to the best-educated persons among us. The newspaper press in America is a century and a half
old; but its power does not antedate this century, and its growth has been chiefly within the
last twenty-five years. What that growth has been may be easily seen by any one who will compare
the daily sheet of the last generation with the daily sheet of this; and the future of the
American press may be easily predicted by those who consider the progressive influences among
us, of which the newspaper must always be the truest representative.

Within the same brief period of time it has become the fixed custom of the people to associate
together for educational objects.

As a consequence, we have the lyceum for all, libraries for all, professional institutes and
clubs for merchants, mechanics, and farmers, and, at last, free libraries and lectures for
the operatives in the mills. Where these institutions can exist, there must be a high order
of general learning; and where these institutions do exist, and are sustained, the learning
of the people, whether high or low at any given moment, must be rapidly improved. Yet some
of these agencies--lectures and libraries, for example--are not free from serious faults. It
may seem rash and indefensible to criticize lectures upon the platform of the lecturer; but,
as the audience can inflict whatever penalty they please upon the speaker, he will so far assume
responsibility as to say that amusement is not the highest object of a single lecture, and
when sought by managers as the desirable object of a whole course, the lecture-room becomes
a theatre of dissipation; surely not so bad as other forms of dissipation, but yet so distinctly
marked, and so pernicious in its influence, as to be comparatively unworthy of general support.
Let it not, however, be inferred that wit, humor, and drollery even, are to be excluded from
the lecture-room; but they should always be employed as means by which information is communicated.
Between lecturers equal in other respects, one with the salt of humor, native to the soil,
should be preferred; but it is a sad reflection upon public taste, when a person whose entire
intellectual capital is wit, humor, or buffoonery, is preferred to men of solid learning. But
it is a worse view of human nature, when men of real merit and worth depreciate themselves
and lower the public taste, by attempting to do what, at best, they can have but ill success
in, and what they would despise themselves for, were they to succeed completely.

A kindred mental dissipation follows in the steps of progress, and demands aliment from our
public libraries. In the selection of books there is a wide range, from the trashy productions
of the fifth-rate novelist, to stately history and exact science. It is, however, to be assumed
that libraries will not be established until they are wanted, and that the want will not be
pressing until there is a taste for reading somewhat general. Where this taste exists, it is
fair to assume that it is in some degree elevated. The direction, however, which the taste
of any community is to take, after the establishment of a public library, depends, in a great
degree, upon the selection of books for its shelves. Two dangers are to be avoided. The first,
and greatest, is the selection of books calculated to degrade the morals or intellect of the
reader. This danger is apparent, and to be shunned needs but to be seen. Books, of more or
less intrinsic value, are so abundant and cheap, that common men must go out of their way to
gather a large collection that shall not contain works of real merit. But the object should
be to exclude all worthless and pernicious works, and meet and improve the public taste, by
offering it mental food better than that to which it has been accustomed. The other danger
is negative, rather than positive; but, as books are comparatively worthless when they are
not read, it becomes a matter of great moment to select such as will touch the public mind
at a few points, at least. It is indeed possible, and, under the guidance of some persons,
it would be natural, to encumber the shelves of a library with good books that might ever remain
so, saving only the contributions made to mould and mice. To be sure, reading for some is better
than reading for none; but reading for all is better than either. In Massachusetts there is
a general law that permits cities and towns to raise money for the support of libraries; yet
the legislature, in a few cases, has granted charters to library associations. With due deference,
it may very well be suggested, that, where a spirit exists which leads a few individuals to
ask for a charter, it would be better to turn this spirit into a public channel, that all might
enjoy its benefits. And it will happen, generally, that the establishment of a public library
will be less expensive to the friends of the movement, and the advantages will be greater;
while there will be an additional satisfaction in the good conferred upon others.

We shall act wisely if we apply to books a maxim of the Greeks: "All things in common amongst
friends." Under this maxim Cicero has enumerated, as principles of humanity, not to deny one
a little running water, or the lighting his fire by ours, if he has occasion; to give the best
counsel we are able to one who is in doubt or distress; which, says he, "are things that do
good to the person that receives them, and are no loss or trouble to him that confers them."
And he quotes, with approbation, the words of Ennius:

     "He that directs the wandering traveller
     Doth, as it were, light another's torch by his own;
     Which gives him ne'er the less of light, for that
     It gave another."

A good book is a guide to the reader, and a well-selected library will be a guide to many.
And shall we give a little running water, and turn aside or choke up the streams of knowledge?
light the evening torch, and leave the immortal mind unillumined? give free counsel to the
ignorant or distressed, when he might easily be qualified to act as his own counsellor? In
July 1856, Mr. Everett gave five hundred dollars toward a library for the High School in his
native town of Dorchester; and in 1854 Mr. Abbott Lawrence gave an equal sum to his native
town for the establishment of a public library. These are not large donations, if we consider
only the amount of money given; but it is difficult to suggest any other equal appropriation
that would be as beneficial, in a public sense. These donations are noble, because conceived
in a spirit of comprehensive liberality. They are examples worthy of imitation; and I venture
to affirm, there is not one of our New England towns that has not given to the world a son
able to make a similar contribution to the cause of general learning. Is it too much to believe
that a public library in a town will double the number of persons having a taste for reading,
and consequently double the number of well-educated people? For, though we are not educated
by mere reading, it is yet likely to happen that one who has a taste for books will also acquire
habits of observation, study, and reflection.

Professional institutes and clubs also serve to increase the sum of general learning. They
have thus far avoided the evil which has waited or fastened upon similar associations in Europe,--subserviency
to political designs. Every profession or interest of labor has peculiar ideas and special
purposes. These ideas and purposes may be wisely promoted by distinct organizations. Who can
doubt the utility of associations of merchants, mechanics, and farmers? They furnish opportunities
for the exchange of opinions, the exhibition of products, the dissemination of ideas, and the
knowledge of improvements, that are thus wisely made the property of all. Knowledge begets
knowledge. What is the distinguishing fact between a good school and a poor one? Is it not,
that in a good school the prevailing public sentiment is on the side of knowledge and its acquisition?
And does not the same fact distinguish a learned community from an ignorant community? If,
in a village or city of artisans, each one makes a small annual contribution to the general
stock of knowledge, the aggregate progress will be appreciable, and, most likely, considerable.
If, on the other hand, each one plods by himself, the sum of professional knowledge cannot
be increased, and is likely to be diminished.

The moral of the parable of the ten talents is eminently true in matters of learning. "Unto
every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not
shall be taken away even that which he hath." We cannot conceive of a greater national calamity
than an industrial population delving in mental sluggishness at unrelieved and unchanging tasks.
The manufacture of pins was commenced in England in 1583, and for two hundred and fifty years
she had the exclusive control of the trade; yet all that period passed away without improvement,
or change in the process; while in America the business was revolutionized, simplified, and
economized one-half, in the period of five years. In 1840 the valuation of Massachusetts was
about three hundred millions of dollars; but it is certain that a large portion of this sum
should have been set off against the constant impoverishment of the land, commencing with the
settlement of the state,--the natural and unavoidable result of an ignorant system of farm
labor. The revival of education in America was soon followed by a marked improvement in the
leading industries of the people, and especially in the department of agriculture. The principle
of association has not yet been as beneficial to the farmers as to the mechanics; but the former
are soon to be compensated for the delay. With the exception of the business of discovering
small planets, which seem to have been created for the purpose of exciting rivalry among a
number of enthusiastic, well-minded, but comparatively secluded gentlemen, agricultural learning
has made the most marked progress in the last ten years. But an agricultural population is
professionally an inert population; and, therefore, as in the accumulation of John Jacob Astor's
fortune, it was more difficult to take the first step than to make all the subsequent movements.
Now, however, the principle of association is giving direction and force to the labors of the
farmer; and it is easy for any person to draw to himself, in that pursuit, the results of the
learning of the world.

Libraries and lectures for the operatives in the manufactories constitute another agency in
the cause of general learning. The city of Lawrence, under the lead of well-known public-spirited
gentlemen there, has the honor of introducing the system in America. A movement, to which this
is kindred, was previously made in England; but that movement had for its object the education
of the operatives in the simple elements of learning, and among the females in a knowledge
of household duties. An English writer says: "Many employers have already established schools
in connection with their manufactories. From many instances before us, we may take that of
Mr. Morris, of Manchester, who has risen, himself, from the condition of a factory operative,
and who has felt in his own person the disadvantages under which that class of workmen labor.
He has introduced many judicious improvements. He has spent about one hundred and fifty pounds
in ventilating his mills; and has established a library, coffee-room, class-room, weekly lectures,
and a system of industrial training. The latter has been established for females, of whom he
employs a great many. This class of girls generally go to the mills without any knowledge of
household duties; they are taught in the schools to sew, knit," etc.

But, in the provision made at Lawrence for intellectual culture, it is assumed, very properly,
that the operatives are familiar with the branches usually taught in the public schools. This
could not be assumed of an English manufacturing population, nor, indeed, of any town population,
considered as a whole. Herein America has an advantage over England. Our laborers occupy a
higher standpoint intellectually, and in that proportion their labors are more effective and
economical. The managers and proprietors at Lawrence were influenced by a desire to improve
the condition of the laborers, and had no regard to any pecuniary return to themselves, either
immediate or remote. And it would be a sufficient satisfaction to witness the growth of knowledge
and morality, thereby elevating society, and rendering its institutions more secure.

These higher results will be accompanied, however, by others of sufficient importance to be
considered. When we hire, or, what is, for this inquiry, the same thing, buy that commodity
called, labor, what do we expect to get? Is it merely the physical force, the animal life contained
in a given quantity of muscle and bone? In ordinary cases we expect these, but in all cases
we expect something more. We sometimes buy, and at a very high cost, too, what has, as a product,
the least conceivable amount of manual labor in it,--a professional opinion, for example; but
we never buy physical strength merely, nor physical strength at all, unless it is directed
by some intellectual force. The descending stream has power to drive machinery, and the arm
of the idiot has force for some mechanical service, but they equally lack the directing mind.
We are not so unwise as to purchase the power of the stream, or the force of the idiot's arm;
but we pay for its application in the thing produced, and we often pay more for the skill that
has directed the power than for the power itself. The river that now moves the machinery of
a factory in which many scores of men and women find their daily labor, and earn their daily
bread, was employed a hundred years ago in driving a single set of mill-stones; and thus a
man and boy were induced to divide their time lazily between the grist in the hopper and the
fish under the dam. The river's power has not changed; but the inventive, creative genius of
man has been applied to it, and new and astonishing results are produced. With man himself
this change has been even greater. In proportion to the population of the country, we are daily
dispensing with manual labor, and yet we are daily increasing the national production. There
is more mind directing the machinery propelled by the forces of nature, and more mind directing
the machinery of the human body. The result is, that a given product is furnished by less outlay
of physical force. Formerly, with the old spinning-wheel and hand-loom, we put a great deal
of bone and muscle into a yard of cloth; now we put in very little. We have substituted mind
for physical force, and the question is, which is the more economical? Or, in other words,
is it of any consequence to the employer whether the laborer is ignorant or intelligent?

Before we discuss this point abstractly, let us notice the conduct of men. Is any one willing
to give an ignorant farm laborer as much as he is ready to pay for the services of an intelligent
man? And if not, why the distinction? And if an ignorant man is not the best man upon a farm,
is he likely to be so in a shop or mill? And if not, we see how the proprietors of factories
are interested in elevating the standard of learning, in the mills and outside. But they are
not singular in this. All classes of employers are equally concerned in the education of the
laborer; for learning not only makes his labor more valuable to himself, but the market price
of the product is generally reduced, and the change affects favorably all interests of society.
This benefit is one of the first in point of time, and the one, perhaps, most appreciable of
all which learning has conferred upon the laborer. As each laborer, with the same expenditure
of physical force, produces a greater result, of course the aggregate products of the world
are vastly increased, although they represent only the same number of laborers that a less
quantity would have represented under an ignorant system.

The division of these products upon any principle conceivable leaves for the laborer a larger
quantity than he could have before commanded; for, although the share of the wealthy may be
disproportionate, their ability to consume is limited; and, as poverty is the absence or want
of things necessary and convenient for the purposes of life, according to the ideas at the
time entertained, we see how a laboring population, necessarily poor while ignorance prevails,
is elevated to a position of greater social and physical comfort, as mind takes the place of
brute force in the industries of the world. Learning, then, is not the result of social comfort,
but social comfort is the product of intelligence, and increases or diminishes as intelligence
is general or limited. It is not, however, to be taken as granted that each laborer's position
corresponds or answers to the sum of his own knowledge. It might happen that an ignorant laborer
would enjoy the advantages of a general culture, to which he contributed little or nothing;
and it must of necessity also happen that an intelligent laborer, in the midst of an ignorant
population, as in Ireland or India, for example, would be compelled to accept, in the main,
the condition of those around him. But there is no evidence on the face of society now, or
in its history, that an ignorant population, whether a laboring population or not, has ever
escaped from a condition of poverty. And the converse of the proposition is undoubtedly true,
that an intelligent laboring community will soon become a wealthy community. Learning is sure
to produce wealth; wealth is likely to contribute to learning, but it does not necessarily
produce it. Hence it follows that learning is the only means by which the poor can escape from
their poverty.

In this statement it is assumed that education does not promote vice; and not only is this
negative assumption true, but it is safe to assume, further, that education favors virtue,
and that any given population will be less vicious when educated than when ignorant. This,
I cannot doubt, is a general truth, subject, of course, to some exceptions.

The educational struggle in which the English people are now engaged has made distinct and
tangible certain opinions and impressions that are latent in many minds. There has been an
attempt to show that vice has increased in proportion to education. This attempt has failed,
though there may be found, of course, in all countries, single facts, or classes of facts,
that seem to sustain such an opinion.

Now, suppose this case,--and neither this case nor any similar one has ever occurred in real
life,--but suppose crime to increase as a people were educated, though there should be no increase
of population; would this fact prove that learning made men worse? By no means. Our answer
is apparent on the face of the change itself. By education, the business, and pecuniary relations
and transactions of a people are almost indefinitely multiplied; and temptations to crime,
especially to crimes against property, are multiplied in an equal ratio. Would person or property
be better respected in New York or Boston, if the most ignorant population of the world could
be substituted for the present inhabitants of those cities? The business nerves of men are
frequently shocked by some unexpected defalcation, and short-sighted moralists, who lack faith,
exclaim, "All this is because men know so much!" Such certainly forget that for every defaulter
in a city there are hundreds of honest men, who receive and render justly unto all, and hold
without check the fortunes of others. So Mr. Drummond argued in the British House of Commons
against a national system of education, because what he was pleased to call instruction had
not saved William Palmer and John Sadlier. But the truth in this matter is not at the bottom
of a well; it is upon the surface. Where it is the habit of society generally to be ignorant,
you will find it the necessity of that society to be poor; and where ignorance and poverty
both abound, the temptations to crime are unquestionably few, but the power to resist temptation
is as unquestionably weak. The absence of crime is owing to the absence of temptation, rather
than to the presence of virtue. Such a condition of society is as near to real virtue as the
mental weakness of the idiot is to true happiness.

Turning again to the discussion in the British Parliament of April, 1856, we are compelled
to believe that some English statesmen are, in principle and in their ideas of political economy,
where a portion of the English cotton-spinners were a hundred years ago. The cotton-spinners
thought the invention of labor-saving machinery would deprive them of bread; and a Mr. Ball
gravely argues that schools will so occupy the attention of children, that the farmers' crops
will be neglected. I am inclined to give you his own words; and I have no doubt you will be
in a measure relieved of the dulness of this essay, when you listen to what was actually cheered,
in the British Commons. Speaking of the resolutions in favor of a national system of instruction,
Mr. Ball said: "It was important to consider what would be their bearing on the agricultural
districts of the country. He had obtained a return from his own farm, and, supposing the principles
advocated by the noble lord were adopted, the results would be perfectly fearful. The following
was the return he had obtained from his agent: William Chapman, ten years a servant on his
(Mr. Ball's) farm; his own wages thirteen shillings, besides a house; he had seven children,
who earned nine shillings a week; making together twenty-two shillings a week. Robert Arbor,
fifteen years on the farm; wages thirteen shillings a week, and a house; six children, who
earned six shillings a week; making together nineteen shillings. John Stevens, thirty-three
years a servant on the farm; his own wages fourteen shillings a week; he had brought up ten
children, whose average earnings had been twelve shillings weekly, making together twenty-six
shillings a week. Robert Carbon, twenty-two years a servant on the farm; wages thirteen shillings
a week; having ten children, who earned ten shillings a week; making together twenty-three
shillings a week. Thus it appeared that in these four families the fathers earned fifty-three
shillings weekly, and the children thirty-seven shillings a week; so that the children earned
something more than two-thirds of the amount of the earnings of the fathers. He would ask the
house, if the fathers were to be deprived of the earnings of the children, how could they provide
bread for them? It was perfectly impossible. They must either increase the parent's wages to
the amount of the loss he thus sustained, or they must make it up to him from a rate. Then,
again, those who were at all conversant with agriculture knew that if they deprived the farmer
of the labor of children, agriculture could not be carried on. There was no machinery by which
they could get the weeds out of the land."--London Times.

The light which this statement furnishes is not hid under a bushel. The argument deserves a
more logical form, and I proceed gratuitously to give the author the benefit of a scientific
arrangement. "If a national system of education is adopted, the children of my tenants will
be sent to school; if the children of my tenants are sent to school, my turnips will not be
weeded; if my turnips are not weeded, I shall eat fat mutton no more."

After this from a statesman, we need not wonder that a correspondent of Lord John Russell writes,
"That a farmer near him has been heard to say, he would not give anything to a day-school;
he finds that since Sunday-schools have been established the birds have increased and eat his
corn, and because he cannot now procure the services of the boys, whom he used to employ the
whole of Sunday, in protecting his fields."--London Times, April 13th, 1856.

Now, I do not go to England for the purpose of making an attack upon her opinions; but, as
kindred ideas prevail among us, though to a limited extent only, the folly of them may be seen
in persons at a distance, when it would not be realized by ourselves. Moreover, the presentation
of these somewhat ridiculous notions brings ridicule upon a whole class of errors; and when
errors are so ingrained that men cannot reason in regard to them, ridicule is often the only
weapon of successful attack. And it is no compliment to an American audience for the speaker
to say that their own minds already suggest the refutation which these errors demand. If the
chief end of man, for which boyhood should be a preparation, were to weed turnips or to frighten
blackbirds from corn-fields, then surely the objection of Mr. Ball, and the complaint and spirit
of resistance offered by Lord John Russell's farmer, would be eminently proper. But Lord John
Russell did not himself assent to the view furnished by his correspondent. Mr. Ball's theory
evidently is, "Take good care of the turnips, and leave the culture of the boys and girls to
chance;" and Lord John Russell's wise farmer unquestionably thinks that cereal peculations
of blackbirds are more dangerous than the robberies committed by neglected children, grown to men.

Mr. Clay, chaplain of Preston jail, says: "Thirty-six per cent. come into jail unable to say
the Lord's Prayer; and seventy-two per cent. come in such a state of moral debasement that
it is in vain to give them instruction, or to teach them their duty, since they cannot understand
the meaning of the words used to them." Here we have, as cause and effect, the philosophy of
Mr. Ball, and the facts of Mr. Clay. And, further, this philosophy is as bad in principle,
when tried by the rules of political economy, as when subjected to moral and Christian tests.

Mr. Ball says there is no machinery by which the farmers can get the weeds out of the land.
This may be true; and once there was no machinery by which they could get the seed into the
land, or the crops from it. Once there was little or no inventive power among the mechanics,
or scientific knowledge, or even spirit of inquiry, among the farmers. How have these changes
been wrought? By education, surely, and that moral and religious culture for which secular
education is a fit preparation. The contributions of learning to labor, in a pecuniary aspect
alone, have far exceeded the contributions of labor to learning.

It is impossible to enumerate the evidences in support of this statement, but single facts
will give us some conception of their aggregated value and force.

It was stated by Mr. Flint, Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture, in his Annual
Report for 1855, "That the saving to the country, from the improvements in ploughs alone, within
the last twenty-five years, has been estimated at no less than ten millions of dollars a year
in the work of teams, and one million in the price of ploughs, while the aggregate of the crops
is supposed to have been increased by many millions of bushels." From this fact, as the representative
of a great class of facts, we may safely draw two conclusions. First, these improvements are
the products of learning, the contribution which learning makes to labor, far exceeding in
amount any tax which the cause of learning, in schools or out, imposes upon labor. Secondly,
we see that a given amount of adult labor upon a farm, with the help of the improved implements
of industry, will accomplish more in 1856, than the same amount of adult labor, with its attendant
juvenile force, could have accomplished in 1826. If we were fully to illustrate and sustain
the latter inference, we should be required to review the improvements made in other implements
of farming, as well as in ploughs. Their positive pecuniary value, when considered in the aggregate,
is too vast for general belief; and in England alone it must exceed the anticipated cost of
a system of public instruction, say six millions of pounds, or thirty millions of dollars,
per year. But learning, as we have defined it, has contributed less to farming than to other
departments of labor.

The very existence of manufactures presupposes the existence of learning. There is no branch
of manufactures without its appropriate machine; and every machine is the product of mind,
enlarged and disciplined by some sort of culture. The steam engine, the spinning-jenny, the
loom, the cotton-gin, are notable instances of the advantages derived by manufacturing industry
from the prevalence of learning. It was stated by Chief Justice Marshall, about thirty years
ago, that Whitney's cotton-gin had saved five hundred millions of dollars to the country; and
the saving, upon the same basis, cannot now be less than one thousand millions of dollars,--a
sum too great for the human imagination to conceive. When we contemplate these achievements
of mind, by which manual labor has been diminished, and every physical force both magnified
and economized, how unstatesmanlike is the view which regards a human being as a bundle of
muscles and bones merely, with no destiny but ignorance, servitude, and poverty!

Ancient commerce, if we omit to notice the conjecture that the mariner's compass was in possession
of the old Phoenician and Indian navigators, reproduced, rather than invented, in modern times,
did not rest upon any enlarged scientific knowledge; but, in this era, many of the sciences
contribute to the extension and prosperity of trade. After what has been accomplished by science,
and especially by physical geography, for commerce and navigation, we have reason to expect
a system, based upon scientific knowledge and principles, which shall render the highway of
nations secure against the disasters that have often befallen those who go down to the sea
in ships. Science gave to the world the steamship, which promised for a time to engross the
entire trade upon the ocean; but science again appears, constructs vessels upon better scientific
principles, traces out the path of currents in the water and the air, and thus restores the
rival powers of wind and steam to an equality of position in the eye of the merchant. Will
any one say that all this inures to capital, and leaves the laborer comparatively unrewarded?
We are accustomed to use the word prosperity as synonymous with accumulation; and yet, in a
true view, a man may be prosperous and accumulate nothing. Suppose we contrast two periods
in the life of a nation with each other. Since the commencement of this century, the wages
of a common farm laborer in America have increased seventy-five or one hundred per cent., while
the articles necessary and convenient for his use have, upon the whole, diminished in price.
Admit that there was nothing for accumulation in the first period, and that there is nothing
for accumulation now,--is not his condition nevertheless improved? And, if so, has he not participated
in the general prosperity?

Indeed, we may all accept the truth, that there is no exclusiveness in the benefits which learning
confers; and this leads me to say, next, that there ought to be no exclusiveness in the enjoyment
of educational privileges.

In America we agree to this; and yet, confessedly, as a practical result we have not generally
attained the end proposed. There are two practical difficulties in the way. First, our aim
in a system of public instruction is not high enough; and, secondly, we do not sufficiently
realize the importance of educating each individual. Our aim is not high enough; and the result,
like every other result, is measured and limited by the purpose we have in view. Our public
schools ought to be so good that private schools for instruction in the ordinary branches would
disappear. Mr. Everett said, in reply to inquiries made by Mr. Twistleton, "I send my boy to
the public school, because I know of none better." It should be the aim of the public to make
their schools so good that no citizen, in the education of his children, will pass them by.

It is as great a privilege for the wealthy as for the poor to have an opportunity to send their
children to good public schools. It is a maxim in education that the teacher must first comprehend
the pupil mentally and morally; and might not many of the errors of individual and public life
be avoided, if the citizen, from the first, were to have an accurate idea of the world in which
he is to live? The demand of labor upon education, as they are connected with every material
interest of society, is, that no one shall be neglected. The mind of a nation is its capital.
We are accustomed to speak of money as capital; and sometimes we enlarge the definition, and
include machinery, tools, flocks, herds, and lands. But for this moment let us do what we have
a right to do,--go behind the definitions of lexicographers and political economists, and say,
"capital is the producing force of society, and that force is mind." Without this force, money
is nothing; machinery is nothing; flocks, herds, lands, are nothing. But all these are made
valuable and efficient by the power of mind. What we call civilization,--passing from an inferior
to a superior condition of existence,--is a mental and moral process. If mind is the capital,--the
producing force of society,--what shall we say of the person or community that neglects its
improvement? Certainly, all that we should say of the miser, and all that was said of the timid
servant who buried his talent in the earth. If one mind is neglected, then we fail as a generation,
a state, a nation, as members of the human family, to answer the highest purposes of existence.
Some possible good is unaccomplished, some desirable labor is unperformed, some means of progress
is neglected, some evil seed, it may be, is sown, for which this generation must answer to
all the successions of men. But let us not yield to the prejudice, though sanctioned by custom,
that learning unfits men for the labors of life. The schools may sometimes do this, but learning
never. We cannot, however, conceal from our view the fact that this prejudice is a great obstacle
to progress, even in New England; an obstacle which may not be overcome without delay and conflict,
in many states of this Union; and especially in Great Britain is it an obstacle in the way
of those who demand a system of universal education.

In the House of Commons, Mr. Drummond opposes a national system of education in this wise:
"And, pray, what do you propose to rear your youth for? Are you going to train them for statesmen?
No. (A laugh.) The honorable gentleman laughs at the notion, and so would I. But you are going
to fit them to be--what? Why, cotton-spinners and pin-makers, or, if you like, blacksmiths,
mere day laborers. These are the men whom you are to teach foreign languages, mathematics,
and the notation of music. (Hear, hear.) Was there ever anything more absurd? It really seems
as if God had withdrawn common sense from this house." Now, what does this language of Mr.
Drummond mean? Is it not his opinion that the business of pin-making is to be perpetuated in
some families and classes, and the business of statesmanship is to be perpetuated in others?
And, if so, does he not believe that the best condition of society is that which presents divisions
based upon the factitious distinctions of birth and fortune? Most certainly these questions
indicate his opinions, as they indicate the opinions of those who cheered him, and as they
also indicate the opinions of a few in this country, who, through ignorance, false education,
prejudice, or sympathy with castes and races, fear to educate the laborer, lest he may forsake
his calling. With us these fears are infrequent, but they ought not to exist at all. The question
in a public sense is not, "From what family or class shall the pin-maker or the statesman be
taken?" There is no question at all to be answered. Educate the whole people. Education will
develop every variety of talent, taste, and power. These qualities, under the guidance of the
necessities of life and the public judgment, will direct each man to his proper place. If the
son of a cotton-spinner become a statesman, it is because statesmanship needs him, and he has
some power answering to its wants. And if Mr. Drummond's son become a cotton-spinner, it is
because that is his right place, and the world will be the better and the richer that Mr. Drummond's
son is a cotton-spinner, and that he is a learned man too; but, if Mr. Drummond's son occupy
the place of a statesman because he is Mr. Drummond's son, though he be no statesman at all
himself, then the world is all the worse for the mistake, and poor compensation is it that
Mr. Drummond's son is a learned man in something that he is never called to put in practice.

When it is said that the statesmen, or those engaged in the business of government, shall come
from one-tenth of the population, is not the state, according to the doctrine of chances, deprived
of nine-tenths of its governing force? And may not the same suggestion be made of every other
branch of business?

But I pass now to the last leading thought, and soon to the conclusion of my address. The great
contribution of learning to the laborer is its power, under the lead of Christianity, to break
down the unnatural distinctions of society, and to render labor of every sort, among all classes,
acceptable and honorable. Ignorance is the degradation of labor, and when laborers, as a class,
are ignorant, their vocation is necessarily shunned by some; and, being shunned by some, it
is likely to be despised by others. Wherever the laboring population is in a condition of positive,
or, by a broad distinction, of comparative ignorance, society will always divide itself into
two, and oftentimes into three classes. We shall find the dominant class, the servient class,
and then, generally, the despised class; the dominant class, comparatively intelligent, possessing
the property, administering the government, giving to social life its laws, and enjoying the
fruits of labor which they do not perform; the servient class, unwittingly in a state of slavery,
whether nominally bond or free, having little besides physical force to promote their own comfort
or to contribute to the general prosperity, and furnishing security in their degradation for
a final submission to whatever may be required of them; and last, a despised class, too poor
to live without labor, and too proud to live by labor, assuming a position not accorded to
them, and finally yielding to a social and political ostracism even more degrading, to a sensitive
mind, than the servient condition they with so much effort seek to shun.

All this is the fruit of ignorance; all this may be removed by general learning. If all men
are learned, the work of the world will be performed by learned men; and why, under such circumstances,
should not every vocation that is honest be equally honorable? But if this, in a broad view,
seem utopian, can we not agree that learning is the only means by which a poor man can escape
from his poverty? And, if it furnish certain means of escape for one man, will it not furnish
equally certain means of escape for many? And if so, is not learning a general remedy for the
inequalities among men?

EDUCATION AND CRIME.

[Extract from the Twenty-First Annual Report of the Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of
Education.]

The public schools, in their relations to the morals of the pupils and to the morality of the
community, are attracting a large share of attention. In some sections of the country the system
is boldly denounced on account of its immoral tendencies. In states where free schools exist
there are persons who doubt their utility; and occasionally partisan or religious leaders appear
who deny the existence of any public duty in regard to education, or who assert and maintain
the doctrine that free schools are a common danger. As the people of this commonwealth are
not followers of these prophets of evil, nor believers in their predictions, there is but slight
reason for discussion among us. It is not probable that a large number of the citizens of Massachusetts
entertain doubts of the power and value of our institutions of learning, of every grade, to
resist evil and promote virtue, through the influence they exert. But, as there is nothing
in our free-school system that shrinks from light, or investigation even, I have selected from
the annual reports everything which they contain touching the morality of the institution.
In so doing, I have had two objects in view. First, to direct attention to the errors and wrongs
that exist; and, secondly, to state the opinion, and enforce it as I may be able, that the
admitted evils found in the schools are the evils of domestic, social, municipal, and general
life, which are sometimes chastened, mitigated, or removed, but never produced, nor even cherished,
by our system of public instruction. In the extracts from the school committees' reports there
are passages which imply some doubt of the moral value of the system; but it is our duty to
bear in mind that these reports were prepared and presented for the praiseworthy purpose of
arousing an interest in the removal of the evils that are pointed out. The writers are contemplating
the importance of making the schools a better means of moral and intellectual culture; but
there is no reason to suppose that in any case a comparison is instituted, even mentally, between
the state of society as it appears at present and the condition that would follow the abandonment
of our system of public instruction. There are general complaints that the manners of children
and youth have changed within thirty or fifty years; that age and station do not command the
respect which was formerly manifested, and that some license in morals has followed this license
in manners.

The change in manners cannot be denied; but the alleged change in morals is not sustained by
a great amount of positive evidence. The customs of former generations were such that children
often manifested in their exterior deportment a deference which they did not feel, while at
present there may be more real respect for station, and deference for age and virtue, than
are exhibited in juvenile life. In this explanation, if it be true, there is matter for serious
thought; but I should not deem it wise to encourage a mere outward show of the social virtues,
which have no springs of life in the affections.

And, notwithstanding the tone of the reports to which I have called attention, and notwithstanding
my firm conviction that many moral defects are found in the schools, I am yet confident that
their moral progress is appreciable and considerable.

In the first place, teachers, as a class, have a higher idea of their professional duties,
in respect to moral and intellectual culture. Many of them are permanently established in their
schools. They are persons of character in society, with positions to maintain, and they are
controlled by a strong sense of professional responsibility to parents and to the public. It
has been, to some extent, the purpose and result of Teachers' Associations, Teachers' Institutes,
and Normal Schools, to create in the body of teachers a better opinion concerning their moral
obligations in the work of education. It must also be admitted that the changes in school government
have been favorable to learning and virtue. For, while it is not assumed that all schools are,
or can be, controlled by moral means only, it is incontrovertible that a government of mild
measures is superior to one of force. This superiority is as apparent in morals as in scholarly
acquisitions. It is rare that a teacher now boasts of his success over his pupils in physical
contests; but such claims were common a quarter of a century ago. The change that has been
wrought is chiefly moral, and in its influence we find demonstrative evidence of the moral
superiority of the schools of the present over those of any previous period of this century.
Before we can comprehend the moral work which the schools have done and are doing, we must
perceive and appreciate with some degree of truthfulness the changes that have occurred in
general life within a brief period of time. The activity of business, by which fathers have
been diverted from the custody and training of their children; the claims of fashion and society,
which have led to some neglect of family government on the part of mothers; the aggregation
of large, populations in cities and towns, always unfavorable to the physical and moral welfare
of children; the comparative neglect of agriculture, and the consequent loss of moral strength
in the people, are all facts to be considered when we estimate the power of the public school
to resist evil and to promote good. If, in addition to these unfavorable facts and tendencies,
our educational system is prejudicial to good morals, we may well inquire for the human agency
powerful enough to resist the downward course of New England and American civilization. To
be sure, Christianity remains; but it must, to some extent, use human institutions as means
of good; and the assertion that the schools are immoral is equivalent to a declaration that
our divine religion is practically excluded from them. This declaration is not in any just
sense true. The duty of daily devotional exercises is always inculcated upon teachers, and
the leading truths and virtues of Christianity are made, as far as possible, the daily guides
of teachers and pupils. The tenets of particular sects are not taught; but the great truths
of Christianity, which are received by Christians generally, are accepted and taught by a large
majority of committees and teachers. It is not claimed that the public schools are religious
institutions; but they recognize and inculcate those fundamental truths which are the basis
of individual character, and the best support of social, religious, and political life. The
statement that the public schools are demoralizing must be true, if true at all, for one of
three reasons. Either because all education is demoralizing; or, secondly, because the particular
education given in the public schools is so; or, thirdly, because the public-school system
is corrupting, and consequently taints all the streams of knowledge that flow through or emanate
from it. For, if the public system is unobjectionable as a system, and education is not in
itself demoralizing, then, of course, no ground remains for the charge that I am now considering.

I. Is all education demoralizing? An affirmative answer to this question implies so much that
no rational man can accept it. It is equivalent to the assertion that barbarism is a better
condition than civilization, and that the progress of modern times has proceeded upon a misconception
of the true ideal perfection of the human race. As no one can be found who will admit that
his happiness has been marred, his powers limited, or his life degraded, by education, so there
is no process of logic that can commend to the human understanding the doctrine that bodies
of men are either less happy or virtuous for the culture of the intellect. I am not aware of
any human experience that conflicts with this view; for individual cases of criminals who have
been well educated prove nothing in themselves, but are to be considered as facts in great
classes of facts which indicate the principles and conduct of bodies of men who are subject
to similar influences. In fact, the statistics to which I have had access tend to show that
crime diminishes as intelligence increases. On this point the experience of Great Britain is
probably more definite, and, of course, more valuable, than our own. The Aberdeen Feeding Schools
were established in 1841, and during the ten years succeeding the commitments to the jails
of children under twelve years of age were as follows:[1]

     In 1842,   30   In 1847,   27

        1843,   63      1848,   19

        1844,   41      1849,   16

        1845,   49      1850,   22

        1846,   28      1851,    8

               211              92

In the work of Mr. Hill it is also stated that "the number of children under twelve committed
for crime to the Aberdeen prisons, during the last six years, was as follows:

                 Males.    Females.    Total.

     1849-50,     11         5          16

     1850-51,     14         8          22

     1851-52,      6         2           8

     1852-53,     23         1          24

     1853-54,     24         1          25

     1854-55,     47         2          49

"It will be observed that in the last three years there has been a great increase of boy crime,
contemporaneously with an almost total absence of girl crime, though formerly the amount of
the latter was considerable. Now, since this extraordinary difference coïncides in point of
time with the fact of full girls' schools and half empty boys' schools, the inference can hardly
be avoided that the two facts bear the relation of cause and effect, and that, so far from
the late increase of youthful crime in Aberdeen any-wise impairing the soundness of the principle
on which the schools are based, it is its strongest confirmation. In moral as in physical science,
when the objections to a theory are, upon further investigation, explained by the theory itself,
they become the best evidence of its truth. Indeed, it is proved, by the experience, not only
of Aberdeen, but, as far as I have been able to ascertain, of every town in Scotland in which
industrial schools have been established, that the number of children in the schools and the
number in the jail are like the two ends of a scale-beam; as the one rises the other falls,
and vice versa.

"The following list of imprisonments of children attending the schools of the Bristol Ragged
School Union shows considerable progress in the right direction:

             |1847.|1848.|1849.|1850.|1851.|1852.|1853.|1854.|1855.|

      Difference,  15.9

        16.5 : 15.9 :: 100 : 96.36.

"Thus," says Mr. Thornton, "it appears that the diminution of the average annual number of
children attending our schools imprisoned in the latter period of five years, as compared with
the annual average of the previous four years, is ninety-six per cent.--a striking fact, which
is, I think, a manifest proof of the benefit conferred on them by the religious and secular
instruction they receive in our schools, or, at the very least, of the advantages of rescuing
them from the temptations of idleness, and from evil companionship and example."

I also copy, from the work already referred to, an extract from a paper on the Reformatory
Institutions in and near Bristol, by Mary Carpenter: "In numberless instances children may
be seen growing up decently, who owe their only training and instruction to the school. Young
persons are noticed in regular work, who, before they attended the Ragged Schools, were vagrants,
or even thieves. Not unfrequently a visit is paid at the school by a respectable young man,
who proves to have been a wild and troublesome scholar of former times."

Mr. Hill, Recorder of Birmingham, in a charge to the grand jury, made in 1839, speaking of
the means of repressing crime, says: "It is to education, in the large and true meaning of
the word, that we must all look as the means of striking at the root of the evil. Indeed, of
the close connection between ignorance and crime the calendar which I hold in my hand furnishes
a striking example. Each prisoner has been examined as to the state of his education, and the
result is set down opposite his name. It appears, then, that of forty-three prisoners only
one can read and write well. The majority can neither read nor write at all; and the remainder,
with the solitary exception which I have noted down, are said to read and write imperfectly;
which necessarily implies that they have not the power of using those great elements of knowledge
for any practical object. Of forty-three prisoners, forty-two, then, are destitute of instruction."

These authorities are not cited because they refer to schools that answer in character to the
public schools of Massachusetts, for the latter are far superior in the quality of their pupils,
and in the opportunities given for intellectual and moral education; but these cases and opinions
are presented for the purpose of showing what has been done for the improvement of children
and the repression of crime under the most unfavorable circumstances that exist in a civilized
community. If such benign results have followed the establishment of schools of an inferior
character, is it unreasonable to claim that education and the processes of education, however
imperfect they may be, are calculated to increase the sum of human progress, virtue, and happiness?

II. Is the particular education given in the public schools unfavorable to the morals of the
pupils, and, consequently, to the morality of the community? I have already presented a view
of the moral and religious education given in the schools, and it only remains to consider
the culture that is in its leading features intellectual. It may be said, speaking generally,
that education is a training and development of the faculties, so as to make them harmonize
in power, and in their relations to each other. Among other things, the ability to read is
acquired in the public schools. In the individual, this is a power for good. It opens to the
mind and heart the teachings of the sacred Scriptures; it secures the companionship of the
great, the wise, and the good, of every age; and it is a possession that, in all cases, must
be the foundation of those scientific acquisitions, intellectual, moral, and natural, which
show the beneficence and power of the Creator, and indicate the fact and the law of human responsibility.
The natural and general effect of the sciences taught in the schools is an illustration of
the last statement. Moreover, the mere presence of a child, though he took no part in the studies
of the school, is to him a moral lesson. He feels the force of government, he acquires the
habit of obedience, and, in time, he comprehends the reason of the rules that are established.
This discipline is essentially moral, and furnishes some basis, though partial and unsatisfactory,
for the proper discharge of the duties of life. But it is to be remembered that the power of
the school is but in its beginning when the presence of a pupil is recognized. The constancy
and punctuality of attendance required by all judicious parents and faithful teachers are important
moral lessons, whose influence can never be destroyed. The fixedness of purpose that is required,
and is essential in school, remains as though it were a part of the nature of the child and
the man. School-life strengthens habits of industry when they exist, and creates them when
they do not. It is, indeed, the only means, of universal application, that is competent to
train children in habits of industry. Private schools can never furnish this training; for
large numbers of children, by the force of circumstances, are deprived of the tuition of such
schools. Business life cannot furnish this training; for the habits of the child are usually
moulded, if not hardened, before he arrives at an age when he can be constantly employed in
any industrial vocation. The public school is no doubt justly chargeable with neglects and
omissions; but its power for good, measured by the character of the education now furnished,
is certainly very great. It inculcates habits of regularity, punctuality, constancy, and industry,
in the pursuits of business; through literature and the sciences in their elements, and, under
some circumstances, by an advanced course of study, it leads the pupil towards the fountain
of life and wisdom; and, by the moral and religious instruction daily given, some preparation
is made for the duties of life and the temptations of the world.

III. Is the public school system, as a system, in itself necessarily corrupting? As preliminary
to the answer to be given to this question, it is well to consider what the public-school system
is.

1. Every inhabitant is required to contribute to its support.

2. It contemplates the education of every child, regardless of any distinction of society or
nature.

3. The system is subject in many respects to the popular will; and ultimately its existence
and character are dependent upon the public judgment.

4. In the Massachusetts schools, the daily reading of the Scriptures is required.

The consideration of these topics will conclude my remarks upon the general subject of the
moral influence of the American system of public instruction. In New England it is very unusual
to hear the right of the state to provide for the support of schools by general taxation called
in question; but I am satisfied, from private conversations, and from occasional public statements,
that there are leading minds in some sections of the country that are yet unconvinced of the
moral soundness of the basis on which a system of public instruction necessarily rests. Taxation
is simply an exercise of the right of the whole to take the property of an individual; and
this right can be exercised justly in those cases only where the application of the property
so taken is, morally speaking, to a public use. The judgment of the public determines the legality
of the proceeding; but it is possible that in some cases a public judgment might be secured
which could not be supported by a process of moral reasoning. On what moral grounds, then,
does the right of taxation for educational objects rest? I answer, first, education diminishes
crime. The evidence in support of this statement has already been presented. It is a manifest
individual duty to make sacrifices for this object; and, as every crime is an injury, not only
to him who is the subject of it, but to every member of society, the prevention of crime becomes
a public as well as an individual duty.

The conviction of a criminal is a public duty; and, under all governments of law, it is undertaken
at the public charge. Offences are not individual merely; they are against society also, inasmuch
as it is the right of society that all its members shall behave themselves well. And, if it
is the right of society that its members shall behave themselves well, is it not the duty of
society to so provide for their education that each individual part may meet the demand which
the whole body asserts? And, further, as a majority of persons cannot individually provide
for their own protection, it is the duty of society, or the state, or the government, to furnish
the needed protection in the most economical and effective manner possible. The state has no
moral right to jeopard property, life, and reputation, when, by a different policy, all these
might be secure; nor has the state a moral right to make the security furnished, whether perfect
or not, unnecessarily expensive. It is the dictate of reason and the experience of governments
that the most effectual method of repressing crime is to diminish the number of criminals;
and, though punitive measures may accomplish something, our chief reliance must be upon the
education and training of children and youth. The facts drawn from the experience of England
and Scotland, which have been quoted, lead to the conclusion that schools diminish the number
of criminals, and consequently lessen the amount of crime; but I think it proper to add some
extracts from a communication made, in August, 1856, by Mr. Dunne, chief constable of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
to the Secretary of the National Reformatory Union.[2]

"I know, from my own personal knowledge and observation, that, since parental responsibility
has been enforced in the district, under the direction of the Secretary of State, the number
of juvenile criminals in the custody of the police has decreased one-half. I know that many
of the parents, who were in the habit of sending their children into the streets for the purposes
of stealing, begging, and plunder, have quite discontinued that practice, and several of the
children so used, and brought up as thieves and mendicants, are now at some of the free schools
of the town; others are at work, and thereby obtain an honest livelihood; and, so far as I
can ascertain, they seem to be thoroughly altered, and appear likely to become good and honest
members of society. I have, for my own information, conversed with some of the boys so altered,
and, during the conversation I had with them, they declared that they derived the greatest
happiness and satisfaction from their change in life. I don't at all doubt the truth of these
statements, for their evident improvement and individual circumstances fully bear them out;
and I believe them to be really serious in all they say, and truly anxious to become honest
and respectable. I attribute, in a great measure, this salutary change to the effects arising
in many respects from the establishment of reformatory schools; but I have more particularly
found that greater advantages have emanated from those institutions since the parents of the
children confined in them have been made to pay contributions to their maintenance; for it
appears beyond doubt that the effect of the latter has been to induce the parents of other
young criminals to withdraw them from the streets, and, instead of using them for the purposes
of crime, they seem to take an interest in their welfare. And I know that many of them are
now really anxious to get such employment for their children as will enable them to obtain
a livelihood; and it is my opinion that the example thus set to older and more desperate criminals,
belonging in many instances to the same family as the juvenile thief, has had the effect of
reforming them also; for many of them have left off their course of crime, and are now living
by honest labor. The result is that serious crime has considerably decreased in this district,
so much so that there were only six cases for trial at the assizes, whereas, at the previous
assizes, the average number of cases was from twenty-five to thirty, which fact was made the
subject of much comment and congratulation by Mr. Justice Willes, the presiding judge."

These remarks relate chiefly to the reformatory schools, but we know that the prevention of
crime by education is much easier than its reformation by the same means. Indeed, it is the
result of the experience of Massachusetts that the necessity for reform schools has in a large
degree arisen from neglect of the public schools. It is stated in the Tenth Annual Report of
the Chaplain of the State Reform School that of nineteen hundred and nine boys admitted since
the establishment of the institution, thirteen hundred and thirty-four are known to have been
truants. It is also quite probable that the number reported as truants is really less than
the facts warrant. It may not be out of place to suggest, in this connection, that when a boy
sentenced to the Reform School is known to have been guilty of truancy, if the parents were
subjected to some additional burdens on that account, the cause of education would be promoted,
and the number of criminals in the community would be diminished. From the views and facts
presented, as well as from the daily observation and experience of men, I assume that ignorance
is the ally of crime, and that education is favorable to virtue. It is also the result of experience
and the dictate of reason that general taxation is the only means by which universal education
can be secured. All other plans and theories will prove partial in their application. If, then,
it is the duty of the state to protect itself against crime, and of course to diminish the
number of criminals; if education is the most efficient means for securing these results; if
this education must be universal in order to be thoroughly effective; if the state is the only
agent or instrumentality of sufficient power to establish schools and furnish education for
all; and if general taxation is the only means which the state itself can command, is not every
inhabitant justly required and morally bound to contribute to the support of a system of public
instruction?

It will not necessarily happen that public schools will furnish to every child and youth the
desired amount of education. Professional schools, classical schools, and academies of various
grades, will be continued; but there is an amount of intellectual and moral training needed
by every child which can be best given in the public school. This training in the public schools
ought to be carried much further than it usually is. In the city of Newburyport, as I have
been informed, there are no exceptions to the custom of educating all the children of the town
in the public schools up to the moment when young men enter college. In large towns and cities
there is no excuse for the existence of private schools to do the work now done in such schools
as those of Newburyport and other places where equal educational privileges exist.

The chief objection brought against the public school, touching its morality, is derived from
the fact that children who are subject to proper moral influences at home are brought in contact
with others who are already practised in juvenile vices, if they have not been guilty of petty
crimes. I am happy to believe that this statement is not true of many New England communities.
The objection was considered in the last Annual Report,--it has been often considered elsewhere;
and I do not propose to repeat at length the views which are entertained by the friends of
public education.

I have, however, to suggest that while this objection applies with some force to the public
school, it applies also to every other school, and that the evil is the least dangerous when
the pupil is intrusted to the care of a qualified teacher, who is personally responsible to
the public for his conduct, and when the child is also subject to the restraints, and influenced
by the daily example and teachings, of the parents.

Moreover, it is to be remembered that the great value of education, in a moral aspect, is the
development of the power to resist temptation. This power is not the growth of seclusion; and
while neither the teacher nor the parent ought wantonly to expose the child to vicious influences,
the school may be even a better preparation for the world from the fact that temptation has
there been met, resisted, and overcome. It is also to be remembered that the judgment of parents
in a matter so difficult and delicate as a comparison between their own children and other
children would not always prove trustworthy nor just; and that a judgment of parties not interested
would prove eminently fruitful of dissatisfaction and bitterness.

If all are to be educated, it only remains, then, that they be educated together, subject to
the general rule of society, that when a member is dangerous to the safety or peace of his
associates, he is to be excluded or restrained. Nor is this necessity of association destitute
of moral advantages. If the comparatively good were separated from the relatively vicious,
it is not improbable that the latter would soon fall into a state of barbarity. It seems to
be the law of the school and of the world that the most rapid progress is made when the weight
of public sentiment is on the side of improvement and virtue. It is not necessary for me to
remark that such a public sentiment exists in every town and school district of the state;
but who would take the responsibility in any of these communities, great or small, of separating
the virtuous classes from the dangerous classes? Parents, from the force of their affections,
are manifestly incompetent to do this; and those who are not parents are probably equally incompetent.
But, if it were honestly accomplished, who would be responsible for the crushing effects of
the measure upon those who were thus excluded from the presence and companionship of the comparatively
virtuous? These, often the victims of vicious homes, need more than others the influence and
example of the good; and it should be among the chief satisfactions of those who are able to
train their own children in the ways of virtue, that thereby a healthful influence is exerted
upon the less fortunate of their race. There is also in this course a wise selfishness; for,
although children may be separated from each other, the circumstances of maturer years will
often make the virtuous subject to the influence of the vicious. The safety of society, considered
individually or collectively, is not in the virtuous training of any part, however large the
proportion, but in the virtuous training of all. I cannot deem it wise policy, whether parental
or public, that takes the child from the school on account of the immoral associations that
are ordinarily found there, or, on the other hand, that drives the vicious or unfortunate from
the presence of those who are comparatively pure. When it is considered that the school is
often the only refuge of the unhappy subject of orphanage, or the victim of evil family influences,
it seems an unnecessary cruelty to withhold the protection, encouragement, and support, which
may be so easily and profitably furnished. It is said that a sparrow pursued by a hawk took
refuge in the bosom of a member of the sovereign assembly of Athens, and that the harsh Areopagite
threw the trembling bird from him with such violence that it was killed on the spot. The assembly
was filled with indignation at the cruelty of the deed; the author of it was arraigned as an
alien to that sentiment of mercy so necessary to the administration of justice, and by the
unanimous suffrages of his colleagues was degraded from the senatorial dignity which he had
so much dishonored.

It does not seem necessary to offer an argument in support of the position that the public
school is not unfavorably affected, morally, by the fact that it is subject to the popular
judgment. This judgment can be rendered only at stated times, and under the forms and solemnities
of law. The history of public schools would probably furnish but few instances of wrong in
this respect. The people are usually sensitive in regard to the moral character of teachers;
they contribute liberally for the support of the schools, are anxious for their improvement,
and there is no safer depositary of a trust that is essential to a nation in which is the hope
of freedom and free institutions.

And, last, a school cannot be truly said to be destitute of moral character and influence in
which the sacred Scriptures are daily read.

The observance of this requirement is a recognition of the existence of the Supreme Being,
of the Bible as containing a record of his will concerning men, and of the common duty of rational
creatures to live in obedience to the obligations of morality and religion.

It has been no part of my purpose, in this discussion of the public school as an institution
fitted to promote morality, to deny the existence of serious defects, or to screen them from
the eyes of men. The public school needs a more thorough discipline, a purer morality, a clearer
conception and a more practical recognition of the truths of Christianity. But, viewed as a
human institution, it claims the general gratitude for the good it has already accomplished.
The public school was established in Massachusetts that "learning might not be buried in the
graves of our forefathers, in church and commonwealth;" and, in some measure, at least, the
early expectation thus quaintly expressed has been realized. Learning has ever been cherished
and honored among us. The means of education have been the possession of all; and the enjoyment
of these means, often inadequate and humble, has developed a taste for learning, which has
been gratified in higher institutions; and thus continually have the resources of the state
been magnified, and its influence in the land has been efficient in all that concerns the welfare
of the human race on the American continent.

REFORMATION OF CHILDREN.

[Address at the Inauguration of WILLIAM E. STARR, Superintendent of the State Reform School
at Westborough.]

Neither the invitation of the Trustees nor my own convenience will permit a detailed examination
of the topics which the occasion suggests; and it is my purpose to address myself to those
who are assembled to participate in the exercises of the day, trusting to familiar and unobserved
visits for other and better opportunities for conference with the inmates of the institution.

As the mariner, though cheered by genial winds and canopied by cloudless skies, tests and marks
his position and course by repeated observations, so we now desire to note the progress of
this humanity-freighted vessel in its voyage over an uncertain sea, yet, as we trust, toward
lands of perpetual security and peace. All are voyagers on the sea of life. Some, with the
knowledge of ancient days only, grope their way by headlands, or trust themselves occasionally
to the guidance of the sun or the stars; while others, with the chart and compass of the Christian
era, move confidently on their course, attracted by the Source and Centre of all good. And
it is a blessing of this state of existence, though it may sometimes seem to be a curse, that
the choice between good and evil yet remains. The wisdom of a right choice is here manifested
in the benevolence of this foundation.

The State Reform School for Boys has now enjoyed eight full years of life and progress; and,
though we cannot estimate nor measure the good it may have induced, or the evil it may have
prevented, yet enough of its history and results is known to justify the course of its patrons,
both public and private, and to warrant the ultimate realization of their early cherished hopes.
The state is most honored in the honor awarded to its sons; and the name of LYMAN, now and
evermore associated with a work of benevolence and reform, will always command the admiration
of the citizens of the commonwealth, and stimulate the youth of the school to acquire and practise
those virtues which their generous patron cherished in his own life and honored in others.
Governor Washburn, in the Dedication Address, said, "We commend this school, with its officers
and inmates, to a generous and grateful public, with the trust that the future lives of the
young, who may be sent hither for correction and reform, may prove the crowning glory of an
enterprise so auspiciously begun." Since these words were uttered, and this hope, the hope
of many hearts, was expressed, nearly two thousand boys, charged with various offences,--many
of them petty, and others serious or even criminal,--have been admitted to the school; and
the chaplain, in his report for the year 1854, says that "the institution will be instrumental
in saving a majority of those who come under its fostering care." This opinion, based, no doubt,
upon the experience which the chaplain and other officers of the institution had had, is to
be taken as possessing a substantial basis of truth; and it at once suggests important reflections.

Massachusetts is relieved of the presence of a thousand criminal, or, at best, viciously disposed
persons. A thousand active, capable, industrious, productive, full-grown men have been created;
or, rather, a thousand consumers of the wealth of others, enemies of the public order and peace,
have been transformed into intelligent supporters of social life, into generous, faithful guardians
of public virtue and tranquillity. Nor would the influences of this degraded population, if
unreformed, have ceased with its own existence; every succeeding generation must have gathered
somewhat of a harvest of crime and woe. A thousand boys, hardened by neglect, educated in vice,
and shunned by the virtuous, would, as men, have been efficient missionaries of lawlessness,
wrong, and crime. And who shall estimate how much their reform adds, in its results, to the
wealth, the intellectual, moral, and religious character, of the state? The criminal class
is never a producing class; and the labor of a thousand men here reclaimed, if estimated for
the period of twenty years only, is equal to the labor of twenty thousand men for one year,
which, at a hundred dollars each, yields two millions of dollars. The pecuniary advantages
of this school, as of all schools, we may estimate; but there are better and higher considerations,
in the elevated intellectual, moral, and religious life of the state, that are too pure, too
ethereal, to be weighed in the balance against the grosser possessions and acquisitions of
society. We thus get glimpses of the prophetic wisdom which led Mr. Lyman to say, "I do not
look on this school as an experiment; on the contrary, it strikes me that it is an institution
which will produce decidedly beneficial results, not only for the present day, but for many
years to come. I do not, therefore, think that it should, even now, be treated in any respect
in the light of an experiment, to be abandoned if not successful; for, if the school is introduced
to public notice on no better footing and with no more preparation than usually attend trial-schemes
of most kinds, the probability is that it will fail, considering the peculiar difficulties
of the case." Here is a high order of faith in its application to human affairs; but Mr. Lyman
saw, also, that the work to be performed must encounter obstacles, and that its progress toward
a perfect result would be slow.

These obstacles have been encountered; and yet the progress has been more rapid than the words
of our founder imply. But are we not at liberty to forget the trials, crosses, and perplexities,
of this movement, as we behold the fruits, already maturing, of the wisdom and Christian benevolence
of our honored commonwealth?

We are assembled to review the past, and to gather from it strength and courage for the future;
and we may with propriety congratulate all, whether present or absent, who have been charged
with the administration of this school, and have contributed their share, however humble, to
promote these benign results. And we ought, also, to remember those, whether living or dead,
whose faith and labors laid the foundation on which the state has built. Of the dead, I mention
Lyman, Lamb, Denny, Woodward, Shaw, and Greenleaf,--all of whom, with money, counsel, or personal
service, contributed to the plan, progress, and completion, of the work.

The good that they have done is not interred with their bones; and their example will yet find
many imitators, as men more generally and more perfectly realize the importance of faith in
childhood and youth, as the element of a true faith in our race. If this enterprise, in the
judgment of its founder, was not an experiment ten years ago, it cannot be so regarded now;
yet the public will look with anxiety, though with hope, upon every change of the officers
of the institution. The trustees having appointed a new superintendent, he now assumes the
great responsibility. It may not be second to any in the state; yet a man of energy, who is
influenced by a desire to do good, and who will not measure his reward by present emoluments
or temporary fame, can bear steadily and firmly the weight put upon him. The superintendent
elect has been a teacher elsewhere, and he is to be a teacher here also. His work will not,
in all particulars, correspond with the work that he has left; yet the principles of government
and education are in substance the same. The head of a school always occupies a position of
influence; the characters of the children and youth confided to him are in a great degree subject
to his control. Here the teacher is neither aided nor impeded by the usual home influences.
This institution is at once a home and a school; and its head has the united power and responsibility
of the parent and the teacher. Here are to be combined the social and moral influences of home,
the religious influences of the Sunday-school, with the intellectual and moral training of
the public school. He who to-day enters upon this work should have both faith and courage.
He is to deal with the unfortunate rather than with the exceptional cases of humanity; for
all these are children whom the Father of the race, in his providence, has confided to earthly
parents to be educated for a temporal and an immortal existence. That these parents, through
crime, ignorance, indolence, carelessness, or misfortune, have failed in their work, is no
certain evidence that we are to fail in ours. May we not hope to see in this school the kindness,
consideration, affection, and forethought, of the parent, without the delusion which sometimes
causes the father or mother to treat the vices of the child as virtues, to be encouraged? And
may we not expect from the superintendent, to whom, practically, the discipline of the school
is confided, one characteristic of good government, not always, it is feared, found in punitive
and reformatory institutions? I speak of the attributes of equality, uniformity, and certainty,
in the administration of the law. To be sure, a school, a prison, or a state, will suffer when
its code is lax; and it will also suffer when its system is oppressive or sanguinary; but these
peculiarities in themselves do not so often, in any community, produce dissatisfaction, disorder,
and violence, as an unequal, partial, and uncertain administration of the laws. If at times
the laws are administered strictly according to the letter, and if at other times they are
reluctantly enforced or altogether disregarded; if it can never be known beforehand whether
a violation is to be followed by the prescribed penalty--especially if this uncertainty becomes
systematic, and a portion are favored, while the remainder are required to answer strictly
for all their delinquencies; and if, above all, these favored ones are recognized as sentinels,
or spies, or informers in the service of the officers,--then not only will the spirit of insubordination
manifest itself, but that spirit may ripen into alienations, feuds, and personal enmities,
dangerous to the prosperity of the institution. Here the scales of justice should be evenly
balanced, and the boy should learn, from his own daily experience, to measure equal and exact
justice unto others. I do not speak of systems of government: they are essential, no doubt;
but they are not to be regarded as of the first importance in institutions for punishment or
reformation. Establish as wise a system as you can; but never trust to that alone. Administer
the system that you have with all the equality, uniformity, and certainty, that you can command.
As a general truth, it may be said that the law is respected when these qualities are exhibited
in its administration; and, when these qualities are wanting, the spirit of obedience is driven
from the hearts and minds of the people.

But we are not to rely altogether, nor even chiefly, upon the visible weapons of authority.
Especially must the mind and heart of childhood and youth be approached and quickened and strengthened
by judicious appeals to the sentiments of veneration and love, and to the principles of the
Christian faith. In this institution, one serious obstacle is present; yet it may be overcome
by energy, industry, and a spirit of benevolence. I speak of the large number of inmates to
be superintended by one person. Men act in masses for the removal of general evils; but the
reformation of children must be individual, and to a great extent dependent upon the agency,
or at least upon the coöperation, of the subjects of it. It is not easy for the superintendent
to make himself acquainted with the persons and familiar with the lives of six hundred boys;
yet this knowledge is quite essential to the exercise of a salutary influence over them. He
may be aided by the subordinate officers of the institution; and that aid, under any circumstances,
he will need: but, after all, his own influence and power for good will be measured by the
extent of his personal acquaintance with the inmates as individuals. First, then, government
is essential to this school; not a reign of terror, but a government whose majesty, power,
equality, certainty, uniformity, and consequent justice, shall be experienced by all alike;
and, being experienced by all alike, will be respected, reverenced, and obeyed.

And next the social, intellectual, and moral influences of the school and the home should be
combined and mingled, or else the visible forms of government become a skeleton, merely indicating
the figure, structure, and outline, of the perfect body, but destitute of the vital principle
which alone could render it of any value to itself or to the world.

This institution is not an end, but a means. The home itself is only a preparatory school for
life. This is a substitute for the home, but is not, and never can be, its equal. It therefore
follows that a boy should be removed whenever a home can be secured, especially if his reformation
has been previously so far accomplished as to render the completion of the work probable.

A great trust has been confided to the officers of the Reform School; but the power to do good
is usually proportionate to the responsibility imposed upon the laborer. In this view, much
will be expected; but the expectations formed ought not to relate so much to results as to
the wisdom and humanity with which the operations are conducted. Massachusetts is charged with
the support of a great number of charitable and reformatory institutions. Their necessity springs
from the defects of social life; therefore their existence is a comparative rather than a positive
good; and he is the truest friend of the race who does most to remove the causes of poverty,
ignorance, insanity, mental and physical weakness, moral waywardness, and crime.

THE CARE AND REFORMATION OF THE NEGLECTED AND EXPOSED CLASSES OF CHILDREN.

[An Address delivered at the opening of the State Industrial School for Girls, at Lancaster,
Massachusetts.]

In man's limited view, the moral world presents a sad contrast to the natural. The natural
world is harmonious in all its parts; but the moral world is the theatre of disturbing and
conflicting forces, whose laws the finite mind cannot comprehend. The majesty and uniformity
of the planetary revolutions, which bring day and night, summer and winter, seed-time and harvest,
know no change. Worlds and systems of worlds are guided by a law of the Infinite Mind; and
so, through unnumbered years and myriads of years, birth and death, creation and decay, decrees
whose fixedness enables finite minds to predict the future, and rules whose elasticity is seen
in a never-ending variety of nature, all alike prove that the sin of disobedience is upon man
alone.

But, if man only, of all the varied creations of earth, may fall from his high estate, so to
him only is given the power to rise again, and feebly, yet with faith, advance towards the
Divine Excellence. This, then, is the great thought of the occasion, to be accepted by the
hearts and illustrated in the lives of all. The fallen may be raised up, the exposed may be
shielded, the wanderers may be called home, or else this house is built upon the sand, and
doomed to fall when the rains shall descend, the floods come, and the winds blow. The returning
autumn, with its harvest of sustenance and wealth, bids us contemplate again the mystery and
harmony of the natural world. The tree and the herb produce seed, and the seed again produces
the tree and the herb, each after its kind. There is a continued production and reproduction;
but of responsibility there is none. As there is no intelligent violation of law, there is
no accountability. Man, however, is an intelligent, dependent, fallible, and, of course, responsible
being. He is responsible for himself, responsible in some degree for his fellow-man. There
is not a chapter in the history of the human race, nor a day of its experience, which does
not show that the individual members are dependent upon, and responsible to, each other. This
great fact, of six thousand years' duration, at once presents to us the necessity for government,
and defines the limits of its powers and duties. Government, then, is a union of all for the
protection and welfare of each. This definition presents, in its principles and statement,
the highest form of human government,--a form not yet perfectly realized on earth. It sets
forth rather what government ought to be, than what it has been or is. Too often historical
governments, and living governments even, may be defined as a union of a few for their benefit,
and for the oppression of many. The reason of man has not often been consulted in their formation,
and the interests and principles of the masses have usually been disregarded in their administration.

A true government is at once representative, patriarchal, and paternal. In the path of duty
for this day and this occasion, we shall consider the last-named quality only,--governments
should be paternal. The paternal government is devoted to the elevation and improvement of
its members, with no ulterior motive except the necessary results of internal purity and strength.
Every government is, in some degree, no doubt, paternal. Nor are those governments to be regarded
as eminently so, where the people are most controlled in their private, personal affairs. These
are mere despotisms; and despotism is not a just nor necessary element of the paternal relation.
That government is most truly paternal which does most to enable its citizens or subjects to
regulate their own conduct, and determine their relations to others. In the midst of general
darkness, the paternal element of government has been a light to the human race. It modified
the patriarchal slavery of the Hebrews, relieved the iron rule of Sparta, made European feudalism
the hope of civilization in the Dark Ages, and the basis of its coming glories in the near
future; and it now leads men to look with toleration upon the despotism of Russia, and with
kindness upon the simplicity and arrogance of the Celestial Empire.

We complain, justly enough, that the world is governed too much; and yet, in a great degree,
we neglect the means by which the proper relations of society could be preserved, and the world
be governed less. In what works are the so-called Christian governments principally engaged?
Are they not seeking, by artifice, diplomacy, and war, to extend national boundaries, preserve
national honor, or enforce nice distinctions against the timid and weak? Yet it is plain that
a nation is powerful according to the character of the living elements of which it is composed.
If it is disorganized morally, uncultivated in intellect, ignorant, indolent, or wasteful in
its labor, its claims to greatness are destitute of solid foundation, and it must finally yield
to those that have sought and gained power by the elevation of the individual as the element
of the nation.

That nation, then, is wise, and destined to become truly great, which cultivates the best elements
of individual life and character. It is not enough to read the parable of the lost sheep, and
of the ninety and nine that went not astray, and then say, "Even so, it is not the will of
your Father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish," while the means
of salvation, as regards the life of this world merely, are very generally neglected. Such
neglect is followed by error and crime; and error and crime are followed by judgment not always
tempered with mercy.

While human governments debate questions of war and peace, of trade and revenue, of annexations
with ceremony, and appropriations of territory without ceremony, who shall answer to the Governor
and Judge of all for the neglect, indifference, and oppression, which beget and foster the
delinquencies of childhood, and harden the criminals of adult life?

And who shall answer for those distinctions of caste and systems of labor which so degrade
and famish masses of human beings, that the divine miracle of the feeding of the five thousand
must be multiplied many times over before the truths of nature or revelation can be received
into teachable minds or susceptible hearts? And who shall answer for the hereditary poverty,
ignorance and crime, which constitute a marked feature of English life, and are distinctly
visible upon the face of American civilization? These questions may point with sufficient distinctness
to the sources of the evils enumerated; but we are not to assume that mere human governments
can furnish an adequate and complete remedy. Yet this admitted inability to do everything is
no excuse for neglecting those things which are plainly within their power. Taking upon themselves
the parental character, forgetting that they have wrongs to avenge, and seeking reformation
through kindness, criminals and the causes of crime will diminish, if they do not disappear.
This is the responsibility of the nations, and the claim now made upon them. Individual civilization
and refinement have always been in advance of national; and national character is the mirrored
image of the individual characters, not excepting the humblest, of which the nation is composed.
Each foot of the ocean's surface has, in its fluidity or density or position, something of
the quality or power of every drop of water which rests or moves in the depths of the sea.
What is called national character is the face of the great society beneath; and, as that society
in its elements is elevated or debased, so will the national character rise or fall in the
estimation of all just men, and upon the page of impartial history. Government, which is the
organized expression of the will of society, should represent the best elements of which society
is composed; and it ought, therefore, to combat error and wrong, and seek to inaugurate labor,
justice, and truth, as the elements of stability, growth, and power. It must accept as its
principles of action the best rules of conduct in individuals. The man who avenges his personal
wrongs by personal attacks or vindictive retaliation, must sacrifice in some measure the sympathy
of the wise, the humane, and the good. So the nation which avenges real or fancied wrongs crushes
out the elements of humanity and a higher life, which, properly cultivated, might lead an erring
mortal to virtue and peace. The proper object of punishment is not vengeance, but the public
safety and the reformation of the criminal. Indeed, we may say that the sole object of punishment
is the reformation of the criminal; for there can be no safety to the public while the criminal
is unreformed. The punishment of the prison must, from its nature, be temporary; perpetual
confinement can be meted out to a few great crimes only. If, then, the result of punishment
be vengeance, and not reformation, the last state of society is worse than its first. The prison
must stand a sad monument of the want of true paternal government in the family and the state;
but, when it becomes the receptacle merely of the criminal, and all ideas of reformation are
banished from the hearts of convicts and the minds of keepers, its influence is evil, and only
evil continually.

Vice, driven from the presence of virtue, with no hope of reformation or of restoration to
society, begets vice, and becomes daily more and more loathsome. Misery is so universal that
some share falls to the lot of all; but that misery whose depths cannot be sounded, whose heights
cannot be scaled, is the fortune of the prison convict only, who has no hope of reformation
to virtue or of restoration to the world. His is the only misery that is unrelieved; his is
the only burden that is too great to be borne. To him the foliage of the tree, the murmur of
the brook, the mirror of the quiet lake, or the thunder of the heaving ocean, would be equally
acceptable. His separation from nature is no less burdensome than his separation from man.
The heart sinks, the spirit turns with a consuming fire upon itself, the soul is in despair;
the mind is first nerved and desperate, then wandering and savage, then idiotic, and finally
goes out in death. Governments cannot often afford to protect themselves, or to avenge themselves,
at such a cost. There may be great crimes on which such awful penalties should be visited;
but, for the honor of the race, let them be few.

We may err in our ideas of the true relations of the prison to the prisoner. We call a prison
good or bad when we see its walls, cells, workshops, its means of security, and points of observation.
These are very well. They are something; but they are not all. We might so judge a hospital
for the sick; and we did once so judge an asylum for the insane.

But what to the sick man are walls of wood, brick, granite, or marble? What are towers and
turrets, what are wards, halls, and verandas, if withal he is not cheered and sustained by
the sympathizing heart and helping hand?

And it may be that the old almshouse at Philadelphia, which was nearly destitute of material
aids, and had only superintendent, matrons, and assistants, was, all in all, the best insane
asylum in America.

We cannot neglect the claims of security, discipline, and labor, in the erection of jails and
prisons; but to acknowledge these merely will never produce the proper fruit of punishment--reformation.
Indeed, walls of stone, gates of iron, bolts, locks, and armed sentinels, though essential
to security, without which there could be neither punishment nor reformation, are in themselves
barriers rather than helps to moral progress. Standing outside, we cannot say what should be
done either in the insane hospital or the prison; but we can deduce from the experience of
modern times a safe rule for general conduct. In the insane hospital the patient is to be treated
as though he were sane; and in the jail the prisoner is to be treated, nearly as may be, as
though he were virtuous. This rule, especially as much of it as applies to the prisoner, may
be recklessness to some, to others folly, to others sin.

"The court awards it, and the law doth give it," is no doubt the essence and strength of governmental
justice in the sentence decreed; but it would be a sad calamity if there were no escape from
its literal fulfilment. And let no one borrow the words of Portia to the Jew, and say to the state,

       "Nor cut thou less nor more,
     But just a pound of flesh."

As the criminal staggers beneath the accumulated weight of his sin and its penalty, he should
feel that the state is not only just in the language of its law, but merciful in its administration;
that the government is, in truth, paternal. This feeling inspires confidence and hope; and
without these there can be no reformation. And, following this thought, we are led to say,
it is a sad and mischievous public delusion that the pardoning power is useless or pernicious.
It is a delusion; for it is the only means by which the state mingles mercy with its justice,--the
means by which the better sentiments of the prison are marshalled in favor of order, of law,
of progress. It is a public delusion; for it has infected not only the masses of society, who
know little of what is going on in courts and prisons, but its influence is observed upon the
bench and in the bar, especially among those who are accustomed to prosecute and try criminals.
This is not strange, nor shall it be a subject of complaint; but we must not always look upon
the prisoner as a criminal, and continually disregard his claims as a man. It is not often
easy, nor always possible, to make the proper distinction between the character and condition
of the prisoner. But the prison, strange as it may seem, follows the general law of life. It
has its public sentiment, its classes, its leading minds, as well as the university or the
state; it has its men of mark, either good or bad, as well as congress or parliament. As the
family, the church, or the school, is the reflection of the best face of society, so the prison
is the reflection of the worst face of society. But it nevertheless is society, and follows
its laws with as much fidelity as the world at large.

It is said that Abbé Fissiaux, the head of the colony of Marseilles, when visiting Mettray,
a kind of reform school, at which boys under sixteen years of age, who have committed offences
without discernment, are sent, asked the colonists to point out to him the three best boys.
The looks of the whole body immediately designated three young persons whose conduct had been
irreproachable to an exceptional degree. He then applied a more delicate test. "Point out to
me," said he, "the worst boy." All the children remained motionless, and made no sign; but
one little urchin came forward, with a pitiful air, and said, in a very low tone, "It is me."
Such were the public sentiment and sense of honor, even in a reform school. This frankness
in the lad was followed by reformation; and he became in after years a good soldier,--the life
anticipated for many members of the institution.

The pardoning power is not needed in reform and industrial schools, where the managers have
discretionary authority; but it is quite essential to the discipline of the prison to let the
light of hope into the prisoner's heart. Not that all are to enjoy the benefits of executive
clemency,--by no means: only the most worthy and promising are to be thus favored. But, for
many years, the Massachusetts prison has been improved and elevated in its tone and sentiment
above what it would have been; while, as it is believed, over ninety per cent. of the convicts
thus discharged have conducted themselves well. If the prisoner's conduct has not been, upon
the whole, reasonably good, and for a long time irreproachable, he has no chance for clemency;
and, whatever may be his conduct, and whatever may be the hopes inspired, he should not be
allowed to pass without the prison walls until a friend, labor, and a home, are secured for
him. And the exercise of the pardoning power, if it anticipate the expiration of the legal
sentence but a month, a week, or a day even, may change the whole subsequent life. Men, criminals,
convicts, are not insensible to kindness; and when the government shortens the legal sentence,
which is usually their measure of justice, they feel an additional obligation to so behave
as to bring no discredit upon a power which has been a source of inestimable joy to them. And
prisoners thus discharged have often gone forth with a feeling that the hopes of many whom
they had left behind were centred in them.

Mr. Charles Forster, of Charlestown, says, in a letter to me: "I have been connected with the
Massachusetts State Prison for a period of thirty-eight years, and have always felt a strong
interest in the improvement, welfare, and happiness, of the unfortunate men confined within
its walls. I am conversant with many touching cases of deep and heartfelt gratitude for kindly
acts and sympathy bestowed upon them, both during and subsequent to their imprisonment." And
the same gentleman says further, "I think that the proportion of persons discharged from prison
by executive clemency, who have subsequently been convicted of penal offences, is very small
indeed." To some, whose imaginations have pictured a broad waste or deep gulf between themselves
and the prisoner class, these may seem strange words; but there is no mystery in this language
to those who have listened to individual cases of crime and punishment. Men are tried and convicted
of crimes according to rules and definitions which are necessarily arbitrary and technical;
but the moral character of criminals is not very well defined by the rules and definitions
which have been applied to their respective cases. Our prisons contain men who are great and
professional criminals,--men who advisedly follow a life of crime themselves, and deliberately
educate generation after generation to a career of infamy and vice. As a general thing, mercy
to such men would be unpardonable folly. Of them I do not now speak. But there is another class,
who are involved in guilt and its punishment through the defects of early education, the misfortune
of orphanage, accident, sudden temptation, or the influence of evil companionship in youth.

The field from which this class is gathered is an extensive one, and its outer limits are near
to every hearthstone. To all these, prison life, unless it is relieved by a hope of restoration
to the world at the hand of mercy, is the school of vice, and a certain preparation for a career
of crime. As a matter of fact, this class does furnish recruits to supply the places of the
hardened villains who annually die, or permanently forsake the abodes of civilized men. What
hope can there be for a young man who remains in prison until the last day of his sentence
is measured by the sun in his course, and then passes into the world, with the mark of disgrace
and the mantle of shame upon him, to the society of the companions by whose influence he first
fell? For such a one there can be no hope. And be it always remembered that there are those
without the prison walls, as well as many within, who resist every effort to bring the wanderers
back to obedience and right. I was present at the prison in Charlestown when the model of a
bank-lock was taken from a young man whose term had nearly expired. The model was cut in wood,
after a plan drawn upon sand-paper by an experienced criminal, then recently convicted. This
old offender was so familiar with the lock, that he was able to reproduce all its parts from
memory alone. This fact shows the influence that may be exerted, even in prison, upon the characters
of the young and less vicious. Now, can any doubt that these classes, as classes, ought to
be separated? Nor let the question be met by the old statement, that all communication between
prisoners should be cut off. Humanity cannot defend, as a permanent system, the plan which
shuts up the criminal, unless he is a murderer, from the light of the human countenance. Such
penalties foster crimes, whose roots take hold of the state itself.

The result of the exercise of the pardoning power is believed to have been, upon the whole,
satisfactory. This is the concurrent testimony of officers and others whose opinions are entitled
to weight. Permit the statement of a single case, to which many similar ones might be added.
In a remote state of the West there is a respectable and successful farmer, who was once sentenced
to the penitentiary for life. His crime was committed in a moment of desperation, produced
by the contrast between a state of abject poverty in a strange land, at the age of twenty-three,
and the recollection of childhood and youth passed beneath the parental roof, surrounded by
the comforts and conveniences of the well-educated and well-conditioned classes of English
society. This, it is true, was a peculiar case. It was marked in the circumstances and enormity
of the crime, and marked in the subsequent good conduct of the prisoner. But can any one object,
that, after ten years' imprisonment, this man was allowed to try his fortunes once more among
his fellow-men? Are there those who would have had no faith in his uninterrupted good conduct;
in the abundant evidence of complete reformation; in the fact that, in prison and poverty and
disgrace, he had allied to him friends of name and fortune and Christian virtues, who were
ready to aid him in his good resolutions? If any such there be, let them visit the solitary
cell of the despairing convict, whose crime is so great that executive clemency fears to approach
it. Crime and despair have made the features appalling; all the worst passions of our nature
riot together in the temple made for the living God; and the death of the body is almost certainly
to be preceded by madness, insanity, and idiocy of the mind. Or, if any think that this person
escaped with too light an expiation for so great a crime, let them recall the incident of the
youth who was questioned because he looked with fond affection into the babbling face of the
running brook, and, apologizing, as it were, in reply said, "O, yes, it is very beautiful,
and especially to me, who have seen no water for four years, beside what I have had to drink!"

Nor is it assumed, in all that is said upon this subject, that the laws are severe, or that
the judicial administration of them is not characterized by justice and mercy. In the ordinary
course of affairs, the pardoning power is not resorted to for the correction of any error or
injustice of the courts; but it is the means by which the state tempers its justice with mercy;
and, if the penalties for crime were less than they are, the necessity for the exercise of
this power would still remain. It assumes that the object of the penal law is reformation;
and if this object, in some cases, can be attained by the exercise of the pardoning power,
while the rigid execution of the sentence would leave the criminal, as it usually will, still
hardened and unrepenting, is it not wise for the state to benefit itself, and save the prisoner,
by opening the prison-doors, and inviting the convict to a life of industry and virtue? And
let it never be forgotten, though it is the lowest view which can be taken of crime and prisons,
that the criminal class is the most expensive class of society. In general, it is a non-producing
class, and, whether in prison or out, is a heavy burden upon the public. The mere interest
of the money now expended in prisons of approved structure is, for each cell, equal annually
to the net income of a laboring man; and professional thieves, when at large, often gather
by their art, and expend in profligacy, many thousand dollars a year. And here we see how much
wiser it is, in an economical point of view, to save the child, or reform the man, than to
allow the adult criminal to go at large, or provide for his safe-keeping at the expense of
the state.

Under the influence of the pardoning power, wisely executed, the commonwealth becomes a family,
whose law is the law of kindness. It is the paternal element of government applied to a class
of people who, by every process of reasoning, would be found least susceptible to its influence.
It is the great power of the state, both in the wisdom required for its judicious exercise,
and in the beneficial results to which it may lead. Men may desire office for its emoluments
in money or fame; they may seek it in a spirit of rivalry, or for personal pride, or for the
opportunity it brings to reward friends and punish enemies; but all these are poor and paltry
compared with the divine privilege, exercised always in reference to the public welfare, of
elevating the prisoner to the companionship of men, and cheering him with words of encouragement
on his entrance anew to the duties of life.

Yet think not that the prison is a reformatory institution: far from it. If the prison should
be left to the influence of legitimate prison discipline merely, it is doubtful whether the
sum of improvement would equal the total of degradation. This may be said of the best prisons
of America, of New England. The prison usually contains every class, from the hardened convict,
incarcerated for house-breaking, robbery, or murder, to the youth who expiates his first offence,
committed under the influence of evil companions, or sudden temptation. The contact of these
two persons must be injurious to one of them, without in any degree improving the other. Therefore
the prison, considered without reference to the elevating influence of the pardoning power,
has but little ability to reform the bad, and yet possesses a sad tendency to debase the comparatively
good.

We miss, too, in the prison, another essential element of a reformatory institution. Reformation
in individual cases may take place under the most adverse circumstances; but an institution
cannot be called reformatory unless its prevailing moral sentiment is actively, vigorously,
and always, on the side of progress and virtue. This moral influence must proceed from the
officers of the institution; but it should be increased and strengthened by the sympathy and
support of the inmates. This can hardly be expected of the prison. The number of adult persons
experienced in crime and hardened by its penalties is usually so large, that the moral sentiment
of the officers, and the weak resolutions of the small class of prisoners, who, under favorable
circumstances, might be saved, are insufficient to give a healthy tone to the whole institution.
The prison is a battle-field of vice and virtue, with the advantage of position and numbers
on the side of vice. Indeed, there can hardly be a worse place for the young or the inexperienced
in crime. This is the testimony of reason and of all experience; yet the public mind is slow
to accept the remedy for the evil. It is a privilege to believe that the worst scenes of prison
life are not found in the United States. Consider this case, reported in an English journal,
The Ragged-School Magazine:

"D. F., aged about fourteen. Mother dead several years; father a drunkard, and deserted him
about three years ago. Has since lived as he best could,--sometimes going errands, sometimes
begging and thieving. Slept in lodging-houses when he had money; but very often walked the
streets at night, or lay under arches or door-steps. Has only one brother; he lives by thieving.
Does not know where he is; has no other friend that he knows; never learnt to read; was badly
off; picked a handkerchief out of a gentleman's pocket, and was caught by a policeman; sent
to Giltspur-street Prison; was fed on bread and water; instructed every day by chaplain and
schoolmaster; much impressed with what the chaplain said; felt anxious to do better; behaved
well in prison; was well flogged the morning he left; back bruised, but not quite bleeding;
was then turned into the street, ragged, barefooted, friendless, homeless, penniless; walked
about the streets till afternoon, when he received a penny from a gentleman to buy a loaf;
met, next day, some expert thieves in the Minories; went along with them, and continues in
a course of vagrancy and crime."

And what else could have been expected? The government, having sown tares, had no right to
gather wheat. Yet, had this boy been provided with a home, either in a family or a reform school,
with sufficient labor, and proper moral and intellectual culture, he might have been saved.
Of the three thousand persons annually in prison at Newgate, four hundred are less than sixteen
years of age; and twenty thousand children and youth under seventeen years of age yearly pass
through the prisons of England. "Many of the juvenile prisoners," it is said, "have been frequently
in prison, and are very hardened. Some, from nine to eleven, have been in prison repeatedly,
and have very little fear of it."

The officers of the Liverpool Borough Jail are united in the opinion that, when a boy comes
once, he is almost certain to come again and again, until he is transported. And, of every
one hundred young persons discharged from the principal prisons of Paris, seventy-five are
in the custody of the law within the next three months. A professed thief said to the Rev.
Mr. Clay, of England, "I am convinced of this, having too bitterly experienced it, that communication
in a prison has brought thousands to ruin. I speak not of boys only, but of men and women also."
And Mr. Hill, Recorder of Birmingham, says of the sentences imposed in his court, "We are compelled
to carry into operation an ignorant and vengeful system, which augments to a fearful extent
the very evils it was framed to correct." A few years ago, there was a lad in a New England
prison whose experience is a pertinent illustration of the evil we are now considering. His
father, a resident of a city, died while the boy was in infancy. He, however, soon passed beyond
the control of his mother, and at an early age was selected by a brace of thieves, who petted,
caressed, and humored him, until he was completely subject to their will. He was then made
useful to them in their profession; but at last they were all arrested while engaged in robbing
a store,--the boy being within the building, and the men stationed as sentinels without. In
this case, the discretion of the court, which distinguished in the sentence between the hardened
villains and the youth, was inadequate to the emergency. The child, unfit for the prison, and
sure to be contaminated by it, ought to have been sent to a house of reformation, a reform
school, or, perhaps better than either, to the custody of a well-regulated, industrious family.
Now, in such cases, the distinction which the law, judicially administered, does not make,
and cannot make, must be made by the executive in the wise exercise of the pardoning power.
But this power, in the nature of things, has its limits; and on one side it is limited to those
who have been convicted of crime.

At this point, we may see how faulty, and yet how constantly improving, has been the administration
of the criminal law. First, we have the prison without the pardoning power, except in cases
of mal-administration of the law,--a receptacle of the bad and good, where the former are not
improved, and the latter are hurried rapidly on in the path of degradation and crime. Then
we have the prison under the influence of the pardoning power, more or less wisely administered,
but, in its best form, able only to arrest and counteract partially the tendencies to evil.
Next, from the imperfections of this system an advancing civilization has evoked the Reform
School, which gathers in the young criminals and viciously inclined youth, and prepares them,
by labor, and culture of the mind and heart, to resist the temptations of life. But this institution
seems to wait, though it may not always in reality do so, until the candidate is actually a
criminal.

Hence the necessity which calls us to-day to consider the means adopted elsewhere, and the
means now to be employed here, to save the young and exposed from the dangers which surround them.

Passing, then, in review, ladies and gentlemen, the thoughts which have been presented, I deduce
from them for your assent and support, if so it please you, the following propositions as the
basis of what I have yet to say:

I. Government, in the prevention and punishment of crime, should be paternal.

II. The object of punishment should be reformation, and not revenge.

III. The law of reformation in the state, as in the family, is the law of kindness.

IV. As criminals vary in age and in experience as criminals, so should their treatment vary.

V. Prisons and jails are not, in their foundation and management, reformatory institutions,
and only become so through influences not necessarily nor ordinarily acting upon them.

VI. As prisons and jails deter from crime through fear only, exert very little moral influence
upon the youth of either sex, and fail in many respects and in a majority of cases as reformatory
institutions, we ought to avail ourselves of any new agency which promises success.

Influenced, as we may reasonably suppose, by these or kindred sentiments, and aided by the
noblest exhibitions of private benevolence, the state has here founded a school for the prevention
of crime. As we have everywhere among us schools whose leading object is the development of
the intellect, so we now dedicate a school whose leading object is the development of the affections
as the basis of the cardinal virtues of life.

The design of this institution is so well expressed by the trustees, that it is a favor to
us all for me to read the first chapter of the by-laws, which, by the consent of the Governor
and Council, have been established:

"The intention of the state government, and of the benevolent individuals who have contributed
to the establishment of this institution, is to secure a home and a school for such girls as
may be presented to the magistrates of the state, appointed for that purpose, as vagrants,
perversely obstinate, deprived of the control and culture of their natural guardians, or guilty
of petty offences, and exposed to a life of crime and wretchedness.

"For such young persons it is proposed to provide, not a prison for their restraint and correction,
but a family school, where, under the firm but kind discipline of a judicious home, they shall
be carefully instructed in all the branches of a good education; their moral affections be
developed and cultivated by the example and affectionate care of one who shall hold the relation
of a mother to them; be instructed in useful and appropriate forms of female industry; and,
in short, be fitted to become virtuous and happy members of society, and to take respectable
positions in such relations in life as Providence shall hereafter mark out for them.

"It is to be distinctly understood that the institution is not to be considered a place of
punishment, or its subjects as criminals. It is to be an inviting refuge, into which the exposed
may be gathered to be saved from a course which would inevitably end in penal confinement,
irretrievable ruin, or hopeless degradation.

"The inmates are to be considered hopeful and promising subjects of appropriate culture, and
to be instructed and watched over with the care and kindness which their peculiar exposures
demand, and with the confidence which youth should ever inspire.

"The restraint and the discipline which will be necessary are to be such as would be appropriate
in a Christian family or in a small boarding-school; and the 'law of kindness' should be written
upon the heart of every officer of the institution. The chief end to be obtained, in all the
culture and discipline, is the proper development of the faculties and moral affections of
the inmates, however they may have been heretofore neglected or perverted; and to teach them
the art, and aid them in securing the power, of self-government."

Under the influence of these sentiments, we pass, if possible, in the work of reformation,
from the rigor of the prison to the innocent excitement and rivalry of the school, the comfort,
confidence and joys of home. This institution assumes that crime, to some extent at least,
is social, local, or hereditary, in its origin; that the career of hardened criminals often
takes its rise in poverty, idleness, ignorance, orphanage, desertion, or intemperance of parents,
evil example, or the indifference, scorn and neglect of society. It assumes, also, that there
is a period of life--childhood and youth--when these, the first indications of moral death,
may be eradicated, or their influence for evil controlled. In this land of education, of liberty,
of law, of labor and religion, we may not easily imagine how universal the enumerated evils
are in many portions of Europe. The existence of these evils is in some degree owing to institutions
which favor a few, and oppress the masses; but it is also in a measure due to the fact that
Europe is both old and multitudinous. America, though still young, is even now multitudinous.
Hence, both here and there, crime is social and local. The truth of this statement is proportionate
to the force of the causes in the respective countries.

We are assembled upon a sloping hillside, over-looking a quiet country village. Happy homes
are embowered in living groves, whose summer foliage is emblematical of innocence, progress,
and peace. We have here a social life, with natural impulses, cultivated worldly interests,
moral and religious sentiments, all on the side of virtue. Crime here is not social. If it
appear at all, it is segregated; and, as the burning taper expires when placed at the centre
of the spirit lamp's coiling sheet of flame, so vice and crime cannot thrive in the genial
embrace of virtue.

Circumstances are here unfavorable to crime; it is never social; but sometimes, though not
often, it is hereditary. A family for many generations seems to have a criminal tendency. Perhaps
the members are not in any generation guilty of great crimes, but often of lesser ones; and
are, moreover, in the daily practice of vices that give rise to suspicion, neglect, and reproach.
Here together are associated, and made hereditary, poverty, ignorance, idleness, beggary, and
vagrancy. Surely these instances are not common, probably not so common as they were in the
last generation. But how is the boy or girl of such a family to rise above these circumstances,
and throw off these weights? Occasionally one of great energy of character may do so; but,
if the children of more fortunate classes can scarcely escape the influence of temporary evil
example, how shall they who are born to a heritage of poverty, ignorance, and ever-present
evil counsel and conduct under the guise of parental authority, pass to the position of intelligent,
industrious, respectable members of society? Some external influence must be applied; by some
means from without, the spell must be broken; the fatal succession of vicious homes must be
interrupted. The family has here failed to discharge its duty to itself and to the state; and
shall not the state do its duty to itself, by assuming the paternal relation under the guidance
of that law of kindness, which we have seen effectual to control the insane, and melt the hardened
criminal? But in cities we find vice, not only hereditary in families, but local and social;
so that streets and squares are given up, as it were, to the idle and vicious, whose numbers
and influence produce and perpetuate a public sentiment in support of their daily practices.
This phase of life is not due to the fact that cities are wealthy, or that they are engaged
in manufactures or commerce; but to the single fact that they are multitudinous, and their
inhabitants are, therefore, in daily contact with each other, while, in the country, individuals
and families are comparatively isolated. Yet some may very well doubt whether such an institution
as this, with all the benign influences of home which we hope to see centred and diffusive
here, will save a child of either sex, whose first years shall have been so unfavorable to
a life of virtue.

The answer is plain: as in other reformatory institutions, there will be some successes and
some failures. The failures will be reckoned as they were; the successes will be a clear gain.

But investigation and trial will show a natural aptitude or instinct in children that will
aid in their improvement and reformation. There has been in one of our public schools a lad,
who, at the age of fourteen years, could not recall distinctly the circumstances of his life
previous to the time when he was a newsboy in the city of New York. He was ignorant of father,
mother, kindred, family name, and nation. At an early age, he travelled through the middle,
southern and south-western states, engaged in selling papers and trash literature; and, for
a time, he was employed by a showman to stand outside the tent and describe and exaggerate
the attractions within. When he was in his fourteenth year, he accepted the offer of a permanent
home; his chief object being, as he said, to obtain an education. "I have found," said he,
"that a man cannot do much in this country unless he has some learning." This truth, simple,
and resting upon a low view of education, may yet be of infinite value if accepted by those
who, even among us, are advancing to adult life without the preparation which our common schools
are well fitted to furnish. And the case of this lad may be yet further useful by showing how
compensation is provided for evils and neglects in mental and moral relations, as well as in
the physical and natural world. Though ignorant of books, he was thoroughly and extensively
acquainted with things, and consequently made rapid progress in the knowledge of signs; for
they were immediately applied, and of course remembered. In a few months, he took a respectable
position among lads of his age. The world had done for this boy what good schools do not always
accomplish,--made him familiar with things before he was troubled with the signs which stand
for them. There is an ignorance in manhood; an ignorance under the show of profound learning;
an ignorance for which schools, academies and colleges, are often responsible; an ignorance
that neither schools, academies nor colleges, can conceal from the humblest intellects; an
ignorance of life and things as they are within the sphere of our own observation. From this
most deplorable ignorance this boy had escaped; and the light of learning illumined his mind,
as the sun in his daily return reveals anew those forms of life, which, even in an ungenial
spring and early summer, his rays had warmed into existence, and nourished and cherished in
their progress towards perfection.

And, ladies and gentlemen, let us indulge the hope that the events of this day and the faith
of this assembly will declare that it is possible to save the children of orphanage, intemperance,
neglect, scorn and ignorance, from many of the evils which surround them. Let it not be assumed
and believed that the task of training and saving girls is less hopeful than similar labors
in behalf of the other sex. It has been found true in Europe, and it is a prevailing opinion
in this country, that, among adults, the reformation of females is more difficult than the
reformation of males. But an analysis of this fact, assuming it to be true, will unfold qualities
of female character that render it peculiarly easy to shield and save girls who are exposed
to a life of crime; for, be it remembered, this institution deals with mere children, who are
exposed, but not yet lost. It differs, in this respect, from most institutions, although many
include this class with others. And it may be well to remark, that every reformatory school
in Europe, even those altogether penal,--as Parkhurst in England, and Mettray in France,--have
had some measure of success. Eighty-nine per cent. of the colons, or convicts, at Mettray,
have become respectable and useful; while, of the youth sent to the ordinary jails and prisons,
seventy-five per cent. are totally lost. It is not fair, therefore, to assume that this attempt
will fail. The degree of success will depend upon circumstances and causes, to a great extent,
within human control. There are, however, three elements of success, so distinct that they
may well stand as the appropriate divisions of what remains for consideration. They are the
right action of the government; the faithful conduct of superintendent, matrons, and assistants;
the sympathy and aid of the people of the state in matters which do not admit of legislative
interference.

The act of the Legislature, though voluminous in its details, contemplates only this: A home
for girls between seven and sixteen years of age, who are found "in circumstances of want and
suffering, or of neglect, exposure, or abandonment, or of beggary." The first idea of home
precludes the possibility of the inmates being sent here as a punishment for crime; therefore
they are neither adjudged nor actual criminals, but persons exposed to a vicious life. Secondly,
the idea of home involves the necessity of reproducing the family relation, as circumstances
may permit. Hence, the members of this institution are to be divided into families; and over
each a matron will preside, who is to be a kind, affectionate, discreet mother to the children.

And here, for once, in Massachusetts, a public institution has escaped the tyranny of bricks
and mortar; and we are permitted to indulge the hope, that any future additions will tend to
make this spot a neighborhood of unostentatious cottages, quiet rural homes, rather than the
seat of a vast edifice, which may provoke the wonder of the sight-seer, inflame local or state
pride, but can never be an effectual, economical agency in the work of reformation. Every public
institution has some great object. Architecture should bend itself to that object, and become
its servant; and it must ever be deemed a mistake, when utility is sacrificed that art or fancy
may have its way.

Reformation, if wrought by external influences, is the result of personal kindness. Personal
kindness can exist only where there is intimate personal acquaintance; this acquaintance is
impossible in an institution of two, three, or five hundred inmates. But, in a family of ten,
twenty, or thirty, this knowledge will exist, and this kindness abound. Warm personal attachments
will grow up in the family, and these attachments are likely to become safeguards of virtue.

Nor let the objection prevail that the expense is to be increased. It is not the purpose to
set up an establishment and maintain it for a specific sum of money, but to provide thorough
mental and moral training for the inmates. Make the work efficient, though it be limited to
a small number, rather than inaugurate a magnificent failure.

It is sometimes the bane of the poor that they do not work, and it is often equally the bane
of the rich that they have nothing to do. The idle, both rich and poor, carry a weight of reproach
that not all ought to bear. The disposition and the ability to labor are both the result of
education; and why should the uneducated be better able to labor than to read Greek and Latin?
Surely only that there are more teachers in one department than in the others; but a good teacher
of labor may be as uncommon as a good teacher of Latin or Greek. There is a false, vicious,
unmanly pride, which leads our youth of both sexes to shun labor; and it is the business of
the true teacher to extirpate this growth of a diseased civilization. And we could have no
faith in this school, if it were not a school of industry as well as of morality,--a school
in which the divine law of labor is to be observed equally with the laws of men. Industry is
near to all the virtues. In this era every branch of labor is an art, and sometimes it is necessary
for the laborer to be both an artist and a scientific person. How great, then, the misfortune
of those, whether rich or poor, who are uninstructed in the business of life! We should hardly
know what judgment to pass upon a man of wealth who should entirely neglect the education of
his children in schools; but the common indifference to industrial learning is not less reprehensible.
Labor should be systematic; not constant, indeed, but always to be reckoned as the great business
of life, never to be avoided, never to cease.

Labor gives us a better knowledge of the fulness, magnificence and glory, of the divine blessing
of creation. This lesson may be learned by the farmer in the wonderful growth of vegetation;
by the artist, in the powers of invention and taste of the human mind and soul; by the man
of science, in the beauty of an insect or the order of a universe. The vision of the idle is
limited. The ability to see may be improved by education as much as the ability to read, remember,
or converse. With many people, not seeing is a habit. Near-sighted persons are generally those
who declined to look at distant objects; and so nature, true to the most perfect rules of economy,
refused to keep in order faculties that were entirely neglected. The laborer's recompense is
not money, nor the accumulation of worldly goods chiefly; but it is in his increased ability
to observe, appreciate, and enjoy the world, with its beauties and blessings. Nor is labor,
the penalty for sin, a punishment merely, but a divine means of reformation. It is, therefore,
a moral discipline that all should submit to; and especially is it a means by which the youth
here are to be prepared for the duties of life. But industry is not only near to all the virtues;
it is itself a virtue, as idleness is a vice. The word labor is, of course, used in the broadest
signification. Labor is any honest employment, or use of the head or hands, which brings good
to ourselves, and consequently, though indirectly, brings good to our fellow-men.

The state has now furnished a home, reproduced, as far as practicable, the family relation,
and provided for a class of neglected and exposed girls the means of mental, industrial, moral,
and religious culture. The plan appears well; but its practical value depends upon the fidelity
of its execution by the superintendent, matrons and assistants. I venture to predict in advance,
that the degree of success is mainly within their control. This is a school, they are the teachers;
and they must bend to the rule which all true teachers willingly accept.

The teacher must be what he would have his pupils become. This was the standard of the great
Teacher; this is the aim of all who desire to make education a matter of reality and life,
and not merely a knowledge of signs and forms. Here will be needed a spirit and principle of
devotion which will be fruitful in humility, patience, earnestness, energy, good words and
works for all. Here must be strictness, possibly sternness of discipline; but this is not incompatible
with the qualities mentioned. It is a principle at Mettray to combine unbounded personal kindness
with a rigid exclusion of personal indulgence.

This principle produces good results that are two-fold in their influence. First, personal
kindness in the teacher induces a reciprocal quality in the pupils. The habit of personal kindness,
proceeding from right feelings, is a potent element of good in the family, the school, and
the prison. Indeed, it is an element of good citizenship; and no one destitute of this quality
ought to be intrusted with the education of children, or the punishment and reformation of
criminals.

Secondly, the rigid exclusion of personal indulgence trains the inmates in the virtue of self-control.
And may it not be forgotten that all apparent reformation must be hedged by this cardinal virtue
of practical life! Otherwise the best-formed expectations will fail; the highest hopes will
be disappointed; and the life of these teachers, and the promise of the youth who may be gathered
here, will be like the sun and the winds upon the desert, which bring neither refreshing showers
nor fruitful harvests. Every form of labor requires faith. This labor requires faith in yourselves,
and faith in others;--faith in yourselves, as teachers here, based upon your own knowledge
of what you are and are to do; and faith in others upon the divine declaration that God breathed
into man the breath of life, and he became a living soul,--not merely as the previous creations,
possessed of animal life; but as a sentient, intellectual, and moral being, capable of a progressive,
immortal existence.

     "'Tis nature's law
     That none, the meanest of created things,

            *       *       *       *       *

                                  Should exist
     Divorced from good,--a spirit and pulse of good,
     A life and soul, to every mode of being
     Inseparably linked.

     See, then, your only conflict is with men;
     And your sole strife is to defend and teach
     The unillumined, who, without such care,
     Must dwindle."

And always, as in the beginning, the reliance of this school is upon the people of the commonwealth,
whose voice has spoken into existence another instrumentality to give eyes to the blind, ears
to the deaf, a heart for the work of this life, and a hope for an hereafter, to those who from
neglect and vicious example would soon pass the period of reformation. But may the people always
bear in mind the indisputable truth, that schools for the criminal and the exposed yield not
their perfect fruits in a day or a year! They must, if they will know whether the seed here
planted produces a harvest, wait for the birth and growth of one generation, the decay and
death of another. Yet these years of delay will not be years of uncertainty. The public faith
will be strengthened continually by cases of reformation, usefulness, and virtue. But, whether
these cases be few or many, let no one despond. The career of the criminal is, often in money
and always in influence, the heaviest burden which an individual can impose upon society.

This is a school for girls; and we may properly appeal to the women of Massachusetts to do
their duty to this institution, and to the cause it represents. We can already see the second
stage in the existence of many of those who are to be sent here; and there is good reason to
fear that the relation of mistress and servant among us is in some degree destitute of those
moral qualities that make the house a home for all who dwell beneath its roof. But, whether
this fear be the voice of truth or the suggestion of prejudice, that woman shall not be held
blameless, who, under the influence of indolence, pride, fashion, or avarice, shall neglect,
abuse, or oppress, the humblest of her sex who goes forth from these walls into the broad and
dangerous path of life. But this day shall not leave the impression that they who are most
interested in the elevation and refinement of female character are indifferent to the means
employed, and the results which are to wait on them.

The greatest delineator of human character in this age says, as the images of neglected children
pass before his vision:

"There is not one of them--not one--but sows a harvest mankind must reap. From every seed of
evil in this boy a field of ruin is grown that shall be gathered in, and garnered up, and sown
again in many places in the world, until regions are over-spread with wickedness enough to
raise the waters of another deluge. Open and unpunished murder in a city's streets would be
less guilty in its daily toleration than one such spectacle as this. There is not a father,
by whose side, in his daily or nightly walk, these creatures pass; there is not a mother among
all the ranks of loving mothers in this land; there is no one risen from the state of childhood,
but shall be responsible, in his or her degree, for this enormity. There is not a country throughout
the earth on which it would not bring a curse. There is no religion upon earth that it would
not deny; there is no people on earth that it would not put to shame."

This institution, then, in the true relation of things, is not the glory of the state, but
its shame. It speaks of families, of schools, of the church, of the state, not yet educated
to the discharge of their respective duties in the right way. But it is the glory of the state
as a visible effort to correct evils, atone for neglects, and compensate for wrongs. It comes
to do, in part at least, what the family, the school, the press, the library, the Sabbath,
have nest yet perfectly accomplished. As these agencies partially failed, so will this; but,
as the law of progress exists for all, because perfection with us is unattainable, we may reasonably
have faith in human improvement, and trust that the life of each succeeding generation shall
unite, in ever-increasing proportions, the innocence of childhood with the wisdom of age.

ELEMENTARY TRAINING IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. Until recently teaching was almost an unknown art;
and we are at present struggling against ignorance without any well-defined plan, and attempting
to develop and build up the immortal character of children, without a philosophical and generally
accepted theory of the nature of the human mind. There are complaints that the duties and exactions
of the schools injure the health and impair the constitutions of pupils; that the progress
in intellectual attainments is not always what it should be; that the training given is sometimes
determined by the wishes of committees against the better judgment of competent teachers; that
the text-books are defective; that the studies in the common schools are too numerous; that
the elements are consequently neglected; and that, in fine, too much thought is bestowed upon
exhibitions and contests for public prizes, to the injury of good learning, and of individual
and general character. For these complaints there is some foundation; but care should be exercised
lest incidental and necessary evils become, in the public estimation, great wrongs, and exceptional
cases the evidence of general facts.

It is to some extent true that the duties and exactions of the schools seriously test the health
of pupils; but it is, as I believe, more generally true that many pupils are physically unable
to meet the ordinary and proper duties of the school-room. School life, as usually conducted,
is physically injurious, and our best efforts thus far have been limited to the dissemination
of elementary knowledge of physiology as a science, and to an acquaintance with a limited number
of important physiological facts. Yet even here little has been accomplished in comparison
with what may be done. In this department there is much instruction given that has no practical
value, and children are often permitted to live in daily and uniform neglect of the most essential
truths of science and the facts of human experience. Neither physiology nor hygiene can be
of much value in the schools, as a study, unless there is an application of what is taught.
Great proficiency cannot be made in these branches in the brief period of school life; but
a competent teacher may induce the pupils to put in practice the lessons that are applicable
to childhood and youth. If, however, as is sometimes the case, pupils are undermining the physical
constitution in their efforts to know how they are made, the loss is, unquestionably, more
than the gain. Physical health and growth depend, first, upon opportunity; and hence it happens
that, where physical life is most defective, there the greatest difficulties in the way of
its improvement are found. Boys born in the country, living upon farms, accustomed continually
to outdoor labors and sports, walking a mile or more every day to school, have but little use,
in their own persons, for the science or facts of physiology; and it is a very rare thing,
where such conditions have existed, that any teacher is able to exact an amount of intellectual
service that proves in any perceptible degree injurious.

But these opportunities are not so generally enjoyed by girls, and the mass of children in
cities are wholly deprived of them. In the country, and even in villages and towns of considerable
size, there is no excuse, better than ignorance or indifference, for the lack of judicious
and efficient physical training of children and youth of both sexes. But ignorance and indifference
are facts; and, while and where they exist, they are prejudicial to the growth of mind and
body. The age at which children should be admitted to school has not been ascertained, nor
can a satisfactory rule upon this point ever be laid down. If children are not in schools,
they are yet subject to influences that are formative of character. When proper government
and methods of education exist at home, the presence of the child in school at an early age
is not desirable. Even when education at home is not methodical, it may be continued until
the child is seven or even eight years of age, if it is at once moral, intelligent, and controlling.
It is not, however, wise to expect a child who is infirm physically to perform the labors imposed
by the necessary and proper regulations of school. When children enjoy good health, and are
not blessed with suitable training at home, they may be introduced to the school, at the age
of five years, with positive advantage to themselves and to society.

When the child is a member of the school, what shall be done with him? He must first be taught
to take an interest in the exercises by making the exercises interesting to him. That the transition
from home to the school may be easy, he should first occupy himself with those topics and studies
that are presented to the eye and to the ear, and may be mastered, so as to produce the sensation
that follows achievement with only a moderate use of the reasoning and reflective faculties.
Among these are reading, writing, music, and drawing. This is also the time when object lessons
may be given with great advantage. The forms and names of geometrical solids may be taught.
Exercises may be introduced tending to develop those powers by which we comprehend the qualities
of color, size, density, form, and weight. Important moral truths may be presented with the
aid of suitable illustrations. In every school the teacher and text-books may be considered
a positive quality which should balance the negative power of the school itself. In primary
schools text-books have but little value, and the chief reliance is, therefore, upon the teacher.
Instruction must be mainly oral; hence the mind of the teacher should be well furnished, and
her capacities chastened by considerable experience. As the pupils are unable to study, the
teacher must lead in all their exercises, and find profitable employment for the children,
or they will give themselves up to play or to stupid listlessness. Of these alternatives, the
latter is more objectionable than the former.

It is, of course, not often possible for a teacher to occupy herself six hours a day with a
single class in a primary school, especially if she confines her attention to the studies enumerated.
In many schools, of various grades, gymnastic exercises have been introduced with marked advantage.
There are many such exercises which do not need apparatus, and in which the teacher can properly
lead.

These furnish a healthful variety to the studies usually pursued, and they prepare the pupils
to receive appropriate instruction in sitting, standing, and in the modulation and use of the
voice. Indeed, gymnastic exercises are indispensable aids to proper training in reading, which,
as an art of a high order, is immediately dependent upon position, habits of breathing, the
consequent power of voice, and expressiveness of tone. I am fully satisfied that much more
may be done in the early period of school life than is usually accomplished. In the district
mixed schools the primary pupils receive but little attention, and they are not infrequently
occupied from one to three years in obtaining an imperfect knowledge of the alphabet. Usually
much better results are attained by the combined agency of the home and the school, but there
is an average loss of one-fourth of the time employed in teaching and learning the elements
of our language.

Mr. Philbrick, Superintendent of Public Schools in Boston, has taught and trained a class of
fifty primary-school pupils with a degree of success which fully sustains the statement of
the average waste in schools generally. Twenty-two lessons of a half-hour each were given;
and in this brief period of time the class, with a few exceptions, were so well advanced that
they could write the alphabet in capital and script hand, give the elementary sounds of the
letters, produce and name the Arabic characters and the common geometrical figures found upon
Holbrook's slates. I saw a girl, five and a half years of age, write the alphabet without delay
in script hand, in a manner that would have been creditable to a pupil in a grammar school.

I present Mr. Philbrick's own account of his mode of proceeding, in an extract from his third
quarterly report to the school committee of the city of Boston.

"The regulations relating to the primary schools require every scholar to be provided with
a slate, and to employ the time not otherwise occupied in drawing or writing words from their
spelling lessons, on their slates, in a plain script hand. It is further stated, in the same
connection, that the teachers are expected to take special pains to teach the first class to
write--not print--all the letters of the alphabet on slates.

"The language of this requirement seems to imply that the classes below the first are to draw
and write words, in a plain script hand, without any special pains to teach them, and that
by such occupation they were to be kept from idleness. As I saw neither of these objects accomplished
in any primary school, I thought it worth while to satisfy myself, by actual experiment, what
can and ought to be done, in the use of the slate and blackboard, in teaching writing and drawing
in primary schools. To accomplish this object, I have given a course of lessons in a graded
or classified school of the third class. The number of pupils instructed in the class was about
fifty. The materials of the school are rather below the average; about twenty of the pupils
being of that description usually found in schools for special instruction. The school-room
is furnished, as every primary school-room should be, with stationary chairs and desks, and
Holbrook's primary slates. Twenty-two lessons, of from thirty to forty minutes each, were given,
about one-third of the time being devoted to drawing, and two-thirds to writing. As to the
method pursued, the main points were, to present but a single element at a time; to illustrate
on the blackboard defects and excellences in execution; frequent review of the ground passed
over, especially in the first steps of the course; a vigorous exercise of all the mental faculties
requisite for the performance of the task; and a desire for improvement, encouraged and stimulated
by the best and strongest available motives; the greater part of the time being bestowed upon
the dull and backward pupils.

"The result has exceeded my expectations. About three-fourths of the number taught can draw
most of the simple mathematical lines and figures, given as copies on the slates used, with
tolerable accuracy, and write all the letters of the alphabet in a fair script hand. This experiment
satisfies me that, with the proper facilities, the three upper classes in graded primary schools
can be taught to write the letters of the alphabet in a plain script hand, and even to join
them into words, without any material hindrance to the other required studies; and, moreover,
that the great remedy for the complaint of want of time, in these schools, is the increase
of skill in the art of teaching."

It is well known that in this country and in Europe methods of teaching the alphabet have been
introduced which materially diminish the labor of teachers, and lessen the drudgery to which
children are usually subjected. The alphabet is taught as an object lesson. The object is usually
an animal, plant, or flower. More frequently the first. The mind of the child is awakened either
by the presence of the animal, or by a brief but vivid description of its characteristics.
The children are first required to pronounce properly the name of the animal. Here is an opportunity
for training in the use of the voice, and in the art of breathing, with which the general health,
as well as the vocal power, is intimately connected. The word which is the name of the animal
is analyzed into its elementary sounds. It may then be reconstructed without the aid of visible
signs, either written or printed. Next the teacher produces the signs which stand for the several
sounds, and gives their names. The letters are presented in any way that suits the teacher.
There may be no better method than to produce them upon the blackboard, as this course encourages
the pupils to draw them upon their slates, and thus they are at once, and without formal preliminaries,
engaged in writing.

An outline of the animal may be drawn upon the blackboard, which the pupils will eagerly copy;
and though this exercise may not be valuable in a high degree, as preparation for the systematic
study of drawing, yet it trains the perceptive and reflective faculties in a manner that is
pleasant to the great majority of children. It is also in the power of the teacher, at any
point in the exercises, and with reference both to variety and usefulness, to give the most
apparent facts, which to children are the most interesting facts, in the natural history of
the animal. This plan contemplates instruction in pronunciation in connection with exercises
in breathing, in the elementary sounds of words both consonant and vowel, in the names of letters,
in writing and drawing, to all of which may be added something of natural history. It is of
course to be understood that such exercises would be extended over many lessons, be subject
to frequent reviews, and valuable in proportion to the teacher's ability to interest children.
The outline given is suggestive, merely, and it is not presented as a plan of a model course;
but enough has been done and is doing in this department to warrant increased attention, and
to justify the belief that a degree of progress will soon be made in teaching the elements
that will mark the epoch as a revolution in educational affairs. It is to be observed that
the system indicated requires a high order of teaching talent. Only thorough professional culture,
or long and careful experience, will meet the claims of such a course. It is quite plain, however,
that no advantage would arise from keeping pupils in school six hours each day; and that, regarding
only the intellectual advancement of the child during the elementary course, his presence might
be reduced to two hours, or possibly in some cases to one: provided, always, that he could
enjoy, with his class associates, the undivided attention of the teacher. In this view of the
subject, it would be possible, where the primary schools are graded, as in portions of the
city of Boston, for one teacher to take charge of two classes or schools, each for an hour
in the forenoon and an hour in the afternoon. This arrangement would apply only to the younger
pupils; yet I am aware that parents and the public would be solicitous concerning the manner
of employing the time that would remain. In the cities this question is one of magnitude, and
there are strong reasons for declining any proposition to reduce the school day full one-half,
which does hot provide occupation for the children during the remainder of the time. It is
only in connection with such a proposition that projects for gymnastic training are practicable.
When children are employed six hours in school, it is not easy to find time for a course of
systematic physical education; and physical education, to be productive of appreciable advantages,
must be systematic. When left to children and youth, or to the care of parents, very little
will be accomplished. Children will participate in the customary sports, and perform the allotted
labors; but in cities these sports and labors are inadequate even for boys, and in country,
as well as city, girls are often the victims of neglect in this respect. Availing ourselves,
then, of the light shed by recent experience upon the subject of primary instruction, it seems
possible to diminish the length of the school day with a gain rather than a loss of educational
power. This change may be followed by the establishment, in cities and large towns, of public
gymnasiums, where teachers answering in moral qualifications to the requisitions of the laws
shall be employed, and where each child, for one, two, or three years, shall receive discreet
and careful, but vigorous physical training. After a few years thus passed in corresponding
and healthful development of the mind and body, the pupil is prepared for admission to the
advanced schools, where he can submit, with perfect safety, to greater mental requirements
even than are now made. The school, as at present constituted, cannot do much for physical
education; and it must, as a necessity and a duty, graduate its demands to the physical as
well as the intellectual abilities of its pupils. But I am satisfied that it is occasionally
made to bear a weight of reproach that ought to be laid upon the customs and habits of domestic,
social and general life.

Assuming that the principal work of the primary schools, after moral and physical culture,
should be to give instruction in reading, spelling, writing, music and drawing, it is just
to say that special attention should be bestowed upon the two branches first named. So imperfectly
is reading sometimes taught, that pupils are found in advanced classes, and in advanced schools,
whose progress in other branches is retarded by their inability to read the language fluently
and intelligently. When children are well educated in reading, they find profitable employment;
and they are, of course, by the knowledge of language acquired, able to comprehend, with greater
facility, every study to which they are called.

Pupils often appear dull in grammar, geography and arithmetic, merely because they are poor
readers. A child is not qualified to use a text-book of any science until he is able to read
with facility, as we are accustomed to speak, in groups of words. This ability he cannot acquire
without a great deal of practice. If phonetic spelling is commenced with the alphabet, he will
be accurately trained in that art also. It is certain that reading, writing and spelling, have
been neglected in our schools generally.

If there is to be a reform, it must be commenced, and in a considerable degree accomplished,
in the primary schools. These studies will be taught afterwards; but the grammar and high schools
can never compensate for any defect permitted, or any wrong done, in the primary schools. Reading
is first mechanical, and then intellectual and emotional. In the primary schools attention
is first given to mechanical training, while the intellectual and emotional culture is necessarily
in a degree postponed. When the first part of the work is thoroughly done, there is no ground
for complaint, and we may look to the teachers of advanced classes and schools for the proper
performance of the remaining duty. The ability to spell arbitrarily, either in writing or orally,
and the ability to read mechanically,--that is, the ability to seize the words readily, and
utter them fluently and accurately,--must be acquired by much spelling and much reading.

This work belongs to the early years of school-life; and, if it can be faithfully performed,
the introduction of text-books in grammar, geography and arithmetic, may be wisely postponed.
But it is a sad condition of things, which we are often compelled to contemplate, when a pupil,
who might have become a respectable reader had the elementary training been careful, accurate
and long-continued, is introduced to an advanced class, and there struggles against obstacles
which he cannot comprehend, and which the teacher cannot remove, and finally leaves the school
without the ability to read in a manner intelligible to himself, or satisfactory to others.
It is the appropriate work of primary schools, and of the teachers of primary classes in district
schools, to develop and chasten the moral powers of children, to train them in those habits
and practices that are favorable to health and life, whether anything is known of physiology
as a science or not, and to give the best culture possible to the eye, the ear, the hand and
the voice. This plan is comprehensive enough for any teacher, and it will be found sufficient
for any pupil less than ten years of age. Nor am I speaking of that culture which is merely
preparatory for the life of the artist, but of that practical training which will enable the
subject of it so to use his powers as to render his life valuable to himself, and valuable
to the world. There will be, in the exercises comprehended by this outline, sufficient mental
discipline. It will, of course, be chiefly incidental, and it may well be doubted whether studies
that are merely disciplinary should ever be introduced into our schools. There are useful occupations
for pupils that, at the same time, tax and test the mind sufficiently. The plan indicated does
not exclude grammar, geography and mental arithmetic, but text-books will not at first be needed.
Grammar should be taught by conversation, and in connection with the exercises in reading.
Grammar is the appreciation of the power of the words of the language in any given relations
to each other, and a knowledge of grammar is essential to the ability to speak, read and write
properly. Therefore, grammatical rules and definitions are, or should be, deduced from the
language. Hence children should be first trained to speak with accuracy, so that habit shall
be on the side of taste and science; next the offices which words perform in simple sentences
should be illustrated and made clear; And thus far without text-books; when, finally, with
their help, the pupils in the higher schools may acquire a knowledge of the science, and, at
once, as the result of previous training, discern the reason for each rule and definition.
The study of grammar requires some use of mental power; but when it is presented to pupils
by the aid of an object which, in itself and in what it does, illustrates the subject and the
predicate of a sentence, the work of comprehending the offices which words perform is rendered
comparatively easy. Having the skeleton thus furnished, and with the eyes and minds of the
pupils fixed upon an object that possesses known and appreciable powers and qualities, it is
not difficult for the teacher to construct a sentence that shall contain words of several parts
of speech, all understood, because the grammatical office of each was seen even before the
word itself was used. This work may be commenced when the child is young, and very satisfactory
results ought to be secured as soon as the pupil is in other respects qualified to enter a
grammar school. The pupil should be trained in reading as an art; that is, with the purpose
of expressing whatever is intellectual and emotional in the text. Satisfactory results cannot
at first be secured by much reading; it seems wiser for the teacher to select an extract, paragraph,
or single sentence only, and drill a pupil or a class until the meaning of the author is comprehended,
and accurately or even artistically expressed. This can be done only when the teacher reads
the passage again and again in the best manner possible. The contrary practice of reading volumes
of extracts from the writings of the most gifted men of ancient and modern times, without preparation
by the pupil, without example, explanation, correction, or questionings, by the teacher, cannot
be too strongly condemned. The time will come when these selections may be read with profit;
but it is better to read something well than to read a great deal; or there should be at least
thorough drill in connection with every exercise, until the pupils have attained some degree
of perfection. It may not be best to confine advanced pupils to the exercises in the text-books.
If such pupils are invited occasionally to make selections from their entire range of reading,
the teacher will have an opportunity to correct whatever is vicious in taste; and the pupil
making the selection will be compelled to read in such a manner that those who listen can understand,
which is not always the case when the language is addressed to the eye as well as to the ear.

The introduction of Colburn's Intellectual Arithmetic was an epoch in the science. It wrought
a radical change in the ability of the people to apply the power of numbers to the practical
business of life. Its excellence does not consist in rules and illustrations by which examples
and problems are easily solved, but in leading the mind of the pupil into natural and apparent
processes of reasoning, by which he is enabled to comprehend a proposition as an independent
fact. Herein is a mental discipline of great value, not only in the sciences, but in the daily
affairs of men of all classes and conditions. It is to be feared that equally satisfactory
results have not been attained in what is called written arithmetic. This partial failure deserves
consideration. The first cause may be found in an erroneous opinion concerning the difference
between mental and written arithmetic. Written arithmetic is mental arithmetic merely, with
a record at given stages of the process of what at that point is accomplished. But, as written
arithmetic tends to lessen the power of the pupil for the performance of those operations that
are purely mental, he should be subjected, each day, to a searching and rapid drill in mental
arithmetic also. This neglect on the part of teachers explains the singular fact that pupils,
well trained in mental arithmetic, after attending to written arithmetic for three or six months,
appear to have lost rather than gained in their knowledge of the science as a whole.

The second cause of failure may be found in the fact that rules, processes and simple methods
of solution, contained in the books, are substituted for the power of comprehension by the
pupil. He should be trained to seize an example mentally, whether the slate is to be used or
not, and hold it until he can determine by what process the solution is to be wrought. Nor
is it a serious objection that he may not at first avail himself of the easiest method. The
difference between methods or ways is altogether a subordinate consideration. There may be
many ways of reaching a truth, but no one of them is as important as the truth itself. The
text-books should contain all the facts needed for the comprehension and the solution of the
examples given; the teacher should furnish explanations and other aids, as they are needed;
but the practice of adopting a process and following it to an apparently satisfactory conclusion,
without comprehending the problem itself, is a serious educational evil, and it exerts a permanent
pernicious influence.

The remarks I have now made upon methods of teaching, which may seem to have been offered in
a spirit of severe criticism, should be qualified and relieved by the statement that our teachers
are as well educated as any in the country, and that they are yearly making progress in their
profession. Indeed, I am encouraged to suggest that better things are possible, by the consideration
that many instances of distinguished success in teaching the alphabet, reading and grammar,
are known to me; and that teachers are themselves aware that the work is, upon the whole, inadequately
performed. If, as is generally conceded, the highest order of teaching talent is required in
the primary schools, then that talent should be sought out by committees; the persons possessing
it should enjoy the best means of preparation; they should receive the highest rewards, both
in money and public consideration, and they should be induced to labor, without change or interruption,
in the same schools and the same people.

THE RELATIVE MERITS OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS AND ENDOWED ACADEMIES.

[Remarks before the American Institute of Instruction, at Manchester, N. H.]

Indebted to my friend on the other side, and to you, sir, and this audience, for inviting me
to take a position on this floor, I am still without any special preparation to discuss the
subject. I have thought upon it, because any one, however humbly connected with free schools
in this country, must have done so. And especially just now, when, in the educational journal
of Massachusetts, a discussion has been conducted between one of its editors and Mr. Gulliver,
the able originator of a school in Norwich, Ct., and the advocate of the system of school government
established there. And, therefore, every one who has had his eyes open must have seen that
here is a great contest, and that underlying it is a principle which is important to society.

The distinguishing difference between the advocates of endowed schools and of free schools
is this: those who advocate the system of endowed academies go back in their arguments to one
foundation, which is, that in education of the higher grades the great mass of the people are
not to be trusted. And those who advocate a system of free education in high schools put the
matter where we have put the rights of property and liberty, where we put the institutions
of law and religion--upon the public judgment. And we will stand there. If the public will
not maintain institutions of learning, then, I say, let institutions of learning go down. If
I belong to a state which cannot be moved from its extremities to its centre, and from its
centre to its extremities, for the maintenance of a system of public instruction, then, in
that respect, I disown that state; and if there be one state in this Union whose people cannot
be aroused to maintain a system of public instruction, then they are false to the great leading
idea of American principles, and of civil, political, and religious liberty.

It is easy to enumerate the advantages of a system of public education, and the evils--I say
evils--of endowed academies, whether free or charging payment for tuition. Endowed academies
are not, in all respects, under all circumstances, and everywhere, to be condemned. In discussing
this subject, it may be well for me to state the view that I have of the proper position of
endowed academies. They have a place in the educational wants of this age. This is especially
true of academies of the highest rank, which furnish an elevated and extended course of instruction.
To such I make no objection, but I would honor and encourage them. Yet I regard private schools,
which do the work usually done in public schools, as temporary, their necessity as ephemeral,
and I think that under a proper public sentiment they will soon pass away. They cannot stand,--such
has been the experience in Massachusetts,--they cannot stand by the side of a good system of
public education. Yet where the population is sparse, where there is not property sufficient
to enable the people to establish a high school, then an endowed school may properly come in
to make up the deficiency, to supply the means of education to which the public wealth, at
the present moment, is unequal. Endowed institutions very properly, also, give a professional
education to the people. At this moment we cannot look to the public to give that education
which is purely professional. But what we do look to the public for is this: to furnish the
means of education to the children of the whole people, without any reference to social, pecuniary,
political, or religious distinctions, so that every person may have a preliminary education
sufficient for the ordinary business of life.

It is said that the means of education are better in an endowed academy, or in an endowed free
school, than they can be in a public school. What is meant by means of education? I understand
that, first and chiefly, as extraneous means of education, we must look to a correct public
sentiment, which shall animate and influence the teacher, which shall give direction to the
school, which shall furnish the necessary public funds. An endowed free academy can have none
of these things permanently. Take, for example, the free school established at Norwich by the
liberality of thirty or forty gentlemen, who contributed ninety thousand dollars. What security
is there that fifty years hence, when the educational wants of the people shall be changed,
when the population of Norwich shall be double or treble what it is now, when science shall
make greater demands, when these forty contributors shall have passed away, this institution
will answer the wants of that generation? According to what we know of the history of this
country, it will be entirely inadequate; and, though none of us may live to see the prediction
fulfilled or falsified, I do not hesitate to say that the school will ultimately prove a failure,
because it is founded in a mistake.

Then look and see what would have been the state of things if there had been public spirit
invoked to establish a public high school, and if the means for its support had been raised
by taxation of all the people, so that the system of education would have expanded according
to the growth of the city, and year by year would have accommodated itself to the public wants
and public zeal in the cause. Though these means seem now to be ample, they will by and by
be found too limited. The school at Norwich is encumbered with regulations; and so every endowed
institution is likely to be, because the right of a man to appropriate his property to a particular
object carries with it, in the principles of common law, and in the administration of the law,
in all free governments, the right to declare, to a certain extent, how that property shall
be applied. Rules have been established--very proper and judicious rules for to-day. But who
knows that a hundred years hence they will be proper or acceptable at all? They have also established
a board of trustees, ultimately to be reduced to twenty-five. These trustees have power to
perpetuate themselves. Who does not see that you have severed this institution from the public
sentiment of the city of Norwich, and that ultimately that city will seek for itself what it
needs; and that, a hundred years hence, it will not consent to live, in the civilization of
that time, under the regulations which forty men have now established, however wise the regulations
may at the present moment be?

One hundred and fifty years ago, Thomas Hollis, of London, made a bequest to the university
at Cambridge, with a provision that on every Thursday a professor should sit in his chair to
answer questions in polemic theology. All well enough then; but the public sentiment of to-day
will not carry it out.

So it may be with the school at Norwich a hundred years hence. The man or state that sacrifices
the living public judgment to the opinion of a dead man, or a dead generation, makes a great
mistake. We should never substitute, beyond the power of revisal, the opinion of a past generation
for the opinion of a living generation. I trust to the living men of to-day as to what is necessary
to meet our existing wants, rather than to the wisest men who lived in Greece or Rome. And,
if I would not trust the wise men of Greece and Rome, I do not know why the people, a hundred
years hence, should trust the wise men of our own time.

And then look further, and see how, under a system of public instruction, you can build up,
from year to year, in the growth of the child, a system according to his wants. Private instruction
cannot do this. What do we do where we have a correct system? A child goes into a primary school.
He is not to go out when he attains a certain age. He might as well go out when he is of a
certain height; there would be as much merit in one case as in the other. But he is advanced
when he has made adequate attainments. Who does not see that the child is incited and encouraged
and stimulated by every sentiment to which you should appeal? And, then, when he has gone up
to the grammar school, we say to him, "You are to go into the high school when you have made
certain attainments." And who is to judge of these attainments? A committee appointed by the
people, over whom the people have some ultimate control. And in that control they have security
for two things: first, that the committee shall not be suspected of partiality; and secondly,
that they shall not be actually guilty of partiality. In the same manner, there is security
for the proper connection between the high school and the schools below. But in the school
at Norwich--of which I speak because it is now prominent--you have a board of twenty-five men,
irresponsible to the people. They select a committee of nine; that committee determines what
candidates shall be transferred from the grammar schools to the high school. May there not
be suspicion of partiality? If a boy or girl is rejected, you look for some social, political,
or religious influence which has caused the rejection, and the parent and child complain. Here
is a great evil; for the real and apparent justice of the examination and decision by which
pupils are transferred from one school to another is vital to the success of the system.

There is another advantage in the system of public high schools, which I imagine the people
do not always at first appreciate. It is, that the private school, with the same teachers,
the same apparatus, and the same means, cannot give the education which may be, and usually
is, furnished in the public schools. This statement may seem to require some considerable support.
We must look at facts as they are. Some people are poor; I am sorry for them. Some people are
rich, and I congratulate them upon their good fortune. But it is not so much of a benefit,
after all, as many think. It is worth something in this world, no doubt, to be rich; but what
is the result of that condition upon the family first, the school afterwards, and society finally?
It is, that some learn the lesson of life a little earlier than others; and that lesson is
the lesson of self-reliance, which is worth more than--I will not say a knowledge of the English
language--but worth more than Latin or Greek. If the great lesson of self-reliance is to be
learned, who is more likely to acquire it early,--the child of the poor, or the child of the
rich; the child who has most done for him, or the child who is under the necessity of doing
most for himself? Plainly, the latter. Now, while a system of public instruction in itself
cannot be magnified in its beneficial influences to the poor and to the children of the poor,
it is equally beneficial to the rich in the facility it affords for the instruction of their
children. Is it not worth something to the rich man, who cannot, from the circumstances of
the case, teach self-reliance around the family hearth, to send his child to school to learn
this lesson with other children, that he may be stimulated, that he may be provoked to exertions
which he would not otherwise have made? For, be it remembered that in our schools public sentiment
is as well marked as in a college, or a town, or a nation; that it moves forward in the same
way. And the great object of a teacher should be to create a public sentiment in favor of virtue.
There should be some pioneers in favor of forming a correct public sentiment; and when it is
formed it moves on irresistibly. It is like the river made up of drops from the mountain side,
moving on with more and more power, until everything in its waters is carried to the destined end.

So in a public school. And it is worth much to the man of wealth that there may be, near his
own door, an institution to which he may send his children, and under the influence of which
they may be carried forward. For, depend upon it, after all we say about schools and institutions
of learning, it is nevertheless true of education, as a statesman has said of the government,
that the people look to the school for too much. It is not, after all, a great deal that the
child gets there; but, if he only gets the ability to acquire more than he has, the schools
accomplish something. If you give a child a little knowledge of geography or arithmetic, and
have not developed the power to accomplish something for himself, he comes to but little in
the world. But put him into the school,--the primary, grammar, and high school, where he must
learn for himself,--and he will be fitted for the world of life into which he is to enter.

You will see in this statement that, with the same parties, the same means of education, the
same teachers, the public schools will accomplish more than private schools.

I find everywhere, and especially in the able address of Mr. Gulliver, to which I have referred,
that the public schools are treated as of questionable morality, and it is implied that something
would be gained by removing certain children from the influence of these schools. If I were
speaking from another point of view, very likely I should feel bound to hold up the evils and
defects which actually exist in public schools; but when I consider them in contrast with endowed
and private schools, I do not hesitate to say that the public schools compare favorably; and,
as the work of education goes on, the comparison will be more and more to their advantage.
Why? I know something of the private institutions in Massachusetts; and there are boys in them
who have left the public schools because they have fallen in their classes, and the public
interest would not justify their continuance in the schools. It was always true that private
schools did not represent the world exactly as it was. It is worth everything to a boy or girl,
man or woman, to look the world in the face as it is.

Therefore, the public school, when it represents the world as it is, represents the facts of
life. The private school never has done and never will do this; and as time goes on, it will
be less and less a true representative of the world. From this point of view, it seems to be
a mistake on the part of parents to exclude their children from the world. Is it not better
that the child should learn something of society, even of its evils, when under your influence,
and when you can control him by your counsel and example, than to permit him finally to go
out, as you must when his majority comes, perhaps to be seduced in a moment, as it were, from
his allegiance to virtue? Virtue is not exclusion from the presence of vice; but it is resistance
to vice in its presence. And it is the duty of parents to provide safeguards for the support
of their children against these temptations. When Cicero was called on to defend Muræna against
the slander that, as he had lived in Asia, he had been guilty of certain crimes, and when the
testimony failed to substantiate the charge, the orator said, "And if Asia does carry with
it a suspicion of luxury, surely it is a praiseworthy thing, not never to have seen Asia, but
to have lived temperately in Asia." And we have yet higher authority. It is not the glory of
Christ, or of Christianity, that its Divine Author was without temptation, but that, being
tempted, he was without sin. This is the great lesson of the day.

The duty of the public is to provide means for the education of all. To do that, we need the
political, social, and moral power of all, to sustain teachers and institutions of learning;
and, endowed or free schools, depending upon the contributions of individuals, can never, in
a free country, be raised to the character of a system. If you rob the public schools of the
influence of our public-spirited men, if they take away a portion of their pupils from them,
our system is impaired. It must stand as a whole, educating the entire people, and looking
to all for support, or it cannot be permanently maintained.

THE HIGH SCHOOL SYSTEM.

[An Address delivered at the Dedication of the Powers Institute, Bernardston.]

There cannot be a more gratifying spectacle than the universal homage offered to education
and to the young. Childhood is attractive in itself; and it is peculiarly an object of solicitude
for its promises concerning the future. Hence the labors of philanthropists, reformers, and
Christians, as well as of teachers, are devoted to the culture and improvement of the rising
generation, as the chief security possible for the prevalence of better ideas in the state
and in the world.

Massachusetts has been peculiarly favored in the means of education; and we ought ever to recognize
the divine influence in the wisdom which led our fathers to lay the foundations of a system
that contemplated the education of the whole people. The power of this great idea, universal
education, has not been limited to Massachusetts; the states of the West, the states of the
South, receive it as the basis of a wise public policy; and had our ancestors contributed nothing
else to the glory of the republic, they would yet be entitled to the distinguished consideration
of every age and people. The vigor of our culture and the hardihood of our institutions are
more manifest out of Massachusetts than in it. The immigrant in his new home in the great valley
of prairies, on the northern shores of the American lakes, in Oregon, California, or the islands
of the Pacific, invokes the spirit of New England in the establishment of a free church and
a free school. And in the spirit and discipline of New England, the thoughts of her sons are
turned homeward in adversity, seeking consolation at the sources of early, vigorous, and happy
life; or, in prosperity, that they may offer, in gratitude to man and to God, some tribute,
always noble, however humble, to the principles and institutions that first formed their characters,
and then controlled their destiny; or, in old age, the wanderer, like Jacob in Egypt, with
his blessing upon the tribes and families of men, says, "I am to be gathered unto my people;
bury me with my fathers." This occasion and its honors are due to the memory of him whose name
this institution bears; and his last will and testament is an illustration, or rather the cause,
of these prefatory remarks. As the reasonably extended and eminently prosperous life of your
wise benefactor approached its close, he, in the principles of Old England and of New England,
ordered and directed the payment of all his just debts; and then, secondly, expressed the wish,
"if practicable, to be buried by the side of his parents in the cemetery at Bernardston." First
justice, and then affection for parents, kindred, and home, animated the vital, never-dying
soul, as the life of the body ebbed and flowed, and flowed and ebbed, to flow no more. For
every good the ancients imagined and named a divinity; and there is in every good something divine.

We do not deify the living nor the dead; yet such foundations and institutions as the Lawrence
Scientific School, the Peabody Institute, the Powers Institute, will bear to a grateful posterity
a knowledge of the virtues of their respective founders, and of the exactness, rectitude, and
wisdom, of the public sentiment which religiously consecrates the means provided to the ends
proposed.

But just eulogy of the dead is the appropriate duty of those who were the associates and friends
of the founder of this school.--It will be my purpose, in the humble part I take in the services
of this honored occasion, to point out, as I may be able, the connection between learning and
wisdom, and then, by the aid of some general remarks upon education, to examine the fitness
of this foundation, and the rules here established, to promote human progress and virtue.

The actual available power of a state is in its adult population; but its hope is in the classes
of children and youth whose plastic minds yield to good influences, and are moulded to higher
forms of beauty than have been conceived by Italian or Grecian art. Excellence is always adorable
and to be adored. If it appear in beauty of person, it commands our admiration; and how much
more ought wisdom, which is the beauty of the mind and the excellency of the soul, to be cultivated
and cherished by every human being! "For what is there, O, ye gods!" says Cicero, "more desirable
than wisdom? What more excellent and lovely in itself? What more useful and becoming for a
man? Or what more worthy of his reasonable nature?"

But wisdom cannot be acquired in a day, nor without devotion and toil. It is the achievement
of a life. It is to be pursued carefully through schools, colleges, and the world,--to be mastered
by study, intense thought, rigid mental discipline, and an extensive acquaintance with the
best authors of ancient and modern times. It is not the child of ease, indolence, or luxury;
and it is well that it is not, The best of human possessions are cheapened their attainment
is no longer difficult. The wealth of California and Australia has made silver, as an article
of luxury, the rival of gold; and the pearl loses its beauty when the mountain streams are
as fertile as the depths of the sea. Wisdom comprehends learning, but learning is often found
where wisdom is wanting. Wisdom is not accomplishment in study, or perfection in art, or supremacy
in poetry or eloquence. Learning is essential to wisdom, for we cannot imagine a wise man who
is not also a learned man; and the extent and soundness of his learning may be a measure of
his wisdom. Wisdom must always have a basis of learning, but learning is not always a basis
of wisdom. Learning is a knowledge of particulars, of details; wisdom is such a combination
of these particulars as enables us to harmonize our lives with the laws of nature and of God.

Learning is manifested in what we know; wisdom in what we are, based upon what we know. Philosophy,
even, is love for wisdom rather than wisdom itself. The old philosophers defined wisdom to
be "the knowledge of things, both divine and human, together with the causes on which they
depend;" and in the proverb of Solomon, "The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom."
Purity, truth, and justice, are also of its foundation. Wise men of the Jewish and Pagan world
built on this foundation, and the Christian can build on none other. Having combined learning
with these essential virtues, a liberal, symmetrical, comprehensive character may be built
up. In the formation of such a character, industry, powers of observation, strength of will
and intellectual humility, are requisite. The virtue and the glory of industry cannot be presented
too often to the young. I know of no worldly good or human excellence that can be attained
without it; nor is there any inherited possession of name, or wealth, or position, that can
be preserved in its extent and quality without active, systematic, judicious labor.

It is not necessary to consider industry as habitual diligence in a pursuit, manual or intellectual;
but rather as a judicious arrangement of business and recreation, so as always to have time
for the necessary duties of life. Mere diligence is not industry in a good sense; it is labor
in a bad sense. Our time should be systematically appropriated to our employments, and each
measure of time should be equal to the work or duty appointed for it. Moreover, each work or
duty should be accomplished in its appointed time; and this can be secured only by a strong
will. The power of will admits of education, culture, improvement, as much as any faculty of
the mind or quality of character. A fickle, planless life cannot accomplish much. System in
our plans, and firmness of will in their execution, will place us beyond the reach of ordinary
disasters; yet how often do young men go through a course of school studies without a plan,
even for the moment, and enter upon life the slaves of chance, the victims of what they call
fortune, while they might by industry, system and firmness of will, rise superior to circumstances,
and extort a measure of success not unworthy of a noble ambition!

Idleness is a wasting disease, a consuming fire, a destroying demon; in youth it is a calamity,
in the vigor of manhood it is a disgrace and a sin, and in old age it can be honorably accepted
only as the symbol of reflective leisure earned by a life of industry and virtue. Industry
is a badge of honor, an introduction everywhere to the true nobility of the world, the security
that each may take of the future for his own happiness and prosperity in it.

Cardinal, personal virtues shrink and wither, or are blasted and die, in the company of idleness;
and, without firmness of will, the noblest principles and purest sentiments sometimes wear
the livery of vice, and often they give encouragement to it. Good principles, good purposes,
good ideas, are made fruitful by a strong resolution; while without it they are like bubbles
of water, brilliant in the sun-light, but destined to collapse by the changing, silent force
of the medium in which they float. And can any life, not positively vicious and criminal, be
less desirable than that of the young man who quietly accepts whatever condition circumstances
assign to him? I speak now of his moral and intellectual condition rather than of his social
position among men. The latter is not in itself important, and only becomes so through the
exhibition of high qualities of mind and character. Social and political consideration we cannot
demand as a right; but we may acquire knowledge, develop qualities of character, give evidences
of wisdom that entitle us to the respect of our fellows.

It may be agreeable, but it is not absolutely essential, for us to enjoy the public confidence,
or even the public consideration; though we can be happy ourselves only when we are conscious
of not being totally unworthy. But no social or political concession or consideration is acceptable
to a noble mind, that is grudgingly yielded or doubtingly bestowed; and the lustre of great
intellects is dimmed when they become subservient to claims that they despise.

But can we acquire a knowledge of things, either divine or human, unless we cultivate our powers
of observation? Partial or inaccurate observation, especially of natural things, is a great
defect of character; and in New England, where the aim of educators and of the public in matters
of education is elevated, a remedy for this defect ought at once to be sought and applied.
Our ideas are vague concerning many subjects of common sight and common observation. Is adult
life, even among the educated classes, equal to a description of the common animals, trees,
fruits and flowers? Who will paint with words the elm or the oak so that its species will be
known while the name is withheld? The introduction of drawing into the schools will improve
the power of observation among the people, especially if the pupils are required to make nature
their model. And this should always be done. O, how is education belittled and the mind dwarfed
by those teachers who keep their pupils' thoughts upon signs and definitions, when they ought
to deal continually with the facts, things and life of the world! It is no fable that a student
of the higher mathematics, when his master, a practical engineer upon the Boston water-works,
required his services, exclaimed, "I had no idea that you had sines and tangents out of doors."
With such,

     "Nothing goes for sense or light
     That will not with old rules jump right;
     As if rules were not in the schools
     Derived from truth, but truth from rules."

And Butler, in his satirical description of Sir Hudibras, ascribes to his hero more practical
philosophy than he appears to have intended, and more, certainly, than is found in some modern
systems of education:

     "In mathematics he was greater
     Than Tycho Brahe or Erra Pater;
     For he, by geometric scale,
     Could take the size of pots of ale;
     Resolve by sines and tangents straight,
     If bread or butter wanted weight;
     And wisely tell what hour o' th' day
     The clock does strike, by algebra."

Another prerequisite of wisdom is intellectual humility, Solomon, says, "Before honor is humility;"
and humility is before wisdom, and even before learning. We ought not to be ashamed of involuntary
ignorance. Franklin, when asked how he came to know so much, replied, "By never being ashamed
to ask a question."

It is idle for any one to imagine that there is nothing more for him to learn. Indeed, such
a theory is good evidence of defective education and limited attainments, if not of a defective
mental and moral structure.

Naturalists delight and instruct their pupils and auditors with the wonderful truths folded
in the flower, garnered in the plant, or imprisoned in the rock. Yet how much more there must
be of God's wisdom in the humblest of the beings created in his image! There are distinctions
among men; and out of these distinctions come the truth and the necessity that each may be
both a teacher and a pupil of every other. No man, however learned he may be, does know or
can know all that is known by his neighbor, though that neighbor be the humblest of shepherds
or of fishermen. We are not independent of each other in anything. The earnest and faithful
disciple of wisdom goes through life everywhere diffusing knowledge, and everywhere gathering
it up. Over the great gateway of life is the inscription, "None but learners enter here;" and
along its paths and in its groves are tablets, on which is written, "None but learners sojourn
here." He is a poor teacher who is not a learner, and he is but little of a learner who is
not something of a teacher also. The best teachers are they who are pupils, and the best pupils
are already teachers. Such was the real and avowed character of the great teachers of antiquity;
such is the best practice of modern continental Europe, and such is the requirement of nature
in all ages. He who does not learn cannot teach. Socrates professed to know only this, that
he knew nothing. Plato was a disciple of Socrates and Euclid; a pupil in the school of Pythagoras;
and, as a traveller, under the disguise of a merchant and a seller of oil, he visited Egypt,
and thus gained a knowledge of astronomy, and added something to his learning in other departments.

Thus we trace Demosthenes and Alexander, the master spirits in the struggle of Grecian independence
against Macedonian supremacy, through teachers and culture up to Socrates, the wanderer in
the streets, and the disturber of the peace of Athens.

It is stated that a distinguished modern philosopher often says, "I don't know," when the curiosity
or science of his pupils suggests questions that he has not considered. If we respect and admire
the wisdom of the wise, how ought we to be humbled, intellectually, by the reflection that
the unknown far exceeds the known, and that all become as little children when they enter the
temple of the sages! The ancients prized schools, teachers, and learning, because they were
essential to wisdom; and wisdom enabled them to live temperately, justly, and happily, in the
present world; while we prize schools, teachers, and learning, because they contribute to what
we call success in life. The population of New England, is composed of skilful artisans, intelligent
merchants, shrewd or eloquent lawyers, industrious and intelligent farmers; and to these results
our system of education is too exclusively subservient. These results are not to be condemned,
nor are the processes by which they are secured to be neglected. But our schools ought to do
something always and for every one, for the full development of a character that is essential
to artisans, merchants, lawyers, or farmers. Learning should not be prized merely as an aid
to the daily work of life,--though this it properly is and ever ought to be,--but for its expansive
power in the mind and soul, by which we attain to a more perfect knowledge of things human
and divine. There are many persons who accomplish satisfactorily the tasks assigned them, but
who do not always comprehend the processes of life, in its political, social, literary, scientific
and industrial relations, by which the affairs of the world are guided.

Something of this is due, speaking of America, and especially of New England, to the universal
desire to be engaged in active business. Young men destined for the farm or the shop, the counting-house
or the store, leave home and school so early that their apprenticeship is ended long before
their majority commences; and they are thus prepared to enter early and vigorously upon the
business of life. This course has its advantages, and it is also attended by many evils. Our
youth have but little opportunity for observation, and a great deal of time for experience.
They fall into mistakes that should have been observed, and consequently shunned. Moreover,
this custom tends to make business men too exclusively and rigidly technical and professional;
that is, in plain language, speaking relatively, they know too much of their own vocation,
and too little of everything else. Business life follows so closely upon home life and school
life, that the lessons of the latter fail to exert an immediate and controlling influence,
and it is often only in maturer years that the fruits of early training are seen. The connection
is such that the boy or youth becomes a devotee of business before he is developed into complete
manhood. This is movement, but not true progress; activity, but not culture; appropriation
and accumulation, but not natural development. This peculiarity is less prominent in England,
and it is hardly known in the central states of Europe. It is to some extent a national, and
especially is it a New England characteristic. It is a manifestation of the forward moving
spirit of our people, and it is also at once a promise and the security for the ultimate supremacy
of the American race and nation in the affairs of the world. In Athens young men attained their
majority when they were sixteen; but they usually prosecuted their studies afterwards, and
Aristotle thought them unfit for marriage until they were thirty-seven years of age. This rule
was observed by Aristotle in his own case; but we are unable to say whether the rule was made
before or after his marriage, which is a fact of much importance when we consider the wisdom
of the precept, and the real principles and philosophy of its famous author. Moreover, regardless
of one-half of creation, he has neither stated the age at which females are marriageable, nor
given us that of his own wife. This neglect justly detracts from his authority; and it will
not be strange if young men and women view with distrust an opinion that is so manifestly partial
and one-sided. If schools make merely learned people, in a narrow and technical sense, they
are not doing their whole work. Such learning makes an efficient population, which is certainly
desirable; but it ought also to be a well-educated population in a broad, comprehensive, philosophic
sense. By the force of nature and the developing influences of society, including the church,
the school, and the home, we ought first to be educated men and women, and then apply that
education to the particular work we have in hand. By learning, in this connection, I do not
mean the learning of Agassiz as a naturalist, the learning of Choate as a lawyer, or the learning
of Everett as an orator; but a more general and less minute culture, by which men are prepared
to form an accurate judgment upon subjects that usually attract public attention.

In the gardens of the wealthy, we often see peach-trees and pear-trees trained against brick
or stone walls, to which they are attached by substantial thongs. These trees are carefully
and systematically trained, and they are trained so as to accomplish certain results. They
present a large surface, in proportion to the whole, to the sun and air; in addition to the
direct rays of the sun, they receive the reflected and accumulated heat of the walls to which
they are fastened; and they furnish ripe fruit much in advance of trees in the gardens and
fields of the common farmers. Here art and nature, in brick walls, manure, the germinating
power of the peach or pear, and rigid training and pruning, have produced very good machines
for the manufacture of fruit; but for the full-grown, symmetrically developed tree, or even
for the choicest fruit in its season, we must look elsewhere. And who does not perceive, if
all the trees of the gardens, fields, and forests, were treated in the same way, that the world
would be deprived of a part of its beauty and glory, and that many species of trees would soon
become extinct? Who would not give back the luscious pear and peach to their native acritude,
rather than subject the highest forms of vegetable life to such irreverence? And, upon reflection,
we shall say that such cruelty to inanimate life can be justified only as we justify the naturalist
who dexterously and suddenly extracts a vital organ from a reptile, that he may observe the
effect upon that form of animal existence.

But the tree is not to be left in its native state. By culture its growth is so aided, that
it is first and always a tree after its own kind, whether it be peach, pear, apple, elm, or
oak; at once ornamental and graceful, stately or majestic, according to the germinating principle
which diffuses itself through each individual creation. So in the human heart, mind, and soul,
nature bringeth forth fruit of herself; and it is the work of schools and teachers to aid nature
in developing a full and attractive character, that shall yield fruit while all its powers
are enlarged and strengthened, as the almond in the peach is not only more luscious in its
fruit, but more graceful in its branches. Culture, in a broad sense, is the aid rendered to
each individual creation in its work of self-improvement. It is not a noble and generous culture
which dwarfs the tree that early ripened or peculiarly flavored fruit may be obtained; and
it is not a noble and generous culture of the child which forces into unnatural activity certain
faculties or powers that surprise us by their precocity, or excite wonder by the skill exhibited
in their use. Rather let the child grow, expand, mature, according to the law of its own being,
giving it only encouragement and example, which are the light and air of mental and moral life.
I am not conscious that any one has given us a philosophical, logical system of development,
that relates to the physical, intellectual, and moral character; and to-day I state the educational
want in this particular, but I do not attempt to supply it. Yet in nature such a system there
must be, and only powers of observation are needed that we may avail ourselves of it. And in
stating this want more particularly, I offer, as my first suggestion, the opinion, common among
educators, that, speaking generally and with reference to a system, we have no physical training
whatever.

In the days of our ancestors, one hundred or two hundred years ago, this training, as a part
of a system of education, was not needed. We had no cities, and but few large towns. Agriculture
and the ruder forms of mechanical labor were the chief occupations of the people. Populous
cities, narrow streets, dark lanes, cellar habitations, crowded workshops, over-filled and
over-heated factories, and the number of sedentary pursuits that tax and wear and destroy the
physical powers, and undermine the moral and mental, were unknown. These are the attendants
of our civilization, and they have brought a melancholy train of evils with them. In the seventeenth
century, men perished from exposure, from ignorance of the laws of health, from the prevalence
of malignant diseases that defied the science of the times; and, as a consequence, the average
length of human life was not greater than it now is. At present, there is but little exposure
that is followed by fatal results; malignant diseases are deprived of many of their terrors;
rules of living, founded upon scientific principles, are accessible to all; and yet we daily
meet young men and women who are manifestly unequal to the lot that is before them. In some
cases, the sin of the parent is visited upon the children, and the measure of life meted out
to them is limited and insufficient. In other cases, the individuals, first yielding in their
own persons, are the victims of positive vice, or of some of the evils stated. Civilization
is not an unmixed good; and we cannot offer to the city or the factory any adequate compensation
for the loss of pure water, pure air, and the healthful exercise of body, which may be enjoyed
in the country villages and agricultural districts of the state.

Yet even in cities and large towns the culture of home and school should diminish these evils;
and it is a pleasure to believe that our system of domestic and public education is doing something
at the present moment in behalf of the too much neglected body; but nowhere, either in city
or country, do we observe the evidences of juvenile health and strength that a friend of the
race would desire to see. And it is, I fear, specially true of schools, and to some extent
it is true of teachers, as a class, that too little attention is given to those exercises and
habits which secure good health. There are many causes which tend to lower the average health
and strength of our people. 1st. The practice of sending children to school at the tender age
of five, four, or even three years. Every school necessarily imposes some restraint upon the
pupils; and I assume that no child under five years of age should be subject to such restraints.
But the education of the child is not, therefore, to be neglected. Parents, brothers and sisters,
may all do something for the young inquirer; but he should never have lessons imposed, nor
be subject to the rules of a school of any description. The moment of his admission must be
determined by circumstances, and the force of the circumstances must be judged of by parents.
If a child is blessed with kind, considerate, intelligent parents, the first eight years of
his life can be spent nowhere else as profitably as at home. The true mother is the model teacher.
No other person can ever acquire the control over her off-spring that is her own rightful possession.
When she neglects the trust confided to her, she is guilty of a serious wrong; and when she
transfers it to another, she takes upon herself a greater responsibility than she yields up.
The instinctive judgment of the world cannot be an erroneous judgment. The mother has always,
to a great extent, been made responsible for the child; and the honor of his virtues or the
disgrace of his crimes has been traced through him to her.

2dly. Some portion of every school-day should be systematically and strictly devoted to recreation,
physical exercise and manual labor; and the hours given to study ought to be defined and limited.
Some persons say, "Let a child study as much as he will, there is time enough to play." This
may be generally true, but it is not universally so. I cannot but think that the practice of
assigning lessons and giving the pupil the free use of the four-and-twenty hours is a bad practice.
Would it not be better to give to each pupil certain hours for study?--assign him lessons,
by topics if possible, allow him to do what he can in the allotted time, and then prohibit
the appropriation of an additional minute? Why should a dull scholar, or one who has but little
taste or talent for a given study, be required to plod twelve, sixteen, or eighteen hours at
unwelcome tasks, while another more favored disposes of his work in six? Why should a pupil,
who is laboring under some mental or physical debility, be required to apply his mind unceasingly
when he most needs rest and recreation? Why should the pages of a spelling-book, grammar, geography,
or arithmetic, be the measure of each pupil's capacity? Lessons are to be assigned, not necessarily
to be mastered by the pupil, though they should have just reference to his capacity, but as
the subject of his studies for a given period of time. The pupil should be responsible for
nothing but the proper use of that time. Two advantages might result from this practice. First,
the pupil would acquire the habit of performing the greatest amount of labor possible in the
given time; and, secondly, he would naturally throw off all care for books and school when
the hour for relaxation arrived. If particular studies are assigned to specified hours, the
pupil must master his thoughts, and give them the required direction. This in itself is a great
achievement. I put it, in practical value, before any of the studies that are taught and learned
in the schools. The danger to which pupils are often exposed, in this connection, is quite
apparent. A lesson is assigned for a succeeding day. The attention is not immediately fixed
upon it. One hour passes, and then another. Nothing is accomplished, yet the pupil is continually
oppressed by the consciousness of duty unperformed, and the result is, that he neither does
what he ought to do, nor does anything else. Would it not be better to measure and assign his
time, and then require him to abandon all thought of the matter? This practice might give our
people the faculty and the habit of throwing off cares and occupations, when they leave the
scenes of them. It is a just criticism upon American character, that our business men carry
their occupations with them wherever they go. I should put high up among the elements of worldly
success the ability to give assiduously, studiously and devotedly, the necessary time to a
subject of business, and then to throw off all thought of it. There can be no peace of mind
for the business man who does not possess this quality; and I think it will contribute essentially
to a long life and a quiet old age. No wise man ever attempts more than one thing at a time;
and the man who attempts to do more than one thing at a time has no security that he can do
anything well. The statements of biography and history, that Napoleon was accustomed to do
several things at once, rest upon a misconception of the operations of the human mind. His
facility for the direction and transaction of business depended upon the quality I am now considering.
He had the faculty of giving his attention, undivided and strongly fixed, to a subject for
an hour, half-hour, minute, half-minute, or second, and then of dismissing the matter altogether,
and directing his thoughts, without loss of time, to whatever next might be presented. One
thing at a time is a law which no finite power can violate; and ability in execution depends
upon the ability to concentrate all the powers of the mind, at a given moment, upon the assigned
topic, and then to change, without friction or loss of time, to something else.

The institution is a high school, and the question is now agitated, especially in the State
of Connecticut, "How can the advantages of a high school education be best secured?" This question
I propose to consider. And, first, the high school must be a public school. A public school
I understand to be a school established by the public,--supported chiefly or entirely by the
public, controlled by the public, and accessible to the public upon terms of equality without
special charge for tuition.

Private schools may be established and controlled by an individual, or by an association of
individuals, who have no corporate rights under the government, but receive pupils upon terms
agreed upon, subject to the ordinary laws of the land.

Private schools may be founded also by one or more persons, and by them endowed with funds,
for their partial or entire support. In such cases, the founder, through the money given, has
the right to prescribe the rules by which the school shall be controlled, and also to provide
for the appointment of its managers or trustees through all time. In such cases, corporate
powers are usually granted by the government for the management of the business. But the chief
rights of such an institution are derived from the founder, and the facilities for their easy
exercise and quiet enjoyment are derived from the state.

Such schools are sometimes, upon a superficial view, supposed to be public, because they receive
pupils upon terms of equality, and no rule of exclusion exists which does not apply to all.
And especially has it been assumed that a free school thus founded, as the Norwich Free Academy,
which makes no charges for tuition, and is open to all the inhabitants of the city, is therefore
a public school. These institutions are public in their use, but not in their foundation or
control, and are therefore not public schools. The character of a school, as of any eleemosynary
institution, is derived from the will of the founder; and when the beneficial founder is an
individual, or a number of individuals less than the whole political organization of which
the individuals are a part, the institution is private, whatever the rules for its enjoyment
may be. To say that a school is a public school because it receives pupils free of charge for
tuition, or because it receives them upon conditions that are applied alike to all, is to deny
that there are any private schools, for all come within the definition thus laid down.

Nor is there any good reasoning in the statement that a school is public because it receives
pupils from a large extent of country. Dartmouth College is a private school, though its pupils
come from all the land or all the world; while the Boston Latin School is a public school;
though it receives those pupils only whose homes are within the limits of the city. The first
is a private school, because it was founded by President Wheelock, and has been controlled
by him and his successors, holding and governing and enjoying through him, from the first until
now; while the Boston Latin School is a public school, because it was established by the city
of Boston, through the votes of its inhabitants, under the laws of the state, and is at all
times subject, in its government and existence, to the popular will which created it. When
we speak of the public we do not necessarily mean the world, nor the nation, nor even the state;
but the word public, in a legal sense, may stand for any legal political organization, territorially
defined, and intrusted in any degree with the administration of its own affairs. And the public
character of a particular school, as the Boston Latin School, for example, may be determined,
by a process of reasoning quite independent of that already presented. The State of Massachusetts,
a complete sovereignty in itself, has provided by her constitution and laws, which are the
expressed judgment of her people, for the establishment of a system of public schools, through
the agency and action of the respective cities and towns of the commonwealth. These towns and
cities, under the laws, set up the schools; and of course each school partakes of the public
character which the action of the state, followed by the corporate public action of the city
or town, has given to it. Thus it is seen that our public schools answer to the requirement
already stated. Nor is the public character of a school changed by the fact that private citizens
may have contributed to its maintenance, if such contributors do not assume to stand in the
relation of founders. It is well understood that the beneficial founder of a school is he who
makes the first gift or bequest to it, and the legal founder is the government which grants
a charter, or in any way confers upon it a corporate existence. If a town establish a high
school, as in Bernardston to-day, and accept a gift or bequest, the character of the school
is not changed thereby. Mr. Powers did not attempt to establish a new school. He gave the income
of ten thousand dollars for the aid of schools then existing, and for the aid of a school whose
existence was already contemplated by the laws of the state. No change has been wrought in
your institutions; they are still public,--your generous testator has only contributed to their
support. And, in considering yet further the question, "How can the advantages of a high-school
education be best secured?" I shall proceed to compare, with what brevity I can command, the
public high school with the free high school or academy upon a private foundation. My reasoning
is general, and the argument does not apply to all the circumstances of society. It is not
everywhere possible to establish a public high school. In some cases the population may not
be sufficient, in others there may not be adequate wealth, and in others there may not be an
elevated public sentiment equal to the emergency. In such circumstances, those who desire education
must obtain it in the best manner possible; and academies, whether free or not, and private
schools, whether endowed or not, should be thankfully accepted and encouraged. Nor will high
schools meet all the wants of society. There must always be a place for classical schools,
scientific schools, professional schools, which, in their respective courses of study, either
anticipate or follow, in the career of the student, his four years of college life. With these
conditions and limitations stated, the point I seek to establish is that a public high school
can do the work usually done in such institutions more faithfully, thoroughly, and economically,
than it can be done anywhere else.

1st. The supervision of the public school is more responsible, and consequently more perfect.
In private schools, academies and free high schools which are endowed, there is a board of
trustees, who perpetuate, as a corporation, their own existence. Each member is elected for
life, and he is not only not responsible to the public, but he is not even responsible, except
in extraordinary cases, to his associates. Responsibility is, in all governments, the security
taken for fidelity. The election of representatives, in the state or national legislature,
for life, would be esteemed a great and dangerous innovation.

It maybe said that boards of trustees are usually better qualified to manage a school than
the committees elected by the respective cities and towns. Judged as individuals, this is probably
true; though upon this point I prefer to admit a claim rather than to express an opinion. But
positively incompetent school committees are the exception in Massachusetts; usually the people
make the selection from their best men. But in the public school you get the immediate, direct
supervision of the public. Not merely in the election of committees, but in a daily interest
and vigilance whose results are freely disclosed to the superintending committee, as every
inhabitant feels that his contribution, as a tax-payer, gives him the right to judge the character
of the school, and makes it his duty to report its defects to those charged with its management.
The real defects of a school, especially of a high school, will be first discovered by pupils;
and they are likely to report these defects to their parents. In the case of the endowed private
school, the parent feels that he buys whatever the trustees have to sell, or takes as a gift
whatever they have to offer free; and he does not, logically nor as a matter of fact, infer
from either of these relations his right to participate in the government of the school. In
one case you have the observation, the judgment, the supervision, of the whole community; in
the other case you have the learning and judgment of five, seven, ten, or twelve men.

2dly. The faithfulness of the teacher is very much dependent upon the supervision to which
he is subject. This is only saying that the teacher is human. In the public school there is
no motive which can influence a reasonable man that would lead him to swerve in the least from
his fidelity to the interest of the school as a whole. No partiality to a particular individual,
no desire to promulgate a special idea, can ever stand in the place of that public support
which is best secured by a just performance of his duties. In the private school, with a self-perpetuating
board of trustees, the temptation is strong to make the organization subservient to some opinion
in politics, religion, or social life. This may not always be done; but in many cases it has
been done, and there is no reason to expect different things in the future. I concur, then,
unreservedly in the judgment which has placed this institution, in all its interests and in
all its duties, under the control of the inhabitants of Bernardston. When they who live in
its light and enjoy its benefits cease to respect it, when they to whom it is specially dedicated
cease to love and cherish it, it will no longer be entitled to the favorable consideration
of a more extended public sentiment. As all trustworthy national patriotism must be built on
love for state, town, and home, so every school ought to esteem its power for usefulness in
its own neighborhood its chief means of good.

It will naturally be inferred, from the remarks made upon the singleness of purpose and fidelity
of the public school to the cause of education, that the instruction given in it is more thorough
than is usually given in the private school. But, in examining yet further the claim of the
public school to superior thoroughness, I must assume that it enjoys the advantages of comfortable
rooms, adequate apparatus and competent teachers. And this assumption ought to be supported
by the facts. There is no good reason why any town in Massachusetts should be negligent or
parsimonious in these particulars. True economy requires liberal appropriations. With these
appropriations, the best teachers, even from private schools and academies, can be secured,
and all the aids and encouragements to liberal culture can be provided. Is it possible that
any of the means of a common-school education are necessarily denied to a million and a quarter
of industrious people, who already possess an aggregate capital of seven or eight hundred millions
of dollars? But the character of a high school must always depend materially upon the previous
training of the pupils, and the qualifications required for admission. When the high school
is a public school, the studies of the primary and grammar or district schools are arranged
with regard to the system as a system. There is no inducement to admit a pupil for the sake
of the tuition fees, or for the purpose of adding to the number of scholars. The applicant
is judged by his merits as a scholar; and where there is a wise public sentiment, the committee
will be sustained in the execution of just rules.

In the public high school we avoid a difficulty that is almost universal in academies and private
schools--the presence of pupils whose attainments are so various that by a proper classification
they would be assigned to two, if not to three grades, where the graded system exists. The
vigilance, industry and fidelity of teachers, cannot overcome this evil. The instruction given
is inevitably less systematic and thorough. The character which the high school, whether public
or private, presents, is not its own character merely; it reflects the qualities and peculiarities
of the schools below. It follows, then, that the attention of the public should be as much
directed to the primary and grammar or district schools as to the high school itself. Of course,
it ought not to be assumed that the existence of a high school will warrant any abatement of
appropriations for the lower grades; indeed, the interest and resources of these schools ought
continually to increase.

Nor can it be assumed that your contributions to the cause of education will be diminished
by the bequest of your generous testator. He did not seek to lessen your burdens, but to add
to the means of education among you.

There is also an inherent power of discipline in the public schools, where they are graded
and a system of examinations exists, that is not found elsewhere. Neither the pupil nor the
parent is viewed by the teacher in the light of a patron; hence, he seeks only to so conduct
his school as to meet the public requirement. Moreover, as admission to a high school can be
secured by merit only, the results of the preliminary training must have been such as to create
a reasonable presumption in favor of the applicant, mentally and morally. Hence, the public
schools are filled by youth who are there as the reward of individual, personal merit. Practically,
the motive by which the pupils are animated has much to do with their success. If they are
moved by a love for learning, they attain the object of their desires even without the aid
of teachers; but where they are aided and encouraged by faithful teachers, the school is soon
under the control of a public sentiment which secures the end in view.

This public sentiment is not as easily built up in a private school; for, in the nature of
things, some pupils will find their way there who are not true disciples of learning; and such
persons are obstacles to general progress, while they advance but little themselves.

And, gentlemen trustees and citizens of Bernardston, may I not personally and especially invite
you to consider the importance of a fixed standard of admission and a careful examination of
candidates? This course is essential to the improvement of your district and village schools.
It is essential to the true prosperity of this seminary, and it is also essential to the intellectual
advancement of the people within your influence. You expect pupils from the neighboring towns.
Your object is not pecuniary profit, but the education of the people. If your requirements
are positive, though it may not be difficult to meet them in the beginning, every town that
depends upon this institution for better learning than it can furnish at home will be compelled
to maintain schools of a high order. On the other hand, negligence in this particular will
not only degrade the school under your care here, but the schools in this town and the cause
of education in the vicinity will be unfavorably affected. Nor let the objection that a rigid
standard of qualifications will exclude many pupils, and diminish the attendance upon the school,
have great weight; for you perform but half your duty when you provide the means of a good
education for your own students. You are also, through the power inherent in this authority,
to do something to elevate the standard of learning in other schools, and in the country around.
What harm if this school be small, while by its influence other schools are made better, and
thus every boy and girl in the vicinity has richer means of education than could otherwise
have been secured? Thus will tens, and hundreds, and thousands, of successive generations,
have cause to bless this school, though they may never have sat under its teachers, or been
within its walls.

In a system of public schools, everything may be had at its prime cost. There need be no waste
of money, or of the time or power of teachers. As the public system must everywhere exist,
it is a matter of economy to bring all the children under its influence. The private system
never can educate all; therefore the public system cannot be abandoned, unless we consent to
give up a part of the population to ignorance. It may, then, be said that the private schools,
essential in many cases, ought to give way whenever the public schools are prepared to do the
work; and when the public schools are so prepared, the existence of private schools adds their
own cost to the necessary cost of popular education.

But we are not to encourage parsimony in education; for parsimony in this department is not
true economy. It is true economy for the state and for a town to set up and maintain good schools
as cheaply as they can be had, yet at any necessary cost, so only that they be good. Massachusetts
is prosperous and wealthy to-day, respected in evil report as well as in good, because, faithful
to principle and persistent in courage, she has for more than two hundred years provided for
the education of her children; and now the re-flowing tide of her wealth from seaboard and
cities will bear on its wave to these quiet valleys and pleasant hill-sides the lovers of agriculture,
friends of art, students of science, and such as worship rural scenes and indulge in rural
sports; but the favored and first-sought spots will be those where learning has already chosen
her seat, and offers to manhood and age the culture and society which learning only can give,
and to childhood and youth, over and above the training of the best schools, healthful moral
influences, and elements of physical growth and vigor, which ever distinguish life in the country
and among the mountains from life in the city or on the plain. And over a broader field and
upon a larger sphere shall the benignant influence of this system of public instruction be
felt. In the affairs of this great republic, the power of a state is not to be measured by
the number of its votes in Congress. Public opinion is mightier than Congress; and they who
wield or control that do, in reality, bear rule. Power in the world, upon a large view, and
in the light of history, has not been confided to the majorities of men. Greece, unimportant
in extent of territory, a peninsula and archipelago in the sea, led the way in the civilization
of the west, and, through her eloquence, poetry, history and art, became the model of modern
culture. Rome, a single city in Italy, that stretches itself into the sea as though it would
gaze upon three continents, subjugated to her sway the savage and civilized world, and impressed
her arms and jurisprudence upon all succeeding times; then Venice, without a single foot of
solid land, guarded inviolate the treasure of her sovereignty for thirteen hundred years against
the armies of the East and the West; while, in our own time, England, unimportant in the extent
of her insular territory, has been able, by the intelligence and enterprise of her people,
to make herself mistress of the seas, arbiter of the fortunes of Europe, and the ruler of a
hundred millions of people in Asia.

These things have happened in obedience to a law which knows no change. Power in America is
with those who can bring the greatest intellectual and moral force to bear upon a given point.
And Massachusetts, limited in the extent of her territory, without salubrity of climate, fertility
of soil, or wealth of mines, will have influence, through her people at home and her people
abroad, proportionate to her fidelity to the cause of universal public education.

NORMAL SCHOOL TRAINING.

[An Address delivered at the Dedication of the State Normal School, at Salem.]

The human race may be divided into two classes. One has no ideal of a future different from
the present; or, if it is not always satisfied with this view, it has yet had no clear conception
of a higher existence.

The other class is conscious of the power of progress, is making continual advances, and has
an ideal of a future such as, in its judgment, the present ought to be. Both of these classes
have institutions; for institutions are not the product of civilization, as they exist wherever
our social nature is developed. Man is also a dependent being, and he therefore seeks the company,
counsel and support of his fellows. From the right of numbers to act comes the necessity of
agreement, or at least so much concurrence in what is to be done as to secure the object sought.
The will of numbers can only be expressed through agencies; and these, however simple, are
indeed institutions--the evidence of civilization, rather than its product. They are always
the sign, symbol, or language, by which the living man expresses the purpose of his life. Therefore,
institutions differ, as the purposes of men vary.

The savage and the man of culture do not seek the same end; hence they will not employ the
same means.

The institutions of the savage are those of the family, clan, or tribe, to which he belongs.
There the child is instructed in the art of dress, in manners and language, in the rude customs
of agriculture, the chase, and war. This with him is life, and the history of one generation
is often the history of many generations. Their ideal corresponds with their actual life; and,
as a necessary result, there is little or no progress.

But the other class establishes institutions which indicate the existence of new relations,
and exact the performance of new duties. As man is a social being, he necessarily creates institutions
of government and education corresponding to the sphere in which he is to act. If a nation
desires to educate only a part of its people, its institutions are naturally exclusive; but
wherever the idea of universal education has been received, the institutions of the country
look to that end.

When Massachusetts was settled there were no truly popular institutions in the world, for there
was really no belief in popular rights. And why should those be encouraged to think who have
no right to act? The principle that every man is to take a part in the affairs of the community
or state to which he belongs seems to be the foundation of the doctrine that every man should
be educated to think for himself. Free schools and general education are the natural results
of the principles of human equality, which distinguish the people and political systems of America.

The purposes of a people are changeable and changing, but institutions are inflexible; therefore
these latter often outlast the ideas in which they originated, or the ideas may be acting in
other bodies or forms. Institutions are the visible forms of ideas, but they are useful only
while those ideas are living in the minds of men. If an institution is suffered to remain after
the idea has passed away, it embarrasses rather than aids an advancing people. Such are monastic
establishments in Protestant countries; such is the Church of England, as an institution of
religion and government, to all classes of dissenters; such are many seminaries of learning
in Europe, and some in America.

Massachusetts has had one living idea, from the first,--that general intelligence is necessary
to popular virtue and liberty. This idea she has expressed in various ways; the end it promises
she has sought by various means. In obedience to this idea, she has established colleges, common
schools, grammar schools, academies, and at last the Normal School.

The institution only of the Normal School is new; the idea is old. The Normal system is but
a better expression of an idea partially concealed, but nevertheless to be found in the college,
grammar school and academy of our fathers. Nor have we accepted the institution so readily
from a knowledge of its results in other countries, as from its manifest fitness to meet a
want here. It is not, then, our fortune to inaugurate a new idea, but only to clothe an old
one again, so that it may more efficiently advance popular liberty, intelligence and virtue.
And this is our duty to-day.

The proprieties of this occasion would have been better observed, had his excellency, Governor
Washburn, found it convenient to deliver the address, which, at a late moment, has been assigned
to me. But we are all in some degree aware of the nature and extent of his public duties, and
can, therefore, appreciate the necessity which demands relief from some of them.

Massachusetts has founded four Normal Schools, and at the close of the present century she
may not have established as many more, for she now satisfies the just demands of every section
of her territory, and presents the benefits of this system of instruction to all her inhabitants.
The building we here set apart, and the school we now inaugurate to the service of learning,
are to be regarded as the completion of the original plan of the state, and any future extension
will depend upon the success of the Normal system as it shall appear in other years to other
generations of men. But we have great faith that the Normal system, in itself and in its connections,
will realize the cherished idea of our whole history; and if so, it will be extended until
every school is supplied with a Normal teacher.

This, then, is an occasion of general interest; but to the city of Salem, and the county of
Essex, it is specially important. Similar institutions have been long established in other
parts of the state; but some compensation is now to be made to you, in the experience and improvements
of the last fifteen years. Intelligent labor sheds light upon the path of the laborer, and,
though the direct benefits of this system have not been here enjoyed, many resulting advantages
from the experience of similar institutions in other places will now inure to you.

The city of Salem, with wise forecast, anticipated these advantages, and generously contributed
a sum larger even than that appropriated by the state itself. This bounty determined the location
of the school, but determined it fortunately for all concerned.

Salem is one of the central points of the state; and in this respect no other town in the vicinity,
however well situated, is a competitor. Pupils may reside at their homes in Newburyport, Lynn,
Lawrence, Haverhill, Gloucester and Lowell, or at any intermediate place, and enjoy the benefit
of daily instruction within these walls. This is a great privilege for parents and pupils;
and it could not have been so well secured at any other point. Here, also, pupils and teachers
may avail themselves of the libraries, literary institutions and cabinets of this ancient and
prosperous town. These are no common advantages.

We are wiser and better for the presence of great numbers of books, though we may never know
what they contain. We see how much perseverance and labor have accomplished, and are sensible
that what has been may be equalled if not excelled. In great libraries, we realize how the
works of the ambitious are neglected, and their names forgotten, while we cannot fail to be
impressed with the value of the truth, that the only labor which brings a certain reward is
that performed under a sense of duty.

Salem is itself the intelligent and refined centre of an intelligent and prosperous population;
and we may venture so far, in just eulogy, as to attribute to it the united advantages of city
and country, without a large share of the privations of the one, or the vices of the other.
Of the four Normal Schools, this is, unquestionably, the most fortunate in its position and
surroundings. We, therefore, ask for the concurrence of the public in the judgment which has
established it in this city. If it shall be the fortune of the government to assemble a body
of instructors qualified for their stations, there will then remain no reason why these accommodations
and advantages should not be fully enjoyed.

The Normal School differs from all other seminaries of learning, and only because it is an
auxiliary to the common schools can it be deemed their inferior in importance. The academy
and college take young men from the district and high schools, and furnish them with additional
aids for the business of life; but the Normal School is truly the helper of the common schools.
It receives its pupils from them, fits these pupils for teachers, and sends them back to superintend
where a few months before they were scholars. The Normal Schools are sustained by the common
schools; and these latter, in return, draw their best nutriment from the former. This institution
stands with the common school; it is as truly popular, as really democratic in a just sense,
and its claim for support rests upon the same foundation.

In Massachusetts we have abandoned the idea, never, I think, general, that instruction in the
art of teaching is unnecessary.

The Normal School is, with us, a necessity; for it furnishes that tuition which neither the
common school, academy, nor college can. These institutions were once better adapted to this
service than now. There has been a continual increase of academic studies, until it has become
necessary to establish institutions for special purposes; and of these the Normal School is
one. Its object is definite. The true Normal School instructs only in the art of teaching;
and, in this respect, it must be confessed we have failed, sadly failed, to realize the ideal
of the system. It is not a substitute for the common school, academy, or college, though many
pupils, and in some degree the public, have been inclined thus to treat it. There should be
no instruction in the departments of learning, high or low, except what is incidental to the
main business of the institution; yet some have gone so far in the wrong course as to suggest
that not only the common branches should be studied, but that tuition should be given in the
languages and the higher mathematics. A little reflection will satisfy us how great a departure
this would be from the just idea of the Normal School. Yet circumstances, rather than public
sentiment, have compelled the government to depart in practice, though never in theory, from
the true system.

It so happens that much time is occupied in instruction in those branches which ought to be
thoroughly mastered by the pupil before he enters the Normal School,--that is, before he begins
to acquire the art of teaching what he has not himself learned.

Such is the state of our schools that we are obliged to accept as pupils those who are not
qualified, in a literary point of view, for the post of teachers. By sending better teachers
into the public schools, you will effectually aid in the removal of this difficulty. The Normal
School is, then, no substitute for the high school, academy, or college. Nor do we ask for
any sympathy or aid which properly belongs to those institutions. He is no friend of education,
in its proper signification, who patronizes some one institution, and neglects all others.
We have no seminaries of learning which can be considered useless, and he only is a true friend
who aids and encourages any and all as he has opportunity. What is popularly known as learning
is to be acquired in the common school, high school, academy and college, as heretofore. The
Normal School does not profess to give instruction in reading and arithmetic, but to teach
the art of teaching reading and arithmetic. So of all the elementary branches. But, as the
art of teaching a subject cannot be acquired without at the same time acquiring a better knowledge
of the subject itself, the pupil will always leave the Normal School better grounded than ever
before in the elements and principles of learning. It is not, however, to be expected that
complete success will be realized here more than elsewhere; yet it is well to elevate the standard
of admission, from time to time, so that a larger part of the exercises may be devoted to the
main purpose of the institution. The struggle should be perpetual and in the right direction.
First, elevate your common schools so that the education there may be a sufficient basis for
a course of training here. If the Normal School and the public schools shall each and all do
their duty, candidates for admission will be so well qualified in the branches required, that
the art of teaching will be the only art taught here. When this is the case, the time of attendance
will be diminished, and a much larger number of persons may be annually qualified for the station
of teachers.

Next, let the committees and others interested in education make special efforts to fill the
chairs of your hall with young women of promise, who are likely to devote themselves to the
profession. It is, however, impossible for human wisdom to guard against one fate that happens
to all, or nearly all, the young women who are graduated at our Normal Schools. But this remark
is not made publicly, lest some anxious ones avail themselves of your bounty as a means to
an end not contemplated by the state.

The house you have erected is not so much dedicated to the school as to the public; the institution
here set up is not so much for the benefit of the young women who may become pupils, as for
the benefit of the public which they represent. The appeal is, therefore, to the public to
furnish such pupils, in number and character, that this institution may soon and successfully
enter upon the work for which it is properly designed.

But the character and value of this school depend on the quality of its teachers more than
on all things else. They should be thoroughly instructed, not only in the branches taught,
but in the art of teaching them.

The teacher ought to have attained much that the pupil is yet to learn; if he has not, he cannot
utter words of encouragement, nor estimate the chances of success. It is not enough to know
what is contained in the text-book; the pupil should know that, at least; the teacher should
know a great deal more. A person is not qualified for the office of teacher when he has mastered
a book; and has, in fact, no right to instruct others until he has mastered the subject.

Text-books help us a little on the road of learning; but, by and by, whatever our pursuit or
profession, we leave them behind, or else content ourselves with a subordinate position. Practical
men have made book-farmers the subject of ridicule; and there is some propriety in this; for
he is not a master in his profession who has not got, as a general thing, out of and beyond
the books which treat of it.

Books are necessary in the school-room; but the good teacher has little use for them in his
own hands, or as aids in his own proper work. He should be instructed in his subject, aside
from and above the arbitrary rules of authors; and he will be, if he is himself inspired with
a love of learning. Inspired with a love of learning! Whoever is, is sure of success; and whoever
is not, has the best possible security for the failure of his plans. There cannot be a good
school where the love of learning in teacher and pupil is wanting; and there cannot be a bad
one where this spirit has control. As the master, so is the disciple; as the teacher, so is
the pupil; for the spirit of the teacher will be communicated to the scholars. There must also
be habits of industry and system in study. We have multitudes of scholars who study occasionally,
and study hard; but we need a race of students who will devote themselves habitually, and with
love, to literature and science.

On the teachers, then, is the chief responsibility, whether the young women who go out from
this institution are well qualified for their profession or not. The study of technicalities
is drudgery of the worst sort to the mere pupil; but the scholar looks upon it as a preparation
for a wide and noble exercise of his intellectual powers--as a key to unlock the mysteries
of learning. It is the business of the teacher to lighten the labors of to-day by bright visions
of to-morrow.

There is a school in medicine, whose chief claim is, that it invites and prepares Nature to
act in the removal of disease.

We pass no judgment upon this claim; but he is, no doubt, the best teacher who does little
for his pupils, while he incites and encourages them to do much for themselves. Extensive knowledge
will enable the teacher to do this.

He is a poor instructor of mathematics who sees only the dry details of rules, tables and problems,
and never ascends to the contemplation of those supreme wonders of the universe which mathematical
astronomy has laid open. The grammar of a language is defined to be the art of reading and
writing that language with propriety. The study of its elements is dry and uninteresting; and,
while the teacher dwells with care upon the merits of the text, he should also lift the veil
from that which is hidden, and lead his pupils to appreciate those riches of learning which
the knowledge of a language may confer upon the student.

It is useful to know the division of the globe into continents and oceans, islands and lakes,
mountains and rivers--and this knowledge the text-books contain; but it is a higher learning
to understand the effect of this division upon climate, soil and natural productions--upon
the character and pursuits of the human race. Books are so improved that they may very well
take the place of poor, or even ordinary teachers.

Explanations and illustrations are numerous and appropriate, and very little remains for the
mere text-book teacher to do. But, when the duties of teacher and the exercises of the school-room
are properly performed, the entire range of science, business, literature and art, is presented
to the student. May it be your fortune to see education thus elevated here, and then will the
same spirit be infused into the public schools of the vicinity.

The Massachusetts system of education is a noble tribute to freedom of thought. The power of
educating a people, which is, in fine, the chief power in a state, has been often, if not usually,
perverted to the support of favored opinions in religion and government. The boasted system
of Prussia is only a prop and ally of the existing order of things. In France, Napoleon makes
the press, which has become in civilized countries an educator of the people, the mere instrument
of his will. Tyrants do not hesitate to pervert schools and the press, learning and literature,
to the support of tyranny. But with us the press and the school are free; and this freedom,
denied through fear in other countries, is the best evidence of the stability of our institutions.
It is now a hundred years since an attempt was made in Massachusetts to exercise legal censorship
over the press; but we occasionally hear of movements to make the public schools of America
subservient to sect or party. The success of these movements would be as great a calamity as
can ever befall a free people. Ignorance would take the place of learning, and slavery would
usurp the domain of liberty.

No defence, excuse, or palliation, can be offered for such movements; and their triumph will
safely produce all the evils which it is possible for an enlightened people to endure. Our
system of instruction is what it professes to be,--a public system. As sects or parties, we
have no claim whatever upon it. A man is not taxed because he is of a particular faith in religion,
or party in politics; he is not taxed because he is the father of a family, or excused because
he is not; but he contributes to the cause of education because he is a citizen, and has an
interest in that general intelligence which decides questions of faith and practice as they
arise. It is for the interest of all that all shall be educated for the various pursuits and
duties of the time. The education of children is, no doubt, first in individual duty. It is
the duty of the parent, the duty of the friend; but, above all, it is the duty of the public.
This duty arises from the relations of men in every civilized state; but in a popular government
it becomes a necessity. The people are the source of power--the sovereign. And is it more important
in a monarchy than in a republic that the ruler be intelligent, virtuous, and in all respects
qualified for his duties?

The institution here set up is an essential part of our system of public instruction, and,
as such, it claims the public favor, sympathy and support.

This is a period of excitement in all the affairs and relations of men, and America is fast
becoming the central point of these activities. They are, no doubt, associated with many blessings,
but they may also be attended by great evils. We claim for our country preëminence in education.
This may be just, but it is also true that Americans, more than any other people, need to be
better educated than they are. Where else is the field of statesmanship so large, or the necessity
for able statesmen so great?

With the single exception of Great Britain, there is no nation whose relations are such as
to require a union in rulers of the rarest practical abilities with accurate, sound and varied
learning; and there is no nation whose people are so critical in the tests they apply to their
public agents. We need men thoroughly educated in all the departments of learning; to which
ought to be added, travel in foreign countries, and an intimate acquaintance with every part
of our own. Such men we have had--such men we have now; but they will be more and more important
as we advance in numbers, territory and power. A corresponding culture is necessary in theology,
in law, and in all the pursuits of industry.

No other nation has so great a destiny. That destiny is manifest, and may be read in the heart
and purpose of the people. They seek new territories, an increase of population, the prosperity
of commerce, of all the arts of industry, and preëminence in virtue, learning and intellectual
power. And all this they can attain; for the destiny of a people, within the limits prescribed
by reason, is determined by themselves. If, however, by conquest, annexation and absorption,
we acquire new territories, and strange races and nations of men, and yet neglect education,
every step will but increase our burdens and perils, and hasten our decay.

FEMALE EDUCATION.

[An Address before the Newburyport Female High School.]

I accepted, without a moment's delay, the invitation of the principal of this school to deliver
the customary address on this, the fifteenth anniversary of its establishment. My presence
here in connection with public instruction is not a proper subject for comment by myself; but
I have now come, allow me to say, with unusual alacrity, that we may together recognize the
claims of an institution which furnishes the earliest evidence existing among us of a special
design on the part of the public to provide adequate intellectual and moral training for the
young women of the state.

Those movements which have accomplished most for religion, liberty, and learning, have not
been sudden in their origin nor rapid in their progress. Christianity has been preached eighteen
hundred years, yet it is not now received, even intellectually, by the larger part of the human
race. Magna Charta is six centuries old, but its principles are not accepted by all the nations
of Europe and America; and it is not, therefore, strange that a system of public instruction,
originated by the Puritans of New England, should yet be struggling against prejudice and error.
In Asia woman is degraded, and in Europe her common condition is that of apparent and absolute
inferiority. When America was settled she became a participator in the struggles and sufferings
which awaited the pioneers of civilization and liberty on this continent, and she thus earned
a place in family, religious, and even in public life, which foreshowed her certain and speedy
disenthrallment from the tyranny of tradition and time. Her rights with us are secure, and
the anxiety and boisterous alarm exhibited by some strong-minded women, and the horror-fringed
apprehensions and prophecies of some weak-minded men, are equally unreasonable and absurd.
Woman is sharing the lot of humanity, and therewith she ought to be content. Man does not remove
the burden of ignorance and oppression from his sex, merely, but generally from his kind. At
least, this is the experience and promise of America. If woman does not vote because she is
woman, so and for the same reason she is not subject to personal taxation. It is an error to
suppose that voting is a privilege, and taxation, ever and always, a burden. Both are duties;
and the privilege of the one and the burden of the other are only incidental and subordinate.
The human family is an aggregation of families; and the family, not the man nor the woman,
is the unit of the state. The civil law assumes the existence of the family relation, and its
unity where it exists; hence taxation of the woman brings no revenue to the state that might
not have been secured by the taxation of the man; and hence the exercise of the elective franchise
by the woman brings no additional political power; for, in the theory of the relation to which
there are, in fact, but few exceptions, there is in the household but one political idea, and
but one agent is needed for its expression. The ballot is the judgment of the family; not of
the man, merely, nor of the woman, nor yet, indeed, always of both, even. The first smile that
the father receives from the child affects every subsequent vote in municipal concerns, and
likely enough also in national affairs. From that moment forward, he judges constables, selectmen,
magistrates, aldermen, mayors, school-committees, and councillors, with an altered judgment.
The result of the election is not the victory or defeat of the man alone; it is the triumph
or prostration of a principle or purpose with which the family is identified.

Is it said that there is occasionally, if not frequently, a divided judgment in the household
upon those questions that are decided by the ballot? This must, of course, be granted as an
exceptional condition of domestic life; but, for the wisest reasons of public policy, whose
avoidance by the state would be treachery to humanity, the law universal can recognize only
the general condition of things. So, and for kindred but not equally strong reasons, the elective
franchise is exercised by men without families, and denied to those women who by the dispensations
of Divine Providence are called to preside in homes where the father's face is seen no more.
But why, in the eye of the state, shall the man stand as the head of the family, rather than
the woman? Because God has so ordained it; and no civil community has ever yet escaped from
the force of His decree in this respect. Those whose physical power defends the nation, or
tribe, or family, are naturally called upon to decide what the means of defence shall be. Is
not woman, then, the equal of man? We cannot say of woman, with reference to man, that she
is his superior, or his inferior, or his equal; nor can we say of man, with reference to woman,
that he is her superior, or her inferior, or her equal. He is her protector, she is his helpmeet.
His strength is sufficient for her weakness, and her power is the support of his irresolution
and want of faith. Woman's rights are not man's rights; nor are man's rights the measure of
woman's rights. If she should assert her independence, as some idiosyncratic persons desire,
she could only declare her intention to do all those acts and things which woman may of right
do. Given that this is accomplished, and I know not that she would possess one additional domestic,
political, or public right, or enjoy one privilege in the family, neighborhood, or state, to
which she is not, in some degree, at least, already accustomed.

These views and reflections may serve to illustrate and enforce the leading position of this
address--that we are to educate young women for the enjoyments and duties of the sphere in
which they are to move. We speak to-day of public instruction; but it should ever be borne
in mind that the education of the schools is but a part, and often only the least important
part, of the training that the young receive. There is the training of infancy and early childhood,
the daily culture of home, with its refining or deadening influences, and then the education
of the street, the parlor, the festive gathering, and the clubs, which exert a power over the
youth of both sexes that cannot often be controlled entirely by the school.

Womanhood is sometimes sacrificed in childhood, when the mother and the family fail to develop
the womanly qualities of modesty, grace, generosity of character, and geniality of temper,
which dignify, adorn, and protect,

     "The sex whose presence civilizes ours."

The child, whether girl or boy, reflects the character of its home; and therefore we are compelled
to deal with all the homes of the district or town, and are required often to counteract the
influences they exert. Early vicious training is quite as disastrous to the girl as to the
boy; for, strange as it may seem, the world more readily tolerates ignorance, coarseness, rudeness,
immodesty, and all their answering vices, in man than in woman. In the period of life from
eight to twenty years of age the progress of woman is, to us of sterner mould, inconceivably
rapid; but from twenty to forty the advantages of education are upon the other side. It then
follows that a defective system of education is more pernicious to woman than to man.

We may contemplate woman in four relations with their answering responsibilities--as pupil,
teacher, companion, and mother. As a pupil, she is sensitive, conscientious, quick, ambitious,
and possesses in a marvellous degree, as compared with the other sex, the power of intuition.
The boy is logical, or he is nothing; but logic is not necessary for the girl. Not that she
is illogical; but she usually sees through, without observing the steps in the process which
a boy must discern before he can comprehend the subject presented to his mind. In the use of
the eye, the ear, the voice, and in the appropriation of whatever may be commanded without
the highest exercise of the reasoning and reflective faculties, she is incomparably superior.
She accepts moral truth without waiting for a demonstration, and she obeys the law founded
upon it without being its slave. She instinctively prefers good manners to faulty habits; and,
in the requirements of family, social, and fashionable life, she is better educated at sixteen
than her brother is at twenty. She is an adept in one only of the vices of the school--whispering--and
in that she excels. But she does not so readily resort to the great vice--the crime of falsehood--as
do her companions of the other sex. I call falsehood the great vice, because, if this were
unknown, tardiness, truancy, obscenity, and profanity, could not thrive. Holmes has well said
that "sin has many tools, but a lie is the handle that will fit them all."

In many primary and district schools the habits and manners of children are too much neglected.
We associate good habits and good manners with good morals; and, though we are deceived again
and again, and soliloquize upon the maxim that "all is not gold that glitters," we instinctively
believe, however often we are betrayed. Habits and manners are the first evidence of character;
and so much of weight do we attach to such evidence, that we give credit and confidence to
those whom in our calmer moments we know to be unworthy. The first aim in the school should
be to build up a character that shall be truthfully indicated by purity and refinement of manner
and conversation. It does, indeed, sometimes happen that purity of character is not associated
with refinement of manners. This misfortune is traceable to a defective early education, both
in the school and the home; for, had either been faithful and intelligent, the evil would have
been averted. And, as there are many homes in city and country where refinement of manners
is not found, and, of course, cannot be taught, the schools must furnish the training. In this
connection, the value of the high school for females--whether exclusively so or not, does not
seem to me important--is clearly seen. Young women are naturally and properly the teachers
of primary, district, and subordinate schools of every grade; and society as naturally and
properly looks to them to educate, by example as well as by precept, all the children of the
state in good habits, good manners, and good morals. We are also permitted to look forward
to the higher relations of life, when, as wives and mothers, they are to exert a potent influence
over existing and future generations. The law and the lexicons say "home is the house or the
place where one resides." This definition may answer for the law and the lexicons, but it does
not meet the wants of common life.

The wife will usually find in her husband less refinement of manners than she herself possesses;
and it is her great privilege, if not her solemn duty, to illustrate the line of Cowper, and
show that she is of

     "The sex whose presence civilizes ours."

It is the duty of the teacher to make the school attractive; and what the teacher should do
for the school the wife should do for the home. The home should be preferred by the husband
and children to all other places. Much depends upon themselves; they have no right to claim
all of the wife and mother. But, without her aid, they can do but little. With her aid, every
desirable result may be accomplished. That this result may be secured, female education must
be generous, critical, and pure, in everything that relates to manners, habits, and morals.
Much may be added to these, but nothing can serve in their stead. We should add, no doubt,
thorough elementary training in reading, writing, and spelling, both for her own good and for
the service of her children. Intellectual training is defective where these elements are neglected,
and their importance to the sexes may be equal. We should not omit music and the culture of
the voice. The tones of the voice indicate the tone of the mind; but the temper itself may
finally yield to a graceful and gentle form of expression. It is not probable that we shall
ever give due attention to the cultivation of the human voice for speaking, reading, and singing.
This is an invaluable accomplishment in man. Many of us have listened to New England's most
distinguished living orator, and felt that well-known lines from the English poets derived
new power, if not actual inspiration, from the classic tones in which the words were uttered.

A cultivated voice in woman is at once the evidence and the means of moral power. As the moral
sensibilities of the girl are more acute than those of the boy, so the moral power of the woman
is greater than that of the man. Many young women are educating themselves for the business
of teaching; and I can commend nothing more important, after the proper ordering of one's own
life, than the discreet and careful training of the voice. It is itself a power. It demands
sympathy before the suffering or its cause is revealed by articulate speech; its tones awe
assemblies, and command silence before the speaker announces his views; and the rebellious
and disorderly, whether in the school, around the rostrum, or on the field, bow in submission
beneath the authority of its majestic cadences. It is hardly possible to imagine a good school,
and very rare to see one, where this power is wanting in the teacher. Women are often called
to take charge of schools where there are lads and youth destitute of that culture which would
lead them to yield respect and consequent obedience. Physical force in these cases is not usually
to be thought of; but nature has vouchsafed to woman such a degree of moral power, of which
in the school the voice is the best expression, as often to fully compensate for her weakness
in other respects.

It is unnecessary to commend reading as an art and an accomplishment; but good readers are
so rare among us, that we cannot too strongly urge teachers to qualify themselves for the great
work. I say great work, because everything else is comparatively easy to the teacher, and comparatively
unimportant to the pupil. Grammar is merely an element of reading. It should be introduced
as soon as the child's reasoning faculties are in any degree developed, and presented by the
living voice, without the aid of books. The alphabet should be taught in connection with exercises
for strengthening and modulating the voice, and the elementary sounds of the letters should
be deemed as important as their names. All this is the proper work of the female teacher; and,
when she is ignorant or neglects her duty, the evil is usually so great as to admit of no complete
remedy.

Reading is at once an imitative and an appreciative art on the part of the pupil. He must be
trained to appreciate the meaning of the writer; but he will depend upon the teacher at first,
and, indeed, for a long time, for an example of the true mode of expression. This the teacher
must be ready to give. It is not enough that she can correct faults of pronunciation, censure
inarticulate utterances, and condemn gruff, nasal, and guttural sounds; but she must be able
to present, in reasonable purity, all the opposite qualities. The young women have not yet
done their duty to the cause of education in these respects; nor is there everywhere a public
sentiment that will even now allow the duty to be performed.

It is difficult to see why the child of five, and the youth of fifteen, should be kept an equal
number of hours at school. Each pupil should spend as much time in the school-room as is needed
for the preparation of the exercise and the exercise itself. The danger from excessive confinement
and labor is with young pupils. Those in grammar and high schools may often use additional
hours for study; but a pupil should be somewhat advanced, and should possess considerable physical
strength and endurance, before he ventures to give more than six hours a day to severe intellectual
labor. It must often happen that children in primary schools can learn in two hours each day
all that the teacher has time to communicate, or they have power to receive and appropriate.
Indeed, I think this is usually so. It may not, however, be safe to deduce from this fact the
opinion that children should never be kept longer in school than two hours a day; but it seems
proper to assume that, if blessed with good homes, they may be relieved from the tedium of
confinement in the school-room, when there is no longer opportunity for improvement.

We are beginning to realize the advantages of well-educated female teachers in primary schools;
nor do I deem it improbable that they shall become successful teachers and managers of schools
of higher grade, according to the present public estimation. But, in regard to the latter position,
I have neither hope, desire, nor anxiety. Whenever the public judge them, generally, or in
particular cases, qualified to take charge of high schools and normal schools, those positions
will be assigned to them; and, till that degree of public confidence is accorded, it is useless
to make assertions or indulge in conjectures concerning the ability of women for such duties.
It is my own conviction that a higher order of teaching talent is required in the primary school,
or for the early, judicious education of children, than is required in any other institutions
of learning. Nor can it be shown that equal ability for government is not essential. There
must be different manifestations of ability in the primary and the high school; but, where
proper training has been enjoyed, pupils in the latter ought to be far advanced in the acquisition
of the cardinal virtue of self-control, whose existence in the school and the state renders
government comparatively unnecessary.

Where there is a human being, there are the opportunity and the duty of education. But our
present great concern, as friends of learning, is with those schools where children are first
trained in the elements. If in these we can have faithful, accurate, systematic, comprehensive
teaching, everything else desirable will be added thereunto. But, if we are negligent, unphilosophical,
and false, the reasonable public expectation will never be realized in regard to other institutions
of learning.

The work must be done by women, and by well-educated women; and, when it is said that in Massachusetts
alone we need the services of six thousand such persons, the magnitude of the work of providing
teachers may be appreciated. Have we not enough in this field for every female school and academy,
where high schools are not required, or cannot exist, and for every high school and normal
school in the commonwealth? If it is asserted that the supply of female teachers is already
greater than the demand, it must be stated, in reply, that there are persons enough engaged
in teaching, but that the number of competent teachers is, and ever has been, too small. It
is something, my friends, it is often a great deal, to send into a town a well-qualified female
teacher. She is not only a blessing to those who are under her tuition, but her example and
influence are often such as to change the local sentiment concerning teachers and schools.
When may we expect a supply of such persons? The hope is not a delusion, though its realization
may be many years postponed. How are competent persons to be selected and qualified? The change
will be gradual, and it is to be made in the public opinion as well as in the character of
teachers and schools. And is it not possible, even in view of all that has been accomplished,
that we are yet groping in a dark passage, with only the hope that it leads to an outward-opening
door, where, in marvellous but genial light we shall perceive new truths concerning the philosophy
of the human mind, and the means of its development? At this moment we are compelled to admit
that practical teachers and theorists in educational matters are alike uncertain in regard
to the true method of teaching the alphabet, and divided and subdivided in opinion concerning
the order of succession of the various studies in the primary and grammar schools. Perfect
agreement on these points is not probable; it may not be desirable. I am satisfied that no
greater contribution can be made to the cause of learning than a presentation of these topics
and their elucidation, so that the teacher shall feel that what he does is philosophical, and
therefore wise.

The only way to achieve success is to apply faithfully the means at hand. Generations of children
cannot wait for perfection in methods of teaching; but teachers of primary schools ought not
to neglect any opportunity which promises aid to them as individuals, or progress in the profession
that they have chosen. As teachers improve, so do schools; and, as schools improve, so do teachers.
The influence exerted by teachers is first beneficial to pupils, but, as a result, we soon
have a class of better qualified teachers. With these ideas of the importance of the teacher's
vocation to primary instruction, and, consequently, to all good learning, it is not strange
that I place a high value upon professional training. A degree of professional training more
or less desirable is, no doubt, furnished, by every school; but the admission does not in any
manner detract from the force of the statement that a young man or woman well qualified in
the branches to be taught, yet without experience, may be strengthened and prepared for the
work of teaching, by devoting six, twelve, or eighteen months, under competent instructors,
in company with a hundred other persons having a similar object in view, to the study, examination,
and discussion, of those subjects and topics which are sometimes connected with, and sometimes
independent of, the text-books, but which are of daily value to the teacher.

At present only a portion of this necessary professional training can be given in the normal
schools. If, however, as I trust may sometimes be the case, none should be admitted but those
who are already qualified in the branches to be taught, the time of attendance might be diminished,
and the number of graduates proportionately increased. There are about one hundred high schools
in the state, and, within the sphere of their labors, they are not equalled by any institutions
that the world has seen. Young men are fitted for the colleges, for mechanical, manufacturing,
commercial, agricultural, and scientific labors, and young men and young women are prepared
for the general duties of life. They are also furnishing a large number of well-qualified teachers.
Some may say that with these results we ought to be content. Regarding only the past, they
are entirely satisfactory; but, animated with reasonable hopes concerning the future, we claim
something more and better. It is not disguised that the members of normal schools, when admitted,
do not sustain an average rank in scholarship with graduates of high schools. This is a misfortune
from which relief is sought. It is a suggestion, diffidently made, yet with considerable confidence
in its practicability and value, that graduates of high schools will often obtain additional
and necessary preparation by attending a normal school, if for the term of six months only.
And I am satisfied, beyond all reasonable doubt, that, when the normal schools receive only
those whose education is equivalent to that now given in the high schools, a body of teachers
will be sent out who will surpass the graduates of any other institution, and whose average
professional attainments and practical excellence will meet the highest reasonable public expectation.
Nor is it claimed that this result will be due to anything known or practised in normal schools
that may not be known and practised elsewhere; but it is rather attributable to the fact that
in these institutions the attention of teachers and pupils is directed almost exclusively to
the work of teaching, and the means of preparation. The studies, thoughts, and discussions,
are devoted to this end. If, with such opportunities, there should be no progress, we should
be led to doubt all our previous knowledge of human character, and of the development of the
youthful mind.

And now, ladies and gentlemen, before I conclude, allow me to remove, or at least to lessen,
an impression that these remarks are calculated to produce. I have assumed that teaching is
a profession--an arduous profession--and that perfection has not yet been attained. I have
assumed, also, that there are many persons engaged in teaching, especially in the primary and
mixed district schools, whose qualifications are not as great as they ought to be. But let
it not be thence inferred that I am dissatisfied with our teachers and schools. There has been
continual progress in education, and a large share of this progress is due to teachers; but
the time has not yet come when we can wisely fold our arms, and accept the allurements of undisturbed
repose.

Nor have I sought, on this occasion, to present even an outline of a system of female education.
In all the public institutions of learning among us, it should be as comprehensive, as minute,
as exact, as that furnished for youth of the other sex. Nor is it necessary to concern ourselves
about the effect of this liberal culture upon the character and fortunes of society. I do not
anticipate any sudden or disastrous effects. The right of education is a common right; and
it is unquestionably the right of woman to assert her rights; and it is a wrong and sin if
we withhold any, even the least. Having faith in humanity, and faith in God, let us not shrink
from the privilege we enjoy of offering to all, without reference to sex or condition, the
benefits of a public and liberal system of education, which seeks, in an alliance with virtue
and religion, whose banns are forbidden by none, to enlighten the ignorant, restrain and reform
the depraved, and penetrate all society with good learning and civilization, so that the highest
idea of a well-ordered state shall be realized in an advanced and advancing condition of individual
and family life.

THE INFLUENCE, DUTIES, AND REWARDS, OF TEACHERS.

[A Lecture delivered at Teachers' Institutes.]

It is the purpose, and we believe that it will be the destiny, of Massachusetts, to build up
a comparatively perfect system of public instruction. To this antiquity did not aspire; and
it is the just boast of modern times, and especially of the American States, that learning
is not the amusement of a few only, whom wealth and taste have led into its paths, but that
it is encouraged by governments, and cherished by the whole people. Antiquity had its schools
and teachers; but the latter were, for the most part, founders of sects in politics, morals,
philosophy, religion, or the habits of daily life; while its schools were frequented and sustained
by those who sought to build on the civilization of the times such structures as their tastes
conceived or their opinions dictated.

There were not in Athens or Rome, according to the American idea, any schools for the people;
and Carlyle, Brownson, and Emerson, are such teachers in kind, though not in power and influence,
as were Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. These men were leaders as well as teachers, and their
followers were disciples and controversialists rather than pupils. But it is not possible for
modern leaders in politics, philosophy, and social life, to rival the ancients. Manual labor
is not more divided and subdivided than is the influence of the human intellect. The newspaper
has inspired every man with the love of self-judgment, and the common school has qualified
him, in some degree, for its exercise. The ancients, whose names and fame have come down to
us, taught by conversations, discussions, and lectures; the moderns, as Carlyle, Brownson,
and Emerson, by lectures, essays, and reviews. But these systems are quite inadequate to meet
the wants of American civilization.

Indeed, however men of talent may strive, there cannot be another Socrates, Plato, or Aristotle;
for the printing-press has come, and their occupation has gone. Teachers were philosophers,
pupils were followers and disciples, while learning was devoted to the support of speculations
and theories.

But, while we have no such teachers as those of Athens, and need no such schools as they founded,
we have teachers and schools whose character and genius correspond to the age in which we live.
Teaching is a profession; not merely an ignoble pursuit, nor a toy of scholastic ambition,
but a profession enjoying the public confidence, requiring great talents, demanding great industry,
and securing, permit me to say, great rewards. To be the leader of a sect or the founder of
a school, is something; but the acceptable teacher is superior to either; he is the first and
chief exponent of a popular sovereignty which seeks happiness and immortality for itself by
elevating and refining the parts of which it is composed. The ancient teacher gathered his
hearers, disciples, and pupils, in the streets, groves, and public squares. The modern teacher
is comparatively secluded; but let him not hence infer that he is without influence. Socrates,
Plato, and Aristotle, had their triumphs; but none more distinguished than that of a Massachusetts
teacher, who, at the age of fourscore years, on a festive day, received from his former pupils--and
among them were the most eminent of the land--sincere and affectionate assurances of esteem
and gratitude. The pupil may be estranged from the master in opinion, for our system does not
concern itself with opinions, political or religious; but the faithful teacher will always
find the evidence of his fidelity in the lives of those intrusted to his care. No position
is more important than the teacher's; and his influence is next to that of the parent. It is
his high and noble province to touch the youthful mind, test its quality, and develop its characteristics.
He often stands in the place of the parent. He aids in giving character to the generations
of men; which is at once a higher art and a purer glory than distinguishes those who build
the walls of cities, or lay the foundations of empires. The cities which contested for the
honor of being the birthplace of Homer are forgotten, or remembered only because they contested
for the honor, while Homer himself is immortal. If, then, the mere birth of a human being is
an honor to a city, how illustrious the distinction of those who guide the footsteps of youth
along the rugged paths of learning, and develop in a generation the principles of integrity
and mercy, justice and freedom, government and humanity! If in a lifetime of toil the teacher
shall bring out of the mass of common minds one Franklin, or Howard, or Channing, or Bowditch,
he will have accomplished more than is secured by the devotees of wealth, or the disciples
of pleasure. As the man is more important than the mere philosopher, so is the modern teacher
more elevated than the ancient.

The true teacher takes hold of the practical and elementary, as distinguished from the learning
whose chief or sole value is in display. Present gratification is desirable, especially to
parents and teachers; but it may be secured at the cost of solid learning and real progress.
This is a serious error among us, and it will not readily be abandoned; but it is the duty
of teachers, and of all parents who are friends to genuine learning, to aid in its removal.
We are inclined to treat the period of school-life as though it covered the entire time that
ought properly to be devoted to education. The first result--a result followed by pernicious
consequences--is that the teacher is expected to give instruction in every branch that the
pupil, as child, youth, or adult, may need to know. It is impossible that instruction so varied
should always be good. Learning is knowledge of subjects based and built upon a thorough acquaintance
with their elements. The path of duty, therefore, should lead the teacher to make his instruction
thorough in a few branches, rather than attempt to extend it over a great variety of subjects.
This, to the teacher who is employed in a district or town but three or six months, is a hard
course, and many may not be inclined to pursue it. Something, no doubt, must be yielded to
parents; but they, too, should be educated to a true view of their children's interests. As
the world is, a well-spoken declamation is more gratifying to parents, and more creditable
to teachers, than the most careful training in the vowel-sounds; yet the latter is infinitely
more valuable to the scholar. Neither progress in the languages nor knowledge of mathematics
can compensate for the want of a thorough etymological discipline. This training should be
primary in point of time, as well as elementary in character; and a classical education is
no adequate compensation.

Elements are all-important to the teacher and the student. It is not possible to have an idea
of a square without some idea of a straight line, nor to express with pencil or words the arc
of a circle without a previous conception of the curve. Combination follows in course. We are
driven to it. Our own minds, all nature, all civilization, tend to the combination of elements.

We think fast, live fast, learn fast, and, as the fashion of the world requires a knowledge
of many things, we crowd the entire education of our children into the short period of school-life.
Here, and just here, public sentiment ought to relieve the teacher by reforming itself.

It should be understood that school-life is to be devoted to the thorough discipline of the
mind to study, and to an acquaintance with those simple, elementary branches, which are the
foundation of all good learning. When a knowledge of the elements is secured, then the languages,
mathematics, and all science, may be pursued with enthusiasm and success by a class of men
well educated in every department. Public sentiment must allow the teacher to give careful
instruction in reading and spelling, for example, in the most comprehensive meaning of those
terms--in the sound and power of letters, in the composition and use of words, and in the natural
construction of sentences. This, of course, includes a knowledge of grammar, not as a dry,
philological study, but as a science; not as composed of arbitrary rules, merely, but as the
common and best judgment of men concerning the use and power of language, of which rules and
definitions are but an imperfect expression.

Nor do we herein assign the teacher to neglect or obscurity. He, as well as others, must have
faith in the future. His reward may be distant, but it is certain.

It is, however, likely that the labors of a faithful elementary teacher will be appreciated
immediately, and upon the scene of his toil. But, if they are not, his pupils, advancing in
age and increasing in knowledge, will remember with gratitude and in words the self-sacrificing
labors of their master.

We are not so constituted as to labor without motive. With some the motive is high, with others
it is low and grovelling. The teacher must be himself elevated, or he cannot elevate others.
The pupil may, indeed, advance to a higher sphere than that occupied by the teacher; but it
is only because he draws from a higher fountain elsewhere. In such cases the success of the
pupil is not the success of the master. He who labors as a teacher for mere money, or for temporary
fame, which is even less valuable, cannot choose a calling more ignoble, nor can he ever rise
to a higher; for his sordid motives bring all pursuits to the low level of his own nature.

Yet it is not to be assumed that the teacher, more than the clergyman, is to labor without
pecuniary compensation; for, while money should not be the sole object of any man's life, it
is, under the influence of our civilization, essential to the happiness of us all. Wealth,
properly acquired and properly used, may become a means of self-education. It purchases relief
from the harassing toil of uninterrupted manual labor. It is the only introduction we can have
to the thoroughfares of travel by which we are made acquainted personally with the globe that
we inhabit. It brings to our firesides books, paintings, and statuary, by which we learn something
of the world as it is and as it was. It gives us the telescope and the microscope, by whose
agency we are able to appreciate, even though but imperfectly, the immensity of creation on
the one hand, and its infinity on the other. The teacher is not to labour without money, nor
to despise it more than other men; and the public might as well expect the free services of
the minister, lawyer, physician, or farmer, as to expect the gratuitous or cheap education
of their children. While the teacher is educating others, he must also educate himself. This
he cannot do without both leisure and money. The advice of Iago is, therefore, good advice
for teachers: "Go, make money. * * Put money enough in your purse." The teacher's motives should
be above mere gain; though this view of the subject does not, as some might infer, lead to
the conclusion that he ought to labor for inadequate compensation.

When George III. was first insane, Dr. Willis was called to the immediate personal charge of
the king. Dr. Willis had been educated to the church, and a living had been assigned him; but,
becoming interested in the subject of insanity, he had established an asylum, and gained a
distinguished position in his new profession. The suffering monarch was sadly puzzled to know
why Dr. Willis was with him, and how he had been brought there. The custodian was not very
definite in his explanations, but suggested that he came to comfort the king in his afflictions;
and, said he, "You know that our Saviour went about doing good."--"Yes," said the king, "but
he never received seven hundred pounds a year for it." This was good wit, especially good royal
wit, because unexpected. But there is no reason why actual monarchs of England, or coming monarchs
of America, should be treated or taught gratuitously. The compensation, the living of the teacher,
is one thing; the motive may and ought to be quite different. The teacher should labor in his
profession because he loves it, because he does good in it, and because he can in that sphere
answer a high purpose of existence. These being the motives of the teacher, he should educate,
draw out, corresponding ones in his pupils.

The teacher is not to create--he is to draw out. Every child has the germs of many, and, it
may be, quite different qualities of character. Look at the infant. It is so constituted that
it may have a stalwart arm, broad chest, and well-rounded, vigorous muscles; but yet it may
come to adult age destitute of these physical excellences. Yet you will not say that the elements
did not exist in the child. They were there; but, being neglected, they followed a law of our
nature, that the development of a faculty depends upon its exercise. Nature will develop some
quality in every man; for our existence demands the exercise of a part of our faculties. The
faculty used will be developed in excess as compared with other faculties. It is the business
of the teacher to aid nature. For the most part, he must stimulate, encourage, draw out, develop,
though it may happen that he will be required occasionally to check a tendency which threatens
to absorb or overshadow all the others. He must, at any rate, prevent the growth of those powers
which tend towards the savage state.

While the teacher creates nothing, he must so draw out the qualities of the child that it may
attain to perfect manhood. He moulds, he renders symmetrical, the physical, the intellectual,
the moral man. Nature sometimes does this herself, as though she would occasionally furnish
a model man for our imitation, as she has given lines, and forms, and colors, which all artists
of all ages shall copy, but cannot equal. But, do the best we can, education is more or less
artificial; and hence the child of the school will suffer by comparison with the child of nature,
when she presents him in her best forms.

In a summer ramble I met a man so dignified as to attract the notice and command the respect
of all who knew him. I was with him upon the lakes and mountains several days and nights, and
never for a moment did the manliness of his character desert him. I have seen no other person
who could boast such physical beauty. Accustomed to a hunter's life; carrying often a pack
of thirty or forty or fifty pounds; sleeping upon the ground or a bed of boughs; able, if necessity
of interest demanded, to travel in the woods the ordinary distance which a good horse would
pass over upon our roads; with every organ of the arm, the leg, the trunk, fully expressed;
with a manly, kind, intelligent countenance, a beard uncut, in the vigor of early manhood,
he seemed a model which the statuaries of Greece and Rome desired to see, but did not. He had
at once the bearing of a soldier and the characteristics of a gentleman. He was ignorant of
grammatical rules and definitions, yet his conversation would have been accepted in good circles
of New England society. This man had his faults, but they were not grievous faults, nor did
they in any manner affect the qualities of which I have spoken.

This is what nature sometimes does; this is what we should always strive to do, extending this
symmetry, if possible, to the moral as well as to the intellectual and physical organization.
This man is ignorant of science, of books, of the world of letters, and the world of art, yet
we respect him. Why? Because nature has chosen to illustrate in him her own principles, power
and beauty.

That we may draw out the qualities of the human mind as they exist, we must first appreciate
our influence upon childhood and youth. Our own experience is the best evidence of what that
influence is. All along our lives the lessons of childhood return to us. The hills and valleys,
the lakes, rivers, and rivulets, of our early home, come not in clearer visions before us than
do the exhortations to industry, the incentives to progress, the lessons of learning, and the
principles of truth, uttered and offered by the teachers of early years. In the same way the
lines of the poet, the reflections of the philosopher, the calm truths of the historian, read
once and often carelessly, and for many years forgotten, return as voices of inspiration, and
are evermore with us.

That the teacher may have influence, his ear must be open to the voice of truth, and his mouth
must be liberal with words of consolation, encouragement, and advice. He rules in a little
world, and the scales of justice must be balanced evenly in his hands. He should go in and
out before his scholars free from partiality or prejudice; indifferent to the voice of envy
or detraction; shunning evil and emulous of good; patient of inquiries in the hours of duty;
filled with the spirit of industry in his moments of leisure; gathering up and spreading before
his pupils the choicest gems of literature, art, and science, that they may be early and truly
inspired with the love of learning.

The public school is a little world, and the teacher rules therein. It contains the rich and
the poor, the virtuous and the corrupt, the studious and the indifferent, the timid and the
brave, the fearful and the hearts elate with hope and courage. Life is there no cheat; it wears
no mask, it assumes no unnatural positions, but presents itself as it is. Deformed and repulsive
in some of its features, yet to him whose eye is as quick to discover its beauty as its deformity,
its harmony as its discord, there is always a bright spot on which he may gaze, and a fond
hope to which he may cling. Artificial life, whether in the select school or the select party,
tends to weaken our faith in humanity; and a want of faith in our race is an omen of ill-success
in life. Teachers should have faith in humanity, and should labor constantly to inspire others
with the belief that the true law of our nature is the law of progress.

Those who come early in life to the conclusion that the many cannot be moved by the higher
sentiments and ideas which control a few favored mortals, cease to labor for the advancement
of the race. They consequently lose their hold upon society, and society neglects them. For
such men there can be no success.

Others, like Jefferson and Channing, never lose confidence in their species, and their species
never lose confidence in them. When the teacher comes to believe that the world is worse than
it was, and never can be better, he need wait for no other evidence that his days of usefulness
are over.

The school-room will teach the child, even as the prison will instruct maturity and age, that
few persons are vicious in the extreme, and that no one lives without some ennobling traits
of character and life. The teacher's faith is the measure of the teacher's usefulness. It is
to him what conception is to the artist; and, if the sculptor can see the image of grace and
beauty in the fresh-quarried marble, so must the teacher see the full form of the coming man
in the trembling child or awkward youth.

The teacher ought not to grow old. To be sure, time will lay its hand on him, as it does on
others; but he should always cultivate in himself the feelings, sentiments, and even ambitions
of youth. Far enough removed from his pupils in age and position to stimulate them by his example,
and encourage them by his precepts, he should yet be so near them that he can appreciate the
steps and struggles which mark their progress in the path of learning. There must be some points
of contact, something common to teacher and pupils. Indeed, for us all it is true that age
loses nothing of its dignity or respect when it accepts the sentiments and sports of youth
and childhood. But above all should the teacher remember the common remark of La Place, in
his Celestial Mechanics, and the observation of Dr. Bowditch upon it. "Whenever I meet in La
Place with the words, 'Thus it plainly appears,' I am sure that hours, and perhaps days, of
hard study, will alone enable me to discover how it plainly appears." The good teacher will
seek first to estimate each scholar's capacity, and then adapt his instructions accordingly.
Though he may be far removed from his pupils in attainments, he should be able to mark the
steps by which ordinary minds pass from common principles to their noblest application.

This observation may by some be deemed unnecessary; but there are living teachers who, having
mastered the noblest sciences, are unable to appreciate and lead ordinary minds.

The teacher must be in earnest. This is the price of success in every profession. The law,
it is said, is a jealous mistress, and permits no rivals; the indifferent, careless minister
is but a blind leader of the blind, and the "undevout astronomer is mad."

Sincerity of soul and earnestness of purpose will achieve success. According to an eminent
authority, there are three kinds of great men: those who are born great, those who achieve
greatness, and those who have greatness thrust upon them. If we take greatness of birth to
be in greatness of soul and intellect, and not in the mere accident of ancestry, it is such
only who have greatness thrust upon them; for the world, after all, rarely makes a mistake
in this respect. But there is a larger and a nobler class, whose greatness, whatever it is,
must be achieved; and to this class I address myself.

Success is practicable. There need be no failures. A man of reflection will soon find whether
he can succeed in his pursuit; if not, he has mistaken his calling, or neglected the proper
means of success. In either case, a remedy is at hand. If a teacher is indifferent to his calling,
and cannot bring himself to pursue it with ardor, it is a duty to himself, to his profession,
to his pupils, to abandon it at once. It is idle to suppose that we are doing good in a work
to which we are not attracted by our sympathies, and in which we are not sustained by our faith
and hopes. The men who succeed are the men who believe that they can succeed. The men who fail
are those to whom success would have been a surprise. There is no doubt some appropriate pursuit
in life for every man of ordinary talents; but no one can tell whether he has found it for
himself until he has made a vigorous and persistent application of his powers. If the teacher
fail to do this, he need not seek for success in another profession, when he has already declined
to pay its price.

The choice of a profession is one of the great acts of life. It should not be done hastily,
nor without a careful examination and just appreciation of the elements of character. A competent
teacher may aid his pupils in this respect. A mistake in occupation is a calamity to the individual,
and an injury to the public.

Teachers are so situated that they may give wholesome advice; while parents--and I say it with
respect--are quite likely, under the influence of an instinctive belief that their children
are fitted for any place within the range of human labor or human ambition, to make fatal mistakes.
While all pursuits and professions, if honest, are equally honorable, the individual selection
must be determined by taste, circumstances, individual habits, and often by physical facts.
It is not for one person to do everything, but it is for each person to do at least one thing
well. As a general rule, the painter, who has spent his youth and manhood in studying the canvas,
had better not study the stars; and the artist, who has power to bring the form of life from
the cold marble, has no right to solve problems in geometry, weigh planets, or calculate eclipses.
The proper choice of the business of life may do much to perfect our social system, and it
will certainly advance our material prosperity. There is everywhere in our civilization mutual
dependence, and there must be mutual support. In no other way can we advance to our destiny
as becomes an enlightened people.

But all of life and education, either to pupil, teacher, or man, is not to be found in the
school-room. The common period of school-life is sufficient only for elementary education.
The average school-going period is ten years. Of this, one-half is spent in vacations and absences,
so that each child has about five years of school-life. Only one-fourth of each day is spent
in the school-room; and the continuous attendance, therefore, is about fifteen months, equal
to the time which most of us give to sleep, every four or five years of our existence. This
view leads me to say again that it is the duty of the teacher in this brief period to lay a
good foundation for subsequent scientific and classical culture. More than this cannot be accomplished;
and, where this is accomplished, and a taste for learning is formed, and the means to be employed
are comprehended, a satisfactory school-life has been passed.

Education--universal education--is a necessity; and, as there is no royal road to learning,
so there is no aristocracy of mental power depending upon social or pecuniary distinctions.
The New England colonies, and Massachusetts first of all, established the system of education
now called universal or public. It was not then easy to comprehend the principle which lies
at the foundation of a system of public instruction. We are first to consider that a system
of public instruction implies a system of universal taxation. The only rule on which taxes
can be levied justly is that the object sought is of public necessity, or manifest public convenience.
It quite often happens that men of our own generation are insensible or indifferent to the
true relation of the citizen to the cause of education. Some seem to imagine that their interest
in schools, and of course their moral obligation to support them, ceases with the education
of their own children. This is a great error. The public has no right to levy a tax for the
education of any particular child, or family of children; but its right of taxation commences
when the education or plan of education is universal, and ceases whenever the plan is limited,
or the operations of the system are circumscribed.

No man can be taxed properly because he has children of his own to educate; this may be a reason
with some for cheerful payment, but it has in itself no element of a just principle. When,
however, the people decide that education is a matter of public concern, then taxation for
its promotion rests upon the same foundation as the most important departments of a government.
Yet, many generations of men came and passed away before the doctrine was received that, as
a public matter, a man is equally interested in the education of his neighbor's children as
in the education of his own. As parents, we have a special interest in our children; as citizens,
it is this, that they may be honest, industrious, and effective in their labors. This interest
we have in all children.

The safety of our persons and property demands their honesty; our right to be exempt from pauper
and criminal taxes requires habits of universal industry; and our part in the general wealth
and prosperity is increased by the intelligent application of manual labor in all the walks
of life.

A man may, indeed, be proud of the attainments of his family, as men are often proud of their
ancestry; yet they possess little real value as a family possession.

I pass from this digression to the statement that the chief means of self-improvement are five:
Observation, Conversation, Reading, Memory, and Reflection.

It is an art to observe well--to go through the world with our eyes open--to see what is before
us. All men do not see alike, nor see the same things. Our powers of observation take on the
hues of daily life. The artist, in a strange city or foreign land, observes only the specimens
of taste and beauty or their opposites; the mechanic studies anew the principles of his science
as applied to the purposes of life; the architect transfers to his own mind the images of churches,
cathedrals, temples, and palaces; while the philanthropist rejoices in cellars and lanes, that
he may know how poverty and misery change the face and heart of man.

An American artist, following the lead of Mr. Jefferson, has beautifully illustrated the nature
of the power of observation. We do not see even the faces of our common friends alike. The
stranger observes a family likeness which is invisible to the familiar acquaintance. The former
sees only the few points of agreement, and decides upon them; while the latter has observed
and studied the more numerous points of difference, until he is blind to all others. Hence
a portrait may appear true to a stranger, which, to an intimate acquaintance, is barren in
expression, and destitute of character. Therefore, the artist wisely and properly esteemed
himself successful when his work was approved by the wife or the mother. The world around us
is full of knowledge. We should so behold it as to be instructed by all that is. The distant
star paints its image on our eye with a ray of light sent forth thousands of years ago; yet
its lesson is not of itself, but of the universe and its mysteries, and of the Creator out
of whose divine hand all things have come.

Conversation is at once an art, an accomplishment, and a science. It leads to valuable practical
results. It has a place, and by no means an inferior place, in the schools. Facts stated, questions
proposed, or theories illustrated, in conversation, are permanently impressed upon the mind.
It is in the power of the teacher to communicate much information in this way, and it is in
the power of us all to make conversation a means of improvement.

But, when the pupil leaves the school, reading, so systematic and thorough as to be called
study, is, no doubt, the best culture he can enjoy. In the first place, books are accessible
to all, and they may be had at all times. They can be used in moments of leisure, in solitude,
in the hours when sleep is too proud to wait on us, and when friends are absent or indifferent
to our lot. Conversation may be patronizing, or it may leave us a debtor; when the book-seller's
bill is settled, we have no account with the author.

If I am permitted to speak to all, pupils as well as teachers, I am inclined to say, "Do not
consider your education finished when you leave home and the school." Your labors of a practical
sort ought then to commence. With system and care, you may read works of literature and history,
or devote yourself to mathematics in the higher departments of science. As a general thing,
however, it is not wise to attempt too much at once. The custom of the schools is to require
each pupil to attend to several branches at the same time; but this course cannot be recommended
to adult persons with disciplined minds. It seems better to select one subject, and make it
the leading topic, for a time, of our studies and thoughts. It may also be proper to suggest
that works of fiction, poetry, and romance, ought not to be read until the mind is well disciplined,
and a good foundation of solid learning is laid. Such works tend to make one's style of thought
and writing easy, flowing, and agreeable; but they are also calculated to make us dissatisfied
with the more substantial labors of intellectual life. Having obtained the elements of learning,
one thing is absolutely essential--system in study. I fancy that there are two prevalent errors
among us. First, that men often attain intellectual eminence without study; and, secondly,
that exclusive devotion to books is the price of success. Whoever neglects study, whatever
his natural abilities, will find himself distanced by inferior men; and, on the other hand,
whoever will devote three hours each day to the systematic improvement of his mind will finally
be numbered among the leading persons of the age. But, while we observe, converse, and read,
the power of memory and the habit of reflection should be cultivated. The habit of reflection
is a great aid to the memory, and together they enable us to use the knowledge we daily acquire.

No previous age of the world has offered so great encouragement, whether in fame or money,
to men of science and literature, as the present. Formerly, authors flourished under the patronage
of princes, or withered by their neglect; but now they are encouraged and paid by the people,
and reap where they have sown, whether kings will or not. The poverty of authors was once proverbial;
but now the only authors who are poor are poor authors. Good learning, integrity, and ability,
are well compensated in all the professions. Some one remarked to Mr. Webster, "That the profession
of the law was crowded."--"Yes," said he, "rather crowded below, but there is plenty of room
above." Littleness and mediocrity always seek the paths worn by superior men; and the truly
illustrious in literature and science are few in number compared with those who attempt to
tread in the footsteps of their illustrious predecessors; but none of these things ought to
deter young men of ability, industry, and integrity, from boldly entering the lists, without
fear of failure. The world is usually just, and it will ultimately award the tokens of its
approbation to those who deserve success.

And there is a happy peculiarity in talent,--the variety is so great that the competition is
small. Of all the living authors, are there two so alike that they can be considered competitors
or rivals? The nation has applauded and set the seal of its approbation upon the eloquence
of Henry, Otis, Adams, Ames, Pinckney, Wirt, Calhoun, Clay, and Webster, not because these
men resembled one another, but because each had peculiarities and excellences of his own. The
same variety of excellence is seen in living orators, and in all the eloquence and learning
of antiquity which time has spared and history has transmitted to us. It is said that when
Aristides wrote the sentence of his own banishment for a humble and unknown enemy, the only
reason given by the peasant was that he was "tired with hearing him called the Just." And the
world sometimes appears to be restive under the influence of men of talent; but that influence,
whether always agreeable or not, is both permanent and beneficial.

Not only does each generation respect its own leading minds, but it is submissive to the learning
and intellect of other days. The influence of ancient Greece still remains. We copy her architecture,
borrow from her philosophy, admire her poetry, and bow with humility before the remnants of
her majestic literature. So the policy of Rome is perceptible in the civilization of every
European country, and it is a potent element in the laws and jurisprudence of America. The
eloquence of Demosthenes has been impressed upon every succeeding generation of civilized men;
the genius of Hannibal has stimulated the ambition of warriors from his own time to that of
Napoleon; while Shakspeare's power has been the wonder of all modern authors and readers. It
is a great representative fact in mental philosophy, which we cannot too much contemplate,
that Demosthenes and Cicero not only enchained the thousands of Greece and Rome in whose presence
they stood, but that their eloquence has had a controlling influence over myriads to whom the
language in which they spoke was unknown. The words that the houseless Homer sung in the streets
of Smyrna have commanded the admiration of all later times; and even the mud walls around Plato's
garden, on which are preserved the fragments of statuary with which the garden was once adorned,
attract and instruct the wanderers and students about Athens.

But let us not deceive ourselves with the idea that we can illustrate anew the greatness which
has distinguished a few men only in all the long centuries of the world's existence. Be not
imitators nor followers of other men's glory. There is a path for each one, and his duty lies
therein. Yet the leading men of the world are lights which ought not to be hid from the young,
for they serve to show the extent of the field in which human powers may be employed. The rule
of the successful life is to neglect no present opportunity of good either to yourself or to
others; and the rule of the successful student is to gather information from whatever source
he may, not doubting that it will prove useful to himself or to his fellow-men.

Our own age has furnished two men,--one living, the other dead,--quite opposite in talents
and attainments, whose power and influence may not have been surpassed in ancient or modern
times. I speak of Kossuth and Webster. Our history has no parallel for the first. Most men,
young or old, gay or severe, radical or conservative, were touched by his mournful strains,
and influenced by his magic words. He came from a land of which we knew little, and so laid
open the history of its wrongs that he enlisted multitudes in its behalf. I speak not now of
the views he presented, nor of the demands he made upon the American people. If he taught error
and asked wrong, so the more wonderful was his career. No doubt his cause did much for him;
but other patriots and exiles have had equal opportunities with Kossuth, yet no one has so
swayed the public mind.

He was distinguished in intellect, a master of much learning, a man of nice moral feeling and
strong religious sentiments, all of which were combined and blended in his addresses to the
people. But he spoke a language whose rudiments he first learned in manhood. In his speech
he neglected the chief rule of Grecian eloquence. With one theme, only,--the wrongs of Hungary;
with one object, only,--her relief and elevation,--he commanded the general attention of the
American mind. The mission of Kossuth in America deserves to be remembered as an intellectual
phenomenon, whose like, we of this generation may not again see.

Mr. Webster had never great personal popularity. His presence was majestic, but forbidding.
His manners were agreeable, and sometimes fascinating to his friends, when he was in a genial
mood; but he was often reserved or even austere to strangers, and terrible to his enemies.
His style of thought was mathematical, his language expressive, but never popular. He wrote
as a man would dictate an essay which was to appear as a posthumous work. His eloquence was
not that which often passes for eloquence upon the stump or at the bar. He seldom attempted
to court the people, and when he did, it was as if he mocked himself, and scorned the spirit
which could be moved by the breezes of popular favor. He was not free from faults, personal
and political; yet he acquired a control which has not been possessed by any man since Washington.
Whenever he was to speak, the public were anxious to hear and to read. Hardly any man has had
the fortune to present his views in addresses, letters, and speeches, to so large a portion
of his countrymen; yet the people whom he addressed, and who were anxious for his words and
opinions, did not always, or even generally, agree with him. Mr. Webster's power was chiefly,
if not solely, intellectual. He had not the personal qualities of Mr. Clay or General Jackson;
he was not, like Mr. Jefferson the chosen exponent of a political creed, and the admitted leader
of a great political party; nor had he the military character and universally acknowledged
patriotism of General Washington, which made him first in the hearts of his countrymen. Mr.
Webster stands alone. His domain is the intellect, and thus far in America he is without a rival.

Some humble measure of this greatness may be attained by all; and, if I have sought to lead
you in the way of improvement by considerations too purely personal and selfish, I will implore
you, in conclusion, as teachers and as citizens, to consider yourselves as the servants of
your country and your race. There can be no real greatness of mind without generosity of soul.
If a superior human intellect seems to be specially the gift of God, how is he wanting in true
religion who fails to dedicate it to humanity, justice, and virtue!

An eminent historian, seeing at one view, and as in the present moment, the fall of great states,
ancient and modern, and anticipating a like fate for his own beloved land, has predicted that
in two centuries there will be three hundred millions of people in North America speaking the
language of England, reading its authors, and glorying in their descent. If this be so, what
limits can we assign to the work, or how estimate the duty, of those intrusted with the education
of the young?

Who can say what share of responsibility for the future of America is upon the teachers of
the land?

LIBERTY AND LEARNING.

[An Address delivered at Montague, July 4th, 1857.]

I congratulate you upon the auspicious moments of this, the eighty-first anniversary of our
National Independence; and its return, now and ever, should be the occasion of gratitude to
the Author of all good, that He hath vouchsafed to our fathers and to their descendants the
wisdom to establish and the wisdom to preserve the institutions of Liberty in America.

And I congratulate you that you accept this anniversary as the occasion for considering the
subject of education. Ignorant and blind worshippers of Liberty can do but little for its support;
but, whatever of change or decay may come to our institutions, Liberty itself can never die
in the presence of a people universally and thoroughly educated. It is not, then, inappropriate
nor unphilosophical for us to connect Education and Liberty together; and I therefore propose,
after presenting some thoughts upon the Declaration of Independence, and its relations to the
American Union, to consider the value of political learning, its neglect, and the means by
which it may be promoted.

The events and epochs of life are logical in their nature, and are harmonious or inharmonious
as the affairs of men are controlled by principle, policy, or accident. Humboldt, Maury, and
Guyot, Arago, Agassiz, and Pierce, by observation, philosophy, and mathematics, demonstrate
the harmony of the physical creation. In the microscopic animalculæ; in the gigantic remains,
whether vegetable or animal, of other ages and conditions of life; in the coral reef and the
mountain range; in the hill-side rivulet that makes "the meadows green;" in the ocean current
that bathes and vivifies a continent; in the setting of the leaf upon its stem, and the moving
of Uranus in its orbit, they trace a law whose harmony is its glory, and whose mystery is the
evidence of its divinity.

National changes, the movements and progress of the human race, as a whole and in its parts,
are obedient, likewise, to law; and are, therefore, logical in their character, though generally
lacking in precision of connection and order of succession. Or it may be, rather, that we lack
power to trace the connection between events that depend in part, at least, upon the prejudices,
passions, vices, and weaknesses, of men. The development of the logic of human affairs waits
for a philosopher who shall study and comprehend the living millions of our race, as the philosophers
now study and comprehend the subjects of physical science. We have no guaranty that this can
ever be done. As mind is above matter, the mental philosopher enters upon the most varied and
difficult field of labor.

Keeping this fact in mind, it appears to be true that every person of observation, reading,
and reflection, is something of a mental philosopher, though much the larger number have no
knowledge of physical science. And especially must the student of history have a system of
mental philosophy; but often, no doubt, his system is too crude for general notice. Every historian
connects the events of his narrative by some thread of philosophy or speculation; every reader
observes some connection, though he may never develop it to himself, between the events and
changes of national and ethnological life; and even the observer whose vision is limited by
his own horizon in time and space marks a dependence, and speaks of cause and effect. All this
follows from the existence and nature of man. Man is not inert, nor even passive, merely; and
his activity will continually organize itself into facts and forms, ever changing in character,
it may be, yet subject to a law as wise and fixed as that of planetary motion.

The Independence of the British Colonies in America, declared on the 4th of July, 1776, is
not an isolated fact; nor is the Declaration itself a hasty and overwrought production of a
young and enthusiastic adventurer in the cause of liberty.

The passions and the reason of men connected the Declaration of Independence with the massacre
in King-street, of March 5th, 1770; with the passage and repeal of the Stamp Act; with the
attempt to enforce the Writs of Assistance; with the act to close the port of Boston; with
the peace of 1763; with the Act of Settlement of 1688; with the execution of Charles I., and
the Protectorate of Cromwell; with the death of Hampden; with the confederation of 1643; with
the royal charters granted to the respective colonies; with the compact made on board the Mayflower;
and, finally, and distinctly, and chiefly,--as the basis of the greatest legal argument of
modern times, made by the Massachusetts House of Representatives, from 1765 to 1775,--with
the events at Runnymede, and the grant of the Great Charter to the nobles and people of England
in 1215, which is itself based upon the concessions of Edward the Confessor, and the affirmation
of the Saxon laws in the eleventh century. Our Independence is, then, one logical fact or event
in a long succession, to the enumeration of which we may yet add the confederation of 1778,
the constitution of 1787, the French Revolution of 1789, the rapid increase of American territory
and States, the revolutionary spirit of continental Europe, the reforms in the British government
at home, the wise modifications of its colonial policy, and for us a long career of prosperity
based upon the cardinal doctrine of the equality of all men before the law.

Nor can any reader of the Declaration itself assume that it contains one statement, proposition,
idea, or word, not carefully considered, and carefully expressed. It was not the production
of hasty, thoughtless, or reckless men. The country had been gradually prepared for the great
event. States, counties, and towns, had made the most distinct expressions of opinion upon
the relations of the colonies to the mother country. On the twenty-fifth of June, a Declaration
of the Deputies of Pennsylvania, in favor of Independence, was read. On the twenty-eighth,
the credentials of the delegates from New Jersey, in which they were instructed to favor Independence,
were presented; and on the first of July similar instructions to the Maryland delegates were
laid before Congress. At this time Congress proceeded to consider the Declaration and resolution
reported by the committee. The Declaration was carefully considered, and materially amended
in committee of the whole, on the first, second, third, and fourth, when it was finally adopted.
It was then signed by the president and secretary, and copies were transmitted to the several
colonies. The order for its engrossment, and for the signature by every member, was not passed
until the nineteenth of July, and it was not really signed until the second of August following.
It is not likely, considering the circumstances, and the known character of the members of
Congress, among whom may be mentioned John Hancock, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Rush, Robert Morris,
Benjamin Harrison, Elbridge Gerry, John Witherspoon, a descendant of John Knox, the Scottish
Reformer, Charles Carroll, and Samuel Huntington,--all distinguished for coolness, probity,
and patriotism,--that the immortal document can contain one thought or word unworthy its sacred
associations, and the character of the American people!

And it is among the alarming symptoms of public sentiment that the Declaration of Independence
is by some publicly condemned, and by others quietly accepted as entitled to just the consideration,
and no more, that is given to an excited advocate's speech to a jury, or a demagogue's electioneering
harangue, or the daily contribution of the partisan editor to the stock of political capital
that aids the election of his favorite candidates. Would it not be wiser to test the government
we have, by a statesmanlike application of the principles of the Declaration of Independence
in the management of public affairs?

The Union is connected with the Declaration of Independence. The Union is an institution: the
Declaration of Independence is an assertion of rights, and an exposition of principles. When
principles are disregarded, institutions do not, for any considerable time, retain their original
value. And it would be the folly of other nations, without excuse in us, were we to worship
blindly any institution, whatever its origin or its history. I do not, myself, doubt the value
of the American Union. It was the necessity of the time when it was formed; it is the necessity
of the present moment; it was, indeed, the claim of our whole colonial life, and its recognition
could be postponed no longer when the colonies crossed the threshold of national existence.

For these exalted purposes the Constitution was framed, and the Union established; and the
Constitution and the Union will remain as long as these exalted purposes, with any considerable
share of fidelity, are secured. The Union will not be destroyed by declamation, nor can declamation
preserve it. Words have power only when they awaken a response in the minds of those who listen.
The Union will be judged, finally, by its merits; and they are not powerful enemies for evil
who attack it through the press and from the rostrum; but rather they who, clothed with authority,
brief or permanent, interpret the constitution so as to defeat the end for which it was framed.
Words are powerless, and enemies--envious, jealous, or deluded--are powerless, when they war
upon a system of government that secures such exalted results. And, if in these later days
of our national existence patriotism has been weakened, respect and reverence for the constitution
and the Union have been diminished, it is because the actual government under the constitution
has, in the judgment of many, failed to realize the government of the constitution.

But let no one despair of the Republic. Men are now building better than they know; possibly,
better than they wish. A great government, powerful in its justice, and therefore to be respected
and maintained, must also be powerful in its errors, prejudices, and wrongs, and therefore
to be changed and reformed in these respects. The declaration "that all men are created equal"
is vital, and will live in the presence of all governments, strong as well as weak, hostile
as well as friendly. It has no respect for worldly authority, so evidently is it a direct emanation
of the Divine Mind, and so does it harmonize with the highest manifestations of the nature
of man. But the Declaration of Independence does not, in this particular, assert that all men
are created equal in height or weight, equal in physical strength, intellectual power, or moral
worth. It is not dealing with these qualities at all, but with the natural political rights
and relations of men. In its view, all are born free from any political subordination to others
on account of the accidents or incidents of family or historic name. And hence it must, ere
long, be demonstrated by this country, under the light of Christianity, and in the presence
of the world, that man cannot have property in his fellow-man.

And, again, let no one despair of the Republic or of the Union; nor let any, with rash confidence,
believe that they are indestructible. They are human institutions built up through great sacrifices,
and by the exercise of a high order of worldly wisdom. But the government is not an end--it
is a means. The end is Liberty regulated by law; and the means will exist as long as the end
thereof is attained. But, should the time ever come when the institutions of the country fail
to secure the blessings of liberty to the living generation, and hold out no promise of better
things in the future, I know not that these institutions could longer exist, of that they ought
longer to exist. To be sure, the horizon is not always distinctly seen. The sky is not always
clear; there are dark spots upon the disk of Liberty, as upon the sun in the heavens; but,
like the sun, its presence is for all. And, whether there be night, or clouds, or distance,
its blessings can never be wholly withdrawn from the human race.

It is not to be concealed, however, that the affections of the people have been alienated from
the American Union during the last seven years, as they were from the union with Great Britain
during the years of our colonial life immediately previous to the Massacre in King-street,
in 1770. This solemn personal and public experience is fraught with a great lesson. It should
teach those who are intrusted with the administration of public affairs to translate the language
of the constitution into the stern realities of public policy, in the light of the Declaration
of Independence, and of Liberty; and it should warn those who constitute the government, and
who judge it, not to allow their opposition to men or to measures to degenerate into indifference
or hostility to the institutions of the country.

And, as there must be in every society of men something of evil that can be traced to the government,
and something of good neglected that a wise and efficient government might have accomplished,
it is easy to build up an argument against an existing government, however good when compared
with others. This is a narrow, superficial, unsatisfactory, dangerous view to take of public
affairs.

We should seek to comprehend the relations of the government, the principles on which it is
founded; and, while we justly complain of its defects, and seek to remedy them, we ought also
to compare it with other systems that exist, or that might be established. This proposition
involves an intelligent realization by the people of the character of their institutions; and
I am thus led to express the apprehension that the popular political education of our day is
inferior to that of the revolutionary era, and of the age that immediately succeeded it.

There is, no doubt, a disposition and a tendency to extol the recent past. The recollections
of childhood are quite at variance with the real truth, and tradition is often the dream of
old age concerning the events of early life. As rivers, hills, mountains, roads, and towns,
are all magnified by the visions of childhood, it is not strange that men should be also. Hence
comes, in part, the popular belief in the superior physical strength and greater longevity
of the people who lived fifty or a hundred years ago. Each generation is familiar with its
predecessor; but of the one next remote it knows only the marked characters. Those who possessed
great physical excellences remain; but they are not so much the representatives of their generation
as its exceptions. The weak, the diseased, have fallen by the way; and, as there is an intimate
connection between physical and intellectual power, the remnant of any generation, whatever
its common character, will retain a disproportionate number of strong-minded men. Hence it
is not safe to judge a generation as a whole by those who remain at the age of sixty or seventy
years; especially if we reflect that public opinion and tradition are most likely to preserve
the names and qualities of those who were distinguished for physical or mental power. Yet,
after making due allowance for these exaggerations, I cannot escape the conclusion that we
have, as a people, deteriorated in average sound political learning; and I proceed to mention
some of the causes and evidences of our degeneracy, and of the superiority of our ancestors.

I. The political condition of the country has been essentially changed.--General personal and
family comfort, according to the ideas now entertained, was not a feature of American society
for one hundred and seventy years from the settlement at Plymouth. Life was a continual contest--a
contest with the forest, with the climate, with the Indians, and especially was it a continual
contest with the mother country. The colonists sought to maintain their own rights without
infringement, while they accorded to the sovereign his constitutional privileges. Conflicts
were frequent, and apprehensions of conflict yet more frequent. Hence those who had the conduct
of public affairs were compelled to give some attention to English history, and to the constitutional
law of Great Britain. Moreover, it was always important to secure and keep a strong public
sentiment on the side of liberty; and there were usually in every town men who thoroughly investigated
questions of public policy. There was one topic, more absorbing than any other, that involved
the study of the legal history and usage of Great Britain, and a careful consideration of the
general principles of liberty; namely, the constitutional rights of a British subject. Here
was a broad field for inquiry, investigation, and study; and it was faithfully cultivated and
gleaned. There has never been a political topic for public discussion in America more important
in itself, or better calculated to educate an American in a knowledge of his political rights,
than the examination of the political relations of the subject to the crown and parliament
of Great Britain previous to the Declaration of Independence. It was not an abstraction. It
had a practical value to every man in the colonies, and it was the prominent feature of the
masterly exposition made by the Massachusetts House of Representatives, to which I have already
referred. And we can better estimate the political education which the times furnished, when
we consider that the revolutionary war was made logical and necessary through a knowledge of
positions, facts, and arguments, scattered over the history of the colonies. But, when our
Independence had been established and recognized, constitutions had been framed, and the governments
of the states and nation set in motion, the beauty and harmony of our political system seemed
to render continued attention to political principles and the rights of individual men unnecessary.
Hence, we may anticipate the judgment of impartial history in the admission that public attention
was gradually given to contests for office which did not always involve the maintenance of
a fundamental principle of government, or the recognition of an essential human right. It does
not, however, follow, from this admission, that we are indifferent to our political lot,--occasional
contests upon principle refute such a conjecture,--but that men are not anxious concerning
those things which appear to be secure. And the differences of political parties of the last
fifty years have not been so much concerning the nature of human rights, as in regard to the
institutions by which those rights can be best protected. Therefore our political questions
have been questions of expediency rather than of principle. And, if there is any foundation
for the popular impression that public offices are conferred on men less eminently qualified
to give dignity to public employments, the reason of this degeneracy--less noteworthy than
it is usually represented--is to be found in this connection.

Governments and political organizations accept the common law of society. When an individual
or a corporation is prosperous, places of trust and emolument are often gained and occupied
by unworthy men; but, when profits are diminished, or when they disappear entirely; when dividends
are passed, when loss and bankruptcy are imminent, then, if hope and courage still remain,
places of importance are filled by the appointment of abler and worthier men. The charge made
against official character, to whatever extent true, is better evidence of confidence and prosperity
than it is of the degeneracy of the people; and a public exigency, serious and long-continued,
would call to posts of responsibility the highest talent and integrity which the country could
produce. But it is, nevertheless, to be admitted as a necessary consequence of the facts already
stated, and the views presented, that the average amount of sound political learning among
those engaged in public employments is less than it was during the revolutionary era. It is,
however, also to be observed, that, when such learning seems to be specially required, the
people demand it and secure it. Hence the work of framing constitutions, even in the new states,
has, in its execution, commanded the approval of political writers in this country and in Europe.
And it must, also, be admitted that peace and prosperity render sound political learning and
great experience less necessary, and at the same time multiply the number of men who are considered
eligible to office. Candidates are put in nomination and elected because they have been good
neighbors, honorable citizens, competent teachers of youth, or faithful spiritual guides; or,
possibly, because they have been successful in business, are of the military or of the fire
department, or because they are leaders and benefactors of special classes of society. In ordinary
times these facts are all worthy of consideration and real deference; but when, as in the Revolution,
every place of public service is a post of responsibility, or sacrifice, or danger, candidates
and electors will not meet upon these grounds, but, disregarding such circumstances, the canvass
will have special reference to the work to be done. For civil employments, political learning
and experience are required; and for military posts, skill, sagacity, and courage. It may be
said that our whole colonial life was a preparatory school for the revolutionary contest; and,
therefore, the major part of the enterprise, ambition, and patriotism, of the country, was
given to the training, studies, and pursuits, calculated to fit men for so stern a struggle.
But now that other avenues are inviting in themselves, and promise political preferment, we
are liable to the criticism that our young men, well educated in the schools and in a knowledge
of the world, are not well grounded in political history and constitutional law, without which
there can be no thorough and comprehensive statesmanship. And, as I pass from this branch of
my subject, I may properly say that I do not seek to limit the number of candidates for public
office; for every office is a school, and the public itself is a great and wise teacher. Nor
do I ask any to abandon the employments and duties, or to neglect the claims of business and
of social life; but I seek to impress upon our youth a sense of the importance of adding something
thereto. The knowledge of which I have spoken is valuable in the ordinary course of public
business, and absolutely essential in the exigences of political and national life. And it
is with an eye single to the happiness of individuals, and the welfare of the public, that
I invite my fellow-citizens, and especially the young men of the state, to take something from
the hours of labor, where labor is excessive; or something from amusement, where amusement
has ceased to be recreation; or something from light reading, which often is neither true,
nor reasonable, nor useful; or something from indolence and dissipation; and, in the minutes
and hours thus gained, treasure up valuable knowledge for the circumstances and exigences of
citizenship and public office.

II. The claims of business and society are unfavorable to political learning.--I assume it
to be true of Massachusetts that the proportion of freehold farmers to the whole population
is gradually diminishing, and that the amount of labor performed by each is gradually increasing.
From the settlement of the country to the commencement of the present century, there was a
great deal of privation, hardship, and positive suffering; but the claim for continuous labor
was not exacting.

The necessary articles of food and clothing were chiefly supplied from the land, and the majority
did not contemplate any great accumulation of worldly goods, but sought rather to place their
political and religious privileges upon a sure foundation. Agriculture was in a rude state,
and consequently did not furnish steady employment to those engaged in it. It is only when
there are valuable markets, scientific, or at least careful cultivation, and large profits,
that the farmer can use his evenings and long winters in his profession. These circumstances
did not exist until the present century; and we have thus in this discussion found both the
motive and the opportunity for political learning among our ancestors.

It is also possible that the increased activity of business and business men is unfavorable
to those studies and thoughts that are essential to political learning. Commerce and trade
are stimulated by never-ceasing competition; and manufacturers are not free from the influence
of markets, and the necessity of variety, taste, and skill, in the management of their business.
If the larger share of the physical and mental vigor of a man is given to business, his hours
of leisure must be hours of relaxation; and to most minds the study of history and of kindred
topics is by no means equivalent to recreation. Moreover, society presents numerous claims
which are not easily disregarded. Fashionable life puts questions that but few people have
the courage to answer in the negative. Have you read the last novel? the new play? the reviews
of the quarter? the magazines of the month? or the greatest satire of the age? These questions
have puzzled many young men into customary neglect of useful reading, that they may not admit
their ignorance in the presence of those whom they respect or admire.

But, everything valuable is expensive, and learning can be secured only by severe self-sacrifice.
With our ancestors, after religious culture, historical and political reading was next immediately
before them; but the youth of this generation who seek such learning are compelled to make
their way without deference to the daily customs of society. There is no fashionable or tolerated
society that invites young men to read the history of England prior to the time when Macaulay
begins. Nor does public sentiment recommend De Lolme on the British constitution, the Federalist,
the writings of Jefferson, Madison, Marshall, Story, and Webster, upon the constitution of
the United States, and the practice of the government under it. Not but that these topics are
considered in the higher institutions of learning; but I address myself to those who have enjoyed
the advantages of our common schools only, where thorough instruction in national and general
political history cannot be given. This kind of learning must be self-acquired, and acquired
by some temporary sacrifice; and the sooner, in the case of every young man, this sacrifice
is contemplated and offered, the more acceptable and useful it will be. And the acquisition
of this kind of learning does not, in a majority of cases, admit of delay. It should be the
work of youth and early manhood. The duties of life are so constant and pressing that we find
it difficult to abstract ourselves and our thoughts from the world; but, from the age of sixteen
to the age of twenty-five, the attention may be concentrated upon special subjects, and their
elements mastered.

By the Athenian law, minority terminated at the age of sixteen years; and Demosthenes, at that
period of his life, commenced a course of self-education by which he became the first orator
of Athens, and the admiration of the after-world. The father of Demosthenes died worth fourteen
talents; and the son, though defrauded by his guardians, was, as his father had been, enrolled
in the wealthiest class of citizens; yet he did not hesitate to subject himself to the severest
mental and physical discipline, in preparation for the great life he was to lead.

"Demosthenes received, during his youth, the ordinary grammatical and rhetorical education
of a wealthy Athenian.... It appears also that he was, from childhood, of sickly constitution
and feeble muscular frame; so that, partly from his own disinclination, partly from the solicitude
of his mother, he took little part, as boy or youth, in the exercises of the palæstra.... Such
comparative bodily disability probably contributed to incite his thirst for mental and rhetorical
acquisitions, as the only road to celebrity open. But it at the same time disqualified him
from appropriating to himself the full range of a comprehensive Grecian education, as conceived
by Plato, Isokrates, and Aristotle; an education applying alike to thought, word, and action--combining
bodily strength, endurance, and fearlessness, with an enlarged mental capacity, and a power
of making it felt by speech.

"The disproportion between the physical energy and the mental force of Demosthenes, beginning
in childhood, is recorded and lamented in the inscription placed on his statue after his death....
Demosthenes put himself under the teaching of Isæus; ... and also profited largely by the discourse
of Plato, of Isokrates, and others. As an ardent aspirant, he would seek instruction from most
of the best sources, theoretical as well as practical--writers as well as lecturers. But, besides
living teachers, there was one of the last generation who contributed largely to his improvement.
He studied Thucydides with indefatigable labor and attention; according to one account, he
copied the whole history eight times over with his own hand; according to another, he learnt
it all by heart, so as to be able to rewrite it from memory, when the manuscript was accidentally
destroyed. Without minutely criticizing these details, we ascertain, at least, that Thucydides
was the peculiar object of his study and imitation. How much the composition of Demosthenes
was fashioned by the reading of Thucydides, reproducing the daring, majestic, and impressive
phraseology, yet without the overstrained brevity and involutions of that great historian,--and
contriving to blend with it a perspicuity and grace not inferior to Lysias,--may be seen illustrated
in the elaborate criticism of the rhetor Dionysius.

"While thus striking out for himself a bold and original style, Demosthenes had still greater
difficulties to overcome in regard to the external requisites of an orator. He was not endowed
by nature, like Æschines, with a magnificent voice; nor, like Demades, with a ready flow of
vehement improvisation. His thoughts required to be put together by careful preparation; his
voice was bad, and even lisping; his breath short; his gesticulation ungraceful; moreover,
he was overawed and embarrassed by the manifestations of the multitude.... The energy and success
with which Demosthenes overcame his defects, in such manner as to satisfy a critical assembly
like the Athenians, is one of the most memorable circumstances in the general history of self-education.
Repeated humiliation and repulse only spurred him on to fresh solitary efforts for improvement.

But how can the youth of this age hope to be followers, even at a distance, of Demosthenes,
and of those his peers, who, by eloquence, poetry, art, science, and general learning, have
added dignity to the race, and given lustre to generations separated by oceans and centuries,
unless they are animated by a spirit of progress, and cheered by a faith that shall be manifested
in the disposition and the power to overcome the obstacles that lie in every one's path?

Such a course of training requires individual effort and personal self-sacrifice. It would
not be wise to follow the plan of the Athenian orator; he adapted his training to his personal
circumstances, and the customs of the country. His history is chiefly valuable for the lessons
of self-reliance, and the example of perseverance under discouragements, that it furnishes.

III. The popular reading of the day does not contribute essentially to the education of the
citizen and statesman.--It is not, of course, expected that every man is to qualify himself
for the life of a statesman; but it does seem necessary for all to be so well instructed in
political learning as to possess the means of forming a reasonable and philosophical opinion
of the policy of the government. It is as discreditable to the intellect and judgment of a
free people to complain of that which is right in itself, and rests upon established principles
of right, as to submit without resistance or murmur to usurpation or misgovernment. I do not
mean to undervalue the periodical press; but it must always assume something in regard to its
readers, and in politics it must assume that the principles of government and the history of
national institutions are known and understood.

But the young man should subject himself to a systematic course of training; and I know of
nothing more valuable in political studies than a thorough acquaintance with English history.
Our principles of government were derived from England; and it is in the history of the mother
country that the best discussion of principles is found, as in that country many of the contests
for liberty occurred. But, as our government is the outgrowth rather than a copy of British
principles and institutions, the American citizen is not prepared for his duties until he has
made himself familiar with American history, in all its departments. How ill-suited, then,
for the duties of citizenship and public life, in the formation of taste and habits of thought,
is much of the reading of the present time! And I may here call attention to the fact that
each town in Massachusetts is invested with authority to establish a public library by taxation.
This, it seems to me, is one of the most important legislative acts of the present decennial
period; and, indeed, a public library is essential to the view I am taking of the necessity
and importance of political education. Private libraries exist, but they are not found in every
house, nor can every person enjoy their advantages. Public libraries are open to all; and,
when the selection of books is judicious, they furnish opportunities for education hardly less
to be prized than the common schools themselves. The public library is not only an aid to general
learning, a contributor to political intelligence and power, but it is an efficient supporter
of sound morals, and all good neighborhood among men.

If the public will not offer to its youth valuable reading, such as its experience, its wisdom,
its knowledge of the claims of society, its morality may select, shall the public complain
if its young men and women are tempted by frivolous and pernicious mental occupations? It is,
moreover, the duty of the public to furnish the means of self-education, especially in the
science of government; and political learning, for the most part, must be gained after the
school-going period of life has passed.

Let American liberty be an intelligent liberty, and therefore a self-sustaining liberty. Freedom,
more or less complete, has been found in two conditions of life. Man, in a rude state, where
his condition seemed to be normal, rather than the result of a process of mental and moral
degeneracy, has often possessed a large share of independence; but this should by no means
be confounded with what in America is called liberty. The independence of the savage, or nomad,
is manifested in the absence of law; but the liberty of an American citizen is the power to
do whatever may be beneficial to himself, and not injurious to his neighbor nor to the state.
The first leaves self-protection and self-regulation to the individual, while the latter restrains
the aggressive tendencies of all for the security of each. The first is natural equality without
law; the second is natural equality before the law. With the first, might makes right; with
the latter, right makes might. With the first, the power of the law, or of the will of an individual
or clan, is in the rigor and success of execution; with the latter, the power of the law is
in the justice of its demand. We, as a people, have passed the savage and nomadic state, and
can return to it only after a long and melancholy process of decay and change, out of which
ultimately might come a new and savage race of men. This, then, is not our immediate, even
if it be a possible danger. But we are to guard against intellectual, political, and moral
degeneracy. We are, through family, religious, and public education, to take security of the
childhood and youth of the land for the preservation of the institutions we have, and for the
growth, greatness, and justice, of the republic. Liberty in America, if you will admit the
distinction, is a growth and not a creation. The institutions of liberty in America have the
same character. By many centuries of trial, struggle, and contest, through many years of experience,
sometimes joyous, and sometimes sad, the fact and the institutions of liberty in America have
been evolved. It has not been a work of destruction and creation, but a process of change and
progress. And so it must ever be. Reformation does not often follow destruction; and they who
seek to destroy the institutions of a country are not its friends in fact, however they may
be in purpose. Ignorance can destroy, but intelligence is required to reform or build up. Let
the prejudice against learning, not common now, but possibly existing in some minds, be forever
banished. Learning is the friend of liberty. Of this America has had evidence in her own history,
and in her observation of the experience of others. The literary institutions and the cultivated
men of America, like Milton and Hampden in England, preferred

     "Hard liberty before the easy yoke
     Of servile pomp."

It was the intelligence of the country that everywhere uttered and everywhere accepted the
declaration of the town of Boston, in the revolutionary struggle, "We can endure poverty, but
we disdain slavery." Ignorance is quicksand on which no stable political structure can be built;
and I predict the future greatness of our beloved state, in those historical qualities that
outlast the ages, from the fact that she is not tempted by her extent of territory, salubrity
of climate, fertility of soil, or by the presence and promise of any natural source of wealth,
to falter in her devotion to learning and liberty. And I anticipate for Massachusetts a career
of influence beneficial to all, whether disputed or accepted, when I reflect that, with less
good fortune in the presence and combination of learning and liberty, Greece, Rome, Venice,
Holland, and England, enjoyed power disproportionate to their respective populations, territory,
and natural resources. And, while the object for which we are convened may pardon something
to local attachments and state pride, the day and the occasion ought not to pass without a
grateful and hearty acknowledgment of the interest manifested by other states and sections
in the cause of general learning, and especially in common-school education. The Canadas are
our rivals; the states of the West are our rivals; the states of the South are our rivals;
and, were our greater experience and better opportunities reckoned against us, I know not that
there would be much in our systems of education of which we could properly boast. It is, indeed,
possible that North Carolina, untoward circumstances having their due weight, has made more
progress in education, since 1840, than any other state of the Union.

Education is not only favorable to liberty, but, when associated with liberty, it is the basis
of the Union and power of the American states. As citizens of the republic, we need a better
knowledge of our national institutions, a better knowledge of the institutions of the several
states, a more intimate acquaintance with one another, and the power of judging wisely and
justly the policies and measures of each and all. These ends, aided or accomplished by general
learning, will so strengthen the Union as no force of armies can--will so strengthen the Union
as that by no force of armies can it be overthrown.

MASSACHUSETTS SCHOOL FUND.

[Extract from the Twenty-Second Annual Report of the Secretary of the Board of Education.]

The Massachusetts School Fund was established by the Legislature of 1834 (stat. 1834, chap.
169), and it was provided by the act that all moneys in the treasury on the first of January,
1835, derived from the sale of lands in the State of Maine, and from the claim of the state
on the government of the United States for military services, and not otherwise appropriated,
together with fifty per centum of all moneys thereafter to be received from the sale of lands
in Maine, should be appropriated to constitute a permanent fund, for the aid and encouragement
of Common Schools. It was provided that the fund should never exceed one million of dollars,
and that the income only should be appropriated to the object in view. The mode of distribution
was referred to a subsequent Legislature. It was, however, provided that a greater sum should
never be paid to any city or town than was raised therein for the support of common schools.
There are two points in the law that deserve consideration. First, the object of the fund was
the aid and encouragement of the schools, and not their support; and secondly, the limit of
appropriation to the respective towns was the amount raised by each. There is an apparent inconsistency
in this restriction when it is considered that the income of the entire fund would have been
equal to only forty-three cents for each child in the state between the ages of five and fifteen
years, and that each town raised, annually, by taxation, a larger sum; but this inconsistency
is to be explained by the fact that the public sentiment, as indicated by resolves reported
by the same committee for the appointment of commissioners on the subject, tended to a distribution
of money among the towns according to their educational wants.

As early as 1828, the Committee on Education of the House of Representatives, in a Report made
by Hon. W. B. Calhoun, declared, "That means should be devised for the establishment of a fund
having in view not the support, but the encouragement, of the common schools, and the instruction
of school teachers." This report was made in the month of January, and in February following
the same committee say: "The establishment of a fund should look to the support of an institution
for the instruction of school teachers in each county in the commonwealth, and to the distribution,
annually, to all the towns, of such a sum for the benefit of the schools as shall simply operate
as an encouragement to proportionate efforts on the part of the towns. A fund which should
be so large as to suffice for the support of the whole school establishment of the state, as
is the case in Connecticut, would, in the opinion of the committee, be rather detrimental than
advantageous; it would only serve to draw off from the mass of the community that animating
interest which will ever be found indispensable where a resolute feeling upon the subject is
wished for or expected. Such a result is, in every sense, to be deprecated, and whatever may
tend to it, even remotely, should be anxiously avoided. A fund which should admit of the distribution
of one thousand dollars to any town which should raise three thousand dollars, in any manner
within itself, or in that proportion, would operate as a strong incentive to high efforts;
and, if to this should be added the further requisition of a faithful return to the Legislature,
annually, of the condition of the schools, the consequences could not be otherwise than decidedly
favorable." This report was accompanied by a bill "for the establishment of the Massachusetts
Literary Fund." The bill followed the report in regard to the proportionate amount of the income
of the fund to be distributed to the several towns. This bill failed to become a law.

In January, 1833, the House of Representatives, under an order introduced by Mr. Marsh, of
Dalton, appointed a committee "to consider the expediency of investing a portion of the proceeds
of the sales of the lands of this commonwealth in a permanent fund, the interest of which should
be annually applied, as the Legislature should from time to time direct, for the encouragement
of common schools." The adoption of this order was the incipient measure that led to the establishment
of the Massachusetts School Fund. On the twenty-third of the same month, Mr. Marsh submitted
the report of the committee. The committee acted upon the expectation that all moneys then
in the treasury derived from the sale of public lands, and the entire proceeds of all subsequent
sales, were to be set apart as a fund for the encouragement of common schools; but, as blanks
were left in the bill reported, they seem not to have been sanguine of the liberality of the
Legislature. The cash and notes on hand amounted to $234,418.32, and three and a half millions
of acres of land unsold amounted, at the estimated price of forty cents per acre, to $1,400,000
more; making together a fund with a capital of $1,634,418.32. The income was estimated at $98,065.09.
It was also stated that there were 140,000 children in the state between the ages of five and
fifteen years, and it was therefore expected that the income of the fund would permit a distribution
to the towns of seventy cents for each child between the afore-named ages. This certainly was
a liberal expectation, compared with the results that have been attained. The distributive
share of each child has amounted to only about one-third of the sum then contemplated. The
committee were careful to say, "It is not intended, in establishing a school fund, to relieve
towns and parents from the principal expense of education; but to manifest our interest in,
and to give direction, energy, and stability to, institutions essential to individual happiness
and the public welfare." In conclusion, the committee make the following inquiries and suggestions:

"Should not our common schools be brought nearer to their constitutional guardians? Shall we
not adopt measures which shall bind, in grateful alliance, the youth to the governors of the
commonwealth? We consider the application, annually, of the interest of the proposed fund,
as the establishment of a direct communication betwixt the Legislature and the schools; as
each representative can carry home the bounty of the government, and bring back from the schools
returns of gratitude and proficiency. They will then cheerfully render all such information
as the Legislature may desire. A new spirit would animate the community, from which we might
hope the most happy results. This endowment would give the schools consequence and character,
and would correct and elevate the standard of education.

"Therefore, to preserve the purity, extend the usefulness, and perpetuate the benefits of intelligence,
we recommend that a fund be constituted, and the distribution of the income so ordered as to
open a direct and more certain intercourse with the schools; believing that by this measure
their wants would be better understood and supplied, the advantages of education more highly
appreciated and improved, and the blessings of wisdom, virtue, and knowledge, carried home
to the fireside of every family, to the bosom of every child." The bill reported by this committee
was read twice, and then, upon Mr. Marsh's motion, referred to the next Legislature.

In 1834, the bill from the files of the last General Court to establish the Massachusetts School
Fund, and so much of the petition of the inhabitants of Seekonk as related to the same subject,
were referred to the Committee on Education.

In the month of February, Hon. A. D. Foster, of Worcester, chairman of the committee, made
a report, and submitted a bill which was the basis of the law of March 31, 1834. The committee
were sensible of the importance of establishing a fund for the encouragement of the common
schools. These institutions were languishing for support, and in a great degree destitute of
the public sympathy. There were no means of communication between the government and the schools,
and in some sections towns and districts had set themselves resolutely against all interference
by the state. In 1832, an effort was made to ascertain the amount raised for the support of
schools. Returns were received from only ninety-nine towns, showing an annual average expenditure
of one dollar and ninety-eight cents for each pupil.

The interest in this subject does not seem to have been confined to the Legislature, nor even
to have originated there. The report of the committee contains an extract from a communication
made by Rev. William C. Woodbridge, then editor of the American Annals of Education and Instruction.
His views were adopted by the committee, and they corresponded with those which have been already
quoted. The dangers of a large fund were presented, and the example of Connecticut, and some
states of the West, where school funds had diminished rather than increased the public interest
in education, was tendered as a warning against a too liberal appropriation of public money.
On the other hand, Mr. Woodbridge claimed that the establishment of a fund which should encourage
efforts rather than supply all wants, and, without sustaining the schools, give aid to the
people in proportion to their own contributions, was a measure indispensable to the cause of
education. He also referred to the experience of New Jersey, which had made a general appropriation
to be paid to those towns that should contribute for the support of their own schools; but,
such was the public indifference, that after many years the money was still in the treasury.
Hence it was inferred that all these measures were ineffectual, and that mere taxation was,
upon the whole, to be preferred to any imperfect system. But the example of New York was approved,
where the distribution of a small sum, equal to about twenty cents for each pupil, had increased
the public interest, and wrought what then seemed to be an effectual and permanent revolution
in educational affairs. These facts and reasonings, say the committee, seem to be important
and sound, and to result in this,--that no provision ought to be made which shall diminish
the present amount of money raised by taxes for the schools, or the interest felt by the people
in their prosperity; that a fund may be so used as satisfactorily to increase both--and that
further information in regard to our schools is requisite to determine the best mode of doing
this. These opinions are supported generally by the judgment of the present generation. Yet
it is to be remarked, by way of partial dissent, that the public apathy in Connecticut and
the states of the West was not in a great degree the effect of the funds, but was rather a
coëxisting, independent fact. It ought not, therefore, to have been expected that the mere
offer of money for educational purposes, while the people had no just idea of the importance
of education or of the means by which it could be acquired, would lead them even to accept
the proffered boon; and it certainly, in their judgment, furnished no reason for self-taxation.
It is, however, no doubt true that the power of local taxation for the support of schools is
in its exercise a means of provoking interest in education; and it is reasonable to assume
that a public system of instruction will never be vigorous and efficient at all times and under
all circumstances where the right of local taxation does not exist or is not exercised. When
the entire expenditure is derived from the income of public funds, or obtained by a universal
tax, and the proceeds distributed among the towns, parishes, or districts, there will often
be general conditions of public sentiment unfavorable, if not hostile, to schools; and, there
will always be found in any state, however small, local indifference and lethargy which render
all gifts, donations, and distributions, comparatively valueless. The subject of self-taxation
annually is important in connection with a system of free education. It is the experience of
the states of this country that the people themselves are more generous in the use of this
power than are their representatives; and it is also true that when the power has been exercised
by the people, there is usually more interest awakened in regard to modes of expenditure, and
more zeal manifested in securing adequate returns. The private conversations and public debates
often arouse an interest which would never have been manifested had the means of education
been furnished by a fund, or been distributed as the proceeds of a general tax assessed by
the government of the state.

I have no doubt that much of our success is due to the fact that in all the towns the question
of taxation is annually submitted to the people. It is quite certain that the sum of our municipal
appropriations never could have been increased from $387,124.17, in 1837, to $1,341,252.03,
in 1858, without the influence of the statistical tables that are appended to the Annual Reports
of the Board of Education; and it is also true that the materials for these tables could not
have been secured without the agency of the school fund. Our experience as a state confirms
the wisdom of the reports of 1833 and 1834; and I unreservedly concur in the opinion that a
fund ought not to be sufficient for the support of schools, but that such a fund is needed
to give encouragement to the towns, to stimulate the people to make adequate local appropriations,
to secure accurate and complete returns from the committees, and finally to provide means for
training teachers, and for defraying the necessary expenses of the educational department.
The law of 1834, establishing the school fund, was reënacted in the Revised Statutes (chap.
11, sects. 13 and 14). The Revised Statutes (chap. 23, sects. 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, and 67) also
required that returns should be made, each year, from all the towns of the commonwealth, of
the condition of the schools in various important particulars. The income of the fund was to
be apportioned among the towns that had raised, the preceding year, the sum of one dollar by
taxation for each pupil, and had complied with the laws in other respects; and it was to be
distributed according to the number of persons in each between the ages of four and sixteen
years. These provisions have since been frequently and variously modified; but at all times
the state has imposed similar conditions upon the towns. By the statute of 1839, chapter 56,
the income of the school fund was to be apportioned among those towns that had raised by taxation
for the support of schools the sum of one dollar and twenty-five cents for each person between
the ages of four and sixteen years; and, by the law of 1849, chapter 117, the income was to
be apportioned among those towns which had raised by taxation the sum of one dollar and fifty
cents for the education of each person between the ages of five and fifteen years. This provision
is now in force. By an act of the Legislature, passed April 15th, 1846, it was provided that
all sums of money which should thereafter be drawn from the treasury, for educational purposes,
should be considered as a charge upon the moiety of the proceeds of the sales of the public
lands set apart for the purpose of constituting a school fund. This provision continued in
force until the reörganization of the fund, in 1854. By the law of that year (chap. 300), it
was provided that one half of the annual income of the fund should be apportioned and distributed
among the towns according to the then existing provisions of law, and that the educational
expenses before referred to should be chargeable to and paid from the other half of the income
of said fund. These provisions are now in force.

The limitation of the act of 1834, establishing the fund, and of the Revised Statutes, was
removed by the law of 1851, chapter 112, and the amount of the fund was then fixed at one million
and five hundred thousand dollars. By the act of 1854 the principal was limited to two millions
of dollars. The Constitutional Convention of 1853 had, with great unanimity, declared it to
be the duty of the Legislature to provide for the increase of the school fund to the sum of
two millions of dollars; and, though the proposed constitution was rejected by the people,
the provision concerning the fund was generally, if not universally, acceptable. Under these
circumstances, the legislature of 1854 may be said to have acted in conformity to the known
opinion and purpose of the state.

On the 1st of June, 1858, the principal of the fund was $1,522,898.41, including the sum of
$1,843.68, added during the year preceding that date. In this statement no notice is taken
of the rights of the school fund in the Western Railroad Loan Sinking Fund.

It may be observed that the committee of 1833 contemplated the establishment of a fund, with
a capital of $1,634,418.32, and yet, after twenty-five years, the Massachusetts School Fund
amounts to only $1,522,898.41. Its present means of increase are limited to the excess of one-half
of the annual income over the current educational expenses. The increase for the year 1856-7
was $4,142.90; and for the year 1857-8, $1,843.68. With this resource only, and at this rate
of increase, about one hundred and sixty years will be required for the augmentation of the
capital to the maximum contemplated by existing laws. But the educational wants of the state
are such that even this scanty supply must soon cease. It is then due to the magnitude of the
proposition for the considerable and speedy increase of the school fund, that its necessity,
if possible, or its utility, at least, should be satisfactorily demonstrated; and it is for
this purpose that I have already presented a brief sketch of its history in connection with
the legislation of the commonwealth, and that I now proceed to set forth its relations to the
practical work of public instruction.

When the fund was instituted, public sentiment in regard to education was lethargic, if not
retrograding. The mere fact of the action of the Legislature lent new importance to the cause
of learning, inspired its advocates with additional zeal, gave efficiency to previous and subsequent
legislation, and, as though there had been a new creation, evoked order out of chaos.

Previous to 1834 there was no trustworthy information concerning the schools of the state.
The law of 1826, chapter 143, section 8, required each town to make a report to the Secretary
of the Commonwealth, of the amount of money paid, the number of schools, the aggregate number
of months that the schools of each city and town were kept, the number of male and female teachers,
the whole number of pupils, the number of private schools and academies and the number of pupils
therein, the amount of compensation paid to the instructors of private schools and academies,
and the number of persons between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one years who were unable
to read and write. The Legislature did not provide a penalty for neglect of this provision,
nor does there seem to have been any just method of compelling obedience. The Secretary of
the Commonwealth sent out blank forms of returns, and replies were received from two hundred
and fourteen towns, while eighty-eight were entirely silent.

The returns received furnish a series of interesting facts for the year 1826. There were one
thousand seven hundred and twenty-six district schools, supported at an expense of two hundred
and twenty-six thousand two hundred and nineteen dollars and ninety cents ($226,219.90), while
there were nine hundred and fifty-three academies and private schools maintained at a cost
of $192,455.10. The whole number of children attending public schools was 117,186, and the
number educated in private schools and academies was 25,083. The expense, therefore, was $7.67
per pupil in the private schools, and only $1.93 each in the public schools. These facts are
indicative of the condition of public sentiment. About one-sixth of the children of the state
were educated in academies and private schools, at a cost equal to about six-sevenths of the
amount paid for the education of the remaining five-sixths, who attended the public schools.
The returns also showed that there were 2,974 children between the ages of seven and fourteen
years who did not attend school, and 530 persons over fourteen years of age who were unable
to read and write. The incompleteness of these returns detracts from their value; but, as those
towns where the greatest interest existed were more likely to respond to the call of the Legislature,
it is probable that the actual condition of the whole state was below that of the two hundred
and eighty-eight towns. The interest which the law of 1826 had called forth was temporary;
and in March, 1832, the Committee on Education, to whom was referred an order with instructions
to inquire into the expediency of providing a fund to furnish, in certain cases, common schools
with apparatus, books, and such other aid as may be necessary to raise the standard of common
school education, say that they desire more accurate knowledge than could then be obtained.
The returns required by law were in many cases wholly neglected, and in others they were inaccurately
made. In the year 1831 returns were received from only eighty-six towns. In order to obtain
the desired information, a special movement was made by the Legislature. The report of the
committee was printed in all the newspapers that published the laws of the commonwealth, and
the Secretary was directed to prepare and present to the Legislature an abstract of the returns
which should be received from the several towns for the year 1832. The result of this extraordinary
effort was seen in returns from only ninety-nine of three hundred and five towns, and even
a large part of these were confessedly inaccurate or incomplete. They present, however, some
remarkable facts.

The following table, prepared from the returns of 1832, shows the relative standing and cost
of public and private schools in a part of the principal towns. It appears that the towns named
in the table were educating rather more than two-thirds of their children in the public schools,
at an expense of $2.88 each, and nearly one-third in private schools, at a cost of $12.70 each,
and that the total expenditure for public instruction was about thirty-six per cent. of the
outlay for educational purposes.

The evidence is sufficient that the public schools were in a deplorable and apparently hopeless
condition.

The change that has been effected in the eighteen towns named may be seen by comparing the
following table with the one already given. In 1832, 64 per cent. of the amount paid for education
was expended in academies and private schools, while in 1858 only 24 per cent. was so expended.
In the same period the amount raised for public schools increased from less than thirty-seven
thousand dollars to more than two hundred and fifty-nine thousand dollars. At the first period,
the attendance of pupils upon academies and private schools was nearly 30 per cent. of the
whole number, while in 1858 it was only 8 per cent. The private schools of some of these towns
were established recently, and are sustained in a degree by pupils who are not inhabitants
of the state, but who have come among us for the purpose of enjoying the culture which our
teachers and schools, private as well as public, are able to furnish. If, as seems probable,
the number of foreign pupils was less in 1832 than in 1858, the decrease of pupils in private
schools would be greater than is indicated by the tables. The cost of education, as it appears
by this table, is rather more than thirty dollars per pupil in the private schools, and only
eight dollars and forty-nine cents in the public schools. In the following table, Bradford
includes Groveland, Danvers includes South Danvers, Springfield includes Chicopee, and Roxbury
includes West Roxbury. This is rendered necessary for the purposes of comparison, as Groveland,
South Danvers, Chicopee, and West Roxbury, have been incorporated since 1832.

The Legislature of 1834 acted with wisdom and energy. The school fund having been established,
the towns were next required to furnish answers to certain questions that were substituted
for the requisition of the statute of 1826, and any town whose committee failed to make the
return was to be deprived of its share of the income of the school fund, whenever it should
be first distributed. (Res. 1834, chap. 78.)

Those measures were in the highest degree salutary. There were 305 towns in the state, and
returns were received from 261. There was still a want of accuracy and completeness; but from
this time forth the state secured what had never before been attained,--intelligent legislation
by the government, and intelligent coöperation and support by the people.

In December, 1834, the Secretary of the Commonwealth prepared an aggregate of the returns received,
of which the following is a copy:

Number of towns from which returns have been received,    261
Number of school districts,                             2,251
Number of male children attending school from
  four to sixteen years of age,                        67,499
Number of female children attending school from
  four to sixteen years of age,                        63,728
Number over sixteen and under twenty-one unable
  to read and write,                                      158
Number of male instructors,                             1,967
Number of female instructors,                           2,388
Amount raised by tax to support schools,          $810,178 87
Amount raised by contribution to support schools,   15,141 25
Average number of scholars attending academies
  and private schools,                                 24,749
Estimated amount paid for tuition in academies and private
 schools,                                         $276,575 75
Local funds--Yes,                                          71
Local funds--No,                                          181

Thus, by the institution of the school fund, provision was made for a system of annual returns,
from which has been drawn a series of statistical tables, that have not only exhibited the
school system as a whole and in its parts, but have also contributed essentially to its improvement.

These statistics have been so accurate and complete, for many years, as to furnish a safe basis
for legislation; and they have at the same time been employed by the friends of education as
means for awakening local interest, and stimulating and encouraging the people to assume freely
and bear willingly the burdens of taxation. It is now easy for each town, or for any inhabitant,
to know what has been done in any other town; and, as a consequence, those that do best are
a continual example to those that, under ordinary circumstances, might be indifferent. The
establishment and efficiency of the school-committee system is due also to the same agency.
There are, I fear, some towns that would now neglect to choose a school committee, were there
not a small annual distribution of money by the state; but, in 1832, the duty was often either
neglected altogether, or performed in such a manner that no appreciable benefit was produced.
The superintending committee is the most important agency connected with our system of instruction.
In some portions of the state the committees are wholly, and in others they are partly, responsible
for the qualifications of teachers; they everywhere superintend and give character to the schools,
and by their annual reports they exert a large influence over public opinion. The people now
usually elect well-qualified men; and it is believed that the extracts from the local reports,
published annually by the Board of Education, constitute the best series of papers in the language
upon the various topics that have from time to time been considered.[4] By the publication
of these abstracts, the committees, and indeed the people generally, are made acquainted with
everything that has been done, or is at any time doing, in the commonwealth. Improvements that
would otherwise remain local are made universal; information in regard to general errors is
easily communicated, and the errors themselves are speedily removed, while the system is, in
all respects, rendered homogeneous and efficient.

Nor does it seem to be any disparagement of Massachusetts to assume that, in some degree, she
is indebted to the school fund for the consistent and steady policy of the Legislature, pursued
for more than twenty years, and executed by the agency of the Board of Education. In this period,
normal schools have been established, which have educated a large number of teachers, and exerted
a powerful and ever increasing influence in favor of good learning. Teachers' institutes have
been authorized, and the experiment successfully tested. Agents of the Board of Education have
been appointed, so that it is now possible, by the aid of both these means, as is shown by
accompanying returns and statements, to afford, each year, to the people of a majority of the
towns an opportunity to confer with those who are specially devoted to the work of education.
In all this period of time, the Legislature has never been called upon to provide money for
the expenses which have thus been incurred; and, though a rigid scrutiny has been exercised
over the expenditures of the educational department, measures for the promotion of the common
schools have never been considered in relation to the general finances of the commonwealth.
While some states have hesitated, and others have vacillated, Massachusetts has had a consistent,
uniform, progressive policy, which is due in part to the consideration already named, and in
part, no doubt, to a popular opinion, traditional and historical in its origin, but sustained
and strengthened by the measures and experience of the last quarter of a century, that a system
of public instruction is so important an element of general prosperity as to justify all needful
appropriations for its support.

It may, then, be claimed for the Massachusetts School Fund, that the expectations of those
by whom it was established have been realized; that it has given unity and efficiency to the
school system; that it has secured accurate and complete returns from all the towns; that it
has, consequently, promoted a good understanding between the Legislature and the people; that
it has increased local taxation, but has never been a substitute for it; and that it has enabled
the Legislature, at all times and in every condition of the general finances, to act with freedom
in regard to those agencies which are deemed essential to the prosperity of the common schools
of the state.

Having thus, in the history of the school fund, fully justified its establishment, so in its
history we find sufficient reasons for its sacred preservation. While other communities, and
even other states, have treated educational funds as ordinary revenue, subject only to an obligation
on the part of the public to bestow an annual income on the specified object, Massachusetts
has ever acted in a fiduciary relation, and considered herself responsible for the principal
as well as the income of the fund, not only to this generation, but to every generation that
shall occupy the soil, and inherit the name and fame of this commonwealth.

It only remains for me to present the reasons which render an increase of the capital of the
fund desirable, if not necessary. The annual income of the existing fund amounts to about ninety-three
thousand dollars, one-half of which is distributed among the towns and cities, in proportion
to the number of persons in each between the ages of five and fifteen years. The distribution
for the year 1857-8 amounted to twenty cents and eight mills for each child. The following
table shows the annual distribution to the towns from the year 1836; the whole number of children
for each year except 1836 and 1840, when the entire population was the basis; and the amount
paid on account of each child since the year 1849, when the law establishing the present method
of distribution was enacted:

===================================================

It was contemplated by the founders of the school fund that an amount might safely be distributed
among the towns equal to one-third of the sums raised by taxation, but the state is really
furnishing only one-thirtieth of the annual expenditure. A distribution corresponding to the
original expectation is neither desirable nor possible; but a substantial addition might be
made without in any degree diminishing the interest of the people, or relieving them from taxation.
The income of the school fund has been three times used as a means of increasing the appropriations
in the towns. It is doubtful whether, without an addition to the fund, this power can be again
applied; and yet there are, according to the last returns, twenty-two towns that do not raise
a sum for schools equal to $2.50 for each child between the ages of five and fifteen years;
and there are fifty-two towns whose appropriations are less than three dollars. When the average
annual expenditure is over six dollars, the minimum ought not to be less than three.

It is to be considered that, as population increases, the annual personal distribution will
diminish, and consequently that the bond now existing between the Legislature and people will
be weakened. Moreover, any definite sum of money is worth less than it was twenty years ago;
and it is reasonably certain that the same sum will be less valuable in 1860, and yet less
valuable in 1870, than it is now. Hence, if the fund remain nominally the same, it yet suffers
a practical annual decrease. It is further to be presumed that the Legislature will find it
expedient to advance in its legislation from year to year. A small number of towns, few or
many, may not always approve of what is done, and it is quite important that the influence
of the fund should be sufficient to enable the state to execute its policy with uniformity
and precision.

As is well known, the expenses of the educational department are defrayed from the other half
of the income of the fund. From this income the forty-eight scholarships in the colleges, the
Normal Schools, the Teachers' Institutes, the Agents of the Board of Education, are supported,
and the salaries of the Secretary and the Assistant-Secretary are paid. As has been stated,
the surplus carried to the capital of the fund in June last was only $1,843.68. The objects
of expenditure, already named, may be abolished, but no reasonable plan of economy can effect
much saving while they exist. It is also reasonably certain that the expenses of the department
must be increased. The law now provides for twelve Teachers' Institutes, annually, and there
were opportunities during the present year for holding them; but, in order that one agent might
be constantly employed, and a second employed for the term of six months, I limited the number
of sessions to ten.

The salaries of the teachers in the Normal Schools are low, and the number of persons employed
barely adequate to the work to be done. Some change, involving additional expense, is likely
to be called for in the course of a few years.

In view of the eminent aid which the school fund has rendered to the cause of education, with
due deference to the wisdom and opinions of its founders, and with just regard to the existing
and probable necessities of the state in connection with the cause of education, I earnestly
favor the increase of the school fund by the addition of a million and a half of dollars.

Nor does the proposition for the state to appropriate annually $180,000 in aid of the common
schools seem unreasonable, when it is considered that the military expenses are $65,000, the
reformatory and correctional about $200,000, the charitable about $45,000, and the pauper expenses
nearly $250,000 more, all of which will diminish as our schools are year by year better qualified
to give thorough and careful intellectual, moral, and religious culture.

This increase seems to be necessary in order that the Massachusetts School Fund may furnish
aid to the common schools during the next quarter of a century proportionate to the relative
influence exerted by the same agency during the last twenty-five years. Nor will such an addition
give occasion for any apprehension that the zeal of the people will be diminished in the least.
Were there to be no increase of population in the state, the distribution for each pupil would
never exceed forty cents, or about one-fifteenth of the amount now raised by taxation.

So convinced are the people of Massachusetts of the importance of common schools, and so much
are they accustomed to taxation for their support, that there is no occasion to hesitate, lest
we should follow the example of those communities where large funds, operating upon an uneducated
and inexperienced popular opinion, have injured rather than benefited the public schools. The
ancient policy of the commonwealth will be continued; but, whenever the people see the government,
by solemn act, manifesting its confidence in schools and learning, they will be encouraged
to guard and sustain the institutions of the fathers.

A SYSTEM OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION.

[An Address before the Barnstable Agricultural Society, Oct. 8, 1857.]

In the month of February, 1855, a distinguished American, who has read much, and acquired,
by conversation, observation, and travels in this country and Europe, the highest culture of
American society, wrote these noticeable sentences: "The farmers have not kept pace, in intelligence,
with the rest of the community. They do not put brain-manure enough into their acres. Our style
of farming is slovenly, dawdling, and stupid, and the waste, especially in manure, is immense.
I suppose we are about, in farming, where the Lowlands of Scotland were fifty years ago; and
what immense strides agriculture has made in Great Britain since the battle of Waterloo, and
how impossible it would have been for the farmers to have held their own without!"[10]

It would not be civil for me to endorse these statements as introductory to a brief address
upon Agricultural Education; but I should not accept them at all did they not contain truth
enough to furnish a text for a layman's discourse before an assembly of farmers.

Competent American travellers concur in the opinion that the Europeans generally, and especially
our brethren of England, Ireland, and Scotland, are far in advance of us in scientific and
practical agriculture. This has been stated or admitted by Mr. Colman, President Hitchcock,
and last by Mr. French, who has recently visited Europe under the auspices of the National
Agricultural Society.

There are good reasons for the past and for the existing superiority of the Old World; and
there are good reasons, also, why this superiority should not much longer continue. Europe
is old,--America is young. Land has been cultivated for centuries in Europe, and often by the
same family; its capacity tested, its fitness or unfitness for particular crops proved, the
local and special effects of different fertilizers well known, and the experience of many generations
has been preserved, so as to be equivalent to a like experience, in time and extent, by the
present occupants of the soil.

In America there are no family estates, nor long occupation by the same family of the same
spot. Cultivated lands have changed hands as often as every twenty-five years from the settlement
of the country. The capacity of our soils to produce, when laboriously and systematically cultivated,
has not been ascertained; there has been no accumulation of experience by families, and but
little by the public; and the effort, in many sections, has been to draw as much as possible
from the land, while little or nothing was returned to it. Farming, as a whole, has not been
a system of cultivation, which implies improvement, but a process of exhaustion. It has been
easier for the farmer, though, perhaps, not as economical, if all the elements necessary to
a correct opinion could be combined, to exchange his worn-out lands for fresh soils, than to
adopt an improving system of agriculture. The present has been consulted; the future has been
disregarded. As the half-civilized hunters of the pampas of Buenos Ayres make indiscriminate
slaughter of the myriads of wild cattle that roam over the unfenced prairies of the south,
and preserve the hides only for the commerce and comfort of the world, so we have clutched
from nature whatever was in sight or next at hand, regardless of the actual and ultimate wrong
to physical and vegetable life; and, as the pioneers of a better civilization now gather up
the bones long neglected and bleaching under tropical suns and tropical rains, and by the agency
of trade, art, and industry, extort more wealth from them than was originally derived from
the living animals, so we shall find that worn-out lands, when subjected to skilful, careful,
scientific husbandry, are quite as profitable as the virgin soils, which, from the day of the
migration into the Connecticut valley to the occupancy of the Missouri and the Kansas, have
proved so tempting to our ancestors and to us. But there has been some philosophy, some justice,
and considerable necessity, in the course that has been pursued. Subsistence is the first desire;
and, in new countries where forests are to be felled, dwellings erected, public institutions
established, roads and bridges built, settlers cannot be expected, in the cultivation of the
land, to look much beyond the present moment. And they are entitled to the original fertility
of the soil. Europe passed through the process of settlement and exhaustion many centuries
ago. Her recovery has been the work of centuries,--ours may be accomplished in a few years,
even within the limits of a single life. The fact from which an improving system of agriculture
must proceed is apparent in the northern and central Atlantic states, and is, in a measure,
appreciated in the West. We have all heard that certain soils were inexhaustible. The statement
was first made of the valley of the Connecticut, then of the Genesee country, then of Ohio,
then of Illinois, and occasionally we now hear similar statements of Kansas, or California,
or the valley of the Willamette. In the nature of things these statements were erroneous. The
idea of soil, in reason and in the use of the word, contains the idea of exhaustion. Soil is
not merely the upper stratum of the earth; it is a substance which possesses the power, under
certain circumstances, of giving up essential properties of its own for the support of vegetable
and ultimately of animal life. What it gives up it loses, and to the extent of its loss it
is exhausted. It is no more untrue to say that the great cities of the world have not, in their
building, exhausted the forests and the mines to any extent, than to say that the annual abundant
harvests of corn and wheat have not, in any degree, exhausted the prairies and bottom lands
of the West. Some lands may be exhausted for particular crops in a single year; others in five
years, others in ten, while others may yield undiminished returns for twenty, fifty, or even
a hundred years. But it is plain that annual cropping without rotation, and without compensation
by nature or art, must finally deprive the soil of the required elements. Nor should we deceive
ourselves by considering only those exceptions whose existence is due to the fact that nature
makes compensation for the loss. Annual or occasional irrigation with rich deposits,--as upon
the Nile and the Connecticut,--allowing the land to lie fallow, rotation of crops and the growth
of wood, are so many expedients and provisions by which nature increases the productiveness
of the earth. Nor is a great depth of soil, as two, five, ten, or twenty feet, any security
against its ultimate impoverishment. Only a certain portion is available. It has been found
in the case of coal-mines which lie at great depths, that they are, for the present, valueless;
and we cannot attach much importance to soil that is twenty feet below the surface. Neither
cultivation nor vegetation can go beyond a certain depth; and wherever vegetable life exists,
its elements are required and appropriated. Great depth of soil is desirable; but, with our
present knowledge and means of culture, it furnishes no security against ultimate exhaustion.

The fact that all soils are exhaustible establishes the necessity for agricultural education,
by whose aid the processes of impoverishment may be limited in number and diminished in force;
and the realization of this fact by the public generally is the only justification necessary
for those who advocate the immediate application of means to the proposed end.

And, gentlemen, if you will allow a festive day to be marred by a single word of criticism,
I feel constrained to say, that a great obstacle to the increased usefulness, further elevation,
and higher respectability, of agriculture, is in the body of farmers themselves. And I assume
this to be so upon the supposition that agriculture is not a cherished pursuit in many farmers'
homes; that the head of the family often regards his life of labor upon the land as a necessity
from which he would willingly escape; that he esteems other pursuits as at once less laborious,
more profitable, and more honorable, than his own; that children, both sons and daughters,
under the influence of parents, both father and mother, receive an education at home, which
neither school, college, nor newspaper, can counteract, that leads them to abandon the land
for the store, the shop, the warehouse, the professions, or the sea.

The reasonable hope of establishing a successful system of agricultural education is not great
where such notions prevail.

Agriculture is not to attain to true practical dignity by the borrowed lustre that eminent
names, ancient and modern, may have lent to it, any more than the earth itself is warmed and
made fruitful by the aurora borealis of an autumn night. Our system of public instruction,
from the primary school to the college, rests mainly upon the public belief in its importance,
its possibility, and its necessity. It is easy on a professional holiday to believe in the
respectability of agriculture; but is it a living sentiment, controlling your conduct, and
inspiring you with courage and faith in your daily labor? Does it lead you to contemplate with
satisfaction the prospect that your son is to be a farmer also, and that your daughter is to
be a farmer's wife? These, I imagine, are test questions which not all farmers nor farmers'
wives can answer in the affirmative. Else, why the custom among farmers' sons of making their
escape, at the earliest moment possible, from the labors and restraints of the farm? Else,
why the disposition of the farmer's daughter to accept other situations, not more honorable,
and in the end not usually more profitable, than the place of household aid to the business
of the home? How, then, can a system of education be prosperous and efficient, when those for
whom it is designed neither respect their calling nor desire to pursue it? You will not, of
course, imagine that I refer, in these statements, to all farmers; there are many exceptions;
but my own experience and observation lead me to place confidence in the fitness of these remarks,
speaking generally of the farmers of New England. It is, however, true, and the statement of
the truth ought not to be omitted, that the prevalent ideas among us are much in advance of
what they were ten years ago. In what has been accomplished we have ground for hope, and even
security for further advancement.

I look, then, first and chiefly to an improved home culture, as the necessary basis of a system
of agricultural education. Christian education, culture, and life, depend essentially upon
the influences of home; and we feel continually the importance of kindred influences upon our
common school system.

It will not, of course, be wise to wait, in the establishment of a system of agricultural education,
until we are satisfied that every farmer is prepared for it; in the beginning sufficient support
may be derived from a small number of persons, but in the end it must be sustained by the mass
of those interested. Other pursuits and professions must meet the special claims made upon
them, and in the matter of agricultural education they cannot be expected to do more than assent
to what the farmers themselves may require.

An important part of a system of agricultural education has been, as it seems to me, already
established. I speak of our national, state, county, and town associations for the promotion
of agriculture. The first three may educate the people through their annual fairs, by their
publications, and by the collection and distribution of rare seeds, plants, and animals, that
are not usually within reach of individual farmers. By such means, and others less noticeable,
these agencies can exert a powerful influence upon the farmers of the country; but their thorough,
systematic education must be carried on at home. And for local and domestic education I think
we must rely upon our public schools, upon town clubs or associations of farmers, and upon
scientific men who may be appointed by the government to visit the towns, confer with the people,
and receive and communicate information upon the agricultural resources and defects of the
various localities. It will be observed that in this outline of a plan of education I omit
the agricultural college. This omission is intentional, and I will state my reasons for it.
I speak, however, of the present; the time may come when such an institution will be needed.
In Massachusetts, Mr. Benjamin Bussey has made provision for a college at Roxbury, and Mr.
Oliver Smith has made similar provision for a college at Northampton; but these bequests will
not be available for many years. In England, Ireland, Scotland, France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia,
Austria, and the smaller states of Europe, agricultural schools and colleges have been established;
and they appear to be the most numerous where the ignorance of the people is the greatest.
England has five colleges and schools, Ireland sixty-three, while Scotland has only a professorship
in each of her colleges at Aberdeen and Edinburgh. In France, there are seventy-five agricultural
schools; but in seventy of them--called inferior schools--the instruction is a compound of
that given in our public schools and the discipline of a good farmer upon his land, with some
special attention to agricultural reading and farm accounts. Such schools are not desired and
would not be patronized among us. When an agricultural school is established, it must be of
a higher grade,--it must take rank with the colleges of the country. President Hitchcock, in
his report, published in 1851, states that six professors would be required; that the first
outlay would be sixty-seven thousand dollars, and that the annual expense would be six thousand
and two hundred dollars. By these arrangements and expenditures he contemplates the education
of one hundred students, who are to pay annually each for tuition the sum of forty dollars.
It was also proposed to connect an agricultural department with several of the existing academies,
at an annual expense of three thousand dollars more. These estimates of cost seem low, nor
do I find in this particular any special objection to the recommendation made by the commissioners
of the government; any other scheme is likely to be quite as expensive in the end.

My chief objection is, that such a plan is not comprehensive enough, and cannot, in a reasonable
time, sensibly affect the average standard of agricultural learning among us. The graduation
of fifty students a year would be equal to one in a thousand or fifteen hundred of the farmers
of the state; and in ten years there would not be one professionally educated farmer in a hundred.
We are not, of course, to overlook the indirect influence of such a school, through its students
annually sent forth: the better modes of culture adopted by them would, to some extent, be
copied by others; nor are we to overlook the probability of a prejudice against the institution
and its graduates, growing out of the republican ideas of equality prevailing among us. But
the struggle against mere prejudice would be an honorable struggle, if, in the hour of victory,
the college could claim to have reformed and elevated materially the practices and ideas of
the farmers of the country. I fear that even victory under such circumstances would not be
complete success. An institution established in New England must look to the existing peculiarities
of our country, rather than venture at once upon the adoption of schemes that may have been
successful elsewhere. Here every farmer is a laborer himself, employing usually from one to
three hands, and they are often persons who look to the purchase and cultivation of a farm
on their own account; while in England the master farmer is an overseer rather than a laborer.
The number of men in Europe who own land or work it on their own account is small; the number
of laborers whose labors are directed by the proprietors and farmers is quite large. Under
these circumstances, if the few are educated, the work will go successfully on; while here,
our agricultural education ought to reach the great body of those who labor upon the land.
Will a college in each state answer the demand for agricultural education now existing? Is
it safe in any country, or in any profession or pursuit, to educate a few, and leave the majority
to the indirect influence of the culture thus bestowed? And is it philosophical, in this country,
where there is a degree of personal and professional freedom such as is nowhere else enjoyed,
to found a college or higher institution of learning upon the general and admitted ignorance
of the people in the given department? or is it wiser, by elementary training and the universal
diffusion of better ideas, to make the establishment of the college the necessity of the culture
previously given? Every new school, not a college, makes the demand for the college course
greater than it was before; and the advance made in our public schools increases the students
in the colleges and the university. We build from the primary school to the college; and without
the primary school and its dependents,--the grammar, high school, and academy,--the colleges
would cease to exist. This view of education supports the statement that an agricultural college
is not the foundation of a system of agricultural training, but a result that is to be reached
through a preliminary and elementary course of instruction. What shall that course be? I say,
first, the establishment of town or neighborhood societies of farmers and others interested
in agriculture. These societies ought to be auxiliary to the county societies, and they never
can become their rivals or enemies unless they are grossly perverted in their management and
purposes. As such societies must be mutual and voluntary in their character, they can be established
in any town where there are twenty, ten, or even five persons who are disposed to unite together.
Its object would, of course, be the advancement of practical agriculture; and it would look
to theories and even to science as means only for the attainment of a specified end. The exercises
of such societies would vary according to the tastes and plans of the members and directors;
but they would naturally provide for discussions and conversations among themselves, lectures
from competent persons, the establishment of a library, and for the collection of models and
drawings of domestic animals, models of varieties of fruit, specimens of seeds, grasses, and
grains, rocks, minerals, and soils. The discussions and conversations would be based upon the
actual observation and experience of the members; and agriculture would at once become better
understood and more carefully practised by each person who intended to contribute to the exercises
of the meeting.

Until the establishment of agricultural journals, there were no means by which the results
of individual experience could be made known to the mass of farmers; and, even now, men of
the largest experience are not the chief contributors.

Wherever a local club exists, it is always possible to compare the knowledge of the different
members; and the results of such comparison may, when deemed desirable, be laid before the
public at large. It is also in the power of such an organization thoroughly and at once to
test any given experiment. The attention of this section of the country has been directed to
the culture of the Chinese sugar-cane; and merchants, economists, and statesmen, as well as
the farmers themselves, are interested in the speedy and satisfactory solution of so important
an industrial problem. Had the attention of a few local societies in different parts of New
England been directed to the culture, with special reference to its feasibility and profitableness,
a definite result might have been reached the present year. The growth of flax, both in the
means of cultivation and in economy, is a subject of great importance. Many other crops might
also be named, concerning which opposite, not to say vague, opinions prevail. The local societies
may make these trials through the agency of individual members better than they can be made
by county and state societies, and better than they can usually be made upon model or experimental
farms. It will often happen upon experimental farms that the circumstances do not correspond
to the condition of things among the farmers. The combined practical wisdom of such associations
must be very great; and I have but to refer to the published minutes of the proceedings of
the Concord Club to justify this statement in its broadest sense. The meetings of such a club
have all the characteristics of a school of the highest order. Each member is at the same time
a teacher and a pupil. The meeting is to the farmer what the court-room is to the lawyer, the
hospital to the physician, and the legislative assembly to the statesman.

Moot courts alone will not make skilful lawyers; the manikin is but an indifferent teacher
of anatomy; and we may safely say that no statesman was ever made so by books, schools, and
street discussions, without actual experience in some department of government.

It is, of course, to be expected that an agricultural college would have the means of making
experiments; but each experiment could be made only under a single set of circumstances, while
the agency of local societies, in connection with other parts of the plan that I have the honor
diffidently to present, would convert at once a county or a state into an experimental farm
for a given time and a given purpose. The local club being always practical and never theoretical,
dealing with things always and never with signs, presenting only facts and never conjectures,
would, as a school for the young farmer, be quite equal, and in some respects superior, to
any that the government can establish. But, it may be asked, will you call that a school which
is merely an assembly of adults without a teacher? I answer that technically it is not a school,
but that in reality such an association is a school in the best use of the word. A school is,
first, for the development of powers and qualities whose germs already exist; then for the
acquisition of knowledge previously possessed by others; then for the prosecution of original
inquiries and investigations. The associations of which I speak would possess all these powers,
and contemplate all these results; but that their powers might be more efficient, and for the
advancement of agriculture generally, it seems to me fit and proper for the state to appoint
scientific and practical men as agents of the Board of Agriculture, and lecturers upon agricultural
science and labor. If an agricultural college were founded, a farm would be required, and at
least six professors would be necessary. Instead of a single farm, with a hundred young men
upon it, accept gratuitously, as you would no doubt have opportunity, the use of many farms
for experiments and repeated trials of crops, and, at the same time, educate, not a hundred
only, but many thousand young men, nearly as well in theory and science, and much better in
practical labor, than they could be educated in a college. Six professors, as agents, could
accomplish a large amount of necessary work; possibly, for the present, all that would be desired.
Assume, for this inquiry, that Massachusetts contains three hundred agricultural towns; divide
these towns into sections of fifty each; then assign one section to each agent, with the understanding
that his work for the year is to be performed in that section, and then that he is to be transferred
to another. By a rotation of appointments and a succession of labors, the varied attainments
of the lecturers would be enjoyed by the whole commonwealth. But, it may be asked, what, specifically
stated, shall the work of the agents be? Only suggestions can be offered in answer to this
inquiry. An agent might, in the summer season, visit his fifty towns, and spend two days in
each. While there, he could ascertain the kinds of crops, modes of culture, nature of soils,
practical excellences, and practical defects, of the farmers; and he might also provide for
such experiments as he desired to have made. It would, likewise, be in his power to give valuable
advice, where it might be needed, in regard to farming proper, and also to the erection and
repair of farm-buildings. I am satisfied that a competent agent would, in this last particular
alone, save to the people a sum equal to the entire cost of his services. After this labor
was accomplished, eight months would remain for the preparation and delivery of lectures in
the fifty towns previously visited. These lectures might be delivered in each town, or the
agent might hold meetings of the nature of institutes in a number of towns centrally situated.
In either case, the lectures would be at once scientific and practical; and their practical
character would be appreciated in the fact that a judicious agent would adapt his lectures
to the existing state of things in the given locality. This could not be done by a college,
however favorably situated, and however well accomplished in the material of education. It
is probable that the lectures would be less scientific than those that would be given in a
college; but when their superior practical character is considered, and when we consider also
that they would be listened to by the great body of farmers, old and young, while those of
the college could be enjoyed by a small number of youth only, we cannot doubt which would be
the most beneficial to the state, and to the cause of agriculture in the country.

An objection to the plan I have indicated may be found in the belief that the average education
of the farmers is not equal to a full appreciation of the topics and lectures to be presented.
My answer is, that the lecturers must meet the popular intelligence, whatever it is. Nothing
is to be assumed by the teacher; it is his first duty to ascertain the qualifications of his
pupils. I am, however, led to the opinion that the schools of the country have already laid
a very good basis for practical instruction in agriculture; and, if this be not so, then an
additional argument will be offered for the most rapid advance possible in our systems of education.
In any event, it is true that the public schools furnish a large part of the intellectual culture
given in the inferior and intermediate agricultural schools of Europe.

The great defect in the plan I have presented is this: That no means are provided for the thorough
education needed by those persons who are to be appointed agents, and no provision is made
for testing the qualities of soils, and the elements of grains, grasses, and fruits. My answer
to this suggestion is, that it is in part, at least, well founded; but that the scientific
schools furnish a course of study in the natural sciences which must be satisfactory to the
best educated farmer or professor of agricultural learning, and that analyses may be made in
the laboratories of existing institutions.

It is my fortune to be able to read a letter from Professor Horsford, which furnishes a satisfactory
view of the ability of the Scientific School at Cambridge.

                                       "Cambridge, Sept. 19, 1857.

"MY DEAR SIR: The occupation incident to the opening of the term has prevented an earlier answer
to your letter of inquiry in regard to the Scientific School.

"The Scientific School furnishes, I believe, the necessary scientific knowledge for students
of agriculture (such as you mention), 'who have been well educated at our high schools, academies,
or colleges, and have also been trained practically in the business of farming.' It provides:

"1st. Practical instruction in the modes of experimental investigation. This is, I know, an
unrecognized department, but it is, perhaps, the better suited name to the course of instruction
of our chemical department. It qualifies the student for the most direct methods of solving
the practical problems which are constantly arising in practical agriculture. It includes the
analysis of soils, the manufacture and testing of manures, the philosophy of improved methods
of culture, of rotation of crops, of dairy production, of preserving fruits, meats, &c. It
applies more or less directly to the whole subject of mechanical expedients.

"2d. Practical instruction in surveying, mensuration, and drawing.

"3d. And by lectures--in botany, geology, zoology, comparative anatomy, and natural philosophy.

"Some of them--indeed, all of them, if desired--might be pursued practically, and with the
use of apparatus and specimens.

"This course contemplates a period of study of from one year to two and a half years, according
to the qualification of the pupil at the outset. He appears an hour each day at the blackboard,
where he shares the drill of a class, and where he acquires a facility of illustration, command
of language, an address and thorough consciousness of real knowledge, which are of more value,
in many cases, as you know, than almost any amount of simple acquisition. He also attends,
on an average, about one lecture a day throughout the year. During the remaining time he is
occupied with experimental work in the laboratory or field.

"The great difficulty with students of agriculture, who might care to come to the Scientific
School, is the expense of living in Cambridge. If some farmer at a distance of three or four
miles from college, where rents for rooms are low, would open a boarding-house for students
of agriculture in the Scientific School, where the care of a kitchen garden and some stock
might be intrusted to them, and where a farmer's plain table might be spread at the price at
which laborers would be received, we might hope that our facilities would be taken advantage
of on a larger scale. As it is, but few, comparatively, among our students, come to qualify
themselves for farming."

I should, however, consider the arrangements proposed as temporary, and finally to be abandoned
or made permanent, as experience should dictate.

It may be said, I think, without disparagement to the many distinguished and disinterested
men who have labored for the advancement of agriculture, that the operations of the government
and of the state and county societies have no plan or system by which, as a whole, they are
guided. The county societies have been and are the chief means of influence and progress; but
they have no power which can be systematically applied; their movements are variable, and their
annual exhibitions do not always indicate the condition of agriculture in the districts represented.
They have become, to a certain extent, localized in the vicinity of the towns where the fairs
are held; and yet they do not possess the vigor which institutions positively local would enjoy.

The town clubs hold annual fairs; and these fairs should be made tributary, in their products
and in the interest they excite, to the county fairs. Let the town fairs be held as early in
the season as practicable, and then let each town send to the county fairs its first-class
premium articles as the contributions of the local society, as well as of the individual producers.
Thus a healthful and generous rivalry would be stirred up between the towns of a county as
well as among the citizens of each town; and a county exhibition upon the plan suggested would
represent at one view the general condition of agriculture in the vicinity. No one can pretend
that this is accomplished by the present arrangements. Moreover, the county society, in its
management and in its annual exhibitions, would possess an importance which it had not before
enjoyed. As each town would be represented by the products of the dairy, the herd, and the
field, so it would be represented by its men; and the annual fair of the county would be a
truthful and complete exposition of its industrial standing and power.

Out of a system thus broad, popular, and strong, an agricultural college will certainly spring,
if such an institution shall be needed. But is it likely that in a country where the land is
divided, and the number of farmers is great, the majority will ever be educated in colleges,
and upon strict scientific principles? I am ready to answer that such an expectation seems
to me a mere delusion. The great body of young farmers must be educated by the example and
practices of their elders, by their own efforts at individual and mutual improvement, and by
the influence of agricultural journals, books, lecturers, and the example of thoroughly educated
men. And, as thoroughly educated men, lecturers, journals, and books of a proper character,
cannot be furnished without the aid of scientific schools and thorough culture, the farmers,
as a body, are interested in the establishment of all institutions of learning which promise
to advance any number of men, however small, in the mysteries of the profession; but, when
we design a system of education for a class, common wisdom requires us to contemplate its influence
upon each individual. The influence of a single college in any state, or in each state of this
Union, would be exceedingly limited; but local societies and travelling lecturers could make
an appreciable impression in a year upon the agricultural population of any state, and in New
England the interest in the subject is such that there is no difficulty in founding town clubs,
and making them at once the agents of the government and the schools for the people.

In the plan indicated, I have, throughout, assumed the disposition of the farmers to educate
themselves. This assumption implies a certain degree of education already attained; for a consciousness
of the necessity of education is only developed by culture, learning, and reflection. Such
being the admitted fact, it remains that the farmers themselves ought at once to institute
such means of self-improvement as are at their command. They are, in nearly every state of
this Union, a majority of the voters, and the controlling force of society and the government;
but I do not from these facts infer the propriety of a reliance on their part upon the powers
which they may thus direct. However wisely said, when first said, it is not wise to "look to
the government for too much;" and there can be no reasonable doubt of the ability of the farmers
to institute and perfect such measures of self-education as are at present needed. But the
spirit in which they enter upon this work must be broad, comprehensive, catholic. They will
find something, I hope, of example, something of motive, something of power, in their experience
as friends and supporters of our system of common school education; and something of all these,
I trust, in the facts that this system is kept in motion by the self-imposed taxation of the
whole people; that all individuals and classes of men, forgetting their differences of opinion
in politics and religion, rally to its support, as being in itself a safe basis on which may
be built whatever structures men of wisdom and virtue and piety may desire to erect, whether
they labor first and chiefly for the world that is, or for that which is to come.

illustrations. It has proved immensely popular among the little folks. Price 75 cents.

RED BEARD'S STORIES FOR CHILDREN. Translated from the German, by COUSIN FANNIE.

The illustrations for this book are of a most novel and taking character. They are in imitation
of the silhouettes or pictures cut out by scissors, in which our ancestors' portraits have
often been preserved. The pictures are numerous, spirited and effective. The stories are worthy
of their elegant dress. Price 75 cents.

BRIGHT PICTURES OF CHILD-LIFE. Translated from the German, by COUSIN FANNIE. Illustrated by
numerous highly-finished colored engravings. Price 75 cents.

VIOLET; A Fairy Story. Illustrated by Billings. Price 50 cents; gilt, 75 cents.

The publishers desire to call attention to this exquisite little story. It breathes such a
love of Nature in all her forms; inculcates such excellent principles, and is so full of beauty
and simplicity, that it will delight not only children, but all readers of unsophisticated
tastes. The author seems to teach the gentle creed which Coleridge has embodied in those familiar
lines--

     "He prayeth well who loveth well
     Both man, and bird, and beast."

DAISY; or the Fairy Spectacles. By the author of "VIOLET." Illustrated. Price 50 cents; gilt,
75 cents.

THE GREAT ROSY DIAMOND. By MRS. ANNE AUGUSTA CARTER With illustrations by Billings. Price 50
cents; gilt 75 cents.

This is a most charming story, from an author of reputation in this department, both in England
and America. The machinery of Fairy Land is employed with great ingenuity; the style is beautiful,
imaginative, yet simple. The frolics of Robin Goodfellow are rendered with the utmost grace
and spirit.

TALES FROM SHAKSPEARE. Designed for the Use of Young Persons. By CHARLES LAMB. From the fifth
London edition. 12mo. Illustrated. Price, bound in muslin, $1.00; gilt, $1.50.

These tales are intended to interest children and youth in some of the plays of Shakspeare.
The form of the dialogue is dropped, and instead the plots are woven into stories, which are
models of beauty. What Hawthorne has lately done for the classical mythology, Lamb has here
done for Shakspeare.

PUBLISHED BY PHILLIPS, SAMPSON & CO., Boston, And for sale by all Booksellers in the United States.

with finely executed engravings from original designs by Billings. Price
$7; single, 50 cents, Any volume sold separately.
     Rollo's Philosophy--Air.
     Rollo's Philosophy--Sky.

This is undoubtedly the most popular series of juvenile books ever published in America. This
edition is far more attractive externally than the one by which the author first became known.
Nearly one hundred new engravings, clear and fine paper, a new and beautiful cover, with a
neat box to contain the whole, will give to this series, if possible, a still wider and more
enduring reputation.
