"No," I answered quietly, "but you could tell me exactly how many pretty girls were amongst
the congregation, and describe their features accurately!" And he not only forbore to deny
the accusation, but admitted it with pride! No girl, he assured me, with any pretence to good
looks, ever escaped his notice.

Which was the worse, I wonder; he or I? At least I did not glory in my misdeeds.

"Il faut souffrir pour être belle;" and I have suffered sometimes. How often I used to burn
myself when I first began to curl my hair! This is such an arduous task, too, with me, for
my hair is, as my old nurse used to call it, "like a yard o' pumpwater" (I never went to her
when I wanted a compliment). It certainly is straight, and I find it a matter of great difficulty
to give it the appearance of natural curls. But "practice makes perfect," they say, so I still
persevere, hoping that it may come right some day. I have to be so careful in damp and rainy
weather. It is such a shock to look at yourself after a day's outing, to find your "fringe"
hanging in straight lines all down your forehead, an arrangement that is so particularly unbecoming.
You begin to wonder at what time during the day it commenced to unbend, and if you have had
that melancholy, damp appearance many hours. Perhaps it is as well that you did not know before,
for it could not have been rectified; you cannot bring a pair of tongs and a spirit-lamp out
of your pocket and begin operations in public! Still it is exceedingly aggravating if you think
you have been making an impression, and you return home to confront such a dejected-looking
spectacle as you find in your mirror.

I am wandering again. Let me get back to my subject--Dress. To insure a good fit you must have
your gown so tight that it is impossible to raise your arms. You are obliged to walk about
stiffly, with all the appearance of a trussed fowl. If you wish to put on your hat you must
first unbutton your bodice! It is particularly awkward, too, in Church: you scarcely have the
power to hold your book at seeing distance. But what do such trifles matter? You look as if
you had been melted and poured into your gown. What are a few discomforts, more or less, when
you have procured an effect such as that?

I always like to look as tall as possible. Five feet four is not a very great height; so, to
give the appearance of another inch I have my skirts made as long as possible; that is to say,
they just don't sweep the pavement, and that is all. But, oh! the trouble of that extra inch!
Unfortunately I have no carriage, my present pecuniary condition does not permit me the luxury
of hansoms, and I always avoid an omnibus, where you have fat old men sitting nearly on the
top of you, wet umbrellas streaming on to your boots, squalling babies, and disputes with the
conductor continuing most of the way--not to speak of the time you have to wait while so many
roll by "full inside!" So on muddy days, when I take my walks, the amount of distress I have
to undergo on account of the length of my gown is inconceivable. I grow weary with holding
it up, and have to stop in the middle of the street to change hands, and when you have an umbrella
as well, and sometimes a small parcel besides, this performance is anything but a momentary
matter. You drop your gown, the umbrella changes hands, and the parcel generally falls in the
mud! While picking it up, four impatient, wet, mackintoshed pedestrians knock against you,
and go off uttering imprecations on your head. And when you are once again comfortably settled,
your satisfaction does not last long. Your left hand tires as soon as your right, and the scene
has all to be acted over again.

There is a great deal of "savoir faire" in holding up. Your gown must be high enough to quite
clear the ground, but then comes the danger of holding it too high. There has been no license
yet granted for the exhibition of ankles in the great metropolis either by Mrs. Grundy or the
County Councils; therefore "holding up" becomes a very delicate performance.

Though we do not dress only to please the men, I always prefer their criticisms on a costume
to those of my own sex. You can never tell if the latter speak the truth. They may be jealous,
and run it down from spite; they may want to gain something from you, and so call yours "a
perfection of a gown, and suits you admirably, my dear!" disliking it exceedingly in their
inmost hearts.

But a man never gives his approbation unless he really means what he says, and he is not difficult
to please as a rule. So long as the costume is neat and well-fitting, he does not care about
anything else. It is the tout ensemble he thinks of, not the thousand and one details that
go to make up the whole.

I wonder why so many men dislike large hats! It is a pity, for they are so very becoming to
some faces, and give a picturesque effect altogether. Perhaps this last is a reason for their
disapproval. They never like their womankind to attract attention.

The most unpardonable sin one woman can commit against another, is to copy her clothes and
bring the style out as her own idea. It is intensely irritating! If she admits she has copied
or asks your leave beforehand, it is a different matter. You are even gratified then, for "imitation
is the sincerest flattery." But to have your ideas stolen and brought out in such a way as
to convey the impression that you are the imitator, to say the least, arouses murderous intentions
in your heart!

There are times, too, when you receive a shock to your vanity; times when you are quite satisfied
with your appearance, and find to your dismay that everyone is not of the same opinion.

I remember once when I was dining out and feeling very pleased with my tout ensemble, I was
disillusioned in a way that not only upset my self-confidence, but my gravity at the same time.
To heighten the general effect, I had stuck a patch near my mouth. (Oh, the minds of the last
century! From whose fertile brain did it emanate, I wonder, the fact that a piece of black
plaster on the face, should be so eminently becoming!) Imagine my horror when the maid, an
old servant I knew very well, took me aside and whispered confidentially, "Oh, Miss! you've
got such a big smut on your chin!"

Clothes are altogether a great nuisance, I think. How tired you get of the regular routine
of the morning toilet; always the same, never any variety. Why are we not born, like dogs,
with nice cosy rugs all over us, so that we should just have to get out of bed in the morning,
shake ourselves, and be ready at once to go down to breakfast and do the business of the day?

"Ah well! God knows what's best for us all," as an old charwoman said to me, years ago, when
she was remarking on how I had grown. I never saw the application of the remark, and do not
think I ever shall. Whether my growth was a subject to deplore, and she tried to comfort me,
or not, I cannot say; but she was evidently proud of the remark, for she repeated it three times!

CHAPTER VI.

ON CHRISTMAS.

It is such a prickly time. Not only everything but everybody is positively bristling with prickles.
Go where you will, you cannot avoid these pointed, jagged edges. You come across them everywhere,
and have to suffer accordingly.

To begin with, there is the holly. Now you could not find anything lovelier in the way of foliage
than holly, only such a little suffices. At Christmas time you are literally saturated with
it. In every house you enter, in everything you eat, at every step you take, nothing but holly,
holly, holly.

Then there are the Church decorations, begun generally a week beforehand. All the ladies of
the place assemble in the vestry, attracted there by divers reasons. Some, by the desire to
have a finger in every pie; some, because it is an opportunity to meet the curates; and some,
but a very few, from real love of the work. I cannot understand these latter, I must confess.
It is the most disagreeable work I have ever undertaken. Such dirty work, too! Your hands or
your gloves grow perfectly black under the operation; and it is a curious thing, that when
this stage is reached, your nose invariably begins to itch, and you forget the condition of
your fingers, and--well, the result is anything but becoming! It is so comfortable, too, walking
about the vestry, isn't it? The holly grows so affectionate to your ankles, and at every step
squash goes a berry, and all its middle oozes out and sticks to the sole of your boot. When
you go home, you find you are at least an inch taller by reason of the many corpses of berries
you have collected!

Yes, Christmas decorations are delightful altogether. And so the clergymen think, when they
become excited in their sermons, and bring their fists down sharply on some charming arrangement
of holly round the pulpit. They do not actually swear then, but their faces express sufficiently
all they would like to say; it rather spoils the effect of the discourse, especially if the
text be on the virtue of patience.

As I said before, everybody is prickly at Christmas time, especially one's relations. And so,
to make the season as festive as possible, we, in our sensible way, collect as many of these
cheerful, sociable beings together as we can; and, in short, make a delightful family party.
Holly? it is an insult to the tree to compare it in any way. No, I think the whole gathering
resembles a hedgehog more than anything else. It is one mass of prickles. Ah, these happy family
parties! Is there ever one member that agrees with another, I wonder?

There is the crabbed old maiden aunt, always on the defensive, never without the idea that
someone is waging war against her. Yet she has to be treated civilly, and humored. Has she
not that which some people term "filthy lucre," but never really think so? Have these old ladies
ever had any youth? Have they ever danced and enjoyed themselves like other people? What has
made them so sour, so bitter? Is it disappointment or regret? Poor old souls! In spite of their
money, they never seem happy. They are to be pitied, I think, though they do try to make themselves
as disagreeable as possible. They are so independent, too, they will not be interfered with.
They know everything better than any one else. One old lady I used to know declined altogether
to have a lawyer, insisting on making her will herself. It was found afterwards, fortunately
not too late, that she had appointed herself her own executor!

Then there is the maternal grandmother; to whom, of course, the host is openly rude. This wears
you out more than anything, for you have always to be ready to smooth over and soften every
sentence that is said. And she never helps you at all, either. If she can possibly put her
foot in it, and unconsciously irritate her son-in-law more than ever, she does it.

Then the uncle who spends his life in making the most villainous puns you ever heard. Not a
remark, not a word in any assembly, which this witty specimen of humanity does not at once
garnish with a pun of the poorest description. It generally has to be repeated twice, too,
for it is never noticed the first time. The poor pun, indeed, has a most melancholy existence,
for it is greeted with no other applause than that emanating from the author of its being,
and stirs up a torrent of abuse from the maiden aunt, who thinks the laughter is directed at her.

Why were punsters ever invented, or family parties either? They are our thorns in the flesh,
I suppose, and so must be endured.

After dancing attendance upon these lively old people during the day, the least you expect
is a good night's rest to support and invigorate you for the battles on the following day.
But no, at Christmas time any repose is denied you.

You are just off to sleep, forgetful of all troubles and strife, when you are rudely awakened
and brought back to the present by the most awful screechings under your window. Morpheus flies,
he has a musical ear has that god, and when once, "Oh, come let us adore him," with a concertina
accompaniment, both voices and instrument woefully out of tune; when once these harmonious
strains have started, that good old deity goes, to return no more that night.

Where does the pleasure come in, I wonder? Certainly not to us fuming inside; and surely not
to those poor deluded people squalling outside! It must be so cold, so raw; and they never
get appreciated, these so-called "waits"--oh, if they only would not wait, but go away somewhere
else, how much more satisfactory for us all!

No, Christmas is not a soothing time. It does not altogether improve your temper. How glad
I am when the festive season draws to a close, and the last petitioner for Christmas-boxes
goes on his way rejoicing. To me it always realizes that period so often referred to by the
lower classes, "a month o' Sundays." So much church and so few posts!

It certainly is a little more interesting when the presents come in. There is a kind of excitement
about them; and it is not until the following day, when you find yourself with a dozen letters
of gratitude to indite, that you feel that perhaps, after all, you might have done without them.

There is nothing so annoying as being obliged to write letters when you do not feel inclined.
It is a great art, this letter writing, and very few possess it. People often think they do,
and they write for writing's sake; but these letters are most wearying to read. Between every
line you seem to see the words, "Is not this a charming letter?" and in reality you are so
bored it is all you can do to reach the end. Then those dreadful persons who "cross and recross"
their epistles in every direction! Paper is not so dear but that they could at least afford
a fly-leaf. They defeat their own ends, too, for their letters are never legible, and they
have to write again to explain their meaning, thus paying another penny away in postage.

Why do we not make a stand against the old forms? Why should we always tread in the footmarks
of our ancestors, instead of making tracks of our own? "Dear Mr. So-and-So," we write to a
man almost a stranger to us. Imagine his surprise if we addressed him so to his face! And we
end in just such a foolish and unreasonable way, "Yours obediently, faithfully, truly!" Where
is the sense? Your signature should be quite enough. You have to be so careful, too, in saying
whether you are obedient, faithful, or affectionate to your correspondent. If you end too warmly,
by mistake, the whole letter has to be written again. It is not a thing you can scratch out
or correct. It would look so very bad.

People have different ideas of "Christmasing." Some prefer to adopt an unsteady gait, and to
spend the night in a ditch or a police-station; some have a taste for family parties; some
like it better by themselves, and some go right away and spend the time at a different place
every year. These last are, I think, by far the most sensible. It is a mistake to have land-marks
to remind you how time is running on, how friends have left, how the loved ones have passed
away. The vacant place appears even more empty. The old happy times show out even happier in
contrast to the present. You cannot enjoy yourself or forget the past, for

    "A sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things."

It is far better to go away somewhere to places which recall no sorrows or recollections and
have no associations with the years gone by.

He is growing such a foolish old man is Father Christmas. He rarely visits us now with hoary
head, his garments sparkling with frost and snow. He is tired of all that. He likes a change
of fashion, like everybody else. He either comes so thickly enveloped in yellow fog that you
can scarcely distinguish the old man, or else he arrives so drenched with rain and splashed
up to the beard in mud that we scarcely like to open our doors to him.

He is growing old, I suppose, and trembling on the brink of second childhood, so we must not
blame him. But still he is not a very great favorite of mine, and I cannot refrain from echoing
the complaint in one of the comic papers--"Why doesn't he strike, like the rest?"

CHAPTER VII.

ON THE COUNTRY.

At which season, I wonder, is the country most lovely, most enjoyable! Is it in the spring,
with its richly-colored carpet, its young green leaves, its delicious perfumes, its glorious
freshness? Ah, why cannot we, like the trees, put off our old sinful world-steeped habits,
and year by year bud out in purest innocence once again? The hedges, but a week ago barren
and bare, are now clothed in brightest apparel, the greenest of cloaks thrown over them, lifting
up their heads and sharing in the general rejoicing, in the glory of their annual resurrection.
Is it in summer, with its myriads of blooms, and its thousand thousand happy voices, the silent
torpid river, basking in the light of the sun, and responding only to the fishes as they frisk
near the surface? Or is it in the autumn, with its many shades, with its long avenues on which
nature has lavished whole tubes of burnt sienna and vermilion; when you tread on gorgeous paths
heavy with golden leaves? Oh, why are we not as lovely in our autumn of life as nature is in
hers? Why, when she decks herself in the gayest coloring, do we don our soberest garb? We do
not gain in splendor as we grow older. We lose our beauties and our charms one by one, till
at last we stand destitute. Oh, cruel Time to treat us so!

    "Time that doth transfix the flourish set on youth,
    And delves the parallels in Beauty's brow."

And yet "God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb." While He takes from us our youth He also
takes away the inclination to be young. We pine for the happy days of childhood; yet, if the
power were given us, who would wish himself back in the past? We feel we should always like
to be young, but should we not get very weary of the world, should we not wish for some kind
of change?

Or is nature at her best when the year is dead and the earth puts on her spotless white shroud,
when everything around has fallen asleep, and only robins are left to join in the wake?

Unanswerable question. There are too many opinions. Some prefer winter, some summer; some like
the heat, some like the cold. Only in one thing do we agree, and that is, in our taste for
variety, for change. Much as we admire the country, lovely as it is, it would not suit many
to live there all the year round. The peace and quiet of our woodland scenes make us enjoy
the town life all the more, while the unceasing turmoil of the season makes us hail with delight
the idea of once more being

    "Far from the madding crowd."

The very thought refreshes you. There is something exhilarating in our journey country-wards,
long and tiring though it may be. Few people care about a railway journey, and yet with one
or two kindred spirits I think it most enjoyable.

Traveling alone in the midst of strangers, you do feel rather melancholy. You try to read,
and when you are tired of chasing the words up and down the page, you look out of the window
and admire the scenery as you flit past until your eyes ache to such an extent you are obliged
to withdraw your gaze and be satisfied with the study of human nature, as far as it can be
procured from the inmates of your compartment. Finally you go to sleep, only to wake up after
a few minutes, to find the eyes of all your fellow passengers upon you, and this serves to
make you nervous and uncomfortable. You dare not close your eyes again. You feel sure it is
the signal for everyone to turn in your direction, and you will not gratify them.

Then comes luncheon time, when we all begin to grow fidgety, and take surreptitious looks at
our watches, and then glance round at our companions to see if anyone is taking the first plunge.
Hopeless quest! Nobody ever will be the first to begin to eat in a railway carriage. Why is
it, I wonder? Are they afraid none of the others will follow suit, and they be left to eat
all alone? It would be nervous work, certainly. You would feel so dreadfully greedy, and yet
if you offered any of your fellow travelers even a sandwich, they would peek up their heads,
give you an astonished look, and decline shortly but with decision. You are made to feel you
have insulted them, and yet they had such a hungry expression! Rarely indeed, though, do you
undergo such an experience. You only have to rise, and reach down your basket, and behold!
the next moment all the carriage is feeding. We are nothing but sheep after all. One leads
the way, and we all follow.

When you have once made a start, eating on a railway journey is easy enough work; it is when
you grow thirsty that the difficulty comes in. You pour the sherry, claret, whatever you have
(some take milk in a green bottle--not a very tempting beverage to look at!) on to the floor,
over your gown, on your neighbor's foot (thereby eliciting a most unholy frown from the recipient
of your bounty), anywhere, indeed, except in your glass. Even if you are fortunate enough to
catch a few drops, it is another Herculæan effort to take it to your mouth. No, drinking in
the train, while it is in motion, requires years of practice.

Then again, your fellow passengers are not always all that can be desired. Often they are neither
pleasant in themselves nor interesting as a study. I traveled with an awful old lady the other
day. She had six small packages with her in the carriage, besides her hand-bag and umbrellas
and half the contents of an extra luggage van. The long-suffering porter who had looked after
her boxes and finally put her in the train, was crimson with his exertions. The generous lady,
having searched several pockets before finding the necessary coin, bestowed on him a threepenny
piece for his trouble! "Thank yer, mum," he went off muttering grimly, "I'll bore a 'ole in
the middle and 'ang it round my neck."

This good dame never ceased to worry all through the journey. She pulled her things from under
the seat and put them up in the rack, and then reversed their locality. At each station she
called frantically to the guard to know where she was and if she ought to change. Finally,
when we reached our destination, it was proved that she had taken her ticket to one place and
had her luggage labelled to another; and there she was, standing on the platform gesticulating
violently, while the train was steaming off with her belongings. What happened I do not know,
for I was hurried off by my friends; but I should think it would be long before she and her
luggage met again.

Fortunately she never knew how near she was to her death. If ever I had murderous intentions
in my heart, it was on that journey north.
