CERTAIN DIVERSITIES OF AMERICAN LIFE

By Charles Dudley Warner

This is a very interesting age. Within the memory of men not yet come to middle life the time
of the trotting horse has been reduced from two minutes forty seconds to two minutes eight
and a quarter seconds. During the past fifteen years a universal and wholesome pastime of boys
has been developed into a great national industry, thoroughly organized and almost altogether
relegated to professional hands, no longer the exercise of the million but a spectacle for
the million, and a game which rivals the Stock Exchange as a means of winning money on the
difference of opinion as to the skill of contending operators.

The newspapers of the country--pretty accurate and sad indicators of the popular taste--devote
more daily columns in a week's time to chronicling the news about base-ball than to any other
topic that interests the American mind, and the most skillful player, the pitcher, often college
bred, whose entire prowess is devoted to not doing what he seems to be doing, and who has become
the hero of the American girl as the Olympian wrestler was of the Greek maiden and as the matador
is of the Spanish senorita, receives a larger salary for a few hours' exertion each week than
any college president is paid for a year's intellectual toil. Such has been the progress in
the interest in education during this period that the larger bulk of the news, and that most
looked for, printed about the colleges and universities, is that relating to the training,
the prospects and achievements of the boat crews and the teams of base-ball and foot-ball,
and the victory of any crew or team is a better means of attracting students to its college,
a better advertisement, than success in any scholastic contest. A few years ago a tournament
was organized in the North between several colleges for competition in oratory and scholarship;
it had a couple of contests and then died of inanition and want of public interest.

During the period I am speaking of there has been an enormous advance in technical education,
resulting in the establishment of splendid special schools, essential to the development of
our national resources; a growth of the popular idea that education should be practical,--that
is, such an education as can be immediately applied to earning a living and acquiring wealth
speedily,--and an increasing extension of the elective system in colleges,--based almost solely
on the notion, having in view, of course, the practical education, that the inclinations of
a young man of eighteen are a better guide as to what is best for his mental development and
equipment for life than all the experience of his predecessors.

In this period, which you will note is more distinguished by the desire for the accumulation
of money than far the general production of wealth, the standard of a fortune has shifted from
a fair competence to that of millions of money, so that he is no longer rich who has a hundred
thousand dollars, but he only who possesses property valued at many millions, and the men most
widely known the country through, most talked about, whose doings and sayings are most chronicled
in the journals, whose example is most attractive and stimulating to the minds of youth, are
not the scholars, the scientists, the men of, letters, not even the orators and statesmen,
but those who, by any means, have amassed enormous fortunes. We judge the future of a generation
by its ideals.

Regarding education from the point of view of its equipment of a man to make money, and enjoy
the luxury which money can command, it must be more and more practical, that is, it must be
adapted not even to the higher aim of increasing the general wealth of the world, by increasing
production and diminishing waste both of labor and capital, but to the lower aim of getting
personal possession of it; so that a striking social feature of the period is that one-half--that
is hardly an overestimate --one-half of the activity in America of which we speak with so much
enthusiasm, is not directed to the production of wealth, to increasing its volume, but to getting
the money of other people away from them. Instrumental music, however, has been opposed by the
older members, and here as in some of the other societies it has been introduced only after prolonged
discussion.
This society has no debts, and has never suffered from the unfaithfulness
of agents or trustees.

It appears, therefore, that speed,-the ability to move rapidly from place to place,--a disproportionate
reward of physical over intellectual science, an intense desire to be rich, which is strong
enough to compel even education to grind in the mill of the Philistines, and an inordinate
elevation in public consideration of rich men simply because they are rich, are characteristics
of this little point of time on which we stand. They are not the only characteristics; in a
reasonably optimistic view, the age is distinguished for unexampled achievements, and for opportunities
for the well-being of humanity never before in all history attainable. But these characteristics
are so prominent as to beget the fear that we are losing the sense of the relative value of
things in this life.

Few persons come to middle life without some conception of these relative values. It is in
the heat and struggle that we fail to appreciate what in the attainment will be most satisfactory
to us. After it is over we are apt to see that our possessions do not bring the happiness we
expected; or that we have neglected to cultivate the powers and tastes that can make life enjoyable.
We come to know, to use a truism, that a person's highest satisfaction depends not upon his
exterior acquisitions, but upon what he himself is. There is no escape from this conclusion.
The physical satisfactions are limited and fallacious, the intellectual and moral satisfactions
are unlimited. In the last analysis, a man has to live with himself, to be his own companion,
and in the last resort the question is, what can he get out of himself. In the end, his life
is worth just what he has become. And I need not say that the mistake commonly made is as to
relative values,--that the things of sense are as important as the things of the mind. You
make that mistake when you devote your best energies to your possession of material substance,
and neglect the enlargement, the training, the enrichment of the mind. You make the same mistake
in a less degree, when you bend to the popular ignorance and conceit so far as to direct your
college education to sordid ends. The certain end of yielding to this so-called practical spirit
was expressed by a member of a Northern State legislature who said, "We don't want colleges,
we want workshops." It was expressed in another way by a representative of the lower house
in Washington who said, "The average ignorance of the country has a right to be represented
here." It is not for me to say whether it is represented there. Naturally, I say, we ought
by the time of middle life to come to a conception of what sort of things are of most value.
By analogy, in the continual growth of the Republic, we ought to have a perception of what
we have accomplished and acquired, and some clear view of our tendencies. We take justifiable
pride in the glittering figures of our extension of territory, our numerical growth, in the
increase of wealth, and in our rise to the potential position of almost the first nation in
the world. A more pertinent inquiry is, what sort of people have we become? What are we intellectually
and morally? For after all the man is the thing, the production of the right sort of men and
women is all that gives a nation value. When I read of the establishment of a great industrial
centre in which twenty thousand people are employed in the increase of the amount of steel
in the world, before I decide whether it would be a good thing for the Republic to create another
industrial city of the same sort, I want to know what sort of people the twenty thousand are,
how they live, what their morals are, what intellectual life they have, what their enjoyment
of life is, what they talk about and think about, and what chance they have of getting into
any higher life. It does not seem to me a sufficient gain in this situation that we are immensely
increasing the amount of steel in the world, or that twenty more people are enabled on account
of this to indulge in an unexampled, unintellectual luxury. We want more steel, no doubt, but
haven't we wit enough to get that and at the same time to increase among the producers of it
the number of men and women whose horizons are extended, who are companionable, intelligent
beings, adding something to the intellectual and moral force upon which the real progress of
the Republic depends?

There is no place where I would choose to speak more plainly of our national situation today
than in the South, and at the University of the South; in the South, because it is more plainly
in a transition state, and at the University of the South, because it is here and in similar
institutions that the question of the higher or lower plane of life in the South is to be determined.

To a philosophical observer of the Republic, at the end of the hundred years, I should say
that the important facts are not its industrial energy, its wealth, or its population, but
the stability of the federal power, and the integrity of the individual States. That is to
say, that stress and trial have welded us into an indestructible nation; and not of less consequence
is the fact that the life of the Union is in the life of the States. The next most encouraging
augury for a great future is the marvelous diversity among the members of this republican body.
If nothing would be more speedily fatal to our plan of government than increasing centralization,
nothing would be more hopeless in our development than increasing monotony, the certain end
of which is mediocrity.

Speaking as one whose highest pride it is to be a citizen of a great and invincible Republic
to those whose minds kindle with a like patriotism, I can say that I am glad there are East
and North and South, and West, Middle, Northwest, and Southwest, with as many diversities of
climate, temperament, habits, idiosyncrasies, genius, as these names imply. Thank Heaven we
are not all alike; and so long as we have a common purpose in the Union, and mutual toleration,
respect, and sympathy, the greater will be our achievement and the nobler our total development,
if every section is true to the evolution of its local traits. The superficial foreign observer
finds sameness in our different States, tiresome family likeness in our cities, hideous monotony
in our villages, and a certain common atmosphere of life, which increasing facility of communication
tends to increase. This is a view from a railway train. But as soon as you observe closely,
you find in each city a peculiar physiognomy, and a peculiar spirit remarkable considering
the freedom of movement and intercourse, and you find the organized action of each State sui
generis to a degree surprising considering the general similarity of our laws and institutions.
In each section differences of speech, of habits of thought, of temperament prevail. Massachusetts
is unlike Louisiana, Florida unlike Tennessee, Georgia is unlike California, Pennsylvania is
unlike Minnesota, and so on, and the unlikeness is not alone or chiefly in physical features.
By the different style of living I can tell when I cross the line between Connecticut and New
York as certainly as when I cross the line between Vermont and Canada. The Virginian expanded
in Kentucky is not the same man he was at home, and the New England Yankee let loose in the
West takes on proportions that would astonish his grandfather. Everywhere there is a variety
in local sentiment, action, and development. Sit down in the seats of the State governments
and study the methods of treatment of essentially the common institutions of government, of
charity and discipline, and you will be impressed with the variety of local spirit and performance
in the Union. And this, diversity is so important, this contribution of diverse elements is
so necessary to the complex strength and prosperity of the whole, that one must view with alarm
all federal interference and tendency to greater centralization.

And not less to be dreaded than monotony from the governmental point of view, is the obliteration
of variety in social life and in literary development. It is not enough for a nation to be
great and strong, it must be interesting, and interesting it cannot be without cultivation
of local variety. Better obtrusive peculiarities than universal sameness. It is out of variety
as well as complexity in American life, and not in homogeneity and imitation, that we are to
expect a civilization noteworthy in the progress of the human race.

Let us come a little closer to our subject in details. For a hundred years the South was developed
on its own lines, with astonishingly little exterior bias. This comparative isolation was due
partly to the institution of slavery, partly to devotion to the production of two or three
great staples. While its commercial connection with the North was intimate and vital, its literary
relation with the North was slight. With few exceptions Northern authors were not read in the
South, and the literary movement of its neighbors, such as it was, from 1820 to 1860, scarcely
affected it. With the exception of Louisiana, which was absolutely ignorant of American literature
and drew its inspiration and assumed its critical point of view almost wholly from the French,
the South was English, but mainly English of the time of Walter Scott and George the Third.
While Scott was read at the North for his knowledge of human nature, as he always will be read,
the chivalric age which moves in his pages was taken more seriously at the South, as if it
were of continuing importance in life. In any of its rich private libraries you find yourself
in the age of Pope and Dryden, and the classics were pursued in the spirit of Oxford and Cambridge
in the time of Johnson. It was little disturbed by the intellectual and ethical agitation of
modern England or of modern New England. During this period, while the South excelled in the
production of statesmen, orators, trained politicians, great judges, and brilliant lawyers,
it produced almost no literature, that is, no indigenous literature, except a few poems and--a
few humorous character-sketches; its general writing was ornately classic, and its fiction
romantic on the lines of the foreign romances.

From this isolation one thing was developed, and another thing might in due time be expected.
The thing developed was a social life, in the favored class, which has an almost unique charm,
a power of being agreeable, a sympathetic cordiality, an impulsive warmth, a frankness in the
expression of emotion, and that delightful quality of manner which puts the world at ease and
makes life pleasant. The Southerners are no more sincere than the Northerners, but they have
less reserve, and in the social traits that charm all who come in contact with them, they have
an element of immense value in the variety of American life.

The thing that might have been expected in due time, and when the call came--and it is curious
to note that the call and cause of any renaissance are always from the outside--was a literary
expression fresh and indigenous. This expectation, in a brief period since the war, has been
realized by a remarkable performance and is now stimulated by a remarkable promise. The acclaim
with which the Southern literature has been received is partly due to its novelty, the new
life it exhibited, but more to the recognition in it of a fresh flavor, a literary quality
distinctly original and of permanent importance. S----, the watch, informed the physician that
E---- raved so violently a moment before that he bound his arms to his body by passing a surcingle
around both, and he quickly became himself. At another time one of the females took a handful
of living coals in her bare hands, and thus carried them about the room without even injuring
the cuticle of the skin.

"The phenomena and excitement soon dwindled away by the tremendous opposition directed against
them; and when afterward spoken about, were designated by the sinister
phrase--'The Devil's Visitation.'

"Other ministrations and gifts,
original and perfectly illustrative of the inspirations of crude and
uncivilized spirits, continued as usual to exist.

They were truly ludicrous.
 There was awakening,
investigation, questioning, doubt. There was a great deal of froth thrown to the surface. In
the free action of individual thought and expression grew eccentricities of belief and of practice,
and a crop of so-called "isms," more or less temporary, unprofitable, and pernicious. Public
opinion attained an astonishing degree of freedom,--I never heard of any community that was
altogether free of its tyranny. At least extraordinary latitude was permitted in the development
of extreme ideas, new, fantastic, radical, or conservative. For instance, slavery was attacked
and slavery was defended on the same platform, with almost equal freedom. Indeed, for many
years, if there was any exception to the general toleration it was in the social ostracism
of those who held and expressed extreme opinions in regard to immediate emancipation, and were
stigmatized as abolitionists. There was a general ferment of new ideas, not always fruitful
in the direction taken, but hopeful in view of the fact that growth and movement are better
than stagnation and decay. You can do something with a ship that has headway; it will drift
upon the rocks if it has not. With much foam and froth, sure to attend agitation, there was
immense vital energy, intense life.

Out of this stir and agitation came the aggressive, conquering spirit that carried civilization
straight across the continent, that built up cities and States, that developed wealth, and
by invention, ingenuity, and energy performed miracles in the way of the subjugation of nature
and the assimilation of societies. Out of this free agitation sprang a literary product, great
in quantity and to some degree distinguished in quality, groups of historians, poets, novelists,
essayists, biographers, scientific writers. A conspicuous agency of the period was the lecture
platform, which did something in the spread and popularization of information, but much more
in the stimulation of independent thought and the awakening of the mind to use its own powers.

Along with this and out of this went on the movement of popular education and of the high and
specialized education. More remarkable than the achievements of the common schools has been
the development of the colleges, both in the departments of the humanities and of science.
If I were writing of education generally, I might have something to say of the measurable disappointment
of the results of the common schools as at present conducted, both as to the diffusion of information
and as to the discipline of the mind and the inculcation of ethical principles; which simply
means that they need improvement. But the higher education has been transformed, and mainly
by the application of scientific methods, and of the philosophic spirit, to the study of history,
economics, and the classics. When we are called to defend the pursuit of metaphysics or the
study of the classics, either as indispensable to the discipline or to the enlargement of the
mind, we are not called on to defend the methods of a generation ago. The study of Greek is
no longer an exercise in the study of linguistics or the inspection of specimens of an obsolete
literature, but the acquaintance with historic thought, habits, and polity, with a portion
of the continuous history of the human mind, which has a vital relation to our own life.

However much or little there may be of permanent value in the vast production of northern literature,
judged by continental or even English standards, the time has came when American scholarship
in science, in language, in occidental or oriental letters, in philosophic and historical methods,
can court comparison with any other. In some branches of research the peers of our scholars
must be sought not in England but in Germany. So that in one of the best fruits of a period
of intellectual agitation, scholarship, the restless movement has thoroughly vindicated itself.

I have called your attention to this movement in order to say that it was neither accidental
nor isolated. It was in the historic line, it was fed and stimulated by all that had gone before,
and by all contemporary activity everywhere. New England, for instance, was alert and progressive
because it kept its doors and windows open. It was hospitable in its intellectual freedom,
both of trial and debate, to new ideas. It was in touch with the universal movement of humanity
and of human thought and speculation. You lose some quiet by this attitude, some repose that
is pleasant and even desirable perhaps, you entertain many errors, you may try many useless
experiments, but you gain life and are in the way of better things. New England, whatever else
we may say about it, was in the world. There was no stir of thought, of investigation, of research,
of the recasting of old ideas into new forms of life, in Germany, in France, in Italy, in England,
anywhere, that did not touch it and to which it did not respond with the sympathy that common
humanity has in the universal progress. It kept this touch not only in the evolution and expression
of thought and emotion which we call literature (whether original or imitative), but in the
application of philosophic methods to education, in the attempted regeneration of society and
the amelioration of its conditions by schemes of reform and discipline, relating to the institutions
of benevolence and to the control of the vicious and criminal. With all these efforts go along
always much false sentimentality and pseudo-philanthropy, but little by little gain is made
that could not be made in a state of isolation and stagnation.

In fact there is one historic stream of human thought, aspiration, and progress; it is practically
continuous, and with all its diversity of local color and movement it is a unit. If you are
in it, you move; if you are out of it, you are in an eddy. The eddy may have a provincial current,
but it is not in the great stream, and when it has gone round and round for a century, it is
still an eddy, and will not carry you anywhere in particular. The value of the modern method
of teaching and study is that it teaches the solidarity of human history, the continuance of
human thought, in literature, government, philosophy, the unity of the divine purpose, and
that nothing that has anywhere befallen the human race is alien to us.

I am not undervaluing the part, the important part, played by conservatism, the conservatism
that holds on to what has been gained if it is good, that insists on discipline and heed to
the plain teaching of experience, that refuses to go into hysterics of enthusiasm over every
flighty suggestion, or to follow every leader simply because he proposes something new and
strange--I do not mean the conservatism that refuses to try anything simply because it is new,
and prefers to energetic life the stagnation that inevitably leads to decay. Isolation from
the great historic stream of thought and agitation is stagnation. While this is true, and always
has been true in history, it is also true, in regard to the beneficent diversity of American
life, which is composed of so many elements and forces, as I have often thought and said, that
what has been called the Southern conservatism in respect to beliefs and certain social problems,
may have a very important part to play in the development of the life of the Republic.

I shall not be misunderstood here, where the claims of the higher life are insisted on and
the necessity of pure, accurate scholarship is recognized, in saying that this expectation
in regard to the South depends upon the cultivation and diffusion of the highest scholarship
in all its historic consciousness and critical precision. They are usually healthy, though in some
communes they have a habit of doctoring themselves for fancied diseases. In almost all the Shaker
communes I found hospitals, or "nurse-shops," as they call them,
but oftenest they were empty. Everywhere indeed, in our industrial age,--in a society
inclined to materialism, scholarship, pure and simple scholarship for its own sake, no less
in Ohio than in Tennessee, is the thing to be insisted on. If I may refer to an institution,
which used to be midway between the North and the South, and which I may speak of without suspicion
of bias, an institution where the studies of metaphysics, the philosophy of history, the classics
and pure science are as much insisted on as the study of applied sciences, the College of New
Jersey at Princeton, the question in regard to a candidate for a professorship or instructorship,
is not whether he was born North or South, whether he served in one army or another or in neither,
whether he is a Democrat or a Republican or a Mugwump, what religious denomination he belongs
to, but is he a scholar and has he a high character? There is no provincialism in scholarship.
