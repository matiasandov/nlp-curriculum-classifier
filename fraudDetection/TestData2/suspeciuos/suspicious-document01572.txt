Such was the catastrophe of a man, so incapable of all the posts he had occupied, who displayed
chimeras and audacity in the place of prudence and sagacity, who everywhere appeared a trifler
and a comedian, and whose universal and profound ignorance (except of the meanest arts of the
courtier) made plainly visible the thin covering of probity and of virtue with which he tried
to hide his ingratitude, his mad ambition, his desire to overturn all in order to make himself
the chief of all, in the midst of his weakness and his fears, and to hold a helm he was radically
incapable of managing.  I speak here only of his conduct since the establishment of the regency.
Elsewhere, in more than one place, the little or nothing he was worth has been shown; how his
ignorance and his jealousy lost us Flanders, and nearly ruined the State; how his felicity
was pushed to the extreme, and what deplorable reverses followed his return.  Sufficient to
say that he never recovered from the state into which this last madness threw him, and that
the rest of his life was only bitterness, regret, contempt!  He had persuaded the King that
it was he, alone, who by vigilance and precaution had preserved his life from poison that others
wished to administer to him.  This was the source of those tears shed by the King when Villeroy
was carried off, and of his despair when Frejus disappeared.  He did not doubt that both had
been removed in order that this crime might be more easily committed.

The prompt return of Frejus dissipated the half, of his fear, the continuance of his good health
delivered him by degrees from the other. The preceptor, who had a great interest in preserving
the King, and who felt much relieved by the absence of Villeroy, left nothing undone in order
to extinguish these gloomy ideas; and consequently to let blame fall upon him who had inspired
them.  He feared the return of the Marechal when the King, who was approaching his majority,
should be the master; once delivered of the yoke he did not wish it to be reimposed upon him.
He well knew that the grand airs, the ironies, the authoritative fussiness in public of the
Marechal were insupportable to his Majesty, and that they held together only by those frightful
ideas of poison.  To destroy them was to show the Marechal uncovered, and worse than that to
show to the King, without appearing to make a charge against the Marechal, the criminal interest
he had in exciting these alarms, and the falsehood and atrocity of such a venomous invention.
These reflections; which the health of the King each day confirmed, sapped all esteem, all
gratitude, and left his Majesty in full liberty of conscience to prohibit, when he should be
the master, all approach to his person on the part of so vile and so interested an impostor.

Frejus made use of these means to shelter himself against the possibility of the Marechal's
return, and to attach himself to the King without reserve.  The prodigious success of his schemes
has been only too well felt since.

The banishment of Villeroy, flight and return of Frejus, and installation of Charost as governor
of the King, were followed by the confirmation of his Majesty by the Cardinal de Rohan, and
by his first communion, administered to him by this self-same Cardinal, his grand almoner.

CHAPTER CXV

Villeroy being banished, the last remaining obstacle in Dubois' path was removed.  There was
nothing: now, to hinder him from being proclaimed prime minister.  I had opposed it as stoutly
as I could; but my words were lost upon M. le Duc d'Orleans.  Accordingly, about two o'clock
in the afternoon of the 23rd of August, 1722, Dubois was declared prime minister by the Regent,
and by the Regent at once conducted to the King as such.

After this event I began insensibly to withdraw from public affairs. Before the end of the
year the King was consecrated at Rheims.  The disorder at the ceremony was inexpressible. 
All precedent was forgotten. Rank was hustled and jostled, so to speak, by the crowd.  The
desire to exclude the nobility from all office and all dignity was obvious, at half a glance.
My spirit was ulcerated at this; I saw approaching the complete re-establishment of the bastards;
my heart was cleft in twain, to see the Regent at the heels of his unworthy minister.  He was
a prey to the interest, the avarice, the folly, of this miserable wretch, and no remedy possible.
Whatever experience I might have had of the astonishing weakness of M. le Duc d'Orleans, it
had passed all bounds when I saw him with my own eyes make Dubois prime minister, after all
I had said to him on the subject,--after all he had said to me.  The year 1723 commenced, and
found me in this spirit.  It is at the end of this year I have determined to end those memoirs,
and the details of it will not be so full or so abundant as of preceding years.  I was hopelessly
wearied with M. le Duc d'Orleans; I no longer approached this poor prince (with so many great
and useless talents buried in him)--except with repugnance. I could not help feeling for him
what the poor, Israelites said to themselves in the desert about the manna: "Nauseat anima
mea suffer cibum istum tevissimum."  I no longer deigned to speak to him.  He perceived this:
I felt he was pained at it; he strove to reconcile me to him, without daring, however, to speak
of affairs, except briefly, and with constraint, and yet he could not hinder himself from speaking
of them. I scarcely took the trouble to reply to him, and I cut his conversation as short as
possible.  I abridged and curtailed my audiences with him; I listened to his reproaches with
coldness.  In fact, what had I to discuss with a Regent who was no longer one, not even over
himself, still less over a realm plunged in disorder?

Cardinal Dubois, when he met me, almost courted me.  He knew not how to catch me.  The bonds
which united me to M. le Duc d'Orleans had always been so strong that the prime minister, who
knew their strength, did not dare to flatter himself he could break them.  His resource was
to try to disgust me by inducing his master to treat me with a reserve which was completely
new to him, and which cost him more than it cost me; for, in fact, he had often found my confidence
very useful to him, and had grown accustomed to it.  As for me, I dispensed with his friendship
more than willingly, vexed at being no longer able to gather any fruit from it for the advantage
of the State or himself, wholly abandoned as he was to his Paris pleasures and to his minister.
The conviction of my complete inutility more and more kept me in the background, without the
slightest suspicion that different conduct could be dangerous to me, or that, weak and abandoned
to Dubois as was the Regent, the former could ever exile me, like the Duc de Roailles, and
Cariillac, or disgust me into exiling myself.  I followed, then, my accustomed life.  That
is to say, never saw M. le Duc d'Orleans except tete-a-tete, and then very seldom at intervals
that each time grew longer, coldly, briefly, never talking to him of business, or, if he did
to me, returning the conversation, and replying it! a manner to make it drop.  Acting thus,
it is easy to see that I was mixed up in nothing, and what I shall have to relate now will
have less of the singularity and instructiveness of good and faithful memoirs, than of the
dryness and sterility of the gazettes.

First of all I will finish my account of Cardinal Dubois.  I have very little more to say of
him; for he had scarcely begun to enjoy his high honours when Death came to laugh at him for
the sweating labour he had taken to acquire them.

On the 11th of June, 1723, the King went to reside at Meudon, ostensibly in order that the
chateau of Versailles might be cleared--in reality, to accommodate Cardinal Dubois.  He had
just presided over the assembly of the day, and flattered to the last degree at this, wished
to repose upon the honour.  He desired, also, to be present sometimes at the assembling of
the Company of the Indies.  Meudon brought him half-way to Paris, and saved him a journey.
His debauchery had so shattered his health that the movement of a coach gave him pains which
he very carefully hid.

The King held at Meudon a review of his household, which in his pride the Cardinal must needs
attend.  It cost him dear.  He mounted on horseback the better, to enjoy his triumph; he suffered
cruelly, and became so violently ill that he was obliged to have assistance.  The most celebrated
doctors and physicians were called in, with great secrecy. They shook their heads, and came
so often that news of the illness began to transpire.  Dubois was unable to go to Paris again
more than once or twice, and then with much trouble, and solely to conceal his malady, which
gave him no repose.

He left nothing undone, in fact, to hide it from the world; he went as often as he could to
the council; apprised the ambassadors he would go to Paris, and did not go; kept himself invisible
at home, and bestowed the most frightful abuse upon everybody who dared to intrude upon him.
On Saturday, the 7th of August, he was so ill that the doctors declared he must submit to an
operation, which was very urgent, and without which he could hope to live but a few days; because
the abscess he had having burst the day he mounted on horseback, gangrene had commenced, with
an overflow of pus, and he must be transported, they added, to Versailles, in order to undergo
this operation.  The trouble this terrible announcement caused him, so overthrew him that he
could not be moved the next day, Sunday, the 8th; but on Monday he was transported in a litter,
at five o'clock in the morning.

After having allowed him to repose himself a, little, the doctors and surgeons proposed that
he should receive the sacrament, and submit to the operation immediately after.  This was not
heard very peacefully; he had scarcely ever been free from fury since the day of the review;
he had grown worse on Saturday, when the operation was first announced to him. Nevertheless,
some little time after, he sent for a priest from Versailles, with whom he remained alone about
a quarter of an hour. Such a great and good man, so well prepared for death, did not need more:
Prime ministers, too, have privileged confessions.  As his chamber again filled, it was proposed
that he should take the viaticum; he cried out that that was soon said, but there was a ceremonial
for the cardinals, of which he was ignorant, and Cardinal Bissy must be sent to, at Paris,
for information upon it.  Everybody looked at his neighbour, and felt that Dubois merely wished
to gain time; but as the operation was urgent, they proposed it to him without further delay.
He furiously sent them away, and would no longer hear talk of it.

The faculty, who saw the imminent danger of the slightest delay, sent to Meudon for M. le Duc
d'Orleans, who instantly came in the first conveyance he could lay his hands on.  He exhorted
the Cardinal to suffer the operation; then asked the faculty, if it could be performed in safety.
They replied that they could say nothing for certain, but that assuredly the Cardinal had not
two hours to live if he did not instantly agree to it.  M. le Duc d'Orleans returned to the
sick man, and begged him so earnestly to do so, that he consented.

The operation was accordingly performed about five o'clock, and in five minutes, by La Peyronie,
chief surgeon of the King, and successor to Marechal, who was present with Chirac and others
of the most celebrated surgeons and doctors.  The Cardinal cried and stormed strongly.  M.
le Duc d'Orleans returned into the chamber directly after the operation was performed, and
the faculty did not dissimulate from him that, judging by the nature of the wound, and what
had issued from it, the Cardinal had not long to live.  He died, in fact, twenty-four hours
afterwards, on the 10th, of August, at five o'clock in the morning, grinding his teeth against
his surgeons and against Chirac, whom he had never ceased to abuse.

Extreme unction was, however, brought to him.  Of the communion, nothing more was said--or
of any priest for him--and he finished his life thus, in the utmost despair, and enraged at
quitting it.  Fortune had nicely played with him; slid made him dearly and slowly buy her favours
by all sorts of trouble, care, projects, intrigues, fears, labour, torment; and at last showered
down upon him torrents of greater power, unmeasured riches, to let him enjoy them only four
years (dating from the time when he was made Secretary of State, and only two years dating
from the time when he was made Cardinal and Prime Minister), and then snatched them from him,
in the smiling moment when he was most enjoying them, at sixty- six years of age.

He died thus, absolute master of his master, less a prime minister than an all-powerful minister,
exercising in full and undisturbed liberty the authority and the power of the King; he was
superintendent of the post, Cardinal, Archbishop of Cambrai, had seven abbeys, with respect
to which he was insatiable to the last; and he had set on foot overtures in order to seize
upon those of Citeaux, Premonte, and others, and it was averred that he received a pension
from England of 40,000 livres sterling!  I had the curiosity to ascertain his revenue, and
I have thought what I found curious enough to be inserted here, diminishing some of the benefices
to avoid all exaggeration.  I have made a reduction, too, upon what he drew from his place
of prime minister, and that of the post.  I believe, also, that he had 20,000 livres from the
clergy, as Cardinal, but I do not know it as certain.  What he drew from Law was immense. 
He had made use of a good deal of it at Rome, in order to obtain his Cardinalship; but a prodigious
sum of ready cash was left in his hands.  He had an extreme quantity of the most beautiful
plate in silver and enamel, most admirably worked; the richest furniture, the rarest jewels
of all kinds, the finest and rarest horses of all countries, and the most superb equipages.
His table was in every way exquisite and superb, and he did the honours of it very well, although
extremely sober by nature and by regime.

The place of preceptor of M. le Duc d'Orleans had procured for him the Abbey of Nogent-sous-Coucy;
the marriage of the Prince that of Saint- Just; his first journeys to Hanover and England,
those of Airvause and of Bourgueil: three other journeys, his omnipotence.  What a monster
of Fortune!  With what a commencement, and with what an end!

On Wednesday evening, the day after his death, Dubois was carried from Versailles to the church
of the chapter of Saint-Honore, in Paris, where he was interred some days after.  Each of the
academies of which he was a member had a service performed for him (at which they were present),
the assembly of the clergy had another (he being their president); and as prime minister he
had one at Notre Dame, at which the Cardinal de Noailles officiated, and at which the superior
courts were present. There was no funeral oration at any of them.  It could not be hazarded.
His brother, more modest than he, and an honest man, kept the office of secretary of the cabinet,
which he had, and which the Cardinal had given him.  This brother found an immense heritage.
He had but one son, canon of Saint-Honore, who had never desired places or livings, and who
led a good life.  He would touch scarcely anything of this rich succession. He employed a part
of it in building for his uncle a sort of mausoleum (fine, but very modest, against the wall,
at the end of the church, where the Cardinal is interred, with a Christian-like inscription),
and distributed the rest to the poor, fearing lest this money should bring a curse upon him.

It was found some time after his death that the Cardinal had been long married, but very obscurely!
He paid his wife to keep silent when he received his benefices; but when he dawned into greatness
became much embarrassed with her.  He was always in agony lest she should come forward and
ruin him.  His marriage had been made in Limousin, and celebrated in a village church.  When
he was named Archbishop of Cambrai he resolved to destroy the proofs of this marriage, and
employed Breteuil, Intendant of Limoges, to whom he committed the secret, to do this for him
skilfully and quietly.

Breteuil saw the heavens open before him if he could but succeed in this enterprise, so delicate
and so important.  He had intelligence, and knew how to make use of it.  He goes to this village
where the marriage had been celebrated, accompanied by only two or three valets, and arranges
his journey so as to arrive at night, stops at the cure's house, in default of an inn, familiarly
claims hospitality like a man surprised by the night, dying of hunger and thirst, and unable
to go a step further.

The good cure; transported with gladness to lodge M. l'Intendant, hastily prepared all there
was in the house, and had the honour of supping with him, whilst his servant regaled the two
valets in another room, Breteuil having sent them all away in order to be alone with his host.
Breteuil liked his glass and knew how to empty it.  He pretended to find the supper good and
the wine better.  The cure, charmed with his guest, thought only of egging him on, as they
say in the provinces.  The tankard was on the table, and was drained again and again with a
familiarity which transported the worthy priest.  Breteuil; who had laid his project, succeeded
in it, and made the good man so drunk that he could not keep upright, or see, or utter a word.
When Breteuil had brought him to this state, and had finished him off with a few more draughts
of wine, he profited by the information he had extracted from him during the first quarter
of an hour of supper.  He had asked if his registers were in good order, and how far they extended,
and under pretext of safety against thieves, asked him where he kept them, and the keys of
them, so that the moment Breteuil was certain the cure could no longer make use of his senses,
he took his keys, opened the cupboard, took from it the register of the marriage of the year
he wanted, very neatly detached the page he sought (and woe unto that marriage registered upon
the same page), put it in his pocket, replaced the registers where he had found them, locked
up the cupboard, and put back the keys in the place he had taken them from.  His only thought
after this was to steal off as soon as the dawn appeared, leaving the good cure snoring away
the effects of the wine, and giving, some pistoles to the servant.

He went thence to the notary, who had succeeded to the business and the papers of the one who
had made the contract of marriage; liked himself up with him, and by force and authority made
him give up the minutes of the marriage contract.  He sent afterwards for the wife of Dubois
(from whose hands the wily Cardinal had already obtained the copy of the contract she possessed),
threatened her with dreadful dungeons if she ever dared to breathe a word of her marriage,
and promised marvels to her if she kept silent.

He assured her, moreover, that all she could say or do would be thrown away, because everything
had been so arranged that she could prove nothing, and that if she dared to speak, preparations
were made for condemning her as a calumniator and impostor, to rot with a shaven head in the
prison of a convent!  Breteuil placed these two important documents in the hands of Dubois,
and was (to the surprise and scandal of all the world) recompensed, some time after, with the
post of war secretary, which, apparently; he had done nothing to deserve, and for which he
was utterly unqualified.  The secret reason of his appointment was not discovered until long after.

Dubois' wife did not dare to utter a whisper.  She came to Paris after the death of her husband.
A good proportion was given to her of what was left.  She lived obscure, but in easy circumstances,
and died at Paris more than twenty years after the Cardinal Dubois, by whom she had had no
children.  The brother lived on very good terms with her.  He was a village doctor when Dubois
sent for him to Paris: In the end this history was known, and has been neither contradicted
nor disavowed by anybody.

We have many examples of prodigious fortune acquired by insignificant people, but there is
no example of a person so destitute of all talent (excepting that of low intrigue), as was
Cardinal Dubois, being thus fortunate.  His intellect was of the most ordinary kind; his knowledge
the most common-place; his capacity nil; his exterior that of a ferret, of a pedant; his conversation
disagreeable, broken, always uncertain; his falsehood written upon his forehead; his habits
too measureless to be hidden; his fits of impetuosity resembling fits of madness; his head
incapable of containing more than one thing at a time, and he incapable of following anything
but his personal interest; nothing was sacred with him; he had no sort of worthy intimacy with
any one; had a declared contempt for faith, promises, honour, probity, truth; took pleasure
at laughing at all these things; was equally voluptuous and ambitious, wishing to be all in
all in everything; counting himself alone as everything, and whatever was not connected with
him as nothing; and regarding it as the height of madness to think or act otherwise.  With
all this he was soft, cringing, supple, a flatterer, and false admirer, taking all shapes with
the greatest facility, and playing the most opposite parts in order to arrive at the different
ends he proposed to himself; and nevertheless was but little capable of seducing.  His judgment
acted by fits and starts, was involuntarily crooked, with little sense or clearness; he was
disagreeable in spite of himself. Nevertheless, he could be funnily vivacious when he wished,
but nothing more, could tell a good story, spoiled, however, to some extent by his stuttering,
which his falsehood had turned into a habit from the hesitation he always had in replying and
in speaking.  With such defects it is surprising that the only man he was able to seduce was
M. le Duc d'Orleans, who had so much intelligence, such a well-balanced mind, and so much clear
and rapid perception of character.  Dubois gained upon him as a child while his preceptor;
he seized upon him as a young man by favouring his liking for liberty, sham fashionable manners
and debauchery, and his disdain of all rule.  He ruined his heart, his mind, and his habits,
by instilling into him the principles of libertines, which this poor prince could no more deliver
himself from than from those ideas of reason, truth, and conscience which he always took care
to stifle.

Dubois having insinuated himself into the favour of his master in this manner, was incessantly
engaged in studying how to preserve his position. He never lost sight of his prince, whose
great talents and great defects he had learnt how to profit by.  The Regent's feebleness was
the main rock upon which he built.  As for Dubois' talent and capacity, as I have before said,
they were worth nothing.  All his success was due to his servile pliancy and base intrigues.

When he became the real master of the State he was just as incompetent as before.  All his
application was directed towards his master, and it had for sole aim that that master should
not escape him.  He wearied himself in watching all the movements of the prince, what he did,
whom he saw, and for how long; his humour, his visage, his remarks at the issue of every audience
and of every party; who took part in them, what was said and by whom, combining all these things;
above all, he strove to frighten everybody from approaching the Regent, and kept no bounds
with any one who had the temerity to do so without his knowledge and permission.  This watching
occupied all his days, and by it he regulated all his movements. This application, and the
orders he was obliged to give for appearance sake, occupied all his time, so that he became
inaccessible except for a few public audiences, or for others to the foreign ministers.  Yet
the majority of those ministers never could catch him, and were obliged to lie in wait for
him upon staircases or in passages, where he did not expect to meet them.  Once he threw into
the fire a prodigious quantity of unopened letters, and then congratulated himself upon having
got rid of all his business at once.  At his death thousands of letters were found unopened.

Thus everything was in arrear, and nobody, not even the foreign ministers, dared to complain
to M. le Duc d'Orleans, who, entirely abandoned to his pleasures, and always on the road from
Versailles to Paris, never thought of business, only too satisfied to find himself so free,
and attending to nothing except the few trifles he submitted to the King under the pretence
of working with his Majesty.  Thus, nothing could be settled, and all was in chaos.  To govern
in this manner there is no need for capacity.  Two words to each minister charged with a department,
and some care in garnishing the councils attended by the King, with the least important despatches
(settling the others with M. le Duc d'Orleans) constituted all the labour of the prime minister;
and spying, scheming, parade, flatteries, defence, occupied all his time.  His fits of passion,
full of insults and blackguardism, from which neither man nor woman, no matter of what rank,
was sheltered, relieved him from an infinite number of audiences, because people preferred
going to subalterns, or neglecting their business altogether, to exposing themselves to this
fury and these affronts.

The mad freaks of Dubois, especially when he had become master, and thrown off all restraint,
would fill a volume.  I will relate only one or two as samples.  His frenzy was such that he
would sometimes run all round the chamber, upon the tables and chairs, without touching the
floor!  M. le Duc d'Orleans told me that he had often witnessed this.

Another sample:

The Cardinal de Gesvres came over to-day to complain to M. le Duc d'Orleans that the Cardinal
Dubois had dismissed him in the most filthy terms.  On a former occasion, Dubois had treated
the Princesse de Montauban in a similar manner, and M. le Duc d'Orleans had replied to her
complaints as he now replied to those of the Cardinal de Gesvres.  He told the Cardinal, who
was a man of good manners, of gravity, and of dignity (whereas the Princess deserved what she
got) that he had always found the counsel of the Cardinal Dubois good, and that he thought
he (Gesvres ) would do well to follow the advice just given him!  Apparently it was to free
himself from similar complaints that he spoke thus; and, in fact, he had no more afterwards.

Another sample:

Madame de Cheverny, become a widow, had retired to the Incurables.  Her place of governess
of the daughters of M. le Duc d'Orleans had been given to Madame de Conflans.  A little while
after Dubois was consecrated, Madame la Duchesse d'Orleans asked Madame de Conflans if she
had called upon him.  Thereupon Madame de Conflans replied negatively and that she saw no reason
for going, the place she held being so little mixed up in State affairs.  Madame la Duchesse
d'Orleans pointed out how intimate the Cardinal was with M. le Duc d'Orleans.  Madame de Conflans
still tried to back out, saying that he was a madman, who insulted everybody, and to whom she
would not expose herself.  She had wit and a tongue, and was supremely vain, although very
polite.  Madame la Duchesse d'Orleans burst out laughing at her fear, and said, that having
nothing to ask of the Cardinal, but simply to render an account to him of the office M. le
Duc d'Orleans had given her, it was an act of politeness which could only please him, and obtain
for her his regard, far from having anything disagreeable, or to be feared about it; and finished
by saying to her that it was proper, and that she wished her to go.

She went, therefore, for it was at Versailles, and arrived in a large cabinet, where there
were eight or ten persons waiting to speak to the Cardinal, who was larking with one of his
favourites, by the mantelpiece. Fear seized upon Madame de Conflans, who was little, and who
appeared less.  Nevertheless, she approached as this woman retired.  The Cardinal, seeing her
advance, sharply asked her what she wanted.

"Monseigneur," said she,--"Oh, Monseigneur--"

"Monseigneur," interrupted the Cardinal, "I can't now."

"But, Monseigneur," replied she--

"Now, devil take me, I tell you again," interrupted the Cardinal, "when I say I can't, I can't."

"Monseigneur," Madame de Conflans again said, in order to explain that she wanted nothing;
but at this word the Cardinal seized her by the shoulders; and pushed her out, saying, "Go
to the devil, and let me alone."

She nearly fell over, flew away in fury, weeping hot tears, and reached, in this state, Madame
la Duchesse d'Orleans, to whom, through her sobs, she related the adventure.

People were so accustomed to the insults of the Cardinal, and this was thought so singular
and so amusing, that the recital of it caused shouts of laughter, which finished off poor Madame
de Conflans, who swore that, never in her life, would she put foot in the house of this madman.

The Easter Sunday after he was made Cardinal, Dubois woke about eight o'clock, rang his bells
as though he would break them, called for his people with the most horrible blasphemies, vomited
forth a thousand filthy expressions and insults, raved at everybody because he had not been
awakened, said that he wanted to say mass, but knew not how to find time, occupied as he was.
After this very beautiful preparation, he very wisely abstained from saying mass, and I don't
know whether he ever did say it after his consecration.

He had taken for private secretary one Verrier, whom he had unfrocked from the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pres,
the business of which he had conducted for twenty years, with much cleverness and intelligence.
He soon accommodated himself to the humours of the Cardinal, and said to him all he pleased.

One morning he was with the Cardinal, who asked for something that could not at once be found.
Thereupon Dubois began to blaspheme, to storm against his clerks, saying that if he had not
enough he would engage twenty, thirty, fifty, a hundred, and making the most frightful din.
Verrier tranquilly listened to him.  The Cardinal asked him if it was not a terrible thing
to be so ill-served, considering the expense he was put to; then broke out again, and pressed
him to reply.

"Monseigneur," said Verrier, "engage one more clerk, and give him, for sole occupation, to
swear and storm for you, and all will go well; you will have much more time to yourself and
will be better served."

The Cardinal burst out laughing, and was appeased.

Every evening he ate an entire chicken for his supper.  I know not by whose carelessness, but
this chicken was forgotten one evening by his people.  As he was about to go to bed he bethought
him of his bird, rang, cried out, stormed against his servants, who ran and coolly listened
to him.  Upon this he cried the more, and complained of not having been served.  He was astonished
when they replied to him that he had eaten his chicken, but that if he pleased they would put
another down to the spit.

"What!" said he, "I have eaten my chicken!"

The bold and cool assertion of his people persuaded him, and they laughed at him.

I will say no more, because, I repeat it, volumes might be filled with these details.  I have
said enough to show what was this monstrous personage, whose death was a relief to great and
little, to all Europe, even to his brother, whom he treated like a negro.  He wanted to dismiss
a groom on one occasion for having lent one of his coaches to this same brother, to go somewhere
in Paris.

The most relieved of all was M. le Duc d'Orleans.  For a long time he had groaned in secret
beneath the weight of a domination so harsh, and of chains he had forged for himself.  Not
only he could no longer dispose or decide upon anything, but he could get the Cardinal to do
nothing, great or small, he desired done.  He was obliged, in everything, to follow the will
of the Cardinal, who became furious, reproached him, and stormed at him when too much contradicted.
The poor Prince felt thus the abandonment into which he had cast himself, and, by this abandonment,
the power of the Cardinal, and the eclipse of his own power.  He feared him; Dubois had become
insupportable to him; he was dying with desire, as was shown in a thousand things, to get rid
of him, but he dared not--he did not know how to set about it; and, isolated and unceasingly
wretched as he was, there was nobody to whom he could unbosom himself; and the Cardinal, well
informed of this, increased his freaks, so as to retain by fear what he had usurped by artifice,
and what he no longer hoped to preserve in any other way.

As soon as Dubois was dead, M. le Duc d'Orleans returned to Meudon, to inform the King of the
event.  The King immediately begged him to charge himself with the management of public affairs,
declared him prime minister, and received, the next day, his oath, the patent of which was
immediately sent to the Parliament, and verified.  This prompt declaration was caused by the
fear Frejus had to see a private person prime minister.  The King liked M. le Duc d'Orleans,
as we have already seen by the respect he received from him, and by his manner of working with
him.  The Regent, without danger of being taken at his word, always left him master of all
favours, and of the choice of persons he proposed to him; and, besides, never bothered him,
or allowed business to interfere with his amusements.  In spite of all the care and all the
suppleness Dubois had employed in order to gain the spirit of the King, he never could succeed,
and people remarked, without having wonderful eyes, a very decided repugnance of the King for
him.  The Cardinal was afflicted, but redoubled his efforts, in the hope at last of success.
But, in addition to his own disagreeable manners, heightened by the visible efforts he made
to please, he had two enemies near the King, very watchful to keep him away from the young
prince--the Marechal de Villeroy, while he was there, and Frejus, who was much more dangerous,
and who was resolved to overthrow him.  Death, as we have seen, spared him the trouble.

The Court returned from Meudon to Paris on the 13th of August.  Soon after I met M. le Duc
d'Orleans there.

As soon as he saw me enter his cabinet he ran to me, and eagerly asked me if I meant to abandon
him.  I replied that while his Cardinal lived I felt I should be useless to him, but that now
this obstacle was removed, I should always be very humbly at his service.  He promised to live
with me on the same terms as before, and, without a word upon the Cardinal, began to talk about
home and foreign affairs.  If I flattered myself that I was to be again of use to him for any
length of time, events soon came to change the prospect.  But I will not anticipate my story.

CHAPTER CXVI

The Duc de Lauzun died on the 19th of November, at the age of ninety years and six months.
The intimate union of the two sisters I and he had espoused, and our continual intercourse
at the Court (at Marly, we had a pavilion especially for us four), caused me to be constantly
with him, and after the King's death we saw each other nearly every day at Paris, and unceasingly
frequented each other's table.  He was so extraordinary a personage, in every way so singular,
that La Bruyere, with much justice, says of him in his "Characters," that others were not allowed
to dream as he had lived.  For those who saw him in his old age, this description seems even
more just.  That is what induces me to dwell upon him here. He was of the House of Caumont,
the branch of which represented by the Ducs de la Force has always passed for the eldest, although
that of Lauzun has tried to dispute with it.

The mother of M. de Lauzun was daughter of the Duc de la Force, son of the second Marechal
Duc de la Force, and brother of the Marechale de Turenne, but by another marriage; the Marechale
was by a first marriage. The father of M. de Lauzun was the Comte de Lauzun, cousin-german
of the first Marechal Duc de Grammont, and of the old Comte de Grammont.

M. de Lauzun was a little fair man, of good figure, with a noble and expressively commanding
face, but which was without charm, as I have heard people say who knew him when he was young.
He was full of ambition, of caprice, of fancies; jealous of all; wishing always to go too far;
never content with anything; had no reading, a mind in no way cultivated, and without charm;
naturally sorrowful, fond of solitude, uncivilised; very noble in his dealings, disagreeable
and malicious by nature, still more so by jealousy and by ambition; nevertheless, a good friend
when a friend at all, which was rare; a good relative; enemy even of the indifferent; hard
upon faults, and upon what was ridiculous, which he soon discovered; extremely brave, and as
dangerously bold. As a courtier he was equally insolent and satirical, and as cringing as a
valet; full of foresight, perseverance, intrigue, and meanness, in order to arrive at his ends;
with this, dangerous to the ministers; at the Court feared by all, and full of witty and sharp
remarks which spared nobody.
