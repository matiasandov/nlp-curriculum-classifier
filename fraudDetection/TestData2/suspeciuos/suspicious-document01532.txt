"Capot me if I know," said the Captain. "He deserved it sure enough; but he is an old man,
and a minister of state, and there would be more risk than credit in meddling with him. You
had more need to think of making up to Miss Lucy Ashton the disgrace that's like to fall upon
her than of interfering with a man too old to fight, and on too high a tool for your hand to
reach him."

"It SHALL reach him, though, one day," said Bucklaw, "and his kinsman Ravenswood to boot. In
the mean time, I'll take care Miss Ashton receives no discredit for the slight they have put
upon her. It's an awkward job, however, and I wish it were ended; I scarce know how to talk
to her,--but fill a bumper, Craigie, and we'll drink her health. It grows late, and a night-cowl
of good claret is worth all the considering-caps in Europe."

CHAPTER XXIX.

     Comedy of Errors.

THE next morning saw Bucklaw and his faithful Achates, Craigengelt, at Ravenswood Castle. They
were most courteously received by the knight and his lady, as well, as by their son and heir,
Colonel Ashton. After a good deal of stammering and blushing--for Bucklaw, notwithstanding
his audacity in other matters, had all the sheepish bashfulness common to those who have lived
little in respectable society--he contrived at length to explain his wish to be admitted to
a conference with Miss Ashton upon the subject of their approaching union. Sir William and
his son looked at Lady Ashton, who replied with the greatest composure, "That Lucy would wait
upon Mr. Hayston directly. I hope," she added with a smile, "that as Lucy is very young, and
has been lately trepanned into an engagement of which she is now heartily ashamed, our dear
Bucklaw will excuse her wish that I should be present at their interview?"

"In truth, my dear lady," said Bucklaw, "it is the very thing that I would have desired on
my own account; for I have been so little accustomed to what is called gallantry, that I shall
certainly fall into some cursed mistake unless I have the advantage of your ladyship as an
interpreter."

It was thus that Bucklaw, in the perturbation of his embarrassment upon this critical occasion,
forgot the just apprehensions he had entertained of Lady Ashton's overbearing ascendency over
her daughter's mind, and lost an opportunity of ascertaining, by his own investigation, the
real state of Lucy's feelings.

The other gentlemen left the room, and in a shrot time Lady Ashton, followed by her daughter,
entered the apartment. She appeared, as he had seen her on former occasions, rather composed
than agitated; but a nicer judge than he could scarce have determined whether her calmness
was that of despair or of indifference. Bucklaw was too much agitated by his own feelings minutely
to scrutinise those of the lady. He stammered out an unconnected address, confounding together
the two or three topics to which it related, and stopt short before he brought it to any regular
conclusion. Miss Ashton listened, or looked as if she listened, but returned not a single word
in answer, continuing to fix her eyes on a small piece of embroidery on which, as if by instinct
or habit, her fingers were busily employed. Lady Ashton sat at some distance, almost screened
from notice by the deep embrasure of the window in which she had placed her chair. From this
she whispered, in a tone of voice which, though soft and sweet, had something in it of admonition,
if not command: "Lucy, my dear, remember--have you heard what Bucklaw has been saying?"

The idea of her mother's presence seemed to have slipped from the unhappy girl's recollection.
She started, dropped her needle, and repeated hastily, and almost in the same breath, the contradictory
answers: "Yes, madam--no, my lady--I beg pardon, I did not hear."

There is nothing so fallacious or misleading in history as the popular
tendency to trace the causes of a great war to one source alone, or
to fix upon the most recent events leading up to it, as the principal
or even the sole cause of the outbreak of war.

The occasion of an event may not be, and often is not, the cause of it. The occasion of this war was
not its cause. In the present case it is extraordinary to note how almost the whole of Europe
appears to be carried away with the idea that the causes of this terrible South African war
are, as it were, only of yesterday's date. The seeds of which we are reaping so woeful a harvest
were not sown yesterday, nor a few years ago only.

We are reaping a harvest which has been ripening for a century past.

At the time of the Indian Mutiny, it was given out and believed by the world in general that
the cause of that hideous revolt was a supposed attempt on the part of England to impose upon
the native army of India certain rules which, from their point of view, outraged their religion
in some of its most sacred aspects; (I refer to the legend of the greased cartridges). After the
mutiny was over, Sir Herbert Edwardes, a true Seer, whose insight enabled him to look far below
the surface, and to go back many years into the history of our dealings with India in order
to take in review all the causes of the rebellion, addressed an exhaustive report to the British
Government at home, dealing with those causes which had been accumulating for half-a-century or
more. This was a weighty document,--one which it would be worth while to re-peruse at the present
day; it had its influence in leading the Home Government to acknowledge some grave errors which
had led up to this catastrophe, and to make an honest and persevering attempt to remedy past
evils. That this attempt has not been in vain, in spite of all that India has had to suffer, has
been acknowledged gratefully by the Native delegates to the great
Annual Congress in India of the past year.

In the case of the Indian Mutiny, the incident of the supposed insult to their religious feelings
was only the match which set light to a train which had been long laid. In the same way the honest
historian will find, in the present case, that the events,--the "tragedy
of errors," as they have been called,--of recent date, are but the
torch that has set fire to a long prepared mass of combustible material
which had been gradually accumulating in the course of a century. But all this
is nothing to the purpose; for since I have mustered up courage to make a plain proposal, I
would fain hear Miss Ashton, from her own lips, give me a plain answer."

"My dear Bucklaw," said Lady Ashton, "let me spare Lucy's bashfulness. I tell you, in her presence,
that she has already consented to be guided by her father and me in this matter. Lucy, my love,"
she added, with that singular combination of suavity of tone and pointed energy which we have
already noticed--"Lucy, my dearest love! speak for yourself, is it not as I say?"

Her victim answered in a tremulous and hollow voice: "I HAVE promised to obey you--but upon
one condition."

"She means," said Lady Ashton, turning to Bucklaw, "she expects an answer to the demand which
she has made upon the man at Vienna, or Ratisbon, or Paris--or where is he?--for restitution
of the engagement in which he had the art to involve her. You will not, I am sure, my dear
friend, think it is wrong that she should feel much delicacy upon this head; indeed, it concerns
us all."

"Perfectly right--quite fair," said Bucklaw, half humming, half speaking the end of the old song--

     "It is best to be off wi' the old love
     Before you be on wi' the new.

But I thought," said he, pausing, "you might have had an answer six times told from Ravenswood.
D--n me, if I have not a mind to go fetch one myself, if Miss Ashton will honour me with the
commission."

"By no means," said Lady Ashton; "we have had the utmost difficulty of preventing Douglas,
for whom it would be more proper, from taking so rash a step; and do you think we could permit
you, my good friend, almost equally dear to us, to go to a desperate man upon an errand so
desperate? In fact, all the friends of the family are of opinion, and my dear Lucy herself
ought so to think, that, as this unworthy person has returned no answer to her letter, silence
must on this, as in other cases, be held to give consent, and a contract must be supposed to
be given up, when the party waives insisting upon it. Sir William, who should know best, is
clear upon this subject; and therefore, my dear Lucy----"

"Madam," said Lucy, with unwonted energy, "urge me no farther; if this unhappy engagement be
restored, I have already said you shall dispose of me as you will; till then I should commit
a heavy sin in the sight of God and man in doing what you require." "But, my love, if this
man remains obstinately silent----"

"He will NOT be silent," answered Lucy; "it is six weeks since I sent him a double of my former
letter by a sure hand."

"You have not--you could not--you durst not," said Lady Ashton, with violence inconsistent
with the tone she had intended to assume; but instantly correcting herself, "My dearest Lucy,"
said she, in her sweetest tone of expostulation, "how could you think of such a thing?"

"No matter," said Bucklaw; "I respect Miss Ashton for her sentiments, and I only wish I had
been her messenger myself."

"And pray how long, Miss Ashton," said her mother, ironically, "are we to wait the return of
your Pacolet--your fairy messenger--since our humble couriers of flesh and blood could not
be trusted in this matter?"

"I have numbered weeks, days, hours, and minutes," said Miss Ashton; "within another week I
shall have an answer, unless he is dead. Till that time, sir," she said, addressing Bucklaw,
"let me be thus far beholden to you, that you will beg my mother to forbear me upon this subject."

"I will make it my particular entreaty to Lady Ashton," said Bucklaw. "By my honour, madam,
I respect your feelings; and, although the prosecution of this affair be rendered dearer to
me than ever, yet, as I am a gentleman, I would renounce it, were it so urged as to give you
a moment's pain."

"Mr. Hayston, I think, cannot comprehend that," said Lady Ashton, looking pale with anger,
"when the daughter's happiness lies in the bosom of the mother. Let me ask you, Miss Ashton,
in what terms your last letter was couched?"

"Exactly in the same, madam," answered Lucy, "which you dictated on a former occasion."

"When eight days have elapsed, then," said her mother, resuming her tone of tenderness, "we
shall hope, my dearest love, that you will end this suspense."

"Miss Ashton must not be hurried, madam," said Bucklaw, whose bluntness of feeling did not
by any means arise from want of good-nature; "messengers may be stopped or delayed. I have
known a day's journey broke by the casting of a foreshoe. Stay, let me see my calendar: the
twentieth day from this is St. Jude's, and the day before I must be at Caverton Edge, to see
the match between the Laird of Kittlegirth's black mare and Johnston the meal-monger's four-year-old-colt;
but I can ride all night, or Craigie can bring me word how the match goes; and I hope, in the
mean time, as I shall not myself distress Miss Ashton with any further importunity, that your
ladyship yourself, and Sir William, and Colonel Douglas will have the goodness to allow her
uninterrupted time for making up her mind."

"Sir," said Miss Ashton, "you are generous."

"As for that, madam," answered Bucklaw, "I only pretend to be a plain, good-humoured young
fellow, as I said before, who will willingly make you happy if you will permit him, and show
him how to do so." Having said this, he saluted her with more emotion than was consistent with
his usual train of feeling, and took his leave; Lady Ashton, as she accompanied him out of
the apartment, assuring him that her daughter did full justice to the sincerity of his attachment,
and requesting him to see Sir William before his departure, "since," as she said, with a keen
glance reverting towards Lucy, "against St. Jude's day, we must all be ready to SIGN AND SEAL."

"To sign and seal!" echoed Lucy, in a muttering tone, as the door of the apartment closed--"to
sign and seal--to do and die!" and, clasping her extenuated hands together, she sunk back on
the easy-chair she occupied, in a state resembling stupor.

From this she was shortly after awakened by the boisterous entry of her brother Henry, who
clamorously reminded her of a promise to give him two yards of carnation ribbon to make knots
to his new garters. With the most patient composure Lucy arose, and opening a little ivory
cabinet, sought out the ribbon the lad waned, measured it accurately, cut it off into proper
lengths, and knotted it into the fashion his boyish whim required.

"Dinna shut the cabinet yet," said Henry, "for I must have some of your silver wire to fasten
the bells to my hawk's jesses,--and yet the new falcon's not worth them neither; for do you
know, after all the plague we had to get her from an eyrie, all the way at Posso, in Mannor
Water, she's going to prove, after all, nothing better than a rifler: she just wets her singles
in the blood of the partridge, and then breaks away, and lets her fly; and what good can the
poor bird do after that, you know, except pine and die in the first heather-cow or whin-bush
she can crawl into?"

"Right, Henry--right--very right," said Luch, mournfully, holding the boy fast by the hand,
after she had given him the wire he wanted; "but there are more riflers in the world than your
falcon, and more wounded birds that seek but to die in quiet, that can find neither brake nor
whin-bush to hide their head in."

"Ah! that's some speech out of your romances," said the boy; "and Sholto says they have turned
your head. But I hear Norman whistling to the hawk; I must go fasten on the jesses."

And he scampered away with the thoughtless gaiety of boyhood, leaving his sister to the bitterness
of her own reflections.

"It is decreed," she said, "that every living creature, even those who owe me most kindness,
are to shun me, and leave me to those by whom I am beset. It is just it should be thus. Alone
and uncounselled, I involved myself in these perils; alone and uncounselled, I must extricate
myself or die."

CHAPTER XXX.

     Comedy of Errors.

AS some vindication of the ease with which Bucklaw (who otherwise, as he termed himself, was
really a very good-humoured fellow) resigned his judgment to the management of Lady Ashton,
while paying his addresses to her daughter, the reader must call to mind the strict domestic
discipline which, at this period, was exercised over the females of a Scottish family.

The manners of the country in this, as in many other respects, coincided with those of France
before the Revolution. Young women of the higher rank seldom mingled in society until after
marriage, and, both in law and fact, were held to be under the strict tutelage of their parents,
who were too apt to enforce the views for their settlement in life without paying any regard
to the inclination of the parties chiefly interested. On such occasions, the suitor expected
little more from his bride than a silent acquiescence in the will of her parents; and as few
opportunities of acquaintance, far less of intimacy, occurred, he made his choice by the outside,
as the lovers in the Merchant of Venice select the casket, contented to trust to chance the
issue of the lottery in which he had hazarded a venture.

It was not therefore surprising, such being the general manners of the age, that Mr. Hayston
of Bucklaw, whom dissipated habits had detached in some degree from the best society, should
not attend particularly to those feelings in his elected bride to which many men of more sentiment,
experience, and reflection would, in all probability, have been equally indifferent. He knew
what all accounted the principal point, that her parents and friends, namely, were decidedly
in his favour, and that there existed most powerful reasons for their predilection.

In truth, the conduct of the Marquis of A----, since Ravenswood's departure, had been such
as almost to bar the possibility of his kinsman's union with Lucy Ashton. The Marquis was Ravenswood's
sincere but misjudging friend; or rather, like many friends and patrons, he consulted what
he considered to be his relation's true interest, although he knew that in doing so he run
counter to his inclinations.

The Marquis drove on, therefore, with the plentitude of ministerial authority, an appeal to
the British House of Peers against those judgments of the courts of law by which Sir William
became possessed of Ravenswood's hereditary property. As this measure, enforced with all the
authority of power, was new in Scottish judicial proceedings, though now so frequently resorted
to, it was exclaimed against by the lawyers on the opposite side of politics, as an interference
with the civil judicature of the country, equally new, arbitrary, and tyrannical. And if it
thus affected even strangers connected with them only by political party, it may be guessed
what the Ashton family themselves said and thought under so gross a dispensation. Sir William,
still more worldly-minded than he was timid, was reduced to despair by the loss by which he
was threatened. His son's haughtier spirit was exalted into rage at the idea of being deprived
of his expected patrimony. But to Lady Ashton's yet more vindictive temper the conduct of Ravenswood,
or rather of his patron, appeared to be an offence challenging the deepest and most immortal
revenge. Even the quiet and confiding temper of Lucy herself, swayed by the opinions expressed
by all around her, could not but consider the conduct of Ravenswood as precipitate, and even
unkind. "It was my father," she repeated with a sigh, "who welcomed him to this place, and
encouraged, or at least allowed, the intimacy between us. Should he not have remembered this,
and requited it with at least some moderate degree of procrastination in the assertion of his
own alleged rights? I would have forfeited for him double the value of these lands, which he
pursues with an ardour that shows he has forgotten how much I am implicated in the matter."

Lucy, however, could only murmur these things to herself, unwilling to increase the prejudices
against her lover entertained by all around her, who exclaimed against the steps pursued on
his account as illegal, vexatious, and tyrannical, resembling the worst measures in the worst
times of the worst Stuarts, and a degradation of Scotland, the decisions of whose learned judges
were thus subjected to the review of a court composed indeed of men of the highest rank, and
who were not trained to the study of any municipal law, and might be supposed specially to
hold in contempt that of Scotland. As a natural consequence of the alleged injustice meditated
towards her father, every means was restored to, and every argument urged to induce Miss Ashton
to break off her engagement with Ravenswood, as being scandalous, shameful, and sinful, formed
with the mortal enemy of her family, and calculated to add bitterness to the distress of her
parents. 

It is a crying shame in the Government--"

"What! has the Government failed to appreciate the heroism of Tom Bowles, or rather to restrain
the excesses of its ardour?"

"Stuff! it is a shame in the Government not to have compelled his
father to put him to school. If education were universal--"

"You
think there would be no brutes in particular. It may be so; but education
is universal in China, and so is the bastinado. I thought, however,
that you said the schoolmaster was abroad, and that the age of enlightenment
was in full progress."

She might have borne also in patience, or repelled with scorn, the bitter taunts and occasional
violence of her brother, Colonel Douglas Ashton, and the impertinent and intrusive interference
of other friends and relations. But it was beyond her power effectually to withstand or elude
the constant and unceasing persecution of Lady Ashton, who, laying every other wish aside,
had bent the whol efforts of her powerful mind to break her daughter's contract with Ravenswood,
and to place a perpetual bar between the lovers, by effecting Lucy's union with Bucklaw. And so,
somehow or other, we came together, and got this house and the land from the Squire on lease
very reasonable; and my goodman being well eddyeated, and much thought of, and never being tempted
to drink, now that he had a missis to keep him in order, had a many little things put into his
way. He could help to measure timber, and knew about draining, and he got some bookkeeping from
the farmers about; and we kept cows and pigs and poultry, and so we did very well, specially
as the Lord was merciful and sent us no children."
"And what does the shop bring in a year since your husband died?"

"You
had best judge for yourself. Will you look at the book, and take a
peep at the land and apple-trees? But they's been neglected since
my goodman died." Some of these were of an obvious
description, and require only to be cursorily mentioned; others were characteristic of the
time, the country, and the persons engaged in this singular drama.

It was of the last consequence that all intercourse betwixt the lovers should be stopped, and,
by dint of gold and authority, Lady Ashton contrived to possess herself of such a complete
command of all who were placed around her daughter, that, if fact, no leaguered fortress was
ever more completely blockaded; while, at the same time, to all outward appearance Miss Ashton
lay under no restriction. The verge of her parents' domains became, in respect to her, like
the viewless and enchanted line drawn around a fairy castle, where nothing unpermitted can
either enter from without or escape from within. Thus every letter, in which Ravenswood conveyed
to Lucy Ashton the indispensable reasons which detained him abroad, and more than one note
which poor Lucy had addressed to him through what she thought a secure channel, fell into the
hands of her mother. It could not be but that the tenor of these intercepted letters, especially
those of Ravenswood, should contain something to irritate the passions and fortify the obstinacy
of her into whose hands they fell; but Lady Ashton's passions were too deep-rooted to require
this fresh food. She burnt the papers as regularly as she perused them; and as they consumed
into vapour and tinder, regarded them with a smile upon her compressed lips, and an exultation
in her steady eye, which showed her confidence that the hopes of the writers should soon be
rendered equally unsubstantial.

It usually happens that fortune aids the machinations of those who are prompt to avail themselves
of every chance that offers. A report was wafted from the continent, founded, like others of
the same sort, upon many plausible circumstances, but without any real basis, stating the Master
of Ravenswood to be on the eve of marriage with a foreign lady of fortune and distinction.
This was greedily caught up by both the political parties, who were at once struggling for
power and for popular favour, and who seized, as usual, upon the most private circumstances
in the lives of each other's partisans t convert them into subjects of political discussion.

The Marquis of A---- gave his opinion aloud and publicly, not indeed in the coarse terms ascribed
to him by Captain Craigengelt, but in a manner sufficiently offensive to the Ashtons. "He thought
the report," he said, "highly probably, and heartily wished it might be true. Such a match
was fitter and far more creditable for a spirited young fellow than a marriage with the daughter
of an old Whig lawyer, whose chicanery had so nearly ruined his father."

The other party, of course, laying out of view the opposition which the Master of Ravenswood
received from Miss Ashton's family, cried shame upon his fickleness and perfidy, as if he had
seduced the young lady into an engagement, and wilfully and causelessly abandoned her for another.

Sufficient care was taken that this report should find its way to Ravenswood Castle through
every various channel, Lady Ashton being well aware that the very reiteration of the same rumour,
from so many quarters, could not but give it a semblance of truth. By some it was told as a
piece of ordinary news, by some communicated as serious intelligence; now it was whispered
to Lucy Ashton's ear in the tone of malignant pleasantry, and now transmitted to her as a matter
of grave and serious warning.

Even the boy henry was made the instrument of adding to his sister's torments. One morning
he rushed into the room with a willow branch in his hand, which he told her had arrived that
instant from Germany for her special wearing. When it did cause accident or death, the miners
were prosecuted by the Government, from whose agent they were compelled to buy it, and fined for
having used it!

"At the time the Convention was signed, in 1884, the franchise was obtainable after one year's
residence. President Kruger determined to serve the Uitlanders, however,
as George III.'s Government served the American Colonists, that is,
tax them while refusing them representation in the control of the
taxes. "The devil take me," said he,
"Lucy, if I fetch you any more of these tormenting messages again; for I like you better,"
said he, kissing away the tears, "than the whole pack of them; and you shall have my grey pony
to ride on, and you shall canter him if you like--ay, and ride beyond the village, too, if
you have a mind."

"Who told you," said Lucy, "that I am not permitted to ride where I please?"

"That's a secret," said the boy; "but you will find you can never ride beyond the village but
your horse will cast a she, or fall lame, or the cattle bell will ring, or something will happen
to bring you back. But if I tell you more of these things, Douglas will nto get me the pair
of colours they have promised me, and so good-morrow to you."

This dialogue plunged Lucy in still deeper dejection, as it tended to show her plainly what
she had for some time suspected, that she was little better than a prisoner at large in her
father's house. We have described her in the outset of our story as of a romantic disposition,
delighting in tales of love and wonder, and readily identifying herself with the situation
of those legendary heroines with whose adventures, for want of better reading, her memory had
become stocked. The fairy wand, with which in her solitude she had delighted to raise visions
of enchantment, became now the rod of a magician, the bond slave of evil genii, serving only
to invoke spectres at which the exorcist trembled. She felt herself the object of suspicion,
of scorn, of dislike at least, if not of hatred, to her own family; and it seemed to her that
she was abandoned by the very person on whose account she was exposed to the enmity of all
around her. Indeed, the evidence of Ravenswood's infidelity began to assume every day a more
determined character. A soldier of fortune, of the name of Westenho, an old familiar of Craigengelt's,
chanced to arrive from abroad about this time. The worthy Captain, though without any precise
communication with Lady Ashton, always acted most regularly and sedulously in support of her
plans, and easily prevailed upon his friend, by dint of exaggeration of real circumstances
and coming of others, to give explicit testimony to the truth of Ravenswood's approaching marriage.

Thus beset on all hands, and in a manner reduced to despair, Lucy's temper gave way under the
pressure of constant affliction and persecution. She became gloomy and abstracted, and, contrary
to her natural and ordinary habit of mind, sometimes turned with spirit, and even fierceness,
on those by whom she was long and closely annoyed. Her health also began to be shaken, and
her hectic cheek and wandering eye gave symptoms of what is called a fever upon the spirits.
In most mothers this would have moved compassion; but Lady Ashton, compact and firm of purpose,
saw these waverings of health and intellect with no greater sympathy than that with which the
hostile engineer regards the towers of a beleaguered city as they reel under the discharge
of his artillery; or rather, she considered these starts and inequalities of temper as symptoms
of Lucy's expiring resolution; as the angler, by the throes and convulsive exertions of the
fish which he has hooked, becomes aware that he soon will be able to land him. To accelerate
the catastrophe in the present case, Lady Ashton had recourse to an expedient very consistent
with the temper and credulity of those times, but which the reader will probably pronounce
truly detestable and diabolical.

CHAPTER XXXI.

     Faerie Queene.

THE health of Lucy Ashton soon required the assistance of a person more skilful in the office
of a sick-nurse than the female domestics of the family. Wounded hearts and desolated families
at home are counted by tens of thousands.

But it needs to be courageously stated by those who have looked a little below the surface that
her faults have not been those which are attributed to her by a large proportion of European countries,
and by a portion of her own people. These appear to attribute this war to a sudden impulse
on her part of Imperial ambition and greed, and to see in the attitude which they attribute to her alone,
the provocative element which was chiefly supplied from the other
side. Such was the avowed profession of Luckie Gourlay,
which, as may well be supposed, was looked upon with a suspicious eye, not only by her neighbours,
but even by the clergy of the district. In private, however, she traded more deeply in the
occult sciences; for, notwithstanding the dreadful punishments inflicted upon the supposed
crime of witchcraft, there wanted not those who, steeled by want and bitterness of spirit,
were willing to adopt the hateful and dangerous character, for the sake of the influence which
its terrors enabled them to exercise in the vicinity, and the wretched emolument which they
could extract by the practice of their supposed art.
