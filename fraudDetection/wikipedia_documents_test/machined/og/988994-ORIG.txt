In 2004, De Ravin was cast to portray Claire Littleton on the hit ABC drama "Lost." Speaking about the success of "Lost", she said: "It's sort of hard to say. You read something and have a good feeling about it, it sounds great, ties nicely together and then shooting something, editing it, the music, the actors involved, everything sort of plays a huge part. Everyone involved had a great feeling towards it, but you never really know." She was a series regular for the first four seasons and the sixth and final season. She was not a regular in season five but was under a holding contract with ABC Network.

In 2005, De Ravin was cast to portray Emily Kostich, the heroin-addicted ex-girlfriend of Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), in the neo-noir film "Brick".

"Onimusha" is postponed for an unknown amount of time and there is not any confirmation if De Ravin will continue the project. De Ravin filmed "Remember Me" in the summer of 2009. The film received its wide release on 12 March 2010. She was a regular on the sixth and final season of "Lost".

She met Janowicz in Los Angeles, and said that "our life together always comes before work. You can't buy love or family." While filming "Lost", De Ravin flew to and from Hawaii "once or twice a week" to return to her home in Burbank, California, which she shared with Janowicz and their poodle.
