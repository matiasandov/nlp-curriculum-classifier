Zach Auguste

Zachary Elias Auguste (Greek: Ζαχαρίας Ηλίας "Ζακ" Όγκαστ; born July 8, 1993) is a Greek-American professional basketball player for Galatasaray of the Turkish Basketbol Süper Ligi (BSL) and the EuroCup. He is a 6'10" (2.08 m) center. 
Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Auguste started playing high school basketball for Marlborough. In 2011, he moved to the university preparatory New Hampton School in New Hampshire, where he was nominated for the 2012 McDonald's All-American Game. After graduating from New Hampton, Auguste enrolled in the University of Notre Dame, to play college basketball for the Fighting Irish. Spending his freshman and sophomore seasons mainly as a reserve player, Auguste rose to prominence during his junior season in 2014–15, when his team won the ACC Tournament title, and went to the NCAA Elite Eight.

Auguste played at Marlborough High School for three seasons, growing 3 inches in each of these seasons. As a junior in 2009–10, Auguste averaged 22 points and received All-Star accolades from the Mid-Wachusett (Central Massachusetts) league and local newspapers the Telegram & Gazette and The MetroWest Daily News. He scored a total 631 points throughout his career at Marlborough.

He moved to university preparatory New Hampton School after that season, reclassifying to the class of 2012. He cited his desire to get academically and physically ready for college as the main factors behind that decision.
After adapting to the higher competition level, he improved dramatically in time, putting on 28 pounds and developing his post game to transition from a perimeter player to a forward. He finished with an average of 15 points and 8 rebounds for his senior season. Nominated for the 2012 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, he didn't make the final selection.

Soon after joining New Hampton, he was noticed by Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) conference Notre Dame's assistant coach Anthony Solomon, however he later cut the school from his selection list, which included Division I schools West Virginia, Georgia Tech, Florida and Marquette. Despite this, Solomon's steadfast attempts to recruit the player, widely ranked a 4-star recruit, convinced Auguste to visit the campus; he committed to Notre Dame on the spot in September 2011.

Auguste made his debut for Notre Dame in a November 12, 2012 victory against Monmouth, contributing 4 points and 3 rebounds in 3 minutes. After two ankle sprains during pre-season practice, Auguste had difficulty breaking into the already established team. Finding himself behind Jack Cooley and Garrick Sherman in the rotation, he averaged 10.7 minutes per game in 25 games.
Notable were games against Kennesaw State (12 points and 7 rebounds in 12 minutes) and Marquette (a season-high 15 points with 5 rebounds and 3 steals in 21 minutes), for a freshman season average of 3.7 points and 2.7 rebounds.

For the 2013–14 season, Auguste was expected to play a larger role after Cooley graduated and coach Mike Brey cited him as a major player. Though he did start 13 games out of 30, he stayed third choice with Sherman and Tom Knight preferred. He recorded his first college double-double against Clemson having 14 points and 12 rebounds, followed by no-shows. He finished his sophomore season with 6.7 points and 4.3 rebounds in nearly 17 minutes per game on average.

Tabbed as a starter during the preseason, Auguste, as one of the team's few post options, established himself as a starter during his junior season with good performances early in the season, albeit against weaker opposition. A memorable December 13, 2014 game against Florida State, in which he scored a career-high 26 points, started what coach Brey described as a run of key contributions from the forward, with Auguste quickly recouping from his bad performances. In January 2015, Auguste was sidelined by Notre Dame due to academic issues, with the length of the suspension undisclosed. It would ultimately only last three days, with the unknown reason later described as minor by the player. Auguste was seen as a major contributor to the Irish's 2015 ACC Tournament title contributing 16 points and 13 rebounds in the final against North Carolina (for an average of more than 11 points and 9 rebounds in the whole tournament).

In the Round of 64 of the following 2015 NCAA Tournament, Auguste scored 25 points against Northeastern, including two under-pressure free-throws in the final minute of a 69-65 close-fought win. In the next round tie against Butler, he committed a double dribble that conceded possession with two seconds left on the clock in a tied 55-55 game. Butler did not score, and in overtime Auguste blocked a shot before grabbing a rebound - a team-leading 13th - as Notre Dame won to reach the Sweet 16. A comfortable win over Wichita State followed (15 points, 6 rebounds and 1 block for Auguste in 26 minutes) and Notre Dame qualified to the Elite Eight for the first time since 1979. Auguste, described as "Notre Dame's only true post player", was predicted to play an important role in the game against undefeated Kentucky, who - in Karl-Anthony Towns and Willie Cauley-Stein - had some of the biggest forwards of the tournament. He had 20 points and nine rebounds in the game, while mostly defended by Towns. In defense against the same player, he could not stop him from scoring 25 points in a to-the-wire 66-68 loss to the favorites. Auguste finished the tournament with 16.8 points and 8.3 rebounds per game, with 12.9 points and 6.5 rebounds in around 24 minutes for the whole 2014-15 season.

Auguste was elected captain by his teammates for his senior season. He was also voted to the Preseason All-ACC second team. Seven games into the 2015-16 season, Auguste tallied his fifth double-double of the season, tying the total of his first three seasons. He was named as one of ten finalists for the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award, also earning third team all-ACC honors for the season. In the quarter final of the 2016 ACC Tournament Auguste led his team to an 84–79 win versus Duke, posting a double-double with 19 points and 22 rebounds, setting the Notre Dame's record for most rebounds in a game and tying Tim Duncan's second best performance in the ACC Tournament.
