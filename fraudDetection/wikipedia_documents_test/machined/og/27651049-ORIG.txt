German submarine U-104 (1940)

German submarine "U-104" was a Type IXB U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II. She was ordered by the "Kriegsmarine" on 24 May 1938 as part of the German naval rearmament program Plan Z. Her keel was laid down by DeSchiMAG AG Weser in Bremen in November 1939. Following about six and a half months of construction, she was launched in May 1940 and formally commissioned into the "Kriegsmarine" in August 1940.

"U-104" had a very short career, sinking just one enemy vessel and damaging one other during one war patrol. In the middle of her first patrol, "U-104" was posted missing off the north coast of Ireland on 28 November 1940 and was presumed sunk in minefield SN 44, which was laid a few days prior to her arrival in the area.

"U-104" was ordered by the "Kriegsmarine" on 24 May 1938 (as part of Plan Z and in violation of the Treaty of Versailles). Her keel was laid down on 10 November 1939 by DeSchiMAG AG Weser in Bremen as yard number 967. "U-104" was launched on 25 May 1940 and commissioned on 19 August of that year under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" Harald Jürst.

German Type IXA submarines were slightly larger than the original German Type IX submarines, later designated IXA. "U-104" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . "U-104" was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a SK C/30 as well as a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.

During her short career, "U-104" sank one enemy vessel and damaged another on her first and only war patrol in the North Sea, off the northern coast of Ireland and Great Britain. She went to sea on her first and only war patrol on 12 November 1940. For a period of 17 days, she roamed the North Sea and eventually the northern coast of Scotland and Ireland in search of any Allied convoys heading to Great Britain. During that time she attacked two enemy vessels, sinking one and damaging the other. On 27 November 1940, "U-104" torpedoed and sank the British merchant vessel "Diplomat", a straggler of convoy HX 88, with the loss of 14 of her crew. The other merchant vessel was the British motor tanker "Charles F. Meyer", of convoy HX 87, which survived the attack. The next day, "U-104" went missing just north of neutral Ireland. She is presumed to have been sunk by a mine from the SN 44 minefield, which was laid on 8 November 1940, just 20 days prior to "U-104"s disappearance. All of her crew are presumed dead.
