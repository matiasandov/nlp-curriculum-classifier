Marguerite S. Church

Marguerite Stitt Church (New York City, September 27, 1892 – Chicago, May 26, 1990) was a psychologist by profession who was elected to her husband Ralph E. Church's congressional seat to complete his term, following his death in office. She continued to represent Illinois' 13th congressional district as a Republican from 1951 to 1963.

Church born in 1892 to William J. and Adelaide Stitt (née Forsythe). She grew up in the New York City metropolitan area where she attended St. Agatha School. She traveled abroad with her parents each summer, which helped develop her interest in foreign countries. In 1914, Church graduated from Wellesley College where she earned a B.A. in psychology, with a minor in economics and sociology. She went on to get a Master's degree from Columbia University in 1917. 

After graduating from Columbia, Church became a consulting psychologist for the State Charities Aid Association of New York City for one year. When her husband, Ralph E. Church, was first elected as a U.S. Representative in 1934, she became closely involved with his work. In March 1950, Ralph died of heart failure during a House committee hearing. Church ran for her husband's now vacant seat and was elected in November 1950 by the highest majority ever had by a candidate from Evanston.

On December 21, 1918, she married Ralph E. Church. The couple settled in Evanston, Illinois and had three children: Ralph Jr., William, and Marjory. She died in Evanston on May 26, 1990.

Church is buried in Memorial Park, Skokie, Illinois.
