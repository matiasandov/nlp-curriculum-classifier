USS Milwaukee (1864)

The first USS "Milwaukee", a double-turreted river monitor, the lead ship of her class, built for the Union Navy during the American Civil War. The ship supported Union forces during the Mobile Campaign as they attacked Confederate fortifications defending the city of Mobile, Alabama in early 1865. She struck a mine in March and sank without loss. Her wreck was raised in 1868 and broken up for scrap that was used in the construction of a bridge in St. Louis, Missouri.

"Milwaukee" was long overall and had a beam of . The ship had a depth of hold of and a draft of . She had 970 tons burthen and displaced . Her crew numbered 138 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two 2-cylinder horizontal non-condensing steam engines, each driving two propellers, using steam generated by seven tubular boilers. The engines were designed to reach a top speed of . "Milwaukee" carried of coal.

The ship's main armament consisted of four smoothbore, muzzle-loading 11-inch Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets. Her forward turret was designed by James Eads and her rear turret by John Ericsson. Each gun weighed approximately and could fire a shell up to a range of at an elevation of +15Â°.

The cylindrical turrets were protected by eight layers of wrought iron plates. The sides of the hull consisted of three layers of one-inch plates, backed by of pine. The deck was heavily cambered to allow headroom for the crew on such a shallow draft and it consisted of iron plates thick. The pilothouse, positioned behind and above the fore turret, was protected by of armor.

James Eads was awarded the contracts for all four of the "Milwaukee"-class ships. He [[Keel|laid down]] "Milwaukee" at his [[Union Iron Works (St. Louis)|Union Iron Works]] [[Carondelet, St. Louis]] in 1862. The first U.S. Navy ship to be named after the [[Milwaukee|Wisconsin city]], she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 4 February 1864 and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 27 August 1864. [[Lieutenant|Acting Volunteer Lieutenant]] James W. Magune was in command.
"Milwaukee" was initially assigned to the [[Mississippi Squadron]] upon commissioning, but saw no action before she was ordered south to join [[West Gulf Blockading Squadron]]. The ship departed [[Mound City, Illinois]] on 15 October and arrived at [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] 12 days later. [[Lieutenant Commander]] James H. Gillis relieved Magune on 22 November. She was still under repair there on 27 November, although "Milwaukee" reached Mobile Bay by 1 January 1865.

Although the victory at the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]] on 5 August 1864 had closed the port of Mobile to [[blockade runner]]s, the city itself had not been taken. The [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] fortified the approaches to the city and heavily mined the shallow waters surrounding it. On 27 March 1865, "Milwaukee", together with several other Union ships, [[sortie]]d upriver in an attempt to cut communications between [[Spanish Fort, Alabama|Spanish Fort]] and Mobile. The following day she and her [[sister ship]] steamed up the Blakely River to attack a Confederate transport and forced it to retreat. While returning downriver "Milwaukee" struck a mine in an area previously swept. She remained afloat forward, which permitted her crew to escape without loss. Another of her sisters, , rescued the survivors.

In 1868 the wreck was raised and towed to St. Louis and broken up; her iron was used in the construction of the [[Eads Bridge]] across the [[Mississippi River]].
