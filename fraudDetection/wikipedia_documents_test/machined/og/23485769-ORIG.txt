Although the Mariners suffered early season woes, the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" praised Fister and fellow starter Jason Vargas as reasons for why the Mariners were not doing worse, stating, "If Doug Fister and Jason Vargas hadn't been excellent at the back end of the rotation, God knows where this club would be."

Doug made a start in Game 4 of the 2013 ALDS against the Oakland Athletics, with the Tigers facing elimination. He gave up three runs and seven hits in six innings of work. The Tigers won the game with a late rally, so Fister did not factor in the decision. In Game 4 of the 2013 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, Fister gave up just one run on eight hits, striking out seven over six innings and earning the win in a 7-3 Tigers victory.

On an August 22 start in Cleveland, Fister allowed a lead off home run to Francisco Lindor to briefly tie the score at 1-1, but this would turn out to be the only hit registered by the Indians as Fister would go on to pitch a complete game 1-hitter and not allow a hit to the final 28 batters faced in the game in an eventual 9-1 Red Sox win.
