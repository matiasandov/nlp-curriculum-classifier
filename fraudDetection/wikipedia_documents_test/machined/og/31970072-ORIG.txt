Egypt at the 2012 Summer Olympics

Egypt competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, from 27 July to 12 August 2012, sending one of its largest delegations ever. A total of 110 Egyptian athletes participated in 83 events across 20 sports, with more women taking part than ever before. The nation's flagbearer in the opening ceremonies was Hesham Mesbah, a judoka who was Egypt's only medalist at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Egypt won two medals during the course of the Games: Alaaeldin Abouelkassem earned silver in the men's foil, becoming the first competitor from an African nation to win a fencing medal, while Karam Gaber captured silver in the men's 84 kg Greco-Roman wrestling event. Two Egyptian weightlifters were awarded medals retroactively, after higher-ranked competitors were disqualified for doping: Abeer Abdelrahman took silver in the women's 75 kg event, while Tarek Yehia, received bronze in the men's 85 kg event. Among other achievements, Mostafa Mansour was the nation's first competitor in sprint canoeing while fencer Shaimaa El-Gammal became the first Egyptian female to appear in four editions of the Olympics.

Prior to 2012, Egypt had sent athletes to nineteen editions of the Summer Olympic Games, the 1906 Intercalated Games, equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics, and the 1984 Winter Olympics. Before the Games began, the Egyptian Olympic Committee distributed counterfeit Nike gear to its athletes, due to its financial troubles following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Nike, however, ended up donating legitimate equipment to the Egyptians. Tamer Bayoumi, a 2004 Olympic bronze medalist and the nation’s most successful taekwondo practitioner at the 2012 Games, was chosen to carry Egypt’s flag at the closing ceremony.

Aside from the team sport of football, which had 16 participants, fencing and wrestling were the sports in which Egypt had the most participants, sending 12 representatives to each. Of them, wrestling was almost exclusively male with only one female, Rabab Eid, taking part. The sport with the most Egyptian female participation was synchronized swimming, an all-woman tournament at the Olympics, with eight, while the nation sent six women to fencing, the highest amount for a mixed sport. Among tournaments with the potential for both men and women to take part, Egypt qualified females, but not males, for badminton, and males, but not females, for track and field athletics, boxing, canoeing, equestrian, football, judo, and sailing.

The following Egyptian athletes won medals at the games. In the by discipline sections below, medalists' names are bolded.

Prior to 2012, Egypt had sent athletes to nineteen editions of the Summer Olympic Games (three times as the United Arab Republic), the 1906 Intercalated Games, equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics, and the 1984 Winter Olympics. With the exception of the Soviet-boycotted 1984 Summer Olympics, Egypt's 2012 delegation was the largest ever, and chose Hesham Mesbah, a 2008 Olympic medalist in judo, as its flagbearer in the opening ceremony. A total of 110 Egyptians, 76 men and 34 women, travelled to London and competed in 20 different sports. It was the largest delegation of women in the country's Olympic history. Prior the start of the Olympic Games, the Egyptian Olympic Committee (EOC) distributed counterfeit Nike gear from a Chinese distributor to its athletes, due to its financial troubles following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. Nike ended up donating equipment to the Egyptians, despite the EOC's eventual willingness to pay.

Shaimaa El-Gammal became the nation's first female to appear in her fourth Olympic games, while former Olympic medalists Tamer Bayoumi (taekwondo), Karam Gaber (Greco-Roman wrestling), and Hesham Mesbah (judo) returned to compete again. Middleweight boxer Mohamed Hikal and skeet shooter Mostafa Hamdy also made a fourth appearance at the Games, while Gaber, Mesbah, and six other athletes made their third Olympic appearance: discus thrower Omar Ahmed El Ghazaly, modern pentathlete Aya Medany, table tennis player El-sayed Lashin, Greco-Roman wrestlers Ashraf El-Gharably and Mohamed Abdelfatah, and judoka Islam El Shehaby. Skeet shooter Mona El-Hawary, aged 49, was the oldest athlete on the team, while sprint freestyle swimmer Farida Osman was the youngest at age 17. Bayoumi was selected as Egypt's flagbearer for the closing ceremony.

Two Egyptian archers, one male and one female, qualified for the Olympics, both of whom earned their berths at the 2012 African Archery Championships. Ahmed El-Nemr finished second at that tournament, behind Philippe Kouassi of Côte d'Ivoire, and entered the men's individual event. El-Nemr had won three medals at the 2011 Pan Arab Games, gold in the individual recurve 90 metres and silver in the individual recurve FITA and the team event. In London he scored 644 points in the ranking round and placed 57th overall out of 64 competitors. In the round of 64 he defeated eighth-ranked Crispin Duenas of Canada three sets to one and then faced Kuo Cheng-wei, who was representing Chinese Taipei.

Nada Kamel, who had earned seven medals at the 2011 Pan Arab Games, won the women's event at the 2012 African Championships and entered the individual tournament. There she scored 611 points in the ranking round and placed 56th overall out of 64 participants. She was defeated by Ksenia Perova of Russia three sets to none in the opening round and finished the event joint-33rd and last.

Seven Egyptian athletes, six men and one woman, qualified for the Olympics, although one did not compete. Noura Elsayed, the lone woman, was slated to run in the 800 metres, but withdrew due to injury. The only Egyptian to participate in more than one event was Amr Ibrahim Mostafa Seoud, a veteran of the 200 metre event at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Seoud, who had won gold medals in the 100 metres at the 2007 Pan Arab and 2011 All-African Games, and the 200 metres at the 2007 Pan Arab and 2009 Mediterranean Games, as well as the 2010 African Championships, met the "A" qualifying standard for both the 100 metres and 200 metres. In the 100 he drew the same heat as world record-holder and defending Olympic champion Usain Bolt of Jamaica and finished fourth, which was insufficient to advance. He had the same result in the opening heats of the 200. Hamada Mohamed met the "A" qualifying standard for the 800 metres and won his opening heat in London, advancing to the semifinals. He was placed in the same heat as David Rudisha of Kenya, the world-record holder and upcoming gold medalist, and finished eighth out of nine competitors, failing reach the final.

The remaining Egyptians, all of whom qualified through the B standard, competed in field events. Omar Ahmed El Ghazaly, in the discus, was the most experienced of the quartet, with senior international medals going back to bronze at the 2002 African Championships in Athletics, in addition to past Olympic appearances in 2004 and 2008. In London he finished 26th among 41 participants with a best throw of 60.26 meters. Ihab Abdelrahman, in the javelin throw, had missed the 2008 Summer Olympics, despite having been a silver medalist at the 2007 Pan Arab Games, but had won the event at the 2010 African Championships and the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London he placed 28th out of 44 competitors with a best throw of 77.35 meters.

One Egyptian badminton player qualified for the Olympics, Hadia Hosny El Said. A veteran of the 2008 Summer Games, she trained for London at the University of Bath, where she was a graduate student in bioscience. Ranked 102nd in the world, she qualified by being the top player on the African continent. In the women's singles, she lost to Pi Hongyan of France and Chloe Magee of Ireland, finished in the bottom of her group, and was eliminated from the tournament.

Five Egyptian boxers qualified for the Olympics, all of whom were men and earned their spots at the 2012 African Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament. The only Egyptian to win a bout in London was Hesham Yehia, in the flyweight division, who defeated Benson Gicharu of Kenya before losing to Jasurbek Latipov of Uzbekistan in the round of 16. Yehia's most successful major international tournament had been the 2011 Pan Arab Games, where he had been the flyweight runner-up. The most experienced boxer was Mohamed Hikal, who had competed in the light-middleweight, welterweight, and middleweight categories of the 2000, 2004, and 2008 Summer Olympics respectively. Among his international boxing distinctions, he was 1999 and 2003 All-African champion, 2005 Mediterranean champion, 2007 and 2011 Pan Arab champion, and 2007 African champion, and won a bronze medal at the 2005 World Championships. In 2012 he was once again representing Egypt as a middleweight and lost his first bout to Soltan Migitinov of Azerbaijan. Ramy Helmy El-Awadi, a bronze medalist from the 2007 Pan Arab Games, received a bye in the opening round of the light flyweight class and was defeated by Ferhat Pehlivan of Turkey in the round of 16. Mohamed Ramadan and Eslam El-Gendy lost their first bouts to eventual silver medalist Han Soon-Chul of South Korea and Gyula Káté of Hungary in the lightweight and light welterweight events respectively.


Egypt's first ever Olympic competitor in canoe and kayak, Mostafa Mansour, qualified for the 2012 Games. Having taken up the sport in 2007, after abandoning his initial pursuit of rowing, Mansour qualified for the K-1 200 metres by coming in third in the event at the 2011 All-Africa Games. The Olympic spots were originally meant to go to the top two finishers, Greg Louw of South Africa and Mohamed Mrabet of Tunisia, but South Africa did not select Louw for the Games. Mansour's best time in the K-1 1000 metres earned him a spot in that event as a continental wildcard. He was eliminated in the opening round of both events in London, after finishing last in his heats.

One Egyptian equestrian qualified for show jumping for the Olympics. Karim El-Zoghby, a veteran of the 2008 Games, qualified with his horse Wervel Wind due to his ranking at the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games. In the months leading up to the Olympics, he trained full-time in the Netherlands and won a silver medal in the team jumping event at the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London, Zoghby survived the first qualifying course by finishing joint-53rd with five penalties, but was eliminated after placing 51st in round two with an additional five penalties.

Twelve Egyptian fencers, six men and six women, qualified for the Olympics. Both the men and women qualified their foil teams by being the top African nation in this category, while Ayman Mohamed Fayez and Salma Mahran were selected as the second highest-ranked Africans in the men's épée and the women's sabre respectively. The final competitors, Mona Hassanein in the women's épée and Mannad Zeid in the men's sabre, won an African qualifier to earn their spots.

One of his teammates, Tarek Ayad, who had also been part of the gold medal-winning foil team at the 2011 Pan Arab Games and had won bronze individually, defeated fellow Egyptian Anas Mostafa in the opening round, before losing to Aleksey Cheremisinov of Russia in the round of 32. Fayez, who won gold in the individual and team épée events at the 2011 Pan Arab Games, and Zeid were defeated in their opening rounds by eventual gold medalist Rubén Limardo of Venezuela and Malaysia's Yu Peng Kean respectively.
