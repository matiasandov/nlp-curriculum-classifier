Strike on Saint-Paul 

The Raid on Saint-Paul was a land and/or water capable task directed by a consolidated British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Marines drive against the invigorated French port of Saint Paul on ÄÂle Bonaparte (presently known as RÄÅ¡union) amid the Napoleonic Wars. The activity was propelled on 20ÃÂ September 1809 as both a forerunner to a future full-scale attack of ÄÂle Bonaparte and so as to catch the French frigate "Caroline" and the East Indiamen she had seized in the Action of 31 May 1809 which were protecting in the harbor. The task was a finished achievement, with British raging gatherings catching the batteries sitting above the port, which permitted a maritime squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley to enter the sound and catch the delivery in the harbor. 

The French safeguards of the town, in spite of at first opposing the assault, were unfit to avert the seizure of the port's cautious fortresses. The British power later pulled back under strain from the principle army of the island, consuming distribution centers containing over ÃÅ500,000 worth of silk caught from British shipper ships. At last the French were unfit to successfully restrict the attack, the island's senator General Des Bruslys withdrawing to Saint-Denis as opposed to draw in the British and later ending it all. The transportation of powers from the as of late caught island of Rodrigues, the co-appointment of land and maritime powers and the disappointment of the French protectors to co-ordinate a successful reaction were all highlights of the resulting attack and catch of ÄÂle Bonaparte in July 1810. 

The French Indian Ocean regions of ÄÂle de France and ÄÂle Bonaparte were intensely braced island bases from which French frigates had the capacity to dispatch assaults against British exchange courses over the Indian Ocean amid the Napoleonic Wars. In late 1808, a squadron of four frigates left France for the area under Commodore Jacques Hamelin with requests to go after the escorts of East Indiamen that normally crossed the Indian Ocean. Amid the pre-summer of 1809, these frigates scattered into the Bay of Bengal, assaulting British delivery and beach front harbors around the edge of the Eastern Indian Ocean. The Royal Navy was likewise setting up a task in the district, a stunned battle expected to barricade, disengage and in this way catch both ÄÂle deÃÂ France and ÄÂle Bonaparte, taking out the last French regions and bases east of Africa. 

To direct the British task, Admiral Albemarle Bertie at the Cape of Good Hope composed a squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley to bar the islands, catch any French transporting that introduced itself and start arrangements for the intrusions. Rowley was outfitted with the obsolete ship of the line and a little squadron of frigates and littler boats, later fortified with a power of warriors from Madras in British India, with which he caught the adjacent island of Rodriguez to use as an assaulting base. 

On 14 August, one of Rowley's boats, the 18-weapon sloop , assaulted a French brig at RiviÄÂ¨re Noire District on ÄÂle deÃÂ France. Despite the fact that the assault was eventually ineffective, "Otter"s chief Nesbit Willoughby and his arrival party had the capacity to break into and out of the harbor without serious challenges. This provoked Rowley to consider a bigger scale task against an all the more vigorously braced French position. Two months sooner, in the Action of 31 May 1809, the French frigate "Caroline" had caught two East Indiamen, "Streatham" and "Europe", in the Bay of Bengal. The French skipper, Jean-Baptiste-Henri Feretier, drove his prizes back to the French-held islands, touching base off ÄÂle de France on 22 July. Feretier was kept from endeavoring to achieve Port Louis by Rowley's barring squadron and rather put his boats into Saint-Paul on ÄÂle Bonaparte to dump his caught vessels and recharge his provisions. 

Rowley ended up mindful of Feretier's essence at Saint-Paul amid the next month and resolved to assault the port and recover the profitable ships in the harbor. The activity was likewise to be a prelude to a possible attack endeavor, giving the squadron experience of a land and/or water capable landing task. Consulting with Lieutenant Colonel Henry Keating on Rodriguez, Rowley discovered that Keating's men would arrive behind the firearm batteries that protected the town and tempest them. This would permit Rowley to bring his squadron straightforwardly into the harbor, catch the delivery tied down there and conceivably catch the town too. Rowley's arranging was legitimately influenced by a fizzled assault on Saint-Paul on 11 November 1806, when and had assaulted the harbor without infantry support. Their objective was the frigate "SÄÅ¡millante", yet neither one of the britishes transport had the capacity to pass the overwhelming batteries that ensured the port and they were compelled to pull back. 

On 16 September 1809, the troops were readied, and 368 British Army fighters were left on the British frigate HMS "Nereide" under Captain Robert Corbett, Willoughby's "Otter" and the Honorable East India Company clipper "Wasp". This troop escort was joined off Saint-Paul on 18ÃÂ September by the remainder of Rowley's squadron, the leader "Raisonnable" and the frigates under Captain Samuel Pym, and under Captain John Hatley. These boats marshaled an extra 236 sailor volunteers and Royal Marines who might join the attack. The whole attack drive was then set out on "Nereide", as Corbett had involvement with the ÄÂle Bonaparte coastline, with the ambush assigned for the early morning of 21 September. 

At 05:00 on 21 September 1809, "Nereide" entered the straight of Saint-Paul under the front of obscurity and effectively handled the British power, with no sign they had been located from the shore, at the Pointe des Galets. The Pointe des Galets was north of Saint-Paul, the separation permitting the power, partitioned into Keating's fighters from Rodriguez and the maritime power driven by Nesbit Willoughby, to approach the substantial weapon batteries that monitored the port imperceptibly. Raging the most grounded batteries, LambousiÄÂ¨re and la CentiÄÂ¨re, at 07:00, the British power shocked the armies, caught the strongholds and turned their gun onto the delivery secured in the harbor, discharging grape shot at the decks of the frigate "Caroline". 

A unit of the British arrival constrain then isolated from the fundamental body and caught a third battery named laÃÂ Neuf, directing a power of nearby local army that endeavored to hinder their development with cannons help from the British squadron in the narrows. The state army had descended from their battalions in the encompassing slopes and been joined by 110 French officers who had landed from "Caroline", however the little French power was effectively disregarded by the British arrival party. Keating and Willoughby then devastated the firearms in the initial two caught batteries and raged the staying two strongholds, indeed catching them and utilizing their very own gun to discharge on the transportation in the harbor. 

While the arrival drive drove off the safeguards and caught the fortresses, the maritime squadron entered the harbor and opened up a staggering flame on the dwarfed "Caroline". Shot was additionally discharged at the caught East Indiamen, different vessels in the harbor and any little batteries or shore positions that stayed in French hands. Feretier and the other French maritime officers, perceiving that their position was sad, cut the grapple links of their boats and enabled them to float shorewards, where they surrendered ship to escape catch. The British squadron at that point secured in the harbor as their teams begin refloating the grounded French ships on the shoreline. Notwithstanding "Caroline" and the East Indiamen and , Rowley's squadron caught a 14-weapon privateer brig named , which the French had caught in 1806 from the Bombay Marine, the East India Company's naval force, and five or six littler boats. With the harbor and strongholds in British hands, Keating and Willoughby entered the town of Saint-Paul moving along without any more battle. 

The evening of 21 September, the arrival party set out on the British ships in the inlet having wrecked the majority of the braced positions that encompassed the harbor. Amid 22ÃÂ September, French powers were seen assembling in the slopes around the town, conveyed from remote battalions to join the fundamental army from the capital Saint-Denis by the island's representative General Des Bruslys. Rowley and Keating foreseen that this power, which dwarfed their own, would recover the town on 23ÃÂ September and in like manner requested Willoughby to arrive with his marines and mariners to consume French government property along the waterfront. The most evident and noteworthy focus of Willoughby's power was a stockroom on the docks that was loaded with the caught silk from the East Indiamen caught via "Caroline". Willoughby requested this structure to be scorched, wrecking over ÃÅ500,000 worth of caught materials, (the likeness ÃÅ starting at 2019). Other adjacent distribution centers were not decimated as it was impractical to quickly decide their possession. In spite of the fact that the French power had achieved the edges of the town, Willoughby had the capacity to arrive and reembark his troops without a solitary shot being discharged. On 22ÃÂ September, Rowley got a request from a collection of slaves in the town who had circumvented amid the battling and requested arms with which to assault the French. They additionally offered to consume the town to the ground. Rowley, who looked to develop great relations with the incredible components of society with the end goal of catching the island sooner rather than later, denied their requests and had the slaves come back to their proprietors, where eight were executed for plotting defiance. There was anyway a prominent case of a slave showing devotion to his proprietor: The painter Jean-Joseph Patu de Rosemont had served in the local army powers with the columnist Nicole Robinet de La Serve and was caught when Keating's troops entered Saint-Paul. Taken on board the British squadron, Rosemont's child AmÄÅ¡dÄÅ¡e connected to trade himself for his dad as a detainee yet was cannot. In the blink of an eye before the squadron withdrew, Rosemont's own slave FÄÅ¡lix swam to the squadron to serve his proprietor in bondage. For his reliability, FÄÅ¡lix was manumitted when Rosemont was liberated in 1810. 

On 23 September, Rowley and Keating arranged another arrival under front of the weapons of the "Nereide" to drive off the French fortifications. On landing, in any case, it was found that the French power had vanished. Lacking help for a counterattack from the neighborhood landowners, who supported an arrival to the government, DesÃÂ Bruslys was reluctant to arrange a strike which he considered would have definitely prompted a superfluous bloodbath. Rather, he requested his powers to surrender Saint-Paul and resign to Saint-Denis amid the night. Without help from his boss, Captain St-Michel, commandant of Saint-Paul, consented to surrender the town totally, pulling back his residual powers under a banner of ceasefire. The concurred ceasefire kept going five days, amid which the British power stacked their boats with French government arrangements, gear, military and maritime stores and those cargoes from caught British ships that had not been singed by Willoughby. The French attempted to avoid this, DesÃÂ Bruslys having ended it all some prior days, torn between his refusal to surrender the island to the British and his hesitance to arrange a grisly fight for what he respected to be an "open island". 

Rowley additionally caught the East Indiamen "Streatham" and "Europe" and reestablished their past commanders and teams, who had been discharged as a component of the ceasefire. Various littler trader ships were caught and all were refitted for the adventure to Britain, to be convoyed there by the recently caught "Caroline". This 40-firearm frigate, just three years of age and extremely substantial and capably manufactured, was given to Corbett in acknowledgment of his administrations in the task and renamed HMS "Bourbonaise", mirroring the British name for ÄÂle Bonaparte, ÄÂle Bourbon. Willoughby was elevated to post skipper and quickly took direction of Corbett's previous ship "Nereide". Late on 28ÃÂ September, Rowley drove his power to ocean from Saint-Paul having consumed or caught all administration transportation, stores and structures in the town and encompassing territories. 

Losses of the activity were not high on either side. English misfortunes in the arrival party added up to 15 slaughtered and 58 injured, with an extra three missing. The maritime squadron endured no known losses in the commitment, essentially in light of the fact that they didn't go under overwhelming flame. French misfortunes have not been determined, yet separated from General DesÃÂ Bruslys were presumably a comparative figure to the British. Interestingly, the harm to the assurance of the French safeguards of ÄÂle Bonaparte was serious: the passing of DesÃÂ Bruslys and the inability to legitimately shield the town undermined their endeavors to such an extent, that the possible attack of the island in 1810 was done without huge battling or misfortune. This intrusion compel was comparable in size to the assaulting party and was indeed driven by Rowley and Keating. 

"Caroline" was a "fairly fine frigate" and her catch was a hit to the French squadron dependent on ÄÂle deÃÂ France under Hamelin. The recover of the East Indiamen was likewise a critical achievement, decreasing the effect of French activities in the district amid 1809. The attack additionally furnished the British powers with crucial involvement in directing land and/or water capable arrivals arranged from Rodriguez and gave a sign of the nature of French shore guards and protective developments all through the islands, which would importantly affect future tasks, particularly the Invasion of ÄÂle Bonaparte in 1810.
