Tropical storm Alice (December 1954) 

Sea tempest Alice is the main realized Atlantic sea tempest to traverse two timetable years and one of just two named Atlantic tropical twisters, alongside Tropical Storm Zeta of 2005, to do as such. The twelfth tropical tornado and the eighth storm of the 1954 Atlantic sea tempest season, Alice created on December 30, 1954 from a trough of low weight in the focal Atlantic Ocean in a region of uncommonly good conditions. The tempest moved southwestward and bit by bit fortified to achieve sea tempest status. Subsequent to going through the Leeward Islands on January 2, 1955, Alice achieved crest winds of 90Ã¢Â mph (150Ã¢Â km/h) before experiencing cold air and swinging toward the southeast. It disseminated on January 6 over the southeastern Caribbean Sea. 

Alice created substantial precipitation and tolerably solid breezes over a few islands along its way. Saba and Anguilla were influenced the most, with complete harm adding up to $623,500ÃÂ (1955ÃÂ USD). There was a before sea tempest named Alice in the season. Operationally, absence of authoritative information forestalled the U.S. Climate Bureau from pronouncing the framework a typhoon until January 2. It got the name "Alice" in mid 1955, however re-examination of the information upheld stretching out its track to the earlier year, bringing about two tropical twisters of a similar name in one season. 

A virus front moved southeastward from the East Coast of the United States on December 23, 1954, and ignored Bermuda two days after the fact. A solid anticyclone created behind the virus front, and on December 26 a trough expanded southward from the virus front. The anticyclone moved southeastward as the trough and cold front moved eastbound. The trough step by step decelerated as high weights modified the upper dimension stream to that of an easterly stream. Convection expanded over the trough as it moved over moderately warm waters, around 1 ÃÂ°C better than average, and started experiencing tropical cyclogenesis after a dissemination started to create along the northern bit of the trough. The framework kept on sorting out as it moved toward the west, and dependent on three ship reports affirming a shut course, it is assessed the framework formed into a tropical gloom on December 31 while found 770Ã¢Â miles (1245Ã¢Â km) east-upper east of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles. 

With a limited edge of high weight to its north, the wretchedness moved west-southwestward. Air conditions were surprisingly great for the time because of the edge of high weight keeping cold air from achieving the focal Atlantic Ocean. This enabled the wretchedness to strengthen into a hurricane later on December 30, in light of direct perceptions. There were not many direct perceptions for the next days, however it is evaluated the tempest heightened into a sea tempest on December 31 while situated about 475Ã¢Â miles (770Ã¢Â km) east-upper east of Barbuda. On January 1, 1955, a ship inside 10Ã¢Â miles (16Ã¢Â km) of the middle detailed sea tempest drive winds and a weight of 987Ã¢Â mbar. In light of this report and a few other ship reports, the framework was perceived as a tropical low by the San Juan Weather Bureau Office. The sea tempest proceeded toward the southwest, and entered the Caribbean Sea on January 2 in the wake of going between Saint Martin and Saint BarthÄÅ¡lemy. A segment of the eyewall moved over Saint Martin and Saba. In view of close sea tempest compel twists from the influenced islands, a data notice named the framework as Hurricane Alice while in the northeastern Caribbean Sea. All through its track, Alice was a little tropical violent wind with a distance across of just around 60Ã¢Â miles (95Ã¢Â km). 

Observation air ship flew into Hurricane Alice on January 3 and affirmed the presence of the tropical violent wind by detailing twists somewhere in the range of 60 and 65Ã¢Â mph (95 to 105Ã¢Â km/h) and a warm center focus. It is assessed Alice kept on heightening as it followed southwestward in the Caribbean Sea, and achieved crest winds of 80Ã¢Â mph (130Ã¢Â km/h) while situated about 95Ã¢Â miles (150Ã¢Â km) west-northwest of Montserrat. While close to its pinnacle the sea tempest built up a ring of convection around its eye, and Alice kept up pinnacle twists for about 24Ã¢Â hours until virus air from the north debilitated it. Extratropical cyclogenesis happened north of Bermuda on January 3, which debilitated the high weight framework toward the north of Alice and turned the stream in the Caribbean Sea to that of cold northwesterly breezes. Alice swung toward the southeast on January 4 and debilitated to a hurricane presently. Convection bit by bit ended up disrupted, and subsequent to debilitating to a tropical misery on January 5, Alice disseminated on January 6 while situated about 100Ã¢Â miles (160Ã¢Â km) west-northwest of Grenada. 

Consequent to the affirmation of the presence of Hurricane Alice, the U.S. Climate Bureau Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico cautioned the islands of the northern Lesser Antilles to plan for solid breezes and unpleasant oceans. Storm Alice delivered moderate to solid breezes over the islands, cresting at 81Ã¢Â mph (130Ã¢Â km/h) in Saint BarthÄÅ¡lemy and 75Ã¢Â mph (120Ã¢Â km/h) in Saba. The typhoon dropped moderate to overwhelming precipitation over a few islands, including a pinnacle of 11.27Ã¢Â inches (286Ã¢Â mm) in 48Ã¢Â hours recorded at Saba. Because of its little size, just a couple of islands got noteworthy impacts from the typhoon. Holy person BarthÄÅ¡lemy, Saba, Anguilla, Sint Eustatius, and Saint Kitts detailed harm from the sea tempest, totaling $623,500 (1955ÃÂ USD, $4.7Ã¢Â million 2006ÃÂ USD). Harm was heaviest on Saba and Anguilla, happening principally to transportation offices and yields. 626Ã¢Â houses were pulverized or seriously harmed on Anguilla, also. The harm was caused for the most part by overwhelming precipitation and harsh oceans, not the immediate activity of the breeze. The entry of Hurricane Alice significantly beset the economies of the little influenced islands. Also, the external rainbands of the tempest mitigated dry conditions on Puerto Rico which had endured since the past October. No passings were accounted for. 

This tempest framed on December 30; be that as it may, in the prior days satellites, meteorologists needed to depend on reports from boats and islands in the Atlantic to find and track storms. This data was regularly crude; two twisters, including a Category 2 typhoon, operationally went undetected in 1954. It was authoritatively perceived as a huge tropical violent wind on January 2, 1955. At the time, the National Weather Service utilized a similar naming rundown every year, so the name given to this tempest was "Alice" and it was assigned as a piece of the 1955 Atlantic typhoon season. Be that as it may, it was found amid post-storm examination that the tempest had really framed on December 30, and was rather a piece of the 1954 season. In this manner, the season had two tempests named "Alice" Ã¢ÂÂ the primary tempest of the period, and the last. Had Alice been found before the finish of the date-book year, it would have been named Irene, the following name on the 1954 rundown. A few reports named this tempest "Alice2" to maintain a strategic distance from disarray with the prior Alice from June 1954. 

Alice shaped later in the logbook year than any Atlantic tropical twister on record, framing six hours after the fact in the season than Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005. Alice was one of just eight Atlantic tropical violent winds to shape in the long stretch of December. Alice was the first of two Atlantic tropical violent winds to exist in two date-book years, the other being 2005's Zeta. The storm was likewise one of just six tropical or subtropical violent winds to exist in the long stretch of January and the most grounded to do as such.
