Gangut () was both the lead ship of the gunboats of the Imperial Russian Navy worked before World War I and the remainder of her class to be finished. She was named after the Russian triumph over the Swedish Navy in the Battle of Gangut in 1714. She was finished amid the winter of 1914Ã¢ÂÂ1915, yet was not prepared for battle until mid-1915. Her job was to safeguard the mouth of the Gulf of Finland against the Germans, who never endeavored to enter, so she invested her energy preparing and giving spread to minelaying activities. Her team joined the general revolt of the Baltic Fleet after the February Revolution and joined the Bolsheviks in 1918. She was laid up in 1918 for absence of labor and not recommissioned until 1925, by which time she had been renamed Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya (: "October Revolution"). 

She was remade somewhere in the range of 1931 and 1934 with new boilers, fire-control frameworks and extraordinarily extended superstructures. Amid the Winter War she barraged Finnish waterfront big guns positions once. Her enemy of air ship deadly implement was incredibly strengthened in mid 1941, just before Operation Barbarossa. She gave gunfire support against the Germans amid the Siege of Leningrad in spite of being shelled multiple times and under fix for a year. Held on dynamic obligation after the war she turned into a preparation send in 1954 preceding being struck off the Navy List in 1956 and gradually rejected. 

"Gangut" was long at the waterline and long by and large. She had a light emission a draft of , more than planned. Her uprooting was at burden, over more than her structured dislodging of . 

"Gangut"s hardware was worked by the Franco-Russian Works. Ten Parsons-type steam turbines drove the four propellers. The motor rooms were situated between turrets three and four out of three transverse compartments. The external compartments each had a high-weight ahead and turn around turbine for each wing propeller shaft. The focal motor room had two each low-weight ahead and toward the back turbines just as two cruising turbines driving the two focus shafts. The motors had an all out structured yield of , however they created amid her sister 's full-speed preliminaries on 21 November 1915 and gave a top speed of . Twenty-five Yarrow boilers gave steam to the motors at a structured working weight of . Every evaporator was fitted with Thornycroft oil sprayers for blended oil/coal copying. They were orchestrated in two gatherings. The forward gathering comprised of two engine compartments before the second turret, the principal of which had three boilers while the second one had six. The back gathering was between the second and third turrets and involved two compartments, each with eight boilers. At full burden she conveyed of coal and of fuel oil and that gave her a scope of at a speed of . 

The primary deadly implement of the "Gangut"s comprised of twelve 52-gauge Obukhovskii Pattern 1907 weapons mounted in four triple turrets appropriated the length of the ship. The Russians did not trust that superfiring turrets offered any preferred standpoint, limiting the estimation of pivotal flame and trusting that superfiring turrets couldn't fire while over the lower turret on account of gag impact issues. They likewise trusted that disseminating the turrets, and their related magazines, over the length of the ship improved the survivability of the ship. Sixteen 50-bore Pattern 1905 weapons were mounted in casemates as the optional battery expected to shield the ship against torpedo vessels. The boats were finished with just a solitary 30-bore "Loan specialist" against flying machine (AA) firearm mounted on the quarterdeck. Other AA weapons were most likely included over the span of World War I, yet subtleties are inadequate. Conway's says that four were added to the tops of the end turrets amid the war. Four submerged torpedo tubes were mounted with three torpedoes for each cylinder. 

"Gangut" was worked by the Admiralty Works in Saint Petersburg. Her bottom was set down on 16 June 1909 and she was propelled on 22 September 1911. Toward the finish of October 1914, she crashed into her sister "Poltava" which deferred her preliminaries, booked for 9 November 1914, to late December 1914. She entered administration on 11 January 1915 when she achieved Helsingfors and was doled out to the First Battleship Brigade of the Baltic Fleet. "Gangut" and her sister gave removed spread to minelaying activities south of LiepÃ¤Âja on 27 August, the farthest that any Russian gunboat wandered out of the Gulf of Finland amid World War I. She steered into the rocks on 10 September, however endured just minor harm. A minor insurrection broke out on 1 November when the official officer would not sustain the group the customary dinner of meat and macaroni in the wake of coaling. The arrival of the chief and the issue of a supper of tinned meat reestablished request on the ship. On 10Ã¢ÂÂ11 November and 6 December "Gangut" and her sister again given removed spread to minelaying activities. She saw no activity of any sort amid 1916. Her group joined the general revolt of the Baltic Fleet on 16 March 1917, after the inactive mariners got expression of the February Revolution in Saint Petersburg. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk required the Soviets to clear their base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have them interned by recently free Finland despite the fact that the Gulf of Finland was still solidified over. "Gangut" and her sisters drove the main gathering of boats on 12 March and came to Kronstadt five days after the fact in what ended up known as the 'Ice Voyage'. 

"Gangut" was laid up on 9 November 1918 for absence of labor and was renamed "Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya" on 27 June 1925 while she was being refitted. She was recommissioned on 23 March 1926 and started an incomplete recreation on 12 October 1931, joining the exercises from the prior modernizations of her sisters "Marat" and "Parizhskaya Kommuna". The cylindrical pinnacle pole of "Marat" was supplanted by a bigger and sturdier structure with a KDP-6 fire control executive, outfitted with two Zeiss rangefinders situated on top. The toward the back superstructure was extended and another structure was manufactured simply forward of it, with another KDP-6 executive surmounting it, which required the repositioning of the mainmast forward. This did not leave enough space for a derrick, as was utilized on "Marat", so two vast pontoon cranes were mounted on each side of the mainmast. Her pipe was bended to the back instead of calculated like "Marat". Every turret got Italian rangefinders and their rooftop protective layer was expanded to in thickness. Another forecastle, much like that of "Marat", was fitted to improve seakeeping. Six 34-K hostile to air ship (AA) firearms were included, three on the tops of the fore and rearward turrets. Every one of the twenty-five of her old boilers were supplanted by twelve oil-terminated boilers initially expected for the "Izmail". The space spared was utilized to include another inboard longitudinal watertight bulkhead that extraordinarily improved her submerged assurance. Her unique Pollen Argo Clock mechanical flame control PC was updated with a duplicate of a Vickers Ltd fire-control PC, assigned AKUR by the Soviets, just as a duplicate of a Sperry stable vertical gyrator. These progressions expanded her relocation to at full burden and her general length to . Her metacentric tallness diminished to from her structured because of her augmented superstructures. 

She completed her recreation on 4 August 1934. Her investment in the Winter War was constrained to a barrage of Finnish coast resistance firearms on 18 December 1939 at SaarenpÄÂ¤ÄÂ¤ in the Beryozovye Islands before the Gulf of Finland frosted over. She neglected to cause any changeless harm before she was driven off by close misses. "Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya" cruised to Tallinn not long after the Soviets involved Estonia, yet she was refitted in FebruaryÃ¢ÂÂMarch 1941 in Kronstadt and her enemy of air ship weapon was fortified. Two twin 76.2-mm 81-K mounts were mounted on her quarter deck. The magazines for these firearms were most likely arranged in the rearmost casemates on each bar, which lost their 120-mm weapons and twelve programmed "70-K" weapons were likewise included, three firearms each on the center turrets and the other six in the fore and toward the back superstructures. Four twin and four single DShK assault rifles and two AA executives were additionally fitted. The vast cranes were supplanted by littler ones taken from the ex-German overwhelming cruiser "Petropavlovsk" to prepare for the counter flying machine weapons. 

On 22 June 1941 "Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya" was in Tallinn when the Germans attacked the Soviet Union, however she was compelled to cruise for Kronstadt by the propelling Germans. She opened discharge on troop places of the German eighteenth Army on 8 September from the channel among Leningrad and Kronstadt, and most likely landed four firearms on the next day for use shorewards. She was gravely harmed on 21 September by three bomb hits on her bow that thumped out two turrets and she was sent to the Ordzhonikidze Yard on 23 October for fixes. The Soviets exploited this opportunity to include four more 37-mm 70-K AA weapons and another twin 76.2-mm K-81 firearm mount among February and April 1942. She was hit again by one overwhelming and three medium bombs dropped by Heinkel He 111s of KG 4 amid the evening of 4Ã¢ÂÂ5 April. also, again by three bombs on 24 April. Her fixes were finished in November 1942, in spite of the fact that a fourfold 37-mm 46-K weapon mount was included September. She bolstered Soviet powers amid the Siege of Leningrad, the LeningradÃ¢ÂÂNovgorod Offensive in January 1944 and the VyborgÃ¢ÂÂPetrozavodsk Offensive in June 1944. She got a Lend-Lease British Type 279 air-cautioning radar at some point amid 1944. On 22 July 1944 she was granted the Order of the Red Banner. 

She was renamed as a 'school war vessel' on 24 July 1954 and stricken on 17 February 1956. She was gradually rejected and her mass still made due in May 1958.
