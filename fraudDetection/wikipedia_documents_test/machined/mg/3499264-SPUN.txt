For a significant part of the twentieth century, it was a non-charge paying willful helped school, however following neighborhood gathering intends to evacuate this status and union the Grammar School with a close-by auxiliary present day school, the governors took the choice to turn out to be completely autonomous in 1983.

Previous students are known as "Old Grammarians", and the school has delivered various celebrated graduated class. 

Despite the fact that the school has moved area on a few events, every one of its previous structures is still in presence. The school was established by the Guild of the Holy Trinity in 1379 over the south patio of St Peter's Church. The Guild was an amazing power in the later Middle Ages. The chronicled name "Schola Sanctae Trinitatis De Wysbech" is as yet utilized on the school's peak, which is gotten from the seal of the Wisbech Corporation (itself dependent on the previous Guild seal) and highlights the situated figures of St Peter and St Paul. The main record of a schoolmaster dates from 1407 when one Maurice Plank was offered leave to learn at Cambridge University for two terms on the understanding that he would designate a usher to educate in his nonattendance. 

Not long after establishment, the school moved to the Guildhall in Hill Street. A record from 1446 subtleties how ace Jacob Creffen was allowed leave by the Bishop of Ely to gather a "satisfactory compensation" from every researcher as per the "laudable, old and endorsed custom". 

Following the English transformation, the Guild of the Holy Trinity was broken up and supplanted by the Wisbech Corporation. The school was renamed and restored by King Edward VI in 1549, who gave the school a contract "for the guidance of youth in syntactic learning and neighborly writing". The contract is still in presence, and is as of now held by the Wisbech Museum. That year, land was given for the development of a school building alongside the Guildhall building. After the Restoration of Charles II, the school's sanction was reestablished with the stipulation that the Capital Burgesses be given the decision of schoolmaster and that the Bishop of Ely "always will have the privilege of appearance, reconstruction, and amendment of the schoolmaster, as of the school previously mentioned". 

In 1638 a sponsor, William Holmes, offered ÃÅ400 to the burgesses of Wisbech to be put resources into land, and the rest connected for the support of two researchers at Magdalene College, Cambridge. In his will of 1656 Holmes coordinated that the entire yearly pay of his 46-section of land domain in Holbeach, Lincolnshire be paid yearly towards the support of the researchers and the enrichment of the school. Other land and property had been given to the school in the wills of Thomas Parkes in 1628 and John Crane in 1651. Crane's home included land in Fleet, Lincolnshire and a motel on Market Hill called the Black Bull. 

In 1792, neighborhood representative Joseph Medworth obtained the site of Wisbech Castle, including John Thurloe's 1660 chateau and the land encompassing it from the See of Ely, building the Georgian Crescent along the bailey dividers. As a feature of his plan, in 1811 he endeavored to induce the Corporation to buy the chateau and wreck the Old Grammar School working in Ship Street with the expectation of structure another road through to the commercial center. The Corporation cannot (it is typically expected that the burgesses proposed to buy the house for a similar reason after Medworth's demise at a discounted cost). Thus, in an "attack of provoke", Medworth devastated Thurloe's manor and raised the present Wisbech Castle working in 1816. 

A 1868 review by Henry Richmond of the Schools Inquiry Commission noticed that the school was in a poor condition of fix; the school once had numerous guests, yet this was never again conceivable on the grounds that the biggest quarters required broad fixes. Subsequently, participation had tumbled from 60 to 22 researchers. Richmond records that the upper young men were perusing Cicero, and their insight into Latin language was "attractive".

Now, the school moved to an eighteenth century house on South Brink. A raising money battle was propelled to pay for the house, however after deficient assets were given, the expense of procurement was met by Alexander, Baron Peckover. The house and its grounds was initially expected to be the superintendent's living arrangement and give lodgings to a couple of visitors, however before long extended to oblige the whole school with the development of study halls and a lobby. The focal square of the eighteenth century town house was utilized as a framed library.

In his 1939 history of the school, director H. Lawrence White opines that the buy of this eighteenth century house was a "grave error", as it might have been "always requiring fixes" and was "hard to warm".
