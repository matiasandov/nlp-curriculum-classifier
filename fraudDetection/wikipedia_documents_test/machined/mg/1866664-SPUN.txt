Afterward, Darling worked in a bank for a period and before his dad selected him chief of one of a wheat ranch. Taking a shot at the homestead added size and solidarity to an effectively stocky and athletic casing. He was chosen for the South Australian group at age 19, yet his dad would not permit him time off the homestead to play. 

Following two years in the shrub, Darling came back to Adelaide and cricket. He opened a games store on Rundle Street, Adelaide and was before long chosen to speak to South Australia in between provincial cricket. He made his top notch cricket debut against New South Wales at the Adelaide Oval; scoring 5 and 32 as South Australia won the match by 237Ã¢Â runs.

In an innings where Australia make 586Ã¢Â runs, including a very long time for George Giffen and Syd Gregory, Darling was expelled for a brilliant duck, bowled first ball by Tom Richardson.

Andrew Stoddart conveyed another group to Australia to challenge "The Ashes" in 1897Ã¢ÂÂ98. Australia won the arrangement serenely, four Tests to one. Dear began the season ineffectively, scoring a duck and one against the visitors for South Australia in a match in which partner Clem Hill scored a twofold century. Dear went on, be that as it may, to command the arrangement with the bat. His lady Test century, 101 in the First Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground after Australia was made to pursue on, was the primary made by a left-hander in Tests. It was insufficient to forestall England winning by nine wickets. 

In the Third Test in the place where he grew up of Adelaide, Darling scored 178Ã¢Â runs and Australia won the match by an innings and 13Ã¢Â runs. He achieved his century by hitting Johnny Briggs over the eastern entryway and into the adjacent park. This is the main time in Ashes Tests where a player has achieved 100 with a hit out of the ground. Amid this innings, he likewise turned into the primary player to hit a six of every a Test in Australia (preceding 1910, a six was granted just if the ball was hit out of the ground). He later additionally hit the initial six out of a Test in England. Coming back to Sydney for the Fifth and last Test, Darling scored 160Ã¢Â runs from 253 scored altogether. He batted for 165Ã¢Â minutes, hitting 30Ã¢Â boundaries as Australia effectively pursued 273 in the fourth innings. His initial 100 came in 91Ã¢Â minutes; at the time, the quickest Test century scored. Before the finish of the period, Darling turned into the principal player to score 500Ã¢Â runs in an arrangement and the main player to score three centuries in an arrangement. 

Dear was picked by his colleagues as commander for the 1899 Australian group visiting England. The group was one of the most grounded found in England to that time, with the cricket reference book "Wisden" expressing, "By basic assent the [1899 Australians] shaped the most grounded blend that had originated from the Colonies since the incredible side captained by Mr. W. L. Murdoch in 1882." and that "Dear substantiated himself one of the absolute best commanders that at any point brought a group into the field." The Australians lost just three of the 35Ã¢Â matches they played on the visit, winning 16 and another 16 completing in draws. The main Test to achieve a conclusive outcome was the Second Test at Lord's, the place Australia won by ten wickets due to a limited extent to hundreds of years by Hill and Victor Trumper and a ten wicket pull by quick bowler Ernie Jones. Beside Hill, Darling was seen by "Wisden" as the best batsman among the Australians. "Wisden" guaranteed, "Up to a specific point the duties of captaincy appeared to tell against Darling, yet amid the most recent long stretches of the visit he played sublime cricket." Over the visit, he scored 1941 keeps running at a normal of 41.29, topping both the midpoints and the total for his group, and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. 

Dear's deeds as a cricketer had accommodated his dad to his wearing undertakings, however not to his games store activity. In 1900, his dad bought "Stonehenge", a sheep station covering in focal Tasmania and requested Darling to run the property on agony of rejection from his will. Dear conformed to his dad's desires and moved his family to the remote station, along a soil track from the closest town, minor Oatlands. Dear emerged of top of the line cricket for almost two years. 

It was not until December 1901 that Darling was persuaded to return by the Melbourne Cricket Club to skipper the Australians against the visiting English for the initial three Tests as it were. The English, captained by Archie MacLaren, won the First Test in Sydney convincingly by an innings and 124 runs. The Second Test in Melbourne was played on a downpour influenced pitch. MacLaren won the hurl and sent Australia in to bat on the "sticky wicket". Inside three hours, the two groups had been expelled; Australia holding a lead on the main innings of 51Ã¢Â runs. Understanding the threat the pitch held to his driving batsmen, Darling re-requested the batting line-up and opened the batting himself close by Hugh Trumble. The pair held out the English for 90Ã¢Â minutes; Darling thought about his 32Ã¢Â runs a standout amongst his best innings. All things considered, Barnes figured out how to get five wickets in the last half-hour to leave the Australians 5/48 when stumps was called. Twenty five wickets fell in the day's play. Essentially, Australia had a 99-run lead and batsmen of the bore of Hill, Trumper, Reggie Duff and Warwick Armstrong still to bat. The following day, on an ideal pitch, the Australian batsmen built up a match-winning lead, in the end winning the Test by 229Ã¢Â runs. In the Third Test in Adelaide, Australia turned into the principal group to score over 300Ã¢Â runs to win the fourth innings of a Test coordinate. Sweetheart, alongside Hill and Trumble, drove the record making run pursue; Darling scored 62Ã¢Â runs. Hugh Trumble captained the last two Tests as Darling came back to his homestead. Australia won the two Tests and the arrangement to hold "The Ashes". 

Dear consented to by and by lead the Australian cricket group in England in 1902. In what was a cold and wet summer, the Australian group won a nearby battled arrangement against the solid English group two Tests to one. Given the quality of the restriction, this Australian group is frequently alluded to as a standout amongst the best Australian groups at any point collected. The group included players of the gauge of Trumper, Hill, Armstrong, Trumble and Monty Noble; every one of whom would be later incorporated into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. The group lost just two matches amid the visit, with "Wisden" saying, "No voyaging group at any point endeavored more earnestly for triumph or all the more totally subjected every single individual thought to the prime object of winning matches. They framed an amazing all-round mix". 

The First Test at Edgbaston completed in a draw. Downpour spared the Australians after they were expelled for just 36 in their first innings; Wilfred Rhodes took seven wickets for just 17Ã¢Â runs. Downpour again destroyed the Second Test at Lord's the point at which the last two days were washed out. The Third Test, the main Test coordinate played at Bramall Lane, saw Australia win by 143Ã¢Â runs due to some degree to a century by Hill and Noble taking 5/51. Dear was rejected twice by Barnes without scoring, the main Test skipper to make a "couple". Australia won the Fourth Test at Old Trafford by three runs; Trumble took ten wickets for the match. The last batsman, Fred Tate, came in with England requiring eight races to verify triumph. Dear acquired the field and Trumble anticipated Rhodes scoring from the last three chunks of his over. This left Tate to confront Jack Saunders, who rejected him with the fourth chunk of his over to win the counterpart for Australia. Britain won the Fifth and last Test at the Oval by one wicket. Pursuing 263, England were 5/48 when Gilbert Jessop scored a century in 75Ã¢Â minutes to push England to triumph. 

The star for the Australians was Trumper who scored 2,570Ã¢Â runs, effectively beating Darling's own record for a provincial batsman in an English season set in 1899. So critical was Trumper to the Australian group that Darling, who had recently watched that every one of the Australians were ready the carriage to the ground, was later basically to ask "Is Vic on board?" before giving the driver the approval. Sweetheart himself had a blended visit with the bat. 

On the arrival excursion to Australia, the visiting group ceased to play three Tests against South Africa, the first between the two countries. Australia won the arrangement two Tests to nil, however Darling's very own structure was poor. In progressive innings, Darling made 0, 14, 6, 4 and 1. After the visit, he came back to Stonehenge and took a two-year break from top notch cricket. In his nonappearance, Monty Noble captained the Australian group against the visiting English in 1903Ã¢ÂÂ04. 

Before the Australian group to visit England in 1905 was chosen, Darling came back to top of the line cricket for South Australia. He won choice in the visiting squad and was named as chief. A more fragile Australian bowling assault saw Darling retreat to guarded measures all through the visit. These measures included guiding Armstrong to bowl his leg separates the leg side, where Darling had set up to seven defenders. These measures, disliked with the English open, saw 19Ã¢Â matches on the visit complete in draws, three more than the 16Ã¢Â matches won by Australia. "Wisden" stated, "Leaving aside Duff's long score at the Oval, Darling was the best batsman as an afterthought in the Test diversions, playing radiant cricket under attempting conditions." At Old Trafford in the Fourth Test, he made 73 out of 105 in under an hour and a half. His innings included thirteen limits, everything except one of them being drives. In spite of his endeavors, England still won the Test by an innings and 80Ã¢Â runs. 

In the wake of losing six hurls against his English inverse number Stanley Jackson amid the mid year, Darling settled on an alternate methodology before the Scarborough Festival coordinate late in the visit. At the hurl, he moved toward Jackson stripped to the abdomen and proposed, for the sake of entertainment, a wrestle for selection of innings. 

The 1905 visit was Darling's last Test cricket raid, as he asserted that proceeding to visit was unreasonable to his better half. He resigned from top notch cricket amid the 1907Ã¢ÂÂ08 season. In his top of the line vocation, Darling made 10635Ã¢Â runs, including 19Ã¢Â centuries at a normal of 34.52. In club cricket in Adelaide, Joe scored vigorously. He arrived at the midpoint of 144 for East Torrens Cricket Club in 1899Ã¢ÂÂ1900, 98.66 for Adelaide Cricket Club in 1896Ã¢ÂÂ97 and 86.20 for Sturt Cricket Club in 1904Ã¢ÂÂ05. He kept on making keeps running in Tasmanian club cricket directly through middle age. In 1921, he made 100Ã¢Â runs in 60 minutes, incorporating 29 of every one eight-ball exaggerating for Claremont Cricket Club. At age 52, he made 133Ã¢Â not out amid a fruitful run pursue where his group, Break-o'- Day, made 6/219 of every hour and a half. 

He was scornful of the recently shaped Australian Board of Control for International Cricket Matches (presently known as Cricket Australia), who he saw as endeavoring to evacuate control of universal cricket visits from the players. He would frequently allude to cricket directors as "Dead Heads". He later spoke to the Tasmanian Cricket Association as an agent to the Board of Control. 

Following his retirement from huge cricket, Darling came back to his Tasmanian sheep station, where he was associated with a scope of rural exercises. He spearheaded measures to destroy rabbits, a presented irritation at that point in plague extents all through Australia. He was a functioning individual from associations, for example, the Tasmanian Stock Holders and Orchardists' Association and the Royal Agricultural Society of Tasmania, the sorting out body of the Royal Hobart Show. Dear imported South Australian merino rams to improve his run, and his fleece beat the Hobart deals on a few events. He likewise acquainted underground clover with Tasmania. 

In 1919, Darling moved from Stonehenge to Claremont House, around which the Hobart suburb of Claremont later framed. He was chosen to the Cambridge electorate in the Tasmanian Legislative Council in 1921 as a free. He held his situation in the Parliament until his passing in 1946. In Parliament, one of his associates was Charles Eady, his colleague from the 1896 voyage through England. Sweetheart was perceived by his partners as a powerful, simple speaker. During the 1930s, he won an exclusion from land charge for little ranchers, and close to the finish of his parliamentary vocation, a Royal Commission was selected to examine charges Darling had made with respect to maladministration. The discoveries of the commission, discharged after his demise, saw an administration Minister and two others discovered liable of taking kickbacks. Dear was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1938 New Year Honors in acknowledgment of his work as an individual from the Legislative Assembly. 

Dear hitched Alice Minna Blanche Francis, a wheat rancher's little girl from Mundoora, South Australia in 1893. Together they brought up 15Ã¢Â children: ten children and five little girls. After medical procedure for a burst nerve bladder, Darling kicked the bucket in Hobart on 2 January 1946. He was covered at Cornelian Bay burial ground after a Congregationalist function and was made due by his significant other and twelve of his kids. 

Dear had a stocky, reduced form, standing and gauging . His partners thought his dull hair, blue eyes and mustache were like the fighter, Frank "Paddy" Slavin, and he offered an explanation to the epithet "Paddy" amid his time in cricket. His time dealing with his dad's ranch had built up his quality. Amid his first amusement for South Australia, he was tested to a bare wrestle by the quick bowler and ex-digger Ernie Jones, a casual commencement into the group. To his partners' astonishment, Darling figured out how to vanquish the a lot bigger Jones. 

The left-gave Darling was a solid driver of the ball who demonstrated the batsman the full substance of the bat. Whenever fundamental, he was a grim safeguard of his wicket. His kindred players believed that was at times superfluously cautious in his way to deal with batting and that he was taking care of business when driving hard. His South Australian and Australian partner George Giffen imagined that no Australian's cut shots voyaged quicker past point. 

Sweetheart holds the record for the most innings in a total Test Match profession (60), without being expelled lbw. 

Sweetheart had a solid identity and a free standpoint. The individuals who realized him all around thought him bound to be a pioneer in whatever he attempted. He disregarded solid beverage and tobacco and thought that it was hard to endure overindulgence in liquor. Regularly calm, he showed disappointment at the pestering from the group at Lord's at his unshakable cautious exertion even with an Australian batting breakdown. He was a stickler for reasonable play, however his activities against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be viewed as gamesmanship. Amid the bowler's methodology and after the bowler had taken a gander at the field, the Australian defenders moved despite Ranjitsinhji's good faith. This stressed the Indian sovereign when playing his leg look and in the long run observed him let alone for the English group. 

The writer Ray Robinson composed that "of every single Australian chief he came nearest to being a drill sergeant". In any case, his partners kept on choosing him as commander, confiding in his insight and comprehension of the amusement. On a wet day amid the 1899 visit, a postponement in play saw a portion of the Australians acknowledge a solicitation to the Player's tobacco manufacturing plant in Nottingham. While away, the climate cleared and play started with Darling driving a group of five Australians and five substitutes onto the field. Sweetheart later assembled a group conference that saw the guilty parties fined Ã¢ÂÂ¤5 for rupturing group rules. His way to deal with the hard-drinking Ernie Jones was likewise intense. To guarantee that the quick bowler would not toast abundance, he chose Jones as twelfth man in a match against an English district group. At the point when Jones would not play, a group meeting saw him confronting removal from the group. Dear addressed him secretly and clarified that without a statement of regret to his partners and a guarantee to control his drinking, he would be on the following vessel destined for Australia. The firm and brief activity lastingly affected group discipline amid his time as Australian commander. "Wisden" noticed that "as a commander he roused his men to uncover their best structure." As a chief he was a reformer, recommending decide changes that included making six runs the reward for clearing the limit as opposed to the whole ground, and utilizing of sawdust to fill gaps in bowler's run-ups.
