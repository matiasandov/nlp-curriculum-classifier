Cubzac-les-Ponts 

Cubzac-les-Ponts, likewise alluded to as Cubzac, is a collective of the Gironde office in Nouvelle-Aquitaine, an area in southwestern France. Found 20Ã¢Â km southwest of Bordeaux, it is an intersection purpose of the stream Dordogne. Cubzac has three scaffolds, one structured by Gustave Eiffel. 

Amid the Middle Ages, Cubzac filled in as a watchtower through the Four Sons of Amon manor. Diverse methods for intersection the stream in Cubzac have verifiably been utilized, from boat extensions and pony controlled ships to steel and solid scaffolds. Some portion of a lively wine district, Cubzac has a few wine mansions, including the Terrefort chÃ¢teau. It has built up its own shimmering wine, in what is presently called the CafÄÅ¡ de Paris. The limestone quarries of Cubzac provided for the average white developments found in Bordeaux and its locale. Cubzac has two Monuments Historiques; the first is a work of art in a congregation, the other is the remnants of the Four Sons of Amon palace. 

Cubzac is situated about 20Ã¢Â km upper east of Bordeaux, on the north riverbank of the Dordogne. A few transport systems combine in Cubzac to cross the stream. These incorporate the A10 motorway, the N10 trunk street and the Bordeaux-Nantes railroad. The LGV Sud-Ouest, a fast railroad line running among Tours and Bordeaux, is being assembled. Cubzac has a height going from 1Ã¢Â m to 42Ã¢Â m, the most noteworthy focuses being limestone bluffs dating from the Oligocene age, some of which have been utilized as wellspring of stone. In oenological terms, Cubzac is close to the monikers d'origine contrÄ'lÄÅ¡e (AOC) cÄ'tes de Bourg and Fronsac, with its very own wine manors. 

Cubzac's atmosphere is maritime, some portion of the Dfb bunch in the KÄÅppen atmosphere order. Intermittently, the stream Dordogne causes flooding. These days Cubzac is ensured by a dam, however is as yet helpless against flooding amid elevated tides and solid breezes. Flooding happened toward the end in the 1999 Martin and 2010 Xynthia storms. The 1999 tempest devastated numerous trees from the Terrefort mansion park. In 1708, a temperature extremum of - 15ÃÂ ÃÂ°C made the stream and vineyards solidify. 

Authoritatively, Cubzac-les-Ponts is a cooperative piece of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine district, the Gironde dÄÅ¡partement, the arrondissement of Blaye and the Saint-AndrÄÅ¡-de-Cubzac canton. The present city hall leader of Cubzac is Alain Tabone. Starting at 2010, he has six partners and thirteen consultants. 

In 2007, 890 occupants were expertly dynamic, the joblessness rate for the populace somewhere in the range of 15 and 64 was 6,7% for men and 10,0% for ladies, and the normal net assessable salary was Ã¢ÂÅº21 593. Of the 310 employments accessible in Cubzac, just 34,9% were given to its occupants. On January 1, 2010 there were no inns and no campgrounds in Cubzac. Horticulture in Cubzac is for the most part devoted to vine, corn and roughage. In 2000, 244Ã¢Â ha of Cubzac's property was farmland, speaking to 25% of the complete 987Ã¢Â ha. 

The primary hints of settlements in Cubzac go back to the Magdalenian age. Those were found in the late nineteenth and mid twentieth hundreds of years, with scrubbers, etches, cores, and spears found. Cut and cleaned tomahawks, sharpened stones, scrubbers, bits and rock strikers, and a couple of parts of ceramics from the Neolithic age are copious in Cubzac, particularly on the hill of the "Four Sons of Amon". An expansive bronze store for making weapons was found from the season of the Bronze and Iron Ages. The town was referenced in the Roman age as a reconnaissance post. As of now, crossing the waterway Dordogne was done at Cubzac. The town has been reconverted as the centuries progressed. The region was involved from the sixth century BC by a Bituriges Vivisques clan. The town was involved in 1250 by Simon de Montfort, sixth Earl of Leicester. The focal point of Cubzac is based on a little slope that overwhelms the Dordogne valley. 

The town has created from the space of Cupitius, a rich landowner of the Gallo-Roman period, from which the name Cubzac determines. 

The primary ships crossing the Dordogne were level bottomed vessels driven by paddles or keelboats driven by a sail. The section was dangerous and mishaps happened, particularly amid high tides and tempests. From 1754, a link ship crossed the 550Ã¢Â m wide waterway. The link lay over the waters and extended diagonally to the ebb and flow. In 1821, the link ship was supplanted by a two-section ship controlled by a merry go round of twelve steeds. The steeds get under way outfits which thus controlled a huge oar wheel. In great climate, the intersection time was improved to 30Ã¢ÂÂ45Ã¢Â minutes, yet in terrible climate the trek stayed unsure. 

The choice to build up an extension in Cubzac is taken by Napoleon Bonaparte on 30 January 1812 and February 3, 1813. The scaffold was initially to be finished in 1820. In any case, Cubzac's first scaffold was a suspension connect for which development works began in 1834, under Louis-Philippe I. Works endured four years, and open initiation happened on August 17, 1839 by the Duc and Duchesse of Orleans. The scaffold had cost an expected 3 million gold francs, was 545Ã¢Â m long and had 5 sounds. Not long after its development, the columns sank around one meter. Amid its 30 years of presence, it withstood storms in spite of the expansive adequacy motions caused. Be that as it may, on March 2, 1869 a huge tempest, causing motions of multiple meters, mostly decimated the extension and rendered it futile. Old techniques to cross the Dordogne where reestablished. At first, freight boats and steamboats were utilized. At that point, beginning from October 1870, an extensive steam tub was utilized, estimating 21Ã¢Â m by 13Ã¢Â m. To take care of the costly development costs, a toll was required for the initial 27 years. 

At the point when the suspension connect fell in 1869, the possibility of another scaffold was talked about finally. The underlying undertaking dates from 1875, which recommended that the new extension had going with rail tracks, and that it be based on the rest of the establishments of the suspension connect, utilizing framework. All things considered, given the tallness of the extension and the stream's profundity and current, platform is in fact difficult to actualize. In the last task from 1878, a flying option was offered, in spite of not many organizations acing the system at the time. The issue of fitting rail tracks, which was later surrendered, postponed the task. 

In 1873, brick work works had begun the correct bank. In 1879, Gustave Eiffel, who had hung tight over ten years for a positive reaction to his task, took close by the huge endeavor in Cubzac, which completed in 1883. The Cubzac connect is the most essential roadwork by the Eiffel organization. It required 3284 tons of metal, measures 552Ã¢Â m, and is partitioned in eight bayous. The parapet comprises of iron supports as opposed to strong dividers, mitigating the structure. The organization fabricating the iron pieces later gave those used to the Eiffel Tower. 

As the Allies arrived in Normandy, the German troupes, in their departure, somewhat decimated the Eiffel connect utilizing explosives. Beginning from August 21, 1944, all traffic on the extension was confined for the retirement of the German troupes. On 28 August 1944, as the last warriors passed, German specialists touched base in bikes and fitted explosives which exploded at 9:20pm. Three of the eight inlets had fallen in the waters and the North projection was genuinely harmed. The fragile fix works where worked by the organization Anciens Ets Eiffel with the assistance of the Entreprise GÄÅ¡nÄÅ¡rale Industrielle du Sud-Ouest, which unintentionally was coordinated by Jacques Eiffel, the amazing child of Gustave Eiffel. Thus, the scaffold is some of the time called "the twice Eiffel connect". 

The scaffold is presently part of the Route nationale 10 which keeps running among Hendaye and Paris. The two viaducts to the extension date from 1839 and every measure roughly 250Ã¢Â m. After some time, substantial settlements happened, causing genuine unsettling influences in the stone work and requiring the substitution of numerous vaults in 1880, 1903 and 1934. 

The rail connect was developed by Lebrun, Dayde and Pile by the compagnie Deyle et Pillet. Its style looks like that of the adjoining Eiffel connect. It was charged by the Chemins de Fer de l'ÄÂtat for the Chartres-Bordeaux line, and the development kept going from 1884 to 1885. Introduced in 1886, it is 561,60Ã¢Â m long over the Dordogne are isolated in eight straights. The rails are 21.80Ã¢Â m over the most noteworthy waters. The extension is made of iron columns fitted in supports. Regardless of being more youthful than the Eiffel connect, the development required more assets and exertion. The developments covered up submerged and earth make up the greater part of the esteem and volume of materials utilized. Establishments just aggregate to 57,800Ã¢Â cubic meters. Despite the fact that less harmed than the Eiffel connect, it additionally supported harm from German bombarding around the same time. The remaking works finished June 15, 1946, taking under two years to finish. 

In 1957 it was chosen to ponder the execution of a scaffold to diminish the old Eiffel connect which permitted just a single path for every bearing, and reduction on roads turned parking lots. From 1957 to 1963 different arrangements where contemplates. In 1971 the development works were offered and given to the organization Campenon-Bernard-Europe. The works ought to have kept going just two years yet where finished in 1974. The new motorway connect made of strengthened cement, having calmed the roads turned parking lots, was commended on radio, and by the tune "Ne partez pas en vacances, ne partez pas!" (Do not, don't go on vacation!) by Pierre Perret. In 2000, the extension was multiplied to 2x3 paths. 

The Saint-Julien church is named after Julian the Hospitaller, benefactor of Cubzac. Julian is an unbelievable holy person bound to slaughter his folks, and educated about his predetermination by a stag. He fled to get away from his destiny, yet the prediction acknowledged regardless, and he turned into a recluse, helping individuals cross a stream. At some point, the Christ touched base to report his acquittal. From the Middle Ages to the French Revolution, the town would have been called Saint-Julien-de-Cubzac. The congregation is made of limestone and experienced essential alterations in the nineteenth century, when specifically the steeple was revamped. The faÄÂ§ade, in any case, still contains Roman remains. The congregation holds an eighteenth century painting of the Baptism of Christ, grouped Monument historique in 1913. The congregation is encompassed by a graveyard which was unearthed in August 1978 by archeologists under the course of Richard Boudet. Coins dating from the season of Francis I, Henry III, Henry IV, Louis XIII, Napoleon III and Victor Emmanuel were revealed. A gold Merovingian seal ring bearing the Christian image Ichthys was additionally found under numerous potsherds. 

At Cubzac, on the high rough shoreline ignoring the Dordogne, and in the town focus, are the remains of the manor "des Quatre fils Aymon" inside conventional houses. The passage of the post is flanked by the remaining parts of two towers. These few stones are anyway remarkably wealthy in history and legend. For one thing, the stronghold did not have a place with the four children of Aymon who lived, maybe, the season of Charlemagne. It was fabricated and revamped in the twelfth and thirteenth hundreds of years. It was the seat of the lordship of Cubzaguais. In 1206, John Lackland, the lord of England and most youthful child of Eleanor of Aquitaine, delivered retribution of the ruler of France Philippe Auguste, who blamed him for conspiracy and denied him of his fiefs, by taking part in various maltreatment. He raged the chÃ¢teau of Cubzac, and crushed it. It is a short English triumph. The lordship comes back to the French, and is ascribed to Simon de Montfort, sixth Earl of Leicester, child of the awful and bleeding champ of the Albigensian Crusade. He fabricated another manor considered secure, for the benefit of the King of England, with twofold dividers, but then it is the one for which ruins remain. He was sacked by the Gascon noblemen rebelled against Simon de Montfort. Half sacked, it filled in as a stately home, until moving to the lordship Bouih. The armies days that the two medieval strongholds have raised on the site of a structure dating from the Carolingian time frame, which everything is gone. The Four Sons of Amon manor was enrolled as a notable landmark in 1938. 

Situated on a slope commanding Cubzac-les-Ponts and Saint-AndrÄÅ¡-de-Cubzac, the Terrefort-Quancard mansion is a wine property and family house. The fundamental structure is a limestone rectangular assortment of living zone, secured with slate for the rooftop. The encompassing grape wines, the greater part of which are Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, length around 70Ã¢Â hectares of land. Different remnants remain, including a wash for cloth and ponies, and a breeze will for flour. 

Amid its history crossing seven centuries, the mansion was claimed by a progression of seven families. One of the proprietors, the tally Lafaurie of Monbadon, friend of France, was an impetus to the development of the Eiffel connect. In March 1891, the Quancard siblings Jean and EugÄÂ¨ne purchased the property for 110 000 francs, and the Quancard family remains the last proprietors. The buy came after an extreme phylloxera flare-up, causing the passing of over portion of French vineyards, depreciated the property. The land territory was secured for the most part with shake until the Quancard siblings utilized explosives to expel it, and a lot of dirt limestone soil, known to be helpful for the wine produce, was brought to supplant it. 

The Quancard family has assumed a job in the life and history of Cubzac-les-Ponts. Initially, Jean Quancard was chosen by supreme dominant part as city hall leader of Cubzac on May 15, 1892 and stayed in office for a long time. Additionally, a reasonable, composed every year from 1936 to 1939 for its prosperity, upheld rebuilding work for the Saint-Julien steeple and gave money related help to the minister. At long last, the proprietors occasionally have occasions, including articles, family weddings and family gatherings. The last family gathering, from May 2006, saw around 200 individuals from the Quancard family. 

Amid the eighteenth and nineteenth hundreds of years, the hill of Cubzac was cut all around to give stone to Bordeaux's development and the weight of some stream banks, making profound unearthings in the limestone. In 1898, AndrÄÅ¡ Cousteau, uncle of the analyst and biologist Jacques Cousteau, began utilizing the caverns to make a shimmering wine dependent on conventional Champagne-production strategies. The wine, treated in a shut tank, packaged, and held neck down numerous months at consistent temperature, turned out to be bubbly and had its polluting influences collect close to the top. When this store was evacuated, the containers were resealed by power, and the stops gagged. In 1920, the Cousteau property was sold to the SociÄÅ¡tÄÅ¡ Anonyme Gay-Mousse. In 1966, the caverns where depended to Monsieur Lateyron who, after one year, made the CafÄÅ¡ de Paris.
