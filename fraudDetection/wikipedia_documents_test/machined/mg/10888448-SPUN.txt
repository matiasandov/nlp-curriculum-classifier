Charles Ollivierre 

Charles Augustus Ollivierre (20 July 1876 Ã¢ÂÂ 25 March 1949) was a Vincentian cricketer who spoken to the West Indies in matches before they achieved Test coordinate status. Conceived in St Vincent, Ollivierre at first played top of the line cricket for Trinidad; he was chosen to visit England with the West Indies group in 1900. He later fit the bill to play top of the line cricket for Derbyshire somewhere in the range of 1901 and 1907, turning into the main dark West Indian to play for an English province. Ollivierre was sensibly fruitful in district cricket and had a notoriety for being a smart batsman. Be that as it may, he dropped out of top of the line cricket after 1907 attributable to eye inconvenience. 

Ollivierre was conceived in St Vincent on 20 July 1876. His family were energetic cricketers, in spite of the fact that the locale included little history inside the game, and his two more youthful siblings Richard and Helon proceeded to speak to the West Indies in top of the line cricket. 

At first, Ollivierre played for Trinidad; he made his top notch debut against an English visiting group in March 1895 at 18 years old. He took two wickets, scored 7 keeps running in his first innings and 12 keeps running in the second. In non-top notch cricket, he kept on speaking to St Vincent, and inspired pundits when Barbados played the island in 1897. In 1899, he played two top notch matches for a group chosen by A. B. St Hill against a group speaking to Trinidad. In the principal diversion, he took 11 wickets and scored 67 in the second innings; in the second amusement, he took a further five wickets in Trinidad's first innings. 

Amid the 1900 English cricket season, Ollivierre headed out to England with a West Indian group. Welcome to visit England by Lord Hawke following the achievement of English visits to the Caribbean, the group was the first from the West Indies to visit England, and matches were not top of the line. The group improved consistently all through, and before the finish of the visit were made a decision to play well. Albeit overwhelmingly made up from white players, the group contained a few dark cricketers; at the time, the predominant groups in the West Indies were solely white. Ollivierre was the most reliable and effective batsman in the group, scoring 883 keeps running at a batting normal of 32. His most astounding score, and just century, came against Leicestershire, when he scored 159 runs and imparted an opening association of 238 to Pelham Warner. He likewise imparted an opening organization of 208 to Percy Cox against Surrey. He bowled infrequently in the early piece of the visit, despite the fact that with little achievement, yet did not bowl at all in his last eight amusements. 

As per the audit of the visit in "Wisden Cricketers' Almanac", Ollivierre was the group's best batsman, and his innings against Leicestershire was a standout amongst the best of the period. The article watched: "He has strokes all round the wicket, and somehow or another helps one to remember Ranji". Amid the visit, Ollivierre consented to play for Derbyshire and stayed in England to start the two-year procedure of capability for the County Championship. It is impossible that Ollivierre at any point came back toward the West Indies. 

All through his vocation in England, Ollivierre played as a beginner cricketer. He was utilized by Samuel Hill-Wood, a representative and legislator from Derbyshire, to work in his office in Glossop, where Ollivierre lived. Amid the 1901 season, he played three top of the line diversions for Derbyshire in non-Championship recreations: twice against London County Cricket Club and once against the visiting South African cricket group, hitting two half-hundreds of years during the time spent scoring 247 keeps running at a normal of 41.16. After further appearances in 1902, while hanging tight to qualify, against London County and the Australian visiting group, he wound up qualified for province coordinates in July and made his Championship debut against Essex. Later in 1902, he scored 167 against Warwickshire, his lady top of the line century. In all top of the line coordinates in the season, Ollivierre scored 524 keeps running at 34.93. The accompanying season, Ollivierre played in 19 diversions and scored 721 runs, yet his normal tumbled to 20.60. 

Ollivierre's best season was 1904, when he scored 1,268 keeps running at a normal of 34.27. Against Essex, he made the most elevated score of his vocation, when, as indicated by his tribute in "Wisden", "he was the commanding figure in a striking match". Essex scored 597 keeps running in their first innings; Derbyshire answered with 548, of which Ollivierre made 229. After Essex were bowled out for 97, Derbyshire hit off the expected rushes to win by nine wickets. Ollivierre was forgotten on 92 not, and had scored 321 keeps running in the match. The match report in the 1905 version of "Wisden" noted: "In overcoming Essex, Derbyshire achieved the most extraordinary execution at any point recorded in top of the line cricketÃ¢Â ... [Their] accomplishment has no parallel ever of amusement." Over the accompanying seasons, Ollivierre's structure blurred. In 1905, he scored 759 keeps running at a normal of 18.07. He improved his normal with 752 keeps running at 25.06 in 1906, including his last top of the line century. Amid that season, he played against a visiting West Indian group which incorporated his sibling RichardÃ¢ÂÂ Ollivierre scored 0 and 64 not out. In 1907, he oversaw only 417 keeps running at 12.26. In these later seasons, he started to have issues with his vision, and was compelled to resign from top of the line cricket after 1907. Altogether, he played 114 top of the line recreations, scored 4,830 keeps running at 23.56 and hit three centuries. Be that as it may, he kept on playing club cricket in Yorkshire and, every year somewhere in the range of 1924 and 1939, invested energy in the Netherlands training in schools. Ollivierre kicked the bucket at Pontefract in Yorkshire on 25 March 1949. 

As indicated by "Wisden" in 1901, as a batsman Ollivierre "was especially solid in slicing and playing to leg". J. N. Pentelow, a cricket essayist, recommended in 1928 that "there was something about Ollivierre that helped one to remember the incomparable Ranji. He was a more vigorously fabricated man than the thin Ranji of the days when we were youthful; however his strokes and his developments had genuine effortlessness." A journalist in "the Observer" in 1931 recollected Ollivierre as an "incredible batsman", while Neville Cardus, writing in 1920, named Ollivierre among a rundown of top-quality batsmen who did not do themselves equity at the largest amount: "Virtuosos who have quite recently lost their wayÃ¢Â ...every one of them possessing a sufficiently amazing record in province cricket, yet all of them truly expected ordinarily to wear the most valuable trees the best of recreations brings to the table". 

Ollivierre was the main dark West Indian cricketer to play region cricket, and the primary West Indian cricketer to set up a cricketing notoriety outside of that area. Other West Indians hoped to pursue his model, and a few were drawn closer by English regions with the end goal of qualifying. No less than one of Ollivierre's Derbyshire partners was troubled playing nearby a dark cricketer; Bill Storer, as indicated by the cricket author E. H. D. Sewell, put stock in "Britain for the English" and explicitly protested nearness of dark individuals. In any case, there is no proof that Ollivierre encountered any troubles from onlookers, and the student of history Jack Williams recommends that in spite of bigotry natural in English cricket at the time, Ollivierre's quality may have "made generosity towards non-whites among [Derbyshire's] white supporters".
