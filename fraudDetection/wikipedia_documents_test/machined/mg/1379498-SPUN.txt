While identified with "VII" and the "Accumulation" because of its tendency, the designers affirmed that it was not identified with nor influenced the "Arrangement" itself. Because of challenges conveying consistent agreeable administration, "G-Bike" was closed down in 2015 without seeing a Western discharge. 

The setting of "Definite Fantasy VII" is a world that has been portrayed as a mechanical or post-modern sci-fi "milieu". It is alluded to as "the Planet" by the arrangement characters, and was retroactively named "Gaia" in some Square Enix limited time material and by amusement staff. The planet's lifeforce is known as the Lifestream, a progression of otherworldly vitality that offers life to everything on the Planet. Its handled structure is known as "Mako". Amid "VII" and its prequels, the Lifestream is being utilized by the megacorporation Shinra as a vitality source. This is thusly making the Planet perilously debilitate, undermining the presence of everything and everybody on the planet. The primary story of "VII" centers around an eco-fear based oppressor bunch known as AVALANCHE, chronicling their contention with Shinra president Rufus Shinra and his subordinates, including the undercover Turks, and SOLDIER, a world class battling power made by giving people crude Mako. In the end, all gone under risk from Sephiroth, an individual from SOLDIER made through Shinra experimentation and made distraught when he learns reality about his beginnings, and Jenova, an outsider lifeform which looks to devastate all life on the Planet. Among the primary characters are Cloud Strife, a hired fighter and self-announced ex-SOLDIER, Aerith Gainsborough, a bloom vender and last individual from an old clan known as the Cetra, Tifa Lockhart, Cloud's beloved companion, and Vincent Valentine, a previous Turk who was made undying by Shinra experimentation. Amid the contention, Sephiroth brings a damaging spell called Meteor to mortally twisted the Planet. At the point when Aerith endeavors to call Holy, a guard component that can stop Meteor, she is executed by Sephiroth. In the end, the gathering are effective in vanquishing Sephiroth, and the Lifestream fortifies Holy, effectively ceasing Meteor. 

The "Arrangement" titles go about as continuations and developments on the center account, with them concentrating on different characters. "Coming Children" starts two years after "VII", when individuals over the world are capitulating to an ailment called Geostigma and Cloud, experiencing blame, is compelled to face Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo, symbols of Sephiroth's will. "Prior to Crisis" starts six years preceding the occasions of "VII", and pursues the encounters between the Turks and the first manifestation of AVALANCHE. "Emergency Core" happens in a comparative timeframe, yet pursues occasions from the perspective of Zack, a SOLDIER who become a close acquaintence with Cloud and was killed by Shinra troops in the wake of betraying the organization. Among the characters who collaborate with Zack is Genesis Rhapsodos, an individual from SOLDIER who effectively revolts and in the end chooses to secure the Planet. "Lament of Cerberus" is set a year after "Coming Children", and spotlights on Vincent's contention against Deepground, an order of SOLDIER that was caught underneath Midgar amid Meteor's drop. "Last Order" happens amid the occasions at Nibelheim, where Jenova was initially put away and Sephiroth first gotten some answers concerning himself. 

The "Accumulation of Final Fantasy VII" was made by Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura, the particular executive and character originator for "Definite Fantasy VII". It was at one point characterized by Square Enix as their initial move towards "polymorphic substance", a showcasing and deals system to "[provide] surely understood properties on a few stages, enabling presentation of the items to as wide a group of people as would be prudent." Speaking on why "VII" had been decided for such an undertaking, Kitase clarified that the closure left definitely greater improvement openings open for characters and setting than different diversions in the arrangement. There was additionally a solid money related advantage to making the "Compilation"Ã¢ÂÂfollowing the extraordinary budgetary upturn provoked by the arrival of "Definite Fantasy X-2" only preceding the 2003 merger of Square and Enix into Square Enix, at that point CEO Yoichi Wada chose that the organization could take advantage of fan requests for continuations of the tale of "Conclusive Fantasy VII". 

The primary title to be imagined was "Appearance Children", unique imagined as a short film introduction made by Visual Works, the activity studio behind CGI cutscenes for the organization's recreations. Ahead of schedule in pre-generation, plans to make "Appearance Children" a computer game as opposed to a film were considered, yet because of a few components including Visual Works' absence of involvement with genuine amusement creation, it remained a film. One of the principle conditions for the undertaking's dispatch was to rejoin the first staff individuals from "Conclusive Fantasy VII": Nojima, workmanship chief Yusuke Naora, author Nobuo Uematsu. After "Approach Children" started improvement, it was chosen by the group that one title was insufficient to completely investigate the "VII" universe. Accordingly, "Before Crisis", "Requiem of Cerberus" and "Emergency Core" were imagined in order to grasp more parts of the world and characters. Nomura himself was astonished at the formation of the amusements, having initially expected that the film would be the sole result of the task. 

Each title had an alternate driving force powering its creation and improvement: "Before Crisis" was brainstormed by Hajime Tabata, another worker at Square Enix's portable division, when asked by Nomura to make a computer game including the Turks. "Requiem of Cerberus" was motivated by Vincent's decision of weapon, Kitase's affection for first-individual shooters, and the test it would give designers. Preceding the arrangement cementing and the arrival of "Coming Children" and "Before Crisis", the group had considered other weapon using "Last Fantasy" heroes for such a diversion. "Emergency Core" started basically as either a "Last Fantasy" turn off or a port of "Before Crisis" for the PlayStation Portable, and after chats with Kitase and Nomura, it was chosen to make it another title in the "Arrangement". The production of "Before Crisis" after "Appearance Children" started a lettering recipe for the arrangement later utilized by the staff as regular contractions: 'air conditioning' meant "Coming Children", 'BC' for "Before Crisis", 'CC' for "Emergency Core" and 'DC' for "Requiem of Cerberus". The grouping was almost upset when "Emergency Core"s title was considered as "Before Crisis Core", yet the ""Before"" some portion of the title was before long dropped, adventitiously making the arrangement. 

"Prior to Crisis" started advancement in 2002. The "Aggregation" was first divulged in 2003 with the declaration of "Coming Children". None of the titles in the arrangement up to that point were customary pretending diversions like the first. The clarification for this was conventional RPGs took long creation periods and an extensive staff, which would have made the undertaking emerge a lot. One of different contemplations for the group was not to make the titles lightweight as "X-2" had been, because of reaction from parts of the fanbase. Then again, making "Last Fantasy X-2" reminded the group that they didn't have to stick to totally genuine customary RPGs, empowering the first production of the "Aggregation". While "Coming Children" was the primary "Gathering" title to start creation, it kept running into issues amid after generation, bringing about the first discharged title being "Before Crisis", regardless of it being the second title to start improvement. "Prior to Crisis" was additionally initially anticipated discharge in North America, however the cell phones accessible in North America at the time were not ready to deal with the amusement. What's more, the maker Kosei Ito left Square Enix in 2008 and Tabata proceeded onward to different ventures, leaving its limitation far-fetched. Japanese movement studio Madhouse made a business to advance "Before Crisis". Because of its prosperity and staff sentiments that imperative scenes from "VII" spoke to in "Appearance Children" had been unnecessarily disconnected, the studio was picked to deliver an energized film: this in the long run turned out to be "Last Order". "Emergency Core" was initially going to be an activity diversion, yet turned into an activity RPG, remaining inside the staff's plan qualities while joining activity components. 

Wada had expressed in 2006, while the advancement and arrival of "Arrangement" titles was all the while progressing, that the "Accumulation" could remain a functioning establishment until 2017, the twentieth commemoration of "Definite Fantasy VII"s discharge. Subsequent to completing work on "Approach Children Complete", the group declared that they would enjoy a reprieve from the arrangement, despite the fact that they expressed that regardless they have different thoughts for future titles. In later meetings identifying with "Conclusive Fantasy VII", numerous staff individuals including Nomura expressed that the "Gathering" was just at any point planned to reach out to three recreations and a film, finishing with the arrival of "Emergency Core". Their thinking was that discharging any more would soak the market. 

Contrasted with the first "VII", which got close general basic approval and later faction status as a great diversion, the sections in the "Gathering" have frequently earned a blended gathering, and the "Arrangement" all in all has been studied by a few. In July 2007, "Edge" magazine expressed that the titles "could be of a high caliber, however there is likewise a corruption of the first." RPG Site's Alex Donaldson, amid a survey for "Emergency Core", said that the "Accumulation" was "excessively far disconnected from the legend of "Definite Fantasy VII"." While investigating "Coming Children" and "Lament of Cerberus", and blaming "Before Crisis"s absence of the first diversion's characters, he felt that "Emergency Core" was the "Compilation"s "first exemplary ["Final Fantasy VII"] spinoff." "RPGFan"s Stephen Meyerink said that the "Aggregation" titles preceding "Emergency Core" had "extended, expanded, and retconned [the story] into what some would call an unrecognizable wreckage." Alexa Ray Corriea, composing for "Polygon", was very basic, saying that few of the "Assemblage" titles were great, and just served to "degrade the 1997 [PlayStation] unique." 

Surveys for "Appearance Children" have been blended to constructive: while pundits have applauded the introduction, illustrations and fan bid, all audits concur that the story's specific circumstance and conveyance were mistaking for individuals new to the arrangement. While western pundits were certain about "Last Order", the OAV got substantial fan analysis in Japan because of its retconning of key occasions, which incited the group to guarantee that the occasion was steadfastly reproduced in "Emergency Core". "Prior to Crisis", because of staying in Japan, has gotten constrained consideration in the west, yet reviews have been exceedingly positive, with many lauding the ongoing interaction and illustrations as being noteworthy for a versatile amusement. Suppositions for "Requiem of Cerberus" were distinctly blended. While many applauded the story and characters, particularly the attention on Vincent's character and improvement, pundits were blended to negative about the illustrations and ongoing interaction. Japanese magazine "Famitsu" prominently gave the diversion a postponed and exceedingly basic audit. "Emergency Core" was for the most part lauded, with many getting a charge out of the story's cozy introduction of the characters and activity arranged interactivity, regardless of some analysis for it being gone for devotees of "VII". Pundits of the "Aggregation" have by and large refered to "Emergency Core" as the best title of the arrangement. 

A large number of the titles have gotten solid deals. Through 2006, "Coming Children" met with high deals, with 1 million units sold in Japan, 1.3 million in North America, and 100,000 in Europe, making a sum of 2.4 million duplicates sold around the world. The first form proceeded to sell four million duplicates worldwide by 2009. "Coming Children Complete" likewise met with solid deals, selling 100,000 duplicates on its first day of discharge in Japan. "Coming Children Complete" was refered to as an explanation behind the expansion in offers of the PlayStation 3 comfort. "Prior to Crisis" enlisted 200,000 clients on dispatch day, making it the smash hit versatile amusement up until that time, and was gotten to 1.6 multiple times by June 2006. "Requiem of Cerberus" delivered 392,000 units in its first week, and proceeded to sell 460,000 units in North America and 270,000 units in Europe. "Emergency Core" sold 350,000 duplicates in Japan on its discharge date, while it sold 301,600 duplicates in its first month of discharge in the United States. It proceeded to sell 3.1 million units around the world. 

The procedure of thought behind the "Arrangement" would later rouse the formation of "Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy", a subseries of diversions connected by a typical mythos, and would utilize exercises gained from the "Gathering" generation process. On an individual dimension, "Before Crisis"s fame would rouse the formation of another portable title inside the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" subseries: initially titled "Last Fantasy Agito XIII", it would later change stages and be renamed "Last Fantasy Type-0". The fight groupings in "Appearance Children" likewise filled in as motivation for Motomu Toriyama while making the fight framework for "Definite Fantasy XIII". Previous staff individuals have accused the "Aggregation", related to different augmentations of titles like "Last Fantasy X", for undermining the arrangement's market nearness and fan trust in the West.
