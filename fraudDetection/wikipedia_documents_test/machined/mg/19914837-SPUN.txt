German Type U 66 submarine 

The Type U 66 was a class of five submarines or U-pontoons worked by the German Imperial Navy () amid World War I. The class is on the other hand alluded to as the U-66"- class or the Type UD. The class was worked by Germaniawerft of Kiel to their 506d plan as the U-7"- class for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The five vessels were sold to the Imperial Germany Navy toward the start of World War I when it was thought outlandish for the submarines to achieve the Mediterranean for conveyance to Austria-Hungary. 

The Austro-Hungarian Navy, after aggressively assessing six submarines of three remote structures, chose the Germaniwerft 506d or Type UD plan over a structure from Whitehead and Co. for the "U-7" class. The pontoons, numbered "U-7" to "U-11", were intended to be long and dislodge between when surfaced and submerged. They were to be equipped with five torpedo tubes and a deck weapon. For impetus the plan called for twin diesel motors for surface running and twin electric engines for subsurface development. The Austro-Hungarian Navy requested the vessels in February 1913 and development started on the primary pontoons in November. 

After the flare-up of World War I in August 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Navy ended up persuaded that conveyance of the still-incomplete submarines to the Mediterranean through Gibraltar would be unimaginable. Subsequently, they sold the five pontoons to the Imperial German Navy in November 1914. The German Navy relegated the numbers "U-66" to "U-70" to the five submarines and had them upgraded and recreated to their details. These changes, which incorporated a bigger deck firearm, expanded the uprooting of the U-pontoons by nearly surfaced and almost submerged. 

Every one of the five pontoons saw dynamic administration, and four sank at least 18 ships. Just , sunk six days into her first war watch in March 1916, had no victories. Two different pontoons, and vanished in 1917. The staying two U-pontoons, and , were surrendered to the United Kingdom and were separated by 1921. 

In 1904, the Austro-Hungarian Navy, in the wake of enabling the naval forces of different nations to pioneer submarine advancements, requested the Austrian Naval Technical Committee ( or ) to create a submarine structure. At the point when the Navy dismissed the January 1905 MTK structure and different plans submitted as a component of an open challenge as impracticable, they rather picked to arrange two submarines every one of structures by Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland for an aggressive assessment. 

In light of the preliminaries results, the Austro-Hungarian Navy decided the qualities that the up and coming age of Austro-Hungarian submarines ought to have. They were searching for a twofold hulled submarine of about relocation with diesel drive. They likewise needed a surface speed of , and for the vessel to be outfitted with somewhere in the range of three and five torpedo tubes. The Austro-Hungarian Navy chose the Germaniawerft 506d plan, otherwise called the Type UD, for the "U-7" class over the Type 48 configuration presented by Whitehead and Co., fundamentally due to the lower cost. The Navy requested five vessels on 1 February 1913. 

The "U-7" class was seen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy as an improved rendition of its , which was likewise a Germaniawerft structure. As intended for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the vessels were to dislodge superficially and keeping in mind that submerged. The multiplied hulled pontoons were to be long in general with a light emission a draft of . The Austrian particulars called for two shafts with twin diesel motors ( aggregate) for surface running at up to , and twin electric engines ( aggregate) for a limit of when submerged. 

The vessels were planned with five torpedo tubes; four situated in the bow, one in the stern. The pontoons' weapon was to likewise incorporate a solitary/26 deck firearm. 

After the Austro-Hungarian Navy's 1 February 1913 request, the initial two pontoons, "U-7" and "U-8", were set down at Germaniawerft on 1 November. "U-9" was set down toward the finish of December, and the last two pontoons, "U-10" and "U-11" were both started in February 1914. Development of the pontoons was slated to be finished inside 29 to 33 months. 

None of the submarines were finished when World War I started in August 1914. With the pontoons under development at Kiel, the Austrians wound up persuaded that it is difficult to take conveyance of the vessels, which would should be towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British domain. Subsequently, the five vessels of the class were exchanged to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914 after the development installment of 2 million Kronen had been returned. Germaniawerft was then granted "Kriegsauftrag D", subsequently the sort was known as "UD". 

After their buy, the vessels were relegated the numbers "U-66" to "U-70", and the class wound up known as the U 66 type. The Imperial German Navy had the submarines updated and remade to German gauges, which expanded the surface uprooting by and the submerged by . The torpedo load was expanded by a third, from 9 to 12, and the deck firearm was updated from the weapon initially indicated to a SK L/30 one. 

"U-66" was propelled on 22 April 1915, the first of the class, and was trailed by the other four around one like clockwork, with the last vessel, "U-70", hitting the water on 20 July. The vessels were altogether finished and charged into the Imperial German Navy among July and September. 

Every one of the vessels of the "U-66" class saw dynamic administration, and everything except one pontoon, , had wartime triumphs; and both sank more than 100,000 tons of Allied transporting. "U-68" was sunk by the British Q-send in March 1916, and was the primary pontoon of the class to be lost amid the war. "U-69" and "U-66" were lost in July and September 1917, individually. furthermore, "U-70" both endure the war and were surrendered to the United Kingdom in November 1918, and both were separated by 1921. 

"U-66", the lead pontoon of the class, was set down on 1 November 1913 (yard number 203) by Germaniawerft at Kiel and propelled on 22 April 1915. She was dispatched on 23 July 1915 under the order of "KapitÄÂ¤nleutnant" Thorwald von Bothmer. Amid the war, she sank 25 ships totaling .

English records recommend that "U-66" may have struck a mine or been sunk by destroyers, this isn't borne out by German records. 

"U-67" was set down on 1 November 1913 (yard number 204) by Germaniawerft at Kiel and propelled on 15 May 1915. She was authorized on 4 August 1915 under the order of "KorvettenkapitÄÂ¤n" Erich von Rosenberg-Grusczyski. "U-67" sank a sum of 18 ships () and harmed a further three ().

She was appointed on 17 August 1915 under the direction of "KapitÄÂ¤nleutnant" Ludwig GÄÅºntzel. Six days into her first war watch, "U-68" experienced the British Q-dispatch (Q-deliver number five) off Dingle and was sunk with all hands. "U-68" sank no boats amid her short administration profession. 

"U-69" was set down on 7 February 1914 (yard number 206) by Germaniawerft at Kiel and propelled on 24 June 1915. She was authorized on 4 September 1915 under the order of "KapitÄÂ¤nleutnant" Ernst Wilhelms. Amid her administration profession, "U-69" sank 31 ships with a joined gross register tonnage of 102,875, the biggest among them, the 13,441-ton outfitted trader cruiser . "U-69" was keep going gotten notification from on 11 July 1917 when she announced being off the bank of Norway. Her destiny is formally obscure, despite the fact that British reports credit her sinking to destroyer . The dates in German records, notwithstanding, don't bolster this case. 

"U-70" was set down on 11 February 1914 (yard number 207) by Germaniawerft at Kiel and propelled on 20 July 1915.
