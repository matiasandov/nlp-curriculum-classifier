Lisa Respers France of "CNN" "had an entire bundle of tissue" in her grasp when the cast sang the "Don't Stop" finale, and closed, "Very much played, "Merriment"." 

"Time" James Poniewozik said "while 'Bits of gossip' remained imperfect ... the structure enabled the show to serve the narratives, instead of feeling like the tales were there to support the melodies", and especially lauded how "the tunes were coordinated into the dramatization". Semigran and Erica Futterman of "Moving Stone" agreed with the last point, and Futterman composed that "in spite of a constrained subject reason, the melodies of "Bits of gossip" fit the New Directions' dramatization in a natural way." "The Atlantic" Kevin Fallon called the scene's emphasis on the Fleetwood Mac tunes "a reviving difference in pace".

Most different commentators were comparatively stricken with the "Fondue for Two" sections, including the previously mentioned Reiter, Poniewozik, Semigran, and Respers France. 

Futterman commended the arrival of Chenoweth's character April Rhodes, and "The Wall Street Journal" Raymund Flandez said that she "brings such delicacy, cleverness and craziness that is endearingly catch nose adorable".

As per Hankinson, "A standout amongst the best pieces of the scene based on Brittany and Santana, however I think all the principalsÃ¢ÂÂArtie, Finn, Rachel, and Quinn tooÃ¢ÂÂdid an incredible occupation depicting the pressure and doubt invading the group."

The scene in the motel live with Sam, Rachel, Finn and Sam's sibling and sister was classified "ostensibly the most influencing scene of the whole scene" by Handlen, and Poniewozik composed that "Harmony Overstreet sold Sam's sentiment of misfortune". Canning felt else: "It might have had a superior effect in the event that we thought progressively about Sam or if Chord Overstreet had conveyed increasingly credible tears, however as things were, it was only some conventional, blah dramatization." 

The improvements in the connection among Brittany and Santana got extensive consideration. John Kubicek of "BuddyTV" thought the plot was futile, and said it "came down to: I'm not prepared to turned out. I'm prepared. Presently I'm not once more."

The majority of the melodic numbers were by and large lauded, however only one out of every odd number was gotten with a similar eagerness. Benigno was disillusioned that there was "not much" in any of the courses of action, yet Futterman understood the exhibitions from with an improved point of view: "They're not as outwardly shocking, yet they're vocally a portion of the more amazing interpretations "Joy" has done all season." She said of the "Fantasies" interpretation by Chenoweth with Morrison, "The harmonies and stripped down plan make for one of "Joy" most steadfast covers yet." Most commentators respected the Chenoweth variant. Gonzalez gave the tune a "B+" and Brett Berk of "Vanity Fair" granted it four stars of five; both adulated Chenoweth however condemned Morrison. Semigran and Kubicek just offered credit to Chenoweth alone. Benigno asked why the pair were attempting to emulate Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham when he felt they were preferred artists over those two, and gave the tune a "B". 

Hankinson expressed, "I appreciated all the littler numbers today around evening time since I felt like the children truly sold the exhibitions and injected some decent passionate setting." Of these, "Failing to go Back Again" got the most steady endorsement. Futterman said it was "superior to Artie's post-Tina 'More grounded, and Kubicek pronounced it "verification that he's very great at hitting enthusiastic notes", while Semigran said she was "overwhelmed".

Kubicek called it "very engaging", Gonzalez felt the "irate singing" was "hot" and gave it an "AÃ¢ÂÂ", a similar evaluation as Benigno, who said the tune had "more oomph than the first", however he included that Finn "sings with the nuance of a big guns blast" and he was content with Quinn's "solid establishment in the back". Futterman composed that it was "superior to Quinn and Sam's 'Fortunate, however Berk gave the melody just two stars out of five, a similar evaluation he provided for "Go Your Own Way". Albeit both Kubicek and Gonzalez censured Rachel's inspirations in singing the melody, the last still gave it "An" and noted "in the event that I needed to tune in to somebody spread this tune, it'd be her". Semigran called it "one of Lea Michele's most grounded excursions all season", while Benigno said "this is one of those uncommon occasions her balls-to-the-dividers conveyance works with the course of action as opposed to diverting from it" and gave it an "A". Hankinson was "especially affectionate" of the melody, and included that it had "incredible vitality". 

The gathering finale of "Don't Stop" got great gradesÃ¢ÂÂ"A" from Gonzales and "B+" from Benigno, and four of five stars from Berk. Kubicek found a splendid spot in that Sam got the opportunity to sing a performance. The execution got encomiums, for example, "really extraordinary" from Semigran and "motivated" from Futterman.
