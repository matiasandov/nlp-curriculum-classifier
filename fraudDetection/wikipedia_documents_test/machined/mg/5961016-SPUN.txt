Following the re-association of the Australian Army in 1921, the brigade was brought again up in Victoria as a unit of the Citizens Force, getting to be known as the "HawthornÃ¢ÂÂKew Regiment". In 1937, it was amalgamated with the 37th Battalion to turn into the 37th/39th Battalion. Afterward, in August 1939 it was delinked with the 37th and amalgamated with the 24th Battalion to shape the 24th/39th Battalion, before being raised again as a solitary unit in October 1941. 

Amid World War II the unit was sent to New Guinea in 1942 as a major aspect of the 30th Brigade to protect the region against a Japanese assault. In this manner, among July and August of that year the unit was vigorously occupied with the resistance of Port Moresby, battling along the Kokoda Track. The 39th battled a few urgent activities against the Japanese as they endeavored to hold out until further fortifications could be raised from Port Moresby. They were likewise later engaged with the battling around BunaÃ¢ÂÂGona. Such was their inclusion in the fight that when they were pulled back they could just assemble 32 men and following its arrival to Australia, the unit was disbanded toward the beginning of July 1943. 

The 39th Battalion was first shaped on 21 February 1916 at the Ballarat Showgrounds, in Victoria, for administration amid World War I. Under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Rankine, the contingent was raised as a major aspect of a development of the First Australian Imperial Force (first AIF) that occurred at the finish of the Gallipoli Campaign. Most of the regiment's enlisted people originated from the Western District of Victoria, and together with the 37th, 38th and 40th Battalions, it framed the tenth Brigade, which was a piece of the third Division. Following a concise time of preparing in Ballarat, the 39th Battalion walked through Melbourne on 15 May as the city farewelled the unit and they along these lines set out upon HMAT "Ascanius" on 27 May 1916, headed for the United Kingdom. Cruising by means of Cape Town, the contingent arrived at Plymouth on 18 July 1916, and moved via train to Amesbury, before walking to Larkhill on Salisbury Plain, where they attempted a time of four months preparing before being sent to France in November. In the wake of finishing the Channel crossing on 23/24 November, they arrived at Le Havre and moved to the front via train. The evening of 10 December, the force had its spot in the channels along the Western Front, assuaging its sister contingent, the 37th, around Houplines in the Armentieres segment. They stayed at the front for the following week, as a feature of first experience with channel fighting, amid which time the brigade repulsed a little German attack and conveyed watches into "a dead zone". 

In the wake of having persevered through a long winter in Flanders serving in principally a cautious job, the contingent's first real commitment came at Messines, in Belgium toward the beginning of June 1917. The fight started severely for the 39th. Close Ploegsteert Corner, amid the walk to the line of flight, the legion endured a high number of setbacks following a German gas assault which in this manner came about the 39th just having the capacity to marshal about 33% of its labor for the assault, adding up to an ambush power of just 120 men. Regardless of this, the 39th was immediately redesigned into a solitary wave, and assaulting on the tenth Brigade's correct, it thusly defeated the underlying German restriction confronting them and afterward, amid the second period of the fight propelled south of Douve, on the southern edge of the Messines Ridge. It was engaged with further battling north of Gray Farm, where they were at first held up by German assault rifle shoot, however after this was conquered they kept on progressing to their last goal, in the long run delving in past the ranch, having figured out how to catch the majority of its destinations. Afterward, in October, the 39th Battalion partook in two other real assaults in that equivalent division, right off the bat at Broodseinde and afterward at Passchendaele, the first was a splendid achievement, while the second was a heartbreaking disappointment. 

Amid the battling around Broodseinde on 4 October, the 39th shaped the third flood of the tenth Brigade's assault, which went in around 6:00Ã¢Â am. Following up the 37th and 38th Battalions, they progressed against unequivocally held pill-boxes towards the Gravenstafel Switch. Subsequent to delving in, a gathering from the 39th joined the 40th Battalion as it propelled the last wave in the unit's assault. As the 40th faced firm resistance, more men from the 39th were pushed forward and the goal was at long last verified around 11:00Ã¢Â am. After the fight, the 39th stayed in the line until 6 October, when it was pulled back to Morbecque for rearrangement and rest. A few days after the fact, the contingent was recommitted to the battling and requested to progress towards Passchendaele Ridge, assaulting on the morning of 12 October notwithstanding overwhelming precipitation the past night. In the substantial battling that pursued, the contingent figured out how to verify its first goal, however was compelled to pull back when its flanks ended up undermined as neighboring units had been unfit to progress with them through the thick mud. 

Throughout the following five months, the 39th Battalion pivoted between the cutting edge and back territories, holding the line in Belgium all through winter. In the spring of 1918, when the German Army propelled its last exertion at triumph, known as the Spring Offensive, the 39th was among the numerous Australian regiments that were quickly moved south to France so as to stem the tide of the German invasion towards Amiens; battling a progression of cautious activities in the Somme between late March and early June. At the point when the Allies propelled their own offensiveÃ¢ÂÂthe Hundred Days OffensiveÃ¢ÂÂon 8 August 1918, the legion alongside the remainder of the tenth Brigade, was filling in as the divisional hold and they didn't partake in the development that has since turned out to be known as one of the best days for the Allies on the Western Front. On 10 August, the contingent was resolved to fight afresh, attempted an assault on the town of Proyart, yet this assault was strange and at last fizzled. Regardless of this, the brigade stayed in the line all through August and early September as the third Division progressed through the Somme Valley. 

The brigade attempted its last significant activity of the war toward the finish of September 1918 when, serving close by the Americans, they broke pieces of the Hindenburg Line along the St Quentin Canal. Amid this last fight, the force's long serving leader, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Henderson, who had taken direction in February 1917 preceding the unit's first real fight, was executed in real life. Late on 2 October, while around Gillemont Crescent, the 39th was soothed and the contingent was expelled from the line to embrace preparing and rearrangement. Amidst October, the 39th was supported by an organization of fortifications from the 37th, which had been disbanded to help make up misfortunes in the other tenth Brigade units. All things considered, the 39th did not see activity again and they were still at the back when the Armistice was pronounced on 11 November 1918. With the battling about, the procedure of retirement started and gradually the men started walking out for repatriation to Australia. At long last, in March 1919, the 39th Battalion was disbanded. Now, the force's residual staff were amalgamated with different units to shape the tenth Demobilization Regiment, with the remainder of its warriors coming back to Australia in May. 

Over the span of the war the 39th Battalion endured 405 men slaughtered, while a further 1,637 were injured. Individuals from the unit got the accompanying enhancements: two Distinguished Service Orders (DSOs), one Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), 14 Distinguished Conduct Medals (DCMs), 14 Military Crosses (MCs), 78 Military Medals (MMs) with three Bars, and 22 Mentions in Despatches (MIDs). For their contribution in the battling on the Western Front, the 39th Battalion were granted 14 fight distinctions in 1927. 

Toward the finish of World War I there was a discount disbandment of units of the Australian Army as the wartime Army was disbanded and its staff deactivated. In 1921, it was chosen that there was a need to raise low maintenance military power, known as the Citizens Force, which would assume liability for the safeguard of the Australian territory. This power was sorted out similarly of the first AIF, and the units raised kept a similar numerical assignment as the first AIF forces. The AIF stopped to exist formally on 1 April 1921, and the Citizens Force was revamped the next month on 1 May, embracing the numerical assignments and structures of the AIF. As a piece of this, the 39th Battalion was brought up in 1921 in Melbourne. Upon arrangement, the legion was connected to the tenth Brigade, third Division, and the force drew staff from the 22nd and 24th Infantry Regiments and the 29th Light Horse. 

In 1927, regional assignments were embraced and the force accepted the title of the "Hawthorn Regiment". After three years this was changed to the "HawthorneÃ¢ÂÂKew Regiment". It expected the proverb of "Factis Non Verbis" in 1927. At first, the regiment was kept up to quality with volunteers and men serving under the terms of the necessary preparing plan, yet in 1929 the plan was suspended by the recently chose Scullin Labor government and the Citizen Forces were renamed the Militia. The mix of the conclusion to mandatory preparing and the money related hardships of the Great Depression implied that there were not many volunteers accessible as men couldn't chance losing their business to attempt preparing and subsequently all through the 1930s various units were amalgamated or disbanded as the extent of the Army was decreased. In 1937, the 39th Battalion was converged with the 37th Battalion, before later being delinked with the 37th in August 1939 and being amalgamated with the 24th Battalion, turning into the 24th/39th Battalion. A union with the Dorsetshire Regiment was affirmed in 1930. 

On 1 October 1941, the Australian Military Board issued a request re-raising the 39th Battalion as a solitary unit of the Australian Military Forces, as Militiamen were called up for national administration. The aim was to raise the regiment to calm the Queensland-based 49th Battalion, which was filling in as an army compel around Port Moresby, and from the start the contingent was framed from men who were exchanged from an assortment of infantry and light steed units, including the 24th/39th Battalion that had been sent at Nagambie Road, in Seymour, Victoria, just as components from the Militia second Cavalry and third and fourth Infantry Divisions. Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Conran turned into the regiment's new leader, having recently presented with the 23rd Battalion amid World War I, and in the Citizens Military Force after the war. 

The regiment central command was opened at Darley Camp, close Bacchus Marsh, and by 8 October 1941, a core of officers and senior non-authorized officers (NCOs), a large number of whom had understanding from World War I, had arranged the contingent for the landing of the warriors or different positions (ORs) that would convey it up to its required foundation. On 10 October 1941, the primary draft of nine officers and 523 men from the third Infantry Division amassed at Caulfield Racecourse Transit Camp and were transported by rail to Darley Camp. The next day numbers expanded further with the entry of another seven officers and 400 men from the second Cavalry and fourth Infantry Divisions. Afterward, in June 1942, after it had landed in New Guinea, the legion's quality was supported with the exchange of 16 officers from the Second Australian Imperial Force (second AIF), including another leader, Lieutenant Colonel William Owen. 

On 21 November 1941, the 39th Battalion strutted through the roads of Melbourne with weapons. It had taken 52 days to shape the unit and keeping in mind that the regiment had still been understrength, they were announced prepared for preparing. At last, in any case, as occasions in the Pacific unfurled, this preparation was stopped and the force was just ready to embrace one preparing exercise in this time. This activity was code named the "Skirmish of Corangamite", and was led in the Victorian Western District, toward the finish of October. 

Two days after the Japanese assault on the US armada at Pearl Harbor and the British in Malaya, on 9 December 1941 the legion was requested to "plan to move" as it was prepared for war administration. The risk of intrusion by the Japanese changed the key circumstance and with it the arranging figures of the Australian central leadership. In that capacity, rather than diminishing the 49th Battalion, the 39th was joined with the 49th and the New South Wales-based 53rd Battalion to frame the 30th Brigade, and plans were made for the whole development to convey to New Guinea. Christmas Day 1941 was spent in camp, before the 39th Battalion was stacked onto two trains the next day for a fast move north. One train went directly to Albury and the other left from Spencer Street station, Melbourne, after two hours. The two trains touched base in Sydney at 10:40 hours, on 27 December 1941. The regiment at that point detrained and moved by ship to Woolloomooloo Wharf where the 1,068 officers, NCOs and men of the force boarded the traveler deliver the "Aquitania" destined for New Guinea. 

At first upon their entry in New Guinea in January 1942 the 39th Battalion was utilized to safeguard the landing strip at Seven Mile Aerodrome close Port Moresby and to do different other army errands, for example, building protections and emptying stores at the wharf. In May 1942, the brigade's leader, Conran, was esteemed therapeutically unfit for administration and on 24 May he surrendered order. In June 1942, as the military circumstance in New Guinea disintegrated further, the legion got requests to climb the Kokoda Track so as to go about as a blocking power against the likelihood of a Japanese development overland from the north. So as to counter this risk, Maroubra Force made out of troops the 39th Battalion and the Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB) were sent to Kokoda, landing there on 15 July. This move demonstrated insightful as a vast Japanese power arrived at Gona just seven days after the fact, and they rapidly started to move inland towards Kokoda. 

The main conflict happened at Awala on 23 July, when a detachment from 'B' Company, under the direction of Captain Sam Templeton, having obliterated the footbridge over the Kumusi River, drew in the Japanese on the most distant side of the waterway. The Australians were compelled to pull back, be that as it may, when many Japanese marines started crossing the stream under a blast of mortar and assault rifle shoot. They pulled back just a couple of miles, before Templeton set up an effective snare for the propelling Japanese on the banks of the Gorari Creek. By and by, they were constrained back further towards the high ground at Oivi where they endeavored to persevere while Templeton attempted to reach force central command and the remainder of the legion who were spread out further along the track, so as to get more fortifications. 

On the night of 29 July the Japanese assaulted the primary position Kokoda. There were just 80 men from 'B' Company left around then, and furnished just with little arms and a couple of Bren light automatic weapons, they were no counterpart for the striking Japanese. Losses on the two sides were high as the Australians turned to hand-to-hand battle, and the legion's leader, Lieutenant Colonel William Owen, who had flown in to assume control over the force following Templeton's passing, was executed while sorting out the withdrawal. It turned out to be evident that Kokoda was lost and the next morning, under the front of a thick fog, with the PIB's boss, Major William Watson, expecting impermanent order, the survivors deserted the position and fell back towards the town of Deniki, a mile or so back along the Kokoda Track towards Isurava. 

The remainders of 'B' Company regrouped at Deniki, however they were in a terrible state and when on 4 August, Major Allan Cameron, detachment major of the 30th Brigade, touched base to assume responsibility for Maroubra Force, a large portion of them were sent back to Isurava in disrespect as he was under the mixed up conviction that they had fled from the battling. By and by, on 8 August the remainder of the 39th Battalion, presently without the main troops who had any experience battling the Japanese, propelled a counterattack at Kokoda. They figured out how to verify one side of the runway, yet because of the closeness of the Japanese on the opposite side, help air ship were unfit to land and shy of nourishment and ammo, they were compelled to fall back to Deniki indeed after just about two days of battling. They in the end figured out how to stop the Japanese development and on 14 August Maroubra Force fell back to Isurava. 

Now the battling stopped for right around about fourteen days and amid this time the 39th was joined by the 53rd and the 30th Brigade home office; and Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner touched base from Ilolo to take direction. Achieving the regiment at Isurava on 16 August, he in this manner started sorting out the unit's safeguard of Isurava. On 23 August Brigadier Arnold Potts took over direction of Maroubra Force and further fortifications touched base as first the 2/fourteenth, 2/sixteenth and later the 2/27th Battalions from the seventh Division's 21st Brigade likewise achieved the territory. Regardless of this, the circumstance stayed depressing as the supply issue was turning into a significant issue for the Australians and the fortifications that had arrived were additionally in a mess having been focused on the fight in a piecemeal manner and experiencing seriously craving and ailment. 

In spite of the fact that the Japanese were encountering comparative issues in connection to provisions, they started their development by and by on 26 August and regardless of a few tough cautious activities the Australians were constrained back once more, first to Eora Creek on 30 August, at that point Templeton's Crossing on 2 September, lastly to Efogi three days after the fact. Depleted from their endeavors and no longer ready to be viewed as a successful battling power, the 39th was eased and sent down the track to Koitaki to rest. They had carried out the responsibility that was expected of them, having slowed down the Japanese development so as to enable fortifications to be raised. These fortifications came in the state of the 25th Brigade, including the 2/25th, 2/31st and 2/33rd Battalions. Harsh battling resulted around Ioribaiwa and the Australians pulled back indeed on 17 September, this opportunity to Imita Ridge; in any case, the Japanese had achieved their point of confinement and on 24 September started to pull back. The Australians accordingly propelled a counter-hostile in October and by 2 November, Kokoda was back in Australian hands. 

Following the 39th Battalion's withdrawal from the line in September 1942, they went through a month at Koitaki before being sent back to Port Moresby in mid-October, where they were nitty gritty to plan guarded positions. In November, they were joined to the 21st Brigade, and all through December the 39th Battalion was engaged with further battling as the detachment battled around Gona and Haddy's Village. Amid this time the 39th endured overwhelming setbacks, yet the battling proceeded and having caught the Gona Mission, the contingent moved to the Sanananda Track on 21 December, taking up a forward position at Huggins' Road Block. In the New Year the legion was pulled back to Soputa and came back to the 30th Brigade. They had endured substantial setbacks and in January 1943, when it was flown back to Port Moresby, it had a facing of just seven officers and 25 men. In February, the 39th was requested to get ready for activities in the Wau territory, fully expecting a further Japanese assault, however this assault did not eventuate and on 12 March the 39th Battalion left for the arrival voyage to Australia. 

Following the 39th Battalion's arrival to Australia, the men were given a time of leave before 30th Brigade was reconstituted on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland. At first, the arrangement was to rearrange the unit and reconstruct it before returning it to New Guinea, yet in July it was chosen that the 30th Brigade, alongside its part battalionsÃ¢ÂÂthe 39th, 49th, and third BattalionsÃ¢ÂÂwould be disbanded and used to strengthen the sixth Division, with fortifications being sent to the sixteenth and nineteenth Brigades. This became effective on 3 July 1943 and because of this choice, the Militiamen that had been called up for administration were exchanged to the 36th Battalion, a Militia regiment from New South Wales, while the individuals who had volunteered for abroad administration were sent to the 2/second Battalion; both of these units later observed further administration in New Guinea. 

Toward the finish of the force's inclusion in the battling in New Guinea, 1,666 men had served in its positions. The legion endured 403 battle setbacks, which comprised of 118 murdered in real life, 13 passed on of wounds, five kicked the bucket different causes, and 266 injured in real life. Sickness and illness likewise incurred significant damage and thus, following a half year of battle the 39th Battalion's marshal roll was just seven officers and 25 different positions. For their administration amid World War II individuals from the 39th Battalion got the accompanying adornments: two MBEs, one DSO, four DCMs, seven MCs, 10 MMs, one US Distinguished Service Cross and 11 MIDs. The 39th got eight fight praises for the war in 1961; it was the main Australian unit to get the "Kokoda Trail" fight respect. 

The 39th Battalion got the accompanying fight respects: 

Since the finish of the war, the 39th Battalion's contribution in the battling around Kokoda has turned into a critical piece of the account encompassing the Anzac legend and Australia's development as a cutting edge country. The force's activities were first appeared in Damien Parer's 1942 film "Kokoda Front Line", and all the more as of late in the 2006 Australian motion picture "Kokoda", which depended incompletely on Victor Austin's "To Kokoda and Beyond". 

After the war when Australia's low maintenance military powers were changed in 1948, while numerous brigades that had been disbanded amid the war were re-raised, the 39th was most certainly not. On 8 August 2006, the Australian Army raised the 39th (Personnel Support) Battalion (later re-assigned the 39th Operational Support Battalion), embracing the 39th's numerical assignment so as to propagate them on the request of fight. Amid the function that was held at the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne, the Governor General, Major General Michael Jeffery, depicted the 39th Battalion as a portion of "Australia's most chivalrous officers", expressing that the Australian country was obligated to them for "their brave administration".
