The cell phone was divulged on 19 February 2013 at press occasions in New York City and London and is HTC's seventh leader cell phone. It is the successor to the organization's 2012 lead demonstrate, the One XÃ¢ÂÂwhich was widely praised, however industrially fruitless due to some degree to deficient promoting endeavors. To make the gadget emerge among its opposition, the HTC One was created with a noteworthy accentuation on novel equipment and programming highlights; which incorporated a unibody aluminum outline, a 1080p full-HD show, double forward looking stereo speakers, a camera with a custom picture sensor and the capacity to consequently produce montages of media, a refreshed variant of HTC's Sense client experience, BlinkFeedÃ¢ÂÂan aggregator of news and informal community content, and an electronic program manage application with the capacity to fill in as a general remote by means of an IR blaster situated in the gadget's capacity catch.

Assembling postpones prompted a stunned discharge starting in late March, with its discharge date in specific markets, (for example, Asia and North America) pushed to late-April. By the by, with around 5 million units being sold amid its initial two months of overall accessibility, HTC expressed that the One was the best dispatch in the organization's history. 

The HTC One was adulated for the nature of its modern plan, high-thickness 468 ppi show, and high-control 2.6W RMS stereo sound framework, and was generally welcomed for its general execution and improved client involvement in contrast with prior HTC gadgets. In any case, a few parts of the gadget, for example, its photograph quality, battery life, and certain components of the gadget's working framework, were liable to investigation by faultfinders. The gadget has gotten various honors and awards, including being named "Best New Mobile Device" by the GSM Association at Mobile World Congress 2013, and was named the best cell phone of 2013 at a similar meeting one year later. It was prevailing by the HTC One (M8) on 25 March 2014. 

In spite of the fact that HTC has built up a few striking Android gadgets, for example, the DreamÃ¢ÂÂthe first freely discharged Android gadget, it neglected to gain by the principal mover advantage, and has battled monetarily as of late because of the expanding piece of the pie caught by different sellers, for example, Samsung and Apple. In certain business sectors, HTC discharged various transporter explicit telephones and depended intensely on remote suppliers to advance its items, a system that was ineffective notwithstanding Samsung and Apple's solid showcasing endeavors. The organization's leader telephone in 2012, the One X, got basic praise from analysts, however was industrially ineffective in the wake of the Galaxy S III and the iPhone 5. Accordingly, the organization intended to go out on a limb with their next leader gadget to make it emerge among its rivals, and furthermore wanted to play a more straightforward job in advancing its productsÃ¢ÂÂdoubling its advertising spending plan for 2013. 

Subtleties of the new gadget, codenamed "M7", were spilled from different sources in the weeks preceding its official divulging. HTC's CEO Peter Chou authoritatively affirmed and quickly uncovered a model for the new gadget amid an organization occasion on 1 February 2013. Spilled data theorized that the M7 would incorporate a 1080p showcase, a quad-center processor, an updated adaptation of HTC's Sense programming, and convey plan attributes from the Butterfly.

In the United Kingdom, online pre-orders were dispatched by certain bearers around the season of HTC's declaration. In late-April 2013, the HTC One was discharged crosswise over real transporters in the United States and Australia, and a system opened 32ÃÂ GB form likewise ended up accessible on the HTC web store. In the U.S., the 64 GB HTC One is only sold by AT&T. Following the deferrals, HTC North Asia's leader Jack Tong declared that the organization would twofold its generation limit with regards to the gadget by mid-May to fulfill developing need and rivalry for the gadget, and to compensate for deals lost by the discharge delays. On 22 August 2013, four months after it was discharged by its rivals, Verizon Wireless turned into the last real transporter to discharge the HTC One in the United States. 

Close by its stock silver model, the HTC One has been offered in three extra shading completions; dark, red, and blue. Shading variations are selective to specific transporters and retailers; in Australia, the dark variation is restrictive to Telstra, while the red variation (discharged in July 2013) has been elite to Phones 4u in the UK and Sprint in the US. The blue variation (discharged in September 2013) is selective to Carphone Warehouse in the UK and Best Buy in the US. A champagne-shaded HTC One was discharged on select European bearers in late-November 2013. 

An extraordinary variation electroplated in 18 carat gold was disclosed by HTC in October 2013 as a feature of a joint effort with Goldgenie and the Music of Black Origin Awards. Five models were delivered in a restricted generation run; out of the five, one model was given to the champ of the "Best Newcomer" classification at the service in Glasgow on 19 October, and others were given away in a limited time challenge. Talking about the association, HTC's EMEA president Phil Blair clarified that "the best craftsmen have dependably been given gold plates to praise their prosperity, yet today a great many people tune in to music on their telephone. We needed to praise that reality." Valued at US$4,442 (ÃÅ2,750), the gold HTC One is the most costly item created in organization history. 

In April 2013, Nokia was conceded a starter directive in the Netherlands against STMicroelectronics, which had provided HTC with mouthpiece parts for the gadget that contained Nokia's restrictive innovation. In spite of the order being against STM, Nokia still utilized the directive to openly blame HTC for duplicating innovation from its items. HTC would in any case have the capacity to utilize the rest of the mouthpieces it obtained in accordance with some basic honesty; the culpable segment was supplanted with an elective form in future creation runs. 

In December 2013, the HTC One Mini was restricted from deal in the United Kingdom as the consequence of another patent encroachment claim by Nokia. While the HTC One was likewise influenced by the decision, its business boycott was remained by the court pending an intrigue; the judge showed that restricting HTC One deals would negatively affect the organization. The case additionally unintentionally uncovered that HTC was intending to dispatch a successor to the HTC One in mid 2014. 

The HTC One uses a unibody aluminum outline sourced from custom-grade aluminum; the decision of material was planned to give the gadget a strong, premium feel in contrast with cell phones made with a plastic shell. The casing is carved with diverts in which the polycarbonate is inset utilizing zero-hole infusion shaping. The polycarbonate frames a band around the edge of the gadget, covers the top and base finishes, and separates the back with two lines, one of which streams around the camera underneath. The two polycarbonate groups over the back are utilized to protect its radio wires, while the ring around the camera is utilized as a circle reception apparatus for the One's close field correspondence (NFC) usefulness. Close by its showcase are two aluminum endpieces with a tight matrix of laser-cut gaps shaping the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are easily decorated on the left half of the edge. The unibody outline itself takes something like 200 minutes of exactness CNC slicing to machine, and the last outcome is a strong slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and safety glass with chamfered, cleaned edges. 

Two capacitive route keys, "Back" and "Home", are situated beneath the presentation, flanked by HTC's logo in the middle. While other late HTC gadgets, (for example, the One X) utilized a three-key format with "Back", "Home", and "Ongoing applications" keys, HTC architects trusted that utilizing just two route keys rather than three would decrease client perplexity. Similarly as with other HTC gadgets coming up short on an equipment "Menu" key (according to overhauled Android human interface rules presented in 2012, which deplore their utilization), applications that have not been refreshed to mirror the fresher rules show a "Menu" catch on a dark bar on the base of the screen. 

The HTC One uses a 4.7 inch, 1080p Super LCD 3 touchscreen showcase with a pixel thickness of 468 ppi. The rear of the gadget houses the camera, the LED glimmer, and the optional receiver.

The gadget joins a 1.7ÃÂ GHz quad-center Snapdragon 600, an ARMv7 SoC, with 2ÃÂ GB of RAM. The chip offers help for LTE systems where they are accessible. Most HTC One demonstrates accompany either 32 or 64 GB of inside, non-expandable storageÃ¢ÂÂunlike the worldwide model, the Chinese and Japanese models incorporate a microSD space and a removable back spread. Its interior segments are organized in a pyramid-like format like the HTC Butterfly and HTC Windows Phone 8X with bigger parts, (for example, the screen and battery) situated towards the front and littler segments, (for example, the motherboard) situated towards the back. This inward design likewise enables the gadget to have a bended sponsorship. 

The One's sound framework joins two forward looking BoomSound stereo speakers, Beats Audio programming equalizer, and HDR sound chronicle. The BoomSound sound system is constrained by two five-volt NXP TFA9887 incorporated circuits joining NXP's CoolFlux sound DSP, a class-D enhancer with ebb and flow detecting, and a DC-to-DC converter to support the yield dimension of small scale speakers up to multiple times (up to 2.6ÃÂ W RMS) without harming the driver. 

The HTC One is outfitted with a 4.0-megapixel back confronting camera module that contains a custom picture sensor advertised as UltraPixel, which is made out of pixels that are 2.0Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m in size. Most top of the line cell phones at the season of its discharge utilized 8-or 13-megapixel cameras with pixel sizes extending from 1.4 to 1.0Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m, the two of which are significantly littler in size than the pixels found in the One's UltraPixel sensor. In spite of the fact that these littler pixel sizes were commonly important to guarantee that the camera sensor did not bargain the plan of the telephone, there were worries this could result in lost unique range and affectability, and furthermore result in poor execution in low-light conditions. All things considered, HTC expressed that its camera plan with bigger sensor pixels could quite build by and large picture quality, particularly in low-light situations. The camera additionally incorporates optical picture adjustment, and is additionally upgraded by enhancements to the Sense camera programming and the ImageChip 2 picture processor. 

In September 2013, HTC affirmed "secluded reports" of clients encountering a purple or red tint with the camera in low-light conditions.

That fix was not propelled until the finish of 2015, prompting the need to send the gadgets to be physically fixed by HTC. 

The HTC One is fueled by Android, a Linux-based open source working framework created by Google. Among different highlights, the product enables clients to keep up altered home screens which can contain alternate routes to applications and gadgets for showing data. Four alternate ways to much of the time utilized applications can be put away on a dock at the base of the screen; the catch in the focal point of the dock opens the application cabinet, which shows a menu containing the majority of the applications introduced on the gadget. A warnings plate open by pulling from the highest point of the screen enables clients to see notices got from different applications, just as empower the One's "Capacity Saver" mode.

The HTC One transported with Android 4.1.2 "Jam Bean" and form 5.0 of HTC's exclusive Sense programming suite. In contrast with past forms of the product, Sense 5 utilizes a level, moderate visual style with revived symbols and the consolidated variation of the Roboto textual style family. Rather than a customary home screen show with applications and gadgets, Sense 5 defaults to a screen known as BlinkFeed, a news aggregator which shows a looking over matrix of news features from chosen sources (as syndicated by Mobiles Republic) and informal organization content likewise to Flipboard and Windows PhoneÃ¢ÂÂs live tiles. New substance is synchronized like clockwork when associated with a versatile system, yet more much of the time while on Wi-Fi. Legitimately over the BlinkFeed show is a clock which shows the userÃ¢ÂÂs neighborhood time and climate gauge; the mark flip clock gadget seen on past HTC gadgets was supplanted by a more straightforward advanced clock for Sense 5. Several diverse clock structures by HTCÃ¢ÂÂs architects, limited to 25, were considered before the last plan was picked. Likewise with past forms of Sense, clients can in any case include or expel pages the home screen for lodging application easy routes and gadgets; one such page is given of course, and which page to show as a matter of course can be set by the client. Nonetheless, BlinkFeed will dependably involve the furthest left page of the home screen. The application cabinet utilizes a 3x4 matrix to show application alternate ways of course, yet can in any case be changed back to the denser 4x5 lattice utilized by past renditions. Applications can likewise be arranged into organizers inside the cabinet; various preset envelopes are given, for example, "Google", "Media", "Efficiency", "Instruments", and pre-stacked applications given by the client's remote bearer, where material. 

The camera application incorporates another shooting mode known as Zoe (suggesting the zoetrope), which catches a short video close by every photograph taken.

Similarly as with all gadgets in the One arrangement, 25ÃÂ GB of Dropbox stockpiling is accessible free for a long time. Utilizing NFC, the One can likewise share content between other good Android gadgets with Android Beam, and lead versatile installments where perfect frameworks, (for example, FeliCa in Japan) are accessible.
