Clark Shaughnessy 

Clark Daniel Shaughnessy (initially O'Shaughnessy) (March 6, 1892 Ã¢ÂÂ May 15, 1970) was an American football mentor and trend-setter. He is here and there called the "father of the T development" and the first author of the forward pass, despite the fact that that framework had recently been utilized as ahead of schedule as the 1880s. Shaughnessy did, in any case, modernize the out of date T arrangement to make it by and by applicable in the game, especially for the quarterback and the collector positions. He utilized his advancements most broadly on offense, yet on edge side of the ball also, and he earned a notoriety for being a perpetual experimenter. 

Shaughnessy held head training positions at Tulane University, Loyola University New Orleans, the University of Chicago, Stanford University, the University of Maryland, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Hawaii, and in the National Football League with the Los Angeles Rams. Shaughnessy additionally served in warning limits with the Chicago Bears and the Washington Redskins. 

He achieved the stature of his accomplishment in 1940, in his first season at Stanford, where he drove the Indians to an undefeated season that finished with a Rose Bowl triumph. That year, he additionally arranged the Chicago Bears for the 1940 NFL Championship Game, in which they directed Washington, 73Ã¢ÂÂ0. Shaughnessy's triumphs exhibited the viability of the T arrangement and empowered its across the board reception. He was drafted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1968. Shaughnessy additionally instructed school b-ball at Tulane University. He played school football at the University of Minnesota. 

Shaughnessy was conceived on March 6, 1892 in St. Cloud, Minnesota, the second child of Lucy Ann (Foster) and Edward Shaughnessy. His dad Edward moved from Limerick, Ireland following his sibling Michael O'Shaughnessy, and changed his name from O'Shaughnessy - dropping the "O". He went to North St. Paul High School, and preceding school, had no athletic experience. When he went to the University of Minnesota, in any case, he played school football under head mentor Henry L. Williams and close by halfback Bernie Bierman. Shaughnessy believed Williams to be football's most noteworthy instructor, and Williams believed him to be the best passer from the Midwest. Shaughnessy took care of both the passing and kicking obligations for the group. 

He played on the green bean squad in 1910 and on the varsity squad from 1911 to 1913, first as an end, at that point a handle in 1912, lastly as a fullback in 1913. Of the three, Shaughnessy said he favored the handle position. In 1912, he recuperated three mishandles against Iowa, and Walter Camp named him an other on his All-America group. As a senior, Shaughnessy was named to the All-Big Ten Conference first group. 

Shaughnessy played ball as a watchman and ran track in the 440-and 880-yard occasions. The Minnesota athletic chief requested that he join the ball crew before an amusement against Illinois, regardless of the reality he had never played and did not know the tenets. He joined the olympic style sports crew in comparative design, and supplanted a half-mile sprinter despite the fact that he didn't possess and had never worn track spikes. In "The Big Ten: A Century of Excellence", Shaughnessy was designated "a standout amongst the most flexible competitors in Minnesota's history." Shaughnessy additionally contended as a rower with the St. Paul Boat Club. He was an individual from the Sigma Chi brotherhood. 

After graduation, he stayed at his place of graduation, Minnesota, for one season as an associate mentor in 1914. Tulane University chose Shaughnessy as head football mentor in 1915 over potential hopefuls Dana X. Book of scriptures and Charley Moran, among others. Notre Dame colleague mentor Knute Rockne and Ray Morrison were both unfit to make a trip to New Orleans for a meeting, and Tulane authorities required an eye to eye meeting with the candidates. The school offered Shaughnessy $1,875 ($ balanced for swelling) to be its football, ball, and track mentor, and athletic chief. When he arrived, he found the football field in a condition of decay and the gear to be woefully insufficient. Since the athletic office was in critical money related straits, Shaughnessy paid to buy new hardware for the group. With just a single rival planned for the up and coming season, he composed letters to sixty schools to verify extra diversions. 

Shaughnessy acquainted with Tulane the Minnesota move, an advancement made by his previous mentor Henry L. Williams. By 1919, Shaughnessy had changed Tulane into a contender among Southern university groups. That season, he guided them to a then school record of seven sequential successes. In 1920, Germany Schulz was employed to assume control over obligations as athletic executive, and he likewise supported Shaughnessy as the line mentor from 1923 to 1925. 

In 1923, Shaughnessy contracted his previous partner Bernie Bierman as an associate mentor. Bierman stayed on the staff for three seasons before he left to move toward becoming head mentor at Mississippi A&M. In 1924, Tulane set another school record for wins and completed with a 8Ã¢ÂÂ1 record. The accompanying season, the Green Wave bested the earlier year's point and posted a 9Ã¢ÂÂ0Ã¢ÂÂ1 record. School authorities declined a challenge to confront Washington in the Rose Bowl, since they trusted the Tulane players were excessively little. Indiana University endeavored to enlist Shaughnessy after his undefeated season, yet he rather marked a ten-year expansion with Tulane. 

In a 1926 article composed for the NEA News Service, he reacted to the individuals who asked him how the "Shaughnessy System" worked so well. He stated, "If there is a 'Shaughnessy framework' at Tulane, on the off chance that it has any 'mystery,' two words tell the entire storyÃ¢ÂÂcommon sense. All that I have done at Tulane is take the material I found and train it in plays worked around the individual capacities of each man." 

Regardless of hopeful preseason expectations, Tulane endured its solitary losing period of Shaughnessy's residency in 1926. He was considered for the head work at Northwestern in February 1927 after Clarence Spears turned it down. Shaughnessy later gotten comparative ideas from Louisiana State and Wisconsin. On April 8, 1927, he offered his acquiescence without a freely expressed reason and was thusly discharged from his agreement. Tulane supplanted him with previous right hand Bernie Bierman. "The Milwaukee Journal" acknowledged Shaughnessy for structure an imposing group at Tulane, and noticed that he expanded income and improved offices, while he utilized the accessible players and did not pay them "a nickel". Toward the finish of his residency, Shaughnessy held a record of 59Ã¢ÂÂ28Ã¢ÂÂ7, and starting at 2010, he keeps on holding the record for the most successes of any Tulane football mentor. He additionally trained the ball crew for three seasons somewhere in the range of 1915 and 1918 and amassed a 27Ã¢ÂÂ15 record. 

In June 1927, adjacent Loyola of the South procured Shaughnessy as its head football mentor. As indicated by "The Wow Boys: A Coach, a Team, and a Turning Point in College Football", a New Orleans mogul offered him $175,000 to mentor Loyola for a long time ($ balanced for swelling). This made him one of the most generously compensated football mentors in the country at the time. 

In 1928, Loyola made a trip to South Bend, Indiana to play Notre Dame in its season opener. The Wolves took a 6Ã¢ÂÂ0 halftime lead before they in the long run fell, 12Ã¢ÂÂ6. After the amusement, Notre Dame head mentor Knute Rockne apparently stated, "Never get me another 'warm-up diversion' against a group instructed by that person." The next year, Rockne was approached to name the best football mentor and reacted, "Unobtrusiveness forbidsÃÂ ...ÃÂ But on the off chance that I can name the two best football mentors in America, one of them will be Clark Shaughnessy." 

At Loyola, Shaughnessy held his accentuation on the forward pass. In 1930, the Wolves beat bigger however ill-equipped Iowa State and Detroit groups in sequential weeks with a similar passing play. Amid his residency, he was classified "the best one man training staff in football." He additionally conveyed to Loyola his changed form of the Minnesota move, which he asserted no rival had the capacity to totally check. In 1931, California considered Shaughnessy as a contender for its head instructing work. In spite of chances to mentor somewhere else, Shaughnessy stayed in New Orleans since he enjoyed the city and it was his significant other's main residence. He gathered a 38Ã¢ÂÂ16Ã¢ÂÂ6 record at Loyola from 1927 to 1932. 

After the 1932 season, University of Chicago president Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins constrained out 70-year-old head mentor Amos Alonzo Stagg, whom he thought about unreasonably old for the position. Stagg then proceeded onward to mentor at the College of the Pacific. Athletic executive T. Nelson Metcalf contracted Shaughnessy to supplant Stagg as head mentor in 1933. Shaughnessy acquired a troublesome circumstance at Chicago, and generally, needed great material. He did, be that as it may, acquire from Stagg somewhere around one critical enroll: debut Heisman Trophy champ and future Hall of Fame back Jay Berwanger, whom numerous Midwest intellectuals considered the best back of the 1930s. 

Under a scholastic program actualized in 1933 known as the New Plan or the Chicago Plan, yearly far reaching examinations supplanted end-of-term testing. This new timetable clashed with spring football training, which was abbreviated each ensuing season until it was in the end wiped out by and large. Without that additional training to gain proficiency with Shaughnessy's perplexing framework, time must be given to nuts and bolts in the fall. The New Plan additionally prevented the accessibility of appropriate football players: It urged more youthful understudies to enlist, disheartened the exchange of understudy competitors, and had stringent scholastic necessities to keep up athletic qualification. Athletic executive Metcalf stated, "Others do real enlisting, which we don't." Putting Chicago at further inconvenience to its Big Ten adversaries, college president Hutchins would not face the foundation of physical training major. 

At the main practice in 1933, Shaughnessy evaluated he would have a decent line, however an undersized backfield. He told the gathered applicants that they would utilize an open diversion and quick passing assault to balance their disservices. In his first season, Shaughnessy granted a case of sweets to the Maroon player who made the main handle of each amusement for the player to provide for his sweetheart. The "C" men graduated class association made comparable motivators for the most profitable player, best tackler, and best blocker. 

In January 1934, Shaughnessy employed Marchmont Schwartz as an associate mentor. Schwartz had played on Shaughnessy's Loyola green bean group before he exchanged to Notre Dame. In February, Shaughnessy declined enthusiasm from Ohio State to supplant previous head mentor Sam Willaman, and said that he had just amassed his training staff and wanted to leave Chicago. In 1935, offered Shaughnessy an occupation as its head mentor, which he genuinely considered. Chicago moved to hold him, potentially with a compensation increment, and the Harvard work at last went to previous mentor Dick Harlow. 

In the wake of earning back the original investment in every one of his initial three seasons, Shaughnessy's Chicago groups endured a losing record every year from 1936 to 1939. Chicago completed the 1939 season with a 2Ã¢ÂÂ6 record and were winless in the Big Ten Conference. The Maroons were outscored by their rivals, 308Ã¢ÂÂ37, and neglected to count in every misfortune. These included defeats by Michigan, 85Ã¢ÂÂ0; Ohio State, 61Ã¢ÂÂ0; Illinois, 46Ã¢ÂÂ0; , 61Ã¢ÂÂ0; and Virginia, 47Ã¢ÂÂ0. President Hutchins, who abhorred the game and said "there is no uncertainty that football has been a noteworthy impediment to training in the United States," effectively pushed to have the program disbanded. He stated, "I didn't de-accentuate football at the University of Chicago, I annulled it." Hutchins trusted the move would set a case for different colleges to pursue, however this did not happen. 

Shaughnessy could have stayed at Chicago, where he held a "lifetime sinecure" as a physical training teacher and earned an agreeable pay of $7,500 ($ balanced for expansion), however he was resolved to proceeding to mentor. He portrayed football as his energy and diversion. His last record at Chicago was 17Ã¢ÂÂ34Ã¢ÂÂ4. 

Amid his instructing residency at the University of Chicago, Shaughnessy become friends with George Halas, the proprietor and mentor of the Chicago Bears. In 1930, Halas had employed Ralph Jones, the athletic chief and football mentor at adjacent Lake Forest College, who had been his first year recruit mentor at the University of Illinois in 1914. Under head mentor Robert Zuppke, Illinois utilized the T development in "its most simple structure". With the Bears, Jones tried different things with the old T development, and he spread the linemen, pushed out one recipient, and utilized a back as a man in movement, the last more often than not being Red Grange. While these progressions were inventive, they were not amusement changing, and the T was utilized to supplement the single-wing offense as opposed to supplant it. In 1935, Shaughnessy depicted to Halas his vision of the T arrangement that utilized "shrouded ball stuff, yet with power". He had not utilized it at the University of Chicago since he did not have the players to execute it. In 1937, Shaughnessy started to work low maintenance as an advisor to the Bears for $2,000 every year ($ balanced for expansion). In that limit, he refined the T arrangement and investigated exploring reports. The Bears kept on exploring different avenues regarding the T, and after Shaughnessy left Chicago, the development turned into the club's standard hostile arrangement in 1940. The media has in some cases incorrectly credited Shaughnessy for the creation of the T development. The Associated Press composed that "he was, in any case, unquestionably the dad of the advanced T-assault." Shaughnessy himself considered it the most seasoned arrangement in football. 

In 1939, the Stanford Indians presented a 1Ã¢ÂÂ7Ã¢ÂÂ1 record on completion toward the end in the Pacific Coast Conference, which brought about the help of head mentor Tiny Thornhill. At the time, the 1939 Stanford Indians were viewed as the most exceedingly terrible group to have at any point spoken to the college. After the season, Stanford fruitlessly endeavored to employ Missouri mentor Don Faurot. Amid the pursuit of employment, Stanford authorities were astonished to figure out how very much respected Shaughnessy, a mentor of just infrequently fruitful squads, was among his friends. Many considered him as a "crazy lab rat" of football experimentation. In January 1940, Stanford University granted a five-year contract to Shaughnessy as its head football mentor, disregarding anticipated leader John Bain Sutherland. The move amazed even Shaughnessy, who stated, "I didn't anticipate it." 

Numerous Stanford graduated class were annoyed with the choice to contract Shaughnessy. The most well known possibility for the empty position were two Stanford graduated class themselves: San Jose State mentor Dudley DeGroot, and Santa Clara mentor Buck Shaw. Some trusted the Shaughnessy employing was a ploy to inevitably wipe out football at the school, as had occurred at both Loyola and Chicago the year earlier. The Bay Area media taunted the Shaughnessy enlisting as hilariously bumbling. They trusted that an esteemed scholarly school had absurdly procured a deep rooted washout as its head mentor. Prescott Sulivan of the "San Francisco Examiner" and Jack McDonald of the "San Francisco Call-Bulletin" instituted the moniker "Soup" for Shaughnessy, which they snidely clarified was a modest for "super". Sullivan stated, "We have heard it said that Shaughnessy has built up the skill of losing to the point where, with him, it is a definite science. In light of his record, we aren't at all astounded at this." The Stanford players were likewise incredulous of Shaughnessy's capacities. Focus Milt Vucinich stated, "We'd been finding out pretty much each one of those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were kidding among ourselves that wasn't it simply like Stanford to enlist someone like this to mentor us." 

Despite the fact that Stanford had fared inadequately amid the past seasons, Thornhill had deserted a group with a skilled list, which included 24Ã¢Â returning lettermen. Shaughnessy trusted the players were great, yet unsuited to the single-wing offense that his forerunner had utilized. Maybe in particular, Shaughnessy acquired back Frankie Albert, whom he considered a prototypical T arrangement quarterback. In 1943, Shaughnessy composed that he considered the 1940 Stanford backfieldÃ¢ÂÂquarterback Frankie Albert, fullback Norm Standlee, right halfback Hugh Gallarneau, and left halfback Pete KmetovicÃ¢ÂÂas the best ever. While he trusted the Indians backfield was superior to anything any such mix in the single-wing, twofold wing, short punt, or box arrangements, he included the proviso this remained constant just in the Stanford players' work in the T-development. 

Shaughnessy amassed a skillful training staff in line mentor Phil Bengston and backfield mentor Marchmont Schwartz. He likewise contracted previous Chicago Bears quarterback Bernie Masterson to guide Frankie Albert. Shaughnessy's adaptation of the T development depended on movement and trickery, and in this manner varied from its before nineteenth century manifestations, for example, that utilized by Amos Alonzo Stagg at the University of Chicago, which underscored control. As opposed to the single-wing, the new T did not utilize massed blocking arrangements for the ball-transporter. Rather, it used "brush blocking", where the linemen would just need to hinder a safeguard for a couple of seconds. This plan extraordinarily diminished the drawback of an undersized line. Likewise not quite the same as the single-wing, the immediate snap and position of the backs in the T arrangement protected the ball from the perspective on protectors. This considered unmistakably progressively powerful misleading. Shaughnessy apparently drew motivation for his procedure from the "Panzer" strategies of "Wehrmacht" general Heinz Guderian. 

Most sportswriters, new to the T arrangement, considered it the "Shaughnessy Formation" or "Shaughnessy's new razzle-astonish assaults." Bill Leiser of the "San Francisco Chronicle" alluded to it accurately when he wrote:"No one knows without a doubt what sort of football the Indians will play from this new T-FormationÃÂ ...ÃÂ They begin from the Notre Dame T and afterward quit looking like Notre Dame since they don't move at all and never do get into the well known box development. The man-in-movement may stop anyplace on the field. He changes the arrangement. [Quarterback Frankie] Albert parks himself directly behind the inside and takes the ball straightforwardly from his hands on about all plays. It's football not normal for any recently played on the Coast." 

The group directed exceptional arrangements amid the spring and fall rehearses before the 1940 season. On one event, Stanford athletic chief Al Masters furiously grumbled that the support office had left on the training field lights, just to be informed that the group was all the while rehearsing. In one scrimmage, the varsity offense oversaw just a solitary touchdown against the first year recruit group, which provoked Shaughnessy to subtly draft a solitary wing playbook if the T development fizzled. 

The 1940 season opened with Stanford confronting the University of San Francisco Dons at Kezar Stadium as a component of the main ever real school football doubleheader. It likewise included Santa Clara and Utah, however regardless of its unordinary nature, the occasion was dominated by a simultaneous diversion esteemed substantially more critical among California and Michigan in close-by Berkeley. After Santa Clara vanquished Utah, 34Ã¢ÂÂ14, the Stanford amusement started at 3:30Ã¢Â p.m. It began off carelessly, and the Indians neglected to propel the ball in their initial two belongings. In their third arrangement, be that as it may, Albert associated with a revealed beneficiary, Hugh Gallarneau, for a 17-yard pass. Fullback Norm Standlee then scrambled for 20Ã¢Â yards. Halfback Pete Kmetovic ran immaculate up the center for the diversion's first touchdown. Stanford proceeded to win, 27Ã¢ÂÂ0, and outgained San Francisco by an edge of 247Ã¢Â yards to eight. After the diversion, San Francisco head mentor George Malley stated, "We were confused, normally, by all that going around in the backfield." After the amusement, persuaded that the T arrangement worked, Shaughnessy disposed of the single-wing playbook he had drafted. 

The next week, Stanford vanquished , 13Ã¢ÂÂ0. The Indians at that point beat Santa Clara, 7Ã¢ÂÂ6, which was the Broncos' solitary loss of the period. Stanford energized to beat nineteenth positioned Washington State, 24Ã¢ÂÂ13. After seven days, the Indians crushed their fifth unbeaten rival, seventeenth positioned Southern California, 21Ã¢ÂÂ7. They proceeded to beat UCLA, 20Ã¢ÂÂ14; eleventh positioned Washington, 20Ã¢ÂÂ10; nineteenth positioned Oregon State, 28Ã¢ÂÂ14; and California, 13Ã¢ÂÂ7. Stanford, with an ideal 9Ã¢ÂÂ0 record, verified the Pacific Coast Conference title and a solicitation to the 1941 Rose Bowl, where they confronted seventh-positioned Nebraska. The Indians won, 21Ã¢ÂÂ13, with the last score going ahead a 39-yard punt return by Kmetovic. 

Prior to the Rose Bowl, Shaughnessy loaned help to his old partner George Halas of the Chicago Bears, which in Sid Luckman, had discovered a quarterback appropriate to the T arrangement. Before the NFL Championship Game against the Washington Redskins, Shaughnessy conceived a progression of counter plays to confound their adversary, which on diversion movie had appeared propensity to move linebackers toward the movement man. His arrangements helped Chicago defeat Washington, 73Ã¢ÂÂ0. 

Toward the finish of the period, the Poling System named Stanford the national heroes, and in later years, the Billingsley Report and Helms Athletic Foundation did similarly retroactively. Shaughnessy was casted a ballot the Scripps-Howard Coach of the Year by a wide edge, and Albert and Gallarneau were named to All-America first groups. The media nicknamed the 1940 squad the "Wow Boys", a play on their noteworthy accomplishments and the prior Stanford "Pledge Boys", which were named for Tiny Thornhill's guarantee to never lose to Southern California. 

Stanford's and the Chicago Bears' surprising accomplishment with the cutting edge T development incited mentors around the country to embrace it. Shaughnessy and Halas showed instructing facilities, and Bears quarterback Sid Luckman introduced the development at his place of graduation, . Luckman additionally helped actualize the T on national title groups at both Army and Notre Dame. By 1944, the greater part of the nation's football crews at the university and expert dimension were utilizing the T. In 1949, the Pittsburgh Steelers were the main NFL group as yet utilizing the single-wing. The T arrangement prompted various subordinates, a significant number of which stay being used today, including the power I, master set, veer, wishbone, split T, wing T, and West Coast offense. 

Shaughnessy made the "skeptical" expectation of somewhere around two misfortunes for his 1941 squad, which lost Gallarneau and Standlee to graduation. His gauge demonstrated precise, as wounds incurred significant damage, and the group lost to Oregon State, Washington State, and California to complete with a 6Ã¢ÂÂ3 record. After the Indians fell in their penultimate amusement, Stanford, Washington, and Oregon State were tied for the lead position in the Pacific Coast Conference with two misfortunes each. California's disturbed success over Stanford, 16Ã¢ÂÂ0, in the finale guaranteed that Oregon State got the Rose Bowl offer. 

In February 1942, Shaughnessy made a trip to Yale University, which was thinking about three contender for its empty head training position. After a month, he said he was not intrigued by Yale, however that he may move to an anonymous Eastern school with little football convention. Shaughnessy surrendered in March 1942 to move to Maryland. A 1977 "Sports Illustrated" article revealed that he chose to leave when he understood Stanford may cease its football program amid World War II. He communicated disillusionment about leaving, yet trusted the new activity would give a test. Maryland purportedly offered a similar compensation as Stanford, $9,000 ($ balanced for swelling), and a situation on its workforce. 

At Maryland, Shaughnessy filled in as the head football mentor, athletic chief, and executive of physical instruction, under a "lifetime contract". Shaughnessy presented a red and white shading plan for the Maryland regalia, which supplanted the longstanding blend of dark and gold. He introduced the T arrangement, and tutored quarterback Tommy Mont, whom he contrasted positively and Frankie Albert. He additionally applauded Terrapins fullback Jack Wright and compared him to Norm Standlee. In 1942, the Terrapins amassed a 7Ã¢ÂÂ2 record under Shaughnessy, and the Associated Press surveyed it was an "entirely reasonable ball club". Mont completed the season as one of the best three passers in the country. After the season, Shaughnessy left Maryland for Pittsburgh, a move he later called, "the most exceedingly awful thing I at any point did." 

In 1943, Shaughnessy supplanted Pittsburgh head mentor Charles W. Bowser, who had connected for a commission in the United States Navy. The University of Pittsburgh had de-accentuated football, a move with which Shaughnessy said he was in agreement. He likewise said he would not ensure any number of wins as mentor. Amid this time, Shaughnessy needed to fight with the loss of players to the wartime draft. At Pittsburgh, his groups arranged a 10Ã¢ÂÂ17 record from 1943 to 1945 without a triumphant season. In 1943, the National Safety Council respected him with an honor for "creating and applying training strategies that give most extreme assurance to the players." 

In March 1944, Washington Redskins proprietor George Preston Marshall employed Shaughnessy as a consultant, a position he held simultaneously with his obligations at Pittsburgh. He tutored new head mentor Dudley DeGroot in the T development, in which quarterback Sammy Baugh exceeded expectations. Pittsburgh, nonetheless, objected to his alliance with the expert establishment. 

In February 1946, Shaughnessy acknowledged an idea to come back to Maryland in the midst of mounting analysis at Pittsburgh, which incorporated the danger of acquiescence from colleague mentors Charles Hartwig, Bobby Hoel and Stan Olenn. College of Maryland president Dr. H. C. Byrd, himself a previous football mentor, called Shaughnessy one of the main three mentors in the country. Shaughnessy griped that he was not given a reasonable opportunity to prevail at Pittsburgh and that debate over his job with the Redskins was without premise. The Pittsburgh athletic board had prescribed Shaughnessy be held as mentor in the event that he left the Redskins, yet he won't. 

Shaughnessy stated, "Its amusing piece is that I gave Maryland the roughest arrangement I have ever given anybody in my life, and when Dr. [Byrd] offered me an opportunity to return, I acknowledged." Because of his rehashed activity changes, the Associated Press named Shaugnessy "football's man in movement". At Maryland, he supplanted Bear Bryant who had withdrawn for Kentucky. Shaughnessy reintroduced his favored red and white regalia, which again supplanted the dark and gold plan and remained the prevailing hues until 1987. 

His arrival to Maryland was far less effective than his first spell. The Terrapins amassed a 3Ã¢ÂÂ6 record in 1946. In November, he guaranteed a "Washington Post" story misquoted him as calling a portion of his ex-servicemen players "bums". A similar article revealed he would be terminated toward the finish of the period. "The Post" ran another statement that Shaughnessy conceded was precise: "There are some young men in this group who might have been terminated quite a while back by another mentor for their own direct." 

After the season, it was supposed that the Redskins were keen on elevating him to supplant head mentor Turk Edwards, yet the establishment denied it and Shaughnessy would not remark on his arrangements. In January 1947, he quit as Maryland mentor, expressing that he would not like to stay athletic chief or leave from the Washington Redskins, the two of which the school needed. Shaughnessy said he would work all day for the Redskins for the rest of the year on his agreement, and might come back to mentor just school football toward the finish of his term, conceivably with Maryland. President Byrd certified that Shaughnessy's poor 1946 record was not identified with his flight. He was supplanted by split T advocate Jim Tatum. 

In 1948, Shaughnessy joined the Los Angeles Rams as a "specialized counsel" to head mentor Bob Snyder. In the preseason, proprietor Dan Reeves was so awed with Shaughnessy that Reeves elevated him to head mentor and terminated Snyder. At Los Angeles, Shaughnessy built up the expert set that utilized a three wide recipient set. He rolled out this improvement to gain by running back Elroy "Insane Legs" Hirsch, who he thought would make a superior flanker. Los Angeles caught the Western Conference Championship in 1949. 

Reeves terminated Shaughnessy after two seasons, since he had made "inward grating". One source clarified that Shaughnessy's erraticisms and ceaselessly growing playbook had negatively affected the players. He was supplanted by colleague mentor Joe Stydahar. Shaughnessy stated, "Stydahar mentor the Rams? I could take a secondary school group and beat him." Stydahar, be that as it may, drove the Rams to the National Conference Championship that season, and the group set various NFL passing and scoring records. 

In 1951, Shaughnessy was reputed as a contender for the empty Washington Redskins head instructing work, however nothing happened to it. From 1951 to 1962, Shaughnessy served on the staff of the Chicago Bears as a specialized counselor, VP, and guarded pro. Halas held duty regarding the offense, including the Bears' T development. Unexpectedly, Shaughnessy was entrusted with building up a safeguard to counter the T arrangement. One of his answers was the 5Ã¢ÂÂ3Ã¢ÂÂ3 guard, which left outside linebackers accessible to shield against end runs and goes in the level. 

In 1954, Shaughnessy went to the BlueÃ¢ÂÂGray Game in Montgomery, Alabama, exploring explicitly for flankers. right hand Ray Wedgeworth revealed to him the best collector in the state was not playing in the amusement: Harlon Hill of Florence State Teachers' College. Shaughnessy mentioned diversion film from Hill's mentor, and in the long run, the Bears chosen him with their fifteenth pick in the 1954 NFL Draft. That season, he was named the NEA NFL MVP. 

In October 1961, the BearsÃ¢ÂÂutilizing Shaughnessy's unpredictable, moving protective alignmentsÃ¢ÂÂstifled San Francisco 49ers mentor Red Hickey's new shotgun development, 31Ã¢ÂÂ0. Chicago had learned exercises against the Baltimore Colts who had endeavored to utilize the shotgun the earlier week. Shaughnessy clarified his Chicago guarded plan in November 1961:"We can change in accordance with fit three things. We have barriers to fit the [offense] we face, the work force we face and the circumstance in the amusement. Bill George calls the essential generally resistance. At that point Fred Williams calls the resistance for the surge men. Richie Petitbon calls the barrier for the backs. These are genuine splendid young men, and they work superbly." 

Shaughnessy tutored center linebacker Bill George as the protective play-guest. Bears mentor Abe Gibron compared George to having Shaughnessy himself on the field. Shaughnessy attempted to counter the expanding utilization of the forward pass. He accentuated man-to-man inclusion, dropped linebackers or protective finishes into pass inclusion, and used rushes from numerous directionsÃ¢ÂÂwhich had recently comprised generally of only a center linebacker. 

Previous Chicago Bears head mentor Heartley "Hunk" Anderson gave an exceptionally basic record of his associations with Shaughnessy in "Notre Dame, Chicago Bears, and Hunk Anderson". He depicted one occurrence, amid an amusement against the Cleveland Browns, where Shaughnessy beseeched Anderson to call an "end run". Anderson, supposing he saw a weakness to misuse, asked which end run and which blocking assignments to utilize. Shaughnessy answered that any end run would do. Anderson approached in nauseate for Shaughnessy to take a seat and watch the remainder of the diversion. He clarified that the Bears had 28 distinctive end rushes to each side for every one of the four backs, every one of which had various blocking plans. He included, "You can't state 'any end run'ÃÂ ...ÃÂ You need to pick one." Anderson additionally asserted Shaughnessy copied plays from different mentors, renamed them, and guaranteed them as his own.
