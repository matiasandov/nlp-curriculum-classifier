"18 Miles Out" was coordinated by Ernest Dickerson and co-composed by Scott M. Gimple and showrunner Glen Mazzara. The storyline between Rick Grimes and Shane Walsh achieves a peak in "18 Miles Out", in which the two men get into a warmed contention, at last captivating in a physical showdown. Gimple considered and composed the scene into the scene's content. In the battle scene, the moves were arranged. Dickerson worked together with Lonnie Smith, Jr. who filled in as the trick facilitator. Smith cast two stand-ins to exhibit and showcase the scene for Lincoln and Bernthal so they could copy the movement. Jeremy Connors depicted Rick, while Trent Bry assumed the job of Shane. In the battle succession, Shane topples a cruiser onto Rick's legs, briefly immobilizing him. The bike gauged an expected 800 pounds; so as to diminish the heaviness of the vehicle, Dickerson and his group purged the gas tank. This was practiced at the arrangement's creation studios. Scalan Backus, "The Walking Dead"s enhancements expert, fixed the vehicle's footpeg to keep it from sliding and reaching the on-screen characters' legs. Backus additionally included a pole with a safe stable so it would give further leeway to the on-screen characters and increment the cruiser's range from the beginning. The cameramen taped the shots at an edge, making the deception that the vehicle hit the performing artists' legs. Author Robert Kirkman summated on the fallout of the encounter: 

Toward the finish of the current week's scene, Rick is of the mind that they're square; they have everything out in the open, they've each given their opinion and the two of them know where each other stands, they've had their huge victory and they're riding back in that vehicle and Rick believes he's taken care of it. He doesn't really believe he has his companion back, however he supposes the issues are settled. From the vibe of Shane in that vehicle, I don't have the foggiest idea about that he's fundamentally believing that. Generally, this contention might be set aside for later for the present. It certainly appears Shane still has an issue that remains to be worked out. 

While coming back to Hershel's homestead, Shane gazes at a walker in a relinquished field. Kirkman expressed the walker symbolizes the developing extent of the zombie infection. "We're actually simply endeavoring to demonstrate that that sort of thing is certain," he said. "You're simply driving down the road, you investigate and, 'Goodness, there you go, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a zombie.' We're attempting to demonstrate that this world is ending up increasingly more populated by zombies. Our reasoning is that huge populace focuses like Atlanta are truly where the core of this started and as [Rick and crew] moved out to HershelÃ¢ÂÂs ranch they didnÃ¢ÂÂt truly experience a lot of walkers since they are moving out of the downtown area at a quicker rate than the zombie populace. Furthermore, that zombie populace is beginning to make up for lost time with them. The zone is beginning to turned out to be increasingly more thick with walkers." 

Lori Grimes blames Andrea for taking an interest almost no in family undertakings. Kirkman asserted that since the inception of the zombie end of the world, huge numbers of the characters have returned to conventional sexual orientation jobs; "Lori is actually simply bothered over a great deal of things and she's lashing out. She was not kidding and she needs Andrea to pull her weight; certain individuals are screwed over thanks to specific assignments and to a limited degree individuals are withdrawing again into customary sex jobs as a result of how this survival-insane world appears to work. Lori has a ton of things going on so she's certainly going to carry on fairly unreasonably on occasion as she attempts to adapt to the pregnancy and the contention among Rick and Shane just as managing the way that Rick was out and about once more. She's experiencing a great deal of stuff."
