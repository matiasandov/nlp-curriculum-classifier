It is the second-busiest railroad station in Norway, behind Oslo Central Station (OsloÃÂ S), from which Nationaltheatret is away. Possessed and worked by Bane NOR, Nationaltheatret serves local administrations to the Vestfold Line and intercity benefits on the SÄÂ¸rland Line worked by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB), the Oslo Commuter Rail worked by NSB and NSB GjÄÂ¸vikbanen, and the Airport Express Train.

The more seasoned area got a full redesign in 2008. 

Nationaltheatret is one of two underground mainline railroad stations in Norway (the other being Holmestrand Station), situated inside the Oslo Tunnel on the Drammen Line. At ground level, there are three doorways to the station. On the west side of the station, the fundamental passage is from underneath 7. juni-plassen and Victoria Terrasse, confronting RuselÄÂ¸kkveien; and, there is a passage from Johanne Dybwads plass, which is the site of the National Theater. From the east, there is a passageway from Henrik Ibsens entryway. There is an extensive, open vestibule close to the surface at the passageway to RuselÄÂ¸kkveien. It has high-mounted windows confronting south, giving common lighting. The region highlights lifts and lifts to the stages, kept an eye on ticket deal, storage spaces, booths and cafÄÅ¡s. The station is additionally furnished with ticket machines and highlights stuff trolleys, washrooms and robotized teller machines with an arrangement of global monetary forms accessible. Leaving is accessible away at Vika, where vehicle rental is likewise given. Bike stopping and taxi stands are situated at road level. 

There are two stages and four tracks, with the more seasoned tracks 1 and 2 serving west-bound trains towards SkÄÂ¸yen and Drammen, while the more up to date tracks 3 and 4 serve east-bound trains to OsloÃÂ S. The stages are long, individually, and situated beneath the surface. The station has a limit with respect to 40,000 traveler for each day and is the second-busiest in Norway. 

The Norwegian State Railways' intercity benefits along the SÄÂ¸rland Line call at Nationaltheatret, up to four times each day for every bearing. The quickest support of Kristiansand takes 4 hours and 23 minutes and 7 hours and 59 minutes to Stavanger. NSB's territorial administration along the Vestfold Line likewise calls at Nationaltheatret, regularly with a one-hour progress.

Nonetheless, not all administrations of all line work west of OsloÃÂ S. The Airport Express Train works immediate, fast administrations to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen at regular intervals, with the voyage taking 28 minutes. 

Situated over the railroad station, yet in any case underground, is a metro station, which serves every one of the six lines of the Oslo Metro. The following west-bound station is Majorstuen (once in the past Valkyrie plass, yet that station exists no more), while the following east-bound station is Stortinget.

Arranging of the expansion of the rural light rail Holmenkollen Line to the downtown area began in 1901. Development started in 1912, yet ceased again in 1914 on the grounds that the region and the organization couldn't concede to the area of the terminal station. The district needed it at RuselÄÂ¸kkveien. The next year, the region propelled a challenge to make the best recommendation for the cable car systems. It took five years to choose a champ, and this enabled the district and friends to make a trade off by finding the end at Nationaltheatret. Be that as it may, not until 1926 was authorization conceded for the station. Development started and the station and passage opened in 1928. 

By the 1930s, Oslo had two primary railroad stations, Oslo East Station and Oslo West Station. Filling in as the terminal station of the Drammen Line, Oslo West Station (OsloÃÂ V) was situated in Vika, at the core of the focal business region of Oslo. The a lot bigger Oslo East Station (OsloÃ¢Â ÄÂ) served most worker, local and intercity trains. In 1938, the Station Committee of 1938 was set up to investigate a conceivable association of the Drammen Line to OsloÃ¢Â ÄÂ. Driven by Axel Grenholm, the council suggested fabricating a branch from the Drammen Line as a passage under the downtown area, permitting all trains would end at OsloÃ¢Â ÄÂ. It was suggested that the passage would keep running from Lassons entryway west of OsloÃÂ V to Fred. Olsens entryway, with a middle station near the area of OsloÃÂ V. 

In 1946, the Planning Office for Oslo Central Station, driven by Fin Hvoslef, was built up by the legislature. In 1950, they displayed another report, which prescribed that another course for the passage be considered, to ease development and increment security. This was to some extent dependent on a designing report from 1949, which had made the main nitty gritty designs for the line. Another board of trustees, driven by Oddvar Halvorsen, was built up in 1960 to take a gander at the issue once more. Likewise it prescribed a passage and a focal station. Notwithstanding, it felt that the passage ought to be longer and cross with the Drammen Line at a point among Skarpsno and SkÄÂ¸yen, and manufacture a second station at Frogner. The proposition was introduced to the Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, alongside a few different issues identified with rail transport ventures. Development of the Oslo Tunnel, Oslo Central Station and Nationaltheatret was passed consistently. 

Another arranging office was built up in 1962, at first driven by Erik Himle. The last designs for the course were passed by parliament in 1968, and development began in 1971. The underlying station was totally impacted in bedrock and comprised of a solitary stage, long and wide. Contiguous the bedrock is a layer of development concrete or more the stages, there are folded steel plates to get dribbles and to lessen commotion. The segment of line past Nationaltheatret was a piece of a segment of the Oslo Tunnel assigned Studenterlunden. Of this, was to keep running with the Common Tunnel of the Oslo Metro legitimately above it, bringing about a two-story burrow. In any case, only east of Nationaltheatret, the two lines separate, so the metro station isn't legitimately over the railroad station. 

The passage was formally opened on 30 May 1980 by Minister of Transport and Communications Ronald Bye and authoritatively taken into utilization on 1 June. The passage, including Nationaltheatret, cost NOK 625 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which Oslo Municipality had paid NOKÃÂ 170ÃÂ million. At first, the passage and Nationaltheatret was utilized by passenger trains from LillestrÄÂ¸m to Drammen and Spikkestad, and trains from Eidsvoll and ÄÂrnes utilized the passage and turned at SkÄÂ¸yen. On 27 May 1989, OsloÃÂ V was shut and all traffic began running by means of Nationaltheatret. 

From 1998, the Airport Express Train would begin working, and greater limit would be required, both at Nationaltheatret and through the Oslo Tunnel. In 1995, NSB held an engineering rivalry to grow the station, which was won by LPO Arkitektur og Design and their plan "By Nothing". Development initiated in October 1997 and comprised of structure of new passage, another twofold stage, a bigger vestibule, lifts and craftsmanship. Amid the work, of shake were impacted and of cement were poured. The station was embellished with works by Anne Karine Furunes, Terje Roalkvam and Katrine GiÄÅver. The redesigns cost NOKÃÂ 920ÃÂ million and was authoritatively opened by King Harald V on 16 December 1999. 

The new passageway was structured by Arne Eggen and designed by Terje Roalkvam. Other workmanship was structured by BÄÄ¾rd Breivik and Ole Enstad, including reuse of a portion of the first vestibule craftsmanship from 1980, including a green marble divider planned by Katrine GiÄÅver that keeps running along the passage prompting the metro station. The new stage was assembled utilizing run of the mill 1990s materials, for example, glass, metal and concrete, differentiating the old stage which was a lot darker and highlighted dim earthenware tiles which were prevalent amid the 1970s. 

In 2008, the old segment of Nationaltheatret Station was remodeled, including tracks 1 and 2 and the two unique doors. Overhauls included new lighting, another open location framework, new lifts which have lighting that changes shading, an all the more dominant fire security framework, improved crisis ways out and substitution of links and baldachin. The update made the old segment lighter, and outwardly like the new area, as it was recently painted in dull red. Somewhere in the range of 2008 and 2012, the Norwegian National Rail Administration played out a noteworthy move up to the segment among Lysaker and Etterstad, including the changeless route past Nationaltheatret. Among the updates are hub counters, mounting of an overhead conductor rail, new switches and new tracks.
