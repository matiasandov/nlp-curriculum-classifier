New York State Route 21 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 21 (NYÃÂ 21) is a state roadway reaching out for through the western piece of New York in the United States. The southern end of the course is at a crossing point with NYÃÂ 417 in the town of Andover, and its northern end is at an intersection with NYÃÂ 104 in the town of Williamson. In the middle of, NYÃÂ 21 serves the urban communities of Hornell and Canandaigua and converges a few noteworthy eastÃ¢ÂÂwest courses, including the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86/NY 17) close Hornell, the conjoined courses of U.S. RouteÃ¢Â 20 (USÃÂ 20) and NYÃÂ 5 in Canandaigua, the New York State Thruway (I-90) in Manchester, and NYÃÂ 31 in Palmyra. 

NYÃÂ 21 initially stretched out from the Pennsylvania state line in the south to Lake Ontario in the north when it was allocated as a component of the 1930 renumbering of state parkways in New York. South of Hornell, the course pursued present day NYÃÂ 36. NYÃÂ 21 was rerouted to pursue its present arrangement south of Hornell during the 1950s and truncated on its northern end to Williamson in 1980. Different changes of neighborhood significance, generally realignments to sidestep networks along the course, have additionally happened at different focuses in the course's history. NYÃÂ 21 initially had a backup course of action around Canandaigua Lake; be that as it may, that highwayÃ¢ÂÂdesignated NYÃÂ 21AÃ¢ÂÂwas dispensed with during the 1940s. 

NYÃÂ 21 starts at a convergence with NYÃÂ 417 in the town of Andover. The course travels northward, paralleling the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad (WNYP) through a provincial stretch of eastern Allegany County. At Alfred Station, found only east of the town of Alfred, the expressway meets the eastern end of NYÃÂ 244. NYÃÂ 21 and the WNYP head upper east through the town of Almond to the Steuben County line, where the street and rail line start to swing toward the southeast toward Hornell. The part of NYÃÂ 21 close Almond quickly parallels the Southern Tier Expressway, assigned InterstateÃ¢Â 86 (I-86) and NYÃÂ 17. East of the district line, NYÃÂ 21 leaves the region of the road and goes through another undeveloped stretch to achieve the city of Hornell, where it turns out to be West Main Street. 

The parkway pursues West Main Street for a few squares into the city's downtown area, where it crosses the Norfolk Southern Railway's Southern Tier Line and meets NYÃÂ 36. NYÃÂ 21 turns north onto NYÃÂ 36, isolating from the WNYP and shaping a simultaneousness with NYÃÂ 36 north along a four-path partitioned roadway known as the Maple City Bypass. The cover closes north of as far as possible in the town of Hornellsville, where NYÃÂ 21 parts from NYÃÂ 36 and resumes its northeasterly track. Not far toward the north of this point is exitÃ¢Â 34 of the Southern Tier Expressway, gotten to by method for NYÃÂ 36. From Hornell, NYÃÂ 21 travels upper east through continuously less created zones as it winds its way over the uneven territory of the Southern Tier. For the following , NYÃÂ 21 serves just little, roadside villas, for example, Fremont, Haskinville, and Loon Lake. 

North of Haskinville, NYÃÂ 21 takes on an all the more northerly course through the area that in the long run conveys it to the town of Wayland, where it crosses I-390 at exitÃ¢Â 3 south of the town. The exchange additionally fills in as the southern end of NYÃÂ 15 and is neighboring the north end of NYÃÂ 415, which ends north of the exit at NYÃÂ 21. NYÃÂ 15 joins NYÃÂ 21 north into the focal point of Wayland, where the two courses separate after crossing NYÃÂ 63. While NYÃÂ 15 proceeds with north from the town into Livingston County, NYÃÂ 21 leaves Wayland on an eastÃ¢ÂÂwest arrangement, generally paralleling the northern area line and a B&H Rail Corporation line as it goes through a valley encompassing the Cohocton River. After , the street enters the villa of North Cohocton, revolved around NYÃÂ 21's intersection with the northern end of NYÃÂ 371. 

While the waterway, its valley, and the rail line continue south from North Cohocton, NYÃÂ 21 swings toward the upper east, rising out of the valley lastly crossing the area line, now circumscribing Ontario County. The course wanders over another zone of uneven, undeveloped territory to the town of Naples, home toward the north end of NYÃÂ 53 and the south end of NYÃÂ 245. NYÃÂ 21 meets the two courses at inverse finishes of the network, with NYÃÂ 53 ending south of the town focus and NYÃÂ 245 starting to its north. Naples likewise fills in as NYÃÂ 21's passageway to the Finger Lakes district; the town itself is situated in the southernmost piece of the Canandaigua Lake valley. 

NYÃÂ 21 proceeds with north from Naples, running close by the western edge of the lake valley, and in the long run the lake itself. Close Woodville, a villa north of Naples, the course quickly enters Yates County for a little more than a half-mile (0.8Ã¢Â km) before returning Ontario County. It serves lakeside homes and bungalows in the town of South Bristol for another , after which the street starts to climb the side of the valley and wind toward the village of Bristol Springs. Here, the street forks, with NYÃÂ 64 starting to one side (west) and NYÃÂ 21 proceeding to one side (north). While NYÃÂ 64 travels northwest to Rochester, NYÃÂ 21 advances toward the upper east, sitting above Canandaigua Lake on its way through for the most part confined territories of the town of Canandaigua. The course in the long run achieves the edges of the city of Canandaigua, where it meets USÃÂ 20 and NYÃÂ 5. 

Now, NYÃÂ 21 turns east, joining USÃÂ 20 and NYÃÂ 5 as every one of the three courses head around the southwestern segment of the city. The essential part of the detour finishes about later at a convergence with South Main Street; the intersection likewise denotes the east end of the cover between the three courses and the south end of NYÃÂ 332. NYÃÂ 21 turns north onto South Main Street, finishing NYÃÂ 332 the city's noteworthy downtown area. The two courses go by 426 South Main Street, Benham House, and the city's previous United States Post Office, all properties recorded on the National Register of Historic Places, before part at the intersection of Gibson and North Main boulevards. NYÃÂ 332 proceeds with north starting here on North Main Street toward Victor while NYÃÂ 21 finishes Gibson Street northeastward a private segment of the city. It passes Sonnenberg Gardens and Mansion State Historic Park and the city's VA Hospital before leaving the Canandaigua city limits. 

Outside the Canandaigua city restrains, the region encompassing NYÃÂ 21 ends up rustic indeed; notwithstanding, the encompassing territory is more dimension than it was south of the city. The course travels upper east through farmland to Chapin, a little village in the town of Hopewell, where it meets the south end of NYÃÂ 488 and swings to take on an all the more northerly course. Not far toward the north are the adjoining towns of Shortsville and Manchester, generally isolated by the Ontario Central Railroad. Here, NYÃÂ 21 goes under the railroad and converges both NYÃÂ 96 and the New York State Thruway (I-90) at exitÃ¢Â 43 only north of the Manchester town focus. Past the Thruway, NYÃÂ 21 ends up country in nature again as it keeps running crosswise over moving landscape to the Wayne County line. 

Inside Wayne County, the region around NYÃÂ 21 turns out to be increasingly created as it enters the town of Palmyra, where the street is town kept up from the southern town line to its intersection with NYÃÂ 31 in the town's notable focus. The course quickly covers NYÃÂ 31 along East Main Street before intersection both the Erie Canal and the CSX Transportation-claimed Rochester Subdivision on out of the town. From Palmyra to Williamson, the land encompassing NYÃÂ 21 is transcendently provincial in nature. Be that as it may, halfway between the two areas, NYÃÂ 21 approaches the village of Marion, which it sidesteps toward the west. In Williamson, NYÃÂ 21 goes through the town focus at an intersection with Ridge Road before completion at a crossing point with NYÃÂ 104 in a progressively business area of the town. 

Before the American Revolution, the way of current NYÃÂ 21 north of Canandaigua was a piece of an old Native American trail associating Seneca Lake to Lake Ontario by method for Canandaigua Lake. The trail started in the region of Geneva and went west to Canandaigua on a way presently involved by USÃÂ 20 and NYÃÂ 5. It proceeded with north from Canandaigua, going through the town of Palmyra and the villa of Marion before achieving the Lake Ontario shoreline at Pultneyville. Development to change over the CanandaiguaÃ¢ÂÂMarion segment of the trail into a street was finished in 1794. The rest of the trail north to Pultneyville was changed over into a street around three years after the fact. 

The CanandaiguaÃ¢ÂÂPultneyville expressway filled in as a post street in the years that pursued. Eventually, the segment of the interstate among Palmyra and Marion, at first a corduroy street, was remade as a board street and tolled. The parkway fell into decay throughout the years, driving explorers to imagine approaches to abstain from paying toll. The toll stalls were in the long run expelled, and the street was later secured with soil and changed over into a phase street. By the 1920s, the province of New York had expected responsibility for CanandaiguaÃ¢ÂÂPultneyville interstate. In the mid-1920s, it turned out to be a piece of NYÃÂ 72, a northÃ¢ÂÂsouth expressway reaching out from NYÃÂ 52 in Naples to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Pultneyville by method for the western side of Canandaigua Lake. 

In the 1930 renumbering of state thruways in New York, NYÃÂ 72 turned out to be a piece of NYÃÂ 21, another course reaching out from the Pennsylvania state line at Troupsburg to Pultneyville. It pursued what is presently NYÃÂ 36 from the state line to Hornell and current County RouteÃ¢Â 121 (CRÃÂ 121), NYÃÂ 415, and NYÃÂ 371 between Loon Lake and North Cohocton (by means of Cohocton). The rest of NYÃÂ 21 generally pursued its present arrangement. In the meantime, what is currently NYÃÂ 21 from Andover to Hornell was assigned as the western portion of NYÃÂ 17F while the area between Loon Lake and present day NYÃÂ 415 was alloted NYÃÂ 371. The rest of the piece around Wayland was a piece of NYÃÂ 2 south of Wayland and part of the new NYÃÂ 39 from Wayland to Cohocton. NYÃÂ 39 covered NYÃÂ 21 from Cohocton to Naples, where it forked from NYÃÂ 21 and proceeded with east on present day NYÃÂ 245. 

A few parts of current NYÃÂ 21 south of Naples had conveyed assignments before 1930. In 1924, the AndoverÃ¢ÂÂHornell fragment was assigned as a feature of NYÃÂ 17; in the meantime, the short piece between present day NYÃÂ 415 and the focal point of Wayland turned out to be a piece of NYÃÂ 4. By 1926, the segment interfacing Wayland to Naples was incorporated into the new NYÃÂ 52. NYÃÂ 4 was renumbered to NYÃÂ 2 in 1927 to dispose of numerical duplication with the new USÃÂ 4. 

The arrangements of NYÃÂ 21 and NYÃÂ 371 between Loon Lake and Cohocton were flipped , directing NYÃÂ 21 through the town of Wayland. The realignment broadened NYÃÂ 21's cover with NYÃÂ 39 west to Wayland and made a cover with NYÃÂ 2 south of the town. NYÃÂ 2 was assimilated into an all-encompassing USÃÂ 15 (presently NYÃÂ 15) by the next year. In the mid 1940s, the NYÃÂ 17F assignment was dispensed with and supplanted with an all-encompassing NYÃÂ 36 from Andover to Hornell. The arrangements of NYÃÂ 36 and NYÃÂ 21 south of Hornell were flipped in the mid 1950s, setting the two courses on their present arrangements south of the city. 

On AprilÃ¢Â 1, 1980, NYÃÂ 21 was truncated to its present northern end at NYÃÂ 104 in Williamson as a major aspect of an interstate upkeep swap between New York State and Wayne County. In the swap, possession and support of NYÃÂ 21 north of Williamson was exchanged from the province of New York to the area in return for upkeep of NYÃÂ 441 between the MonroeÃ¢ÂÂWayne region line and NYÃÂ 350. The previous directing of NYÃÂ 21 north to Lake Road (CRÃÂ 101) in Pultneyville is currently assigned as CRÃÂ 120. 

Until the 1980s, NYÃÂ 21 entered Canandaigua on Bristol Street and tailed it to South Main Street (at that point USÃÂ 20 and NYÃÂ 5), where it joined its present arrangement. At the point when the Western Bypass around the southwestern edge of the city was developed in the late 1970s and mid 1980s, USÃÂ 20 and NYÃÂ 5 were realigned to pursue the expressway around the city. NYÃÂ 21 was likewise realigned right now to pursue its cutting edge directing on the detour and South Main Street. The portion of Bristol Street abandoned by NYÃÂ 21 between the Western Bypass and the Canandaigua city line was kept up by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as unsigned NYÃÂ 943A until SeptemberÃ¢Â 1, 1996, when support of the street was swung over to the town of Canandaigua. Be that as it may, the assignment stayed in NYSDOT archives until 2007. 

NYÃÂ 21A was a backup course of action of NYÃÂ 21 along the eastern side of Canandaigua Lake. When it was allocated as a major aspect of the 1930 renumbering of state parkways in New York, it started at NYÃÂ 21 north of the town of Naples and kept running along the east shore of the lake to eastern Canandaigua, where it finished at USÃÂ 20 and NYÃÂ 5. In the middle of, NYÃÂ 21A went through the lakeside village of Vine Valley. The course was truncated to start in Vine Valley, isolating it from its parent course. It was dispensed with completely in the mid 1940s when a large portion of NYÃÂ 21A was consumed by NYÃÂ 364.
