It was the principal scene composed by Jon Vitti. It was likewise the first since forever scene to utilize the mark title arrangement, just as the primary ordinary scene. In the scene Bart undermines an insight test and is pronounced a virtuoso, so he is sent to a school for talented kids. Despite the fact that he at first appreciates being treated as a virtuoso, he sees the drawback of his new life. 

It denotes the principal utilization of Bart's catchphrase "Eat my shorts". As the second scene delivered, legitimately after the sad activity of "Some Enchanted Evening", the eventual fate of the arrangement relied upon how the liveliness turned out on this scene. The liveliness ended up being progressively satisfactory and generation proceeded. 

The Simpson family go through a night of playing Scrabble and Lisa reminds Bart that he should animate his cerebrum with different vocabulary on the off chance that he would like to breeze through his knowledge test. He swindles his approach to triumph by thinking of his own statement, "kwyjibo", putting together its definition with respect to an offending depiction of Homer. This irritates his dad and he pursues Bart, a lot to the shame of his family. 

At Springfield Elementary School, Bart is busted for vandalism by Principal Skinner, who has been educated by class virtuoso Martin Prince. Looked with the possibility of falling flat a knowledge test, Bart secretly switches tests with Martin (as an approach to pay him back for getting him in a bad position). At the point when the school clinician, Dr. Pryor, thinks about the outcomes, he recognizes Bart as a virtuoso, to the pleasure of Homer and Marge, who select him in another school. In any case, Lisa isn't tricked by his alleged virtuoso and still trusts Bart to be a dolt; Skinner shares her conviction, however exploits Bart's takeoff from the school. 

At the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children, Bart feels strange among different understudies with cutting edge scholastic abilities. In the interim, Marge endeavors to invigorate Bart with a little culture by taking the family to the musical drama. In any case, this demonstrates heartbreaking as Bart and Homer are very problematic, a lot to Lisa's delight. Alienated by his splendid cohorts, Bart visits his previous school, where his old companions dismiss him in view of his apparent insight. On the splendid side, he appreciates newly discovered consideration from Homer and he covers for them when Marge makes another endeavor to animate Bart's cerebrum by taking them to a film celebration. After Bart's science explore detonates, filling the school lab with green goo, he admits to Dr. Pryor that he exchanged tests with Martin.

The idea for the scene created from author Jon Vitti concocting a not insignificant rundown of awful things Bart would accomplish for consideration envisioning the potential results. The main thought that formed into an intriguing scene idea was Bart undermining an IQ test. This thought depended on an occurrence from Vitti's youth when some of his cohorts did not pay attention to an insight test and endured poor scholastic treatment as a result of it. Since Bart was at that point clearly unintelligent, Vitti turned around the issue for his scene. Vitti utilized every one of his recollections of primary school conduct to create a draft content of 71 pages, considerably over the required length of around 45 pages. 

It was Vitti's first content for a 30-minute TV program. Bart's utilization of the expression "Eat my shorts" was planned to mirror his selection of catchphrases he had heard on TV; the inventive group had revealed to Vitti that he ought not think of unique slogans for the character. The scene where the family plays Scrabble was motivated by the 1985 animation "The Big Snit". 

Chief David Silverman experienced issues concocting a decipherable Scrabble board for the opening scene that would pass on the possibility that the Simpsons were just ready to devise basic words. The plan of Bart's representation of the math issue was halfway enlivened by the craft of Saul Steinberg.

There were a couple of issues with the completed movement for the scene. The banana in the opening scene was hued mistakenly, as the Korean artists were new to the organic product, and the last bath scene was especially tricky, incorporating issues with lip synchronize. The form in the communicate scene was the best of a few endeavors. 

The scene was the first to include the arrangement's full title grouping. Maker Matt Groening built up the protracted grouping so as to eliminate the liveliness vital for every scene, except concocted the two muffles as pay for the rehashed material every week.

This message, which changes from scene to scene, has turned out to be known as the "writing slate choke". The other stifler is known as a "lounge chair choke", in which a spot of occasions happen when the family meets to sit on their sofa and sit in front of the TV. Groening, who had not given much consideration to TV since his own youth, was uninformed that title successions of such length were exceptional at that point. As the completed scenes turned out to be longer, the creation group were hesitant to slice the tales so as to take into consideration the long title succession, so shorter variants of it were created. The scene likewise presented the characters Martin Prince and his folks, Richard, Bart's educator Edna Krabappel and Dr. J Loren Pryor. 

In the opening scene, Maggie spells EMCSQU with her obstructs, a reference to Albert Einstein's mass-vitality equality condition. An image of Einstein likewise shows up on the mass of Dr. Pryor's office. At a certain point Homer mistakenly alludes to Einstein as the innovator of the light. Dr. Pryor analyzes Bart's proposed work among conventional kids to Jane Goodall's investigation of chimpanzees. Goodall was satisfied to be referenced in the scene, sending the program a letter, and Vitti a signed duplicate of her book. The conductor of the musical drama the family goes to is named Boris Csupowski, a reference to illustrator Gabor Csupo. The musical drama gone to by the family is "Carmen", by French author Georges Bizet; the melody that Bart ridicules is a well known aria called the Toreador Song. Understudies at the skilled school have lunchboxes that highlight pictures of the 1945 novel "Brideshead Revisited" and chess grandmaster Anatoly Karpov.

In September 2001, in a DVD survey of the principal season, David B. Grelck gave the scene a rating of 2Ã¢Ë/5 and remarked that the scene was "wacky and fun, very Bart focused, it's anything but difficult to see with this scene why Bart turned into the nonentity for a couple of long stretches of class comedians". Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in an audit that the scene "offered another not too bad however unspectacular scene" and further remarked that "its initial vintage appears to be clear both through the cumbersome activity and the absence of suitable character advancement."
