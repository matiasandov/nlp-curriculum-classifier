American musician and maker Christopher "Precarious" Stewart assembled with Terius "The-Dream" Nash and Kuk Harrell in January 2007 at the Atlanta-based Triangle Studios to make new material. In the studio, Stewart was "messing around with a clobbering hey cap sound", which he found in the free music programming GarageBand, which is incorporated into all Mac PCs. With his consideration gotten by the sound, Nash asked Stewart what he was doing: "Goodness, my Gosh, what is that beat?". At the point when Stewart joined harmonies onto the greetings cap, "quickly the word flew into [Nash's] head"; he went to the vocal stall and began singing. Nash composed the initial two sections and the ensemble over Stewart's skeleton track. They rapidly composed the verses, finishing the main refrain in 60 seconds. They proceeded into composing, including the snare while "[Stewart] would put the following harmony". In merely hours, they had recorded a demo of the track. The tune was composed in view of American pop artist Britney Spears, whom Stewart had recently worked with on her 2003 single "Me Against the Music".

However, the tune continued showing signs of improvement. I tuned in to it again and again. I stated, 'I need this record. I need to record it tomorrow." 

Be that as it may, since it was the Grammy period of 2007, Stewart and Nash peered toward American R&B artist Mary J. Blige for the demo. After calling them to set the record aside for Rihanna, Stewart had played it to a partner of Blige, in this manner promising the melody to her. Having heard the move of the authors, Kwak started calling Stewart and his director, Mark Stewart, ceaselessly.
