Bristol Britannia 

The Bristol Type 175 Britannia was a British medium-to-long-extend aircraft worked by the Bristol Airplane Company in 1952 to fly over the British Empire. Amid advancement two models were lost and the turboprop motors demonstrated powerless to channel icing, which deferred section into administration while arrangements were looked for. 

When advancement was finished, "unadulterated" stream aircrafts from France, United Kingdom, and the United States were going to enter administration, and thus, just 85 Britannias were worked before creation finished in 1960. By the by, the Britannia is viewed as one of the tourist spots in turboprop-controlled aircraft plan and was well known with travelers. It ended up known as "The Whispering Giant" for its calm outside commotion and smooth flying, in spite of the fact that the traveler inside stayed less peaceful. 

Canadair bought a permit to fabricate the Britannia in Canada, including another 72 variations. These were the extended Canadair CL-44/Canadair CC-106 Yukon, and the incredibly altered Canadair CP-107 Argus sea watch flying machine. 

In 1942, amid the Second World War, Allied flying machine development saw the UK of need focusing on overwhelming planes, departing the creation of transport airplane to the USA. This would have left the UK with little involvement in transport development toward the finish of the war, so in 1943, a board of trustees under Lord Brabazon of Tara examined the eventual fate of the British non military personnel carrier showcase. The Brabazon Committee required a few diverse air ship to be created to details made by the board of trustees for jobs felt to satisfy Britain's non military personnel flying needs. 

Bristol won the Type I and Type III contracts, conveying their Type I plan, the Bristol Brabazon in 1949. The necessity for the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements matched with the Type III, Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The determinations required a carrier fit for conveying 48 travelers and fueled with Bristol Centaurus outspread motors or Napier Nomad turbo-compound Diesel motor. Turboprop alternatives were additionally considered, however they were new to the point that Bristol couldn't ensure the execution details. 

Despite the fact that in-organization Proposals "X" for changes of Lockheed Constellations to Centaurus 662 powerplants or "Y" for permit generation of the Constellation were considered in late 1946, BOAC chose that an altogether new structure was favored. In the wake of wrangling between the Ministry of Supply and BOAC over expenses, the approval for the venture alloted the organization assignment Model 175 was given in July 1948. Three models were requested as Mk 1 (Centaurus 662), with the second and third models assigned the Mk 2 (to be convertible to Bristol Proteus turboprops, at that point a work in progress). 

In October 1947, with work effectively in progress, Bristol had settled on a Centaurus-fueled structure, with an all-up weight of and a payload of . The foreseen Karachi-Cairo run required a 48-situate limit with a prerequisite for adequate fuel for the extensive stage. On 5 July 1949, the Ministry of Supply requested five models to this detail with the understanding that BOAC would contract for an extra 25 creation precedents. BOAC obtained choices for 25 flying machine on 28 July, to be fueled at first with the Bristol Centaurus motor, yet to be re-fitted with the Bristol Proteus when accessible. In November 1948, the Type 175 structure was reexamined again to oblige 74 travelers and a more drawn out range wing in a mulled over long-extend adaptation went for whole deal Empire and transoceanic courses as opposed to the medium-pull Empire courses initially arranged. On reflection, BOAC chose that just a Proteus-engined air ship merited dealing with, requiring a further update with Bristol killing the Centaurus choice. Senior figures inside BOAC, for example, the Deputy Chairman Whitney Straight, be that as it may, believed the Proteus motor to be "an out of date contraption". In spite of BOAC's longing to have a turboprop motor, the Type 175 undertaking was dependent upon the Proteus breezing through a 150-hour Type Test. 

The name, "Britannia" was picked in April 1950 with Britannia 101 the assignment for initial two models controlled by the early arrangement Proteus 625, the follow-up from the 600 arrangement motor that had effectively finished its sort preliminaries. The primary model, enrolled "G-ALBO", with Bristol Chief Test Pilot A.J. "Bill" Pegg at the controls, flew out of the blue on 16 August 1952 at Filton Aerodrome. The lady flight was significant, as the over-delicate flying controls prompted a wild pitching before Pegg reestablished control. Amid the arrival approach, smoke filled the cockpit and the principle undercarriage bogie was stuck in its cycle, just completely sending seconds before landing. The "obstacles" turned out to be minor and by September, the model was cleared to perform at the 1952 SBAC Display at Farnborough where observers remarked on the "quietness" of the monster carrier. In November 1952, Popular Science detailed that by 1954 BOAC would have 25 of these airplane on courses, for example, London-to-Tokyo over the Arctic and North Pole. In any case, in 1953 and 1954, three de Havilland Comets smashed without clarification, and the Air Ministry requested the Britannia experience long tests. Further deferrals were credited to early stage struggles with the motor bringing about the misfortune in February 1954 of the second model, "G-ALRX", brought about by a fizzled decrease gear that prompted a motor flame and the air ship arriving on the mudflats of the Severn Estuary. Settling effectively avoidable gulf icing issuesÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ by choosing a marginally extraordinary cruising tallness than that specifiedÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ that were found at last as the principal flying machine were being conveyed to BOAC, and which at that point were overstated by BOAC in open crushing the Britannia's business prospects and postponing the Britannia's presentation by two years, additionally required some serious energy. The principal model "G-ALBO" was in this manner adjusted to all the more firmly surmised a generation standard, yet was held by the organization to experience motor testing and improvement. 

Bristol overhauled the structure into a bigger transoceanic aircraft for BOAC, bringing about the Series 200 and 300, with the Britannia 300LR (Long-Range) seen as "famously appropriate" for BOAC's administrations among London and Sydney. Qantas had been thinking about acquiring an armada of Britannia air ship, however the all-encompassing advancement time had eroded the preferred standpoint the flying machine would hold until more current air ship, for example, the Douglas DC-8 and de Havilland Comet 4 went onto the market. Course demonstrating preliminaries proceeded through 1955, in spite of the fact that orders were on the books from "El Al" and Canadian Pacific Air Lines, just as BOAC's standing request. 

The price tag paid by BOAC for each Britannia 100-arrangement flying machine concurred on in 1955 was ÃÅ768,000. 

Amid the initial eight months of operational preliminaries, an aggregate of 16 in-flight motor disappointments and 49 unscheduled motor changes punctuated the continuous motor quandary and deferred the in-administration date until February 1957, around two years late. The Britannia got a considerable lot of consideration in both the well known press and the British House of Commons, particularly when it was uncovered that BOAC had thought about fitting Rolls-Royce Tynes to their armada of Douglas DC-7s as a between time measure until the Britannia was cleared for administration. 

Aeronautics history specialist Peter Pigott abridged the effect of the deferrals: 

In 1954, a permit was issued to Canadair to fabricate the subordinate Canadair CL-28/CP-107 Argus, and the Canadair CL-44/Canadair CC-106 Yukon. In view of the Britannia, the plan of the Argus sea watch and against submarine fighting air ship was upgraded for continuance on long-run watch, not speed, and utilized four Wright R-3350-32W Turbo-Compound motors that utilized less fuel at low height. In contrast to its Britannia progenitor, the Argus was a half breed, utilizing the Britannia wings, tail surfaces and landing gear coordinated to a "reason fabricated", unpressurised fuselage. Another huge takeoff was being "Naturalized", substituting North American materials and standard parts for the British ones. The inside was all around outfitted with the instruments to direct enemy of submarine warfareÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ route, correspondence and strategic electronic gear alongside weapon stacks that included bombs, torpedoes, mines and profundity charges. An aggregate of 33 Argus air ship were worked in two arrangement (Mk 1 and Mk 2), serving the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and Canadian Forces from 1957 to 1982. 

Canadair constructed 39 Canadair CL-44]/Canadair CC-106 Yukon turboprop Rolls-Royce Tyne-fueled airplane, including 12 CC-106 Yukon for the RCAF and 27 CL-44D4 traveler/payload variations for the common market, the vast majority of which were utilized as tankers. Four CL-44D4s were changed over as CL-44Js with protracted fuselages for administration with the Icelandic "spending plan" carrier "LoftleiÄÂ°ir". The CL-44D4s were altogether worked with swing-tails to permit straight-in payload stacking and presented with an assortment of bearers, most remarkably Flying Tiger Line. The comparative CC-106 Yukon was utilized by the RCAF in an exclusively traveler setup. A last novel "one-off" improvement was the Conroy Skymonster, nicknamed "Guppy", in light of a Canadair CL-44D4 N447T. The most conspicuous change was a developed fuselage, similar to the Mini Guppy, which was created by Jack Conroy's past organization, Aero Spacelines. After a long operational profession as a tanker, the "Guppy" was put away at Bournemouth Airport in 2003 and has as of late been sold. 

Following a significant lot of uneventful improvement flying preliminaries and the fitting of an altered Proteus 765 arrangement motor that enormously decreased breakdowns, a full Certificate of Airworthiness was granted toward the finish of 1955. The initial two Model 102s were conveyed to BOAC on 30 December 1955 for group preparing. The Model 102 started booked administration on 1 February 1957 with a BOAC departure from London to Johannesburg, flights to Sydney following in March and to Tokyo in July. By August 1957, the initial 15 Model 102 flying machine had been conveyed to BOAC. The last 10 flying machine of the request were worked as Series 300 air ship for transoceanic flights. In April 1959, a Model 102 Britannia was rented by BOAC to Ghana Airways for flights among Accra and London, and a few more Britannias were obtained by the carrier in the mid 1960s. The Model 102 was in the long run made accessible to other BOAC partners, including Cathay Pacific, Central Africa, East African, Nigeria and Malayan carriers. 

The following generation arrangement depended on the long-run, blended traveler/cargo Model 200 arrangement that was proposed for common carrier use, in any case Bristol offered the arrangement to the Royal Air Force (RAF. The creation arrangement of three Model 252 and 20 Model 253 airplane were obtained by RAF Transport Command in 1959, allocated the assignment "Britannia C.2" (first Model 252 arrangement) and "C.1" (Model 253 arrangement). Those in RAF administration were allotted the names of stars, for example, "Arcturus", "Sirius" and "Vega". On retirement from the RAF in 1975, many Model 200 arrangement were in this way utilized by autonomous common administrators for load activities, harkening back to their unique expected job. 

In spite of the fact that the Bristol Model 302 was constructed first as a major aspect of the first BOAC request, BOAC discharged this arrangement to different carriers; "Aeronaves de Mexico" took two Model 302s, which entered administration in December 1957. The 18 Bristol Britannia 312s for BOAC were conveyed from September 1957 with its administration presentation on the first-ever direct departure from London to Canada on 19 December 1957. In late December 1957 BOAC started normal Britannia flights from London to New York. Different carriers, for example, Israel's "El Al", utilized the Britannia on transoceanic courses. In 1959 BOAC began flying the Britannia over the Pacific to Tokyo and Hong Kong, along these lines expanding their system round the world. The westward directing in 1959 for these intercontinental BOAC Britannia flights between the U.K. what's more, Asia was London-New York-San Francisco-Honolulu-Wake Island-Tokyo-Hong Kong. 

On 1 April 1958 Canadian Pacific Air Lines took conveyance of the first of six Model 314 Britannias, with an extra two Model 324s (worked to a 320 standard) arriving later and sold to Cathay Pacific in 1961. BOAC requested seven Model 302s, yet never took conveyance, rather they were taken on via aircrafts including "Aeronaves de MÄÅ¡xico" and Ghana Airways. The fundamental long-extend arrangement were the 310s, of which BOAC took 18 and, after conveyances started in September 1957, place them into administration among London and New York City; in March 1964 BOAC possessed 50 air ship, 10 being Britannia 312s. BOAC's last planned Britannia flight was April 1965. 

The 310 arrangement (the Model 318) additionally observed transoceanic administration with "Cubana de AviaciÄÅn" beginning in 1958, regardless of the Cuban Revolution the carrier had an uncommon accord with British flying machine producers to keep up this model of flying machine. In 1975 Cuban Britannias were utilized to transport many warriors of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces to Angola in Operation Carlota, an intermediary war. "Cubana de AviaciÄÅn" kept utilizing different Britannias until March 1990. 

Most flying machine were worked by Bristol at Filton, however 30 were worked at Belfast by Short Brothers and Harland. Because of the all-inclusive improvement rather than an anticipated generation of 180 Britannias, just 80 were sold. The negative involvement with the advancement of the Britannia caused BOAC to be increasingly wary towards other British-made air ship, for example, the Vickers VC10. All through the Britannia's life expectancy, the motor icing condition remained a "persistent potential peril" that flight groups eventually figured out how to make do with a "high-lo" flight routine that limited the risk, in spite of the fact that the issues of the Britannia can for the most part be connected to that of a producer undertaking a creative airframe configuration coordinated to a problematic motor, a plan disorder that remained especially overwhelming. Squadron Leader David Berry who had 5,000 hours on the sort described his encounters as flying "Excellence and the Beast." An all the more fitting tribute was as of late proffered by the editors of "Plane" as the "100 Great British Aircraft" (2008) were broke down with the Bristol Britannia considered as a real part of the "greats". 

Following buy of staying save parts from Royal Aircraft Establishment and Cubana, ZaÄÅ¼rois carriers kept on working Bristol Britannia into the mid 1990s on normal freight flights from N'djili Airport to different goals inside the nation. 

Seventy-four traveler carrier with 114Ã¢Â ft (35m) fuselage and controlled by four Bristol Proteus 705 

All payload variation with a 124Ã¢Â ft 3Ã¢Â in (38Ã¢Â m) fuselage, BOAC choice for five was dropped, none constructed. 

Like the 200 arrangement, however blended traveler and cargo. 

Traveler just "extended" adaptation of the 200 arrangement, consolidating longer fuselage, fit for conveying up to 139 (initially 99) travelers, medium-fuel limit. 

As 305 arrangement, however with fortified fuselage skin and undercarriage. Long-run fuel limit and was initially known as 300LR. 

Fourteen Britannias were lost with a sum of 365 fatalities somewhere in the range of 1954 and 1980. The most exceedingly bad mishap was the 1967 Nicosia Britannia catastrophe with lost life totalling 126.
