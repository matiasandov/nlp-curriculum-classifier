For a few days amidst January 2009, a feeble low-level flow endured in the Mozambique Channel, joined by discontinuous and confused convection, or rainstorms. By JanuaryÃ¢Â 17, a zone of convection continued about west-southwest of Antananarivo, Madagascar. At an opportune time JanuaryÃ¢Â 18; the course quickly united and sorted out while the tempests formed into firmly bended rainbands. Ecological conditions supported further advancement; an anticyclone shaped over the unsettling influence, a moving toward trough gave great surge, and the framework profited by both light wind shear and warm water temperatures. At 0600ÃÂ UTC on the eighteenth, the RÄÅ¡union MÄÅ¡tÄÅ¡o-France office (MFR) started warnings on Tropical Disturbance 07, noticing its strengthening as it floated southwestward. 

Six hours in the wake of being announced a tropical unsettling influence, MFR updated it to tropical wretchedness status, and the organization anticipated the framework would in the long run achieve top breezes of 130Ã¢Â km/h (80Ã¢Â mph) before moving shorewards. Its track was required to pursue that of another tropical tornado east of Madagascar, which would wind up Tropical Storm Eric. Late on JanuaryÃ¢Â 18, the framework quickly wound up muddled, just to re-sort out and accomplish typhoon status on JanuaryÃ¢Â 19; after doing as such, the Malagasy Weather Service named it "Fanele". Around a similar time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started issuing warnings on the tempest. The office noted vulnerability later on track of the tempest, because of association with Tropical Storm Eric east of Madagascar, and Fanele was situated inside a territory of frail directing flows. Typhoon Fanele immediately fortified, building up an eye highlight, and late on JanuaryÃ¢Â 19 the JTWC evaluated supported breezes of 120Ã¢Â km/h (75Ã¢Â mph); the office anticipated further reinforcing to crest winds of 140Ã¢Â km/h (85Ã¢Â mph). Around that time, Fanele started quick extending under truly positive natural conditions, and the MFR updated the tempest to tropical twister status with winds of 150Ã¢Â km/h (95Ã¢Â mph). After accomplishing tropical violent wind status, the MFR figure Fanele would escalate further to crest winds of 185Ã¢Â km/h (115Ã¢Â mph). 

Right off the bat JanuaryÃ¢Â 20, Cyclone Fanele started an upper east movement, following along the eastern outskirts of an edge situated over Mozambique. Later it turned southeastward affected by another edge further toward the east. The rainstorms sorted out further around the eye, and at 1200ÃÂ UTC on JanuaryÃ¢Â 20 the MFR assessed Fanele accomplished pinnacle winds of 185Ã¢Â km/h (115Ã¢Â mph) about west-northwest of Morondava along the Madagascar coast. In the meantime, its climatic weight was evaluated at 927ÃÂ hPa (mbar), and crest wind blasts were assessed at 261Ã¢Â km/h (162Ã¢Â mph). The JTWC additionally evaluated pinnacle winds of 185Ã¢Â km/h (115Ã¢Â mph). As it moved toward the coast, the violent wind turned out to be somewhat less composed, with flimsier convection and a less particular eye; the debilitating was expected to an eyewall substitution cycle. At around 0215ÃÂ UTC on JanuaryÃ¢Â 21, Fanele made landfall on the western Madagascar coastline, toward the southwest of Morondava. 

Twister Fanele debilitated rapidly over land; inside four hours of moving aground, its breezes diminished to 150Ã¢Â km/h (95Ã¢Â mph), and its breeze field extended. The eye include dispersed as the framework debilitated to typhoon status, and expanded breeze shear added to additionally debilitating. By JanuaryÃ¢Â 22, the ineffectively characterized flow moved over untamed waters, by which time its breezes debilitated to about 45Ã¢Â km/h (30Ã¢Â mph). After achieving the sea, convection started to change close to the flow, and Fanele re-accomplished hurricane status. Cooler waters caused convection decrease close to the inside, which started the procedure of extratropical change. Late on JanuaryÃ¢Â 22, the JTWC issued its keep going warning on the tempest. By JanuaryÃ¢Â 23, Fanele finished the change into an extratropical storm as it quickened toward the south-southeast. It continued as a particular tropical tornado until soon thereafter. 

In spite of the fact that the violent wind grew rapidly, experts were set up for the tempest; prior in the year, Madagascar's National Office for Natural Disasters Preparedness actualized an arrangement for confined tempest cautioning. Authorities sent admonitions by means of radio to residents in the way of Fanele, just as to anglers who were advised to abstain from leaving port.
