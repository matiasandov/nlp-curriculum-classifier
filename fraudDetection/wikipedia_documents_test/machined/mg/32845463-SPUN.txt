Through them, the Doctor is directed to the living head of Dorium Maldovar inside a tomb. Dorium uncovers that the Silence are committed to deflecting the Doctor's future, cautioning him that that quietness must fall when "the primary inquiry" is asked on the planet Trenzalore, which is "Specialist who?" To abstain from intersection his very own time stream, the Doctor gives the Teselecta group four solicitations to Lake Silencio for Amy and Rory, River Song, Canton Everett Delaware III, and a more youthful rendition of himself. 

The Doctor comes to Lake Silencio to meet his demise by a more youthful adaptation of River, who is being compelled to execute the Doctor in the robotized space suit devised by the Silence. Stream astounds the Doctor by depleting the space suit's weapons frameworks and turning away his demise. Time moves toward becoming "stuck" subsequently and starts to break down; the majority of Earth's history starts to run all the while at a fixed minute. 

On the Earth where all of time is going on without a moment's delay, Amy takes the Doctor to a pyramid base. Waterway is additionally there; mindful of the outcomes of her activities, she won't enable the Doctor to contact her, an occasion that lead to time returning to typical and the Doctor biting the dust.

At the point when River meets Amy for a container of wine, she is wearing military uniform and says that she "just move out of the "Byzantium"", and that she saw Amy there.

"The Wedding of River Song" closes the story circular segment of the Doctor's obvious demise which started in the arrangement opener, "The Impossible Astronaut" and resolves more bits of River Song's timetable. Notwithstanding this, it leaves questionable whether the Doctor and River are authentically hitched. Showrunner and scene essayist Steven Moffat portrayed it as "a major crazy ride of "Specialist Who" frenzy". One of the "frantic idea[s]" he incorporated into the scene, "Live Chess", came on the grounds that Moffat needed to make chessÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ which he called "a standout amongst the most exhausting diversions in the world"Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ into a perilous observer sport. Initially, the content did exclude the short scene with a Dalek; Moffat had planned to rest the Doctor's most well known foe for the 6th arrangement. Amy's showdown with Madame Kovarian, a scene which indicates what she may have been similar to had she not met the Doctor, was additionally included into the content later. 

Following the demise of on-screen character Nicholas Courtney, the Doctor learns in the scene that Courtney's character Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart has kicked the bucket calmly in a nursing home. Moffat said of the reference, "In an anecdote about the Doctor heading off to his demise, it appeared to be correct and legitimate to recognize one of the best misfortunes "Specialist Who" has persevered."

A few characters return in the scene, including Charles Dickens (Simon Callow) from "The Unquiet Dead", Winston Churchill (Ian McNeice) from "Triumph of the Daleks", the Silurian specialist Malohkeh (Richard Hope) from "The Hungry Earth"/"Without a second thought", the Teselecta and Captain Carter (Richard Dillane) from "How about we Kill Hitler", and the Headless Monks and Dorium (Simon Fisher-Becker) from "A Good Man Goes to War". McNeice felt there was space for his character to return, as "Triumph of the Daleks" had implied that he and the Doctor knew each other well. 

"The Wedding of River Song" was one of the last scenes taped for the arrangement; 29 April 2011 was the latest day of shooting. Notwithstanding, a scene from "We should Kill Hitler" was deferred and shot on 11 July 2011, making that the most recent day of recording for the arrangement. American TV lady Meredith Vieira recorded her report of Churchill's arrival to the Buckingham Senate before a green screen while taping a fragment for "The Today Show's" "Grapples Abroad" section in May 2011.

Gatiss, who has composed for "Specialist Who", additionally played Professor Richard Lazarus in "The Lazarus Experiment" (2007) and gave the voice of Danny Boy in "Triumph of the Daleks". 

The cast discovered working with the eye patches unusual as they needed to act with one eye; Alex Kingston commented that it made her "somewhat mixed up". Performing artist Karen Gillan was permitted to discharge a uniquely made automatic rifle utilized for movies. Churchill's Buckingham Senate was recorded in Cardiff's City Council building. The content required an "Indiana Jones" style burrow for the Headless Monks' chamber, however as that sort of area was not accessible in Cardiff a set was worked. The skulls were hand-made and required a ton of arrangement, so it was one of the primary things began for the scene's creation.

IGN's Matt Risley appraised "The Wedding of River Song" 8.5 out of 10, composing it "figured out how to integrate plot strings and character curves without a lot of Deus Ex Maguffiny consistency and with an entire host of trademark science fiction scene for sure". In spite of the fact that he thought the wedding "felt excessively hurried to leave any waiting enthusiastic persistent flavor", he lauded other passionate minutes in the scene and the way that everybody thinks the Doctor is dead will enable the show to investigate another edge. 

Gavin Fuller of "The Daily Telegraph" considered it an "uneven closure"; he commended it for being "outwardly smart" and loved the manner in which the Silence were dealt with, however thought the Teselecta arrangement was "somewhat of a cop-out".

Then again, HitFix's Alan Sepinwall believed that the goals from the wedding on were "fantastic", yet felt it could have managed without another imaginary world, as it was like the past finale "The Big Bang". Maureen Ryan of TV Squad scrutinized the scene for having too much "fancy odds and ends" which undermined the passionate minutes, particularly the wedding, which she didn't accept demonstrated that the Doctor was extremely infatuated with River.
