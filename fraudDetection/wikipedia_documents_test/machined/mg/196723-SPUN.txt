USS Boxer (CV-21) 

USS "Fighter" (CV/CVA/CVS-21, LPH-4) was one of 24 s of the United States Navy, and the fifth ship to be named for . She was propelled on 14 December 1944 and initiated by the little girl of a US Senator from Louisiana. 

Authorized past the point where it is possible to perceive any battle in World War II, "Fighter" spent a lot of her vocation in the Pacific Ocean seeing 10 visits in the western Pacific. Her underlying obligations included generally preparing and works out, including propelling the principal bearer based stream air ship, however grounding anticipated much movement in the late 1940s. At the flare-up of the Korean War, she was utilized as a flying machine transport before touching base off Korean waters as the third U.S. transporter to join the power. She upheld the Inchon arrivals and ensuing attack of North Korea, and was among the boats that offered help amid the Chinese counteroffensive against an under-readied and spread out United Nations (UN) compel. She saw three ensuing battle visits in Korea leading close air support and vital besieging in help of UN ground troops battling along the 38th parallel, as the fights lines had to a great extent cemented at this point. She was granted eight fight stars for her administration in Korea. 

After the Korean War, "Fighter" saw an assortment of obligations, including as an enemy of submarine fighting transporter and a land and/or water capable attack stage. She took an interest in various preparing practices including Operation Hardtack and Operation Steel Pike, just as a few possibilities including Operation Powerpack and the Cuban Missile Crisis. In her later years, she filled in as a pickup dispatch for rocket amid the Apollo program just as a flying machine transport to troops amid the Vietnam War. 

Despite the fact that she was widely altered inside as a component of her transformation to a Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH), outer alterations were minor, so all through her profession "Fighter" held the great appearance of a World War II "Essex"- class transport. She was decommissioned on 1 December 1969 following 25 years of administration and sold for scrap. 

"Fighter" was one of 24 "Essex"- class boats to be finished, among the biggest and most various capital boats created for World War II. She was requested in 1943. 

The ship was one of the "long-frame" plans of the class, which had started generation after March 1943. This "long structure" variation included protracting the bow over the waterline into a "scissors" structure. The expanded rake and flare gave deck space to two fourfold 40Ã¢Â mm mounts; these units likewise had the flight deck somewhat abbreviated forward to give better curves of flame. Of the "Essex"- class ships set down after 1942, just pursued the first "short bow" structure. The later ships have been differently alluded to as the "long-bow units", the "long-body gathering", or the ""Ticonderoga" class". In any case, the U.S. Naval force never kept up any institutional qualification between the long-structure and short-body individuals from the "Essex" class, and after war refits and overhauls were connected to the two gatherings similarly. 

Like other "long-structure" "Essex"- class transporters, "Fighter" had an uprooting of . She had a general length of , a light emission a draft of . The ship was fueled by eight 600 psi Babcock and Wilcox boilers, and Westinghouse outfitted steam turbines that built up that turned four propellers. Like other "Essex"- class bearers, she had a greatest speed of . The ship had an absolute group supplement of 3,448. Like other "Essex"- class ships, she could be outfitted with 12 5-inch (127 mm)/38 bore weapons showed in four sets and four single emplacements, just as eight fourfold Bofors 40 mm firearms and 46 Oerlikon 20 mm guns. In any case, in contrast to her sisters, "Fighter" was outfitted rather with 72 40Ã¢Â mm weapons and 35 20Ã¢Â mm guns. 

Her bottom was laid on 13 September 1943 by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company at its office in Newport News, Virginia. She was the fifth ship of the US Navy to be named "Fighter", after , which had been caught by the U.S. amid the War of 1812. The last ship to hold up under the name had been a preparation send in 1905. The new bearer was propelled on 14 December 1944 and she was dedicated by Ruth D. Overton, the little girl of U.S. Representative John H. Overton. The ship's expense is evaluated at $68,000,000 to $78,000,000. 

"Fighter" was charged on 16 April 1945 under the direction of Captain D. F. Smith. She thusly started ocean preliminaries and a squeeze journey. Before these were finished, the Empire of Japan surrendered on V-J Day, denoting the finish of World War II before "Fighter" could partake. She joined the Pacific Fleet at San Diego in August 1945 and the following month she steamed for Guam, turning into the lead of Task Force 77, a position she held until 23 August 1946. Amid this visit, she visited Japan, Okinawa, the Philippines, and China. 

She came back to San Francisco on 10 September 1946, set out Carrier Air Group 19 flying the Grumman F8F Bearcat contender. With this supplement, "Fighter" started a progression of peacetime watches and preparing missions off the shore of California amid a generally uneventful period amid 1947. Notwithstanding keeping an eye on challenges expedited by the grounding of the US military after World War II, "Fighter" stayed dynamic in Pacific preparation bores around the West Coast and Hawaii. In 1948, she led various short travels with US Navy Reserve faculty. On 10 March 1948, a North American FJ-1 Fury propelled from "Fighter", the principal such dispatch of an all-stream air ship from an American transporter, which permitted resulting trial of fly plane carrying warship tenet. For the rest of 1948 and 1949, she took an interest in various fight penetrates and went about as a preparation transporter for fly flying machine pilots. 

She was dispatched to the Far East on another visit on 11 January 1950. She joined the seventh Fleet in the locale, making a generosity visit to South Korea and engaging South Korean president Syngman Rhee and his better half Franziska Donner. what's more, toward the finish of the visit came back to San Diego on 25 June 1950, a similar day as the episode of the Korean War. At the time, she was past due for a support update, however she didn't have sufficient energy to finish it before being dispatched once more. 

With the episode of the Korean War, the U.S. powers in the Far East had a critical requirement for provisions and flying machine. The main plane carrying warships close Korea were and . "Fighter" was requested into administration to ship flying machine from California to the battling on the Korean Peninsula. She made a record-breaking intersection of the Pacific Ocean, leaving Alameda, California on 14 July 1950 and touching base at Yokosuka, Japan on 23 July, an excursion of 8 days and 7 hours. She conveyed one hundred forty-five North American P-51 Mustangs and six Stinson L-5 Sentinels of the United States Air Force bound for the Far East Air Force just as 19 Navy airplane, 1,012 Air Force bolster work force, and of provisions for the United Nations troops battling the North Korean attack of South Korea, including critically required extra parts and weapons. A lot of this hardware had been taken from Air National Guard units in the United States as a result of a general lack of materiel. She started her arrival trip from Yokosuka on 27 July and landed back in California on 4 August, for a trek of 7 days, 10 hours and 36 minutes, again breaking the record for a trans-Pacific voyage. She conveyed no stream flying machine, however, on the grounds that they were regarded too fuel wasteful for the underlying resistance mission in Korea. When "Fighter" touched base in Korea, the UN powers had set up prevalence noticeable all around and ocean. 

After quick fixes in California, "Fighter" left Carrier Air Group 2, flying the Vought F4U Corsair propeller driven contender aircraft, and withdrew again for Korea on 24 August, this time in a battle job. She had 110 air ship on board, expected to supplement the several flying machine officially working in Korea. On the way to the promontory, the bearer barely kept away from Typhoon Kezia which impeded her excursion. She was the fourth plane carrying warship to touch base in Korea to take an interest in the war, after "Triumph" and "Valley Forge" had landed in June and followed toward the beginning of August. She arrived past the point where it is possible to partake in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, however rather she was requested to join a flotilla of 230 US ships which would take an interest in Operation Chromite, the UN counterattack at Inchon. On 15 September, she upheld the arrivals by sending her air ship in a nearby air bolster job, blocking North Korean fortifications and correspondence to keep them from countering the assault. Be that as it may, right off the bat in the task, her impetus framework was harmed when a decrease gear in the ship's motor down and out, a loss of her past due upkeep. The ship's designers worked around the issue to keep the bearer in task, yet she was restricted to 26 ties. 

She proceeded with this job as the UN troops recovered Seoul days after the fact. "Fighter" proceeded with this help as UN troops propelled north and into North Korea, however left for the United States on 11 November for refit and upgrade. US military commandants trusted the war in Korea was finished, and had requested various different bearers out of the zone and were hence under-arranged toward the start of the Chosin Reservoir Campaign when the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered the war against the UN. War zone authorities mentioned "Fighter" come back to Korea as quickly as time permits, however she didn't promptly return as administrators dreaded it may lessen the Navy's capacity to react if another contention or crisis broke out somewhere else. 

"Boxer"s drive issues required broad fix so she came back to San Diego to lead them. Upon entry, she offloaded Air Group 2, which at that point set out for Korea again on board "Valley Forge". After a fix and refit in California, "Fighter" was set up for a second visit in Korea. She left Carrier Air Group 101. The gathering was made out of Navy Reserve squadrons from Dallas, Texas, Glenview, Illinois, Memphis, Tennessee and Olathe, Kansas, and the greater part of its pilots were reservists who had been called to dynamic obligation. She rejoined Task Force 77, and started activities in Korea on 29 March 1951, and her squadrons were the principal Naval Reserve pilots to dispatch strikes in Korea. A large portion of these missions were airstrikes against Chinese ground powers along the 38th parallel, and this obligation went on until 24 October 1951. Amid this time, the bearer worked around "Point Oboe", a zone off the shore of Wonsan. They would pull back another east when they required renewal or refueling. A huge destroyer screen ensured the transporters, however MiG-15 assaults against them didn't happen. 

After another time of rest and refits, "Fighter" withdrew California 8 February 1952 for her third visit in Korea, with Carrier Air Group 2 set out, comprising of F9F in VF-24, F4U in VF 63 and VF-64, and AD in VF-65. Rejoining Task Force 77, her missions amid this visit comprised principally of key besieging against focuses in North Korea, as the forefronts in the war had generally set along the 38th Parallel. On 23 and 24 June, her planes led strikes against the Sui-ho hydro-electric complex related to , and "Philippine Sea". 

On 5 August 1952, a flame broke out on the shed deck of "Fighter" at 05:30 when a fuel tank of a flying machine burst into flames while the ship was directing battle activities in the Sea of Japan. The flame seethed on the transporter's overhang deck for 4Ã¢ÂÂ5 hours before being stifled. The last aggregate of losses was 8 dead, 1 missing, 1 basically harmed, 1 genuinely consumed and around 70 overwhelmed by smoke. Of the 63 who had gone over the side, all were safeguarded and came back to the ship. Eighteen air ship, generally Grumman F9F-2 Panthers, were harmed or decimated. She steamed for Yokosuka for crisis fixes from 11 to 23 August. She came back to the Korean theater, and from 28 August to 2 September she tried another weapons framework, with six radio guided Grumman F6F Hellcats stacked with bombs guided to targets, bringing about two hits and one close miss. They are viewed as the main guided rockets to be propelled from a bearer in battle. On 1 September her airplane likewise partook in a substantial shelling mission of an oil refinery close Aoji, on the Manchurian fringe. She came back to San Francisco for increasingly broad fixes on 25 September. In October 1952, she was re-assigned CVA-21, meaning an "assault plane carrying warship." 

Following broad fixes, she steamed for Korea again on 30 March 1953, and continued activities a month later with her Corsairs set out. Her missions around this time were commonly key shelling missions, anyway the adequacy of these last missions were blended, with some neglecting to accomplish key outcomes. She likewise given close air backing to UN troops for the last a long time of the war before a cease-fire was come to at Panmunjom in July 1953, finishing significant battle tasks in Korea. Amid this time, the opposite sides frequently directed exorbitant assaults so as to reinforce their haggling positions at the arranging table. "Fighter" stayed in Korean waters until November 1953. She got eight fight stars for her administration in Korea. 

In 1951 she shows up in the film "Submarine Command", with William Bendix, and William Holden, at that point conveying a supplement of helicopters. 

Following the Korean War, "Fighter" came back to the United States. She directed a voyage through the Pacific all through 1954 which was generally uneventful, trailed by a rest in the United States and another visit in the Pacific in late 1955 and mid 1956, which was likewise uneventful. 

She was changed over to an enemy of submarine fighting transporter in mid 1956, re-assigned CVS-21. She finished another voyage through the western Pacific in late 1956 and mid 1957, which was her tenth and last organization to the zone. In late 1957, the naval force started exploring different avenues regarding the idea of a transporter working completely with assault helicopters, and "Fighter" was utilized to test the idea. 

In 1958, "Fighter" was the leader amid Operation Hardtack, a progression of atomic weapons tests in the focal Pacific. Soon thereafter, she was exchanged to the Atlantic Fleet, and turned out to be a piece of another land and/or water capable strike squadron with four Landing Ship Tank vessels outfitted with helicopter stages. The trial idea would take into consideration fast organization of US Marine Corps faculty and helicopter squadrons. For the rest of 1958 components of this power were sorted out on board "Fighter" and she was renamed LPH-4, meaning an "Arrival Platform Helicopter", on 30 January 1959. 

For the following 10 years, "Fighter" worked primarily out of the Caribbean as a land and/or water capable ambush transporter. Amid this obligation, she was on station amid the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1964, she embraced her first visit to the Mediterranean when she partook in Operation Steel Pike, the biggest land and/or water capable exercise ever. 

With two LSD ships, "Fighter" was dispatched to Hispaniola on 29 August 1964 on a compassionate mission to help Haiti and the Dominican Republic whose framework had been harmed by Hurricane Cleo. The boats gave therapeutic guide and cleared regular folks dislodged by the tempest. On 27 April 1965 "Fighter" came back to the Dominican Republic with Helicopter Squadron 264 and a supplement of Marines. They emptied around 1,000 US nationals from the nation in the wake of a transformation in the nation. It was a piece of Operation Powerpack which would in the long run observe the US control of that nation. Later in 1965, she was utilized as a vehicle vessel for the Vietnam War. The transporter transported 200 helicopters of the US Army's first Cavalry Division to South Vietnam. She made a second excursion to Vietnam in mid 1966 when she transported Marine Corps airplane to South Vietnam. In any case, she didn't take part in battle tasks amid that war. 

On 26 February 1966, "Fighter" recouped AS-201, an unmanned dry run of the Apollo program which had propelled from Cape Kennedy, Florida on board a Saturn 1B rocket. The case had landed east of Ascension Island and one of "Fighters helicopters lifted it up. From 16Ã¢ÂÂ17 March 1966, "Fighter" was the assigned Atlantic prime recuperation transport for Gemini 8, albeit recouped the shuttle and two crew members after it experienced issues. 

She was decommissioned on 1 December 1969 following 25 years of administration, and she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. 

She was sold for scrap on 13 March 1971.
