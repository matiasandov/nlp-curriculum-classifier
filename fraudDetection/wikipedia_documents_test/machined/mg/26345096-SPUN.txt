Icelandic Naming Committee 

The Icelandic Naming Committee (; articulated )Ã¢ÂÂalso referred to in English as the Personal Names CommitteeÃ¢ÂÂmaintains an official register of endorsed Icelandic given names and oversees the presentation of new given names into Icelandic culture. 

The Naming Committee was set up in 1991 to decide if new given names not recently utilized in Iceland are reasonable for reconciliation into the nation's language and culture. The panel includes three representatives who serve for a long time, delegated by the Minister of JusticeÃ¢ÂÂone to be designated by the Icelandic Language Committee, one by the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Iceland, and one by the college's Faculty of Law. 

A name not as of now on the official rundown of affirmed names must be submitted to the naming panel for endorsement. Another name is considered for its similarity with Icelandic custom and for the probability that it may cause the carrier humiliation. Under Article 5 of the Personal Names Act, names must be perfect with Icelandic sentence structure (in which all things, including appropriate names, have linguistic sexual orientation and change their structures in a precise manner as indicated by the language's case framework). Names should likewise contain just letters happening in the Icelandic letters in order, and with just infrequent exemptions, a name's linguistic sex must match the sex of the individual bearing the name. 

As of the finish of 2012, the Personal Names Register () contained 1,712 male names and 1,853 female names. 

JÄÅn Gnarr, previous city hall leader of ReykjavÄÂ­k, dissented the board's refusal of his solicitation to legitimately drop "Kristinsson" from his name regardless of his craving to disassociate himself from his dad. JÄÅn called attention to that if Robert Mugabe moved to Iceland, as an outsider he would be permitted to keep that non-accommodating name, yet that local Icelanders were not permitted to have non-adjusting names. He was additionally unfit to lawfully name his little girl "Camilla" after her grandma; it was rather spelled "Kamilla" on the grounds that C isn't a piece of the Icelandic letter set. JÄÅn was permitted to lawfully change his name in 2015. 

The board would not permit BlÄÅr BjarkardÄÅttir RÄÅnarsdÄÅttir (brought into the world 1997) to be enrolled under the name given to her as a child, because the manly thing ("delicate breeze" in Icelandic) could be utilized just as a man's name. BlÄÅrÃ¢ÂÂidentified in authority records as ("young lady" in Icelandic)Ã¢ÂÂand her mom, BjÄÅrk EiÄÂ°sdÄÅttir, tested the board's choice in court, contending that had been utilized by Nobel PrizeÃ¢ÂÂwinning Icelandic creator HalldÄÅr Laxness as the name of a female character in his 1957 novel "The Fish Can Sing" (). One other lady in Iceland was at that point enrolled at the time with the name BlÄÅr, and two declensions (sets of case forms)Ã¢ÂÂone manly and one feminineÃ¢ÂÂexist for the name. 

On 31 January 2013, the ReykjavÄÂ­k locale court led in the family's support and overruled the naming board of trustees, finding that could in reality be both a man's and a lady's name and that BlÄÅr had an established ideal to her own name, and dismissing government guarantees that it was important to deny her solicitation so as to ensure the Icelandic language. After the court's choice, Iceland's inside priest affirmed that the administration would acknowledge the decision and would not claim the situation to the nation's Supreme Court. The seat of the naming board of trustees, just as a representative for the Ministry of the Interior, said the decision for BlÄÅr's situation could incite the legislature to return to the ebb and flow laws on close to home names. 

The advisory group would not acknowledge the names of Duncan and Harriet CardewÃ¢ÂÂIcelandic-conceived offspring of a British dad and an Icelandic motherÃ¢ÂÂbecause their names did not meet the criteria for being added to the library of affirmed names. The youngsters had initially utilized international IDs with the substitute names "Drengur" (kid) and "StÄÅlka" (young lady); be that as it may, in 2014, Icelandic specialists would not reestablish Harriet's visa at all without a lawfully adequate name. Since the Cardews were going to venture out to France, they acquired crisis British international IDs for Duncan and Harriet; the guardians likewise reported they would document a formal grievance protesting the naming board of trustees' dismissal of their youngsters' names and the visa office's refusal to recharge their Icelandic identifications. The Cardews reported in June 2016 that they had won their case and their kids' names would be perceived.
