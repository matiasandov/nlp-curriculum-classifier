Through the course of just about 40 years, he served his nation in three wars. His maritime profession started on a destroyer in the last a very long time of World War I. Following direction of the destroyer and strategic work preceding World War II, he took order of the "Missouri" in 1944. 

Callaghan is maybe best known for requesting, regardless of contradiction from a portion of his team, that a respectable memorial service be held for an adversary pilot who kicked the bucket amid a suicide assault on the "Missouri" in 1945. Following World War II, he coordinated the US Navy's transportation administration and filled senior order jobs in eastern Asia, including authority of the US Pacific Fleet's Amphibious Force amid the Korean War. He resigned from the US Navy at the position of bad habit naval commander in 1957 and worked in non military personnel oceanic transport before resigning to Maryland. 

Callaghan was conceived on August 8, 1897, the child of representative Charles William Callaghan and Rose Wheeler Callaghan. The family was dedicated Roman Catholic. His senior sibling, Daniel Callaghan (1890Ã¢ÂÂ1942), would later turn into a US Navy back naval commander and after death Medal of Honor beneficiary. The two siblings learned at Saint Ignatius College Preparatory in San Francisco, Daniel graduating in the class of 1907 and William seven years after the fact. The two men additionally therefore went to the United States Naval Academy, Daniel graduating in 1911 and William in the class of 1918. That class was requested to dynamic administration with the passage of the United States into World War I. 

Callaghan served on a destroyer amid the most recent a half year of World War I. He got a Master of Science qualification in electrical designing from Columbia University in 1925, and would turn into a Knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. In the mid-1920s, he filled in as aide designing officer on board the light cruiser , which was then performing exploring obligations. From 1932 to 1933, he was a lieutenant on board the plane carrying warship . 

At the position of authority, Callaghan captained the destroyer USS "Reuben James" from June 1936 to March 1938, and in this manner joined the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations in 1939. Before the US entered World War II, he was positioned in London in a strategic job. Amid the initial segment of World War II, he filled in as a coordinations officer on the staff of the Commander in Chief, US Pacific Fleet, Admiral Chester Nimitz. He got the Legion of Merit for this work. 

On June 11, 1944, Callaghan turned into the main chief of the USS "Missouri", the last war vessel charged by the US Navy. He directed the "Missouri" in commitment at Iwo Jima and Okinawa. 

At 2:42 on April 11, 1945, off the bank of Kikaijima Island, a Japanese military pilot in an A6M5c Zero propelled a kamikaze assault on the USS "Missouri". Bill Obitz, a sailor at the time, reviewed that the assaulting plane drew closer at an extraordinary point and assessed that it was 20 feet (6 m) over the water. Albeit struck by serious antiaircraft flame, the plane endure and struck the ship's starboard side at casing 169 underneath the principle deck. While the effect of one of the plane's wings began a flame at 5-inch mount number 3, its 500-pound bomb did not explode, so the harm was insignificant. There were no American setbacks, yet the Japanese pilot passed on. Portions of the plane's destruction and the top portion of the pilot's body arrived on board the "Missouri". The plane's wing was swung over to the team to be cut up for keepsakes. 

Notwithstanding challenges from crew members, who needed the remaining parts hosed over the deck, Callaghan demanded that the youthful Japanese aviator had carried out his responsibility to the best of his capacity, with respect, and merited a military burial service. Stephen Cromwell, a corpsman at the time, later reviewed, "I had the capacity to recoup his body and I called up to the scaffold to inquire as to whether I should toss it over the edge ... Chief Callaghan stated, Ã¢ÂÂNo, when we secure, bring it down to the wiped out sound, and we'll have an internment for him tomorrow.Ã¢ÂÂ" Ivan Dexter, another team part, gave his record of occasions to Herb Fahr, reviewing that the top portion of the Japanese pilot's body was dispersed over the deck, while the base half fell with the remainder of the plane into the ocean. What survived from the body was conveyed to wiped out inlet for examination, and different "Missouri" team took gifts from the garments, including the head protector, scarf, and coat. Following examination, the remaining parts were put in a canvas pack with sham shell housings to overload it. 

The next day, the Japanese pilot got a military memorial service adrift. An ad libbed Japanese banner, sewn by one of the ship's bosun's mates, secured the pack holding the man's remaining parts. The ship's clergyman dedicated the body to the ocean and the six pallbearers let it slide over the edge, joined by a volley of rifle shoot. Fahr expressed, "There was still much harshness with respect to numerous in the group, however at this point, the noteworthy thing was finished." According to Lee Collins, guest activities executive for the Battleship Missouri Memorial, Callaghan said that the service was just a tribute to "a kindred warrior who had shown bravery and dedication, and who had paid a definitive penance with his life, battling for his nation." 

On May 14, 1945, Callaghan passed direction of the "Missouri" on to Captain Stuart Murray, who had been a colleague of his at the US Naval Academy. 

In 1946, Callaghan held the position of back chief naval officer, and in that year he gave an introduction to the Naval War College on his involvement in the Naval Transportation Service before the war. On October 1, 1949, he was designated the principal authority of the Military Sea Transportation Service, which would later turn into the Military Sealift Command. He was elevated from back chief naval officer to bad habit naval commander around this time. From 1953 to 1954, amid the Korean War, he directed the Amphibious Force of the US Pacific Fleet. From 1954 to 1956, he filled in as Commander, US Naval Forces Far East. He at that point supplanted resigning Vice Admiral Francis Low as Commander of the Western Sea Frontier. He resigned from the US Navy at the position of bad habit chief naval officer in 1957. 

Following retirement from military administration, Callaghan filled in as Vice President of American Export Lines, and after that as Chairman of the Maritime Transportation Research Board under the National Academy of Sciences. He would later have a vehicle send named after him: the . 

Late throughout everyday life, Callaghan dwelled in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Following a stroke, he passed on July 8, 1991, at Bethesda Naval Hospital. His first spouse, Helen Brunett Callaghan (1896Ã¢ÂÂ1970), and second wife, Martha Rawlins Callaghan (1905Ã¢ÂÂ1973), predeceased him. He was made due by his third spouse, Sarah Duerson Callaghan (1914Ã¢ÂÂ2011), and two kids, William M. Callaghan Jr. (a resigned US Navy back chief of naval operations) and Jane Callaghan Gude (c. 1925Ã¢ÂÂ2008), just as eight grandkids. Callaghan's grandkids incorporate William Callaghan III, Chad Callaghan, and A. Carey Callaghan. His extraordinary grandkids incorporate Caitlin Callaghan, Larkin Callaghan, and Connor Callaghan, and numerous others. 

Callaghan's choice on the Japanese pilot's burial service in 1945 would get acclaim years after the fact, despite the fact that a dedication administration on board the "Missouri" in April 2001 pulled in debate. Paving the way to the administration, Callaghan's child stated, "My dad trusted an internment adrift for the pilot was the best activity. He felt it would set a genuine case for the team in appearing for the life of individuals, notwithstanding for the general population you are contradicting." 

Junko Kamata, a niece of one of the Japanese pilots murdered in the April 1945 fight, stated, "I need to express gratitude toward Captain Callaghan for his helpful thought for kamikaze officers." Minoru Shibuya, Japanese Consul General, called Callaghan's activities "a radiant deed, to salute the [pilot's] fortitude." Daniel Inouye, US Senator from Hawaii, mirrored that "from the beginning of progress, warriors regarded their enemies; it was an implicit code of respect. At the point when Callaghan saw the broken body of his sworn adversary lying upon his ship, he saw him not as a foe, however essentially as a man." 

At a 1998 get-together of "Missouri" veterans, a significant number of those present who had served amid World War II felt that, on reflection, their commander had acted effectively. Robert Kihune, a resigned US Navy bad habit chief of naval operations, stated, "In wartime, fearlessness is estimated as much by one's activities as their quality of administration amid the warmth of fight ... I think the authority characteristics appeared by Captain Callaghan outline the perfect of what we need our military heads to pursue." 

a. Three volunteers from the USS "Missouri" Memorial Association limited the character of the Japanese pilot to three conceivable outcomes: Lieutenant Junior Grade Shigeju Yaguchi, Petty Officer Second Class Takashi Sogabe, and Petty Officer Second Class . Yaguchi was matured 23 years at the time, while Sogabe and Ishino were both matured 19 years. A data plaque on board the USS "Missouri" in December 2011 supporters the view that the pilot was most likely Ishino.

c. Two sources express that Callaghan was elevated to the position of Vice Admiral not long after his arrangement to order the MSTS. Student of history Salvatore Mercogliano (c. 2000) states that the underlying officer of the MSTS was "Back Admiral William M. Callaghan (along these lines elevated to Vice Admiral)" and a 1962 ship registry expresses that "[MSTS's] first authority, Rear-Admiral William Callaghan, was before long elevated to bad habit chief naval officer, and the M.S.T.S. has been a ' three-star' direction from that point forward" (p.Ã¢Â 41). Another article by Mercogliano (2000) states that Callaghan was as yet positioned a Rear Admiral toward the beginning of July 1950. Two different sources, a later article by Mercogliano (2009) and Military Sealift Command's course of events, express that MSTS's first leader was Vice Admiral William M. Callaghan. It isn't certain whether these last two sources were essentially detailing Callaghan's position at the season of composing, admirably after 1949, or whether they were inferring that Callaghan was at that point a Vice Admiral before assuming responsibility for the MSTS. 

d. Remarking on the choice to hold a dedication administration for the Japanese pilots on board the USS "Missouri", US veteran Lloyd Prang stated, "If the Japanese need to memorialize their pilots and warriors, let them do it on THEIR dirt." Marine Corps veteran Rand Potts thought of it as "a special arrangement to energize Japanese guests into visiting the Missouri."
