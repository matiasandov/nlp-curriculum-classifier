New York State Route 426 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 426 (NYÃÂ 426) is a state interstate found completely inside Chautauqua County, New York, in the United States. It runs only over from one segment of the Pennsylvania state line to another, going through two little villas and giving the Southern Tier Expressway (Interstate 86 or I-86 and NY 17) with its westernmost exit in New York. NYÃÂ 426 is the westernmost northÃ¢ÂÂsouth state parkway in New York. 

At the two intersections of the state line it proceeds as Pennsylvania RouteÃ¢Â 426 (PAÃÂ 426). It is the main other state thruway other than NYÃÂ 440 that can guarantee the refinement of being a center section of another state's comparably numbered roadway. The New York arrangement has remained for all intents and purposes unaltered since it was appointed as a feature of the 1930 renumbering of state roadways in New York, while the assignments of the streets it associates with in Pennsylvania have fluctuated throughout the years. The two fragments of PAÃÂ 426 were set up at various occasions during the 1940s. 

NYÃÂ 426 starts where the southern portion of PAÃÂ 426 leaves off at the Pennsylvania state line in French Creek north of Corry, Pennsylvania. The course travels north through country southwestern Chautauqua County to the little network known as Cutting, where it covers NYÃÂ 474 for a tenth of a mile (0.16Ã¢Â km) westbound before continuing its trek northward. Generally north of Cutting, NYÃÂ 426 veers toward the west to stay away from a substantial edge arranged close Beaver Meadow Brook, a little stream prompting French Creek. The course pursues the stream to where it merges with the spring, at that point parallels French Creek northward toward the waterside village of French Creek. The rivulet and NYÃÂ 426 split south of the network, with the stream proceeding with French CreekÃ¢ÂÂMina Road to the village while NYÃÂ 426 sidesteps French Creek toward the west. The course enters the town of Mina after converging Harrington Hill Road a mile (1.6Ã¢Â km) toward the north. 

A half mile (0.8Ã¢Â km) into Mina, NYÃÂ 426 comes quite close to Findley Lake, a waterway long from south to north and as wide as one-half mile (0.8Ã¢Â km) at focuses. The course pursues the eastern edge of the lake north to the villa of Findley Lake, arranged at the northern tip of the lake. Here, NYÃÂ 426 covers NYÃÂ 430 westbound for three squares through the network before interfacing with the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86 and NYÃÂ 17) by method for an exchange north of Findley Lake. The exit is the westernmost exit on NYÃÂ 17; in any case, the freeway itself proceeds with west to I-90 close Erie, Pennsylvania, as I-86. Past the interstate, NYÃÂ 426 proceeds with northwest for another through dull landscape to the Pennsylvania state line, where it turns into the northern section of PAÃÂ 426. 

The total of NYÃÂ 426 was relegated as a major aspect of the 1930 renumbering of state parkways in New York as a northward augmentation of PAÃÂ 189, a short course driving south to Corry, Pennsylvania. Initially, NYÃÂ 426 parted from its cutting edge arrangement at French CreekÃ¢ÂÂMina Road to serve the villa of French Creek through French CreekÃ¢ÂÂMina and King streets before rejoining its present course west of the village. The course was realigned onto its present arrangement west of French Creek . In the mid 1940s, the 426 assignment was expanded southward into Pennsylvania as PAÃÂ 426. It was additionally expanded northwestward into Pennsylvania in the mid-1940s, successfully making NYÃÂ 426 the missing section of a generally spasmodic PAÃÂ 426.
