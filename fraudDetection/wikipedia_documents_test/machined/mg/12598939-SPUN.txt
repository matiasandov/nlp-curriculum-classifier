Precious stone stingray 

The precious stone stingray ("Dasyatis dipterura") is a types of stingray in the family Dasyatidae. It is found in the beach front waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean from southern California to northern Chile, and around the GalÄÄpagos and Hawaiian Islands. This base occupant for the most part possesses sandy or sloppy pads close rough reefs and kelp backwoods, to a profundity of , however off Hawaii it might extend impressively more profound. As its normal name recommends, this species has a precise, precious stone formed pectoral balance plate that is plain dark colored or dim above, with lines of tubercles along the midline and on the "shoulders". The long, whip-like tail has both dorsal and ventral blade folds, which recognize this beam from the firmly comparative longtail stingray ("D.Ã¢Â longa"). It regularly develops to over. 

While scanning for nourishment, precious stone stingrays may shape gatherings of up to many people. It is most dynamic during the evening and preys for the most part on tunneling spineless creatures and little hard fishes, which are removed from the base through suction or burrowing. This species is aplacental viviparous: when the incipient organisms exhaust their yolk supply, they are sustained by histotroph ("uterine milk") created by the mother. Females bear 1Ã¢ÂÂ4 puppies each late spring in estuaries; mating is trailed by a ten-month time of either sperm stockpiling or captured embryonic improvement, after which the developing lives quickly adult over 2Ã¢ÂÂ3 months. The slowest-developing stingray known, this species isn't strong against angling weight. It is gotten for nourishment by high quality fishers in Latin America, especially in Mexico where it is a standout amongst the most financially essential beams. This has driven it to be surveyed as Near Threatened in Mexico by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while the species in general is recorded as Data Deficient. In spite of the fact that harmless towards people, the jewel stingray's long, venomous tail spine is conceivably unsafe. 

In 1880, the precious stone stingray was depicted twice by three American ichthyologists: as "Dasybatus dipterurus" by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in "Procedures of the United States National Museum", and as "Trygon brevis" by Samuel Garman in "Release of the Museum of Comparative Zoology". Jordan and Gilbert's record was distributed in May while Garman's was distributed in October, making "dipterurus" (female "dipterura") the right name as it was distributed first. In any case, when Garman synonymized the two out of 1913 he improperly offered priority to "brevis", prompting long-standing perplexity. Both "Dasybatus" and "Trygon" were later synonymized with the variety "Dasyatis", however numerous creators still recorded "D.Ã¢Â brevis" instead of or notwithstanding "D.Ã¢Â dipterura". Garman additionally synonymized the Hawaiian stingray ("D.Ã¢Â hawaiensis") with "D.Ã¢Â dipterura" in 1913, which has since been trailed by most creators yet requires more examination for affirmation. 

The species syntypes were gathered from San Diego Bay, California. The particular designation "dipterura" is gotten from the Latin "di" ("two"), "ptero" ("wing"), and "ura" ("tail"), alluding to the balance overlap on the two sides of its tail. Rodent followed stingray is a previous regular name for this species. Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic examination, in light of morphology, decided the precious stone stingray and the bluntnose stingray ("D.Ã¢Â say") of the western Atlantic Ocean to be sister species, that presumable veered previously or with the arrangement of the Isthmus of Panama ("c." 3 Ma). Moreover, the two were observed to be the second-most basal taxa in their variety, after the basic stingray ("D.Ã¢Â pastinaca"). 

The precious stone stingray is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from southern California to northern Chile, just as around the GalÄÄpagos and Hawaiian Islands; it is exceptionally bottomless around Baja California and in the Gulf of California. At the northern and southern limits of its range, it is commonly just present amid times of appropriately warm water realized by El NiÄÄo. There is a record of this beam from off British Columbia, which is unverified and would be exceptionally irregular as it is known to be a tropical and warm-mild species. 

A base abiding occupant of inshore waters, the precious stone stingray favors sandy or sloppy bottoms, frequently close rough reefs or kelp backwoods. Off southern California, it more often than not happens from the intertidal zone to a profundity of amid the mid year, moving to profundities of amid pre-winter and winter. For obscure reasons, it wants to overwinter in kelp woods as opposed to sandy pads. Off Chile, the jewel stingray happens at a comparative profundity of . Then again, this species has been accounted for from as far down as off Hawaii, which if precise would propose that it uses an a lot more noteworthy scope of profundities than recently figured it out. 

The precious stone stingray accomplishes a plate width of or conceivably ; females become bigger than guys. Its pectoral balance plate is rhomboid fit as a fiddle, somewhat more extensive than long, with rakish external corners and inconspicuously curved edges. The nose is obtuse calculated and non-anticipating. The eyes are genuinely vast and promptly pursued by the spiracles (matched respiratory openings). The mouth is emphatically bended, containing 21Ã¢ÂÂ37 upper tooth lines and 23Ã¢ÂÂ44 lower tooth pushes; the teeth are little and obtuse, and masterminded into straightened surfaces. Three or five papillae (areola like structures) are found in succession over the floor of the mouth. 

The whip-like tail by and large measures up to one and half times the length of the circle, and bears one (more if substitutions have developed in) long, slim, serrated spine on the upper surface, closer to the base than the tip. Behind the spine, there are long dorsal and ventral blade creases that ascent bit by bit, achieving a generally high pinnacle before inclining down suddenly. The nearness of the upper blade overlay isolates this species from the comparative longtail stingray ("D.Ã¢Â longa"), which shares the greater part of its range. Be that as it may, the tail is frequently harmed, in which case separating the two species in the field turns into everything except unthinkable. Youthful beams have totally smooth skin, while grown-ups build up a column of low tubercles along the midline of the back, flanked by two shorter lines on the "shoulders". The tail likewise winds up canvassed in prickles. This species is a uniform olive to darker to dim above, obscuring to dark on the tail, and grayish underneath. 

The precious stone stingray is most dynamic around evening time, going through a great part of the day covered in sand with just its eyes distending. When rummaging for nourishment, it might be lone yet more ordinarily shapes bunches numbering up to the hundreds. There is solid isolation by sex and age. This species benefits from shellfish, molluscs, and different spineless creatures, just as little hard fishes; its amazing jaws and molar-like teeth enable it to pulverize hard-shelled prey. It for the most part targets tunneling creatures, yet may likewise take prey uncovered on the base. There is a record of a female over, that had pigged out herself on no less than 30 little crabs. In the BahÄÂ­a Magdalena tidal pond complex, Baja California Sur, its most essential wellspring of nourishment are pea crabs, trailed by the razor mollusk "Solyema valvulus", and after that polychaete worms. 

The run of the mill chasing system of the jewel stingray is to voyage simply over the ocean bottom, arriving on any prey experienced. It at that point rapidly switches its body all over with its plate, delivering negative strain to remove the prey from its tunnel. This beam has likewise been known to unearth vast pits by undulating its plate and spitting planes of water, in order to reveal covered prey. Jewel stingrays are much of the time trailed by littler fishes, including Mexican hogfish ("Bodianus diplotaenia"), Galapagos porgies ("Calamus taurinus"), greybar snorts ("Haemulon sexfasciatum"), old maid wrasses ("Halichoeres nichols"), and long-spine porcupinefish ("Diodon holocanthus"), which exploit the spineless creatures worked up by the beam's exercises. Known parasites of this species incorporate the tapeworms "Acanthobothrium bullardi", "A. dasi", "A. rajivi", and "A. soberoni", "Anthocephalum currani", "Parachristianella tiygonis", and "Pseudochristianello elegantissima", the accidents "Anaporrhutum euzeti" and "Probolitrema mexicana", and the monogenean "Listrocephalos kearni". 

Like different stingrays, the precious stone stingray is aplacental viviparous: the fetuses are at first fed by yolk, and later by histotroph ("uterine milk", wealthy in proteins and lipids) delivered by the mother. Just the left ovary and uterus are useful in grown-up females. A few straights along the Pacific bank of Baja California are referred to fill in as nurseries. The vast majority of the existence history data accessible on this species has originated from BahÄÂ­a Magdalena, where females bear one litter of 1Ã¢ÂÂ4 little guys every year. Romance and mating happens in pre-fall from July to August, yet because of a ten-month time of either sperm stockpiling or diapause (wherein the fetus ends up torpid), embryonic advancement does not start until the next year and is finished inside 2Ã¢ÂÂ3 months. Birthing happens in summer from July to September in shallow estuaries; the babies measure over. Amid El NiÄÄo years, the higher temperatures seem to move the planning of birth forward. The precious stone stingray has the most minimal development rate of any stingray species yet contemplated. Guys achieve sexual development at around crosswise over and 7 years old, while females develop slower as yet, achieving development at around crosswise over and 10 years old. The most extreme life expectancy has been evaluated somewhere around 19 years for guys and 28 years for females. 

No less than one casualty off southern California has come about because of the long, venomous tail spine of the precious stone stingray. Be that as it may, it isn't forceful and will for the most part escape given the chance. This beam isn't found off the United States in adequate numbers to be monetarily essential. Somewhere else in its range, it is gotten in significant numbers for human utilization, both purposefully and as bycatch; the pectoral blades or "wings" are sold crisp or fileted and salted. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) takes note of that the jewel stingray's low conceptive profitability renders it helpless to populace consumption, however at present needs enough organic and fishery information to survey it past Data Deficient generally, or in the U.S., Central, and South American pieces of its range. 

In Mexico, the precious stone stingray is a standout amongst the most essential segments of Pacific high quality shark and beam fisheries, involving around a tenth of the complete yearly catch. Its centrality is likely thought little of, as Mexican fishery reports every now and again experience the ill effects of misidentifications and an absence of animal groups explicit information. It is for the most part found amid summer and fall, being the most well-known beam arrived in BahÄÂ­a Magdalena, and second most normal beam arrived off Sonora state. Demersal gillnets are the primary angling gear utilized; both grown-up and adolescent beams effectively turned out to be snared in the work by their tail spines, with adolescents known to have contained the vast majority of the BahÄÂ­a Magdalena get in 1998Ã¢ÂÂ2000. This species is likewise frequently gotten unexpectedly in base trawls, on longlines, and in fish traps. Later on, natural surroundings debasement from expanding quantities of shrimp homesteads may represent an extra danger to this species in the area. Because of these weights, the IUCN has evaluated the precious stone stingray as Near Threatened in Mexican waters. No administration plans have yet been established for this species.
