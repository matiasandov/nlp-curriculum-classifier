St Peulan's Church, Llanbeulan is an excess Anglican church in Llanbeulan, in Anglesey, north Wales. The nave, which is the most seasoned piece of the structure, dates from the twelfth century, with a chancel and side sanctuary included the fourteenth century. The congregation has a textual style of early date, conceivably from the primary portion of the eleventh century: one student of history has said that it would at first have been utilized as a special stepped area and that "as a raised area of the pre-Norman period it is an interesting survivor in Wales and, without a doubt, in Britain". 

The excess church has been being taken care of by the philanthropy, the Friends of Friendless Churches since 2005. It is a Grade II* recorded structure, an assignment given to "especially vital structures of more than exceptional intrigue", since it is a medieval church of "run of the mill Anglesey type" that has held its basic character in spite of nineteenth century adjustments. 

The date of establishment of the congregation in Llanbeulan isn't known for certain, despite the fact that it is said that a congregation was established on this site in 630 by St Peulan. He was a follower of the Anglesey holy person Cybi. The most punctual pieces of the structure date from the twelfth century. It was the ward church of the zone, and had a sanctuary of simplicity at St Mary's Church, Tal-y-llyn (presently likewise repetitive). In November 1349, records of an examination in Beaumaris demonstrate that the minister serving St Peulan's was one of various Anglesey pastors to have kicked the bucket about that time, which was the point at which the Black Death was influencing Anglesey. Amid the nineteenth century, a lot of chapel reconstructing and rebuilding work occurred all through Anglesey, and St Peulan's was given another rooftop and new interior fittings as of now. It is presently a repetitive church and has been in the hands of the Friends of Friendless Churches since 2004; it is one of four houses of worship on Anglesey for which the philanthropy has duty. The philanthropy holds a 999-year rent with impact from 10ÃÂ June 2005. 

The congregation gave its name to the area of Llanbeulan: the Welsh word "" initially signified "walled in area" and afterward "church", and "Ã¢ÂÂbeulan" is an adjusted type of the holy person's name. It is in a daintily populated piece of provincial Anglesey, going toward the south-west of the town of Gwalchmai, and going toward the south-east of Bryngwran. A grassed track keeps running from the way to the congregation. Toward the east of the congregation, the churchyard contains a war grave of a Royal Welsh Fusiliers warrior of the First World War. 

The congregation is worked from rubble stone work, dressed with gritstone. The nave estimates 27Ã¢Â feet 6Ã¢Â inches by 15Ã¢Â feet 6Ã¢Â inches (8.4 by 4.7Ã¢Â m), the chancel is 15Ã¢Â feet 6Ã¢Â inches by 11Ã¢Â feet 9Ã¢Â inches (4.7 by 3.6Ã¢Â m), and the south house of prayer is 11Ã¢Â feet 3Ã¢Â inches by 16Ã¢Â feet (3.4 by 4.9Ã¢Â m). The structure has a slate rooftop with copings of stone. At the west end, there is a gabled bellcote with one chime; crosses made of iron are fixed to the tops of the chancel and south house of prayer. The nave of the congregation, which has two straights, was most likely worked in the twelfth century. A passage at the west end of the nave has been obstructed put over outwardly. The chancel, which is littler than the nave, and a house of prayer (on the south side of the structure joined to the nave) were included the fourteenth century, and the curves partitioning the nave from the sanctuary and the chancel are of this date. The passageway entryway, from the nineteenth century, is situated on the east side of the church and has a pointed opening. Close by the entryway is a stone engraved with the year 1637, and alongside that is a round-headed little window dating from the twelfth century, reset in the house of prayer mass of later date. It has been recommended that this window may have been reused from the blocked nave entrance. 

The east window of the chancel, from the fifteenth century, has two lights finished with trefoils and designed with cut heads. There is likewise a blocked fourteenth century window in the chancel's north divider and a mid sixteenth century window in the south divider. Different windows in the congregation date from the seventeenth century (house of prayer south window) and nineteenth century (nave). The seats date from the seventeenth century: one slow down in the chancel bears an engraved board of wood, dated 1664, recording that it is the seat of William Bold of Treyrddol. There are various remembrances inside the congregation from the seventeenth, eighteenth and mid nineteenth hundreds of years. The congregation's nineteenth century fittings, for example, the platform and special raised area rail, are plain. 

The most striking element of the congregation is its textual style, which dates from the late twelfth century, or conceivably even the initial segment of the eleventh century. It gauges by (outside estimations) and is profound. It is rectangular and enhanced on three sides. One of the shorter sides has a cross with four arms of equivalent length forced on a ring; at the base are two little sides of the equator, and the structure is encircled with groups (some plain, some enriched with chevrons or a contorted rope design). It has been recommended that the halves of the globe are honey bee skeps. One of the more extended sides has a line of curves shaping an arcade over an example of tablets. The other shorter side has a chequerwork design. The prehistorian David Petts has noticed that it is one of various text styles on Anglesey that has a region with next to zero cutting, maybe on the grounds that it was never foreseen that the plain side of the textual style would be seen or in light of the fact that the text style was cut in the wake of being placed in its situation in the congregation. Albeit comparative in style to other Anglesey textual styles, its rectangular shape is "novel", as indicated by Petts, and the cross on one side "finds no parallels among text styles of this period." 

One author, the student of history Peter Lord, has recommended that it was at first utilized as a special raised area. Tolerating the eleventh century dating, Lord expressed that "as a special stepped area of the pre-Norman period it is an exceptional survivor in Wales and, without a doubt, in Britain". Petts considers this "impossible", recommending that it might initially have been a reliquary. The Friends of Friendless Churches portrays the text style as the structure's "boss brilliance". It has additionally been classified "the best of Anglesey's amazing Romanesque arrangement." It has likenesses of plan and style with the textual styles of two different holy places on Anglesey (St Llwydian's Church, Heneglwys and St Iestyn's Church, Llaniestyn) and with one of the stone crosses at St Seiriol's Church, Penmon. 

The congregation is a Grade II* recorded structure Ã¢ÂÂ the second-most astounding (of three) evaluation of posting, assigning "especially essential structures of more than unique intrigue". It was given this status on 5 April 1971, and has been recorded in light of the fact that it is "a rustic Medieval church holding its straightforward character." It is portrayed by Cadw (the Welsh Assembly Government body in charge of the fabricated legacy of Wales) as a congregation "of regular Anglesey type", where the nineteenth century reclamation work has "held the straightforwardness of plan and development", and furthermore the congregation's medieval character. 

In the nineteenth century, the author Samuel Lewis said that it was "little and of discourteous workmanship", yet had "a few inquisitive highlights, for example, the text style that made it "profitable". The curator Angharad Llwyd, writing in 1833, portrayed it as "a little cruciform structure, arranged in a little fruitless valley", with the south transept "bearing proof of exceptionally incredible artifact." She expressed that there were a few windows "in the later English style, of good plan, particularly the east window of the chancel, which is an extremely unrivaled organization."
