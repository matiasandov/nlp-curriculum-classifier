HMS Unicorn (I72) 

HMS "Unicorn" was a flying machine fix ship and light plane carrying warship worked for the Royal Navy in the late 1930s. She was finished amid World War II and gave air spread over the land and/or water capable arriving at Salerno, Italy in September 1943. The ship was exchanged toward the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean toward the year's end. "Unicorn" bolstered the plane carrying warships of the armada on their activities until the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was framed in November 1944. She was moved to Australia in mid 1945 to help the BPF's activities amid Operation "Ice sheet", the Allied intrusion of Okinawa in May. To abbreviate the time required to renew the BPF's bearers, the ship was situated in the Admiralty Islands and in the Philippine Islands until the Japanese surrender in August. "Unicorn" was decommissioned and put for possible later use when she came back to the UK in January 1946. 

The ship was recommissioned in 1949 to help the light bearer of the Far East Fleet, as the Eastern Fleet had been redesignated after the finish of World War II. She was emptying flying machine and hardware in Singapore in June 1950 when the Korean War started. She burned through the greater part of the war shipping air ship, troops, stores and gear in help of Commonwealth tasks in Korea. "Unicorn" upheld different bearers amid tasks in Korea, however she turned into the main plane carrying warship to lead a shore assault with her weapons amid wartime when she assaulted North Korean eyewitnesses on the coast amid the war. The ship came back to the UK after the finish of the war and was again put available for later. She was recorded for transfer in 1958 and sold for scrap in 1959. 

The Abyssinia Crisis of 1934Ã¢ÂÂ35 exhibited to the Admiralty that it required a stop ship to help the plane carrying warships in dynamic administration, much the same as submarine and destroyer tenders bolstered those sorts. Such a ship would most likely play out a more extensive scope of flying machine fix and upkeep errands than plane carrying warships and on the full scope of air ship worked by the Royal Navy, including creatures of land and water. Chief naval officer Reginald Henderson, Controller of the Navy was instrumental for picking up endorsement for the ship and guaranteeing that she had a total flight deck that would enable her to land, administration and dispatch air ship on dynamic tasks. She was the primary ship worked in any naval force that could "do the full scope of air ship support and fix work notwithstanding the capacity to work airplane from the flight deck". Practically speaking, "Unicorn" demonstrated the estimation of the idea and two comparable help delivers, and were changed over into air ship upkeep sends by adjusting light plane carrying warships still under development. 

"Unicorn" had a general length of , a light emission and a draft of at profound burden. She was to some degree overweight as finished and uprooted at standard burden instead of her structured . Every one of the ship's two arrangements of Parsons equipped steam turbines drove one propeller. Steam was provided by six Admiralty three-drum water-tube boilers working at a weight of . The turbines were intended for an aggregate of and gave "Unicorn" a speed of . The ship conveyed of fuel oil which gave her a scope of at . 

So as to arrive flying machine on board, "Unicorn" was planned with a full-length, - long flight deck with capturing gear. She was likewise fitted with a sling fit for propelling an air ship to a speed of . The ship had two sheds, every high. The upper shed was 324ft by 65ft, and the lower 360ft by 62ft. Air ship were transported between the sheds and the flight deck by two flying machine (lifts); the forward lift estimated and the back one . "Unicorn" could convey around 36 operational flying machine. Mass petroleum stockpiling comprised of . Amid wartime, the ship's team totaled 1200. The ship conveyed a self-moved lighter under the back of the flight deck to enable unflyable flying machine to be exchanged between boats or to shore offices. This lighter was brought down flush with the upper shelter deck so an airplane could be moved onto it or an air ship could be lifted onto it once the lighter was in the water. 

"Unicorn" was equipped with four twin mounts for the 45-bore QF 4-inch Mk XVI double reason firearm. This mounting could lift from Ã¢ÂÂ10 to +80Ã¢Â°. The Mk XVI weapon shot around 12 high-touchy shells every moment at a gag speed of . Against surface targets it had a scope of and a most extreme roof of , however a successful enemy of air ship scope of significantly less. She was likewise outfitted with four fourfold mounts for the QF 2-pounder Mk VIII weapon ("pom-pom"). These firearm mounts could discourage to Ã¢ÂÂ10Ã¢Â° and lift to a limit of +80Ã¢Â°. The Mk VIII 2-pounder weapon shot a shell at a gag speed of to a separation of . The firearm's rate of flame was roughly 96Ã¢ÂÂ98 rounds every moment. Short proximity air resistance was given by twelve 20 mm Oerlikon autocannon, in two twin mounts and eight single ones. The Oerlikon discharged a shell at a gag speed of . It had a rate of flame of 465Ã¢ÂÂ480 rounds every moment and a most extreme scope of . 

The ship was furnished with two HACS (High Angle Control System) executives on her island and every "pom-pom" mount had its very own chief also. "Unicorn" was the principal ship to mount a Type 281B early-cautioning radar, and each HACS chief was fitted with a Type 285 gunnery radar. 

"Unicorn" was requested on 14 April 1939, and set down at Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 29 June. Her development was deferred a few times for higher need activities and she was not propelled until 20 November 1941. The ship was finished on 12 March 1943. So as to quicken the ship's fulfillment, the Admiralty chose in 1942 that she would not be furnished with her full suite of support and fix gear. Barring her deadly implement, "Unicorn" cost ÃÅ2,531,000. 

While stirring up, 818 and 824 Squadrons flew on board in April 1943. 818 Squadron had nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo aircraft and 824 Squadron had six. 887 Squadron, with nine Supermarine Seafire IIC warriors was likewise set out amid this time. In late May, "Unicorn" escorted Convoy MKF 15 to Gibraltar while conveying various Royal Air Force Bristol Beaufighters that she off-stacked there. She escorted the returning caravan back to the Clyde toward the beginning of June. Together with the plane carrying warship , the ship made a breadth towards the Norwegian coast as a component of Operation "Senator", a preoccupation for the Allied arrivals in Sicily toward the beginning of July. For this task, 887 Squadron was supplanted by 800 Squadron with Hawker Sea Hurricanes. 

"Unicorn" was doled out to Force V, a flotilla of British transporters, directed by Admiral Philip Vian, proposed to give air spread to Operation "Torrential slide", the Allied arrivals at Salerno. In anticipation of this mission, the ship landed every last bit of her Swordfish, with the exception of a little separation of three from 818 Squadron for self-protection, and the Sea Hurricanes of 800 Squadron. They were supplanted via Seafires of 809 and 897 Squadrons. Every one of the Seafire squadrons had 10 airplane, for an aggregate of 33. "Unicorn" joined the escort transporters of Force V in August at Gibraltar before they pushed ahead to the Central Mediterranean for serious preparing preceding the beginning of the land and/or water capable arriving on 9 September. 

The ship's Seafires flew 75 fights on the main day of tasks and 60 on 10 September, yet the Seafire was not appropriate to transporter arrivals in low wind conditions and many were harmed in landing mishaps. 44 forays were flown on 11 September and just 18 on 12 September, despite the fact that "Unicorn"s mechanics had figured out how to fix ten Seafires over the earlier night. The contender deficiency became so intense amid the activity that warriors from the bearers "Renowned" and , proposed to give far off spread against an endeavor by the Italian armada to meddle with the intrusion, arranged forward to "Unicorn" so as to give air spread over the arrivals. By 12 September, the circumstance had improved with the goal that 887 Squadron had the capacity to take off six Seafires to an impermanent runway aground. 

The ship came back to the UK on 20 September with a full heap of harmed Seafires, notwithstanding her own airplane, that were off-stacked at Glasgow to be fixed. A short time later, she was refitted by her manufacturers and reconfigured for her planned job as a flying machine fix dispatch. 

Toward the finish of December 1943, "Unicorn" joined "Renowned", the battlecruiser and the war vessels and , different fortifications for the Eastern Fleet. Just four Swordfish from 818 Squadron were conveyed on board as of now. The ship conveyed a relegation of air ship to Royal Navy Air Station Cochin, India, on 27 January 1944 preceding touching base at Trincomalee, Ceylon on 2 February. Notwithstanding her fix obligations, the ship was regularly utilized for deck-landing practice. She was given a concise refit in Bombay amid May. On 23 August, 818 Squadron was exchanged to and later disbanded. On 7 November, 817 Squadron flew on board to give against submarine security its Fairey Barracudas as "Unicorn" was requested to Durban, South Africa. There she was to be adjusted with isolated workshops and extra gear to suit American motors which utilized diverse screw strings and electrical fittings. 

That equivalent month, "Unicorn" was exchanged to the recently shaped BPF. She left Durban on 1 January 1945 and touched base at Colombo, Ceylon where she led deck-landing practice for pilots new to the BPF. The ship stacked 82 flying machine and 120 motors later in the month for transport to Australia, discharging the accessible supplies of the Eastern Fleet, and left for Sydney on 29 January. "Unicorn" touched base on 12 February and landed her put away flying machine. She cruised for Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, on 28 February to help the BPF's preparation before the opening phases of Operation "Ice sheet". The ship touched base at San Pedro Bay, Philippines on 27 March which was to fill in as the BPF's middle of the road recharging base while it upheld Operation "Icy mass". 

The BPF was entrusted to assault Japanese runways in the Sakishima Islands and Formosa previously and amid the beginning times of the intrusion of Okinawa. "Unicorn" was basically occupied with getting ready air ship for issue to the operational squadrons on board the armada transporters amid this time, instead of fix them, however she repaired, adjust or administration 105 air ship in MarchÃ¢ÂÂMay 1945. The ship cruised for Australia on 22 May and touched base in Sydney on 1 June. She cruised for Brisbane on 6 June to have her base cleaned at the Cairncross Dockyard and to stack greater substitution air ship. "Unicorn" touched base at Manus on 22 July to get ready for tasks off Japan. She was still there when Japan surrendered on 15 August. The ship started to ship air ship, gear and men back to Australia after the surrender, an undertaking which finished on 6 November, when she touched base at Sydney. "Unicorn" left for home in December 1945 and touched base in Plymouth in January 1946. She was decommissioned and put for possible later use. 

In 1949, "Unicorn" was reactivated for administration in the Far East, in help of the transporter . She cruised from HMNB Devonport on 22 September with a freight of Seafires and Fireflies. At the point when the Korean War broke out in June 1950, the ship was landing flying machine, gear and her upkeep faculty at RAF Sembawang, Singapore in arrangement to return home and afterward to hold. The Admiralty requested her to be utilized as a recharging transporter to ship substitution flying machine and supplies to the Royal Navy and Commonwealth plane carrying warships working in Korean waters. "Unicorn" left Singapore on 11 July and touched base at Sasebo, Japan on 20 July and exchanged seven Seafires and five Fireflies to "Triumph". In August, the ship carried the first Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment and the Headquarters of the 27th Brigade from Hong Kong to Pusan, touching base on 29 August. She conveyed supplies to Sasebo before coming back to Singapore to start a refit. 

"Unicorn" continued her obligations in December, conveying around 400 troops notwithstanding the typical flying machine, stores and hardware. She was utilized by pilots for deck-landing practice on the way. In March, she carried the Gloster Meteor stream warriors of No. 77 Squadron RAAF to Iwakuni, Japan. The ship stayed there for the following three months so she could be utilized as a convenience deliver. A short time later, "Unicorn" continued her job as a ship transporter. While traveling the Shimonoseki Strait on 2 October, she demolished the overhead power links extending among Honshu and Kyushu as they were hanging lower than typical because of an overwhelming snowfall. On 21 November, "Unicorn" and the transporter traded teams at Singapore and the ship started a refit in the blink of an eye a short time later. After her refit was finished on 20 January 1952, she came back to her ship obligations. In April, she was "embraced" by the Middlesex Regiment (perhaps one of just three boats to be respected by an Army regiment). Amid activities by in July, the ship went about as an extra flight deck to take into account harmed air ship to arrive without upsetting the strike tasks. She touched base back at Singapore on 27 July to stack greater substitution flying machine, including Meteors, and cruised on 9 August for Japan. Amid September, "Unicorn" obtained four of "Ocean"s Hawker Sea Fury warriors to fly battle air watches over the armada while the last ship directed strike tasks. She was docked for upkeep in October, and set out the First Sea Lord, Admiral Rhoderick McGrigor and the Commander-in-Chief, Far East Station for a voyage through Commonwealth powers in Japan. At a certain point, "Unicorn" turned into the main plane carrying warship to direct a shore siege amid wartime when she connected North Korean coastwatchers at Chopekki Point. 

The ship came back to Singapore for another refit on 15 December and did not leave Singapore until 17 July 1953. On 26 July, on the way for Japan, "Unicorn" got a trouble call from , saying that she was enduring an onslaught by privateers. The transporter shut on the tanker's situation at rapid and the privateers surrendered their prize when "Unicorn" orbited the vessel with all weapons bearing at not exactly . The Korean Armistice Agreement happened the next day, yet the ship went with "Sea" on two watches on 30 July and 25Ã¢ÂÂ29 August to screen North Korean consistence with the terms of the peace negotiation. She cruised for home on 15 October and touched base at Devonport on 17 November, where she came back to hold. 

In 1951, "Unicorn" was considered for modernisation to make her fit for working present day, heavier stream air ship. This would have required fitting of a steam sling, fortifying her flight deck to deal with heavier air ship and moving and amplifying her forward lift to prepare for the new launch and bigger flying machine. Another crane would likewise have been important to deal with the heavier air ship. The Director of Naval Construction proposed to join both of her sheds into a solitary one to dispose of issues with overhang tallness, however this was rejected as a result of the inordinate expense. This recreation would have started in July 1954, however the whole plan was dropped in November 1952 on the grounds that giving existing transporters calculated flight decks was substantially more essential. 

"Unicorn" was redesignated as a Ferry Carrier in June 1953. The ship was decreased to broadened hold in March 1957 and put on the transfer list in 1958. "Unicorn" was sold for scrap in June 1959 and landed at Dalmuir on 15 June to start the procedure. Her structure was separated at Troon in 1960.
