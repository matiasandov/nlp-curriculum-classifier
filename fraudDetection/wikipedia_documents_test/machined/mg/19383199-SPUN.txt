HjÄÅki and Bil 

In Norse folklore, HjÄÅki (Old Norse, potentially signifying "the one coming back to wellbeing") and Bil (Old Norse, truly "moment") are a sibling and sister pair of kids who pursue the exemplified moon, MÄÄni, over the sky. Both HjÄÅki and Bil are exclusively verified in the "Composition Edda", written in the thirteenth century by Snorri Sturluson. Academic hypotheses that encompass the two concern their inclination, their job as potential embodiments of the cavities on the moon or its stages, and their connection to later old stories in Germanic Europe. Bil has been related to the Bilwis, a farming related assume that is habitually validated in the legends of German-talking territories of Europe. 

In section 11 of the "Exposition Edda" book "Gylfaginning", the enthroned figure of High expresses that two youngsters by the names of HjÄÅki and Bil were fathered by ViÄÂ°finnr. Once while the two were strolling from the well Byrgir (Old Norse "Hider of Something") Ã¢ÂÂ them two carrying on their shoulders the shaft Simul (Old Norse, potentially signifying "interminable") that held the bucket SÄÅg between them Ã¢ÂÂ MÄÄni took them from the earth, and they presently pursue MÄÄni in the sky, "as can be seen from the earth". 

HjÄÅki is generally unmentioned, however Bil gets acknowledgment. In part 35 of "Gylfaginning", toward the finish of a posting of various different goddesses in Norse folklore, both SÄÅl (the embodied sun) and Bil are recorded together as goddesses "whose nature has just been depicted". Bil shows up twice more in the "Exposition Edda" book "SkÄÄldskaparmÄÄl". In section 75, Bil shows up inside another rundown of goddesses, and her name shows up in part 47 of every a kenning for "lady". 

As the two are generally unattested outside of Snorri's "Exposition Edda", recommendations have been made that HjÄÅki and Bil may have been of minor mythic importance, or that they were made up by and large by Snorri, while Anne Holtsmark (1945) sets that Snorri may have known or approached a now lost section source wherein HjÄÅki and Bil embodied the coming and going moon. Holtsmark further hypothesizes that Bil may have been a dÄÂ­s (a kind of female god). 

Researchers have guessed that HjÄÅki and Bil may speak to lunar action, including that they may speak to the periods of the moon or may speak to the cavities of the moon. nineteenth century researcher Jacob Grimm rejects the recommendation that HjÄÅki and Bil speak to the periods of the moon, and expresses that HjÄÅki and Bil rather speak to the cavities on the moon seen from the earth. Grimm says that the proof for this "is plain from the figure itself. No "change" of the moon could propose the picture of "two youngsters" with a "bucket threw over their shoulders". In addition, right up 'til today the Swedish individuals find in the "spots" of the moon two people conveying a major "pail on a shaft"." Grimm includes that: 

Grimm gives further precedents from Germanic legends until the season of his composition (the nineteenth century) and notes a potential association between the German word "wadel" (which means the full moon) and the colloquial work of the word for "brushwood, twigs tied up in a group, esp[ecially] fir-twigs, "wadeln" to tie up brushwood", and the act of removing wood in the full moon. Benjamin Thorpe concurs with the hypothesis of HjÄÅki and Bil as the represented states of moon cavities. 

Rudolf Simek states that the indefinite quality of the names of the articles in the story of HjÄÅki and Bil may show that Snorri got them from a folktale, and that the type of the story of the Man in the Moon (highlighting a man with a post and a lady with a bushel) is additionally found in present day old stories in Scandinavia, England, and Northern Germany. 

In both the story HjÄÅki and Bil found in the Icelandic "Writing Edda" and the English nursery rhyme "Jack and Jill", two kids, one male and one female, get a bucket of water, and the sets have names that have been seen as phonetically comparative. These components have brought about speculations associating the two, and the idea has had some impact, showing up in textbooks for kids from the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. A customary type of the rhyme peruses: 

A figure by the name of "Bilwis" is authenticated in different pieces of German-speaking Europe beginning in the thirteenth century. Researcher Leander Petzoldt composes that the figure appears to originate from the goddess and after some time saw numerous changes, later building up "an elfin, shrunken perspective and the capacity to handicap individuals or dairy cattle with the shot of a bolt, (for example, in Wolfram von Eschenbach's thirteenth century lyric "Willehalm"). Petzoldt further reviews the advancement of the figure: 

Over the span of the thirteenth century, the Bilwis is less and less much of the time treated as the exemplification of an extraordinary power however turns out to be progressively distinguished as a malignant individual, a witch. Still later, with the ascent of the witch mistreatment toward the finish of the Middle Ages, the Bilwis was trashed; she turns into a manifestation of the fallen angel for the witch and alchemist. A last improvement has occurred since the sixteenth century, particularly in upper east Germany, the Bilwis has been imagined as a grain soul bringing riches; yet this most recent appearance of the Bilwis has its unsafe side, the Bilwis-shaper, who is accused for the unexplained examples that are framed among the lines of standing grain. The shaper is a magician or witch that chops down the corn with sickles that are secured to its feet. He is named a basically pernicious Corn Spirit. In this manner, the Bilwis is exceedingly polymorphous, taking on numerous appearances and significance in all German-talking regions all through the Middle Ages. The Bilwis is one of the weirdest and most secretive creatures in all old stories; its shifting structures mirror the worries of a ranch culture, and it serves to clarify the shocking appearance of turned-down columns of plants in cornfields. 

The town of Bilsby in Lincolnshire, England (from which the English surname "Charging" infers) has been proposed as having been named after Bil.
