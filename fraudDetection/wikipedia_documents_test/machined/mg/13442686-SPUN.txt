As 30% of the updating cost must be paid by the network club, a few gathering pledges exercises were done for the redevelopment. These exercises, which included music shows, golf competitions and cyclethons, raised a sum of S$6 million. The old club building was devastated in 1997 and development of the Marine Parade Community Building started that year. SAL Construction was the undertaking's principle temporary worker. Worked at an expense of S$30 million, the new structure was finished in January 2000, and was available to the general population on 6 March 2000.

The library is Singapore's second-most seasoned open library and the just a single based on recovered land. It began moving in stages to the network working in April 2000, and was formally opened by Goh Chok Tong on 28 May 2000.

The Necessary Stage's 672-square meter (7,467 square feet) premises at the storm cellar of the network building was around multiple times the span of its old premises at Cairnhill Arts Center, which did not have a legitimate performance center space for creations.

Sited neighboring Housing and Development Board loft squares of the Marine Parade Housing Estate, the Marine Parade Community Building could be viewed as an endeavor to connect with the more extensive network. The exercises of the network building were wanted to cover and to blend, as a one-stop goal for the whole family.

The structure was planned by a nearby compositional firm, William Lim Associates, which embraced a postmodern pluralist approach, communicated through a variety of materials and structures. 

The people group building is clad in a tremendous divider wall painting, an authorized gem by Thai draftsman Surachai Yeamsiri.

A board of global judges picked the triumphant plan from an aggregate of 66 passages put together by specialists, modelers and creators from all over Southeast Asia, including 40 sections from Singapore. Driven by nearby workmanship history specialist T. K. Sabapathy, the board felt that the triumphant passage best mirrored the challenge's topics of dynamism, collaboration, combination and congruity. The painting was introduced on the bended veneer of the network working at an expense of S$50,000. 

The library square is prevalently clad in glass, fitted with level balances, on its facade with the principle street. The in the open air cafÄÅ¡ had a road facade and was spread into the common forecourt. The top of the network building looks like the leaves of a palm tree, and covers the network club's housetop ball court.
