A container audit of the book for the "Los Angeles Times", Phil Freshman remarked, "Utilizing hard rationale and popping humor, a trio of Canadian lab scientists fittingly empties Transcendental Meditation; they spotlight transparencies in its cases and caution of its inert dangers to those in unbalanced psychological wellness." In his book "Discerning Mysticism", writer John Horgan remarks that despite the fact that Persinger says he's nonpartisan toward religious conviction, he's more one-sided than different neurotheologians and that his two books "cast religious conviction and otherworldly practices in a psychopathological light".
