"The Obvious Child" is a melody recorded by American artist musician Paul Simon. It was the lead single from his eighth studio collection, "The Rhythm of the Saints" (1990), discharged by Warner Bros. Records. Composed by Simon, its verses investigate mortality and maturing. The tune is joined by an exhibition from Brazilian drumming aggregate Olodum in a live account. 

The single, discharged in September 1990, was monetarily fruitful, performing great on diagrams around the world. In the United States, it was essentially fruitful on the Album Rock Tracks graph, where it crested at number 21. Outside the US, "The Obvious Child" was a best 15 hit in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The melody got very positive audits upon its discharge. Simon advanced the tune nearby Olodum in an exhibition on "Saturday Night Live". The tune likewise impacted mainstream culture; it is the namesake of the 2014 film "Clear Child". 

The mood tracks are performed by Grupo Cultural Olodum, a drumming aggregate ("bloco afro") coordinated by "Neguinho do Samba" (Alves de Souza) and furthermore marked to Warner Bros. It, in the same way as other tunes on "The Rhythm of the Saints", was recorded live in the avenues of Pelourinho Square of Salvador, Brazil in February 1988. Receivers were dangled from windows or on utility poles to catch the exhibitions. As per Simon, "Several individuals accumulated. It was an astounding day Ã¢ÂÂ an astonishing account understanding." The vocal track was recorded at the Hit Factory in New York City. 

The tune's drum acquaintance is obliged with "Madagascar", a tune by Olodum from their 1987 LP "Egito MadagÄÄscar". Author Steve Sullivan composes that the figure is a "standard gadget" for the gathering, who likewise utilize curtailed variants of it somewhere else on the collection: "Salvador Nao Inerte" and "Vinheta Cuba-Brasil". Following this, the tune breaks into an instrumental piece that, as indicated by Stephen Holden of "The New York Times", echoes the Silhouettes' 1957 doo-wop hit, "Find a new Line of work". Holden likewise contrasted the melody's decision with another doo-wop tune, The Charts' "Desirie" (1957). 

The tune's verses specifically identify with a dread of maturing and abandoning the "strength of youth," as per Sullivan. Holden thought of it as an account of an everyman considering the vulnerability of life while exploring his secondary school yearbook. "Moving Stone" John Mcalley too discovered it an everyman doing combating the way that his "days have turned out to be characterized by their restrictions and hounded normality." For "The Rhythm of the Saints", Simon was roused by artist Derek Walcott, and would put together first-draft verses with respect to his ballads. Simon endeavored to coordinate the musical nature of the sythesis with his verses, regardless of whether that implied a verse was good for nothing or not. A verse identifying with "the cross is in the ballpark," for instance, has no significance; Simon stated, "I observed [it] to be a wonderful musical expression against the drums." There have been interviews, in any case, that have cited him as clarifying it simply hit him when he sang it, that we as a whole have a "difficulty to manage", and "its in the ballpark." Meaning whatever we are battling with, the appropriate response/goals is adjacent/open.
