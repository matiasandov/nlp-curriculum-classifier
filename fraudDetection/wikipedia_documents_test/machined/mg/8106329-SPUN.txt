Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad 

The Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad , naturally known as the "Mama and Pa", was an American short-line railroad among York and Hanover, Pennsylvania, once in the past working traveler and cargo prepares on its unique line among York and Baltimore, Maryland, from 1901 until the 1950s. The Ma and Pa was famous with railfans during the 1940s for its old fashioned hardware and bending, beautiful option to proceed through the slopes of country Maryland and Pennsylvania. Mirroring its root as the unintended result of the merger of two nineteenth century restricted check railroads, the wandering Ma and Pa line took to interface Baltimore and York, in spite of the fact that the two urban areas are just separated in a straight line. 

Traveler administration was ended on August 31, 1954, and the segment from Baltimore to Whiteford, Maryland (only south of the Mason-Dixon line separating the Pennsylvania-Maryland fringe) was deserted in June 1958. The vast majority of the staying unique railroad line was relinquished by 1984. The Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad procured a previous Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) branch line among York and Hanover during the 1980s, presently worked by a successor partnership, York Railway. 

The Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad was framed from two before nineteenth century 3Ã¢Â ft (914Ã¢Â mm) slender check railroads: the Baltimore and Delta Railway, later the Baltimore and Lehigh Railway, and the York and Peach Bottom Railway, later the York Southern Railroad. Development of the Baltimore and Delta Railway began in 1881, and traveler prepares among Baltimore and Towson, Maryland started on April 17, 1882. Soon thereafter the organization was converged into the Maryland Central Railroad. The line was stretched out northward to Bel Air, Maryland on June 21, 1883, and the next January, the line was finished to Delta, Pennsylvania. 

In Pennsylvania, the Peach Bottom Railway was joined in 1871. The railroad's Middle Division laid thin measure track among York and Red Lion by August 1874 and finished its line southward to Delta in 1876. It went bankrupt in 1881 and was redesigned as the York and Peach Bottom Railway (Y&PB) in 1882. The Y&PB converged with the Maryland Central Railway (successor to the Maryland Central RR) in 1891, turning into the Baltimore and Lehigh, and the new organization worked prepares on the joined track among York and Baltimore. 

The two railways battled with light cargo traffic and budgetary challenges during the 1890s. As a result of their thin check development, the Baltimore and Lehigh Railway and York Southern Railroad couldn't trade cargo autos with different lines. The two organizations at last changed over to standard check among 1898Ã¢ÂÂ1900 and in this manner converged to shape the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad on February 12, 1901. The outcome was the meandering, "Mama and Pa" course among Baltimore and York, contrasted with the contending Pennsylvania Railroad's more straightforward separation between the two urban communities on its Northern Central Railway division. The finished line had levels up to 2.3Ã¢Â percent and 55Ã¢Â sharp bends of (most mainline railways only here and there surpass sixÃ¢Â degrees, and even the previous Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad's mainline through the Rocky Mountains does not surpass 12Ã¢Â degrees). 

Following the merger, the Ma and Pa worked through traveler and cargo prepares among York and Baltimore, just as nearby trains at each stopping point, pulling mail and express, slate, marble, anthracite coal, timber, furniture, and rural items to showcase. Especially on the Pennsylvania Division (DeltaÃ¢ÂÂYork), slate from Delta and produced merchandise from Red Lion and York were pillars of the railroad's outbound cargo traffic in the early years. On the Maryland Division, inbound anthracite coal conveyances represented a critical volume of carloadings, alongside milk from the numerous dairy cultivates in the region. One early morning train from Fallston boarded more than 1,100Ã¢Â gallons of milk every day and was named the "Smooth Way". The line was gainful and traffic volume was with the end goal that extra trains were vital. The Ma and Pa obtained two 0-6-0 Baldwin switchers in 1913, #29 and #30 "(imagined)", called "gems of motors, in certain regards the most alluring the street had", by essayist George Hilton in "The Ma and Pa Ã¢ÂÂ A History of the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad". The following year, three 2-8-0 "Combinations" by Baldwin were added to the program, giving all the more dominant trains to the BaltimoreÃ¢ÂÂYork through cargo. At its pinnacle, the railroad had 160Ã¢Â pieces of moving stock, with 573Ã¢Â employees. 

With expanding rivalry from trucks and autos during the 1920s, traveler volume started to decrease alongside not as much as carload cargo, for example, milk from the numerous dairy cultivates along the Ma and Pa's peaceful course. The Ma and Pa substituted increasingly practical, self-impelled gas-electric traveler autos for steam-fueled traveler prepares in 1927Ã¢ÂÂ1928. Carload cargo volume expanded during the 1920s, be that as it may, as more businesses situated along the line, and profit were sufficient for the organization to announce profits in 1930 and 1931. The Ma and Pa's relative thriving finished with the monetary downturn amid the Great Depression, which cut the railroad's gross incomes considerably from 1932 to 1935. 

In the mid-1930s, the Ma and Pa turned into an early most loved of railfans, pulled in by its uneven, bending line through provincial Maryland and Pennsylvania. The railroad offered a few mainstream fan journeys pulled by its older steam trains. 

Following the finish of World War II, the Ma and Pa obtained four diesel trains for progressively conservative tasks, however traffic declined essentially. At the point when the Ma and Pa's mail contract was dropped by the U.S. postal administration, the railroad stopped all traveler administration on August 31, 1954. One individual on the last traveler train reviewed that numerous riders originated from as far away as Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C., to take an interest in the notable occasion, alongside individuals from the National Railway Historical Society. The pleasant line's last steam motor dropped its flame for the last time on November 29, 1956. 

The absence of traffic on the railroad's BaltimoreÃ¢ÂÂWhiteford Maryland Division during the 1950s was especially intense. One of the last real shipments to happen was Indiana limestone for the development of Baltimore's Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in 1956. The BaltimoreÃ¢ÂÂWhiteford fragment in Maryland was at long last deserted inside and out on June 11, 1958, leaving just the stone projections where the tracks crossed York Road in Towson on a steel brace connect. A nearby gathering of history buffs set a bronze plaque on the west projection in 1999, celebrating the withdrew railroad's place in Towson history. 

During the 1960s, the Ma and Pa Railroad kept on requesting business along its line for its remaining WhitefordÃ¢ÂÂYork section, on the whole in Pennsylvania. In 1964, it included a siding long close Red Lion to serve another stogie box plant. In 1971, the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad was obtained by Emons Industries. Essentially pulling slate from a quarry at Delta, and furniture from a manufacturing plant in Red Lion, the Ma and Pa's Pennsylvania Division proceeded in activity until June 14, 1978, when the line was additionally diminished to the YorkÃ¢ÂÂRed Lion segment. The Red Lion cargo station was shut on November 1, 1980; when the Pennsylvania town's furnishings producer covered its entryways in 1984, the Red Lion area of the railroad was likewise relinquished. 

The Emons-controlled Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad procured of a previous PRR branch line among York and Hanover, Pennsylvania during the 1980s. In December 1999, Emons consolidated its M&P backup with another territory short-line, Yorkrail, shaping the York Railway. In 2002, Genesee and Wyoming oversaw the York Railway, including the previous M&P Railroad trackage between YorkÃ¢ÂÂHanover. The York Railway as of now serves 40Ã¢Â online rail clients and interfaces with the Norfolk Southern and CSX rail lines. 

A little, part of the first railroad line still exists among Laurel and Muddy Creek Forks in York County, Pennsylvania, kept up by the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad Preservation Society. Established by devotees and previous representatives in 1986, the gathering has reestablished the Muddy Creek Forks station and furthermore has a little accumulation of moving stock there. The safeguarded Red Lion station is presently an exhibition hall worked by the Red Lion Area Historical Society. Another segment of the Ma and Pa's old option to proceed was changed over in 1998 to a rail trail in Harford County, Maryland. Presently long, the Ma and Pa Heritage Trail through Bel Air is utilized for climbing and biking. 

In Baltimore, close Pennsylvania Station, Ma and Pa track leftovers and the old roundhouse, cargo shed, and yard shed are as yet surviving. The Baltimore Streetcar Museum currently works here. 

In York County, the Muddy Creek Bridge, Delta Trestle Bridge, and Scott Creek Bridge-North were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.
