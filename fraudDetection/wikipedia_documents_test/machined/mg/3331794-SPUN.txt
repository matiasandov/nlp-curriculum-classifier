His first band, Nation of Ulysses, which discharged its first record in 1990, was exceedingly compelling in the punk scene yet broke down in 1992. After a fleeting side-venture called Cupid Car Club, Svenonius shaped The Make-Up in 1995, who joined carport shake, soul, and freedom religious philosophy to make another kind they named "Gospel Yeh-Yeh". The Make-Up disbanded right off the bat in 2001, and after a year, Svenonius framed the band Weird War, who were likewise referred to quickly as the Scene Creamers. At present, Svenonius is pioneer of the band Chain and the Gang. 

Svenonius' performance work incorporates the 2001 collection "Play Power" under the anecdotal nom de plume David Candy, the book "The Psychic Soviet", and as host of "Delicate Focus" on VBS.tv. Svenonius' tasks and compositions have all mutual an enemy of dictator Marxist political perspective. 

Svenonius' first melodic gathering was Nation of Ulysses. The band shaped in spring 1988, at first made out of four individuals, Svenonius on vocals and trumpet, Steve Kroner on guitar, Steve Gamboa on bass, and James Canty on drums, and referred to just as "Ulysses". In late 1989, Tim Green joined the band as a second guitarist and the band was renamed to "Country of Ulysses". The Nation of Ulysses portrayed themselves not as a stone and move bunch in the customary sense, yet "as an ideological group" and as "a yell of withdrawal". Clarifying their purpose, Svenonius said "it's essentially another country underground for the seized youth province. It's tied in with crushing the old structure, the stone monument of shake and roll". 

In 1990, preceding the band discharged any official collections, Svenonius was included as teenager arranged "Cheeky Magazine's" first "Sassiest Boy in America." He was met in the magazine's October issue, enumerating the band's sound and political inspirations. Svenonius expressed that the Nation of Ulysses' goal was "to make a space of freedom where anythingÃ¢ÂÂs conceivable". He scrutinized "conventional shake and-move" bunches as a "degenerate medium." The challenge was purportedly an "across the nation scan for the absolute best beau material a young lady could request", and Svenonius was among 150 sections. 

Country of Ulysses was known for their incredibly physical exhibitions, amid which Svenonius reviews numerous wounds, including breaking his arm, his leg, and his skull on various events. Group of onlookers individuals were likewise harmed amid certain exhibitions. 

The gathering disbanded in the fall of 1992 having neglected to finish their third collection (the completed tracks were later discharged as "The Embassy Tapes" in 2000). In a later meeting, Svenonius clarified the explanation behind the split: "Country of Ulysses separated in light of the fact that the age changed with the coming of computerized music and the Nirvana blast. We were looked with what's presently known as outside the box shake, a kind of vacuous structure. We needed to decide our best course of action and this [the framing of The Make-Up] is it". 

The Make-Up framed in 1995, comprising of Svenonius, Canty, and Gamboa from Nation of Ulysses, and with the expansion of Michelle Mae on low register guitar. The Make-Up were participated in late 1999 by a fifth part, Alex Minoff, who played guitar with the gathering until their disintegration in 2001. In the band's five years of movement, they discharged four studio collections, two live collections, an after death accumulation of singles and B-sides, and various 12-inch singles and parts. The Make-Up consolidated carport shake, soul, and so called "freedom religious philosophy" to make another type they called "Gospel Yeh-Yeh". The Make-Up were exceptionally affected by bubblegum music, especially the French assortment called YÄÅ¡-yÄÅ¡ music. 

As the Make-Up's frontman and mouthpiece, Ian Svenonius regularly contextualized the band's music regarding bigger socio-political subjects, commonly portraying the band and its gospel mentality in Marxist and communist terms, in restriction of what he saw as the industrialist, middle class, machismo worldview of shake and roll. The band's antipathy for American culture was communicated through their so called melodic type "Gospel Yeh-Yeh," a conviction framework through which they supported to their gathering of people to "get theirs" and to "off the pigs in the entirety of their structures". The Make-Up expected to make off the cuff exhibitions to re-invigorate what they saw as the stale, dull and formal custom of shake and roll. Appropriating gospel music's utilization of the gather as a "fifth part," the Make-Up fused group of onlookers cooperation through call and reaction vocals, expressive "discourse" methods, and devastation of the fourth divider by physical transgression. 

The Make-Up broke down in 2000, supposedly "because of the expansive number of counter-pack duplicate gatherings which had appropriated their look and sound and connected it to a vacuous and counter-progressive structures". Between undertakings, Svenonius discharged a performance collection under the nom de plume Candy. 

After The Make-Up disbanded, Svenonius framed the gathering Weird War in 2001, joined by Make-Up individuals Michelle Mae and Alex Minoff.

These partners before long left to seek after different undertakings, and the band quickly changed its name to The Scene Creamers, with Svenonius on vocals, Michelle Mae on bass, Alex Minoff on guitar, and Blake Brunner on drums.

In the wake of being compromised with a legitimate suit for the name Scene Creamers by a French spray painting craftsman group of a similar name, the band returned to the name Weird War. From that point forward, as its participation has turned out to be static, with the expansion of Argentine Sebastian Thomson on drums, its plan has turned out to be progressively enormous. Peculiar War asserts that they are "the sole response to the publicity based careerism, void formalism and vacuity which has tainted what was previously a really imaginative underground shake 'n' move scene".

The "Directions" that prelude the book express that it "should clear up a significant part of the perplexity in regards to occasions of the most recent thousand years Ã¢ÂÂ imaginative, geo-political, philosophical, et al." and urges the peruser to "allude to the book in the event of moral predicaments, contentions, and social quarrels". The composition tends to points, for example, the rising of the DJ as a "star," the "infinite discouragement" that pursued the thrashing of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics exposed War, and the status of shake and move as a religion.
