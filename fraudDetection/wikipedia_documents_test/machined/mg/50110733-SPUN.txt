For "Kawan Bergeloet", Soeman wrote in Indonesian, a language dependent on formal Malay.

Rosidi considers a portion of the accounts' comic episodes to be excessively confused, yet ascribes this to Soeman's past movement in the analyst class. The Dutch researcher of Indonesian writing A. Teeuw finds the portrayals in "Kawan Bergeloet" to be "well-watched and sensibly depicted" and Soeman's most fascinating commitment to Indonesian writing.
