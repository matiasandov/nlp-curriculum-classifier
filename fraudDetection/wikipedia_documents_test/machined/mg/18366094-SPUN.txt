The Battle of the Somme was the regiment's first real commitment, and amid an attack that kept going roughly 30 minutes the regiment was everything except cleared out. Obtained in 1921 by the general population of Newfoundland, the dedication site is the biggest regiment commemoration on the Western Front, and the biggest zone of the Somme war zone that has been protected.

Authoritatively opened by British Field Marshal Earl Haig in 1925, the dedication site is one of just two National Historic Sites of Canada situated outside of Canada. (The other is the Canadian National Vimy Memorial). The remembrance site and experience of the Newfoundland Regiment at Beaumont-Hamel has come to speak to the Newfoundland First World War understanding. Subsequently, it has turned into a Newfoundland image of penance and a wellspring of personality. 

Amid the First World War, Newfoundland was a to a great extent country Dominion of the British Empire with a populace of 240,000, and not yet part of Canada. The flare-up of the First World War in 1914 drove the Government of Newfoundland to enlist a power for administration with the British Army. Despite the fact that the island had not had any formal military association since 1870, enough men before long volunteered that a whole unit was shaped, and later kept up all through the war. The regiment prepared at different areas in the United Kingdom and expanded from an underlying unforeseen of 500 men to full force quality of 1,000 men, before being sent. After a time of acclimatization in Egypt, the regiment was conveyed at Suvla Bay on the Gallipoli landmass with the 29th British Division in help of the Gallipoli Campaign. With the end of the Gallipoli Campaign the regiment spent a brief period recovering before being exchanged toward the Western Front in March 1916. 

In France, the regiment recaptured brigade quality in anticipation of the Battle of the Somme. The regiment, still with the 29th British Division, went into the line in April 1916 at Beaumont-Hamel. Beaumont-Hamel was arranged close to the northern end of the 45-kilometer front being struck by the joint French and British power. The assault, initially booked for 29 June 1916 was deferred by two days to July 1, 1916, halfway because of severe climate, somewhat to permit more opportunity for the big guns planning. The 29th British Division, with its three infantry detachments confronted safeguards kept an eye on by experienced troops of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment of the 26th (Wurttemberg) Reserve Division. The 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment had been engaged with the intrusion of France in August 1914 and had been keeping an eye on the Beaumont-Hamel segment of the line for about 20 months preceding the fight. The German troops were spending a lot of their time preparing as well as strengthening their position, including the development of various profound burrows and somewhere around two passages. 

The infantry strike by the 29th British Division on 1 July 1916 was to be gone before ten minutes sooner by a mine blast under the intensely sustained Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. The blast of the 18,000 kilogram (40,000Ã¢Â lb) Hawthorn Mine underneath the German lines effectively decimated a noteworthy foe solid indicate yet in addition served alert the German powers to the up and coming assault. Following the blast, troops of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment promptly sent from their holes into the terminating line, notwithstanding keeping the British from assuming responsibility for the subsequent pit as they had arranged. At the point when the strike at long last started, the troops from the 86th and 87th Brigade of the 29th British Division were immediately ceased. Except for the first Battalion of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers on the correct flank, the underlying attack foundered in No Man's Land at, or shy of, the German spiked metal. At divisional central command, Major-General Beauvoir De Lisle and his staff were attempting to unwind the various and befuddling messages returning from perception posts, contact flying machine and the two driving units. There were signs that a few troops had broken into and gone past the German first line. With an end goal to abuse the apparent break in the German line he requested the 88th Brigade, which was for possible later use, to send forward two forces to help assault. 

At 8:45Ã¢Â a.m. the Newfoundland Regiment and first Battalion of the Essex Regiment got requests to push ahead. The Newfoundland Regiment was arranged at St. John's Road, a help channel behind the British forward line and far out of the adversary. Development forward through the correspondence channels was unrealistic in light of the fact that they were clogged with dead and injured men and under shell shoot. Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Lovell Hadow, the force authority, chose to move promptly into assault arrangement and advance over the surface, which included first exploring through the British spiked metal barriers. As they breasted the horizon behind the British first line, they were adequately the main troops proceeding onward the front line and obviously unmistakable to the German protectors. Exposed to the full power of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment, a large portion of the Newfoundland Regiment who had begun forward were dead, biting the dust or injured inside 15 to 20 minutes of leaving St. John's Road channel. Most came to no more remote than the Danger Tree, a skeleton of a tree that lay in No Man's Land that was being used as a milestone. So far as can be found out, 22 officers and 758 different positions were legitimately engaged with the development. Of these, every one of the officers and marginally under 658 different positions progressed toward becoming setbacks. Of the 780 men who went ahead just around 110 endure solid, of whom just 68 were accessible for move call the next day. In every practical sense the Newfoundland Regiment had been cleared out, the unit in general having endured a loss rate of roughly 80%. The main unit to endure more prominent losses amid the assault was the tenth Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, assaulting west of Fricourt town. 

After July 1916, the Beaumont-Hamel front remained moderately calm while the Battle of the Somme proceeded toward the south. In the last demonstration in the Somme Offensive, Beaumont-Hamel was ambushed by the 51st (Highland) Division on 13 November 1916 on the opening of the Battle of the Ancre. Inside two days, all the 29th Division goals of 1 July had been brought with a considerable number of German detainees. The territory of the commemoration site at that point turned into a back zone with troops stopped in the previous German holes and a camp was built up in the region of the present Y Ravine Cemetery. With the German withdrawal in March 1917 to the Hindenburg Line, around 30 kilometers from Beaumont-Hamel, the war zone rescue parties moved in, numerous burrows were stopped and starting endeavors were most likely made to reestablish a portion of the land to farming. Be that as it may, in March 1918, the German Spring Offensive was here kept an eye on the very same fight lines as previously. Until the Battle of Amiens and the German withdrawal in late August 1918, the heroes stood up to one another over a similar ground, despite the fact that the main activities were those of routine bleeding edge channel strikes, watches and mounted guns badgering. 

In 1921, Newfoundland obtained the ground over which the Newfoundland Regiment made its fruitless assault amid the principal day of the Battle of the Somme. A significant part of the credit for the foundation of the commemoration site is given to Lieutenant Colonel Tom Nangle, the previous Roman Catholic Priest of the regiment.

Sixteen commemoration structures were submitted to Nangle for survey. He suggested that the legislature acknowledge British stone carver Basil GottoÃ¢ÂÂs plan to raise five indistinguishable caribou statues in memory of the regiment. Gotto was at that point surely understood in Newfoundland as he had been recently authorized to execute the statue of the "Battling Newfoundlander" situated in Bowring Park. The scene designer who planned the locales and administered their development, was Rudolph Cochius, a local of the Netherlands living in St. John's. It was chosen to plant a considerable lot of NewfoundlandÃ¢ÂÂs local tree species, for example, spruce, dogberry and juniper, along the limits of the site.

The ground initially given by the collective of Beaumont-Hamel to the Veterans of the 51st Division was observed to be temperamental due to the numerous burrows underneath it. Lieutenant Colonel Nangle offered an area sitting above Y Ravine inside the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial site. The Y gorge had been the scene of furious battling for the division on 13 November 1916. The chose stone worker for the 51st Division Monument was George Henry Paulin. The base of the landmark comprises of unpleasant squares of Rubislaw stone which were created by Garden and Co. in Aberdeen, Scotland, and are gathered in a pyramid structure. Organization Sergeant Major Bob Rowan of the Glasgow Highlanders was utilized as the model for the kilted figure on the remembrance. The figure faces east towards the town of Beaumont-Hamel.
