Arranged inside an area favoring tropical cyclogenesis, the framework merged as it followed commonly westbound. Late on OctoberÃ¢Â 25, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) grouped the low as a tropical sorrow. With poleward outpouring improving, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert the next day before starting warnings on Tropical Depression 22W. A few hours after the fact, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration doled out the tempest the neighborhood name "Paeng" as was inside their zone of obligation. Arranged south of a solid subtropical edge, the framework kept up a general west-northwest track. On OctoberÃ¢Â 27, the gloom fortified into a typhoon and was alloted the name "Cimaron" by the JMA.

The JTWC evaluated Cimaron to have been a more grounded framework, achieving its pinnacle force as a CategoryÃ¢Â 5-comparable super tropical storm with one-minute breezes of 260Ã¢Â km/h (160Ã¢Â mph). Be that as it may, satellite appraisals from forecasters inside the organization itself, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), and Dr. Karl Hoarau of Cergy-Pontoise University expressed Cimaron to have been a considerably more grounded framework. Utilizing the Dvorak procedure Ã¢ÂÂ a strategy for deciding a tropical violent wind's force dependent on satellite appearance Ã¢ÂÂ AFWA and SAB yielded a pinnacle estimation of T7.5, 285Ã¢Â km/h (180Ã¢Â mph), while progressed operational qualities from the JTWC crested at T7.8, 305Ã¢Â km/h (190Ã¢Â mph). Also, a forecaster at SAB noticed that the lower gauges were likely because of confinements on the Dvorak method originating from Cimaron's fast strengthening. The forecaster additionally noticed that a second sort of gauge gave a greatest estimation of T8.0, 315Ã¢Â km/h (195Ã¢Â mph), the most noteworthy rating on the scale. 

While at its pinnacle quality, Cimaron showed two little concentric eyewalls, isolated by a couple of kilometers.

While executing a tight clockwise circle, expanded breeze shear and entrainment of dry air before long caused Cimaron to significantly debilitate. With another edge getting to be set up over China, the debilitating framework obtained a general southwestward track. Cimaron debilitated to a tropical misery on NovemberÃ¢Â 4 and at last dispersed three days after the fact, simply off the shoreline of southeastern Vietnam.
