He was the main agent of the Belarusian parliament who casted a ballot against endorsement of the December 1991 understanding that broke down the Soviet Union and set up the Commonwealth of Independent States. Having procured a notoriety for being an expressive rival of debasement, Lukashenko was chosen in April 1993 to fill in as the between time administrator of the counter defilement board of the Belarusian parliament. In late 1993 he charged 70 senior government authorities, including the Supreme Soviet administrator Stanislav Shushkevich and PM Vyacheslav Kebich, of defilement including taking state assets for individual purposes.

In the late spring of 1996, representatives of the 199-part Belarusian parliament marked an appeal to impugn Lukashenko on charges of disregarding the Constitution.

On 25 November, it was reported that 70.5% of voters, of a 84% turnout, had affirmed the corrected constitution. The US and the EU, be that as it may, would not acknowledge the authenticity of the submission. 

After the choice, Lukashenko met another parliamentary gathering from those individuals from the parliament who were faithful to him. After somewhere in the range of ten and twelve agents pulled back their mark from the reprimand appeal, just around forty appointees of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Soviet was rejected by Lukashenko. In any case, global associations and numerous Western nations don't perceive the present parliament given the manner in which it was shaped. Toward the beginning of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended exchanging the Belarusian ruble, which prompted a breakdown in the estimation of the money. Lukashenko reacted by assuming responsibility for the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the whole bank authority and reprimanding the West for the free fall of the cash.

Belarus held another presidential decision on 9 September 2001. Under the first constitution, this race would have been held in 1999, however the 1996 submission expanded Lukashenko's expression for an extra two years. Lukashenko confronted Vladimir Goncharik and Sergei Gaidukevich in the race. Amid the battle, Lukashenko guaranteed to raise the principles of cultivating, social advantages and increment mechanical yield of Belarus. Lukashenko won in the first round with 75.65% of the vote. The Organization for Security and Co-activity in Europe (OSCE) said the procedure "neglected to fulfill global guidelines". "Jane's Intelligence Digest" induced that the cost of Russian help for Lukashenko in front of the 2001 presidential decision was the surrender of Minsk's power over its segment of the Yamal-Europe gas pipeline. After the outcomes were reported proclaiming Lukashenko the victor, Russia freely respected Lukashenko's re-appointment; the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, called Lukashenko and offered a message of congrats and backing.

This activity, alongside arms manages Iraq and Iran, incited Western governments to take a harder position against Lukashenko. The US was especially infuriated by the arms deals, and American political pioneers progressively started to allude to Belarus as "Europe's last autocracy". The EU was worried for the security of its gas supplies from Russia, which are channeled through Belarus, and took a functioning enthusiasm for Belarusian issues.

The leaders of each of the 25 EU nations proclaimed that the decision was "in a general sense imperfect". Interestingly, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs announced, "Some time before the decisions, the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights had pronounced that they [the elections] would be ill-conceived and it was quite one-sided in its discourses on their advancement and results, hence assuming an actuating job." Lukashenko later expressed that he had fixed the race results, yet against himself, so as to acquire a lion's share increasingly common of European nations. In spite of the fact that he had won 93.5% of the vote, he stated, he had guided the administration to declare an aftereffect of 86%.
