Soon after passing Bermuda, Nicole created persevering profound convection close to the middle, while Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit bridges demonstrated the capability of a warm center inside the framework. In spite of the fact that Nicole endeavored to get tropical attributes, solid upper-level breeze shear avoided the change. As the tempest quickened northeastward affected by a substantial extratropical tornado south of Nova Scotia, it quickly achieved pinnacle winds of 50Ã¢Â mph (85Ã¢Â km/h).
