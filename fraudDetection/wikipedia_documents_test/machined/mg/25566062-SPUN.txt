Framing out of a territory of low weight on 25 February, the antecedent to Emma gradually followed southward. Albeit characterized tropical, the structure of the framework spoke to that of a monsoonal storm. Be that as it may, low wind shear and well-created outpouring bit by bit enabled convection to create close to the focal point of course. As the framework moved toward the Pilbara coastline of Western Australia on 27 February, it heightened into a Category 1 twister and achieved top 10-minute continued breezes of 75Ã¢Â km/h (45Ã¢Â mph). In the wake of moving inland close Mardie, Emma debilitated to a tropical low however turned out to be exceedingly expansive; its overcast spread clouded the greater part of Western Australia.

Over the accompanying couple of days, a monsoonal trough created over the Timor Sea, prompting an improved probability of tropical violent wind development from the underlying low inside a few days. On 25 February, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology started checking the framework as a tropical low. The low followed gradually towards the south for the duration of the day and the focal point of course moved more distant south late on 26 February. At this point, the Bureau of Meteorology foreseen the low to form into a tropical typhoon and accomplish winds of 95Ã¢Â km/h (60Ã¢Â mph ) before moving over land in Western Australia. 

At an early stage 27 February, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) arranged the framework as a tropical gloom. Amid the day, a QuikSCAT pass uncovered an expansive low-level flow with the most elevated breezes situated around the fringe of the tempest, a normal for monsoonal frameworks. In spite of the fact that it was arranged inside a locale of low wind shear and underneath an anticyclone, convective action was for the most part present in the framework's expansive external groups. Soon thereafter, the Bureau of Meteorology overhauled the framework to a Category 1 violent wind on the Australian power scale and named it Emma. As of now, Emma was found generally 305Ã¢Â km (190Ã¢Â mi) north of Onslow, Western Australia. A few hours after the fact, the JTWC grouped Emma as Tropical Storm 15S after the improvement of convection close to the focal point of dissemination. 

The tempest kept on following southward in light of a solid mid to upper-level edge arranged over focal Australia. Emma accomplished its pinnacle wind speed of 75Ã¢Â km/h (45Ã¢Â mph ) late on 27 February as it neared landfall. Notwithstanding, the JTWC surveyed Emma to have been marginally more fragile, topping with winds of 65Ã¢Â km/h (40Ã¢Â mph ). The tempest kept up this power through its landfall from the get-go 28 February close Mardie along the Pilbara coastline. Soon after moving over land, the JTWC announced Emma extratropical and issued their last warning on the tempest. The Bureau of Meteorology, be that as it may, kept on observing the violent wind as it quickly followed over Western Australia. Over land, the tempest turned out to be abnormally huge, with external groups from the tempest covering the majority of Western Australia. Late on 28 February, the most reduced barometric weight in connection to Emma, 988 hPa (29.18ÃÂ inHg), was recorded at Meekatharra. The remainders of Emma persevered through a large portion of 1 March before the framework moved over the Great Australian Bight and disseminated. 

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology utilizes 10-minute supported breezes, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses one-minute continued breezes. The Bureau of Meteorology's pinnacle power for Emma was 75Ã¢Â km/h (45Ã¢Â mph) 10-minute continued, or 85Ã¢Â km/h (50Ã¢Â mph) one-minute supported. The JTWC's pinnacle force for Emma was 65Ã¢Â km/h (40Ã¢Â mph) one-minute continued, or 55Ã¢Â km/h (35Ã¢Â mph) 10-minute supported. 

In front of the tempest, oil and mining tasks in compromised locales were incidentally closed down. Officially experiencing the effects of Cyclones Clare and Daryl, occupants were cautioned about the probability of flooding because of the effectively immersed grounds. The Bureau of Meteorology likewise issued tropical violent wind admonitions for the majority of the Pilbara coastline on 28 February. That day, the Fire and Emergency Services of Australia issued a Yellow Alert for Point Samson, Roebourne, Wickham, Dampier, Karratha, and Mardie. Occupants in these zones were encouraged to clear whether fundamental and guarantee that all violent wind arrangements had been finished. Safe houses were likewise opened for inhabitants who looked for requirement for one. Schools all through the Pilbara district were additionally shut for a few days because of the tempest. 

Because of the low power of the tempest at landfall, practically zero breeze harm occurred from Emma. Ashore, continued breezes were recorded up to and blasts up to . A tempest flood of was recorded at Dampier at the same time, no harm came about because of it. Overwhelming downpours delivered by the tempest made moderate extreme flooding in Western Australia.

Close to the Yarraloola Station, the Robe River flooded its banks, immersing the territory and driving the departure of everybody in the property. In the Gascoyne area 30 steers suffocated after rising waters quickly surpassed a field. 

In the Murchison area, precipitation surpassing acquired the most exceedingly awful floods decades, immersing various ranches and causing generous rural misfortunes.

By 14 March, the stream had expanded to generally in spots regularly in width. These qualities denoted the biggest flood at any point recorded in the waterway's history. Authorities appropriated sandbags to manufacture transitory levee to ensure low-lying territories. The biggest activity occurred at Kalbarri, close to the mouth of the stream, where 60 firemen and 18 volunteers attempted to set up 9,000Ã¢Â sandbags. The Billabalong and Twinpeaks stations were likewise disconnected from encompassing territories after the Murchison River immersed the territory. A few stations in the region stayed submerged for over a month and ranchers mentioned dire help from the legislature to help reduce misfortunes. Beginning harm from the tempest was set at A$1Ã¢Â million ($706,580 USD). 

Rising waters from the Murchison River at long last started to subside on 17 March; nonetheless, it took half a month for the waterway to come back to its typical dimension. In spite of the fact that Emma had just minor impacts in Carnarvon, the town established an A$14Ã¢Â million ($10Ã¢Â million USD) flood insurance plan in the wake of the tempest. The arrangement would prompt the development of new levees in zones encompassing the town and keep rising waters inside Nicol Bay Flats. Furthermore, four areas of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be redesigned for comparable reasons. Because of the joined impacts of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold creation in Australia fell by 8 percent, bringing about income misfortunes of A$130Ã¢Â million.
