Illinois Route 120 

Illinois Route 120 (ILÃÂ 120) is a noteworthy eastÃ¢ÂÂwest state parkway in northeastern Illinois. It keeps running from U.S. Highway 14 close Woodstock to Illinois Route 131 in Waukegan. It ventures a separation of and is one of only a handful couple of streets that gives direct access from McHenry County to Interstate 94 (Tri-State Tollway) in Lake County. All through its length, it moves somewhere in the range of two and four paths as it goes through a setting that comprises of open provincial regions, just as bigger improvements and overwhelming blockage. 

Albeit little limit enhancements have been set aside a few minutes, a protracted two path area of street in the Grayslake region still can't seem to perceive any significant development. This key portion has been the subject of much postponement and discussion with respect to the more noteworthy traffic stream crosswise over north-focal Lake County. In October 2009, an uncommon committee endorsed a brought together vision for an improvement plan for the vast majority of the Lake County part of Illinois 120, which incorporates a since a long time ago examined detour around downtown Grayslake. 

Starting at its western end at a country unsignalized convergence with U.S. Highway 14 (Northwest Highway), ILÃÂ 120 begins as a two path street only west of the city of Woodstock. This segment is referred to as Washington Street as it heads in a southeast bearing and enters the external private neighborhoods of Woodstock. Around there, the street bends due east, crosses the Metra Union Pacific/Northwest Line tracks close to the station, at that point quickly travels north before turning yet again toward the northwest. Following doing as such, it passes a signalized crossing point with ILÃÂ 47 (Seminary Avenue/Eastwood Drive) before voyaging north of the McHenry County Fairgrounds and after that taking off of the Woodstock territory and once again into a prairie setting. The street at that point bends back toward the north and afterward takes a correct turn at an unsignalized crossing point where it proceeds with commonly east for the rest of its length. 

Before achieving the McHenry region somewhat more than four miles east, the street goes through two signalized crossing points, some light woodlands, and some meager private improvements. Presently entering the busier city of McHenry, it takes on the name Elm Street and augments to four paths west of Ringwood Road. Light business structures with neighborhoods behind them line the roadway until the intersection of the McHenry Branch of the Union Pacific/Northwest Line close to the McHenry Metra station. At the following convergence, ILÃÂ 120 meets with ILÃÂ 31 (Front Street/Richmond Road) where they quickly run simultaneously for not exactly a half mile. It next movements over the Fox River, 

goes by another segment of business, and afterward comes back to a calmer setting that includes a blend of open territories, neighborhoods, private venture, and Lily Lake. 

Proceeding with its to some degree country adventure toward the east, Illinois 120 winds up referred to as Belvidere Road as it enters Lake County and the town of Lakemoor which is before long pursued by the bustling convergence of U.S. Highway 12/Illinois Route 59 (Rand Road). The street at that point heads into the town of Volo which highlights land created with organizations and homes on the south and undeveloped arrive on the north. This is additionally where it passes the crossing point of the western end of ILÃÂ 60 and after that limits to two paths. The street at that point keeps running past the Baxter Healthcare office and continues into the Round Lake territory where it passes by the Nippersink Forest Preserve on the north and after that between two private improvements. For only a slight occasion, it goes through Round Lake Park before entering the town of Hainesville where it passes the Metra Milwaukee District/North Line tracks, the eastern end of ILÃÂ 134, and a couple of business before going into the more populated city of Grayslake. Neighborhoods and intermittent private ventures lie north and south of the street until it crosses Canadian National Railway (CN) tracks (utilized by the Metra North Central Service) preceding a convergence with ILÃÂ 83 (Barron Boulevard). In the wake of passing a mall on the south, the following stretch of roadway contains a blend of different organizations and private advancements, just as a part of the Lake Forest Hospital, while likewise broadening to four paths on its way to deal with a noteworthy intersection with U.S. Highway 45. Past the convergence, the street passes a business court and again limits back to two paths before passing by more neighborhoods on the north, and some open territories that contain the Almond Marsh Forest Preserve on the south. 

Now it augments to turn into a four-path separated roadway west of Almond Road and it enters the southern piece of Gurnee where goes close to the Merit Club fairway which misleads the south of a "T" crossing point with Hunt Club Road. The eastward way to deal with this convergence includes the main double left turn paths on the whole length of Illinois 120. The rest of the area of thruway, albeit just quickly restricted access, has constrained signalized convergences which keeps traffic streaming at a progressively steady rate. It first goes under an evaluation partition at Illinois Route 21 (Milwaukee Avenue) and goes over the Des Plaines River before framing an exchange with Interstate 94 (Tri-State Tollway). Just southbound access is allowed to I-94; northbound access is accessible by means of ILÃÂ 21. It next enters some portion of the Waukegan territory and without further ado experiences an at-level crossing point with O'Plaine Road and after that proceeds with more level detachment at the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) tracks and Greenleaf Avenue. Exchanges with ILÃÂ 43 (Waukegan Road) and U.S. Highway 41 (Skokie Highway) intently tail each other with a short progress into Park City situated between these two intersections. It very well may befuddle here as there is no immediate access to northbound US-41 or southbound IL-43, which ends promptly north at US-41. Illinois 120 loses its partitioned expressway status subsequent to going over the Union Pacific (UP) tracks and going by its last stretch of organizations as it reenters Waukegan. It before long reaches the economically created, signalized crossing point of Illinois Route 131 (Green Bay Road) where it ends as a state course; Belvidere Road proceeds with east as a nearby street. 

State Bond Issue (SBI) Route 120 initially kept running from Havana to Mason City in west-focal Illinois. In 1939 this moved toward becoming ILÃÂ 119, and in 1951, U.S. Highway 136. Meanwhile, in 1941 Illinois 120 supplanted Illinois Route 20 to maintain a strategic distance from disarray with close-by U.S. Highway 20. In 1972, the assignment was expelled east of ILÃÂ 131. Amid the mid 1990s, plans came to fruition to extend 5.7 miles of roadway in McHenry and Lake areas. The venture reached out from River Road in McHenry to east of Illinois 60. These plans likewise incorporated the development of a short southern detour around the town of Volo. By 1994, the work had finished up which brought about four solid travel paths, giving simpler access between the two regions. In 2000, a $4.6 million development venture was finished at the crossing point of US-45. The enhancements that occurred to Illinois 120 were: extending to two paths toward every path and adding a correct swing path toward the eastward methodology. The latest real development that has occurred was between August 2007 and July 2008 at the trade with I-94. The work comprised of decimating the two scaffold structures that movement over the tollway and supplanting them with new ones. 

As of late there has been much talk on the most proficient method to improve the eastÃ¢ÂÂwest traffic stream all through north-focal Lake County. ILÃÂ 120 enters Lake County from the west as a four-path thruway and after that minimizations to a two-path roadway under three miles east, simply past ILÃÂ 60 and later turns into a four path partitioned expressway west of Hunt Club Road. Since there is substantial traffic from adjacent Interstate 94 toward the east just as traffic making a trip to and from McHenry County in the west, it appears to be legitimate to address this hole which isn't yet four paths. The answer for this issue was consented to be a 17-mile improvement from US-12 to US-41, including a 7-mile southern detour in Grayslake. This has since turned out to be known as the "120 detour". 

This task is firmly identified with another since quite a while ago postponed Lake district transportation venture; the ILÃÂ 53 expansion. The as of now slowed down undertaking has been wanted to expand the constrained access interstate, which conveys ILÃÂ 53 and ends at Lake-Cook Road, north to associate with the 120 detour, and afterward branch off toward U.S. Highway 12 toward the west and Interstate 94 toward the east. On the off chance that the task were ever assembled, it would appear to be essential that the eastÃ¢ÂÂwest 120 detour would be worked as a constrained access turnpike to interface with the proposed northÃ¢ÂÂsouth Illinois 53 augmentation which is additionally restricted access. The whole extent of this undertaking; beginning on Illinois 120 at Interstate 94, proceeding with west on the 120 detour, and associating with the Illinois 53 augmentation would give an immediate course to suburbanites in northern Lake County to access the western and southwestern Chicago rural areas. Since there have been many postponements throughout the decades on the best way to continue with this augmentation, the 120 detour venture pushed ahead individually as a free undertaking. 

In 2006, an achievability contemplate got in progress by an extraordinary hall arranging board which was made out of gatherings from adjacent networks and neighborhood government authorities and took open information. At first, the principle center for the open was to give input to the street character or sort of street. The options considered were: a four path indirect lane, four path signalized avenue, six path signalized blood vessel, and six path freeway. In December 2008, it was uncovered that the four path street alternative was chosen in a 11Ã¢ÂÂ2 vote over a turnpike, anyway regardless it stayed open whether roundabouts would be utilized instead of traffic signals at convergences. The expense of the task was evaluated at $521 million. In May 2009, the favored roadway arrangement was chosen. 

On October 14, 2009, the Route 120 Corridor Planning Council Governance Board went to an agreement and affirmed a brought together vision for the task which suggests that the detour be worked as a four path blood vessel roadway with constrained access. The subsequent stage is for the Illinois Department of Transportation to start a Phase I Preliminary Engineering Study. 

In 2012, the Blue Ribbon Advisory Council resuscitated the 120 interstate option as a tollway, instead of a circuitous or signalized street, and proposed the Route 53/120 freeway plan to IDOT as a four-path, totally underneath level tollway with a speed breaking point of 45Ã¢Â mph. The proposed roadway would incorporate such highlights as a multi-use way, bioswale verdant middle, arranged raised berms, in-asphalt lighting, all electronic tolling, and creative exchange plans. 

In 2016, Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor pulled back his help for the undertaking, issuing an announcement demonstrating his conviction that "budgetary and political substances have turned out to be difficult" and would keep the expansion from occurring in the ecological manner imagined in the 2012 report. Regardless of the pulled back help, the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority rolled out no improvements to the arrangement to direct an ecological effect ponder, with Chairman Bob Schillerstrom expressing "huge numbers of the inquiries that Chairman Lawlor raised would be replied" by such an investigation. 

On May 25, 2017, the Illinois Tollway board collectively affirmed a $25 million use for an ecological effect investigation of the proposed northward expansion of Illinois Route 53 into Lake County. Adversaries kept on censuring the venture as costly and unsafe to the earth, while supporters trust it will give blockage help and an aid to the economies of Lake and McHenry districts. The U.S. Open Interest Research Group, a shopper promotion association, incorporated the Route 53 expansion in a rundown of "nine inefficient expressway boondoggles," pegging the expense at $2.3 billion and saying it "would imperil the earth and comes up short on a practical subsidizing plan."
