During the 1960s, Selena's dad Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. turned into the third vocalist of Los Dinos, a gathering made out of Mexican Americans. The band started their vocations playing English-language doo-wop music. White Americans were insulted that a Mexican American band was singing "their sort of music". After a horde of Mexican-Americans ran Los Dinos out of a dance club for singing English-language melodies, the band chose to perform music of their legacy. Los Dinos discovered achievement recording and performing Spanish-language tunes and their prevalence developed. Quintanilla, Jr. left the band during the 1970s in the wake of fathering his third youngster, Selena. In the wake of finding Selena could sing, he immediately composed his kids into a band called Selena y Los Dinos. In spite of needing to record English-language melodies, the band recorded Tejano music sytheses; a male-ruled, Spanish-language kind with German impacts of polka, jazz, and blue grass music that was prevalent with Mexicans living in the United States. The band was regularly turned somewhere near Texas music settings in light of the individuals' ages and on the grounds that Selena was the lead vocalist. 

Rick Trevino, originator of the Tejano Music Awards, initially moved toward La Sombra as the opening represent the 1989 honors function, following Selena y Los Dinos. The band's lead vocalist Frank Sunie declined the offer, revealing to Trevino he "doesn't open up for anyone". Trevino at that point called Quintanilla, Jr. to request that he open the function. Quintanilla, Jr. promptly acknowledged the offer, saying it was "the best time, since everybody is calm. They're calm they're tuning in to the craftsman and the music." Unbeknown to Quintanilla, Jr and Selena, the new head of Sony Music Latin and JosÄÅ¡ Behar, who had as of late propelled EMI Latin Records, were going to the honors function and were exploring for new Latin acts. Behar needed to sign Selena to EMI's name Capitol Records, while Sony Music Latin was putting forth Quintanilla, Jr. twice Capitol's aggregate. Behar thought he had found the following Gloria Estefan, however his prevalent called Behar counter-intuitive since he had just been in Texas for seven days. Quintanilla, Jr. picked EMI Latin's offer as a result of the potential for a hybrid, and he needed his youngsters to be the principal performers to sign with the organization. 

Before Selena marked her agreement with EMI Latin in 1989, Behar and Stephen Finfer mentioned Selena for an English-language debut collection. She was approached to make three showing accounts for Charles Koppelman, director of EMI Records. Subsequent to exploring them, Koppelman declined a hybrid endeavor, trusting Selena should initially fortify her fan base. In a 2007 meeting, Behar talked about the trouble of account Selena's English-language debut. He said EMI "had let we all to trust that she would record in English, and it simply wasn't emerging for reasons unknown". Behar said the record organization "didn't trust, they didn't figure it could occur", and constantly told Selena and her dad "it wasn't the correct time" for an English-language debut. 

Selena marked a record manage EMI backup SBK Records in November 1993, after her Grammy Award designation for "Live" (1993). The updates on the artist's record bargain was headline news in "Board" magazine. In a 1994 gathering, Selena communicated her blame to Behar; Selena had told questioners of her up and coming hybrid collection and revealed to them the account was required to be discharged soon. At the time, Selena had not recorded a solitary tune for her arranged English-language debut. Behar in this way revealed to Koppelman that Selena and her band would leave EMI and discover a record organization willing to record an English-language collection for Selena. Behar had misled the director to constrain the hybrid collection to start; EMI yielded and the chronicle sessions started. Selena said she felt scared by the chronicle bargain on the grounds that the circumstance was new to her and just a couple of individuals had trusted she would make progress in the pop market. 

As per Betty Cortina of "Individuals" magazine, "Longing for You" denoted a move that annulled the artist being showcased as a feature of her band and charged Selena as an American solo craftsman in "the most major manner for her". From 1989, Selena's sibling A.B. Quintanilla turned into Selena's central music maker and lyricist, and remained so all through her profession. Since Quintanilla III was dealing with the artist's subsequent chronicle to "Love Prohibido" (1994), he couldn't create the hybrid collection. He was approached to meet with a few makers in New York and pick one who might best "fit with Selena's style". "Longing for You" was the main collection Selena's family did not deliver. They had chosen to venture down before the chronicle sessions and enable proficient pop makers to work with her. Quintanilla III and Selena traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, and met with Keith Thomas, who had arranged the instrumental parts for the tune called "I Could Fall in Love" yet had not yet finished the vocal parts, so he sang it for them. Selena and Quintanilla III promptly enjoyed it; Quintanilla III said he needed Selena to incorporate it on her collection. Recording sessions started in December 1994 at The Bennett House in Franklin, Tennessee; Selena needed to return later when Thomas could give extra vocals. Selena and her significant other Chris PÄÅ¡rez touched base at the studio on March 24, 1995 to wrap up the tune. In a 2002 meeting, PÄÅ¡rez said Thomas gave Selena a tape of "I Could Fall in Love" and said she had the tune "on circle" and she "more likely than not heard it a hundred times". He trusted it had an "impact on her" since "she went into the studio the following day to really do the chronicle and simply was nailing things left and right and [Thomas] was giving her a chance to do her thing and I mean it was a unimaginable thing to watch". 

EMI Records, which had more involvement in the pop market, headed the task and permitted Selena to pick one melody that she preferred. Her sister and drummer of the band, Suzette Quintanilla, said in a 1997 meeting that the artist deliberately picked a melody that spoke to what "Selena was about". She picked "Longing for You", which was composed by American musicians Franne Golde and Tom Snow in 1989 for American R&B bunch The Jets, who rejected it. As indicated by Snow, Golde "never abandoned the tune and in the end got it to Selena". At the point when Quintanilla III heard the showing recording, he disclosed to Selena he didn't care for the track. Selena revealed to him she was going to record it since she supported its expressive substance and message. In a 2002 meeting, Quintanilla III said he was "progressively judgmental" on his initial introduction of the showing recording than the tune itself and refered to its variety, substance, and melody structure for altering his opinion. 

Selena started recording "Longing for You" on March 5, 1995, at Quintanilla, Jr's. recording mark Q-Productions in Corpus Christi, Texas. Amid the account session, Selena was experiencing bronchitis. Her dad asked her to "simply attempt" and sing the melody in light of the fact that few makers had touched base from Los Angeles to watch her record the track. After the chronicle session, the makers preferred Selena's vocal range in the tune and chose to utilize her first take. American maker Guy Roche delivered and masterminded the piece alongside "Hostage Heart". After the game plan for "Longing for You", Selena needed PÄÅ¡rez to hear the completion item. He was unfit to go to after Quintanilla, Jr. needed him to work with a band he was keen on overseeing. In 2012, PÄÅ¡rez wrote in his book about his and Selena's relationship that he lamented not setting off to the account session. 

Selena recorded "God's Child (Baila Conmigo)", a two part harmony with David Byrne that was incorporated on the soundtrack of the satire film "Blue in the Face" (1995). Byrne said the melody was the last chronicle Selena made before she was shot and slaughtered by Yolanda SaldÄÂ­var, her companion and previous administrator of her Selena Etc. boutiques, on March 31, 1995. Behar said advancement "will be on the whiz scale" and "[we] didn't put this showcasing effort behind it on the grounds that there was a disaster. We put this promoting effort behind it since we trusted this would have been a colossal collection on account of the music. This is a record that we're getting down to business throughout the following 10 months." EMI Records and EMI Latin set aside ($784,000 2015 USD) to finish "Longing for You". "God help us (I'll Never Fall in Love Again)", a melody proposed to be recorded for "Longing for You", was discharged on the SelenaQRadio (a free radio worked by Quintanilla, Jr.) in September 2015. Quintanilla, Jr. chosen to discharge the demo form of the melody after fans started mentioning for it to be heard. 

"Longing for You" is a multigenre work of American popular and Latin music. It fuses the differing complex impacts of techno, hip-bounce, pop shake, move pop, territorial Mexican music, Tejano, R&B, disco, and flamenco music. The principal half of the collection involves R&B and pop anthems, while the rest of Latin-themed impacts that profile Selena's music profession. Music columnists said makers who worked with Selena endeavored to exaggeration her with Paula Abdul, Amy Grant, Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Madonna. "Newsweek" magazine called Selena's English-language accounts "a mix of urban pop and Latin warmth". As indicated by AllMusic's Stephen Erlewine, the collection's state of mind is fiery, celebratory, and rich. "I Could Fall in Love" and "Longing for You" are expressively indistinguishable; called "confession booth numbers", the two accounts talk about sadness, shock, and dread of dismissal from a man the tunes' storytellers are beginning to look all starry eyed at. The verses of "Longing for You" additionally investigate sentiments of aching and expectation. Larry Flick of "Bulletin" magazine composed that "Longing for You"s hopeful verses have an "influencing impact that won't be lost on AC [radio]." 

"God's Child (Baila Conmigo)" utilizes an odd mood that is vigorous, dim, strange, and its verses recommend subterfuge and counter-authority. The melody has components of rumba, flamenco, shake, R&B, and Middle Eastern music. "Hostage Heart" has 1980s funk; Achy Obejas of the "Chicago Tribune" said it was expected for contemporary hit radio. The disco house track "I'm Getting Used to You", which utilizes cha-cha, investigates an unstable relationship. Mario Tarradell of "The New London Day" said "Hostage Heart" and "I'm Getting Used to You" verge on new jack swingÃ¢ÂÂa well known R&B subgenre spearheaded by Jade and Mary J. Blige. The makers of the soundtrack of the 1995 lighthearted comedy dramatization film "Wear Juan DeMarco"Ã¢ÂÂin which Selena played a mariachi singerÃ¢ÂÂdecided not to incorporate her chronicles of "TÄÅ SÄÅlo TÄÅ" and "El Toro Relajo". Christopher John Farley of "Time" magazine said the makers who prohibited the melodies lamented this move following the effect of Selena's passing. As per Denise Segura and Patricia Zavella in their book "Ladies and Migration in the U.S.- Mexico Borderlands: A Reader" (2007), "TÄÅ SÄÅlo TÄÅ"Ã¢ÂÂa Pedro Infante coverÃ¢ÂÂand "El Toro Relajo" are about pathetic love and were recorded in a ranchera-style. Selena recorded "TÄÅ SÄÅlo TÄÅ" "con ganas"Ã¢ÂÂa Spanish-language truism that means an entertainer singing with "proud emotionality"; basic among ranchera vocalists. 

EMI Records, which needed the 1992 track "Missing My Baby" and the 1994 single "Techno Cumbia" to be added to "Longing for You", inquired 

Quintanilla III to meet with R&B bunch Full Force in Manhattan. The gathering remixed the two melodies, added vocals to "Missing My Baby", and remixed the last in a reggae style. Quintanilla, Jr. chosen to include "Como la Flor" (1992), "Love Prohibido" (1994), and "Bidi Bom" (1994) to "Longing for You". He pitched the possibility of remixing the tunes as if the band was singing them in show, changing their beats a bit. Quintanilla III said the new forms of the tracks gave fans "something new" and that he thought the thought was "slick". "Como la Flor", credited as a vocation propelling single, communicates the distress of a lady whose sweetheart has deserted her for another accomplice while she wishes "only the best" for him. "Love Prohibido" is a Romeo and Juliet-esque Spanish-language move pop track. "Bidi Bom", remixed into a reggae track, talks about the storyteller's heart palpitating at whatever point her affection intrigue strolls past her.

Most of contemporary surveys were sure. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said "Longing for You" was the main chronicle by Selena to have been heard by the all inclusive community of the United States since her passing pulled in American audience members to her collection. This was reverberated by Alisa Valdes of "The Boston Globe". Erlewine said "Love Prohibido" is "a progressively predictable discharge" and that "Longing for You" was not the artist's best work, and he considered it an initial exertion. As per Erlewine, the English-language tracks on the collection "are the same than her Spanish melodies"; he likewise said the collection "would have been more grounded" if the vocalist had lived. He completed his survey by considering the collection a "powerfulÃ¢ÂÂand touchingÃ¢ÂÂtestament to her gifts". John Lannert of "Board" magazine called the collection's business achievement "barely an accident". "Vibe" magazine patron Ed Morales, depicted the collection as a summation of her cumbia-impacted melodies, her Tex-Mex (Texas-Mexico) "brilliance", and a "piercing look" of the way the vocalist's melodic vocation may have taken had she lived. Composing for "Time" magazine, David Browne said "Longing for You"s discharge was "one of the snappiest after death collections at any point cobbled together". He said the makers who worked with Selena on the collection had definitively combined her with accounts that helped him to remember lighter variants of Paula Abdul and called them "welcoming card assumptions". He perceived the later 50% of "Longing for You" as "the genuine, unbridled Selena", calling them "conventional ditties or tropical dreams, Selena summons desire and enthusiasm"; representing that those characteristics found on her English-language melodies are missing from the Spanish-language ones. 

Composing for the "Chicago Tribune", Achy Obejas considered the account a fragmentary work and said it is "Selena's past and about what may have been". Obejas called the record "brimming with guarantee and imperfections", and said its deliberate bilingual nature was finished by "need instead of plan". She additionally said the collection is a Latino hybrid nix, refering to Gloria Estefan's prior standard work as the crude Latino hybrid; in spite of the fact that Selena "didn't get the chance to make the following stride" as did Estefan. Objeas additionally composed that the collection is the inverse of a "magnum opus, or authoritative, or even a demonstration of Selena's abilities", yet is to a greater degree a "buffet".

Christopher John Farley of "Time" magazine said "Longing for You" raised Selena's music "to a far more extensive group of onlookers than she at any point had when she was alive". He said the collection consolidates her "best, most pleasant work" and called it "an admirable however dismal achievement". Differentiating her Tejano and English-language melodies, Farley composed that Selena's Tejano chronicles was once in a while ungainly, though her English pop tunes were "sweet, unadulterated and clear, and on the mariachi numbers, Selena flaunts a voice that is hot, solid and nimbly developing". 

Composing for the "New York Daily News", Mary Talbot said tuning in to "Longing for You" was "much the same as filtering through a dead lady's scrapbook" and called it "unique jottings and depictions some cunning, some light, all weighted with sentimentality". Talbot said the collection exhibits "Selena's past and plots what could have been her future", and in light of the vocalist's passing, the story is deficient. She called the English contributions "solid, nonexclusive pop numbers" that would be favored among her Tejano following "however there aren't sufficient of them to demonstrate her quality or expansiveness as an English-language craftsman". Talbot said Selena was dexterous in confounding "conventional Mexican music with a contemporary American pop reasonableness, and that expertise doesn't figure with these melodies". Towards the finish of her survey, Talbot said "Longing for You" is "the bubbly fly of her age". Mario Tarradell of "The Dallas Morning News" said the collection "doesn't convey", composing that Selena was "patched up to sound like one of pop radio's numerous nonexclusive female vocalist" and that her English accounts do not have "the bubbly, bubbly identity, the chica-del-barrio enchant" found on her Tejano tunes. Tarradell said the English melodies were "lukewarm impersonations of Amy Grant and Abdul". Subside Watrous of "The New York Times" called "Longing for You" "an accumulation of remains" and said the Spanish-language melodies "sound better" than Selena's English ones. Watrous said the makers did not enhance Selena's English-language tracks and gave their everything. He further composed that "the music is unremarkable business" yet that Selena recorded them "so well on the collection" that it proposed "she had a decent shot of achievement, working lavish numbers in a mysterious pop style that Disney has aced". Shake music giver Roger Catlin of the "Hartford Courant" portrayed "Longing for You" as "a bundle that indicates the general ability and massive capability of the youthful star". Catlin said her English-language works were inadequate with regards to "specialized heroics that have characterized [Selena] during the '90s." however expresses the vocalist "is justifiably guaranteed" on her Spanish contributions. He said Selena was "relaxed" and that the material appeared that way since she had just recorded four English-language tracks before her passing.
