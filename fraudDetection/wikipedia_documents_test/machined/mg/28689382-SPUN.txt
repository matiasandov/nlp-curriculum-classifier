My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic 

My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic is a Canadian-American kids' energized dream TV arrangement made by Lauren Faust for Hasbro. The arrangement depends on Hasbro's My Little Pony line of toys and vivified works and is frequently alluded to by gatherers as the fourth era ("G4") of the establishment. The arrangement debuted on October 10, 2010, on The Hub link station (which was renamed as Discovery Family in late 2014). Hasbro chose illustrator Lauren Faust as the imaginative chief and official maker for the show. Faust tried to challenge the built up nature of the current My Little Pony line, making more top to bottom characters and bold settings; she left the arrangement amid season 2, to be supplanted by Meghan McCarthy as showrunner. 

The show pursues a studious human unicorn horse named Twilight Sparkle as her coach Princess Celestia guides her to find out about kinship in the town of Ponyville. Dusk and her mythical serpent collaborator Spike become dear companions with five different horses: Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie. Every one of the horses speak to an alternate feature of kinship, and Twilight finds herself to be a key piece of the supernatural curios known as the "Components of Harmony". The horses travel on experiences and help other people around Equestria while working out issues that emerge in their very own companionships. 

The arrangement has turned into a noteworthy business achievement, turning into the most exceedingly appraised unique generation in the Hub Network's communicated history and prompting new marketing open doors for Hasbro, including books, garments, collectible exchanging cards, and funnies. In spite of the objective statistic of young ladies, "Fellowship Is Magic" has likewise picked up an expansive after of more established watchers, for the most part youthful and moderately aged men, who call themselves "". Segments of the show have progressed toward becoming piece of the remix culture, and have framed the reason for an assortment of web images. 

As of April 2019, the show is at present on its ninth and last season. A full length movie adjustment legitimately dependent on the TV arrangement, titled "", was dramatically discharged on October 6, 2017 in the United States. A turn off establishment, "", was propelled in 2013. The initial two movies, "" and "", has been appeared restricted showy screenings before transmission and home media discharge. 

Hasbro, Inc. has delivered a few manifestations and lines of toys and amusement identified with the My Little Pony establishment, frequently marked by authorities as "ages". The enlivened arrangement "My Little Pony Tales" which debuted in 1992 was the toy line's latest TV arrangement before "Companionship Is Magic", highlighting the horse plans of the primary toy line. It was trailed by different direct-to-video discharges, which included later plans up to the third manifestation of the establishment. Similarly as Michael Bay's film had supported the new "Transformers" toy line, Hasbro needed to retool the My Little Pony establishment and update it to all the more likely suit the present statistic and taste of young ladies. As indicated by Margaret Loesch, CEO of Hub Network, returning to properties that had worked in the past was an essential programming choice, impacted to a degree by the feelings of the system's customizing officials, various whom were once aficionados of such shows. Senior Vice President Linda Steiner additionally expressed that they "planned to have the show advance to a bigger statistic", with the idea of "co-seeing" of guardians with their kids being a focal topic of the Hub Network's customizing. Focal subjects that Hasbro looked for the show included kinships and cooperating, factors they decided from statistical surveying in how young ladies played with their toys. 

Illustrator and essayist Lauren Faust drew closer Hasbro, looking to build up her young ladies' toys property "Cosmic system Girls" into an energized arrangement. Faust, who had recently taken a shot at Cartoon Network's "The Powerpuff Girls" and "Cultivate's Home for Imaginary Friends", had been pitching unique activity gone for young ladies for quite a long time, yet had dependably been rejected by studios and systems since kid's shows for young ladies were viewed as fruitless. When she pitched to Lisa Licht of Hasbro Studios, Licht indicated Faust one of their ongoing My Little Pony vivified works, "", "totally on the fly". Licht thought about that Faust's style was appropriate to that line, and requested that her think of some as "thoughts where to take another form of the establishment". 

Faust was at first employed by Hasbro to make a pitch book of scriptures for the show, enabling her to get extra help with conceptualization. Faust said she was "amazingly incredulous" about taking the activity at first since she had constantly discovered shows dependent on young ladies' toys to exhaust and unrelatable. My Little Pony was one of her most loved adolescence toys, yet she was frustrated that her creative ability at the time was not at all like the vivified shows, in which the characters, as indicated by Faust, "simply hosted perpetual tea gatherings, snickered over nothing and vanquished lowlifess by either offering to them or crying". With the opportunity to take a shot at "My Little Pony", she would have liked to demonstrate that "kid's shows for young ladies don't need to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness". To do this, she joined into the structure of the characters and the show numerous components that repudiated admired generalizations of young ladies, for example, assorted identities, the message that companions can be extraordinary and can get into contentions yet at the same time be companions, and the possibility that young ladies ought not be restricted by what others state they may or may not be able to. Components of the characters' identities and the show's settings depended without anyone else youth creative ability of the horses' undertakings, to a limited extent motivated by the energized demonstrates that her siblings would watch while growing up, for example, "Transformers" and ""; she thought about that she was making "Fellowship Is Magic" "for me as an eight-year-old". Faust still went for the characters to be "relatable" characters, utilizing clichÃ© "symbols of girliness, (for example, the whithered stray or the savant) so as to widen the intrigue of the characters for the youthful female crowd. 

Faust expressed that as she furnished Hasbro with a greater amount of her thoughts for the show, she was propelled by their positive reaction to the non-customary components. Faust had at first pitched the show to incorporate "experience stories" in a comparable extent to "relationship stories", yet perceiving the more youthful target gathering of people, just as the trouble of putting together complex plots with respect to the experience components, she cut back this substance, concentrating more on trades between the characters. The show still joins long winded animals proposed to unnerve kids, for example, mythical serpents and hydras, yet it puts more accentuation on the companionships among the characters, showed with a comedic tone. When the show was endorsed, Faust had created three full contents for the arrangement. 

Faust started to work out idea draws, a few of which showed up on her DeviantArt page, including horses from the first arrangement (Twilight, Applejack, Firefly, Surprise, Posey and Sparkler), which later gave the center to the principle cast of the show. Hasbro affirmed the show with Faust as Executive Producer and requested that her total the pitch book of scriptures. So as to do as such, Faust got Martin Ansolabehere and Paul Rudish, who had taken a shot at other vivified appears with her. Faust credits Rudish for the motivation of the pegasus horses controlling the climate in Equestria, just as the character of Nightmare Moon amid this period. Faust likewise counseled Craig McCracken, her better half and furthermore an artist and maker of "The Powerpuff Girls" and "Encourage's Home for Imaginary Friends". In the wake of seeing the underlying adaptation of the pitch book of scriptures, Hasbro mentioned more character plans from Faust's group; in this way, Faust brought on board Dave Dunnet and Lynne Naylor to additionally refine the foundation and character styles. 

On finishing of the pitch book of scriptures, Hasbro and Faust started taking a gander at studios for the liveliness. Studio B Productions (renamed to DHX Media on September 8, 2010, after its parent organization, alongside DHX's different auxiliaries) had recently taken a shot at Macromedia Flash-put together movements and with respect to demonstrates that included a substantial number of creatures, and Faust felt they would be a decent determination. Studio B mentioned that Jayson Thiessen be the chief, a decision Faust concurred with. She, Thiessen, and James Wootton drove the consummation of a two-minute short to pitch the last item to Hasbro, bringing about the organization's authorizing the full creation. Faust evaluates that from being at first requested to build up the show until this point took around one year. 

The show is created at Hasbro Studios in Los Angeles, where the greater part of the composition staff is found, and at DHX Media Vancouver in Vancouver, British Columbia, for the movement work. 

Faust's underlying composition staff at Hasbro Studios incorporated a few essayists who had worked with her on her past shows and were affirmed by Hasbro. These included Amy Keating Rogers, Cindy Morrow, Meghan McCarthy, Chris Savino, Charlotte Fullerton, M.A. Larson, and Dave Polsky. The composition procedure started with Faust and Renzetti concocting expansive plots for each show. The two would then hold a meeting to generate new ideas with every scene's author, enabling the essayist to content out scenes and discourse. Faust and Renzetti then worked with the essayist to finish the contents and relegate some essential storyboard guidelines. Hasbro was included all through this procedure and set out a portion of the ideas to be joined into the show. Instances of Hasbro's impact incorporate having Celestia be a princess as opposed to a ruler, making one of the horses concentrated on style, and depicting toy sets in applicable places inside the story, for example, Rarity's boutique. Now and again, Hasbro mentioned that the show incorporate a setting, yet enabled Faust and her group to make its visual style, and Hasbro then put together the toy set with respect to it; a model is the Ponyville school building. Faust likewise needed to keep in touch with the E/I ("instructive and educational") benchmarks that Hasbro expected of the show, making the making of a portion of the circumstances she would have typically done on other vivified demonstrates increasingly troublesome; for instance, Faust refered to having one character consider another an "egghead" as "stepping an exceptionally sensitive line", and having one character cheat in a challenge as "troubling to a few". Every scene additionally by and large incorporates a good or life exercise, yet these were picked to "cross an expansive range of individual encounters", and not simply to suit kids. Since licensed innovation issues had caused Hasbro to lose a portion of the rights on the first horse names, the show incorporates a blend of unique characters from the toy line and new characters produced for the show. 

Finished contents were sent to Studio B for pre-generation and movement utilizing Macromedia Flash Professional 8. Thiessen's generation group was additionally permitted to choose key faculty subject to Hasbro's endorsement; one of those chose was craftsmanship chief Ridd Sorensen. The Studio B group would storyboard the gave contents, joining any heading and at times figuring out how to make scenes that the scholars had trusted difficult to appear in activity. The artists would then set up the key character presents, format, foundation workmanship, and other fundamental components, and send these renditions back to the generation group in Los Angeles for survey by Hasbro and recommendations from the scholars. Thiessen credited a great part of the specialized skill in the show to Wooton, who made Flash projects to streamline the situation and presenting of the horse characters and different components, improving and conserving on the measure of work required from different illustrators. For instance, the horses' manes and tails are commonly fixed shapes, vivified by bowing and extending them in bends in three measurements and giving them a feeling of development without the mind-boggling expense of individual energized hairs. The storyboard craftsmen and artists likewise need to fill in foundation characters for generally scripted scenes as to populate the world. As indicated by essayist Meghan McCarthy, a considerable lot of the little gestures to the being a fan, popular culture references, or other easter eggs would be included now by the studio. Once the pre-generation work was affirmed and finished, the scene would then be vivified. Despite the fact that Studio B played out the underlying activity work, the last advances were passed to Top Draw Animation in the Philippines, a movement studio that Studio B had worked with in the later piece of season one and past. 

The voice throwing and generation is taken care of by Voicebox Productions, with Terry Klassen as the arrangement's voice executive. Faust, Thiessen, and others took part in choosing voice on-screen characters, and Hasbro gave last endorsement. The voice work is performed preceding the activity, with the illustrators in the space to help give guidance; as indicated by Libman, this enables herself and different on-screen characters to play the character without specific constraints. Libman noticed that for chronicle her lines as the hyperactive Pinkie Pie, "I discovered that I can go as absurd as I need and they [the animators] once in a while pull me back." 

The arrangement's ambient melodies is made by William Kevin Anderson, and Daniel Ingram makes the tunes, which are possibly included on the off chance that they would bode well in the scene's content. The generation group recognizes explicit pieces of the scene where they need music signals, enabling Anderson to make proper music for each. Ingram works close by Anderson's sytheses to make vocal tunes that work with the ambient melodies while rounding out the show's dream setting. The organization of the music and tunes far goes before the communicate of the scene; for instance, tunes for the show's third season that started airing in November 2012 were created in 2011. Ingram thought about that tunes from past shows of My Little Pony were "somewhat dated" and chose to convey all the more intriguing work to the "Fellowship Is Magic" arrangement. Such changes incorporate making melodies with more passionate profundity than common for kids' movement, and having a tendency to compose tunes that can be appreciated musically outside of the setting of the scene. Ingram's melodies have "increased and progressively epic, more Broadway and increasingly realistic after some time" with Hasbro favoring the push to take a stab at "something historic for daytime TV", as indicated by Ingram. Verses and generally speaking melodic topics might be proposed by the authors; two models incorporate tunes composed by Amy Keating Rogers, who is a self-maintained Stephen Sondheim fan. The melody "The Art of the Dress" in the principal season scene "Appropriate for Success" is roused by "Assembling it" from the melodic "Sunday in the Park with George", while the season one finale's tune, "At The Gala", depends on Sondheim's "Into the Woods". A huge melodic number in the scene "The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000" paid tribute to the tune "Ya Got Trouble" from Meredith Willson's melodic, "The Music Man". 

Before the show was affirmed, Hasbro and Faust had anticipated scenes to be 11 minutes in length, to which Faust adjusted in her first full-length content, "The Ticket Master", which was a piece of the pitch book of scriptures. Be that as it may, Faust favored increasingly conventional 22-minute scenes, and Hasbro inevitably consented to this. The underlying generation stages were exceptionally tight, requiring a calendar twice as quick as Faust had recently experienced, and visit remote correspondence between the Los Angeles composing workplaces and the activity studio in Vancouver. Now and again, the two groups would hold "author's summits" to propose new thoughts for characters and circumstances, at which the liveliness group would give recommendations on visuals, non-verbal communication, and portrayal. Faust gauges that an opportunity to finish one scene was one year; at a certain point, the group was at the same time taking a shot at different phases of each of the 26 scenes of the main season, and when the second season was endorsed, that number rose briefly to 32. Scenes at that point circulated about a month after finish. Thiessen clarified that they had pushed to begin chip away at the second season when the first was finished, to forestall staff turnover. 

After the airing of the principal season's finale, Faust reported that she had left the show, and would be acknowledged later on as Consulting Producer. Her inclusion in the second season comprises for the most part of story origination and contents, and the contribution stopped after the second season. Regardless of leaving, despite everything she has high trusts in the staff individuals, expressing that "the holes I have left are being filled by the equivalent stunning specialists, authors, and chiefs who brought you SeasonÃ¢Â 1. I'm sure the show will be as engaging as ever". In a meeting with "New York Magazine", Faust expressed her purposes behind leaving were a mix of a boisterous generation plans and an absence of inventive control she had with the arrangement. As per her significant other McCracken, Faust's flight was because of the way that as a toy organization driven show, "there were things she needed to do with that arrangement that she simply couldn't do", and that there is "still some dissatisfaction with" not having the capacity to convey a portion of her plans to screen. 

"Companionship Is Magic" happens in the place that is known for Equestria, populated by assortments of horses including variations of Pegasus and unicorn, alongside other conscious and non-aware animals. The focal character is Twilight Sparkle, a unicorn female horse sent by her coach Princess Celestia, leader of Equestria, to the town of Ponyville to consider the enchantment of fellowship. In the show's opening scene "Companionship Is Magic", Twilight loathes this task, as she is increasingly worried about the prognosticated appearance of Nightmare Moon, the underhanded sister of Celestia. At the point when Nightmare Moon appears, vowing everlasting night and causing Celestia to vanish, Twilight sets off with five different horses Ã¢ÂÂ Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity Ã¢ÂÂ to acquire the Elements of Harmony and thrashing Nightmare Moon. Before Twilight can actuate the Elements, Nightmare Moon shows up and breaks them. Instantly of motivation, Twilight understands that every one of her new companions speaks to one of the Elements of Harmony (Honesty, Loyalty, Laughter, Generosity, and Kindness), and that she herself is the last piece, Magic. The otherworldly intensity of the horses' companionship returns Nightmare Moon to a humble Princess Luna. Celestia returns, reunites with her sister Princess Luna, and pronouncements that Twilight will remain in Ponyville to keep concentrating the enchantment of kinship, a lot to the satisfaction of Twilight and her new companions. 

Later scenes pursue Twilight and her companions managing different issues around Ponyville, including relational issues among loved ones, just as increasingly audacious stories including animals like mythical serpents and hydras, and sparing Equestria from disgusting characters. Toward the finish of every scene, Twilight sends a report back to Celestia clarifying what she found out about kinship from these undertakings. This piece of the recipe is relinquished in "Exercise Zero", the second-season scene in which Twilight is persuaded to be less inflexible in her apparent obligations; after this, every one of the principals contribute reports, in spite of the fact that the convention is slighted when suitable. In the fourth season, with the solicitation for reports no longer relevant, the six purpose to keep an aggregate individual diary in which they record their musings about existence for children. 

Another focal point of the show is the Cutie Mark Crusaders, a trio of a lot more youthful horses comprising of Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo, who are fixated on finding their "cutie marks", a notable image that mystically show up on a horse's flank once they have found their exceptional ability throughout everyday life. The show routinely includes scenes fixated on the Crusaders, who still can't seem to get their cutie stamps and are prodded by other youthful horses as "clear flanks". Accordingly, they frantically rush to attempt to find their abilities and get their very own cutie marks, frequently doing as such in humorous designs. 

In spite of the fact that the scenes are intended to remain solitary, the arrangement highlights coherence and generally story circular segments, with a few key components of the arrangement transforming; one such change is simply the development of Twilight, who spends the initial three seasons finding out about fellowship and is in this manner allowed wings by Celestia to turn into an alicorn and a princess in the finale "Mysterious Mystery Cure". In the finale "Dusk's Kingdom", she finds that she is the Princess of Friendship and begins living in an enchantment mansion after the decimation of her library home from past seasons. Other critical occasions affecting the arrangement are the Cutie Mark Crusaders at last acquiring their cutie checks in the scene "Crusaders of the Lost Mark"; a similar season's presentation of Starlight Glimmer, a terrible character who vindicates herself and turns into Twilight's student in the season finale "The Cutie Re-Mark"; and Rainbow Dash satisfying her long lasting dream of joining the tip top Wonderbolts flight group in the scene "Amateur Dash". 

Each season ordinarily has a topic and by and large story circular segment: a subject all through the , for instance, is horses' readiness for the Grand Galloping Gala that happens in the last scene of that season. In season 4, the Mane Six must discover six keys to a strange box uncovered after they give up the Elements of Harmony to their unique source, the Tree of Harmony, to spare Equestria; in the season finale, it is uncovered that they had just gotten the keys, as blessings they got amid the season from individuals they made a difference. 

The show spins around the undertakings and every day life of the unicorn horse Twilight Sparkle (voiced by Tara Strong), her child monster partner Spike (Cathy Weseluck), and her companions in Ponyville, conversationally alluded to as the "Mane Six": 

Other fundamental characters are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, comprising of Applejack's more youthful sister Apple Bloom (Michelle Creber), Rarity's more youthful sister Sweetie Belle (Claire Corlett), and Scootaloo (Madeleine Peters). The two alicorns managing over Equestria, Twilight's guide Princess Celestia (Nicole Oliver), and the more youthful Princess Luna (St. Germain), additionally show up routinely; another alicorn, Princess Cadance (Britt McKillip), is presented in the season two finale "A Canterlot Wedding" and regulates the northern Crystal Empire close by her significant other Shining Armor (Andrew Francis), a unicorn who is likewise Twilight's more established sibling. The season five debut "The Cutie Map" presents Starlight Glimmer (Kelly Sheridan), a foe who in this manner turns into Twilight's understudy in the season finale, "The Cutie Re-Mark". 

Numerous companions, relatives, and different occupants of Ponyville show up as often as possible, including Applejack's more established sibling Big McIntosh (Peter New) and grandma Granny Smith (St. Germain); the Crusaders' educator Cheerilee (Oliver) and enemies Diamond Tiara (Chantal Strand) and Silver Spoon (Shannon Chan-Kent); the town's civic chairman, Mayor Mare (Weseluck); and the solid pegasus Bulk Biceps (Michael Dobson). Outstanding auxiliary characters outside of Ponyville incorporate oneself declared "incredible and amazing" voyaging entertainer Trixie (Kathleen Barr); the capricious zebra Zecora (Brenda Crichlow), who lives in the close-by Everfree Forest and fiddles with home grown medication; the Wonderbolts Spitfire (Kelly Metzger) and Soarin (Matt Hill); and Pinkie Pie's more established sister Maud (Ingrid Nilson), who infrequently communicates feeling and is fixated on rocks.
