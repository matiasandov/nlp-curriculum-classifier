While growing "Quick Five", Universal Studios intentionally left from the road hustling subject common in past movies in the arrangement, to change the establishment into a heist activity arrangement including vehicles. Thusly, they would have liked to pull in more extensive gatherings of people that may somehow or another be put off by an overwhelming accentuation on vehicles and vehicle culture. "Quick Five" is viewed as the transitional film in the arrangement, including just a single vehicle race and giving more thoughtfulness regarding activity set pieces, for example, weapon battles, fights, and the heist of $100Ã¢Â million. The generation mounted an exhaustive promoting effort, showcasing the film through online life, virtual amusements, film chains, car makers, and at NASCAR races.

At the point when Dominic "Dom" Toretto is being transported to Lompoc Prison by transport, his sister Mia Toretto and companion Brian O'Conner lead an ambush on the transport, making it crash and liberating Dom. While the experts scan for them, the trio departures to Rio de Janeiro. Anticipating Dom's landing, Mia and Brian join their companion Vince and different members on a vocation to take three vehicles from a train. Brian and Mia find that specialists from the U.S. Medication Enforcement Administration (DEA) are additionally on the train and that the autos are caught property. At the point when Dom touches base with the remainder of the members, he understands that the lead member, Zizi, is just keen on taking one vehicle - a Ford GT40. Dom has Mia take the vehicle herself before he and Brian battle Zizi and his cohorts, amid which Zizi executes the DEA operators appointed to the vehicles. Dom and Brian are caught and conveyed to wrongdoing master Hernan Reyes, the proprietor of the vehicles and Zizi's supervisor. Reyes arranges the pair be cross examined to find the area of the vehicle, yet they figure out how to escape and withdraw to their safehouse. 

While Brian, Dom, and Mia look at the vehicle to find its significance, Vince arrives and is discovered attempting to expel a PC chip from it. He concedes he was intending to pitch the chip to Reyes all alone, and Dom drives him out. Brian examines the chip and finds it contains the total monetary subtleties of Reyes' criminal domain, including the areas of US$100ÃÂ million in real money. 

Strategic Security Service specialist Luke Hobbs and his group touch base in Rio to capture Dom and Brian. With the assistance of neighborhood officer Elena Neves, they travel to Dom's safehouse, yet discover it under ambush by Reyes' men. Brian, Dom and Mia escape; Dom recommends they split up and leave Rio, yet Mia reports she is pregnant with Brian's kid. Dom consents to stick together and recommends they take the cash from Reyes to begin another life. They compose a group to play out the heist: Han, Roman, Tej, Gisele, Leo, and Santos. Vince later joins the group subsequent to sparing Mia from being caught by Reyes' men. The group invade one of Reyes' offices and set flame to the cash there, goading him into uniting his cash at a solitary area - a safe vault inside a police headquarters. 

Hobbs and his group in the long run find and capture Dom, Mia, Brian, and Vince. While transporting them to the airplane terminal for removal to the United States, the caravan is assaulted by Reyes' men, who slaughter Hobbs' group. Hobbs and Elena are spared by Dom, Brian, Mia, and Vince as they battle back and escape, however Vince is shot all the while and kicks the bucket. Needing to vindicate his killed group, Hobbs and Elena consent to help with the heist. The pack break into the police headquarters and tear the vault holding Reyes' cash from the structure utilizing their vehicles, hauling it through the city. After a broad police pursue, Dom makes Brian proceed without him while he assaults the police and the seeking after Reyes, utilizing the vault joined to his vehicle to crush their vehicles. Brian returns and executes Zizi while Reyes is seriously harmed by Dom's strike. Hobbs touches base on the scene and executes Reyes to retaliate for his group. Despite the fact that Hobbs will not let Dom and Brian go free, he gives them a 24-hour head begin to escape on the condition they leave the vault for what it's worth. Be that as it may, the vault is unfilled as it had been exchanged amid the pursuit. In the wake of part the money (Vince's offer is given to his family), they go their different ways. 

On a tropical shoreline, Brian and a noticeably pregnant Mia unwind. They are met by Dom and Elena. Brian provokes Dom to a last, no-stakes race to demonstrate who is the better driver. 

In a mid-credits scene, Hobbs is given a record by Monica Fuentes concerning the seize of a military escort in Berlin, where he finds an ongoing photograph of Dom's previous sweetheart Letty, who had been assumed dead. 

The focal cast is adjusted by Puerto Rican artists Tego CalderÄÅn and Don Omar as Leo and Santos individually, individuals from the heist group. Michael Irby plays Reyes' correct hand man Zizi. Alimi Ballard, Fernando Chien, Yorgo Constantine, and Geoff Meedy depict Hobbs' colleagues Fusco, Wilkes, Chato, and Macroy.

By February 3, 2010, it was affirmed that a fifth film, alluded to as "Quick Five", was going into generation in the "Quick and Furious" arrangement, and that a 6th film was being arranged. It was likewise affirmed that Diesel, Walker, author Chris Morgan and maker Neal H. Moritz would all arrival to their jobs for the new portion. Moritz said that, following the achievement of "Quick and Furious" (2009), which had rejoined Diesel, Brewster, Walker and Rodriguez from the first film, the creation needed to bring them back again for the following one. Diesel felt that the story between the characters depicted without anyone else's input and Walker should keep, imagining it as three sections, of which "Quick Five" would be the last. Diesel likewise needed to bring back an assortment of characters that had been in past movies without communicating, set up them together and "have a great deal of fun". 

The creation had initially planned to film on area in Rio de Janeiro. Be that as it may, the Puerto Rican government offered charge motivators totaling about $11 million, impacting the choice to film there, utilizing Puerto Rico to speak to Rio de Janeiro. 

Widespread proposed to change the arrangement from road dashing activity into a progression of heist films with vehicle pursues in the vein of "The Italian Job" (1969) and "The French Connection" (1971), with "Quick Five" as the transitional motion picture. In April 2011, Universal administrator Adam Fogelson stated: 

The inquiry putting "Quick Five" and "Quick Six" together for us was: Can we remove it from being an unadulterated vehicle culture motion picture and into being a genuine activity establishment in the soul of those incredible heist films made 10 or 15 years prior? 

Fogelson said that the dashing viewpoint had put a "roof" on the quantity of individuals willing to see films in the arrangement, and that, by transforming it into an arrangement where vehicle driving capacity is only one part of the film, he planned to build the arrangement's group of onlookers. 

Lin needed to investigate the components of "opportunity and family" in the film and teamed up with Morgan towards that perfect, both having cooperated on past portions of the establishment. Morgan worked with Diesel to deliver a story bend that would additionally investigate and build up Diesel's character. A thought including heisting a vast safe had been brought about by Morgan amid the generation of "Quick and Furious", yet that film's reason did not work with how Morgan imagined it. He later consolidated it into "Quick Five". 

On a financial plan of $125 million, the shooting of "Quick Five" was booked for July and August 2010. Shooting had begun by July 14, 2010, however it took longer than figure: the film was all the while being shot toward the beginning of November 2010. 

Three film units worked all the while. The fundamental cast were required to head out to Rio at the command of Lin, who felt it imperative to comprehend the zone and its way of life to give the film a decent feeling of spot. Diesel concurred that it was imperative to shoot key scenes in Brazil, remarking "we had the capacity to shoot where different preparations probably won't most likely shoot in light of the fact that our establishment has such great road cred." 

The Rio film unit caught airborne shots of the city including Sugarloaf Mountain, Fort Copacabana, Ipanema Beach, the Dona Marta post point and the Christ the Redeemer statue. Setting up shots of the heist colleagues were taken as each touched base in Rio. Gibson was taped touching base in character at GaleÄÅo International Airport at the same time, when it turned out to be freely realized that a scene was being shot at the airplane terminal, the cast and group were mobbed. A comparative circumstance happened while Ludacris was shooting a scene in which his character purchases a vehicle to drive around the city. A scene where the finished heist group stroll down a shoreline was shot in Copacabana. 

The housetop pursue crosswise over favelas was recorded in Puerto Rico, where the creation could have more authority over the zone. The primary and second recording units started shooting in and around the capital, San Juan. The island's blend of tropical greenery and wide lanes enabled the generation to re-make the thickly populated favelas of Rio while finishing the bigger activity and outer scenes without episode. Generation creator Peter Wenham had the errand of changing Puerto Rico and Atlanta into the recently explored Rio areas in about a month, as the generation considered Rio inadmissible for recording huge numbers of the bigger scenes. Wenham needed to fortify structures to help the overwhelming camera gear, and to change the shades of in excess of 30 structures in the city to make them reasonable for taping. His group expected to change the structures and strew flotsam and jetsam to make the region look tousled and show up as a Rio shantytown. Wenham commented that, however the improvement was troublesome, to some extent because of the warmth, it was "a stroll in the recreation center" contrasted and taping in the Rio favelas themselves. Wenham planned to keep up a monochromatic shading plan for the film, with quieted blacks and grays, including his selection of hues for the autos utilized. He just included a large number of hues in the favela set. The Teodoro Moscosco connect interfacing San Juan to neighboring Isla Verde was utilized to film the last confrontation among Dom and Reyes, while a U.S. Naval force base dock 60 miles outside San Juan remained in for the scaffold for scenes including the vault crushing vehicles. Activity scenes were likewise taped in the Hato Rey and RÄÂ­o Piedras locale of San Juan. 

A foot interest in which Diesel, Brewster and Walker are pursued crosswise over favela housetops by Johnson and his group was shot throughout seven days in the little slope town of Naranjito, Puerto Rico. The scene was viewed as hard to shoot, as pathways were elusive from soggy tropical warmth and the scene included on-screen characters and trick pairs running while at the same time evading pooches, chickens and other stray creatures free in the region. To catch the scene, a 420-foot link camera rig was utilized to take into consideration a quick moving, feathered creatures eye perspective on the activity, and cameras on cranes were set up on housetops and in rear ways. Walker and Brewster made different takes of the finish of the scene, expecting them to hop almost 30 feet from a structure onto a holding up wellbeing mat. Altogether the creation utilized 236 professionals, 13,145 additional items, and produced 16,824 room evenings at lodgings, contributing $27 million to the Puerto Rican people group. 

Taping moved to Atlanta, Georgia for the last stage. Wenham and his group changed a dead train yard into a deserted vehicle plant utilized by the heroes as their home office. Overhauling the train yard occurred more than a while. It was required to sufficiently enable space for trick drivers to crash into the structure, and it needed to incorporate a coordinated lighting framework. The structure group evacuated dividers, pulled out old railroad vehicles, suspended rusted vehicle parts and car plant vehicle rails, and built littler structures inside the fundamental structure to change the site. With twenty-five pages of content to shoot in a restricted time, cinematographer Stephen Windon and his group went through three weeks setting up a progression of powerful, mechanized lights in the rafters of the structure, that could be controlled remotely to enable lighting to be adjusted rapidly while completely enlightening the set. An outside scene including Diesel and Walker going to a vehicle party, including a few superior autos, was shot close to the Georgia Dome. The train heist scene was taped in Rice, California more than three weeks. 

A fight scene among Johnson's and Diesel's characters was viewed as hard to arrange. The characters were composed to be similarly imposing, so the battle was punctuated with snapshots of character improvement, as Moritz felt this made the battle all the more energizing. The scene required half a month of practice and over seven days of taping by the performing artists and their trick copies, who brought about a few minor wounds. 

The climactic vault heist required a month of arrangement with each scene and camera edge decided ahead of time. The producers enlisted stunt executive Spiro Razatos and trick facilitator Jack Gill to coordinate the second-unit activity recording. The pair at first started research for the trick by testing the capacities of the prop vaults and the Dodge Chargers driven by Diesel and Walker. Shot in the city of Hato Rey, the clamorous scene requested explicit planning that must be synchronized with the different character associations additionally happening amid the scene. Razatos utilized a progression of camera autos including a crane-mounted camera on a Porsche Cayenne, which enabled him to film from an assortment of edges and statures while the vehicles were in movement, and a Subaru Impreza with a steel confine worked around it that considered following shots. The Subaru's driver Allen Padelford would every so often incidentally crash into the vault, making a shower of flashes that coincidentally ended up helpful film. Padelford additionally built up a top-mount double drive framework for the Chargers that enabled a trick driver to control the vehicle from the rooftop, while the performer concentrated on their execution inside the vehicle. 

Six forms of the 8-foot high vault were manufactured, each with explicit employments. One of the vaults was a faÄÂ§ade constructed onto the front of a semitruck and was utilized for taping close shots of the vault obliterating road autos. Another vault was a strengthened, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was associated with 30-foot links and hauled through the roads of San Juan by the two trick Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by trick driver Henry Kingi, who needed to wear a temperature controlled suit to make up for the temperatures inside that could surpass 100 degrees. A scene where the vault tumbled as the autos adjusted a corner was a handy impact, and the outcome was more brutal than the producers had foreseen. More than 200 vehicles were decimated by the vault amid recording. A few tricks must be cut including a last scene that would have seen the vault hanging over the edge of the Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This trick was surrendered when it was resolved that even the incredible Chargers would not have the capacity to help the vault's weight. 

The train heist displayed a few difficulties. The movie producers were required to adequately buy a length of working railroad for shooting and the trains important to ride the tracks. At that point trucks must be manufactured that could race the train and address the issues of the heist itself. Lin additionally necessitated that the autos being carried on the train have the capacity to bounce out of the train at full speed. The scene took exact execution. The producers utilized vehicles they could economically repeat for the train heistÃ¢ÂÂa 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette GS Roadster, and a Ford GT40Ã¢ÂÂto stay away from the cost of supplanting a certifiable $2 million Ford GT40.
