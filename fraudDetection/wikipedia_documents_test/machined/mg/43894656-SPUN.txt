In March 2014, official maker Jeffrey Bell expressed at the "Specialists of S.H.I.E.L.D." PaleyFest board that the journalists can peruse the screenplays for up and coming Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to know where the universe is going, which enabled them to shape an arrangement for the show through the finish of a third season. On May 8, 2014, the arrangement was reestablished for a second period of 22 scenes. 

In July 2014, Clark Gregg expressed that the season resumes a very long time after the finish of season one, and "the stupendous idea of [rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D.] is made extremely obvious very quickly, in light of the fact that you understand everyoneÃ¢ÂÂUS government, US military and different wiseÃ¢ÂÂwants to capture us. S.H.I.E.L.D's. unlawful. We have not many assets. All that we will do includes managing, as yet, discovering who's Hydra and who's not among our companions. To reconstruct S.H.I.E.L.D., we're going to require some old companions to substantiate themselves, some new companions, and we will need to do it such that's back rear way, old school." 

In September 2014, discussing whether the closure of the period would likewise be a wonderful end to the arrangement, Bell said "we're not considering it an arrangement finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some force coming in [to season 2] and I think we get on it. I'm hopeful that we can keep the plane noticeable all around somewhat more." He likewise discussed whether the subjects of family and connectedness from the primary season would be re-investigated in the second, saying "What we generally search for are the human components in the issue on everyone's mind. That is the thing that TV progresses nicely, it makes you care about individuals, and whether it's exacting family or whenever you have a group of individuals cooperating, it takes on a type of family allegory." Bell repeated the possibility of family following the finish of the period, saying "From numerous points of view, the entire analogy at the core of the show is familyÃ¢ÂÂyou have Coulson and May and afterward a pack of more youthful individuals, and it enables us to play out various elements; truly, this season, we had Skye's natural guardians versus her surrogate guardians. What's more, in the meantime, we had Skye growing up. We made them go from a somewhat sulky programmer season one to preparing to turn into a specialist to turning into our first undeniable hero thus as we grow up, we separate from our folks... In our psyches, her mother wasn't a scoundrel so much; she was an enemy, yet in the event that you take a gander at why she feels the manner in which she does, Jiaying truly earned that position." Discussing the uncover that Skye is really Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen clarified thatJohnson is a character that we constantly enjoyed. We generally knew there was a possibility to develop Skye into something different. It required a smidgen of investment, however we were glad when we had the capacity to arrive on Daisy Johnson, and really have that work in our folklore. In any case, as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our very own turn to it. So we are somewhat consolidating a couple of ideas and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her advance as an individual, we've developed to like her as an individual, we've seen her advance as a specialist. What's more, presently, at last conveying her to her inception storyÃ¢ÂÂI believe there's only significantly increasingly passionate load to it, since you definitely know her as just Skye, and now she will have this capacity that she may not comprehend, that she may not need ... We're going to concentrate on Skye, and how that influences the general population around her, and how the connections may move. Since we've seen through the course of our arrangement up until now; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or sees them, and they're classified, things like that. I don't get that's meaning when one of your own is currently viewed as somebody with a capacity? How would you sort her?Whedon explained that "We're going to walk her through the means of finding what this truly means, and grappling with it. All that stuff is truly fascinating to us, and in TV, since we have sufficient energy to investigate, we can take her starting point on a wide range of various ways." Additionally, Whedon discussed how the character would be alluded to on the show after the uncover, saying, "She's still Skye, in light of the fact that "she" supposes she's Skye. I think her father believes she's Daisy, and we'll check whether she ever comes to the heart of the matter where she trusts that that is something that she would need to call herself. Yet, at this moment, she has her own personality." 

In December 2014, Jed Whedon clarified the advantages of presenting a general public of superhuman characters in the Inhumans, saying "Something that, at an opportune time was imperative to us last season was, there were so few individuals in the Cinematic Universe who had powers. Extremely, just two people had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We must be very responsibleÃ¢ÂÂwe would not like to jump into this show and have another one consistently, and have it feel like we ignored everything that they invested quite a lot of cash and energy working in the movies. Along those equivalent lines, the cause of a power is dependably a complex thingÃ¢ÂÂMarvel thinks about it feeling grounded, it feeling logical at some dimension. Indeed, even on "Thor", he says, "In our reality, enchantment and science are something very similar." So this is a route for us to kind of open up our reality. It's an approach to present, into the MCU, the possibility that individuals can be brought into the world with a power. They don't need to be built in a lab, they don't need some oddity mishap with a tank of corrosive. They can be brought into the world with this. That is kind of a gamechanger, on our show, however in the true to life universe". 

After the season finale, Bell discussed Coulson losing his arm, saying that "he paid a priceÃ¢ÂÂthat was imperative to us. You don't upset the powers of nature without getting chomped, and the way that he truly spared everybody on the ship by that precious stone not breaking was a superb, chivalrous thing and demonstrated to you that on a fundamental level, Coulson is a courageous man whose activities back up his words." Bell additionally discussed the cliffhanger including Simmons being consumed by a Kree stone monument: "When we initially begun discussing the Monolith, we realized that it expected to show a risk and we expected to exhibit a portion of that danger and the guarantee of more story... It's anything but difficult to execute a character for stun esteem or whatever, and we had various passings this season, however ... we want to abandon you with something to discuss, to leave with. This is something that surfaced in the room, we discussed what it implied ... Getting Fitz and SimmonsÃ¢ÂÂwho had been one personÃ¢ÂÂto turned out to be two entire individuals, return together, consent to go out on the town, and after that have this occur, felt flawlessly beautiful". 

All essential cast individuals from the principal season (Gregg as Phil Coulson, Ming-Na Wen as Melinda May, Brett Dalton as Grant Ward, Chloe Bennet as Skye, Iain De Caestecker as Leo Fitz, and Elizabeth Henstridge as Jemma Simmons) returned for the second season, and were joined by Nick Blood as Lance Hunter.

Amid the season, the makers worked with Glenn Hetrick of Optic Nerve Studios to help make Raina's Inhuman look, and acquaint the Inhumans with the MCU. To get to the last look, the authors invested a great deal of energy examining what her changed look would involve, for example, in the event that she would have a nose, or a tail, with arrangement essayist Drew Greenberg in the long run recommending thistles. With the structure thought close by, Hetrick and his group started assembling potential plans for the character, looking to the Clive Barker film "Nightbreed", explicitly the character Shuna Sassi, in light of the fact that "She's an animal shrouded in porcupine plumes and that picture is so solid Ã¢ÂÂ it makes such a striking outline". Since Hetrick and his group did not have source material to pull from in the funnies, he needed to "make her vibe like the principal genuine Inhuman" and give her face a dimension of symmetry. While making the prosthetic cosmetics, which was done in about fourteen days, the makers needed to in any case have the capacity to see Negga's eyes, with Bell saying, "Ruth Negga has incredibly expressive eyes and eyebrows. Furthermore, she gets such a large amount of who Raina is through the eyes. We needed her to at present have the capacity to impart, regardless we needed you to feel her appearances through all of [the makeup]." 

For the "genuine S.H.I.E.L.D." group presented this season, the makers and Marvel chose to make another S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, to separate from the typical one utilized on the arrangement. This new logo utilizes the state of Captain America's unique shield, instead of the refreshed round shape, and has 3 stars on it. 

Creation on the season started in late July 2014, in Culver City, California. Extra photography occurred far and wide, incorporating into Old San Juan, Puerto Rico for "...Ye Who Enter Here" and "What They Become". 

To mirror the darker tone of the second season, the standard symphony was changed from season one, with the low metal and strings extended, and the woodwind area diminished, "giving [the orchestra] included punch and hazard." Composer Bear McCreary's utilization of the electric guitar was additionally decreased for the second season, while his general synth writing computer programs was changed from "warm, round tones" to "disfigured under substantial twisting" sound. 

McCreary presented another Hydra subject for the season, clarifying that "Last season got pretty musically confounded. I had a subject that related itself with Centipede, The Clairvoyant, John Garrett and Raina. That topic at last worked like a Hydra Theme. I had a subject for Victoria Hand that, while the group of onlookers quickly speculated her, additionally worked as the Hydra Theme. I had a[nother] subject for Garrett that likewise acted like the topic for Hydra. It got so entangled ... The appropriate response was self-evident: I expected to compose another Hydra Theme, one that could be related with Dr. Whitehall." For Hayley Atwell's appearances as Peggy Carter, McCreary chose to cite the Agent Carter subject created by Christopher Lennertz for the "Operator Carter" short film. On utilizing Lennertz's topic, McCreary stated, "I was energized for the chance to consolidate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, since it further bonds the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe together as a cognizant entire ... Chris was excited and sent me his scores for reference." A soundtrack including music from the first and second seasons was discharged by Marvel Music carefully on September 4, 2015, and on CD in October 2015. 

Official maker Maurissa Tancharoen expressed the generation group was not precluding making hybrid scenes with "Operator Carter" or "Gatekeepers of the Galaxy" amid the season, with official maker Jed Whedon including that any such scenes would not rise to the scale found in the "" hybrid from the principal season, saying, "as far as distinct advantages, [those scenes are] difficult to beat." Bell later said "" "is coming up and we realize what's new with that and anticipate seeing it, yet it's entirely cool to discover approaches to tie-in stuff and associate things." In December 2014, ABC affirmed the arrangement would connect to "Justice fighters: Age of Ultron", with Whedon saying, "You ought to anticipate something. "The Avengers" is the enormous tent that every one of the establishments play under. Clearly, we're incorporated into that." The scenes "The Frenemy of My Enemy" and "The Dirty Half Dozen" highlight "Easter eggs, plot strings and other connective tissue driving into the opening scene of "Justice fighters: Age of Ultron"" while "Scars" investigates the fallout of the film. 

Chatting on how the season would cooperate with "Specialist Carter", Bell stated, "This is what I believe is intriguing. "Specialist Carter" is by all accounts about S.S.R. pre-S.H.I.E.L.D., yet about the beginnings of something, and the fundamental estimations of that. S.H.I.E.L.D. got exploded a year ago and what Coulson constantly needed was an arrival to nuts and bolts, and it offers us a chance to come back to a portion of those fundamental beliefs and even physically, a portion of that S.S.R. stuff has a method for discovering its way into our demonstrate that could be cool. At any rate we can integrate things, we're going to endeavor to do it, however it is hard when the narratives are 60 years separated." Several scenes in "Shadows" and "The Things We Bury" are flashbacks highlighting Peggy Carter which fill in as a prologue to the universe of "Specialist Carter", setting up characters and thoughts for that arrangement, incorporating Carter's faith in the requirement for "a changeless unit amid peacetime", which will prompt the formation of S.H.I.E.L.D. The scene "Making Friends and Influencing People" names Hydra's capacity to mentally program individuals as the Faustus Method, named for the character who shows up, as Johann Fennhoff, in "Specialist Carter", played by Ralph Brown. 

The season affirms that the blue outsider found in the primary season, and a common plot point this season, was an individual from the Kree race, who assume a critical job in "Gatekeepers of the Galaxy". Whedon clarified that "We clearly demonstrated this body a year back at around this time. When we were breaking that and sussing out what this circular segment would be, we needed to have a ton of the pieces set up from the get go ... we needed to converse with highlights about what their arrangements were and where they were going." When asked whether this includes as the arrangement attach in to "Watchmen of the Galaxy", Whedon said "It is a distant other system, so it's somewhat harder to have one of them stroll into our set, so an immediate tie-in is somewhat all the more testing, yet it's each of the one universe, so there's dependably open door for additional. ... In "Watchmen", we saw parts in our universe that we hadn't investigated yet, so it demonstrates we're a piece of that as well." This storyline additionally acquaints the Inhumans with the MCU, in front of their own film. 

Toward the finish of the period, Bell expressed in transit that the season had connected to the movies, "we got the chance to be our own show and recount to our very own accounts in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and complete a pleasant hand off or a tie-in, however nor are officeholder upon the other to be a pursue, and I imagine that is an extraordinary model for us." 

In June 2014, Clark Gregg expressed he trusted the season would be appeared in a square of 10 scenes, at that point breaking for "Operator Carter", before airing the rest of the 12. Clarifying this choice, Bell stated, One of our difficulties a year ago was to create 22 scenes that broadcast over, what, 40 weeks? 36 weeks? Something to that effect. What's more, the period of re-runs is dead. Re-runs are demise, as you're attempting to focus on the propensity for the show and [viewers] check out something different or a re-run and they'll get irritated. They'll leave. What this enables us to do is limit rehashes. We're indicating ten scenes, and there must be a hole or two since it's physically difficult to deliver ten shows and traverse after generation in time, we can't do that so there will be a Marvel exceptional sooner or later. Be that as it may, basically consistently you're appearing and we're there, and after that rather than a continue appearing mid-run and losing energy, "Operator Carter" comes in and has its own cool stuff, and they're running two months straight, at that point we can return and run twelve of every a line without any intrusions. Regardless we're delivering our demonstrate each week however it just gives us time, scarcely, to complete 22 on timetable. It takes out the requirement for rehashes in the back half. 

The season started airing on September 23, 2014, on ABC in the United States, and on CTV in Canada, and closed on May 12, 2015. In Australia, the season appeared on September 29, 2014, on Seven Network, while Channel 4 in the United Kingdom debuted the season on October 24, 2014.

The diverse specialists were by and by picked to make the secret publications, in light of their past work and how it associated with the topics and feeling of the planned scene. On how what is appeared every publication is picked, Bell stated, "possibly we'll demonstrate [the artist] the content or let them watch the scene and let them react to it candidly and see what's intriguing to them. And afterward we have a discussion with them about how we'd like to depict that, and after that we endeavor to incline toward the qualities that they have. Some are increasingly realistic, some are more character based, some are progressively composite, and some are more clean. Furthermore, that is something [the producers] truly anticipate every week, recovering the underlying portrayals from the specialists and seeing their elucidation." The craftsmanship by and by showed up as variation spreads to choose titles distributed by Marvel Comics in June 2015. 

The blurb for "Consequential convulsions", made by Gabriele Dell'Otto, the co-maker of Daisy Johnson, delineates Skye twice, as she is changing from the Terrigen fog and as the individual managing her forces, just as a changed Raina, Coulson and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo out of sight.

What's more, it additionally goes to the way that she's been mimicking other individuals as she did with Agent May." 

"One Door Closes", a scene concentrated on Bobbi Morse's history, got a publication of her with the "genuine S.H.I.E.L.D." logo, that "grasped the fundamentals" of four-shading printing, using maroon, cyan, dark and yellow, while as yet having layers and confusions, much like the character of Morse. The publication was structured by Delicious Design League. The blurb for "Existence in the wake of death" by Dave Johnson, features the separation inside S.H.I.E.L.D. what's more, the unions on each side. With Coulson in the center, Agents Gonzales, Morse, Mackenzie and Weaver originate from the "genuine S.H.I.E.L.D.", while Hunter, Fitz and Simmons come from the other. "Melinda"s notice, by Jenny Frison, reflected the focal point of the scene by unmistakably including a picture of May, featuring her backstory and why she is classified "the Cavalry".

James Hunt, likewise for "Nook of Geek", gave a positive audit too, expressing "The force of last season's finale hasn't been lost, and to be sure, it's even been added to. A year ago I reprimanded the pilot scene for, to the exclusion of everything else, neglecting to reproduce the vibe of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Oliver Sava of "The A.V. Club" reviewed the scene a 'B-', feeling that "With an unmistakably characterized scalawag and statement of purpose, this present show's second season is as of now off to a superior begin than its first year, however there's still a lot of space for the arrangement to develop. The contents could utilize more vitality, the activity could be better arranged, and it could utilize a gigantic infusion of style for both the visual and sound components. There's such a great amount of potential in "Specialists Of S.H.I.E.L.D." ... be that as it may, the show's makers aren't completely investigating it yet." 

Toward the finish of the period, Goldman reviewed it a 8.2 out of 10, saying the season "found the show much-improved, as it moved quicker and dug further into the Marvel Cinematic Universe."

He likewise commended the portrayal improvement and called the season "less controlled" in associating with its funnies roots.

He criticized a portion of the story heading, feeling that it took some time for the Inhumans to interface with the remainder of the arrangement, and that the way the "Time of Ultron" tie-in finished up the S.H.I.E.L.D. versus S.H.I.E.L.D. storyline was "hurried and rough". 

The season's presentation of the Inhumans and clear eagerness to set up new standards in front of the movies has been featured by pundits: 

Sava felt that having the arrangement present the race made "Specialists of S.H.I.E.L.D." "a basic piece of Marvel Studios' greater designs for the future", clarifying that "the arrangement has turned out to be increasingly more associated with the bigger MCU since "Commander America: The Winter Soldier", however it's dependably been in a responsive job. Stuff occurs in the films, and "Specialists Of S.H.I.E.L.D." manages the aftermath. Not any longer. This show is getting things going, and these occasions will unmistakably affect the fate of the MCU on the grounds that we know there's an "Inhumans" motion picture made arrangements for 2019." Sava likewise referenced that presenting the Inhumans "on an individual dimension instead of an infinite dimension" by means of the TV arrangement makes "the entire thought somewhat simpler to swallow" for the general MCU gathering of people. 

Merrill Barr of "Forbes" believed that by not just presenting the Inhumans in front of the film, however by delineating the spreading of the race all through the world, was a piece of the arrangement establishing its "entitlement to exist" aside from the movies. Discussing the season finale, Barr stated, ""S.H.I.E.L.D." completes a most magnificent activity of remaining alone two feet in a manner we've never observed it do. Come the last edge, all anybody Ã¢ÂÂ Marvel fan or generally Ã¢ÂÂ will ask is when season three starts. The note the show leaves watchers on is one that will influence them to acknowledge, maybe out of the blue, that the voyage of "Operators of S.H.I.E.L.D." isn't just justified, despite all the trouble now, yet maybe dependably has been."
