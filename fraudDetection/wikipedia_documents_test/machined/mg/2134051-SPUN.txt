Bregowine 

Bregowine (kicked the bucket August 764) was a medieval Archbishop of Canterbury. Little is known about his beginnings or his exercises as diocese supervisor, in spite of the fact that various stories were told about his conceivable inceptions after the Norman success in 1066. There are no records of him before his getting to be diocese supervisor. He perhaps owed his rise to the Kentish ruler. The records after his height to Canterbury are primarily about disagreements regarding land, however learning of his time in office is hampered by the annihilation of huge numbers of the contemporary records. After his demise, he was viewed as a holy person and a real existence about him was written in the 12thÃ¢Â century. 

Different stories have been told about Bregowine's inceptions, including that he was an aristocrat and a mainland Saxon who changed over to Christianity and came to Canterbury in light of the pious notoriety of Theodore of Tarsus. Others state that he owed his rise to King ÄÂthelbert II of Kent, yet every one of these accounts lay on works that were composed after the Norman success of England in 1066. There are no contemporary records of Bregowine before he was ecclesiastical overseer. It doesn't show up, nonetheless, that he was of Mercian starting points like his antecedents Tatwin and Nothhelm. 

Whatever his childhood, Bregowine was sanctified as diocese supervisor on 27ÃÂ SeptemberÃÂ 761. His decision occurred in a short period when Kent was free of Mercian predominance somewhere in the range of 756 and 764, so the story that he owed his race to ÄÂthelbert fits with the time allotment. He composed letters to Archbishop Lul of Mainz which still exist, and which talk about a prior gathering between the two men. Different exercises as diocese supervisor are recorded in enduring sanctions. One records that he challenged at the passing of a congregation at Cookham that was appropriated by King Cynewulf of Wessex at some point after 760. Another enduring contract from Dunwald, a thegn of King ÄÂthelbert, concerning land in Canterbury, records that Bregowine assented to the endowment of land. Shockingly, a significant number of the early contracts of the ward of Canterbury are lost, which confines information of Bregowine's exercises as ecclesiastical overseer. 

Bregowine passed on in 764 and was initially covered in the baptistry in Canterbury, yet his remaining parts were moved to the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in 1123. This chased after an endeavor in 1121 to expel his remaining parts to another cloister, which came to nothing. The remaining parts were set by the special raised area of St Gregory in the south transept, in the wake of having been quickly put in the north transept. Bregowine was later viewed as a holy person, with a dining experience day of 26ÃÂ August, in spite of the fact that Florence of Worcester, a twelfth century author, recorded his demise date as 24ÃÂ August. Different sources record the passing date as 25ÃÂ August. His life was later composed by Eadmer in the 12thÃ¢Â century.
