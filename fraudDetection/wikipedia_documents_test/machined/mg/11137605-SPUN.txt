Jacobs shows up as Donna in a two-section hybrid scene with "Holby City" sister appear, "Setback", initially communicate in March 2019. 

Jacobs was given a role as Donna following leaving show school, and views herself as "totally honored" for having won the job. She was thrown close by individual arrangement six newcomer Kelly Adams, as maternity specialist Mickie Hendrie. A BBC narrative entitled "Making It at Holby" chronicled their throwing procedure, which involved seven weeks of tryouts, including bunch workshops to enable the arrangement makers to measure competitors' identities. Adams initially tried out as Donna, anyway the throwing executives felt that she would be more qualified to Mickie, the calmer character, and "amiable" partner to Donna's "cheeky staff nurture". She and Jacobs were matched together amid a three-hour workshop, and the makers identified a "moment sparkle" between them, prompting their double throwing. Following her fruitful tryout, Jacobs was tutored by performing artist Jan Pearson, who played ward sister Kath Fox. 

Jacobs described Donna as "a common laborers tart". Upon her entry in the program, Donna was said to be an ongoing college alumni. Lacking profession desire, she chose nursing as the most energizing job accessible to her, wanting to meet a well off specialist. The BBC expressed that, in spite of her absence of desire, Donna was probably going to prevail on her picked profession way because of her affinity to "arrive on her feet". On the arrangement's legitimate site, Donna was depicted as a gathering young lady with a "wild-youngster notoriety". Her negative attributes included being effectively driven and materialistic, effectively exhausted, and "blunt, obstinate and apathetic". The site additionally featured her assurance to "live to the full", her carefree and straight-talking nature, grit, trustworthiness and devotion, and the way that "her heart's in the perfect spot." 

Donna's ensemble at first included short skirts, tight-fitting tops, multi-hued hair augmentations and a nose-stud. Jacobs, who influenced a Bristolian complement for the job, remarked that Donna had "no feeling of what she should keep concealed." A size 12, Jacobs was not constrained to get in shape for the job, and considered Donna's figure "some portion of her loveable appeal". In early scenes, the character apparently partaked in recreational medication use and land for work hungover. Jacobs portrayed her as "everything that you covertly need to be, yet can't pull off in typical society", calling her "exceptionally gregarious" and resistant to developing. "The Guardian" Grace Dent regarded her "feeble willed" in a 2006 component on TV doctors, and in 2008, the "Day by day Mirror" Jane Simon marked her unintelligent. 

A 2006 audit by Simon noticed that Donna needed commitment to her activity, and was effectively diverted by her affection life. Following an April 2008 meeting with Jacobs, the itv.com site for the amusement show "This Morning" saw that in spite of Donna's "disorganized" individual life, she had developed progressively genuine about her work. At last, receiving her half-niece Mia constrained Donna to grow up, focussing on her profession by achieving advancement to ward sister and tolerating the resultant obligations. Considering Donna's improvement in January 2011, Jacobs saw that she had changed a lot from her initial days, when she was utilized as a hilarious character with "blundering jokes", into a genuine, increasingly capable individual. 

At the point when Donna returned in 2017, Jacobs charged her character as "coquettish, reckless and courageous", while Simon Harper, the show's acting official maker, portrayed Donna as "sparky [and] flippant". Jacobs revealed to Jessica Ransom of "What's on TV" that despite the fact that Donna has developed since her flight in 2011, she is "still just Donna Jackson". She outlined Donna as "such a stunned, peculiar, mental character." Jacobs affirmed that Donna keeps on being coy upon her arrival, since it is as a part of her identity. Sarah Deen, composing for the "Metro", marked the character a "coy, feisty hurricane" and portrayed her as "gutsy and bubbly". Thinking about Donna's character improvement among leaving and returning, Jacobs remarked, "Before she was a young lady in her 20s who was centered around affection and men, and now she has two kids so her life is much more youngster centered." She added that Donna attempts to concentrate on her maturer way of life while keeping up the way of life she had when she was more youthful. Jacobs expressed that Donna's outfit mirrored that and opined that her dress sense had "relapsed" since her flight. A BBC Online patron described Donna as "a cheeky, carefree medical caretaker and a much needed refresher." They expressed that Donna can voice her assessments since she talks in a silly tone. The columnist added that Donna came back to the nursing calling "somewhat worldlier" than previously. 

Donna was raised by her grandma Shirley (Lynda Baron), who shows up in the arrangement eight scene "Ill will". Clarke Peters, star of American dramatization arrangement "The Wire", was given a role as her irritated dad in 2009. He showed up from 14 July to 11 August 2009, experiencing malignant growth of the splenic flexure, pancreas and stomach divider. Jacobs was "excited" by Peters' throwing, and revealed that his first appearance rendered the program's group "captivated" without precedent for her five years on the show.

Diminishes evaluated that his appearance had a "colossal effect" on Donna, clarifying that his job enabled the gathering of people to find progressively about her life, as: "This is an approach to get into these characters as opposed to simply considering them to be one-dimensional characters, managing whatever occurs at Holby." Producers Diana Kyle and Tony McHale expected the storyline to uncover another side to Donna, portraying her endeavoring to adapt, as opposed to the "grinning party young lady" watchers knew about. 

Following her dad's demise, Donna received her half-niece Mia. Talking about the improvement with regards to her 2010 "Loss" appearance, Jacobs clarified that it made her ED move especially upsetting as "she currently has little Mia to care for Ã¢ÂÂ on the off chance that anything happens to Donna, Mia is totally without anyone else." She extended that, "The stakes have truly proceeded onward for Donna in the course of the most recent few years. She's needed to acknowledge some obligation and it's not currently pretty much which man she's resting with straightaway". 

Lastingly "unfortunate in adoration", Donna fits the tart with a heart generalization. Her various sentiments amid her residency earned her the epithet "Medical caretaker 'Activity' Jackson". In 2004, she had a lesbian contact with Mickie. The scene in which they kissed was altered to a large portion of its unique length subsequent to being esteemed unreasonably unequivocal for pre-watershed communicate. Soon thereafter, Jacobs expressed that her optimal storyline would be for Donna to locate a decent man and addition an advancement, trusting she would discover somebody who might treat her well and help her surrender her recreational medication propensity. Her adoration advantages included physiotherapist Justin Fuller, recorders Ed Keating (Rocky Marshall) and Mubbs Hussein (Ian Aspinall), chief Bradley Hume, senior house officer Sean Thompson (Chinna Wodu), and an affection triangle with wedded advisor Michael Spence and his cardiothoracic partner Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing). In spite of the fact that Michael did not at first reveal to Donna that he was hitched, Jacobs expressed that her character knew about this "where it counts", yet was tragically unperturbed. He treated her severely, to the point that he would just engage in sexual relations with her in a latrine slow down; in any case Jacobs surveyed that Donna was infatuated with him, trusting him to be "the one" and not quite the same as her past darlings, marking her misled in this regard. 

In a November 2007 article for the "Day by day Mirror", TV pundit Jim Shelley portrayed Donna as a "nymphomaniac", however qualified his remark with the addendum "to be reasonable, sex compulsion is a vocation necessity in "Holby"." His "Mirror" partner Simon marked Donna remarkably unsubtle in her quest for Michael, esteeming her "resilient", and in a later piece for "The Guardian", Shelley remarked on Donna's proclivity for laying down with ranking staff individuals at untimely minutes, to the hindrance of patient consideration. She was named "man insane" by Tina Miles of the "Liverpool Echo", and "improper" by the "Mirror" Clare Raymond, who noticed that she would "persevere relentlessly to catch a rich specialist". 

In spite of her various intimate moments, Donna did not have a truly sentimental storyline until starting a moderate consuming sentiment with organization nurture Kieran Callaghan in late 2010. She at first disdained him, associating him with evading his work obligations, and at one point mentioned that he stay away for the indefinite future to her ward. Jacobs surveyed that Donna was pulled in to him, yet would not enable herself to acknowledge it at first, having had such a significant number of fizzled associations with men illsuited to her. They proceeded to start a relationship, with Jacobs portraying Kieran as "Donna's blessing from heaven", and co-star Sloane esteeming the two an "extraordinary match". Their relationship was obstructed by Kieran's pledge to the TA and voyage through obligation in Afghanistan. Sloane felt that Kieran did not adequately clarify the degree of his association with the TA, and surveyed that Donna neglected to comprehend his "warrior attitude", expressing that their issues originated from a shared tenacity. Following Kieran's sending, TV magazine "What's on TV" noticed an adjustment in Donna's attitude, seeing that she had "soured" rather than her previous "bubbly" kind disposition.

When she returns, Donna has turned into a footballer's significant other in the wake of wedding footballer Jared Baptiste (Leon Lopez). Jacobs clarified that Donna and Jared share a troublesome relationship since Donna has "wedded into a way of life without acknowledging it." Donna and Jared have a tyke, Amber Baptiste, which Jacobs thought was decent for Donna's character advancement. Donna considers Mia and Amber her top need; on this, BBC Online supporter remarked, "She would successfully give her two young ladies all they need throughout everyday life." Deen ("Metro") saw that Donna has received "another showy way of life" since leaving Holby. Jacobs expressed that regardless of her developed way of life, Donna would keep on being coquettish. She likewise affirmed that Donna would not have an affection intrigue, which she detested. The performer trusted that Donna would be given an adoration enthusiasm in the wake of getting to be restored inside the arrangement. 

Jacobs left from "Holby City" in 2011, needing to "widen [her] skylines" following seven years in the program. The thirteenth arrangement saw the takeoff of numerous standard cast individuals, and the entry of a gathering of new ones, including Guy Henry, Laila Rouass, and Jimmy Akingbola. Jacobs esteemed it "another period with another cast", one which she was not part of, and expressed that the time felt ideal to leave. She had some contribution to her leave storyline, the point of convergence of which was Donna's association with Kieran, as they moved away to start another coexistence. Jacobs transferred criticism she had gotten from the overall population with respect to how Donna should leave, and this was joined into her flight. The performer felt individual strain to get Donna's last scenes right, needing to give the most ideal execution. She found the recording "overpowering", clarifying "it was staggeringly enthusiastic and exceptional, and it made everything extremely hard, and crude. [...] It wasn't until later that I understood I'd put myself under a terribly distressing circumstance, and that I should simply be getting a charge out of the experience." She expressed: "I've completely cherished playing Donna. I realize that I'm going to think back in all respects affectionately on the time I had with her. I truly became acquainted with the character, and she had such a large number of aspects and was constantly amusing to play."

Donna guarantees that she is coming back to the nursing calling as a "Decent Samaritan", following her marriage to a footballer. Notwithstanding, it was prodded that her purposes behind returning may not be valid.

Deen ("Metro") believed that Donna's blunt identity would be "the exact opposite thing the Holby staff need right now". Donna attempts to help the environment, in spite of the fact that her perky persona is observed to be wrong in the conditions. Jacobs clarified that Donna is "making a decent attempt" and that she "needs everything to work out so seriously" in light of the fact that she appreciates being at the emergency clinic.

Jacobs and Walkinshaw recently featured together on "Waterloo Road" as a wedded couple so they share a decent relationship. The performing artist additionally affirmed that Donna and Fletch would not start a relationship. 

The explanations behind Donna's arrival are unexplained for a few scenes. In any case, Donna returns more extravagant than she left, which Jacobs thought was "extremely not normal for Donna".
