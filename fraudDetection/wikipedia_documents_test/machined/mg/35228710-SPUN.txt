Activity of 24 October 1793 

The Action of 24 October 1793 was a minor maritime commitment amid the main year of the French Revolutionary Wars. While cruising in the Northern Bay of Biscay, the British Royal Navy frigate HMS "Thames", under Captain James Cotes, experienced the a lot bigger French frigate "Uranie", under Captain Jean-FranÄÂ§ois Tartu. The boats drew in, with each enduring extreme harm until they isolated after about four hours of persistent battle. Cotes requested his group to make hurried fixes, planning to continue the fight, however "Uranie"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s team, with their commander dead, disappeared while "Thames" was unfit to move. At 16:00, with fixes on "Thames" continuous, a French squadron of three frigates and a brig, under Captain Zacharie Allemand, arrived, terminating on "Thames" as they drew closer. Dwarfed, Cotes surrendered his ship to Allemand, who lauded Cotes on his protection from the far bigger "Uranie". 

The French brought "Thames" into Brest, where mariners from Allemand's squadron plundered the frigate. The British officers were detained for the following two years. The frigate was authorized into the French Navy as "Tamise", and "Uranie" was renamed "Tartu" to pay tribute to her perished chief. The two vessels at that point presented with the French Atlantic Fleet, "Tamise" until 8 June 1796, when the British recovered her off the Scilly Isles, and "Tartu" until 30 December 1796 when the British caught her amid the "ExpÄÅ¡dition d'Irlande". 

In February 1793, in the midst of rising political strain, the French Republic proclaimed war on Great Britain, drawing Britain into the French Revolutionary Wars. Adrift, the Bay of Biscay, the Western Approaches and the English Channel all progressed toward becoming zones of noteworthy maritime action as French privateers cruised on attacking travels against British vendor shipping. To enlarge these assaults, the French maritime specialists dispatched squadrons of frigates to assault British exchange courses. To counter these tasks, the Royal Navy sent their own frigates to ocean, now and again in squadrons and some of the time on single watches. 

A French frigate squadron sent to on a voyage in the Northern Bay of Biscay in the early pre-winter of 1793 was told by Captain Zacharie Allemand and comprised of the frigates "Carmagnole", "RÄÅ¡solue", "SÄÅ¡millante" and "Uranie" with the brig-corvette "EspiÄÂ¨gle". On 22 October, the squadron located the 16-weapon Spanish brig "Alcoudia" and Allemand requested "Uranie" under Captain Jean-FranÄÂ§ois Tartu to isolate from the squadron and seek after the Spaniard. "Uranie" was effectively ready to catch "Alcoudia", accepting the detainees the frigate and building up a prize team on the brig. After two days, "Uranie" was cruising southwards in organization with the prize with the breeze at the southwest, when a sail appeared toward the north at 09:30. 

The fresh introduction was a British ship sent from the Channel Fleet on a solitary watch: the frigate HMS "Thames" under Captain James Cotes. "Thames" was an old frigate, worked in 1758 and conveying 32 12-pounder weapons. The ship was beneath its standard supplement of 215 men, cruising with just 184, which implied that the 6-pounder weapons that expanded the fundamental battery couldn't be kept an eye on. By correlation, "Uranie" was five years of age and conveyed 40 18-pounder firearms and weighing practically twofold the heaviness of the British ship. Her full supplement was of 260 men, however she needed 60 of her mariners, dispatched in prize teams more than three caught delivers, and was troubled with more than 260 detainees. At first uncertain of the character of the ship toward the north, Tartu lifted a blue banner as a distinguishing proof flag and sent the "Alcoudia" away on the off chance that the ship ought to be uncovered to be unfriendly. Cotes did not react to the flag, and the two boats were before long avoided each other by a downpour squall. 

At 10:15 the climate cleared, leaving the two frigates well in sight of each other, both Tartu and Cotes distinguishing the contradicting ship as a foe and clearing for activity, Tartu raising the French tricolor. With the two chiefs decided on fight, the frigates moved toward each other quickly on contradicting tacks. "Uranie" was the first to flame, releasing a full broadside at "Thames" and after that wearing around to pull close by "Thames" on a similar tack. The move put the two frigates legitimately nearby each other and a nearby commitment started, each releasing broadside after broadside at the another. At 12:15, a round shot cleared "Uranie"s quarterdeck, slaughtering a helmsman, slicing a kid down the middle, injuring another, and separating Tartu's leg under the knee; Tartu was brought beneath deck and Lieutenant Wuibert accepted direction of "Uranie". The battle proceeded as such for a few hours, until 14:20, when "Uranie" had the capacity to pull in front of "Thames" and flame a few broadsides into the bows of the British ship, raking her. English history specialist William James recorded that the group of "Uranie" at that point endeavored to board by means of the starboard bow of "Thames", however were driven off by shoot from Cotes' bow firearms, which had been doubleÃ¢ÂÂshotted hence. Anyway the after activity report by Lieutenant Wuibert on "Uranie" states that no boarding activity was endeavored. 

With the boarding endeavor upset "Uranie" pulled back, swinging southwards to put separate between the vessels. Tartu, brought underneath deck and biting the dust, had requested a retreat for dread that his detainees would revolt and on the grounds that the commitment was drifiting in the east-north-east course, where two sails, thought to be British warships, had been located. It was accepted on "Thames" that the French ship was withdrawing, the British group cheering as the terminating stopped. Cotes anyway foreseen a resumption of the activity and requested his men to start making fixes promptly: "Thames" was so gravely harmed that interest was not feasible. Each of the three of "Thames"<nowiki>'</nowiki> poles had been shot through, the majority of the gear had been torn away, the frame and decks were gravely harmed and 34 men were murdered or injured. "Uranie" was in a comparable state, and pulled up around away, the poles unblemished yet harmed with the vast majority of the apparatus shot through and various gaps crushed through the structure. It was likewise apparent on "Thames" that the group of the French ship were siphoning water over the side, a sign that the ship had been harmed beneath the waterline. 

Cotes' ship was fit just to cruise with the breeze, and the chief asked his men to attempt more noteworthy endeavors to fix their ship before "Uranie" could think of them once more. So engaged was the British team with their fixes that it was not until 16:00 that it was understood that the French frigate was never again holding station inside sight, and had totally vanished. This drove some on the British ship to accept that "Uranie" had sunk, in spite of the fact that in certainty the ship had basically dismissed with an end goal to make it back to Rochefort to fix the harm endured in the commitment. Additionally obvious were various sails out there. These quickly drew nearer and were uncovered to be a frigate squadron flying the Union Flag. Cotes was unfit to move his ship or react to the fresh debuts, which were before long distinguished as French vessels wearing false banners. The main frigate dismantled up near "Thames" and terminated a broadside at the British frigate. Cotes quickly hailed the French, declaring that he was in no situation to battle them because of the harm his ship had endured and that he was striking his banner. 

Allemand mentioned that Cotes get on "Carmagnole", yet Cotes reacted that he was unfit to do as such as his ship's vessels had all been demolished. Allemand sent a pontoon from his own ship to "Thames" and conveyed Cotes to "Carmagnole" as a captive; Cotes utilized the postponement to devastate his ship's records. Allemand examined Cotes eagerly regarding the idea of his ongoing battle and, on recognizing "Uranie" as one of his own squadron, remarked that Tartu ought to have crushed "Thames" in a fraction of the time the move had made. 

"Thames" in this way came back to Brest with Allemand's squadron on 25 October, in spite of the fact that the British ship was completely plundered amid the voyage by the French mariners, whose officers were unfit to apply any authority over them. The ship's officers had been expelled, including the specialist, and in this way the British injured did not get therapeutic treatment until the squadron touched base at Brest on 25 October; two consequently passed on, making the complete British passings 13, with 21 injured. Cotes composed a report on the commitment, which he sent to the Admiralty from bondage in Gisors, which the French experts blocked and deferred, with the outcome that the primary updates on "Thames"<nowiki>'</nowiki> destiny did not land in Britain until 7 May 1794. Cotes was soon a short time later traded and came back to Britain, where a court-military researching the loss of "Thames" excused him. A few of his officers were not repatriated be that as it may, staying in French bondage for the following two years. 

"Uranie" lost four slaughtered, including Captain Tartu, and seven injured, including three genuinely, and the frigate touched base at Rochefort soon thereafter, where out of appreciation for the skipper's demise, she was renamed "Tartu". It was consequently inaccurately detailed in Britain that the ship's name was changed to "Tortue" (tortoise) to mask its character subsequent to being crushed by "Thames". "Thames" was taken into French administration as "Tamise", and partook in the Atlantic crusade of May 1794 the next year. The French lost the two frigates in 1796. HMS "Santa Clause Margarita" recovered "Tamise" in a commitment close to the Scilly Isles among British and French frigate squadrons at the Action of 8 June 1796. About a half year later, the ship of the line HMS "Polyphemus" caught "Tartu" on 30 December in the fallout of the deplorable "ExpÄÅ¡dition d'Irlande".
