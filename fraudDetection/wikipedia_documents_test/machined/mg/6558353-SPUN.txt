Joseph's Tomb 

Joseph's Tomb (, "Qever Yosef", , "Qabr YÄºÅ¥suf") is a funerary landmark situated at the eastern access to the valley that isolates Mounts Gerizim and Ebal, 300 meters northwest of Jacob's Well. It lies on the edges of the West Bank city of Nablus, close Tell Balata, the site of Shakmu in the Late Bronze Age and later scriptural Shechem. One scriptural custom recognizes the general zone of Shechem as the resting-spot of the scriptural patriarch Joseph and his two children Ephraim and Manasseh. Numerous areas throughout the years have been seen as the unbelievable internment spot of Joseph. 

Joseph's tomb has been worshiped all through the ages by Samaritans, for whom it is the second holiest site, by Jews, by Christians, and by Muslims, some of whom see it as the area of a nearby medieval sheik Yusef Al-Dwaik. Post-scriptural records with respect to the area of Joseph's Tomb some place around this region date from the earliest starting point of the fourth century AD. The present structure, a little rectangular live with a cenotaph, dates from 1868, and is without any hint of old structure materials. While a few researchers, for example, Kenneth Kitchen and James K. Hoffmeier certify the basic accuracy of the scriptural record of Joseph, others, for example, Donald B. Redford, contend that the story itself has "no premise actually". 

There is no archeological proof building up the tomb as Joseph's, and current grant still can't seem to decide if the present cenotaph is to be related to the antiquated scriptural gravesite. The absence of Jewish or Christian sources preceding the fifth century that notice the tomb demonstrates that before the fourth century it was a Samaritan site. Samaritan sources recount battles among Samaritans and Christians who wished to evacuate Joseph's bones. 

At key focuses in its long history, a site thought to be Joseph's Tomb around there seen serious partisan clash. Samaritans and Christians debating access and title to the site in the early Byzantine time frame regularly occupied with vicious conflicts. After Israel caught the West Bank in 1967, Muslims were restricted from love at the place of worship and it was step by step transformed into a Jewish petition room. Interreligious contact and strife from contending Jewish and Muslim cases over the tomb wound up incessant. In spite of the fact that it fell under the purview of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) following the marking of the Oslo Accords, it stayed under IDF monitor with Muslims precluded from supplicating there. Toward the start of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in 2000, soon after being given over to the PNA, it was plundered and flattened by revolting Palestinian. Following the reoccupation of Nablus amid Israel's Operation Defensive Shield in 2002, Jewish gatherings returned there irregularly. Somewhere in the range of 2009 and 2010 the structure was restored, with another dome introduced, and visits by Jewish admirers have continued. 

The Torah gives four insights about the customs encompassing JosephÃ¢ÂÂs remains. The record in Genesis relates that, before his passing, he had his siblings swear they would complete his bones of Egypt to Canaan. He is then said to have been treated at that point set in a box in Egypt. In Exodus, we are informed that Moses satisfied the vow by taking Joseph's bones with him when he left Egypt. In Joshua, JosephÃ¢ÂÂs bones are said to have been brought from Egypt by the Children of Israel and entombed in Shechem.The bones of Joseph, which the Children of Israel raised out of Egypt, were covered in Shechem in a package of land Jacob purchased from the children of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred bits of silver ("qÄºÂÄÅ¾Ã¡Å¡Â­ÄË").. 

The Bible does not recognize a particular site in Shechem where his bones were let go. The Genesis Rabba, a Jewish content composed c. 400Ã¢ÂÂ450 CE, expresses that an internment site in Shechem is one of three for which the countries of the world can't scorn Israel and state "you have stolen them," it having been obtained by Jacob. The rabbis likewise recommend that Joseph trained his siblings to cover him in Shechem since it was from that point he was taken and sold into servitude. Other Jewish sources have him covered either in Safed, or, as indicated by an aggadic custom, have him entombed at Hebron as indicated by his very own desires. The equivocalness is reflected in Islamic convention which focuses to Nablus just like the bona fide site, however some early Islamic geographers distinguished the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron as lodging his tomb. The Qur'an itself does not make reference to subtleties of Joseph's internment. Ali of Herat (1119), Yaqut (1229) and Ibn Battuta (1369) all monitor both the Nablus and Hebron customs. Later Muslim recorders additionally notice a third site implying to be the bona fide tomb, close Beit Ijza. The Hebron custom is additionally reflected in some medieval Christian sources, for example, the record by Srewulf (CE 1102) who says that "the bones of Joseph were covered more unassumingly than the rest, in a manner of speaking at the furthest point of the palace". 

In spite of the fact that the customary scriptural date for a mind-blowing story and passing spots him in Egypt amidst the Twelfth Dynasty, generally practically identical to the Hyksos attack of Egypt, contemporary grant never again acknowledges such a remote dating. The figure of Joseph itself is frequently taken to be an "embodiment of a clan", as opposed to a memorable individual. 

As indicated by the Bible, Joseph was preserved and covered in a pine box in Egypt, in the wake of having his kin promise to divert his bones. Later midrash recognize his first internment in an illustrious tomb, or as cast into the Nile. Moses is said to have assembled the bones and taken them with him amid the Exodus from Egypt, utilizing enchantment to raise the casket, a custom rehashed by Josephus, who determines that they were covered in Canaan around then. With respect to internment in Canaan, from Joshua it is apparent that the part Joseph got was an assignment close Shechem, not simply the town. 

Most of contemporary researchers trust the accuracy of the occasions in the Joseph story can't be illustrated. In the wake of researchers like Hermann Gunkel, Hugo Gressmann and Gerhard von Rad, who distinguished the narrative of Joseph as basically an artistic sythesis, it is currently broadly considered to have a place with the class of sentiment, or the novella. As a novella it is perused as revising legends and fantasies, a considerable lot of them, particularly the themes of his reburial in Canaan, related with the Egyptian god Osiris, however some look at the internment of his bones at Shechem with the transfer of Dionysus' bones at Delphi. The modified legends and old stories were most likely embedded into the creating printed convention of the Bible between the eighth and sixth hundreds of years BCE. Most researchers place its arrangement in a sort that thrived in the Persian time of the Exile. 

For Schenke, the convention of Joseph's entombment at Shechem must be comprehended as an optional, Israelitic authentic understanding woven around a progressively old Canaanite sanctuary here. Wright has to be sure contended that "the patriarch Joseph was not an Israelite saint who moved toward becoming Egyptianised, however an Egyptian godlikeness who was Hebraised." 

Hans-Martin Schenke, beginning from an investigation of , in which Jesus experiences a Samaritan lady at the town Sychar, made a broad investigation of the antiquated sources, together with an examination of the site. The interest of the Gospel content for researchers lies in the notice of a generally unattested town in the field, and the disappointment of the content to allude to Joseph's Tomb, in spite of referencing the field Jacob designated to Joseph, and Jacob's well. In Schenke's view, from the earliest starting point of the Hellenistic time frame down to the first century CE, when the writer of John's gospel was probably composing, the grave remembering Joseph remained by Jacob's Well. This grave was moved, together with the consecrated tree and Jacob's field, at some point between that date and the most punctual declaration we have in the Bordeaux schedule in 333 CE, which finds it somewhere else, by Shechem/Tel BalÃ¤ÂÃ¡Å¡Â­a. 

The Itinerarium Burdigalense (333 CE) notes: "At the foot of the mountain itself, is a spot called Sichem. Here is a tomb in which Joseph is laid, in the package of ground which Jacob his dad provided for him." Eusebius of Caesarea in the fourth century records in his "Onomasticon": "Suchem, city of Jacob currently left. The spot is called attention to in the suburb of Neapolis. There the tomb of Joseph is brought up close-by." Jerome, composing of Saint Paula's stay in Palestine composes that "killing the way [from Jacob's well], she saw the tombs of the twelve patriarchs". Jerome himself, together with the Byzantine priest George Syncellus, who had lived numerous years in Palestine, composed that each of the twelve patriarchs, Joseph notwithstanding, were covered at Sychem. 

Both Theodosius I and Theodosius II requested a look for Joseph's bones, a lot to the articulate dishearten of the Samaritan people group. A majestic commission was dispatched to recover the bones of the Patriarchs around 415, and on neglecting to get them at Hebron, looked to at any rate secure Joseph's bones from Shechem. No tombstone denoted the definite site, conceivably in light of the fact that the Samaritans had evacuated one to stay away from Christian impedance. The authorities needed to exhume the general region where graves proliferate and, on finding an unblemished marble mausoleum underneath an unfilled box, presumed that it must contain Joseph's bones, and sent the stone coffin to Byzantium, where it was consolidated into Hagia Sophia. 

Jerome reports that clearly the Christians had proposed to evacuate Joseph's unresolved issues city, yet a section of flame climbed skyward from the tomb driving them off. The Samaritans in this way secured the tomb with earth rendering it blocked off. 

Christian pioneer and archdeacon Theodosius (518Ã¢ÂÂ520) in his "De situ terrae sanctae" makes reference to that "near Jacob's Well are the remaining parts of Joseph the Holy". The Madaba Mosaic Map (sixth century) assigns a site to some degree dangerously with the legend Ã¢ÂÂ "Joseph's" (ÄÂÃ¡ËÂ¸ ÄÂÃ®Å¼Ã¡Å¼Å Ã¡Å¼ÂÄÂÄÂÃ®Å¾ÄÂ) Ã¢ÂÂ where the typical descriptive word 'blessed' ("hagios") going with notices of holy people and their places of worship is deficient. 

Crusader and medieval sources for the most part are, as indicated by Hans-Martin Schenke, very deceptive with respect to precisely where the tomb was arranged. He reasoned that in the Middle Ages, as prior, different gatherings (Jews, Samaritans, Christians and Muslims) at various periods recognized distinctive things in better places all as JosephÃ¢ÂÂs tomb. At times Balata, with its spring, appears demonstrated, as in the accompanying two precedents, which recognize the tomb not as a structure, yet as something by a spring and under a tree. It was clearly a site for Muslim journey around then. 

In 1173 the Persian voyager al-Harawi paid tribute at the tomb, and composed: 

There is additionally close NÄËblus the spring of Al Khudr (Elias), and the field of YÄÅ¥suf as Sadik (Joseph); further, Joseph is covered at the foot of the tree at this spot. 

Around the year 1225, Yaqut al-Hamawi composed: 

as did Benjamin of TudelaÃ¢ÂÂwho composed that the Samaritans in Nablus were in control of it. William of Malmesbury depicts it as overlaid with white marble, beside the mausolea of his siblings. Menachem ben Peretz of Hebron (1215) composes that in Shechem he saw the tomb of Joseph child of Jacob with two marble columns alongside itÃ¢ÂÂone at its head and another at its footÃ¢ÂÂand a low stone divider encompassing it. Ishtori Haparchi (1322) places the gravestone of Joseph 450 meters north of BalÃ¤Âta, while Alexander de Ariosti (1463) and Francesco Suriano (1485) partner it with the congregation over Jacob's well. Samuel bar Simson (1210), Jacob of Paris (1258), and Johannes Poloner (1422) find it by Nablus. Gabriel Muffel of Nuremberg perceives a tomb to Joseph in a landmark toward the west of Nablus, somewhere between that city and Sebaste. Mandeville (1322) and Maundrell (1697), among others, likewise notice its reality, in spite of the fact that it is easy to refute about whether any of these reports allude to the as of now perceived area. Samuel ben Samson (1210) seems to put the tomb at Shiloh. Mandeville (1322) finds it 'near alongside' Nablus as does Maundrell (1697), yet the signs are unclear. Maundrell depicts his catacomb as situated in a little mosque just by Nablus, which does not fit the present area. 

Despite the fact that the Koran does not make reference to subtleties of Joseph's entombment, Islamic convention focuses to Nablus just like the true site. Notwithstanding, some early Islamic geographers distinguished the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron as lodging his tomb. While Ali of Herat (1119), Yaqut (1229) and Ibn Battuta (1369) all report the Hebron conventions, they additionally notice the presence of a tomb of Joseph at Nablus. Later Muslim writers even notice a third site indicating to be the real tomb, close Beit Ijza. 

William Cooke Taylor (1838) portrays the scriptural package of ground Jacob provided for Joseph as arranged on plain of Mukhna, and distinguishes the tomb as an oriental "weli" structure at the passageway to the valley of Nablus, to one side close to the base of Mt Ebal. The stone coffin, he proposes, lies underneath or elsewhere in the region of this plain, and remarks: 

The present monumentÃ¢Â ... is a position of resort, for Jews and Christians, however Mohammedans and Samaritans; every one of whom agree in the conviction that it remains on the vertiable spot where the patriarch was covered. 

In 1839, the Jewish explorer Loewe based his distinguishing proof of the tomb as close to Jacob's Well by a geographical contention. Sacred text, he contended, calls the spot neither an "emek" (valley) nor a "shephelah" (plain), however a 'segment of field' ("chelkat hasadeh"), and closed: "in the entire of Palestine there isn't such another plot to be discovered, a dead dimension, without the least empty or swelling in a circuit of two hours." 

In 1839, it was recorded that Jews as often as possible visited the tomb and that numerous engravings in Hebrew were unmistakable on the dividers. The site was "kept perfect and in decent shape by the abundance of Jews who visited it". 

John Wilson (1847) composes that the tomb lies around a few hundred yards toward the north of Jacob's Well, over the valley. He depicts it as "a little strong erection as a wagon rooftop, over what should be the patriarch's grave, with a little column or special raised area at every one of its furthest points, now and then called the tombs of Ephraim and Manasseh, and the center of a fenced in area without a covering. Numerous guests names, in the Hebrew and Samaritan characters, are composed on the dividers of this fenced in area." One of the engravings is said to insinuate the tomb's fix by a Jew from Egypt, Elijah child of Meir, around 1749. Wilson includes that "The Jews of Nablus take upon themselves the obligation of maintaining the tomb in control. They connected to us for a membership to help in making a few fixes and we agreed to their solicitation". These Hebrew and Samaritan engravings were as yet unmistakable on the white put dividers as late as 1980, as were little lights in an inward break, most likely given by Jews amid the eighteenth and nineteenth hundreds of years. 

Rabbi Joseph Schwarz (1850) who had lived in Palestine for a long time, distinguished the town of Abulnita, "around 2 English miles east of Shechem", as the site "where Joseph lies covered". Western voyagers to Palestine in the nineteenth century depicted their impressions of the site in travelogs. John Ross Browne (1853) states: "We likewise visited the rumored site of Joseph's Tomb. A discourteous stone structure covers the imagined tomb; yet the best experts deny that there was any proof that Joseph was covered here." Howard Crosby additionally visited the site amid 1851. He assigned it, "the alleged tomb of Joseph", portraying it as "a plain white Santon's tomb, or Wely, for example, is wherever found in Mohammedan nations, then again, actually this one is roofless, and thus comes up short on the typical white arch. In the inside, a vine develops from a corner, and spreads upon a trellis over the tomb, shaping a charming arbor." Louis FÄÅ¡licien Joseph Caignart de Saulcy and Edouard de Warren (1853) depict it as "a little Mussulman oually ("weli", for example house of prayer) ... said to be the tomb of Joseph", noticing it was simply toward the east of what the Arabs called "Bir-Yakub", Jacob's Well. Hackett noted in 1857 that the tomb is put askew to the dividers, rather than parallel, and found "the dividers of the inside secured with the names of travelers, speaking to pretty much every land and language; however the Hebrew character was the most conspicuous one". Thomson noted in 1883 that "the whole structure is quick disintegrating to demolish, displaying a most despairing exhibition". Being presented to the climate, "it has no pall or votive offering of any sort, nor any characteristics of regard, for example, are seen at the mausoleums of the most inconsequential Muslim holy people." During the late nineteenth century, sources report the Jewish custom of consuming little articles, for example, gold trim, shawls or tissues, in the two low columns at either end of the tomb. This was done in "memory of the patriarch who dozes underneath". 

Claude R. Conder gives a nitty gritty portrayal of the site in his works "Tent Work in Palestine" (1878), "Study of Western Palestine" (1881) and "Palestine" (1889). 

It is situated out and about side from Balata to Ã¢ÂÂAskar, toward the finish of a line of fine fig trees. The open yard encompassing the tomb measures about square. The put, whitewashed dividers, about thick, are in decent shape and stand high. Access to the patio is from the north through the ruin of a little square domed structure. There are two Hebrew engravings on the south divider. An extra English engraving takes note of that the structure was completely reconstructed to the detriment of the English representative at Damascus by mid 1868.The tomb itself estimates long and stands high. It comprised of a long restricted put hinder with an angled rooftop, having a pointed cross area. The tomb isn't in accordance with the dividers of the patio, which have a heading of 202Ã¢Â°, nor is it amidst the fenced in area, being closest toward the west divider. Two short put platforms with shallow container molded hollows at their tops remain at the head and foot of the tomb. The hollows are darkened by flame because of the Jewish custom of consuming contributions of shawls, silks or gold ribbon on the column special raised areas. The two Jews and Samaritans consume oil lights and incense in the column cavity. 

Conder additionally questions the way that the tomb directs north toward south, conflicting with Muslim tombs north of Mecca. This reality did not anyway decrease Muslim worship of the sanctum: 

The tomb focuses around north and south, in this manner being at right points to the bearing of Moslem tombs north of Mecca. How the Mohammedans clarify this dismissal of introduction in so regarded a Prophet as "our Lord Joseph", I have never heard; maybe the standard is held to be just settled since the season of Mohammed. The adoration in which the sanctum is held by the Moslem lower class is, at all occasions, not lessened by this reality. 

Over the span of stick pointing the area of the tomb, the Reverend H.B. Hackett in Sir William Smith's "A lexicon of the Bible" (1863) makes reference to the presence of two tombs bearing a relationship to Joseph in Nablus. Notwithstanding the one near the well, (area of Conder's study), he portrays another solely Muslim tomb in the region, about a fourth of a mile up the valley on the slant of Mt. Gerizim. He can't finish up which of the tombs is that of the scriptural Joseph, however refers to Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (1856) that at the Muslim tomb "a later Joseph is additionally recognized at the asylum." Stanley himself composes that the little mosque on Gerizim's north-eastern inclines is known by different names including "Allon Moreh" (Oak of Allon), "Aharon Moreh" (Ark of Moreh) and "Sheykh al-Amad" (Saint of the Pillar) which he proposes celebrate scriptural customs. Stanley likewise cites Buckingham, who makes reference to that the Samaritans keep up that the elective tomb has a place with a specific Rabbi Joseph of Nablus. John Mills (1864) composes that cases of the tomb having a place with Rabbi Joseph of Nablus are unwarranted, the structure being called by the Samaritans "The Pillar" in celebration of the column set up by Joshua. Plants rather recognizes the alleged rabbi's tomb with a mosque named after a Muslim holy person, "Sheik el-Amud" ("Saint of the Pillar"), however further cases that the affiliation is "just a cutting edge innovation of the Mohammedans". A book distributed in 1894, likewise questions the presence of a tomb to Rabbi Joseph of Nablus, calling it "a Mohammedan legend, forced upon curious voyagers by corrupt aides" since "the present Samaritans known about no Joseph's tomb yet the by and large acknowledged one". 

By the 1860s, numerous Jews and Muslims had come to see the limestone structure as lodging the tomb of the scriptural Joseph, and it was alluded to in Arabic as "Qabr en-Nabi YÄºÅ¥suf" ("Tomb of the Prophet Joseph"). An enlivening fabric shot in 1917, hung over the tomb itself, declared this recognition. Palestinians are likewise said to see the site as the entombment spot of YÄºÅ¥suf Dawiqat, an Islamic sheik. It has been guaranteed that this convention is a development in light of Israeli control of the site since the 1970s. 

Prior to 1967, the tomb was as yet situated in a field in the town of Balata on the edges of Nablus. Neighborhood occupants evidently trusted the structure buried a nineteenth century priest who was presumed to have mended the debilitated by discussing Koranic sections. In spite of the fact that the structure did not work as a mosque, it was utilized by childless couples who might implore there for kids, and young men would take their first custom hair style inside. After the catch of Nablus and the remainder of the Palestinian regions in the 1967 Six-Day War, Jewish pioneers started to visit the site, and by 1975, Muslims were disallowed from visiting the site. After a pilgrim was wounded in Nablus in 1983, different pioneers shown by assuming control over Joseph's tomb for three days in an offer to constrain the administration's hand into utilizing an iron clench hand. In the mid-1980s a yeshiva named "Od Yosef Chai", (Joseph Still Lives), partnered with a portion of the more activist Jewish settlements, and headed by Yitzhak Ginsburg, was worked at the site adjacent to an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) military station, evidently on the model of pioneer achievement in building up a nearness at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron. All Muslims including those living close-by were powerfully denied access. An underlying endeavor in 1994 to change the site into a Jewish religious focus fizzled. Shulamit Aloni, serve for culture and instruction in the Rabin government, insulted religious activists at the time by affirming, based on archeological proof, that the site was just 200 years of age, and the tomb that of Sheik YÄºÅ¥suf (Dawiqat), a Sufi blessed man who kicked the bucket in the eighteenth century. Her perspectives were tested by Benny Katzover who answered that she had been deluded by archeologists, and he had specialists to back the customary attribution. In 1997 Torah scrolls were gotten, the petition specialty confronting Mecca was secured, and the site was proclaimed a synagogue and yeshiva. Appending the religious custom encompassing the account of Joseph to the site, the pilgrims got assurance from the IDF to change this spot of Muslim love into one of their own. A check in time enduring 24 hours was once forced by the IDF on Nablus' 120,000 occupants to permit a gathering of pioneers and 2 Likud Knesset individuals to supplicate at the site. The site, which Jewish admirers make month to month journeys to, is among the most vital to Orthodox Jews. 

On December 12, 1995, as per the Oslo Accords, purview of Nablus was given over to the Palestinian National Authority, however Israel held control of a few religious locales, one of which was Joseph's Tomb, in this manner authorizing the laden circumstance. Pioneer fears that the territory may be come back to Palestinians attempted to upgrade the status of Joseph's tomb as a focal point of journey. The Interim Agreement stipulated that: "The two sides will regard and ensure the religious privileges of Jews, Christians, Muslims and Samaritans concerning the security and free access to the sacred destinations just as opportunity of love and practice." The tomb, taking after an invigorated military post with a little working yeshiva, turned into a continuous blaze point. On September 24, 1996, after the opening of an exit for the Hasmonean Tunnel under the Ummariya madrasah, which Palestinians deciphered as a flag Benjamin Netanyahu was sending that Israel was to be the sole sovereign of Jerusalem, the PNA required a general strike and an influx of challenges broke out all through the West Bank. In conflicts, 80 individuals were executed and 253 injured in the West Bank while six Israeli fighters were murdered at the tomb, and parts of the contiguous yeshiva were scoured. Jews kept on venerating at the site under constrained security of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), regularly dressed as regular citizens effectively confused with pioneers. 

The site had been assaulted by weapon shoot, and several Palestinians raged the compound. Israeli fringe control assumed responsibility for the compound however Palestinian security administrations mentioned to assume responsibility for the positions and the control was passed to them. in the next hours the horde put vehicles outside the compound on fire entered the tomb and evacuated the Morus tree, the last known picture of the Morus tree was taken amid 2006. 

Throughout the 18 months somewhere in the range of 1999 and 2000, the IDF, favored by the Shin Bet and the Israeli Border Police, had requested that the legislature empty the tomb. In September 2000, in the wake of Ariel Sharon's questionable visit to the Temple Mount, the Al-Aqsa Intifada broke out, and Nablus transformed into strife zone, to some extent after its senator's child was shot dead amid a conflict with Israeli fighters. The Palestinians focused on the site, supposedly in light of the fact that it was better for the sanctum to have a place with nobody than to be appropriated by only one religion, consuming the yeshiva to the ground, burning its books and painting the arch green, a demonstration which prompted striking back with Jewish vandalism of three mosques in Tiberias and Jaffa. After the demise of an Israeli outskirt policeman the leader of the IDF's southern order, Brigadier-General Yom-Tov Samia, took steps to leave if the legislature kept control of the tomb, since holding control of it was "plainly illicit". PM Ehud Barak in the long run agreed to the solicitation and the site was given over to the Palestinian police on October 7, 2000. Israeli papers encircled the arrival of the site as an embarrassing thrashing for the country. The tomb was looted and burnt by Palestinian nonconformists hours after its departure. The following morning, the slug baffled assortment of rabbi Hillel Lieberman of Elon Moreh, a cousin of Senator Joseph Lieberman, was found on the edges of Nablus, where he had gone to check harm to the tomb. Joseph's Tomb encapsulated a key Zionist topic: the arrival from outcast to one's country, and the Palestinian attack has been translated as moving the believability of cases to the site. The PA started to fix it the following day. Palestinian representative Hanan Ashrawi guaranteed that Judaism's association with the tomb was "created". The city hall leader of Nablus Ghassan Shakaa was accounted for as saying Jewish admirers would not be allowed to ask there until a global association or outsider decides if the site is heavenly to Muslims or Jews. 

Israeli military authorities said the Palestinians proposed to manufacture a mosque on the remnants of the site. The announcement came after laborers fixing the tomb painted the site's vault green, the shade of Islam. A Palestinian Authority representative denied the charges and said that Arafat had requested the redesigns and for the synagogue to be revamped. Ghassan Shakaa, the civic chairman, asserted that city authorities basically needed to restore the structure to the manner in which it looked before it came into Israeli delivers the 1967 Mideast war. Under extraordinary U.S. what's more, global weight the vault was repainted white. 

After the occasions of October 2000, the IDF denied Israeli access to the tomb. Because of Operation Defensive Shield, Nablus was reoccupied by the IDF in April 2002, with extreme harm to the memorable center of the city, where 64 legacy structures endured genuine harm or were obliterated. Some Breslov hasidim and others started to exploit the new conditions to visit the site covertly under the front of haziness, sidestepping armed force and police checkpoints. In the long run Joseph's tomb was yet again open to visits. In May 2002, Israeli fighters erroneously started shooting at an escort of pilgrims exploiting a progressing attack in Nablus to visit the tomb. Seven pioneers were captured by the military for illicitly entering a battle zone. Because of Operation Defensive Shield, the tomb was retaken by the IDF and in no time a while later, in light of various solicitations, they restored watched voyages through the tomb. One day consistently at midnight upwards of 800 guests were permitted to supplicate at the gravesite. These visits were intended to avert unapproved and unprotected undercover visits, for the most part by Breslav Hassidim. Be that as it may, in October, refering to security reasons, Israel re-forced a restriction on Jewish explorers getting uncommon allows and making a trip to the tomb. 

In February 2003 it was accounted for in the "Jerusalem Post" that the grave had been beat with sledges and that the tree at its passage had been broken; vehicle parts and refuse littered the tomb which had an "enormous opening in its vault". Bratslav pioneer Aaron Klieger advised and campaigned government serves about the despoiling, yet the IDF said it had no designs to verify or protect the site, asserting such activity would be excessively expensive. 

In February 2007, thirty five Knesset individuals (MKs) kept in touch with the military requesting that they open Joseph's Tomb to Jewish guests for supplication. In May 2007, Breslov hasidim visited the site without precedent for a long time and later on that year, a gathering of hasidim found that the gravesite had been tidied up by the Palestinians. In the previous couple of years the site had experienced disregard and its appearance had weakened, with refuse being dumped and tires being scorched there. 

In mid 2008, a gathering of MKs composed a letter to the Prime Minister asking that the tomb be redesigned: "The gravestone is totally broken, and the blessed site is contaminated in a shocking way, any semblance of which we have not found in Israel or anyplace else on the planet." In February, it was accounted for that Israel would authoritatively request that the Palestinian Authority complete fixes at the tomb, however accordingly, vandals set tires ablaze inside the tomb. In December 2008, Jewish specialists supported by mysterious givers painted the darkened dividers and re-fabricated the broke stone marker covering the grave. 

Starting at 2009, month to month visits to the tomb in projectile confirmation vehicles under substantial IDF assurance are composed by the Yitzhar based association Shechem Ehad. In late April 2009, a gathering of Jewish admirers found the tombstone crushed and swastikas painted on the dividers, just as boot prints on the grave itself. 

In August 2010, it was accounted for that the IDF and the Palestinian Authority achieved a concession to remodeling the site. Israel's central rabbis, Yona Metzger and Shlomo Amar, visited and supplicated at the tomb alongside 500 different admirers, the principal such visit by a high-positioning Israeli assignment in 10 years. 

On 24 April 2011, Palestinian Authority cops opened flame on three vehicles of Israeli admirers after they got done with supplicating at Joseph's tomb. An Israeli native was executed and three others were injured. The casualty was distinguished as Ben-Joseph Livnat, 25, the nephew of Culture Minister Limor Livnat. Both the Israel Defense Forces and Palestinian Authority requested examinations concerning the episode. As indicated by an underlying examination, three vehicles loaded with Israelis entered the compound of Joseph's tomb without coordination with the Israeli military or Palestinian security powers and afterward endeavored to get through a Palestinian Authority police checkpoint. The IDF examination inferred that the Palestinian cops had acted "malevolently" and with the purpose to hurt the Jewish admirers. IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz included that they terminated "without legitimization and with no quick risk to their lives". 

On 7 July 2014, Palestinians endeavored to torch Joseph's tomb while dissenting. Palestinian Authority security powers had the capacity to stop the nonconformists before they had the capacity to torch it. On December 22, 2014, Jews who were visiting the tomb to light candles for the Jewish occasion of Hanukkah found that the site had been vandalized. Lights were broken and electrical wiring had been cut. It was the first run through Jews were permitted to visit the tomb in over a month. 

On 16 October 2015, in the midst of a flood of savagery among Palestinians and Israelis, several Palestinians overran the tomb and a gathering of them set it ablaze with petroleum bombs.
