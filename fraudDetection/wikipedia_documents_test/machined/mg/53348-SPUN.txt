Puck (moon) 

Puck ( ) is an internal moon of Uranus. It was found in December 1985 by the "Voyager 2" rocket. The name "Puck" pursues the show of naming Uranus' moons after characters from Shakespeare. The circle of Puck lies between the rings of Uranus and the first of Uranus' expansive moons, Miranda. Puck is around circular fit as a fiddle and has breadth of about 162Ã¢Â km. It has a dull, intensely cratered surface, which hints at otherworldly water ice. 

PuckÃ¢ÂÂthe biggest internal moon of UranusÃ¢ÂÂwas found from the pictures taken by "Voyager 2" on 30 December 1985. It was given the impermanent assignment S/1985ÃÂ UÃÂ 1. 

The moon was later named after the character Puck who shows up in Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream", a little sprite who goes far and wide during the evening with the pixies. In Celtic folklore and English legends, a "Puck" is a fiendish sprite, envisioned as a malicious evil spirit by Christians. 

It is additionally assigned UranusÃÂ XV. 

Puck is the biggest little internal moon of Uranus, which circles inside the circle of Miranda. It is middle of the road in size between Portia (the second-biggest inward moon) and Miranda (the littlest of the five huge established moons). Puck's circle is situated between the rings of Uranus and Miranda. Little is thought about Puck beside its circle, sweep of about 81Ã¢Â km, and geometric albedo in obvious light of around 0.11. 

Of the moons found by the "VoyagerÃ¢Â 2" imaging group, just Puck was found sufficiently early that the test could be modified to picture it in some detail. Pictures demonstrated that Puck has a state of a marginally prolate spheroid (proportion between tomahawks is 0.97Ã¢Â Ã¢ÄÃ¢Â 0.04). Its surface is intensely cratered and is dark in shading. There are three named cavities on the outside of Puck, the biggest being about 45Ã¢Â km in breadth. Perceptions with the Hubble Space Telescope and expansive earthbound telescopes discovered water-ice assimilation includes in the range of Puck. 

Nothing is thought about the inner structure of Puck. It is most likely made of a blend of water ice with the dim material like that found in the rings. This dim material is most likely made of rocks or radiation-prepared organics. The nonattendance of cavities with splendid beams suggests that Puck isn't separated, implying that ice and non-ice segments have not isolated from one another into a center and mantle.
