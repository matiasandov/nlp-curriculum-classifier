New York State Route 20SY 

New York State RouteÃÂ 20SY (NYÃÂ 20SY) was a state parkway in the region of Syracuse, New York, in the United States. It associated U.S. RouteÃ¢Â 20 (USÃÂ 20) to downtown Syracuse by means of Skaneateles, Camillus, Manlius, and Cazenovia in Onondaga County and Madison County. The parkway started at a crossing point with USÃÂ 20 and NYÃÂ 321 in the town of Skaneateles and finished at an intersection with USÃÂ 20, NYÃÂ 20N, and NYÃÂ 92 close to the town of Cazenovia. The greater part of NYÃÂ 20SY covered another course; in any case, two areas of NYÃÂ 20SYÃ¢ÂÂone in the town of Camillus and another close to the town of FayettevilleÃ¢ÂÂwere not simultaneous with another parkway. 

NYÃÂ 20SY was doled out inÃ¢Â 1951, covering portions of the prior NYÃÂ 321, NYÃÂ 5, NYÃÂ 92, and NYÃÂ 20N, an all the more southerly backup course of action of USÃÂ 20 in the Syracuse zone. Both NYÃÂ 20N and NYÃÂ 20SY were expelled in 1961. The two free areas of NYÃÂ 20SY close Camillus and Fayetteville in the end turned out to be a piece of NYÃÂ 321 and NYÃÂ 92, individually. 

NYÃÂ 20SY started at a crossing point with USÃÂ 20 (East Genesee Street) and NYÃÂ 321 (State Street) in the town of Skaneateles. The course continued northward, covering NYÃÂ 321 through the lakeside town and into the encompassing town of Skaneateles, where it moved toward becoming State Street Road. Once in Skaneateles, the surroundings turned out to be for the most part rustic in front of a crossing point with the Old Seneca Turnpike. The interstate forged ahead, swinging toward the upper east as the parkway entered the town of Elbridge. 

In Elbridge, NYÃÂ 20SY and NYÃÂ 321 pursued a more eastÃ¢ÂÂwest steering as it went through the town and met NYÃÂ 368. The course advanced eastbound, meeting with Limeledge Road (County RouteÃÂ 236A or CRÃÂ 236A) as it go into the town of Camillus. Only east of the town line, NYÃÂ 20SY and NYÃÂ 321 split at a crossing point with Forward Road, with NYÃÂ 321 following Forward Road eastbound and NYÃÂ 20SY continuing north on present day NYÃÂ 321 to a convergence with NYÃÂ 5 (West Genesee Street). NYÃÂ 20SY turned eastbound here, joining NYÃÂ 5 as both interstates made a beeline for the town of Camillus. 

West of Camillus, NYÃÂ 5 and NYÃÂ 20SY go toward the north of the West Hill Golf and Croquet Club before veering toward the southeast as the interstate moved toward the town of Camillus and the edge of a valley encompassing Ninemile Creek that contains the town. After achieving the lip of the valley, NYÃÂ 5 and NYÃÂ 20SY slid northeastward into both the valley and the town. Here, NYÃÂ 5 and NYÃÂ 20SY met the northern end of NYÃÂ 174 and NYÃÂ 321 before leaving the valley and entering a territory of Camillus known as Fairmount. 

RoutesÃ¢Â 5 andÃÂ 20SY continued eastbound through the basically private neighborhood of Fairmount to a crossing point with NYÃÂ 173 (South Onondaga Road) in eastern Fairmount. The courses progressed forward, going through the town of Geddes before entering the city of Syracuse. In Syracuse, the two courses pursued West Genesee Street and West Erie Boulevard into the downtown area, where NYÃÂ 5 and NYÃÂ 20SY converged NYÃÂ 48 at the crossing point of West Erie Boulevard and West Genesee Street and USÃÂ 11 at the intersection of Erie Boulevard and State Street. 

East of State, NYÃÂ 20SY kept on finishing NYÃÂ 5 the eastern piece of Syracuse. The two courses met the southern end of NYÃÂ 433 at Midler Avenue before passing north of LeMoyne College and leaving the city of Syracuse. After intersection into the town of DeWitt, RoutesÃ¢Â 5 andÃÂ 20SY bended southward toward the villa of DeWitt, arranged at the intersection of NYÃÂ 5 and NYÃÂ 92. Both NYÃÂ 5 and NYÃÂ 20SY turned east onto NYÃÂ 92, joining the course for only over to the region of Fayetteville. While NYÃÂ 5 and NYÃÂ 92 proceeded with east into Fayetteville, NYÃÂ 20SY turned southeast onto High Bridge Road. 

The High Bridge Road segment of NYÃÂ 20SY generally filled in as a southwestern detour of Fayetteville. NYÃÂ 20SY continued southeast from NYÃÂ 5 and NYÃÂ 92, crossing into the town of Manlius and ignoring Limestone Creek at a point known as High Bridge. Only northwest of the town of Manlius, NYÃÂ 20SY converged NYÃÂ 92 at what is currently the intersection of NYÃÂ 92 and NYÃÂ 257. The two courses united afresh, following Fayette Street into the town of Manlius. In the town focus, NYÃÂ 20SY and NYÃÂ 92 crossed Seneca Street, which conveyed the covering courses of NYÃÂ 20N and NYÃÂ 173. NYÃÂ 20SY and NYÃÂ 92 joined NYÃÂ 20N and NYÃÂ 173 here, making a four-course cover that went on for two squares through the town's business region to the intersection of Washington and Seneca Streets. Here, NYÃÂ 173 split from the cover, following Seneca Street (the old Seneca Turnpike) eastbound while the other three parkways veered southeast onto Washington Street. 

NYÃÂ 20N, NYÃÂ 20SY, and NYÃÂ 92 left the town, paralleling Limestone Creek as the parkway traveled southeastward through provincial segments of the towns of Manlius and Pompey. As Cazenovia Road, the course served Buellville and Oran, two little creekside villages in the town of Pompey. Generally southeast of Manlius, Limestone Creek and the three-course cover split, with the spring continuing south through a valley known as Pompey Hollow and the expressway proceeding into Madison County and the town of Cazenovia inside. 

In Cazenovia, the street wound up known as Syracuse Road and pursued an all the more southerly arrangement as it turned in front of Cazenovia Lake. NYÃÂ 20N, NYÃÂ 20SY, and NYÃÂ 92 bit by bit moved toward the lake and eventually pursued the western lakeshore as the roadway moved toward the town of Cazenovia. The three courses never really achieved the town, be that as it may, as every one of the three assignments finished at a crossing point with USÃÂ 20 (the Cherry Valley Turnpike) west of as far as possible and west of the town focus. 

NYÃÂ 20SY was doled out inÃ¢Â 1951 as a backup course of action of USÃÂ 20 in the Syracuse territory. While USÃÂ 20 skirted the city of Syracuse toward the south, NYÃÂ 20SY veered north to serve Downtown Syracuse and the eastern and western rural areas of the city. It was the second backup course of action of USÃÂ 20 close Syracuse; the first, NYÃÂ 20N, was additionally a northern backup way to go of USÃÂ 20 however it pursued a more southerly steering than NYÃÂ 20SY. The greater part of NYÃÂ 20SY was simultaneous to other, previous state expressways in the Syracuse zone, to be specific NYÃÂ 321, NYÃÂ 5, NYÃÂ 92, NYÃÂ 173, and NYÃÂ 20N. NYÃÂ 5 was allocated in 1924; NYÃÂ 92, NYÃÂ 173, and NYÃÂ 321 were relegated as a major aspect of the 1930 renumbering of state expressways in New York; and NYÃÂ 20N was alloted . 

While the vast majority of NYÃÂ 20SY was simultaneous with no less than one other state roadway, there were two fragments where NYÃÂ 20SY pursued a free directing. One was in the town of Camillus, where NYÃÂ 20SY pursued a formerly unnumbered interstate somewhere in the range of NYÃÂ 321 and NYÃÂ 5; the other was southwest of the town of Fayetteville, where NYÃÂ 20SY utilized a formerly unnumbered roadway to sidestep the town while NYÃÂ 92 went through it. 

At the point when NYÃÂ 20SY was first relegated, it entered downtown Syracuse on NYÃÂ 5 and finished NYÃÂ 5 and USÃÂ 11 downtown before leaving the zone on NYÃÂ 92. It was realigned by 1954 to finish just NYÃÂ 5 downtown. The course left its unique arrangement at the intersection of USÃÂ 11 and NYÃÂ 5 in downtown Syracuse and rejoined it at the western end of the NYÃÂ 5ÃÂ /NYÃÂ 92 cover in DeWitt. 

Both NYÃÂ 20N and NYÃÂ 20SY were expelled in 1961. The autonomous area of NYÃÂ 20SY that circumvent Fayetteville turned into a realignment of NYÃÂ 92 upon the evacuation of NYÃÂ 20SY. The other free area in Camillus turned into a realignment of NYÃÂ 321 in the late 1980s.
