The 1981 Atlantic typhoon season formally started on June 1, 1981, and went on until November 30, 1981. These dates customarily delimit the time of every year when most tropical tornados structure in the Atlantic bowl. The 1981 season was high in movement with 22Ã¢Â tropical dejections and twelve tempests framing amid the year. Nine of these frameworks made landfall. Cindy, Harvey, and Irene neither influenced land straightforwardly nor in a roundabout way. 

Storm Dennis caused a great many dollars in harm in Dade County, Florida and created the most elevated precipitation sums of any tropical twister this season. Tropical Depression Eight caused the most harm, because of flooding in Texas toward the finish of August, and prompted most fatalities of any tropical violent wind this season (five).

The last tempest of the period, Subtropical Storm Three, framed in the Atlantic Ocean on November 12 and moved north, making landfall in Nova Scotia and getting to be extratropical before long. 

The season's action was reflected with a total amassed tornado vitality (ACE) rating of 100, which is named "close ordinary". Pro is, extensively, a proportion of the intensity of the sea tempest duplicated by the period of time it existed, so storms that keep going quite a while, just as especially solid sea tempests, have high ACEs. Pro is determined for full warnings on tropical frameworks at or surpassing 34Ã¢Â knots (39Ã¢Â mph, 63Ã¢Â km/h) or hurricane quality. Albeit formally, subtropical twisters are rejected from the aggregate, the figure above incorporates periods when storms were in a subtropical stage. 

Arlene was an exceptionally surprising hurricane in 1981. It framed on May 6, a long time before the start of the typical tropical storm season. It created out of an unsettling influence that moved from the Pacific Ocean crosswise over Central America into the Caribbean Sea. As the unsettling influence followed upper east over the western Caribbean, it turned into a tropical gloom, at that point on May 7 achieved hurricane quality close to the Cayman Islands.

In contrast to most such tempests, Dennis deteriorated to a tropical wave before achieving the Windward Islands on August 12. This wave crossed the Caribbean, ignoring Jamaica before achieving the southwestern shoreline of Cuba on August 15. 

Once close Cuba, the wave started fast association, restrengthening into a typhoon. It crossed Cuba, at that point moved over the Florida Keys on August 16 and territory Florida the following day. Over Florida, directing flows debilitated and the tempest slowed down. On August 19, Tropical Storm Dennis reemerged over water, skimming the shores of the Carolinas before quickening out to ocean.

Most harm related with Dennis was from the overwhelming precipitation brought about by its moderate entry over Florida, albeit two tornadoes were additionally announced inside Florida. The most elevated sum enrolled was close Homestead, Florida, where of downpour was estimated. Farming harm in Dade County, Florida was evaluated at $15Ã¢Â million (1981ÃÂ USD).

Floyd swung toward the upper east, and passed only southeast of Bermuda as a debilitating typhoon. As a typhoon, Floyd moved east over the Atlantic until losing its character on September 12. 

No harms are related with Floyd. In spite of the fact that Bermuda was straightforwardly influenced, the island encountered the flimsier portion of the tempest. 

A tropical wave left western Africa on September 1, step by step building up a concentrated zone of convection. Right off the bat SeptemberÃ¢Â 7, it was evaluated that Tropical Depression Eleven about east of the Leeward Islands, in view of satellite symbolism. The following day, information from the Hurricane Hunters demonstrated the gloom escalated into Tropical Storm Gert. The recently redesigned tempest go between the islands of Dominica and Guadeloupe and kept on strengthening, making landfall on southeastern Puerto Rico with winds of 60Ã¢Â mph (95Ã¢Â km/h) late September 8.

The sea tempest turned northeastward and debilitated over cooler waters, going about north of Bermuda on SeptemberÃ¢Â 12 as a hurricane. On SeptemberÃ¢Â 14, Gert debilitated further to tropical sadness status, scattering the following day.

Winds were light in Bermuda. 

Harvey framed in the focal Atlantic, achieving tropical storm quality just a couple of hours after first turning into a named framework on September 12. From its underlying position a few hundred miles east of the Leeward Islands, Harvey moved northwest. Its way started bending more toward the north, and was viewed as a risk to Bermuda until the proceeding with bend removed Harvey from the island. Harvey's track turned out to be all the more easterly, and the tempest debilitated and progressed toward becoming extratropical as it moved toward the Azores. Harvey caused no announced harm, albeit a few boats revealed encountering hurricane drive winds. 

The thirteenth tropical gloom grew southwest of Bermuda on September 22, and was at first expected to heighten into a hurricane.

The tempest created critical shoreline disintegration and beach front flooding. 

The accompanying rundown of names was utilized for named storms that shaped in the North Atlantic in 1981. It was the primary use for these names since the post-1978 naming change, aside from Arlene, Cindy, and Irene, which had been recently utilized in 1959, 1963, 1967, and 1971. There were no names resigned for this present year; along these lines, a similar rundown was utilized again in the 1987 season. 

This is a table of the tempests in 1981 and their landfall(s), assuming any. Passings in enclosures are extra and aberrant (a case of a backhanded demise would be an auto collision), yet are still tempest related.
