"Bart Gets a "F"" was the main scene of "The Simpsons" to be composed by David M. Stern. It was coordinated by David Silverman. Over the late spring of 1990, Bart's defiant nature was portrayed by certain guardians and moderates as a poor good example for youngsters, while a few American state funded schools restricted T-shirts including Bart by inscriptions, for example, "I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hellfire are you?" and "Underachiever ('And pleased with it, man!')". A few pundits suspected that the scene was a reaction to these contentions. Be that as it may, official maker James L. Rivulets reacted that it was not, yet included, "we're aware of it. I do believe it's vital for us that Bart does seriously in school. There are understudies that way.
