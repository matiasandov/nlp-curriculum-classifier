SM UB-14 

SM "UB-14 was a German Type UB I submarine or U-vessel in the German Imperial Navy () amid World War I. The submarine was additionally known by the Austro-Hungarian Navy assignment of SM "U-26. 

"UB-14" was requested in October 1914 and was set down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November. "UB-14" was somewhat under long and dislodged between , relying upon whether surfaced or submerged. She conveyed two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was additionally furnished with a deck-mounted automatic weapon. "UB-14" was broken into segments and transported by rail to the Austrian port Pola for reassembly. She was propelled and appointed in March 1915 as SM "UB-14" in the German Imperial Navy under the order of Oberleutnant zur See Heino von Heimburg. 

Since Germany and Italy were not yet at war when "UB-14" entered administration, she was moved in name just to the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The submarine held her German skipper and group, and stayed under German order as a piece of the "Kaiserliche Marine"s Pola Flotilla. Amid her first watch in the Adriatic, "UB-14" torpedoed and sank the . While heading out to Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) to join the Constantinople Flotilla, "UB-14" assaulted two British troopships, sinking with overwhelming death toll, and genuinely harming . Every one of the three of "UB-14"s first unfortunate casualties were among the biggest boats assaulted by U-pontoons amid the war. 

Despite the fact that "UB-14" sank the British submarine in the Sea of Marmara in November 1915, she burned through the greater part of the remainder of her vocation watching operating at a profit Sea. The U-vessel had just constrained accomplishment there, sinking just three ships through the finish of the war. After the war finished, the submarine was incapacitated at Sevastopol and surrendered at Malta in November 1918. "UB-14" was separated in 1920. 

After the German Army's quick development along the North Sea coast in the soonest phases of World War I, the German Imperial Navy wound up without appropriate submarines that could be worked in the limited and shallow oceans off Flanders. Venture 34, a structure exertion started in mid-August 1914, created the Type UB I plan: a little submarine that could be dispatched by rail to a port of tasks and immediately gathered. Compelled by railroad estimate constraints, the UB I configuration required a pontoon about long and uprooting about with two torpedo tubes. 

"UB-14" was a piece of the underlying designation of seven submarinesÃ¢ÂÂnumbered to Ã¢ÂÂordered on 15 October from AG Weser of Bremen, barely short of two months subsequent to getting ready for the class started. "UB-14" was set somewhere near Weser in Bremen on 9 November. As fabricated, "UB-14" was long, abeam, and had a draft of . She had a solitary KÄÅrting 4-chamber diesel motor for surface travel, and a solitary Siemens-Schuckert electric engine for submerged travel, both connected to a solitary propeller shaft. Her top velocities were , surfaced, and , submerged. At increasingly moderate velocities, she could cruise up to superficially before refueling, and up to submerged before energizing her batteries. Like all vessels of the class, "UB-14" was evaluated to a plunging profundity of , and could totally submerge in 33 seconds. 

"UB-14" was equipped with two torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes. She was likewise furnished for a solitary automatic weapon on deck. "UB-14"s standard supplement comprised of one officer and thirteen enrolled men. 

The majority of the UB I vessels were sent to their port of activities by rail, where they were amassed, propelled, tried, and authorized. Data on "UB-14" recommends that she might not have pursued that design as intently as most different pontoons. As per a few sources, "UB-14" was propelled on 23 March 1915, and appointed into the German Imperial Navy as SM "UB-14" on 25 March under the direction of Oberleutnant zur See Heino von Heimburg a 25-year-old first-time U-vessel authority. Those equivalent sources are quiet on "UB-14"s whereabouts at the time, however data on "UB-14" later shipment and landing in the Mediterranean recommend that her underlying dispatch and appointing may have happened in Germany. 

"UB-14" was transported by rail in June to the fundamental Austrian maritime base at Pola, with a landing date on the twelfth. The way toward delivery a UB I vessel included separating the submarine into what was basically a thump down pack. Each pontoon was broken into roughly fifteen pieces and stacked onto eight railroad flatcars. German designers and experts that went with before UB I pontoons to Pola worked under the supervision of KapitÄÂ¤nleutnant Hans Adam, leader of the U-vessel exceptional direction (). Normally, the UB I get together procedure took around a little while. 

While "UB-14" advanced toward Austria-Hungary, von Heimburg and his German team were alloted to "UB-15" at Pola. The submarine was briefly dispatched into the German Imperial Navy before a consequent exchange to the Austro-Hungarian Navy as its . Von Heimburg and his German group, with one Austrian officer on board, increased significant involvement in "UB-15"/"U-11", sinking the on that U-vessel's first watch. "UB-15"/"U-11" was given over to the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 16 June, and von Heimburg and his team were exchanged unblemished on 21 June to "UB-14", which was as yet a couple of days from consummation. 

At the episode of World War I in August 1914, Italy had declined to join its Triple Alliance partnersÃ¢ÂÂGermany and Austria-HungaryÃ¢ÂÂin proclaiming war against the Entente Powers, and selected to stay unbiased. Weight from the United Kingdom and France influenced Italy to sign the mystery 1915 Treaty of London on 26 April, in which Italy guaranteed to leave the Triple Alliance and proclaim war against its previous partners inside a month as an end-result of regional increases after the finish of the war. Since Italy at first announced war just on Austria-Hungary, Germany and Italy were not formally at war. As a result, German submarines working in the Adriatic and the Mediterranean were altogether doled out Austrian numbers and flew the banner of Austria-Hungary when making assaults on Italian vessels; "UB-14" was relegated the assignment of "U-26" and entered onto the moves of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, in spite of the way that she remained totally under German control. As per antiquarian Lawrence Sondhaus, this double numbering framework mirrored the nearby submarine participation between the two nations and still makes it hard to recognize submarines of the two naval forces. 

On 1 July, "UB-14" joined the Pola Flotilla (), and withdrew before long on her first watch. The evening of 6/7 July, Italian defensively covered cruisers that had as of late been conveyed at Venice embraced an "observation in power" off Pola trying to debilitate future Austrian fights against the Italian coast. At the point when the Italian boats resigned in the early morning hours of the seventh, "UB-14" was about off Venice. At sunrise, the defensively covered cruiser encountered "UB-14" and was torpedoed. "Amalfi" rapidly started inclining to port and sank inside 30 minutes with the loss of 67 men. At removal, "Amalfi" was one of the biggest boats sunk by U-pontoons amid the war. "UB-14" got away from the scene without harm. 

Enver Pasha and other Turkish pioneers had been begging their German and Austrian partners to send submarines to the Dardanelles to help assault the British and French armada beating Turkish positions. As a feature of the German reaction, "UB-14" was requested to Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) to join ; sister vessels and ; and the UC I pontoons and in the Constantinople Flotilla (). Since her moderate refueling stop at Bodrum was past her restricted range, "UB-14" withdrew Pola under tow from an Austrian destroyer on 15 July 1915. "UB-14"s motor and gyrocompass severed down while Crete, leaving the vessel dead in the water for a period, yet impermanent fixes by the team empowered the pontoon to make Bodrum on the 24th. A fix team from Constantinople was dispatchedÃ¢ÂÂhaving to go via train and camel just to reach "UB-14"Ã¢ÂÂand the ship was prepared to continue her adventure on 13 August. 

Not long after withdrawing Bodrum, "UB-14" had quite recently cleared the Greek island of Kos and was off the adjacent island of Kandeloussa when von Heimburg located a few potential unfortunate casualties. The primary ship seen was the British emergency clinic deliver , made a beeline for Alexandria from the Dardanelles. Von Heimburg, seeing the legitimately recognized medical clinic deliver, permitted "Soudan" to pass left alone. The following boat was not all that fortunate, notwithstanding. It was the unescorted , a Canadian sea liner squeezed into troopship obligations. "Regal Edward" was going the other way from "Soudan": from Alexandria to the Dardanelles with fortifications for the British 29th Infantry and a little gathering with the Royal Army Medical Corps, every one of whom were bound for Gallipoli. Von Heimburg propelled one of his two torpedoes from about a mile (2Ã¢Â km) away and hit "Regal Edward" in the stern; the ship sank stern-first in six minutes, with an extensive death toll. "Soudan" and a few different boats had the capacity to safeguard about 700 men, however more than 900 kicked the bucket. "Imperial Edward", at , was likewise among the biggest boats hit by U-vessels amid the war. While avoiding the salvage ships, which included two French destroyers, "UB-14"s compass separated once more, driving an arrival to Bodrum on the morning of the fifteenth. 

After fixes were finished at Bodrum, "UB-14" proceeded on her way with a traveler, Prince Heinrich XXXVII Reuss of KÄÅstritz (of the Reuss Junior Line) who required section to Constantinople. Amid the voyage north, "UB-14" happened upon another completely stacked troopship close to the island of Efstratis, about from Lemnos. At 09:51 on 2 September, von Heimburg propelled a solitary torpedo at the British troopship , which was conveying for the most part Australian troops set out toward Gallipoli. The torpedo scored a hit on the starboard bow of the liner, which quickly started to list toward that path. As the men boarded rafts to relinquish transport, another torpedo barely missed the stricken ship. The British seaplane transporter sped to the scene of the assault, and safeguarded almost 700 men from the water. The clinic deliver was additionally on the scene and saved a sizable number. A gathering of around 40 volunteers remained on board "Southland" to support the team, and with some towing help from "Ben-my-Chree", had the capacity to shoreline the ship on Lemnos. Altogether, less than 40 men passed on in the assault; among "Southland"s survivors was James Martin, who, upon his demise under two months after the fact, turned into the most youthful Australian known to have kicked the bucket in the war. The stricken ship had gotten genuine harm, however was later fixed and come back to support. As with "UB-14"s initial two targets, "Southland" was likewise the biggest boats hit by U-vessels, giving von Heimburg and "UB-14" three exploited people from the rundown of the biggest in their initial three assaults. 

After the assault on "Southland", "UB-14" separated again and put in at Chanak to anticipate fixes. While there on 4 September, word happened to the British submarine entrapped in Turkish antisubmarine nets off Nagara Point. Von Heimburg, Prince Heinrich, and "UB-14"s cook, a man by the name of Herzig, set out in a paddle boat to watch the Turkish endeavors to obliterate "E7". After a few mines that shaped piece of the net had been exploded without any result, von Heimburg and his gathering paddled out and over and again dropped a plumb line until it reached metal. At that point, von Heimburg dropped a Turkish sinker mine with an abbreviated wire directly over "E7". After the hand-dropped dig exploded excessively close for the British submarine's skipper's solace, he requested his vessel surfaced, relinquished, and abandoned. Between shellfire from the Turkish shore batteries and "E7"s leaving charges, von Heimburg and organization barely gotten away mischief. While most sources credit "E7"s sinking to the Turkish endeavors, creator Robert Stern fights that von Heimburg and "UB-14" merit halfway credit for the downfall of "E7". 

After "UB-14"s fixes were finished, she proceeded to Constantinople and, from that point, started a watch operating at a profit Sea on 3 October. Amid this watch, von Heimburg torpedoed the 474-ton Russian steamer "Katja" about northwest of Sevastopol on the seventh, and "Apscheron", a Belgian steamer confiscated by the Imperial Russian Navy, south of Cape Chersonesos on the eighth. After her arrival to Constantinople on the nineteenth, "UB-14" was set up for another watch operating at a profit Sea. Just before her planned takeoff, in any case, the U-vessel's goal was transformed from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara and von Heimburg and "UB-14" traveled south on 5 November. While "UB-14" had been in port on 30 November, Turkish powers had caught the before the submarine or any of the classified papers on board could be annihilated. Whenever "Turquoise" was gotten, her leader had not flagged her issue to anybody, so a planned meeting with the British submarine Ã¢ÂÂas far as anybody other than "Turquoise" or the Germans and Turks knewÃ¢ÂÂwas still on. "UB-14" had been sent to keep the meeting, purportedly venturing to such an extreme as to radio messages in the most recent British code. After landing at the assigned area, "UB-14" surfaced and terminated a torpedo at "E20" from a separation of . Just when "E20"s group saw the torpedo did they understand something was out of order, however it was past the point where it is possible to keep away from the weapon. The torpedo hit "E20"s conning tower and sank the submarine with the loss of 21 men. "UB-14" safeguarded nine men, including "E20"s skipper who, allegedly, had been brushing his teeth at the season of the assault. 

In December, von Heimburg was supplanted as "UB-14"s administrator by KapitÄÂ¤nleutnant Albrecht von Dewitz, yet toward the beginning of February 1916, von Heimburg continued order. "UB-14"s exercises among November and May are not revealed in sources, yet Paul Halpern reports that "UB-14" watched operating at a profit Sea off Trebizond from late May to early June, coming back to Constantinople without progress. 

On 17 June, von Heimburg was reviewed to Germany to direction the destined to-be-appointed , and was supplanted on "UB-14" by KapitÄÂ¤nleutnant Kurt Schwarz, a first time U-vessel administrator. Not long after Schwarz accepted order, "UB-14" was operating at a profit Sea in help of a July fight by the German battlecruiser and the light cruiser in the eastern Black Sea. Since the Russian armada, headquartered at Sevastopol, may have a chance to remove the German warships on the mission, "UB-14" was sent on station off Sevastopol. At the point when the Russian armada did foray, Schwarz endeavored to torpedo the , however was seen and driven off by Russian gunboat's screen of destroyers. 

After Romania joined the war in favor of the Triple Entente in August and was rapidly invaded by the Central Powers, the Russian endeavors operating at a profit Sea in the second 50% of 1916 were engaged in the west. Since German submarines never truly achieved such much operating at a profit Sea, the February 1917 resumption of unlimited submarine fighting drove the Germans to incidentally surrender the Black Sea in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. "UB-14"s whereabouts and exercises amid the last 50% of 1916 and the initial couple of long periods of 1917 are unreported in sources. 

On 28 May 1917, "Oberleutnant zur See" Ernst Ulrich supplanted Schwarz, and, before long, "UB-14" cruised on the principal German watch of the year operating at a profit Sea. On 5 June, "UB-14" sank the 155-ton Russian cruising vessel "Karasunda" north of Poti; "Karasunda" was the last ship credited to "UB-14". Other than to take note of that "Oberleutnant zur See" Bodo Elleke succeeded Ulrich in March 1918, there is no notice in wellsprings of "UB-14"s exercises between June 1917 and November 1918. 

After the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic marked the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers on 3 March 1918, leaving the war, powers of the Central Powers encompassed and later caught the port of Sevastopol. "UB-14" was at Sevastopol after the Germany marked the cease-fire bargain that finished all battling on 11 November. "UB-14" and the three other enduring Constantinople Flotilla vessels were incapacitated on 25 November. "UB-14" was abandoned operating at a profit Sea off Sevastopol in the early long periods of 1919.
