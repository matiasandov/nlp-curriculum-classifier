Mycena leptocephala 

Mycena leptocephala, regularly known as the nitrous hat, is a types of organism in the Mycenaceae family. The mushrooms have tapered grayish tops that reach up to in measurement, and slight delicate stems up to long. The gills are dim and remotely separated. The spores are circular, ordinarily measure 7Ã¢ÂÂ10 by 4Ã¢ÂÂ6Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm, and are white in store. At the point when seen under a light magnifying lens, the gills have plentiful axle formed cystidia on the gill edges, yet few on the gill faces. The mushroom is found in North America and Asia, where it develops separately or in gatherings on conifer needles, cones and sticks on the woods floor. It has a particular smell of fade; the edibility is obscure. Comparative species incorporate "Mycena alcalina", "M.Ã¢Â austera", and "M.Ã¢Â brevipes". 

The species was first called "Agaricus leptocephalus" by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1800, and was exchanged to the variety "Mycena" in 1876 by French mycologist Claude-Casimir Gillet. Equivalent words incorporate "Agaricus alcalinus" var. "leptocephalus" (Fries, 1821), "Mycena alcaline" var. "chlorinella" (J.E. Lange, 1914), and "Mycena chlorinella" (Singer, 1936). The last was decreased to equivalent word in a 1980 production by Dutch "Mycena" master Maas Geesteranus. 

"Mycena leptocephala" is grouped in the segment "Fragilipedes" of the class "Mycena", alongside other comparative looking mushrooms, for example, "M.Ã¢Â aetites", "M.Ã¢Â austera", "M.Ã¢Â parca", and "M.Ã¢Â aronsenii". A portion of these have a nitrous smell like "M.Ã¢Â leptocephala". 

The particular appellation "leptocephala" is gotten from the Greek ÃÅ¥Ã®Ä¾ÄÂÄÂÃ®Å¼ÄÂ "leptos", "slender" and ÃÅÃ®Ä¾ÄÂÃ®ÄÃ®Å¥Ã®Ë "kephale", "head", and alludes to the sensitive top. The mushroom is generally known as the "nitrous cap". 

The top of "M.Ã¢Â leptocephala" is in width, and at first a fat cone shaped shape with the edge squeezed near the stem. As the top grows, it turns out to be comprehensively conic to curved, some of the time extensively ringer molded, and now and again raised with a flaring edge. The top surface has a whitish sheen in light of its pruinose covering. The covering bit by bit swamps off, leaving the surface smooth and damp. The top shows outspread notches that layout the situation of the gills underneath. Its shading is at first gloomy earthy dim to blackish (after the pruinose covering has sloughed off), before long blurring from dim to light dark lastly ashy-dim. The tissue is slender and delicate, grayish, and has a marginally harsh (bitter) taste, and a pitifully soluble smell that fortifies in force if the substance is pounded. The gills are thin, equivalent in width all through, rising adnate (the gills join at substantially less than a correct edge, seeming to bend upward toward stem) and toothed. They are subdistantly dispersed, with 18Ã¢ÂÂ27 gills achieving the stem, and a couple of levels of lamellulae (short gills that don't expand completely from the top edge to the stem) mixed between them. The shade of the gills is colorless or cinereous, with pale and even edges. The stem is long, 1Ã¢ÂÂ2Ã¢Â mm thick, equivalent in width all through, empty, and exceptionally delicate. It is normally pale blue dark at first (darker than the top) however progressively turns shameful earthy dim, lastly blurs to gray or cinereous. The surface is thickly white-pruinose generally speaking, yet before long cleaned and translucent when the pruinose covering wears off. The stem base is about smooth to rather thickly white-strigose. The species has a particular dye like scent. Its edibility is at present obscure. 

The spores are comprehensively ellipsoid, amyloid (which means they will adsorb iodine when recolored with Melzer's reagent), and measure 7Ã¢ÂÂ10 by 4Ã¢ÂÂ6Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are typically four-spored, albeit two-and three-spored frames have been found on which the spores measure 11Ã¢ÂÂ14 by 6Ã¢ÂÂ6.5Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm or 8Ã¢ÂÂ10 by 3.5Ã¢ÂÂ4.5Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm, separately. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the substance of a gill) are dispersed, uncommon or missing, 30Ã¢ÂÂ44 by 9Ã¢ÂÂ13Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm, variable fit as a fiddle, fusoid-ventricose to club-formed, with some having a forked peak. The pleurocystidia that are club-molded every so often have a few finger-like prolongations. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are various, and comparable in morphology to the pleurocystidia. The tissue of the gill is homogenous, made out of developed hyphae that recolor vinaceous-darker in iodine. The tissue of the top has a well-separated pellicle, the cells of which bear various rodlike prolongations. The hypoderm (a layer of tissue quickly underneath the pellicle) is well-shaped, while the rest of the tissue is floccose; everything except the pellicle are vinaceous-darker in iodine recolor. 

The "stump pixie head protector" "Mycena alcalina" is a typical species that is comparable in appearance and smell to "M.Ã¢Â leptocephala". In any case, it develops on conifer wood and once in a while on the ground. Minutely, it has various cystidia on the gill edges. In spite of the fact that "M.Ã¢Â leptocephala" as a rule has a more fragile soluble smell and a progressively delicate stem, the quality of the scent of "M.Ã¢Â alcalina" is likewise very factor, so contrasts in smell can't be utilized as the sole distinctive trademark. "M.Ã¢Â austera", depicted from southern Norway in 1994, contrasts from "M.Ã¢Â leptocephala" by the absence of a nitrous scent, and contrastingly molded cheilocystidia and terminal cells of the cortical layer of the stem. Alexander H. Smith considers "M.Ã¢Â brevipes" near "M.Ã¢Â leptocephala", yet the previous mushroom has a short stem up to long, ordinarily develops independently, and comes up short on a smell. 

"Mycena leptocephala" is a saprobic species, which means it gets supplements from the breakdown of natural issue. Natural product bodies are discovered becoming dissipated to gregarious on fallen sticks and on needle covers under conifers, and are somewhat normal amid late-spring and again in the harvest time. Natural product bodies might be contaminated by the hood form "Spinellus fusiger". 

In North America, the organism is found in Canada (British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia), to Washington and south to California and North Carolina. In South America, the mushroom has been gathered in Venezuela. It likewise develops in the Archipelago of the Recherche, off the southern shoreline of Western Australia. In Europe, it is known from Britain, Finland, The Netherlands, Norway, and Spain It has additionally been found in different areas in Asia: the Vindhya Range of India; the Gwangneung Forest Museum in the Korea National Arboretum; and the snow capped zone of Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve, Jilin Province, China. The growth is additionally known from Arctic and Alpine areas, for example, Iceland, Greenland, and the Murmansk district.
