In spite of the fact that his group loses, their execution rouses Tripathi to send them to Australia all things considered. Bindiya is angry with Khan for picking Vidya over her as the Captain of the group. The outcome sees a misfortune in the competition with a 7-0 to Australia.

It must be conveyed with a specific tone, in a specific way".

A portion of the performing artists, for example, Chitrashi, Sandia, and Raynia, were thrown on the grounds that they were hockey players. 

Victimize Miller was the game activity executive, arranging the games scenes, and worked with Negi to prepare the performing artists. About working with Khan, Negi reviewed that everything was arranged "counting the punishment stroke that SRK missed. That shot alone took us almost 20 hours as I was sharp that it ought to be extremely sensible. I took the assistance of a great deal of my previous partners.
