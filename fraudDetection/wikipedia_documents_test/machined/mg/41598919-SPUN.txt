Soon thereafter, it made landfall in Cayo Romano, CamagÄÅºey Province, Cuba. Effect in Cuba and the Bahamas was constrained to bring down barometric weight readings and solid breezes. While crossing Cuba, the framework debilitated to a typhoon at an opportune time NovemberÃ¢Â 7, in the blink of an eye before rising into the Caribbean Sea. The tempest re-fortified into a storm soon thereafter and traveled southwestward.
