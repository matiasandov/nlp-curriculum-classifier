New York State Route 210 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 210 (NYÃÂ 210) is a state parkway in Orange County, New York, in the United States. It runs north from the New Jersey state lineÃ¢ÂÂwhere it proceeds with south as Passaic County RouteÃ¢Â 511 (CRÃÂ 511)Ã¢ÂÂalong the west shore of Greenwood Lake to the eponymous town of Greenwood Lake, where it closes at an intersection with NYÃÂ 17A. It was once any longer, as it initially expanded east along NYÃÂ 17A and CRÃÂ 106 in Orange and Rockland regions to Stony Point when it was doled out as a component of the 1930 renumbering of state interstates in New York. The course was truncated to its present length in 1982. Preceding getting to be NYÃÂ 210 in 1930, the street close by Greenwood Lake was a piece of NYÃÂ 55, a course associating New Jersey to Goshen, during the 1920s. 

NYÃÂ 210 starts at the New YorkÃ¢ÂÂNew Jersey state line in the town of Warwick, where it associates with CRÃÂ 511 in West Milford Township, Passaic County, New Jersey. Like CRÃÂ 511 in New Jersey, NYÃÂ 210 is the essential lakeside roadway along Greenwood Lake, an interstate lake found generally similarly in New Jersey and New York. NYÃÂ 210 travels north from the state line along the western edge of the base of a profound valley encompassing the lake to a network known as Indian Park, completely arranged on the lofty grade driving far from the lake. The course proceeds to the eponymous town of Greenwood Lake, situated at the northern tip of the lake. 

NYÃÂ 210 enters the town focus from the west on Jersey Avenue. It pursues the town road for four squares to Windermere Avenue, where it swings to pursue that road toward the upper east. The course ends nine squares later after converging NYÃÂ 17A north of the town focus. 

From 1930 to 1982, NYÃÂ 210 expanded eastbound into Rockland County. This expansion was basically comprised of a few roadways that were beforehand part of a secretly looked after street. On MarchÃ¢Â 10, 1824, the New York State Legislature passed a law consolidating the Monroe and Haverstraw Road Company. The new organization was entrusted with structure a freeway from the villa of Monroe (presently Southfields) east to the town of Haverstraw, where it finished at an intersection some place in the town. The interstate organization stopped to exist on AprilÃ¢Â 28, 1870, when the lawmaking body passed a law revoking the 1824 record that made the road organization. The parkway was hence sold off so as to satisfy the obligations of the organization and to fund fixes to spans along the street. 

At the point when Harriman State Park opened in 1910, the MonroeÃ¢ÂÂHaverstraw interstate was renamed Southfields Road. After three years, a segment of the course turned out to be a piece of Seven Lakes Drive, a noteworthy expressway worked to cross the recreation center. In 1916, Rockland County numbered its interstates out of the blue. The Rockland County area of the previous Monroe and Haverstraw Road was assigned as CRÃÂ 416 right now. From 1919 to 1920, the thruway was reproduced and revamped to state benchmarks. 

In the late 1920s, what is presently NYÃÂ 210 was initially assigned as a feature of NYÃÂ 55, a connector between NYÃÂ 17 in Goshen and the New Jersey state line south of the town of Greenwood Lake. In the 1930 renumbering of state parkways in New York, NYÃÂ 55 was consolidated into two longer courses: NYÃÂ 210 from New Jersey to Greenwood Lake and NYÃÂ 17A from Greenwood Lake to Goshen. At first, NYÃÂ 17A finished in Greenwood Lake while NYÃÂ 210 proceeded with east to U.S. RouteÃÂ 9W (USÃÂ 9W) on the banks of the Hudson River in West Haverstraw. From Greenwood Lake to Southfields, NYÃÂ 210 was steered on current NYÃÂ 17A. The course proceeded with east from that point along Southfields Road toward the eastern edge of Harriman State Park, so, all things considered it went to West Haverstraw by means of Willow Grove and Letchworth Village streets, Suffern Lane, and Railroad Avenue. 

By 1933, NYÃÂ 17A was stretched out eastbound along NYÃÂ 210 to Southfields, finishing the substitute circle of NYÃÂ 17, while NYÃÂ 210 was realigned on its east end by 1938 to finish at USÃÂ 9W in Stony Point. Rather than following Willow Point Road, the interstate stayed on present day Gate Hill Road to the region of Stony Point, where it entered the village on Main Street. It was rerouted again somewhere in the range of 1968 and 1973 to sidestep Main Street toward the south on Central Drive. 

On AprilÃ¢Â 1, 1980, possession and upkeep of the segment of NYÃÂ 210 from NYÃÂ 17 to the OrangeÃ¢ÂÂRockland province line was exchanged from the territory of New York to Orange County as a major aspect of a roadway support swap between the two dimensions of government. After two years, the segment of the course inside Rockland County was diverted over from the state to the region. Accordingly, NYÃÂ 210 was truncated to the previous western end of its cover with NYÃÂ 17A in Greenwood Lake. The previous directing of NYÃÂ 210 is currently assigned as CRÃÂ 106 in both Orange and Rockland areas. 

Throughout the years, something like two deadly mishaps have happened on the segment of NYÃÂ 210 that keeps running close by Greenwood Lake. On JulyÃ¢Â 15, 1940, a Brooklyn couple was executed when their vehicle struck a stone edge close to the lake. Two others were harmed in the mishap. On DecemberÃ¢Â 1, 1968, three were murdered and one individual was harmed when two autos had a head-on crash only north of the New Jersey state line.
