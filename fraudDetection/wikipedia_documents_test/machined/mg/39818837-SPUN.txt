Nyanyi Sunyi 

Njanji Soenji (Republican Spelling: Njanji Sunji; Perfected Spelling: Nyanyi Sunyi; Indonesian for "Melodies of Solitude" or "Tunes of Silence") is a 1937 verse gathering by Amir Hamzah. Kept in touch with some time after the artist was compelled to wed the little girl of the Sultan of Langkat rather than his picked love in Java, this accumulation comprises of 24Ã¢Â titled ballads and bits of melodious composition, none of which are dated. First distributed in the magazine "Poedjangga Baroe", the gathering has been republished as an independent book a few times. 

Examination of "Nyanyi Sunyi" has concentrated on the subject of God and His relationship to humankind, just as of parts of human presence: destiny, disappointment, and break. Abstract commentators H.B. Jassin and Zuber Usman see the gathering as an endeavor to address AmirÃ¢ÂÂs common issues. The gathering has been noted as hard to peruse attributable to its use of seldom utilized Malay and Javanese terms and premise in Islamic culture and Malay history. Regardless of this, "Nyanyi Sunyi" has been portrayed as more liberated in its structure than conventional Malay verse, with what artist Chairil Anwar named "minimally savage, sharp, but then short" sentences which conveyed another style to the Indonesian language. 

Amir Hamzah (1911Ã¢ÂÂ1946) was a Dutch-taught Malay essayist of respectable drop and faithful Muslim. He was well-arranged in conventional Malay writing, with top picks including chronicled messages, for example, "Hikayat Hang Tuah", "Syair Siti Zubaidah", and "Hikayat Panca Tanderan". Amir similarly perused works of Arabic, Persian, and Hindu writing. Accordingly, he had a broad vocabulary. 

Writer Laurens Koster Bohang considers the sonnets incorporated into "Nyanyi Sunyi" as having been composed somewhere in the range of 1933 and 1937, while Dutch researcher of Indonesian writing A. Teeuw dates the lyrics to 1936 and 1937. The time was one of extraordinary passionate strife for Hamzah, who was required to wed the little girl of the Sultan of Langkat, who had financed his examinations in Java. At the time Amir had purportedly begun to look all starry eyed at a Javanese lady while considering, and was compelled to abandon her. 

"Njanji Sunji" comprises of twenty-four titled pieces and an untitled quatrain. Indonesian artistic documentarian H.B. Jassin characterizes eight of the fills in as expressive composition, with the staying thirteen as lyrics. None of the works in "Nyanyi Sunyi" (and undoubtedly none of Amir's different works) are dated. Toward the finish of the book is a couplet, perusing "", which American writer and interpreter Burton Raffel deciphers as "A blossom gliding in a free bunch of hair/Gave birth to my troubled lyrics".

The lyrics in "Nyanyi Sunyi", in contrast to a lot of Amir's prior work, for the most part did not pursue the customary "pantun" and "syair" arrangement of four lines of four words. Teeuw takes note of that a few, such "Batu Belah", pursued conventional European structures, for example, the anthem. Others were all the more freestyle, inclining towards writing verse. 

Amir's style depends intensely on old Malay terms which saw minimal contemporary use. He likewise obtains vigorously from other Indonesian dialects, especially Javanese and Sundanes. The selection of words was impacted by the requirement for musicality and meter, just as imagery identified with specific terms. At last, in any case, Amir is more liberated in his language use than customary artists. Indonesian commentator Bakri Siregar composes that the outcome is "an excellent wit". 

Interpreter John M. Echols composes that the lyrics are "troublesome perusing notwithstanding for Indonesians", while writer Chairil Anwar depicted the fills in as "dark verse" which couldn't be comprehended by people without a comprehension of Islam and Malay history. Indonesian abstract researcher Muhammad Balfas takes note of that the work additionally has numerous inferences to religious writings, both Islamic and Christian. 

Anwar opined that Amir, through "Nyanyi Sunyi", conveyed another style to the Indonesian language, with its "minimalistically vicious, sharp, but short" sentences. In a 1945 article he composed (interpretation by Raffel), "Before Amir (Hamzah) one could call the old verse a damaging power; however what a brilliant light he shone on the new dialect". 

Religion and God are ubiquitous all through the gathering, as prove from the principal sonnet, "Padamu Jua". Amir regularly utilizes "Tuhan" ("God"). Be that as it may, dissimilar to his prior sonnets which utilized it along these lines to "Dewa" ("Deity"), in "Nyanyi Sunyi" the word is utilized as comprehended in Abrahamic religions, for example, Amir's own Islam; Amir indicates impacts from Sufism. Sometimes, composes Teeuw, Amir treats God nearly as a darling, utilizing commonplace terms, for example, "engkau" ("you") to address Him. In any case, Amir perceives that he can't be unified with God. Jassin composes that Amir appears to be mindful of his own diminutiveness before God, going about as a manikin for God's will; Teeuw noticed that Amir perceives that he would not exist if God did not. 

It is not necessarily the case that Amir acknowledges his lower position in connection to God; in a few cases, Jassin composes, Amir demonstrates a sentiment of disappointment over his own absence of intensity and challenges God's completeness. Teeuw in like manner takes note of a feeling of disappointment all through the lyrics, composing that Amir appears to regard God as an element that "just toys with people, enabling them to be pushed aside and eradicated". Somewhere else Teeuw composes that Amir addresses destiny and the requirement for him to isolate from his adoration. 

Beside topics of God and religion, Amir additionally demonstrates his very own consciousness humankind, perceiving his very own impulses and drives. Jassin composes that "Amir's melody is the tune of a man's spirit", appearing and bliss which don't recognize class or doctrine. Teeuw takes note of a feeling of doubt, an inclination thatÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ having once lost his loveÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ there is no reason Amir won't lose his next sweetheart. Indonesian commentator Zuber Usman, in the mean time, examines the subject of adoration lost in connection to religion, composing that the loss of his Javanese darling drove Amir closer to God. 

Jassin composes that Amir utilizes "sunyi" ("quietness") as an approach to address his common issues: with respect to time, his own personality, God, and love. As indicated by Jassin, before the finish of the arrangement physical love has floated towards an otherworldly one, with the appropriate responses provided beginning from the heavenly. At last, nonetheless, Jassin presumes that Amir's spirit has not achieved development; he thinks about the gathering's last lyric, "Astana Rela", as yet a transitory departure. Jassin finds that the topic of religion is in like manner implied as a break from Amir's common distresses, an assessment resounded by Usman. 

"Nyanyi Sunyi" was first distributed in the November 1937 issue of "Poedjangga Baroe", a scholarly magazine which Amir had built up. It was later distributed as an independent book, and by 1949 it had seen its third printing. 

In 1941 Amir distributed another accumulation of ballads, entitled "Buah Rindu" ("Fruits of Longing"), which comprised generally of his before works. Jassin noticed that the works in "Nyanyi Sunyi" seem more created and develop than those in the later gathering. Teeuw takes note of that the later gathering was all the more expressly about sentimental love, instead of the religious love of "Nyanyi Sunyi".
