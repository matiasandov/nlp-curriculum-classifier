District Route 574 (Erie County, New York) 

District RouteÃ¢Â 574 (CRÃÂ 574) is an eastÃ¢ÂÂwest area course north of East Aurora in Erie County, New York, in the United States. The western end of the course is at New York State RouteÃ¢Â 16 (NYÃÂ 16) and NYÃÂ 78 in the town of Elma. Its eastern end is at Two Rod Road, a state-kept up northÃ¢ÂÂsouth interstate in the town of Marilla. The whole length of CRÃÂ 574 is named "Jamison Road". 

Portions of CRÃÂ 574 conveyed a state interstate assignment as ahead of schedule as 1930. By 1931, the sum of CRÃÂ 574 was assigned as New York State RouteÃ¢Â 422. Proprietorship and upkeep of NYÃÂ 422 was exchanged from the province of New York to Erie County on AprilÃ¢Â 1, 1980, and the NYÃÂ 422 assignment formally stopped to exist on SeptemberÃ¢Â 25, 1980. 

CRÃÂ 574 starts at a crossing point with NYÃÂ 16 and NYÃÂ 78 (Seneca Street) northwest of East Aurora in the town of Elma. The course travels eastbound along Jamison Road, passing south of a transcendently private neighborhood and north of a substantial mechanical complex. The last finishes after , and CRÃÂ 574 proceeds to a trade with the Aurora Expressway (NYÃÂ 400). CRÃÂ 574 converges Bowen Road (CRÃÂ 242) and (CRÃÂ 361) only east of the turnpike. 

As CRÃÂ 574 approaches the villa of East Elma, it meets Girdle Road (CRÃÂ 336). In East Elma itself, Jamison Road crosses Creek Road (CRÃÂ 134) and Hemstreet Road (CRÃÂ 172). Past East Elma, the land encompassing CRÃÂ 574 turns out to be less created and to a great extent ruled by developed fields. CRÃÂ 574 proceeds through the open fields and into the town of Marilla, where it closes at an intersection with Two Rod Road, a neighborhood blood vessel kept up by the New York State Department of Transportation as NYÃÂ 954G, an unsigned reference course. Preceding 1982, Two Rod Road was NYÃÂ 358. 

The bit of Jamison Road from Bowen Road to Maple Road was initially assigned as a feature of NYÃÂ 78 in the 1930 renumbering of state thruways in New York. By the next year, the total of Jamison Road was assigned as NYÃÂ 422. NYÃÂ 78 was realigned to pursue another directing between East Aurora and Depew while its previous steering from East Aurora to Lancaster was redesignated as NYÃÂ 78A. The NYÃÂ 78A assignment, which covered NYÃÂ 422 between Bowen Road and Maple Road, was evacuated . 

On AprilÃ¢Â 1, 1980, proprietorship and upkeep of NYÃÂ 422 was exchanged from the province of New York to Erie County as a component of a bigger thruway support swap between the two dimensions of government. The NYÃÂ 422 assignment was evacuated on SeptemberÃ¢Â 25, 1980, enabling Jamison Road to move toward becoming CRÃÂ 574.
