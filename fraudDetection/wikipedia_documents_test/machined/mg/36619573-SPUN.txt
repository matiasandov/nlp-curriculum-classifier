Serious Tropical Cyclone Dina was a twister that caused record flooding crosswise over pieces of RÄÅ¡union. Beginning from a tropical aggravation on 15 January 2002 close to the Chagos Archipelago, the forerunner to Dina immediately created inside an area favoring tropical cyclogenesis. By JanuaryÃ¢Â 17, the framework had sufficiently grown sorted out convection as it moved southwestward to be announced a tropical despondency. Fast strengthening happened presently, with the framework accomplishing twists in abundance of 120Ã¢Â km/h (75Ã¢Â mph) on JanuaryÃ¢Â 18. Dina accomplished its pinnacle force on JanuaryÃ¢Â 20 as an extreme tropical typhoon winds of 215Ã¢Â km/h (130Ã¢Â mph). Hours in the wake of achieving hits quality, the tempest circumvent Rodrigues Island going to its north. On JanuaryÃ¢Â 21, the tempest brushed Mauritius and RÄÅ¡union as a serious tropical violent wind before turning southward. Once on a southward course, consistent debilitating resulted and the framework in the end progressed into an extratropical typhoon on JanuaryÃ¢Â 25. The remainders of the tempest quickened southeastward and were keep going noted on JanuaryÃ¢Â 28 before being ingested into a polar trough. 

Crosswise over Mauritius and RÄÅ¡union, heavy rains and dangerous breezes from the violent wind brought about broad to "cataclysmic" harm.

On JanuaryÃ¢Â 15, a tropical aggravation started sorting out close to the Chagos Archipelago in the South Indian Ocean union zone, which is an all-inclusive zone of convection associated with the rainstorm. The rainstorms slowly sorted out, related with a powerless course and situated inside a region of moderate breeze shear. An unmistakable low weight region created on JanuaryÃ¢Â 16, about east of Diego Garcia. The rainstorms were fundamentally situated along the western outskirts because of proceeded with shear, and normally would avert critical improvement. The framework moved toward the southwest along the north side of an edge, and notwithstanding the shear it formed into a tropical unsettling influence late on JanuaryÃ¢Â 16. Hence, the framework quickly sorted out, creating rainbands as the convection expanded. 

At 0000ÃÂ UTC on JanuaryÃ¢Â 17, MÄÅ¡tÄÅ¡o-France (MFR) overhauled the aggravation to a tropical despondency, and after six hours updated the framework further to Tropical Storm Dina. Presently, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical violent wind development alert, and soon thereafter started warnings about 425Ã¢Â km (265Ã¢Â mi) south of Diego Garcia. Dina immediately heightened, and its T-numbers utilizing the Dvorak system expanded by 0.5 at regular intervals amid the tempest's advancement stage. An eye started growing late on JanuaryÃ¢Â 17, and at 1200ÃÂ UTC on JanuaryÃ¢Â 18, MFR updated Dina to a tropical violent wind, or what might be compared to a CategoryÃ¢Â 1 sea tempest on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. This was just 36Ã¢Â hours after it was first named a tropical unsettling influence, which is substantially less than the five days most tropical violent winds take. Around three hours sooner, the JTWC had likewise updated the tempest to tropical twister status. 

The little eye of Dina, just in measurement, rapidly turned out to be well-characterized, in spite of the fact that it moved toward becoming clouded by the focal thick cloudy on unmistakable satellite symbolism. On JanuaryÃ¢Â 19, the violent wind eased back as it swung toward the west-southwest, after the edge to its south increased. The heightening rate quickly impeded, before Dina quickly increased late on JanuaryÃ¢Â 19, turning into a serious tropical violent wind promptly the following day. Encompassed by an eyewall of profound convection, Dina escalated to achieve its pinnacle power on JanuaryÃ¢Â 20. In view of satellite power assesses between , the JTWC evaluated top one-minute supported breezes of 240Ã¢Â km/h (150Ã¢Â mph), about north-upper east of Rodrigues Island. At around a similar time, MFR evaluated top ten-minute breezes of 215Ã¢Â km/h (130Ã¢Â mph). While at its pinnacle, Dina had an exceptionally symmetrical structure, and blasts were assessed to have come to .

This unexpected move in tract occurred as the violent wind communicated with the high territory of RÄÅ¡union. Moreover, Doppler climate radar demonstrated the most elevated reflectivity esteems to be from the middle. On JanuaryÃ¢Â 23, Dina debilitated underneath extreme tropical violent wind status while it quickened toward the southwest; the adjustment in development was because of the edge moving further toward the southeast. Expanded breeze shear because of a moving toward trough added to the debilitating, and by late on JanuaryÃ¢Â 23 the eye dispersed. The following day, Dina debilitated into a typhoon, after the convection lessened around the inside. Late on JanuaryÃ¢Â 24, the JTWC ceased warnings, and about 24Ã¢Â hours later, MFR grouped Dina as an extratropical violent wind. The framework quickened toward the southeast and was consumed by a polar trough on JanuaryÃ¢Â 28.
