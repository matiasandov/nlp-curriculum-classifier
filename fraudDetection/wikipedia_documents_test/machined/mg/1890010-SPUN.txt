"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily" was composed by Ian Maxtone-Graham and coordinated by Jim Reardon as a feature of the eleventh period of the show (1999Ã¢ÂÂ2000). At the point when the composition staff considered the thought for the speedway parts, they were suspecting that it would be an incredible open door for them to get a few NASCAR drivers to show up in the scene. Be that as it may, as per Scully, they couldn't get a solitary one since "they were altogether worried about the manner in which we were depicting NASCAR". Speedway hustling is delineated in a negative light in the scene, with an overemphasis on accidents. 

The scene includes the passing of the character Maude Flanders, who had recently been voiced by cast part Maggie Roswell. This slaughter off was the aftereffect of Roswell leaving "The Simpsons" in spring 1999 after a compensation question with the Fox Broadcasting Company, which affectation the show. Since 1994, she had been flying between her Denver home and Los Angeles two times every week to record scenes of "The Simpsons". She in the long run became worn out on this, and the cost of plane tickets was always expanding. Thus, she approached Fox for a salary increase from $2,000 per scene to $6,000 per scene. In any case, Fox just offered her a $150 raise, which did not take care of the movement costs, so she chose to stop. 

Voice on-screen character Marcia Mitzman Gaven was procured to fill in for Roswell's characters, incorporating Maude in this scene and the prior scenes of the eleventh season, in spite of the fact that the makers chose to murder her off to open up new storylines for the show. Official maker Mike Scully said it "was an opportunity for one of our ordinary characters [Ned Flanders] to confront a test and develop toward another path. The thought came up rapidly, we as a whole hooked on to it, and it just felt right. We would not like to murder a character for executing. We needed it to have ramifications for enduring characters to manage in future scenes." Roswell came back to "The Simpsons" in 2002 in the wake of achieving an arrangement with Fox to record her lines from her home in Denver. Since returning, she has voiced Maude in flashbacks and as a phantom. At the point when asked by "The Denver Post" on how she thought Ned was managing without Maude, she answered: "alright. Yet, Maude was such a defenseless character. Maude and Lisa and Marge were the main defenseless characters, truly, every other person has an edge. So they [the staff] found that circular segment was lost, and now there are a great deal of flashbacks with Maude." 

Scully has noticed that "there was a great deal of exchange about ensuring we [the staff] dealt with a portion of the passionate consequences of death [in the episode] and not simply make everything joke, joke, joke. And yet, we're a satire, they're vivified, they're not genuine." In one of the primary contents for the scene there was a scene in which Rod and Todd talk about their mom's demise. Notwithstanding, as indicated by Maxtone-Graham, the composition staff chose to cut it since "it just never played anything besides dismal." He included that the scholars "truly needed to address how [the children] would feel" however they "would never pull it off without it simply being miserable." Scully has remarked that it was an "exceptionally sweet scene" yet it was too hard to "even consider getting out of it comedically to the following scene." 

American performer Shawn Colvin visitor featured in the scene as Rachel Jordan, a character that she would later come back to voice in the scene "I'm Goin' to Praiseland" (2001) from season twelve. In that scene, she remains at the Flanders' home with Ned, and leaves quickly after he endeavored to shape her in the picture of his expired spouse. Toward the finish of the scene, in any case, she returns and has a date with him. Colvin told the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" that being brought up in Carbondale, Illinois implied she didn't need to do much research for the visitor appearance: "It's simply secluded [in Carbondale]. There was church music and that was about it. [...] I didn't need to burrow unreasonably profound for the job. I guess the entire 'Simpsons' thing is somewhat similar to a hick town." Colvin has demonstrated a section of her visitor job on "The Simpsons" amid a portion of her shows, including one at Cape Cod Melody Tent in 2007. She has likewise played out the tune that she sings in "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily" in show. The "Wisconsin State Journal" announced that amid her 2001 show at Barrymore Theater, the "most intense gathering of people reaction came after she sang a tune that she executed as a character on "The Simpsons"." The tune, called "He's the Man", later showed up on the 2007 soundtrack collection "". 

The scene initially broadcast on the Fox arrange in the United States on FebruaryÃ¢Â 13,Ã¢Â 2000. It tied "Dateline NBC" for the seventeenth spot (thought about the season normal of 37) in the appraisals for the seven day stretch of February 7Ã¢ÂÂ13, 2000, with a Nielsen rating of 10.7. The scene was the most elevated evaluated appear on Fox that week, and was seen in around 10.8Ã¢Â million family units. 

Scully has conceded that another explanation behind murdering off Maude was to build appraisals for "The Simpsons" amid the February clears. To acquire much more watchers for the communicate, the "Simpsons" makers decided not to uncover in advance who the character that would be murdered off was to make theory. Fox likewise chose not to convey screener tapes to TV pundits to keep it a mystery. In any case, as indicated by an article in the "Contra Costa Times" that was distributed on the day the scene circulated, "all the development gossipy tidbits recommend that Ned Flanders' significant other, Maude, should watch her back." The disclosure of the scene's title, "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly", was one reason that the media and numerous individuals suspected Maude. As "The Post-Standard"s William LaRue expresses, "diddly" is the "commonplace welcome of Maude's better half, Ned Flanders." Roswell's reported takeoff fortified this doubt. 

The scene has gotten blended audits from TV faultfinders. Gregory Hardy of the "Orlando Sentinel" put it at number eleven on his rundown of the show's fifteen best scenes that objective the universe of games. Composing for IGN, Robert Canning gave the scene a 7 out of 10 rating, remarking that he thought the three demonstrations felt detached. He stated: "First Maude kicks the bucket, at that point Ned dates and now Ned questions his confidence. To me, these three storylines would have been better off had they been the focal point of their own individual scenes." Canning included that he felt "the scene settled on a poor decision by racing through the grieving time frame and moving directly into Ned dating," yet that "the dating stuff, while, once more, feeling rushed, was very interesting, particularly Ned's date with Edna Krabappel." 

DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson remarked on the scene in a negative manner, composing that it was "a cruel and skeptical move [to murder off Maude as a result of Roswell's departure], however I could excuse the choice on the off chance that it delivered an additionally fulfilling scene. Maybe the journalists made this one super-genuine to check the natural criticism behind its beginnings, however the show just appears to be sappy and weak." "Winnipeg Free Press" feature writer Randall King wrote in his survey of the eleventh period of "The Simpsons" that there is "something unquestionably clever about having Maude Flanders bite the dust by a blast of T-shirts terminated via air guns at a speedway. In any case, the scene Alone Again Natura-Diddily was verification that the reliably splendid arrangement could Ã¢ÂÂ and did Ã¢ÂÂ turn out badly when it turned 11. Slaughtering off Maude was a wrongdoing [...]". 

Before "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily" was communicated, a limited time business circulated on TV that highlighted, in addition to other things, the declaration that "a standout amongst Springfield's most adored will kick the bucket" and a bit of a scene from the scene with the character Lenny, sitting in the speedway onlooker stand, being hit by a vehicle tire, giving the feeling that he would be the person who might bite the dust. Numerous watchers of the business, including Speedway Motorsports, Inc. possessed Lowe's Motor Speedway president and open location host Jerry Gappens, communicated their worry as it showed up the scene was caricaturing a real episode that occurred amid a speedway race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in May 1999, in Charlotte, North Carolina, when flying flotsam and jetsam in an accident executed three onlookers. Gappens said that completing a spoof of that was "a genuine inhumane activity, entirely flippant. Clearly what may seem entertaining in L.A. or then again New York isn't amusing here in Charlotte." Lowe's Motor Speedway declared to WSOC-TV's "Channel 9 Eyewitness News" on FebruaryÃ¢Â 7,Ã¢Â 2000 that they were considering setting a grievance to the Fox Broadcasting Company. WCCB, the then-Fox partner in Charlotte, would not keep appearing business for the scene. Subsequently, Fox appropriated another business to the associate on February 9 that did not contain the scene with Lenny. 

Antonia Coffman, a representative for "The Simpsons", told "The Charlotte Observer" that "the Lowe's occurrence didn't motivate the scene" and that the scene was not intended to irritate anybody. After WCCB had gotten the chance to really observe the scene they concluded that they would air it, understanding that the first business was misdirecting and that they didn't think the scene was ridiculing the occurrence. In the scene, the watchers can see that Lenny endeavors to get the consideration of the team promoters by raising his hand so they point a T-shirt with the gun at him. Be that as it may, he is hit by a vehicle tire. Not at all like what the business suggested, Lenny isn't slaughtered and is before long back in his seat. WCCB told the Associated Press that their understanding of the scene was that somebody tossed the tire to Lenny on the grounds that he was raising his hand, and that the tire did not really originate from an auto collision on the track. Regardless of this, the associate declared that they would begin the communicate of the scene with a message cautioning watchers of the scene in any case.
