A large portion of the structure was worked in the mid 14thÃ¢Â century. Nonetheless, a few sections date to around 1230, and there is proof recommending a prior chapel on a similar site. In 1904, a to a great extent unblemished and abnormally point by point painting was found on the west divider portraying the Last Judgment as depicted in . 

The congregation is committed to St.ÃÂ George, supporter holy person of England. The minister of St George's additionally administers the ward of Rogate with Terwick, and most administrations are held at St.ÃÂ Bartholomew's congregation in Rogate: only two administrations a month happen at Trotton.

The yard seems, by all accounts, to be a 17thÃ¢Â century expansion. There is a tomb of Margaret deÃÂ Camois in the nave. It has been proposed that its area there, instead of the chancel as would be normal for the group of the master of the estate (which her surname recommends she was), may demonstrate that the congregation was based on the site of a prior, littler, church and the tomb was in the chancel of that congregation. Nearby antiquarian Roger Chatterton-Newman deviates, saying there would be no requirement for a congregation on the site any prior.

In 1904, the whitewash was expelled from the west divider and a divider painting from the in all respects beginning of the congregation was found. This, in itself, isn't exceptional. A lot of early houses of worship have divider depictions; be that as it may, this one was strangely rich and nitty gritty. In the inside is Jesus Christ, underneath him is Moses and on his privilege is the "Licentious Man" encompassed by the Seven Deadly Sins. To his left side is the "Profound Man" encompassed by the Seven Acts of Mercy. These two characters are delineated on the contrary sides of Christ than is common in such portrayals of the Last Judgment.

The landmark was depicted by Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner as "one of the greatest, most elaborate and best safeguarded brasses in England". 

The nave contains a record stone with a metal of Margaret de Camois (kicked the bucket 1310). This is the most established known metal of a lady in England. A fifteenth century specialty tomb existed once in the past in the south divider, however had been to a great extent evacuated by 1780. The table-tomb of Sir Roger Lewknor (passed on c. 1478) makes due in the north-east corner of the chancel. Its sides show trim themes and thin etched specialties.
