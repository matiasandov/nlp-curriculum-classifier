Louise Lehzen 

Johanna Clara Louise Lehzen (3 October 1784 Ã¢ÂÂ 9 September 1870), otherwise called Baroness Louise Lehzen, was the tutor, and later counselor and sidekick, to Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. 

Destined to a Lutheran minister in Hanover, in 1819 Lehzen entered the family unit of the Duchess of Kent and her better half Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn. After five years, Lehzen moved toward becoming tutor to their single kid, Princess Victoria (Alexandrina). Lehzen turned out to be unequivocally defensive of her, who dwelled in a family unit ruled by the controlling Kensington System, actualized by the Duchess and her representative Sir John Conroy. "Dear, great Lehzen" before long came to override all others- - including her own mom - in AlexandrinaÃ¢ÂÂs eyes. 

At that point Princess Alexandrina turned out to be second-in-line to the British honored position in 1827; to keep her from being encompassed by ordinary people, King George IV made Lehzen a Baroness of the Kingdom of Hanover soon thereafter. Lehzen urged the princess to end up solid, educated, and autonomous from the Duchess and Conroy's impact, causing contact between the two and Lehzen. Endeavors to expel the tutor, who had the help of AlexandrinaÃ¢ÂÂs uncles George IV, William IV, and Leopold I of Belgium, were fruitless. 

At the point when Victoria progressed toward becoming ruler in 1837, Lehzen filled in as a kind of informal private secretary, getting a charge out of condos neighboring Victoria's. The Queen's marriage to Prince Albert in 1840 prompted huge changes in the illustrious family. Albert and Lehzen disdained one another, and after a sickness of the Princess Royal in 1841, Lehzen was unobtrusively expelled. Her cozy association with the Queen reached an end, in spite of the fact that the two kept on composing letters to one another. Lehzen spent her last a very long time in Hanover on a liberal benefits, biting the dust in 1870. Student of history K. D. Reynolds composes that Lehzen was a noteworthy impact on Victoria's character, specifically giving her the quality of will to endure her vexed youth and life as a youthful ruler. 

Johanna Clara Louise Lehzen was conceived in Hanover on 3 October 1784, the most youthful of seven little girls and two children of Lutheran minister Joachim Friedrich Lehzen and his significant other Melusine Palm. Constrained by conditions to work for her living since she was youthful, Lehzen was utilized by the von Marenholtzes, a highborn German family, where she earned sparkling references. 

In light of these references, Lehzen turned out to be a piece of the family unit of Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld in December 1819, when she filled in as tutor to twelve-year-old Princess Feodora of Leiningen, the little girl of the princess by her first marriage. Princess Victoria was then hitched to the Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, who was, at the time, fourth in line for the British position of authority. Lehzen and the whole family unit were moved to England in 1817 with the goal that the new Duchess of Kent's tyke may be conceived there, reinforcing the youngster's case to the position of authority. The infant was a young lady, initiated "Alexandrina Victoria" after her mom and her guardian, Alexander I of Russia; she would grow up to be Queen Victoria. 

The Duke of Kent passed on all of a sudden in 1820, pursued rapidly by his dad, King George III. Victoria's uncle, the Prince Regent, rose the royal position as King George IV. Victoria was presently third in line to the honored position, after her uncles the Duke of York and the Duke of Clarence, both of whom were well past middle age and neither of whom had authentic beneficiaries. As the reasonable inevitable beneficiary, Victoria must be instructed as needs be. Feodora was presently 14, and never again required the administrations of a tutor. After the expulsion of nursemaid Mrs. Brock, Lehzen Ã¢ÂÂ as she was constantly known in the family unit Ã¢ÂÂ took more than five-year-old Victoria's consideration in 1824. The Duchess and her controller, John Conroy made the arrangement not just on the grounds that Lehzen was German (instead of English), yet additionally in light of the fact that they trusted she was probably not going to work freely of their desires. 

Twentieth century history specialist Christopher Hibbert portrays Lehzen as "an attractive lady, in spite of her pointed nose and jaw, cunning, enthusiastic, humorless." Though she at first dreaded Lehzen's stern way, "dear, great Lehzen" before long came to possess a spot in Victoria's heart that supplanted all others, including her very own mom, the Duchess of Kent. Lehzen urged the princess to doubt her mom and her mom's companions, and to keep up her freedom. The tutor was uninterested in cash and needed aspiration for herself, rather dedicating her time and vitality to the princess. Victoria took to calling Lehzen "Mother" and "dearest Daisy" in private, composing Lehzen was "the most warm, dedicated, joined, and impartial companion I have." As a component of the controlling Kensington System formulated by Conroy, after 1824 Victoria was to be joined by Lehzen consistently amid the day; therefore Lehzen was not permitted out to walk out on Victoria until the Duchess expelled her at evening time, and was required to hold the princess' hand when Victoria plummeted a staircase. 

In 1827, the Duke of York kicked the bucket, making the Duke of Clarence beneficiary hypothetical, and Victoria second-in-line to the honored position. Conroy grumbled that the princess ought not be encompassed with ordinary people, driving George IV to grant them the two titles; Lehzen turned into a noble of the Kingdom of Hanover. George IV himself kicked the bucket in 1830, and was appropriately prevailing by his sibling the Duke of Clarence, who moved toward becoming King William IV. William formally perceived Victoria as his beneficiary hypothetical. As indicated by Lehzen, around this time the celebrated scene occurred, in which Lehzen slipped a duplicate of the lineage of the House of Hanover into one of the princess' exercise books. In the wake of scrutinizing it for quite a while, Victoria came to see that her dad had been next in line after the ruler, and that Queen Adelaide had no enduring kids. This was the first opportunity Victoria came to understand the predetermination that had been accepted by numerous individuals since her introduction to the world; that she would be the following British ruler. After stopping for a moment, Victoria is accounted for to have said "I will be great." This story went into society legend for future English ages. 

Ruler William delegated his companion, the Duchess of Northumberland, as Victoria's authentic tutor in 1831, yet the job was for the most part formal, and the princess kept on relying upon Lehzen. The Duchess was expelled in 1837 by Victoria's mom, the Duchess of Kent, for endeavoring to turn out to be increasingly powerful in Victoria's training. Amid this time, Lehzen held no official position at court; in spite of her as of late obtained title, her plebeian status kept on being a block. 

The desire of the Duchess and Conroy to keep Victoria reliant on their will was bypassed by Lehzen, who needed her charge to turn into a solid, educated lady. As Victoria developed more seasoned, endeavors were made by Conroy and the Duchess for Lehzen's expulsion, or possibly the decreasing of her impact. Such strategies demonstrated ineffective, as the princess turned out to be more dedicated to Lehzen than previously, as obvious in her diaries. Lehzen's solitary genuine companion in the family unit, Baroness Spath, had been all of a sudden rejected in 1828 on the requests of Conroy; bits of gossip flourished that the noble saw "familiarities" among him and the Duchess. Individuals from George IV's court theorized that Lehzen would be the alongside leave, yet she stayed quiet on the issue and safeguarded her position. In 1835, the Duchess of Kent kept in touch with her little girl a stern letter requesting that Victoria build up a progressively formal and less close association with Lehzen. That year (in which Victoria turned sixteen), plans to expel Lehzen went into disrepair after she devotedly breast fed Victoria through a five-week ailment. Lehzen supported a debilitated Victoria in her refusal to sign a report arranged for her by Conroy and the Duchess that would promise him a position when she progressed toward becoming ruler. Amid her residency, Lehzen had the help of George IV, William IV, and another of Victoria's uncles, Leopold I of Belgium, who all trusted that she was fundamental to the princess' wellbeing, satisfaction, and proceeded with protection from Conroy's impact. 

The training Victoria got from Lehzen was simple however strong. As opposed to the common dispositions of the time, Lehzen, guide Dr. George Davys, and others effectively urged Victoria to appreciate getting information. Davys was placed accountable for the "strong bureau of her investigations", while Lehzen focused on the "more fancy divisions, for example, moving. Picking up an "illuminated training", the princess figured out how to communicate in French, German, Latin, and English, preferred history and was shown financial aspects, geology, arithmetic, legislative issues, workmanship, and music. Lehzen was severe, however remunerated the princess when she was dutiful. In another takeoff from the period, Lehzen utilized practically zero flogging; at any rate, there is no record of it in the family unit accounts. 

At the point when Victoria rose the royal position in 1837, Lehzen delighted in an unmistakable position at the crowning ordinance, and stayed at court. Lehzen was introduced at Buckingham Palace as a kind of informal private secretary, filled in as boss contact for the illustrious homes, and conveyed the family unit keys as an indication of her position; her mark was required for all installments of tradesmen's bills, for example. Now, it appears that Lehzen had completely supplanted Victoria's mom both regarding impact and friendship; Lehzen's lofts bordered the queen's, while the Duchess of Kent was introduced in a suite of rooms far expelled from Victoria's. For the initial couple of long stretches of Victoria's rule, particularly before her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840, Lehzen affected the ruler's point of view toward both governmental issues and individual issues, notwithstanding the way that she didn't unmistakably include herself in state issues. Indeed, even after the ruler's marriage, Lehzen held the private entryway into the imperial room, a wellspring of disappointment for Albert. 

The happening to Prince Albert prompted critical changes in Victoria's family unit. Lehzen had contradicted Coburg desire of Victoria wedding Albert, trusting the princess to be a "second Queen Elizabeth, virgin and free of male impact." Albert was knowledgeable, and had recently finished a voyage through Europe, gone before by years at the University of Bonn. Victoria's court daunted his puritan German sensibilities. Lehzen and Albert before long built up an abhorrence for one another; she tried to impede Albert's will in different ways and he discovered her by and by disgusting and dishonorable of get to know the ruler, alluding to her as "the witch" and an "insane idiotic intriguer". 

At the point when Victoria's first kid, Victoria, Princess Royal, was conceived on 21 November 1840, Victoria trusted Lehzen to make the courses of action for the nursery staff. Lehzen put the nursery in the hands of a Mrs. Southey, a Mrs. Roberts, and Sir James Clark, regardless of Albert's complaints that Clark was completely unsuited to the post, having effectively undermined himself amid the issue of Lady Flora Hastings a year already. In the end, the Princess Royal became sick, however the clumsy Dr. Clark announced it a minor affliction, inaccurately recommending her with calomel. Truth be told, the youthful Princess Victoria had turned out to be genuinely sick. Albert, who was committed to his first-conceived, stood up to Victoria on the inadequacy of the staff chosen by the Baroness. There was a fight, after which Albert pronounced that he would leave the undertaking in her queenly hands, and be it on her head if the youngster kicked the bucket. Not long after this contention, Victoria surrendered to him and at last rejected Lehzen, apparently for her wellbeing. To Albert, Lehzen was a worker who had endeavored to transcend her place throughout everyday life, and he needed Victoria to depend on only him. 

Reports of the purposes for Lehzen's takeoff fluctuated; court diarist Charles Greville noted she was leaving "for her wellbeing (as she says), to remain five or a half year, yet it is assumed never to restore." "The Times" anyway detailed that she was basically visiting companions in Germany. After her takeoff, family consultant Baron Stockmar commented of the undertaking that[I]t was not without extraordinary trouble that the Prince prevailing with regards to disposing of [Lehzen]. She was absurd enough to challenge his impact, and not to adjust herself to the adjustment in her position... In the event that she had done as such, and assuaged the P[rince], she may have stayed in the Palace as far as possible of her life. 

At the point when Lehzen was expelled from the court in 1842 she came back to her local Germany, living in BÄÅºckeburg close Hanover. She lived with her sister on the liberal benefits that Victoria sent her, and secured the dividers of her home with pictures of the ruler. Despite the fact that her sister kicked the bucket a while later, the noblewoman kept on supporting monetarily her numerous nieces and nephews. Lehzen kept on in regards to Victoria with friendship, and the ruler composed routinely to her previous tutor, week by week at first and later month to month at Lehzen's solicitation. When visiting relations in Germany, the ruler came to visit her twice in private. The Baroness Lehzen passed on in BÄÅºckeburg on 9 September 1870, where she is covered in Jetenburger graveyard. Ruler Victoria requested the erection of a dedication to her. After Lehzen's passing, Queen Victoria discussed her appreciation for their relationship, however remarked "after I went to the honored position she got the chance to be fairly attempting, and particularly so after my marriage... [This was not] from any underhanded aim, just from a confused thought of obligation and friendship with me." 

Amid her time at the English court, Lehzen pulled in consideration outside of the imperial family unit for her cozy association with Victoria. She was reprimanded for her impact with the ruler, especially from the individuals who despised German impacts at court. Leaflets, many discharged by the Tory party, whined of the "stranger harbored in our nation" and the "underhanded guides" encompassing Victoria. One specifically, distributed as the "Notice Letter to Baroness Lehzen", proclaimed that a "specific outside woman pulled the wires of a malicious scheme of which Lady Flora was to be the principal injured individual," a reference to the Flora Hastings issue. Progressively constructive, "The Times" when depicted her as having essentially "held an exceedingly and carefully classified circumstance about the individual of the Sovereign." As an indication of the apparent political impact she had, in 1838 false bits of gossip recommended that Lehzen had been "changed over" to the Whig party, and that she had been offered "a pressing proposition of marriage" by Whig executive Viscount Melbourne. Regardless of the majority of this analysis, history specialist Gillian Gill portrays how Lehzen was straightforward and thrifty; even after Victoria climbed the honored position, she appears to have profited or rank, inclining toward rather to just be in the ruler's organization. Student of history K.D. Reynolds includes that Lehzen was a noteworthy impact on Victoria's character and good advancement, specifically giving the ruler the quality of will to endure her agitated adolescence and youthful queenship. Not every last bit of her impact was sure in any case; Reynolds likewise estimates that the 1839 Bedchamber emergency stemmed mostly from Victoria's reluctance to lose Lehzen. 

Aristocrat Lehzen has been depicted various occasions in film and TV. She was played by RenÄÅ¡e Stobrawa in the 1936 German film "MÄÂ¤dchenjahre einer KÄÅnigin", Greta SchrÄÅder in the movies "Victoria the Great" and "Sixty Glorious Years", Barbara Everest in 1941's "The Prime Minister", Magda Schneider in the 1954 TV sequential "The Story of Vickie", Olga Fabian in a scene of "Trademark Hall of Fame", Patience Collier in "Edward the Seventh", Diana Rigg in the 2001 TV sequential "Victoria and Albert", Jeanette Hain in the 2009 film "The Young Victoria" and Daniela Holtz in the 2016 TV arrangement "Victoria".
