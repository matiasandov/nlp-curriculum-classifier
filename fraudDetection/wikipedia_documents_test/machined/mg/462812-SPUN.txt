Stephen TomaÄºÄeviÃ¤Â of Bosnia 

Stephen TomaÄºÄeviÃ¤Â or Stephen II (, ÄÄÅÂÅÂÄÄ¾ÄÅ¼ÄÂ°ÄË/ÄÄÅÂÄÄ¾ÅÂÄÂ°ÄË ÄËÄÅ¾ÄÅºÄÂ°ÅÂÄÄ¾ÄËÄÂ¸ÅÂ; kicked the bucket on 25 May 1463) was the last sovereign from the Bosnian KotromaniÃ¤Â administration, authoritative as Despot of Serbia quickly in 1459 and as King of Bosnia from 1461 until 1463. 

Stephen's dad, King Thomas, had extraordinary desire for him. An endeavor to venture into Croatia appropriate by wedding Stephen to a rich aristocrat fizzled, and arrangements for a conjugal collusion with the Sforzas of Milan were relinquished when an increasingly esteemed open door introduced itself: marriage to the beneficiary Maria of Serbia. Celebrated in April 1459, it made Stephen the leader of the remainders of the neighboring nation. The plan was to join the Kingdom of Bosnia and the Serbian Despotate under Stephen to battle the extending Ottoman Empire. Stephen's Catholicism made him disagreeable in Orthodox Serbia. In the wake of decision it for only two months, he surrendered it to the infringing Ottoman powers and fled back to his dad's court, which earned him the hatred of the Hungarian lord Matthias Corvinus and other Christian rulers in Europe. 

Stephen succeeded his dad on the position of royalty following the last's demise in July 1463 and turned into the main Bosnian ruler to get a crown from the Holy See. The kingdom's presence, notwithstanding, was progressively compromised by the Ottomans. Ruler Stephen had the consistent help of his aristocrats in protection from the Ottomans, however not of the everyday citizens. He kept up a functioning correspondence with Pope Pius II, who excused him for the loss of Serbia and worked with him to save Bosnia for Christendom. The Hungarian ruler was mollified, however all Western rulers reached by Stephen would not help him. Sure that at any rate Matthias would go to his guide, Stephen wouldn't convey the standard tribute to the Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, which incited an intrusion. In May 1463, Mehmed walked into Bosnia, meeting minimal viable obstruction, and caught Stephen, who was then decapitated. The execution denotes the fall of the Kingdom of Bosnia to the Ottoman Empire. 

Stephen was naturally introduced to the House of KotromaniÃ¤Â as one of the two known children of the Bosnian ruler Thomas by an ordinary person named VojaÃ¤Âa. The other child kicked the bucket as a juvenile. Stephen's dad was an adulterine child of King Ostoja and a more youthful sibling of Radivoj, who challenged the standard of their cousin King Tvrtko II. Thomas was politically latent and did not participate in the battle between his sibling and cousin, empowering his family to have a calm existence in a period when the Ottomans endeavored to debilitate the Kingdom of Bosnia by empowering inner divisions. This all changed when the sickly and childless King Tvrtko II proclaimed that Thomas ought to succeed him. The King kicked the bucket not long after, in November 1443, and Stephen's dad rose the royal position. 

Ruler Thomas, raised as an individual from the Bosnian Church, changed over to Roman Catholicism in c. 1445; Stephen TomaÄºÄeviÃ¤Â later expressed that he had been sanctified through water into the Roman Catholic Church as a youngster, and that he had been shown Latin letters. At about that time, likely so as to take into consideration a serene answer for his extended war with the tycoon Stjepan VukÃ¤ÂiÃ¤Â KosaÃ¤Âa, King Thomas mentioned from Pope Eugene IV an invalidation of his association with Stephen's mom. Open fighting finished in 1446 with the marriage of Stephen's dad to KosaÃ¤Âa's little girl Catherine, by whom Stephen had a relative named Sigismund and a stepsister named Catherine. 

During the 1450s, King Thomas energetically hunt down reasonable life partners for the kids from his first association. Stephen's two sisters were offered in 1451, and in 1453 Stephen also entered his dad's contemplations. Wishing to deal with the allodial place that is known for Petar Talovac, who had represented Croatia appropriate as restriction for the benefit of the Hungarian lord, Thomas endeavored to have Stephen wed Talovac's widow, Hedwig Garai. KosaÃ¤Âa too hurried to wed the affluent widow, prompting an outfitted clash, however neither won because of an intercession by the Republic of Venice for Talovac's beneficiaries. 

The most punctual source referencing Stephen by name dates from 30 April 1455, when Pope Callixtus III put the King of Bosnia and his child under his security. Lord Thomas' aspirations for Stephen developed as he strived to set up nearer relations with the Western world. In 1456, he requested that the Pope secure a lady of the hour for his child, indicating that she ought to be a princess from a regal house. Exchanges before long started about Stephen's marriage to an ill-conceived girl of Francesco I Sforza, Duke of Milan, yet Stephen's dad had more noteworthy desires. 

At the point when Lazar BrankoviÃ¤Â, Despot of Serbia, kicked the bucket in 1458, an interregnum resulted. Having left three little girls and no children, he had no unmistakable beneficiary, so the power was shared between his blinded sibling Stephen and widow Helen Palaiologina. Lord Thomas exploited their shortcoming to recover Eastern Bosnian towns he had lost to Serbia in 1445. In a matter of seconds thereafter, he entered harmony arrangements with Lazar's widow, Helen Palaiologina. Surrendering the possibility of his child's marriage to a little girl of the Duke of Milan, Thomas went to a concurrence with Helen: Stephen was to wed the oldest of her three little girls by Lazar, the 11-year-old Helen. The match was lofty for Stephen not just on account of the lady of the hour's plunge from the Byzantine majestic family, yet in addition since it conveyed the legislature of Serbia to the husband to be. 

The Hungarian ruler Matthias Corvinus consented to Stephen's commitment with Helen Ã¢ÂÂ it was to his greatest advantage to make a solid support zone between his domain and the Ottoman Empire by joining the Kingdom of Bosnia and the Despotate of Serbia, which he considered Hungary's vassal states, under Stephen TomaÄºÄeviÃ¤Â. The Diet of Hungary affirmed Stephen TomaÄºÄeviÃ¤Â's entitlement to Serbia in January 1459. 

Stephen, joined by his uncle Radivoj, appropriately set out for Serbia however barely gotten away detainment amid an Ottoman assault on the Bosnian imperial living arrangement of Bobovac. He landed to Smederevo, capital of the Eastern Orthodox despotate, amid the Holy Week of 1459, and rose the Serbian royal position on 21 March. Michael SzilÄÄgyi, official for the underage King Matthias, touched base at the leader of a military to guarantee that order over the town's fortification would be expected by Stephen with no challenges. 

Stephen's marriage to Helen occurred on 1 April, the main Sunday following Easter. Following the probably Catholic function, the lady of the hour was known as Maria. He accepted the title of dictator, notwithstanding the way that the title was neither genetic nor attached to a particular region, however an allow from the Byzantine head. It is conceivable that his relative, an individual from Byzantium's last royal family, trusted that she reserved the option to concede the title without a ruler. Inside seven days of the wedding, Stephen banished his significant other's uncle from Serbia. Lord Thomas bragged to the Duke Milan that his child had been made tyrant "with the understanding and will of all the Rascians", yet Stephen's routine was not especially well known; recorders expounding on his treatment of his significant other's uncle reviled him as a dissident. 

It was obvious from the beginning that Stephen's reign in Serbia would be fleeting. The Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror considered Stephen's enthronement his very own unjustifiable infringement rights, for the Ottomans too considered Serbia their vassal state. Mehmed quickly propelled an assault on Smederevo in June, and there was no genuine thought of attempting to guard it. Lord Thomas hurried to his child's guide, endeavoring to redirect the Turks by laying attack to their post of Hodidjed, amidst Bosnia. Mindful that Smederevo couldn't withstand Mehmed's assault, Stephen surrendered the post on 20 June. The Ottoman continued to attach the remainder of the Serbian state to their realm inside a year. 

Following the fall of the town which Pope Pius II sadly named "the portal to Rascia", Stephen fled to Bosnia with his family and in-laws, looking for asylum at the court of his dad. The King of Hungary blamed Stephen and his family for offering Smederevo Fortress to the Ottomans "for an incredible load of gold", and the Pope at first trusted him. Pius' very own examination seems to have reached the resolution that Stephen did not sell the post, as the Pope did not rehash the case. Footstool, Bosnian and Serbian sources say nothing regarding the alleged selling out, so the claim is probably not going to be founded on certainty. The Serbian-conceived janissary Konstantin MihailoviÃ¤Â and the Byzantine Greek researcher Laonikos Chalkokondyles kept up Stephen's blamelessness and indicated out the quality of the Ottoman armed force. Both express that the Serbs inside Smederevo were so discontent with Bosnian principle and persuaded that the Ottomans would win (and concede them more religious resistance than the Hungarians) that they went out to meet Mehmed and gave him keys to the city. 

Ruler Thomas kicked the bucket in July 1461. As per later records, Thomas' passing was plotted by Stephen and Radivoj, and even Matthias and Mehmed were involved. Students of history expel these charges, nonetheless, bringing up that the King had been sick since June. Stephen climbed the position of royalty without trouble. He guaranteed that his uncle would not challenge the progression by liberally enriching him with land. The new ruler accepted the grandiose title acquired from Tvrtko I, the main Bosnian lord, styling himself as, "by the Grace of God, King of Serbia, Bosnia, the Maritime Lands, Zachlumia, Dalmatia, Croatia, and the Western terrains" Ã¢ÂÂ paying little mind to the way that Serbia had by then turned into an Ottoman pashaluk, that Croatia had been lost to Hungary during the 1390s, and that he needed to ask the legislature of the Republic of Venice to enable him to take shelter in Dalmatia if there should be an occurrence of an Ottoman assault. 

Quickly upon his promotion, Stephen set out to determine all contradictions inside the imperial family so as to fortify his very own position. His relations with his stepmother, the 37-year-old Queen Catherine, had been stressed amid his dad's lifetime, however he presently ensured that she would hold her title and benefits. Her dad, Stjepan VukÃ¤ÂiÃ¤Â KosaÃ¤Âa, kept in touch with Venetian authorities that the King had "accepted her as his mom", VojaÃ¤Âa having as of now kicked the bucket when he rose the royal position. KosaÃ¤Âa was the kingdom's most dominant aristocrat, and had been occupied with a ceaseless clash with Stephen's dad. It creates the impression that he in any case shunned asserting the Bosnian crown for his juvenile grandson Sigismund, Catherine's child and Stephen's stepbrother, most likely understanding that Bosnia required a solid, develop ruler in the season of hazard. Stephen TomaÄºÄeviÃ¤Â accepted the Venetians' recommendation to make harmony with his stepgrandfather, along these lines at last guaranteeing the honorability's supreme help of their ruler. He at that point concentrated on improving Bosnia's economy, which ended up more grounded than any time in recent memory amid his rule, and guaranteeing that the state would gather more benefit from the prospering metalworking exchange. 

Issues climbed soon as of now in the mid year of 1461, when Pavao Ä¹Â piranÃ¤ÂiÃ¤Â, who administered Croatia as restriction in the interest of the Hungarian lord and every now and again conflicted with King Thomas, caught a bordertown. By pre-fall, Stephen and KosaÃ¤Âa were planning to strike him together and partition his domain between themselves. Venice questioned, expecting that the strongholds Klis and Ostrovica, central to the guard of Dalmatia, may tumble to the Ottomans if first taken over by the Bosnians. 

Ruler Stephen squandered no opportunity to harden his relations with the Holy See. He sent a urgent request to Pope Pius, requesting that he send religious administrators, crusading weapons, and a royal celebration crown, just as to be prescribed to Matthias Corvinus. Stephen trusted that, with the Pope's asking, the Hungarian ruler would consent to give him military guide. On 17 November, the dining experience of Saint Gregory Thaumaturgus, who had been broadcasted "Protector of Bosnia" at imperial solicitation, the ecclesiastical legate and recently designated priest Nicholas of ModruÄºÄ delegated Stephen in the Church of Saint Mary in Jajce. It was the last royal celebration performed in Bosnia, just as the just a solitary one performed with a crown sent from Rome. It exemplified how, with the religious oppression set up by Thomas and with Stephen's dynamic correspondence with the papacy, the Kingdom of Bosnia obtained the character of a genuine Catholic state just at its very end. 

The remiss endeavor at blessing of the Bosnian government gravely irritated the Hungarian ruler Matthias, who saw the Pope's association in the crowning ritual as an encroachment of the privileges of Hungarian rights. Matthias ventured to such an extreme as to demand that the Pope pull back his help of Stephen. Pope Pius and Bishop John VitÄÅ¡z intervened in the debate between the rulers of Bosnia and Hungary, however the arrangements did not continue effectively. The relations were at long last fixed in the spring of 1462. Matthias was driven by the need to deliver the Crown of St Stephen from Emperor Frederick III, and Stephen was obliged to contribute. As an end-result of the Hungarian lord's great graces, Stephen was likewise required to surrender certain towns, swear fealty and to deny to pay tribute to the Ottomans. 

By the spring of 1462, it was realized that Mehmed had chosen to vanquish Bosnia. Stephen and KosaÃ¤Âa frantically looked for assistance from Christian rulers. The King kept up contact with the Pope, who had his legates stay for all time at the Bosnian illustrious court and who strived to focus however many warriors and as much weapons as could be expected under the circumstances in the undermined kingdom. The experts of the neighboring Republic of Ragusa were enrolled to verify the help of the Albanian ruler Skanderbeg, who was in this way permitted by the Venetians to go with his military through Venetian Albania on their approach to Bosnia. Venice itself guaranteed no help, recommending rather that Stephen and KosaÃ¤Âa should trust in their very own powers. Others, for example, King Ferdinand I of Naples, refered to local issues and offered simply moral help. 

While doing everything conceivable to verify remote guide, King Stephen found that there was little will to oppose inside the nation. He griped to Pope Pius that the neighborhood populace inclined towards the Ottomans, which may have been because of expanded misuse and perpetual fighting (instead of a steady Ottoman routine). The already implied discontent of compellingly changed over older folks of the Bosnian Church ended up unmistakable. As indicated by a contemporary, Stephen liberally offered endowments and respects so as to motivate steadfastness, and granted sustained towns to dishonest individuals, notwithstanding including previous "apostates". The best hit to the barrier endeavors, in any case, was the old clash among KosaÃ¤Âa and his child Vladislav HercegoviÃ¤Â, which was continued in the spring of 1462. Vladislav by and by looked for assistance from Mehmed soon thereafter, and the Ottoman ruler excitedly acknowledged. 

Urged by Matthias' duty to help and perhaps by the Bishop of ModruÄºÄ, Stephen TomaÄºÄeviÃ¤Â settled on a rash and deadly choice in June 1462. Pope Pius wrote in his journal that, "depending on one comprehends what trust", the King "rejected the tributes which his precursors had for some time been utilized to pay the Ottomans and had raged the town which the foe had worked at the conversion of Sava and Bosna to place dread into the Hungarians and Slavs." According to Chalkokondyles, Stephen welcomed the Ottoman diplomat to his fortune house and demonstrated to him the cash put aside as tribute, yet educated him that he would prefer to utilize it to fend off an Ottoman assault or to live off it in a state of banishment. Mehmed the Conqueror was maddened by Stephen's insubordinance and boldness. The Pope describes how, becoming aware of the Sultan's promise to vanquish his kingdom and pulverize him, Stephen brought the Bishop of ModruÄºÄ and censured him for chafing the Sultan. He told Nicholas to go to Hungary and look for prompt activity against the Ottomans, however no assistance at any point touched base to Bosnia from Christendom. Matthias, Skenderbeg and the Ragusans all neglected to complete their guarantees. 

In the spring of 1463, Mehmed assembled a multitude of 150,000 men in Adrianople and arranged to walk towards Bosnia. In his misery, Stephen TomaÄºÄeviÃ¤Â swung to the Sultan himself and attempted at last to acquire a 15-year-long dÃ©tente with him. KonstantinoviÃ¤Â asserted that he was available when the Ottomans hoodwinked the Bosnian agents into feeling that the King's solicitation for ceasefire was in truth, and that he endeavored to caution them about the trickery. Mehmed's military set out just after the emissaries. Strongholds fell quickly, and King Stephen fled with his family and assets from Bobovac to Jajce. The Ottoman armed force under the initiative of Mahmud Pasha AngeloviÃ¤Â laid attack to Bobovac on 19 May, with the Sultan going along with them the next day. AngeloviÃ¤Â was entrusted with catching the King. Trusting that Bobovac could withstand the attack for a long time, Stephen wanted to collect a military in Jajce, as yet relying on remote guide. He sent his better half with their assets to Dalmatia, while his stepmother took the rest to Ragusa. 

As opposed to Stephen TomaÄºÄeviÃ¤Â's desires, Bobovac fell inside days. The King had officially understood that he had no real option except to take asylum in the neighboring Croatia or Dalmatia. AngeloviÃ¤Â eagerly sought after him, and made up for lost time with him in KljuÃ¤Â. The Ottoman armed force was supposedly going to pass the city's post, not suspecting that the King was stowing away inside its dividers, when a nearby man uncovered his whereabouts as a byproduct of cash. A four-day-long attack of the post followed. Anxious to catch him, AngeloviÃ¤Â had his emissaries gravely guarantee the King that he would be done no damage in the event that he surrendered, and sent him a report promising him opportunity. With nourishment supplies and ammo running short, Stephen chose to surrender himself and his army to AngeloviÃ¤Â. AngeloviÃ¤Â, thusly, presented to him, his uncle Radivoj and 13-year-old cousin Tvrtko before Mehmed in Jajce. 

Stephen tried to charm himself with Mehmed by conveying requests to leaders and castellans to surrender, empowering his captor to assume responsibility for in excess of 70 towns in a single week. Mehmed, in any case, had no expectation of saving Stephen's life and brought him on 25 May. Stephen frightfully brought AngeloviÃ¤Â's record, however Mehmed's Persian-conceived mullah, Ali al-Bistami, issued a "fatwah" announcing that the Sultan was will undoubtedly keep the guarantee made by his hireling without his insight. As though to exhibit the legitimacy of his "fatwah", the old mullah took out his sword and executed Stephen before Mehmed. The recorder Benedetto Dei, who professed to have been a piece of the Sultan's entourage, recorded that Mehmed himself executed Stephen. As per later records, Mehmed had Stephen excoriated or utilized as a shooting target. The execution of the King, his uncle, cousin and two aristocrats occurred in a field alongside Jajce, which has since been known as Carevo Polje ("the Emperor's Field"). 

Stephen TomaÄºÄeviÃ¤Â was covered on a slope close Jajce. Europe was paralyzed to see the Bosnian state fall totally inside long stretches of his demise. The nation's brisk accommodation is said to be the outcome of a poor collaboration among Stephen and his aristocrats, yet it is maybe most precise to credit it to the general population's low spirit and general conviction that the success was unavoidable. Moreover, the religiously various Bosnians knew, much like the neighboring Serbians, that the nation would be overwhelmed by Hungary if not by the Ottomans, and that they would appreciate far less opportunity of religion and far higher assessments all things considered. In this way, opposition was not as solid as it could have been. Pope Pius' case that followers of the Bosnian Church double-crossed the kingdom is baseless. 

Stephen TomaÄºÄeviÃ¤Â's half-kin were taken to Constantinople and changed over to Islam. Ruler Catherine, his stepmother, left for the Papal States and fruitlessly crusaded for the reclamation of the kingdom; Bosnia just stopped to be a piece of the Ottoman Empire in 1908, 445 years after Stephen's passing. His widow, Queen Maria, spent an amazing remainder in the Empire. 

In 1888, the Croatian paleologist ÃÂiro Truhelka unearthed bones in a settlement near Jajce known as Kraljev Grob (which means King's Tomb) and found the skeleton of an executed grown-up male. The head was put on the chest, with two coins in the mouth. Despite the fact that in no way, shape or form certain, it was accepted that the skeleton had a place with Stephen TomaÄºÄeviÃ¤Â. Regardless of complaint from the monk Antun KneÄºÅ¾eviÃ¤Â, who contended for leaving the bones where they had laid for quite a long time and building a little church at the site, the skeleton was put in a glass box in the correct passageway of the Franciscan religious community in Jajce.
