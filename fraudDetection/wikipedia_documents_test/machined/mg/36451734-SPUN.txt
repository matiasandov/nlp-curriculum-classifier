A prequel to "A Town Called Mercy" was discharged solely onto iTunes, and titled "The Making of The Gunslinger". It portrays the real making and arrangement of the Gunslinger, from an ordinary humanoid body. It likewise has a clarification of the creation of the Gunslinger in voice-over by Kahler-Jex. 

The Doctor, Amy, and Rory touch base at the American Frontier town of Mercy. They find that nobody has had the capacity to leave or enter town because of activities of "The Gunslinger", who requests they turn over Kahler-Jex, an outsider researcher that collided with Earth years sooner. The townspeople safeguarded him, and in return, he furnished them with crude power and the way to stop a cholera flare-up. The town's marshal, Isaac, is reluctant of turning over his companion to the Gunslinger, regardless of being close to the finish of their provisions. 

The Doctor escapes to get the TARDIS yet discovers Jex's smashed ship and finds he was one of a few researchers that did obtuse examinations to make cyborgs on their war-torn homeworld. The Gunslinger arrives, and affirms the Doctor's hypothesis that he is one of Jex's examinations. He has looked for retribution and slaughtered everything except Jex. In spite of the fact that he can't hurt honest people by his programming, the Gunslinger cautions that Jex must be conveyed to him or he will take progressively extreme measures. 

The Doctor comes back to town, and irately hauls Jex to confront the Gunslinger. Amy declares that the Doctor has changed for the more terrible from long stretches of going individually.

As he bites the dust, Isaac gives the Doctor his marshal identification and has him guarantee to secure Mercy. The Gunslinger leaves, cautioning he will return for Jex around early afternoon tomorrow. 

Jex tells the Doctor he is sorry for each one of those passings his work has caused. The townsfolk request the Doctor turn Jex over, yet he advises them that Isaac's passing will be to no end on the off chance that they do as such, and has thought of an arrangement from finding out about Jex's general public. At the point when the Gunslinger arrives the following day, occupants wearing facial markings like Jex race through town, confounding the cyborg and permitting Jex to escape to his ship. Be that as it may, rather than taking off, Jex advises the Doctor he is prepared to confront equity in the great beyond, and makes the ship self-destruct. 

The Gunslinger with no further reason gets ready to make a trip a separation to self-destruct, yet the Doctor recommends another determination. As the Doctor, Amy, and Rory leave, the Gunslinger stands watch over Mercy as its new marshal. 

In hoping to give every scene of the arrangement an unmistakable vibe, showrunner Steven Moffat pitched the Wild West subject to author Toby Whithouse, recommending that the scene could be about a town threatened by a robot. Moffat was enthusiastic about putting Matt Smith in a Western setting, who he called one of the last individuals one would hope to supplant Clint Eastwood. Whithouse had recently composed the "Specialist Who" scenes "School Reunion" (2006), "The Vampires of Venice" (2010), and "The God Complex" (2011). Moffat had been getting ready for the initial five scenes of the arrangement to have "film marquee" topics. Whithouse noticed that it was a sort he had not composed previously, yet he "totally [loved] it". The Wild West has not been a setting for a "Specialist Who" scene since the 1966 third season sequential "The Gunfighters". Whithouse was exhorted not to watch "The Gunfighters" by different journalists, who said it was "not actually the gem in the crown". Whithouse felt obliged to incorporate basic Western tropes, for example, the Doctor riding a steed and a go head to head. He expressed the hardest scene to compose was the place the Doctor is compelled to utilize a firearm; the Doctor is a radical and he would require "the correct kind of passionate voyage". 

Whithouse favored the cyborg miscreant to be three-dimensional and thoughtful, which would expect it to have a "living awareness" as opposed to just be a "cruel robot". He needed its appear to be reminiscent of Frankenstein's beast, and later called the plan "phenomenal". It took around three and a half hours for Andrew Brooke to have all the make-up connected. Because of the ensemble, Brooke needed to act with simply his left eye. Smith had acclaim for visitor on-screen characters Ben Browder, who he said "[made] a decent cattle rustler" with "that incredible drawl", and Adrian Scarborough, who he said "takes the entire scene". Browder was offered the job and happily acknowledged; he knew about the show as his kids had watched it, and he likewise needed to complete a western. Whithouse was "excited" with Browder's execution, as it was the means by which he envisioned the character. 

"A Town Called Mercy" and the past scene, "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship", were the principal scenes to be created for the seventh arrangement, and both were coordinated by Saul Metzstein. The two scenes are Metzstein's first "Specialist Who" credits. A significant part of the scene was shot around the desert territory of AlmerÄÂ­a, Spain, where studios have constructed Wild West-style lanes that have been utilized really taking shape of more than 100 Western-set movies, for example, "A Fistful of Dollars". Recording the scene in Spain was less expensive than developing a set in the UK. Moffat expressed, "We knew from the begin we need some genuine area shooting for this one, and given the most notable American setting comprehensible, there was just a single spot to goÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ Spain." They supposedly taped there from 8 March to 17 March 2012. Taping occurred at Oasys/Mini Hollywood, and Fort Bravo/Texas Hollywood. While Smith was permitted to have a go at riding the pony, the majority of the activity appeared in the scene was finished by his stand-in.

McGrath likewise noticed a "bring home religious message" in the scene close to the end where the town accumulates in the congregation while the Gunslinger and the Doctor go head to head; he felt that it underscored the significance of esteeming human life. 

Gavin Fuller of "The Daily Telegraph" composed that the Western idea was "adequately window-dressing for Toby Whithouse's amazing profound quality story, where not all things be very as it appeared and proceeded to investigate issues of ethical quality, morals, heart and equity". "The A.V. Club" analyst Keith Phipps noticed that the "endless battle among request and tumult" was normal in Westerns, and the scene spoken to this with the subject of "what should win out: Lawless vengeance or cultivated equity?". Ian Berriman of "SFX" deciphered the fringe around Mercy as an illustration for the Doctor almost "crossing [the] line" and "[breaking] his very own ethical code".

Moreover, analysts noticed that the scene gave its characters "shades of dim", as opposed to high contrast scoundrels normally found in the show.
