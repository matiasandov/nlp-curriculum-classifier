New York State Route 149 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 149 (NYÃÂ 149) is an eastÃ¢ÂÂwest state expressway that keeps running for through the Capital District of New York in the United States. It starts at exitÃ¢Â 20 on the Adirondack Northway (InterstateÃ¢Â 87 or I-87) in the Warren County town of Queensbury and converges U.S. RouteÃ¢Â 9 (USÃÂ 9), USÃÂ 4, and NYÃÂ 22, among different courses, as it advances eastbound to its eastern end at the Vermont state line in the Washington County town of Granville. Here, the thruway moves toward becoming Vermont RouteÃ¢Â 149 (VTÃÂ 149) and proceeds for an extra to a convergence with VTÃÂ 30 in Rutland County. Both NYÃÂ 149 and VTÃÂ 149 cross for the most part country zones. 

NYÃÂ 149 was doled out in the 1930 renumbering of state roadways in New York and at first reached out from NYÃÂ 9L in Queensbury to NYÃÂ 22 south of Granville by method for an eastÃ¢ÂÂwest parkway worked amid the initial two many years of the twentieth century. It was curtailed to USÃÂ 4 , however stretched out westbound back to NYÃÂ 9L in the mid-1950s. It was stretched out further west to USÃÂ 9 in the late 1950s and to I-87 exitÃ¢Â 20 . In the mid-1960s, NYÃÂ 22 was rerouted to sidestep Granville toward the west. NYÃÂ 149 was then stretched out to Vermont by method for NYÃÂ 22's previous steering into the town and East Main Street. The short continuation of Granville's East Main Street in Vermont, assigned as Vermont RouteÃÂ 30B since 1935, was renumbered to VTÃÂ 149 in DecemberÃ¢Â 1966 to coordinate the New York number. 

NYÃÂ 149 authoritatively starts at exitÃ¢Â 20 on the northbound Adirondack Northway (I-87) in the town of Queensbury, from where it pursues an incline eastbound to USÃÂ 9. As marked, be that as it may, NYÃÂ 149 starts at the southbound bit of I-87 exitÃ¢Â 20 and pursues County RouteÃ¢Â 23 (CRÃÂ 23, named Gurney Lane) east to USÃÂ 9, where it swings to pursue USÃÂ 9 northward. The marked and authority routings join at the exit's northbound inclines. While simultaneous with USÃÂ 9, NYÃÂ 149 passes the Adirondack/Lake George Factory Outlet Mall and a few different organizations situated on the two sides of the parkway. Toward the finish of the industrial facility outlets in the villa of French Mountain, NYÃÂ 149 kills USÃÂ 9 and continues in a for the most part eastbound bearing toward the town of Fort Ann. 

Subsequent to going under a bicycle way bridge and a recreational vehicle leave, the course goes through a region of country private homes and lush zones arranged north of Glen Lake. At the northern tip of the lake, NYÃÂ 149 crosses Oxbow Hill Road, a connector to CRÃÂ 63 (Moon Hill Road) that is kept up by Warren County notwithstanding not being a numbered Warren County course. East of this intersection, the parkway swings toward the upper east and crosses the Blue Line into Adirondack Park in front of a convergence with CRÃÂ 7 (Bay Road). NYÃÂ 149 progresses forward, bending back toward the east as it passes the Queensbury Country Club and meets NYÃÂ 9L. The course enters Washington County and the town of Fort Ann generally later. 

The initial a few miles of NYÃÂ 149 in Washington County go through detached, country regions as it bends toward the north and south while following a for the most part eastÃ¢ÂÂwest arrangement. In West Fort Ann, the main network along the course between the region line and the town of Fort Ann, NYÃÂ 149 meets with Old State RouteÃ¢Â 149, a circle course of NYÃÂ 149 that was made when the expressway was realigned. The course proceeds with east from the network, leaving Adirondack Park and traverse Halfway Creek on its way into the town of Fort Ann, where it moves toward becoming Ann Street. Inside the town, NYÃÂ 149 passes the Fort Ann Cemetery and two squares of homes before meeting with USÃÂ 4 at George Street. NYÃÂ 149 swings toward the south, joining USÃÂ 4 along George Street through downtown Fort Ann. In the wake of passing the town park, USÃÂ 4 and NYÃÂ 149 leave the town and become anonymous as they head south into the town of Kingsbury. 

In Kingsbury, USÃÂ 4 and NYÃÂ 149 head through an open region dabbed with ranches and lakes. The courses continue southward to an intersection known as Baldwin Corner, where USÃÂ 4 and NYÃÂ 149 split. While USÃÂ 4 heads toward the southeast, NYÃÂ 149 proceeds due south, paralleling the Champlain Canal to a region known as Smith's Basin. Here, NYÃÂ 149 turns east and crosses both a railroad line and the canalÃ¢ÂÂwhich NYÃÂ 149 had been following since joining USÃÂ 4 in downtown Fort AnnÃ¢ÂÂto enter the town of Hartford. Here, the course winds its route eastbound through a country, for the most part undeveloped region of Washington County as it crosses a few area streets on its way to the village of Hartford. 

In Hartford, NYÃÂ 149 crosses both Christian Hill Road and CRÃÂ 23 (the fundamental road of the network) in front of an intersection with NYÃÂ 40 south of the network. The two courses combine here as NYÃÂ 149 pursues NYÃÂ 40 northward around the little network to an intersection east of the villa's inside, where NYÃÂ 149 kills toward the east and starts to go through progressively rustic regions of the town of Hartford and the nearby town of Granville. After intersection into Granville, the open territories along the course offer approach to thick woods. NYÃÂ 149 proceeds commonly northeastward through the town, going through the separated villa of Hillsdale before bending toward the southeast toward South Granville. At the focal point of the network, NYÃÂ 149 swings toward the upper east at a crossing point with CRÃÂ 27 and CRÃÂ 28. 

The course leaves South Granville, passing patches of trees and a sprinkling of homes as it makes a beeline for the fringe town of Granville. Only south of as far as possible, NYÃÂ 149 crosses with NYÃÂ 22. NYÃÂ 22 and NYÃÂ 149 quickly cover before NYÃÂ 22 forks off to sidestep Granville toward the west. NYÃÂ 149 proceeds into Granville, getting to be Quaker Street after entering as far as possible. The course continues through the town to its middle, where NYÃÂ 149 forks northeastward onto West Main Street and traverses the Mettawee River. At a crossing point with Church Street (CRÃÂ 26), NYÃÂ 149 turns out to be East Main Street and swings toward the southeast on its way to the Vermont state line, where the roadway moves toward becoming VTÃÂ 149. 

VTÃÂ 149 travels southeastward far from the developed town of Granville into a progressively provincial area of the Rutland County town of Pawlet, paralleling the Mettawee River as it advances ahead. It heads past homes and through a thick woods as it converges with Bull Frog Hollow Road soon after the outskirt. After Bull Frog Hollow Road, the course continues eastbound through a territory ruled by quarries. VTÃÂ 149 progresses forward, entering a progressively open region and passing just a couple of homes before completion at a crossing point with VTÃÂ 30 in Blossom Corners, a little, to a great extent uninhabited network inside the town of Pawlet. 

A few parts of NYÃÂ 149 were built amid the mid twentieth century when the province of New York accepted responsibility for of interstates over the state. The most punctual known developed segment of present day NYÃÂ 149 is the fragment between the southern end of the NYÃÂ 22 cover and the southern town breaking points of Granville. The state let a $10,850 (equal to $ in 2019) contract to improve the parkway, administratively assigned as a major aspect of State HighwayÃ¢Â 104 (SHÃÂ 104), on MayÃ¢Â 12, 1902. The roadway was added to the state thruway framework on OctoberÃ¢Â 6, 1902, after the fruition of the task. The segment of NYÃÂ 149 that covers USÃÂ 9 in Queensbury, assigned as a component of SHÃÂ 417, was improved under the terms of a $82,700 (equal to $ in 2019) contract granted on JulyÃ¢Â 10, 1906. It was added to the state parkway framework on JanuaryÃ¢Â 10, 1907. 

Different segments of present day NYÃÂ 149 were developed through the span of the following decade. In 1911, work started on the area of current NYÃÂ 149 between Smith's Basin and the northern intersection with NYÃÂ 40 in Hartford. The agreement for the segment in the town of Fort Ann (SHÃÂ 942) was let on JuneÃ¢Â 15 while the agreement for the segment in Hartford (SHÃÂ 802) was granted three months sooner on MarchÃ¢Â 30. The two activities were completed at the same time throughout the following two years. SHÃÂ 802 was added to the state interstate framework on FebruaryÃ¢Â 9, 1914, while SHÃÂ 942 was incorporated into the framework on MayÃ¢Â 5, 1914. Taking all things together, the improvement of the two state expressways cost $69,577.20 (identical to $ in 2019). 

In 1913, development started on the bit of what is currently NYÃÂ 149 in Granville south of North Street, inside assigned as SHÃÂ 5404. The $77,684.89 (comparable to $ in 2019) contract was granted on SeptemberÃ¢Â 5, 1913. The vital enhancements were made through the span of the following year and the parkway was joined into the state interstate framework on OctoberÃ¢Â 29, 1914. The last segment of NYÃÂ 149 with a realized development date is the segment simultaneous to USÃÂ 4 in Fort Ann (some portion of SHÃÂ 1224). An agreement for its improvement was let on JanuaryÃ¢Â 8, 1915 at an expense of $43,778.92 (proportionate to $ in 2019). The upgrades were made throughout the following year and the roadway was added to the state parkway framework on JanuaryÃ¢Â 10, 1916. 

At the point when the principal set of New York state courses were appointed in 1924, SHÃÂ 417 turned out to be a piece of NYÃÂ 6 while SHÃÂ 104 and SHÃÂ 5404 were incorporated into NYÃÂ 24 and SHÃÂ 1224 was assigned as a major aspect of NYÃÂ 30. NYÃÂ 6 was supplanted by USÃÂ 9 while NYÃÂ 30 was co-assigned as USÃÂ 4 between Glens Falls and Whitehall in 1927 after the formation of the U.S. Interstate System in late 1926. The rest of present day NYÃÂ 149 was unnumbered preceding 1930. 

In the 1930 renumbering of state thruways in New York, the NYÃÂ 30 assignment was reassigned somewhere else, leaving only USÃÂ 4 on the part of parkway that USÃÂ 4 currently shares with NYÃÂ 149. In the meantime, all of NYÃÂ 24 south of Middle Granville turned out to be a piece of NYÃÂ 22 while NYÃÂ 149 was doled out to the bit of its cutting edge arrangement between NYÃÂ 9L in Queensbury and NYÃÂ 22 south of the town of Granville. In July 1935, a few floods crushed numerous thruways in the territory of New York. One thruway influenced was NYÃÂ 149, as a scaffold conveying the parkway in the villa of South Granville was washed out. With the scaffold out, drivers were bypassed onto a town roadway (presently kept up by Washington County as CRÃÂ 27) to get to NYÃÂ 22 and Granville from South Granville and to get to NYÃÂ 40 from Granville. NYÃÂ 22 was additionally influenced by the flood as an extension in the town of Cambridge was washed out also. 

NYÃÂ 149 was truncated eastbound toward the southern end of its cover with USÃÂ 4 south of Fort Ann. The change went on for approximately 15 years before the parkway was reextended westbound to NYÃÂ 9L in the mid-1950s. It was expanded again in the late 1950s to pursue a previous, unnumbered roadway west to USÃÂ 9 in the Queensbury village of French Mountain. NYÃÂ 149 was changed again to meet the new I-87 at exitÃ¢Â 20, bringing about a short cover with USÃÂ 9. 

In Granville, NYÃÂ 22 was initially steered on Quaker, Main, and North lanes. It was rerouted in the mid-1960s to sidestep Granville on another thruway west of the town. NYÃÂ 149 was then expanded northward along NYÃÂ 22's previous directing to the intersection of Main and North boulevards in Granville. From that point, it proceeded with eastbound on Main Street to achieve the Vermont state line, where it associated with VTÃÂ 30B, a goad course of VTÃÂ 30 that had been set up since 1935. Vermont renumbered VTÃÂ 30B to VTÃÂ 149 in DecemberÃ¢Â 1966 to coordinate the parkway it presently associated with in New York. 

On JulyÃ¢Â 2, 2005, the Hadlock Pond Dam north of West Fort Ann fizzled, washing out four segments of NYÃÂ 149 close to that network. Thus, the part of the course between NYÃÂ 9L in Queensbury and USÃÂ 4 in Fort Ann was shut to all traffic. Following multi week, the expressway was revived, yet just for nearby traffic and development teams. It was revived to all traffic on JulyÃ¢Â 24. The off the cuff fix venture cost the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) $1.5 million (proportionate to $ in 2019). 

In 2007, the "Times Union" of Albany got letters from perusers mentioning that all of NYÃÂ 149 be extended from two to four paths. The letters were sent to NYSDOT, who reacted that despite the fact that the course was a critical recreational course between New York and Vermont, the measure of traffic that the course conveys was not sufficiently high to warrant a four-path isolated expressway. Furthermore, the state would likewise need to take a noteworthy number of properties along the roadway so as to augment it, which would influence the character of the territory. 

On JulyÃ¢Â 10, 2008, a tanker truck brimming with water collided with a tree along a segment of NYÃÂ 149 between Bay Road (CRÃÂ 7) and Ridge Road (NYÃÂ 9L) that includes a sharp bend. After the primary mishap happened at 3:10 a.m., a second tractor-trailer, who had ceased as a result of the tanker, came backward, jackknifing over the street and hitting a vehicle. The street was closed down for the mishap, where the driver of the tanker was taken to Glens Falls Hospital. The drivers of the vehicle and the tractor-trailer that jackknifed were not harmed. The course was revived by 11:40 a.m. This mishap was one of numerous tractor-trailer mishaps that has happened on this stretch of NYÃÂ 149. 

NYÃÂ 149 between Martindale Road in the town of Queensbury and the Washington County line was redesigned by New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) in the late 2000s. Development started on February 9, 2009 to redesign the long section. The task comprised of repaving the roadway in regions, yet additionally included broadening the shoulder to wide, remaking and rectifying NYÃÂ 149 close Martindale Road alongside a spot close to the Queensbury Country Club. Ducts would be supplanted, seepage frameworks would be redesigned and they would make another wetland alleviation zone aside of NYÃÂ 149. At last, left turn paths would be developed at NYÃÂ 9L and CRÃÂ 7 (Bay Road). Declared close by of a venture to recreate NYÃÂ 372, the undertaking would cost $8Ã¢Â million (2009ÃÂ USD) and given to Kubricky Construction Corporation, situated in Queensbury, with a slated finishing date of JuneÃ¢Â 2010. Be that as it may, by JulyÃ¢Â 2010, development had not been finished, as they simply had closed down NYÃÂ 149 somewhere in the range of NYÃÂ 9L and CRÃÂ 7. 

On December 19, 2012, NYSDOT reported a venture to recreate NYÃÂ 149 and its intersection with USÃÂ 4 in Fort Ann. The task would redesign the convergence by completing a general extension, requiring the judgment of one property. This new augmenting would help make abandons USÃÂ 4 south to NYÃÂ 149 west. The crossing point would be repaved and waste bowls on USÃÂ 4 and NYÃÂ 149, which would integrate with the framework on Clay Hill Road. NYSDOT's site takes note of that declared that offers of the new undertaking were reported in FallÃ¢Â 2013 with development starting before long. The slated date of finishing for the $1.3Ã¢Â million venture would be in FallÃ¢Â 2014.
