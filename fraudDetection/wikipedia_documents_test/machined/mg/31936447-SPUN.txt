Sie werden euch in nook Bann tun, BWV 183 

' (They will put you under expulsion), ', is a congregation cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He formed it in Leipzig for Exaudi, the Sunday after Ascension, and first performed it on 13 May 1725. The work incorporates some surprising woodwind scoring, two oboes da caccia and two oboes d'amore. 

Bach composed the cantata in his second year in Leipzig for the Sunday Exaudi, the Sunday after Ascension. The endorsed readings for the gala day were from the First Epistle of Peter, "serve one another" (), and from the second Farewell talk in the Gospel of John, the guarantee of the Paraclete, the "Soul of Truth", and the declaration of indictment (). 

A portion of the cantatas made by Bach in his second year were chorale cantatas, a configuration he decided for administrations between the primary Sunday after Trinity and Palm Sunday. For Easter he had come back to cantatas on progressively changed writings. Nine of the cantatas for the period among Easter and Pentecost depend on writings of Christiana Mariana von Ziegler, including this cantata. Bach later doled out it to his third yearly cycle. Ziegler starts the cantata with a similar citation from the gospel as an obscure artist one year sooner in , the forecast of oppression of Christians. "They will put you under expulsion, yet the opportunity will come, when, whoever slaughters you will imagine that he does God an administration by it" (). She keeps focusing on the absence of dread workable for a devotee who depends on "" (the defensive arm of Jesus). In developments 3 and 4 she alludes to the start of the gospel, the soul who will help. The end chorale is the fifth stanza of Paul Gerhardt's "". 

Bach originally played out the cantata on 13 May 1725. 

The signature score was acquired by C.P.E. Bach. 

The music was not distributed until 1891 when it showed up as a major aspect of the principal complete version of the composerÃ¢'s work, the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe. The manager of the volume being referred to was Alfred DÄÅrffel. 

Ziegler distributed the content in an accumulation of her work, alongside different ones set by Bach. These printed adaptations are marginally not quite the same as the writings utilized in the cantatas, and this is accepted to be the consequence of the writer altering the libretti with which he was exhibited. On account of "Sie werden euch in nook Bann tun" the contrasts between the printed form and that set by Bach are not exactly in the previous cantatas, for example, . 

Bach organized the cantata in five developments, starting with what John Eliot Gardiner depicts as a "shade raiser", a line from the gospel set as a recitative. This is trailed by a succession ariaÃ¢ÂÂrecitativeÃ¢ÂÂaria, and the cantata is finished up by a four-section chorale. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-section choir just in the end chorale, and a Baroque instrumental outfit in a bizarre mix of instruments, two oboes d'amore (Oa), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), a violoncello piccolo (Vp) and basso continuo. 

In the accompanying table of the developments, the scoring pursues the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The continuo, playing all through, isn't appeared. 

In the main development the expressions of Jesus are given to the bass, the voice type which by show was the (voice of Christ). A year sooner (in "Sie werden euch in nook Bann tun", BWV 44), Bach rendered the declaration of Jesus in a two-section development, a two part harmony for bass and tenor pursued by a disturbed theme. In this cantata, he sets it as a recitative of just five measures. The instrumentation is novel, having long harmonies of the four oboes, two oboes da caccia and two oboes d'amore, go with the voice over a pedal point held by the continuo. This makes a "sepulchral" sound. The Bach researcher Christoph Wolff takes note of that this "lavish oboe scoring" with every one of the four oboes playing together is utilized just in the two recitatives (1 and 3). 

The second development, the primary aria, is the longest of the work. It is sung by the tenor with an obbligato part for violoncello piccolo, an instrument with a tenor-bass range. The "dull and shaded" timbre of the development has been viewed as speaking to the insurance given by Christ. Preventing the dread from claiming the undermining passing, the violoncello piccolo plays ceaseless runs. 

Development 3 is again a recitativo accompagnato, considerably more intricate than the first; the strings play long harmonies, though every one of the oboes rehash a similar four-note theme all through the development, sung by the alto on the words "Ich container bereit" (I am prepared). 

The second aria is joined by the strings and the two oboes da caccia as one as obbligato instruments, in this manner the two arias are overwhelmed by instruments with a generally low range (oboes de caccia having a pitch beneath that of a typical oboe). 

The cantata is shut by a four-section chorale on the tune of "".
