Veerapandiya Kattabomman () is a 1959ÃÂ Indian Tamil-language true to life war movie delivered and coordinated by B. R. Panthulu. The film stars Sivaji Ganesan, Gemini Ganesan, Padmini, S. Varalakshmi, and Ragini, with V. K. Ramasamy and Javar Seetharaman in supporting jobs. Its soundtrack and score were made by G. Ramanathan. 

Delivered and appropriated by Panthulu under his flag Padmini Pictures, the film is inexactly founded on the account of Veerapandiya Kattabomman, the eighteenth century South Indian chieftain who defied the East India Company. It was an adjustment of the play of a similar name by Sakthi T. K. Krishnasamy which highlighted Sivaji Ganesan as the title character, and debuted in August 1957. Primary photography started in October that year, and occurred for the most part in Jaipur and Madras (presently Chennai) till late 1958. "Veerapandiya Kattabomman" was the primary Tamil film discharged in Technicolor. 

The film debuted in London on 10 May 1959, and was discharged in Tamil Nadu six days after the fact. "Veerapandiya Kattabomman" was widely praised; Sivaji Ganesan's execution as Kattabomman got far reaching acclaim, albeit some film researchers thought about components in the film, especially the depiction of the title character, to be verifiably off base. It was a business achievement, running for more than 25 weeks in theaters and turning into a silver celebration film. "Veerapandiya Kattabomman" was named and discharged in Telugu as "Veerapandiya Kattabrahmanna" around the same time, and in Hindi as "Amar Shaheed" the next year. 

The movie was the first in Tamil film to get global honors for Best Film, Best Actor, and Best Music Director at the 1960 Afro-Asian Film Festival in Cairo, and got a Certificate of Merit as a feature of the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil. "Veerapandiya Kattabomman" was re-discharged in 1984, and a carefully reestablished rendition was discharged on 21 August 2015; both got ideal audits. 

Veerapandiya Kattabomman, the chieftain of Panchalankurichi, is a fearless contender. On accepting updates on a burglary in his region, Kattabomman and his entourage set out in secret to catch the looters. Whenever caught, the looters admit that they had been procured by the British to make agitation in Kattabomman's area; the British had lured the neighboring chieftain, Ettappan, to help them annexe Panchalankurichi. 

Vellaiyammal, who lives in Chayalkudi, a town close Panchalankurichi, promises to wed the man who subdues her pet bull. She conveys her bull to Panchalankurichi for partaking in a jallikattu amusement supported by Kattabomman. Each one of the individuals who endeavor to tame the bull fizzle until Vellaiyathevan, Kattabomman's president, stifles the bull and wins Vellaiyammal's affection. Kattabomman later learns of their affection, and urges them to wed. 

The ruler gets a message from W. C. Jackson, the duty gatherer for Tirunelveli, which requests a gathering with him at Ramanathapuram to talk about installment. Chief Davison, Kattabomman's British companion, encourages him to see Jackson. Jackson, discovering that Kattabomman has accompanied his troops, requests to meet only him. At the gathering, Jackson affronts him and requests him captured. Encompassed by British troops, Kattabomman battles and escapes; be that as it may, his pastor Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai is caught. 

Some time later, Pillai is discharged and brings news that Jackson has been sent back to England at Davison's suggestion. A British delegate sent to Kattabomman's court by Colonel Ooshington, Tirunelveli's new income gatherer, reports that Pillai and his men have plundered their storage facilities and executed their men at Srivaikuntam. Pillai legitimizes his demonstration, saying that he educated his men to do it in view of the starvation in their kingdom. Embarrassed about Pillai's activity, Kattabomman blames him for burglary and murder. Pillai apologizes and offers himself as a detainee to the British, yet Kattabomman will not hand him over; rather, he offers cash to make up for the plundered rice. Ooshington denies the pay and, with Major Bannerman's and Ettappan's assistance, impels the neighboring rulers to assault Kattabomman. Bannerman is put responsible for the British troops; he and Ettappan plan to assault Panchalankurichi when the general population are going to a celebration in Tiruchendur. Kattabomman's government agent Sundaralingam advises the lord, who plans for war. 

Upon the arrival of the fight, Vellaiyammal asks Vellaiyathevan not to go on the grounds that she had a bad dream loaded with underhandedness signs the earlier night. Disregarding her pleas, Vellaiyathevan sets out and is murdered in the following fight. When she learns of her better half's demise, Vellaiyammal retaliates for him by executing the man who slaughtered him. She discovers Vellaiyathevan's body and, defeated by distress, falls dead crosswise over it. Bannerman's troops assault Panchalankurichi with substantial gunnery, and Kattabomman's military endures. The ruler, injured in the neck, is spared by his sibling Oomaithurai. Detecting that the fortification can't endure another gun torrent, Kattabomman and Oomaithurai escape to the connecting kingdom of Kovilpatti. Pillai, camouflaging himself as Kattabomman, distractions the British officers who are on the lord's trail. From Kovilpatti, Kattabomman and Oomaithurai escape to Pudukkottai. Thondaimaan, the ruler of Pudukkottai, is requested by the British to catch Kattabomman and Oomaithurai. Dreading the British, Thondaimaan catches them and hands them over. While Oomaithurai is imprisoned, Kattabomman is attempted by the British and hanged. 

Since youth, Sivaji Ganesan longed for playing the opposition contender Veerapandiya Kattabomman; he had left home at age seven to satisfy his fantasy. Quite a while later, while Ganesan and essayist Sakthi T. K. Krishnasamy were going through Kayatharu, where Kattabomman was hanged, Ganesan communicated a longing to create a play dependent on Kattabomman's life; his first introduction to acting was the point at which he saw "Kambalaththaar Kooththu", a road play about Kattabomman's life. Krishnasamy quickly concurred, and started to compose a content. Krishnasamy finished composition the content in a month's time. Krishnasamy's play, "Veerapandiya Kattabomman", debuted in Salem in late August 1957 and was performed by Ganesan's troupe, Sivaji Nataka Mandram. He had contributed almost for sets and outfits. When he saw the play, chief B. R. Panthulu chose to adjust it as an element film. Panthulu created the film rendition (additionally entitled "Veerapandiya Kattabomman") with his organization, Padmini Pictures. G. Dharmarajan, the play's set creator, was likewise doled out a similar group position for the film. W. R. Subbarao was marked as cinematographer, and R. Devarajan as proofreader. The screenplay was credited to a "history explore group", headed by M. P. Sivagnanam and comprising of Krishnasamy, Panthulu, Sivaji Ganesan, P. A. Kumar and Singamuthu. 

Before Ganesan and Panthulu, there were two fruitless endeavors to make a film on Kattabomman: in July 1948, Selvam Pictures declared its aim to deliver "Kattabommu" (the agitator's genuine name), which would star P. U. Chinnappa. The other endeavor was made by maker S. S. Vasan of Gemini Studios; a limited time blurb for the venture, entitled "Kattabomman", was discharged on 5 November 1953. A notice from Gemini, welcoming anybody with valuable data about Kattabomman and his adventures to send it to the studio's storyboard office, was distributed three days after the fact in the magazine "Ananda Vikatan". As per a 1957 article by Singapore-based "Indian Movie News", when Ganesan caught wind of Vasan's endeavor to make a film about Kattabomman, he requested that he relinquish the venture; Vasan concurred, and loaned Ganesan critical research material on Kattabomman. Film history specialist Randor Guy negated this in his 1997 book, "Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema", saying that journalists like Kothamangalam Subbu and Veppathur Kittoo were enlisted by Vasan to look into Kattabomman's life, and Vasan trusted that Ganesan, who had turned out to be prominent after "Parasakthi" (1952), was the main qualified decision to depict Kattabomman. Fellow noticed that Ganesan wavered to work with Vasan, since he was prior rejected for a job in "Chandralekha" (1948), prompting Vasan dropping the task. In spite of this, Ganesan later showed up in Vasan's later endeavors, "Irumbu Thirai" (1960) and "Engine Sundaram Pillai" (1966). 

Ganesan initially offered the job of Vellaiyathevan to S. S. Rajendran, who declined because of his duty to "Sivagangai Seemai". He later asked the pregnant Savitri to ask her significant other, Gemini Ganesan, to assume the job. Gemini was at first hesitant to acknowledge the part, feeling it was "ill-advised" to supplant Rajendran. After Rajendran wrote to Panthulu that he had no protest to Gemini playing Vellaiyathevan, nonetheless, the performer concurred. Padmini was given a role as Vellaiyammal, O. A. K. Thevar as Oomaithurai, and V. K. Ramasamy as Ettappan. S. Varalakshmi played Kattabomman's better half, Jakkamma, and was a playback artist. 

Ruler W. C. Jackson was played by C. R. Parthiban, and M. R. Santhanam played the priest, Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai. Kattabomman's girl in the film, Meena (Baby Kanchana), was an anecdotal character made by Krishnasamy. Meena depended on Krishnasamy's little girl, Mynavathi, who passed on when she was five years of age. Krishnasamy at first would exclude the scene of Meena's demise (since it helped him to remember his girl) yet at last did, reluctantly. 

"Veerapandiya Kattabomman" was propelled at Annai Illam, Sivaji Ganesan's home. Primary photography started in October 1957 with a puja. Amid taping at Bharani Studios, Chennai in 1958, Adoor Gopalakrishnan (who watched the shoot one evening) recalled the on-screen characters hurrying outside after each take on account of the extraordinary warmth on set: "The speed of the film was so low those days that one required many, numerous lights for right presentation." Filming additionally occurred unmistakably in Jaipur. With the guide of Janakaraja (who was accountable for the mounted force division), the generation unit employed junior artistes to play rangers officers in the fight scenes. This was the place the last taping timetable occurred, and chief photography finished around the same time, around late November to early December. 

"Veerapandiya Kattabomman" was the principal Tamil film discharged in Technicolor; it was shot in Gevacolor and afterward changed over into Technicolor in London. Panthulu received American executive Cecil B. DeMille's routine with regards to presenting the film on-camera. The film's last length was . 

The soundtrack collection was created by G. Ramanathan, with verses by Ku. Mama. Balasubramaniam, and was discharged on the Saregama mark. It was a profession achievement for battling playback artist P. B. Srinivas, who was selected by Ramanathan to sing the two part harmony "Inbam Pongum Vennila", with P. Susheela. "Pogaathe" depends on the "Mukhari" raga, "Manam Kanintharul" on the "Kurinji" raga, and "Singara Kanne" on the "Brindavanasaranga" raga. Stage on-screen character K. B. Chellamuthu was the tunes' musician. A remix of "Inbam Pongum Vennila" was recorded by Hiphop Tamizha for the 2015 film, "Aambala". 

As per S. R. Ashok Kumar of "The Hindu", "Manam Kanintharul" and "Singara Kanne" (both sung by Varalakshmi) "stayed unsurpassed top picks". Artist Charulatha Mani called "Pogaathe" "a winding, melancholic Mukhari" and Ratnamala's version "expressive". Film commentator Baradwaj Rangan of "The Hindu", in his audit of the film's 2015 computerized re-discharge, composed that Ramanathan's music "is as yet wonderful, crossing the range from folksy to light to established". 

"Veerapandiya Kattabomman" debuted in London on 10 May 1959, and was discharged in Tamil Nadu six days after the fact. Appropriated by Padmini Pictures, the film was a business achievement, running for more than 25 weeks in theaters (turning into a silver celebration film), and accomplished faction status in Tamil film. It was named and discharged in Telugu as "Veerapandiya Kattabrahmanna" in 1959, and in Hindi as "Amar Shaheed" after a year. 

The film got positive surveys when it was discharged. "Ananda Vikatan", in its 24 May 1959 survey, applauded Sivaji Ganesan's execution and said that the film would make a Tamil pleased. Baradwaj Rangan likewise applauded Ganesan's execution: "To watch "Veerapandiya Kattabomman" is to wonder about the shades and subtleties an on-screen character can implant into speech." Arun Ram and Riju Mehta of "India Today" said in 2001, "One doesn't need to be knowledgeable in Tamil to feel the flame in "Veerapandiya Kattabomman"." 

As indicated by Sri Lankan Canadian writer D. B. S. Jeyaraj, "Veerapandiya Kattabomman" was the primary Tamil film that greatly affected him; the film's prosperity "was the incredible conveyance of searing exchange by the film saint Kattabomman played by Sivaji." N. Sathiya Moorthy composed for Rediff.com in 2001, "[Ganesan's] depiction of Lord Shiva in ["Thiruvilaiyadal"] and of opportunity contenders "Veerapandia Kattabomman" and "Kappalottia Thamizhan" V O Chidambaram have turned out to be emblematic of the very characters in the normal Tamil personality over the world." 

Fellow observed Ganesan's execution to be "stunning". C. V. Aravind of "The News Minute" portrayed it as "seriously passionate and moving", "the trademark" of the film. Janani Karthik of "The Times of India" expressed, "Watch this [film] for the amazing on-screen character's execution, something that old-clocks recollect even today." Another "Seasons of India" commentator censured the film's advanced rendition, noticing that the shading "appeared to have been filtered [from] the casings" and the sound framework was "somewhat contemporary." Despite its specialized issues, notwithstanding, "the film still holds its sensational power". 

Sivaji Ganesan's execution as Kattabomman earned him the Best Actor grant at the 29 February 11 March 1960 Afro-Asian Film Festival, and he got the honor from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Ganesan was the principal Indian on-screen character to get a worldwide honor. When he came back from Cairo, South Indian Actors Guild president (and individual performing artist) M. G. Ramachandran sorted out a vast welcome gathering for him in Chennai. Ganesan wrote in his life account that at the Afro-Asian Film Festival, "I was approached stage and I went up a little, five-foot nothing, looking innocent with my assemble, while they had anticipated that me should be a monster, on observing [Veerapandiya] Kattabomman, something like seven or eight feet tall! Independent of this they gave me an overwhelming applause for five minutes." 

"Veerapandiya Kattabomman" authentic mistakes have been reprimanded. Fellow detailed in 2015 that a Tamil week by week stated, "[...] another face called Kattabomman acted splendidly as Sivaji Ganesan!" According to artist Kannadasan, Kattabomman was not an opportunity warrior but rather a Telugu hoodlum; the Maruthu Pandiyars were the genuine opportunity contenders, and he composed a content about them which was adjusted into "Sivagangai Seemai". Kannadasan's declaration was bolstered by author Tamilvanan, who reprimanded Kattabomman's glorification. 

In "Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema" Guy noticed that as indicated by East India Company records, Kattabomman was of Telugu family and a solid, quiet man (without the film's dash and brave). As per Guy, Ganesan depicted Kattabomman as an "overwhelming character, lecturing gatherings of people in an extravagant Tamil loaded with scholarly twists"; the genuine Kattabomman was not familiar with Tamil. Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen's "Reference book of Indian Cinema" says, "An adoration intrigue has been included too" (suggesting that the character of Vellaiyammal was anecdotal). Film student of history S. Krishnaswamy, composing for "The Hindu" in 2001, noticed that the film was "generally a long way from precise" and "increasingly like an outfit show or a fanciful". 

In the 2010 book, "Films of South India: Culture, Resistance, Ideology", Elavarthi Sathya Prakash says about Kattabomman's Telugu character: "While National historiography attempts to lift him, a few renditions of Tamil history appear to minimize him". S. Theodore Baskaran said the next year, "Tamil movies have inadequate respect for history. Quite often, they befuddle among history and old stories ... Kattabomman was not by any means a lord. His arms stockpile had pretty much three to four weapons." University of Madras division head Ramu Manivannan told "The Times of India" in 2014, "The mainstream pictures of [historical] characters have been developed from oral depictions and records. Now and again, the well known picture overwhelms the authentic one as on account of Sivaji Ganesan's depiction of Kattabomman on the screen." 

"Veerapandiya Kattabomman" was a milestone film in Ganesan's vocation, and Tamil individuals recognized Kattabomman with him. The film was a trailblazer in Tamil film, and a benchmark of exchange conveyance. Its prosperity supported numerous in Tamil film to make films dependent on opportunity warriors and verifiable figures, strikingly "Kappalottiya Thamizhan" (1961) and "Bharathi" (2000). The film's "jallikattu" scene accomplished fame. 

In 1970, eleven years after "Veerapandiya Kattabomman" discharge, Ganesan raised a statue of Kattabomman in Kayatharu (where the agitator was hanged). Amid a February 2009 visit to Sri Lanka, Bharatiya Janata Party pioneer L. K. Advani stated: "I have seen the Tamil film of ["Veerapandiya Kattabomman"], acted by [Sivaji] Ganesan, commonly. It is crisp in my memory." A postal spread, structured by film antiquarian and performing artist Mohan Raman, was discharged on 16 May 2009 by the SivajiÃ¢ÂÂPrabhu Charities trust and the Indo-Russian Cultural and Friendship Society to praise the 50th commemoration of the film's discharge. Lawmaker Venkaiah Naidu said in 2016 that he turned into a devotee of Sivaji Ganesan subsequent to watching his execution in the film. 

A. V. Ashok composed for "The Hindu", "It is no embellishment to state that Sivaji's chivalrous overflowing as "Veerapandiya Kattabomman" is a fundamental piece of the Tamil social mind." According to the on-screen character Sivakumar, "You can't duplicate motion pictures like "Parasakthi", "Pasamalar", "Devadas", "Veerapandiya Kattabomman" or "Ratha Kanneer" [...] By changing such movies, you are bringing down yourself, while it upgrades the first artistsÃ¢ÂÂ picture." Suhasini Maniratnam recorded "Veerapandiya Kattabomman", "Kappalottiya Thamizhan", "Aayirathil Oruvan" (1965) and "Iruvar" (1997) as her most loved period films in Tamil. "The Times of India" included "Veerapandiya Kattabomman" on its rundown of top-five Sivaji Ganesan films for the performer's birthday. An elephant exhibited by Ganesan to the Punnainallur Mariamman sanctuary in 1960 was named "Vellaiyammal" (after the character in the film), and was later given to the Brihadeeswarar Temple in 1980. 

Ganesan's line ""Vari, vatti, kisthiÃ¢Â ... Yaarai ketkirai vari ... Etharkku ketkirai vari. Vaanam polikirathu, bhumi vilaigirathu, unakken katta vendum vari ... "" (generally deciphered "Tribute, charge, advance, intrigue. The downpours pour from the sky, the land blooms, for what reason should I offer you money?"), from a scene with C. R. Parthiban, was positioned eighth on "Viewpoint magazine's" 20 October 2008 rundown of 13 Cheesiest, Chalkiest Lines in Indian Cinema. In April 2012, Rediff.com incorporated the film on its start to finish of Tamil Cinema list. In a January 2015 meeting with "The Times of India", writer Y. G. Mahendra stated: "Most character specialists today need assortment [...] Show me one performer in India right now who can complete a Kattabomman, a VOC, a "Vietnam Veedu", a "Galatta Kalyanam" and a "Thiruvilayadal"." Actor Rana Daggubati, in a meeting with Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of "The Hindu", said that Ganesan's exhibitions as Kattabomman and Karna (in the 1964 film "Karnan") affected his job in "" (2015). The scene among Ganesan and Parthiban was highlighted in the 2016 film, "Jackson Durai", which was named after Parthiban's character. M. Sasikumar's "Balle Vellaiyathevaa", likewise discharged that year, was named after a line expressed by Ganesan's character. 

The film was re-discharged in 1984 amid Ramachandran's residency as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Allowed charge exclusion by the state government, it was again financially fruitful and kept running for 30 weeks in theaters. In 2012, after the business achievement of "Karnan" advanced re-discharge, Raj Television Network reported that they would re-discharge "Veerapandiya Kattabomman" in 3D in mid 2013; in any case, that did not occur. 

In March 2015, Raj Television Network reported that they would discharge an advanced 5.1 encompass sound rendition of the film in a joint effort with Sai Ganesh Films the next month; it was discharged on 21 August of that year. Murali B. V., facilitator of Sai Ganesh Films (which reestablished and digitize the film's unique prints), told "The New Indian Express" that it took nine months to clean and reestablish the first 35 mm film (with monaural sound) for digitisation. The digitized rendition earned 553,000 in its opening end of the week from 39 appears in Chennai, and was a business achievement.
