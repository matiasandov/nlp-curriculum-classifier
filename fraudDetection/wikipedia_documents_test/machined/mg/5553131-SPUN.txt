Chicago offer for the 2016 Summer Olympics 

The Chicago offer for the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics was a fruitless offered, first perceived by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on September 14, 2007. The IOC shortlisted four of the seven candidate citiesÃ¢ÂÂMadrid, Spain; Tokyo, Japan; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Chicago, United States; over Baku, Azerbaijan; Doha, Qatar; and Prague, Czech RepublicÃ¢ÂÂon June 4, 2008, amid a gathering in Athens, Greece. This was trailed by a serious offering process which completed with the race of Rio de Janeiro at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on October 2, 2009. 

In Chicago's offered, the diversions would have been held from July 22 to August 7, with the Paralympics held between August 12 and 28. The offer arrangement stressed utilization of Chicago Park District parks to have the recreations, however other existing offices, for example, Soldier Field and McCormick Place would have facilitated occasions. The offer incorporated an arrangement for North Side, Downtown Loop and South Side festival areas that would have had top quality LED screens for unticketed guests. The offer noticed that there was an extremely high grouping of occasion areas and preparing offices near one another and that most of occasion destinations were bunched together. Consequently, by far most of competitors would have been near their rivalries. 

Chicago earned a general score of 7.0 amid the Applicant stage, after a point by point investigation of the Applicant Files gotten by the IOC Working Group on January 14, 2008. Between April 4 and 7, 2009, the IOC Evaluation Commission, driven by Nawal El Moutawakel, touched base in Chicago to survey the states of the city. The Commission went to specialized introductions, took part being referred to and-answer sessions about the Candidature File, and made assessments in all the current settings over the city. In spite of the fact that considered a most loved entering the casting a ballot procedure, and in spite of individual interests from such prominent Chicagoans as U.S. President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey, Chicago was dispensed with on the primary poll in IOC casting a ballot on October 2, 2009, with 18 cast a ballot in a three-round comprehensive tally of the IOC. 

The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) chose Chicago over Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and San Francisco as its competitor city to have the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2016 Summer Paralympics on April 14, 2007. This is the city's third disappointment, after two fizzled endeavors for the 1952 and the 1956 Summer Olympics (and fourth by and large endeavor, as Chicago won the 1904 Olympics, yet they were moved to St Louis as the World's Fair was there and taken steps to have a contending rivalry if the Olympics were not moved). Various Olympic Games in North America, including the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, hurt Chicago's offered. It would have been the ninth Olympics facilitated in the United States, after the 1904, 1932, 1984 and 1996 Summer Olympics; and the 1932, 1960, 1980 and 2002 Winter Olympics. 

At first, five American urban communities competed for the 2016 Olympics: Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. The USOC's administrator at the time, Peter Ueberroth, visited all potential host urban areas amid April and May 2006. He visited Chicago on May 10. On July 26, 2006, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) limited its rundown of American candidate urban areas to three: Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. San Francisco pulled back its application on November 13, 2006 after the San Francisco 49ers hauled out of an arrangement for the development of another arena that would be the focal point of the amusements. 

The last phase of the USOC inner determination happened on April 14, 2007, at Washington, D.C's. Embassy Row Hotel, where the two residual offer urban areas, Chicago and Los Angeles, made a most recent 40-minute introduction to the USOC board individuals. At about 21:00ÃÂ UTC, Chicago was declared as the champ of the United States offer for the 2016 Olympic Games by Ueberroth. 

Chicago has had related knowledge with Olympic offers. In 1901, the city was collectively picked by the IOC to organize the 1904 Summer Olympics, yet the Games were moved to St. Louis to concur with the 1904 World's Fair. Chicago additionally offer for the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics, without progress. City hall leader of Chicago Richard M. Daley visited Beijing Ã¢ÂÂ have city of the 2008 Summer Olympics Ã¢ÂÂ on May 15, 2006, where he gathered data on facilitating. The offering procedure for the 2016 Olympic Games was authoritatively propelled on May 16, 2007. 

In June 2007, Olympic offer advisory group Chairman and CEO, Patrick G. Ryan reported that David P. Bolger was designated head working officer and Rick Ludwig as CFO. 

The Chicago 2016 Olympic offer advisory group reported the subtleties of the Olympic offer application on January 15, 2008. 22 of the 27 Olympic scenes will be in four bunches inside 15Ã¢Â km of the Olympic Village. Five new settings and eleven impermanent scenes would have been worked for the recreations at an expense of $49.3 million; these development costs, and the expenses of the diversions were to be borne by the private part, with the administration financing the foundation. 

The offer board of trustees documented a 600-page office record with the IOC in Lausanne, Switzerland on February 12, 2009. The record reacted to 227 inquiries given to every competitor city. On February 13, the nomination record with the last form of Chicago's 2016 Olympic arrangement was openly discharged. 

Chicago's offered was upheld by real fundamental corporate responsibilities, generous endeavors by affluent Chicagoans, guaranteed arranging interest by a wide scope of network and government pioneers, and the excitement of the populace. Neighborhood support for the offer on the South Side, especially in the Washington Park and Woodlawn people group territories, was separated. Ben Joravsky, a "Chicago Reader" feature writer, was one of the most grounded commentators of the Chicago 2016 offer. Nonetheless, 2007 supposition surveys showed 76 percent open help. In 2009, as the last choice drew closer, adversaries of the offer wound up vocal despite the fact that coordinators appeared to be satisfied with the offer's advancement and introduction. Subside Ueberroth expressed, "Chicago is going the correct way, and we are awed by that." 

Long-lasting Chicago inhabitant and afterward current President of the United States Barack Obama was a supporter of Chicago's offered since its beginning and noticed his help amid his Presidential decision triumph discourse in Grant Park. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama headed out to Denmark to help Chicago's offered for the 2016 Summer Olympics. 

Michael Jordan was an informal representative for Chicago's offered. Chicago news head honcho Oprah Winfrey and Olympic hero Michael Phelps had been broadly advancing the offered since the 2008 Summer Olympics. 

The offer arrangement stressed utilization of Chicago Park District parks (Washington Park, Burnham Park, Lincoln Park, Douglas Park and Grant Park). Also, existing offices, for example, Soldier Field and McCormick Place would have facilitated occasions. Notwithstanding the occasion locales, the offer included North side, downtown Loop and South Side festival areas in Lincoln and Grant Parks just as the Midway Plaisance individually that would have had JumboTrons for unticketed guests. The offer noticed the high grouping of occasion areas; most of occasion locales would have been bunched together. 

Ueberroth and individuals from the national board of trustees met with Daley on May 10, 2006, for the underlying appraisal. Daley selected business official Patrick G. Ryan of Aon Corporation, part-proprietor of the Chicago Bears, to lead the city's offered procedure, particularly in zones of corporate investment in raising support. 

City hall leader Daley said on May 10, 2006 that the Olympics "can't turn into a monetary weight to the citizens of Chicago and Illinois." "The objective is to have the Olympics be absolutely secretly financed and we have unparalleled help from the business network," a mayoral representative said in July 2006. Daley demanded that no assessment cash would be utilized to pay for the city to have the 2016 Summer Olympic Games and said financing from the private division and government dollars for security and foundation would take care of the expenses. "Assessment cash isn't paying for it," Daley said on February 7, 2009. "The government pays for security, which is the most elevated expense of the Olympics ... The other thing they pay for is framework ... There's no city charge cash at all ... We are extremely solid in that position ... in the respect to having that be supported by the private segment and others." In earlier years, Daley restricted conceivable offers for the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games attributable to previous global panel money related certification prerequisites. The 2016 money related certification prerequisites were not at first formalized. 

Early cost assessments floated at $5 billion, with $1.1 billion for the lakeside Olympic Village and an extra evaluated $366 million for a transitory 80,000 seat Olympic Stadium to be worked in Washington Park. Regardless, the proposed spending plan was little in contrast with the Beijing Olympics, which are assessed to have cost $40 billion. Further, the 2004 Olympic diversions in Athens, at first planned to cost $2.4 billion, in certainty cost $9 billion. On April 11, 2007, previous Governor of Illinois Rod Blagojevich proposed $150 million in state financing to help secure the offer to the USOC for Chicago. Current Governor Pat Quinn expressed that he would bolster any subsidizing important to verify the Olympics for Chicago. By April 14, over $35 million in real money and $13 million in merchandise had been vowed, incorporating gifts in abundance of $100,000 from no less than 225 people and enterprises. Chicago had solid partners to seek after government assets for security and transportation: U.S. Congressperson Dick Durbin was the second in direction among Democratic Senators as the Whip, and previous Senator Barack Obama had turned into the President of the United States. The city declared a $500 million protection approach against cost overwhelms and income shortages. 

In spite of the present absence of an Olympic arena, Chicago has many existing game settings: Soldier Field, United Center, U.S. Cell Field, Wrigley Field, Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Sears Center in Hoffman Estates, and Toyota Park in Bridgeview. Settings at Loyola University Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago State University, Northern Illinois University, and the University of Illinois at UrbanaÃ¢ÂÂChampaign, among others, were likewise accessible and had been referenced in early news reports as potential outcomes. Northerly Island and the lakefront along Lake Michigan would have facilitated all shoreline and water occasions. The McCormick Place conference hall, the second biggest on the planet, was the arranged scene for indoor occasions like judo and weightlifting, just as facilitating all press workplaces, while Archery and the decorations platform were slated for Grant Park. 

Primer soccer matches would have been played in a few settings, of which a couple were slated to have been briefly renamed in accordance with the IOC forbiddance against corporate naming rights sponsorships to be utilized for scene names. These scenes included MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey (which would have been briefly renamed "New York Field" for the Olympics); the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California; Lincoln Financial Field ("Philadelphia Field") in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis, Missouri ("St. Louis Dome"); FedExField in Landover, Maryland ("Landover Field"); and TCF Bank Stadium ("Minneapolis Stadium"), another arena which opened in September 2009 on the grounds of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

Swimming occasions were initially intended to be held in the West Side's Douglas Park, however in a December 2008 arrangement modification the swimming occasions would have moved to Washington Park and a velodrome for track and BMX cycling occasions would have moved from Northerly Island to Douglas Park. The Cycling center point would have been in Madison, Wisconsin. 

While a few settings may have changed at short notice, the Chicago 2016 Bid Book demonstrated that the accompanying scenes would have been for all time built: an Aquatic Center, the Olympic Stadium (to a restricted long haul degree), a Canoe/Flatwater/Rowing territory at Monroe Harbor, a Canoe/Kayak-Slalom Course, a velodrome in Douglas Park, and Field Hockey Fields in Jackson Park. 

The Monroe Harbor would have been extended with a $60-million jetty to suit an around course for paddling occasions. This would have empowered paddling rivalries to occur on a course running from Northerly Island to about Randolph Street. This course would have highlighted a beautiful Chicago Loop horizon background for TV seeing, which by 2016 may have incorporated the Chicago Spire, on the off chance that it was finished. So as to oblige the Olympics, all non-Olympic watercraft would have been required to empty Monroe Harbor for a year. Paddling occasions would have been held in the previous area of Meigs Field on Northerly Island close to the Adler Planetarium. Verifiably, this site organized a few settings for the 1933 World's Fair. 

The Olympic Stadium would have been worked in Washington Park, a site recorded on the National Register of Historic Places in the Washington Park people group territory of a similar name on the city's south side. Chicago at first proposed structure a transitory 80,000-situate track arena neighboring Soldier Field and having the two arenas have double Opening and Closing Ceremonies. Be that as it may, the last proposition required a $366 million transitory arena to be worked in Washington Park. The arena would have been supplanted by a 10,000 seat multi-use setting after the diversions. The littler post-Olympic arena would have been more in accordance with open enthusiasm for reestablishing the memorable park after the amusements. The new arena would have highlighted an innovative intelligent sheathing material to oblige colossal TV picture projections on its outside dividers. The brief arena would not have had concessions inside the arena, in contrast to changeless nearby scenes, in spite of the fact that concessions were arranged outside the arena. The arena would have included a fundamental oval shape, however it would likewise have clung to Olympic plan decides which manage that there must be an overhanging lip toward one side to cover dignitaries and the media. IOC president Jacques Rogge commended Chicago's plan in November 2007 as a conceivable "diagram for the future", mirroring the craving of the IOC to make the amusements both progressively moderate and to have a littler environmental impression on the host city. 

The Olympic Village for lodging competitors amid the diversions would have been a $1.1-billion arrangement of recently developed lakefront structures that would have been changed over to rental and apartment suite units after the amusements. The town was to be found promptly south of McCormick Place, which was relied upon to have 11 occasion scenes, on a present truck parking area between South Lake Shore Drive and the Illinois Central Railroad tracks in the Near South Side and Douglas people group regions. At the time, the parking area was being utilized to arrange occasions at McCormick Place. The town was slated to have pedways over Lake Shore Drive. This area was intended to empower 88% of the Olympic competitors to be inside 15 minutes of their opposition scene. 

At first, the Olympic Village was to be found completely on the McCormick Place truck yards, however in November 2006, The Michael Reese Hospital site progressed toward becoming recorded available to be purchased. Organizers established that the Hospital site would probably have been predominant as far as lower cost and increasingly effective urban arranging execution. In November 2007, Mayor Daley declared an arrangement to get the site, and the next June the emergency clinic concluded that it would stop activities. In July 2008 the city declared its official offer for the property: The city wanted to acquire $85 million to purchase the Michael Reese Hospital grounds, close 31st and King Drive, from its present proprietor, Medline Industries. Medline would just get $65 million, on the grounds that the organization consented to make a $20 million "beneficent commitment" back to the city. The city would utilize that $20 million to pay as long as five years of enthusiasm on its $85 million obligation, wreck the medical clinic, and tidy up the site. At that point at some point in the following couple years it intended to sell the site for in any event $85 million to an engineer or designers, who thus were required to fabricate a complex sufficiently enormous to house around 15,000 Olympians. After the diversions the designer would sell or lease the units. 

In September 2008, the city acknowledged it had thought little of devastation and natural cleanup costs, which put the exchange in danger. Also in September the Associated Press revealed a refractory property proprietor may drive the clinic site to be surrendered. These issues required goals by the offer advisory group by February 2009, the date which offer books were expected. That month, the city mentioned a renegotiation of terms and inside seven days Michael Reese medical clinic petitioned for section 11 insolvency. In December 2008, new terms for the arrangement wound up open. Albeit unique financing plans incorporated no citizen subsidizing, the late arrangement was just conceivable with $500 million of citizen investment by means of an assurance by the city to cover conceivable income setback and $45 million for Chicago Police Department costs. Also, in mid 2008, records were revealed that demonstrate the grounds of Michael Reese Hospital to have been structured, in expansive part, by one of the twentieth century's most well-regarded innovator planners, Walter Gropius. Therefore, the arrangement for the Olympic Village struggled the developing conviction that safeguarding the old clinic grounds would be better from a urban arranging and notable conservation stance, and furthermore climbed inquiries regarding financing the town. Moreover, the arranged annihilation of 28 structures put the supportability record the city was endeavoring to make being referred to. 

Chicago profited by a solid games culture. On August 1, 2006, it was named Best Sports City in the US by "Brandishing News". Chicagoans are acclaimed for their out of control backing of their home groups: the Chicago Bears, Chicago Bulls, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Chicago Blackhawks, Chicago Wolves, and all the more as of late, Chicago Sky (WNBA), Chicago Fire, the Chicago Red Stars (the new ladies' soccer crew), and the Chicago Machine. Different occasions, for example, the Chicago Marathon, one of the five World Marathon Majors, would likewise have an impact in Chicago's Olympic-arranging process. 

Chicago has facilitated major and noteworthy world social events previously, including the popular 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition and the 1959 Pan American Games, just as matches for the 1994 FIFA World Cup soccer competition. Chicago has additionally facilitated the most United States presidential designating shows. Chicago was planned to have the 1904 Summer Olympics, however the diversions were rather migrated to St. Louis to correspond with its Louisiana Purchase Exposition, all the more ordinarily known as the Saint Louis World's Fair. Chicago was likewise the principal host of the Special Olympics in 1968. 

All the more as of late, Chicago facilitated the Gay Games VII in July 2006, and the 2007 AIBA Boxing Championships in October 2007. The titles were a passing occasion for the 2008 Summer Olympics and a possibility for Chicago to grandstand its organizing abilities to IOC individuals. AIBA head Dr. Ching-kuo Wu enthused the competition was the "best ever", particularly considering the short half year lead time Chicago needed to sort out the diversions. 

On May 16, 2007, Chicago was educated that its logo, a portrayal of a light with the flares reminiscent of Chicago's horizon, damaged IOC rules against utilizing Olympic light symbolism. Offering rules restrict logos containing the Olympic image, witticism, banner or other symbolism including a fire, light or decoration. Chicago consented to modify the logo. The current overhauled logo was discharged on September 19, 2007. Utilizing a similar shading palette, a one of a kind six-pointed Chicago star speaks to a compass pointing every which way connecting with the world. Each point speaks to an Olympic esteem: Hope, Respect, Harmony, Friendship, Excellence and Celebration. The warm hues at first spoke to in the fire (or top) of the picture allude to the sun, the cool hues speak to the green parklands and blue waters of Lake Michigan. At first underneath the logo were the words "Candidate City". The two logos were planned by Chicago-based structure firm VSA Partners. 

Chicago changed its logo, yet relaunched its battle. It changed its adage from "Blend the spirit" to "Let fellowship sparkle". Chicago utilized internet based life more than some other city offering, and was quick to make 2016 'Another Media Olympics'. It set up various gatherings on Facebook, and on September 29, 2009 the offer's legitimate page outperformed 100,000 individuals; it additionally utilized Flickr and Twitter. 

Chicago City Council councilman Edward M. Burke suggested that a fifth star be added to the Flag of Chicago if the city won its offer for the Olympic amusements in 2016. 

The offer depended on Chicago's quality in therapeutic administrations and doping control, security, lodging, transportation, innovation and media activities. The city's transportation foundation incorporates the Chicago Transit Authority, which works a huge system of transports and raised/tram 'L' trains, and the Metra and South Shore Line worker rail benefits that interfaces in excess of 230 rural goals to Chicago. These transportation choices would have permitted open travel access to the Games for city occupants and individuals all through northeastern Illinois into northern Indiana and southern Wisconsin. 

Chicago's fundamental airplane terminal, O'Hare International Airport is the second-busiest air terminal on the planet. The Chicago area is served by two other real business air terminals, Midway and Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport, alongside a few littler air terminals. The city is served by all major overall aircrafts, and O'Hare is a global center point for both American and United Airlines, while Midway is a center for local transporter Southwest Airlines. There is likewise an impressive system of rail lines and interstate thruways in the area. Chicago has more than 30,000 lodgings in the quick downtown region alone, and it has the biggest gifted work workforce in the US taking into account shows and other expansive scale media occasions. 

Chicago is in the Central Time Zone (UTC Ã¢ÂÂ5 amid the late spring months), which is very is appropriate to North American TV inclusion. The NBC telecom company with its sister link supporters is by a long shot the biggest media seller and contract buyer of the Olympic Games. 

Trademark discussions emerged for "Chicago2016.com" and "Tokyo2016.com", when both were enrolled in 2004 by business person Stephen Frayne Jr., a MBA understudy at the Kellogg School of Management; he additionally guaranteed around 40 other space names whose city/year design copied the manner in which Olympic Games are promoted. Frayne's expressed purpose for the site was a "thorough, adjusted discourse" of the advantages and traps of holding the Olympics in Chicago; the Chicago 2016 board of trustees battled that his genuine goal was to benefit from cybersquatting. The Chicago Olympic offer association, which had been utilizing Chicago2016.org as its official site, looked for control of Chicago2016.com through a grievance recorded with a global mediation association. Endeavors by the USOC to have the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) discharge the names fizzled. Frayne sued in the U.S. Locale Court in Chicago, looking for a directive against the intervention procedures. On September 25, 2008, the WIPO assertion board conceded Frayne's movement to suspend and end procedures setting up a fight in the government court in the Northern District of Illinois. 

The Olympic offer candidature documentation distributed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) states that each offered must "...provide documentation demonstrating that proper measures have been taken to enroll area names that are of incentive to your candidature, for example, '[City] 2016' trailed by expansions .com .net .organization just as the nation code concerned." 

Chicago made the Candidate city waitlist in June 2008 as one of four finalists to have the 2016 Olympic recreations. Its specialized positioning by the IOC was 7.0; for the most part past the 6.0 least limit, however trailing behind Tokyo and Madrid's offers. (Specialized characteristics are just piece of the last choice procedure.) The last choice from Madrid, Spain; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil was made on October 2, 2009, in Copenhagen, Denmark. 

In 2007, USOC head Peter Ueberroth fought that Chicago was in "third or fourth spot", with a need to concentrate more on the worldwide relations instead of simply having a more grounded specialized offered. In September 2009, the IOC gave a composed assessment of the settings, spending plans, transportation plans and open help. Chicago's offered was not governmentally endorsed, in contrast to other offer urban areas, which concerned the IOC, given declining charge income amid a noteworthy retreat in the US economy. By the by, with Chicago's solid facilitating of the AIBA Boxing Championships which presented the city to numerous IOC individuals, the city was refered to as a present top choice, and one part guaranteed the Games were "theirs to lose." Chicago likewise effectively facilitated the 2006 Gay Games, another worldwide game. The two occasions were arranged with short lead times. 

In April 2009, the Chicago 2016 offer board of trustees was the first of the four finalists to have the 13-part IOC Evaluation Commission. They exhibited twenty movies to the board of trustees. Among the video spokespersons were Hillary Clinton (brought up in rural Chicago) and Michael Jordan. Notwithstanding meeting with offer coordinators, the IOC commission met with offer resistance bunches when they visited. After the IOC commission left Chicago, the Chicago City Council affirmed an Olympic Community Agreement mandate that was drafted by Alderman Toni Preckwinkle. The understanding submitted 30 percent of Olympic Village units to reasonable lodging transformation and ensures ladies and minorities a part of Olympic-related contracts. Previous Illinois Senate President Emil Jones disparaged the understanding as a deficient arrangement. Some Chicago inhabitants contradicted to the Chicago offer, especially in view of the budgetary ramifications of the endeavor to Chicago occupants, propelled a site called "chicagoansforrio.com" to influence the IOC to give the Olympics to Rio. In an open survey, Chicago inhabitants were equally partitioned on the offered, with 47% supporting and 45% not supporting. 

On October 2, 2009, Chicago was thumped out in the first round of casting a ballot, and the Olympics went to Rio de Janeiro, regardless of some prominent benefactors, for example, US President Barack Obama and Chicago-based TV master Oprah Winfrey, going to Copenhagen to help the offer. 

Since balloting is mystery and IOC individuals seldom share their casting a ballot propensities, there has been much hypothesis concerning why Chicago lost the Olympic offer so right off the bat simultaneously. Michelle Higgins on "The New York Times" blog contended that an excessively prohibitive identification and visa approach was one such reason. CBS 2 Chicago's site proposed that enemy of Americanism may have contributed. Offer CEO Patrick Ryan was cited in the "Chicago Sun-Times" as saying "coalition casting a ballot" and suppositions by others in the IOC that Chicago had enough votes to make it to the second round of casting a ballot prompted its initial death. A similar article alluded to irritable relations, noted by "The Seattle Times", between the IOC and USOC over the corporate foundation of the USOC officials and the "unnecessary" offer of income that they get. 

Following Chicago's misfortune, the USOC declined to offer for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was eventually granted to Tokyo. The USOC later entered the race for the 2024 Summer Olympics with Boston yet pulled back their offer. The USOC immediately chose Los Angeles to be the American possibility for the 2024 Olympics. After the IOC chose to grant the hosts of both the 2024 and 2028 Olympics in 2017, Los Angeles pronounced their candidature for 2028, protecting the 2024 Olympics for Paris with Los Angeles verifying the 2028 version.
