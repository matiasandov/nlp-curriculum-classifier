At first, Jim's and Dwight's business call has all the earmarks of being a disaster, however it is before long evident that the joint power of Jim's straight-and-legitimate deals approach, alongside Dwight's forceful, unpredictable strategies, is an extremely fruitful association. Ryan inquires as to whether he could lead on this call so Stanley can investigate him, which Stanley obliges. Be that as it may, Ryan solidifies up and comes up short when he understands that Stanley's customers are on the whole dark.

To make the old picture of Jim and Dwight, a real secondary school photo of Krasinski was photoshopped alongside a 1991 picture of Wilson while Wilson was on visit with an acting organization. While remaining in the parking garage, the cast needed to profess to shudder in 85-degree climate. Krasinski really slapped Wilson at Wilson's solicitation, which Krasinski considered "one of the craziest acting encounters I've at any point had."

"Voyaging Salesmen" was later rebroadcast with "The Return" as a consolidated hour-long scene on March 15, 2007, with four minutes of beforehand inconspicuous film included. Greg Daniels clarified that it was both an endeavor to pull in a bigger group of onlookers and "it's tied in with giving a bonus to our great fansÃ¢ÂÅtheir devotion must be remunerated by one way or another, and we don't have the financial plan for 10 million biscuit crates." As a major aspect of the altering procedure, Pam is seen winning a craftsmanship challenge, four scenes of Andy looking through Dwight's things were dense, and an AngelaÃ¢ÂÂPam storyline just as an all-inclusive scene of Andy going to outrage the board were included. The third season DVD contains various erased scenes, for example, Michael utilizing his PC, "Harvey", to hit on Pam (this scene was the virus open for "Voyaging Salesman" on its unique communicate; the joined hour-long form of "Voyaging Salesman" and "The Return" has no virus open).

"Voyaging Salesmen" was first communicated on January 11, 2007 in the United States on NBC. As indicated by Nielsen Media Research, an expected 10.2 million watchers tuned in, making it just a bunch of different scenes of "The Office" to reach more than 10 million watchers, the others being the show's pilot scene, "The Injury", "The Return," "Ben Franklin" and "Stress Relief," of which the last come to more than 20 million watchers. 

Amigo TV senior author Oscar Dahl commented, "It didn't make me roar with laughter and, yet, despite everything I adored it." He shed a negative light on Andy's conduct towards Dwight, calling it "irritating and not excessively clever." Dahl trusted Dwight would return soon, and finished up "By and large, a significant story scene with a pleasant cliffhanger. Regardless of whether wasn't as amusing as a week ago or even most scenes this season, "The Office" still engages." AOL TV's Michael Sciannamea praised the scene, expressing "I can't recall regularly roaring over each and every line in a solitary sitcom scene as I did watching this one. On the off chance that the exhibitions in this specific one don't collect the on-screen characters in this demonstrate a plenty of Emmys, there should be an examination." Sciannamea proceeded with that he trusted it was Steve Carell's best arrangement execution so far on the grounds that he "showed the full scope of his personalityÃ¢ÂÂjokester, self-important twitch, enchanting sales rep, delicate soul, and included another oneÃ¢ÂÂanger." 

"Stimulation Weekly" author Abby West remarked of Dwight's ouster, "It is highly unlikely Rainn Wilson is off the show, yet it was a strong move to give him a chance to have all the earmarks of being bested by the (somewhat) increasingly Machiavellian Andy. I can hardly wait to perceive how they play out this storyline." West alluded to "Phyllis' master mental move" with the makeovers as her most loved subplot of the night, and valued the focus on the business pairings; she developed this last point, "The trek out of the workplace was additionally an incredible notice of what these Dunder Mifflin-ers really do and how great the vast majority of them are. Is it safe to say that it isn't intriguing that as much as they ordinarily conflict, Dwight and Jim make an exceptionally successful deals group, while the appearing bond that Michael and Andy share did nothing to shield Andy from punting their pitch? At the point when Dwight began utilizing the customer's telephone, Jim didn't skirt a beat. They'd either utilized the ploy (of dialing the challenge's client administration number and appearing long the hold up time was) previously, or Jim is happy with running with Dwight's stream, in any event in that sort of setting. They basically played great cop/awful cop... or then again great cop/peculiar cop." Other TV pundits additionally applauded the different deals call pairings.
