The town had a populace of 39,277 in the 2011 registration, making it the third biggest settlement in Fife and the eighteenth most crowded settlement in Scotland. The name Glenrothes originates from its chronicled connection with the Earl of Rothes, who possessed a significant part of the arrive on which the new town has been constructed; "Glen" (Scottish for valley) was added to the name to stay away from perplexity with Rothes in Moray and in acknowledgment that the town lies in a stream valley. The maxim of Glenrothes is "Ex land vis", signifying "From the earth quality", which goes back to the establishing of the town. 

Arranged in the late 1940s as one of Scotland's first post-second world war new towns, its unique object was to house excavators who were to work at a recently settled coal mineshaft, the Rothes Colliery. After the mine shut, the town created as an imperative mechanical focus in Scotland's Silicon Glen somewhere in the range of 1961 and 2000, with a few noteworthy hardware and hello tech organizations setting up offices in the town. The Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC), a semi independent non-legislative association, was built up to create, oversee and advance the new town. The GDC, bolstered by the neighborhood expert, regulated the administration of Glenrothes until the GDC was ended up in 1995, after which all obligation was exchanged to Fife Council. 

Glenrothes is a noteworthy administration focus and is the regulatory capital of Fife, containing the home office of both Fife Council and Police Scotland Fife Division. It is a middle for brilliance inside the innovative gadgets and assembling parts; a few associations have their worldwide central command in Glenrothes. Open administrations and administration enterprises are likewise imperative to the town's economy.

The A92 trunk street gives the primary access to the town, going through Glenrothes and associating it to the more extensive Scottish motorway and trunk street organize. A noteworthy transport station is situated in the town focus, giving local and nearby transport administrations to encompassing settlements. 

The name Rothes originates from the relationship with the Earl of Rothes, of the Leslie family from NE Scotland. This family generally claimed a great part of the arrive on which Glenrothes has been fabricated, and gave its name to the neighboring town of Leslie. "Glen" (from the Scottish Gaelic word "gleann" which means valley) was added to counteract perplexity with Rothes in Moray, and to mirror the area of the town inside the River Leven valley. 

The distinctive zones (regions) of Glenrothes have been named after the villages officially settled (for example Cadham, Woodside), the homesteads which once involved the land (for example Caskieberran, Collydean, Rimbleton) or recorded nation houses in the region (for example Balbirnie, Balgeddie, Leslie Parks). 

Glenrothes was assigned in 1948 under the New Towns Act 1946 as Scotland's second post-war new town. The arranging, advancement, the executives and advancement of the new town was the obligation of the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC), a quango named by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The company board comprised of eight individuals including an executive and agent director. The primary gathering of the GDC was in Auchmuty House, given by Tullis Russell on 20 June 1949. 

The first arrangement was to manufacture another settlement for a populace of 32,000 to 35,000. The land which Glenrothes now possesses was generally horticultural, and once contained various little provincial networks and the villages of Cadham and Woodside, which were set up to house specialists at neighborhood paper plants. The first recommendations for the new town would have focused it on Markinch; anyway the town's foundation was esteemed unfit to withstand the significant development required for another town and there was extensive neighborhood resistance to the proposition. Leslie and Thornton were additionally considered as conceivable areas, again meeting nearby resistance, and in the long run a region of between these towns was zoned for the new town's improvement. A great part of the verifiable Aytoun, Balfour, Balgonie and Rothes homes were incorporated into Glenrothes' alloted region alongside the authentic nation houses Balbirnie House, Balgeddie House and Leslie House. 

Dissimilar to the next post-war Scottish new towns of Cumbernauld, East Kilbride, Irvine and Livingston, Glenrothes was not initially to be a Glasgow overspill new town, despite the fact that it did later play this job. It was anyway populated in the mid 1950s, partially by families moving from the declining coalfield zones of Scotland. 

Before Glenrothes was built up, the fundamental businesses in the region were papermaking, coal mining and cultivating. Nearby paper producers incorporated the Tullis Russell and Dixons Mills close Markinch in the east and the Fettykil and Prinlaws Mills toward the west at Leslie. The area of the factories was vital to profit by the regular vitality given by the River Leven. 

Scotland had risen up out of the Second World War in a solid position both to add to the UK's post-war remaking, and to help reimburse overwhelming abroad obligation acquired in rearmament and six years of war. At the core of government technique was the need to create vitality, and the principal focal point of the subsequent mechanical restoration was gigantic venture by the state in the Scottish coal industry. The case for creating Glenrothes was incompletely determined by this methodology, and was additionally best in class in a report delivered in 1946 by Sir Frank Mears to the Central and South-East Scotland Planning Committee. This explicitly put forth the defense for another town in the Leslie-Markinch territory to help development in the coal mining industry in Fife. 

The Rothes Colliery, the new coal mineshaft related with the town's improvement, was based ashore toward the west of Thornton, a set up town south of Glenrothes. The mine, which was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957, was advanced as a key driver in the monetary recovery of focal Fife. Be that as it may, un-stemmable flooding and geographical issues in the zone joined with a reducing interest for coal broadly made the mine less practical, and it was shut in 1965. Amusingly, excavators who had worked in more established profound pits in the region had cautioned against the improvement of the Rothes pit for this very reason. 

On 28 May 1963 Cadco Development Ltd held a public interview in Edinburgh to report that they were conveying 2,000 employments to Glenrothes. They were going to take three plants on the Queensway Industrial Estate; open pig reproducing units at Whitehill; and construct a general store in the town focus. Cadco's top managerial staff incorporated the film star George Sanders and his significant other Benita Hume nearby Denis Loraine and Tom Roe. Denis Loraine before long convinced the Glenrothes Development Corporation that the development work ought to be completed by Cadco's very own structure organization, which had opened a station in close-by Kirkcaldy. 

By May 1964 Cadco were certain that their processing plants would before long begin creation, yet by October all work had ceased in light of the fact that the Cadco Building Company had not paid its sub-temporary workers and providers. It unfolded that Cadco did not have the cash to back up its arrangements; and the banks and little organizations who had separately paid for and done the development work wound up out of pocket; and its representatives lost their positions. It worked out that the cash the advancement organization had paid to Cadco for structure work had been utilized rather to help the falling flat Royal Victoria Sausages Company in Brighton. At the point when the trick was uncovered, the town's MP Willie Hamilton suggested conversation starters in the House of Commons and a Board of Trade request was set up. As the sought after employments dissipated, the advancement company, the Royal Bank of Scotland and others included needed to disclose to the Board of Trade examiners how they been taken in by Denis Loraine and Cadco. Anyway nobody was ever arraigned as far as it matters for them in the undertaking in the United Kingdom. Students of history hypothesize this was a direct result of the inclusion, immediate and circuitous, of individuals in high places, especially future Prime Minister, Edward Heath and Hollywood performing artist Jayne Mansfield. Financial specialists asserted to be undermined by the outrage extended from author Graham Greene to Charlie Chaplin. After the outrage broke, Loraine fled to the United States, just maintaining a strategic distance from a long jail sentence by working under spread to help convey to equity those behind the greatest forging activity in US history. 

The conclusion of the Rothes Colliery nearly ended the further improvement of Glenrothes, however soon a while later, focal government changed the town's job by selecting it as a monetary point of convergence for Central Scotland as a component of a Regional Plan for financial development and advancement. The Glenrothes Development Corporation had the capacity to utilize this status to pull in a plenty of light businesses and current gadgets plants to the town.

Major modern bequests were created toward the south of Glenrothes, to a great extent since it was close to the proposed East Fife Regional Road (A92) which was created in 1989, giving double carriageway access to the primary focal Scotland street arrange. The Silicon Glen time crested during the 1990s with Canon building up their first UK producing plant at Westwood Park in Glenrothes in 1992.

Around the beginning of the 21st century, a decrease in significant gadgets fabricating in Scotland influenced the town's economy, and hence the mechanical base of the town was compelled to differentiate for the second time in its short history. In 2004 both ADC and Canon had shut their Glenrothes tasks, with very little of the guaranteed employments development emerging. This was because of the hardware mechanical area in Glenrothes and a large portion of focal Scotland being needy upon an internal speculation system that prompted practically 43% of work in outside possessed plants which were vulnerable to changes in worldwide financial markets. 

By 1995 the GDC had left an enduring inheritance on the town by regulating the improvement of more than 15,000 houses, of mechanical floorspace, of office floorspace and of shopping floorspace.
