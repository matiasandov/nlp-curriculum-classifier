Wilson's portrayer, Robert Sean Leonard, has expressed that his character and Dr. House were initially expected to assume these jobs; yet Dr. House's indicative group has taken over Dr. Watson's part. Leonard likewise read the content of the pilot scene of CBS' "Numb3rs" and was wanting to try out. He tried out for "Wilson" rather in light of the fact that he believed he would more appreciate playing the character that House went to for help and on the grounds that he preferred "The Odd Couple" dynamic of the relationship. 

The character was emphatically gotten. Alan Sepinwall of "The Star-Ledger" depicted Wilson as "the main indispensable supporting character" of the show, just as Maureen Ryan of the "Chicago Tribune", who expressed that Wilson can "never, never, never, never" leave the show. 

The character's name is gotten from two neighboring structures (James Administration Building and Wilson Hall) at McGill University's downtown grounds, in Montreal, Quebec. 

Wilson is one of three siblings. He has a college degree from McGill University, and advanced educations from Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania. His dad was Protestant and his mom was Jewish; he was brought up in his mom's confidence. 

Not long after a restorative show in New Orleans, in the wake of graduating medicinal school, Wilson coincidentally broke a classical mirror and began a bar brawl when another client over and over played "Disregard A Tender Moment" by Billy Joel to the dissatisfaction of Wilson, who was experiencing a separation with his first spouse at the time. House met him in prison and, spurred by a craving for fellowship and by sheer fatigue, safeguarded him out and contracted a lawyer to demonstrate his innocence, accordingly beginning their expert and individual relationship. In the Season 1 scene "Accounts", it is uncovered that one of his siblings is destitute and that Wilson is ignorant on the off chance that he is as yet alive as he has not seen him in nine years. Wilson has a past filled with fizzled relational unions: he is hitched to his third spouse amid Season 1 and, with the disclosure of his significant other's unfaithfulness, isolates from her amid Season 2. After the disappointment of his third marriage, Wilson lives in different impermanent lodging (counting a stretch at House's own loft) until he meets Amber Volakis, who is a female substitute for House. He is depicted as "almost 40" in "Never Change", in Season 4, and before the finish of Season 8, House portrays him amid a semi-mock DDx as a "46-year-old oncologist". Wilson and House's relationship has been painfully tried on numerous events. 

He was determined to have organize II thymoma in the Season 8 scene "Body and Soul". Toward the finish of the consequent scene (in which Wilson and House take an unexpected excursion, and Wilson accept a significantly more lighthearted identity), House played out a CT output to check the status of the disease. House's staggered outward appearance and quietness when the outcomes are shown apparently does not look good for Wilson's future guess, which would be uncovered in the last two scenes of the arrangement. It is later uncovered that Wilson, should he seek after the most broad treatment, could live for one to three years, maybe. He picks to stop the concentrated chemotherapy treatment after the eventually fruitless first round, taking advantage of the staying five months or so he would almost certainly have for whatever length of time that conceivable; at last, after many tense discussions, House acknowledges his choice. Be that as it may, because of the genuine vandalism House caused in the latrine framework and pipes, which at last crushed a room containing a MRI scanner (where a portion of his colleagues were with a patient), Foreman and the emergency clinic legal counselor advise House that the issue turned out to be remotely known to the police; along these lines, his probation officer had his parole renounced by the court. House must answer to jail again to serve the staying a half year of his roughly year-long sentence he got before, in the last season, when he ran his vehicle into Cuddy's home. In the arrangement finale, at House's memorial service, Wilson gives a genuine depiction of House instead of everybody's caring words and gets an instant message instructing him to "Shut up, you imbecile." 

To his stun, Wilson finds House perfectly healthy having faked his demise and House asks Wilson how he needs to go through his most recent five months. At some point later, an unkempt Wilson and House are found in the field on bikes, Wilson having apparently left his place of employment to go through his most recent five months as he needs. He gets some information about what they will do when the malignancy gets awful, however House basically discloses to him that "disease is exhausting" and they ride off together. 

House portrays Wilson as "a pal of mine kin state 'Thank you' to, when he discloses to them they are passing on." House likewise depicts Wilson as a "passionate vampire". Out on the town with Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), Wilson avoids an inquiry with respect to whether he needs youngsters. 

In any case, Wilson guards House when House's profession is in danger, after extremely rich person business visionary and afterward executive of Princeton-Plainsboro's Board Edward Vogler (Chi McBride) proposes a movement for House's rejection. Wilson is the just a solitary one to cast a ballot against the movement. Accordingly, Vogler proposes and prevails with regards to acquiring Wilson's expulsion, yet Wilson is before long restored gratitude to Cuddy after she persuades the board that Vogler is the genuine danger to the emergency clinic and his cash does not merit his business-fixated attitude. In a third-season scene, it is uncovered that Wilson experiences clinical discouragement and takes prescription. Wilson is additionally observed to compose with his left hand, a quality he imparts to Cuddy and Foreman, yet when he performs nitty gritty therapeutic work, for example, infusions or cuts, or gestures while talking, seems, by all accounts, to be correct submitted general, recommending he might be able to use both hands. 

Wilson endeavors to change House's medication propensities, with little achievement.

It is, truth be told, Wilson who for the most part composes House's Vicodin solutions (with Cuddy composing a couple only for influence in her dealings with House). In Season 3, when Detective Michael Tritter (David Morse) takes steps to imprison House for his Vicodin dependence in the wake of finding an immense reserve in his condo, Wilson endeavors to persuade House to go to recovery as the circumstance compounds. After Tritter weights Wilson to affirm a few times, Wilson reluctantly concurs, obscure to House. Prior to this, Wilson watches House punch Dr. Robert Chase, affront Cuddy, and inaccurately determine a kid to have a condition that would have required the removal of her left arm and leg. 

Close to the finish of Season 4, Wilson begins a sentimental association with Amber Volakis, who is basically a female form of House, and who sought one of the open employments in House's group in the wake of Foreman, Chase, and Cameron's flight. In the Season 4 finale, she passes on after a transport crash supported while getting an inebriated House from a bar. Her demise in the end drives Wilson to reason that his association with House serves to empower House's dysfunctions. To expel himself from House's impact, he leaves from Princeton-Plainsboro toward the start of Season 5. The two accommodate when Wilson powers House to go to the burial service of House's dad. Wilson understands that he had been anxious about losing House, who is his actual companion, and such Wilson's reality didn't show signs of improvement when he surrendered. He at that point comes back to Princeton-Plainsboro. 

Amid Season 5, it is uncovered that Wilson's destitute sibling Danny experienced schizophrenia since youth, which is the thing that made him flee. Wilson reprimands himself for his sibling's vagrancy, having hung up on Danny directly before he vanished. Wilson likewise uncovers to House that he took the situation at Princeton-Plainsboro on the grounds that it was close to the spot he had last observed Danny. At the point when Wilson discovers that Danny is in the Psychiatric Ward of New York Mercy Hospital [fictional], House offers to accompany him to stay with him, taking note of that it could end gravely. Be that as it may, when Wilson is let in to see his sibling, House is occupied with a differential with his group. 

In Season 6, Episode 15, "Private Lives", House finds that Wilson, in his childhood, had been an on-screen character in a porno flick titled "Non domesticated Pleasures".

The backwoods sprites have shown me how to satisfy a lady". What's more, Wilson proposes a joke marriage to House in "The Down Low". 

Gay references have been made to the connection between the two characters of the show. House has made a remark about the relationship ("I'm gay!...Oh that is not what you implied. It would clarify a ton, however: no sweetheart, dependably with Wilson, the fixation on sneakers..."). Barbara Barnett said that "House is the destitute one in the relationship, and Wilson the doormat" Verne Gay of "Newsday" depicted House's affection for Wilson as "contacting and certified". In any case, Robert Sean Leonard contrasted the connection between the two with that of Cesar Millan and his Pit Bull, while Hugh Laurie said that it's "not simply buddydom". The two characters showed up on the October 13, 2008, front of "television Guide". 

Robert Sean Leonard was not at first keen on trying out for the job of James Wilson.

Artist acquired cash from him to shoot "Lion's Den" featuring his companion Ethan Hawke, who additionally gone to secondary school with Singer.

Inside the extent of a prevalent correlation that draws parallels among House and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Wilson is proportional to Doctor Watson. In two-sections scenes, for example, Euphoria, Part 1 and Euphoria, Part 2, and House's Head and Wilson's Heart, Wilson's voice is heard portraying the story, while Dr. Watson is the character who portrays the narratives in the vast majority of Sherlock Holmes books.

Maker Katie Jacobs trusts that Wilson and House both avoid develop connections, which unites the two. She has said that the distinction between the two characters is that Wilson thinks that its difficult to state no in light of the fact that he needs to satisfy the other individual. The likenesses between Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson was likewise one reason that influenced Leonard to pick "House" over "Numb3rs". 

Leonard has said that Wilson is one of only a handful couple of characters to willfully keep up an association with House, in light of the fact that neither of them work for each other and consequently his character has "nothing to lose" by revealing to him reality. His character is one of only a handful rare sorts of people who can make House giggle.

Leonard said that he was content with the span of his job. He has likewise expressed that he would "execute himself" in the event that he had a job as large as the other cast individuals. 

Reactions to Leonard's execution were for the most part positive. In a recap of the pilot scene, Tom Shales of "The Washington Post" cited "Leonard has been playing upstanding young fellows for what appears always, yet he's as yet a standout amongst the most remarkable upstanding young fellows in the acting racket". In any case, Sherwin Nurland of "Slate" expressed that Leonard frequently appears to be detached to the point that "he'd be in an ideal situation in another show". In a recap of the period four scene "Appalling" Nina Smith of "television Guide" said that she conceives that the most persuading composing regarding the show has dependably been the scenes in which Cuddy and Wilson "fight" with House. In a 2008 public interview, Katie Jacobs, who fills in as an official maker for the show, applauded Leonard for being similarly skilled at parody and dramatization. Television Gal, of Zap2it, expressed that she "really acknowledges" what Leonard conveys to the show, being the main character who "genuinely confronts House" and "unobtrusively and quietly" giving the show "a portion of its best minutes". In an article about whom to keep if the journalists of "House" chose to minor down the cast, Maureen Ryan, of the "Chicago Tribune" said that Wilson can "never, never, never, never" leave the show. Ryan likewise recorded Wilson on her rundown of "5 Great Characters", saying that Leonard is the "misjudged linchpin of the phenomenal Ã¢ÂÂHouseÃ¢ÂÂ cast".
