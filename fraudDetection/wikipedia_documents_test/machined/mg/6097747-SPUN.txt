New York State Route 114 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 114 (NYÃÂ 114) is a state roadway on the far eastern areas of Long Island in New York in the United States. It fills in as a connector between the two "forks" of Long Island, crossing Shelter Island simultaneously. This is the main association between the North and South forks east of Riverhead. NYÃÂ 114 is the easternmost marked northÃ¢ÂÂsouth state course in all of New York. Furthermore, the course is the rearward in a progression of consecutive state courses on Long Island. The arrangement starts with NYÃÂ 101 in western Nassau County and advances eastbound to NYÃÂ 114. 

NYÃÂ 114 was relegated in the 1930 renumbering of state expressways in New York and has stayed unblemished since. The interstate has had two proposed goads by Suffolk County that were neglected to be built. NYSDOT has additionally stamped the greater part of the street as New York State Bicycle RouteÃ¢Â 114 (NY Bike RouteÃ¢Â 114) with redirections onto nearby avenues in Sag Harbor, and north and west of the northern end along NYÃÂ 25 in Greenport. 

The southern end of NYÃÂ 114 is at NYÃÂ 27 (Montauk Highway), only a square from the downtown zone of East Hampton. It rapidly gives up its status as a neighborhood street and turns into a two-path rustic expressway called East HamptonÃ¢ÂÂSag Harbor Turnpike, which prompts Sag Harbor. The lush scene between these two hotel towns is dabbed with huge houses and domains, a considerable lot of which are set far once more from the roadway. After a few miles, NYÃÂ 114 ends up in the town of Sag Harbor. This frontier whaling port is today a town of boutiques and shops along the waterfront of Sag Harbor Bay, an arm of Peconic Bay. NYÃÂ 114 makes a few turns as it explores the town's hundreds of years old road design, before traverse Sag Harbor Cove on its way north. 

In the wake of leaving Sag Harbor, NYÃÂ 114 experiences an advanced indirect at the crossing point of Short Beach Road (County RouteÃ¢Â 60 or CRÃÂ 60) and Tyndall Road. NYÃÂ 114 makes a turn through the circuitous and afterward voyages one more mile through North Haven before achieving the first of two ships along its course. Sanctuary Island's two ships, the two of which in fact convey NYÃÂ 114, are worked by two distinct organizations. The South Ferry (between North Haven and Shelter Island) is worked by the South Ferry Company and the North Ferry (between Shelter Island Heights and Greenport) is worked by the North Ferry Company. Since the two substances are independent, there is no motivator to utilize the two ships, albeit the two organizations offer limits for round outing admissions and for Shelter Island inhabitants. 

On Shelter Island itself, NYÃÂ 114 goes about as the primary avenue, by and by turning along various nearby streets. It navigates the length of the island, and finishes in memorable Shelter Island Heights at the North Ferry terminal. Once crosswise over to Greenport, NYÃÂ 114 closes rapidly at NYÃÂ 25, again only a square or so from the core of the town. Notwithstanding the short separation between the North Ferry terminal and the northern end, NYÃÂ 114 incorporates three lanes in Greenport. Northbound RouteÃ¢Â 114 keeps running on Third Street from the ship terminal to NYÃÂ 25. Southbound NYÃÂ 114 keeps running along Fifth Street then one square later takes a left onto Wiggins Street, where it travels eastward until it passes the memorable Greenport Railroad Station, and ends at Third Street and the North Ferry terminal. The bit of NYÃÂ 114 inside Greenport is kept up by the town. 

In 1840 the Bull Head Turnpike Company fabricated a private toll street referred to today as the Sag Harbor Turnpike, which worked effectively until a contending railroad line opened during the 1880s. In 1906 the town of Southampton assumed responsibility for the now decrepit street and expelled the toll doors. NYÃÂ 114 was doled out to its present arrangement as a feature of the 1930 renumbering of state interstates in New York and is referred to some extent as the Sag Harbor Turnpike. The extension conveying NYÃÂ 114 between Sag Harbor and North Haven is an angled scaffold that fills in as a town milestone. In 1999, inhabitants effectively battled state recommendations to supplant it with a brace connect. Rather, the scaffold was supplanted with another, more extensive scaffold with elaborate lights that intently looks like the first and is in a similar area. 

Suffolk County once had designs to update CRÃÂ 59 (Long Lane) into a four-path expressway bypassing East Hampton toward the north. Another previously proposed Suffolk County constructed realignment was the North Haven Spur (CRÃÂ 44), which was made arrangements for a future extension to Shelter Island.
