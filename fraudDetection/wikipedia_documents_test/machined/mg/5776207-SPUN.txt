WLF agents have expressed that the objective of the Mount Pleasant plant is to make a without pathogen condition. Since organization authorities trust that the sanitation parts of the plant are special in the meat business, they presented the plant structure for patent endorsement through the U.S. Patent Office. The Mount Pleasant plant is situated about from either the West Liberty or Sigourney plants. This lessens the probability that pathogens will be conveyed either via air or pedestrian activity from a crude generation zone to Mount Pleasant's prepared to-eat creation. 

The Mount Pleasant office comprises of roughly 20 singular handling cells that are isolated from each other and are set up with the goal that they could work as individual meat cutting offices. Before antimicrobial ground surface was poured, the cells were raised with hardened steel antimicrobial dividers that are incorporated with the floor.

Amid task, completely cooked meat or cheddar logs arrive fixed in impermeable housings. The logs experience a packaging sanitation step that includes being treated with a purifying fluid before the housings are expelled from the logs. The logs at that point experience a postlethality treatment by going through an infrared purification passage to murder pathogens on the logs. The logs are then precisely exchanged to slicers, cut, and put in fixed bundles that are exchanged out of the handling cell. The mechanical exchanges decline the danger of item sullying by decreasing treatment of item by faculty . 

Sanitation is a factor in contracting workers at the Mount Pleasant office. Before applying, potential representatives must total a 16-hour sanitation instructional class through Iowa State University. The class incorporates composed tests which every candidate must go before finishing the course. At work, representatives must wear a fixed clean room suit before entering cutting cells. The suits are cleaned and fixed in a perfect room clothing office in North Carolina by the uniform organization Cintas. Workers supplant the spotless suit each time they leave the cell so every representative midpoints five suits for every day.

The plant will at first have ten cutting cells permitting generation of 150 million pounds for every year and will in the long run add ten additional cells to twofold the plant's ability. At full limit, the plant will utilize in excess of 500 individuals. Like the Mount Pleasant plant, a Millard Refrigerated Services office will be fabricated neighboring the Tremonton plant for distribution center stockpiling of refrigerated and solidified items.

Wonderful View offered another US$1.4-US$1.8 million in motivating forces. Be that as it may, development in Pleasant View ended up unthinkable when it was found that a great part of the site comprised of wetland territories. After this advancement, the state held the motivator offer open gave that West Liberty Foods could locate another reasonable site that met Utah's necessities.
