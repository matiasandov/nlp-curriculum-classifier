New York State Route 16 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 16 (NYÃÂ 16) is a state thruway in western New York, in the United States. It keeps running from the Pennsylvania state line, where it is one of the most astounding thruways in the state in rise, to downtown Buffalo. NYÃÂ 16 is a noteworthy course through Erie County, in spite of the development of the paralleling NYÃÂ 400 road from East Aurora. In Cattaraugus County it likewise assumes an imperative job, filling in as the real association from Olean toward the Southern Tier Expressway (InterstateÃ¢Â 86 or I-86 and NYÃÂ 17). Between those two territories, and undoubtedly for a lot of its length, it is a two-path provincial street. 

NYÃÂ 16 at first finished in Olean when it was appointed in 1924. It was stretched out south to the Pennsylvania state line in the mid 1930s; be that as it may, it at first covered NYÃÂ 17 east to Portville, where it associated with Pennsylvania by method for current NYÃÂ 305. NYÃÂ 16's present arrangement south of Olean was initially assigned as New York State RouteÃÂ 16A around this time. NYÃÂ 16 was rerouted to pursue the steering of NYÃÂ 16A south of Olean in AugustÃ¢Â 1962. 

At the point when PAÃÂ 646 progresses toward becoming NYÃÂ 16 at the state line, it is as of now at a high rise on a ridgecrest, and at an ascent two miles (3.2Ã¢Â km) into New York, it comes to in rise, making it the most elevated state roadway in western New York and among the most noteworthy in the state. It stays at a high rise for a few additional miles, through what was once one of New York's significant oil fields. A while later, NYÃÂ 16 then starts to drop through a tight valley to cross the Allegheny River and enter its first real network, the city of Olean (which, similar to a few different networks in the district, takes its name from oil). It crosses the city as Union Street, converging its first state interstate, NYÃÂ 417, at State Street. Here, proprietorship and upkeep of NYÃÂ 16 movements to the city for six squares before getting to be state-kept up yet again at the point where North Union Street travels northwest to serve North Olean. 

A mile (1.6Ã¢Â km) north of NYÃÂ 417, NYÃÂ 16 achieves an extension over Olean Creek, a tributary of the Allegheny. On the opposite side, it turns into a four-path street with a divider as it approaches NYÃÂ 17, as of now simultaneous with I-86 pending the whole turnpike's move up to Interstate Highway gauges. A trumpet exchange gives access to I-86 and NYÃÂ 17 in the two headings in the region of Baldwin Heights. Be that as it may, NYÃÂ 16 runs parallel to the turnpike and remains a four-path course, albeit never again separated, after the Olean valley. At Hinsdale it at long last crosses I-86/NYÃÂ 17. In the blink of an eye a while later, in the villa of Maplehurst, NYÃÂ 446, the previous course of NYÃÂ 408, roll in from the east and ends. 

NYÃÂ 16 now pursues the tight valley of Ischua Creek, one of the Olean's tributaries, north past the way to the city's airplane terminal, north to Franklinville. NYÃÂ 98 joins NYÃÂ 16 only south of the town and leaves north of it. NYÃÂ 16 proceeds to Machias and the eastern end of NYÃÂ 242. A straight course takes the expressway from this intersection to the Cattaraugus Creek connect. This scaffold heads into Erie County. 

In the southwestern corner of the province, NYÃÂ 16 converges with NYÃÂ 39. NYÃÂ 16 then starts heading somewhat northwestward through a more extensive, increasingly created valley in the towns of Holland and Wales to the primary indication of a moving toward significant metropolitan territory, the south end of NYÃÂ 400, the Aurora Expressway. Subsequent to joining the freeway for two miles (3Ã¢Â km), it again leaves to turn into a two-path that enters East Aurora as Olean Street. At the crossing point with Main Street, NYÃÂ 16 turns left and quickly unites with U.S. RouteÃÂ 20A (USÃÂ 20A) and NYÃÂ 78. USÃÂ 20A leaves the two state courses behind at a fork at the town's east end, leaving NYÃÂ 16 and NYÃÂ 78 to go to the northwest again as Buffalo Street. Now, NYÃÂ 16 and NYÃÂ 78 become region kept up for the following as the unsigned County RouteÃ¢Â 572 (CRÃÂ 572). At Willardshire Road as the interstate passes the modern parks and different offices related with neighborhood organization Moog Inc. North of the town, it enters the Town of Elma and progresses toward becoming Seneca Street, the name it will hold right to the city. 

NYÃÂ 78 takes on its best-referred to name too when it leaves at Transit Road (USÃÂ 20), as NYÃÂ 16 accept an eastÃ¢ÂÂwest heading over the rural neighborhoods of West Seneca. It crosses NYÃÂ 277, a noteworthy retail strip, at Union Road in the village of Ebenezer. One last trumpet exit to NYÃÂ 400 (and by expansion, the New York State Thruway) goes before its intersection with Harlem Road (NYÃÂ 240), where area upkeep of NYÃÂ 16, and in this manner the cover with CRÃÂ 572, closes. Only west of NYÃÂ 240, NYÃÂ 16 crosses the Thruway itself as it heads toward the northwest and enter the city of Buffalo, where the course is privately kept up. Running practically due northwest through the private neighborhoods of South Buffalo, NYÃÂ 16 achieves its last real intersection, with USÃÂ 62, at Bailey Avenue soon after intersection the Buffalo River. Quickly subsequently it crosses I-190 with no exit (yet with northbound access) and comes back to a more eastÃ¢ÂÂwest course through mechanical territories before closure at Main Street, NYÃÂ 5, in the downtown area. 

The segment of present day NYÃÂ 16 among Hinsdale and Buffalo was initially assigned as RouteÃ¢Â 17, an unsigned administrative course, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. In the meantime, the portion of what is presently NYÃÂ 16 from Olean to Hinsdale was incorporated into RouteÃ¢Â 4, a long eastÃ¢ÂÂwest course that stretched out from Lake Erie in Chautauqua County to the Hudson River in Orange County. The segment from Olean south to the state line was a piece of the old "Kittanning Road," a street developed by the Continental Army amid the 1779 Sullivan Expedition that associated Kittanning, Pennsylvania to the Allegheny River; the street is among the most seasoned streets in the district. 

At the point when the primary arrangement of posted courses in New York were doled out in 1924, a lot of RouteÃ¢Â 4Ã¢ÂÂincluding the OleanÃ¢ÂÂHinsdale segmentÃ¢ÂÂwas assigned as NYÃÂ 17 while authoritative RouteÃ¢Â 17 turned out to be a piece of NYÃÂ 16, which started in Olean and covered with NYÃÂ 17 along previous administrative RouteÃ¢Â 4 among Olean and Hinsdale. 

In the 1930 renumbering of state roadways in New York, NYÃÂ 17 was realigned among Olean and Wellsville to pursue present day NYÃÂ 417, disposing of its cover with NYÃÂ 16. By the next year, NYÃÂ 16 was stretched out south to the Pennsylvania state line close Portville through NYÃÂ 17 and what is currently NYÃÂ 305. The cutting edge directing of NYÃÂ 16 among Pennsylvania and Olean was assigned as NYÃÂ 16A . The arrangements of both NYÃÂ 16 and NYÃÂ 16A continued as before until AugustÃ¢Â 1962 when NYÃÂ 16A was displaced by a rerouted NYÃÂ 16. The previous steering of NYÃÂ 16 between the Pennsylvania state line and NYÃÂ 17 turned into an expansion of NYÃÂ 305. 

The segment of the Aurora Expressway (NYÃÂ 400) between East Aurora and South Wales was finished in the mid 1970s. NYÃÂ 16 was rerouted to pursue the new interstate for two miles (3Ã¢Â km) before leaving the expressway and coming back to its past arrangement. The previous directing of NYÃÂ 16 in the territory, a long segment of Olean Road, is presently NYÃÂ 951V, an unsigned reference course.
