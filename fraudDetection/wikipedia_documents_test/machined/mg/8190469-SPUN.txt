He helped to establish and filled in as the media representative for National Association for Change (NAC) headed by Mohamed ElBaradei in mid 2010. The NAC's expressed reason for existing is push for vote based and different changes in Egypt. In May Egyptian remote priest Ahmed Aboul Gheit brought a claim for defamation against Qandil in light of a basic section about Aboul Gheit and Egyptian outside approach that Qandil composed for "Al-Shorouk", called "The HomelandÃ¢ÂÂs Disgrace and that of the Citizen."

In April Aboul Gheit dropped the claim. As indicated by Hafez Abu Seada of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, the transformation was the unmistakable reason Aboul Gheit pulled back the suit, and had it not happened, "the court could have given [Qandil] a jail sentence." 

Qandil portrayed himself as a supporter of Nasserism, which he characterized not as a political connection, yet rather a perfect of "social equity" and "national freedom" that "goes past age and class". He didn't join any of Egypt's Nasserist ideological groups or associations, yet saw the time recently president Nasser as a period in which his "age was shown sense of pride, national pride and the fearlessness to face the extraordinary forces". Qandil was portrayed by Hammond as a "mainstream patriot ... epitomizing the 'still, small voice of the Arab country'".

Qandil was vociferously contradicted to United States remote arrangement in the Middle East.
