Twelve trains multi day served Caldwell, Verona and Overbrook Hospital. The station at Great Notch was considered Caldwell Junction, deducing the intersection between the two railroads. The Great Notch station stop was worked in 1905 for the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway, an auxiliary of the Erie Railroad. The station was worked as a green-red "type five" outline structure. While the principle building was 12' ÄÂ 28' ÄÂ 18' in size, the station additionally incorporated an old train unit utilized as an apparatus house.
