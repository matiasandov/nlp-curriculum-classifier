Ach wie flÄÅºchtig, ach wie nichtig, BWV 26 

The cantata depends on the song "", versed and formed by Michael Franck in 1652. The tune was later altered by Johann CrÄÅºger. It is the main time Bach utilized this psalm, aside from BWV 644 (OrgelbÄÅºchlein). Its subject, the temporariness of human life, is the main association with the endorsed gospel perusing. The first and last stanza are utilized unaltered in both content and tune: the previous is treated as a chorale capriccio, the last as a four-section shutting chorale. An obscure librettist summarized the inward stanzas as arias and recitatives. Bach scored the cantata for four vocal soloists, a four-section choir, and a Baroque instrumental gathering of horn, woodwind, three oboes, strings and continuo. 

Bach composed the cantata in 1724 in his second year in Leipzig for the 24th Sunday after Trinity. That year, Bach created a chorale cantata cycle, started on the main Sunday after Trinity. The endorsed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Colossians, a supplication for the Colossians (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the narrative of the Raising of Jairus' little girl (). The cantata depends on "Ach wie flÄÅºchtig, ach wie nichtig", a song in 13 stanzas by Michael Franck (1652), to a tune by Johann CrÄÅºger (1661), "a contemplation on the brevity of human life and of every natural great". This angle is the main association with the gospel. An obscure artist held the first and the last stanza unaltered the external developments 1 and 6 of the cantata. He inferred the four inward developments as an arrangement of substituting arias and recitatives from the internal stanzas. John Eliot Gardiner calls attention to that "few of Bach's late Trinity season cantatas" focus on "the curtness of human life and the vanity of natural expectations". 

Bach initially played out the cantata on 19 November 1724. It is the main time that he utilized this psalm. 

Bach organized the cantata in six developments. The content and tune of the psalm seem unaltered in the external choral developments, a chorale capriccio and a four-section shutting chorale, which outline an arrangement of rotating arias and recitatives. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-section choir and a Baroque instrumental outfit of a horn (Co) multiplying the soprano in the chorale, flauto traverso (Ft), three oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), organ (Org) and basso continuo. 

In the accompanying table of the developments, the scoring pursues the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time marks are taken from Alfred DÄÅºrr, utilizing the image for normal time (4/4). 

The opening melody, "" (Ah, how temporary, ah how unimportant), is a chorale capriccio. The instruments play concertante music, to which the soprano sings the cantus firmus line by line. The speak with a softer tone go about as an "independent gathering", for the most part in homophony, and "declaim the individual lines of content as one toward the finish of every choral section, utilizing a melodic recipe got from the earliest starting point of the psalm." Bach represents the symbolism of the content, "transition and pitifulness" in themes, for example, "unexpected harmonies isolated by stops andÃ¢Â ... hustling scale figures". Gardiner remarks: The musicologist Julian Mincham thinks about the instrumental music to "fog and haze, pictures which infer developments of wind and air" and hears the turn down the volume as "showing a sentiment of antiquated power and solidarity". 

In the primary aria, the content "" (As fast as hurrying water) is shown in the flute, the violin and the tenor voice by "quick streaming" music, "every performer required to continue changing capacities Ã¢ÂÂ to react, mimic, reverberation or twofold each other Ã¢ÂÂ while differently adding to the stubborn onwardness of the tumbling downpour". 

In a recitative for alto, "" (Joy progresses toward becoming pity), pictures, for example, blooms discuss short life until the grave. The Bach researcher Klaus Hofmann portrays it as a "sweeping coloratura [which] comes full circle in an uneasy discord". 

In the last aria, an "unordinary oboe trio" goes with the bass boice in "" (To balance one's heart on natural fortunes). Gardiner remarks: "He scores this Totentanz (Dance of the dead) for three oboes and continuo supporting his bass soloist in a counterfeit bourrÄÅ¡e", the oboes undermining in "throbbing accompanimentÃ¢Â ... those natural joys by which men are lured", at that point speaking to "through spiked figuresÃ¢Â ... the tongues of fire which will before long decrease them to fiery remains, lastly in rushing semiquaver sizes of 6/4 chordsÃ¢Â ... flooding waves which will destroy every common thing". Mincham sees an association of the rushes to those of development 1, however brings up how extraordinary their capacity is here: 

A recitative for soprano, "" (The most noteworthy greatness and eminence), communicates that even most elevated power won't escape passing. 

The end chorale, "" (Ah, how temporary, ah how inconsequential), is a four-section setting.
