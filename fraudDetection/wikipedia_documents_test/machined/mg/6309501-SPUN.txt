second Battalion (Australia) 

The second Battalion was an infantry regiment of the Australian Army. It was at first raised for administration amid the First World War as part the Australian Imperial Force and saw activity at Gallipoli before being sent toward the Western Front in mid-1916, where it spent the following more than two years partaking in the battling in the channels of France and Belgium. Following the finish of threats, the contingent was disbanded in mid 1919 as a component of the grounding procedure. 

In 1921, the regiment was re-raised as low maintenance unit of the Citizens Forces situated in Newcastle, New South Wales, drawing heredity from various already existing infantry units. They stayed in presence until 1929 when, because of starkness measures amid the Great Depression and labor deficiencies, the force was amalgamated with two other infantry contingents through the span of various re-associations. It was re-framed in 1939 and attempted battalion obligation in Australia amid the Second World War until 1943 when it was consolidated by and by. 

Following the finish of the war, the second Battalion was re-raised as a major aspect of the Citizens Military Force in 1948. In 1960, it was diminished to an organization level arrangement however was re-shaped as a legion of the Royal New South Wales Regiment in 1965. It stayed on the Australian request of fight until 1987 when it was amalgamated with the seventeenth Battalion, to shape the second/seventeenth Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, a unit which remains some portion of the Australian Army Reserve today. 

The second Battalion was raised at Randwick, New South Wales, in August 1914 as a component of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), which was framed from volunteers for abroad administration soon after the episode of the First World War. Drawing most of its staff from the Maitland, Newcastle and Hunter Valley locales of the province of New South Wales, the force shaped piece of the first Brigade and, alongside the first, third and fourth Battalions, it was one of the primary infantry units raised by Australia following its entrance into the war. Upon development, the legion was built up with a supplement of more than 1,000 men composed into a base camp, an automatic weapon area of two overwhelming Maxim medium assault rifles, and eight rifle organizations, each comprising of three officers and 117 different positions. The contingent's initially boss was Lieutenant Colonel George Braund, a resident warrior and Member of Parliament in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, who held the seat of Armidale. 

The physical benchmarks under which the principal unexpected of the AIF was selected were extremely severe, in any case before the finish of August more than 20,000 men had been enrolled into one infantry divisionÃ¢ÂÂthe first DivisionÃ¢ÂÂand one light steed unit, the first Light Horse Brigade. Following a concise time of preparing in Australia, the power set sail for the Middle East, collecting off Albany, Western Australia, toward the beginning of November 1914 preceding leaving Australian waters, with the second Battalion set out upon the HMAT "Suffolk". 

At first it had been arranged that the Australians would be sent to the United Kingdom, where they would attempt further preparing preceding being sent toward the Western Front in France and Belgium. Nonetheless, the Ottoman Empire's entrance into the war on Germany's side on 29 October implied that the deliberately essential Suez Canal was compromised, and thus and congestion in preparing grounds in the United Kingdom, upon the caravan achieving the Suez toward the finish of November, plans for the utilization of the Australian power were changed and they were landed in Egypt. 

The second Battalion touched base in Egypt on 2 December. The next month, it attempted further preparing alongside the remainder of the first Division. The legion was likewise re-sorted out into four organizations, as the Australian Army changed over to the new regiment structure that had been created by the British Army. In spite of the fact that the legion's approved quality continued as before, the eight organizations were converged into four, each comprising of six officers and 221 different positions. 

In February 1915, Ottoman Empire powers assaulted the Suez Canal, and albeit a few units of the first Division were put into the line, the second Battalion was not required, and at last the assault was turned back for the most part by Indian units. Afterward, with an end goal to open transportation paths to the Russians and furthermore thump the Turks out of the war, the British central leadership chose to arrive a power on the Gallipoli landmass close to the Dardanelles utilizing for the most part British, French and Indian troops alongside the Australians and New Zealanders. 

Amid the Landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, the second Battalion, under Braund's direction, came shorewards in the second and third waves, finding a sum of 31 officers and 937 different positions. After getting, the second Battalion dispatched two organizations, 'An' and 'D' to help the third Brigade who were pushing inland towards a high component known as "Infant 700", which ignored the foothold. One of the second Battalion's companies, under Lieutenant Leslie Morshead, progressed more remote than some other Australian unit, making it to the inclines of Baby 700, preceding a decided counter-assault by Ottoman powers drove them back toward the evening. 

In the interim, the regiment's other two organizations, 'B' and 'C', had been kept down for possible later use. In the early evening, Braund drove them up the lofty landscape enduring an onslaught to the essential intersection between two positions known as "Walker's Ridge" and "Russell's Top". The legion continued to hold this situation until fortifications landed from the Wellington Battalion two days after the fact, at which time the second Battalion attempted a blade charge which cleared the peak of Russell's Top. A decided adversary counter-assault constrained them back to the intersection where they stayed until 28 April when they were requested into save on the shoreline. 

Toward the beginning of May, some portion of the legion was sent to fortify the third Battalion. At around midnight the evening of 3/4 May, the second Battalion's boss, Braund, who was in part hard of hearing, was incidentally killed as he endeavored to visit first Brigade home office in the wake of neglecting to hear a test from a guard, who shot him trusting that he was an aggressor. Following his entombment, the force second-in-order, Robert Scobie, was elevated to lieutenant colonel and took over as boss. 

Following the underlying foundation of the foothold, the battle moved into a second stage as the Australians started work to solidify and gradually grow their situation around the lodgement. Amid this time, the battling at Anzac developed into to a great extent static channel fighting. In mid-May, be that as it may, the Turks chose to dispatch an assault on Anzac. This started late on 18 May with the heaviest mounted guns assault of the battle to that point, amid which the second Battalion's methodical room, situated on "MacLaurin's Hill", was hit. The strike started the next day, amid which the second Battalion, set up around a position known as the "Pimple", was assaulted by components of the Ottoman 48th Regiment who immersed their forward positions through "Owen's Gulley", which ascended as a re-contestant between the second Battalion's position and that of third Battalion which was to their left side at the "Happy". In danger of having the line part in two and suffering overwhelming assault in their sap head, the second called for fortifications which came in the state of artillerymen from the eighth Battery, who were squeezed into the line as infantrymen. With just constrained automatic rifles and with terrible light thwarting the supporting big guns, the activity of turning back the Turkish ambush tumbled to the shooters and by keeping up exacting discharge discipline, incredible impact was accomplished. By 24 May, the assault had been conclusively crushed and a concise dÃ©tente was called for the two sides to cover the dead. Following this, the Ottoman powers around Anzac embraced a cautious stance. It was amid this time, one of the second Battalion's officers, Lance Corporal (later Sergeant) William Beech, designed the periscope rifle. 

Toward the beginning of August, so as to make a preoccupation to draw Ottoman holds from a noteworthy assault at Hill 971, which had been imagined as a major aspect of an endeavor to break the stalemate that had created around the foothold, the first Brigade directed an assault at Lone Pine. The second Battalion was picked to participate in the underlying attack. In the wake of picking up ownership of the primary foe line, the Australians were exposed to a progression of decided counter-assaults which would last the following three days, which, albeit effectively repelled, demonstrated all around exorbitant for the Australians. The second Battalion endured significantly. Having begun the activity with 22 officers and 560 different positions, they lost 21 officers and 409 different positions slaughtered or injured. Among those slaughtered was its leader, Scobie, who was shot dead while endeavoring to shock a counter-assault on 7 August. In Scobie's place, the regiment second-in-order, Major Arthur Stevens, who had been a second lieutenant under a year prior, took over as transitory officer. 

Somewhere else, the fundamental hostile which had been propelled at Hill 971 and Sari Bair, and the new arrivals that had occurred at Suvla Bay, additionally floundered. At last, the August Offensive, of which the battling at Lone Pine had been a section, neglected to convey the Sari Bair statures to the British Empire powers and their partners, nor did it break the stop. Following this, stalemate came back to the promontory amid September and October, and albeit little conflicts proceeded, the Australians were principally engaged with cautious activities. Because of the mishap, a significant number of the key objectives that had been the premise of the battle were deserted and as a harsh winter set in November, there was much discussion among the British central leadership about the utility of proceeding with the crusade. In the interceding months, some work force had been moved far from Gallipoli as other the circumstance in different auditoriums turned out to be increasingly applicable, and in late November, Lord Kitchener visited the landmass. At last, on 8 December, the request to start the clearing was given. The departure, which has been portrayed as "more splendidly conductedÃ¢Â ... than some other period of the battle", occurred in stages, and with the upkeep of mystery a key thought, a progression of "tricks" were utilized to hide the withdrawal. Every unit left in drafts, keeping up a nearness along the line until the very end. At last, just before sunrise on 20 December, the clearing was finished. A little component from the second Battalion was among the last Australian troops to leave, with a gathering of 64 men staying possessing the "Dark Hand" position until 2:50Ã¢Â am on the last morning. 

Following the withdrawal from Gallipoli, the AIF came back to Egypt where they experienced a time of re-association. Some portion of this saw the convergence of substantial quantities of fortifications and the development of the AIF. The second Division had been shaped in July 1915, and part of this had been dispatched to Gallipoli in the later phases of the crusade, however the huge increment in volunteers in Australia implied that further designs for extension could happen. The third Division was brought up in Australia, while two new divisions, the fourth and fifth Divisions, were brought up in Egypt from fortifications in holding terminals and experienced framework faculty which were drawn from the infantry regiments of the first Division. In such manner, the first Brigade helped raise the fourteenth Brigade, with work force from the second Battalion being exchanged to the 54th Battalion; the split happening while the legion was at Tel el Kebir on 14 February. They were rapidly raised to full quality and preparing started in a matter of seconds a short time later. 

Prior in the month, Stevens was elevated to lieutenant colonel and put in substantive direction of the force; he would accordingly lead them through to November 1916. Around this time, the units of the first Division, of which the second Battalion was a section, turned out to be a piece of the bigger I Anzac Corps, and toward the beginning of March, this corps set out for FranceÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ the second Battalion leaving from Alexandria on the SS "Ivernia"Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ where they were to participate in the battling on the European combat zone. 

In the wake of being arrived in Marseilles, they continued north by railroad to arranging regions close Hazebrouck. In no time a short time later, on 7 April, the units of I Anzac Corps were allocated to a "calm" segment of the line close ArmentiÄÂ¨res to pick up involvement of channel fighting. Because of worries about a German assault, very quickly the Australians set to work to improve the protections around their position. It had been trusted by the central leadership to at first keep the Australian nearness a mystery so as to increase some favorable position from it, in any case, on 23 April it wound up evident that the Germans had turned out to be mindful of their entry when a flag light flashed a message in Morse code from the channel inverse the second Battalion's position expressing, "Australians return home". To this, the Australians, in spite of requests against reacting, answered unassumingly, "Why?" 

In June, amid a concise period far from the line in billets, the legion, alongside the remainder of the first Brigade, was investigated by the Australian executive, Billy Hughes close Fleurbaix. Following this, albeit a few units from I Anzac Corps participated in various attacks against the German line amid late June and early July, the second Battalion was not included and all things considered, aside from encountering some adversary shelling, the second Battalion's first huge activity came at PoziÄÂ¨res in July 1916. The force entered the line the evening of 19/20 July as the first was sent forward to ease the British 68th Brigade alongside the third Brigade; soon after 12 pm the second Battalion, after a methodology walk over which they had suffered gas assault, landed at its situation inverse the south-western side of the town. 

On 23 July, following an extreme big guns torrent, the assault started. Leaving their structure up point close to the "Chalk Pit", the second Battalion, which had been assigned the situation of the left forward regiment in the ambush with the first Battalion to their right side and the fourth Battalion tailing them up, moved out into a dead zone soon after 12 pm. A brief span a while later a flare was shot from the German lines pursued by sporadic rifle and automatic rifle shoot, which was coordinated some place far from the legion's hub of-advance. As they progressed over the kicked things off, all of a sudden a guard got out a test and the whole legion solidified, however when terminating broke out it turned out to be certain that it was coordinated away on their right side towards the third Brigade who were progressing over open ground. Progressing underneath the supporting flood, under the course of their officers whose activity it was to guarantee that they didn't advance beyond the crawling big guns, the legion examined forward endeavoring to find the foe resistances, at long last finding a relinquished channel situated among a gathering of tree stumps. Subsequent to striking the railroad, they started to delve in just past it to verify the left flank, as the third and fourth Battalions go among them and progressed to verify the unit's front along the line of the fundamental Bapaume street. Following this, the second Battalion kept up the furthest left position on the detachment line, with its pits twisting around the left flank and collapsing in behind the fourth Battalion's position. 

The Germans put in a decided counter-assault at first light with an entire unit, which was turned back after a firm battle. That night, fortifications were raised from the second Brigade, and promptly in the first part of the day on 24 July the Germans opened up with a staggering mounted guns flood. On 25 July, the men of the second Battalion, having endured awfully in the open channels, were diminished by the seventh Battalion. Amid the tasks around PoziÄÂ¨res, the unit lost 10 officers and 500 men murdered or injured. 

After this, they were sent to Pernois for rest and re-association, and subsequent to being brought back up to around 66% quality, the second Battalion's next contribution in the battling came around Mouquet Farm when they were quickly put into the line on 18/19 August to give support, before being immediately eased a couple of days after the fact. Toward the beginning of September, I Anzac Corps was exchanged from the Somme area to Ypres, in Belgium, swapping with the Canadians for a rest. Taking up a position north of the YpresÃ¢ÂÂCommines waterway, the units of the first Division were set in the focal point of the line between those of the fourth, on the privilege toward the south, and the second on the left, toward the north. The area was a generally tranquil one, in spite of the fact that not without its risks because of steady mortar assaults, killing, and the need to keep up watches in a dead zone. All things considered, obligations in this time were centered essentially after keeping up a cautious nearness in the line and reconstructing the guards. What's more, various little scale assaults were likewise attempted with an end goal to draw some consideration far from the battling that was happening on the Somme. 

On 6 October, working together with three gatherings from the first Battalion, the second completed a minor attack on a German position toward the north-east of a position known as "The Bluff" so as to pick up knowledge. In the wake of experiencing a German watch, they were compelled to surrender their endeavor, be that as it may, a brief timeframe later, one of their own watches caught a German trooper from the 414th Infantry Regiment in a dead zone. The following week, on 12 October, soon after 6:00Ã¢Â pm a little gathering moved out into a dead zone to assault another German position close to The Bluff. Subsequent to being spotted, they were exposed to a few explosive assaults, constraining them to resign. Their covering power was at that point in position, be that as it may, thus some of the assaulting power consolidated them and, at 6:30Ã¢Â pm, after a case flood by the cannons had cut the wire before the German position, they entered it. Executing seven Germans, they conquered the adversary obstruction and brought back two protectors as detainees. In transit back, a few of their own injured wound up lost, albeit all aside from one of these men were later recouped. The other man, one of the officers, was later found to have kicked the bucket of his injuries. Altogether the strike had cost the contingent two slaughtered and seven injured. 

After this, the units of I Anzac Corps came back to the Somme, to diminish units of the Fourth Army, which had figured out how to push their lines to a position just underneath the Bapaume statures all through September. The second Battalion was not engaged with any real activities amid this time, in spite of the fact that components from the first BrigadeÃ¢ÂÂspecifically the first Battalion with help from the 3rdÃ¢ÂÂput in an assault on a notable that had created in the forefront north of Gueudecourt, which fizzled in the midst of uncommonly sloppy conditions. 

Winter started to set in now, and despite the fact that battle tasks everything except stopped amid this time, the regiment persevered through extensive hardships in the midst of snow and downpour, in a segment that has been depicted as "the worstÃ¢Â ... of the soaked front". For a short period amid December, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Blamey instructed the regiment before taking over as acting authority of the first Brigade. Amid this time, the brigade was redesigned as a major aspect of a more extensive Army rebuild that brought about an endeavor to expand the capability of the every unit. Prior in the year, the unit automatic rifle area had been erased and supplanted by a solitary Lewis firearm held inside each organization; by year's end this had been expanded to one Lewis for each company. 

As 1917 started with the Allies making crisp arrangements, the Germans, ending up dwarfed and expecting to abbreviate their lines, started a skilful organized withdrawal starting in February and consummation in April. Falling back up to in certain spots, they took up positions along a progression of vigorously braced, reason manufactured solid focuses which the Allies in this manner named the "Hindenburg Line", which, because of the diminished facing, empowered them to free up somewhere in the range of 13 divisions of stores. Following up the Germans, the Allies progressed towards this line, finding that the Germans had received a burned earth approach as they had moved back; the consequence of this was so as to set up their very own lines, the Allies needed to embrace critical development work. 

Because of the moving forefront, the second Battalion's first real commitment of 1917 did not come until 9 April when, on the fringe of the Arras hostile, they participated in an assault on Hermies, one of the station towns of the Hindenburg Line. Under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Milligan, who had taken over on 17 March, the brigade had withdrawn Haplincourt at 7:30Ã¢Â pm the past night and walked to their structure up point. The arrangement was to assault with the force's four organizations propelling next to each other from the north-east to assault from behind the German barriers, clearing down on the town like a fan with the furthest left organization giving flank insurance and setting up a progression of presents on prevent the battalion from getting away while the two focus and the right-most organizations took the town. In the meantime, two organizations from the third Battalion would assault the German principle guarded position from the south-west. 

At last, the Australians were recognized while hanging tight to venture off and, subsequent to being lit up by flares and taking flame from a German picquet, quickly propelled the assault. In the wake of beating this, the left-focus organization, having lost the majority of their officers, lost their arrangement and must be re-composed before the assault on the eastern side of the town could proceed. The two organizations went through fences and the destroyed structures, clearing the edges of the town with little obstruction. The furthest left organization at that point started its undertaking of setting up stations toward the east. In the meantime, on the right, the right-most organization had progressed to the DoignesÃ¢ÂÂHermies street when they had started to take fire. Conquering this and avoiding a wire obstruction, they started moving towards the back of the German primary safeguard line. Now, they experienced harsh criticism from a low slope on the western edges of the town, which took them in the flank and stuck them on its slant. In the obscurity, the area of the foe automatic rifle couldn't be found out at first. The Australians stayed fixed there for very nearly 90 minutes before individuals from the correct focus organization, who had kept away from the greater part of the German obstruction, had the capacity to find it and obliterate it from the back just before sunrise. The two focus organizations were then ready to enter the town legitimate, compelling huge quantities of the army to attempt to get away toward the north-east, where they were taken prisoner in huge numbers. Here the furthest left organization had been setting up various posts in the open fields. The greater part of these were set up with negligible opposition, be that as it may, one company turned out to be vigorously connected by an assault rifle situated close to a sandpit on the opposite side of a street. A little gathering of men crossed the street and endeavored to give covering flame to the company. Among this gathering was Private Bede Kenny who, under overwhelming flame, hurried the adversary position and obliterated it with projectiles, taking the enduring Germans prisoner. For his activities, he was later granted the Victoria Cross. Minor skirmishing proceeded after this, however by 6:00Ã¢Â am the town had been caught and 200 detainees taken, for a misfortune to the second Battalion of eight officers and 173 different positions killed or injured. 

The regiment played just a restricted, supporting job amid the first Division's spurn of the German counter-assault at Lagnicourt in mid-April, and following this the legion's next significant activity came toward the beginning of May when it was associated with the Second Battle of Bullecourt. The day preceding the assault, the legions of the first Brigade, in spite of being expected for rest, had been connected to the second Division, and they were in this way utilized to give work gatherings to discharge holds among the second Division units to partake straightforwardly in the battling. Having not yet recouped its misfortunes from the battling around Hermies, and being exposed to big guns siege amid their way to deal with the front, the second Battalion entered the line on 4 May with only 16 officers and 446 different positions, accordingly easing the 24th Battalion. As the Germans endeavored to drive the Australians back, the second Battalion was moved around various occasions to shore up the line, until units of the fifth Division came up to diminish those of the first Brigade on 8 May. 

The unit's next significant activity came in mid-September when they were focused on the battling around Menin Road, which framed piece of the more extensive Third Battle of Ypres, in a supporting job. On 16 September, the regiments of the first Brigade soothed the 47th (London) Division around Glencourse Ridge, situated about east of Ypres, holding the line until assuaged on 18 September by the second and third Brigades who were to embrace the ambush inside the first Division's segment of the line. Following the attack, the first Brigade, including the second Battalion, went ahead on 21 September and verified the ground that had been picked up. They were in this way diminished in the blink of an eye subsequently the evening of 22/23 September by troops from the fourteenth Brigade, as new divisions were raised to proceed with the assault at Polygon Wood. The unit's setbacks amid this time added up to 11 officers and 188 different positions killed or injured. 

After a short time of rest, they came back to the line close Broodseinde on 1 October, taking up a situation close Molenaarelsthoek, on the privilege of I Anzac's situation for the up and coming fight. The assault went in on 4 October, and in the wake of defeating an experience with a German infantry regiment, the 212th, in a dead zone, the Australians effectively figured out how to catch their targets. Amid the fight, the second Battalion lost 10 officers and 144 different positions killed or injured, some of which were endured after an extraordinary German mortar blast had fallen upon the troops in their structure up indicate earlier the assault, killing or injuring up to one seventh of the strike drive. 

On 19 December 1917, after the regiment had moved to the moderately calm Messines part in Flanders alongside the other Australian divisions following their association in the Passchendaele activities, Stevens continued direction; Milligan having been raised to the general staff. Stevens would thusly lead them through until September 1918 when he was conceded "Anzac leave" which permitted work force who had enrolled in 1914 to return Australia for an all-encompassing time of leave. 

All through the winter, the Australian divisions stayed around Messines, where they had been framed into the Australian Corps. Amid this time, the units pivoted through the line, proceeding to man the divisional segment. The second Battalion had spent Christmas at Kemmel before proceeding onward to Wytschaete Ridge on 26 December. They remained there until late January when they proceeded onward to MÄÅ¡teren. In mid 1918, the breakdown of the Russian obstruction on the Eastern Front empowered the Germans to exchange countless toward the west. Subsequently, on 21 March, they propelled a hostile along the Western Front. On the opening day of the hostile, the second Battalion's lines close Belgian Wood were assaulted by the 72nd Infantry Regiment and in spite of the fact that the assault was beaten off, four men from the legion were coercively reclaimed to the German lines as detainees. The underlying assault, going along a front between La BassÄÅ¡e and La FÄÂ¨re, was very effective and with the Germans making fast gains, the Australians were exchanged to the Somme Valley where they were put into the line around Amiens to dull the assault toward the beginning of April. 

Presently, amid the Battle of the Lys, the second Battalion, alongside the remainder of the first Division, were sent to Hazebrouck. After landing there on 12 April, they took up protective positions around Strazelle to anticipate the German development. On 17 April, while safeguarding the town of Sec Bois, the unit helped turn back a decided German assault. 

Following this, between late April and July, a time of respite pursued. Amid this time, the Australians attempted a progression of little scale tasks that wound up known as "tranquil entrances". In the wake of assuaging the third Brigade around MÄÅ¡teren on 27 April, the contingents of the first Brigade started watches on 30 April to catch German officers to pick up insight and annoy the adversary. These were commonly met with significant achievement, in spite of the fact that they were not without disaster. Two separate watches were attempted by the second Battalion on 2 May. The first brought about one officer being shot while endeavoring to enter a German channel, while the second brought about another being shot by an Australian guard who had not been cautioned that a watch had gone out. Later in May, they took up a situation inverse Merris, staying there until the month's end. All through June and July they switched back and forth among Meteren and Merris amid which time they kept on assaulting tasks, which cutting-edge the line about without critical misfortune. 

In August, having picked up the activity, the Allies propelled their very own hostile beginning at Amiens on 8 August 1918, where the regiments of the first Brigade were connected incidentally to the fourth Division, to go about as its save, guarding the waterway crossing at Cerisy. Following this they were engaged with the development through Chipilly and Lihons, staying available for later until 11 August. All through the time of the primary seven day stretch of the hostile, the brigade endured three officers and 45 different positions killed or injured. 

After this, the contingent proceeded with activities all through August and into September. The evening of 10/11 September, while around HesbÄÅ¡court, the second Battalion did serene entrance attacks against German save positions around Jeancourt. Finding the town unfilled, they experienced a German watch from the 81st Infantry Regiment, which was assaulted and immediately overpowered. Around early afternoon the next day, they propelled a bigger assault with cannons and mortar support, obliterating two German stations toward the south of the town, killing eight Germans and catching 22 others. In their last activity, against the Hindenburg Outpost Line on 18/19 September, the unit endured a further 77 setbacks. 

On 23 September the contingent was diminished by American powers. As of now they were pulled back from the line alongside the remainder of the first Division. They would take no further part in the battling. Toward the beginning of October, the remainder of the Australian Corps, seriously drained because of overwhelming setbacks and falling selections in Australia, was likewise pulled back upon a solicitation made by Prime Minister Billy Hughes, to re-sort out in anticipation of further activities. On 11 November, a truce happened, and as threats reached an end, the unit's faculty were gradually repatriated back to Australia for deactivation and release. This was finished in May 1919. 

All through the war, the second Battalion lost 1,199 men killed and 2,252 injured. Individuals from the force got the accompanying designs: one Victoria Cross, four Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George, 20 Military Crosses, 21 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 58 Military Medals with two Bars, four Meritorious Service Medals, 55 Mentions in Despatches and five remote honors. 

The regiment was re-brought up in Newcastle, New South Wales, in May 1921 as part the re-association of the Australian military that occurred around then, with the legion turning into low maintenance unit of the Citizens Forces, allocated to the eighth Brigade of the second Military District. Upon arrangement, the brigade drew its staff from three beforehand existing Citizens Forces units: the second and fifth Battalions of the second Infantry Regiment and the second Battalion of the thirteenth Infantry Regiment, and sustained the fight praises and conventions of its related AIF contingent. Because of this re-association, the unit embraced the unpredictable heredity of the second Infantry Regiment, which could follow its history through a progression of re-associations back to the first Regiment, New South Wales Rifle Volunteers (Newcastle Volunteer Rifle Corps), which had been brought up in 1860. 

In 1927, regional unit titles were brought into the Australian Army, and the force embraced the title of the "City of Newcastle Regiment". In the meantime, the force was managed the adage "Nulli Secundus". In 1929, after the decision of the Scullin Labor government, the necessary preparing plan was suspended inside and out as it was chosen to keep up the low maintenance military power on a volunteer-just premise. So as to mirror the change, the Citizen Forces was renamed the "Local army" right now. The finish of obligatory preparing and the financial severity that pursued because of the monetary downturn of the Great Depression implied that the labor accessible to numerous Militia units right now was restricted and therefore their facing dropped well beneath their approved foundations. Along these lines, the choice was inevitably made to amalgamate various units. In this manner, the second Battalion was amalgamated with the 41st in 1929, framing the second/41st Battalion, despite the fact that they were later part in 1933 at which time the second was converged with the 35th, turning into the second/35th Battalion. 

Together these two units stayed connected until 4 September 1939 when, under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel William Jeater, the second Battalion was by and by raised as a different unit as a feature of an exertion by the Australian government to quickly grow the Militia following the flare-up of the Second World War. Amid the war, in spite of the fact that assembled and allocated to the first Brigade, the contingent did not see dynamic administration abroad and was rather utilized as an army constrain in Australia until 2 December 1943 when it was blended by and by with the 41st Battalion, framing the 41st/second Battalion. They stayed connected until 17 December 1945, when they were disbanded as a component of the deactivation procedure. 

In 1948, Australia's low maintenance military power, under the pretense of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), was re-raised. As of now, just two divisions were framed alongside other supporting units. The second Battalion was one of those units that was restored, coming back to the request of fight in April 1948, as a major aspect of the second Division. 

Somewhere in the range of 1951 and 1960 a national administration plot had worked and amid this time the CMF's numbers remained sensibly consistent. Be that as it may, in 1960 the plan was suspended and the Australian Army was rearranged with the presentation of the Pentropic divisional structure. Because of this the CMF was significantly diminished and 14 infantry brigades were disbanded out and out, while numerous others were amalgamated into the units of the six successively numbered multi-contingent State-based regiments. Thus, on 1 July 1960, the second Battalion turned out to be a piece of the Royal New South Wales Regiment, and was decreased to an organization estimated component of the Pentropic second Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (2 RNSWR), shaping 'C' Company (City of Newcastle Company). Only before this, on 30 April 1960, the regiment had been managed the Freedom of the City of Newcastle. 

In 1961, the Pentropic 2 RNSWR was endowed with the fight respects that had been granted to the 2/second Battalion, which had been raised as a major aspect of the Second Australian Imperial Force and which had served in North Africa, Greece, Crete and New Guinea. These distinctions would be held by the second Battalion all through the remainder of its reality. 

The Australian Army relinquished the Pentropic divisional structure in 1965, and trying to reestablish a portion of the local ties of the State-based regiments, some of the local organizations of the State-based regiments were part and used to shape new units with their conventional numerical assignments. Accordingly, on 1 July 1965, 'C' Company, 2 RNSWR was utilized to re-raise the second Battalion in its own right. This unit stayed in presence until 1987, when further changes to the Army Reserve prompted a decrease in the quantity of infantry units crosswise over Australia and, at a service held at Newcastle on 5 December 1987, the second Battalion was amalgamated with the seventeenth to shape the second/seventeenth Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, inside the eighth Brigade. Prior to amalgamation, the force's regimental walk was "Braganza", which was affirmed in 1953.
