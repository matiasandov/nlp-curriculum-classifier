Mycena multiplicata 

Mycena multiplicata is a types of mushroom in the Mycenaceae family. First portrayed as another species in 2007, the mushroom is known just from Kanagawa, Japan, where it develops on dead fallen twigs in swamp woodlands commanded by oak. The mushroom has a whitish top that scopes up to in distance across on a thin stem long by thick. On the underside of the top are whitish, indirectly divided gills that are barely connected to the stem. Tiny attributes of the mushroom incorporate the amyloid spores (turning somewhat blue dark to dark within the sight of Melzer's reagent), the pear-formed to comprehensively club-molded cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the gill edge) secured with a couple to various, unevenly dispersed, round and hollow bulges, the absence of pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face), and the diverticulate hyphae in the external layer of the top and stem. The edibility of the mushroom is obscure. 

The mushroom was first gathered by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 1999, and announced as another species in a 2007, alongside seven other Japanese Mycenas. The particular designation is gotten from the Latin word "multiplicata", signifying "multiplicative". Its Japanese name is "Keashi-ochiedatake" (ÄÂÄÄÂËÄÂËÄÂÅÄÂÂÄÂÂ¨ÄÂÂÄÂÅ¼ÄÂÄ). 

Takahashi proposes that the mushroom is best ordered in the segment "Mycena" of the class "Mycena", as characterized by Dutch "Mycena" master Maas Geesteranus. 

The top of "M.Ã¢Â multiplicata" is conelike to raised to chime molded, coming to in breadth. It is regularly shallowly notched toward the edge, dry, and to some degree hygrophanous (changing shading when it loses or assimilates water). The top surface is at first pruinose (showing up as though secured with a fine white powder), yet before long ends up smooth. The top shading is whitish, now and then pale tanish at the inside. The white tissue is up to 0.3Ã¢Â mm thick, and does not have any particular taste or scent. The slim stem is long by thick, barrel shaped, halfway connected to the top, and empty. Its surface is dry, pruinose close to the top, and secured with fine, delicate hairs toward the base. It is whitish to grayish-violet close to the top, step by step getting to be dull violet beneath. The stem base is secured with long, genuinely coarse, whitish fibrils. The gills are barely connected to the stem, remotely dispersed (somewhere in the range of 13 and 16 gills achieve the stem), up to 1.7Ã¢Â mm wide, slight, and whitish, with the gill edges a similar shading as the gill faces. The edibility of the mushroom has not been resolved. 

The spores are ellipsoid, slim walled, smooth, dismal, amyloid, and measure 8Ã¢ÂÂ9.5 by 4Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 24Ã¢ÂÂ31 by 6.5Ã¢ÂÂ7.5Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m, club-formed, four-spored, and have cinches at the basal septa. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are rich, pear-formed to extensively club-molded, and measure 17Ã¢ÂÂ28 by 11Ã¢ÂÂ20Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. They are secured with a couple to various excrescences (outgrowths) that are 2Ã¢ÂÂ18 by 1Ã¢ÂÂ3Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m, dreary, and flimsy walled. The excrescences are unevenly separated, easy to some degree stretched, barrel shaped, and straight or bended. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) in this species. The hymenophoral (gill-creating) tissue is made of slight walled hyphae that are 7Ã¢ÂÂ20Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide, round and hollow (yet regularly expanded), smooth, hyaline (translucent), and dextrinoid (recoloring rosy to ruddy dark colored in Melzer's reagent). The top fingernail skin is made of parallel, twisted around hyphae that are 3Ã¢ÂÂ5Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide, barrel shaped, and secured with easy to exceptionally expanded drab diverticulae that have dainty dividers. The layer of hyphae underneath the top fingernail skin have a parallel course of action, and are hyaline and dextrinoid, and made of short and expanded cells that are up to 52Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide. The stem fingernail skin is made of parallel, twisted around hyphae that are 2Ã¢ÂÂ10Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide, round and hollow, diverticulate, dull or pale violet, dextrinoid, and dainty walled. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are 2Ã¢ÂÂ6Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide, and generally comparative in appearance to the cheilocystidia. The stem tissue is made of longitudinally orchestrated, barrel shaped hyphae estimating 5Ã¢ÂÂ13Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide that are smooth, hyaline, and dextrinoid. Clasp associations are available in the top fingernail skin and substance, and at the septa at the base of the basidia. 

Inside the segment "Mycena", "M.Ã¢Â multiplicata" is like the Malaysian species "M.Ã¢Â obcalyx" in having a grayish-white top, lobed cheilocystidia with finger-like outgrowths, and a lignicolous territory. "M.Ã¢Â obcalyx" might be recognized by shaping a lot littler natural product bodies (with tops 2Ã¢ÂÂ4Ã¢Â mm wide) with subdecurrent gills, a pruinose, hyaline white stem, and extensively ellipsoid spores. 

"Mycena multiplicata" is known just from Kanagawa, Japan. It is discovered developing lone or dispersed, on dead fallen twigs in marsh woodlands commanded by the oak species "Quercus myrsinaefolia" and "Q.Ã¢Â serrata".
