Nancy Cartwright, the voice performing artist of Bart, depicted the scene as one of her top picks. 

At the point when Marge takes the family to the Family Fun Center, she sees Nelson deliberately thumping Milhouse off a circuit and winning a BB firearm from stolen prize tickets. Bart and Nelson endeavor to be companions, however Marge restricts Bart to be with Nelson. Bart goes to his home at any rate to utilize his BB firearm. At the point when Nelson weights Bart to shoot a feathered creature in a home, Bart inadvertently murders it. Marge realizes where he went, goes to Nelson's home and is incensed subsequent to seeing what he did, however as opposed to rebuffing him, she will not have anything to do with his damaging ways and leaves. 

Bart finds two eggs in the winged creature's home and not needing the children to kick the bucket as well, chooses to bring forth them, covertly keeping the eggs warm in his treehouse. Marge gets suspicious in the wake of seeing him investing more energy in his treehouse, yet pardons him subsequent to discovering what he has been doing. With Marge's assistance, the eggs in the end incubate, however the Simpson family is stunned when a couple of reptiles rise up out of them, whom Bart names Chirpy Boy and Bart Jr. 

Bart and Marge take the reptiles to the Springfield Birdwatching Society, where Principal Skinner, clarifies they are Bolivian tree reptiles, a breed that takes a birdÃ¢ÂÂs eggs and leaves their own to be viewed after by the mother winged animal, which is then eaten by the posterity once they incubate. As Skinner considers how their mom wound up in Springfield, the gathering of people gets a flashback from an apprehensive Apu's point of view, uncovering that a couple of the reptiles had accompanied his shipment of Bolivian doughnuts and got away from his store while he was putting them on the rack. Skinner says the reptiles must be slaughtered by law since they have executed many winged animal species.

"Bart the Mother" was the last full-length scene David X. Cohen composed for "The Simpsons". Not long after the scene broadcast, Cohen collaborated with "The Simpsons" maker Matt Groening to create "Futurama", where he filled in as official maker and head author for the arrangement's whole run. Cohen's thought for the scene began as a B story for Homer. In the first idea, pigeons home outside Homer's window at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Mr. Consumes eradicates the pigeons and Homer trips out onto the edge of the window, amidst a tempest, to settle the eggs. Cohen said the thought "[did not] fit in anyplace", so he chose to pitch it as an A story rather, with Bart settling the eggs rather than Homer. "The Simpsons" author George Meyer thought the possibility of Bart shooting the feathered creature and basically settling the eggs was excessively direct, and he didn't think it had "a sufficient bend" to be a decent scene. Cohen and Meyer in the long run chose the eggs ought to be reptile eggs. Cohen thought the contort was what at last made the scene both "contacting" and "fascinating". 

Maker Ron Hauge thought of the possibility of somebody shooting a feathered creature and feeling regretful about it. Hauge told the staff half a month prior Cohen began composing the scene that when he was 13 or 14 years of age, he incidentally killed a winged creature after he got a Wrist Rocket slingshot, and tackled a flying creature that he thought was "far, far away". Hauge said his companions were amped up for it, however he was "kicking the bucket inside". For the scene in which the flying creature is murdered, Cohen got further motivation from a scene of "The Andy Griffith Show" entitled "Opie the Birdman". The authors were endeavoring to make sense of an approach to have Bart slaughter the feathered creature without really needing to execute it, and chose to give the weapon a slanted sight that Bart would be unconscious of, so when Bart deliberately tackles the privilege of the winged creature to maintain a strategic distance from it, the shot still hits the flying creature. After Bart executes the mother fowl, he envisions himself under the watchful eye of a flying creature court with a vulture, a falcon, and a toucan as judges. This succession was added to "liven up the visuals", on the grounds that the essayists thought the scene tended too intensely towards extraordinary authenticity and in light of the fact that a large portion of the scenes in the scene were occurring in and around the Simpsons' home. At that point show sprinter Mike Scully had done likewise with a scene he composed for season seven called "Marge Be Not Proud". In that scene, Bart gets found shoplifting, and essayist Bill Oakley proposed the expansion of a dream arrangement to make tracks in an opposite direction from the authenticity in the scene. 

The Family Fun Center the Simpsons visit depends on a genuine family fun focus in Falmouth, Massachusetts that Cohen went to as a youngster to play computer games. The Bolivian Tree Lizard is a phony animal categories, however Cohen put together it with respect to genuine creatures, including the dinosaur species Oviraptor, which was initially thought to eat eggs. The species is additionally founded on the cowbird and the cuckoo, which lay their eggs in other winged creatures' homes, and Draco, a variety of skimming reptiles. Cohen additionally gotten motivation from the Cane Toad that began "assuming control over" Australia in 1935. 

"Bart the Mother" denoted the last visitor appearance of Phil Hartman on "The Simpsons" as Troy McClure. On May 28, 1998, four months before the scene disclosed, he was shot and killed by his significant other Brynn. "Bart the Mother" was devoted in his memory in light of this. Instead of supplant Hartman with another voice performing artist, the generation staff resigned McClure from the show, alongside Hartman's other repeating character, Lionel Hutz. 

In its unique American communicate, "Bart the Mother" completed 58th in the appraisals for the seven day stretch of September 21Ã¢ÂÂ27, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 7.4, meaning 7,355,600 families. Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson, called it one of her top pick "The Simpsons" scenes, alongside "Bart Sells His Soul" and "Lisa's Substitute". The "Toronto Sun"s Bruce Kirkland composed that "Bart the Mother" was one of the "exemplary scenes" of the arrangement's tenth season. The writers of the book "I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood expressed, "We especially like the ethical problem toward the end, as underlined by Lisa, in regards to the possible winnowing of the reptiles that should occur. A decent cavort, this one, with some pleasant snickers to Homer's detriment." Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide stated, "The show produces average heart as it indicates BartÃ¢ÂÂs endeavors to compensate for his trouble making. The show turns out to be sensibly pleasant if not particularly noteworthy." Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters named the tenth period of "The Simpsons" the arrangement's "first huge plunge in quality, a stage far from its brilliant time [...] with more extensive stiflers and increasingly abnormal plots". In any case, Hassenger appreciated "Bart the Mother", and stated, "[The episode] investigates the showÃ¢ÂÂs sweet and dull sides at the same time as Bart, sorry in the wake of killing a fowl, endeavors to think about stranded eggs that end up holding insatiable reptiles." DVD Town's James Plath depicted "Bart the Mother" as a scene that watchers would either love or detest, as a result of Bart's uncommon snapshots of soul seeking, and he observed the scene to be a vital one.
