Carey had delivered consecutive economically and fundamentally ineffective collections, "Sparkle" (2001) and "Charmbracelet" (2002). In spite of the fact that powered by solid media consideration in regards to Carey's arrival to music, just as her new arrangement with Island Records, the collections neglected to convey the sort of accomplishment she had been familiar with all through the 1990s, and just overseen offers of 3 million duplicates internationally. After the collection's discharge, and its succeeding visit, Carey started conceptualizing and dealing with another task, inevitably titled "The Emancipation of Mimi", her tenth studio exertion. "We Belong Together" turned into a melody that faultfinders considered Carey's "arrival to frame" and "the arrival of The Voice", after a few scrutinized her vocal capacities following the arrival of "Charmbracelet". 

By November 2004, Carey had effectively recorded a few tunes for "The Emancipation of Mimi". Island Records administrator L.A. Reid recommended Carey that she make a couple of increasingly solid singles to guarantee the venture's business achievement. Taking note of that she had kept in touch with a portion of her best work with Jermaine Dupri, Reid prescribed her to meet with Dupri for a short studio session. Carey made a beeline for Atlanta to work together with Dupri where the team composed and delivered "Shake It Off" and "Get Your Number", which were in the end discharged as the collection's third and fourth singles. (Following this chronicle session, "Shake It Off" was quickly chosen as the collection's lead single, supplanting the initially arranged "State Somethin'".) Carey came back to Atlanta for a second gathering with Dupri; amid this outing, Carey and Dupri wrote the last two melodies to be incorporated on the collection, "We Belong Together" and "It's Like That". In a meeting with "Bulletin", Carey portrayed her slants in regards to the melody amid the creation organize: 

I had the chills. I had an extraordinary inclination about it when we wrapped up the melody, and I was flying again from Atlanta at some insane hour of the morning... However, we were tuning in to it on the plane ride in transit home, and even from the demo variant, I truly felt something extremely exceptional. 

Carey and her administration at that point chose to discharge "It's Like That", which Carey called "the correct flame starter", as the collection's lead single. She later thought back about her involvement with Dupri: "I am so thankful I went to Atlanta," she said. "What's more, I need to state, we kept in touch with a portion of my main tunes on the collection. I'm so glad for Jermaine Ã¢ÂÂ he's so engaged, and he recognized what must be finished." 

"We Belong Together" is a R&B ditty. "Moving Stone" called it "heartfelt." The tune is moved by a customized Roland TR-808-styled kick and howdy cap, which is unmistakably used in hip jump music. Analyst Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News remarked that Carey's extra and downplayed singing methodology gave the tune more power, which would not have been accomplished on the off chance that she had belted. The melody additionally joins 1980s retro-soul music by "astutely" referencing Bobby Womack's "In the event that You Think You're Lonely Now" (1981) and the Deele's "Two Occasions" (1987), with Babyface. In the second refrain of "We Belong Together", Carey sings: "Bobby Womack's on the radio/Singing to me, 'In the event that you believe no doubt about it'." She at that point flips over a radio dial: "So I turn the dial, tryinÃ¢ÂÂ to get a break/And then I hear Babyface/'I just consider you...'." The line "On the off chance that you believe no doubt about it" is from the melody of a similar name and "I just consider you" is from the chorale of "Two Occasions." In the remix she likewise says "I just consider you/On two events/That's day and night..." Due to the incorporation of the verses from the two tunes, the lyricists were given co-composing credits on the tune. "We Belong Together" pursues the basic refrain chorale structure and is organized into three particular areas, with each segment displaying the hero in various feelings. The main segment narratives the separation of the couple, and a sad tone is built up as she regrets her previous mix-ups. In the second area, the story changes to the present, and the hero turns out to be progressively fomented and feels "hard and fast of her component" when she endeavors to divert herself by tuning in to the radio, yet comes up short. "We Belong Together" does not have a scaffold; rather, Carey changes into the third segment by raising the pitch an octave, which underscores the sheer dissatisfaction and franticness of the hero. "Metro Times" author Johnny Loftus depicted the tune's creation, verses and vocals in detail: 

ItÃ¢ÂÂs direct, genuine and tasteful. Mariah begs her withdrew sweetheart Ã¢ÂÂ 'When you left I lost a piece of me/ItÃ¢ÂÂs still so difficult to accept' Ã¢ÂÂ and the songÃ¢ÂÂs delicate R&B roll is superbly downplayed, worked from a couple of piano harmonies and a backed off So Def mood. It has a shut-in quality, practically like a harvest time melody would Ã¢ÂÂ you can envision a split-up couple singing it unobtrusively, independently, as the world goes on around them. SheÃ¢ÂÂs on a yard with tea; heÃ¢ÂÂs stuck in rush hour gridlock when he discovers Mariah on the radio. It even shrewdly references that vibe, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface melodies on her radio just too extreme to even consider hearing. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs no worn out 'I attempted to 2-way you' answers, no garbage innovation relationship 'I was at the market and this person had a similar ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a great reasonableness to the verses and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for immaculate Ã¢ÂÂ and flawlessly all inclusive Ã¢ÂÂ pop/R&B songwriting. At the end of the day, itÃ¢ÂÂs the jam. What's more, thereÃ¢ÂÂs likely a cheerful completion, as well: MariahÃ¢ÂÂs triumphant octave move finale makes the songÃ¢ÂÂs title an insistent. 

"We Belong Together" is a basic, downplayed melodic course of action set in F lydian and made in 4/4 time. So also, inside the melody, Carey's voice ranges from G to the high note of A. Carey's vocal range is exhibited with a more noteworthy accentuation in the consummation melody, where the chorale is raised an octave higher, lying from G to A. All things considered, Carey closes with a foreseen coda, finishing both the theme and the melody with an intense, belted note of C for roughly four semibreves (around 17 seconds). It pursues the regular stanza ensemble structure and is organized into three areas that depict the hero in a scope of feelings; from rueful and surrendered in the main segment, to urgent and fomented in the second. In the last area the melody peaks with an octave raise, which underlines the hero's elevated urgency, however her assurance to be with her sweetheart.

In contrast to the vast majority of Carey's ongoing singles around then, "We Belong Together" got commonly positive audits from faultfinders, the greater part of whom hailed the tune as her "arrival to frame", following surveys for "Charmbracelet" (2002), that recommended Carey had lost her mark vocal range and power. Sal Cinquemani of "Inclination Magazine" stated "the... diva [keeps] cool with hoarse, quick flame stanzas until the last full solid voiced peak that... demonstrates that 'The Voice' has without a doubt returned." Additionally, he said that "The melody is as 'inventive' as Mariah has been in years." Other faultfinders praised Carey on her novel singing style which, as per Kelefa Sanneh of "The New York Times", gave the tune its drive, expressing "This style is a piece of the motivation behind why she has had the capacity to transform a song into a mid year crush. 'We Belong Together' doesn't have a visitor rapper, or a hard-hitting beat, however Ms. Carey's dubious vocal lines give the tune more drive than you'd expect, with firmly curled counter-rhythms that pull against the beat." Johnny Loftus from "Metro Times" considered it a "mid year hit" and stated "We as a whole know itÃ¢ÂÂs the intangibles that make a late spring single in any case, those untraceable flows that snatch the heart and feet, and in spite of not being a song of devotion, 'We Belong Together' is that awakening." 

Composing for "Vibe", Michael Ehrlich guaranteed the melody would "cut crosswise over ages", while Cinquemani felt it would resuscitate "confidence in Mariah the balladeer".

Reverberating Cinquemani's remarks about the tune and Carey's past as a balladeer, Jozen Cummings from PopMatters expressed "Carey makes the melody her own, helping fans to remember her 'Legend' days with full, throaty vocals and a smashing peak toward the end. The polarity between 'The Emancipation of Mimi's' initial two tracks is the albumÃ¢ÂÂs bread and butter." Since first hearing the melody on the radio, Sherri Winston from "South Florida Sun-Sentinel" asserted she "realized it would be a raving success", complimenting its downplayed beat and Carey's vocals.
