Dhumavati 

Dhumavati (, , actually "the smoky one") will be one of the Mahavidyas, a gathering of ten Tantrik goddesses. Dhumavati speaks to the fearsome part of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother. She is frequently depicted as an old, revolting widow, and is related with things thought about unfavorable and ugly in Hinduism, for example, the crow and the "Chaturmas" period. The goddess is regularly portrayed on a horseless chariot or riding a crow, for the most part in an incineration ground. 

Dhumavati is said to show herself at the season of enormous disintegration (pralaya) and is "the Void" that exists before creation and after disintegration. While Dhumavati is for the most part connected with just unpropitious characteristics, her thousand-name psalm relates her certain perspectives just as her negative ones. She is regularly called compassionate and a bestower of shelters. Dhumavati is depicted as an extraordinary instructor, one who uncovers extreme information of the universe, which is past the deceptive divisions, as propitious and foreboding. Her appalling structure shows the lover to look past the shallow, to look inwards and look for the internal certainties of life. 

Dhumavati is portrayed as a supplier of "siddhis" (extraordinary forces), a rescuer from all inconveniences, and a granter everything being equal and rewards, including extreme learning and moksha (salvation). Her love is likewise endorsed for the individuals who wish to vanquish their enemies. Dhumavati's love is viewed as perfect for unpaired individuals from society, for example, single men, widows, and world renouncers just as "Tantrikas". In her Varanasi sanctuary, in any case, she rises above her foreboding and obtains the status of a nearby defensive divinity. There, even hitched couples revere her. In spite of the fact that she has not many devoted sanctuaries, her love by Tantric ceremony proceeds in private in confined spots like incineration grounds and woodlands. 

Dhumavati barely has an autonomous presence outside the Mahavidya gathering. There is no chronicled notice of her before she is incorporated among the Mahavidyas. As a goddess of destitution, disappointment, and gloom, DaniÄÅ¡lou partners Dhumavati with Nirriti, the goddess of infection and hopelessness, and Alakshmi, the goddess of adversity and neediness. Kinsley adds another goddess to the rundown: Jyestha. 

The Vedic goddess Nirriti is related with death, rot, misfortune, outrage, and need. Psalms stress contributions to ward off her. Like Nirriti, Dhumavati is related with unpromising things and hardship. Jyestha, likewise an early Hindu goddess, has likenesses in iconography with Dhumavati. Like Dhumavati, she is dim, revolting and is related with the crow. Jyestha is depicted as being unfit to endure any favorability. Additionally like Dhumavati, Jyestha abides in fights, foreboding spots, and has an awful temper. Lakshmana Desika, the observer on the "Saradatilaka-Tantra", recognizes Dhumavati with Jyestha. Both Alakshmi, the sister and absolute opposite of Lakshmi (Shri), the goddess of riches, karma and magnificence, and Dhumavati are portrayed as old, conveying a sweeper and having a crow pennant. Both symbolize hunger, thirst, need, and destitution. 

While there are similitudes among Dhumavati and the three goddesses, the last need critical attributes of Dhumavati, similar to her widowhood and a printed accentuation on her offensiveness. The names of the three goddesses likewise don't figure in Dhumavati's "nama stotras" (songs summoning her numerous names), where such IDs could have been expressly referenced. The three additionally come up short on the more savage warrior parts of Dhumavati just as her sure viewpoints with regards to the Mahavidyas. In researcher David Kinsley's assessment, however the three might be Dhumavati's precursors, they are not "the equivalent" as Dhumavati. As indicated by Kinsley, the idea of ten Mahavidyas may not be sooner than the twelfth century. Dhumavati is revered in Tulunad area in south India. 

Dhumavati is frequently named as the seventh Mahavidya. The "Guhyatiguhya-Tantra" likens Vishnu's ten symbols with the ten Mahavidyas. The fish manifestation Matsya is depicted as emerging from Dhumavati. A comparable rundown in the "Mundamala" likens Dhumavati with Vamana. 

In a story from the Shakta Maha-Bhagavata Purana, which portrays the making of all the Mahavidyas, Sati, the girl of Daksha and first spouse of god Shiva, feels offended that she and Shiva are not welcome to Daksha's yagna ("fire penance") and demands going there, notwithstanding Shiva's challenges. After worthless endeavors to persuade Shiva, the angered Sati changes into the Mahavidyas, who encompass Shiva from the ten cardinal headings. Dhumavati remains in the southeast. Another comparable legend replaces Sati with Kali (the boss Mahavidya) as the spouse of Shiva and source of the different Mahavidyas. The Devi Bhagavata Purana specifies the Mahavidyas as war-partners and types of goddess Shakambhari. 

A legend from the "Shaktisamgama-Tantra" portrays that Sati ends it all by hopping in Daksha's "yagna" and Dhumavati ascends with a darkened face from the dismal smoke of Sati's copying body. She is "all that is left of Sati" and is her offended and offended symbol. The "Pranatosini-Tantra" clarifies the widowhood of Dhumavati. Once, Sati requested that Shiva give her nourishment. At the point when Shiva decreases, the goddess eats him to fulfill her extraordinary yearning. At the point when Shiva demands her to vomit him, she obliges. Shiva at that point rejects her and condemnations her to accept the type of a widow. Another oral legend tells that Dhumavati was made by the warrior goddess Durga in the fight against evil presences Shumbha and Nishumbha. Dhumavati's strict name ("she who stays in smoke") originates from her capacity to overcome evil presences by making stinging smoke. 

The "Pranatosini-Tantra" form focuses on Dhumavati's damaging perspective and craving, which is fulfilled just when she expends Shiva, who himself contains or makes the universe. It draws out her ominous status as a widow and her self-affirmation on her better half. 

The "Dhumavati Tantra" portrays her as an old and terrible widow. She is flimsy, tall, unfortunate, and has a pale appearance. She is depicted as anxious and insidious. Unadorned with adornments, she wears old, messy garments and has tousled hair. Her eyes are fearsome, her nose long and slanted, and a portion of her long tooth like teeth have dropped out, abandoning her grin with holes. Her ears are monstrous and unpleasant; her bosoms hang down. In one of her trembling hands, she holds a winnowing container, while different makes an aid presenting signal ("varada-mudra") or information giving motion ("cinmudra"). She rides in a horseless chariot bearing a seal of a crow and a standard. She is adroit and cunning, however. Continuously ravenous and parched, Dhumavati starts squabbles and summons dread. 

In the "Prapancasarasara-samgraha", Dhumavati is portrayed as having a dark appearance and wearing adornments made of snakes. Her dress is made of clothes taken from incineration grounds. She holds a lance and a skull-glass (kapala) in her two hands. The lance is in some cases supplanted by a sword. Another portrayal in a similar content says Dhumavati is matured with a wrinkled, irate face and cloud-like composition. Her nose, eyes, and throat take after a crow's. She holds a floor brush, a winnowing fan, a light, and a club. She is coldblooded and glaring. Her hair seems rumpled and she wears the straightforward garments of a bum. Her bosoms are dry. Her hair is dim, her teeth warped and missing, and her garments old and worn. 

In some cases, Dhumavati rides a crow and holds a trident. She might be portrayed wearing a festoon of disjoined heads, with red-hued appendages and tangled yet tousled hair. Now and again, she conveys the wild ox horn of Yama, the divine force of death, symbolizing her relationship with death. 

Dhumavati has wild, warlike traits as well. In the "Shakta pramoda", she pounds bones in her mouth, making a dreadful clamor. She additionally makes the dreadful and warlike clamors of drums and ringers. She wears a wreath of skulls, bites the carcasses of the evil presences Chanda and Munda, and beverages a blend of blood and wine. 

In spite of the fact that there are standard depictions of Dhumavati's structure, some moderately ongoing sketches veer off from it. For instance, an eighteenth century painting by Molaram delineates Dhumavati sitting on a chariot pulled by two dark forager winged creatures with bended mouths. The artwork pursues the typical qualities like the winnowing crate, help giving motion, yet in addition delineates her young and lovely with full bosoms and decorated in gold luxury, a distinct difference to her standard structure. A mid twentieth century painting from Varanasi portrays her riding a crow, holding a trident, a sword, a winnowing fan, and a bowl in her four arms, dim complexioned, with drooping bosoms, wearing white dresses and with incineration blazes out of sight. She is again decorated in gold delicacy and wears a gold-slashed lower article of clothing, uncommon for a widow's dress. Another eighteenth century Nepali original copy delineates a total deviation from her conventional portrayals. She is totally naked with high bosoms, wears a pearl accessory and headband, remains on a peacock with legs separated, and holds a mirror while taking a gander at her appearance. A ring of flame encompasses her, perhaps passing on incineration blazes. 

Vedic researcher Ganapati Muni depicted the goddess: 

Dhumavati is constantly considered an apparent "widow", albeit reasonably not. In spite of the fact that related with Shiva, having eaten him, he has since abandoned her. Having obliterated the male component (Purusha) known to man, she is left with nothing, yet she is still Shakti, the female component with inert vitality. Dhumavati's unquenchable craving and thirst is featured in numerous writings, and has been translated as the sign of her unsatisfied wants. 

As a widow in a horseless chariot, Dhumavati is depicted as a lady going no place throughout everyday life and society. She is "all that is unfortunate, ugly and ominous". She shows up as poor people, the hobos, the outsiders, and the ailing. She abides in the "injuries of the world", deserts, demolished houses, neediness, wears out, hunger, thirst, fights, grieving of youngsters, in wild and other graceless, hazardous spots. Widows as a rule are viewed as ominous, unsafe, and helpless to ownership by underhandedness spirits. As a perfect widow, Dhumavati is to be dreaded. Dhumavati is portrayed as a witch or witch, tricky and factious; she speaks to all the feared agonies of life. 

Elective artworks demonstrate her as youthful and enhanced, as an explicitly enticing, eroticised, youthful, appealing yet unfavorable widow. Her thousand-name song says that she gives delight, is totally wonderful and embellished with wreaths, garments, and adornments. She is likewise connected with sex in the psalm, which calls her "She Whose Form Is Rati". Rati actually signifies "sex" and furthermore the name of the Hindu love goddess. She is said to appreciate sex, to be available where sexual movement is, and to be busy with sex. She is said to like alcohol (a prohibited beverage), to be inebriated, and to be loved by inebriated individuals. She additionally enjoys the Tantric ceremony of breaking the five taboosÃ¢ÂÂthe "Panchamakara", which incorporate devouring wine, meat, fish, dried grain and custom sex. 

Dhumavati is an indication of the counter social and unpropitious components in ladies and is an absolute opposite to the goddess Lakshmi. Like Alakshmi, Dhumavati administers over the four months of the stormy season, when even sun based light is clouded by the underhanded water soul. This concurs with Chaturmas, a period amid the year when the god Vishnu dozes. Around then, haziness rules and the spirit loses its typical gloss. This period is viewed as ominous, and accordingly as no promising services like marriage can happen. 

The nearness of the crow, a bearer of death, in her iconography just as her literary portrayal of having crow-like highlights partner her with death and ominousness. Another theme in her iconography connecting her with death is the nearness of an incineration ground and incineration fires out of sight. Her thousand name psalm says that she lives in the incineration ground, sits on a carcass, wears slag, and favors the individuals who frequent the grounds. The "Prapancasarasara-samgraha" relates that she wears a dress taken from a carcass. Dhumavati is the encapsulation of "tamas guna", related with numbness and murkiness. She enjoys meat and wine, both tamasic in nature. The "Pranatosinitantra" partners her with "tamas", while grouping the mahavidyas dependent on "guna". 

Dhumavati is frequently said to show up at the season of "Maha-pralaya", the extraordinary disintegration of the universe and is compared with the foreboding shadows that ascent amid "Pralaya". Her thousand name psalm likewise calls her by names signifying "She Whose Form is Pralaya", "Who Is Occupied with Pralaya", "Who Creates and Causes Pralaya" and "Who Walks About in Pralaya". A creator says that she remains even after Shiva (who is Maha-kala) ("Great Time" or "Extraordinary Death") vanishes, hence she is "the Power of Time", and viewed as past reality. Dhumavati speaks to extreme annihilation, the smoke that ascents after the universe is decimated. 

The goddess' name "Dhumavati" signifies the "smoky one". She is said not to like contributions consumed in a flame that isn't smoky. She prefers smoke from incense, contributions, and incineration fires, as these symbolize decimation. Dhumavati likewise exists as smoke and wanders wherever at her will. 

While Dhumavati for the most part is related with just foreboding characteristics, her thousand-name psalm tells about her sure angles, as well. She is regularly called as bestower of shelters and compassionate. Her song says that she lives amidst ladies and is adored by them. Her psalm sings of her as the provider of kids. 

As a progenitor or Grandmother soul, she exemplifies an incredible instructor and guide, conceding information of a definitive truth of life and passing. Her smoke shrouds what is self-evident, uncovering concealed insider facts and certainties of "the obscure and the unmanifest". Frawley says her external appearance as neediness is tricky and a negligible figment that conceals the internal reality. She is "the favorable luck that comes to us as setback". Dhumavati epitomizes the "intensity of torment". Through the negative viewpoints that Dhumavati speaks to rise the ethics of tolerance, industriousness, pardoning, and separation. Without the noteworthy of this pessimism of life, it can't be risen above and the mystery certainties would stay covered up under the smoky cloak of dream. 

Dhumavati's external ominous, frightful structure uncovers the threats of considering tangible delights as satisfaction giving. The winnowing bin, used to isolate the husk from the grain, symbolizes the need to isolate the external fanciful structure from the inward reality. Her monstrous structure shows the lover to go past the external beguiling appearances and look for the internal facts of life. 

Dhumavati is the primordial dimness and obliviousness, from which rises the universe of figment. She speaks to the haziness/numbness before creation and after rot. This numbness, which clouds a definitive the truth, is important in light of the fact that without the acknowledgment of this obliviousness, genuine learning can not be accomplished. Dhumavati likewise speaks to yogic rest (Yoganidra), the pre-creation condition of cognizance, just as the basic rest (the Void) in which all creation would break down and achieve extreme truth of "Brahman". This void is unadulterated awareness, the end of developments of the psyche, and quiet. Indeed, even Dhumavati's capacity to spread sickness is additionally viewed as positive, as ailment rebuffs the evil and reestablishes vast request. Dhumavati is additionally connected with the heart or center district of the body.Dhumavati is likewise called Ã¢ÂÂArikshyaykarÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂone who devastates both the outer just as the interior enemyÃ¢ÂÂ. 

Dhumavati is once in a while viewed as a more established type of Kali, in which she speaks to immortality and unmanifest life-compel. Another custom distinguishes Dhumavati with "Smashana-kali", "Kali who lives in the incineration ground." She is viewed as an awful part of the Goddess and included among the ("group of Kali") goddesses. Dhumavati's "nama stotras" (psalm with names of the divinities) distinguish her with Parvati, Sati, and commend her as a slayer of evil presences. 

Despite the fact that Dhumavati may appear to be a goddess to be maintained a strategic distance from because of her ominousness, she is depicted as gracious and one who gives her enthusiasts anything they desire. In a few spots, Dhumavati is depicted as a provider of "siddhis" (otherworldly powers), a rescuer from all inconveniences and granter everything being equal and rewards, including extreme learning and "moksha" (salvation). Dhumavati's love is endorsed to avoid all the cynicism that she represents and to rise above the smoke screen to obtain genuine learning. By loving and going up against her, the epitome of the polluted, the ominous and outside the edges of society, one can look past the self-assertive polarities of society and get extreme learning to turn out to be profoundly illuminated. 

Hitched individuals, be that as it may, are prompted not to revere Dhumavati. It is said that her love makes a sentiment of needing isolation and abhorrence of common things, which is considered as most elevated qualities of an otherworldly mission. In this way, Dhumavati's love is suitable for world renouncers who meander as solitary drifters and widows who parallel the life of world renouncers. Dhumavati is additionally depicted a being inclined toward single people and particularly inclined toward widows. Widows are viewed as the main creatures who can withstand her capacity. 

The mantra of Dhumavati is "Dhum Dhumavati Svaha", containing a redundancy of her seed syllable "Dhum". This mantra utilized in the love of Dhumavati, once in a while with her yantra, is accepted to make a defensive smoke protecting the aficionado from antagonism and demise. Her love includes clearing one's brain everything being equal and leaving back the known, thinking about the obscure quietness past, and the Void that Dhumavati speaks to. 

The "Shaktisamgama Tantra" says that Dhumavati can be venerated for the "Uchhatana" (annihilation) of an individual. An admirer ought to envision the world just as the goddess' mantra as dim. He ought to darken his teeth and wear dark garments and watch guidelines, for example, eating small, dozing on the ground, and quelling his detects. In this love method called "kakakarma" (crow-strategy), he should "change his psyche into a crow" by which one can make hurt an individual. Another Tantric content notices the admirer should consume a crow in an incineration fire and, while rehashing the goddesses' mantra, spread the fiery debris in the adversary's home, which will prompt his obliteration. The content further says Dhumavati ought to be revered just by Dakshinamarga ("right-gave way"). While "the Kalarudra-tantra" says Dhumavati can be venerated for ruinous purposes, "Shakta-pramoda" relates that her love is helpful to obtain "siddhi" to obliterate one's adversaries. 

Dhumavati's love is performed in the night in an incineration ground, uncovered bodied except for an undergarment. The fourth lunar day of the dull fortnight ("Krishna Paksha") is viewed as the uncommon day to play out her puja (love). The admirer ought to watch a quick and stay quiet for an entire day and night. They ought to likewise play out a homa ("fire penance"), wearing wet garments and a turban, rehashing the goddess' mantra in an incineration ground, backwoods, or any forlorn spot. 

Dhumavati sanctuaries are amazingly uncommon. At a sanctuary in Varanasi, Dhumavati is the fundamental god. Littler Dhumavati sanctuaries exist in Rajrappa in Bihar and close to the Kamakhya Temple close Guwahati. At the Varanasi sanctuary, which professes to be a Shakti Peetha, Dhumavati's venerated image rides a chariot and holds a winnowing fan, a floor brush, and a pot, while the fourth hand makes the dread not motion ("abhaya-mudra"). The goddess is offered common contributions like blooms and natural product, yet in addition alcohol, bhang, cigarettes, meat, and some of the time even blood penances. Despite the fact that customary enthusiasts of Dhumavati (world renouncers and "Tantrika"s) love at the Varanasi sanctuary, here the goddess rises above her conventional job as "the unfavorable, hazardous goddess who can be moved toward just by brave tantric adepts". Dhumavati obtains the job of a neighborhood gatekeeper divinity, or town god, who secures local people and even hitched couples venerate her. There is additionally a sanctuary devoted to the goddess in Pitambara Peeth sanctuary complex, Datia.
