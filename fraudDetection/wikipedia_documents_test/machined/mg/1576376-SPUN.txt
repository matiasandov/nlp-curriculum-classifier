USS "O'Brien" (Destroyer No. 51/DD-51) was the lead ship of s worked for the United States Navy before the American section into World War I. The ship was the second US Navy vessel named to pay tribute to Jeremiah O'Brien and his five siblings Gideon, John, William, Dennis, and Joseph who, together on the sloop "Solidarity", caught a British warship amid the American Revolutionary War. 

"O'Brien" was set somewhere near William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia in September 1913 and propelled in July 1914. 

After her May 1915 charging, "O'Brien" cruised off the east coast and in the Caribbean. She was one of seventeen destroyers conveyed to save survivors from five casualties of German submarine off the Lightship Nantucket in October 1916. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, "O'Brien" was sent abroad to watch the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland. 

Subsequent to coming back to the United States in January 1919, "O'Brien" returned to European waters in May to fill in as one of the picket ships for the NC-type seaplanes in the main elevated intersection of the Atlantic. "O'Brien" was decommissioned at Philadelphia in June 1922. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in March 1935 and sold for rejecting in April. 

"O'Brien" was approved in March 1913 as the lead ship of the , which was an improved adaptation of the s approved in 1911. Development of the vessel was granted to William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia which set out her bottom on 8 September 1913. On 20 July 1914, "O'Brien" was propelled by support Miss Marcia Bradbury Campbell, extraordinary incredible granddaughter of Gideon O'Brien, one of the ship's namesakes. Gideon and his four brothersÃ¢ÂÂJohn, William, Dennis, and JosephÃ¢ÂÂwere crew members on board sloop "Solidarity", under the order of their sibling Jeremiah O'Brien, when that vessel caught on 12 June 1775 amid the American Revolutionary War; the destroyer "O'Brien" was named after each of the six siblings, and was the second US Navy vessel named in their respect. As fabricated, the destroyer was long, abeam, and drew . The ship had a standard dislodging of and uprooted when completely stacked. 

"O'Brien" had two Zoelly steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers, and an extra pair triple-extension steam motors, each associated with one of the propeller shafts, for cruising purposes. Four oil-consuming White-Forster boilers fueled the motors, which could produce , moving the ship at up to . 

"O'Brien"s fundamental battery comprised of four/50 gauge Mark 9 firearms, with each weapon saying something abundance of . The firearms terminated protective layer puncturing shots at . At a rise of 20Ã¢Â°, the weapons had a scope of . 

"O'Brien" was likewise furnished with four twin 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two enemy of air ship firearms for the "O'Brien"- class ships, just as arrangements for laying up to 36 coasting mines. From sources, it is hazy if these proposals were pursued for "O'Brien" or any of different boats of the class. 

"O'Brien" was dispatched into the United States Navy on 22 May 1915 under the direction of Lieutenant Commander C. E. Courtney, after which she directed her squeeze journey between Newport, Rhode Island, and Hampton Roads, Virginia. In armada practices off New York in November, "O'Brien" slammed into the destroyer , in a minor episode that diverted piece of "Drayton"s topmast and remote rigging. In December, she was doled out to the fifth Division, Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet. From mid 1916-spring of 1917, she worked with the Fleet along the East Coast and in Cuban waters. 

At 05:30 on 8 October 1916, remote reports came in of a German submarine halting boats close to the Lightship Nantucket, off the eastern end of Long Island. After a SOS from the British steamer was gotten at about 12:30, Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves requested "O'Brien" and different destroyers at Newport to take care of survivors. 

The American destroyers landed on the scene at about 17:00 when the U-vessel, under the direction of "KapitÄÂ¤nleutnant" Hans Rose, was ceasing the Holland-America Line load transport . Soon after, "U-53" halted the British traveler transport . As Rose had finished with three different boats "U-53" had sunk prior in the day, he gave travelers and team on board "Blommersdijk" and "Stephano" sufficient time to forsake the boats before sinking the pair. Altogether, 226 survivors from "U-53"s five exploited people were protected by the destroyer flotilla. 

In February 1917, one of "O'Brien"s weapon teams hit an objective at multiple times in eight endeavors with one of the destroyer's firearms, an accomplishment which earned the group and "O'Brien" acknowledgment in "The Independent", a week after week newsmagazine distributed in Boston. 

Coming back from winter moves off Cuba in March 1917, the ship was in the York River when the United States announced war on Germany on 6 April, entering World War I. In the wake of fitting out at Brooklyn Navy Yard, she got in progress from New York on 15 May with , and , and joined escort at Halifax, Nova Scotia, "in transit" to Ireland. Upon landing in Queenstown on 24 May, "O'Brien" was doled out to the sixth Destroyer Division which participated with the British powers. She watched off the Irish coast in organization with different destroyers noting trouble assembles and conference eastward caravans to escort them through the battle region. 

While escorting SS "Elysia" off Queenstown on 16 June, posts on "O'Brien" located a periscope. Making a beeline for the submarine for an assault, a post in the foretop saw the submerged vessel pass close along the starboard side. A profundity charge was dropped yet no quick proof of harm was found. About three hours after the fact, the British vessel detailed an expansive fix of oil in around a similar position. The following morning, "Cushing" likewise revealed and affirmed "Jessamine"s report. The British Admiralty trusted the submarine was presumably genuinely harmed. In any case, later examination uncovers that German submarine , the submarine being referred to, kept on working and finished her voyage. 

In the late spring of 1918, "O'Brien" was exchanged to the French coast where she proceeded with her antisubmarine watches through the finish of the war. 

After the marking of the Armistice on 11 November, which finished all battling, "O'Brien" transported mail and travelers between Brest, France, and Plymouth, England. She came back to New York on 8 January 1919, yet came back to European waters in May when she filled in as one of the salvage pickets positioned along the course over the Atlantic flown by three Navy NC-type seaplanes in the principal elevated intersection of the Atlantic. 

In 1919, she aided the fruitless first endeavor to lay the Ambrose Channel pilot link. In July 1920, she was allocated the structure code of "DD-51" under the US Navy's alphanumeric grouping framework. "O'Brien" was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 5 June 1922. The ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 8 March 1935, and separated at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and her materials sold for scrap on 23 April. The ship's ringer stays in the Plattsburgh Memorial Chapel on the previous Plattsburgh Air Force Base.
