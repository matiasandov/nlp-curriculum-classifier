Rose and Bernard visit a confidence healer on their vacation in Australia, in the desire for recuperating Rose's malignancy. At the point when Bernard visits the bathroom amid the arrival flight, the plane parts down the middle, with the two parts slamming on various pieces of an island in the South Pacific. The couple rejoin halfway through season two, and Rose uncovers the Island has recuperated her. After time traveling in season five they separate from the rest of the survivors and manufacture a lodge close to the sea to live in. 

Initially, the narrative of a lady isolated from her better half when the plane accidents would have been utilized for Kate, yet when Kate's job in the arrangement changed the makers kept that story for Rose. A great part of the couple's story before the plane accident depended on a mind-blowing occasions; she wedded her significant other despite the fact that he was biting the dust. Because of Caldwell and Anderson having other acting duties, the authors thought that it was troublesome discovering time when the two performing artists could seem together in the show, bringing about neither one of the characters including in the greater part of season three. Faultfinders responded emphatically to the couple, regularly trusting they would seem all the more every now and again, and the two performing artists were commended for their work. 

The greater part of the couple's backstory is told in flashbacks amid "S.O.S.". Rose Henderson, an office chief, meets dental specialist Bernard Nadler when her vehicle winds up stuck in a snowbank one night. Subsequent to dating for five months, Bernard proposes to her, which prompts Rose to uncover she has disease that had gone into reduction however has now returned; she just has a year left to live. The two wed in any case, and on their special night in Australia, Bernard takes Rose to a confidence healer named Isaac (Wayne Pygram). Regardless of her underlying challenges, she consents to see him. Isaac is unfit to recuperate her, yet Rose discloses to Bernard that he had the capacity to, so as to prevent him from squandering anything else of the time that they have left together. Amid a flashback in "Pilot: Part 1", Rose is situated alone opposite Jack Shepherd on Oceanic Flight 815, after Bernard leaves to utilize one of the bathrooms, when the plane all of a sudden hits choppiness. It parts separated in midair, with the fuselage and tail-segment arriving at inverse closures of an island. 

Upon effect, Rose falsehoods oblivious on the shoreline with the fuselage survivors, yet is in the long run resuscitated by Jack (Matthew Fox). Amid the initial couple of days on the Island, Rose is in stun, and fends off herself from different survivors, pulling in the consideration of Jack. While Jack trusts that Bernard is dead, Rose is resolute that he is as yet alive. After Claire (Emilie de Ravin) is seized by the Island's occupants (referred to the survivors as the Others), Rose solaces Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), who trusts it isn't his flaw and urges him not to lose trust and petitions God for him. 

Amid season two it is demonstrated that Bernard lands with the tail-area survivors on the opposite side of the Island. After the Others attack their camp, Bernard ends up as one of only a handful few outstanding survivors. They move inland, and find a relinquished research station, where they discover an arrangement of things, including a radio. Bernard utilizes the radio, and reaches Boone (Ian Somerhalder), one of the fuselage survivors, yet Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) turns it off, rejecting it as a trap by the Others. After three of the fuselage survivors, Michael (Harold Perrineau), Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) meet the tail-area survivors, they promise Bernard that Rose is perfectly healthy. They all embarked to relocate with the fuselage survivors. Close to the fuselage survivors' shoreline camp, Ana Lucia unintentionally executes one of the fuselage survivors, Shannon (Maggie Grace), she won't enable anybody to go any further, however they in the long run go ahead without her; Bernard is then rejoined with Rose. In "S.O.S.", Bernard devises an arrangement to make a mammoth S.O.S. sign on the shoreline, however Rose debilitates him from spreading false expectation among the survivors, and won't partake. She admits that she was not mended in Australia, however has now been recuperated by the Island, so fears that her disease will return should she leave the Island. 

In the twenty-first scene of season three, "Biggest Hits", Jack reports his arrangement to fix their tents with explosive to keep the Others from hijacking any other individual, so Rose and Bernard help by integrating lengths of wire. Rose develops concerned when Bernard volunteers to remain behind and explode the explosive. She reluctantly enables him to partake, yet becomes irate at Jack when the arrangement reverse discharges soon thereafter, and Bernard is caught by the Others. He is soon protected by Sawyer, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) and Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell), who murder the Others holding him prisoner. Rose watches on as Jack contacts an adjacent tanker that he accepts has acted the hero them. In the season four debut "The Beginning of the End", the survivors rejoin in the wilderness, where Locke (Terry O'Quinn) proposes they escape the tanker team, as he trusts them to be hazardous. Bernard enables Rose to choose whether to pursue Jack or Locke, and she picks Jack. At the point when the general population who touched base from the vessel use morse code to contact the pontoon, Bernard, who additionally realizes morse code, uncovers that they are lying about the message and that there is in certainty nobody acting the hero them. Jack becomes sick and needs his informative supplement evacuated, so Rose and Bernard help with the task: Rose readies the table and Bernard thumps him out, however Rose is befuddled to why Jack became sick when the island regularly mends infection. 

After Ben (Michael Emerson), the pioneer of the Others, makes the Island move, Rose and Bernard are among the survivors who start to bounce to various timeframes, however they in the end lose the others. Following three years, Sawyer, Juliet and Kate (Evangeline Lilly) experience Rose and Bernard, and the couple clarifies they have manufactured a lodge and resigned, deliberately maintaining a strategic distance from contact with the rest of the survivors since they wish to experience their outstanding days in harmony. Afterward, they salvage Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) from a well, and are compromised by the Man dressed in Black (Terry O'Quinn). Desmond and the Man in Black achieve an understanding and disregard Rose and Bernard. In season six, the hereafter experienced by the characters is appeared, in which Rose is the director at a hiring organization while Bernard is by and by filling in as a dental specialist. In the arrangement finale, Rose and Bernard rejoin with different survivors from the plane in a congregation, where they get ready to "proceed onward" together. 

In the underlying designs for the arrangement, Jack was going to kick the bucket halfway through the main scene, and afterward Kate would develop as the pioneer of the survivors. Kate's unique backstory was that her significant other went to the washroom quickly before the plane split in mid-air, and on the Island she would stay determined that he was alive. Anyway the "Lost" makers altered their opinions about Jack's demise; they chose he would turn into the pioneer and made another backstory for Kate. Regardless they enjoyed Kate's unique backstory, so they utilized it for Rose. As Rose is dark, the makers figured the group of onlookers would anticipate that Rose's significant other should likewise be dark, and chose to make Bernard a white character to shock the gathering of people. They anticipated that the group of onlookers should accept Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the main dark man in the tail-area survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, was unconscious of their arrangements and had been imagining her own better half, a tall dark man, when playing the scenes. When she discovered Bernard was white she was astonished, however not stunned. Sam Anderson was unconscious of which character he would play when he was thrown in "Lost". Amid his tryout he played out a scene where a man from the plane accident was educated his girl was as yet alive, which he noted secured a comparable feeling to the scene in which Bernard is told Rose is as yet alive. Anderson and Caldwell were given an unpleasant thought of the amount they would show up toward the beginning of the seasons. 

Caldwell and Anderson purposely did not meet before their get-together scene in "Impact" as they needed it to be as true as could be allowed. In the accompanying scene, Hurley remarks that he didn't anticipate that Rose's better half should be white, before Jack rapidly changes the subject. The makers felt address that they are an interracial couple, and that Hurley was stating what the gathering of people would think. Caldwell concurred with them and figured it would be odd if the issue was not tended to. Anderson additionally was happy that Hurley raised the issue, and preferred that Jack did not give any consideration. 

The couple's backstory was initially intended to be told amid season three; anyway amid season two, the "Lost" journalists needed to recount to the narrative of one of the foundation characters of the show. As Rose and Bernard are the most noticeable of these characters, and fans were quick to get familiar with their backstory, they chose to complete a scene concentrating on the couple. Caldwell's significant other was experiencing medical issues amid the shooting of the primary season, which was the motivation for Rose's flashbacks in "S.O.S.". Following this scene, Caldwell did not believe Rose's recuperating had anything to do with the Island and expressed "On the off chance that she is relieved, this is on the grounds that she's willed it herself". 

Other than reused film from "Pilot: Part 1" in "ExposÄÅ¡", Rose and Bernard don't include in season three until the twenty-first scene "Most noteworthy Hits". The journalists refered to Caldwell and Anderson's different tasks as an explanation behind their nonattendance. Moreover, it was expected that fans would whine if the couple showed up when numerous performing artists with star charging had gotten restricted screentime in the early third season. The scholars did not have any desire to have the couple on the show to simply remain out of sight; they needed to have Rose and Bernard in the show with fascinating storylines. Anderson found that in spite of the fact that he typically had a fabulous time depicting scoundrels, playing Bernard was "one of the best rides of [his] life". 

All through the arrangement Rose and Bernard have been generally welcomed. Chris Carabott from IGN found the discussion where Rose demands Bernard is alive "contacting". "Television Guide"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Matt Roush called Caldwell "fantastic", and trusted the makers would utilize her again later on. "Stimulation Weekly"s Michael Slezak was shocked when he found Bernard is white, in spite of the fact that he was uncertain why. Macintosh Slocum, senior editorial manager of Filmfodder.com, thought it was "super-passionate" when Bernard inquired as to whether Rose was as yet alive. C. K. Test III, of AOL's TV Squad, preferred "S.O.S." in light of the fact that it demonstrated "two characters' back stories which we've all been yearning to see", and noticed the couple speak to the topic of polarity inside the show. "Lost" maker Leonard Dick called Rose and Bernard "much-dearest characters", and figured they worked admirably in "S.O.S.". Jen Chaney from "The Washington Post" thought it was "contacting" and "impactful" that the couple's backstory depended on Caldwell's reality. Noel Murray of "The A.V. Club" yielded that while learning Rose and Bernard's backstory was engaging, it dawdled and hindered the pace of the narrating. 

Rick Porter from Zap2it was satisfied when Rose and Bernard returned in "Most noteworthy Hits". After this return, Patrick Day from the "Los Angeles Times" trusted they would be included all the more regularly, saying "In the event that they brought these two back ... just to execute them, it will be hostile to climactic". "Excitement Weekly"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Jeff Jensen considered their arrival a "welcome blessing". Maureen Ryan from the "Chicago Tribune" thought Rose was representing the fans when she said "In the event that you state 'live, incredible' to me, Jack, I'm going to punch you in your face", and trusted Rose and Bernard would include all the more frequently in future scenes. The couple were positioned twelfth in IGN's rundown of the main fifteen characters from the initial three seasons. The pundits from IGN likewise enjoyed Rose's "live, incredible" line, which they called "both amazing entertainment and the stuff of strong character advancement; characters like Rose recall and develop, regardless of whether they invest the greater part of their energy in the sidelines". The couple were designated "the informal heart of the show" by the pundits, who noticed each appearance made by them was an appreciated one. Erin Martell from TV Squad thought Rose's job in "Something Nice Back Home" was "marvelous", in light of the fact that she asked every one of the inquiries fans have been inquiring. 

"Variety"s Cynthia Littleton "adored seeing Bernard in Grizzly Adams mode" in the season five finale, while Ryan McGee from Zap2it contrasted Bernard's appearance with both Moses and the Gorton's Fisherman. McGee said "It's a stunning, lovely scene, regardless of whether it remains as a meta-analysis of the apprehension and disturbance of the show's real characters". Alan Sepinwall from "The Star-Ledger" called it "a standout amongst the best, most moving scenes of the finale". Noel Murray from "The A.V. Club" thought the scene was valuable as it enabled the characters to leave the show, yet in addition it made him question in the case of quitting was the correct activity. The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought their choice not to partake "everything except set them as the 'Adam and Eve' [skeletons] from the caverns", despite the fact that this was appeared at be the situation in season six. Maureen Ryan of the "Chicago Tribune" recorded the pair among her most loved characters of the arrangement, remarking "Couple of things made [her] more joyful than seeing them serenely tucked away in their retirement lodge with Walt's canine, Vincent. They had the great sense to surrender the entire island rodent race, and their idealistic, direct frames of mind and rational amusingness grounded "Lost" and gave us a window into regularity, which, goodness knows, we required in some cases".
