The Christian Democratic Party in the past held a seat in this district, yet lost it in 2005. Hareide has never lived in Akershus. Gathering pioneer Dagfinn HÄÂ¸ybrÄÄ¾ten hails from Akershus, yet he keeps running on the Rogaland ticket to verify a sheltered seat. 

Preceding the 2009 race, Hareide reported that he would leave national legislative issues in the event that he neglected to win a parliament situate.

In parliament, Hareide turned into the seat of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. 

After HÄÂ¸ybrÄÄ¾ten declared that he would not look for re-appointment as gathering pioneer of KrF, Hareide immediately developed as the main possibility to succeed HÄÂ¸ybrÄÄ¾ten, after the two other evident applicants, Dagrun Eriksen and Hans Olav Syversen, reported they would not run. Hareide is considered to have a place with the socially liberal wing of the gathering, and traditionalist individuals from the gathering have requested that somewhere around one of the agent chiefs be from the gathering's moderate wing in the event that they are to help Hareide.

Hareide depicted the occasion as "lamentable", however "not illegal". The case stood out as truly newsworthy in "BBC" and "New Scientist".
