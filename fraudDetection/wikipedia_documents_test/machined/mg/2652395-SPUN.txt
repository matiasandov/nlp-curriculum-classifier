Maryland Route 198 

Maryland Route 198 (MD 198) is a state thruway in the U.S. territory of Maryland. The thruway keeps running from MD 650 close Spencerville east to the passageway of Fort George G. Meade past its intersection with MD 32. MD 198 interfaces Laurel in far northern Prince George's County with the northeastern Montgomery County people group of Spencerville and Burtonsville and Maryland City and Fort Meade in western Anne Arundel County. The expressway is a four-to-six-path separated interstate between U.S. Highway 29 (US 29) in Burtonsville and the BaltimoreÃ¢ÂÂWashington Parkway in Maryland City. 

MD 198 was built from US 1 in Laurel west toward Burtonsville in the mid 1920s and finished in the late 1920s. Another segment was worked in Spencerville in the late 1920s; the two fragments were associated in the mid-1950s. The LaurelÃ¢ÂÂFort Meade street was worked as MD 602 for military access purposes in the mid-1940s, supplanting the first parkway between the two areas, MD 216. MD 198 was moved through Laurel and stretched out east along MD 602 to Fort Meade in the mid 1960s. The principal separated parkway segment of the expressway was a piece of a movement at the Interstate 95 (I-95) trade in the mid 1970s. The partitioned interstate was stretched out west to Burtonsville in the mid-1980s and through Maryland City in the late 1980s. MD 198's eastern end was stretched out to MD 32 in the mid 1990s and afterward moved again for its exchange with that roadway in the mid 2000s. The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) plans to extend the staying two-path parts of MD 198 to a partitioned roadway. 

MD 198 starts at a four-legged convergence with MD 650 (New Hampshire Avenue) west of Spencerville. The west leg of the convergence is region kept up Norbeck Road, which drives west to MD 28. MD 198 heads east as two-path Spencerville Road through a crossing point with Good Hope Road and goes through the town of Spencerville. At the western edge of Burtonsville, the roadway extends to a four-path unified parkway and has a three-route crossing point with Old Columbia Pike and takes on that name. MD 198 grows to a six-path partitioned parkway only west of its three-quarter jewel exchange with US 29 (Columbia Pike). Access from southbound US 29 to MD 198 is given through Columbia Pike, a skirted fragment of US 29 that meets MD 198 inverse the incline from MD 198 to southbound US 29. 

MD 198 proceeds with east as Sandy Spring Road, which drops to four paths as the street leaves Burtonsville. The course crosses the MontgomeryÃ¢ÂÂPrince George's region line and incidentally grows to six paths between the convergence with Old Gunpowder Road and Bond Mill Road and the express parkway's intersection with I-95 in West Laurel. The intersection is a cloverleaf trade with a flyover slope from westward MD 198 to southbound I-95. MD 198 again winds up six paths at the east end of the trade where the interstate enters the city of Laurel. At Ninth Street, the state interstate parts into a single direction pair that utilizes Gorman Avenue eastward and Talbott Avenue westward. MD 198 meets the southern end of MD 216 (Seventh Street) and crosses US 1, which includes a single direction pair that utilizes Washington Boulevard southbound and Second Street northbound. East of US 1, Gorman and Talbott Avenues meet up to frame Fort Meade Road, a six-path isolated parkway that crosses CSX's Capital Subdivision, which conveys MARC's Camden Line. 

MD 198 bends upper east and meets the northern end of MD 197 (Laurel Bowie Road) before intersection the Patuxent River, where the course leaves the city of Laurel and enters Anne Arundel County. The interstate, presently named Laurel Fort Meade Road, passes one of the principle passageways to Laurel Park Racecourse and goes through Maryland City. MD 198 drops to four paths at its fractional cloverleaf trade with the BaltimoreÃ¢ÂÂWashington Parkway (unsigned MD 295) and afterward turns into a two-path street a short separation east of the exchange. The state roadway crosses the Little Patuxent River, at that point bends southeast and extends to a four-path isolated parkway as it parallels MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). At the passageway to Tipton Airport, MD 198 bends north and meets MD 32 at a free weight trade. The expressway goes through a S-bend at that point achieves its northern end at a passage to Fort Meade. The street proceeds into the army base as Mapes Road. 

MD 198 is a piece of the National Highway System for its whole length. The expressway is a multi-purpose connector between I-95 and US 1. The rest of the thruway is a National Highway System central blood vessel. 

The principal section of MD 198 was worked as a solid street from US 1 west to Contee Road by 1921; the two streets crossed at the site of the cutting edge I-95 exchange. The solid street was stretched out west to the MontgomeryÃ¢ÂÂPrince George's area line in 1923. In Laurel, MD 198 initially pursued Montgomery Street and the bit of Sandy Spring Road north of current MD 198 from Montgomery Street to the I-95 trade. A different portion of MD 198 was worked as a macadam street from MD 27 (later US 29, presently MD 650) to a point east of Good Hope Road in 1929 and 1930. Furthermore, the primary fragment of the state expressway was stretched out as a macadam street from the district line toward the western Old Columbia Pike crossing point in Burtonsville; the macadam street proceeded with south along Old Columbia Pike, which was then assigned MD 196. MD 198 was augmented with a couple of bituminous shoulders from the province line east to Laurel somewhere in the range of 1938 and 1940. There remained a hole in MD 198 among Spencerville and Burtonsville until the interceding region street was brought into state support in 1956. 

The first course associating Laurel and Fort Meade was MD 216. That expressway was worked somewhere in the range of 1934 and 1939 along a course for the most part north of present day MD 198. Present day MD 198 was developed as MD 602 as a military access venture amid World War II. The principal section of the new thruway, from US 1 to MD 216 close Brock Bridge Road in what is presently Maryland City, was begun in 1943 and finished in 1944. This section incorporated a scaffold over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (presently CSX) in Laurel and an extension over the Patuxent River. The rest of MD 602, from close Brock Bridge Road to the passageway to Fort Meade close to the Little Patuxent River, was finished by 1946. At the point when MD 602 was finished, MD 216 was truncated at US 1. 

MD 198 was broadened to on Montgomery Street in Laurel in 1948. At the point when the US 1 Laurel BypassÃ¢ÂÂtoday the northbound paths of the U.S. Expressway on Second StreetÃ¢ÂÂwas finished, the interstate was broadened east one square on Montgomery Street to the new detour in 1950 and 1951. In 1963, MD 198 was expelled from Montgomery Avenue and put on its GormanÃ¢ÂÂTalbott single direction pair through Laurel in 1963. That equivalent year, another bit of interstate was made from Van Dusen Road to Ninth Street to associate the single direction pair with Sandy Spring Road. That equivalent year, MD 198 was stretched out through the span of MD 602 to Fort Meade. The principal part of MD 198 to turn into a separated parkway was along another arrangement from Sweitzer Lane to Van Dusen Road. This parkway was fabricated simultaneous with I-95 and the I-95Ã¢ÂÂMD 198 trade in 1970 and 1971. 

The MD 198 partitioned thruway was stretched out west from Sweitzer Lane to what was then US 29 out of 1985. That equivalent year, the state interstate was extended to a partitioned thruway from US 1 to the Patuxent River. MD 198 was modified as a separated thruway from the Patuxent River to only west of the BaltimoreÃ¢ÂÂWashington Parkway in 1987. The separated thruway was stretched out through the turnpike exchange in 1991. As a major aspect of the development, the first five-incline incomplete cloverleaf exchange had a circle slope added from the northbound expressway to westward MD 198. That equivalent year, MD 198 was broadened east from the Little Patuxent River to recently developed MD 32 in Fort Meade. The express thruway's western end was migrated from an intense crossing point with MD 650 to a symmetrical convergence in 1997. The west leg of the convergence wound up operational when the all-encompassing Norbeck Road, a province expressway associating the finishes of MD 28 and MD 198, opened in 2004. MD 198's eastern end was stretched out along its present course when the MD 198Ã¢ÂÂMD 32 free weight exchange was finished in 2002. The MD 198Ã¢ÂÂUS 29 trade opened in 2005. 

MDSHA has led an examination on the eastÃ¢ÂÂwest hallway between the MD 28Ã¢ÂÂMD 97 crossing point at Norbeck and the I-95Ã¢ÂÂMD 198 trade, a passage that shapes the most immediate course from Laurel to Rockville. Plans for the MD 198 bit of the hallway call for growing the course to a four-path separated thruway from MD 650 to US 29 and extending the parkway to six paths from the MontgomeryÃ¢ÂÂPrince George's County line to west of I-95. The recommendations likewise incorporate adding a middle swing path to MD 198 between Old Columbia Pike and the Columbia Pike crossing point and developing roundabouts at Good Hope Road, Thompson Road, and Peach Orchard Road in Spencerville. MDSHA has additionally led an examination concerning MD 198 between the BaltimoreÃ¢ÂÂWashington Parkway and Fort Meade. Proposed enhancements are related with the Base Realignment and Closure process that has enormously expanded action at Fort Meade. The favored elective that left the examination was to grow MD 198 from the BaltimoreÃ¢ÂÂWashington Parkway to MD 32 to a four-path partitioned thruway and to build a flyover slope from westward MD 32 to westward MD 198 to enhance the current hand weight exchange. 

MD 198A is the assignment for Old MD 198, which keeps running from MD 650 east to an impasse adjoining MD 198 close Spencerville. MD 198A is the old arrangement of MD 198 preceding the interstate's western end was migrated to its present crossing point in 1997. MD 198A was alloted to the stub in 2007.
