Armed force of the Danube 

The Army of the Danube () was a field armed force of the French Directory in the 1799 southwestern battle in the Upper Danube valley. It was framed on 2ÃÂ March 1799 by the basic catalyst of renaming the Army of Observation, which had been watching Austrian developments on the outskirt between French First Republic and the Holy Roman Empire. It was instructed by General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, first Comte Jourdan (1762Ã¢ÂÂ1833). 

The development of the military was a piece of the French Directory's long haul system to undermine Habsburg impact in the Holy Roman Empire, and, on the other hand, to fortify French authority in focal Europe after the wars of the First Coalition and the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797. In spite of the Treaty, Austria and France stayed suspicious of one another's thought processes, and the reason for the Army of the Observation was to look for Austrian fringe transgressions. Understanding that the arrangements at the Congress of Rastatt were going no-where, the Army of Observation was told to cross the Rhine. Once over the Rhine, the Army of the Danube, was to verify vital positions in southwestern Germany (present day Baden-WÄÅºrttemberg) and draw in Archduke Charles' Austrian armed force. Meanwhile, the Army of Helvetia, under order of AndrÄÅ¡ MassÄÅ¡na, would verify such key areas as St. Gotthard Pass, the Swiss Plateau, and upper Rhine bowl. 

The military took an interest in four fights. In the clashes of Ostrach and first Stockach, the Army of the Danube pulled back in the wake of enduring overwhelming misfortunes. After revamping, in which components of the military were joined with Massena's Army of Switzerland, it pulled back after a commitment with Charles' predominant power at ZÄÅºrich toward the beginning of June 1799; just in the Second Battle of Zurich did the Army of the Danube secure an uncontested triumph. In December 1799, the Army of the Danube converged with the Army of the Rhine. 

At first, such leaders of Europe as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor saw the upheaval in France as an occasion between the French lord and his subjects, and not something in which they ought to meddle. As the talk developed increasingly strident, the governments began to see occasions with doubt. Leopold, who had succeeded Joseph as Emperor in 1791, saw the circumstance encompassing his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her youngsters, with more noteworthy and more noteworthy caution. As the upheaval developed increasingly radical, despite everything he tried to keep away from war, yet in the pre-fall, he, in conference with French ÄÅ¡migrÄÅ¡ nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, in which they pronounced the enthusiasm of the rulers of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family. They undermined ambiguous, yet genuine, outcomes on the off chance that anything ought to happen to the regal family. 

By 1792, the French republican position had turned out to be progressively troublesome. Exacerbating interior monetary and social issues, French ÄÅ¡migrÄÅ¡s fomented abroad for help of a counter-upset that would reestablish a flat out government. Boss among them were Louis Joseph, Prince of CondÄÅ¡ (cousin of Louis XVI), CondÄÅ¡'s child, Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, and CondÄÅ¡'s grandson, Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien. From their base in Koblenz, quickly over the French fringe, they looked for direct help for military mediation from the imperial places of Europe, and themselves raised a little armed force. The climb of youthful and inflexible Francis as Holy Roman Emperor-choose on the demise of his dad in July 1792Ã¢Â also added to their unease. 

On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention proclaimed war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792Ã¢ÂÂ98), France went itself against a large portion of the European states sharing area or water outskirts with her, in addition to Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. In spite of the fact that the Coalition powers accomplished a few triumphs at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and WÄÅºrzburg, the endeavors of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian powers over the Italian-Austrian outskirt and brought about the exchange of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the ensuing Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797). 

From October 1797Ã¢Â until the Army of the Danube crossed into Germany in March 1799, the signatories of the Treaty of Campo Formio had maintained a strategic distance from furnished clash. Notwithstanding their understanding at Campo Formio, the two essential soldiers, France and Austria, stayed suspicious of one another's thought processes. A few conciliatory episodes undermined the understanding. The French requested an extra area not referenced in the Treaty. The Habsburgs were hesitance to hand over assigned domains, substantially less extra ones. The Congress at Rastatt demonstrated awkward at arranging the exchange of regions to remunerate the German rulers for their misfortunes. Ferdinand of Naples would not pay tribute to France, trailed by a general Neapolitan disobedience, the French concealment, and the ensuing foundation of the Parthenopean Republic. Republicans in the Swiss cantons, upheld by the French armed force, toppled the focal government in Bern and built up the Helvetic Republic. 

Different variables added to the rising pressures. On his approach to Egypt, Napoleon had ceased on Malta and persuasively expelled the Hospitallers from their assets, rankling Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the privileged leader of the Order. The French Directory, besides, was persuaded that the Austrians were scheming to begin another war. In fact, the flimsier the French Republic appeared, the more truly the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians and the English really talked about this plausibility. 

Military organizers in Paris comprehended that the northern Rhine Valley, the south-western German domains, and Switzerland were deliberately imperative for the guard of the Republic. The Swiss passes directed access to northern Italy; therefore, the military that held those passes could move troops to and from northern and southern theaters rapidly. The stream was an imposing obstruction to what the French apparent as Austrian animosity, and the express that controlled its intersections controlled the waterway itself. At last, control of the Upper Danube would enable France to move its troops from Italy toward the North Sea, or any point in the middle of, offering tremendous key esteem. 

Toward this end, in the early November 1798, Jourdan landed in HÄÅºningen, close to the Swiss city of Basel, to assume responsibility for the Army of Observation, purported on the grounds that its capacity was to "watch" the security of the French outskirt on the Rhine. Once there, Jourdan evaluated the quality and attitude of the powers and recognized required supplies and labor. He found the military woefully insufficient for its task. The Army, and its flanking armed forces, the Army of Helvetia (Switzerland) and the Army of Mayence, were similarly shy of labor, supplies, ammo, and preparing. Jourdan reported diligently these deficiencies, bringing up in long correspondence to the Directory the outcomes of an under-kept an eye on and under-provided armed force; his petitions appeared to have little impact on the Directory, which sent neither critical extra labor nor supplies. 

Jourdan's requests were to bring the military into Germany and secure vital positions, especially on the streets through Stockach and Schaffhausen, at the western-most fringe of Lake Constance. So also, as leader of the Army of Helvetia, AndrÄÅ¡ MassÄÅ¡na would obtain vital positions in Switzerland, specifically the St. Gotthard Pass, the goes above Feldkirch, especially Maienfeld (St. Luciensteig), and hold the focal level in and around ZÄÅºrich and Winterthur. These positions would counteract the Allies of the Second Coalition from moving troops forward and backward between the northern Italian and German theaters, and safeguard French access to these key passes. At last, this situating would enable the French to control every single western street prompting and from Vienna. At last, to finish Vienna's seclusion, the military of Mayence would clear through the north, blocking further access to and from Vienna from any of the northern Provinces, or from Britain. 

On March 1, 1799, the Army of Observation, in a request of skirmish of roughly 30,000Ã¢Â men in four divisions, crossed the Rhine at Kehl and Basel as units crossed, they took the name Army of the Danube. 

The military progressed in four sections. First Division, the conservative, gathered at HÄÅºningen, crossed at Basel and propelled eastbound along the north shore of the Rhine toward Lake Constance. The Advanced Guard crossed at Kehl, and Vandamme drove it north-east through the mountains by means of Freudenstadt. This segment in the long run turned into the left flank. It was pursued over the Rhine, additionally at Kehl, by the II. Division. The Third Division and the Reserve likewise crossed at Kehl, and afterward separated into two sections, III. Division going through the Black Forest by means of Oberkirch, and the Reserve, with the greater part of the big guns and pony, further south by means of the valley at Freiburg im Breisgau, where they would discover more rummage, and after that over the mountains past the Titisee to LÄÅffingen and HÄÅºfingen. 

Despite the fact that Jourdan could have set up a situation on the quick eastern slant of the mountainsÃ¢ÂÂand without a doubt he may have been exceptional encouraged to do soÃ¢ÂÂhe pushed eastbound over the Danube plain, taking a transitory position among Rottweil and Tuttlingen. In the long run he guided the military to build up a line focused in Pfullendorf. He wanted to draw in the Austrian armed force under the Habsburg president Archduke Charles on the Ostrach level. 

While this may have appeared to be a decent arrangement, Jourdan's decision of ground made issues for him later. The plain underneath Pfullendorf was filled with such streams and rivulets as the Ostrach, a Danube tributary, which depleted out of the bogs and marshes of Pfrungenried; in the spring of most years, this was not the best decision of ground. Despite the fact that from Pfullendorf and the more moderate statures toward the north of the town of Ostrach, Jourdan could build up sensible gunnery positions, the delicateness of the marshland itself would reduce the effect of a bombardment on the Austrian line. The swamp was additionally inclined to fogginess, which would frustrate visual arranging and strategies. Moreover, the non-abrasiveness of the ground would utilize mounted force troublesome, and rangers moves would be made progressively troublesome by the probability of mist. At long last, the significant piece of Charles' military had wintered promptly east of the Lech, which Jourdan knew, on the grounds that he had sent operators into Germany with guidelines to recognize the area and quality of his adversary. This was not exactly far off; any section over the Lech was encouraged by accessible extensions, both of lasting development and brief boats and a navigate through a benevolent area. 

In March 1799, the Army of the Danube occupied with two noteworthy fights, both in the southwestern German theater. At the Battle of Ostrach, 20Ã¢ÂÂ22ÃÂ March 1799, the primary skirmish of the War of the Second Coalition, Austrian powers, under the direction of Archduke Charles, crushed French powers. The French endured noteworthy misfortunes and were compelled to withdraw from the area, taking up new positions at Messkirch (likewise spelled MÄÅÄÂkirch or MeÄÂkirch), and after that at Stockach and Engen. At the second fight, in Stockach, on 25ÃÂ March 1799, the Austrian armed force accomplished a definitive triumph over the French powers, and again pushed the French armed force west. Jourdan trained his commanders to take up positions operating at a profit Forest, and he himself built up a base at Hornberg. From that point, General Jourdan consigned direction of the military to his head of staff, Jean Augustin Ernouf, and ventured out to Paris to request more and better troops and, at last, when these were not prospective, to demand a therapeutic leave. The Army was rearranged, and a segment put under the order of AndrÄÅ¡ MassÄÅ¡na and converged with the Army of Helvetia. Following the redesign and change in order, the Army took an interest in the Battle of Winterthur and the First Battle of ZÄÅºrich and, a quarter of a year later, the Second Battle of ZÄÅºrich. 

The Battle of Ostrach, additionally called the "Fight by Ostrach", happened 20Ã¢ÂÂ23ÃÂ March 1799. Toward the beginning of March, the Army of the Danube squeezed forward toward Pfullendorf and Ostrach, the previous a majestic city in Upper Swabia and the last an adjacent town of 300Ã¢Â belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem. Their objective was to cut the Austrian line at Switzerland, anticipating the Coalition utilization of Switzerland as an overland course among focal and southern Europe. This would apparently detach the armed forces of the Coalition in northern Italy and Germany, and keep them from helping each other; moreover, if the French held the inside goes in Switzerland, they could utilize the courses to move their very own powers between the two theaters. 

The fight happened amid Holy Week in 1799, in the midst of downpour and thick haze, on the swamp southeast of the town. At first, on 20ÃÂ March, the French had the capacity to take, and hold, the town of Ostrach and the adjacent villa of HoÄÂkirch. On the morning of 21ÃÂ March, as General Jourdan later composed, as the Austrian armed force assaulted, his men appeared to vanish in a haze of redcoats, which alluded to the Austrian Hussar and Grenadier garbs. That night, after more than 15Ã¢Â hours when all is said in done commitment, the Austrians flanked his left wing, and Saint Cyr's power was squeezed back to the Pfullendorf statures. In the early morning, as the haze lifted, Jourdan could see the Archduke's impressive power showed on the fields underneath him. The archduke's courses of action clarified that Jourdan couldn't keep the statures of Pfullendorf. As he pulled back, a part of his correct flank was cut off from the fundamental power. 

Despite the fact that setbacks seemed even in numbers for the two sides, the Austrians handled an altogether bigger battling power of about 55,000Ã¢Â at Ostrach, with another 60,000Ã¢Â stretched along a line between Lake Constance and Ulm. French setbacks added up to more than 12Ã¢Â percent of their power, and Austrian, roughly four percent. The French were constrained back to Stockach, where on 25ÃÂ March the armed forces connected once more, this time with more prominent misfortunes on the two sides, and a definitive Austrian triumph. 

At the Battle of Stockach, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and Archduke Charles again coordinated the French power of 40,000 and the Austrian power of 80,000, individually. While endeavoring to rally his troops, Jourdan was gotten off, almost trampled to death by his fighters, and scarcely gotten away catch by the Austrians. Charles' own mediation was essential for the Austrians, and he was in the thick of the battling, purchasing time for fortifications to arrive. The French were vanquished and driven back upon the Rhine. 

The general commitment was fierce and wicked. Prior to dawn on 25ÃÂ March, the French left wing propelled a fast assault on the Austrian conservative, composed with strikes on the Austrian left. The fierce assault constrained the Austrians out of the forested areas in which they had been situated medium-term, and drove them to the town of Schwanndorf. Expecting that his powers would in the blink of an eye be flanked, Charles guided fortifications to back up the conservative. The Archduke himself drove eight units of Hungarian grenadiers into the battle, and amid this piece of the activity, both the Prince of Anhalt and Karl Aloys zu FÄÅºrstenberg were executed by French case shot. The principle French attack on the Austrian focus was slowed down by the predominant numbers. 

On the French right flank, General Ferino endeavored to drive the Austrians back, first with a bombardment, trailed by an assault through the forested areas on the two sides of the street between the village of Asch and Stockach. A third charge prevailing with regards to taking the street, yet the Austrian powers transformed the line and the mounted guns, presently at the leader of a wedge, besieged the French troops. In a pike charge, the French took the village of Wahlweiss, however Ferino's troops couldn't hold it and pulled back amid the night. Jourdan then arranged a general withdrawal from the area, educating his divisions to withdraw along the lines of walk they had pursued into the district, and himself building up an order post at Hornberg. He sent the mounted force toward the western side of the Black Forest, where the ponies could hope to discover better scrounge. 

By mid-May, 1799, the Austrians had wrested control of the eastern parts of the recently framed Helvetic Republic from the French as the powers of Hotze and drove them out of the Grisons. Archduke Charles' own sizable forceÃ¢ÂÂabout 110,000Ã¢Â strongÃ¢ÂÂcrossed the Rhine west of Schaffhausen, and arranged to unite with the armed forces of Friedrich, Baron von Hotze and Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf on the Swiss Plateau by ZÄÅºrich. The French Army of Helvetia and the Army of the Danube, presently both under the direction of AndrÄÅ¡ MassÄÅ¡na, attempted to anticipate this merger of the Austrian powers at the Winterthur junction. 

MassÄÅ¡na sent the recently advanced General of Division Michel Ney and part of the Army of the Danube to Winterthur on 27 May 1799 to prevent the Austrian development from eastern Switzerland. On the off chance that the Austrians prevailing with regards to joining Hotze's military from the east with Nauendorf's straightforwardly north of Zurich, and Archduke Charles' which lay toward the north and west, the French would be half circled at Zurich and hazardously uncovered. 

On the morning of 27 May, Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze gathered his power into three sections and walked toward Winterthur. Inverse him, Michel Ney conveyed his power around the statures, the alleged Ober-Winterthur, a ring of low-lying slopes some north of the city. The general leader of the forward line, Jean Victor Tharreau, had educated Ney that he would send Jean-de-Dieu Soult's division to help him; Ney comprehended this to mean he was to hold fast along the whole station line, and that he would not be disengaged. His little power would get fortifications from Soult's division. Therefore, Ney coordinated the weakest detachment, under the direction of Gazan, to climb a long valley toward Frauenfeld, and another unit, under the order of Roget, to take the right, forestalling any Austrian flanking move. 

By early in the day, Hotze's propelled watchman had experienced moderate French obstruction first from the two detachments Ney had available to him. The Austrian development troops rapidly overran the more fragile detachment and claimed the forested areas encompassing the town of Islikon. In the wake of verifying the towns of Gundeschwil, Schottikon, Wiesendangen, and Stogen, further west of Islikon, Hotze sent two of his sections confronting the French front, while a third calculated to the French appropriate, as Ney had expected he would. Soult never showed up (he was later court martialed for rebellion), and Ney pulled back his powers through Winterthur, regrouping with Tharreau's primary power in the edges of Zurich. Multi day later, Hotze's power joined with the principle Austrian power of Archduke Charles. 

In the First Battle of ZÄÅºrich, on 4Ã¢ÂÂ7 June 1799, roughly 45,000 French and 53,000 Austrians conflicted on the fields around the city. On the left wing, Hotze had 20 legions of infantry, in addition to help gunnery, and 27 squadrons of rangers, altogether, 19,000 men. On the conservative, General Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf directed another 18,000. The fight cost the two sides beyond a reasonable doubt; General of Brigade Cherin was murdered, on the French side, and on the Austrian side, "Feldzeugmeister" (General of Infantry) Olivier, Count of Wallis, was slaughtered. On the French side, 500 kicked the bucket, 800 were injured and 300 caught; on the Austrian side, 730 murdered, 1,470 injured, and 2,200 caught. At the point when the Austrians took the French positions in the city, they likewise caught more than 150 weapons. Eventually, French general AndrÄÅ¡ MassÄÅ¡na yielded the city to the Austrians, under Archduke Charles. Massena withdrew past the Limmat, where he figured out how to brace his positions. Hotze's power irritated their retreat, and verified the waterway shoreline. Regardless of Hotze's forceful badgering of the French retreat, Charles did not catch up on the withdrawal; MassÄÅ¡na set up himself on the contrary bank of the Limmat without danger of interest from the fundamental body of the Austrian Army, a lot to the disturbance of the Russian contact officer, Alexander Ivanovich, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy. 

On 14 August 1799, a Russian power of 6,000 mounted force, 20,000 infantry, and 1,600ÃÂ Cossacks, under Alexander Korsakov, joined Archduke Charles' power in Schaffhausen. In a bad habit like activity, together with the Russians, they would encompass AndrÄÅ¡ MassÄÅ¡na's littler armed force on the banks of the Limmat, where it had taken shelter the past spring. To redirect this assault, General Claude Lecourbe assaulted the boat connects over which the Austrians crossed the Rhine, crushing the greater part of them, and making the rest unusable. 

Before Charles could regroup, orders touched base from the Aulic Council, the majestic body in Vienna accused of direct of war, to overset his arrangement; Charles' troops were to leave Zurich in the as far as anyone knows able hands of Korsokov, re-cross the Rhine and walk north to Mainz. Charles slowed down this task as long as he could, yet in the end he needed to surrender to Vienna's requests. Subsequently, the Russian troops under a learner general supplanted the Austrian troops and their prepared officer in the deliberately vital city. Charles pulled back his power toward the north of the Rhine and walked gradually toward Mainz. In Italy, the Russian generalissimo, Alexander Suvorov, was stunned when he heard this: he relied on a stable Austro-Russian nearness in Switzerland to secure his flank and he expected to join this military by September or October at the most recent. In spite of the fact that the request to Charles to recross the Rhine and walk north was in the long run canceled, when such directions contacted him, he had gone too far to even consider returning to Zurich in time. 

In the Second Battle of ZÄÅºrich, the French recaptured control of the city, alongside the remainder of Switzerland. Eminently, MassÄÅ¡na out-generaled Korsakov; encompassed him, deceived him, and afterward took the greater part his military as a detainee. Massena likewise caught the stuff train and the greater part of Korsakov guns, and caused more than 8,000 setbacks. The greater part of the battling occurred on the two banks of the waterway Limmat, up to the entryways of ZÄÅºrich, and to a limited extent inside the city itself. ZÄÅºrich had proclaimed itself unbiased, and was saved general pulverization. General Oudinot told the French powers on the correct bank and general Joseph Mortier, those on the left. 

In the meantime, Soult drove a little power, somewhere in the range of 150 black powder gun men, over the waterway LinthÃ¢ÂÂthe men held their flintlocks over their heads and swam over, through water to their chestsÃ¢ÂÂand ensured the intersection site for the rest of the power. Aristocrat von Hotze, authority of the Austrian power there, cutting edge on the situation close Richterswil to coordinate its resistance, and was executed by a French black powder gun ball. His successor, Franz Petrasch, couldn't drive the French back, and sorted out a retreat from the locale, falling back to St. Gallen and losing another 8,000 men and a few firearms. When Suvorov touched base in St. Gallen toward the beginning of October, the Austrians and the Russians had been pushed out and he was compelled to lead his men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, bringing about extra misfortunes. 

The French armed force encountered an assortment of order issues, particularly in its initial tasks in southwestern Germany. After the annihilation at Stockach, the military pulled back into the Black Forest. Jourdan surrendered order temporarily to Ernouf, who was a proficient staff officer however had lacking background to hold together a fluctuated and dispirited power. Jourdan resigned to Strasbourg, where he was, or guaranteed he was, incapacitated. When MassÄÅ¡na touched base to take direction, association and order was wrecked. Just four divisional commanders had stayed at their posts: Klein, Ferino, Souham, and Vandamme. Decaen was set to be taken to jail in Strasbourg, pending a Courts-military, as was d'Hautpoul, for his inability to sort out an auspicious mounted force assault at Stockach. The others had vanished to various pieces of the southwest or had gone to France. Nobody knew where Bernadotte had gone, and Saint Cyr had resigned to Mannheim. The last was in any event reachable. Lecourbe, who had been harmed at Stockach, had pulled back to Paris to recuperate; in a deliberately clever move, he stayed there until late November, when he had the capacity to offer Napoleon direct help with his overthrow, and along these lines gained Bonaparte's consideration and appreciation. 

At first, the Army included five future Marshals of France: Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, its president, FranÄÂ§ois Joseph Lefebvre, Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr, and ÄÂdouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier. After the annihilation at Ostrach, the Army was rearranged and direction moved to another future marshal, AndrÄÅ¡ MassÄÅ¡na. 

The Army of Switzerland and segments of the Army of the Danube converged in a joint direction under AndrÄÅ¡ MassÄÅ¡na in April 1799; in June, segments of the Army of the Danube were utilized to reinforce the Army of the Rhine. Both the Army of the Rhine and the Army of the Danube along these lines converged in 24ÃÂ November 1799Ã¢Â to structure another, broadened armed force assigned the Army of the Rhine.
