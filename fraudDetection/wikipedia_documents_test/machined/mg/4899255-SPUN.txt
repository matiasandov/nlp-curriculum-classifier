2/eighteenth Battalion (Australia) 

The 2/eighteenth Battalion was an Australian Army infantry unit that served amid World War II. Framed in June 1940, the legion was allocated to the 22nd Brigade, which shaped piece of the Australian eighth Division. In the wake of finishing essential preparing, the 2/eighteenth was sent to Singapore and Malaya to reinforce the protections of the British settlements in February 1941 against a conceivable Japanese assault. The 2/eighteenth Battalion in this way attempted army obligations during the time at different areas in Malaya, where it directed wilderness preparing and developed safeguards along the eastern coast. 

Following the episode of war in the Pacific in December 1941, the 2/eighteenth saw activity against Japanese powers in the Malayan crusade, amid which they partook in a vast scale snare of a Japanese power on the Malay Peninsula before joining the withdrawal to Singapore in mid 1942. Doled out to safeguard some portion of the north-west shoreline of the island, the regiment took an interest in the fruitless barrier of Singapore toward the beginning of February 1942. Following the fall of Singapore most of the regiment's staff were taken as detainees of war. A considerable lot of these men kicked the bucket in bondage; the survivors were freed in 1945 and came back to Australia where the unit was disbanded. 

The 2/eighteenth Battalion was raised around Sydney, New South Wales, in June 1940, with its first subunits being shaped on 13 July at Wallgrove Camp. Framed as a major aspect of the Second Australian Imperial Force (second AIF) from volunteers for abroad administration, the brigade's initially leader was Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Varley, a grazier from Inverell, New South Wales, and a World War I veteran who had recently instructed the 35th Battalion while serving in the Militia amid the interwar years. The unit focused at Wallgrove on 15 July, and a framework of charged and senior non-authorized officers (NCOs) who were chosen from the MilitiaÃ¢ÂÂin numerous cases by and by VarleyÃ¢ÂÂwas built up, while the rest of the legion's NCOs were selected from enlisted people following their entry. 

Most of the legion's faculty landed on 27 and 28 July. Originating from over the province of New South Wales, the men were drawn from spots, for example, Tamworth, Newcastle, Wagga, Goulburn, and Liverpool, with around 60 percent originating from rustic foundations. With an approved quality of around 900 men, the unit was composed around a brigade central station, with a regimental guide post, four rifle organizations and a home office organization comprising of different help detachments and segments including signals, mortars, transport (later bearers), pioneers, hostile to air ship and organization. 

Alongside the 2/nineteenth and 2/twentieth Battalions, it was doled out to the 22nd Brigade, which framed piece of the eighth Division. The hues picked for the force's Unit Color Patch (UCP) were equivalent to those of the eighteenth Battalion, a unit which had served amid World War I before being raised as a Militia arrangement in 1921. These hues were purple over green, in a jewel shape, in spite of the fact that a fringe of dim in an oval shape was added to the UCP to recognize the unit from its Militia partner; the oval shape assigned the regiment as a component of the eighth Division. 

Essential preparing started at Wallgrove on 1 August, and was given by experienced standard warriors and staff who had recently served in the Militia. In mid-August the unit moved to Ingleburn, and before the month's over individual preparing had been finished. Aggregate preparing pursued, and on 5 October the legion participated in a divisional walk through Sydney. A further move came in November when the 2/eighteenth was transported to Bathurst, where progressively complex activities were attempted, including at detachment and divisional dimensions. 

In spite of the fact that the battling had not yet spread to the Pacific, by late 1940 there were developing worries among the Allies about the likelihood of a war with Japan. After a survey of the protections around Singapore and Malaya, the British government mentioned Australian troops be sent to battalion the area. In October, the Australian government submitted the 22nd Brigade and supporting components. Accordingly, the 2/18thÃ¢ÂÂwith a quality of 793 menÃ¢ÂÂsubsequently set out upon the RMS "Ruler Mary" and left Sydney on 4 February 1941, destined for Singapore. The Australian government wished to send the detachment to the Middle East to join the sixth, seventh and ninth Divisions, so the arrangement was just proposed to be short, as the British government vowed to discharge an Indian division to supplant the Australians in May. Thus, the Australian powers were sent having just been mostly prepared and prepared and keeping in mind that they were still during the time spent being raised to full quality. 

The men touched base in Singapore on 18 February 1941 and moved into military quarters at Port Dickson, in the north of Malaya. While there, the contingent attempted further preparing to set it up for wilderness fighting, before moving to Seremban in March. Further drafts of fortifications landed amid this time as the brigade was raised to its wartime foundation. The rigors of wilderness preparing and the tropical warmth influenced the men, and various work force were hospitalized amid this time with sicknesses, for example, intestinal sickness, measles, mumps and genuine tropical skin ailments. A portion of these were repatriated back to Australia, and before the finish of March, the 2/eighteenth was still beneath its approved foundation, with a real quality of 898. 

In the midst of developing worries among Australian military authorities about Japanese expectations, the planned substitution of the 22nd Brigade was dropped, and the 2/eighteenth stayed in Seremban until they were transported east to Jemaluang in August. The next month they were sent north to Mersing, which, arranged on the east bank of the Malay Peninsula, was viewed as a conceivable spot for a Japanese arrival as it offered a short course of development towards Singapore. At Mersing, the unit was set to work burrowing cautious positions and building wire impediments, punctuated by acclimation watches and hostile to flying machine, enemies of gas and mortar preparing. 

The brigade was set on a war balance on 6 December as pressures in the district heightened. After two days, the Japanese attack of Malaya initiated; while the battling seethed somewhere else, the 2/eighteenth stayed unengaged around Mersing. On 26 December, a little gathering of 2/eighteenth men were disconnected to a specially appointed British assaulting power known as "Roseforce" to participate in an attack behind Japanese lines, ambushing a Japanese guard. It was not until 3 January anyway that the contingent came into contact with the Japanese out of the blue, with a watch from the 2/eighteenth catching two Japanese pilots who had been shot down close to the mouth of the Sekakap River. A fortnight later, Japanese advances along the promontory toward the west prompted worries about the beach front protections being outmaneuvered and cut off. As result, on 17 January, the 2/eighteenth was requested to pull back south to Jemaluang without having met the Japanese in fight. Chasing after an arrival Mersing, the Japanese started to propel south towards Jemaluang in extensive numbers. Accordingly, on 26 January the 2/eighteenth Battalion, upheld by two batteries of mounted guns from the 2/tenth Field Regiment, was entrusted with setting up a snare close to the Nithsdale Estate and the elastic ranch at Joo Lye. 

Building up themselves along the MersingÃ¢ÂÂJemaluang street, 'D' Company was sent toward the north on the western side of the street as the post compel, while 'B' Company was situated further toward the south on the contrary side of the street. South of them, 'A' Company shaped the blocking power, with their position extended over the street arranged toward the north. Behind them, 'C' Company was situated for possible later use, further south. The arrangement had been for the trap to be sprung amid the day, however the Japanese development had continued more gradually than thought, and it was not until after dull that they entered the snare site. So as to deliver whatever number setbacks as could be allowed, the Japanese power, which was assessed to be regiment estimated, was permitted to go through 'D' and 'B' Companies. By 3:00Ã¢Â am they faced 'A' Company's blocking position and the trap was at long last started. Crushing circuitous flame from cannons and mortars exacted overwhelming setbacks on the Japanese; be that as it may, as the northernmost companyÃ¢ÂÂ'D'Ã¢ÂÂturned south to assault the Japanese from the back, they faced decided opposition from a power of Japanese that had figured out how to penetrate the snare site and delve in on a little element toward the east of the home's pig ranch, north of 'B' Company. This adequately cut them off from the remainder of the contingent. 

Battling seethed all through the early morning as 'B' Company vainly endeavored to help the cut-off 'D' Company. Varley chose to dispatch a counterattack with 'A' Company, however at 8:00Ã¢Â am the request to pull back originated from unit central station, dropping the assault. Secured by the save organization, 'An' and some of 'B' Company had the capacity to dampen contact and fall back. 'D' Company, alongside those of 'B' Company that were as yet confined and in contact, must be left to battle their way back to the unit's lines. When they touched base, there were sufficiently just men left to shape one detachment. The 2/eighteenth's misfortunes in this activity added up to around 90 men executed, injured or missing. Japanese misfortunes are obscure, yet are believed to be huge and they were unfit to take Jemaluang for two more days. 

After the withdrawal from Nithsdale, the force fell back along the JemaluangÃ¢ÂÂKota Tinggi Road, before covering the Allied withdrawal over the JohorÃ¢ÂÂSingapore Causeway to Singapore Island. No commitment were battled amid this stage, however the 2/eighteenth watched continually and gave rearguard separations. Amid this time, the regiment was quickly directed by Major William Fraser, when Varley incidentally took over Eastforce, which comprised of the 22nd Brigade and various Indian and Malay developments, filling in for Brigadier Harold Burfield Taylor, who was briefly disconnected to arrange a power to cover the withdrawal. Following its landing on the island, Varley came back to the unit, which got few reinforcementsÃ¢ÂÂabout 90 menÃ¢ÂÂand was apportioned to the protection of the Western Area alongside the remainder of the eighth Division. Shaping piece of the 22nd Brigade's protective line in the north-west segment, extending from the Causeway to the Sungei Berih, the regiment was in charge of guarding a facing of . With a quality of 37 officers and 826 different positions, the legion involved a situation in the focal point of the detachment that extended from the 2/twentieth's situation around Kranji to the 2/nineteenth's around Sungei Sarimbun, north-east of the town of Ama Keng and Tengah Airfield. 

Comprising of "tidal mud pads and mangrove swamps crossed with streams and channels", there had been no work done to set up the region that the legion was assigned to shield preceding its entry because of political worries about disturbing the nearby populace. The wide facing extended the 2/eighteenth dainty on the ground, with no profundity and vast holes between positions that were isolated in spots by tidal conduits. Because of the thick vegetation along the shoreline, the contingent's positions had the additional debilitation of poor perceivability of the water and restricted fields of flame that, joined with their disconnection, implied that they were unfit to help one another. Subsequent to possessing their situations on 1 February, the regiment attempted to improve them decently well, working under the front of haziness in order to stay away from Japanese gunnery and air assaults. 

The Japanese assault on the north-west coast went ahead the evening of 8/9 February, start with an overwhelming big guns and flying barrage of the 22nd Brigade's situations for the duration of the day, trailed by a waterborne strike over the Johore Strait, which started around 10:30Ã¢Â pm. Gone up against by 16 legions from the Japanese fifth and eighteenth Divisions, which concentrated upon the 2/eighteenth's and 2/twentieth's positions, the 2/eighteenth's two forward companiesÃ¢ÂÂ'A' and 'C'Ã¢ÂÂstrongly opposed two frontal ambushes amid the day. Substantial losses were caused on the Japanese through the span of a few hours, yet the safeguards were in the long run constrained back by overwhelming aberrant flame and overpowering numbers. Abusing the gaps in the force's border to stay away from opposition, by 1:30Ã¢Â am on 9 February the Japanese had entered towards regiment home office close to the Lim Chau Kang street, taking steps to move up the unit's back. Varley then arranged the forward organizations to make a battling withdrawal and fall back on contingent home office. Overwhelming battling pursued, amid which the Australians endured grave misfortunes as gatherings wound up lost in the dimness in the thick nation, before the unit had the capacity to restore itself around Ama Keng. 

The 2/eighteenth endeavored to guard the Tengah Airfield, yet by 1:00Ã¢Â pm toward the evening of 9 February they had been diminished to just 330 men and were pulled back toward the south-east of the landing strip, possessing a situation around Bulim along the Chu Kang Road, with the 2/29th Battalion to their left side. For the duration of the evening of 9/10 February, minor conflicts happened as watches were conveyed to battle off Japanese tests. The contingent kept on holding the line until 6:00Ã¢Â am when, following receipt of requests to pull back, it moved back to Keat Hong town to take up the job of unit save. The transporter detachment secured the force's withdrawal, and in the midst of overwhelming gunnery shelling, they trapped two Japanese segments, each generally organization estimated, delivering substantial setbacks upon them with their Vickers automatic weapons before breaking contact. 

Because of a confusion of requests, the 22nd Brigade fell back towards Reformatory Road where the 2/eighteenth took up positions toward the west between the intersections of the Ulu Pandan and Bukit Timah Roads. At the point when the detachment propelled a counterattack soon thereafter, most of the force was kept down for possible later use, in the wake of enduring numerous losses. A solitary organization, however, was disengaged as of now to a specially appointed arrangement named "X Battalion", entrusted with propelling a counterattack. In the mean time, the remainder of the brigade moved again into the hold position along the Bukit Panjang Road. 

That night the 2/eighteenth involved a position north of an element named "127", yet at an opportune time the morning of 11 February they were moved back south of there to increase better fields of flame. Not long after this, the 2/eighteenth went under assault from front and back after the Japanese figured out how to penetrate behind their position, constraining the 2/eighteenth to fall back further under the front of the flame from the bearers by and by. Later amid 11 February, the 22nd Brigade home office, arranged around Wai Soon Gardens, went under assault from a Japanese power moving south from Bukit Timah. Accordingly, the 2/eighteenth propelled a counterattack crosswise over Reformatory Road with pikes. In the meantime, an area from the force's transporter detachment, under the direction of Lieutenant Iven John Mackay, child of Lieutenant General Iven Giffard Mackay, led a challenging assault that ceased the Japanese development. Moving up the pivot of the street, shooting automatic rifles and heaving projectiles, they progressed to the Bukit Timah Road before traveling south to Holland Road and after that coming back to contingent central station. 

After this, the 22nd Brigade moved back towards the intersection of Holland and Ulu Padan Roads. Moving while under overwhelming flame, the brigade built up itself in its new position before 9:00Ã¢Â am, yet in the perplexity of the move, a few men ended up isolated from the fundamental body and cut off. Toward the evening, after the detachment position was reoriented toward the west, the unit was put available for later. The contingent's situations in the north, arranged on the high ground, experienced overwhelming assault from Japanese air ship and gunnery, as the brigadeÃ¢ÂÂsupported by Australian and British artilleryÃ¢ÂÂfought off two regiments from the Japanese eighteenth Division throughout the evening of 11/12 February. 

Promptly the next morning, Varley was elevated to brigadier and took over as administrator of the 22nd Brigade from Taylor, who became sick. In Varley's place, Major Charles O'Brien, who had recently been the force second-in-order, took over direction of the brigade. After a concise break in the battling in the 22nd Brigade's part, the Japanese eighteenth Division assaulted once more, endeavoring to take the detachment to its left side flank. Accordingly, the 2/eighteenth was sent to retake a portion of the high ground south-east of the Ulu Pandan and Reformatory Roads late toward the evening. Assaulting with around 60 men, upheld by three British shielded vehicles and ordnance fire, they were unfit to retake the situation after the light fizzled. The Japanese at that point squeezed vigorously against the 22nd Brigade's position, and they were compelled to give ground, falling back to the intersection of Buona Vista and Holland Roads, by which time the 2/eighteenth was down to just 250 men. 

On 13 February, trying to pick up space for a conceivable counterattack, the Allied administrator, Lieutenant General Arthur Percival, requested a shortening of the Allied lines towards the south-east and the development of an edge around Singapore city. As a piece of this, the Australian powers were amassed into an edge revolved around Farrer and Holland Roads, about west of the city, entrusted with safeguarding the north-east area of the guarded line. The 2/eighteenth was situated among the headstones of Cemetery Hill, and separated from a couple of minor conflicts and overflights by Japanese air ship spotting for big guns, a time of reprieve followed in the Australian area. The Japanese avoided the position, moving in an easterly bearing towards the city, by method for holes in the line which opened toward the north and south of the Australians through positions held by British, Indian and Malay units. 

The Japanese kept on progressing into the edges of Singapore all through 14 February. Compromised with being segregated, the Australians made arrangements to make a last stand. With the Japanese shutting in, the island's regular citizen populace started to endure intensely as they were exposed to overwhelming mounted guns siege and ethereal assaults from Japanese airplane that were progressively unopposed as hostile to air ship firearms came up short on ammo. Supplies of water and sustenance additionally dwindled, and the water lack was aggravated by the loss of the island's stores. At last, in the first part of the day of 15 February, after the Japanese had prevailing with regards to penetrating towards Mount Pleasant Ridge, Percival established that a counterattack was not practical and rather chosen to surrender the battalion. The contingent's last association in the battling came that evening when 'An' and 'D' Companies were vigorously shelled. A brief span later, at 8:30Ã¢Â pm, the surrender became effective and the men of the 2/eighteenth got orders not to get away. 

While most of the 2/eighteenth complied with the request not to circumvent following the surrender, few men endeavored to dodge catch. Alongside different individuals from the contingent who had ended up cut off from the remainder of the unit prior in the battling, they endeavored to advance back to Allied lines by means of Sumatra. There, some were in the end caught, while others figured out how to escape to Ceylon. Of these, 24 in the long run figured out how to come back to Australia, some of whom were exchanged to different units and later participated in further battling in New Guinea. At the point when the Japanese landed to impact the catch of the 2/eighteenth, six men from the bearer detachment, which had prior dispensed substantial setbacks upon the Japanese amid the battling, were requested to move the brigade's transporters, before being tied up and executed. Four other 2/eighteenth officers were murdered in the slaughter at the Alexandra Hospital. The enduring individuals from the legion were then walked to the wartime captive camp at Changi. 

In the blink of an eye a while later, the men were part up and sent to different areas to fill in as constrained workers. Most of the 2/eighteenth's faculty were sent to Blakang Mati, yet some stayed in Changi, while others were sent to Japan or were sent to take a shot at the ThaiÃ¢ÂÂBurma Railway. An aggregate of 174 men were sent to Borneo where in 1945 they were exposed to the Sandakan Death Marches, which just around 10% of the 2/eighteenth men endure. In spite of being isolated, however, wherever conceivable the 2/eighteenth men tried to remain together in their gatherings and the unit structure was kept up even in bondage. The unit's initially boss, Varley, was one of those sent to Burma where, as senior Allied officer, he attempted to verify the welfare of more than 9,000 men dealing with the railroad, including numerous from the 2/eighteenth. He was later sent to Thailand before being taken back to Singapore once work was finished. In late 1944 he was exchanged to Formosa. On 12 September, while on the way, SS "Rakuyo Maru", the vehicle transport on which he and around 1,250 different detainees were voyaging was torpedoed by a US submarine, USS "Sealion". Varley assumed responsibility for a few rafts of detainees amid the clearing, endeavoring to lead them to security. They were gone forever and are accepted to have been machine-gunned a few days after the fact by Japanese frigates that were in the region. 

Amid their time in imprisonment, men from the 2/eighteenth attempted various rebellious exercises including building a radio transmitter, which they used to contact neighborhood obstruction bunches who gave them help with the type of prescription and knowledge. They were likewise associated with various break endeavors, some of which were fruitful, close by Australians from different units. One of these fruitful getaways included a gathering of eight men who got away from the camp on Berhala Island in two gatherings. One gathering got away while out of camp on a work detail, while the other basically exited the front entryway to utilize the ablutions and never returned. In the wake of gathering up outside the camp, the men split up once more. One gathering included Lieutenant Charles Wagner, who had recently been finished with the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his activities around the Nithsdale Estate and who had been appointed in the field. Having paid off one of the camp protects, Wagner's gathering had reached the neighborhood guerillas and organized to meet with an angling vessel. Subsequent to hanging out for three weeks, the vessel in the end arrived seaward and accepted them. The gathering at that point got together with different escapees on Tawi-Tawi where in mid-1943 they started working with the Filipino guerilla powers, battling nearby them until the finish of the war. Different breaks happened later in the war, incorporating one in which five men got away from Ranau through the span of two days toward the beginning of July 1945 amid one of the passing walks. In the wake of affecting their getaway, these men were helped by local people who gave nourishment and data, before the men had the capacity to get together with certain Australians from Z Special Unit. 

Following the finish of the war in August 1945, the men that made due as detainees of war were repatriated to Australia. Returning via flying machine and ship, this was to a great extent finished by October, and soon thereafter the contingent was formally disbanded. A sum of 1,323 men served in the brigade all through its reality, including fortifications and faculty that were exchanged. The legion's fight setbacks added up to 80 slaughtered and 10 injured in Malaya, just as 175 executed and 238 injured in Singapore. Over this 225 men from the 2/eighteenth kicked the bucket in imprisonment as detainees of war. For their inclusion in the war, individuals from the contingent got the accompanying embellishments: one Military Cross, two Distinguished Conduct Medals, one Military Medal, two Members of the Order of the British Empire, and 11 Mentions in Despatches. 

The 2/eighteenth Battalion got the accompanying fight respects:
