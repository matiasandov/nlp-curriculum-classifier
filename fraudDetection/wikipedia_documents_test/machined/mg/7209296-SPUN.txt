AmlaÄÂ­b Conung 

AmlaÄÂ­b Conung (; kicked the bucket c. 874) was a Viking head in Ireland and Scotland in the mid-late ninth century. He was the child of the lord of Lochlann, recognized in the non-contemporary "Fragmentary Annals of Ireland" as Gofraid, and sibling of Auisle and ÄÂmar, the last of whom established the UÄÂ­ ÄÂmair line, and whose relatives would proceed to rule the Irish Sea area for a few centuries. Another Viking head, Halfdan Ragnarsson, is considered by certain researchers to be another sibling. The Irish Annals title AmlaÄÂ­b, ÄÂmar and Auisle "rulers of the outsiders". Current researchers utilize the title "rulers of Dublin" after the Viking settlement which shaped the base of their capacity. The sobriquet "Conung" is gotten from the Old Norse "konungr" and essentially signifies "lord". A few researchers consider AmlaÄÂ­b to be indistinguishable to Olaf the White, a Viking ocean ruler who includes in the "LandnÄÄmabÄÅk" and other Icelandic adventures. 

Amid the late 850s and mid 860s AmlaÄÂ­b was associated with an extended clash with MÄÄel Sechnaill, overking of the Southern UÄÂ­ NÄÅ¡ill and the most dominant ruler in Ireland. The reason for the contention is questionable, however it might have been started by rivalry for control of Munster and its assets. AmlaÄÂ­b partnered progressively with Cerball, King of Ossory and 

ÄÂed Findliath, overking of the Northern UÄÂ­ NÄÅ¡ill against MÄÄel Sechnaill. MÄÄel Sechnaill passed on in 862 and his territories were part, adequately finishing the contention. Following this AmlaÄÂ­b and his kinfolk warred with a few Irish pioneers trying to grow their kingdom's impact. In later years AmlaÄÂ­b directed broad attacks in Scotland, however these were hindered by a war in 868 against his previous partner ÄÂed Findliath when a few Viking longphorts along the northern coast were flattened. AmlaÄÂ­b vanishes from contemporary archives in 871. Later records state he came back to Lochlann to help his dad in a war, and the "Pictish Chronicle" says he passed on fighting against Constantine I of Scotland. This occasion is normally dated to 874. 

The most punctual recorded Viking assaults in Ireland happened in 795. After some time, these assaults expanded in force, and they overwintered in Ireland without precedent for 840Ã¢ÂÂ841. Later in 841 a longphort was built at ÄÂth Cliath (Irish for "jumped portage"), a site which would later form into the city of Dublin. Longphorts were likewise settled at different locales around Ireland, some of which formed into bigger Viking settlements after some time. The Viking populace in Ireland was helped in 851 with the landing of a huge gathering known as "dim outsiders" Ã¢ÂÂ a petulant term typically considered to mean the recently arrived Vikings, instead of the "reasonable outsiders", for example the Viking populace which was inhabitant in landing before this flood. A kingdom in Viking Scotland was built up by the mid ninth-century, and it applied command over a portion of the Vikings in Ireland. By 853 a different kingdom of Dublin had been set up which asserted authority over every one of the Vikings in Ireland. 

The most punctual notice of AmlaÄÂ­b Conung is in the "Chronicles of Ulster", which in 853 portray his entry in Ireland: 

AmlaÄÂ­b is named in the archives as a "lord of the outsiders", yet in present day writings he is normally marked the primary ruler of Dublin, after the Viking settlement which was the base of his capacity. His siblings touched base in Ireland later, and they controlled together as co-rulers. The "Fragmentary Annals" broadly expound with respect to AmlaÄÂ­b's entry: 

Lochlann, initially Laithlinn or Lothlend, the land where AmlaÄÂ­b's dad was the best, is frequently related to Norway, yet it isn't generally acknowledged that it had such a significance in early occasions. A few history specialists have proposed rather that in early occasions, and positively as late as the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, Laithlinn alludes to the Norse and Norse-Gael arrives in the Hebrides, the Isle of Man, the Northern Isles and parts of terrain Scotland. Whatever the first sense, by the twelfth century, when Magnus Barefoot attempted his undertaking toward the West, it had come to mean Norway. 

On the off chance that he did surely leave Ireland, AmlaÄÂ­b had returned by 857 at the most recent when he and ÄÂmar battled against MÄÄel Sechnaill, overking of the Southern UÄÂ­ NÄÅ¡ill, and a gathering of Vikings some of the time known as the Norse-Irish. MÄÄel Sechnaill was the most dominant ruler in Ireland at the time and his properties lay near the Viking settlement of Dublin. The battling started in the earlier year: "Incredible fighting between the pagans and Mael Sechnaill, upheld by Norse-Irish" is accounted for by the Annals of Ulster. 

The battling was centered around Munster; MÄÄel Sechnaill tried to build his impact over the lords there. He took prisoners from the territory in 854, 856 and 858, and the intensity of the over-rulers had been debilitated in 856 by a Viking attack on the regal focus at Lough Cend, when GormÄÄn child of LonÄÄn, a relative of Munster's over-lord, was executed nearby a considerable number of others. This shortcoming likely drew the look of both MÄÄel Sechnaill and the Vikings, and their opposition for Munster's assets may have been the reason for the war. Early fights appear to have gone the method for the Vikings: AmlaÄÂ­b and ÄÂmar "exacted a defeat on Caitill the Fair and his Norse-Irish in the grounds of Munster". In spite of the fact that there is no sure proof to recommend that this Caitill is a similar individual as the Ketill Flatnose of later adventures, Anderson and Crawford have proposed that they are a similar individual. 

In 858 ÄÂmar, aligned with Cerball, King of Ossory, steered a power of Norse-Irish at Araid TÄÂ­re (east of Lough Derg and the Shannon in cutting edge County Tipperary). Ossory was a little kingdom wedged between the bigger domains of Munster and Leinster. Toward the start of his reign during the 840s, Cerball's loyalty was promised to the over-lord of Munster, yet as that kingdom became more fragile Ossory's key area permitted open doors for his headway. Cerball had recently battled against the Vikings, yet he aligned with them to challenge the matchless quality of MÄÄel Sechnaill and his Norse-Irish partners. The next year AmlaÄÂ­b, ÄÂmar and Cerball directed a strike on MÄÄel Sechnaill's heartlands in Meath, and in outcome a regal meeting was held at Rathugh (current County Westmeath). Following this gathering Cerball shed his devotion to the Vikings and formally submitted to MÄÄel Sechnaill so as to "make harmony and friendship between the men of Ireland". 

With their partner betrayed them, AmlaÄÂ­b and ÄÂmar looked for another coalition with ÄÂed Findliath, overking of the Northern UÄÂ­ NÄÅ¡ill, and opponent of MÄÄel Sechnaill. In 860 MÄÄel Sechnaill and Cerball drove an extensive armed force of men from Munster, Leinster, Connacht and the Southern UÄÂ­ NÄÅ¡ill into the grounds of ÄÂed Findliath close Armagh. While the southern powers were digs in there, ÄÂed propelled a night assault, slaughtering a portion of the southern men, yet his powers took numerous setbacks and were compelled to withdraw. In striking back for this intrusion AmlaÄÂ­b and ÄÂed drove attacks into Meath in 861 and 862, yet they were driven off the multiple times. As indicated by the "Fragmentary Annals" this partnership had been solidified by a political marriage: 

In later years, partnership between the Northern UÄÂ­ NÄÅ¡ill and the Vikings of Dublin turned into a customary event: the Northern and Southern UÄÂ­ NÄÅ¡ill were visit contenders for matchless quality in Ireland, and the uneasy neighborhood among Dublin and the Southern UÄÂ­ NÄÅ¡ill made the Vikings characteristic partners for the Northerners. 

MÄÄel Sechnaill kicked the bucket in 862, and his domain in Meath was part between two rulers, LorcÄÄn macintosh Cathail and Conchobar macintosh Donnchada. AmlaÄÂ­b and ÄÂmar, presently participated in Ireland by their more youthful sibling Auisle, tried to utilize this change to expand their impact in the terrains of the Southern UÄÂ­ NÄÅ¡ill. In 863 the three siblings attacked Brega in collusion with LorcÄÄn, and the next year AmlaÄÂ­b suffocated Conchobar at Clonard Abbey. MuirecÄÄn macintosh Diarmata, overking of the UÄÂ­ DÄÅnchada, was slaughtered by Vikings in 863, most likely by AmlaÄÂ­b and his family endeavoring to venture into Leinster. 

Starting around 864 the three siblings ended their battles of success in Ireland, and rather crusaded in Britain. ÄÂmar vanishes from the Irish Annals in 864, and does not return until 870. Downham closes he is indistinguishable to Ivar the Boneless, a Viking chief who was dynamic in England amid this period as an officer of the Great Heathen Army. As indicated by O Croinin "ÄÂmar has been related to ÄÂvarr Beinlausi (the boneless), child of Ragnar Lodbrok, however the issue is dubious". In 866 AmlaÄÂ­b and Auisle drove a vast armed force to Pictland and struck a great part of the nation, removing numerous prisoners. 

The local Irish rulers exploited this nonattendance to battle back against the developing Viking power in Ireland. In 866 various longphorts along the northern coast were demolished by ÄÂed Findliath, overking of the Northern UÄÂ­ NÄÅ¡ill. It is conceivable that ÄÂed was as yet aligned with AmlaÄÂ­b now, and that the longphorts which were wrecked had a place with Vikings not associated with the Dubliners, however by 868 at the most recent AmlaÄÂ­b and ÄÂed were at war. In 865 or 866 a fight was won by Flann macintosh Conaing, overking of Brega, against the Vikings, perhaps in striking back for the assaults on his territory by AmlaÄÂ­b and his siblings in 863. Various further misfortunes for the Vikings happened in 866Ã¢ÂÂ867 when their camps at Cork and Youghal were wrecked, a military was directed in Kerry, two fights were lost against the local Irish in Leinster, and AmlaÄÂ­b's stronghold at Clondalkin was demolished. 

AmlaÄÂ­b came back to Ireland in 867, most likely to attempt to stop this series of annihilations. His arrival is verified in the "Archives of Inisfallen", which notice a "demonstration of foul play" submitted against the congregation of Lismore (cutting edge County Waterford). Around this time his sibling Auisle was killed by a brother, perhaps by AmlaÄÂ­b himself. In 868 another of AmlaÄÂ­b's family was killed, this time his child Carlus, who kicked the bucket fighting at Killineer (close to the Boyne, County Louth), battling against the powers of AmlaÄÂ­b's previous partner ÄÂed Findliath. This fight was a noteworthy triumph for the Northern UÄÂ­ NÄÅ¡ill and is recorded in numerous Irish accounts. In striking back for this thrashing AmlaÄÂ­b assaulted the cloister at Armagh, which was a standout amongst the most essential religious locales belittled by the over-rulers of the Northern UÄÂ­ NÄÅ¡ill. 

In 870 the circumstance of the Vikings was improved by infighting among the decision Irish of Leinster. Another triumph came that year when a formerly obscure "dim outsider" known as ÄÂlfr murdered a lord of southern Brega. The circumstance had clearly balanced sufficiently out for AmlaÄÂ­b to go assaulting in Britain once more: in 870 AmlaÄÂ­b and ÄÂmar (again showing up in the Irish Annals following a nonattendance of six years) laid attack to Dumbarton Rock, the central stronghold of the Kingdom of Strathclyde, and caught it following a four-month attack. The pair came back to Dublin in 871 with 200 boats and they "carried with them in imprisonment an extraordinary prey of Angles, Britons and Picts". 

AmlaÄÂ­b's arrival to Dublin in 871 is the last time he is referenced in contemporary chronicles, yet as per the "Fragmentary Annals" he came back to Lochlann that year to help his dad Gofraid in a war. As per the "Pictish Chronicle", he kicked the bucket around 874 amid an extended battle against Constantine I in Scotland: 

The Viking ocean lord Olaf the White, who includes in a few Nordic adventures, is emphatically related to AmlaÄÂ­b by Hudson. As per Holman, "Olaf is generally related to the AmlaÄÂ­b that is the main recorded ruler of the Vikings in Ireland. The "LandnÄÄmabÄÅk" says that Olaf the White arrived in Ireland in 852 and set up the kingdom of Dublin, firmly comparing to the Irish chronicles' record of AmlaÄÂ­b. AmlaÄÂ­b's heredity as per this adventure is as per the following: 

The "LaxdÄÅla adventure" offers a marginally unique family history, naming Olaf the child of Ingjald, the child of King Frodi the Valiant. Both of these alternatives are hazardous since as indicated by the Irish archives (though the non-contemporary "Fragmentary Annals") AmlaÄÂ­b was the child of Gofraid, King of Lochlann. The adventures distinguish Aud the Deep-disapproved, little girl of Ketill Flatnose, as Olaf's better half, yet the Irish archives name a little girl of ÄÂed Findliath as the companion of AmlaÄÂ­b in one record, and the girl of "CinÄÄed" in another. They additionally differ on AmlaÄÂ­b/Olaf's youngsters, the adventures naming Thorstein the Red, and the chronicles naming Oistin and Carlus. Todd in his interpretation of "Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh" recommends that Thorstein and Oistin are a similar individual, yet later students of history have rejected this because of "the undeniable disparity of their dates". 

A further complexity is that the "Pictish Chronicle" says AmlaÄÂ­b was executed fighting in Scotland, though the adventures state Olaf was murdered fighting in Ireland. Hudson proposes an answer for this evident contradictionÃ¢ÂÂthe Vikings did not recognize the Gaelic people groups of Scotland and Ireland. 

AmlaÄÂ­b's dad is distinguished as Gofraid by the "Fragmentary Annals". He was participated in Ireland by his sibling ÄÂmar at some point in or before 857 and by his sibling Auisle at some point in or before 863. The three are distinguished as "lords of the outsiders" by the "Chronicles of Ulster" in 863, and as siblings by the "Fragmentary Annals": 

The "Records of Ulster" state that Auisle was executed in 867 by "family in parricide". The "Fragmentary Annals" state unequivocally that AmlaÄÂ­b and ÄÂmar were in charge of their sibling's passing: 

A few researchers distinguish Halfdan Ragnarsson as another sibling. This recognizable proof is dependent upon ÄÂmar being indistinguishable to Ivar the Boneless: Halfdan and Ivar are named as siblings in the "Old English Saxon Chronicle". As indicated by the "Archives of Ulster" AmlaÄÂ­b's child Oistin was killed fighting by "Albann" in 875. This figure is commonly consented to be Halfdan. In the event that that is right, at that point it might clarify the purpose behind the contention: it was a dynastic quarrel for control of the kingdom. One potential issue is that as indicated by Norse custom Ivar and Halfdan were the children of Ragnar Lodbrok, though ÄÂmar and AmlaÄÂ­b are named as children of Gofraid in the "Fragmentary Annals". In any case, the accuracy of Ragnar is questionable and the distinguishing proof of Ragnar as the dad of Ivar and Halfdan isn't to be depended upon. 

Two spouses of AmlaÄÂ­b are referenced by the archives. The initial, an anonymous little girl of ÄÂed Findliath is referenced in going by the "Fragmentary Annals" concerning a union among AmlaÄÂ­b and ÄÂed. Somewhere else the "Fragmentary Annals", when revealing the passing of Auisle, allude to "the little girl of CinÄÄed" as AmlaÄÂ­b's better half. It has been proposed that the reference to ÄÂed is mixed up, and that AmlaÄÂ­b's significant other was a little girl of CinÄÄed macintosh Conaing, who had been suffocated by MÄÄel Sechnaill in 851. Another probability is that the CinÄÄed being referred to is CinÄÄed macintosh AilpÄÂ­n (for example Kenneth MacAlpin, which would make AmlaÄÂ­b a brother by marriage of his executioner Constantine I, a child of Kenneth). Two children are noted by the records: Oistin and Carlus, every one of whom is referenced a solitary time. Both kicked the bucket fiercely; Carlus passed on in 868 battling against ÄÂed Findliath and Oistin was "deceitfullly executed by Albann" in 875.
