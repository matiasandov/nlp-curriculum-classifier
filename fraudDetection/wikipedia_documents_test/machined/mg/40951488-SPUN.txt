Skirmish of LogoriÄºÄte 

The Battle of LogoriÄºÄte was battled east of Duga Resa and south of Karlovac, Croatia, from 4Ã¢ÂÂ6 November 1991 amid the Croatian War of Independence, between the Croatian National Guard ("Zbor narodne garde" Ã¢ÂÂ ZNG) and the Yugoslav People's Army ("Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija" Ã¢ÂÂ JNA). The ZNG put the JNA-held LogoriÄºÄte sleeping shelter under a barricade as a major aspect of the countrywide Battle of the Barracks, which meant to bind JNA units detached in their bases and power them to surrender weapons and ammo to the ZNG. In any case, the JNA army broke out from the assaulted sleeping enclosure with part of its put away gear before the ZNG asserted the empty base. The breakout was bolstered by JNA units and SAO Krajina units conveyed to lift the barricade of the encampment and other JNA battalions in Karlovac. A fight resulted as the ZNG endeavored to contain progressing JNA units, finishing with a truce marked in The Hague. 

Albeit the two sides asserted triumph, neither accomplished every one of their destinations; the JNA army emptied the LogoriÄºÄte sleeping quarters, however Croatian safeguards somewhere else held. Especially overwhelming battling was accounted for in the Karlovac suburb of Turanj, recognized as the essential pivot of the JNA exertion. While the JNA expelled a few weapons and gear put away in the LogoriÄºÄte dormitory, the rest of the provisions were evacuated by the ZNG over a one-week time frame after the fight. 

In 1990, after the appointive annihilation of the legislature of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic strains among Croats and Croatian Serbs intensified. The Yugoslav People's Army ("Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija" Ã¢ÂÂ JNA) appropriated the Croatian Territorial Defense Force's ("Teritorijalna obrana" Ã¢ÂÂ TO) weapons to limit obstruction. On 17 August, pressures swelled into an open revolt by the Croatian Serbs fixated on the overwhelmingly Serb-populated regions of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, portions of Lika, Kordun, Banovina and Slavonia. 

After two fruitless endeavors by Serbia (bolstered by Montenegro and the Serbian regions of Vojvodina and Kosovo) to acquire the Yugoslav Presidency's endorsement for a JNA task to incapacitate Croatian security powers in January 1991Ã¢ÂÂand a bloodless clash between Serb guerillas and Croatian extraordinary police in MarchÃ¢ÂÂthe JNA, upheld by Serbia and its partners, approached the government administration for wartime powers and the announcement of a highly sensitive situation. The solicitation was denied on 15 March, and the JNA went under the control of Serbian President Slobodan MiloÄºÄeviÃ¤Â. MiloÄºÄeviÃ¤Â, favoring a battle to grow Serbia instead of safeguard Yugoslavia, openly took steps to supplant the JNA with a Serbian armed force and proclaimed that he never again perceived the specialist of the government administration. The danger made the JNA bit by bit forsake plans to save Yugoslavia for Serbian extension. Before the finish of March the contention raised with its first fatalities, amid the Plitvice Lakes episode. The JNA ventured in, supporting the guerillas and keeping the Croatian police from mediating. Toward the beginning of April, pioneers of the Serb revolt in Croatia pronounced their aim to incorporate the zone under their control with Serbia; this was seen by the Croatian government as an expectation to withdraw from Croatia. 

Toward the start of 1991 Croatia had no normal armed force, and with an end goal to reinforce its barrier the nation multiplied its police power to around 20,000. The power's best part was its 3,000-in number unique police, conveyed in 12 units with a military structure. There were likewise a 9,000Ã¢ÂÂ10,000-solid territorially sorted out hold police, assembled into 16 forces and 10 organizations. The save police conveyed just little arms, and a segment of the power was unarmed. In spite of the fact that the Croatian government reacted in May by framing the Croatian National Guard ("Zbor narodne garde" Ã¢ÂÂ ZNG), its improvement was hampered by a United Nations arms ban presented in September. On 12 September the ZNG was requested to bar all JNA offices it could achieve, starting the Battle of the Barracks. 

In late September and early October 1991, the bar of JNA garisson huts in and around Karlovac and Croatian resistances in the city were kept up by around 900 police and ZNG troops. The troops were doled out to the 110th Infantry Brigade and the under-quality third Battalion of the second Guards Brigade. The 110th Infantry Brigade, at 33% of its arranged quality because of poor association and a lack of weapons, was told by Lieutenant Colonel Rudolf BrleÃ¤ÂiÃ¤Â. 

The JNA's Stjepan MilaÄºÄinÃ¤ÂiÃ¤Â-Seljo dormitory in LogoriÄºÄte, south of Karlovac, was one of the biggest weapons-storerooms in Croatia. The sleeping shelter contained weapons and gear for the eighth Proletarian Motorized Brigade, the 471st Mixed Antitank Artillery Brigade, components of the coordinations unit of the 580th Mixed Artillery Brigade, a reinforced force of the 236th Proletarian Motorized Brigade and 200 tons of fuel and accumulated nourishment allocated to the 944th Logistics Base. Amid the late spring of 1990, an automated contingent of the fourth Armored Brigade was moved from Jastrebarsko to the LogoriÄºÄte military enclosure. At the point when the force was conveyed to Lika in late March 1991, around 40 men stayed at the military enclosure (whose strongholds were improved). The military quarters leader was Lieutenant Colonel Boro Ercegovac, who was additionally boss of the eighth Proletarian Motorized Brigade. 

The first Battalion of the ZNG's 110th Infantry Brigade barricaded the sleeping quarters on 19 September to contain the JNA and anticipate the expulsion of weapons. The barricade was inadequately composed, enabling a couple of tanks to leave the sleeping enclosure and assault a close-by settlement two days after the fact; be that as it may, as per Croatian sources one tank was pulverized amid the attack. To alleviate barred armies in the Karlovac region the JNA redeployed the 169th Motorized Brigade from Loznica and three separations of the TO from VojniÃ¤Â, allocating them to Operational Group 1 (OG-1). OG-1 assaulted Croatian protections on 4 October, achieving the east bank of the Korana River on 8 October. The 169th Motorized Brigade fallen because of insufficient labor, and was supplanted by the ninth Motorized Brigade (got from Serbia) on 15 October. 

As indicated by the JNA an extra 450 troops were conveyed to the encampment (in spite of the barricade) from 22 October to 4 November, essentially tank teams doled out to the ninth Motorized Brigade and two organizations of SAO Krajina TO from VojniÃ¤Â. The fortifications crossed the Korana River, adjoining the military quarters, and their developments prompted a few conflicts. By 4 November, the military quarters housed a 685-in number army. Amid the second 50% of October, the 129th and 137th Infantry Brigades were set up in Karlovac and adjacent Duga Resa to support Croatian barriers. The two new units were allocated territories of duty (AORs) on 29 November by the Karlovac Operational Zone leader, Colonel Izidor ÃÂeÄºÄnjaj; the 110th and 137th Brigade AORs were only south of the LogoriÄºÄte military quarters. The 137th Infantry Brigade was told by Major Nedjeljko KatuÄºÄin. The 110th Infantry Brigade conveyed three organizations of its first Battalion north and west of the LogoriÄºÄte military quarters, while three organizations of its third Battalion were sent south of the garisson huts. Further south, three organizations of the third Battalion of the 137th Infantry Brigade confronted the Korana. The 1/110th Brigade was bolstered by two organizations of police (counting an antitank and expert sharpshooter gathering of exceptional police save troops instructed by Ä¹Ëelimir Feitl) in Sv. Doroteja, north of the dormitory. The 3/137th Brigade was upheld by an extra organization of police. The third Battalion of the second Guards Brigade was requested to redeploy to Banovina; a large portion of its troops were on leave or had left the zone, and just a squad stayed in the back of the 137th Infantry Brigade. 

The JNA fifth Military District direction trained OG-1 to calm barred JNA battalions in the Karlovac and Zagreb regions. Amid the primary phase of the development, OG-1 proposed to achieve the Kupa River by means of Turanj (getting through the ZNG positions) while the second stage assuaged JNA battalions barred in Karlovac. On 2 November OG-1 started big guns assault in the Karlovac zone, constraining the second Battalion of the 110th Infantry Brigade to forsake its situations in Turanj the next day. The relinquished safeguards were involved by components of the detachment's first Battalion. 

On 3 November, the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army ("Hrvatska vojska" Ã¢ÂÂ HV). OG-1 enhanced its requests with guidelines to catch the town of BariloviÃ¤Â and its environment (south of the LogoriÄºÄte garisson huts) to encourage the departure of the sleeping enclosure. Foreseeing the JNA advance, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia trained the Karlovac Operational Zone and the 110th Infantry Brigade to catch the LogoriÄºÄte and Jamadol sleeping shelter and secure ammo for HV (whose stock was waning). BrleÃ¤ÂiÃ¤Â requested the police constrain, told by Feitl, to catch the encampment that night; Feitl won't, and the request was repealed by ÃÂeÄºÄnjaj. The JNA big guns barraged Karlovac amid the evening of 3Ã¢ÂÂ4 November. 

The breakout from the LogoriÄºÄte sleeping enclosure started on 4 November at 7:30Ã¢Â a.m., following 60 minutes in length cannons barrage and airstrikes on brigade and friends order posts. The JNA at the same time assaulted HV resistances at Turanj (further north), undermining Karlovac. The breakout was directed by the OG-1 head of staff, Colonel Mirko RakoviÃ¤Â. 

While the greater part of the JNA army in the LogoriÄºÄte encampment stayed set up, a gathering of 10 to 16 tanks sent south (without huge obstruction) around the towns of Belajske Poljice and Belaj. The defensively covered power experienced Belaj before it was ceased at Gornji VelemeriÃ¤Â and about north of the town of Carevo Selo by components of the second Guards Brigade and the 137th Infantry Brigade. The JNA compel withdrew to Belaj subsequent to losing two tanks, mounting another assault making a course for BariloviÃ¤Â. The four tanks dispatched to BariloviÃ¤Â were likewise halted by 137th Brigade troops before achieving their goal. Before dinnertime the 137th Infantry Brigade was fortified by two organizations redeployed from Generalski Stol and Erdelj, components of the third Battalion of the second Guards Brigade, one tank, three heavily clad staff transporters (APCs) and an antitank rocket framework to contain the JNA advance. Amid the evening of 4Ã¢ÂÂ5 November, the non military personnel populace was cleared. 

An auxiliary power of four JNA tanks, bolstered by infantry, was conveyed from the LogoriÄºÄte sleeping quarters to verify high ground north and east of the garisson huts and secure the flank of the reinforced power in Belaj. As indicated by the HV, propelling troops were met by the second Company of the third Battalion of the 110th Brigade (upheld by a T-55 tank) in Mala Vinica after the JNA compel verified its quick destinations. The JNA lost three tanks and a truck in the conflict. As indicated by them one tank was decimated and another harmed, compelling the staying two to withdraw to the sleeping quarters. The auxiliary power was restricted to inside from Belajske Poljice after the HV verified Vinica Hill, which was assaulted by a Yugoslav Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 at 2:00Ã¢Â p.m. 

The Karlovac Operational Zone did not help the 137th Infantry Brigade, rather guiding subjected units to lift JNA attacks of Slunj and Saborsko and verifying the KarlovacÃ¢ÂÂSlunj street. This incited KatuÄºÄin to demand assistance from Zagreb Operational Zone officer Colonel Stjepan MateÄºÄa. MateÄºÄa, a local of Duga Resa, requested the seventh Brigade of the Croatian to send a force to Karlovac. In spite of the fact that the General Staff endorsed the request (teaching the eighth Brigade of the Croatian to include one of its contingents), no eighth Brigade troops were sent. 

The JNA, cautioned about fortifications to the 137th Infantry Brigade, surrendered its arrangement to progress to BariloviÃ¤Â. It reoriented its endeavors to achieve the Korana Bridge in the town of MaliÃ¤Âi, not far off from Gornji VelemeriÃ¤Â and Carevo Selo (where its tanks were ceased the day preceding). The fight continued in the first part of the day when JNA tanks (upheld by the Yugoslav Air Force, ordnance and numerous rocket launchers) got through positions held by the second Guards Brigade at 1:00Ã¢Â p.m., coming to Carevo Selo before they were halted again by the HV. In no time a short time later, the second Battalion of the seventh Brigade touched base from Zagreb to Duga Resa and were connected to the 137th Infantry Brigade. One organization of the legion was sent to Vinica Hill, and a second was conveyed west of Carevo Selo (where it alleviated troops from the second Guards Brigade). 

The 110th Infantry Brigade allocated auxiliary significance to the battling around the LogoriÄºÄte encampment, since it was attempting to hold its situations at Turanj (where the HV evaluated a two-regiment solid assault was in advancement, with mounted guns and air support). At 5:00Ã¢Â a.m. the Vinica Hill positions were strengthened by the Sports Company (made out of Zagreb University Faculty of Kinesiology understudies) and a detachment of mortars connected to the third Battalion of the 110th Infantry Brigade. The brigade was entrusted with obstructing the LogoriÄ¹ÄteÃ¢ÂÂBelajske Poljice street driving south from the LogoriÄºÄte dormitory and catching Belajske Poljice by early afternoon. 

Since there were just 40 prepared drivers in the LogoriÄºÄte sleeping shelter, Boro Ercegovac requested officers who had never worked military vehicles to drive in a section beginning from the encampment enduring an onslaught at 3:30Ã¢Â p.m. As the segment propelled south towards MaliÃ¤Âi, components of the 110th Infantry Brigade withdrew from the town of Zastinja (on the correct bank of the Korana River). The clearing JNA section continued setbacks, in spite of the fact that it was bolstered by the ninth Motorized Brigade and two separations of the SAO Krajina TO from VojniÃ¤Â. The SAO Krajina TO were later blamed for slaughtering regular people in the territory. 

Amid the evening of 5Ã¢ÂÂ6 November, battling faded away after a truce was facilitated in The Hague. The respite was utilized by the 137th Infantry Brigade to separate its enclosed troops and regular citizens close to the Korana River, east of MaliÃ¤Âi. The JNA segment started moving south again at day break; it came to MaliÃ¤Âi at about 9:00Ã¢Â a.m., crossed the Korana River (over the town connect and a boat connect) by 11:00 and continued to VojniÃ¤Â. In the blink of an eye a short time later, the LogoriÄºÄte military enclosure and its surroundings were verified by the HV. 

The two sides asserted triumph after the fight, with the JNA hailing the departure of the battalion as its most noteworthy achievement. Be that as it may, they accomplished just piece of their targets; the JNA neglected to verify the zone encompassing the military enclosure or expel every one of the weapons and gear in it, and the arranged composed development against Turanj additionally fizzled. Croatian powers bombed in their essential target: containing the army. Regardless, the JNA danger from the LogoriÄºÄte sleeping enclosure was expelled (opening up powers doled out to the barricade of the military quarters) and an extensive number of weapons were caught. 

The 137th Infantry Brigade had 17 fatalities in the fight, and the second Guards Brigade had one. The 110th Infantry Brigade had 14 murdered and 26 injured, yet the detachment supported a large portion of its setbacks at Turanj instead of LogoriÄºÄte. The JNA had 14 dead and 33 injured troops. Furthermore, 14 regular folks were executed and 14 caught and held by the JNA and the SAO Krajina TO. One detainee kicked the bucket in imprisonment, and the rest of later traded. Seven of the traded detainees had been seriously harmed, and passed on not long after the trade. The Central Intelligence Agency evaluated that the JNA lost the greater part of its tanks which had been housed in the LogoriÄºÄte military enclosure. 

The JNA cleared 21 T-55 tanks, nine T-34s, a heavily clad recuperation vehicle, a reinforced vehicle-propelled connect, ten APCs (counting a shielded order vehicle) and 50 vehicles conveying military hardware. Components of the 110th Infantry Brigade entered the LogoriÄºÄte sleeping quarters on the morning of 6 November, expelling a portion of the military equipment in the dormitory before hauling out at 1:00Ã¢Â p.m. in the wake of being educated that the JNA was arranging a big guns assault. Caught gear kept on being expelled from the military enclosure until 13 November. 

The obliteration of property caused shock in Duga Resa, to a great extent coordinated at Nedjeljko KatuÄºÄin (who fled for his life to Karlovac and after that to Zagreb Operational Zone home office on the morning of 6 November). The 110th Infantry Brigade censured the 137th Brigade for all missteps, including the breakout from the sleeping quarters (which happened in the unit's AOR). Izidor ÃÂeÄºÄnjaj additionally accused KatuÄºÄin. Be that as it may, KatuÄºÄin was upheld by the General Staff and was before long selected boss of the 140th Infantry Brigade situated in Jastrebarsko. Indeed, Croatian order and control frameworks bombed (particularly the Karlovac Operational Zone direction, in the prompt region of the combat zone). Interchanges were poor, and the zone direction issued no guidelines to the troops battling close LogoriÄºÄte. The 110th Infantry Brigade was centered around the battling at Turanj, giving little consideration to LogoriÄºÄte, and the 137th Infantry Brigade utilized fortifications conveyed from Zagreb. The JNA order was increasingly compelling, most likely due to the vicinity of its order post on Ä¹Â anac Hill, away (allowing direct perception of part of the war zone). 

Croatian experts charged two previous individuals from the SAO Krajina TO with shooting two HV fighters who had endeavored to surrender to the JNA on 4 November. One of the two was captured in October 2010, and was indicted and condemned to nine years in jail in November 2013.
