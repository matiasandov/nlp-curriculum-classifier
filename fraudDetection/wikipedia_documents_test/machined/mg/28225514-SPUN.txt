Trapalcotherium 

Trapalcotherium is a fossil well evolved creature from the Cretaceous of Argentina in the family Ferugliotheriidae. The single species, T. matuastensis, is known from one tooth, a first lower molar. It is from the Allen Formation, which is likely Maastrichtian in age, and was first portrayed in 2009. The tooth bears two columns of cusps, one at the inward (lingual) side and the other at the external (labial) side, which are associated by transverse edges isolated by profound valleys. This example is reminiscent of "Ferugliotherium", a gondwanathere well evolved creature from likewise matured stores in Argentina, and "Trapalcotherium" is thusly perceived as an individual from a similar family Ferugliotheriidae. Ferugliotheriidae is one of two groups of gondwanatheres, a puzzling gathering without cozy connections to any living warm blooded animals. 

The main known fossil of "Trapalcotherium" was found at Cerro Tortuga in RÄÂ­o Negro Province, southern Argentina. This territory is in the Allen Formation, one of three developments (shake units) that have yielded Late Cretaceous gondwanathere fossils from Argentina (the others are the Los Alamitos and La Colonia Formations). Every one of the three are presumably about similarly old, from the Maastrichtian (most recent Cretaceous, about 71Ã¢ÂÂ66 million years prior, mya) and maybe halfway the Campanian (84Ã¢ÂÂ71 mya). The warm blooded creatures from the Allen Formation are known from seven teeth, six of which speak to four types of dryolestoidsÃ¢ÂÂa gathering of crude vertebrates that rules the Late Cretaceous mammalian faunas of Argentina. The fauna was depicted in a 2009 paper by Guillermo Rougier and partners, who named "Trapalcotherium" just as a few new dryolestoids. The conventional name, "Trapalcotherium", consolidates the name of the bowl where Cerro Tortuga is found, Bajo Trapalca, with the Greek "therion" "mammoth", normally used to signify "well evolved creature" in logical names. The particular name, "matuastensis", gets from Puesto El Matuesto, a shed utilized by the scientistss who gathered the fossils from the Allen Formation. 

The single tooth of "Trapalcotherium" is recognized as a lower molar since it has two longitudinal lines of cusps; as a first molar since it is longer than wide; and as a left tooth in light of the fact that the left side (deciphered as labial, toward the lips) bears a larger number of cusps than the correct side (lingual, the heading of the tongue). The tooth is 2.48Ã¢Â mm long and 2.07Ã¢Â mm wide. Some portion of the back labial corner is absent. 

The lingual line contains three cusps and the labial most likely five (the broken corner renders the number unsure). Transverse edges, isolated by profound valleys, associate the lingual and labial cusps; along these lines, the cusps are not unequivocally separate, but instead intertwined. The lingual cusps are bigger and isolated by bigger valleys than the labial ones. At the front of the tooth is a triangular structure comprising of the principal lingual and the initial two labial cusps. A low peak interfaces the primary lingual to the principal labial cusp and a more grounded peak, isolated from the first by a generally shallow valley, associates the second lingual to the main labial cusp. Behind this structure, a second triangle is framed by two peaks going from the second lingual cusp to two cusps at the labial side (the back of the two is split away, yet its reality is assumed from the crown design). The front of these two peaks is hindered by a depression. The third lingual cusp is additionally associated with two peaks, which encompass a little gloom and apparently associated with at least one labial cusps, which are absent from the fossil. 

"Trapalcotherium" is distinguished as an individual from GondwanatheriaÃ¢ÂÂa little and puzzling gathering of warm blooded animals from Cretaceous and Paleogene of the southern mainlands (Gondwana)Ã¢ÂÂon the premise of the transverse edges and triangle on its crown. It looks like "Ferugliotherium" from the Los Alamitos Formation, the main recently known uncontroversial individual from the family Ferugliotheriidae, however contrasts in certain characters: the triangle at the front is smaller in "Trapalcotherium"; the valley behind the front triangle is less bended; the edges joined to the second lingual cusp structure another triangle; the tooth is generally shorter; "Trapalcotherium" does not have the Y-molded valleys between cusps seen in "Ferugliotherium"; and the tips of the lingual cusps are all the more labially set. The transformative affinities of gondwanatheres, which incorporate the Ferugliotheriidae and the higher-delegated Sudamericidae, are questionable, however an association with multituberculates (an extensive gathering essentially known from the northern mainlands of Laurasia) has over and again been proposed; the recognizable proof of "Trapalcotherium" does not give extra data that has a direction on the connections of the gondwanatheres.
