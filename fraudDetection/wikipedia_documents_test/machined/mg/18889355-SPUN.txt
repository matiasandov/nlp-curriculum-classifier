Tropical storm Rammasun, referred to in the Philippines as Typhoon Butchoy, was perceived as the second hurricane of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). Rammasun was additionally perceived as the third hurricane, the second storm and the main super tropical storm of the 2008 Pacific storm season by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). 

Rammasun framed on May 5 as a tropical unsettling influence. The following day the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a tropical violent wind arrangement alert on the creating aggravation. On MayÃ¢Â 7 both the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency assigned the unsettling influence as a tropical sorrow, while PAGASA named the wretchedness Butchoy. Soon thereafter both the JMA and the JTWC updated the misery to a typhoon with the JMA naming the tempest Rammasun. On May 9 both the JTWC and the JMA updated Rammasun to a tropical storm. The following day the JMA and the JTWC announced that Rammasun had achieved its pinnacle winds of 195Ã¢Â km/h (120Ã¢Â mph) and 250Ã¢Â km/h (155Ã¢Â mph) individually, which made Rammasun a Category 4 super tropical storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. In the wake of achieving its pinnacle force, Rammasun debilitated and was minimized to serious hurricane on MayÃ¢Â 12, before the JTWC announced it extratropical and issued their last warning.

Taking all things together, the tropical storm murdered four individuals, harmed 40 others and caused $9.6 million (2008 USD) worth of harm in both the Philippines and Japan. 

On MayÃ¢Â 4, 2008, a territory of low weight framed in the Pacific Ocean toward the southeast of Yap. The following day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) redesigned the territory of low weight to a tropical unsettling influence and surveyed the aggravations odds of shaping into a noteworthy tropical violent wind inside 24Ã¢Â hours as poor. This was on the grounds that the growing low dimension dissemination focus was frail. From the get-go MayÃ¢Â 6, the JTWC redesigned the unsettling influences odds of shaping into a tropical violent wind inside 24Ã¢Â hours to "reasonable", as the low dimension flow focus had combined further. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was then issued soon thereafter, by the JTWC who overhauled the aggravation's odds of turning into a tropical twister by the following day as great. 

Promptly the following day both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigned the tropical aggravation as a tropical despondency with PAGASA allocating the nearby name of Butchoy to the sadness. As of now the despondency was found 790Ã¢Â km, (490Ã¢Â miles), toward the east of Mindanao in the Philippines. Later that morning the JMA began to issue full warnings on the tropical dejection as gauges demonstrated that the melancholy could turn into a hurricane inside 24Ã¢Â hours. The JTWC at that point assigned the dejection as Tropical Depression 02W. Soon thereafter both the JTWC and the JMA announced that the despondency strengthened into a typhoon, with the JMA appointing the name "Rammasun" to the tempest. 

Rammasun kept on increasing and was assigned as a serious typhoon late on MayÃ¢Â 8. The following day both the JMA and the JTWC revealed that Rammasun had heightened into a tropical storm. Soon thereafter the JTWC revealed that the tropical storm had quickly heightened inside the most recent six hours and had turned into a Category 3 storm on the SaffirÃ¢ÂÂSimpson typhoon wind scale.

The tropical storm then kept on increasing rapidly with the JMA detailing that Rammasun had winds of 160Ã¢Â km/h (100Ã¢Â mph), the JTWC at that point revealed that Rammasun had turned into a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 225Ã¢Â km/h (140Ã¢Â mph).<ref name="JMA Advisory 10-05-2008 00/03z"></ref> Later that day both the JMA and the JTWC announced that the hurricane had achieved its pinnacle winds. The JMA revealed top breezes of 195Ã¢Â km/h (120Ã¢Â mph) while the JTWC detailed that Rammasun had crest winds of 250Ã¢Â km/h (155Ã¢Â mph), making it a classification 4 super tropical storm. Hurricane Rammasun's base weight was authoritatively assessed at 915ÃÂ hPa which tied with Intense Tropical Cyclone Hondo as second most grounded tempest of 2008. 

The JTWC kept Rammasun as a super hurricane until from the get-go MayÃ¢Â 11, when they detailed that the tropical storm had debilitated into a class four hurricane, while the JMA were announcing that the storm had wind paces of 175Ã¢Â km/h (110Ã¢Â mph).<ref name="JMA Advisory 11-05-2008 06/09z"></ref> Later that day the two organizations revealed that the storm had debilitated much further, with the JMA announcing that Rammasun had winds of 160Ã¢Â km/h (100Ã¢Â mph), while the JTWC detailed that Rammasun had debilitated into a Category 3 typhoon.<ref name="JMA Advisory 11-05-2008 12/15z"></ref> The JTWC at that point revealed inside their next warning that Rammasun had debilitated into a Category 2 storm while the JMA revealed that the tropical storm had winds of 140Ã¢Â km/h (90Ã¢Â mph).<ref name="JMA Advisory 11-05-2008 18/21z"></ref> The following day as the Typhoon moved out of PAGASA's territory of duty Rammasun was downsized to a Category 1 hurricane by the JTWC. Soon thereafter the JMA minimized Rammasun to a Severe Tropical Storm while the JTWC downsized it to an extratropical typhoon and discharged their last warning on the framework. The JMA kept on issueing warnings on serious hurricane Rammasun until promptly the following day when they minimized it to an extratropical low.

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) additionally appointed the nearby name of "Butchoy" to Rammasun; the name "Butchoy" was last utilized by PAGASA to name a tropical despondency in the Philippines in 2004 to name Tropical Storm 02W. 

Inside the Philippines, PAGASA issued no open tempest cautioning signals, as the tempest was excessively far from the nation to provoke the issuance of such warnings. In any case, they warned that the tornado was required to upgrade the southwest storm and bring precipitation over Central and Southern Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.
