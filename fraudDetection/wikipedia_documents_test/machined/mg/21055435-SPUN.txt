William de Ufford, second Earl of Suffolk 

William de Ufford, second Earl of Suffolk (30 May 1338 Ã¢ÂÂ 15 February 1382) was an English aristocrat in the rules of Edward III and Richard II. He was the child of Robert de Ufford, who was made Earl of Suffolk by Edward III in 1337. William had three more established siblings who all predeceased him, and in 1369 he succeeded his dad. During the 1370s, he took an interest in a few crusades of the Hundred Years' War, however this period was not an effective one for England. Suffolk was firmly associated with Thomas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick and John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and his placating abilities were exceptionally esteemed in national governmental issues. He mediated in the contention among Gaunt and the parliamentary Commons amid the Good Parliament. In 1381, Suffolk participated in stifling the Peasants' Revolt in East Anglia, after barely getting away from the radicals himself. He kicked the bucket all of a sudden in 1382 while going to parliament, and since he had no enduring kids, his title wound up wiped out and his property was scattered. 

William's dad Robert, the first Ufford Earl of Suffolk, was a nearby partner of King Edward III and a believed military authority in the beginning periods of the Hundred Years' War. His military profession incorporated the Battle of CrÄÅ¡cy, the Siege of Calais and the Battle of Poitiers, where he significantly separated himself. In 1324, Robert wedded Margaret, little girl of Walter Norwich, Treasurer of the Exchequer, extending his officially considerable regional possessions in East Anglia. 

Little is known about William's initial years. He was the fourth child of the family, and as of recently before his dad kicked the bucket, despite everything he had two enduring more established siblings. Thus, his initial memoir depends to a great extent on guess. It is realized that he figured out how to build up a free position for himself through a blessed marriage. By 1361 he was hitched to Joan Montagu, the girl of Alice of Norfolk, and Ã¢ÂÂ through Alice Ã¢ÂÂ a granddaughter of Thomas of Brotherton, a more youthful child of Edward I. The primary recorded proof for his military movement dates from 1367, however he was likely additionally present in prior battles. His dad battled in France in 1355Ã¢ÂÂ6 and 1359Ã¢ÂÂ60, and almost certainly, William additionally participated in these endeavors, alongside Thomas Beauchamp, the future Earl of Warwick. The two men would build up a nearby proclivity, and their professions were strikingly comparable: they were conceived around a similar time, they were presumably knighted together in July 1355, nor was conceived as beneficiary to their earldoms yet went to their titles through the demise of more seasoned siblings, and both succeeded their dads in 1369. 

In the harvest time of 1367, William de Ufford and Thomas Beauchamp were going abroad, likely on a campaign to Prussia. On 4 November 1369, William's dad kicked the bucket, soon after his most established child Robert, who was childless. William, who was currently the beneficiary of the family, was contributed with the earldom of Suffolk before long. As lord of Suffolk he partook in a few battles in the somewhat fruitless phase of the Hundred Years' War during the 1370s, alongside Beauchamp, who had as of late moved toward becoming Earl of Warwick. They escorted King Charles II of Navarre to and from Cherbourg for his visit to England in 1370. In 1372, they were gathered by King Edward III for an unsuccessful campaign to France, and in 1373Ã¢ÂÂ74, they went with the ruler's child John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, on the sovereign's unbeneficial "chevauchÄÅ¡e" from Calais to Bordeaux. In 1375 or 1376, the Order of the Garter was presented on Suffolk. Additionally around this time, the connection between the lords of Suffolk and Warwick was reinforced further. Suffolk's first spouse Joan must have kicked the bucket at some obscure point before 1376, when he wedded Isabel, Warwick's sister. 

Suffolk's association with John of Gaunt was solid, a family association that returned to the seasons of Suffolk's dad. Suffolk's second spouse Isabel had a girl from a past marriage, who was in Gaunt's wardship. This little girl, Elizabeth, who was a beneficiary of Lord Strange, was most likely exchanged to Isabel's family unit at her marriage to Suffolk. The two masters additionally kept up a portion of indistinguishable men from workers, or retainers. At the Good Parliament in 1376, Suffolk was chosen to a panel that would talk about the parliament's complaints concerning the fizzled monetary and military arrangements of Gaunt, who was the "accepted" leader of England. Regardless of his relationship with Gaunt, the parliament confided in Suffolk's lack of bias and correspondence in such a position. After parliament disbanded, Suffolk went to an extravagant supper given by the House of Commons, where Gaunt was obviously missing. 

Edward III passed on in 1377 and was prevailing by his ten-year-old grandson, Richard II. At Richard's crowning liturgy, Suffolk conveyed the new ruler's staff, and he was later named to Richard's minority chamber. Indeed, even after the chamber was disbanded in January 1380, he remained a focal figure at court, taking an interest in the dealings for the ruler's marriage to Anne of Bohemia, and interceding in a contention between John of Gaunt and Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland. 

Suffolk was the predominant tycoon in the East Anglia locale. At the point when the district's laborers revolted in 1381, he turned into a focal figure in their restraint. While in Bury St Edmunds, he was overwhelmed by the revolutionaries while having supper. The agitator chief, Geoffrey Litster, endeavored to compel Suffolk to join the resistance, wanting to loan authenticity to the reason. At the point when this fizzled, Litster swung to other conspicuous men. Suffolk then fled masked as a man of the hour, achieving London by method for St Albans. He before long came back to Bury with a power of 500 spears, and met little obstruction. A significant part of the work stifling the defiance had been attempted by Henry Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, leaving Suffolk to capture the rest of the agitators for preliminary. In the insubordination Suffolk endured monetarily: the laborers ravaged property worth ÃÅ1,000 from his chÃ¢teau at Mettingham. 

On 15 February 1382, Suffolk went to parliament at Westminster Hall. As he rose the stairs to the chamber where the masters had resigned, he tumbled down and kicked the bucket in a flash. As per Walsingham, Suffolk was a pleasant man, much loved by all layers of society, and the updates on his passing was gotten with incredible trouble. Politically, he was a placating individual, and this quality had encouraged compromise in circumstances, for example, Gaunt's contention with parliament or the squabble among Gaunt and Percy. He was covered in his family's conventional entombment place Campsey Priory, an Augustinian abbey in Campsea Ashe, Suffolk. 

William de Ufford's first marriage, to Joan Montagu, brought him huge land possessions in Norfolk. With Joan he had something like five youngsters, none of whom endure him, and his second marriage, to Isabel, was obviously childless. The grounds he had gained through Joan were brought together with the earldom of Norfolk, while his patrimony returned to the crown. As indicated by the late duke's will, a significant part of the Suffolk lands Ã¢ÂÂ however not the title Ã¢ÂÂ slid on the Willoughby family, who were associated with the Uffords through marriage. In 1385, the earldom of Suffolk was reestablished for Michael de la Pole, who got an incredible part of Ufford's territories to help his title.
