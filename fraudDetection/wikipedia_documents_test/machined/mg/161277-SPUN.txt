The Clash recorded the collection at Wessex Sound Studios in London amid August, September and November 1979, after an adjustment in the board and a time of a temporarily uncooperative mind for Joe Strummer and Mick Jones, the band's lead vocalists, guitarists, and lyricists. Considered by faultfinders to be a post-punk collection, "London Calling" mirrors the band's developing enthusiasm for a scope of styles past their punk roots, including reggae, rockabilly, ska, New Orleans R&B, pop, relax jazz, and hard shake.

As right on time as their second collection "Give Them Enough Rope" (1978), the Clash had begun to withdraw from the punk shake sound. While visiting in the United States twice in 1979, they picked supporting acts, for example, mood and blues specialists Bo Diddley, Sam and Dave, Lee Dorsey, and Screamin' Jay Hawkins, just as neotraditional blue grass craftsman Joe Ely and punk rockabilly band the Cramps. This created interest with shake and roll propelled their bearing for "London Calling". 

In the wake of account "Give Them Enough Rope", the Clash isolated from their supervisor Bernard Rhodes. This partition implied that the gathering needed to leave their practice studio in Camden Town and discover another area to create their music. Visit administrator Johnny Green and drum roadie Baker had discovered the gathering another spot to practice called Vanilla Studios, which was situated in the back of a carport in Pimlico. Paving the way to this migration, the band's principle lyricists Mick Jones and Joe Strummer had encountered a time of a temporarily uncooperative mind and had not composed another melody starting with no outside help in over a year; their as of late discharged "Average cost for basic items" EP highlighted a spread tune and three different tunes that had all been composed more than a year sooner. The Clash landed at Vanilla in May 1979 without a solitary new tune arranged for their third collection. 

Once in Vanilla Studios, the gathering started performing spread melodies from an assortment of types, for example, rockabilly, shake and move, cadence and blues, and reggae. Rather than past practice sessions, the band kept these practices private, and did not permit holders on to visit. This withdrawal enabled the band to remake their certainty without agonizing over the response from untouchables, who knew about the band's punk shake melodic style. 

The band built up an "amazingly taught" every day schedule of evening melodic practices, broken by a late-evening social football match-up, which cultivated a well disposed bond between the band individuals. The every day football coordinate was trailed by two or three beverages at a neighborhood bar, which was itself trailed by a second melodic practice session at night. 

The band step by step reconstructed their melodic and songwriting certainty amid these practices amid the mid year of 1979, with the styles of the session's initial spread tunes setting the format for the assorted material that would be composed for "London Calling". The band were likewise empowered by a developing valuation for drummer Topper Headon's drumming abilities, which they understood could be utilized to perform music in a wide exhibit of sorts and styles past punk shake. 

The Clash composed and recorded demos at Vanilla Studios, with Mick Jones making and organizing much out of the music and Joe Strummer by and large composition the verses. Strummer stated "Lost in the Supermarket" subsequent to envisioning Jones' youth experiencing childhood in a storm cellar with his mom and grandma. "The Guns of Brixton" was the first of bassist Paul Simonon's pieces the band would record for a collection, and the first to make them sing lead. Simonon was initially far fetched about its verses, which examine a person's suspicious point of view, however was urged by Strummer to keep chipping away at it. 

In August 1979, the band entered Wessex Studios to start recording "London Calling". The Clash asked Guy Stevens to create the collection, a lot to the terrify of CBS Records. Stevens had liquor and medication issues and his generation techniques were offbeat. Amid a chronicle session he swung a stepping stool and upturned seats Ã¢ÂÂ obviously to make a stone and move air. The Clash, particularly Simonon, coexisted well with Stevens, and observed Stevens' work to be extremely useful and profitable to both Simonon's playing and their account as a band. The collection was recorded amid a five-to six-week time span including 18-hour days, with numerous tunes recorded in a couple of takes. 

The principal track recorded for "London Calling" was "Fresh out of the plastic new Cadillac", which the Clash had initially utilized as a warm up tune before chronicle. "Clampdown" started as an instrumental track called "Working and Waiting". While chipping away at "The Card Cheat", the band recorded each part twice to make a "sound as large as would be prudent". 

"London Calling" is respected by music commentator Mark Kidel as the main post-punk twofold collection, as it shows a more extensive scope of melodic styles than the Clash's past records. Stephen Thomas Erlewine said the collection appropriated the "punk tasteful into shake and move folklore and roots music", while joining a more extensive scope of styles, for example, punk, reggae, rockabilly, ska, New Orleans R&B, pop, relax jazz, and hard shake. "Shiny new Cadillac", the collection's second track, was composed and initially recorded by Vince Taylor and was refered to by the Clash as "one of the principal British rock'n'roll records". The fifth tune, "Rudie Can't Fail" highlights a horn segment and blends components of pop, soul, and reggae music together. 

The Clash's grip of explicit melodic customs for "London Calling" strayed from what Greg Kot saw as punk's rebellious sensibilities. Talking on the collection, Jack Sargeant commented that "whether the Clash totally relinquished their punk roots or pushed punk's melodic mixture and assorted variety into new territory remains a disputable issue." 

The collection's tunes are commonly about London, with accounts including both anecdotal and life-based characters, for example, a black market criminal named Jimmy Jazz and a firearm toting Jimmy Cliff aspirer living in Brixton ("Guns of Brixton"). In the assessment of "PopMatters" writer Sal Ciolfi, the melodies include a course of action of urban accounts and characters, and contact on topics, for example, sex, sorrow and personality emergency. "Rudie Can't Fail" annals the life of a carefree young fellow who is reprimanded for his failure to act like a capable grown-up.

"The Guns of Brixton" investigates a person's jumpy point of view, while on "Death or Glory", Strummer inspects his life by and large and recognizes the difficulties and duties of adulthood. "Darling's Rock" advocates safe sex and arranging. 

A few tunes have all the more generally contextualized stories, including references to the "fiendish presidentes" working for the "clampdown", the waiting impacts of the Spanish Civil War ("Spanish Bombs"), and how steady commercialization had prompted unavoidable political disregard ("Lost in the Supermarket").

It additionally talks about the issues of rising joblessness, racial clash and medication use in Great Britain. As per music commentator Tom Carson, "while the collection draws on the sum of shake and move's past for its sound, the ideas and melodious subjects are drawn from the history, legislative issues and fantasies related with the class".

Simonon clarified in a 2011 meeting with Fender that he crushed the bass out of dissatisfaction when he discovered that the bouncers at the show would not enable the gathering of people individuals to stand up out of their seats; "I wasn't taking it out on the low pitch guitar, cos there ain't anything amiss with it.", Simonon said. Pennie Smith, who shot the band for the collection, initially did not need the photo to be utilized. She believed that it was excessively out of center, yet Strummer and visual planner Ray Lowry figured it would make a decent collection spread.
