New York State RouteÃ¢Â 488 (NYÃÂ 488) is a state interstate in Ontario County, New York, in the United States. It stretches out for from a crossing point with NYÃÂ 21 in the town of Hopewell, close to the city of Canandaigua, to an intersection with NYÃÂ 96 halfway between the towns of Phelps and Clifton Springs. NYÃÂ 488 additionally goes through the village of Orleans, situated inside the town of Phelps. Despite the fact that NYÃÂ 488 is marked as a northÃ¢ÂÂsouth interstate, the greater part of the course pursues an eastÃ¢ÂÂwest arrangement. NYÃÂ 488 was initially assigned as a feature of NYÃÂ 88 in the 1930 renumbering of state parkways in New York. NYÃÂ 88 was truncated to the town of Phelps in AugustÃ¢Â 1972, at which time its previous directing somewhere in the range of NYÃÂ 21 and NYÃÂ 96 was renumbered to NYÃÂ 488, killing a cover with NYÃÂ 96. 

NYÃÂ 488 starts at a convergence with NYÃÂ 21 in the village of Chapin, a little network inside the Ontario County town of Hopewell. The expressway advances eastbound, crossing the Finger Lakes Railway at an evaluation crossing not exactly from NYÃÂ 21. Simply past the railroad, the course makes a slight swing toward the upper east for before bending back toward the east and proceeding crosswise over open farmland. As NYÃÂ 488 crosses the town of Hopewell, it serves a bunch of secluded homes and converges a few northÃ¢ÂÂsouth parkways of neighborhood significance, including County RoadÃ¢Â 47 (CRÃÂ 47). The course proceeds with eastbound into the town of Phelps, where it serves a couple of substantial ranches on its way to the little villa of Orleans, situated on both the western bank of Flint Creek and the option to proceed of the now-outdated Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). 

In the western segment of Orleans, NYÃÂ 488 converges with the northÃ¢ÂÂsouth CRÃÂ 20, which prompts the greater part of the villa's homes. NYÃÂ 488, then, sidesteps the majority of the network toward the northwest as it makes a continuous swing toward the north to pursue Flint Creek and the old PRR option to proceed toward the town of Phelps. Outside of Orleans, the course reenters for the most part country surroundings as it approaches an intersection with CRÃÂ 43. While CRÃÂ 43 travels north toward Clifton Springs, NYÃÂ 488 swings toward the upper east, after the spring and the old rail bed past the vast repository serving the town of Newark. At a crossing point with Trimble and Griffith Roads, the interstate swings back toward the north, coordinating a comparable bend in the stream's directing. NYÃÂ 488 forges ahead, crossing the previous option to proceed of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and passing Midlakes High School on a generally unexceptional stretch before consummation at a convergence with NYÃÂ 96 west of the town of Phelps. 

On MayÃ¢Â 25, 1915, the province of New York let an agreement to improve an interstate interfacing the city of Canandaigua to the village of Orleans to state expressway models. The reproduction of the interstate was 70Ã¢Â percent finished by 1920 and wrapped up by 1926, by which time the thruway was added to the state roadway framework as State HighwayÃ¢Â 1278 (SHÃÂ 1278). The northÃ¢ÂÂsouth interstate associating Orleans to the town of Phelps was modified to state thruway principles as SHÃÂ 1863. In the 1930 renumbering of state expressways in New York, SHÃÂ 1278 and SHÃÂ 1863 turned out to be a piece of the new NYÃÂ 88, which started in the town of Sodus and stretched out southward through Phelps to the crossing point of West Avenue and Main Street in Canandaigua. NYÃÂ 88 was truncated on its southern end to Phelps . Its previous directing from NYÃÂ 21 in the villa of Chapin to NYÃÂ 96 west of Phelps was renumbered to NYÃÂ 488 as a feature of an undertaking statewide to wipe out futile covers, for example, NYÃÂ 88 and NYÃÂ 96.
