Erhalt uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort, BWV 126 

An obscure librettist held four of these seven consolidated stanzas, utilizing the first and the two last unaltered as standard, and extending the third by including content for a recitative. He reworded different stanzas for two arias and another recitative. Bach organized the cantata in six developments and scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-section choir and a Baroque instrumental troupe of trumpet, oboe, strings and continuo. The main development is a chorale rhapsody commanded by the trumpet. In the strange third development, Bach has an alto and a tenor voice substitute for the recitative, while they sing the lines from the third song stanza in a two part harmony. The fourth development is an emotional bass aria, joined by an anxious continuo. Because of the aggregated psalms, the song of the end two stanzas is unique in relation to the one utilized in developments 1 and 3. 

Bach held the situation of "Thomaskantor" (executive of chapel music) in Leipzig from 1723. Amid his first year, starting with the principal Sunday after Trinity, he composed a cycle of cantatas for the events of the ritualistic year. In his second year he created a second yearly cycle of cantatas, which was wanted to comprise solely of chorale cantatas, each dependent on one Lutheran psalm. 

As a component of this cycle, Bach formed "Erhalt uns, Herr, bei deinem Wort" for Sexagesima, the second Sunday before Lent. The endorsed readings for the Sunday were taken from the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, "God's capacity is forceful in the frail" (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the story of the Sower (). The cantata depends on the psalm "" by Martin Luther. At Bach's time, it incorporated the three stanzas of Luther's chorale, trailed by two stanzas of Justus Jonas, Luther's German rendition of (Give harmony, Lord, 1531), and a second stanza to it, rewording (1566). 

The outcome are seven stanzas: 

A line in the epistle, "For the expression of God is brisk and ground-breaking, and more honed than any two-edged sword" (), perhaps provoked the decision of the song. The obscure writer of the cantata content kept stanzas 1, 3, 6 and 7 unaltered, growing 3 by recitative, and revamped 2, 4 and 5 for the separate developments of the cantata. The theme of the gospel is God's statement, as Jesus clarifies in refrain 11, "Presently the anecdote is this: The seed is the expression of God.", which is referenced in the primary line of the psalm, "bei deinem Wort" (near your oath). Rather than relating near the story, the artist focuses on a general solicitation to God: to hold his kin loyal to his pledge, to shield them from foes and to give harmony. 

Bach initially played out the cantata on 4 February 1725, just two days after the cantata , for the Purification of Mary on 2 February. The signature of the cantata is lost, yet the parts which Bach utilized are surviving. The cantata is the third-to-last chorale cantata in Bach's second cantata cycle. 

Bach organized the cantata in six developments. In the common organization of Bach's chorale cantatas, the first and keep going development on the first and stanza of the song are set for choir, as a chorale capriccio and an end chorale. They outline substituting arias and recitatives with the librettist's content. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-section choir, and a Baroque instrumental troupe: trumpet (Tr), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc). The span of the piece has been expressed as 22 minutes. 

In the accompanying table of the developments, the scoring pursues the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time marks are taken from Alfred DÄÅºrr, utilizing the image for regular time (4/4). The instruments are appeared for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing all through, isn't appeared. 

The opening tune, "" (Sustain us, Lord with your statement,), is a chorale rhapsody. A trademark highlight of the instrumental concerto is a four-note trumpet flag, which is gotten from the earliest starting point of the chorale tune, as though to rehash the words "" (Sustain us, Lord) over and over. The theme comprises of the three notes of the A minor harmony in the grouping A C An E, with the higher notes on the focused on syllables, the most astounding one on "Herr". The cantus firmus of the chorale is sung by the soprano, while different voices sing in impersonation, inserted in the free concerto of the ensemble. The Bach researcher Christoph Wolff takes note of that the trumpet show "underlines the confrontational, unyielding character of this late reverential tune of Luther's". 

The primary aria, sung by the tenor, "" (Send Your capacity from above), is a supplication, strengthened by two oboes. In the center segment the words "" (enchant) and "" (dissipate) are shown by keeps running in the voice. 

Development 3 presents two content components joined, the recitative "" (The desire and will of humanity are of little use), and the mixed four lines of the song's third stanza, "" (God, Holy Spirit, commendable Comforter). The recitative lines are sung by exchanging voices alto and tenor, while the sprinkled chorale lines are rendered by the two voices in two part harmony. In this two part harmony, the voice that enters sings the adorned psalm tune, while the different goes with. 

The second aria, "" (Hurl to the ground the pretentious glad!), is emotional, particularly in the anxious continuo. John Eliot Gardiner cites William G. Whittaker: BachÃ¢ÂÂs "upright outrage at the adversaries of his confidence was never communicated more furiously than in this aria". The Bach researcher Alfred DÄÅºrr portrays the development as an "aria of truly elaborate emotional power", communicating "Old Testament energy". 

A tenor recitative, "" (Thus Your pledge and truth will be uncovered), changes the point and prompts harmony, entreated in the last development. 

Development 6 joins the two stanzas from various chorales, Luther's "" (Grant us harmony generous), and Walter's "" (Give our rulers and all lawgivers harmony and great government), in a four-section setting. These two stanzas have an alternate tune. 

The choice is taken from the posting on the Bach-Cantatas site. Instrumental gatherings playing period instruments in generally educated exhibitions are featured green under the header "".
