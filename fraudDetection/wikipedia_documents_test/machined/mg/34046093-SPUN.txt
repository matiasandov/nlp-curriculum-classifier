Soeprapto (investigator) 

Mr. Raden Soeprapto (27 March 1894Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ 2 December 1964) was the fourth Attorney General of Indonesia. Conceived in Trenggalek, East Java, Soeprapto considered law in Jakarta, looking for some kind of employment in the legitimate framework not long after in the wake of graduating in 1920. In the wake of exchanging frequently, in the mid 1940s he had come to Pekalongan and turned into the leader of the court for Native Indonesians. Getting away Pekalongan amid Operatie Product with the assistance of a detainee he had quite recently condemned, Soeprapto advanced toward Yogyakarta and started to fill in as an investigator. At the point when the administration moved to Jakarta in 1950, Soeprapto ran with it. In January 1951, he was chosen to be Prosecutor General of Indonesia, serving until 1 April 1959. 

As investigator general, Soeprapto was noted for attempting state pastors and commanders regardless of them outranking him, a quality which Amir Hasan Ketaren of the Prosecutors' Commission finds lacking from resulting officeholders. He was proclaimed "Father of the Prosecutor's Office" on 22 July 1967, with a bust of him raised outside the Prosecutor General's Office. 

Soeprapto was conceived in Trenggalek, East Java, Dutch East Indies on 27 March 1894 to Hadiwiloyo, an assessment gatherer, and his better half. He took his rudimentary examinations at an Europesche Lagere School, at that point thought about superior to anything schools for Native Indonesians, in the end graduating in 1914. He at that point moved to Batavia (current Jakarta), where he learned at Rechtschool with future state serve Wongsonegoro. 

In the wake of moving on from the Rechtschool in 1920, Soeprapto went straightforwardly to working at the Landraad (court for Native Indonesians) in the place where he grew up. For a long time he worked at Landraad in different areas, incorporating into Surabaya, Semarang, Bandung, and Denpasar. He in the end rose to Head of the Landraad in Cirebon and Kuningan, serving from 1937 to 1941. From that point, he exchanged to the Landraad for Salatiga and Boyolali, at that point to Besuki, before settling as leader of the landraad in Pekalongan. While in Pekalongan, Soeprapto become a close acquaintence with a neighborhood investigator Soekarjo Kario Hatmodjo, father of Hoegeng. 

Despite the fact that Soeprapto had the capacity to lead the court calmly amid the Japanese occupation, after the beginning of the Indonesian National Revolution the circumstance in Pekalongan wound up unsteady. Despite the fact that the beginning armed force had the capacity to hold the harmony amid mobs toward the finish of 1945, when the Dutch started a noteworthy attack on Java, Soeprapto was compelled to escape south to Indonesian-held territories with his family. In this, Soeprapto was helped by Kutil, a man whom he had as of late condemned to death, and Kutil's other hostage assistants. Soeprapto's better half later recalled that Kutil and his men had "conveyed folder cases containing desk work identified with their cases ... what's more, even [Soeprapto's] youngsters, without demonstrating any retribution." Although Kutil and his men got away subsequent to emptying, they were later recovered, with Soeprapto filling in as an observer against them. 

After his getaway from Pekalongan, Soeprapto and his family originally went to Cirebon. They at that point went to Yogyakarta, where Soeprapto turned into a judge at the high court. He later started work as an examiner, rising rapidly through the positions; a few of his colleagues ascribed it to the Kutil case, where Soeprapto showed that he had faith in the matchless quality of law. 

In 1950, Soeprapto came back to Jakarta and proceeded with his work as an investigator. In January 1951, he was picked to supplant Tirtawinata as Prosecutor General of Indonesia. At the time, the examiner general's office was a division of the Ministry of Justice, and all things considered Soeprapto was under the Minister of Justice. 

Amid his time as investigator general, Soeprapto took care of a few prominent cases, following clergymen and commanders that outranked him politically. In 1953, he brought Sultan Hamid II, at that point a pastor without portfolio, to preliminary for his inclusion in the APRA Coup d'ÄÅ¡tat; Hamid was condemned to 10 years in jail by Supreme Court Justice Wirjono Prodjodikoro on 8 April 1953. Soeprapto additionally explored Head of the Armed Forces Abdul Haris Nasution for his contribution in the issue. Different cases incorporated the preliminaries of progressive gatherings and outsiders blamed for undermining the Indonesian government. He additionally managed an expanding number of examiners, drawn from Indonesian graduate schools. 

Notwithstanding, Soeprapto likewise collided with Minister of Justice Moeljatno over the job of the indictment. Moeljatno took the conventional view that the examiner general's office, under the control of the Ministry of Justice amid the Dutch pilgrim time frame, was in a comparable station after freedom; then again, Soeprapto trusted that the capacity of the investigator general was half official and half legal and thusly requested to be responsible just to the bureau. This contention peaked with Moeljatno drafting a bill to expressly make the investigator general subservient to the Minister of Justice, which disregarded in October 1956 overwhelming restriction from examiners and cops. Be that as it may, the bill fell through when the authoritative bureau crumbled in March 1957. 

Following eight years, Soeprapto was decently expelled on 1 April 1959. the rejection has been accounted for in a few sources to be identified with the absolution of/dropping of charges against two outsiders, Junschlager and Schmidt, who had been blamed for undermining the administration; Junschlager kicked the bucket in jail, and Schmidt was liberated on premise of time served in a high court choice which the indictment did not request. As he had not been given earlier cautioning he was unfit to go to Merdeka Palace for the related customs; at the time he was visiting his folks in Yogyakarta. His better half later noticed that this prompted him getting to be baffled in President Sukarno's routine. 

Soeprapto wedded multiple times. He initially wedded Soeratinah of Purworejo, with whom he had a child. He at that point wedded Djenab Oetari of Bogor, with whom he had a little girl. His last marriage was to Soekarti, with whom he had two children and two little girls. He kicked the bucket on 2 December 1964, and was covered at Kalibata Heroes Cemetery in Jakarta. 

Soeprapto was after death announced the "Father of the Prosecutor's Office" on 22 July 1967 by Prosecutor General Soegiharto, which was formally perceived by Letter of Recommendation Number KEP-061/D.A/1967. That equivalent year, a bust of him was set before the investigator general's office in Jakarta. A few avenues are named after Soeprapto, incorporating into Gresik, Malang, and Surabaya. 

Amir Hasan Ketaren of the Prosecutors' Commission expressed in 2010 that Soeprapto was a case of what an examiner general ought to be: firm, learned, and reluctant to permit outside mediation in his examinations Ã¢ÂÂ even from the president. This quality, he stated, was inadequate in resulting officeholders. The next year, Asvi Warman Adam of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences expressed that there presently couldn't seem to be another examiner general like Soeprapto, for Ã¢ÂÂ instead of researching instances of debasement and keeping governmental issues out of the position Ã¢ÂÂ ensuing holders of the workplace had frequently been degenerate themselves.
