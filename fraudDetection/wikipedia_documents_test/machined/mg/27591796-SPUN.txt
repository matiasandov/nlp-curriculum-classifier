Mississippi Highway 311 

Mississippi Highway 311 (MS 311) is a state roadway situated in Marshall County, Mississippi, United States. The course keeps running from MS 7 in Holly Springs north to U.S. Highway 72 (US 72) in Mount Pleasant. The course is a two-path unified street its whole length and goes through rustic zones. MS 311 was assigned onto its present arrangement in 1957, and was completely cleared from a rock street by the 1960s.

The course goes through lush territories with certain homes and organizations as it goes to a crossing point with the Holly Springs Bypass and makes a left swing to proceed toward the northwest and leaves the city. After leaving Holly Springs, the street proceeds through forested zones with some homestead fields and living arrangements. More distant north, the parkway achieves the network of Mount Pleasant. MS 311 passes a couple of homes and organizations inside Mount Pleasant before achieving its northern end at the US 72 convergence. Now, the street proceeds with north as Rossville Road. MS 311 is legitimately characterized in Mississippi Code ÃÂ§ 65-3-3.
