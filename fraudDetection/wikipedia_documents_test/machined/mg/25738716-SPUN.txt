LjÄÅtÄÅlfr is a minor character in the medieval "Orkneyinga adventure", who is indicated to have prospered in the mid-twelfth century. The "Orkneyinga adventure" was ordered in around 1200, and reports the rules of the lords of Orkney. It portrays LjÄÅtÄÅlfr as an aristocrat who lived on the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis. Amid the twelfth century, the Hebrides framed piece of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles. 

The "Orkneyinga adventure" relates how LjÄÅtÄÅlfr was a well disposed colleague of the Viking chieftain Sveinn ÄÂsleifarson, who is one of the significant characters of the whole adventure. The adventure expresses that LjÄÅtÄÅlfr housed Sveinn for quite a while on Lewis, and took in Sveinn's sibling, who was expelled from Orkney. LjÄÅtÄÅlfr's child, Fugl, shows up in the adventure, in spite of the fact that he is portrayed at being inconsistent with Sveinn, until a relative of Fugl's arranges harmony between the two. A few students of history have considered LjÄÅtÄÅlfr to be a progenitor of Clan MacLeod; one of these considered LjÄÅtÄÅlfr to be the eponymous precursor of the clanÃ¢ÂÂalthough the present comprehension of the family's lineage views another man as the eponym. 

LjÄÅtÄÅlfr is a minor character in the "Orkneyinga adventure". He is indicated to have prospered in the mid-twelfth century, and to have lived on the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis. LjÄÅtÄÅlfr has a child, Fugl, another minor character in the adventure, who is additionally portrayed as being from the island. 

The primary hotspot for LjÄÅtÄÅlfr is the "Orkneyinga adventure", which was aggregated at some point around 1200 by an obscure Icelander. The adventure is thought to have been founded on verse, oral custom, and other composed material. It very well may be summed up as a record of the lives of a large number of the lords of Orkney between the ninth and thirteenth hundreds of years. As per look into individual Ian Beuermann, the adventure is helpful not for the particular occasions it depicts, yet rather for what it uncovers about "the thoughts forming the writings amid the times of piece or modification". For instance, it is conceivable that even one of the fundamental characters of the adventure, Sveinn ÄÂsleifarson, never existed, or if nothing else that the chronicled Sveinn contrasted from the adventure's depiction of him. Another source which makes reference to LjÄÅtÄÅlfr is ÄÂormÄÅÄÂ°ur Torfason's seventeenth century Latin history of Orkney, which pursues the "Orkneyinga adventure". 

In the eleventh century, the dukes of Orkney were at the stature of their capacity. The Earl of Orkney, ÄÂÄÅrfinnr SigurÄÂ°arson, likewise managed Caithness and Sutherland, and appears to have controlled the western seaboard of Scotland, and the Hebrides. History specialist MagnÄÅs StefÄÄnsson portrayed the political circumstance of the Hebrides and the Isle of Man amid the eleventh and mid twelfth century as being unsteady, and experiencing the contentions of unimportant rulers and chieftains. In 1079, the Hebridean warlord Gofraidh CrobhÄÄn had the capacity to join the Hebrides and the Isle of Man into a successful autonomous kingdom. In 1098Ã¢ÂÂ9, the Norwegian lord MagnÄÅs ÄÂlÄÄfsson attacked the Hebrides, and affirmed his directly over the islands; he did as such again in 1102Ã¢ÂÂ3. He is thought to have intended to join Orkney, the Hebrides, and the Isle of Mann, under the control of his child. In 1103, MagnÄÅs was killed in Ireland, and no Norwegian lord set foot in the islands for over a century and a half. With MagnÄÅs' passing, the Outer Hebrides were brought back under the control of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, whose rulers prudently perceived Norwegian power. In 1156, the kingdom was parceled following an uncertain ocean fight between the warlord Somhairle macintosh Gille Brighde, and the Manx lord Gofraidh macintosh Amhlaibh: the Outer Hebrides stayed under the control of Gofraidh, yet the Inner Hebrides were managed independently by Somhairle. After two years, Somhairle effectively attacked the Isle of Man, took the honored position, and governed the whole Kingdom of Mann and the Isles until his passing in 1164. 

A standout amongst the most noticeable characters of the "Orkneyinga adventure" is the Viking chieftain Sveinn ÄÂsleifarson, who lived on the island of Gairsay, in Orkney. The adventure relates how Sveinn's dad, ÄÂlÄÄfr HrÄÅlfsson, was one of a few chieftains who upheld PÄÄll HÄÄkonsson, Earl of Orkney, in a triumphant ocean fight against an armada driven by ÄÂlvir RÄÅsta in help of RÄÅgnvaldr Kolsson, who had been selected the baron of half of Orkney by the King of Norway. ÄÂlÄÄfr was later copied to death inside his very own home by ÄÂlvir, the grandson of FrakÄÅkk, an aspiring lady, depicted as a scoundrel in the adventure. FrakÄÅkk endeavored to win the Earldom of Orkney for her descendantsÃ¢ÂÂparticularly ÄÂlvir. 

The adventure relates how in Orkney, Sveinn killed one of the lord's devotees, and quickly fled to the Bishop of Orkney. The diocesan ensured Sveinn by sending him away to the "SuÄÂ°reyjar", into the consideration of HoldboÄÂ°i Hundason, a chieftain on the Inner Hebridean island of Tiree. Afterward, in late-winter, the adventure relates how Sveinn ventured out to Atholl, where he remained for an extensive stretch of time. From Atholl, Sveinn advanced back towards Orkney via land, and on the voyage northwards, he went through Thurso, in Caithness. The adventure takes note of that Sveinn was joined by LjÄÅtÄÅlfr, and that Sveinn had spent a great part of the past spring with LjÄÅtÄÅlfr. The chieftain who inhabited Thurso was a lord named "ÄÂttarr", who is depicted as "a man deserving of respect". Duke ÄÂttarr was a sibling of FrakÄÅkk, and the adventure relates how LjÄÅtÄÅlfr arranged a dÃ©tente among Sveinn and Earl ÄÂttarr, after Sveinn's dad was slaughtered by ÄÂlvir. 

The adventure expresses that Sveinn made various Viking campaigns all through the Hebrides, and into the Irish Sea zone. On one such event, Sveinn set up a base on the Isle of Man, where he wedded an affluent widow. Some time later, Sveinn and his men were assaulted by a power driven by HoldboÄÂ°i, and in result Sveinn left the island and cruised north into the Hebrides to Lewis. 

Further on in the adventure, it is expressed that Sveinn's sibling, Gunni ÄÂlÄÄfsson, had kids with MargrÄÅ¡t HÄÄkonardÄÅttir, mother of Haraldr MaddaÄÂ°arson, Earl of Orkney, Mormaer of Caithness. On account of this association with his mom, Haraldr expelled Gunni from the earldom, and animosity emerged among Sveinn and the lord. Sveinn then sent Gunni to remain with LjÄÅtÄÅlfr on Lewis, with whom Sveinn himself had remained at a before time. The adventure likewise expresses that right now, LjÄÅtÄÅlfr's child, Fugl, was with Haraldr, and subsequently there was a "briskness" among Fugl and Sveinn. The adventure relates that Sveinn stole a ship from Fugl, who had been heading out to Orkney to meet Haraldr. Notwithstanding, in this way a connection of Fugl's, named "Anakol", who turned into a companion of Sveinn, prevailing with regards to making harmony between the two. Student of history Garreth Williams noticed that Anakol's name is Gaelic in inception, and like LjÄÅtÄÅlfr and Fugl, he is depicted as being initially from the Hebrides. The adventure additionally expresses that he was from a decent family. 

Commander F. W. L. Thomas, a nineteenth century savant, suggested that LjÄÅtÄÅlfr was the eponymous begetter of Clan MacLeod. Notwithstanding, today the acknowledged comprehension is that the family's eponymous precursor is another man, Leod, who prospered about a century after LjÄÅtÄÅlfr. Leod's name, and the cutting edge surname "MacLeod", are viewed as eventually got from the Old Norse individual name "LjÄÅtr". This name is gotten from the Old West Norse word "ljÄÅtr", signifying "foul", "revolting", "deformed". The individual name "LjÄÅtÄÅlfr" is made out of two elementsÃ¢ÂÂthe first, "liÄÅt", is gotten from the Germanic word signifying "light", "sparkling"; the second component, "ÄÅlfr", is gotten from a Germanic word signifying "wolf". While the present comprehension of Leod's family line does exclude a man named "LjÄÅtÄÅlfr", the twentieth century group history specialist Alick Morrison thought of it as conceivable that LjÄÅtÄÅlfr could be a progenitor of Leod, but on his distaff side; Morrison even proposed that Leod's name could have been gotten from LjÄÅtÄÅlfr. 

The MacLeods have two primary branchesÃ¢ÂÂ"SÄÅ¹ol Thormoid" (Scottish Gaelic: "seed of Tormod") and "SÄÅºol Thorcaill" ("seed of Torcall"). "SÄÅºol Thorcaill" was the prevailing family on Lewis from the Late Middle Ages until the finish of the sixteenth century. The Gaelic names "Tormod" and "Torcall" are gotten from the Old Norse names "ÄÂÄÅrmÄÅÄÂ°r" and "ÄÂÄÅrketill". Thomas noticed that these names were likewise those of two men with Lewis associations, who are both recorded in the thirteenth century rulers' adventure "HÄÄkonar adventure HÄÄkonarsonar". One of these men was ÄÂÄÅrketill ÄÂÄÅrmÄÅÄÂ°sson, who as per the adventure, was killed close to the Isle of Skye in about the year 1230. Thomas suggested that this man could be a grandson of LjÄÅtÄÅlfr. Another man who shows up in the adventure, ÄÂÄÅrmÄÅÄÂ°r ÄÂÄÅrkelsson, was compelled to escape Lewis, deserting his better half, retainers, and products; as indicated by Thomas, this demonstrates ÄÂÄÅrmÄÅÄÂ°r was an occupant on the island. Thomas noticed that ÄÂÄÅrmÄÅÄÂ°r ÄÂÄÅrkelsson was hitched in around 1231, and on the supposition that every age could be assessed to be 30 years, Thomas gave ÄÂÄÅrmÄÅÄÂ°r's introduction to the world at 1201; his (assumed) father, ÄÂÄÅrketill, at 1171; ÄÂÄÅrketill's dad ÄÂÄÅrmÄÅÄÂ°r at 1141; and this present man's dad at 1111. Thomas reasoned that the senior ÄÂÄÅrmÄÅÄÂ°r would have been conceived at about the time LjÄÅtÄÅlfr prospered on Lewis.
