As discrete state and government examinations advanced, more subtleties rose around an interstate pooch battling ring that included medications and betting. Grisly subtleties of maltreatment, torment, and execution of failing to meet expectations hounds electrifies every living creature's common sense entitlement activists and articulations of open shock.
