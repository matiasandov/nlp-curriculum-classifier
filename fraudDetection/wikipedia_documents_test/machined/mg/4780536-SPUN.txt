The Hindu god Shiva gives a sacrosanct mango natural product, brought by the sage Narada, to his senior child Vinayaka as a prize for outmaneuvering his more youthful sibling Muruga in a challenge. Irate with his dad, Muruga (dressed as a recluse) goes to Palani. He meets Avvaiyar, one of his fans alongside way. Regardless of her endeavors to persuade Muruga to come back to Mount Kailash, he stays determined about his choice to leave his family. His mom, the goddess Parvati, lands there and recounts to the accounts of four of Shiva's celestial recreations to quiet Muruga. 

The primary story is about the opening of Shiva's third eye when he visits Madurai, the capital city of the Pandya Kingdom. Shenbagapandian, the lord, needs to discover the response to an inquiry presented by his better half (regardless of whether the scent of a lady's hair is characteristic or counterfeit), and reports a reward of 1,000Ã¢Â gold coins to any individual who can think of the appropriate response. A poor writer named Dharumi urgently needs the reward, and begins to separate in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, hearing him sobbing, appears as a writer and gives Dharumi a lyric containing the appropriate response. Excited, Dharumi takes the lyric to Shenbagapandian's court and recounts it; in any case, Nakkeerar (the court's head writer) asserts that the sonnet's importance is off base. On hearing this, Shiva contends with Nakkeerar about the lyric's exactness and consumes him to fiery remains when he will not yield. Afterward, Shiva restores Nakkeerar and says that he just needed to test his insight. Acknowledging it was Shiva's will that Dharumi ought to get the reward, Nakkeerar demands Shenbagapandian to offer it to Dharumi. 

The second story centers around Shiva wedding Dhatchayini against the desire of her dad, Dhatchan. Dhatchan plays out a "Mahayajna" without welcoming his child in-law. Dhatchayini requests that Shiva's consent go to the function, however Shiva won't let her go in light of the fact that he feels that horrible will originate from it. Dhatchayini defies him and goes, just to be offended by Dhatchan. She reviles her dad and comes back to Shiva, who is irate with her. Dhatchayini says that they are one; without her, there is no Shiva. He deviates, and consumes her to fiery debris. He at that point plays out his Tandava, which is seen by the Devas, who assuage him. Shiva reestablishes Dhatchayini to life and acknowledges their unity. 

In the third story, Parvati is exiled by Shiva when she is immediately diverted while tuning in to his clarification of the Vedas. Parvati, presently conceived as Kayarkanni, is the little girl of an angler. When she is playing with her companions, Shiva approaches in the pretense of an angler and attempts to play with her. The anglers are agitated by a monster shark who disturbs their lifestyle, and Shiva says that only he can overcome the shark. After a long fight, Shiva curbs the shark (who is the bull divinity Nandi in camouflage) and weds Parvati. 

The last story is about Banabathirar, a reverential artist. Hemanatha Bhagavathar, a capable artist, attempts to vanquish the Pandya Kingdom when he challenges its artists. The ruler's clergyman encourages the lord to look for Banabathirar's assistance against Bhagavathar. At the point when different artists spurn the challenge, the lord orders Banabathirar to go up against Bhagavathar. Realizing that he can't win, the grieved Banabathirar goes to ShivaÃ¢ÂÂwho shows up outside Bhagavathar's home as a kindling seller the night prior to the challenge, and breaks his self-importance by singing "Paattum Naane". Shiva acquaints himself with Bhagavathar as Banabathirar's understudy. Timid at hearing this, Bhagavathar leaves the kingdom promptly and leaves a letter for Shiva to provide for Banabathirar. Shiva gives the letter to Banabathirar, and uncovers his actual character; Banabathirar expresses gratitude toward him for his assistance. 

In the wake of tuning in to the narratives, Muruga understands this also was one of Shiva's awesome recreations to test his understanding; he at that point accommodates with his family. The film closes with Avvaiyar singing "Vaasi" and "Ondraanavan Uruvil", in commendation of Shiva and Parvati. 

In 1965, after the basic and business achievement of "Navarathri" (1964), its chief A. P. Nagarajan and maker A. M. Shahul Hameed met up to make a film entitled "Siva-Leela" (later retitled "Thiruvilaiyadal"). It was propelled by the "Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam", a gathering of sixty-four sixteenth century Shaivite reverential epic stories by Paranjothi Munivar which portray the activities (and shenanigans) of Shiva on Earth in various masks to test his lovers. Sivaji Ganesan and Nagarajan's first cooperation was "Naan Petra Selvam" (1956). That film contained a play where the Tamil artist Nakkeerar goes up against Shiva over a mistake in his ballad (misrepresenting his affectability to good and bad), which established the framework for "Thiruvilaiyadal". 

Four of the "Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam" stories are portrayed in the film. Notwithstanding coordinating, Nagarajan co-created the film (under the flag of Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures) and composed the screenplay. M. N. Rajan and T. R. Natarajan altered "Thiruvilaiyadal"; K. S. Prasad, Ganga and R. Rangasamy were the movie's cinematographer, craftsmanship executive and Ganesan's make-up craftsman, individually. 

Ganesan was given a role as Shiva, and Savitri as the goddess Parvati. K. B. Sundarambal was picked to play Avvaiyar, repeating her job in the 1953 film of a similar name. Nagesh, R. Muthuraman, T. S. Balaiah and T. R. Mahalingam were given a role as Dharumi, Shenbagapandian, Hemanatha Bhagavathar and Banabhathirar, individually, and Nagarajan showed up as Nakkeerar. Other supporting on-screen characters included Devika, Manorama, K. Sarangkapani and O. A. K. Thevar.Singer M. Balamuralikrishna at first needed to go about as Bagavathar, yet Nagarajan won't, trusting that the character fit Balaiah more than Balamuralikrishna and that the previous would most likely act out the character better. Balamuralikrishna concurred, and stayed on the film as a vocalist. 

"Thiruvilaiyadal" was shot on a custom-assembled set at Vasu Studios in Madras (presently Chennai). It was taped in Eastmancolor, in this way making it Nagarajan's first picture to be shot in shading. The discussions among Shiva and Dharumi were ad libbed by Ganesan and Nagesh, and not scripted by Nagarajan. 

Because of his bustling calendar, Nagesh had a call sheet of one-and-a-half days to complete his segment. When he discovered that Ganesan's landing was postponed on the grounds that his make-up had not been finished, he asked Nagarajan whether they could film any performance successions (which incorporated a scene where Dharumi mourns his incident in the Meenakshi Amman Temple). While shooting, Nagesh immediately concocted the line ""Varamaattan. Varamaattan. Avan nichchaiyam varamaattan. Enakku nalla theriyum. Varamaattan"" ("He won't come. He won't come. He will not come. I realize he won't come"). As indicated by the on-screen character, twoÃ¢Â incidents motivated him. One included twoÃ¢Â assistantÃ¢Â directors examining whether Ganesan would be prepared previously or after lunch; one said he would be prepared, and the other said he would not. The other was when Nagesh caught a bystander conversing with himself about how the world had fallen on awful occasions. Naming of the scenes with Nagesh and Ganesan was finished not long after the recording was shot. Subsequent to viewing the scenes twice, Ganesan asked Nagarajan not to evacuate even a solitary edge of Nagesh's bits from the last form, since he trusted that those scenes alongside the ones including Balaiah would be the features of the film. 

"Thiruvilaiyadal" was the main Tamil film since P. U. Chinnappa's "Jagathalaprathapan" (1944) in which the lead on-screen character assumes five jobs in a single scene. Ganesan does as such amid the melody "Paattum Naane", where he sings and plays four instruments: the veena, mridangam, woodwind and jathi. Asked by his biographer, T. S. Narayanawami, about the "Tandava" he performed in the film, Ganesan answered that he just took in the developments vital for the move and adhered to the choreographer's directions. "Thiruvilaiyadal" was the last film created by Hameed, who passed on 20 May 1965, a couple of days in the wake of shooting finished. Neither he nor Nagarajan were acknowledged in the film as makers. 

The film's title is clarified in a basic voiceover. Welcome the gathering of people, it cites Shiva's artistic epic of a similar name. As indicated by the storyteller, Shiva does what he does to test the persistence of his teaches; the god plays diversions, which bring out more commitment in the hearts of his admirers. In this way, the film's title alludes to the diversions played by Shiva. Opening "in medias res", it has a nonlinear account. 

As per Hari Narayan of "The Hindu", "Thiruvilaiyadal" praises the deeds of a divine being (for this situation, Shiva) by delineating supernatural occurrences performed by him. R. Bharathwaj composed for "The Times of India" that the account of the challenge between Hemanatha Bhagavathar and Banabathirar is tantamount to a challenge between Carnatic music writer Syama Sastri and Kesavvaya, a vocalist from Bobbili. Sastri had looked for heavenly mediation from the goddess Kamakshi to crush Kesavayya, reflecting Banabathirar's supplication for Shiva's assistance. 

K. V. Mahadevan made the film's soundtrack and score, Kannadasan composed the melody verses with the exception of the principal bits of "Pazham Neeyappa", which were composed by Sankaradas Swamigal. Nagarajan at first needed Sirkazhi Govindarajan to sing "Oru Naal Podhuma", yet he cannot and M. Balamuralikrishna sang the melody. Each line in the tune is from an alternate raga, including "Darbar", "Todi", "Maand", and "Mohanam". "Pazham Neeyappa" depends on three ragas: "Darbari Kanada", "Shanmukhapriya" and "Kambhoji". "Isai Thamizh", "Paattum Naane" and "Illadhathondrillai" depend on the "Abheri", "Gourimanohari" and "Simhendramadhyamam" ragas, separately. Vikku Vinayakram and Cheena Kutty were the ghatam and mridangam players, separately, for "Paattum Naane". Subbiah Asari made the Macha Veena seen in "Paattum Naane", and the group of "Thiruvilaiyadal" bought it from him for . 

Melodies from the collection, including "Pazham Neeyappa", "Oru Naal Podhuma", "Isai Thamizh", "Paarthal Pasumaram" and "Paattum Naane", ended up mainstream with the Tamil diaspora. Film history specialist Randor Guy, in his 1997 book "Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema", called "Pazham Neeyappa" (performed by Sundarambal) the "most loved of millions". Artist Charulatha Mani composed for "The Hindu" that Sundarambal delivered an "unadulterated and immaculate delineation" of the "Neelambari" raga in "Vaasi", and commended Balamuralikrishna's version of "Oru Naal Podhuma". Mana Baskaran of "The Hindu Tamil" portrayed the collection as an alluring bundle for all audience members. After T. M. Soundararajan's demise in May 2013, M. Ramesh of "Business Line" expressed: "The extraordinary successions from ... ["Thiruvilaiyadal"] ... have perpetually isolated the universe of Tamil music darlings in two: the individuals who trust that the ["Oru Naal Podhuma"] of the swollen-headed Hemanatha Bhagavathar couldn't be bested, and the individuals who trust that Lord Shiva's "Paattum Naane Bhavamum Naane" won the discussion no doubt." He lauded Soundararajan's execution in "Paattum Naane", calling it "stunning". For "The Hindu", C. V. Vasudevan composed that the film "unmistakably displayed the abilities" of Sundarambal, Mahalingam, Balamuralikrishna and Soundararajan and the "making strong point" of Mahadevan. 

"Thiruvilaiyadal" was discharged on 31 July 1965. Amid a screening at a Madras film, a few ladies went into a religious craze amid a scene with Avvaiyar and Murugan. The film was briefly suspended so the ladies could be taken care of. As per craftsman Jeeva, the administration of the Raja Theater fabricated an imitation of Mount Kailash to advance "Thiruvilaiyadal". 

A business achievement, the film kept running for twenty-fiveÃ¢Â weeks at the Ganesan-claimed Shanti Theater. It likewise kept running for twenty-five weeks at the Crown and Bhuvaneshwari Theaters in Madras and different performance centers crosswise over South India, turning into a silver celebration film. It added to Ganesan's string of effective movies. 

In mid-2012, legitimate issues emerged when endeavors were made to carefully re-discharge the film. G. Vijaya of Vijaya Pictures recorded a claim against Gemini Color Laboratory and Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures for endeavoring to re-discharge the film without her organization's consent. In December 1975, Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures exchanged the film rights to Movie Film Circuit; MFC exchanged them to Vijaya Pictures on 18 May 1976. Vijaya Pictures moved toward the Gemini Color Laboratory to digitize the film for re-discharge, yet Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures asked research facility authorities not to discharge the film without their assent. Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures questioned Vijaya's case by running a commercial in a Tamil paper on 18 May 2012 saying that it possessed the film's rights, and any individual who needed to show it in a computerized arrangement should just do as such with their consent. R. Subbiah, the judge who managed the case, requested that the norm be kept up by the two gatherings. 

Energized by the achievement of the re-arrival of "Karnan" (1964), C. N. Paramasivam (Nagarajan's child and the head of Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures) discovered film negatives of "Thiruvilayadal" in a Gemini Films storeroom. Paramasivam reestablished the film and re-discharged it in CinemaScope on September 2012. The digitized adaptation debuted at the Woodlands Theater in Royapettah, Chennai. It got open approval and turned into a business achievement. Maker Ramkumar (Ganesan's child) said about the digitized adaptation, "It resembled viewing another film". 

"Thiruvilayadal" was adulated by faultfinders. The Tamil magazine "Kalki", in an audit dated 22 August 1965, considered the film a triumph for Tamil film. A 28 August 1965 "Ananda Vikatan" survey noticed that since social movies commanded Tamil film, a reverential film like "Thiruvilaiyadal" was a much needed development and merited another review. On 7 August 1965, an analyst from "The Indian Express" refreshing Nagarajan for treating the four scenes adjusted from the "Thiruvilayadal Puranam" with "due worship and regard" and pure Tamil discourse (a "joy to the ears"). Nonetheless, the commentator mocked Nagarajan's "dull" treatment of the angler scene and Ganesan's "cumbersome" signals, which turned what might have been a "great, divine romantic tale" into an ordinary "kid meets-young lady issue". They additionally censured specialized viewpoints, for example, "nervous" shots, the shading plan, Shiva's battle with the shark and the facial make-up. The commentator condemned Ganesan for over-acting while at the same time opining that Savitri had nothing to do, however lauded the exhibitions of Sundarambal, Mahalingam, Balaiah, Nagesh, Sarangkapani, Muthuraman and Nagarajan. On 4 September 1965, T. M.

He noticed that despite the fact that there were time misplacements, for example, phone and broadcast wires unmistakable, "these imperfections pale into irrelevance before the gleam and fulfilling effect of the film in general on the brains of cinegoers." Ramachandran praised Ganesan's execution, his "tandava", the exhibitions of Savitri, Nagarajan and the other supporting performers, Sundarambal's singing, K. S. Prasad's cinematography and Ganga's specialty course.
