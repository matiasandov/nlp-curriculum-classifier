The Bacliff CDP is home to the Kenneth E. Minimal Elementary school and Bayshore Park, made from land given by Texas Genco.

The territory was created as a shoreline end of the week resort, and included parks, lodgings, summer homes, and a bathhouse and outdoors structure based on a dock over the water. Telephone utility came to Clifton-by-the-Sea in 1913, and Grand Avenue (FM 646) turned into the primary road. Storms, Galveston's recuperation after the Hurricane of 1900, and quick transportation decreased Clifton-by-the-Sea's fame. 

The sea tempest of 1915 wrecked a large number of the upgrades to the territory, yet by 1924 the bathhouse and structure had been reestablished and summer inhabitants came back to the network.

After World War II the zone extended as it wound up home for specialists of the close-by petrochemical plants. The extension of the zone required the foundation of a mail station in 1948. The U.S. Postal Service wouldn't permit the name Clifton-by-the-Sea to be utilized because of its length, and the name Clifton was at that point being used by another Texas town, so the occupants picked a similar name as the subdivision at the focal point of business, Bay Cliff, as a substitution. Notwithstanding, the name was incorrectly spelled on the postal administrative work as Bacliff. The new name had just seven letters so it was acceptable.
