In pitching the show to Nickelodeon, maker Stephen Hillenburg initially needed having the characters on an excursion, roused by the 1989 film "Gathering Highway". Be that as it may, he in the end surrendered the thought, and restored it in "Pizza Delivery". The scene got basic recognition, with most media commentators thinking of it as one of the show's best scenes. 

It is shutting time at the Krusty Krab, and Squidward answers a very late telephone call from a client. Similarly as he is going to disclose to them that the eatery is shut, Mr. Krabs all of a sudden shows up and grabs the telephone from Squidward. The client needs to arrange a pizza and have it conveyed, a request Mr. Krabs cheerfully acknowledges, realizing that he could procure additional cash. Squidward dissents this by saying that the eatery doesn't serve pizza nor do they do conveyances, however Mr. Krabs immediately makes a pizza out of Krabby Patties, and advises Squidward to convey it. Regrettably, SpongeBob excitedly demands that he follow along. After SpongeBob completes a couple of "wellbeing checks" of the conveyance pontoon, Squidward makes him drive. Be that as it may, SpongeBob can't drive as he is still in drifting school, however Squidward demands by saying "it's practically around the bend."

All the while, the team experience various incidents: SpongeBob attempts a pioneer trap he professes to have found in a motion picture where he tunes in to the ground and hears a truck with 18 wheels coming. In any case, when he attempts to stand out enough to be noticed by completing a strange move amidst the street, the driver does the direct inverse of ceasing by accelerating and about keeps running over SpongeBob. Afterward, the couple get captured in a vicious breeze storm that in the long run transforms into a tornado, and SpongeBob's refusal to relinquish the pizza makes them get sucked into the tornado.

As they keep strolling, SpongeBob continually sings a melody about how the Krusty Krab pizza is the best pizza on the ocean depths, which irritates Squidward. The two steadily turned out to be drained and hungry, so SpongeBob recommends that they eat coral like the pioneers.

Loaded up with displeasure, Tom cruelly chides SpongeBob, and will not take the pizza or pay for it before impolitely pummeling the entryway in his face. SpongeBob returns to Squidward and crumples to the ground in annihilation and cries (while retaining his tears). Maddened that Tom hurt SpongeBob's emotions by declining to pay for the pizza, all in view of a missing beverage (making the long adventure and the silly obstructions the pair experienced a total exercise in futility), Squidward stands up to Tom, who haughtily says, "Another? See, I told your little companion I ain't payin' for that!" to which Squidward irately guarantees, "Well, this current one's on the house!" He fiercely pummels the pizza into Tom's face as recompense for his discourteousness. Squidward then returns to SpongeBob who, still crushed, asks, "Did he alter his opinion?" Squidward brightens him up by saying, "He beyond any doubt did. Ate the entire thing in one nibble." The two at that point drive back to the Krusty Krab, which is cleverly uncovered to be directly over the road, regrettably, who at that point says "Goodness, my throbbing appendages!" as the screen slices to dark.
