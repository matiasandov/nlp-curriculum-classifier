Dr. Radek Zelenka is a cautious and exact researcher of the first Atlantis Expedition who regularly supplements the logical choices of the "similarly brainy" Dr. Rodney McKay, with whom he has an inviting competition. He much of the time shows up in the control live with McKay and the pioneer of the Atlantis endeavor for interpretive scenes to spread out a scene's reason to the group of onlookers, and is "a key player in helping the Atlantis group remain one stage in front of the trouble makers just as unraveling a portion of its most baffling logical problems". GateWorld's David Read felt that while Zelenka may "play second fiddle to Rodney", he is additionally "the special case who even can possibly put McKay down." Actor David Nykl clarified that Zelenka has "sensibly all around sharpened social abilities" and "can endure a great deal of pressure [...] and a ton of weight, especially from McKay and the circumstances that he can get into", yet he might be excessively engaged and resolved to make one thing done. 

Zelenka repeats in every one of the five periods of "Stargate Atlantis" and is likewise among the "Atlantis" characters to show up in the "Stargate SG-1" hybrid scene "The Pegasus Project". In his first appearance in the early "Atlantis" season 1 scene "Thirty-Eight Minutes", Zelenka encourages devise an arrangement to free Major Sheppard's group including Dr. McKay from a possibly deadly specialized issue. After a first short coordinated effort in "Doubt", Zelenka and McKay are the main impetuses in finding an answer for shield the city of Atlantis from a monstrous sea tempest in "The Storm". 

"Hot Zone" uncovers that Zelenka has been given the ATA quality treatment to empower him to work Ancient innovation, however the treatment had no impact on him. Season 2's "Two part harmony" demonstrates Zelenka off-world out of the blue, where he needs to spare McKay and a trooper from being caught in a Wraith dart. Following a noteworthy question around an exploratory Ancient power generator in "Trinity", McKay apologizes to Zelenka when the test causes the demise of a researcher. McKay spares Zelenka from unavoidable passing in "Tao of Rodney" and later apologizes for so frequently putting him down, conceding that Zelenka is "a splendid researcher and a not too bad individual". Zelenka last shows up in the arrangement finale of "Atlantis", "Foe at the Gate", where he executes a wormhole drive that sends the city of Atlantis from the Pegasus Galaxy to Earth inside seconds. 

From the earliest starting point of "Stargate Atlantis", the makers were searching for on-screen characters to play non-Americans to exhibit the collaboration between various countries and different gatherings of individuals in an outsider situation. Truth be told, in spite of the fact that in the arrangement it is conceivable to see fighters and specialists wearing in their outfits signals that recognize them as Russians, Japanese, South Africans, Belgians, Germans, Britons, Spaniards, and so on, all principle and auxiliary characters of natural cause, with the exception of Zelenka, are Anglo-Saxons: Americans, a Canadian and a Scotsman. 

At the point when on-screen character David Nykl referenced his Czech Canadian foundation amid his tryout for a Russian character for the season 1 scene "Thirty-Eight Minutes", the makers changed the character's nationality to Czech and cast him. Nykl established such a connection, that maker Brad Wright composed Zelenka into the Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) scenes of the following scene, "Doubt". 

Zelenka was re-presented in the mid-season-1 finale "The Storm", Martin Gero's second "Atlantis" scene. Gero had experienced issues with spreading out the perils of the tempest and its answer in a fast and engaging way with simply the McKay character, and Brad Wright was not contradicted to presenting another explanatory character. Zelenka has since often showed up for interpretive scenes in the control stay with McKay and the pioneer of the Atlantis endeavor. Zelenka's given name is first referenced by McKay in the season 1 finale "The Siege"; McKay had recently been unfit to recollect Zelenka's name. The makers picked "Radek", a genuinely normal Czech given name, without contribution from Nykl. At the point when Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) supplanted Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) as the pioneer of the Atlantis campaign in season 4, the makers moved the accentuation of Zelenka's joint effort with McKay to his association with Carter. Before the finish of the show's run, the associations among Zelenka and McKay become progressively inconspicuous to the point where they complete each other's sentences and need less words and articulations to get by. 

Depicting a common character, David Nykl was not under contract and neither knew his number of scenes nor his character's story circular segment ahead of time. All things considered, he showed up in around half of each season's scenes. No scenes with Zelenka were cut in the initial two periods of "Atlantis", and additional scenes including Zelenka were shot in the main scenes of the period 3 to fill time. Be that as it may, all of David Nykl's scenes were cut from the season 5 scene "The Shrine" because of time imperatives, in spite of the fact that Nykl's credits show up in the completed scene. 

Since Zelenka's first appearance, David Nykl's familiar Czech was worked into "Stargate Atlantis" as a component of Zelenka. Roughly 50% of Zelenka's Czech lines were scripted (in English), which Nykl then interpreted verbatim. The other half was promotion libbed and generally included swearing. His typical Czech shouts incorporate Ty vole and Do prdele. Nykl ordinarily talks with a Canadian pronunciation, however Zelenka had a thick Czech inflection; Nykl discovered it progressively difficult to make sure to put on the highlight as the show went on. The late season 1 scene "Letters from Pegasus" includes a moment long non-subtitled monolog in which Zelenka portrays the city of Atlantis in his mothertongue. Nykl interpreted the scripted monolog at home and performed it in Czech the following day. An adaptation in English was at first wanted to be recorded yet was dropped after Nykl's fruitful first take. The finish of Zelenka's video message ("drÄºÅ¾ se milÄÄÃ¤Âku" Ã¢ÂÂ "fare thee well, dear") was advertisement libbed, yet Nykl left it to the journalists to make Zelenka's backstory. In any case, amid the show's run, Zelenka just ever specifies having a sibling, a sister, and a nephew, and is never appeared to be or have been in a sentimental relationship. 

Regularly educating his bosses regarding basic circumstances, Zelenka earned the epithet "Mr. Terrible News" among fans. In a meeting with David Nykl, TheScifiWorld's Gilles Nuytens alluded to Zelenka as a "well known" and "fascinating" character, and thought about Zelenka's spirits in "Atlantis" to those of the "Stargate SG-1" character Walter Harriman, "somewhat like the what tops off an already good thing". Another questioner referenced that, following a "warm gathering", the "fans have truly acknowledged [Zelenka]". Whenever "GateWorld" estimated that watchers were anticipating a scene where the "longshot" Zelenka spares the day rather than McKay, Nykl answered that the set-up powerful gains the character more compassion from the crowd. For his depiction of Radek Zelenka, David Nykl was selected for a 2005 Leo Award in the classification "Sensational Series: Best Supporting Performance by a Male".
