"Scents Like Nirvana" is a farce of Nirvana's melody "Scents Like Teen Spirit", composed and performed by "Odd Al" Yankovic; it was discharged both as a solitary and as a major aspect of Yankovic's "Insane" collection in April 1992. "Scents Like Nirvana" was composed amid a three-year vocation low for Yankovic after the monetary disappointment of his film "UHF", yet caught the rapidly rising prominence of grunge and Nirvana's prosperity. The melody was composed to make jokes about the way that numerous individuals experienced serious difficulties understanding Nirvana artist Kurt Cobain's verses in the first tune. In the wake of being unfit to contact Nirvana by regular methods, Yankovic called Cobain while the band was on the arrangement of "Saturday Night Live", where Cobain rapidly offered authorization to record the spoof. 

Recording the melody was a change for Yankovic and his band. More often than not, the gathering were compelled to record a few overdubs. "Scents Like Nirvana", notwithstanding, was generally direct in its melodic sythesis. To advance the single, Yankovic made a related video for the melody that ridiculed the "Scents like Teen Spirit" video. The satire video firmly reflected the first; Yankovic even ventured to such an extreme as to contract a few of similar performing artists and utilize a similar set. 

"Scents Like Nirvana" was met with basic acclaim and served to re-stimulate Yankovic's profession. Cobain considered the satire as a sign that they had "made it" as a band. The melody is a standout amongst Yankovic's best singles, achieving number 35 on both the "Announcement" Hot 100 and the U.S. Standard Rock Tracks. The melody's video was designated for a 1992 MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video. 

Preceding composition "Scents Like Nirvana", Yankovic's music profession had experienced the poor monetary execution of his 1989 component film, "UHF" and the related soundtrack. Yankovic called that "the start of three years where it was somewhat hard for me to recoup". He began chip away at another studio collection around 1990. To rejuvenate his profession, he considered making a farce of a Michael Jackson melody, which had demonstrated fruitful twice before with "Eat It" and "Fat". He had made a farce out of Jackson's "Dark or White", titled "Nibble All Night", yet Jackson said he was awkward with the satire, given that the first tune was proposed to be a political proclamation. Yankovic would later trust that Jackson's refusal was, by and large, a gift; he felt that "Nibble All Night" was not one of his better works. While he had incorporated other unique melodies for another collection he dreaded the absence of a decent satire tune would fate the collection to disappointment and held off from discharging anything until a thought introduced itself. 

The band Nirvana began to turn into a name in the music scene at the time, making "enormous, seismic moves in popular culture" as per Yankovic. Yankovic felt that the band's 1991 collection "Don't bother", which included "Scents Like Teen Spirit", was "extremely incredible", yet expected that at its discharge the band was not sufficiently prominent to warrant a spoof. By mid 1992, "Don't worry about it" had achieved platinum confirmation and driven the "Announcement" diagrams, which drove Yankovic to begin taking a shot at a farce. Yankovic noticed that a great part of the exposure around "Don't worry about it" managed the powerlessness to grasp the melodies' verses, both in their stating and the way in which they were sung by the lead vocalist Kurt Cobain. Yankovic chose to utilize this as the reason for his farce. Yankovic noted, "I make an effort not to go the conspicuous course constantly, however at times the most evident is really the best." Yankovic had beginning trouble getting consent for the farce, as his supervisor asserted he was unfit to break through to the gathering various occasions. At the point when Yankovic discovered that Nirvana would perform on the January 11, 1992 show of "Saturday Night Live", he called his "UHF" co-star, Victoria Jackson, at the time a customary cast individual from the show. Jackson figured out how to give the telephone to Cobain so that Yankovic could make his solicitation. Cobain concurred, however at first he asked if the melody would be about nourishment, a typical subject in a large number of Yankovic's tunes. Yankovic clarified that the tune would be about Cobain's unimaginable verses, to which Cobain answered, as per Yankovic, "Goodness, beyond any doubt, obviously, that is amusing." 

The tune was recorded around January 27, 1992 at Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. It was the last melody recorded for the collection, as Yankovic for the most part records the tunes that will be discharged as singles last. Recording took somewhere in the range of three and four days. The band attempted to coordinate the equivalent fluctuating beats that were in the first melody; Jon Schwartz, Yankovic's drummer, noticed that "the [drum] part was entirely free. [...] Tempos were here and there. We balanced the rhythms on our melody to meet the Nirvana rendition. It's in no way, shape or form enduring." Compared to past satires, where upwards of 20-a few instruments must be combined, the less complex creation of "High schooler Spirit" made it a lot simpler for the band to finish the melody. 

Yankovic later noticed that recording the tune's vocals was especially troublesome, in light of the fact that he was singing "for eight to 12 hours every day", which caused strain on his vocal lines.

He conceded in a meeting that he woke up "amidst the night" and recorded the expression "bargle nawdle zouss", believing that it would "be critical sometime in the not so distant future."

Yankovic is available on guitar and vocals as Kurt Cobain, with Steve Jay on bass as Krist Novoselic, and Jon "Bermuda" Schwartz on drums as Dave Grohl. Each of the three wear garments and since a long time ago haired wigs to mirror the appearance of Nirvana in "Scents Like Teen Spirit". Yankovic's video utilizes a significant number of similar props, performing artists and camera points; specifically, the video was shot in the equivalent Culver City, California sound stage as Nirvana's video, a few of the team promoters and group of onlookers individuals were from the first video, and Tony De La Rosa repeats his job as the janitor. Levey expressed that they had the capacity to reproduce a great part of a similar setting with assistance of the makers of the first Nirvana video once they knew that the tune had Cobain's favoring. Yankovic had a short discussion with Samuel Bayer, the first chief of "Scents Like Teen Spirit" in anticipation of the video shoot. Despite the fact that Yankovic noticed that "he was surely obliging it", he felt that Bayer was "the least enthused" in light of the fact that "he was a genuine artiste" and was hesitant to see his work mocked. 

The video incorporates performing artist Dick Van Patten in a visitor job. Van Patten, being one of only a handful couple of VIPs that could be come to through prompt contacts, was a very late expansion by Yankovic. Proficient skateboarder Tony Hawk likewise shows up as one of the numerous additional items because of the Birdhouse Skateboards group giving "skater/punks" for the video, in spite of the fact that Yankovic didn't know about this until a 2009 Twitter post by Hawk. Schwartz endeavored to reproduce Grohl's wild headbanging amid recording, abandoning him with a firm neck a few days a while later.

For a while after Cobain's demise, Yankovic would initially play out a solemn tribute to Cobain preceding playing the melody itself. Not long after Cobain's passing, Yankovic was planned to play a show in Seattle, where Nirvana previously ended up renowned. Because of this association, Yankovic was reluctant to play out the satire, as he stressed over how the gathering of people may respond to the farce. In any case, Yankovic was asked by columnists to proceed with the execution, as they said that the melody would be "cathartic" for the region. Eventually, the execution "went over incredibly well".
