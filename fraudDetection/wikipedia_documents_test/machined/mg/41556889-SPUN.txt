Utilizing a trick, Sherlock uncovered Mary's mystery life as a professional killer to John, and each of the three come back to Baker Street to work it out. She educates them regarding her past, and that Magnussen has data on her that would place her in prison for an amazing remainder.

A post-credits scene demonstrates a particularly alive Moriarty inquiring as to whether the gathering of people missed him too. 

The plot is fundamentally drawn from the first short story "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", the eponymous Milverton being a blackmailer adjusted into the character of Magnussen. In the two stories, "Appledore" is the name of the rival's vaults, and, in both, Holmes winds up connected to a worker of the lowlife to obtain entrance. The two stories finish with Milverton/Magnussen's passing, in spite of the fact that in the first story Milverton is murdered by one of his unfortunate casualties. 

The title of "His Last Vow" is a play on the title of "His Last Bow", the last Sherlock Holmes story sequentially. The title isn't clarified inside the scene, yet is a reference to discourse from the past scene, "The Sign of Three", in which Sherlock makes his last pledge to dependably be there for John and Mary Watson. The plot of the scene is irrelevant to the short story, in spite of the fact that there are suggestions present.

In the end exchange of the scene, a story Mycroft educated Sherlock regarding "the East wind" amid their adolescence, is like a discourse from the first story. 

Mary uncovers her actual character in what Sherlock calls "the vacant house", a back street taken cover behind what are obviously the fronts of two houses in Leinster Gardens, in the "house", Mary thinks Sherlock has deceived her by situating a sham of himself toward the finish of the rear way: in "The Adventure of the Empty House" a sham is utilized to trick professional killer Colonel Sebastian Moran in a vacant house. The letters A. G. R. A. seen on the memory stick give off an impression of being Mary Watson's real initials. In "The Sign of Four", the principal unique Holmes story to include Mary Morstan, the Agra Treasure is a principle point of convergence and reason for question. In a similar story Bill Wiggins, a medication someone who is addicted in "His Last Vow", is one of the Baker Street Irregulars. The opening arrangement, in which John goes to a medication lair to recover the child of a family companion and discovers Sherlock too, is gotten from the opening of "The Man with the Twisted Lip". 

As indicated by Gatiss, Mycroft's line, "As my associate is attached to commenting, this nation once in a while needs an obtuse tool" is a reference to a remark by M depicting James Bond, and is planned to propose that the two arrangement share a similar reality. 

In July 2013, it was reported that Danish performing artist Lars Mikkelsen would star as the primary antagonist of the third arrangement of "Sherlock". Mikkelsen first showed up in a non-talking appearance toward the finish of "The Empty Hearse". The depiction of Magnussen was portrayed by Steven Moffat as "unnerving". Mikkelsen was recommended for the job by maker Sue Vertue and recorded a tryout video for the creation group in which he peed in his stable. Mikkelsen was featuring in a film set in East London at the time and had gotten a London emphasize, so he needed to "re-Dane-ify" his intonation. 

Moffat and Vertue's child, Louis Moffat, played a youthful Sherlock in two scenes and Benedict Cumberbatch's genuine guardians, Timothy Carlton and Wanda Ventham, repeated their jobs as Sherlock's folks from "The Empty Hearse". Steven Moffat has remarked that "Sherlock" "keeps running on nepotism".

Nonetheless, he clowned that he was as astonished as the watchers to see Moriarty return, taking note of that it is difficult to counterfeit shooting oneself in the head. Scott showed up in a short post-credits scene conversing with the camera, the two firsts for the show. Moffat has remarked that watchers should hold up "years" to see the goals of the cliffhanger. 

Gatiss and Moffat had considered adjusting the character of Charles Augustus Milverton for quite a while, believing him to be a "splendidly acknowledged" miscreant. Moffat saw Magnussen as Sherlock's "scholarly mirror" and a "novel baddy", and expressed that he experienced passionate feelings for him. The character of Magnussen was initially imagined as an American holding the name of Milverton, however Moffat changed the two his nationality and name when Mikkelsen was thrown. He found the name "Magnussen" on a site of Danish names, searching for one that looked like "Milverton", the name of the first character from Doyle's short story. Gatiss noticed that the character is an "entrancing new spot to go" because of his disparities from Moriarty. At the point when Mikkelsen got the content, he expressed that his initial introduction was that it was "the best content I've at any point perused". Differentiating Magnussen to Moriarty, Cumberbatch expressed that he was "so chilling on account of how genuine he is, the manner by which ordinary he is", and that he is "not made by a distraught, riotous joker's vitality that Moriarty has". 

On the presentation of youthful Sherlock, Moffat noticed that it was the consistent course to take after the presentation of the Holmes guardians: "When you have the guardians in and you have the kin contention and stuff, individuals begin to think, 'well what was youthful Sherlock like?' You simply need those things, you need to see those things, it's a piece of refreshing it." 

Executive Nick Hurran had recently worked with Steven Moffat on a few scenes of "Specialist Who", including the fiftieth commemoration uncommon.

Caroline Frost of the "Huffington Post" considered it a "fitting finale to the arrangement, with authors and on-screen characters all sparing their best for last", regardless of the third arrangement's "sketchy" exhibitions. Serana Davies of "The Telegraph" called the scene "the best of the parcel" and gave 4 out of 5 stars, calling Moffat "the predominant Sherlock author". Despite the fact that her survey was chiefly positive, she addressed whether the program had turned into "somewhat vain, rather a hotshot". Lucy Mangan of "The Guardian" said the scene was "impeccable", and an "unending progression of mind, innovation and knowledge", a supposition reverberated by Ellen Jones of "The Independent", who expressed that it contained "insight, humor and cloud fanboy references in abundance" which "conveyed the merchandise". She proceeded to express that it is "sufficient detail in this scene to supporting watching it over and over, when week by week, until arrangement four". Chris Harvey of "The Telegraph" adulated the "wonderfully done" finish of the scene highlighting Moriarty, saying it was "extremely perky, exceptionally flawless. What's more, exceptionally sudden". Sandipan Deb, writing in Indian paper "Mint", was certain about the scene, calling it "the best" scene in the arrangement, and adulated its "dazzling wanders aimlessly, its exciting overturning of what we have thought about the characters for a lifetime, a passionate profundity not seen previously, and its smart disposable references to the Canon". Deb additionally applauded the "uber-cool true to life strategy", singling out the minute when Sherlock has been shot and tumbles to the floor as a "phenomenal unqualified presumption and true to life bravura". Be that as it may, it was expressed that the essayists were "affected by the sleepy Holmes films coordinated by Guy Ritchie". 

In any case, Neela Debnath, likewise of "The Independent", said that the scene was "making a decent attempt and is going over a touch absurd", and subsequently "neglected to hit new statures". Regardless of this, she praised Mikkelsen as Magnussen, calling his execution "sterling". Jeff Jensen of "Excitement Weekly" disagreed with Sherlock slaughtering Magnussen toward the end, rather than beating him, seeing it as abnormal: "He [Sherlock] had the smarts to conceptualize progressively roused answers for the issue of Magnusson [sic], and the flavoring to oppose a corrupting one". An article in the "Day by day Mail" written by Tom Kelly, guaranteed that the scene was symptomatic of the BBC's "left-wing inclination", contending the scene's lowlife, Charles Augustus Magnussen, was depicted as an entrepreneur, remote conceived paper nobleman, with similitudes to Rupert Murdoch.

The scene infuriated fans as it had expelled the lady who, in Doyle's story, had shot Milverton. After the airing of "His Last Vow", Moffat and Gatiss said in a meeting with Empire Cinemas: 

"Moffat": Also, on the off chance that you read [The Adventure Of] Charles Augustus Milverton, Dr. Watson in the opening passage discloses to you that he's going to let you know a porkie. He says, 'I even now should be hesitant.' I think what Doyle is alluding to is that Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson sat in Baker Street and stated, 'Right, we will need to proceed to murder him, right? That is the main way we can do this.' So they break in, murder him, and afterward Dr. Watson reviews a form of the story that puts the homicide [on somebody else]. 

"Gatiss": They're stowing away in their thief covers behind the drapery, and this arbitrary lady comes and shoots Milverton in the face and after that granulates her heel into his face. It's odd, would it say it isn't? So I mean extremely, it's only an extrapolation of saying, 'Admirably, he presumably did it, I think.' 

"Moffat": If Sherlock Holmes concluded that someone should bite the dust, he would murder them. I don't think he'd have any issue with that. 

"Gatiss": He sees Milverton as a kind of plague, something that ought to be killed. 

Gavia Baker-Whitelaw, writing in "The Daily Dot", said that the expulsion of a female character was "A terrible event that flawlessly fits in with Moffat's reputation with female characters in both "Specialist Who" and "Sherlock"", Baker-Whitelaw proceeds to address whether Mary could have executed Mikkelsen, rather than "playing directly under the control of fans who trust Moffat is a misanthrope who composes the majority of his female characters into a similar corner", and questions whether Moffat is in reality a sexist. 

Steven Moffat's composition, said Emma Dibdin of Digital Spy, is "a couple of degrees colder than his partners'", which helped the scene return to the "cerebral, riddle driven tone a few watchers have been left desiring". Paul Jones, of the "Radio Times", commended Moffat's "excellent, filmic scene", while Daniel Krupa, composing for IGN, said the scene was a notice of "exactly how splendid Sherlock [...] can be".
