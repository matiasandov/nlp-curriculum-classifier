It delivered with iOS 6.0, which gives a stage to various media, including electronic books, periodicals, films, music, PC recreations, introductions and web content. Like the iPad 2 and the third-age iPad, it has been upheld by five noteworthy iOS discharges, for this situation iOS 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. iOS 11, which was discharged on 19 September 2017, does not have support for the fourth-age iPad on the grounds that iOS 11 drops help for each of the 32-bit gadgets. 

It was reported at a media meeting on October 23, 2012 as the fourth era of the iPad line, and was first discharged on November 2, 2012, in 35 nations, and after that through December in ten different nations including China, India and Brazil. The third era was suspended after the fourth's declaration, after just seven months of general accessibility. 

The gadget is accessible with either a dark or white front glass board and different availability and capacity choices. Capacity estimate choices incorporate 16ÃÂ GB, 32ÃÂ GB, 64ÃÂ GB, and 128ÃÂ GB; the accessible network choices are Wi-Fi just and Wi-Fi + Cellular with LTE abilities. 

The fourth-age iPad got essentially positive audits and was commended for its equipment upgrades just as the Retina show, which was likewise highlighted in the gadget's ancestor. Moreover, benchmarks uncover that the fourth-age iPad can perform CPU-dependent errands twice as quick as its forerunner. Amid the main few days of offers, a collected measure of 3 million fourth-age iPads and iPad Minis were sold. 

Bits of gossip with respect to the cutting edge iPad rose soon after the arrival of the third-age iPad. By then some hypothesized that the following iPad discharged would be of a littler size. Further hypotheses developed in July 2012 when DigiTimes, with the assistance of unspecified sources, asserted that Apple made little amendments to the then up and coming iPad and booked its discharge for late 2012.

The gadget includes a 9.7" (inclining) show with a goals of 2,048 by 1,536 (QXGA) bringing about 3.1Ã¢Â million pixels, this gives the showcase a pixel thickness of 264Ã¢Â ppi. The all out number of pixels utilized in the showcase of the fourth-age iPad is multiple times that of the iPad 2Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ giving notwithstanding scaling from the earlier model. 

Similarly as with every single past age of iPhone and iPad equipment, there are four catches and one switch on the fourth-age iPad. With the gadget in its representation introduction, these are: a "home" catch on the substance of the gadget under the presentation that profits the client to the home screen, a "wake/rest" catch on the top edge of the gadget, and two catches on the upper right half of the gadget performing "volume up/down" capacities, under which is a switch whose work shifts as per gadget settings, by and large working either to switch the gadget into or out of quiet mode or to bolt/open the introduction of the screen.
