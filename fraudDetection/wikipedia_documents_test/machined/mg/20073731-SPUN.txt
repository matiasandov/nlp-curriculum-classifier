"U-11" was equipped for up to while surfaced and keeping in mind that submerged at a jumping profundity of up to . She was intended for a team of 17 officers and men. 

"U-11" was outfitted with two torpedo tubes situated in the front and conveyed a supplement of two torpedoes. German Type UB I submarines were also outfitted with an assault rifle, yet it isn't obvious from sources if "U-11"a previous German boatwas fitted with one, or on the off chance that it was, held it in Austro-Hungarian administration.

At the point when "UB-15" torpedoed and sank "Medusa", the tank neglected to appropriately redress, driving the majority of the crew members to raced to the stern to balance the trim irregularity and keep the ship from sinking.
