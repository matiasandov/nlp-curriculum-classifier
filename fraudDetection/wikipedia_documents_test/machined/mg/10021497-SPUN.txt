Lakewood and its abutting network of English were set up in 1908 along an unpaved street to Arlington, which later turned out to be a piece of SRÃÂ 531. The street once stretched out east from Portage Creek to the banks of the South Fork Stillaguamish River, yet this segment was expelled from maps by 1940.

SRÃÂ 531 was assigned as a state expressway amid the 1991 administrative session, however it was not exchanged to state control until April 1992. WSDOT recognized the roadway's two-path bridge over I-5 as a contender for substitution utilizing state subsidizing, however the venture was pushed back a few times during the 1990s. After it was expelled from the fundamental rundown of undertakings under the Nickel Program in January 2003, a natives bunch was framed to campaign chose authorities for the exchange substitution.
