New York State Route 9M 

New York State RouteÃÂ 9M (NYÃÂ 9M) was a state thruway in Warren County, New York, in the United States. It was a goad course of U.S. RouteÃ¢Â 9 (USÃÂ 9) that to a great extent pursued the eastern bank of the Schroon River. The southern end of the course was at NYÃÂ 8 in the town of Horicon close to the villa of Starbuckville. Its northern end was at USÃÂ 9 in the Chester village of Pottersville. NYÃÂ 9M was known as East Schroon River Road and Glendale Road and traversed the southern tip of Schroon Lake. 

NYÃÂ 9M was relegated to what had been assigned as authoritative RouteÃ¢Â 22-c from 1913 to 1921. It went on for not exactly 10 years as it was expelled . Its previous steering is currently kept up by Warren County as a major aspect of three area courses, to be specific County RouteÃ¢Â 55 (CRÃÂ 55), CRÃÂ 62, and County RouteÃ¢Â 64. 

NYÃÂ 9M started at a crossing point with NYÃÂ 8 (presently CRÃÂ 53) north of the village of Starbuckville in the town of Horicon. The course pursued Valentine Pond Road north for an immaterial separation, at that point advanced westbound along the eastern bank of the Schroon River on East Schroon River Road. Over the waterway, Carl Turner Road, a privately looked after thruway, pursued a steering parallel to that of NYÃÂ 9M on the other shore. The two streets step by step bended northward, reflecting a comparable turn in the stream's course. Carl Turner Road reached an end here; be that as it may, NYÃÂ 9M forged ahead. Close to an intersection with cutting edge Short Street, NYÃÂ 9M started to veer off from the stream. 

North of Short Street, NYÃÂ 9M bended back toward the northwest, passing Smith Pond and going through forests as it drew nearer Schroon Lake. It at that point traversed the southern tip of the lake and entered the town of Chester on the contrary bank. The course reached an end instantly a short time later at an intersection with USÃÂ 9 in the villa of Pottersville. 

In 1913, the New York State Legislature made RouteÃ¢Â 22-c, an unsigned authoritative course stretching out from State HighwayÃ¢Â 1023 (later NYÃÂ 8 and now CRÃÂ 53) close Starbuckville to administrative RouteÃ¢Â 22 (present day USÃÂ 9) in Pottersville. The RouteÃ¢Â 22-c assignment was dispensed with on MarchÃ¢Â 1, 1921, as a major aspect of a halfway renumbering of New York's authoritative course framework. In the 1930 renumbering of state thruways in New York, several state-kept up interstates that did not have a marked assignment were allocated one. The previous steering of authoritative RouteÃ¢Â 22-c was assigned as NYÃÂ 9M by the next year. NYÃÂ 9M was brief, be that as it may, as it stopped to exist . Its previous steering is presently kept up by Warren County as CRÃÂ 55 from previous NYÃÂ 8 (CRÃÂ 53) to East Schroon River Road, CRÃÂ 64 from Valentine Pond Road to East Shore Road, and CRÃÂ 62 from East Shore Road to USÃÂ 9.
