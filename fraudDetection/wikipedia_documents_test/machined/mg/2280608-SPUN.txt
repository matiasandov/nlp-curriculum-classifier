It was the third and last single discharge from the collection and was discharged on November 25, 1987 by Sire Records. While shooting for the film, at that point called "Prison", Madonna had mentioned that maker Patrick Leonard build up a downtempo melody that caught the idea of her film persona. She later composed the verses and tune to the sponsorship track created by Leonard, and the tune turned into "The Look of Love". Madonna was likewise roused by performer James Stewart's execution in the 1954 film "Back Window" when composing the melody. 

Highlighting instrumentation from percussion, the tune starts with a low bass synth line and a moderate support track, trailed by Madonna singing the verses.

In 1986, Madonna was shooting for her third film "Who's That Girl", at that point known as "Jail". Requiring melodies for the soundtrack of the motion picture, she reached Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, with whom she had composed and created her third studio collection "Good 'ol fashioned" in 1986. Madonna disclosed to them that she required an uptempo tune and a downtempo melody. She went to the studio one Thursday, as Leonard built up the ensemble of the tunes. He gave over that tape to Madonna, who went to the private cabin and completed the tune and the verses of the melodies, while Leonard dealt with different parts. The uptempo tune created was "Who's That Girl", the principal single from the soundtrack, and the downtempo melody, created and composed the following day, was "The Look of Love". Madonna later changed the film's name from "Prison" to "Who's That Girl", inclining toward the last mentioned. As to improvement of the tunes for the film, Madonna further clarified 

"I had some quite certain thoughts at the top of the priority list, music that would remain without anyone else just as help and upgrade what was going on screen and the best way to make that a the truth was to take part recorded as a hard copy the tunes myself. [...] The tunes aren't really about Nikki [her character name in the movie] or written to be sung by somebody like her, yet there's a soul to this music that catches both what the film and the characters are about, I think." 

Madonna was motivated by the look that performing artist James Stewart gave on-screen character Grace Kelly in the 1954 film "Back Window". Madonna stated: "I can't depict it, yet that is the manner in which I need somebody to take a gander at me when he adores me. It's the most unadulterated look of affection and veneration. Like surrender. It's overwhelming." "The Look of Love" was discharged as the third single from the soundtrack in the United Kingdom, some European nations and Japan. "I Know It", a track from Madonna's self-titled presentation collection, showed up as the B-side. In 1989, the tune was utilized as the B-side for the "Convey what needs be" single discharge.

The tune proceeds along these lines up till the last section, which is upheld by the sound from an acoustic guitar. A two-section vocal is found in the line "No where to run, no spot to cover up". As indicated by Rikky Rooksby, creator of "The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna", Madonna's voice sounds "expressive" when she sings the line "From the appearance of affection" and articulates "look" over the D minor harmony present underneath. The word is sung in a higher note of the melodic scale, in this way giving an impression of the suspension like nature of the minor ninth harmony, separating it from the congruity of different notes. The melody is set in the time mark of normal time, with a moderate rhythm of 80 beats for every moment. It is made in the key out of D minor, with Madonna's voice spreading over the notes C to B. "The Look of Love" has an essential succession of CÃ¢ÂÂDmÃ¢ÂÂFmÃ¢ÂÂB as its harmony movement. 

Rooksby called the melody as "the other jewel" of the "Who's That Girl" soundtrack alongside "Causing a Commotion," and signified it as "an expressive, downplayed track." J. Randy Taraborrelli, creator of "Madonna: An Intimate Biography", remarked that "'The Look of Love' was an intriguing number." Don Shewey from "Moving Stone" said that the melody was "haunting to the point that it would abandon you supposing with respect to where your life is going." John Evan Seery, creator of "Political hypothesis for humans: shades of equity, pictures of death", remarked that the tune depicted Madonna's "control of look". Brian Hadden from "Time" found the melody discouraging. Tiju Francis from "Vibe" stated: "For a such an ordinarily titled tune, MadonnaÃ¢ÂÂs take does at any rate offer something somewhat extraordinary. [...] 'The Look of Love' really seems like piece of the scoreÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ Madonna could well sing over what was already simply the touchy character improvement foundation synth music evidently present in each film in the Ã¢ÂÂ80s. [...] But its moderate consume feel implies the melody is four minutes of not-especially extreme agonizing that never peaksÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ not at all like an anthem."
