New York State Route 321 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 321 (NYÃÂ 321) is a state parkway in Onondaga County, New York, in the United States. The southern end of the course is at a convergence with U.S. RouteÃ¢Â 20 (USÃÂ 20) in the town of Skaneateles. Its northern end is at a convergence with NYÃÂ 5 in Bennetts Corners, a village inside the town of Camillus. NYÃÂ 321 is prevalently a northÃ¢ÂÂsouth interstate; in any case, a bit of the course through the towns of Elbridge and Camillus pursues an eastÃ¢ÂÂwest arrangement. The segment of NYÃÂ 321 in Camillus between Forward Road and NYÃÂ 5 is kept up by Onondaga County as a major aspect of County RouteÃ¢Â 66 (CRÃÂ 66), a course that proceeds with north of NYÃÂ 5 to Memphis. 

Most of NYÃÂ 321's steering was initially assigned as a feature of NYÃÂ 26 in 1924. NYÃÂ 26 proceeded with east to the town of Camillus by method for Forward Road and present day NYÃÂ 174. All of NYÃÂ 26 north of Skaneateles was renumbered to NYÃÂ 321 as a component of the 1930 renumbering of state roadways in New York. It at first covered NYÃÂ 174 from Forward Road to Camillus; notwithstanding, this simultaneousness was disposed of during the 1960s. NYÃÂ 321 was rerouted to pursue Bennetts Corners Road during the 1980s. 

NYÃÂ 321 starts at a crossing point with USÃÂ 20 (West Genesee Street) in the Onondaga County town of Skaneateles. The parkway, at first, travels northward, crossing with nearby lanes in the town. In the wake of leaving the town and entering the town of a similar name, the parkway crosses with the Old Seneca Turnpike (CRÃÂ 133). NYÃÂ 321 proceeds with northward, at that point veers east as it crosses into the town of Elbridge. 

In Elbridge, NYÃÂ 321 converges with a few region courses, including Halfway Road (CRÃÂ 107; previous NYÃÂ 368), a connector thruway prompting the villa of Halfway. Before long a short time later, NYÃÂ 321 swings toward the upper east, heading towards NYÃÂ 5. The expressway crosses Forward Road (unsigned NYÃÂ 931F) simply inside the Camillus town line not long after the turn. Forward Road, a nearby street that goes through a blend of open fields and woods, fills in as a connector somewhere in the range of NYÃÂ 321 and NYÃÂ 174. 

Past Forward Road, NYÃÂ 321 winds up simultaneous with CRÃÂ 66 as support of the roadway shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation to OnondagaÃÂ County. The state assignment reaches an end at NYÃÂ 5 in the village of Bennetts Corners west of the town of Camillus not long after; in any case, CRÃÂ 66 forges ahead. 

The town of Skaneateles was joined during the 1800s to help manufacture expressways in the zone. The thruways that were proposed were to be worked with stone and different materials. Development started in 1911 on an expressway between the SkaneatelesÃ¢ÂÂElbridge town line and the village of Martisco inside the town of Camillus. It was acknowledged into the New York state parkway framework on SeptemberÃ¢Â 17, 1912. An expansion of the street south into the town of Skaneateles to the town of a similar name was developed in late 1912 and mid 1913 and added to the state expressway framework in September 1913. 

At the point when the main arrangement of posted courses in New York were doled out in 1924, the SkaneatelesÃ¢ÂÂMartisco parkway was incorporated as a major aspect of NYÃÂ 26, a course reaching out from Ithaca to Syracuse by method for Skaneateles. North of Martisco, NYÃÂ 26 pursued Ninemile Creek to the town of Camillus, where it met NYÃÂ 5A (later NYÃÂ 5). 

NYÃÂ 26 was part into a few unique courses as a major aspect of the 1930 renumbering of state parkways in New York. The section of previous NYÃÂ 26 between USÃÂ 20 in Skaneateles and NYÃÂ 5 in Camillus was renumbered to NYÃÂ 321. It at first covered with NYÃÂ 174 from Martisco to Camillus. The cover stayed set up until the 1960s when NYÃÂ 321 was truncated toward the southern end of the simultaneousness in Martisco. 

In the mid 1950s, the segment of NYÃÂ 321 south of Forward Road was co-assigned as a feature of NYÃÂ 20SY, a to a great extent exchange steering of USÃÂ 20 among Skaneateles and Manlius through Syracuse. Past Sweets Corners, NYÃÂ 20SY proceeded with north on a formerly unnumbered roadway to NYÃÂ 5 at Bennetts Corners, where it joined NYÃÂ 5 east into Camillus. The NYÃÂ 20SY assignment was evacuated in 1961, leaving Bennetts Corners Road from Forward Road to NYÃÂ 5 as an unnumbered roadway by and by. 

NYÃÂ 321 was rerouted in the late 1980s to pursue Bennetts Corners Road to NYÃÂ 5. This piece of NYÃÂ 321 covered CRÃÂ 66, a parkway that started at the intersection of Forward and Bennetts Corners Roads and finished in the villa of Memphis, and along these lines ended up kept up by Onondaga County. The previous steering of NYÃÂ 321 along Forward Road is currently assigned as NYÃÂ 931F, an unsigned reference course long.
