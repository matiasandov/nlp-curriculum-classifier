A solitary piece of information, "Daemonicus", is forgotten spelled on a Scrabble board the exploited people had been playing before being assaulted. At the point when Reyes professes to have felt the nearness of malice, Doggett reacts with incredible disturbance. Dr. Monique Sampson calls them, saying that the killings might be associated with a got away mental patient, Dr. Kenneth Richman, and a watchman, Paul Gerlach. 

In the interim, in a lush zone, the two culprits, both wearing evil spirit veils, face each other exactly twenty paces separated. One of the culprits raises his weapon and shoots the other. At the psychological foundation, the two operators talk with Josef Kobold (James Remar), the neighboring patient of Richman. The appropriate responses Kobold gives are disrupting for the operators, as he says that one of the culprits has executed once more, demonstrating to them the area and cautioning them of "something awful" occurring there. After the dead culprit's body is recuperated, Scully plays out a post-mortem and finds that the body has a place with Gerlach. 

The specialists approach Kobold for help finding the rest of the culprit. When addressing Kobold, he all of a sudden talks in a bizarre in reverse murmuring and ejects in spasms.

That the "devils" point was only to get the X-records' association and that they were all completely "checkmated" by Kodold.

"Daemonicus" is the primary Monster-of-the-Week scene of season nine, which means an independent scene detached to the arrangement's more extensive folklore; as season nine was advanced as the "new" "X-Files", it was critical to grow new settings for the show. One of these new settings was to move Dana Scully from the X-Files office to the FBI Academy at Quantico. The scenes at the FBI Academy were shot at an address corridor at UCLA.

The completed scene contains a few arrangements of Josef Kobold regurgitating. Spotnitz had not expected the completed item to highlight every one of the shots yet the manager around then, Chris Cooke, "cut it that way." Spotnitz felt that it "was so totally absurd."

Zack Handlen of "The A.V. Club" gave the scene a "CÃ¢ÂÂ" and composed that while the scene had a great deal of abhorrent minutes, for example, the bodies with snakes within them and the gristly killings, the "winding structure, over-accentuated bleakness, and stifling pace render these components inactive".
