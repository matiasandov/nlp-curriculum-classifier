John Komnenos Asen 

John Komnenos Asen (, "Yoan Komnin Asen"; , "IÄºÂannÃ¤Âs KomnÃ¤Ânos AsanÃ¤Âs"; , "Jovan Komnin Asen") was the leader of the Principality of Valona from around 1345 to 1363, at first as a Serbian vassal and after 1355 as a to a great extent free ruler. Slipped from high-positioning Bulgarian honorability, John was a sibling of both Tsar Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria and Helena of Bulgaria, the spouse of Tsar Stephen DuÄºÄan of Serbia. Maybe looking for better chances, he emigrated to Serbia, where his sister was hitched. There, he was allowed the title of dictator by Stephen DuÄºÄan, who put him responsible for his domains in current south Albania. 

As the autocrat of Valona, John built up business ties with Venice and Ragusa, and he turned into a native of the previous in 1353. After the demise of DuÄºÄan in 1355, he took the side of the ineffective Simeon UroÄºÄ in the resulting strife for the Serbian position of royalty. With Venetian help, John kept up the basically autonomous status of the Principality of Valona. He presumably passed on of the plague in 1363 and he was prevailing by Alexander Komnenos Asen, who was likely his child from his obscure first spouse. John's second marriage was to the previous Epirote ruler associate Anna Palaiologina. 

While the birth date of John Komnenos Asen is obscure, his starting point is plainly reported in the sources. On the two sides, he slid from the most astounding positions of fourteenth century Bulgarian honorability. He was destined to Keratsa Petritsa, a little girl of autocrat Shishman of Vidin, and Sratsimir, the tyrant of Kran. John's mom was a relative of the Asen line as a great granddaughter of Tsar Ivan Asen II. His kin were Ivan Alexander, who might climb to the Bulgarian position of authority in 1331, and Helena, who wedded Serbian ruler Stephen DuÄºÄan in 1332. Despite the fact that John was regularly alluded to as a Komnenos in the sources, his relations to that Byzantine family are somewhat rare. He had rights to that name either through his mom's drop from the Asens, themselves identified with the Komnenoi, or through his marriage to Anna Palaiologina. 

It is unsure as to precisely why John emigrated to Serbia as opposed to expecting a high-positioning position in Bulgaria, as his lineage and family ties would propose. Bulgarian student of history Ivan Bozhilov is of the supposition that John was not looking for political asylum in Serbia. Rather, all things considered, he moved to that nation with the conviction that Serbia's regional development and political impact in that period would verify him better vocation openings. Probably, John went with his sister Helena when she moved to Serbia to wed Stephen DuÄºÄan in 1332. 

John was first referenced as the dictator of Valona in 1350 and his archived nearness in the Albanian grounds just dates to 1349. In any case, he was probably presented the title as ahead of schedule as 1345 or 1346, when Stephen DuÄºÄan was broadcasted Emperor (Tsar). American researcher John Fine trusts this happened following Stephen DuÄºÄan's crowning liturgy in 1346. Alongside Stephen DuÄºÄan's stepbrother, Simeon UroÄºÄ, and Jovan Oliver, John was one of three individuals to endure that title under Stephen DuÄºÄan. 

John was introduced as leader of Valona in late 1345, in the wake of the Serbian victory of south Albania from the Byzantine Empire, which was finished up no later than August 1345. Other than the Adriatic port of Valona (present day VlorÄÅ¥), John's appanage included adjacent Kanina and the inland mansion of Berat toward the upper east. Other than that, the degree of his area is unsure. Assessments of the region John controlled over range from all of focal Albania to just the three urban areas referenced, with the rest staying under the legislature of nearby Albanian respectability, who owed devotion either to John or to Stephen DuÄºÄan legitimately. Toward the south, John's appanage verged on the grounds of Simeon UroÄºÄ, the leader of Epirus. 

In 1349, John ravaged a Venetian business dispatch which had been wrecked on the coast he controlled, as per the medieval guideline of "jus naufragii". This demonstration required the inclusion of Stephen DuÄºÄan so as to settle the question among Venice and John, as prove by an official archive from 13 April 1350. In spite of this contention, under John the Principality of Valona was a functioning accomplice of Venice and Ragusa (present day Dubrovnik) in oceanic trade. Two receipts from 27 April 1350 record John's job as a middle person in cows, sugar and pepper exchange and uncover that he got huge pay from the Valona traditions. The traditions was productive on the grounds that the port was regularly visited by vendor ships. Despite the fact that these reports were written in Slavic, John marked his name in Greek, which vouches for his Hellenisation. At the time, John likewise had ties with the Mamluk leaders of Egypt, who tended to him as Ã¢ÂÂKing of Serbia and BulgariaÃ¢ÂÂ in correspondence. 

In 1353, John and his family were conceded Venetian citizenship, which indicates that his space was under the security of Venice. The unexpected passing of Stephen DuÄºÄan in 1355 dove the Serbian Empire into common war. In that contention, John took the side of his significant other's child in-law Simeon UroÄºÄ against the genuine successor Stephen UroÄºÄ, who was Stephen DuÄºÄan's child and Simeon UroÄºÄ's nephew. While Simeon's endeavor at taking the position of royalty was doomed and Stephen UroÄºÄ even caught Berat in 1356, John figured out how to safeguard his residual terrains and wound up autonomous from both Simeon and Stephen UroÄºÄ. The risk of Nikephoros II Orsini, who was making strides in Thessaly and Epirus, constrained John to demand the dispatch of a Venetian warship and a head from Venice to assume responsibility for his space, to which the republic obliged. 

Bulgarian student of history Hristo Matanov guesses that after 1355, John may have stamped his own coinage proposed for exchange with accomplices outside the internal Balkans. He puts together this hypothesis with respect to another perusing of a few Latin-language coin engravings as "Monita despoti Ioanni" rather than "Monita despoti Oliveri", as recently thought. The new perusing, which would recognize the coins as being stamped by John, was proposed by Yugoslav numismatist NedeljkoviÃ¤Â, who rejects the underlying attribution of these coins to Jovan Oliver. 

A business report from 30 January 1359, which vouches for John's proceeding with exchange relations with Venice, is sequentially the last reference to his movement in contemporary sources. While the date of his demise was not recorded, all things considered, John died amid the plague pandemic which hit Valona and Durazzo (today DurrÄÅ¥s) in 1363. 

John's first marriage presumably dates to after his entry in Serbia, however the character of his first spouse, assuming any, is obscure. On the off chance that the following leader of Valona, Alexander Komnenos Asen, was his child, at that point he would have been conceived around 1346Ã¢ÂÂ1348, as he was at that point a grown-up in 1363Ã¢ÂÂ1366. This would put John's potential first marriage a couple of years before Alexander's assessed birth. Around 1350Ã¢ÂÂ1355, John wedded Anna Palaiologina, a granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and a widow of John II Orsini, the tyrant of Epirus. This marriage to an Epirote aristocrat combined and legitimized John's situation in the locale. Other than Alexander, another all around likely offspring of John Komnenos Asen was a sure Komnena, the spouse of BalÄºÄa II who had succeeded Alexander as leader of Valona in mid 1372.
