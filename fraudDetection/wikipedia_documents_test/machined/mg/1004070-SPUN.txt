TvrÃ¤Âa 

TvrÃ¤Âa ("Citadel") is the Old Town of the city of Osijek in Croatia. It is the best-safeguarded and biggest troupe of Baroque structures in Croatia and comprises of a Habsburg star fortification based on the correct bank of the River Drava. TvrÃ¤Âa has been depicted by the World Monuments Fund as "an interesting case of an eighteenth-century florid military, regulatory, and business urban focus". 

The star fortress was developed in the prompt region of medieval Osijek after the annihilation of the Ottoman powers in 1687, because of Osijek's key significance. Developed beginning in 1712 to plans by Mathias von Kaiserfeld and afterward Maximilian Gosseau de Henef, every one of the five arranged bastions and two doors were finished by 1715. By 1735, the inward town was done and three northern bastions had been included. Whenever complete, it was the biggest and most progressive Habsburg fortification on the fringe with the Ottoman Empire, comprising of eight bastions and highlighting ordnances, warehouses, a battalion home office, military court, development office, an army doctor, guardhouse, officers' condos, a military clinic and seven sleeping enclosure. The finished fortress was completely encompassed with dividers and palisades and had four principle doors at each side (north, south, east, west). TvrÃ¤Âa had road lights by 1717 and was the site of the main open water supply in Croatia, opened in 1751. 

TvrÃ¤Âa's military significance diminished after the Berlin Congress of 1878, with the expanding security of the encompassing district. A large portion of the fortress dividers and strongholds were devastated during the 1920s because of the obstruction they introduced to the improvement of Osijek. While the fortresses have to a great extent been evacuated, the post's inside center stays unblemished and is currently home to places of worship, exhibition halls, schools and other open structures, just as various bars and eateries. Of the stronghold framework, just the northern side of the dividers presently stay flawless, just as parts of the first and eighth bastions alongside the northern door known as the 'water entryway' ('vodena vrata'). TvrÃ¤Âa continued huge harm amid the Croatian War of Independence amid the 1990s and was highlighted on the 1996 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites. It currently includes on Croatia's 'conditional rundown' for thought as a chosen one for a World Heritage Site. 

The new name of Osijek first showed up in 1196. The focal point of medieval Osijek was on the banks of the River Drava where TvrÃ¤Âa now stands. The town was an exchange and port settlement from the mid twelfth century because of its situation in transit from PÄÅ¡cs and Buda southwards. The site was home to the Romanesque church of the Holy Trinity. Somewhere in the range of 1526 and 1687 Osijek was administered by the Ottomans, who did not change the format of the settlement in any generous manner however presented Islamic spots of love, giving the zone an Oriental appearance. Hints of medieval and Ottoman towns stay right up 'til the present time, including a remainder of the old Ottoman post divider, referred to today as the "Turkish Wall" () or "Filibey's Fort" (), lying by the TvrÃ¤Âa get to street. 

Amid the Ottoman time frame, Osijek was globally known due to the Suleiman Bridge. The development of the extension was started by ÃÂ°brahim Pasha on 16 August 1526 after the requests of Suleiman the Magnificent. The extension, which associated Osijek and Darda, appeared as a wooden street on docks and was around long and wide. Seen as an extraordinary risk to Christian Europe the scaffold was assaulted a few times, being decimated in 1664, when it was determined to flame on the requests of Croatian medieval ruler Nicholas VII of Zrin (, ). The extension was modified amid the standard of Suleiman II. At long last, it was torched by the Habsburg armed forces in 1686. 

Improvement of the military settlement at TvrÃ¤Âa began in 1687 when the Habsburg armed forces drove the Ottomans out of the city amid the Great Turkish War. The central administrator of the Imperial armed force, Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, considered Osijek to be an area of uncommon key significance in the war against the Ottomans. He asked the fix of the city dividers, and proposed development of another post as per Vauban's standards of military designing. 

The town judge was built up in 1690, while the designs for the new post were all the while being drawn up, and one of its reports from August of that year portrayed the state of the settlement as "ruinous". After two months, on 29 October, the Ottoman armed force all of a sudden assaulted. The assault was shocked just gratitude to an efficient resistance, and the Turks pulled back on 6 November, after a concise attack. The occasion was a reasonable exercise that the development of the fortification must not be deferred any further. The main period of TvrÃ¤Âa's transformation into a Baroque post depended on the arrangement contrived by the architect Mathias von Kaiserfeld from 1691. 

The first arrangement for TvrÃ¤Âa was drafted as a result of the need to strengthen the town dividers, however did exclude arrangements to overhaul the inside and imagined to a great extent uncontrolled advancement. New designs for a post on the correct bank of the River Drava were drawn up by Maximilian Gosseau de Henef. Gosseau took over arranging of the stronghold when development was in progress. Beginning in August 1712, Austrian specialists, regulated by the fortress' officer, General Johann Stephan von Beckers, manufactured dormitory, staff home office, temples and cloisters, encompassed by arrangement of channels, bastions and firearm positions, regarding Gosseau's plan. The structure pursued the model of marsh Dutch military strongholds of the period. 

By 1715, each of the five arranged bastions and two entryways were finished. An extra, western, entryway prompting the Upper Town was included 1716. The development of the outwork on the contrary bank of the River Drava, intended to offer security from the north and to fill in as a bridgehead, was finished by 1721. The last, fourth entryway, prompting the Lower Town, was not included until 1783. Development of the internal town was finished by 1733, and in 1735 three extra northern bastions were finished, alongside a mail station, the fortress' development office and an emergency clinic. The finished fortification had "eight bastions, two arsenals, two noteworthy terminals, army central station, military court, development office, battalion doctor, guardhouse, officer lofts, military emergency clinic and seven garisson huts". In light of the 'ring model', the strongholds took up a territory of , making TvrÃ¤Âa the biggest fortification on the outskirt with the Ottoman Empire. 

Gosseau's arrangement left space for places of worship to be manufactured where mosques had once stood. At first, changed over mosques were utilized as houses of worship, yet Franciscans began to construct a Baroque church in 1709 and it was sanctified in 1732. A Franciscan religious community was worked somewhere in the range of 1699 and 1705, with another wing being included somewhere in the range of 1731 and 1733, which along these lines turned into another cloister in 1761. In 1725, the Jesuits started development of the ward church of St. Michael (), following the development of their own religious community. This congregation was being used after 1734, in spite of being deficient. A Holy Trinity segment was raised in the stronghold's principle square in 1730 as a plague landmark highlighting volutes with platforms on which four defenders against the plague are put. Four extra platforms were added to the landmark in 1784, each highlighting a statue of a holy person. TvrÃ¤Âa had road lighting as ahead of schedule as 1717. The primary framework to supply open water in Croatia was opened in TvrÃ¤Âa in 1751. 

In the mid-eighteenth century there were allegedly in excess of 35 hotels in TvrÃ¤Âa, evaluated to a record for one of every three of the fortress' structures. Crown ruler Joseph remained in one of the motels when visiting Osijek. In 1786, as Joseph II, he announced the merger of the Upper Town, Lower Town and TvrÃ¤Âa into one single town committee. 

As ahead of schedule as the second 50% of the eighteenth century there was almost no new developments occurring in TvrÃ¤Âa, and even upkeep of the fortress turned into a weight. In 1809 Osijek was allowed free regal town status. Osijek's chamber was suited in a structure at the south-eastern corner of TvrÃ¤Âa's principle square. 

TvrÃ¤Âa's military significance diminished after the Berlin Congress of 1878 because of expanding political and military steadiness in the locale. Two north-western bastions were annihilated during the 1870s, clearing path for Ambrose's Park (). Development of the "Imperial Grammar School" began in 1881, and the "Regal General Secondary School" was finished in 1890. Episcopal theological college was likewise worked in the south-western corner of the fundamental square in 1898. These were the main structures raised inside TvrÃ¤Âa dividers over the most recent three many years of the nineteenth century. 

As Osijek developed as a city, the fortress' essence frustrated the potential for urban improvement. The obliteration of the majority of the fortress dividers occurred somewhere in the range of 1923 and 1926, with the development of an electric tramway. The last black powder magazine, situated behind the congregation of St. Michael, was pulverized in 1958. While the greater part of the strongholds have been wrecked (just the first and eighth bastions and the northern divider with its supposed 'water door' were kept), the focal point of TvrÃ¤Âa stays unblemished. The Yugoslav People's Army kept up a battalion and a military medical clinic in TvrÃ¤Âa, however during the 1980s these structures were bit by bit being deserted, and adjusted into ateliers for neighborhood painters and stone workers. 

The stronghold continued significant harm amid the Croatian War of Independence, which endured from 1991 until 1995. The war brought auxiliary harm from crumbling rooftops, dividers and floors. These harms compromise mortar, model and paintings that need legitimate assurance and are liable to proceeding with rot. 

After the stronghold's military significance diminished toward the finish of the nineteenth century, TvrÃ¤Âa turned into a focal point of regulatory, instructive, social, and insightful life in Osijek and the whole district. The main school in Osijek was sorted out at TvrÃ¤Âa; the principal insightful educational programs was presented in 1707, to be later extended and restored, and the primary printing press began working in 1735. The noteworthiness of instructive foundations of TvrÃ¤Âa are best underlined by the way that Croatian Nobel Prize laureates, Lavoslav RuÄºÅ¾iÃ¤Âka and Vladimir Prelog, alongside Serbian researcher Milutin MilankoviÃ¤Â (Milankovitch cycles), were all graduated class (graduates) of the TvrÃ¤Âa schools. The Faculty of Agriculture of the Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek has involved the previous general central station since 1995 after its past site was obliterated in the Croatian War of Independence. The Faculty of Food Technology has been migrated to a structure that filled in as the principal military emergency clinic in Osijek, from the mid-seventeenth century until the start of the 1990s. Other present-day instructive organizations in TvrÃ¤Âa incorporate the II and the III Gymnasium, Franjo KuhaÃ¤Â Music School (previous Roman Catholic Seminary), Jesuit Classical Gymnasium (previous coordinations military quarters worked in the mid-eighteenth century), and the Secondary School of Economics (previous language structure school for young ladies). 

As indicated by the 2001 registration, inside the TvrÃ¤Âa city area, there are 10,277 occupants living in 3,310 family units. The fortress inside is currently a focal point of Osijek's nightlife. There are various bars and eateries in TvrÃ¤Âa. The fortification has the Museum of Slavonia, the biggest general-type exhibition hall in Croatia, situated in TvrÃ¤Âa since 1946. The previous town exhibition hall and documents assembling today houses the "State Directorate for Monument Protection", a bureau of the Croatian Ministry of Culture. The benefactor holy person of the TvrÃ¤Âa is Saint Michael, and his dining experience day of September 29 is commended as the day of the TvrÃ¤Âa city region. 

The World Monuments Fund has depicted TvrÃ¤Âa as "a one of a kind case of an eighteenth-century ornate military, managerial, and business urban focus". TvrÃ¤Âa is on Croatia's 'Speculative List' for thought as candidate for the World Heritage Site. Amid the 1991Ã¢ÂÂ95 clash in Croatia, 90 percent of the structures in TvrÃ¤Âa were harmed to some degree and the post was highlighted on the 1996 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites. It has not showed up on the rundown, distributed at regular intervals, since. 

The structure of the general central station, dating from 1726, and the ground plan of the stronghold are portrayed on the switch of the Croatian 200 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002. 

The Agency for Restoration of Osijek TvrÃ¤Âa () was built up in 1999. Its expressed objectives are security, reclamation and renewal of TvrÃ¤Âa. The rebuilding procedure intends to save engineering, recorded and tasteful characteristics of TvrÃ¤Âa in full agreement with the reclamation standards set by the International Council on Monuments and Sites, while keeping up its multifunctional character. Worldwide participation is likewise imagined, specifically with the Council of Europe. The Agency is mutually financed by the Government of Croatia, Osijek-Baranja County and the City of Osijek.
