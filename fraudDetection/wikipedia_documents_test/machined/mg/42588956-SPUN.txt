Hedwig Potthast 

Hedwig Potthast (5 February 1912 Ã¢ÂÂ 22 September 1994) was the private secretary and fancy woman of "ReichsfÄÅºhrer-SS" Heinrich Himmler with whom she had two youngsters. 

Conceived in 1912, Potthast started as Himmler's secretary in 1936 and by 1938 she was his sweetheart. She left her obligations in 1941, and in this way had two kids with Himmler, a kid and a young lady. After the war, Potthast wedded and carried on with a mind-blowing remainder outside the open eye. In post-war interviews, she avoided responding to inquiries concerning Himmler's association in atrocities carried out by the Nazis and her very own insight into them. She kicked the bucket in 1994. 

Hedwig Potthast was conceived on 5 February 1912 in Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia as the little girl of a nearby specialist. After her last "Abitur" tests at auxiliary school, she prepared as a secretary qualified in unknown dialects. Toward the finish of her preparation in 1928, Potthast worked in Koblenz. 

Through Kurt Baron von SchrÄÅder, one of the organizers of the "Freundeskreis der Wirtschaft" ("Circle of Friends of the Economy"), she met "ReichsfÄÅºhrer-SS" Heinrich Himmler. In 1934, she was utilized at Gestapo central command at Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse in Berlin. From mid 1936 until mid 1941, Potthast was Himmler's private secretary, and in this capacity was especially in charge of Himmler's sponsorship and giving of honors. 

Himmler and Potthast admitted their affection for one another at Christmas time in 1938. At first they endeavored to keep it non-romantic, yet they fell into a two-timing relationship. Himmler's better half since 1928 and mother of their little girl, Margarete Himmler, got some answers concerning Himmler's association with Potthast eventually in February 1941. She felt embarrassed and harsh, and Potthast's folks dismissed the extramarital relationship. Potthast first moved to Grunewald and from 1943 she lived in BrÄÅºckentin, close to the domain of Oswald Pohl, in light of the fact that she was a companion of his significant other, Eleonore. Lina Heydrich, wife of Himmler's correct hand man Reinhard Heydrich, and Gerda Bormann, life partner of Martin Bormann, were additionally considered as a part of her companions. Later she lived in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria. 

Potthast had two kids with Himmler. Helge, a child brought into the world 15 February 1942 in the Hohenlychen Sanatorium, and Nanette-Dorothea, a girl brought into the world 20 July 1944 in Berchtesgaden. That equivalent year, Himmler acquired 80,000 "Reichmarks" from the Nazi Party Chancellery and had a house worked for Potthast close Berchtesgaden. 

Little is thought about the general connection among Himmler and Potthast. The couple in all likelihood observed each other just once in a while because of Himmler's movement in his various workplaces. Apparently, neither Potthast nor Himmler's better half were educated regarding his "mystery work". Potthast's association with Himmler finished in mid 1945,Ã¢ÂÂthey met once and for all in mid-March 1945, after which they shared every day phone calls up until 19 April 1945. 

At the point when World War II in Europe finished, Potthast was in Achensee, Austria and, subsequent to learning of the passing of Himmler on the radio on 23 May 1945, sought total isolation, living incidentally with Eleonore Pohl in Rosenheim, Upper Bavaria. In June/July 1945, she was captured there by individuals from the U.S. Armed force and examined for a few days in Munich. Margarete and Himmler's girl, Gudrun Burwitz, did not learn of her half-kin until after the war. When she endeavored to reach them, Potthast won't. She lived in Theissendorf and stayed in touch with the group of Himmler's more seasoned sibling, Gebhard, just as Himmler's previous close comrade, Karl Wolff, until the 1950s. 

Potthast later wedded and took her better half's name. Her child battled with afflictions for a mind-blowing duration and remained with her; her girl turned into a doctor. In a 1987 meeting with previous "Der Spiegel" proofreader Peter-Ferdinand Koch, Potthast stayed quiet about Himmler's obligation regarding Nazi atrocities. She passed on 22 September 1994, matured 82, in Baden-Baden, Baden-WÄÅºrttemberg.
