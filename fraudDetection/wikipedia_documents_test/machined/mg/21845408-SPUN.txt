In any case, could that change as the season advances? Truly, it could." Murphy expressed that Blaine's circular segment would be a critical one.

We're prepared for the following stage. They've been as one for some time. How about we toss some zest and dramatization into that." Colfer joked that he didn't have even an inkling what was coming up for the couple, "I hear blended things. I hear they're still attached however then perhaps they're separating."

I believe we're concentrating somewhat more back on New Directions and taking a smidgen of a break from the Warblers." 

In the main scene of season three of "Joy", "The Purple Piano Project", Blaine sings "It's Not Unusual" by Tom Jones when he exchanges to McKinley and stops the Warblers for New Directions.

Though she discovered his subplot with Rachel "fun", she remarked: "Blaine's spent discourse in the cafÃ© after Rachel asks him out just felt off-key. Saying 'bye' to the Blaine sexual-disarray storyline wouldn't make us irate by any stretch of the imagination." Todd VanDerWerff of "The A.V. Club" likewise condemned the storyline, which, he expressed, "appeared as though it may be an intriguing, confounded take a gander at young sexuality and how it can appear to be shaped yet may be more liquid than most teenagers would give it acknowledgment for, at that point lost its nerve and took the path of least resistance." "AfterElton.com" Chris O'Guinn felt that the main part of the storyline dealt with acceptably was Blaine addressing whether he was androgynous, as opposed to out and out straight. He scrutinized the shallow examination of his sentiments, and expressed: "Promiscuity is such a petulant issue, that it ought not be bobbled along these lines. For a character to state 'perhaps I'm bi' in one scene and after that the following state, 'nope, certainly gay' is practically pitiless in how pompous it is toward bisexuals by trivializing the extreme disarray that numerous promiscuous individuals feel in dealing with their introduction." In an increasingly positive survey, Canning opined that Blaine and Kurt's discussion about sexuality was "incredible". He was "happy it wasn't a simple talk for both of them" and said that it "felt genuine for children in this circumstance." 

Blaine and Kurt's relationship has been commonly generally welcomed. They were named Favorite TV Couple at the 2010 "AfterElton.com" Visibility Awards, and have been commended for "driving the way" in speaking to gay young people on TV by "Excitement Weekly". Jarett Wieselman of the "New York Post" alluded to them as "a standout amongst the most adored TV couples of the thousand years". When they "at long last hardened what their relationship really is" in the scene "Senseless Love Songs", "IGN" Robert Canning noticed that his sentiment of Blaine improved. He remarked: "I adore that the [serenading of Jeremiah] backfired. The character has dependably fallen off to me as annoyingly pompous, yet "Senseless Love Songs" acculturated the person. Supposition I may need to like him now." Their first kiss, in the scene "Unique Song", was met with basic recognition. Imprint Perigard of "The Boston Herald" stated, "It was completely, sweetly sentimental, and Criss sold the damnation out existing apart from everything else. It's long late and it will quiet the developing army of faultfinders out there who were discontent with the pace of this story." "Diversion Weekly" Mandi Bierly was so awed with the scene that she was at first concerned it might be a fantasy arrangement, "since we don't get sentimental, proud first kisses like that between youthful gay characters on system TV." She stated, "Connections aren't simple. TheyÃ¢ÂÂll commit errors. In any case, on the off chance that they remain consistent with themselves, and keep on being as transparent with one another, we're in for something exceptional."

I anticipate hearing [Blaine] sing more, watching him knock facing the isolated Glee clubbers, and seeing him flaunt his non-uniform clothing". A few commentators were discontent with the second scene's disclosure that Blaine was a lesser, not a senior like Kurt, as had been suggested in the past season. VanDerWerff composed that Blaine "appears to have all the while gotten more youthful and had a total identity transplant over the late spring", "Bulletin" Rae Votta noticed "the congruity twisting plot point that he's some way or another a Junior and not a Senior like his sweetheart", and Samantha Urban of "The Dallas Morning News" enabled her irritation to appear: "Goodness truly, "Happiness"? Blaine's a lesser? Blaine's more youthful than Kurt? Fine. FINE." 

Kurt and Blaine settle on the choice to have intercourse without precedent for "The First Time" scene; numerous commentators were eager about the way that a gay couple was being given such a storyline. Canning said that Kurt and Blaine's "endeavors to get somewhat wild", and "attempting to grow up quicker than they should", were "the better pieces of the scene as they felt the most reasonable".
