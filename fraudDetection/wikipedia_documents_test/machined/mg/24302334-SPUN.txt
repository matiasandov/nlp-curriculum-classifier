Mycena galericulata 

Mycena galericulata is a mushroom animal groups regularly known as the basic hood, the toque mycena, or the ruddy gill pixie head protector. The sort types of the family "Mycena" was first depicted logically in 1772, yet was not considered a "Mycena" until 1821. It is very factor in shading, size, and shape, which makes it to some degree hard to dependably recognize in the field. The mushrooms have tops with unmistakable spiral scores, especially at the edge. The top's shading fluctuates from grayish darker to dull dark colored and the shape ranges from chime like to obtusely cone shaped to leveled with an umbo. The stem is empty, white, intense and slim, without a ring and frequently roots profoundly into the wood on which it develops. The gills are white to grayish or even pinkish when full grown and are associated by unmistakable cross-veins. The tops can reach in width, and have a coarse smell and taste. The spore print is white and the gills are pink at development, which can prompt conceivable perplexity with types of the variety "Pluteus". "M.Ã¢Â galericulata" mushrooms develop generally in groups on the well-rotted stumps of deciduous and coniferous trees from spring to fall. The species can commonly be viewed as unpalatable. It is normal and boundless in the whole mild zone of the Northern Hemisphere, however it has likewise been accounted for from Africa. 

The growth was first portrayed experimentally as "Agaricus galericulatus" by Italian mycologist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1772, and authorized under this name by Elias Magnus Fries in his 1821 "Systema Mycologicum". That equivalent year, Samuel Frederick Gray exchanged the species to the family "Mycena". Equivalent words for the species incorporate "Agaricus conicus" named by William Hudson in 1778, "Agaricus crispus" depicted by August Johann Georg Karl Batsch in 1893, "Stereopodium galericulatum" by Franklin Sumner Earle in 1909, and "Prunulus galericulatus" by William Alphonso Murrill in 1916. 

"Mycena galericulata" is the sort types of the class "Mycena". It is grouped in area "Mycena" of "Mycena" in the infrageneric plan of Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus. In the more seasoned (1947) characterization of Alexander H. Smith, he set it in the subgenus "Eumycena", segment "Typicae"Ã¢ÂÂ"a most repetitive arrangement of blackish, dark colored, dim, pale blue dim, or caramel dim species for the most part with climbing gills and by and large huge to direct stature." 

The particular sobriquet "galericulata" is gotten from the Latin "galer", and signifies "with a little cap". Dark considered it the "helmetted high-stool". It is usually known as the "normal cap", the "toque mycena", or the "ruddy gill pixie cap". 

The top of "M.Ã¢Â galericulata" is generally funnel shaped when youthful, and in the end turns out to be comprehensively ringer molded or with a wide umbo that can achieve breadths of . The top edge is at first fairly bended internal, however before long levels out or even winds up elevated, and regularly parts radially in age. The surface has spiral scores that stretch out almost to the inside, and feels oily yet not sticky. The shading is fairly buff-dark colored on the edge, and blurs step by step to pale filthy tan to grimy cinnamon-darker. The tissue is thick in the focal point of the top and decreases equitably to the edge, and is watery dim, with a ligament like surface. The scent and taste are gently to emphatically farinaceous (like the smell of newly ground flour), to radish-like. 

The gills are barely connected (adnexed) to extensively joined or sinuate. The gill dispersing ranges from near to some degree remotely separated, with 26Ã¢ÂÂ36 gills achieving the stem; there are moreover three or four levels of lamellulae (short gills that don't expand totally from the top edge to the stem). The gills are unequivocally intervenose (having cross-veins), respectably expansive (5Ã¢ÂÂ7Ã¢Â mm), white or grayish white, before long flushed with pale pink, with even edges. The stem is long, thick, equivalent in width all through, and with a cartilaginous surface. It is empty, not furry, either smooth or curved with longitudinal striations, regularly with a long pseudorrhiza (an underground stretching of the stem) at the base. The stem shading is pale grayish white on the upper bit, and pale grayish dark underneath; the base turns out to be to some degree messy darker in age, however does not create rosy stains. 

"Mycena galericulata" produces a white spore print. The spores are ellipsoid, 8Ã¢ÂÂ10 by 5.5Ã¢ÂÂ7Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm, and amyloidÃ¢ÂÂwhich implies they will turn blue-dark to dark when recolored with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have forceful sterigmata, and measure 34Ã¢ÂÂ40 by 7Ã¢ÂÂ9Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm. They might be either two-spored or four-spored. There are various club-molded to adjusted cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge), that measure 32Ã¢ÂÂ40 by 8Ã¢ÂÂ12Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm; their apices or the whole developed part bear rodlike projections that become progressively lengthened and stretched in age. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue has a flimsy fingernail skin, under which is a restricted hypoderm, while the rest of the tissue involves thickly tangled tufts of mycelia, and stains profound vinaceous-darker in iodine. Clip associations are available in the hyphae of the four-spored shapes. 

Conclusions on the edibility of the mushroom fluctuate. One source considers them to have a "sensitive flavor and surface", and proposes that they are great when "stewed tenderly in their own juice and after that prepared with salt, pepper and spread." Others list the species as unappetizing, and notes that they have a "somewhat rank" smell, and with a taste extending from rotten to farinaceous. Another says "obscure, however not prescribed." At any rate, the species falls into the general class of tanish Mycenas that are commonly unappetizing as nourishment because of their little size and sensitive consistency. 

The winter hat ("M.Ã¢Â tintinnabulum") is a northern European animal categories that is a lot littler (top width up to over) and has a dark colored top, and has worn out hairs at the base. It for the most part shows up in late harvest time to late-fall on the stumps of deciduous trees, particularly beech. It has pip-formed spores that are littler than "M.Ã¢Â galericulata", around 4.5Ã¢ÂÂ5.5 by 2.5Ã¢ÂÂ2.8Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. "M.Ã¢Â maculata" creates pink stains on its gills as it develops; its spores are 7Ã¢ÂÂ9 by 4Ã¢ÂÂ5Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm. Another comparable species is "M.Ã¢Â inclinata", which can be recognized by gills bearing rosy spots, which may turn out to be totally red with age. It additionally has whitish, slim, threadlike bits on the stalk. "M.Ã¢Â parabolica" is more slender, and increasingly delicate. Another "Mycena" that develops in bunches on rotting hardwoods is "M.Ã¢Â haematopus", yet this species has a vinaceous-dark colored top with a scalloped edge, and a stem that drains ruddy darker juice when harmed. "M.Ã¢Â excisa" intently looks like "M.Ã¢Â galericulata", yet can be recognized infinitesimally by the nearness of both smooth and roughened cystidia (bearing finger-like projections). 

"Mycena galericulata" is saprobic, and develops on rotting hardwood and softwood sticks, chips, logs, and stumps. It can likewise develop from submerged wood, which may give it an earthly appearance. It ordinarily develops in little bunches or now and again independently. The growth organic products from pre-summer to late-fall. An investigation of litter-decaying organisms in a coniferous timberland in Finland demonstrated that "M.Ã¢Â galericulata" produces extracellular hydrolytic compounds in the humus and eluvial soil, including ÃË-glucosidase, ÃË-xylosidase, ÃÄ-glucosidase, butyrate esterase and sulphatase. The catalysts structure buildings with inorganic and natural particles in the dirt and separate (depolymerize) biopolymers, for example, cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which adds to the cycling of carbon and supplements. The nearness of lead defilement in the dirt abatements both the development and the extracellular hydrolytic protein movement of "M.Ã¢Â galericulata". 

"Mycena galericulata" is an extremely normal and generally conveyed species, found all through the whole calm zone of the Northern Hemisphere. In the United States, it happens all through eastern North America and furthermore along the Pacific Coast. It has likewise been gathered in Edo State, Nigeria. Despite the fact that the mushroom has sporadically been accounted for from Australia, these accumulations are most likely dependent on misidentifications, and "Australian records of "Mycena galericulata" are best viewed as mistaken".
