The National Hockey League (NHL), which had developed from six groups in 1966 to fourteen of every 1970, had not arranged further extension until no less than 1973. Be that as it may, the 1971 development of an adversary significant group Ã¢ÂÂ the World Hockey Association (WHA) Ã¢ÂÂ modified the NHL's arrangements and brought about the two alliances doing combating for players and markets. The NHL looked to keep the WHA out of the recently built Nassau Coliseum in Long Island, New York. The association likewise picked to put a group in the American South. The NHL reported on November 9, 1971, that it was growing to Long Island and Atlanta. The Atlanta establishment was granted to Tom Cousins, who likewise possessed the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and would happen of the recently fabricated Omni Coliseum. The group cost $6Ã¢Â million. Cousins named the establishment the Flames in reverence to the consuming of Atlanta by United States Army General William Sherman amid the American Civil War. 

The Flames enlisted Cliff Fletcher, once of the St. Louis Blues, to fill in as the group's general administrator. Previous Montreal Canadiens player Bernie Geoffrion was contracted as the group's head mentor. The group supplied its program by means of an extension draft hung on June 6, 1972. Fletcher concentrated on goaltending, picking Phil Myre with his first determination and new kid on the block Dan Bouchard with his second. Fletcher drafted a capable list, yet one that was youthful and unpracticed. After two days, the Flames chosen Jacques Richard as the second generally speaking pick in the 1972 NHL Amateur Draft. 

The Flames made their NHL debut in Long Island against their extension cousins, the New York Islanders, on October 7, 1972. They won 3Ã¢ÂÂ2; Morris Stefaniw scored the primary objective in establishment history and the first NHL objective in Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The group made its home introduction multi week later on October 14. Facilitating the principal occasion in Omni Coliseum history, the Flames tied the Buffalo Sabers, 1Ã¢ÂÂ1, before a sellout horde of 14,568.

The Flames won just five additional amusements through the remainder of the period, completing at 25Ã¢ÂÂ38Ã¢ÂÂ15. Atlanta completed in seventh spot in the West Division and missed the playoffs. The group was sensibly fruitful at the door: it sold about 7,000 season tickets by the beginning of the period, and arrived at the midpoint of 12,516 fans for each amusement. 

Tom Lysiak, chose second generally speaking at the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft, joined the Flames for the 1973Ã¢ÂÂ74 season and had a quick effect. Lysiak drove the Flames in scoring with 64 points and completed second to the Islanders' Denis Potvin in voting in favor of the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL's top new kid on the block. Improving to 30Ã¢ÂÂ34Ã¢ÂÂ14, the Flames completed fourth in the West and met all requirements for the 1974 Stanley Cup playoffs. They made their post-season debut against the division-winning Philadelphia Flyers. The main amusement, played April 9, 1974, was a 4Ã¢ÂÂ1 triumph for the Flyers. Philadelphia proceeded to crush the Flames in their best-of-seven arrangement with four back to back successes. Geoffrion was adulated for his instructing of the club and completed second in voting in favor of the Jack Adams Award as top mentor. 

The NHL's development to 18 groups in 1974Ã¢ÂÂ75 brought about realignment. The group moved to a four division design, putting the Flames in the Patrick Division. Lysiak rehashed as the Flames' top scorer with 77 while Eric Vail, playing his first full season, drove with 39 objectives. Vail's absolute drove all youngsters and earned him the Calder Trophy. The group conquered an eight-amusement losing streak in December and wounds to a few key players to post their first winning season with a 34Ã¢ÂÂ31Ã¢ÂÂ15 record. Notwithstanding, they completed fourth in the Patrick Division and neglected to fit the bill for the post-season. Refering to individual reasons, Geoffrion surrendered as head mentor late in the season. He was supplanted with Fred Creighton, who had been instructing the Flames' small time member, the Omaha Knights. Fletcher later acknowledged Geoffrion's friendly identity similar to the essential motivation behind why individuals in Atlanta pursued the Flames in the establishment's first seasons while the group's players later expressed a gratefulness for Creighton's increasingly specialized instructing and educating style. 

Creighton delivered a predictable, however not exceptional group, as the Flames completed third in the Patrick for the accompanying three seasons and normally won a couple of amusements more than they lost every year. The group met all requirements for the playoffs every one of the three years, however lost in the starter round each time. In 1975Ã¢ÂÂ76, they were vanquished by the Los Angeles Kings in a best of three arrangement, two diversions to none. The Kings again wiped out the Flames in 1976Ã¢ÂÂ77, yet Atlanta earned its first playoff triumph in establishment history in the second round of the arrangement. Vail scored the diversion prevailing upon objective in a 3Ã¢ÂÂ2 triumph the Kings on April 7, 1977, yet the Flames were disposed of in the third amusement. 1975 draft pick Willi Plett developed as a youthful star for the Flames. He scored 33 objectives in his new kid on the block period of 1976Ã¢ÂÂ77 and won the Calder Trophy. 

Trying to improve his group's fortunes, Fletcher made a few moves over the accompanying seasons to adjust the Flames list. His goaltending pair of Bouchard and Myre had started to fight with one another by the 1977Ã¢ÂÂ78 season as both looked for all the more playing time. Fletcher reacted by naming Bouchard his main goaltender and exchanging Myre to the St. Louis Blues for three players. They made it into the playoffs again yet were the main group to tumble to a group with less focuses than them, the Detroit Red Wings, in a best-of-three arrangement, two amusements to none. In March 1979, Fletcher finished an eight player exchange that sent establishment driving scorer Tom Lysiak and four players to the Chicago Black Hawks for three players, driven by defenseman Phil Russell. Fletcher trusted the expansion of Russell would enable his group to make playoff progress. 

Floated by an establishment record ten-amusement series of wins in October 1978, the 1978Ã¢ÂÂ79 Flames posted the best record in their Atlanta years at 41Ã¢ÂÂ31Ã¢ÂÂ8. Bounce MacMillan, procured in the Myre bargain, turned into the primary Flame other than Lysiak to lead the group in scoring in six years and, alongside Guy Chouinard, was one of the initial two Flames' players to score 100 points in a single season.

In the playoffs against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Atlanta again neglected to win a diversion as they lost a best of three arrangement two recreations to none. 

Fletcher kept on modifying his group's make-up all through the 1979Ã¢ÂÂ80. Al MacNeil supplanted Creighton as head mentor before the season, and the group procured Swedish star Kent Nilsson following the end of the WHA. Nilsson drove Atlanta in scoring with 40 objectives and 53 helps. At the 1979 NHL Entry Draft, Fletcher chose four players Ã¢ÂÂ Paul Reinhart, Jim Peplinski, Pat Riggin and Tim Hunter Ã¢ÂÂ who might eventually progressed toward becoming regulars in the Flames line up. In any case, while the Flames again met all requirements for the playoffs in 1980, they again lost in the first round, losing a best-of-five arrangement to the New York Rangers three amusements to one. 

As the group stagnated on the ice, the Flames battled at the entryway. They topped at a normal of 14,161 fans for every diversion in their second season, 1973Ã¢ÂÂ74, yet tumbled to 12,258 three years after the fact and after that 10,500 in 1977Ã¢ÂÂ78. Worries that low participation could result in the migration of the group surfaced by 1976, provoking government officials and the players themselves to buy tickets in an offer to balance out the establishment. The Flames endeavored to help participation in 1980 by marking Jim Craig, goaltender of the American Olympic group that had won the Olympic gold award following its "Marvel on Ice" triumph over the Soviet Union. It was not effective as participation tumbled to a normal of 10,024. Adding to the Flames' money related troubles was the way that the Omni Coliseum was one of the last real fields in North America to be worked without income producing extravagance suites, which drove Fletcher to depict the office as being "outdated when it opened".

The Seaman siblings, Daryl and Byron, had made an idea of $14Ã¢Â million while the City of Calgary arranged to assemble another field for the group. Notwithstanding, Canadian agent Nelson Skalbania developed as an opponent bidder for the group before joining the Calgary consortium. The gathering consented to buy the Flames for $16Ã¢Â million, at the time the most astounding cost at any point paid for a NHL establishment. The deal was declared on May 21, 1980, and the establishment migrated to Canada where it turned into the Calgary Flames. The Flames have since utilized the Atlanta logo for the two its substitute skippers, and the group's previous subsidiary that played in the American Hockey League (AHL), the Adirondack Flames. 

The last dynamic Atlanta Flames player in the NHL was Kent Nilsson, who played his last diversion in 1995. A few previous players of the group came back to Atlanta once their professions finished. Among them, Tom Lysiak worked a steed ranch outside the city, Eric Vail came back to work a dance club and Willi Plett worked a donning amusement park and green.
