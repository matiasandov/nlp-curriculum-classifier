Holborn tube station 

Holborn ( ) is a London Underground station in Holborn, Central London, situated at the intersection of High Holborn and Kingsway. It is served by the Central and Piccadilly lines. On the Central line the station is between Tottenham Court Road and Chancery Lane stations; on the Piccadilly line it is between Covent Garden and Russell Square and is in Travelcard Zone 1. 

Close by are the British Museum, Lincoln's Inn Fields, Red Lion Square, Bloomsbury Square, London School of Economics and Sir John Soane's Museum. 

Situated at the intersection of two prior cylinder railroad conspires, the station was opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&BR). The station doorways and subterranean course were to a great extent remade for the presentation of elevators and the opening of Central line stages in 1933, making the station the main exchange between the lines. Prior to 1994, Holborn was the northern end of the short and little-frequented Piccadilly line branch to Aldwych and two stages initially utilized for this administration are neglected. One of the neglected stages has been utilized for area shooting when a London Underground station stage is required. 

The station was arranged by the Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN&SR), which had gotten parliamentary endorsement for a course from Wood Green station (presently Alexandra Palace) to Strand in 1899. After the GN&SR was taken over by the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B&PCR) in September 1901, the two organizations went under the control of Charles Yerkes' Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company before being exchanged to his new holding organization, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) in June 1902. To associate the two organizations' arranged courses, the UERL got authorization for new passages between Piccadilly Circus and Holborn. The organizations were formally converged as the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway following parliamentary endorsement in November 1902. 

The connecting of the GN&SR and B&PCR courses at Holborn implied that the segment of the GN&SR south of Holborn turned into a branch from the primary course. The UERL started building the principle course in July 1902. Advancement was quick, with the goal that it was to a great extent total by the Autumn of 1906. Development of the branch was deferred while the London County Council completed ghetto clearances to build its new street Kingsway and the tramway metro running underneath it and keeping in mind that the UERL chose how the intersection between the primary course and the branch would be organized at Holborn. 

At the point when initially arranged by the GN&SR, Holborn station was to have only two stages. The first GNP&BR plan for the station would have seen the two stages shared via prepares on the principle course and by the bus administration on the branch with the intersections between the passages south of the station. The impedance that bus trains would have caused to administrations on the principle course prompted an upgrade so two northbound stages were given, one for the fundamental line and one for the branch line, with a solitary southbound stage. The intersections between the two northbound passages would have been north of the stages. At the point when powers were looked to manufacture the intersection in 1905, the format was changed again so four stages were to be given. The southbound passage of the principle course never again associated with the branch, which was to be furnished with an extra stage in an impasse burrow got to from a hybrid from the northbound branch burrow. As worked, for simplicity of traveler get to, the branch's northbound passage finished in an impasse stage neighboring the northbound primary line stage with the branch's southbound passage associated with the northbound fundamental line burrow. To empower the southbound passage of the principle course to keep away from the branch burrows, it was developed at a lower level than different passages and stages. The passage towards Covent Garden (now traveling south-west) goes under the branch burrows. 

Similarly as with the vast majority of the other GNP&BR stations, the station building was structured by Leslie Green, however at Holborn the station facing was, extraordinarily, built in stone as opposed to the standard red coated earthenware. This was because of arranging guidelines forced by the London County Council which required the utilization of stone for faÄÂ§ades in Kingsway. The station passageway and leave areas of the road faÄÂ§ade were built in rock with different pieces of the ground and first floors in a similar style, yet utilizing Portland stone. The remainder of the structure above first floor level was developed contemporaneously with the station. Access to the stage dimensions of the station was given by trapezium-formed electric lifts produced by Otis in America. These worked in sets in shared roundabout shafts, with a departure stair in a different, littler shaft. 

In spite of the fact that the station was developed where the GNP&BR's passages crossed those of the Central London Railway (CLR, presently the Central line) running under High Holborn, no exchange between the two lines was made as the CLR's closest station, British Museum, was toward the west. Travelers wishing to trade between the two stations needed to do as such at road level. 

The station opened on 15 December 1906, in spite of the fact that the opening of the branch was postponed until 30 November 1907. 

The road level trade between the GNP&BR and CLR including two arrangements of lifts was viewed as a shortcoming in the system. A subterranean metro association was considered in 1907. A proposition to grow the CLR's passages to make new stages at Holborn station and to relinquish British Museum station was incorporated into a private bill submitted to parliament by the CLR in November 1913, in spite of the fact that the First World War counteracted any works occurring. 

In the same way as other focal London Underground stations, Holborn was modernized in the mid 1930s to supplant the lifts with elevators. The station frontages on Kingsway and High Holborn were mostly reproduced to innovator plans by Charles Holden with the rock components supplanted with plain Portland stone faÄÂ§ades punctured with coated screens. The lifts were expelled and an extensive new ticket corridor was given offering access to a bank of four elevators down to a middle concourse for the Central line stages. A second bank of three lifts proceeds down to the Piccadilly line stages. 

To develop the new Central line stages, the bigger breadth station burrows were physically exhumed around the current running passages while trains kept on running. At the point when the unearthings were finished, the first segmental passage linings were disassembled. The new stages came into utilization on 25 September 1933 supplanting those of British Museum, which had shut the day preceding. As a major aspect of the modernisation the station was renamed "Holborn (Kingsway)" on 22 May 1933, however the addition slowly dropped out of utilization and never again shows up on station signage or cylinder maps. The new stages at Holborn prompted the quantity of travelers exchanging between the lines expanding ten times by 1938. 

The station was retiled during the 1980s, with wall paintings planned by Allan Drummond that reference the British Museum. These paintings reference Egyptian and Roman relics, with stone caskets, statues and trompe-l'ÄºÂil segments on the dividers of the stage. 

At first, transport train benefits on the branch worked from the through stage at Holborn. At pinnacle times, an extra train worked on the other hand in the branch's western passage from the inlet stage at Holborn. Amid the primary year of activity, a train for theatergoers worked late on Monday to Saturday nighttimes from Strand through Holborn and northbound to Finsbury Park; this was ended in October 1908. 

In March 1908, the off-crest transport administration started to utilize the western passage on the branch, going between the two branch burrows south of Holborn. Low utilization prompted the withdrawal of the second pinnacle hour transport and the eastern passage was removed from use in 1914. Sunday administrations finished in April 1917 and, in August of that year, the eastern passage and the inlet stage at Holborn were formally shut. Traveler numbers on the branch stayed low: when the branch was considered for conclusion in 1929, its yearly utilization was 1,069,650 and takings were ÃÅ4,500. The branch was again considered for conclusion in 1933, however stayed open. 

Wartime effectiveness estimates prompted the branch being shut briefly on 22 September 1940, not long after the beginning of The Blitz, and it was somewhat fitted out by the City of Westminster as an air-strike cover. The passages were utilized to store things from the British Museum, including the Elgin Marbles. The branch revived on 1 July 1946, yet support did not increment. In 1958, London Transport reported it would be shut. Again it endure, however the administration was decreased in June 1958 to run just amid Monday to Friday top hours and Saturday morning and early evenings. The Saturday administration was pulled back in June 1962. 

Subsequent to working just amid pinnacle hours for more than 30Ã¢Â years, the conclusion declaration went ahead 4 January 1993. The first 1907 lifts at Aldwych required substitution at an expense of ÃÅ3Ã¢Â million. This was not legitimate as just 450 travelers utilized the station every day and it was losing London Regional Transport ÃÅ150,000 every year. The Secretary of State for Transport conceded consent on 1 September 1994 to close the station and the branch shut on 30 September. 

After its conclusion in 1917, the inlet stage was changed over into spaces for use, at different occasions, as workplaces, air-attack covers, store rooms, an electrical sub-station and a war-time inn. Since 1994, the branch's residual stage at Holborn has been utilized to test mock-up structures for new stage signage and publicizing frameworks. 

In the consequence of the King's Cross flame in 1987, the Fennell Report into the fiasco prescribed that London Underground explore "traveler stream and clog in stations and make medicinal move". A private bill was submitted to parliament and affirmed as the "London Underground (Safety Measures) Act 1991" giving London Underground powers to improve and extend the much of the time blocked station with another ticket corridor and new metros. The extension works were not completed and the course of action of the station stays much equivalent to it was during the 1930s. 

As indicated by Transport for London (TfL), the station is at limit in view of the extensive number of travelers leaving and entering the station, just as the substantial quantities of travelers changing between lines. As of now, everybody who utilizes the station needs to go through the halfway concourse at the base of the principle elevators. This causes clog and postponements. 

In September 2017, TfL proposed different station upgrades including a second passageway on Procter Street toward the north-east of the station, lifts to give step free access, and new passages to improve the exchange between the Central and Piccadilly lines. On the off chance that authorization is in all actuality, the redesign work is evaluated to take six years and will dramatically increase the extent of the station, significantly expanding its ability. 

The Holborn rail crash happened on the Central line at Holborn on 9 July 1980, at about 13:28 and included two 1962 stock trains. The 13:17 train from Liverpool Street to White City, remaining at the westward stage, was kept running into by the 12:49 Hainault to Ealing Broadway train. The back train was abating after its brakes had been connected by the crisis train stop framework since it had passed two signs at risk, however it neglected to stop so as to evade impact. The driver of the back train and 20 travelers were harmed. A request presumed that the mishap was brought about by the driver neglecting to control his train. Interruption of administrations happened until the next morning. 

On 21 October 1997, a 9-year-old kid, Ajit Singh, was hauled to his demise after a switch on his anorak was caught in the end entryways of a Piccadilly line train. 

The neglected branch line stage and different pieces of the station have been utilized in the shooting of music recordings for Howard Jones' "New Song", Leftfield's "Discharge the Pressure", Suede's "Saturday Night" and Aqua's "Turn Back Time". 

The pre-war activity of the station and the branch line includes in a urgent scene in Geoffrey Household's tale "Maverick Male", when the quest for the hero by foe specialists sees them more than once utilizing the station's elevators, ways and the bus administration. 

The station is in London toll zone 1. On the Central line the station is between Tottenham Court Road and Chancery Lane, and on the Piccadilly line, it is between Covent Garden and Russell Square. Holborn is the main exchange between these lines. Train frequencies change for the duration of the day, however by and large Central line trains work each 2Ã¢ÂÂ6 minutes from roughly 05:53 to 00:30 westward and 05:51 to 00:33 eastward. Piccadilly line trains work each 2Ã¢ÂÂ6 minutes from around 05:42 to 00:28 westward and 05:54 to 00:38 northbound. 

On the Central line 1992 Stock is utilized. On the Piccadilly line 1973 Stock is utilized. 

Before the conclusion of the first London cable car arrange in 1952, Holborn tube station gave a trade among cable cars and cylinders, by means of the Kingsway Tramway Subway underground Holborn tramway station found a little separation south of the underground station. This was the main piece of London with an underground cable car framework, and Holborn tramway station (named Great Queen Street when previously opened) is as yet surviving underneath ground, however with no community. 

London Busses highways 1, 59, 68, 91, 168, 171, 188, 243, 521 and X68 and night courses N1, N68, N91 and N171 serve the station.
