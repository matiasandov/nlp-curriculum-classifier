We have never said this is a historical center quality proliferation... We have dependably said this is a portrayal of Ashurbanipal as done by a twentieth century craftsman. In the event that they think about this as Gilgamesh, they are allowed to do as such. 

Renee Kovacs, a "researcher and self-expressed Assyriologist", said the statue delineated neither Ashurbanipal or Gilgamesh, yet rather a Mesopotamian "defensive figure, similar to a watchman."

He said of the model: The piece has bona fide characteristics to it, yet it is likewise my statue... With the hoops and the dress and the hair and his blades, it is Ashurbanipal. In any case, in the decision of (position), the way that he is holding a tablet and a lion, that is mine. I needed myself to be spoken to in the piece.
