The two-man occasion occurred first, with Dudley Stokes and White completing in 30th position by and large. American TV channels disclosed film of the four-man Jamaican group, and in spite of slamming amid the third run and completing keep going in general, proceeded to move the 1993 film "Cool Runnings".

They have showed up at each Summer Games since, including at the 1960 Games in which they showed up as a major aspect of the consolidated group of the British West Indies. They have won awards at each Summer Games they have contended at, except for the 1956 and 1964 Summer Olympics. 

Representatives George B. Fitch and William Maloney proposed the possibility of a Jamaican bobsleigh group in the wake of seeing a neighborhood cart derby in Jamaica. The President of the Jamaica Olympic Association at the time upheld the thought, thus arrangements were made to employ competitors. Promotions were set depicting "unsafe and thorough" preliminaries which would shape the premise of the nation's first bobsleigh group. Nonetheless, enlistment ended up being risky thus the Jamaica Defense Force was requested volunteers. This brought about the primary group of Dudley Stokes, Devon Harris and Michael White. These three were chosen as a component of the group in October 1987, with colleague Casewell Allen included later. 

With financing given by the Fitch and the Jamaica Tourist Board, preparing was led in Canada and Austria in anticipation of the 1988 Winter Olympics.

They improved in the second run, climbing to 22nd spot, yet were in 31st spot on the third run and completed just a single spot higher in 30th spot amid the fourth and last run. In general the pair completed in 30th spot out of the 41 groups contending. 

Following the end of the United States ice hockey group, American TV slots expected to fill broadcast appointment and concentrated on the Jamaican bobsleigh group in the four-man occasion. The principal run finished ineffectively, as when Dudley Stokes hopped into the bobsleigh, the push-bar in the sleigh broke, bringing about the group coming in third from toward the end in 24th spot. On their second endeavor, the group positioned second to last, due to some degree to White attempting to hunch down appropriately in his seat, remaining practically upstanding through the primary corner. 

It was the occasions of the third keep running for which the group turned out to be best known. Stirs harmed his shoulder before the race, however chose to proceed with the run. The group set the seventh-quickest begin for all contenders. At the turn called the "Kreisel", Stokes lost control of the bobsleigh and it pitched into the mass of the track, and flipped over the four competitors.

The group did not contend in the fourth keep running of the occasion, and accordingly were recorded as not completing the occasion and along these lines were put in the last spot generally speaking. 

The account of the Jamaican bobsleigh group at the 1988 Winter Olympics was transformed into the 1993 motion picture "Cool Runnings". Be that as it may, the film was just approximately dependent on real occasions, with genuine mentor Pat Brown later saying that the group had never encountered any of the ill will from different groups as delineated in the motion picture. 

The majority of the colleagues returned for the 1992 Winter Olympics, anyway Harris just contended in the two-man occasion, with his place in the four-man group taken by newcomer Ricky McIntosh. Harris and the Stokes siblings would keep on contending at the Winter Games in the bobsleigh occasions until the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.
