Beginning work on "Get to Heaven" was finished amid a caught up with visiting plan for the gathering's second collection "Curve" (2013). Following this visit, they leased studio space in Wales with an end goal to be "away and segregated", however nothing happened to these sessions. The collection itself was recorded at Angelic Studios in Northampton amid 2014. The liner notes recommend a few different spaces were likewise utilized for parts of the collection, including Crotch Int. in Gilsland, Eve Studios in Bredbury, Making Do in Manchester, and Distillery in Wiltshire. They alluded to the collection's creation through their Twitter account in August 2014, and reported they were recording two weeks after the fact. 

Everything went into the studio intending to "make individuals need to move", and begin keeping away from slower-paced melodies that had included emphatically on their past collection. This ended up clear to them following the composition of possible collection closer "Warm Healer". Lead vocalist, Jonathan Higgs, told "Hymn Magazine" that "we sort of tore up that standard book in the wake of reali[s]ing, 'Right. LetÃ¢ÂÂs not compose something this calm. LetÃ¢ÂÂs do loathsome stuff starting now and into the foreseeable future'". The gathering dealt with thoughts for melodies as they came to them, as opposed to their past technique for rehearsing and recording as a live gathering. Bass guitarist, Jeremy Pritchard, disclosed to "Skiddle" that the gathering were quick to make a record that would "go to bat for the tremendous measure of time you spend visiting a record", which thus propelled a more pop-situated sound than had showed up on "Circular segment". Higgs later talked about how they utilized their past sound to educate the bearing regarding "Get to Heaven", looking to keep away from "calm tunes" and "delicacy" with an end goal to "infuse another flame into ourselves". 

Despite the fact that past collections were delivered by David Kosten, they enrolled the help of maker Stuart Price after he inspired them with his work on a demo form of the inevitable single, "Lament". As Price was situated in Los Angeles, the band messaged him tests of their work for him to evaluate and get his proposed blends consequently. They had blended responses to his recommendations; at one point amid generation of "Hapsburg Lippp" Ã¢ÂÂ a track which did not make the last track posting Ã¢ÂÂ Price returned them a reggae-propelled blend as a joke. Higgs disclosed to Andy Morris of "Gigwise" that Price had a "capacity to wind up one of us in all respects rapidly". Cost went along with them face to face throughout the previous nine days of account. Guitarist Alex Robertshaw said to "Advanced Spy" that his inspiration established a connection on them: "Just [having] another truly innovative individual in the stay with you is phenomenal." 

Amid chronicle sessions, Higgs experienced wretchedness. He alluded as far as possible of their 150-date visit as "an out-of-the-sauna-and-into-a-chilly shower understanding", including that "riding that low just as endeavoring to make a record was very hard". He was influenced by regular emotional episodes because of his drug; Pritchard said that these "influenced [them] pretty antagonistically". Drummer, Michael Spearman, disclosed to "Q" that Higgs' endeavor to channel his despondency into his composition stressed the remainder of the gathering. At a certain point amid composing sessions, Higgs gave his bandmates "Pigdog", a tune about "how [he is] an awful individual and [he doesn't] need to be one any more". Spearman protested this style: "For me that was a defining moment. I resembled, 'How about we make a record thatÃ¢ÂÂs vigorous and messed up and energizing.'" 

Robertshaw told "Suffocated in Sound's" Robert Leedham that the collection is "bolder" than the gathering's past work, and is "the most Everything record we've at any point done". The band went for an "euphoric" sound to give a "logical inconsistency between the manner in which the verses are and [their] sound". In March 2015, they portrayed their sound as "Florid Obama" on Facebook, disclosing to "Gigwise" that "it's the place Bach meets Jay Z". For specific tracks, Robertshaw said their point was "to seem like changing radio stations", toying with different melodic thoughts in a single tune in a similar style as Kendrick Lamar. Spearman contrasted this style with the silliness in "The Simpsons": "It's twenty minutes of 'blast, blast, blast' Ã¢ÂÂ where it began up was route diverse to where it winds up. The tales are simply screwing insane. That is enjoyable to us." 

Higgs named Suicide's 1977 single "Frankie Teardrop" as a noteworthy impact on the collection's sound, portraying it as "truly startling music": "It's a melody: I shouldn't feel like this." They endeavored to reproduce this disrupting, erratic sound on the collection, however "needed an upbeat closure". In a meeting with "The Independent", Higgs talked about Radiohead's widely praised "Child A" (2000) as a further impact, as they "tossed out guitars, and with it the general concept of sort". Radiohead's effect on the record was remarked on further by Laura Snapes at "Pitchfork", who noticed the utilization of a "jumpy guitar solo acquired from "Hail to the Thief"". Faultfinders would later allude to their sound for the most part as "maximalist craftsmanship pop" or workmanship shake. In different areas of the collection, they explored different avenues regarding different sorts; Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of the "Budgetary Times" noticed the "Talking Heads-style Afro-fly" of title track "Get to Heaven". 

The majority of the songs on "Get to Heaven" began from Robertshaw's guitar, however he reviewed to Rich Chamberlain of MusicRadar that Higgs would every so often approach the remainder of the gathering with "a crazy PC creation" which would need to be meant fill in as a gathering. A few tracks include complex guitar performances, as supported by Chamberlain; one such solo, highlighted on the title track "Get to Heaven", was initially recorded in a lodging. Another, on the single "Spring/Sun/Winter/Dread", utilizes a MWFX Judder pedal. Robertshaw disclosed to Chamberlain that "[it] is somewhat of a mark for the new record... You can do absolutely unreasonable things with it and it makes you seem like Steve Vai on split." 

The collection's subjects rotate around occasions which occurred in 2015, for example, the ascent of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the British media's treatment of the United Kingdom general decision, just as on the condition of humankind. Lead author Higgs went through a year composing the collection, time he spent watching moving news and encompassing himself in recent developments. Pritchard told the "London Evening Standard" that "we're during a time where we're increasingly aware of [upheaval and savagery ...] you're continually shelled by data". Addressing Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs clarified the songwriting procedure gave a sort of purgation following the year's occasions: "It wasn't until after we completed that I thought back and thought, ridiculous heck, I was feeling that in all respects intensely and I didn't understand until it was out of me." He later portrayed the collection as an "awfulness book of scriptures". 

The collection's opening track, "To the Blade", centers around the demise of Manchester-conceived help specialist Alan Henning on account of ISIL's "Jihadi John". Higgs disclosed to "Suffocated in Sound" that: "He was a cabbie from Stockport, I could have met him. What's more, the way that somebody who did it was likewise from Britain, yet this was being happened on a worldwide scale... It appeared the craziest thing IÃ¢ÂÂd ever heard." Other melodies censure political pioneers in the United Kingdom. Higgs had been vocal of his aversion of legislative issues in meetings following the arrival of "Circular segment." Several faultfinders propose that "The Wheel (Is Turning Now)" is a critique on the "quack remedy advance" of then-UK Independence Party pioneer Nigel Farage; Higgs told "The Line of Best Fit" that the tune likewise remarks on "religious pioneers and appealling, degenerate pioneers, or even men as divine beings". "No Reptiles" assumes that political pioneers are "simply fat, bare, elderly people men, as delicate bubbled eggs, that are simply feeble willed, with no solid emotions (great or sick)"; its verses likewise make secretive reference to Elliot Rodger, who did the 2014 Isla Vista killings. 

A great part of the collection is introduced in-character through the eyes of different anecdotal characters and spectators. "Fortune 500" records an anecdotal endeavor to kill Queen Elizabeth II, which Higgs identifies with the considerations of suicide planes minutes before they explode: "The ghastliness of the uncertainty is far more awful than the demonstration, for the fear based oppressor I mean. ItÃ¢ÂÂs this 'gracious poop... possibly this isnÃ¢ÂÂt what God needs'. I think itÃ¢ÂÂs the darkest minute on the record." Spearman called the incorporation of stacked, political verses on generally perky tunes "the Trojan Horse approach ... get your intriguing expressive thought into something that on its essence is only there to be appreciated". Higgs told "NME" that Kanye West's 2013 collection "Yeezus" majorly affected his composition, urging him to introduce himself all the more unquestionably, while Nick Cave furnished motivation to be progressively incautious with his composition.

Liner notes, which included substantial sort extracts of the collection's verses on splendid angles, were planned by Johnny Costello of Adult Art Club "to reverberate high effect religious publications".

Much was said about the collection's dependence on dull topics. Laura Snapes of "Pitchfork" composed that these can be "overpowering", however she credited them for "endeavoring to offer a nuanced comprehension of a broken world when a ton of their essentially less innovative British independent shake peers state more regrettable than nothing".
