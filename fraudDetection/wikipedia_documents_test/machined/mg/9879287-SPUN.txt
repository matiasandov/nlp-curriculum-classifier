Despite the fact that she had numerous supporters for the feedings, she was likewise reprimanded for illustration a huge populace of hawks to the region. After her demise, the city of Homer passed a law precluding the nourishing of savage flying creatures. 

Jean Marie Hodgdon was conceived on October 20, 1923 in Aitkin County, Minnesota. The oldest of three sisters and one sibling, she experienced childhood with a dairy ranch in Aitkin, where she assisted with homestead tasks including grouping, sustaining, and draining bovines. She figured out how to ride steeds and turned into a gifted steed breaker and coach. 

In 1952, she was enlisted by the voyaging rodeo outfit Red River Rodeo as a trap rider, and by the mid-1950s was envisioning a forthcoming appearance with Red River at Madison Square Garden. Nonetheless, her rodeo vocation was suddenly stopped in a riding mishap amid an act at Olympia Arena in Detroit, Michigan. While playing out a trap called the "demise drag", she missed a handhold subsequent to reclining excessively far in her seat. She tumbled from her steed and was thumped oblivious when her head hit the field divider. Her foot was still gotten in the stirrup, and she was hauled around the field, tangled in the steed's legs, until other rodeo work force had the capacity to stop the steed. She endured 15 cracks in her left knee. After medical procedure to fix her knee, she went through a while in recuperation encased starting from the waist in a mortar cast. After the cast was expelled, she was as yet ready to walk and ride, however not with the office expected to perform in the rodeo. 

For a period she filled in as an expert truck driver pulling cows. In the late 1950s she wedded, and brought forth a child, Lonnie, before separating. By the mid 1960s she was a single parent. She opened up a canine and feline preparing business and furthermore raised and reared cocker spaniels. She later turned into the proprietor and administrator of Jolly Chef Truck Stop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

Keene came to Alaska without precedent for the mid 1970s to go to a cousin's wedding. Pulled in by the state's excellence, she returned for a few visits before settling on the choice in 1977 to move there Ã¢ÂÂ alone. Her child Lonnie was regarded mature enough to settle on his own choices, and he stayed in Minnesota. Keene took seven days to drive from Minnesota to Alaska in a used RV, finishing off with Homer, where she stopped the RV toward the finish of Homer Spit in the Homer Spit Campground, where it stayed for a long time. She accepted a position at a fish preparing office on the Spit, the Icicle Seafoods backup Seward Fisheries, in the spring of 1977, where she later turned into a foreman. 

Keene's profession as the "Falcon Lady" started not long after her landing in Homer, when one morning she saw two bald eagles on the shoreline close to her RV. Keene saw offering nourishment to the hawks as a characteristic augmentation of her routine with regards to keeping winged creature feeders loaded up with sunflower seeds for wild warblers. She started to get home surplus fish a can from her activity, and every morning would toss some fish to the falcons over the short driftwood fence she had made around her RV. Before the finish of that spring, about six falcons were appearing for breakfast. The birds withdrew with the landing of summer, when the Spit turned out to be progressively dynamic with human guests, yet they returned in the winter when traveler season had finished, and Keene continued the day by day bolstering. 

Inside ten years, more than 200 bald eagles were visiting amid winter and late-winter every day, and the activity of encouraging them turned out to be increasingly included. To have enough fish to last through the winter, she would start in August to store fish scraps and cooler consumed fish given by her manager and by other neighborhood organizations. The fish was once in a while enhanced by moose meat that Keene rescued when she knew about a street murdered moose on the parkway. She started sustaining the birds at about December 1 of every year, an occupation that took as long as three hours' work every morning. Keene got authorization from her boss to utilize an organization forklift to move the vast holders of amassed fish scraps and cooler consumed salmon, halibut, rockfish, cod, and herring out of the organization's substantial coolers. She at that point exchanged the fish by hand into barrels or rubbish jars, which she stacked up in her pickup truck. At that point she would drive the heap to her RV, about from the Seward Fisheries plant, and cut the fish into clench hand estimated pieces to be tossed out to the falcons. In the event that the fish was completely solidified, she would utilize a hatchet, cutting tool, or blowtorch to separate the fish into littler lumps, or may even need to carry the huge waste jars into her RV to defrost. "I don't have the foggiest idea in the event that any other person would do this," she told a columnist in 1986. "My RV smells like fish. My yard is fish. My truck is fish. I am fish. It gets sort of gross now and again, particularly when you're taking care of a ton of vile corpses." 

Keene had been steady in her endeavors. In 1985 she broke her leg, however figured out how to keep to the encouraging timetable even on supports. In the winter of 1994 she was determined to have bosom malignant growth and on her specialist's recommendation experienced a mastectomy. She contracted a companion to direct encouraging tasks in her nonattendance, yet had returned to do it without anyone else's help three days after medical procedure. 

On July 1, 1998, a smelling salts break and blast at the Seward Fisheries plant caused a flame that prompted the clearing of Homer Spit and a definitive pulverization of the office, which up to that point had been the significant provider of fish stays for Keene's bolstering task. However, Keene had the capacity to report when winter came that she had discovered different sources and was prepared for the falcons when they returned. 

Despite the fact that the quantity of visiting hawks changed, around 200 to 300 falcons would appear every day amid the long stretches of winter and late-winter. Crows and gulls were additionally pulled in to the region. Keene sustained them an expected 500 pounds (227Ã¢Â kg) of fish every day, around 50,000 pounds (22,680Ã¢Â kg) every year. Her fish supply included surplus and cooler consumed fish from fish handling offices still on the Spit, her very own buys utilizing her restricted assets from Social Security or retirement advantages, or fish contributed by her supporters. Guests could come and watch the falcons Keene benefited from the Spit at no expense, however were approached to remain in their vehicles for their own wellbeing and for the security of the birds. 

Keene's work has been promoted in "Peruser's Digest", "National Geographic", "The Washington Post", "Individuals", "Life", "Ripley's Believe It or Not!", and on The Rush Limbaugh Show. A 2004 book, "The Eagle Lady" by Alaska writer and picture taker Cary Anderson, reports Keene's life and her association with the hawks. Keene got the 2004 Lifetime Meritorious Service Award from the Bald Eagle Foundation. A considerable lot of Keene's most grounded supporters were nearby inn proprietors who got additional business in the typically drowsy winter season, and picture takers who had the capacity to utilize shrewd surrounding of shots so as to influence it to show up they were shooting hawks in nature. These picture takers profited from these works that they purchased Keene another house with a portion of the benefits. The news parody program "The Daily Show" provided details regarding its April 17, 2006 release that Homer had been overpopulated by bald eagles due in huge part to Keene's exercises. A group from the show went through two days in March 2006 shooting film for the show, including an encouraging session and meeting with Keene and meetings with other Homer inhabitants about Keene and the contention at that point in advancement about bolstering birds. 

A few preservationists were worried about the huge populace of hawks attracted to Homer by Keene. They trusted a few birds have been hurt because of their nature with individuals. Others were stressed over the spread of sickness or the adjustment in the winged creatures' common movements. Purportedly, some other flying creature populaces in the territory, for example, sandhill cranes, nut cases, and kittiwakes, have been driven out or executed by hawks, however there is no immediate proof. Truth be told, kittiwakes have expanded in the region to the level of establishing another state near Keene's home. As per an ABC News communicate, many Homer occupants presently consider the flying creatures a "hazard", as they have been known to cause fender benders and take pets. In a couple of cases, the flying creatures have been shot at. A law gone by the Homer City Council in 2006 precludes the nourishing of falcons inside as far as possible; in any case, the city committee allowed Keene an exception, giving her unique consent to keep bolstering bald eagles inside city limits until April 2010, at which time Keene would have been 86. 

Keene kicked the bucket at home on January 13, 2009, matured 85, from a respiratory condition. After her demise, the Homer city committee passed another goals prohibiting the encouraging of falcons, crows, ravens and other savage and forager fowls by any individual, powerful March 19, 2009. The goals' powerful date was deferred until spring out of worry that the flying creatures would either kick the bucket of starvation or become exceptionally forceful if the nourishing finished amidst winter.
