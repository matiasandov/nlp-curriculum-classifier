Until this point, these are the main discharged collections dependent on the first diversion's soundtrack, and were exclusively created by standard arrangement writer Nobuo Uematsu; his job for most of resulting collections has been filled by Masashi Hamauzu and Takeharu Ishimoto.

The soundtracks for every one of the titles in the gathering are incorporated into a collection, beginning with the collection arrival of the soundtrack to "Coming Children" that year. The next year, Nippon Crown discharged a soundtrack collection to relate with the computer game "", while Square Enix propelled a download-just gathering of music from the multiplayer method of the diversion, which was just discharged in Japan. After the dispatch of the amusement "" in 2007, Warner Music Japan delivered the title's soundtrack.

The first music got very positive surveys from faultfinders, who observed huge numbers of the tunes to be noteworthy and noticed the enthusiastic power of a few of the tracks. The gathering for different collections has been blended, with responses going from excited commendation to dissatisfaction. A few pieces from the soundtrack, especially "One-Winged Angel" and "Aeris' Theme", stay prominent and have been played out various occasions in symphonic show arrangement, for example, "Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy" and "Visit de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy". Music from the Original Soundtrack has been incorporated into masterminded collections and aggregations by Square just as outside gatherings. 

Nobuo Uematsu made the music out of "Conclusive Fantasy VII" in under one year, coordinating the amusement's improvement time, in spite of the fact that he had taken two years to make the soundtrack for the past title, "Last Fantasy VI". "Last Fantasy VII" was the principal diversion in the arrangement to be created for the PlayStation, and keeping in mind that the media abilities of the comfort took into account CD quality music, Uematsu selected rather to utilize MIDI sounds. This choice has been credited as giving the soundtrack "an exceptionally particular state of mind and feel", framing a solid relationship for audience members between the diversion and its soundtrack. The music was rendered utilizing the support's local sound chip as opposed to being fused onto the plate because of predominant by and large stable quality: while the SNES had just eight sound channels, the PlayStation had twenty-four. Eight were saved for audio cues, leaving sixteen accessible for the music. Uematsu had at first intended to utilize CD quality music with vocal exhibitions for the diversion to exploit the reassure's abilities, yet discovered that the propelled sound quality thusly influenced the amusement to have any longer stacking occasions in every zone. Uematsu chose that the quality was not worth the effects on ongoing interaction, however after the discharge and seeing "Suikoden II" (1998, PlayStation), which had utilized higher-quality music rather, he turned around his position for "Conclusive Fantasy VIII". There was an arrangement to utilize a "popular vocalist" for the completion topic to the amusement as a "signature melody" for the diversion, yet the move to MIDI, alongside time requirements and topical concerns, made the thought be dropped. Uematsu has expressed, in any case, that the move into the "PlayStation period", which permitted computer game writers to utilize sounds recorded in the studio as opposed to from synthesizers, had "unquestionably been the greatest change" to video diversion music. 

Uematsu's way to deal with creating the amusement's music was to treat it like a film soundtrack and make tunes that mirrored the disposition of the scenes instead of attempting to make solid songs to "characterize the diversion", as he felt that approach would go over too solid when set close by the diversion's new 3D visuals. For instance, he made the track proposed for the scene in the diversion where Aerith Gainsborough is murdered to be "dismal yet delightful", instead of all the more obviously enthusiastic, making what he feels is a progressively downplayed inclination. Uematsu has furthermore said that the soundtrack has a vibe of "authenticity", which additionally kept him from utilizing "extravagant, insane music".

Uematsu moved toward the piece, which goes with the last clash of the diversion, in an unexpected way in comparison to past "supervisor tracks": as he felt that utilizing his ordinary methodology would make troublesome examinations his generally welcomed "Last Fantasy VI" manager tracks, he rather attempted to adopt an alternate strategy. Motivated by "The Rite of Spring" by Igor Stravinsky to make an increasingly "traditional" track, and by shake and move music from the late 1960s and mid 1970s to make an instrumental track with a "damaging effect", he went through about fourteen days creating short detached melodic expressions, and after that organized them together into a tune, a methodology he has never utilized or since. The verses of "One-Winged Angel", a Latin choral track that plays at the peak of the amusement, were taken from the medieval verse that shapes the premise of Carl Orff's "Carmina Burana", explicitly "Estuans Interius", "O Fortuna", "Veni, Veni, Venias" and "Ave Formosissima". Uematsu has expressed that the introduction of "One-Winged Angel" depends on Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze", that the piece spins around the picture of Sephiroth, and that in spite of the theme and ensemble, despite everything he considers it a "stone piece". He said in a 2005 meeting that "One-Winged Angel" is his most loved tune from the soundtrack, and in 2004 that it was his most loved fight subject from any "Last Fantasy" diversion.
