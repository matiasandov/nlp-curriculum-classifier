GISHWHES 

The Greatest International Scavenger Hunt the World Has Ever Seen (GISHWHES, articulated "gish-wes") is a yearly week-long aggressive media forager chase initially held every October or November, however more as of late every August. Groups of 15 contenders procure focuses for submitting photographs and recordings of themselves finishing prompts from a rundown they get toward the start of the week. On-screen character Misha Collins authoritatively established GISHWHES in 2011 after an attention trick to help the TV arrangement "Heavenly" (on which Collins shows up) win a People's Choice Award. The challenge holds a world record for being the biggest media scrounger chase ever to happen, and a few extra world records. On July 11, 2017, Collins declared that the 2017 chase is to be the last cycle of GISHWHES in its present organization. 

On-screen character Misha Collins, known for playing the holy messenger Castiel on the American TV arrangement "Extraordinary", is the author of GISHWHES. The challenge started casually in 2010 when Holly Ollis, a marketing expert for Warner Bros., requested that Collins draw in his group of onlookers to enable "Otherworldly" to move from second spot to first in the People's Choice Awards casting a ballot. Collins posted a message on Twitter, pronouncing that if the show won, Ollis had guaranteed him a rhinoceros which he would impart to everybody who helped by voting in favor of the show. Whenever "Heavenly" won the challenge, Collins, incompletely propelled by his time at the University of Chicago as an undergrad amid which he took an interest in the school's yearly scrounger chase, requested that his adherents send him self-tended to stepped envelopes into which he put forager chase prompts composed on the backs of jigsaw bewilder pieces from a riddle delineating a rhino. Before long, members started to react to Collins' "ludicrous" demands. One effective brief, for instance, provoked fans to photo a gathering of fire fighters wearing only kale. 

Collins appreciated this activity so much that he chose to make an official forager chase in 2011. He built up the occasion's site and gave it its name, the Greatest International Scavenger Hunt the World Has Ever Seen, calling its abbreviation, GISHWHES, "the ugliest abbreviation the world has ever observed". As per Collins, the essential explanation behind building up the challenge was that he "cherished the possibility of thousands of individuals from everywhere throughout the world interfacing with make mind blowing things". He would have liked to utilize GISHWHES to empower members "to do great on the planet". The debut occasion, arranged by "Guinness World Records" as a "media scrounger chase", broke the record for the biggest forager chase of its sort. In 2012, it broke its very own record with 14,580 members, speaking to 69 distinct nations. The challenge broke two extra world records in 2013: the longest self clasping pin chain, estimating , and the biggest online photograph collection of embraces, totaling 108,121 pictures. 

On the primary day of the week-long challenge, a rundown is posted on the GISHWHES site with more than 150 unique undertakings for contenders to finish amid the chase, which Collins and his companions, including co-facilitator Jean Louis Alexander, have conceived preceding the start of the challenge. Groups at that point submit photographs or recordings of themselves finishing the prompts at the challenge's site, accepting focuses for every thing finished. While strict translations of prompts are favored, judges will now and then honor focuses for particularly imaginative reactions. Prizes for the group with the most focuses toward the finish of GISHWHES have incorporated an excursion to Scotland for a sleep party with Collins and a trek to Vancouver for a "Viking shock". 

Groups comprise of 15 individuals who may originate from various nations. People may prearrange groups or sign up separately, in which case they are haphazardly gathered into properly estimated groups. As of the 2013 challenge, information exchange costs ran $19 per individual with part of the cooperation charges going towards Random Acts, a non-benefit kept running by Collins that intends to empower arbitrary demonstrations of benevolence. 

In 2018 the challenge was rebranded under the name Greatest International Scavenger Hunt (GISH), and included a free application that can be downloaded to have data in a more straightforward and direct design, and to legitimately visit with others in their group or near their area. 

GISHWHES challenges shift broadly in center and at times draw in media consideration. The Los Angeles-centered "OC Weekly" wrote about a neighborhood frozen yogurt shop's reaction to a GISHWHES group that requested that they make a custom dessert season for the 2013 test "Get your group's new dessert enhance marked down in a dessert parlor". Another test included members utilizing and getting the message out "abnosome", Collins' portmanteau of "irregular" and "wonderful". Amid the 2013 chase, contenders were approached to take on the appearance of the DC Comics character Flash and have their photos taken alongside a working atom smasher. Therefore, the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and Fermilab got various messages from GISHWHES members and set up uncommon visits for the guests. Senior member Golembeski announced in "Symmetry", the official magazine of Fermilab and the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, that the visits were invited and seen as a chance to instruct a more extensive group of onlookers on the objectives of and investigate done at national labs. 

Most GISHWHES challenges are finished effectively by something like one group, as per Collins. Amid the 2012 challenge, for instance, just a single thing saw no triumphs: covering a business airship with fall leaves. Collins conjectured it fizzled in light of physical constraints. A 2013 test noted by "ÄÂcrans", a French site kept running by "LibÄÅ¡ration", provoked contenders to persuade space explorers on the International Space Station to snap a picture holding a sign with their group's name. Endeavors by members were taken off by NASA, which posted that the space explorers were unfit to take an interest on its official Twitter account. 

Parts of the challenges have been generally welcomed by certain news sources. An author for Nerdist.com considered it a "torrential slide of magnificence" and contrasted the chase's abbreviation with "a fanciful GWAR collection or a lesser god in H.P. Lovecraft's consonant-loaded pantheon". Exploring the experience of taking an interest in GISHWHES, an author for Detroit's WKBD-TV portrayed the challenge as "a great deal of fun" and prescribed that others take part later on. "Shanghai Daily" considered a few of GISHWHES's difficulties "over the top" and "outwardly staggering". Laura Prudom of "The Huffington Post" complimented Collins' "considerable" endeavors in sorting out the occasion. 

Not the sum total of what gathering has been sure. Todd VanDerWerff composed for "Vox" that, "Many of the things fundamentally welcome members to pesterÃ¢ÂÂor even harassÃ¢ÂÂthe well known and semi-celebrated on Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook." A 2014 test requested that seekers persuade distributed sci-fi writers to compose a 140-character story for them and a few, for example, John Scalzi and Lauren DeStefano, whined that the errand urged members to hassle them on interpersonal organizations. 

In an article dissecting Collins' association with his fanbase, Middlebury College Assistant Professor Louisa Ellen Stein contended that GISHWHES was a "co-composed transmedia experience" that "play[ed] with [the] power, erotics, and passionate overabundance present in Collins' being a fan." Citing members' free endeavors to arrange groups utilizing an assortment of online stages, Stein recommended that "GISHWHES may come up short on the obvious language of mechanical reconfiguration found in the "Divine" Kickstarter Project [a webseries that Collins drew in his fans to help fund]. In any case, through its parody and dadaist play, it all the more completely models the potential for a gathering of creators, both official and informal, to coordinate fannish and inventive venture into computerized interest." Stein further contended that "decentralized undertakings like Gishwhes, with makers who completely submerge themselves in the encompassing advanced societies, demonstrate to us the potential for future transmedia imaginative initiation in millennial culture." 

GISHWHES has broken a few Guinness World Records.
