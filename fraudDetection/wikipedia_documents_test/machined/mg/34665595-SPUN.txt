For the show at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London, James Robertson of "Day by day Mirror" gave the band a positive survey. He expresses, "The room shook with hair raising, ear drum penetrating and (if there had been windows) glass-breaking shouts.

They looked agreeable. No senseless movement, only a couple of troupe clench hand siphons. No silly outfits, just letterman coats, cardigans and khakis. A straightforward sponsorship band Ã¢ÂÂ guitar, bass, consoles and drums Ã¢ÂÂ gave relentless interpretations of about the majority of the tunes on the gathering's presentation collection, "Up All Night", just as a couple of spreads, including Kings of Leon's "Utilization Somebody" and Natalie Imbruglia's "Torn."

Lau furthermore noted One Direction's absence of unique material to play out, "the gathering falls back on a bunch of spreads to fill in their set, including Kings of Leon's "Utilization Somebody", Gym Class Heroes' "Stereo Hearts" and, shockingly, Natalie Imbruglia's "Torn". Not straying excessively far from the firsts, the mid-show variety certainly felt like the young men arbitrarily belting out melodies for filler however young ladies wouldn't fret."
