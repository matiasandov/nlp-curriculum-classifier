The ship was dispatched into the Prussian Navy in October 1867. The ship was the third ironclad arranged by the Prussian Navy, after and , however the fourth ship to be obtained, , was requested after yet authorized before "Friedrich Carl". 

"Friedrich Carl" presented with the armada from her appointing in 1867 until 1895, when she was expelled from forefront administration to fill in as a preparation dispatch. Amid the Franco-Prussian War in 1870Ã¢ÂÂ1871, the ship shaped piece of the principle German squadron instructed by Vice Admiral Jachmann. Motor inconvenience, be that as it may, tormented the ship and two of the other three vessels in the squadron; therefore, they made just two forays from the port of Wilhelmshaven to challenge the French barricade. Neither brought about battle. 

"Friedrich Carl" was likewise sent to Spain amid a rebellion in 1873, amid which she aided the seizure of three renegade vessels in two commitment. The ship was refitted at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven during the 1880s. She was renamed "Neptun" in 1902 and utilized as a harbor deliver until June 1905, when she was expelled from the maritime register. The next year, she was sold to send breakers in the Netherlands and disassembled for scrap. 

"Friedrich Carl" was long at the waterline and long in general. She had a light emission a draft of forward and toward the back. The ship was intended to uproot at an ordinary stacking, and up to with a battle load. The ship's structure was developed with transverse and longitudinal iron edges. It contained eight watertight compartments and a twofold base that kept running for 76Ã¢Â percent of the length of the vessel. 

"Friedrich Carl" was a phenomenal ocean vessel; the ship was receptive to directions from the rudder and had a moderate turning span. She was to some degree unequal, in any case, and a 6Ã¢Â degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a straight course. The ship's team numbered 33 officers and 498 enrolled men, and keeping in mind that filling in as a lead, the group was enlarged with an order staff of 6 officers and 35 enrolled men. "Friedrich Carl" conveyed various littler vessels, including an extensive delicate, two dispatches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy. 

An even two-chamber single extension steam motor controlled the ship. It drove a four-bladed sink width. Six trunk boilers, isolated into two engine compartments with 11 fireboxes in each, provided steam to the motor at . The drive framework was appraised at and a top speed of , however on preliminaries "Friedrich Carl" figured out how to make and . The ship conveyed of coal, which empowered a most extreme scope of at a cruising pace of . A barque rig with a surface region of 2,010Ã¢Â square meters enhanced the steam motor, however in administration they added little to the ship's execution. Directing was controlled with a solitary rudder. 

As constructed, "Friedrich Carl" was furnished with twenty-six rifled 72-pounder gun. After her conveyance to Germany, these firearms were supplanted with a couple of L/22 weapons and fourteen 21Ã¢Â cm L/19 weapons. The L/22 weapon could discourage to Ã¢ÂÂ5Ã¢Â degrees and raise to 13Ã¢Â degrees, which gave a scope of . The shorter surged L/19 weapons had a more extensive scope of height, from Ã¢ÂÂ8 to 14.5Ã¢Â degrees, yet the shorter barrel forced a lower gag speed, which correspondingly decreased the scope of the firearm to . The two sorts of weapon discharged a similar shell, of which the all out supply numbered 1,656Ã¢Â rounds of ammo. The fourteen L/19 firearms were put in a focal battery amidships, seven on either broadside. The L/22 firearms were put on either end of the ship.

"Friedrich Carl"s protective layer comprised of fashioned iron sponsored with substantial teak planking. The waterline shielded belt comprised of iron supported with of teak. The focal battery was ensured by 114Ã¢Â mm of slanted iron plating on of timber. The battery's rooftop was ensured by thick iron plating. The ship's conning tower had 114Ã¢Â mm thick iron protective layer mounted on of teak. 

The Prussian Navy requested "Friedrich Carl" from a French shipbuilder in 1865. She was set down at the "SocietÄÅ¡ Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers La Seyne" shipyard in Toulon the next year. The ship was propelled on 16 January 1867; fitting out work was finished quickly, and the ship was finished before the year's end. "Friedrich Carl" was conveyed to Prussia in October 1867 and dispatched into the armada on the third of the month. 

At the episode of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the enormously numerically second rate Prussian Navy accepted a protective stance against a maritime barricade forced by the French Navy. "Friedrich Carl" and the broadside ironclads and , alongside the little ironclad slam , had been steaming in the English Channel before the French announced war; they had left Plymouth on 10 July with the expectation of steaming to Fayal in the Azores. On the thirteenth, be that as it may, they put into port and learned of the rising strain among France and Prussia. The boats in this manner came back to Wilhelmshaven promptly, touching base on 16 July. France announced war on Prussia three days after the fact on 19 July. "Friedrich Carl", "Kronprinz", and "KÄÅnig Wilhelm" were gathered in the North Sea at the port of Wilhelmshaven. They were along these lines joined there by the turret dispatch , which had been positioned in Kiel. 

In spite of the incomparable French maritime predominance, the French had led deficient pre-war anticipating a strike on the Prussian maritime establishments, and reasoned that it would just be conceivable with Danish help, which was not pending. The four boats, under the order of Vice Admiral Jachmann, made a hostile foray toward the beginning of August 1870 out to the Dogger Bank, however they experienced no French warships. "Friedrich Carl" and the other two broadside ironclads from there on experienced incessant motor inconvenience, which left "Arminius" alone to direct tasks. "Friedrich Carl", "Kronprinz", and "KÄÅnig Wilhelm" remained off the island of Wangerooge for most of the contention, while "Arminius" was positioned in the mouth of the Elbe stream. On 11 September, the three broadside ironclads were again good to go; they joined "Arminius" for another significant task into the North Sea. It also did not experience French restriction, as the French Navy had at this point come back to France. 

In mid 1873, the First Spanish Republic was assailed with the Cantonal Revolution. "Friedrich Carl", under the direction of Vice Admiral Reinhold Werner, steamed to Spanish waters alongside a couple of unarmored vessels. The boats joined a British squadron that had been watching the southern Spanish coast. A renegade group of the Spanish Navy had caught four of the nation's seven ironclads. Chief of naval operations Werner, the senior leader in the gathering, was given direction of the Anglo-German power. The squadron barricaded two radical ironclads in the port of Cartagena after they had assaulted a beach front town. While steaming off Alicante, "Friedrich Carl" experienced the radical furnished steamer "Vigilante", caught the vessel, and returned it to the national government. 

"Friedrich Carl" and the British ironclad assaulted two of the radical shipsÃ¢ÂÂ"Vitoria" and "Almansa"Ã¢ÂÂwithout approval from London or Berlin. The dissident vessels had endeavored to blackmail the port of AlmerÄÂ­a. In the concise commitment, the Anglo-German power overpowered the radicals and caught the two boats, which were in this manner swung over to the Spanish government. The radicals considered pronouncing war on Germany over the undertaking, however in the end ruled against it. A caught agitator pioneer was quickly hung on board "Friedrich Carl". Chief of naval operations Werner's bar in the long run constrained the agitators to surrender, after which "Friedrich Carl" came back to Germany. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck requested a court-military for Admiral Werner, whose activities Bismarck viewed as extreme. Bismarck denied the Imperial Navy from leading "gunboat strategy" later on. 

In 1885, "Friedrich Carl" had torpedo nets introduced; these stayed on the ship until 1897. In 1895, the ship was incapacitated; she was put into administration as a torpedo test send on 11 August of that year. She served in this limit until 21 January 1902, when she was renamed "Neptun" and utilized as a harbor dispatch. Her name was then liberated to be reused on the new heavily clad cruiser , which was propelled on 22 June 1902. "Neptun" was formally stricken from the maritime register on 22 June 1905 and sold to a Dutch ship-breaking firm in March 1906 for 284,000Ã¢Â gold imprints. The ship was then towed to the Netherlands and separated for scrap.
