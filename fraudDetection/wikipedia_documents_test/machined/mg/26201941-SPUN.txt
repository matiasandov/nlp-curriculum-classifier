In spite of the fact that Burton was driving close to the finish of the race, the alert was issued as Johnson was leaving pit path. It allowed Burton to put Johnson a lap down, yet Johnson entered the track in front of Burton. In the consequent question and answer session, Johnson stated, "Lucky came our direction.

Harvick, who completed second, stated, "When he climbed I got tight and captured the divider a smidgen. On the off chance that he doesn't climb, he gets passed pretty effectively.
