The German papers were among the numerous from crosswise over Europe that assaulted Schumacher. "Bild" said "Schumacher was to be faulted for the accident".

We are hanging tight for Ferrari to declare that it is tossing out Michael Schumacher and contracting another driver who is progressively astute, has more knowledge and a genuine feeling of profound quality." 

"La Repubblica" revealed that "seeing a world title evaporate in the wake of holding up 18 years is sufficiently tragic. In any case, to see it run up in smoke with the move from Michael Schumacher is lamentably much more terrible. It's despicable."

FIA president Max Mosley later declared "The interruption made humiliation and bother those exhibiting the trophies and hence, no further adjusts of the FIA Formula 1 World Championship will be held at the Jerez circuit." As of 2018, this race was the last time that Jerez facilitated a Formula One Grand Prix, in spite of the fact that it held numerous pre-season test days.

"Ron [Dennis] had made that manage Frank [Williams], which none of us knew anything about, that in the event that we helped Williams in their journey to beat Ferrari they wouldn't hinder helping McLaren. Ron would most likely still deny it today. That is what occurred."
