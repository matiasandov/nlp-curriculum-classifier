"Clutch Sixteen" got a blended gathering from analysts, however the music was all the more positively gotten. Robert Canning of IGN called it "very disappointing" and gave it an "alright" appraising of 6.5 out of 10; he noticed that challenge scenes, for example, this one invest more energy in execution, and regarded the non-execution portions "nonchalant". "Moving Stone" Erica Futterman portrayed "the lesson of the current week's story: grasp your childhood" as "pointless excess", however noticed that once the challenge started, the scene "prevailing disregarding itself". Amy Reiter of "The Los Angeles Times" considered it a "vibe decent scene" that came as an "enormous alleviation" after the show "had lost its ethical balance these most recent couple of weeks", and "AOLTV" Crystal Bell said it gave her "some expectation for the remainder of the period". Rae Votta of "Board" abridged the scene thusly: "Generally speaking, it was a "Joy" that felt like the plots were managed as quick as humanly conceivable to pack in as much singing and moving as we can." 

Numerous commentators disagreed with the improbable idea of a few plot focuses. Jen Chaney of "The Washington Post" denounced the "absence of essential rationale" in Sam being "ready to so effectively exchange back to McKinley", "Amusement Weekly" Abby West called attention to the "extensive measure of administrative work" required for a "minor to move in with noncustodial watchmen in another state and register for school", and Michael Slezak of "TVLine" was disturbed that Sam's folks did not build up who those gatekeepers would be, and how this would influence him scholastically. Futterman called attention to that "Mr. Schuester has again neglected to pick a set rundown early" notwithstanding "long stretches of falsification about getting ready for sectionals". Both Slezak and MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan were disinterested with Quinn's late-in-the-amusement thought to apply to so focused a school as Yale. 

There was some puzzlement communicated by a few commentators, including Raymund Flandez of "The Wall Street Journal" and Votta, concerning why Finn would think Sam had been such an incredible entertainer regardless that it was so imperative to bring him back. Notwithstanding that, Votta was satisfied by Sam's arrival as was Bell, who suspected it was one of the more agreeable parts of the scene. Sam's scene with Blaine, be that as it may, was met with analysis, however of Blaine's portrayal, not Sam's: "BuddyTV" John Kubicek brought up that Blaine "basically considers Sam a prostitute" and that "he resembles a totally unique individual". Vicki Hyman of "The Star-Ledger" depicted the scene as "quite bizarre" for Blaine, and "The Houston Chronicle" Bobby Hankinson said that the whole subplot, including Finn's hostility toward Blaine, was "so carelessly amassed" he was happy it was finished in the accompanying scene. The encounter among Kurt and Sebastian over Blaine was little commented onÃ¢ÂÂWest delighted in it, however said she had been seeking after additional. 

The finish of the Quinn/Shelby/Puck triangle and of "insane Quinn" was praised by Bell and Reiter. A few different analysts, including Kubicek, Slezak and Hyman, were exceptionally condemning of Shelby's inability to recognize that she was in the wrong for laying down with an understudy. Canning felt there was no probability that Quinn would really demolish Shelby and Beth's life, since she had neglected to finish in before scenes, so her danger to do as such needed show and was "empty". 

In spite of the fact that Sullivan was excited about Shum, who he said had "developed as a core of the show", he was not content with his character's "constrained storyline" in the scene. Canning noticed that Mike's storyline had "been somewhat hackneyed all season", however it had been "enjoyable to pull for him", yet he was confused by the absence of a "Mike Chang move grandstand" at the challenge to legitimize his dad's difference in heart. 

Rebecca Ford of "The Hollywood Reporter" was happy that the "tedious" split joy clubs were currently a solitary gathering once more, however Flandez called the last scene "too perfect to even consider being a closure". While numerous analysts, including Reiter, affirmed of the finish of the greater part of the period's storylines in this scene, Canning considered it a "pleasant little reset catch for a season that began off with guarantee however has neglected to convey recently", and Kubicek stated, "With the arrival of Sam, it's sort of like the initial seven scenes of the period never at any point occurred."

Canning considered the melody an "awful decision", and Ford composed that it "missed the mark". Futterman credited a "shockingly common nation twang from Sam", yet included that the "choir room execution feels for the most part stale". Votta could discover no sense in its incorporation, and considered it the "most irregular tune on "Happiness" since 'Run Joey Run, while Hankinson was harsher, and proclaimed it to be his "least most loved Glee execution ever". West, then again, said the tune was "ideal for Sam", and Overstreet's "smooth sultry voice nailed it". 

Amicability's execution with the Unitards got great imprints, if not excessively eager ones. Chaney said it was "fine" and gave it a "B", while Futterman expressed, "Agreement brings Latin pizazz and demonstrates that she's genuine vocal challenge, yet the melody in general has the unusual impact of inclination both over-the-top and watered down in the meantime." Kubicek called the execution "genuinely forgettable", while West and Slezak felt that it was anything but a show-choir introduction, however both gave it a "B+" grade: Slezak named it an "exhibit for a sololist with some sporty reinforcement artists", and West compared it to a "relax demonstration". Both Votta and Hyman were inspired with Harmony: Hyman portrayed her as "truly wonderful", and Votta said she was an "awesome artist". 

Sullivan was astonished that the "I Will Survive"/"Survivor" Troubletones execution "made the concoction a good time for a second time", and Bell called it "wonderful". Chaney described the Mercedes and Santana vocals as "solid", as did Votta, however both felt it was not comparable to the "Gossip Has It"/"Somebody Like You" blend two scenes earlier. Slezak gave the execution "An", and stated, "I adored that the Troubletones broke free of the standard-working joy club movement, and that thereÃ¢ÂÂs another incredible two part harmony to add to the Sancedes oeuvre." Flandez composed that it was "greatly all around done and very much arranged", with the exception of the bouncing jacks. Votta thought Blaine and Finn's triumphant clench hand knock amid the number appeared justified, however Slezak and Sullivan appeared to be unconvinced. 

The New Directions set of three Jackson family numbers was positively checked on by most pundits, however they didn't really concede to which melodies were best. Ringer couldn't choose whether she appreciated these three melodies or the Troubletones blend more, and West felt the "movement all in all thing was outstanding", and reviewed it an "A+". Votta singled out "ABC", which illustrated "what a dazzling vocalist Tina is", and Kubicek said he delighted in it "generally in light of the fact that Tina merits all the more singing time, and I cherish the way that Mike is currently a real artist who gets his own performances". Chaney called it "a strong execution" and gave it a B+, while Futterman composed that it "felt like a flashback to the New Directions' gathering exhibitions of days of old, when it was around a ludicrous, feel-great frame of mind". The moving in "Charge" was featured in numerous audits: Hyman and Slezak were complimentary, however Chaney composed that the "movement appeared somewhat ungainly and sometimes out of match up", that it was "the least viable of the three Jackson numbers" and included that for her "this felt dated when it could have been retro-new"; she reviewed the melody a "C". In any case, Futterman talked about the "smooth move moves", and Votta noticed that the "jazz band folks" were "standing their ground with the foundation moving through the entire number". Be that as it may, for Kubicek, the melody "certainly cut down the vitality at the center of their execution". Ringer portrayed the last melody as "an astounding 'Man in the Mirror' spread", and Chaney said it was "the best of their three tunes", and gave it an "AÃ¢ÂÂ". In any case, Slezak composed that it "turned out to be a tonally shaking completion of the execution". 

"We Are Young" was gotten with close widespread energy. Slezak called it "absolutely cheerful fun" and Chaney said it was "the most easily blissful snapshot of the night"; the two passed out "AÃ¢ÂÂ" and "A" grades separately. Futterman felt it was performed "with senseless soul", and was "another return to more straightforward and fruitful Glee minutes". Hankinson thought it was the best melodic number of the night, regardless of whether "it was quite reminiscent of their execution of 'Canine Days Are Over, however Kubicek thought the before tune was "a million times better". West considered it an "extraordinary shutting melody", and Votta said "the finale singing was the best sort of 'Merriment.
