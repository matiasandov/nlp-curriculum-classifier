Fortress of Erbil 

The Erbil Citadel, privately called Qalat ( ; ) is a tell or involved hill, and the chronicled downtown area of Erbil in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The stronghold has been engraved on the World Heritage List since 21 June 2014. 

The soonest proof for control of the fortress hill dates to the fifth thousand years BC, and conceivably prior. It shows up without precedent for recorded sources in the Ebla tablets around 2,300 BC, and increased specific significance amid the Neo-Assyrian time frame. Amid the Sassanian time frame and the Abbasid Caliphate, Erbil was a critical place for Christianity. After the Mongols caught the fortification in 1258, the significance of Erbil declined. Amid the twentieth century, the urban structure was essentially changed, because of which various houses and open structures were demolished. In 2007, the High Commission for Erbil Citadel Revitalization (HCECR) was set up to direct the rebuilding of the stronghold. Around the same time, all occupants, with the exception of one family, were removed from the fortress as a component of a substantial rebuilding venture. From that point forward, archeological research and rebuilding works have been completed at and around the tell by different worldwide groups and in participation with nearby experts. The administration intends to have 50 families live in the bastion once it is redesigned. 

The structures over the tell extend over a generally oval zone of involving . The main religious structure that presently endures is the Mulla Afandi Mosque. The hill ascends between from the encompassing plain. When it was completely involved, the fortress was separated in three regions or "mahallas": from east to west the Serai, the Takya and the Topkhana. The Serai was involved by remarkable families; the Takya area was named after the homes of dervishes, which are classified "takyas"; and the Topkhana locale housed experts and ranchers. 

The site of the bastion may have been involved as right on time as the Neolithic time frame, as stoneware sections conceivably dating to that period have been found on the slants of the hill. Clear proof for occupation originates from the Chalcolithic time frame, with sherds looking like stoneware of the Ubaid and Uruk periods in the Jazira and southeastern Turkey, separately. Given this proof for early occupation, the fortification has been known as the most established ceaselessly involved site on the planet. 

Erbil shows up without precedent for artistic sources around 2300 BC in the files of Ebla. As indicated by Giovanni Pettinato, it is referenced in two tablets as "Irbilum". 

Afterward, Erridupizir, ruler of Gutium, caught the city in 2200 BC. 

Toward the finish of the third thousand years BC, Erbil is referenced in chronicled records of the Ur III period as Urbilum. Lord Shulgi decimated Urbilum in his 43rd regnal year, and amid the rule of his successor Amar-Sin, Urbilum was consolidated into the Ur III state. In the eighteenth century BC, Erbil shows up in a rundown of urban communities that were vanquished by Shamshi-Adad of Upper Mesopotamia and Dadusha of Eshnunna amid their crusade against the place that is known for Qabra. Shamshi-Adad introduced battalions in every one of the urban areas of the place where there is Urbil. Amid the second thousand years BC, Erbil was joined into Assyria. Erbil filled in as a point of takeoff for military battles toward the east. 

Erbil was an essential city amid the Neo-Assyrian time frame. The city partook in the extraordinary rebel against Shamshi-Adad V that broke out over the progression of Shalmaneser III. Amid the Neo-Assyrian time frame, the name of the city was composed as "Arbi-Ilu", signifying 'Four Gods'. Erbil was an essential religious focus that was contrasted and urban areas, for example, Babylon and Assur. Its goddess Ishtar of Erbil was one of the chief divinities of Assyria, frequently named together with Ishtar of Nineveh. Her haven was fixed by the rulers Shalmaneser I, Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal. Engravings from Assurbanipal record obscure dreams propelled by Ishtar of Erbil. Assurbanipal likely held court in Erbil amid part of his rule and got there emissaries from Rusa II of Urartu after the thrashing of the Elamite ruler Teumman. 

After the finish of the Assyrian Empire, Erbil was first constrained by the Medes and after that joined into the Achaemenid Empire before it turned out to be a piece of the realm of Alexander the Great after the Battle of Gaugamela, which was battled close Erbil in 331 BC. Along these lines, after the segment of Alexander the Great Empire by his commanders (known as Diadochoi), the city was called Arabella or Arbela and it was a piece of the Hellenistic Seleucid Kingdom. After the first c. BCE, the Roman and Parthian Empire battled about control of Erbil, or Arbira as it was known in that period. After the first c. Promotion, Arbela turned into a vital Christian focus. Amid the Sassanid time frame, Erbil was the seat of a satrap (representative). In 340 AD, Christians in Erbil were abused and in 358, the senator turned into a saint after he changed over to Christianity. A Nestorian school was established in Erbil by the School of Nisibis in "c". 521. Amid this period, Erbil was likewise the site of a Zoroastrian flame sanctuary. 

Erbil was vanquished by the Muslims in the seventh century. It remained a vital Christian focus until the ninth century, when the diocesan of Erbil moved his seat to Mosul. From the main portion of the twelfth century until 1233, Erbil was the seat of the Begteginids, a Turcoman tradition that rose to unmistakable quality under the rule of Zengi, the atabeg of Mosul. Muzaffar al-Din GÄÅkbÄÅri, the second dynast of the Begtegenid administration and a staunch supporter of Saladin, made a lower town around the city on the fortress hill and established clinics and madrasahs. GÄÅkburi passed on in 1233 without a beneficiary and control of Erbil moved to the Abbasid Caliph al-Mustansir after he had attacked the city. 

At the point when the Mongols attacked the Near East in the thirteenth century, they assaulted Erbil without precedent for 1237. They ravaged the lower town however needed to withdraw before a drawing nearer caliphal armed force and needed to put off the catch of the fortress. After the fall of Baghdad to HÄÅºlegÄÅº and the Mongols in 1258, they came back to Erbil and had the capacity to catch the fortress following an attack enduring a half year. HÄÅºlegÄÅº then selected a Christian senator to the town and there was a convergence of Jacobite Christians, who were permitted to manufacture a congregation. 

As time passed, mistreatments of Christians, Jews and Buddhists all through the Ilkhanate started vigorously in 1295 under OÄÅ¼rat amir Nauruz. This showed at an early stage in the rule of the Ilkhan Ghazan. In 1297, after Ghazan had felt sufficiently able to defeated Nauruz' impact, he put a stop to the mistreatments. 

Amid the rule of the Ilkhan ÄÂljeitÄÅº a portion of the Christian occupants withdrew to the bastion to escape oppression. In the spring of 1310, the Malek (senator) of the area endeavored to catch it from them with the assistance of the Kurds. Regardless of Mar Yahballaha's earnest attempts to deflect the looming fate, the fortress was finally taken by Ilkhanate troops on 1 July 1310, and every one of the protectors were slaughtered, including all the Christian occupants of the lower town. 

Amid the Ottoman time frame, Erbil was a piece of the region of Baghdad, which was built up in 1535. In 1743, the city was held for a brief timeframe by the Afsharid ruler Nader Shah following an attack enduring 60 days. An etching from 1820 demonstrates that around then both the bastion hill and the plain at its southern foot were involved. Mohammed Khor, a nearby Kurdish ask of Rowanduz, controlled Erbil for a brief period in 1862. In 1892, the town had roughly 3,200 occupants, including a sizeable Jewish minority. 

Amid the twentieth century, the fortress saw critical urban and social changes. A high steel water tank was raised on the fortress in 1924, giving the occupants sanitized water, yet in addition causing water harm to the establishments of the structures because of expanded water leakage. The quantity of occupants continuously declined over the twentieth century as the city at the foot of the fortification developed and wealthier occupants moved to bigger, present day houses with patio nurseries. In 1960, more than 60 houses, a mosque and a school were decimated to clear path for a straight street associating the southern entryway with the northern door. Some recreation works were conveyed in 1979 on the bastion's southern entryway and the "hammam". In 2007, the staying 840 families were expelled from the fortification as a major aspect of an extensive undertaking to reestablish and save the notable character of the bastion. These families were offered budgetary pay. One family was permitted to keep living on the fortification to guarantee that there would be no break in the conceivable 8,000 years of nonstop residence of the site, and the administration intends to have 50 families live in the bastion once it is remodeled. In 2004, the Kurdish Textile Museum opened its entryways in a redesigned manor in the southeast quarter of the fortress. 

The stronghold is arranged on a vast tell Ã¢ÂÂ or settlement hill Ã¢ÂÂ of generally oval shape that is between high. The territory over the hill measures and is substantial. Regular soil has been found at a profundity of beneath the present surface of the hill. The edge of the bastion hill's inclines is "c". 45Ã¢Â°. Three inclines, situated on the northern, eastern and southern slants of the hill, pave the way to doors in the external ring of houses. The southern door was the most established and was revamped in any event once, in 1860, and crushed in 1960. The present entryway house was built in 1979. The eastern entryway is known as the Harem Gate and was utilized by ladies. It appears to be hazy when the northern door was opened. One source asserts that it was opened in 1924, while another sees that there were just two entryways in 1944 Ã¢ÂÂ the southern and eastern doors. 

Amid the mid twentieth century, there were three mosques, two schools, two "takyas" and a hammam on the bastion. The fortification additionally housed a synagogue until 1957. The main religious structure that at present endures is the Mulla Afandi Mosque, which was reconstructed on the area of a prior nineteenth century mosque. The hammam was worked in 1775 by Qassim Agha Abdullah. It left administration amid the 1970s and was redesigned in 1979, albeit numerous unique engineering subtleties were lost. 

When it was as yet involved, the fortress was separated in three regions or "mahallas": from east to west the Serai, the Takya and the Topkhana. The Serai was involved by outstanding families; the Takya locale was named after the homes of dervishes, which are designated "takyas"; and the Topkhana region housed specialists and ranchers. A 1920 stock demonstrated that around then the fortress was separated into 506 house plots. From that point forward the quantity of houses and occupants has step by step declined. For instance, in 1984 4,466 individuals lived in 375 houses, while a 1995 evaluation demonstrated that the fortification had just 1,631 occupants living in 247 houses. Until the opening-up of the fundamental northÃ¢ÂÂsouth lane, the boulevards on the fortress hill emanated outward from the southern door like the parts of a tree. Roads were among wide and run long from for major back roads to for parkways. 

The border mass of the fortress is definitely not a ceaseless stronghold divider, however comprises of the faÄÂ§ades of roughly 100 houses that have been worked against one another. Since they have been based on or close to the precarious incline of the fortification hill, a significant number of these faÄÂ§ades were reinforced by supports to anticipate their breakdown or subsidence. There were around 30 city-royal residences; the greater part of them situated along the edge of the fortress. The most seasoned enduring house that can be safely dated through an engraving was worked in 1893. The most seasoned houses can be found on the southeastern side of the hill, though houses on the northern edge date to the 1930sÃ¢ÂÂ1940s. Prior to the presentation of current structure methods, most houses on the fortress were worked around a patio. A raised arcade neglecting the yard, a level rooftop and a bowed access to avert perspectives on the patio and the inside of the house were trademark components of the houses on the bastion. 

In 2006 and 2007, a group from the University of West Bohemia, together with Salahaddin University in Arbil, completed a broad overview and assessment of the whole fortification. As a major aspect of this venture, geodetic estimations of the stronghold were taken and these were joined with satellite symbolism, standard photographic symbolism and flying photos to make a guide and computerized 3D model of the bastion hill and the houses over it. Geophysical prospection was completed in certain zones of the fortification to identify hints of more seasoned engineering covered under the present houses. Archeological examinations incorporated an archeological overview on the western incline of the fortress hill, and the removal of a little test channel in the eastern piece of the stronghold. 

A Neo-Assyrian chamber tomb was found at the foot of the bastion hill amid development exercises in 2009. It was in this way uncovered by the neighborhood Antiquities Service and archeologists from the German Archeological Institute ("DAI"). The tomb was pillaged in ancient history yet contained stoneware dating to the eighth and seventh hundreds of years BC. The collaboration between the Antiquities Service and the DAI was proceeded with soon thereafter with a further examination of the tomb and with a little removal adjacent and geophysical study of the encompassing region, in which likewise understudies from Salahaddin University took an interest. These examinations uncovered the nearness of engineering most likely dating to the Neo-Assyrian time frame, just as more internments having a place with ensuing hundreds of years. 

In 2007, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) set up the High Commission for Erbil Citadel Revitalization (HCECR) to protect and reestablish the stronghold with the assistance of UNESCO. In addition to other things, the HCECR advocates the foundation of a zone stretching out up to from the stronghold in which building stature ought to be confined to around . This would guarantee the visual strength of the stronghold over its environment. 

On 02 April 2019, NASA has depicted the notable bastion is conceivably the most established persistently involved human settlement on Earth. 

On 8 January 2010, the HCECR and the Iraqi State Board for Antiquities and Heritage (SBAH) presented the Citadel of Erbil to the Iraqi Tentative List of locales that are considered for assignment as World Heritage Site. The accommodation expresses that "The Citadel is today a standout amongst the most emotional and outwardly energizing social locales in the Middle East as well as on the planet." Two further understandings between the HCECR and UNESCO were marked in March 2010, and it was revealed that Arbil Governorate will back the reclamation venture with US$13ÃÂ million. The main rebuilding works were done in June 2010. The Citadel was recorded on the World Heritage List on 21 June 2014. In January 2017, UNESCO demonstrated that the site could be expelled from the rundown because of the moderate advancement being made in the rebuilding program.
