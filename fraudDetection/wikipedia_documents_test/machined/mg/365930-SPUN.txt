Jason King of "Vibe" said the collection displayed a changed Spears, "no longer a young lady, and all the lady any man can deal with." In 2009, Amy Schriefer of NPR recorded the collection on The 50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade list. Calling it "an introduction on the sound of fly during the '00s", she regarded Spears as the perfect vehicle for an advanced sound, since she was all the while attempting to split far from her adolescent fly past. Schriefer adulated "Dangerous" and "Everytime", and furthermore expressed, "While the decade's history of VIP fixation, paparazzi voyeurism and clashed developments of female sexuality and parenthood are composed on Spears' body, the decade's history of perfectly made pop is composed on her assortment of work."
