It's the highest quality level and what some other innovation needs to coordinate to, however none have, as I would like to think. The message I needed to put out there was that nobody is removing anybody's computerized cameras. However, on the off chance that we need film to proceed as a choice, and somebody is chipping away at a major studio motion picture with the assets and the ability to demand [on] film, they should say as much. I felt as though I didn't utter a word, and afterward we began to lose that alternative, it would be a disgrace.
