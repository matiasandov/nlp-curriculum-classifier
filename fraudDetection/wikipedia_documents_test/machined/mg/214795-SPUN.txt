Hellfire Awaits 

Hellfire Awaits is the second studio collection by American whip metal band Slayer, discharged in March 1985 by Metal Blade Records. The band's 1983 introduction "Demonstrate No Mercy" wound up Metal Blade Records' most noteworthy selling discharge, and accordingly, maker Brian Slagel wanted to discharge a second Slayer collection. Keeping that in mind, Slagel financed an account spending plan ("Show No Mercy" was paid for by band individuals) and enrolled a few experienced makers to help in the studio. 

The melodious topics on "Damnation Awaits" incorporate hellfire and Satan, likewise with their introduction; the introduction of the title track played in reverse uncovers the rehashed expression "go along with us". Musically, the collection includes the band's most dynamic and assorted work contrasted with their past discharges, and as indicated by Kerry King, he and Jeff Hanneman were excited about Mercyful Fate at the time, which at that point prompted the more drawn out and increasingly dynamic tunes. Characterized as "powerful to future extraordinary metal acts," the most well known melodies from "Hellfire Awaits" were re-recorded by different underground metal groups and have showed up on a few tribute collections. 

Slayer's past collection, "Demonstrate No Mercy", wound up Metal Blade Records' most noteworthy selling discharge, selling 40,000 duplicates around the world; the achievement drove maker Brian Slagel to need to record another collection with them. Slagel procured maker Ron Fair, who worked for Chrysalis Records, and had seen the band perform live and making the most of their execution. On observing Slayer in the studio, Fair expressed, "Amazing, these folks are extremely furious," as he was unpracticed working with substantial metal artists. Slagel financed the collection, as a conspicuous difference to "Demonstrate No Mercy", which was financed by artist Tom Araya, who utilized his profit as a respiratory advisor, and an advance from guitarist Kerry King's dad. 

The monetary allowance composed by Slagel considered proficient help. Bernie Grundman gave sound acing, Eddy Schreyer chipped away at remastering, and Bill Metoyer, who took a shot at the band's before discharge "Frequenting the Chapel", went about as sound architect. The account highlighted sound impacts, for example, the introduction to "Damnation Awaits", a turned around chronicle of a wicked sounding voice rehashing "Go along with us", finishing with "Welcome back". All things considered, Araya later expressed the collection had poor generation quality: "These days, creation insightful, it's so under standard. Be that as it may, for what it was at the time, those are astounding records to me. I surmise we could go in and re-try it. In any case, why ruin it?" 

Drummer Dave Lombardo, then again, attests the collection was expertly done contrasted with "Demonstrate No Mercy": "I didn't need to overdub the cymbals, and we had a great designer." Lombardo's main tune is "At Dawn They Sleep", "since it was somewhat moderate and grungy, yet then it had that twofold bass part toward the end." While recording the track, neither guitarists King or Jeff Hanneman who composed the verses were in the studioÃ¢ÂÂonly Araya and Slagel. On perusing the verses, which included an incorrectly spelled word, Araya sang it as it was spelled, despite the fact that it is anything but a genuine word. The melody "Solidifying of the Arteries" on the collection closes with the a fundamentally the same as area that makes up the start of the tune "Damnation Awaits" and is additionally one of the main Slayer tunes to become dim on a ceaseless riff. 

To advance "Damnation Awaits", Slayer left on the Combat Tour with Venom and Exodus. Mass migration guitarist Gary Holt remarked, "We quickly reinforced with the Slayer folks. It was two groups of companions playing with one band of saints, you know? We were simply captivated." 

Inside Venom's visit transport (the first run through Slayer had been in one) the band individuals got alcoholic with Venom, while tuning in to "Damnation Awaits". Araya entered the transport "pounded crazy," as indicated by Lombardo, saying "I gotta take a piss! Where's the restroom in this thing?" Venom artist Conrad "Cronos" Lant reacted, saying "Right hereÃ¢ÂÂright here in my mouth!" Araya took it actually and peed on his hair. Cronos got up and punched him in the face, the two accused each other throughout the night, and Araya proceeded with the visit with a bruised eye. Araya won't talk about the episode other than saying that he was tanked and it was a discourteous activity. 

In spite of the fact that it didn't enter any outlines, "Hellfire Awaits" was hailed upon its discharge as Slayer's most dynamic account, including a lot darker whip situated style, with irregular courses of action, for example, differing beats, and discordant subtleties that "made ready to a completely particular sound all their own," as indicated by AllMusic analyst Eduardo Rivadavia. Rivadavia granted the collection four out of five stars, saying that it was "unbelievably relatively revolutionary" and alluded to it as "an obligatory thing in the band's surprising discography". It has sold more than 1,000,000 records overall as per Brian Slagel.

The book, an order of the extraordinary guitarists of shake which incorporates both Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, watched the band's development in examination with their past collection, "Demonstrate No Mercy", saying, "The musicianship is improved, as is lead artist Tom Araya's voice, making the band sound less like hacks and progressively like metal devils. The sludgy riffs, which were unadulterated [Black] Sabbath, are balanced by a portion of King's and Hanneman's quicker performances, giving Slayer entrÄÅ¡e into the speed metal domain." 

Artists, for example, artist Phil Anselmo and drummer Gene Hoglan refer to "Hellfire Awaits" as an impact. AnselmoÃ¢ÂÂknown for his work with Pantera, Down, and Superjoint RitualÃ¢ÂÂexplained in a meeting with D. X. Ferris, writer of the book about the collection "Reign in Blood", that ""Hell Awaits" just holds the whole thing. All of everything to do with substantial music. [Slayer] are divine beings, the best band from California, without a doubt." Norwegian performer Frode Sivertsen (otherwise called "E. N. Passing"), previous individual from the dark metal band Gehenna, says the tune "Damnation Awaits" and Slayer's music when all is said in done has impacted him as a performer, positioning the collection in his best five.
