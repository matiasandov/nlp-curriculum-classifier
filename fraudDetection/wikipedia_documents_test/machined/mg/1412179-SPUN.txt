In the good 'ol days, the understudies made ink for pens from elderberry squeeze, and pencils from consumed wood; they approached nearby organizations for furniture.

Plainly the understudy required quick therapeutic consideration, yet there was no neighborhood emergency clinic to take her to that would treat dark individuals. Bethune requested that the white doctor at the nearby emergency clinic help the young lady. At the point when Bethune went to visit her understudy, she was approached to enter through the secondary passage. At the emergency clinic, she found that her understudy had been ignored, not well thought about and isolated on an open air patio. 

Out of this experience, Bethune chose that the dark network in Daytona required a medical clinic.
