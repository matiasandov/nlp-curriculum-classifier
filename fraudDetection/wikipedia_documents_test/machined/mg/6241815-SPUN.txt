Haapsalu Castle (additionally Haapsalu Episcopal Castle, , or all the more basically "Religious administrator's Castle") is a palace with house of God in Haapsalu, Estonia, established in the thirteenth century as the seat of the Bishopric of ÄÂsel-Wiek. As indicated by legend, amid full moons in August, a picture of a lady, The White Lady, shows up on the internal mass of the house of prayer. 

In 1228, the Archbishop of Riga, Albert of Riga framed another ward comprising of LÄÂ¤ÄÂ¤nemaa, Saaremaa and Hiiumaa and assigned Gottfried, an abbot of DÄÅºnamÄÅºnde Cistercian religious community, as the cleric. The ward was made as a condition of the Holy Roman Empire on 1 October 1228, by Henry, King of the Romans. Ecclesiastical legate Wilhelm of Modena fixed these outskirts for all time in 1234. The primary living arrangement of the Bishopric of ÄÂsel-Wiek was situated in Lihula Castle, where with the assistance of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, a fortress was worked of stone. While trying to maintain a strategic distance from clashes with the persuasive Order, the Bishop exchanged the bishopric's living arrangement to Perona, where it was singed by Lithuanians ten years after the fact. Another middle for the ward was picked in Haapsalu, where an Episcopal fortification and church were begun. Working of the palace continued for three centuries. 

Development, augmenting and recreation of the fortification went on consistently, with the design changing as indicated by the improvement of weapons. The fortress accomplished its last measurements Ã¢ÂÂ zone of in excess of 30,000 square meters, thickness of the divider among , and most extreme stature over Ã¢ÂÂ under the rule of Bishop Johannes IV Kievel (1515Ã¢ÂÂ1527). The western side of the stronghold houses a watchtower dating from the thirteenth century, later utilized as a chime tower. The dividers were later raised to . 

The internal channels and blindages, which were worked for guns and as a sanctuary from shelling, go back to the Livonian War (1558Ã¢ÂÂ1582), however it was amid this war the fortress was seriously harmed. The dividers of the little palace and the external stronghold were left mostly pulverized. 

In the seventeenth century, the manor was never again utilized as a protective structure by the Swedes who currently controlled the Swedish Estonian Province. Over the span of the Great Northern War in 1710, Estonia fell under Russian guideline and the dividers were mostly annihilated at the direction of the Peter I of Russia, transforming the manor as a result into remnants. 

The Cathedral of Haapsalu was a house of prayer (for example the primary church) of the Bishopric of ÄÂsel-Wiek, where the position of royalty, the official seat of the Bishop, was arranged and where the Chapter of the Bishopric worked. It is the greatest single-naved church in the Baltic nations, with its - high domical vaults and a region of . 

The primary composed record of the congregation is the contract of Haapsalu where Bishop Hermann I, the author of the town composed: "...we, the ones having built up the house of prayer in Haapsalu and having furnished our groups with the fitting abodes and salary, decided a specific site to be, where everyone who has picked it as their place of living respectively with us, could accumulate and discover cover there; and if necessary would most likely shield the congregation with every one of the methods available to them." 

Worked in 1260, the congregation has a place with the change time frame from Romanesque to Gothic engineering. The first is portrayed by the plant decoration of the capital of the pilasters and the second by star (space rock) vaults. The entrance was likewise initially Romanesque Ã¢ÂÂ the vimperg on the round curve had a specialty with the figure of the supporter holy person. The internal dividers were secured with works of art, the floor comprising of the tombstones of priests and recognized aristocrats. A one of a kind round baptismal house of prayer was worked in the second 50% of the fourteenth century. 

Amid the Livonian War, Estonia turned out to be a piece of the Lutheran Swedish kingdom. The Catholic Dome Church turned into a congregation with a Lutheran assembly and was then called the Castle Church. In 1625, the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf sold the town of Haapsalu, the chÃ¢teau and the close-by land property to Count Jacob De la Gardie, who wanted to transform the weather beaten fortress into a cutting edge manor. Arent Passer, an outstanding stone carver and ace developer, was welcomed as a specialist. 

On March 23, 1688, the sheet-copper top of the congregation was demolished in a flame, yet the congregation was reestablished moderately rapidly. The tempest in 1726 demolished the rooftop once more. The diminished assembly couldn't manage the cost of the redesign and moved to the town church. In the nineteenth century, the remaking of the vestiges into a sentimental mansion park was begun. 

In 1886Ã¢ÂÂ1889, the congregation was redesigned and remade. The demolished Romanesque-style entrance was supplanted by the pseudo-Gothic "ventured gateway", the surviving sections of the divider works of art were secured over, and the gravestones were removed from the congregation. On October 15, 1889 the primary administration devoted to Saint Nicholas was held. 

The Soviet occupation in 1940 prompted the end of the congregation. Amid World War II, administrations were proceeded, however in the spring of 1944 convicts broke into the congregation and annihilated the special raised area with the altarpiece, the organ, the seats and the windows. In 1946, the assembly requested that the Soviet government list the Cathedral as an ensured verifiable landmark, however it neglected to raise their advantage. The congregation was vacant for a considerable length of time; for quite a while it was utilized for putting away grain, even designs for transforming it into a pool were made. 

On Mother's Day of 1992, a MotherÃ¢ÂÂs Altar to celebrate Estonian moms killed amid the Soviet occupation was blessed. The statue of the Virgin and the Child was made by the stone worker Hille Palm. 

On full moon evenings in August a picture of a lady, The White Lady, is said to show up on the inward mass of the house of prayer. 

Amid the rule of ÄÂsel-Wiek Bishop, each standard should lead a modest and temperate life as per the tenets of the cloister. Access of ladies to the Episcopal Castle was illegal by risk of death. A legend tells that a group began to look all starry eyed at an Estonian young lady and brought furtively the lady into the stronghold. She covered up by dressing as a choirboy and remained a mystery for quite a while, yet when the religious administrator visited Haapsalu once more, the youthful artist grabbed his eye and he requested an examination of the vocalist's sex. 

After finding the young lady, the religious administrator called his committee and it chose that the young lady ought to be immured in the mass of the sanctuary and the group was to be placed in jail where he was famished to death. The developers left a depression into the divider and the poor young lady with a bit of bread and a cup of water was separated. For quite a while her weeps for help were heard. However her spirit couldn't discover the harmony and, accordingly, she shows up on the BaptisteryÃ¢ÂÂs window to lament for her cherished man as of now for a considerable length of time, and furthermore to demonstrate the eternality of affection. 

The White Lady Days music celebration is held at the season of the August full moon.
