Spread craftsman Stanley Donwood said that though "In Rainbows" was "especially an authoritative proclamation", the band needed to make a collection that was increasingly "transient". Multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood stated: "We would not like to get guitars and compose harmony groupings. We would not like to sit before a PC either. We needed a third thing, which included playing and programming." 

While Radiohead created "In Rainbows" from their live exhibitions, "The King of Limbs" created from studio experimentation. Yorke looked to move further from traditional chronicle strategies. After he and Godrich wound up keen on DJing amid their time in Los Angeles, Godrich proposed a fourteen day explore whereby the band utilized turntables and vinyl imitating programming rather than customary instruments. As indicated by Godrich, "That fourteen day analyze wound up being screwing a half year. What's more, thatÃ¢ÂÂs that record, the entire story of every last bit of it."

Guitarist Ed O'Brien told "Moving Stone": "The block dividers we would in general hit were the point at which we realized something was incredible, similar to 'Blossom', however not completed ... At that point [Colin Greenwood] had that bassline, and Thom began singing. Those things all of a sudden made it a hundred times better."
