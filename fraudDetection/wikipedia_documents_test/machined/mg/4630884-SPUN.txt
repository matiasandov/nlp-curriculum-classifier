Marta Kauffman included discourse focusing six characters being as one out of a room made the occasion exceptional work. While talking about story thoughts, the essayists chose to make "a group of little pieces", until somebody recommended "imagine a scenario in which it's the most exceedingly bad Thanksgivings?", later utilized as the snare. Chipping away at a flashback implied the scene required "to have signifying" as the story proceeds in the present. It was hard to keep the characters, especially Chandler, immediately distraught for something that happened "years back". The comedic content was greater than expected, on the grounds that Phoebe's arm was brushed off and Joey's head stuck in a turkey.

To pardon the coherence blunder, Bright includes they don't recall each other gathering since they appear to be unique. 

An extraordinary elastic and froth turkey was made for Joey and Monica to put on their heads for clean and protection reasons. A weaving, undetectable to the group of onlookers, was set amidst the turkey to enable the character to see. Chandler's "herd of seagulls" haircut, referenced in a past scene, depended on the 1980s timeframe. For security, the scene where Monica disjoined Chandler's toe was pre-shot. Initially the sound of a blade slicing through Chandler's shoe was put, yet as per Crane it "got excessively realistic". Emotional music was named over.
