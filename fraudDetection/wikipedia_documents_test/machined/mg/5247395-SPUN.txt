Bretagne-class ship 

The "Bretagne"- class ships were the principal "super-gunboats" worked for the French Navy amid the First World War. The class included three vessels: "Bretagne", the lead ship, "Provence", and "Lorraine". They were an improvement of the past , and mounted ten firearms rather than twelve weapons as on the "Courbet"s. A fourth was arranged by the Greek Navy, however work was suspended because of the flare-up of the war. The three finished boats were named after French areas. 

The three boats saw restricted administration amid World War I, and were basically busy with containing the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Sea. After the war, they led preparing travels in the Mediterranean and took an interest in non-mediation watches off Spain amid the Spanish Civil War. After the flare-up of World War II, the boats were entrusted with caravan obligations and hostile to business thief watches until the fall of France in June 1940. "Bretagne" and "Provence" were sunk by the British Royal Navy amid the Attack on Mers-el-KÄÅ¡bir the next month; "Provence" was later raised and towed to Toulon, where she was again left in November 1942. "Lorraine" was incapacitated by the British in Alexandria and recommissioned in 1942 to present with the Free French Naval Forces. She gave gunfire support amid Operation Dragoon, the intrusion of southern France, and shelled German posts in northern France. She made due as a gunnery preparing ship and a coasting garisson huts until the mid 1950s, before being separated for scrap in 1954. "Bretagne" and "Provence" were rejected in 1952 and 1949, separately. 

By 1910, France presently couldn't seem to set out a solitary gunboat warship; Britain had by then finished ten battleships and five battlecruisers, with eight and three a greater amount of the two kinds, separately, under development. Germany had constructed eight gunboats and one battlecruiser and the United States had six fabricated and four additionally assembling. Late that year, the French Navy set out the first of the four boats. To cure the mediocrity of the French armada, the administration passed the "Statut Naval" on 30 March 1912, approving a power of twenty-eight warships, to be in administration by 1920. The initial three boats were to be set down in 1912. 

The "Bretagne" class were substitutions for the warships "Carnot", "Charles Martel" and "LibertÄÅ¡". They were created from the "Courbet" class, and were worked with similar frames. The essential explanation behind the choice to utilize a similar structure plan as the "Courbet" class was impediments of French shipyards. The "Courbet"- class ships were the biggest conceivable boats that could fit in existing dockyards and refitting bowls. The "Conseil supÄÅ¡rieur de la Marine" ("CSM"), the French maritime central leadership, requested the development office to get ready plans for a ship furnished with twelve weapons in six twin firearm turrets. 

The extra weight of the 340Ã¢Â mm turrets contrasted with the of the "Courbet"- class ships forced outlandish issues for the fashioners. To join six turrets with a similar game plan of the prior vessels, with four on the centerline in superfiring sets and two wing turrets amidships would have required an extra dislodging just as a noteworthy increment in the length of the structure. After a few different recommendations, the "CSM" picked a plan with five twin turrets, all mounted on the centerline. This would accomplish a similar broadside of ten firearms, regardless of the decrease in the quantity of weapons. The width of the heavily clad belt was decreased by to make up for the expanded load of the primary battery. 

"Provence" was the principal ship of the class to be set down, which she was on 21 May 1912 at the "Armory de Lorient". "Bretagne" was set down at the "Weapons store de Brest" shipyard in Brest on 22 July 1912. "Lorraine" pursued at the "Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire" shipyard in St. Nazaire very nearly a half year later on 7 November 1912. Because of the episode of World War I in the mid year of 1914, French mechanical limit was diverted to the military and work hindered on the boats. The Greek Navy requested a warship to be named "Vasilefs Konstantinos" to a similar plan from AC de St Nazaire Penhoet. Work started in June 1914 yet stopped on the flare-up of war in August and never continued. The agreement debate was settled in 1925. 

The boats were long at the waterline and long by and large. They had a light emission a draft of between and . At the planned burden, the boats dislodged , and at full battle load, this expanded to . The team included 34 officers, 139 trivial officers, and 1,020 enrolled men, for a complete group of 1,193. The vessels conveyed various littler pontoons, including two steamboats, three watch vessels, one long pontoon, three dinghies, two dinghies, two whaleboats, and two rafts. 

The boats' impetus frameworks comprised of four Parsons steam turbines. "Bretagne" was furnished with twenty-four Niclausse boilers; "Lorraine" had a similar number of Guyot du Temple boilers. "Provence" was outfitted with eighteen "Belleville" boilers. Every one of the three boats were coal-terminated. The turbines each drove a solitary screw and were evaluated at an aggregate of . This gave a top speed of . The four boats could convey of coal, however extra spaces could be utilized for coal stockpiling, for up to . At most extreme speed, the boats could steam for ; at , the range expanded altogether to A further decrease in speed to correspondingly expanded the range to . 

The boats were changed a few times in the interwar period. In 1919, "Bretagne" was furnished with a substantial tripod pole; "Provence" and "Lorraine" were given tripod poles in the mid 1920s. Four of "Bretagne"s boilers were changed over to oil-terminating in 1924, and half of "Provence"s boilers in the back engine compartment were likewise changed over in 1927. "Bretagne" therefore had six new oil-terminated boilers to supplant the remainder of the old coal-terminated boilers, and her immediate drive turbines were supplanted with Parsons adapted turbines. "Provence" was also altered in 1931Ã¢ÂÂ1934. "Lorraine"s impetus framework was improved in a comparative example. In 1935, "Lorraine" had her inside primary battery turret supplanted with an air ship sling and a shed for three airplane. These were at first Gourdou-Leseurre GL-819 and Potez 452 seaplanes, however they were supplanted with the Loire 130 flying vessel. In MarchÃ¢ÂÂMay 1944, the flying machine establishment was evacuated. 

The ship's fundamental battery comprised of ten 340mm/45 ModÄÂ¨le 1912 firearms in five twin weapon turrets. The turrets were mounted all on the centerline, with two out of a superfiring pair forward of the conning tower, one amidships between the two pipes, and two superfiring toward the back of the back superstructure. These firearms had a most extreme height of 12Ã¢Â degrees, with a scope of ; this was a consequence of the "CSM"s conviction that the definitive fight range would just be and that armadas would not draw in at reaches longer than . "Lorraine" was adjusted in 1917 to build the height of the weapons to 18Ã¢Â degrees, which correspondingly expanded the range to . "Bretagne" and "Provence" were correspondingly altered after the finish of the war in 1919. Each firearm was provided with 100 rounds of ammo, put away in shell rooms situated underneath the force magazines. The weapons were controlled halfway by Barr and Stroud rangefinders; every turret was additionally outfitted with a free rangefinder, which were situated over the turret rooftops in a heavily clad hood. 

Twenty-two Canon de 138 mm ModÄÂ¨le 1910 weapons were mounted in casemates along the length of the ship's structure. They were relied upon to be utilized upsettingly to assault the upper works of adversary warships, just as to safeguard against torpedo pontoon assaults. The optional battery fire control comprised of two focal executives four rangefinders, which were found side by side of the superfiring turrets, fore and rearward. The boats conveyed seven 47Ã¢Â mm M1885 Hotchkiss snappy discharging weapons. Two were put on the conning tower and one was put on every fundamental battery turret. Amid World War I, a couple of firearms were included. The boats' weapon were adjusted by four torpedo tubes. The cylinders were submerged in the boats' structures. 

In the interwar period, every one of the three boats had their deadly implement improved. In 1919Ã¢ÂÂ1920, "Bretagne" had the four forwardmost of her 138Ã¢Â mm firearms expelled, alongside the 75Ã¢Â mm and two of the 47Ã¢Â mm weapons. In their place, four 75Ã¢Â mm mle 1897 weapons were introduced on the forward superstructure. Twenty-four Hotchkiss automatic weapons were introduced on the forecastle deck in 1927. The four rearmost 138Ã¢Â mm weapons were evacuated amid this refit, alongside the 75Ã¢Â mm firearms, which were supplanted with eight 75Ã¢Â mm mle 1922 enemy of flying machine firearms. Sixteen 13.2 mm Hotchkiss automatic weapons, in fourfold mounts, were likewise included. "Provence" had her four forward 138Ã¢Â mm firearms evacuated in 1919, and was prepared correspondingly to "Bretagne". In 1931Ã¢ÂÂ1934, she got indistinguishable eight 75Ã¢Â mm weapons from "Bretagne" did, and in 1940, three fourfold mounts of 13.2Ã¢Â mm firearms were fitted. "Lorraine" pursued a comparative example, however in 1935, her middle primary battery turret was expelled; an air ship launch was fitted in its place. As of now, four Model M1930 firearms were included, alongside two of the 13.2Ã¢Â mm fourfold mounts. In 1940, the 100Ã¢Â mm firearms were evacuated to arm the new warship "Richelieu", and eight 75Ã¢Â mm M1922 weapons supplanted them. In MarchÃ¢ÂÂMay 1944, fourteen and twenty-five firearms in single mounts were included, and the fourfold 13.2Ã¢Â mm weapons were evacuated. 

The "Bretagne"s were given Barr and Stroud rangefinders. Every turret had rangefinder under a reinforced hood at the back of the turret. Between the wars, fire-control chiefs were included for the principle, auxiliary and against flying machine combat hardware. The rangefinder on the forward superfiring turret was supplanted by an instrument. 

The boats' fundamental defensively covered belt was thick amidships and diminished to on either end of the ship. Over the belt, the auxiliary battery casemates were defensively covered with thick steel plate. Level assurance comprised of three reinforced decks; the primary deck was thick. The upper and lower decks were both 40Ã¢Â mm thick. Slanted protective layer thick associated the primary deck to the reinforced belt. Every one of the principle battery barbettes that housed the lower turret congregations were heavily clad with thick steel. The forward-most and back most turrets had thick sides. The superfiring turrets were less all around secured, with 270Ã¢Â mm thick sides. The amidships turret was the most vigorously shielded, with thick sides. The conning tower was ensured with thick protection plating. The absolute load of covering was .
