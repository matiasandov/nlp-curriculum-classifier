"Quiet Hill 2" is set in another zone of the town, and investigates some of Silent Hill's backstory. The town draws upon the mind of its guests and at last structures elective variants of the town, which contrast contingent upon the character. The idea driving the town was "a little, country town in America"; to make the setting progressively practical, a few structures and rooms need decorations. 

James Sunderland (Guy Cihi) comes to Silent Hill after evidently getting a letter from his better half Mary (Monica Taylor Horgan), who passed on of a sickness three years prior. While investigating the town, he experiences Angela Orosco (Donna Burke), a young runaway hunting down her mom; Eddie Dombrowski (David Schaufele), another adolescent runaway; and Laura (Jacquelyn Brekenridge), an eight-year-old who become a close acquaintence with Mary and blames James for not genuinely cherishing her.

Following Laura to a clinic and hunting down her there at Maria's request, James and Maria are trapped by the beast Pyramid Head, and Maria is executed while James get away.

In another room, a last gathering with Angela sees her abandoning life, unfit to adapt to her injury. She strolls into a flame and isn't seen once more. A while later, James experiences two Pyramid Heads, alongside Maria, who is slaughtered once more. James understands that Pyramid Head was made in light of the fact that he required somebody to rebuff him, and every one of the beasts are signs of his mind. The envelope from Mary vanishes and both Pyramid Heads end it all. James heads to the lodging's housetop; contingent upon decisions made by the player all through the amusement, he experiences either Mary or Maria camouflaged as her. 

"Quiet Hill 2" highlights six endings; Konami has kept their canonicity uncertain. In "Leave", James has one final gathering with Mary, peruses her letter, and leaves the town with Laura. "In Water" sees James end it all by driving his vehicle off a bluff. The "Maria" finishing considers Mary to be the lady on the housetop, who has not pardoned James for murdering her; after her thrashing, James expels her as a mental trip and afterward leaves the town with an alive Maria, who quickly hacks, proposing she will wind up wiped out similarly as Mary did, and the cycle will rehash. The other three endings are just accessible in replay amusements, including "Resurrection", in which James intends to revive Mary utilizing arcane items gathered all through the diversion, and two joke endings: "Pooch", where James finds that a puppy has been controlling every one of the occasions of the diversion, and "UFO", where James is kidnapped by extraterrestrials with the assistance of the primary amusement's hero, Harry Mason. 

"Conceived from a Wish" is a side-story situation in the extraordinary versions and re-arrivals of the amusement in which the player assumes responsibility for Maria in no time before she and James meet at Silent Hill.

The amusement was made by Team Silent, a generation bunch inside Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. The story was brought about by CGI chief Takayoshi Sato, who put together it with respect to Russian creator Fyodor Dostoyevsky's tale "Wrongdoing and Punishment" (1866), with individual individuals from the group teaming up on the real situation. The fundamental composing was finished by Hiroyuki Owaku and Sato who gave the exchange to the female characters. "Quiet Hill 2"s spending plan has been assessed at US$7Ã¢ÂÂ10 million by Sato, an expansion from the past portion's evaluated expense of US$3Ã¢ÂÂ5 million. The choice to deliver a spin-off of "Quiet Hill" was incompletely a money related one, as it had been monetarily fruitful, and somewhat an inventive one, as the group had confronted troubles while chipping away at the first amusement. The group was given a little window to settle on a stage. As it was unfit to accumulate data on the then-unannounced GameCube and Xbox supports, they started creation of the diversion for the PlayStation 2. Maker Akihiro Imamura expressed that the choice was likewise affected by "a desire from the business segment that we move quickly on the PS2. You know, it is as of now the market center".

"Quiet Hill 2" had a similar environment of mental ghastliness as the principal "Quiet Hill" diversion. As the engineers previously had a harsh feeling of the diversion's condition, they centered around its plot first, as opposed to the procedure utilized with the main amusement.

For instance, as a beast approaches the player character, its shadow cast on the divider by the electric lamp develops. When managing the amusement's camera points, the group battled with a harmony between those that remained consistent with the imaginative vision and those that did not hamper interactivity. Mental components, for example, the steady vanishing of Mary's letter and representative openings, were fused into the amusement. The group needed "Quiet Hill 2"s hero to "reflect [the] insidious," against which the hero of the principal amusement fights. 

For the amusement's aesthetic style, the group drew on an assortment of impacts: crafted by movie executives David Cronenberg, David Fincher, David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock, alongside movies like the 1990 spine chiller/blood and guts movie "Jacob's Ladder", and painters, for example, Francis Bacon, Rembrandt and Andrew Wyeth.

To pick up a superior feeling of the characters' facial structures, they drew the characters' profiles from different edges, before making wire-outline models, each comprising of six thousand polygons; they at that point finished the model with surfaces. Information for the character movement was taken through movement catch, and utilizing Softimage, they vivified the characters. Masahiro Ito structured the beasts in "Quiet Hill 2"; "soured tissue" was the idea driving their appearance. The beasts were likewise to consolidate "a component of mankind". Generally, the beasts mirror the hero's subliminal. For instance, the beast Pyramid Head depended on the killers of the town's anecdotal history and is proposed to be a punisher for James. Two special cases to this subject are the "Theoretical Daddy", an impression of Angela's subliminal and recollections, and the "Creepers", which are additionally found in the main amusement. 

"Quiet Hill 2" likewise fuses a few references to genuine occasions.

Eddie Dombrowski's name was taken from performing artist Eddie Murphy amid the starting periods of creation when Eddie was initially structured with a wonderfully hopeful identity. The name of Angela Orosco was gotten from Angela Bennett, the name of the hero in the 1995 film "The Net", and Laura's from the 1970 novel "No Language But a Cry" by Richard D'Ambrosio. The engineers ridiculed weapons in American culture by enabling James to discover a handgun in a shopping basket. There are likewise signs that the format of Silent Hill was put together to a limited degree with respect to the town of San Bruno, California. 

Akira Yamaoka created the music for "Quiet Hill 2". At his home, Yamaoka took three days to compose the music for "Subject of Laura", "Quiet Hill 2"s principle topic, by joining "a miserable song" and "a solid beat", despite the fact that he doesn't believe the tune to be the "most critical" component of a melodic piece. He needed the music to bring out feelings in the player. "Quiet Hill 2" utilizes audio cues going from shouts to strides on broken glass.

He likewise consolidated infrequent quiet, remarking that "choosing snapshots of quietness is another method for delivering sound".
