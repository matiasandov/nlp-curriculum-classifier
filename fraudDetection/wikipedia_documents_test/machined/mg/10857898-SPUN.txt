In spite of the fact that the first arrangement was an independent novel, enough material was made for a few books, and the distributer settled on a six-volume arrangement. Holmes at that point enrolled the assistance of another creator, Kate Cary whom Holmes had beforehand altered for and realized she adored felines.

Spottedleaf is given a prediction; "Flame Alone Will Save Our Clan". 

Corroded, an inquisitive fire hued tom Kittypet (a feline under training), is headed to the woods after a fantasy of him chasing a mouse. Corroded keeps running into Graypaw, dim dark tom from ThunderClan who has quite recently turned into an understudy. Corroded, be that as it may, does not flee and battles the student. After the fight, Graypaw discloses to Rusty he battled great, for a Kittypet, and continues to educate him regarding the Clans. Bluestar and a brilliant dark-striped cat tom named Lionheart, likewise from ThunderClan, who were viewing the entire time, uncover themselves and welcome Rusty to join ThunderClan. 

Because of his tamed past, a few individuals from the Clan are threatening towards Rusty. This antagonistic vibe inevitably drives Rusty to assault Longtail, a pale darker dark striped dark-striped cat tom who intentionally battles Rusty to demonstrate his value, losing his jingling neckline in the resulting battle, just as tearing Longtail's ear. Bluestar then closures the battle and reports that Rusty has earned his understudy name, Firepaw. Ravenpaw the coal black tom intrudes on this, cautioning the Clan of the passing of Redtail before he collaspes. Tigerclaw the expansive dim dark colored dark-striped cat tom conveys the inert body to the Clan. Lionheart turns into the new representative of ThunderClan.

Whenever Bluestar, Tigerclaw, Ravenpaw, Firepaw and Graypaw go on an adventure to the enchanted Moonstone, situated in a consecrated site inside a relinquished Twoleg (human) mine called Highstones by the Clan felines, so Bluestar can collective with StarClan, ShadowClan (felines that live in the marshlands and among the pines of the backwoods) assaults ThunderClan's camp. The five felines on the adventure return so as to change the tide of the fight, amid which ThunderClan's new representative Lionheart is murdered. A couple of days after the fact, Spottedleaf is butchered and Frostfur the snow-white she-feline's units are stolen by Brokenstar the dull darker dark-striped cat tom and his warriors.

The style of the book has additionally been contrasted with the "Redwall" arrangement by Brian Jacques. An analyst for "The Plain Dealer" composed that the book "is designed in the style of works of art by J.R.R. Tolkien or Brian Jacques". While "School Library Journal" prescribed the book to "Redwall" fans, the commentator still felt the style wasn't as exquisite. 

The book has a dictionary with certain diverse names for remote articles. A "Youngsters' Literature" audit noticed the words "kittypet" and "twoleg" which mean housecat and people individually. In the book, rather, of utilizing "said", Cary utilizes "mewed". This was censured with the commentator expressing "that 'he mewed', 'she murmured', and 'the warrior mewed', which go for feline talk, develops old quick". Because of an inquiry at the Q&A area of the gathering Holmes clarified that the names come "in two sections, either or the two of which can reflect something about the feline's appearance, identity, or propensities". In any case, they should likewise be a piece of the world they know; Holmes initially gave Tigerclaw the name Hammerclaw until one of the editors called attention to the felines wouldn't realize what a mallet is. For the names, Kate Cary says that she takes in motivation for the names from "sight, sounds and fragrances the felines would involvement". In the meantime, more names become accessible as the feline's reality turns out to be increasingly differing. 

Harper Collins initially mentioned that Holmes compose a "dream story on wild felines". Despite the fact that beset on what to expound on at first, Holmes acknowledged she could include human subjects and issues into the book, for example, "war, governmental issues, vengeance, destined love, religious clash". A questioner has portrayed the plot as "Shakespearian: a distraught pioneer, intra-family selling out, war, star-crossed darlings, demise". Audits have additionally considered the story a "creature experience". 

The epic was picked to be a piece of the youthful grown-up dream sort because of its expanding fame. Cherith Baldry feel that the development of sort is because of the way that "dream is something in all respects profoundly established in the human personality, not only for kids". Dream stories can manage human feelings helping perusers to manage them in reality. Another Erin Hunter, Kate Cary felt that dream books, for example, "Harry Potter" "is an indication of an extending requirement for dream to light up our lives". She depicts how as a youngster she was far less limited than the present kids whose days are organized and planned. Cary feels that dream stories help kids "escape into the universe of the creative energy, on the grounds that itÃ¢ÂÂs the main spot they can be actually free and un-judged". 

"Distributers Weekly" noticed that subjects, for example, family, companionship and obligation are likewise educated in the warrior code, the arrangement of standards that the Clans must pursue. Holmes has said that one of her most loved things about composition the arrangement is having the capacity to include subjects that apply to every one of us, for example, family, misfortune, respect, valiance, passing, dedication, and following tenets. Different topics incorporate "passing and otherworldliness and family and connections". She additionally included human subjects, for example, "beginning at another school (Rusty joining ThunderClan), becoming hopelessly enamored with the wrong individual (Graystripe and Silverstream) and being tormented by somebody who should take care of you (Tigerclaw harassing Ravenpaw)". To a commentator for "Kirkus Reviews", the human topic of fitting in was effectively found and cheered when Rusty succeeds. 

Another topic found all through the book is the hardship of life in nature. Surveys have note how the story does not conceal the hardships of Clan life. "School Library Journal" remarked on how the story portrays the hardships and troubles of a wild feline's life in detail and how there is no sugarcoating of the brutality. Dream Book Review additionally expressed "Erin Hunter does not extra the peruser from the bleak substances of living in nature". "Kirkus Reviews" noticed that doing as such shows how the Clans are on the very edge of survival.

"Booklist" thought the novel "spine-shivering" and noticed that "the feline characters are consistent with their catlike nature, making this beyond any doubt to speak to fanatics of Clare Bell's long-prevalent "Ratha's Creature" (1983) and its spin-offs and furthermore to devotees of Brian Jacques' progressing Redwall arrangement." "Distributers Weekly" applauded the energy and furthermore included that the book would satisfy any individual who "has ever pondered what longs for greatness may frequent the family feline". The survey likewise lauded the universe of the felines and subjects put into the book. Despite the fact that "School Library Journal" thought the book not also composed as the Redwall arrangement, it noted that the novel exhibited a "captivating world with an unpredictable structure". The audit likewise felt that there was an excess of supporting characters, however "there are champions who offer measurement to the story". The measure of savagery was likewise noted in the audit. "Kirkus Reviews" clowned the book would have feline proprietors take a gander at their pets anxiously before composing how Hunter doesn't have "any trace of wistfulness. Snapping bones, streaming blood, and unexpected passing richly show how these felines stroll on the slender edge of survival". The survey noticed how teenagers would perceive how hard it is for Firepaw to fit in. "Washington Times" takes note of the strain ascending among Tigerclaw and Firepaw and lauded the scene where Longtail provokes Firepaw's entitlement to be in the Clan.
