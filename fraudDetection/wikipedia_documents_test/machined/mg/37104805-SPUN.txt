Lepiota babruzalka 

Lepiota babruzalka is an agaric mushroom of the family "Lepiota" in the request Agaricales. Depicted as new to science in 2009, it is found in Kerala State, India, where it develops on the ground in litterfall around bamboo stems. Natural product bodies have tops that measure up to in width, and are secured with ruddy dark colored scales. The top is bolstered by a long and thin stem up to long and thick. One of the distinctive infinitesimal highlights of the species is the dynamically molded cystidia found on the edges of the gills. 

The species was first portrayed by Arun Kumar Thirovoth Kottuvetta and P.ÃÂ Manimohan in the diary "Mycotaxon" in 2009, in a review of the family "Lepiota" in Kerala State in southern India. The holotype gathering was made in 2004 in Chelavur, situated in the Kozhikode District; it is currently kept in the herbarium of Kew Gardens. The particular sobriquet "babruzalka" gets from the Sanskrit word for "darker scaled". 

The natural product assortments of "Lepiota babruzalka" have tops that begin generally round, and as they grow become comprehensively arched, and in the end level, with a dull umbo. The top achieves a measurement of . Its whitish surface is secured with little, ruddy darker, pushed down scales that are increasingly various in the middle. The edge is at first bended internal, yet fixes in age, and holds balancing remainders of the fractional cloak. The gills are white, and free from connection to the stem. They are packed together, with a few levels of mixed lamellulae (short gills that don't expand completely from the top edge to the stem). Seen with a hand focal point, the edges of the gills have all the earmarks of being bordered. The stem is round and hollow with a bulbous base, at first strong before getting to be empty, and measures long by 1Ã¢ÂÂ1.5Ã¢Â mm thick. The stem surface is whitish, however will recolor a light darker shading whenever took care of. In youthful organic product bodies, the stems have a whitish, membranous ring on the upper half, however the ring does not keep going well before crumbling. The tissue is dainty (up to 1Ã¢Â mm), whitish, and comes up short on any considerable smell. 

"Lepiota babruzalka" produces a white spore print. Spores are generally curved to some degree tube shaped, hyaline (translucent), and measure 5.5Ã¢ÂÂ10.5 by 3.5Ã¢ÂÂ4.5Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. They are thick-walled and contain a refractive oil bead. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-formed, hyaline, and are one-to four-spored with sterigmata up to 8Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m long; the elements of the basidia are 15Ã¢ÂÂ20 by 7Ã¢ÂÂ8Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gill) are copious, and can accept various shapes, including tube shaped to club-formed, utriform (like a wineskin bottle), to ventricose-rostrate (where the basal and center parts are swollen and the peak reaches out into a snout like projection). The cheilocystidia are slim walled, and measure 13Ã¢ÂÂ32 by 7Ã¢ÂÂ12Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m; there are no cystidia on the gill faces (pleurocystidia). 

The gill tissue is made of slight walled hyphae containing a septum, which are hyaline to light yellow, and measure 3Ã¢ÂÂ15Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide. The top tissue involves entwined, swelled hyphae with widths somewhere in the range of 2 and 25Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. Neither the gill tissue nor the top tissue demonstrate any shading response when recolored with Melzer's reagent. Clip associations are uncommon in the hyphae of "Lepiota babruzalka". 

As indicated by the creators, the main "Lepiota" looking to some extent like "L.Ã¢Â babruzalka" is "L.Ã¢Â roseoalba", an eatable mushroom portrayed by Paul Christoph Hennings in 1891. Found in Africa and Iran, "L.Ã¢Â roseoalba" comes up short on the rosy dark colored scales on the top, has outspread furrows on the top edge, and its stem isn't as slim as those of "L.Ã¢Â babruzalka". 

Natural product assemblages of "Lepiota babruzalka" develop separately or dissipated on the ground among rotting leaf litter around the base of bamboo stands. The species has been archived just from Chelavur and Nilambur in the Kozhikode and Malappuram Districts of Kerala State. Starting at 2009, there are 22 "Lepiota" taxa (21 species and 1 assortment) known from Kerala, which is perceived as a biodiversity hotspot.
