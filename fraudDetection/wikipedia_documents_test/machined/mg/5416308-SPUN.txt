New York State Route 173 

New York State RouteÃ¢Â 173 (NYÃÂ 173) is a state parkway situated in the Syracuse zone of focal New York in the United States. It takes a somewhat bow-formed course from NYÃÂ 31 in the town of Van Buren to NYÃÂ 5 in Chittenango, tenderly bending toward the south of Downtown Syracuse in the focal point of its steering. All things considered, NYÃÂ 173 quickly enters the Syracuse city restrains close where it meets U.S. RouteÃ¢Â 11 (USÃÂ 11). NYÃÂ 173 goes through a few rural areas of Syracuse, including Camillus, where it initially meets NYÃÂ 5, and Manlius, where it has a short cover with NYÃÂ 92. 

NYÃÂ 173 was doled out as a component of the 1930 renumbering of state expressways in New York to its cutting edge arrangement. The course itself has not been changed since; nonetheless, the bit of the course from Onondaga to Manlius turned out to be a piece of NYÃÂ 20N and a little area of the course inside Manlius was incorporated into NYÃÂ 20SY when that thruway was doled out in the mid 1950s. The two assignments were evacuated in 1961. All of NYÃÂ 173 east of Onondaga was initially part of the Seneca Turnpike. 

NYÃÂ 173 starts at a crossing point with NYÃÂ 31 in Ionia, a village inside the town of Van Buren. The course travels southeast, crossing a few region streets as it continues through a provincial, mucky zone of Onondaga County as Warners Road. It traverses the New York State Thruway (InterstateÃ¢Â 90 or I-90) on its way into the village of Warners, where it quickly pursues Canton Street and crosses the CSX Transportation-possessed Rochester Subdivision rail line before getting to be Warners Road by and by as it pursues the railroad east out of the network and into the town of Camillus. 

The course parallels the track for generally , over which time it goes toward the north of Greenlawn Memorial Park. As the trackage and the interstate methodology a point known as Amboy Station, NYÃÂ 173 bends from the railroad and heads southeast toward Amboy. In the wake of making the turn, NYÃÂ 173 meets Pottery Road (County RouteÃ¢Â 164 or CRÃÂ 164), a nearby street prompting Camillus Airport, a straightforward one-runway office found adjoining the railroad line. NYÃÂ 173 proceeds into and through Amboy, passing a huge territory of tailings that was at one time the site of the Syracuse Municipal Airport. The brownfields are circumscribed toward the north by Ninemile Creek and toward the south by the Old Erie Canal, the two of which are navigated by NYÃÂ 173 on its way into the thickly populated Fairmount neighborhood of Camillus. 

In Fairmount, NYÃÂ 173 passes Reed Webster Park and swings toward the east in front of the Camillus Bypass, a constrained access expressway bringing NYÃÂ 5 through the town. NYÃÂ 173 parallels NYÃÂ 5 for about before interfacing with westward NYÃÂ 5 by method for a halfway exchange; the eastward association is made by method for Hinsdale Road (CRÃÂ 209) toward the west. East of the westward entrance ramps, NYÃÂ 173 ignores NYÃÂ 5 and swings toward the southeast in front of a crossing point with NYÃÂ 297. The course proceeds through Fairmount, meeting West Genesee Street (CRÃÂ 98) before getting to be Onondaga Road and leaving the area after entering the town of Onondaga. 

Inside Onondaga, NYÃÂ 173 goes through both open territories with inadequate improvement and regions containing developed private neighborhoods. The course travels southeast to Onondaga Hill, an extensive network developed only east of Onondaga Community College. Here, it covers with NYÃÂ 175 for about before NYÃÂ 175 forks off toward the upper east into Syracuse. NYÃÂ 173 proceeds with eastbound as the Seneca Turnpike, going toward the south of Community General Hospital before it enters the southernmost bit of Syracuse. This bit of the city is for the most part private, put something aside for a sprinkling of organizations around NYÃÂ 173's intersections with NYÃÂ 80 and USÃÂ 11. Close to the midpoint of the course's stay in Syracuse, it traverses Onondaga Creek, on the banks of which lie Faith Heritage School and Meachem Field. The course leaves as far as possible not long after going under the two headings of I-81. 

All of NYÃÂ 173 west of Genesee Street in Camillus is kept up by Onondaga County. NYÃÂ 173 is co-assigned with CRÃÂ 204 from NYÃÂ 31 to Bennetts Corners Road in Van Buren, CRÃÂ 64 between Bennetts Corners Road and Canton Street in the village of Warners, CRÃÂ 57 from Canton Street to Thompson Road in Camillus, and CRÃÂ 63 between Thompson Road and Genesee Street. Inside Syracuse, NYÃÂ 173 is kept up by the city. The rest of the course in both Onondaga and Madison areas is kept up by the New York State Department of Transportation. 

East of Syracuse, the course goes through a tight bit of the town of Onondaga and the village of Southwood before entering the adjoining town of DeWitt. It proceeds with east, serving Clark Reservation State Park as it makes a beeline for the network of Jamesville, situated at the northern end of the Jamesville Reservoir on Butternut Creek. Here, NYÃÂ 173 crosses NYÃÂ 91 in the focal point of the villa. Past Jamesville, the homes that had lined the interstate offer approach to open regions toward the south and huge quarries toward the north. The course passes north of the Onondaga County Correctional Facility only east of Jamesville. 

NYÃÂ 173 proceeds into the town of Manlius, where the homes bit by bit return as the thruway enters the town of Manlius. Inside as far as possible, the course ends up encompassed by homes indeed as it traverses Limestone Creek and enters the town's business area. Here, it crosses and quickly covers NYÃÂ 92 for generally among Fayette and Washington Streets. At Washington Street, NYÃÂ 92 swings toward the southeast towards Cazenovia while NYÃÂ 173 proceeds with northeastward out of the town. Presently back in the encompassing town of Manlius, NYÃÂ 173 passes south of FayettevilleÃ¢ÂÂManlius High School before entering another rustic region close to a point known as Eagle Village. The course proceeds with upper east from that point into Madison County. 

After intersection the region line, NYÃÂ 173 at first turns marginally eastbound to pursue a less articulated northeasterly arrangement. Notwithstanding, as the course approaches the Chittenango Creek valley, it slowly turns northward. At Brinkerhoff Hill, NYÃÂ 173 enters the Chittenango town restricts and plummets into the valley, where it closes at a convergence with NYÃÂ 5 in the town focus at the base of the valley. 

The segment of present day NYÃÂ 173 between NYÃÂ 175 in Onondaga and NYÃÂ 5 in Chittenango was initially part of the first Seneca Turnpike. The Seneca Turnpike was initially the longest street in the territory of New York when it was worked during the 1800s. NYÃÂ 173 was alloted as a component of the 1930 renumbering of state parkways in New York to the aggregate of its cutting edge arrangement. In spite of the fact that NYÃÂ 173 itself has not changed since that time, different courses have been overlaid on parts of NYÃÂ 173 throughout the years. The section of NYÃÂ 173 between NYÃÂ 175 in Onondaga and the east end of the NYÃÂ 92 cover in Manlius turned out to be a piece of NYÃÂ 20N, a northerly backup way to go of USÃÂ 20 among Skaneateles and Cazenovia, . In the mid 1950s, the bit of NYÃÂ 173 simultaneous with NYÃÂ 92 in Manlius likewise turned out to be a piece of NYÃÂ 20SY, a second, much increasingly northern backup way to go of USÃÂ 20 among Marcellus and Cazenovia. The NYÃÂ 20N and NYÃÂ 20SY assignments were expelled in 1961.
