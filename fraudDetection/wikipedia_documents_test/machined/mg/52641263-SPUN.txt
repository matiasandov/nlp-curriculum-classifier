Bono and Chris Martin were extraordinary supporters of the venture the first run through around, and when I realized I needed to incorporate men on this collection they were evident decisions. They are likewise the two dads to girls. Others, for example, Patti Smith and Rita Wilson, I've known for quite a while, and a few, as Edie Brickell and Paul Simon, I just met quickly however was a gigantic admirer. I for the most part needed an assorted gathering of specialists who were guardians, or on account of Edward Sharpe, will's identity soon. We needed to contact an expansive gathering of people on this issue with this specific venture and with a scope of points of view. 

The collection opens with Bono and The Edge's acoustic "Unique of the Species" (2004). Turlington said of the track, "Bono composed the melody in light of his little girls. It's pie in the sky and bestows the possibility that, 'I'm here and I'm watching you step forward and I'm supporting your freedom, and yet, I don't need you to commit errors.' Any parent can identify with that."

Turlington said of Vedder's contribution: Eddie was astounding to acknowledge this task while amidst to such an extent. I addressed him and traded a few messages about his commitment. "Skipping" is such a sweet tune and I simply love that his girl Olivia has a little appearance toward the begin. He once kept in touch with me saying that his young ladies would be glad one day that their father added to such a significant undertaking.

"Mother" highlights music put to a ballad composed by Alex Ebert; the band recorded a music video for the melody, which "The Huffington Post" depicted as having a "practically trancelike" groove with a "late-1960s/mid 1970s hallucinogenic vibe". 

The following tracks are a "woodwind arched" form of "Get Up Stand Up" by Cedella Marley, Beck's "Corrina, Corrina" (1928), a conventional people tune most prominently secured by Bob Dylan, and "Rather than the Dead" by Rufus Wainwright. The collection's last tracks are Smith's "Somalia" and an acoustic version of "Yellow" (2000) by Coldplay. Turlington said of "Somalia": Patti disclosed to me she composed this melody years back, in the wake of seeing a portion on the news in which a tyke truly passed on in the arms of its mom. That memory was still present to her in 2011 amid the emergency in the Horn of Africa, so she thought, "On the off chance that I could give this mother what I have — natural product on the trees, a solid youngster — I would." She went into the studio and brought along her little girl, who's currently developed and hitched, to play piano, and gave us this rendition of the melody.
