Vanajan Autotehdas 

Vanajan Autotehdas Oy (VAT) was a maker of overwhelming vehicles situated in HÄÂ¤meenlinna, Finland. The organization was established as "Yhteissisu Oy" in 1943 by the Finnish government and various significant Finnish organizations with the point of delivering lorries and transports for the Finnish Defense Forces. World War II was over before the organization could begin arrangement creation; it was renamed Vanajan Autotehdas and the marque progressed toward becoming Vanaja. Along these lines, the creation comprised of obsolete lorry models, somewhat worked from military surplus materials. In the wake of defeating introductory challenges, the organization modernized its items, wound up productive and developed until the mid 1950s. Many real segments, including motors, were imported. Diesel motors turned out to be generally accessible in 1955, and in 1959 VAT presented its most critical advancement, the full burden lifting pair hub component, which improved rough terrain capacity essentially; the framework is currently utilized in Sisu vehicles. 

The organization began delivering transport frame in 1950, and the superstructures were worked by various Finnish mentor manufacturers. The last models were valued by various transport administrators, and missed after generation was ceased. All Vanaja transport body were fitted with compressed air brakes by 1958, after the disappointment of water driven brakes on a Vanaja transport had prompted one of the most exceedingly awful car crashes ever to have occurred in Finland. 

Tank fell into money related troubles by end of the 1960s; this prompted a merger with the other Finnish overwhelming vehicle maker Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab toward the finish of 1968. The Vanaja brand stopped to exist in 1971, after which the previous Vanaja processing plant delivered Sisu terminal tractors, transport undercarriage, military vehicles and portable crane skeleton. The production line presently has a place with Patriawhich produces Patria AMV heavily clad faculty carriersand substantial vehicle pivot maker Sisu Axles. 

Vanajan Autotehdas was dependably a little organization, utilizing around 400 individuals in 1968, and during the 1960s its piece of the pie was scarcely 5% in Finland. Practically all Vanajas were sold for the local market; just a couple of units were traded. Vanaja vehicles wound up known for their strong development and high level of customisation. The quantity of Vanaja transport case and lorries totalled 7,140 units; this comprises of 260 lorry and 66 transport suspension models; for 116 lorry models just a couple of units were delivered. Vanajas had a decent notoriety and they are these days esteemed by vintage vehicle aficionados. 

Amid the winter of 1942Ã¢ÂÂ43, the Finnish Defense Forces evaluated there was no prompt prospect of a snappy end to the Continuation War yet there was a quick requirement for new vehicles. In the more drawn out term, the military was required to require no less than 7,000 lorries and transports. Nonpartisan nations, for example, Sweden and Switzerland were happy to pitch vehicles to Finland yet requested installment ahead of time and in their own monetary forms. As Finland did not have adequate cash saves the main choice was to create household vehicle generation. 

Around then, the main Finnish substantial vehicle maker Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab (SAT) was building another processing plant in Karis, an area considered more outlandish than Helsinki to go under assault from Soviet air attacks. Organization general executive Tor Nessling recommended the industrial facility ought to be bigger than initially arranged. As another choice, Nessling, with outrageous reservation, considered structure another plant somewhere else in Finland. SAT was knowledgeable about overwhelming vehicle generation yet financial and specialized assets were restricted. Substantial vehicle merchants and some political factions thought SAT was attempting to profit by the war and to pick up a predominant position in the Finnish market. 

Resistance serve Rudolf Walden assembled a conference hung on 3 and 4 March 1943 to investigate answers for the intense lack of vehicles. The gathering was gone to by delegates of the legislature and military administration, and key work force from driving Finnish mechanical organizations. A panel was framed to propose establishing an organization in which SAT and the state were both included. The proposition was introduced in a gathering on 20 March. The name of the organization was "Oy Yhteissisu Ab" ("shared Sisu"), which implied the goal was joint generation of Sisu vehicles. The private proprietors were A. AhlstrÄÅm, Ata, Fiskars, Kone, Kymin Oy, Lokomo, W. Rosenlew and Co., Suomen Autoteollisuus, Suomen Gummitehdas, Suomen Kaapelitehdas, Tampereen Pellava-ja Rauta-Teollisuus, Yhtyneet Paperitehtaat and StrÄÅmberg. The home office was in Erottaja in Helsinki. The organization executive was Heikki H. Herlin and the hesitant Tor Nessling was designated general director. 

The Defense Forces set exacting necessities for the vehicles to be created. There was insufficient time to build up another model. Albeit obsolete, the best of the accessible choices was the Sisu S-21. Yhteissisu and SAT consented to exchange Sisu S-21 lorry creation to Yhteissisu. The Yhteissisu-created models were named S-22. 

Following the organization was established, generation began in the SAT production line in Vallila, Helsinki. The Yhteissisu vehicles were manufactured independently from SAT vehicles. It was obvious from the begin that vehicles ought to be created far from Helsinki; the organization looked for a reasonable area near great rail, street and conduit associations. The first thought was to assemble the processing plant inside caverns mined into bedrock; the spot would be required to have reasonable geography. An appropriate zone was at long last found in Vanaja beside HÄÂ¤meenlinna. Yhteissisu purchased of arrive on 14 March 1944. An agreement for industrial facility development was marked with a temporary worker on 30 March. The Railway Administration acknowledged Yhteissisu's arrangement to manufacture a railroad association in the territory. Quarrying work for the underground workshop started in July 1944. The cost and a lack of time implied the arrangement must be revised, and the whole creation territory was worked over the ground. The production line structures were finished toward the beginning of November 1944. Alvar Aalto's compositional office planned houses for the assembly line laborers. 

The main lorry made in Vanaja was a Sisu S-22 model, which took off of the manufacturing plant entryway on 1 August 1945. After a short and serious testing period, sequential creation started on 29 October 1945 but since of a lack of materials and part quality issues, the principal vehicles were not prepared until mid 1946. The capacities of the residential providers ended up being exceptionally restricted and the organization was subject to imported gearboxes, directing segments, drive shafts and electrical frameworks until household organizations could set up their very own generation. The Finnish providers were unfit to meet the prerequisites with the accessible materials and experienced serious quality issues. All out generation in 1946 was 147 Sisu S-22 vehicles, which was far beneath the objective of 2,000 vehicles. The first, determined cost per vehicle had been 765,000Ã¢Â marks however the possible expense was 800,000Ã¢Â marks. 

The war had finished before arrangement generation was begun, and the Defense Forces did not require new vehicles. Actually, the military needed to lessen the quantity of vehicles as indicated by the Moscow Armistice. The disappointed part providers left the business and the Ministry of Trade and Industry ended the vehicle supply contract from the finish of 1946. In mid 1946, Yhteissisu had concurred with the Ministry of Trade and Industry that vehicles not purchased by the state could be sold on the non military personnel showcase. Sisu S-22s wound up accessible available to be purchased at 12 SAT areas in Finland. The organization introduced a lighter, lower-cost show, the S-22K, at the Helsinki Domestic Industry Fair in May 1946. 

Tor Nessling left Yhteissisu in February 1947. There was discussion of shutting the organization. Yhteissisu sold just 103 S-22s in 1947, some of which had been created the earlier year. 55 lorries were worked by the organization in 1947. The organization's offer capital was decreased from 75Ã¢Â millionÃ¢Â marks to 7.5Ã¢Â million, at that point expanded to 50Ã¢Â million; the state turned into the primary proprietor, having a 44% offer of the organization. Different proprietors were Yhtyneet Paperitehtaat, A. AhlstrÄÅm, StrÄÅmberg and Tampereen Pellava-ja Rauta-Teollisuus. From September, the new broad director of the organization was Eero KytÄÅlÄÂ¤. The organization lost two million checks in 1947. 

Yhteissisu reserved the options to utilize the Sisu brand until summer 1948. In a general gathering held in 1948, the board chose to rename the organization Vanajan Autotehdas and the brand of the vehicles moved toward becoming Vanaja. The manufacturing plant zone was moved from the district of Vanaja to that of HÄÂ¤meenlinna toward the start of that year. 

At the point when the permit to utilize the Sisu brand lapsed in June 1948, Sisu S-22 creation was proceeded as the Vanaja V-48, and its generation proceeded until 1955. 

General director KytÄÅlÄÂ¤ ventured out to France and West Germany in 1947 and mid 1948 to purchase military surplus materials from the Western Allies. He purchased 425 White Motor Company M2 Half-Track vehicles, 186 lorry motors, 304 Cadillac V8 motors, 4 Mack ED diesel motors, 2 Hercules Diesel DFXE motors, 11,000 GMC haggles 45-ton-limit trailer. Exchanging was composed through the Ministry of Supply and the main conveyance landed in March 1948. The White Half-Track vehicles were without defensive layer; KytÄÅlÄÂ¤'s thought was to furnish them with superstructures for field or woodland clearing, or to change over them into Four-wheel drive lorries by supplanting the tracks with a customary back hub. Altogether, VAT sold 359 units as half-tracks, and 60 were changed over into 4ÄÂ4 or 4ÄÂ2 vehicles. These lorries were sold as Vanaja VaWh. A portion of the half-track vehicles were rejected for parts; the latter was sold in 1952. 

After the first contract with the state was ended, another understanding for the generation of 650 vehicles to be conveyed somewhere in the range of 1948 and 1952 was come to. The state helped generation with a huge prepayment of 132 million imprints. As indicated by the agreement, 150 vehicles were booked to be worked in 1948. The organization achieved this objective and made a further 11 vehicles for private use. 92 were sold under the name of Sisu S-22 or S-22K and 69 were badged as Vanaja V-48. 101 M2 Half-Tracks were sold. In 1948, VAT made lost 746,000 imprints. In 1949, VAT made another 150 vehicles for the state and 37 vehicles for private administrators; it delivered 163 V-48s and 24 VaWhs. The organization likewise sold 211 M2 Half-Tracks, enabling it to proclaim its first benefit of 1.208 million imprints, which was helped by a cheapening of the Finnish imprint. 

Tank's situating in the substantial vehicle showcase fortified in 1950 and the organization began creating transport undercarriage. That year, VAT presented another item familythe VK arrangement. Generation was disturbed by a three-month strike, because of which fruition of a portion of the 150 state-requested vehicles booked for conveyance that year was postponed until the next year. In spite of its troubles VAT posted a benefit of right around two million imprints. At this point, the organization utilized 106 specialists. 

Deals and benefits developed year-on-year amid the mid 1950s. The prepayment from the administration was reimbursed in 1952. For a brief span, VAT imported and advertised clearing tractors delivered by Italian firm Ansaldo-Fossati. Despite the fact that there was interest for this sort of vehicle, they sold ineffectively in light of the fact that their cost was viewed as conflicting with their specialized quality; just a couple of units were conveyed in 1953. 

The advancement of offers was overestimated; in 1956, 525 Vanajas were sold and in March 1957, the volume for the entire year was assessed to reach about 400Ã¢Â units. Tank utilized around 200 specialists at the time and changed to a four-day working week. The organization accused the administration's import permit administration for the problemit was hard to get diesel motors from abroad. In the next month, more than 30 Vanajas that were generally prepared were anticipating diesel motors. The economy improved in 1959. 

In 1950, the Finnish government was censured for disregarding different choices and purchasing just Vanajas, which were said to be overrated. The state had requested 650 vehicles, spread more than quite a long while, and this bound the state's hands in gear purchasing for a significant lot. 

Both VAT and SAT were condemned in 1954 by overwhelming vehicle shippers on the grounds that the two organizations approached a vast offer of the constrained remote money holds for segment supply. The shippers' agents said neither Sisu nor Vanaja were local items and the vehicles the merchants spoke to were in reality progressively household since some get together work was done in Finland. As per the Association of Vehicle Importers, the local vehicles cost somewhere in the range of 30% and 80% more contrasted with imported ones. The next year, the administration began to research conceivable outcomes for bringing in substantial vehicles in unit structure to decrease remote cash consumption. Tank and SAT communicated questions about the practicality of such creation. In 1957, the legislature finished confinements on the import of overwhelming vehicle frame. In the long run, the costs of imported vehicles drew closer those of Sisu and Vanaja vehicles. 

The Vanaja oil motors made by SAT and Tampella were obsolete American motors worked under permit. Clients needed diesel motors, which were all the more dominant. The first Vanaja diesel models were controlled by KÄÂ¤mper and Saurer motors. Tank likewise tried SÄÅºdwerke's two-stroke diesel motors yet just a single such vehicle was constructed. Import licenses for diesel motors were hard to acquire and this obliged vehicle deals. Now and again, clients gave their very own enginesfor model Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, which were mounted to their arranged vehicles on the mechanical production system. In 1955, VAT purchased two clusters of 6-barrel 90-hp Leyland 0.350 diesel motors. These turned out to be excessively wasteful, and the next year the organization requested a cluster of 300 more grounded Leylands made in the Netherlands by van Doorne's Automobilfabriek N.V. 

In 1956, VAT turned into the agent for Ansaldo S.A. what's more, KÄÂ¤mper-Motoren GmbH. Ansaldo offered motors of somewhere in the range of 100Ã¢Â hp and 8,000Ã¢Â hp proposed for marine and modern applications. KÄÂ¤mper items conveyed somewhere in the range of 14Ã¢Â hp and 150Ã¢Â hp. A 6-chamber, 130-hp KÄÂ¤mper was offered as a possibility for Vanajas. 

The best-known sign of Vanaja, the full-load lifting couple hub, was presented in January 1957. This innovation empowered an extra heap of 2.5 tons to be conveyed and the whole burden on the pair could be moved to the fore hub utilizing an electro-pressure driven framework. The framework improved the footing, offering a huge favorable position on tricky surfaces. The creative lifting couple was created under initiative of the organization's main architect Veikko Muronen. Vanaja turned into the pioneer in the Finnish logging vehicle advertise and kept up this situation until generation stopped. In ranger service work, a format with a determined front pivot and a pair hub with a determined fore hub, called 4ÄÂ4+2, ended up well known in Finland yet is only sometimes observed outside the Nordic nations. 

The Finnish Defense Forces completed a winter test for potential military vehicles in March 1958. 35Ã¢Â candidate vehicles from the two household makers and different merchants were driven around Finland. Tank sent four vehicles to the test, three of which were 4ÄÂ4s and one was a common, back wheel driven vehicle. Amid the five days' trying period, all vehicles were consistently completely stacked. For part of the adventure, the vehicles needed to tow an eight-ton field gun. The vehicles were tried for rough terrain capacities in even, - profound snow. One of the Vanajas was annihilated in a mishap. The residential vehicles performed well in the test; sometimes the back wheel driven Sisus and Vanajas beat the 4ÄÂ4-driven remote contenders. None of the vehicles were plainly superior to anything the others yet the outcome persuaded the Defense Forces of the abilities of the household vehicles and prompted a few arrangements for SAT and VAT. 

In 1960, VAT conveyed the first Vanaja VAKS lorries, which were proposed for general use in armies, to the Defense Forces. The later forms were called AS-33. 155 units were created. Vanaja NS-47 was the principal Finnish 4ÄÂ4 rough terrain lorry structured basically for military use. A couple of dozen vehicles were requested somewhere in the range of 1962 and 1964, and were utilized for pulling 35 mm Oerlikon hostile to flying machine guns and substantial mounted guns. 

In September 1958 VAT, together with other Finnish organizations, took part in the Thessaloniki International Fair. The vehicles appeared one Vanaja VAK lorry and a mid-engined VLK550 transport skeleton. Because of the AEC motors the Vanaja's did not raise enthusiasm among the potential Greek clients, as relations between the UK and Greece were awful at the time. The lorry was at long last sold in Greece yet the transport case came back to Finland and was sold to a transport administrator which assembled a traveler transport body on it. 

Tank marked an agreement to pitch 200 lorries to Turkey in 1959. The initial two vehicles were transported from Finland in 1959 yet the agreement was ended in a humiliating manner on the grounds that the Bank of Finland would not take Turkish liras in installment. 

Toward the finish of the 1950s and in the mid 1960s, VAT and the French Camions WillÄÂ¨me SA had plans for joint creation, however just a single together delivered model was ever constructed; the body was from Vanaja, the motor was from AEC, and the lodge, which was a forward control type lodge and somewhat produced using glass fiber, was from WillÄÂ¨me. 

Four Vanaja's were appeared at the Barcelona universal reasonable in June 1961. The vehicles were taken to the reasonable by driving them through Europe. The reasonable was viewed as fruitful, however no vehicle deals came about because of it. 

General Manager Eero KytÄÅlÄÂ¤ left his situation in 1962. DI Ilmari Karttunen, who had recently filled in as manufacturing plant director, was delegated the new leader of the organization. He drove VAT until 1967, when Jaakko Jarimo took the post. 

Amid 1958Ã¢ÂÂ1960 VAT concentrated progressively on custom-building vehicles as indicated by client demand. Commonly a potential client just strolled into the principle office in Helsinki or processing plant in HÄÂ¤meenlinna and depicted what sort of vehicle he needed. The eager specialists listened cautiously to each individual client's desires and planned vehicles as needs be, with a few axles, wanted format, wheelbase and with traditional or forward control lodge. Numerous vehicle types were created for a couple of units. The volume show, be that as it may, was a nine-ton variation of the VAK arrangement. 

A genuine case of custom-constructed vehicles are the VKB arrangement forward-control vehicles, produced for an earthmoving organization in Helsinki. The organization required short vehicles with a decent evaluation capacity and high payload. The wheelbase of these vehicles was and the all out weight was 10.6Ã¢Â tonnes; utilization of these vehicles on open streets required an extraordinary license. 

A run of the mill include in Vanajas was over-built structures which were strong instead of streamlined. The primary segments were sourced from entrenched providers. Tank additionally indicated dynamic reasoning in driver ergonomics; the easily sprung and using pressurized water damped driver's seat was situated near the entryway, to ease switching. The seat had a few manners by which it could be balanced. Hanging pedals, which were set to a similar dimension, ended up standard at a beginning period. Vanaja's inside radiator, which created 9,000Ã¢Â kcal/h, was perhaps the most productive accessible in lorries by the 1960s. Numerous Vanaja drivers esteemed the especially delicate suspension of the vehicles. Two-hub lorries were accessible in 4ÄÂ2 and 4ÄÂ4 designs; the three-hub models were created as 6ÄÂ2, 6ÄÂ4, 4ÄÂ4+2 and 6ÄÂ6. 

Tank praised its twentieth commemoration in 1963. All official statements and distributions disregarded the way that its key rival, SAT, had a huge job in its establishment. Yhteissisu was not referenced in any specific situation. 

Tank got a striking request from the Infrastructure and Hydro Engineering Administration in April 1965. The request for 250 vehicles was subsidized by an advance from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) for improvement of the street arrange. Forty vehicles were furnished with a determined front hub. The request was finished in 1966. 

The organization confronted a troublesome circumstance again in 1967 when the absolute number of vehicles created was only 381 units. Toward the start of 1968 VAT terminated 40 of the 400 workers. Vanaja had its staunch client base and the vehicles were commonly all around respected yet the general piece of the pie stayed low; in 1963 only 4Ã¢ÂÂ5% of the recently enlisted overwhelming lorries in Finland were Vanajas. The profoundly altered creation had prompted an intemperate decent variety of models, which made extra part supply troublesome. Also, the tweaking apparently removed assets from specialized advancement work. There was no improvement in spite of the fact that the organization presented its advanced forward control show B6-76 which was relied upon to turn into the following volume demonstrate. 

The first production line building, authoritatively a distribution center and get together corridor, had a volume of . The offices were created after some time and before the finish of 1953, the floor region was . The distribution center and gathering lobby were renamed the primary corridor; it was currently long and wide. Transport undercarriage creation was situated at the southern side of the lobby and lorries were worked at the northern side. This set-up was frequently changed relying upon the item blend and generation volume. 

Toward the finish of the structure was a crane for ironware taking care of. At the point when the casings were taken in, they were fitted with suspension and axles, and afterward turned the correct far up. The following parts were the motor and transmission segments. The last part for lorries was a pre-gathered lodge. Traditional transport case were conveyed with cap and wings, however the forward control types left the production line with no body parts. In the wake of being painted, the vehicles left the get together corridor. At last, every vehicle was tried on a - long trial on various streets and with different burdens. The transport undercarriage were tried likewise; on the grounds that there was no body, the drivers just had comfortable garments and driving goggles to ensure them against the climate conditions. The vehicles were given over to the clients after conclusive modifications. 

Development take a shot at another subassembly shop started in 1955 and the structure was prepared in 1957. The new offices were for machining, heat treatment and sheet metal works. Another finish of the structure was for an administration workshop. Another administration workshop with 17 vehicle spots was worked in 1966. 

Tank could offer just petroleum motors until 1953. The most well-known ones were the Hercules motors made locally under permit by SAT and Tampella. The SAT-made motor was known as the Sisu AMG or SA5, and the motor made by Tampella was the Tampella 6000. The second most normal motor was the Cadillac V8 1G and the third was the White 160 AX, which KytÄÅlÄÂ¤ had purchased from Central Europe. Some Bedford petroleum motors were utilized in Defense Forces lorries during the 1960s and Ford V8 motors were utilized for flame motors. The primary diesel Vanajas were fueled by Saurer and KÄÂ¤mper motors. By far most of diesel motors were provided by Leyland and AEC. A couple Vanajas were furnished with the Perkins R6 or the Ford Trader 510E. Sometimes, the motor was given by the client; one Vanaja was controlled by a Mercedes-Benz diesel motor. 

Tank utilized Valmet gearboxes, which were duplicated from the transmissions made by the American organization Fuller in the late 1940s and the mid 1950s. At the point when segments turned out to be all the more effectively accessible, VAT began to utilize veritable Fullers and ZF-made gearboxes. The exchange cases were provided by Timken and ZF. Tank fabricated the back axles from riggings made by ATA until the organization began purchasing axles from Timken. 

The organization had a few providers of lorry lodges; they were delivered toward the start by Tampella, Valmet, MessukylÄÂ¤n Autokoritehdas, Auto-Heinonen, Kiitokori and later as a fundamental provider by Lahden Autokori. Tank itself made lodges for some uncommon, one-off items. In the late 1960s, some Vanajas were furnished with British Ergomatic forward control lodges made by Motor Panels. The lodges were purchased by means of A.E.C. 

Transport undercarriage generation started in 1950. Tank made the primary models of back engined transports in 1956. The organization made two model suspension, which were assigned model VAT-4800; the superstructures were made by mentor manufacturers Ajokki Oy and Nummela Oy. The arrangement caused a few specialized issues, including appropriate cooling and exchange of warming to the front end of the body. The cooling issue was at last understood by a vast air scoop situated at the back of the rooftop; this was not viewed as a tastefully satisfying plan. As the arrangement was discovered, VAT delivered ten progressively back engined frame called type VAT-5200. 

By 1958, all VAT transport undercarriage were furnished with air powered brakes; later these were likewise fitted to lorries. The choice was impacted by one of the most noticeably awful street car crashes to occur in Finland; 15 individuals suffocated in Konnevesi when a genuinely new Vanaja transport drove through the blast hindrance of a ship slip, soaking in of water. The driver endure and said the transport's brakes had fizzled; this was affirmed in the accompanying examination, which found the fixing of one of the water powered Lockheed brakes had fizzled. 

Tank conveyed its first mid-engined transport body to Ajokki Oy mentor works in April 1958. It was controlled by an on a level plane mounted 164-hp AEC diesel motor. The end client was transport administrator VÄÂ¤inÄÅ Paunu Oy, which likewise took an interest in the advancement work. In 1960, VAT presented the VLK500 skeleton with air suspension and double circuit compressed air brakes. Tank came back to building back engined transports in 1966Ã¢ÂÂ67, however deals did not achieve the dimension of the mid-and front-engined models. The organization directed various analyses with the development; one precedent was a transport with a frameless structure in which the bars were supplanted by a lighter arrangement. 

The model classification of the mid 1950s was as per the following: 

Letter "B" toward the end, for instance in model VK-6B, implied forward control lodge and "L" originated from additional long springs. 

The lorry show names were changed in 1956. 

The transport demonstrate names changed likewise. 

What's more, the model name "Tank" was utilized for two back engined transport models: the VAT-4800of which two units were delivered in 1956, and the VAT-5200BDof which ten units were created in 1957. The following change came in 1961, when a motor producer's code was incorporated into the model name. For instance, the VAK lorry fueled by an AEC AVU 470 turned into the A-47. Correspondingly, a similar lorry with a Leyland O.600 diesel turned into the A-60R; the "R" meant "raskas" (substantial), which means it had a more grounded front hub. The transport demonstrate names changed again in a similar way. For instance, a forward control transport with the Leyland O.600 motor was known as the VLB-60. 

The new model numbering was changed in 1963 in view of expanded front pivot loads; after the letter code a 2 demonstrated the higher hub limit. In later models, a 6 implies the front pivot limit is 6 tons. The "S" in sorts VAKS, AS and NS signified "sotilas" (warrior); they were expected for military use. 

The transport demonstrate numbering changed once and for all in 1966; the front-engined VLB progressed toward becoming LE6, the mid-engined VLK was changed to LK6 and the back engined VLT moved toward becoming LT6. The three-digit numbers on the hat sides of the last Vanaja lorries show the motor dislodging in cubic inches. They are not demonstrate numbers, in spite of the fact that they are regularly erroneously alluded to accordingly. 

In 1964, VAT had begun to look for a more grounded accomplice when it consulted with AB Scania-Vabis. The organizations wanted to utilize Scania motors in Vanaja vehicles yet the arrangement demonstrated unreasonably costly for VAT. This may have driven the real proprietors of VAT to begin dialogs about combining VAT and SAT. The director of VAT held standard gatherings with the SAT supervisor Tor Nessling. In 1967, AB Scania-Vabis communicated its enthusiasm for VAT and German organization KlÄÅckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG was keen on co-activity with, or securing of, VAT. Valmet is additionally supposed to have been keen on VAT however there is no proof of solid arrangements. 

Just as being a little maker, VAT had issues with questionable conveyances and quality issues brought about by the part providers. Semi-completed lorries frequently sat tight outside the manufacturing plant for motors or other key parts. The British diesel motors experienced greater quality issues contrasted and their Swedish and German contenders. The organization's proprietors turned out to be progressively hesitant to subsidize the unrewarding business. 

Theory about a merger among SAT and VAT started in Swedish papers in 1967 and was before long grabbed by the Finnish media. The real proprietor, the province of Finland with its 45% offer, recommended a merger to Nessling in December 1967. The money related circumstance of VAT was unsustainable; the entire year's turnover was 19.5 million new Finnish imprints when the organization had obligations of 14.5 million; 100 old Finnish imprints ended up 1 new imprint in 1963. The agreement for the merger of Suomen Autoteollisuus and Vanajan Autotehdas was marked on 30 May 1968. Tank was formally suspended toward the finish of 1968. After the merger, the state possessed 17.2% of the new SAT, turning into the third-biggest investor of the organization. 

Clients' responses to the merger fluctuated. A large portion of the open comprehended the requirement for the merger of two little organizations, which were both working in a constrained market and endeavoring to challenge the mass makers. Some reliable Vanaja clients were surprised at the choice to stop the make. A few clients were vexed on the grounds that the keep going since quite a while ago nosed Vanajas were furnished with lodges from Jyry-Sisu; they said they could never purchase Sisu and moved to imported vehicles. Many demonstrated specialized arrangements utilized in Vanajas were before long executed on Sisus. The drop in the truck showcase was brief and deals before long came back to the dimensions experienced by Vanaja and Sisu joined in the mid-1960s. The last Vanaja vehicles were versatile cranes created toward the finish of 1971; therefore all vehicles made in the SAT HÄÂ¤meenlinna works were badged as Sisus. 

Consolidating the qualities of the two organizations was not fruitful in transport undercarriage creation due to vital errors by SAT. The Vanaja LK-arrangement with a huge, halfway mounted motor was ceased, which prompted the loss of the fundamental client, VÄÂ¤inÄÅ Paunu Oy. SAT offered Sisu suspension to supplant the Vanaja models, however various transport administrators, including TKL, rejected them. 

The quantity of Vanaja lorries and transport case delivered totalled 7,140Ã¢Â units. What's more, many trailers and semi-trailers were created and sold under the Vanaja brand regarding lorries. In 1955, four Vanaja rail transports made in a joint effort with coachbuilding firm Kiitokori were sold to the Finnish State Railways. 

Around 260 models of lorry were created, which were fitted with 35 kinds of motor, 20 distinctive gearboxes, and 15 to 20 sorts of lodge. A large number of the models were delivered in little numbers, with 116 kinds just being spoken to by a couple of units. A large portion of the distinctions originated from unique wheelbases that constantly required endorsement from the specialists. By and large, it is inconceivable notwithstanding for specialists to recognize diverse models and long periods of creation.

The merger prompted a conflict of two authoritative societies. While VAT had a level association, open correspondence among its workforce and a soul of harmony, SAT's association was carefully progressive. The division of portfolios among Karis and HÄÂ¤meenlinna was changed after the merger. Lorry creation was progressively gathered at Karis and Sisu-HÄÂ¤meenlinna concentrated on delivering versatile cranes, transport frame, terminal tractors and military vehicles. Previous VAT work force needed to build creation of the new portfolio and all the while receive new procedures, so it was three to four years before the HÄÂ¤meenlinna processing plant could convey results in accordance with its ability.

SAT's military vehicle generation was moved from the Karis Works to HÄÂ¤meenlinna in 1970. The Sisu A-45 vehicle was later trailed by the presentation of two heavier variants; the Sisu SA-150 and the Sisu SA-240. Generation of the heavily clad work force bearer Sisu XA-180 "Pasi" began in the mid 1980s.

Other military items were the Sisu NA-140 "Nasu", which was delivered from 1985 to 2002, and the mine-freedom vehicle Sisu RA-140 DS "Raisu", 41 of which were created somewhere in the range of 1994 and 2001. 

In 1985, the organization moved its hub creation from Helsinki to another processing plant at HÄÂ¤meenlinna. In 1995, pivot generation was isolated into a free unit called Sisu Axles; this was sold to financial specialists in 1999. The primary plant fabricates military vehicles; the state isolated it from the parent organization in 1996 and renamed it Patria Vehicles Oy. Its primary items are Patria AMV heavily clad staff bearers. 

Vanaja was here and there portrayed as "one of the world's best lorries" in view of the organization's capacity to build a vehicle perfect for every application as per the client's desires. The merger of SAT and VAT has motivated various creative paranoid fears. As a general rule, the securing pursued an ordinary procedure that was started by the proprietors. Specialists in the field collectively concur that the merger guaranteed the Finnish vehicle industry would proceed with well into what's to come. Vanajas are esteemed by vintage vehicle fans.
