"The Atlantic" Kevin Fallon called the center fragments "an affection letter to the Judy Garland specials it respected" and said it was a "strong move" for an arrangement with standard youth offer, and Rae Votta of "Bulletin" thought the "reverence was a sparkling case of what "Joy" can do when given the elbowroom to be peculiar and extraordinary", and was another who wished it could have run the whole scene.

Sue's unexpected difference in conduct in this scene caused Kubicek to ask when she had turned into "the ethical compass on this show", and Bell pondered, "how does Ryan Murphy anticipate that us should like a character that constantly changes", given that at whatever point she appears to go "toward another path, she goes to her equivalent merriment club-despising ways".

VanDerWerff concurred that there was "no rhyme or reason for Rachel to sing it", and Flandez considered it a "forgettable form". Futterman's decision was that "it feels a little called in and doesn't candidly interface".

Various analysts had an issue with "Do They Know It's Christmas?" being set in a destitute haven; both Hyman and West considered it an "odd decision", and Slezak said he "battled" with the area. Chaney called the verses "stooping", and found the juxtaposition of the vocalists' grinning faces and the expression "clanking tolls of fate" to be "bizarre". The tune itself was given great imprints: Hyman considered it the scene's "best execution" since "they each conveyed something uncommon to it", and Futterman said that New Directions "channels the feeling of the first for a fitting vocal top to the night". Both Slezak and West gave it a "B+", and the previous proclaimed that "they sang the living hell out of it".
