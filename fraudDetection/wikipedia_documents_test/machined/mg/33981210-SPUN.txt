A private listening party for BeyoncÄÅ¡'s fourth studio collection, "4", was hung on May 12, 2011. She offered a select gathering of fans a see of five melodies from "4" and the official video for the lead single "Run the World (Girls)". On that event, "I Care" was one of the tunes reviewed. Starting on June 16 to June 27, 2011, the melodies from "4" were accessible to tune in to in full every day on BeyoncÄÅ¡'s legitimate site, matched with its going with photograph spread from the collection bundling and a smart statement.

Jordan Young otherwise known as DJ Swivel blended "I Care" at New York's KMA Studio. He told "Sound on Sound", "I didnÃ¢ÂÂt truly realize I was going to blend 'I Care' until the latest possible time. Fortunately, over the span of the collection, I had two or three days to myself and I blended it since I had an inclination that it, so the demo was at that point to some degree blended, and B[eyoncÄÅ¡] let me do the last blend moreover." 

"I Care" involved 75 tracks altogether: 35 for the music and 40 for the vocals. As indicated by Swivel, the principle challenge in blending "I Care" was handÃ¢ÂÂaligning each and every drum shot as the time had come expending. He stated, "It's superÃ¢ÂÂmonotonous, however it's the most ideal way I can do it. On the off chance that you Beat Detective the drums to the matrix, it's never flawless." As the layering of the drums must be spot on the millisecond, Swivel completed one kick and catch at any given moment. This helped him guarantee that the kicks line up with the modified drums, henceforth forestalling any stage reversal. As needs be, each drum punched through as unequivocally as the last. The motivation for the fundamental drum sound on "I Care" came to Swivel at around four o'clock in the first part of the day amid a blending session. He took a huge plate sound from AvidÃ¢ÂÂs DÃ¢ÂÂVerb plugÃ¢ÂÂin, rolled the high frequencies off at 8.6ÃÂ kHz, and sent it through a SSL channel strip with an entryway on it, setting the discharge time to 0.6 seconds. He stated, "It's an extremely fundamental plugÃ¢ÂÂin, and I utilized a very [19]80sÃ¢ÂÂsounding gated reverb." 

When he had the sound, he moved off the base to "take the sloppiness out". It was in reality twofold reverbed; the gated reverb was just on the catches and the toms, and the remainder of the unit all in all had another plate reverb, which fell off the Lexicon 960, for smoothing it out.

You end up discovering something you like about it, and that is the place the passionate connection to a sound becomes possibly the most important factor." Swivel frequently replaces or enlarges sounds with tests, attempting to understand the maker's vision. Thus in "I Care", he included two or three kicks underneath the first kick and pitched them down an octave, so that "[the listener] couldn't hear them however could feel them on enormous speakers." Swivel additionally said that it began with "a dim, nearly warehouseÃ¢ÂÂsounding" kick, and he at that point added a little pound to it.

He further clarified, "I just put a brisk EQ on the vocal toward the finish of a chronicle session in the event that I have been cutting her, however blending is unmistakably increasingly specific, so I invested a great deal of energy dialing in the ideal recurrence." For the defer tosses in the refrains on "I Care", he sent it through an extensive lobby reverb at 50 percent Ã¢ÂÂ half reverb, half clean Ã¢ÂÂ then through an Amp Farm plugÃ¢ÂÂin for the dirt, and that at that point experienced a quarterÃ¢ÂÂnote delay. In the extension, ÄÅ¡ matches the guitar solo vocally Ã¢ÂÂ that was multiplied Ã¢ÂÂ and one of the vocal tracks has an Amp Farm on it to add to that dirt. To do equity to the large number of vocal tracks inside the melody, Swivel made a stereo field utilizing some astute panning strategies and a Waves S1 Imager plugÃ¢ÂÂin. He said that it was important that at whatever point he blends a record, "I loathe hardÃ¢ÂÂpanned L/R. To get the correct width, I dish them all diversely in sets: 40/40, 60/60, 70/70, 80/80, 90/90, and OK, perhaps one is 100/100, however this procedure is at last what makes the stereo field." Swivel utilized Waves' SSL EÃ¢ÂÂChannel plugÃ¢ÂÂin to shape BeyoncÄÅ¡'s lead vocal. He took a Waves S1 Imager and spread with that without disengaging he width. He included that something is hardÃ¢ÂÂpanned, it feels excessively confined and furthermore befuddles the audience's ears. Swivel clarified further, "I like smooth sound, and with B[eyoncÄÅ¡] that works fine as sheÃ¢ÂÂs so great at coordinating everything. I like a mass of foundation vocals. It's the most ideal method for putting your vocal in each zone of the stereo field: a wide solid, yet youÃ¢ÂÂve still got something there in the center."
