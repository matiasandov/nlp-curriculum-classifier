Robert le diable 

Robert le diable ("Robert the Devil") is a musical drama in five acts made by Giacomo Meyerbeer from a lyrics composed by EugÄÂ¨ne Scribe and Germain Delavigne. "Robert le diable" is viewed as one of the primary amazing musical shows at the Paris OpÄÅ¡ra. It has just a shallow association with the medieval legend of "Robert the Devil". 

The musical show was promptly fruitful from its first night on 21 November 1831 at the OpÄÅ¡ra; the emotional music, agreement and coordination, its exaggerated plot, its star artists and its shocking stage impacts constrained FrÄÅ¡dÄÅ¡ric Chopin, who was in the gathering of people, to state, "If at any point brilliance was found in the theater, I question that it achieved the dimension of wonder appeared in "Robert"...It is a masterpiece...Meyerbeer has made himself everlasting". "Robert" started the European notoriety of its writer, combined the distinction of its librettist, Scribe, and propelled the notoriety of the new chief of the OpÄÅ¡ra, Louis-DÄÅ¡sirÄÅ¡ VÄÅ¡ron, as a purveyor of another type of musical drama. It likewise had effect on improvement of the artful dance, and was as often as possible referenced and talked about in contemporary French writing. 

"Robert" proceeded as a most loved in musical drama houses everywhere throughout the world all through the nineteenth century. After a time of disregard, it started to be restored towards the finish of the twentieth century. 

Giacomo Meyerbeer's initial examinations had been in Germany, however from 1816 to 1825 he worked in Italy. There he examined musical show, at that point ruled by Gioachino Rossini, and composed his very own Italian musical shows, which were modestly fruitful and furthermore had a few exhibitions in other European nations. The accomplishment of "Il crociato in Egitto" (1824) all through Europe, incorporating at Paris in 1825, induced Meyerbeer, who was at that point thirty-three years of age, to satisfy finally his aspiration to base himself in Paris, and to look for a reasonable lyrics for a musical show to be propelled there. 

Meyerbeer first notices "Robert le diable" in his journals in February 1827. The "Diary de Paris" reported on 19 April 1827 that the lyrics of Scribe and Delavigne had been passed by the blue pencil and that 'the music is to be depended to an arranger, M. Meyer-Beer, who, having procured a splendid notoriety in Germany and Italy, is extending it to our nation, where a few of his works have been as of now effectively spoke to.' 

The lyrics was manufactured based on old legends about Duke Robert the Magnificent of Normandy, the dad of William the Conqueror, claimed in certain variants to have been the child of the Devil. The librettists cushioned out this diagram with an assortment of exaggerated episodes. The plot mirrored 'the awesome incredible components which intrigued the musical show open of 1830', a taste which had developed from the 1824 Paris creation of Carl Maria von Weber's "Der FreischÄÅºtz" (in its French rendition "Robin des bois"), which additionally includes a far fetched legend become friends with by a devil promising him achievement. 

The lyrics was initially arranged as a three-demonstration "opÄÅ¡ra comique" for the OpÄÅ¡ra-Comique theater. Meyerbeer ceased deal with the musical show in 1827 when the auditorium experienced money related troubles. In August 1829, the writer and librettists consented to refashion the work in a five-demonstration structure to meet the prerequisites of the Paris OpÄÅ¡ra. This involved some critical modifying of the storyline, diminishing the basically funny job of Raimbaut (who evaporates after Act 3 in the last form, however whose shenanigans Ã¢ÂÂ including the spending of Bertram's cash Ã¢ÂÂ proceeded all through in the prior lyrics). It likewise implied that the conventional 'matching' of darlings in opÄÅ¡ra comique (Robert/Isabelle paralleled all through by the 'bring down class' Raimbaut/Alice) was cleared aside for focus on the more electrifying story-line of Robert's devilish family line. 

The agreement for the musical show, indicating it as a "terrific musical show in five acts and seven scenes", was marked by the then chief of the OpÄÅ¡ra, ÄÂmile Lubbert, on 29 December 1829. Meyerbeer finished the structure of the work in Spa, Belgium in June and July 1830. Its characterisation as a 'stupendous musical drama' put it in progression to Auber's "La muette de Portici" (1828) and Rossini's "Guillaume Tell" (1829) in this new sort. The author attempted further work on the musical drama in mid 1831, changing over spoken sections to recitatives and including artful dance scenes, including, in Act 3, the "Expressive dance of the Nuns", which was to demonstrate one of the musical drama's extraordinary sensations, and which Henri Duponchel had proposed to supplant the first unexceptional situation set in Olympus. He likewise revamped the two noteworthy male jobs of Bertrand and Robert to suit the gifts of Nicolas Levasseur and Adolphe Nourrit, individually. 

The musical drama debuted on 21 November 1831 at the Paris OpÄÅ¡ra. The achievement owed a lot to the musical drama's star artists Ã¢ÂÂ Levasseur as Bertram, Nourrit as Robert Ã¢ÂÂ and to the provocative "Expressive dance of the Nuns" in the third demonstration, including the incredible ballet dancer, Marie Taglioni. 

The movement for the artful dance was expounded by the ballet performer's dad, Filippo Taglioni. The gathering of people's scurrilous thoroughly enjoy this shocking scene is very much passed on by the commentator for the "Revue des Deux-Mondes": A horde of quiet shades floats through the curves. Every one of these ladies push off their nuns' ensemble, they shake off the virus powder of the grave; abruptly they dedicate themselves completely to the joys of their previous existence; they move like bacchantes, they play like masters, they drink like sappers. What a joy to see these light ladies... The set for the expressive dance was an imaginative and striking plan by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had additionally presented specialized developments for the organizing, including 'English devices' for the abrupt appearance and vanishing of the phantoms. (Meyerbeer was directed to whine that the display was excessively and was pushing his music away from plain sight). Taglioni moved the Abbess just multiple times in Paris; she was supplanted by Louise Fitzjames, (who moved the job multiple times). 

At the welcome of Nourrit, CornÄÅ¡lie Falcon made her presentation at 18 years old at the OpÄÅ¡ra in the job of Alice on 20 July 1832. The cast included Nourrit. Albeit experiencing stage alarm, Falcon figured out how to sing her first aria without blunder, and completed her job with "simplicity and fitness." Her disastrous attitude and dim looks were profoundly proper to the part, and she established a distinctive connection on general society, which included on that night Auber, Berlioz, HalÄÅ¡vy, Maria Malibran, Giulia Grisi, HonorÄÅ¡ Daumier, Alexandre Dumas and Victor Hugo. On hearing her in the job, Meyerbeer himself pronounced his musical show finally 'total'. 

By April 1834 the musical drama had gotten more than 100 exhibitions in Paris. Nourrit sang the job of Robert until 1837, when he was supplanted as head tenor at the OpÄÅ¡ra by Gilbert Duprez, whom, in any case, Meyerbeer disliked in the job; nor did he affirm of an option, Lafont. Be that as it may, he was awed by the newcomer Mario (Cavaliere Giovanni Matteo di Candia), and composed for him another aria for Robert which was performed at his introduction in the restoration of the musical show on 30 November 1838. Mario's presentation was the dispatch of his extremely fruitful vocation. Others singing in the 1838 recovery included Julie Dorus-Gras (Alice), Prosper DÄÅ¡rivis (Bertram) and FranÄÂ§ois Wartel (Raimbaut). By Meyerbeer's demise in 1864 the musical drama had been performed more than multiple times in Paris alone. 

A progression of portrayals all through Europe and in the Americas propelled Meyerbeer's universal acclaim. A variant of the musical drama Ã¢ÂÂ under the title of "The Fiend-Father", by Rophino Lacy Ã¢ÂÂ was first introduced in London at the Theater Royal, Drury Lane on 20 February 1832; the first form showed up at the Haymarket Theater on 11 June of that year. Silky's variant was given in New York on 7 April 1834. In 1832 the musical drama achieved Berlin, Strasbourg, Dublin and LiÄÂ¨ge; in 1833 Brussels, Copenhagen, Vienna and Marseilles; in 1834 Lyon, Budapest, The Hague, Amsterdam and Saint Petersburg; in 1835 (12 May) it got its first American execution in the first French at the ThÄÅ¡ÄËtre d'OrlÄÅ ans in New Orleans. Italian variants were given in Lisbon in 1838, and in Florence in 1840. 

Meyerbeer took specific consideration over the principal London and Berlin creations. He headed out to London to check the vocalists and generation for the first form, and mentioned that the German interpretation for Berlin be attempted by the artist Ludwig Rellstab, emphatically prescribing that Taglioni and her dad Fillipo be reconnected, and that Ciceri's sets ought to be recreated. Despite the fact that Taglioni moved and the sets were held, the interpretation was in the end completed by Meyerbeer's companion Theodor Hell. Meyerbeer composed extra expressive dance music for Taglioni for the Berlin creation. 

The Danish choreographer August Bournonville saw Fitzjames' execution as the Abbess in Paris in 1841, and based his own movement, which was utilized in Copenhagen somewhere in the range of 1833 and 1863, on this. This movement, which has been completely saved, speaks to the main record of Filippo Taglioni's unique. 

In 1847 Felix Mendelssohn went to a London act of "Robert" Ã¢ÂÂ a musical show which musically he loathed Ã¢ÂÂ so as to hear Jenny Lind's British introduction, in the job of Alice. The music commentator Henry Chorley, who was with him, stated "I see as I compose the grin with which Mendelssohn, whose satisfaction in Mdlle. Lind's ability was boundless, turned round and took a gander at me, as though a heap of uneasiness had been removed his brain." 

Amid the mid twentieth century, Meyerbeer's musical dramas bit by bit vanished from the stage, somewhat because of their length and cost to mount, halfway because of their denigration by supporters of Wagnerian musical show. In 1898, George Bernard Shaw, in "The Perfect Wagnerite", had just cast hatred on "Robert" and remarked that "These days youngsters can't see how anybody could have paid attention to Meyerbeer's impact." 

All things considered, creations of "Robert" incorporated those in New Orleans and Nice in 1901, Paris (at the GaitÄÅ¡ Lyrique) in 1911, Barcelona in 1917, at the Vienna Volksoper in 1921 and Bordeaux in 1928. The principal creation after the Second World War was in Florence in 1968, an abbreviated variant with a cast including Renata Scotto and Boris Christoff. In 1984 the restoration at the Paris OpÄÅ¡ra with Rockwell Blake (Robert), Samuel Ramey (Bertram), Walter Donati (Raimbaut), MichÄÂ¨le Lagrange (Alice) and June Anderson (Isabelle) was the primary execution there since 1893. In 1999 another generation was mounted at the Prague State Opera. 

An act of another basic release of "Robert le diable" by Wolfgang KÄÅºhnhold was exhibited at the Berlin State Opera in March 2000 with Jianyi Zhang (Robert), Stephan RÄÅºgamer (Raimbaut), Kwangchul Youn (Bertram), Marina Mescheriakova (Alice), and Nelly Miricioiu (Isabelle), directed by Marc Minkowski. 

Another generation of the musical show, coordinated by Laurent Pelly, was debuted at the Royal Opera House London on 6 December 2012, the first occasion when it had been performed there since 1890. 

At La Monnaie, Brussels, there are booked show exhibitions of "Robert le Diable" for April 2019, with Dmitry Korchak as Robert, Nicolas Courjal as Bertram and Lisette Oropesa as Isabelle, led by Evelino PidÄË. 

The plot of the musical show has been frequently cut or adjusted in different preparations. The framework given underneath pursues the portrayal given in "The New Grove Dictionary of Opera" (1992). 

"On the shore at Palermo" 

Robert and his puzzling companion Bertram are among a gathering of knights who are getting ready to contend in a competition for the hand of Princess Isabelle. They all recognition wine, ladies and betting ("Versez ÄÂ  tasses pleines"). Robert's orderly Raimbaut sings a ditty about a delightful princess from Normandy who wedded a fiend; the princess had a child, Robert, known as 'le diable'. Robert irately uncovers that he is the child being referred to and sentences Raimbaut to death. Raimbaut asks for acquittal and discloses to Robert that he is locked in to wed. Robert yields and relishes the possibility of the "droit du seigneur". Raimbaut's fianceÄÅ¡ arrives; Robert perceives her as his cultivate sister Alice and absolutions Raimbaut. Alice reveals to Robert that his mom has kicked the bucket and that her final words were a notice about a compromising dull power ("Va! Va! dit-elle"). She offers Robert his mom's will. Robert is too defeated to peruse it and approaches Alice to keep it for the present. Robert communicates his aching for his cherished Isabelle and Alice offers to take a letter to her. Alice cautions Robert to be careful with Bertram however he overlooks her. With Bertram's support, Robert bets with the knights and loses the majority of his cash, just as his protective layer. 

"A room in the castle at Palermo" 

Isabelle is miserable at Robert's nonappearance and communicates her unease that their marriage will never occur ("En vain jÃ¢ÂÂespÄÂ¨re"). She is enchanted when she gets Robert's letter. Robert arrives and the pair express their pleasure at being as one once more. Isabelle furnishes him with new protective layer for the competition. Robert is getting ready for the competition when Bertram all of a sudden shows up and induces Robert to go to an adjacent woodland, guaranteeing that the Prince of Granada, his opponent for Isabelle's adoration, needs to battle with him. At the point when Robert has left, the court accumulates to commend the marriage of six couples with moving. The Prince of Granada enters and asks Isabelle to give him arms for the competition. Isabelle communicates her distress at Robert's vanishing however gets ready to open the competition, singing in acclaim for gallantry ("La trompette guerriÄÂ¨re"). 

"The farmland close Palermo" 

Bertram meets Raimbaut, who has touched base for a rendezvous with Alice. He gives him a sack of gold and encourages him not to wed Alice as his new riches will pull in a lot of ladies ("Ah! lÃ¢ÂÂhonnÄÅte homme"). Raimbaut leaves and Bertram boasts at having adulterated him. Bertram uncovers that Robert, to whom he is genuinely committed, is his child; he at that point enters an abutting cavern to cooperative with the spirits of damnation. Alice enters and communicates her affection for Raimbaut ("Quand je quittai la Normandie"). She catches odd reciting originating from the cavern and chooses to tune in; she discovers that Bertram will lose Robert everlastingly in the event that he can't convince him to transfer ownership of his spirit to the Devil by midnight. On rising up out of the cavern, Bertram understands that Alice has heard everything ("Mais Alice, quÃ¢ÂÂas-tu donc?"). He compromises her and she guarantees to keep quiet. Robert arrives, grieving the loss of Isabelle, and Bertram reveals to him that to win her he ought to catch an enchantment branch from the tomb of Saint Rosalia in a close-by betrayed group. In spite of the fact that to take it is heresy, the branch will give Robert enchanted forces. Robert announces that he will be striking and do as Bertram trains. Bertram drives Robert to the shelter. The apparitions of nuns ascend from their tombs, enticed by Bertram, and move, adulating the delights of drinking, betting and desire. Robert catches the branch and fights off the evil presences who encompass him. 

"A room in the royal residence" 

Isabelle is getting ready for her marriage with the Prince of Granada. Alice surges in to educate her regarding what she has found out about Robert, however she is hindered by emissaries of the Prince who enter with a bounty of presents blessings. Robert arrives and, utilizing the intensity of the branch, solidifies everybody aside from himself and Isabelle. 

Agitated by the power he's using, he admits to Isabelle that he is utilizing black magic, yet implores her not to dismiss him.

Midnight strikes and the ideal opportunity for Bertram's upset is past. He is attracted down to hellfire. Robert is brought together with Isabelle in the church, to extraordinary celebrating. 

The outfits were planned by . 

Various variables impacted the musical drama's truly great gathering. The underlying cast contained driving vocalists of the period and, as it changed, similarly splendid stars (for example Bird of prey) were presented as substitutions. The shocking plot and the reputation of the Nuns' expressive dance guaranteed that the musical show was an interesting issue in diaries and surveys. This was helped by the showcasing aptitudes of the chief VÄÅ¡ron and the distributer Schlesinger. The view was of excellent quality: "This was as much a musical drama to see as to hear, and it has been contended that the genuine legend behind "Robert le diable" was CicÄÅ¡ri, the creator." Meyerbeer was quick to keep powerful people on his side. For instance, he sent free tickets for 'a great box' to Heinrich Heine. What's more, obviously the agent VÄÅ¡ron realized how to utilize (and pay) the claque and its pioneer Augustin Levasseur. 

In any case, without a doubt the curiosity and shade of the music of Meyerbeer merits significant credit. The union of his German melodic preparing, alongside his investigation of musical show for a long time in Italy, was exceedingly appealing to a Parisian group of onlookers which 'requested that just be astounded and shocked.' The faultfinder Ortigue composed that Meyerbeer 'straight away [took] his situation at the junction where Italian tune and German arrangement need to meet.' Meyerbeer gave close consideration to irregular blends and surfaces and unique organization, models being the utilization of low metal and woodwind playing chromatic sections related with Bertram; the utilization of a metal band and male choir to portray the devils in Act 3, etc. Hector Berlioz was especially inspired; he composed a whole article in the "Revue et journal musicale", entitled 'On the Orchestration of "Robert le diable" ', which closed: 

The musical drama was seen to have shortcomings of portrayal. For instance, Robert's vacillating conduct prompted one remark that "what is least wicked in "Robert le diable" is Robert himself." But the commentator FÄÅ¡tis gave the accord sentiment: ""Robert le diable" isn't just an artful culmination; it is additionally a striking work inside the historical backdrop of music ...[it] appears to me to join every one of the characteristics expected to set up an author's notoriety unshakeably." 

The accomplishment of the musical drama prompted Meyerbeer himself turning into a VIP. Lord Frederick William III of Prussia, who went to the second execution of "Robert", quickly welcomed him to create a German musical drama, and Meyerbeer was welcome to arrange "Robert" in Berlin. In January 1832 he was granted participation of the LÄÅ¡gion d'honneur. This achievement Ã¢ÂÂ combined with Meyerbeer's known family riches Ã¢ÂÂ definitely likewise encouraged jealousy among his companions. Berlioz stated "I can't overlook that Meyerbeer was just ready to convince [the OpÄÅ¡ra] to put on "Robert le diable" ... by paying the organization sixty thousand francs of his own cash"; and Chopin bemoaned "Meyerbeer needed to labor for a long time and pay his own costs for his stay in Paris before "Robert le diable" could be arranged ... Three years, that is a great deal Ã¢ÂÂ it's excessively." 

The accomplishment of "Robert" had significant outcomes, for the organization of the Paris OpÄÅ¡ra itself, for the music, arranging and ubiquity of nineteenth century musical show all in all, and for expressive dance. 

The random planning of the musical show's debut, not long after the July Revolution, and its shocking and novel impacts, implied that it was generally related to the new, liberal, thoughts of the July Monarchy. As Berlioz remarked, Meyerbeer had "the karma to be capable, however the ability to be fortunate." HonorÄÅ¡ de Balzac (in his novella "Gambara") and Heinrich Heine (in his lyric "AngÄÅ¡lique") are only two of the contemporary scholars to express their interest with the musical drama. Alexandre Dumas set a part of "The Count of Monte Cristo" between two demonstrations of "Robert"; and George Sand expounded on it finally in her "Lettres d'un voyageur". It is the main nineteenth-century musical drama to have a rose named after it. 

Likewise, the nonappearance of boring authentic substance in "Robert" without a doubt had an influence in drawing in the bourgeoisie to the musical show, up to that point viewed as fundamentally a blue-blooded amusement. The achievement of the musical drama likewise legitimized the administration's approach of 'privatization' in pitching the administration to VÄÅ¡ron, and this was a milestone in the weakening of state control and support in the expressive arts. In spite of the fact that VÄÅ¡ron had not charged it (having taken control simply after the Revolution), "Robert" was his first new generation as director of the OpÄÅ¡ra, and its prosperity endorsed his arrangement of appointing comparable works. These were to incorporate Meyerbeer's "Les Huguenots", Fromental HalÄÅ¡vy's "La Juive", and Daniel Auber's "Gustave III". Be that as it may, while they utilized 'the equivalent stunning dramatic talk' as "Robert", they prompted 'consistently awful dÄÅ¡nouements' with 'holding moral direness', their progressively modern plot-lines mirroring the adjustments in taste of the new musical drama customer base. They , with the OpÄÅ¡ra itself as its middle, in the period 1830 until 1850. 

The Act 3 artful dance is viewed by some as the first of the "ballet productions blancs" (whereby the key ballet dancer and the corps de expressive dance are altogether dressed in white) which turned into a most loved of the nineteenth-century collection. Later models incorporate "La Sylphide" (1832) (additionally arranged by Filippo Taglioni and moved by his girl), "Giselle" (1841), "Pas de Quatre" (1845) and "Les Sylphides" (1909). 

Music from the musical drama turned into the subject of various virtuoso works of the time. The splendid interpretation of its topics ("Reminiscences de Robert le diable") made by the writer and virtuoso Franz Liszt was popular to the point that it turned into his calling card: over and over he was compelled to interfere with his modified shows to play it on account of the requests of the gathering of people. Upon the arrival of its production by Maurice Schlesinger, the release of 500 was totally sold out and it must be promptly republished. Without a doubt, the accomplishment of "Robert", whose score was additionally distributed by Schlesinger, was said to have spared him from chapter 11. FrÄÅ¡dÄÅ¡ric Chopin and Auguste Franchomme mutually created a "Stupendous couple concertant" on subjects from the musical show, for cello and piano, in 1832, and the Italian musician and writer Adolfo Fumagalli formed an intricate dream on the musical drama for left hand alone as his Op. 106. 

Different pieces dependent on the musical show included works by Adolf von Henselt and Jean-AmÄÅ¡dÄÅ¡e MÄÅ¡reaux. 

Edgar Degas painted the scene of the Nuns' expressive dance twice. The prior variant (1871) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. In 1876 Degas painted a bigger adaptation for the vocalist Jean-Baptiste Faure (who had sung the piece of Bertram); this variant is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. 

The work's notoriety produced numerous spoofs and pastiches including one by W. S. Gilbert, "Robert the Devil", which opened at the Gaiety Theater, London in 1868. It is referenced in the opening scene of Andrew Lloyd Webber's "The Phantom of the Opera", where a sale thing is portrayed as "Parcel 664: a wooden gun and three human skulls from the 1831 creation of "Robert le Diable" by Meyerbeer."
