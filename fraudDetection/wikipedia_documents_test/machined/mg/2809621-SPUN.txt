In 1890s London, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden function as peddlers for a conjurer, under the mentorship of John Cutter, an ingÄÅ¡nieur who structures arrange enchantment. In one trap, Angier's significant other Julia is to escape from a water tank while tied up. Julia neglects to evade amid one execution and suffocates. Angier, crushed, blames Borden for utilizing a more hazardous bunch, causing her demise. The two become harsh adversaries. 

Angier and Borden dispatch their very own enchantment professions. Borden builds up a trap he calls the Transported Man, in which he seems to travel in a split second between two closets on inverse closures of the stage. Unfit to recognize Borden's technique, Angier enlists a twofold, Gerald Root, to play out his very own rendition of the trap. The impersonation is a more noteworthy achievement, yet Angier is disappointed, as he closes the trap covered up under the stage while Root lounges in the praise. 

Angier has his right hand Olivia keep an eye on Borden to figure out how he plays out the Transported Man. Be that as it may, Olivia experiences passionate feelings for Borden and turns into his aide. With her assistance, Borden subverts Angier's demonstration. Gone up against by Angier, Olivia gives him a duplicate of Borden's encoded journal. Angier interprets it in the wake of compelling the catchphrase "TESLA" from Borden by taking steps to execute Borden's ingÄÅ¡nieur, Fallon. 

The journal takes him to America to meet researcher Nikola Tesla, whom Angier accepts fabricated a machine for Borden. Tesla denies this, and Angier understands the journal is deceitful, made as a diversion. Be that as it may, Tesla consents to construct the machine for Angier. Be that as it may, rather than transporting objects, his creation copies anything set inside it a separation far from the machine. Tesla is in the long run driven from Colorado Springs by specialists of his opponent, Thomas Alva Edison, however as he leaves he has the machine conveyed to Angier. In a joined letter, he encourages Angier to pulverize it. 

Borden's significant other, Sarah, is headed to suicide by his conflicting identity. In London, Angier debuts the Real Transported Man utilizing Tesla's machine, seeming to have transported over the theater. Borden sneaks behind the stage and witnesses Angier fall through a trapdoor and suffocate in a tank. He is found by Cutter and swung over to the police. Unfit to demonstrate his blamelessness, Borden is discovered liable of homicide and condemned to death. 

In jail, Borden is visited by an operator of Lord Caldlow, who offers to think about Borden's little girl Jess in return for Borden's traps. Borden concurs. Caldlow uncovers that he is Angier and Borden asks for his life, yet Angier disregards him. At the point when Cutter understands that Angier is as yet alive, he is nauseated that he permitted Borden to be condemned, yet consents to enable him to discard Tesla's machine. Borden is hanged for Angier's homicide. 

Angier returns to the theater. A more bizarre enters and shoots Angier, uncovering himself as Borden. Angier finds Borden was a couple of indistinguishable twins, sharing a personality. Borden clarifies he and his sibling played out the first Transported man together, and that at whatever point one was "Borden", the other was veiled as "Fallon"; the enduring twin cherished Sarah while his sibling had adored Olivia. Each execution made another Angier, who suffocated in a tank underneath the stage. Angier bites the dust and drops his light, setting the performance center ablaze. Borden leaves and gets Jess at Cutter's workshop. In the consuming theater, lines of tanks hold dead Angiers. 

Julian Jarrold's and Sam Mendes' maker moved toward Christopher Priest for an adjustment of his novel "The Prestige". Minister was inspired with Nolan's movies "Following" and "Keepsake", and in this way, maker Valerie Dean drew the book out into the open. In October 2000, Nolan headed out to the United Kingdom to advertise "Token", as Newmarket Films was experiencing issues finding a United States wholesaler. While in London, Nolan read Priest's book and imparted the story to his sibling while at the same time strolling around in Highgate (an area later included in the scene where Angier ransoms Borden's ingÄÅ¡nieur in Highgate Cemetery). The advancement procedure for "The Prestige" started as an inversion of their prior coordinated effort: Jonathan Nolan had pitched his underlying story for "Token" to his sibling amid an excursion. 

After a year, the choice on the book wound up accessible and was acquired by Aaron Ryder of Newmarket Films. In late 2001, Nolan wound up occupied with the after generation of "Sleep deprivation", and requested that his sibling Jonathan help chip away at the content. The composition procedure was a long joint effort between the Nolan siblings, happening discontinuously over a time of five years. In the content, the Nolans accentuated the enchantment of the story through the sensational account, playing down the visual portrayal of stage enchantment. The three-demonstration screenplay was purposely organized around the three components of the film's figment: the vow, the turn, and the renown. "It required a long investment to make sense of how to accomplish true to life forms of the exceptionally artistic gadgets that drive the interest of the story," Christopher Nolan told "Assortment": "The moving perspectives, the possibility of diaries inside diaries and stories inside stories. Finding the true to life reciprocals of those scholarly gadgets was exceptionally unpredictable." Although the film is specifically reliable to the novel, two noteworthy changes were made to the plot structure amid the adjustment procedure: the novel's mysticism subplot was evacuated, and the cutting edge outline story was supplanted with Borden's hang tight for the hangman's tree. Cleric endorsed of the adjustment, depicting it as "an uncommon and splendid content, an interesting adjustment of my novel." 

In mid 2003, Nolan wanted to coordinate the film before the generation of "Batman Begins" quickened. Following the arrival of "Batman Begins", Nolan began up the undertaking once more, consulting with Jackman and Bale in October 2005. While the screenplay was all the while being composed, creation originator Nathan Crowley started the set plan process in Nolan's carport, utilizing a "visual content" comprising of scale models, pictures, illustrations, and notes. Jonathan and Christopher Nolan completed the last shooting draft on January 13, 2006, and started creation three days after the fact on January 16. Recording finished on April 9. 

Crowley and his team hunt Los Angeles down right around seventy areas that took after balance de siÄÂ¨cle London. Jonathan Nolan visited Colorado Springs to look into Nikola Tesla and put together the electric globule scene with respect to genuine investigations led by Tesla. Nathan Crowley helped plan the scene for Tesla's development; It was shot in the parking garage of the Mount Wilson Observatory. Affected by a "Victorian innovator tasteful," Crowley picked four areas in the Broadway theater region in downtown Los Angeles for the film's stage enchantment exhibitions: the Los Angeles Theater, the Palace Theater, the Los Angeles Belasco, and the Tower Theater. Crowley additionally transformed a bit of the Universal back part into Victorian London. Osgood Castle in Colorado was additionally utilized as an area. 

Nolan manufactured just a single set for the film, an "under-the-arrange area that houses the hardware that makes the bigger hallucinations work," liking to just dress different Los Angeles areas and sound stages to remain in for Colorado and Victorian England. Rather than most period pieces, Nolan kept up the snappy pace of generation by shooting with handheld cameras, and abstained from utilizing fake lighting in certain scenes, depending rather on regular light on area. Outfit planner Joan Bergin picked appealing, current Victorian styles for Scarlett Johansson; cinematographer Wally Pfister caught the inclination with delicate earth tones as white and dark hues gave foundation contrasts, conveying on-screen characters' appearances to the forefront. 

Altering, scoring, and blending completed on September 22, 2006. 

The competition among Angier and Borden overwhelms the film. Fixation, mystery, and penance fuel the fight, as the two mystical performers contribute a lot to a dangerous duel of one-upmanship, with heartbreaking outcomes. Angier's fixation on beating Borden costs him Cutter's companionship, while giving him his very own accumulation dead clones; Borden's fixation on keeping up the mystery of his twin leads Sarah to scrutinize their relationship, in the long run bringing about her suicide when she speculates reality. Angier and one of the twins both lose Olivia's affection due to their brutality. At last, Borden is hanged and the last duplicate of Angier shot. Their battle is likewise communicated through class fighting: Borden as "The Professor", a common laborers conjurer who gets his hands messy, versus Angier as "The Great Danton", a tasteful, elitist actor whose emphasize influences him to seem American. Film commentator Matt Brunson asserted that an unpredictable subject of duality is exemplified by Angier and Borden, that the film decides not to portray either performer as great or malevolence. 

Angier's robbery of Borden's teleportation hallucination in the film echoes some true instances of stolen traps among conjurers. Outside the film, comparable competitions incorporate conjurers John Nevil Maskelyne and Harry Kellar's disagreement about a levitation deception. Gary Westfahl of "Locus Online" likewise noticed "another proclivity for pandemonium" in the film over the novel, refering to the homicide/suicide mien of Angier's copies and increased savage demonstrations of vengeance and counter-retribution. This "identifies with an increasingly broad modification in the occasions and tone of the film" as opposed to essentially changing the basic subjects. 

Nor is this topic of merciless challenge restricted to skillful deception: the content fuses the well known idea that Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison were legitimately occupied with the War of Currents, a contention over electrical guidelines, which shows up in the film in parallel to Angier and Borden's opposition for supernatural amazingness. In the novel, Tesla and Edison fill in as foils for Angier and Borden, individually. 

Nook Shewman of "Inventive Screenwriting" says the film asks how far one would go to commit oneself to a workmanship. The character of Chung Ling Soo, as indicated by Shewman, is a similitude for this topic. Film pundit Alex Manugian alludes to this topic as the "importance of duty." 

Nicolas Rapold of "Film Comment" addresses the focuses raised by Shewman and Manugian as far as the film's "refracted take on Romanticism": 

For Manugian the focal topic is "fixation," yet he likewise takes note of the supporting subjects of the "idea of trickery" and "science as enchantment." Manugian scrutinizes the Nolans for endeavoring to "smash such a large number of topics into the story."

Scott gave the film a "two approval" rating. Todd Gilchrist of IGN extolled the exhibitions of Jackman and Bale while commending Nolan for making "this perplexing story as effectively justifiable and powerful as he made the ostensibly direct comic book adjustment ("Batman Begins") thick and complex... any really extraordinary execution is nearly as much acting skill as it is genuine ability, and Nolan has both in spades." "CNN.com" and "Town Voice" film commentator Tom Charity recorded it among his best movies of 2006. Philip French of "The Observer" suggested the film, looking at the competition between the two principle characters to that of Mozart and Salieri in the exceptionally acclaimed "Amadeus".

Kirk Honeycutt of "The Hollywood Reporter" felt that characters "...are minimal more than representations. Expel their fixations, and the two conjurers have little identity." Nonetheless, the two analysts commended David Bowie as Tesla, just as the generation esteems and cinematography. On a less difficult note, Emanuel Levy has stated: "Regardless of whether watchers see "The Prestige" as unpredictably intricate or just pointlessly confounded would depend to a huge degree on their eagerness to suspend doubt for two hours." He gave the film a B grade. 

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, depicting the disclosure toward the end a "central defect" and a "cheat." He stated, "The vow of Nolan's "The Prestige" is that the film, having been allegorically sawed in two, will be reestablished; it falls flat when it cheats, as, if the entire lady delivered on the stage were not a similar one so lamentably cut in two." R.J. Carter of "The Trades" felt, "I cherish a decent sci-fi story; simply let me know ahead of time." He gave the film a BÃ¢ÂÂ.

In spite of the fact that the analyst was intrigued with the score's thought, Jarry found the execution was "very frustrating." 

Christopher Coleman of "Tracksounds" felt that however it was "...a flawlessly fitting score," it was totally overpowered by the film, and absolutely unnoticed now and again.
