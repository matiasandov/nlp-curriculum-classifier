Drizzt has since turned into a mainstream courageous character of the Forgotten Realms setting, and has been highlighted as the principle character of a long arrangement of books, beginning sequentially with "The Dark Elf Trilogy". As an atypical drow (dull mythical being), Drizzt has spurned both the malevolent methods for his kin and their home in the Underdark, in the drow city of Menzoberranzan. 

Drizzt's story is told in Salvatore's dream books in "The Icewind Dale Trilogy", "The Dark Elf Trilogy", the "Inheritance of the Drow" arrangement, the "Ways of Darkness" arrangement, "The Hunter's Blades Trilogy", the "Advances" arrangement, and the "Neverwinter Saga", just as in the short stories "The Dowry", "Dim Mirror", and "Confidants at Odds".

Drizzt Do'Urden's accounts are set in the Forgotten Realms battle setting for "Cells and Dragons". The character has been a pillar for creator R. A. Salvatore, showing up in his books for more than 20 years. Drizzt is a drow who acts against the drow generalization, favoring kinship and harmony over scorn and brutality. His strange identity makes the contention that permits Salvatore to make such a significant number of books with tales about fearlessness and kinship. Drizzt battles the dim qualities that are innate in the drow. 

Salvatore utilizes Drizzt to speak to issues of racial preference, especially in "The Dark Elf Trilogy".

Drizzt was made unintentionally. In 1987 R.A. Salvatore sent Mary Kirchoff, at that point overseeing manager of TSR's book office, a composition for what might turn into his 1990 novel "Echoes of the Fourth Magic". She enjoyed it, however inquired as to whether he could revise it to occur in the Forgotten Realms. She sent him "Darkwalker on Moonshae" by Douglas Niles, the main novel at the time set in the Forgotten Realms. Salvatore sent her a proposition for a spin-off of "Darkwalker", however Kirchoff sent back a huge guide of the Forgotten Realms and disclosed to him she needed another story set in an alternate piece of the Realms. Following two weeks of telephone calls, Salvatore found a spot on the guide that was not as of now assigned for another venture, and he found Icewind Dale there. As indicated by Salvatore, the book was "set on the Moonshae Isles, on the grounds that at the time I felt that "was" the Realms. When I discovered how enormous the Realms were, I moved the story a thousand miles toward the north." 

Salvatore made Drizzt on the off the cuff. He was feeling the squeeze to make a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale arrangement. Salvatore had sent an early form of "The Crystal Shard" (what might turn into his initially distributed novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was en route to an advertising meeting concerning the book, and educated him that they couldn't utilize one of the characters. He requested time to think, yet she was at that point late for the gathering. Off the highest point of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was suspicious, yet Salvatore persuaded her it would be fine since he was only a sidekick. She asked his name, and he answered Drizzt Do'Urden. She inquired as to whether he could spell it, and he said "no way". Reviewing Drizzt's creation in a meeting, Salvatore stated, "I don't have a clue where it originated from. I surmise that Gary Gygax simply made such an astonishing showing with regards to in making the drow mythical people that something about them stalled out in the back of my head. Express gratitude toward God!" Although numerous perusers have expected that Drizzt depends on one of the many "Cells and Dragons" pretending efforts that the creator has played, this isn't the situation. Salvatore's principle impacts were traditional writing and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. "I like to consider Drizzt a cross between Daryth from "Darkwalker on Moonshae" and Aragorn from "The Lord of the Rings"." Salvatore calls Drizzt "the great sentimental heroÃ¢ÂÂmisunderstood, holding to a code of goals notwithstanding when difficult situations arise, and getting no gratefulness for it more often than not." 

Drizzt's story starts in the novel "Country", the beginning of "The Dark Elf Trilogy" and distributed as a prequel in 1990 to "The Icewind Dale Trilogy", which was distributed somewhere in the range of 1988 and 1990.

The 1996 short story "The Fires of Narbondel", in the "Domains of the Underdark" collection, depicts random occasions including Zaknafein as the primary character, and a youthful Drizzt assumes a supporting job. 

Amid an assault against a gathering of surface mythical beings, Drizzt gets himself unfit to take part in the butcher with his individual drow. He claims to execute a mythical person tyke, however causes her to get away. At the point when the trickery is found, Zaknafein is relinquished in Drizzt's stead to mollify Lolth, the drow's goddess. Following a war against another House, Drizzt curses his family and the shrewdness drow ways and departures Menzoberranzan into the Underdark. As of now he likewise procures the statuette that enables him to call the enchanted puma Guenhwyvar. Guenhwyvar goes close by as he advances over the Realms.
