Scratch Griffin 

Nicholas John Griffin (brought into the world 1 March 1959) is a British government official who spoke to North West England as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 2009 to 2014. He filled in as executive and afterward leader of the extreme right British National Party (BNP) from 1999 to 2014, when he was ousted from the gathering. 

Conceived in Barnet, Griffin was taught at Woodbridge School in Suffolk. He joined the National Front at 14 years old and, following his graduation from the University of Cambridge, turned into a political laborer for the gathering. In 1980 he turned into an individual from its administering body, and later composed articles for a few conservative magazines. He was the National Front's possibility for the seat of Croydon North West in 1981 and 1983, yet left the gathering in 1989. In 1995 he joined the BNP and in 1999 turned into its pioneer. He remained as the gathering's hopeful in a few races and turned into an individual from the European Parliament for North West England in the 2009 European races. 

In 1998, Griffin was indicted for circulating material prone to impel racial disdain, for which he got a suspended jail sentence. In 2006 he was vindicated of independent charges of affecting racial disdain. Griffin has been reprimanded for a significant number of his remarks on political, social, moral and religious issues, however in the wake of getting to be pioneer of the BNP he looked to remove himself from a portion of his recently held positions, which incorporate Holocaust disavowal. Lately, occasions where Griffin has been welcome to take an interest in open discussions or political exchanges have demonstrated disputable and frequently brought about challenges and retractions. 

The child of previous Conservative councilor Edgar Griffin (who was ousted from the Conservatives in the midst of allegations of prejudice) and his significant other Jean, Nicholas John Griffin was conceived on 1 March 1959 in Barnet and moved to Southwold in Suffolk matured eight. He was taught at Woodbridge School before winning a sixthÃ¢ÂÂform grant to the free Saint Felix School in Southwold, one of just two young men in the all-young ladies school. 

Griffin read Adolf Hitler's "Mein Kampf" when he was 14, and "discovered everything except one section incredibly exhausting". He joined the National Front in 1974, while he was still 14, however he needed to imagine he was 15, and at 16 years old is accounted for to have remained at the home of National Front coordinator Martin Webster. In a four-page pamphlet written in 1999, Webster professed to have had a gay association with Griffin, at that point the BNP's attention chief. Griffin has denied any such relationship. 

From 1977, Griffin considered history, at that point law, at Downing College, Cambridge. His association with the National Front was uncovered amid a Cambridge Union discussion, and his photo was distributed in an understudy paper. He later established the Young National Front Student association. He graduated with an inferior distinctions degree in law (2:2), and a boxing blue, having taken up the game after a fight in Lewisham with an individual from an enemy of fundamentalist gathering. He enclosed multiple times against Oxford the yearly Varsity coordinate, winning twice and losing once. In a meeting with "The Independent", he said he surrendered it due to hand damage. He is a devotee of Ricky Hatton and Joe Calzaghe, and an admirer of Amir Khan. 

Following his graduation, Griffin turned into a political laborer at the National Front central command. As an adolescent he had went with his dad to a National Front gathering, and by 1978, he was a national coordinator for the gathering. He helped set up the White Noise Music Club in 1979, and quite a while later worked with white power skinhead band, Skrewdriver. In 1980, he turned into an individual from the gathering's overseeing body, the National Directorate, and around the same time propelled "Patriotism Today" with the guide of Joe Pearce, at that point editorial manager of the NF youth paper "Bulldog". As a National Front part, Griffin challenged the seat of Croydon North West twice, in the 1981 by-race and 1983 general decision, verifying 1.2% and 0.9% of the vote. 

Participation of the National Front declined fundamentally following the race of the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher. Thus, the gathering turned out to be more radicalized, and a disappointed Griffin, alongside individual NF activists Derek Holland and Patrick Harrington, started to grasp the goals of Italian extremist Roberto Fiore, who had touched base in the UK in 1980. By 1983, the gathering had split away to frame the NF Political Soldier group, which upheld a restoration of nation "values" and an arrival to feudalism with the foundation of patriot cooperatives. Composing for "Bulldog" in 1985, Griffin adulated the dark dissenter Louis Farrakhan, however his remarks were disagreeable with certain individuals from the gathering. He additionally endeavored to shape partnerships with Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini, and lauded the endeavors of Welsh patriot development Meibion GlyndÄºÄ¾r. 

Following a conflict with Harrington (who consequently framed the Third Way), and complaints over the course the gathering was going, in 1989, Griffin left the National Front. Alongside Holland and Fiore, he helped structure the International Third Position (ITP), an improvement of the Political Soldier development, yet left the association in 1990. Around the same time, he lost his left eye when a disposed of shotgun cartridge detonated in a heap of consuming wood, since when he has worn a glass eye. The mishap left him unfit to work, and attributable to other budgetary issues he therefore requested of for chapter 11 (the mishap happened in France, where he later lost cash in a fizzled business venture). For quite a long while from there on, he refrained from governmental issues and was upheld monetarily by his folks. He later managed an open Holocaust refusal meeting facilitated by David Irving. 

Griffin returned legislative issues in 1993 and, in 1995, at the command of John Tyndall, joined the British National Party (BNP). He likewise progressed toward becoming editorial manager of two conservative magazines possessed by Tyndall, "Initiate" and "The Rune". Alluding to the race of the BNP's first councilor, Derek Beackon, at a 1993 committee by-decision in Millwall, he composed: 

Tyndall, likewise already in the National Front, had established the BNP in 1982, yet his "ruthless, streetfighting foundation" and profound respect for Hitler and the Nazis had made any sort of decency outlandish. In his 1999 initiative crusade, Griffin left on a system to make the gathering electable, by removing it from Tyndall's radical picture. He was helped by Tyndall's absence of recognition with the predominant press, and in the gathering's September decision he vanquished Tyndall to move toward becoming leader of the BNP. One of Griffin's progressions included directing the gathering's accentuation on the expulsion of multiculturalism, an arrangement it claims affects both settler and British societies. Griffin vowed to wipe out "the three Hs: hobbyism, hard talk and Hitler". This realignment was intended to position the BNP close by fruitful European far-right gatherings, for example, the French "Front National". Road dissents were supplanted by constituent battling, and a few arrangements were directed (the necessary repatriation of ethnic minorities was rather made deliberate). Different strategies incorporated the presentation of the death penalty for pedophiles, attackers, street pharmacists and a few killers, and whipping for less genuine wrongdoings, for example, adolescent misconduct. Griffin's picture as a Cambridge-taught family man was as opposed to the fanatic picture introduced by the BNP under Tyndall's authority. In October 1999, Nick Griffin, bolstered by Tony Lecomber remained against Tyndall for initiative of the BNP. John Tyndall got only 411 (30%) of the votes, while Griffin the dominant part, 70%. 

Griffin hosts remained as his gathering's competitor in a few English decisions since joining the BNP. In 2000, he remained in West Bromwich West, in a by-race activated by the abdication of Betty Boothroyd. He came fourth, with 794Ã¢Â votes (4.21% of those cast). Following the Oldham race riots he kept running in Oldham West and Royton in the 2001 general decision. He got 6,552Ã¢Â votes (16%), coming third in front of the Liberal Democrats, yet firmly behind the second spot Conservatives, who got 7,076Ã¢Â votes. He again represented decision in the 2003 Oldham Council race, for a seat speaking to the Chadderton North ward. He came next to the Labor applicant, getting 993Ã¢Â votes (28%). In the 2004 European Parliament decision, when he was the BNP contender for the North West England electorate, the gathering got 134,959 votes (6.4% of those cast), yet won no seats. In the 2005 general decision he challenged Keighley in West Yorkshire, and surveyed 4,240Ã¢Â votes (9.2%), completing in fourth spot. 

Griffin was the BNP applicant in the 2007 Welsh National Assembly Elections, in the South Wales West district. The BNP got 8,993Ã¢Â votes (5.5% of those cast), behind the Labor gathering's 58,347Ã¢Â votes (35.8%). In October 2007, he was an ineffective competitor in the Thurrock Council race. In November 2008, the whole enrollment rundown of the BNP was posted on the Internet (however the rundown may host included slipped by individuals from the gathering and individuals who had communicated an enthusiasm for joining the gathering, yet had not joined). Griffin guaranteed that he knew the character of the individual dependable, portraying him as a firm stance senior worker who had left the gathering in the earlier year. He respected the attention that the story produced, utilizing it to depict the basic view of the normal BNP part as a "skinhead oik" as false. 

He was chosen as an individual from the European Parliament for North West England in the 2009 European Elections. The BNP surveyed 943,598Ã¢Â votes (6.2%), increasing two MEPs. Griffin and individual MEP Andrew Brons were in this manner pelted with eggs as they endeavored to organize a celebratory question and answer session outside the Houses of Parliament. A second venueÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ an open house close ManchesterÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ was picked the next day. A line of police obstructed an extensive gathering of nonconformists, who recited "No stage for Nazi Nick" and "Nazi filth off our boulevards". Griffin saw the decision as an essential triumph, asserting that his gathering had been decried and obstructed from holding open gatherings. "In Oldham alone there have been a huge number of pounds spent on utilizing false network specialists to keep us out. To triumph against that dimension of weight as an ideological group has never been finished." 

In May 2009, he was welcomed by the BNP delegate on the London Assembly, Richard Barnbrook, to go with him to a Buckingham Palace garden party facilitated by Queen Elizabeth II. The welcome incited protests from a few associations and open figures, including the Mayor of London Boris Johnson, and the counter extremist association Searchlight. Griffin declined this first welcome, out of dread of humiliating the Queen through affiliation, however when welcomed by and by in 2010 he acknowledged: 

The Palace later chose to deny Griffin passage to the occasion, asserting that he had utilized his welcome "for gathering political reason through the media", and refering to security concerns. Griffin asserted the choice was an "outright embarrassment", and had all the earmarks of being "a standard designed for me". 

In September 2009, he engaged gathering activists for ÃÅ150,000 of additional subsidizing for the BNP. In the letter, he said that the gathering's sickly fortunes were an immediate aftereffect of "assaults on the gathering". He likewise guarded inquiries by the Electoral Commission about the straightforwardness of BNP financing. In November 2009, Griffin was an observer at the preliminary of an Asian man, Tauriq Khalid, at Preston Crown Court. The arraignment asserted that in November 2008 Khalid over and again drove past a showing that Griffin was visiting, and on the second event yelled "white rats". Khalid conceded yelling derisory remarks at Griffin and different demonstrators, telling the jury he yelled "Scratch Griffin, you screwing wanker" and "Get the fuck out of Burnley, you're not greet here", yet denied yelling "white knave". Griffin gave proof against Khalid, and attested that Khalid had yelled "white knave" at him. Griffin said the man "inclined out of the vehicle and pointed at me and made a weapon and pack motion", and that he compromised him by yelling "I'm going toÃ¢Â ...". Griffin said he had left the exhibition early, dreading for his wellbeing. The 23-year-old litigant denied his remarks had any racial plan, and was found not liable. Griffin later remarked "I believe it's tragic and I believe it's wrong, yet that is the jury's correct. They saw all the proof, I acknowledge their choice. I'm not going to lose any rest over it." 

In the 2010 general race he challenged the Barking voting public surveying 6,620Ã¢Â votes and completing in third spot. In 2011, after the loss of a significant number of the chamber situates the BNP held in England, Griffin barely endure an authority challenge. 

In 2010, Griffin reported that by 2013 he would remain down as pioneer, to concentrate on his European Parliament race crusade. He lost his seat in Europe in the May 2014 European decision and ventured down as BNP pioneer on 19 July 2014, turning into the association's leader. However, on 1 October, the gathering reported that it had removed Griffin, who, it asserted, was "purposely creating an emergency" and releasing "harming and slanderous charges". Following his takeoff from the BNP, he established the British Unity Party. 

In 1998, Griffin was sentenced for abusing area 19 of the Public Order Act 1986, identifying with the offense of 'distributing or dispersing racially provocative composed material' in issue 12 of "The Rune", distributed in 1996. Griffin's remarks in the magazine were accounted for to the police by Alex Carlile, at that point the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire. Following a police strike at Griffin's home, he was accused of circulating material prone to induce racial scorn. Individual BNP part Paul Ballard was additionally charged, yet entered a blameworthy supplication and did not stand preliminary. Griffin argued not blameworthy, and was attempted at Harrow Crown Court. He called the French Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson and the patriot Osiris Akkebala as observers, was discovered blameworthy and allowed a nine-month sentence, suspended for a long time, and a ÃÅ2,300 fine. Ballard was allowed a six-month sentence, likewise suspended for a long time. He stated: 

Griffin guaranteed that the law under which he was sentenced was an uncalled for law and he in this manner had no commitment to tail it. He was furtively recorded by the ITV program "The Cook Report" in 1997 depicting Carlile as "this bleeding JewÃ¢Â ... whose just case is that his grandparents passed on in the Holocaust". 

Transcripts discharged under a 2014 Freedom of Information (FOI) demand by "The Guardian" asserted that all that he did could be summed up as pursues: "We should verify the presence of our race and a future for white kids. All that I do is identified with structure a patriot development through which tranquil influence and through the polling station can put us in a position whereby those 14 words can be completed." He repeated his dispute of Jewish authority over the media, just as his earlier position on Holocaust disavowal, and said that his point was to "[take] political power to have the capacity to establish changes, to fix the populace move which has occurred since 1948 with the primary Immigration Act, to calmly and as others consciously as conceivable switch that and to return Britain to being a homogeneous white country". 

On 14 December 2004, Griffin was captured at his home in Wales, on doubt of impelling to racial disdain, over comments he made about Islam in a covert BBC narrative titled "The Secret Agent". He was addressed at a police headquarters in Halifax, West Yorkshire, before being liberated on police safeguard. He said that the capture was "a constituent trick to recover the Muslim square vote to the Labor party" and that the Labor government was endeavoring to impact the aftereffects of the next year's general race. 

Griffin's capture was made two days after those of John Tyndall and a few other individuals, over comments they had made in a similar program. Following its communicate on 15 July 2004, the police started an examination concerning the program's substance. The next April he was accused of four offenses of utilizing words or conduct proposed or prone to work up racial contempt. The preliminary started in January 2006. Griffin remained close by individual gathering lobbyist Mark Collett, who dealt with comparative indictments. Arraigning, Rodney Jameson QC told the jury of six discourses that the blamed had made in the Reservoir Tavern in Keighley on 19 January 2004. Perusing passages from them, he asserted that they included undermining, damaging and offending words coordinated at "individuals of Asian ethnicity", with the goal of "working up racial contempt". 

Griffin was likewise blamed for calling killed dark youngster Stephen Lawrence a street pharmacist and menace who stole more youthful understudies' supper cash. In the observer box he protected himself by citing sections from the Qur'an, saying that his remarks depicting Islam as a "horrendous, fiendish confidence" were assaulting not a race, however a religion. Amid the fourteen day preliminary he utilized a workstation to post day by day reports on a blog on the BNP's site. In his end address, guard attorney Timothy King QC stated: 

Griffin and Collett were found not guilty against themÃ¢ÂÂthe jury stayed isolated on different charges, and a retrial was requested. On 10 November 2006, following five hours of consultations, the jury found them not guilty. They were met outside the court by around 200 supporters, who Griffin tended to with an amplifier. He assaulted Tony Blair and the BBC, and protected the BNP's entitlement to the right to speak freely. BNP Deputy Chairman Simon Darby later guaranteed that had Griffin been sentenced, the BNP pioneer intended to go on appetite strike. 

Following his race as BNP pioneer, Griffin was welcome to partake in discussions at a few colleges. In November 2002, the Cambridge Union Society welcomed him to participate in a discussion the next January. Titled "This house trusts that Islam is a danger toward the west", the goals was questionable; nearby progressively moderate speakers, one of those welcomed was Abu Hamza al-Masri, a fundamentalist Muslim minister. A few members took steps to pull back, and a few authority bodies reprimanded the solicitations. The two had met before in the year, in a discussion led by Rod Liddle, at that point proofreader of BBC Radio 4's "Today" program. He was additionally welcomed by the Cambridge Forum to a discussion on radicalism in December 2002, with Liberal Democrat MP Lembit ÄÂpik. The scene was changed twice after challenges from property proprietors, however the danger of a rough encounter between the Anti-Nazi League and BNP supporters constrained the leader of the Cambridge Forum, Chris Paley, to drop the occasion. Paley considered the choice a "possess objective" for the estimations of free discourse, and ÄÂpik censured it, underlining his faith in "individuals' entitlement to settle on their own choices in a popular government". 

In February 2005, Griffin was approached to participate in a discussion on multiculturalism at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He was welcomed by the leader of the understudies' discussing society, who said "We trust that the best way to get reality of what the BNP are stating and to battle them is to do it out in the open in a discussion." The move was assaulted by hostile to supremacist gatherings, some of whom wouldn't take an interest in the discourse. Griffin said "I am coming up in light of the fact that I was welcomed by the understudies at the college since they have a discussion on a shrewd subject on which I have a comment. The general population against it are the typical pack of individuals who can't win the contention and deny to remain on a stage." The general public pulled back the welcome before the occasion was to happen. 

In May 2007, Griffin was welcome to address a gathering at the University of Bath by governmental issues understudy and BNP youth pioneer Danny Lake. Lake needed Griffin to visit the college and disclose the BNP's strategies to teachers and understudies. The welcome was seen by some as an endeavor by the gathering to set up a decent footing on the college grounds. Eleven association general secretaries kept in touch with the college's bad habit chancellor and requested that her rethink the choice to permit the gathering. A substantial challenge was arranged, and following understudies' worries over their own security, the University dropped the welcome. 

A while later, the Oxford Union welcomed Griffin to talk at a gathering on the cutoff points of free discourse, alongside different speakers including David Irving. The welcome was censured by the Equality and Human Rights Commission head Trevor Phillips and the leader of the Oxford Students' Union. The Conservative MP Dr Julian Lewis surrendered his participation of the Union. A rally against the welcome was held at Oxford Town Hall on 20 November, and incorporated the Oxford Students' Union president, the National Union of Students dark understudies' officer, and the Trades Union Congress south east provincial secretary. Delegates of Unite Against Fascism additionally visited, just as the University of Oxford's Jewish understudy minister. A few Holocaust survivors talked at the rally. Stephen Altmann-Richer, co-leader of the Oxford University Jewish Society, said "I don't figure these individuals ought to be welcome to the Oxford Union, by having them talk, it legitimizes their viewsÃ¢Â ..." the evening of the discussion, around 50 dissenters constrained their way into the setting, and a horde of hundreds accumulated outside conveying flags bearing enemy of supremacist mottos and voicing against BNP drones. Police obstructed the passageways to the structure, and evacuated the nonconformists digs in inside. Griffin was went with into the premises by security monitors. The occasion was in the end part between two rooms, with Griffin talking in one, and Irving in the other; numerous Union Society individuals were unfit to obtain entrance. Albeit many present found the discussion offensive, some were steady of both Griffin and Irving's entitlement to the right to speak freely. The Oxford Union later supported the discussion as a triumph. 

Griffin made a trip to the United States and talked at Clemson University and Texas A&M University, however the gathering he got in October 2007 at Michigan State University was uniquely not quite the same as that in different settings. Proposing to address the "overpopulation of Islamists in Europe", he was more than once interfered, to the point where the occasion turned into an inquiry and answer session. He was harassed by threatening components of the group of onlookers, and at one point the flame caution was actuated. 

On 22 October 2009, Griffin partook in the BBC's topical discussion program, "Question Time", as an agent of the BNP. He showed up nearby Bonnie Greer, Jack Straw, Baroness Warsi and Chris Huhne. He was tested by individuals from the studio group of onlookers, and addressed by host David Dimbleby on remarks he had recently made on the Holocaust. He was likewise incredulous of Islam. His welcome pursued the race of two BNP MEPs to the European Parliament, and prompted huge discussion over the benefits of the BBC's choice. The appearance started a challenge outside the BBC Television Center preceding the account of the program, in which an expected 500 individuals picketed the front passageway of the mind boggling, many reciting against Nazi mottos and others attempting to break into the structure to stop the program being taped. Some moved beyond the police and security, however were removed. Six nonconformists were captured, and three cops were harmed, one requiring emergency clinic treatment. 

The program was viewed by an expected 8.2 million watchers, multiple occasions the normal figure for "Question Time", and on an equivalent dimension with prime time amusement appears. Griffin's appearance commanded the next day's media; a subsequent report in the "New York Times" said that "the early perusing by numerous individuals of Britain's significant papers was that Mr. Griffin lost intensely on focuses." 

In a public interview hung on 23 October, Griffin expressed that he would make a formal grievance about the configuration of the program, which he said was "...Ã¢Â not a real "Issue Time"; that was a lynch crowd". He recommended that he ought to show up once more, however that "...Ã¢Â [we] ought to do it legitimately, and talk about the issues of the day", and included: "That group of onlookers was taken from a city that is no longer BritishÃ¢Â ... That was not my nation any more. Why not descend and do it in Thurrock, do it in Stoke, do it in Burnley? Do it some place where there are as yet huge quantities of English and British individuals, and they haven't been ethnically scrubbed from their own nation." 

Griffin depicts himself as a "moderniser", and "new patriot", and after his race as pioneer of the BNP, as per "The Guardian" benefactor Francis Wheen, was "derisive" of the gathering's customary supporters. He has changed the BNP's conventional spotlight on migration and race, to a barrier of what it sees as "our customary standards against the politically right plan" embraced by standard government officials. He has depicted himself as a safeguard of free discourse, and has more than once revolted against multiculturalism. Amid 2000, he endeavored to promote the BNP's well known intrigue by focusing on explicit gatherings, including lorry driversÃ¢ÂÂsome of whom were at the time occupied with mass dissents against fuel pricesÃ¢ÂÂand ranchers. The BNP likewise delivered a diary gave to rustic issues. 

The BNP's constitution allows its director full official control over all gathering issues, and Griffin subsequently conveyed sole duty regarding the gathering's legitimate and monetary liabilities, and had the last say in all choices influencing the gathering. Griffin has much of the time communicated sees on Judaism, Islam and homosexuality. 

Upon his decision to the European Parliament Griffin ineffectively endeavored to shape a coalition with conservative gatherings, which would have qualified the gathering individuals for additional financing. He additionally held converses with other far-right European gatherings, for example, Vlaams Belang and Jobbik. The BNP keeps up ties with Roberto Fiore and fundamentalist gatherings crosswise over Europe. Griffin condemned Gordon Brown's Labor government for its frame of mind toward the BNP, blaming it for treating chose agents of the BNP as "peons". Following his race, in a question and answer session held at an open house in Manchester, he reprimanded the privatization of national ventures, for example, the railroad system, and blamed MPs for the most part for being engaged with this "...Ã¢Â giant plundering of Britain". He charged private enterprises and the "administering tip top" in Britain of structure an "Eurocratic express", a procedure he called "Mussolini fascismÃ¢Â ... under Gordon Brown." He upheld the Gurkhas, expressing that the BNP would enable them and their families passage to the nation for therapeutic treatment "for whatever length of time that they required treatment, or for whatever length of time that they lived." He additionally proposed the expulsion of 100,000 Muslims "traitorous to Britain" and their supplanting with the Gurkhas. 

In the wake of expecting control of the gathering, Griffin tried to move it far from its memorable personality, in spite of the fact that on the BBC's "Newsnight" on 26 June 2001 he expressed that Hindus and whites had both been focused in the "Muslim" mobs of 2001, and in the August 2001 issue of "Character" (a BNP distribution) he guaranteed that extreme Muslim ministers needed "...Ã¢Â militant Muslims to assume control over British urban areas with AK-47 rifles". At the point when met in August 2009 for RT, he separated himself from the present-day National Front, which he asserted is "...Ã¢Â a gathering of skinheads going around with no political bearing, other than that we presume which their lords give them." On "The Politics Show" on 9 March 2003, he seemed to acknowledge ethnic minorities who were at that point lawfully living in the nation, and, on 6 March 2008, he was again met on "Newsnight"; when recounted a survey that exhibited that most common laborers Britons were more worried about medications and liquor than movement, he connected the UK's medication issue with Islam, explicitly Pakistani foreigners. His incorporation on the program was scrutinized by supporter and radio moderator Jon Gaunt, who marked the choice as "lamentable". At the point when asked by "The Times" about worries that his ongoing achievement was foretold in Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood discourse, Griffin answered: 

In a June 2009 meeting with Channel 4 News, Griffin asserted that "There's no such thing as a dark Welshman", which was censured by Vaughan Gething, the principal dark leader of the Welsh NUS and the Welsh TUC, and the primary dark possibility for the Welsh gathering. Remarking on Griffin's case, he said "On that premise, most white individuals wouldn't qualify. It's very evident that Nick Griffin simply doesn't acknowledge that dark British individuals or dark Welsh individuals are qualified for call themselves appropriate, full residents of the nation." Griffin's meeting with "Channel 4 News" was because of a choice by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to explore the BNP's enrollment criteria, which, it expressed, "seemed to segregate on the grounds of race and shading, as opposed to the Race Relations Act." He dismissed cases that the BNP was "acting unlawfully" and said "...Ã¢Â because we are here, as it was brought up, for explicit ethnic groupsÃ¢ÂÂit's nothing to do with shading, your correspondent there said that we'll just lift a finger for white peopleÃ¢ÂÂthat's a straightforward untruth." 

Following the Admiral Duncan bar besieging by previous BNP part David Copeland, Griffin expressed "The TV film of many 'gay' demonstrators parading their depravity before the world's writers indicated exactly why such a significant number of normal individuals discover these animals so ghastly." The BNP states that, secretly, homosexuality ought to be endured, yet that it "ought not be advanced or empowered". It restricted the presentation of common associations and wishes to boycott what it sees as the advancement of homosexuality in schools and the media. 

A progression of messages he posted in October 2012 on the informal community Twitter, with respect to a separation guarantee won by a gay couple, started broad abuse. Cambridgeshire police examined the tweets, which incorporated the couple's location and a recommendation that an "English Justice group" would give them "a touch of show", yet made no further move. In 2012, in spite of the fact that he denied being "against gay", he asserted that common associations undermined "the foundation of marriage, and because of that, kids will kick the bucket throughout the following couple of years, since they'll be raised in homes which aren't hitched". In 2009 he likewise said that: "many individuals discover seeing two developed men kissing in open extremely frightening. I comprehend that gay people don't get that however that is the means by which a great deal of us [Christians] feel." He additionally proposes that gay pride walks "[verge] on heterophobia which, similar to its twin Christianophobia, is on the ascent." 

Composing for "The Rune", Griffin adulated the wartime Waffen SS and assaulted the Royal Air Force for its besieging of Nazi Germany. At Coventry Cathedral he appropriated handouts that alluded to "mass homicide" amid the Second World War besieging of Dresden. Albeit detached, on 9 June 2009 the Royal British Legion composed an open letter to Griffin asking him not to wear a poppy lapel identification. 

During the 1990s Griffin expressed his political belief system could be summed up by the Fourteen Words, which are generally cited as: "We should verify the presence of our kin and a future for white youngsters". Amid a police meet in 1998, he asserted that "all that I do is identified with structure a patriot development through which [...] those 14 words can be done". 

In a BBC meet on 8 June 2009, Griffin asserted that "a dangerous atmospheric devation is basically a deception" and that it "is being abused by the liberal tip top as a methods for saddling and controlling us and the genuine emergency is top oil". He was a delegate of the European Parliament at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference, where he rehashed his case that an Earth-wide temperature boost is a trick, and called backers of activity on environmental change, for example, Al Gore "mass killers" by supporting biofuels, guaranteeing that their utilization would prompt the "third and the best starvation of the cutting edge period". A Greenpeace representative stated, "as a general rule the natural and improvement bunches he has been criticizing have been in the front line of worries about biofuels. Griffin's cases that environmental change is a trick is one of numerous inquisitive things going on between his ears." 

His remarks on the Holocaust (which he once alluded to as "the Holohoax") made as an editorial manager of "The Rune" exhibit revisionism. He scrutinized Holocaust denier David Irving for conceding that up to four million Jews may have passed on in the Holocaust; he expressed "Genuine Revisionists won't be tricked by this new contort to the sorry story of "The Hoax of the Twentieth Century"." In 1997, he told a covert writer that he had refreshed Richard Verrall's booklet "Completed Six Million Really Die?" and, around the same time, he stated "Who are the Mindbenders?", about an apparent control of the media by Jewish figures. Regardless of this, the BNP had a Jewish councilor, Patricia Richardson, and representative Phil Edwards hosts expressed that the get-together additionally has Jewish individuals. The BNP has expressed that it doesn't deny the Holocaust, and that "Digging up statements from 10, 15, 20 years prior is extremely pitiful and, one might say, somewhat fundamentalist."
