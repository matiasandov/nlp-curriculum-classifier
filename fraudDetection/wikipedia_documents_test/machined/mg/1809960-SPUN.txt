The wharf was worked amid the 1860s to draw in sightseers and give a ship port to rail travelers to South Wales. The dock is long and comprises of eight traverses bolstered by steel rails secured by wooden decking, with a structure on the wharf head. 

The wharf opened in 1869 and filled in as an embarkation point for oar steamer journeys for precisely 100 years. Two of the ranges crumbled amid pressure testing in 1970 and pulverization was proposed, however nearby gathering pledges and legacy gifts enabled the wharf to be disassembled for reclamation and reassembled.

The shore at Clevedon is a blend of pebbled shorelines and low rough precipices, with the old harbor being at the western edge of the town at the mouth of the Land Yeo stream. The rough shoreline has been assigned as the Clevedon Shore topographical Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is the side of a mineralised flaw, which runs east-west adjoining the wharf, and structures a little precipice include in Dolomitic Conglomerate on the north side of Clevedon Beach, containing cream to pink baryte together with sulfides. The minerals distinguished at the site include: haematite, chalcopyrite, tennantite, galena, tetrahedrite, bornite, pyrite, marcasite, enargite and sphalerite. Optional adjustment of this gathering has created idaite, covellite and other copper sulfides. The closest stopping to the wharf entrance is on an esplanade over the rough shoreline. 

Amid the Victorian time, Clevedon turned into a prominent shoreline town, having recently been a farming town. Because of improving transport joins, through the Clevedon Branch Line, Clevedon had the capacity to cook for the late nineteenth century fever for washing in the ocean with saltwater showers adjoining the wharf (since crushed, however the establishments can even now be seen), and washing machines on the fundamental shoreline. Numerous English ocean side retreats manufactured docks during the 1850s to pull in vacationers. At Clevedon the travel industry developed after the opening of a branch line from Yatton railroad station which associated it to the Bristol to Exeter Line, empowering travel from the remainder of the nation. It was likewise recommended that a dock could shape some portion of a course from London to South Wales with the utilization of steamers to cross the Severn Estuary. An empowering demonstration was submitted to parliament in 1864. 

In November 1866, the Clevedon Pier Company was framed at an open gathering in the town. The chiefs included Sir Arthur Elton of Clevedon Court. Development of the wharf began at an expense of ÃÅ10,000, with John William Grover and Richard Ward as the designers and Hans Price as the draftsman.

The dock is long or more high water. Every one of the eight ranges is long. The legs are comprised of Barlow rails which are bolted together; one of the rails isolates from the principle bolster near the deck at the top, shaping a transverse bracket joining a rail from the contrary leg of the dock and longitudinal propping is given by further rails. The supporting heaps, which are made of cast iron, are in distance across at the seabed. Altogether roughly 370Ã¢Â tons of created iron was utilized. 

The Severn Estuary has one of the most astounding tidal ranges on the planet, up to , second just to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's pipe shape, its tidal range, and the hidden geography of shake, rock and sand, produce solid tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a strikingly dark colored colouration. The tidal range implies that the legs of the wharf are to a great extent uncovered at low tide and covered up at elevated tide and the arrival organize toward the finish of the dock has a few dimensions to enable pontoons to dock at all phases of the tide. 

The dock was formally opened on 29 March 1869, with a motorcade, groups and a gun volley by the First Somerset Artillery. 

The quantity of rail travelers intersection to South Wales, which had been imagined, was diminished after the opening of the Severn Tunnel in 1886. The passage connected South Gloucestershire in the west of England to Monmouthshire in south Wales, under the estuary of the River Severn. The oar steamer "Waverley" first visited the dock to take on travelers in 1886, and alongside sister boats of the White Funnel Fleet having a place with P and A Campbell gave journeys around the Bristol Channel. Different boats of the armada including "Ravenswood", "Westbound Ho", "Cambria" and "Britannia" routinely called at Clevedon. Different organizations, including the Cardiff-based Edwards, Robertson and Co., in the end taken over by Campbells, visited Clevedon Pier. 

In 1893 the wharf head was supplanted in cast iron with another timber arrival organize, and the dock head structure was finished in 1894. The Toll House on the dock and the adjoining Royal Pier Hotel were both structured by neighborhood modeler Hans Price. In 1899, of the decking was washed away by a tempest, and in 1910, some portion of the arrival arrange was harmed in another tempest and supplanted by a solid arrival organize in 1913. 

The wharf kept on prospering between the First and Second World Wars and into the 1960s, and was visited every now and again by P&A Campbell's steamers. The and were customary guests. 

On 16 October 1970, ranges 7 and 8 of the wharf fallen amid pressure testing, which had been presented during the 1950s as a prerequisite for acquiring protection spread. The tests included the arrangement of polythene tanks long, wide and profound filled to a profundity of , which made a weight of . This reproduced the required burden concurred with the Ministry of Transport. 

Six tanks were utilized for each range and left set up for three hours; the 18 tanks utilized altogether enabled three ranges to be tried at the same time. Toward the finish of the three hours the tanks were exhausted and hauled along the deck to test further ranges. The initial six ranges go without issues, yet under burden the seventh range crumbled, cutting down the eighth and last range, leaving the wharf head and structure standing. 

The Clevedon Pier Preservation Society was framed in 1972 and began crusading for the reclamation of the dock. The area committee connected for consent to decimate the wharf in 1979, however an open enquiry the next year decided that it ought to be held. The structures from the finish of the wharf were taken shorewards in 1982 for capacity fully expecting possible rebuilding; deficient assets were accessible to finish reclamation and the principal arrange was to open the Toll House as a presentation focus in 1984.

The trust, which had been framed by the protection society, additionally got a 99-year rent. The wharf was destroyed in 1985, taken to Portishead dock for reclamation, and reproduced in 1986. 

After a long crusade by neighborhood individuals to raise assets for reclamation (bolstered by Sir John Betjeman, who portrayed Clevedon as "the most excellent wharf in England"), the dock in the end revived. A few assets were raised by "supported planks"Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ little metal plaques with names or messages are trimmed on the wooden boards and seats, recording gifts. Remaking of the dock ranges and decking was finished on 27 May 1989, and the wharf was revived to incredible excitement. The pierhead was as yet closed, in any case, and it was not until 23 May 1998 that it was at last reestablished and opened to the general population, because of subsidizing from the Heritage Lottery Fund. In 1999 the National Piers Society granted Clevedon Pier the title of Pier of the Year, and it likewise won a Civic Trust Award. The dock was re-assigned a Grade 1 recorded structure in 2001, the main other wharf with this status being Brighton's West Pier (to a great extent wrecked by flame and tempests somewhere in the range of 2002 and 2004).
