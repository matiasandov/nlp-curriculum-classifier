Hurricane Danny was a frail and muddled tropical violent wind that framed in August 2009. The fourth tropical framework and third named tempest of the 2009 Atlantic storm season, Danny created on August 26 from the association between a westbound moving tropical wave and an upper-level trough while arranged east of the Bahamas. The tempest never completely developed, and looked like a subtropical twister. It wandered commonly northwestward before being assimilated into another climate framework on August 29. 

Danny had just minor impacts ashore. Notwithstanding, it activated high surf and tear flows from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states, prompting the passing of a 12-year-old kid in North Carolina. The twister's remainders added to boundless precipitation in the upper east United States. At a certain point, some climate gauges anticipated Danny to quickly fortify, and hit Nantucket as a Category 1 tropical storm, in spite of the fact that this never happened. Restricted flooding was accounted for, especially in Pennsylvania. It later caused substantial precipitation and power blackouts in Atlantic Canada. 

Danny started in a tropical wave that left the west bank of Africa on August 18. Convective movement related with the framework quickly started to arrange on August 22, yet wind shear before long ended further advancement. On August 24, rainstorms by and by expanded as the unsettling influence cooperated with an upper-level trough. On August 25, a Hurricane Hunters mission into the framework uncovered an expansive region of typhoon compel twists, yet no shut dissemination focus. Notwithstanding, around 0900 UTC on August 26, satellite symbolism and QuikSCAT information showed that a shut low had shaped. While arranged about east of Nassau, Bahamas, the element was pronounced a tropical stormÃ¢ÂÂskipping the tropical sorrow organize. 

Because of the collaboration of the underlying wave and the upper-level trough, Danny kept up a "non-established" structure taking after that of a subtropical violent wind. Indeed, even after its assignment as a hurricane, the tempest was very muddled. Practically zero profound tempest movement encompassed the middle, and the most noteworthy breezes were restricted to a rainband in the northern half circle of the tornado. The tempest moved whimsically northwestward for the duration of the day on August 26, reinforcing just somewhat. Danny's middle changed a few times, making it hard to decide its course of development.

Danny topped with most extreme supported breezes of 60Ã¢Â mph (95Ã¢Â km/h) and a base weight of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). It held this quality for around 12 hours before revived shear made the tempest progressively debilitate as it wandered northward. By August 28, Danny further weakened, and observation air ship found that it was scarcely a typhoon. In the wake of slowing down amid the evening, the middle continued a north or north-northwestward float. 

A solid upper-level trough traveling through the southeastern United States constrained Danny northeastward. It likewise set off the arrangement of another low weight framework close to the shoreline of North Carolina at an opportune time August 29. In spite of the fact that this low shaped inside Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite symbolism demonstrated that it didn't have the attributes of a tropical violent wind. In this way, it isn't viewed as a continuation of Danny. The new low made the hurricane deteriorate into a trough about 275Ã¢Â mi (445Ã¢Â km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's leftovers were assimilated into a creating frontal zone presently. 

Ahead of time of the typhoon, a hurricane watch was posted for North Carolina from Cape Lookout to the town of Duck at 2100 UTC on August 27. It was stopped on August 29. 

As the tempest stayed seaward, its belongings were constrained.

On September 1, the Currituck County Sheriff's Office revealed that the kid's body was found on the shoreline about north of where he disappeared. More distant south, swells achieved Florida's Atlantic coast. High surf and tear flows additionally influenced the Mid-Atlantic states, provoking authorities to issue washing confinements.
