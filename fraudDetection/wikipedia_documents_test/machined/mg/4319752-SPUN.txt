Dirleton Castle 

Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortification in the town of Dirleton, East Lothian, Scotland. It lies around west of North Berwick, and around east of Edinburgh. The most seasoned pieces of the chÃ¢teau date to the thirteenth century, and it was deserted before the finish of the seventeenth century. 

Started in around 1240 by John De Vaux, the mansion was vigorously harmed amid the Wars of Scottish Independence, when it was twice taken by the English. In the fourteenth century, Dirleton was fixed by the Haliburton family, and it was obtained by the Ruthvens in 1505. The Ruthvens were associated with a few plots against Mary, Queen of Scots, and King James VI, and inevitably relinquished the mansion in 1600. Dirleton stopped to be a habitation, in spite of the fact that Oliver Cromwell was compelled to assault the stronghold to flush out a band of "mosstroopers" (raiders), amid the Third English Civil War in 1650. The harmed chÃ¢teau was then obtained by John Nisbet, Lord Dirleton, who chose to manufacture another nation house on the adjacent Archerfield Estate. The Nisbet group of Dirleton kept on keeping up the stronghold's greenhouses, before giving Dirleton into state care in 1923. The vestiges and greenery enclosures are presently kept up by Historic Scotland. 

Dirleton Castle remains on a rough outcrop, at the core of the rich agrarian terrains of the barony of Dirleton, and watchmen the beach front way to deal with Edinburgh from England, through the port of North Berwick. The remains involve a thirteenth century keep, and a sixteenth century house which the Ruthvens fabricated nearby. Just the cellar levels make due of the fourteenth and fifteenth century augmentations worked by the Haliburtons, despite the fact that these included a substantial lobby and tower house along the east range. Different structures inside the patio have additionally been crushed. Encompassing the manor are gardens, which may have been first spread out in the sixteenth century, in spite of the fact that the present planting is to a great extent of the twentieth century. The greenhouse dividers encase a sixteenth century doocot, or pigeon house. 

The Norman group of de Vaux began in Rouen, northern France, and settled in England following the Norman Conquest of 1066. Two de Vaux siblings, or cousins, were among various Anglo-Norman knights welcome to Scotland, and conceded land, by King David I of Scotland in the twelfth century. Hubert de Vaux was given the barony of Gilsland in Cumbria, around then piece of Scotland, while John de Vaux was allowed the barony of Dirleton. John constructed a stronghold at Eldbotle, most likely toward the north-west of current Dirleton, and another, named Tarbet Castle, on the island of Fidra, albeit neither endures. 

In 1220, Fidra was skilled to the priests of Dryburgh Abbey by William de Vaux. William's child, another John, had been held prisoner in England as surety for the great direct of King William the Lion in 1213, and prevailing to the barony during the 1220s. He at that point started the development of a swap for Tarbet at Dirleton, which was recorded as a "castellum" in 1225, in spite of the fact that this may allude to a prior timber structure. In 1239, de Vaux was selected seneschal, or steward, to Marie de Coucy, on her marriage to King Alexander II. Marie de Coucy was the girl of Enguerrand III, Lord of Coucy (d.1242), manufacturer of the ChÄËteau de Coucy, in Picardy (c.1220s), which presumably filled in as a model for Dirleton. The thirteenth century stone mansion, of which just the donjon, or keep, stays, spoke to a show of de Vaux's status, and would have required quiet occasions to allow a delayed development venture. 

Quiet occasions finished in 1296, with the flare-up of the Wars of Scottish Independence. Dirleton, which protected the course among Edinburgh and the English fringe, changed hands a few times through the intrusions of the English under King Edward I. Amid the crusade of summer 1298, the manor was assaulted by English powers under Antony Bek, the Bishop of Durham. Dirleton withstood the attack for a while, until the English triumph at Falkirk enabled them to raise vast attack motors, after which the stronghold was before long decreased. Dirleton was garrisoned by the English, yet more likely than not been retaken by the Scots before 1306, when the English leader Aymer de Valence, second Earl of Pembroke recovered Dirleton yet again. It was at last retaken by the Scots some time before 1314, and was insulted, or intentionally harmed, to counteract its reuse by the English. 

The manor and grounds of Dirleton go to the Berwickshire group of Haliburton (or Halyburton) when John Haliburton (d.1355) wedded the beneficiary of the de Vaux family, in a matter of seconds before 1350. The manor had been fixed by 1363, when it was seized by William Douglas, first Earl of Douglas, amid his concise defiance to King David II, in spite of the fact that it was later come back to the Haliburtons. During the 1420s, Sir Walter Haliburton (d. prior to 1447) went about as a prisoner in return for the arrival of King James I, who had been held hostage by the English since 1406. He was compensated in 1439 by being selected Treasurer of Scotland. Either Walter, or his oldest child John (d. prior to 1454), was praised as a Lord of Parliament during the 1440s, with the title Lord Dirletoun. The Haliburtons did broad works at Dirleton, uplifting the first towers, and building another gatehouse toward the south-east. An extensive corridor and tower house were added to the manor in the fifteenth century, shaping the east range. Ruler James IV visited Dirleton in 1505, and offered cash to the artisans at that point connected on works in the north-east piece of the chÃ¢teau. Soon thereafter, Patrick, the last Haliburton of Dirleton, kicked the bucket, and his homes were partitioned among his three girls, Janet, Margaret, and Mariotta. 

The oldest little girl, Janet, wedded William Ruthven, second Lord Ruthven (d. 1552) in 1515, and the chÃ¢teau and lordship of Dirleton go to the Ruthven family. The child of William and Janet, Patrick, third Lord Ruthven (c. 1520Ã¢ÂÂ1566), was one of the pioneers of the gathering who killed David Riccio, private secretary to Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick was compelled to escape to England, where he passed on, leaving Dirleton to his child William (c. 1541Ã¢ÂÂ1584), who was made Earl of Gowrie in 1581. Ruler Gowrie drove a plot, later known as the Raid of Ruthven, in which the 16-year-old King James VI was seized, in August 1582. Ruthven then controlled in the lord's name, while James was held hostage. In spite of the fact that Gowrie was acquitted the next year, he was executed in 1584 as far as concerns him in another plot to seize Stirling Castle, and his properties were relinquished to the crown. A sharp novice arboriculturalist, Lord Gowrie is thought to have spread out the patio nurseries at Dirleton, and planted various trees. 

James VI conceded Dirleton to the Earl of Arran, who engaged the King there in 1585. The next year, the palace was reestablished to Lady Dorothea, widow of the principal Earl, and by 1600 had gone to John Ruthven, third Earl of Gowrie (c. 1577Ã¢ÂÂ1600), their second child. 

Dirleton assumed a job in the tale of the Ã¢ÂÂGowrie ConspiracyÃ¢ÂÂ of 1600 in that there has for quite some time been doubt that the chÃ¢teau was taken from the Ruthvens and given to Thomas Erskine as a reward for helping James VI in the homicide of Patrick RuthvenÃ¢ÂÂs children: John, third Earl of Gowrie, and his sibling Alexander. The official story of the Gowrie Conspiracy, gave a while later by the lord, was that he and fifteen retainers, Erskine among them, had landed at Gowrie House one night in August 1600 in light of the fact that he had been welcomed there by Alexander. In any case, as the account goes, the two siblings endeavored to kill James, and in the scuffle that pursued, the two Ruthvens were murdered. While this was going on at Gowrie House, the other two Ruthven siblings, William and Patrick, were at Dirleton, obviously uninformed of the plot in the air. Discovering a lot to question in the kingÃ¢ÂÂs account, many have contended that James went to Gowrie House with his entourage for the express reason for killing John and Alexander, halfway in light of the fact that the lord owed the Earl of Gowrie an extensive whole of cash and incompletely in light of the fact that there had for quite some time been gossip that Gowrie was the grandson of James IV, which, assuming genuine, would have placed him in line for the honored position in front of James VI. After the killings, the lord separated the Gowrie bequests and gave them on the men who had been with him that night. Erskine got the endowment of Dirleton Castle, which some see to be a type of Ã¢ÂÂblood money.Ã¢ÂÂ This discernment is additionally substantiated by the way that Erskine was made Baron Erskine of Dirletowne in 1604. 

Erskine sold the mansion to Sir James Douglas in 1625. Douglas sold it on to Alexander Morieson of Prestongrange, who sold it thusly, in 1631, to James Maxwell of Innerwick (d. c. 1650), who was made Earl of Dirletoun in 1646. 

Oliver Cromwell's military attacked Scotland in 1650, amid the Third English Civil War, and vanquished the Scots Royalists at Dunbar on 3 September. With this triumph, Cromwell oversaw southern Scotland, yet groups of Royalist greenery troopers kept on harrying the English supply lines. One such band was based at Dirleton, and Cromwell requested General Monck and General Lambert, with 1,600 troops, to catch the manor. This was accomplished on 10 November, utilizing mortars to annihilate the drawbridge and inward door. The skipper of the greenery troopers was swung from the dividers with two of his friends. The palace was insulted afresh, and albeit quickly utilized as a field emergency clinic, it was then left to rot. The fighter and designer in charge of Cromwell's powerful utilization of big guns was a German, Major Joachim Hane. He additionally planned fortifications close Inverness and in Ayr, and coordinated the mortar fire at the attack of Stirling Castle in August 1651. He later went through a year spying for Cromwell's Secretary of State, John Thurloe. 

Dirleton Castle and domain were bought, from the bereft Countess of Dirletoun, by the attorney John Nisbet (c. 1609Ã¢ÂÂ1687) in 1663. Nisbet, who took the title Lord Dirleton when he was delegated as a judge, constructed another house at Archerfield, toward the north-west of the town. The Nisbets kept on keeping up the greenery enclosures around the mansion as a feature of the recreation center around Archerfield, and introduced the bowling green. The nineteenth century garden dividers were included by Mary Nisbet, Lady Elgin (1778Ã¢ÂÂ1855), spouse of the Earl of Elgin, as a major aspect of a "beautification" of Dirleton town. In the mid-nineteenth century, two new parterres were spread out by the head planter, David Thompson. Albeit neither endure, the west greenery enclosure was reestablished, in view of nineteenth century plans, in 1993. The north patio nursery was supplanted during the 1920s with an Arts and Crafts-style greenery enclosure of herbaceous fringes. Additionally during the 1920s, the palace was passed into state care, and is presently kept up by Historic Scotland, an organization of the Scottish Government. 

The mansion and grounds are secured as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, while the patio nurseries show up on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national register of noteworthy greenhouses. The palace, doocot, and limit dividers are Category A recorded structures, the most abnormal amount of insurance for a notable structure in Scotland. 

The stronghold is based on a characteristic rough outcrop, on a low edge neglecting the farmland of East Lothian. It contains a kite-formed patio, by , flanked by structures on the south and east sides. The most generous remains are the Ruthven Lodging, the gatehouse, and the de Vaux keep toward the south, while just the storm cellar of the east range endures. Parts of the north and west window ornament dividers diagram the patio, which was some time ago separated in two by further sixteenth century structures. The chÃ¢teau was initially drawn nearer from the south, by means of a scaffold and drawbridge, over a wide discard. In the sixteenth century, steps were worked to get to the Ruthven lodging from the west. 

The keep, or donjon, endures generally flawless from the thirteenth century, and structures the south-west piece of the present manor. Depicted by compositional antiquarian W. D. Simpson as a "bunch keep", it contains a huge round pinnacle toward the south, a littler round pinnacle toward the west, with the two joined by a square pinnacle. The brick work is of squared ashlar, or dressed stone squares. Inside, the first utilization of the rooms is hard to translate, in spite of the fact that the round towers may have filled in as private suites for Lord Dirleton and his Lady. The expansive pinnacle contains a six-sided load at ground level, potentially a kitchen, with a seven-sided principle load above. This room has a pointed vaulted roof, seats by the window in the vast windows around the south divider, and a cut chimney at the north. Toward the east is a postern, or side entryway, and past is a well. Nearby the well is a story bring forth, which would have enabled nourishment to be exchanged straightforwardly from the kitchen to a servery above. A room in the square pinnacle toward the west, potentially the master's room, has gaps in the roof to enable smoke from braziers to get away. The more destroyed west round pinnacle presumably contained another corridor, with loads above and capacity underneath. In the seventeenth century, the highest point of the principle round pinnacle was brought and renovated down to frame a firearm stage. 

Just parts of the remainder of the thirteenth century chÃ¢teau remain. A fourth pinnacle, where the Ruthven holding up now stands, may have finished the "group keep". Bases of round towers at the south-east and north-east corners of the palace are noticeable beneath the later dividers. Portions of the north-west divider are thirteenth century work, just like the blocked postern in the cellar of the east range. The general arrangement of the manor, be that as it may, was not extraordinarily changed through later reconstructing work. Dirleton is the most punctual dated model in Scotland of a chÃ¢teau with round towers that venture past the shade divider, rather than those at Dunstaffnage, for instance, where the towers are contained inside the dividers. This new structure was thusly utilized in other thirteenth century Scottish manors, including Bothwell and Kildrummy. 

The gatehouse, kitchens, and east range were worked by the Haliburtons in the fourteenth and fifteenth hundreds of years. The gatehouse, worked in the fourteenth century toward the east of the keep, is like the one at close-by Tantallon Castle. It is fronted by a high, pointed curve, some time ago with bartizans, little round turrets, at the top. The entryway was ensured by a drawbridge over the external jettison, a portcullis, and three arrangements of entryways. Watchman rooms open off the passageway section, and a round opening in the rooftop, known as a "murder gap", enabled safeguards to drop questions on to any aggressor who ruptured the external door. 

The expansive kitchens possess the south-east edge of the mansion. The high primary kitchen has two wide chimneys for cooking, and a roundabout vent in the vaulted roof. Brings forth in the floor offer access to a well ( profound) and basements underneath. The neighboring section connected the kitchen to the corridor in the east range. 

The east range itself runs the length of the east side of the stronghold, and initially contained a huge corridor, with a square pinnacle house at the north-east corner. Albeit just the storm cellar endures, this once framed one of the best honorable habitations of its time in Scotland, and would have been like the contemporary structures at Doune Castle. The storm cellar is a solitary passage vault, with low dividers subdividing the territory into stores. Two expansive stoves and a well lie at the south end, while at the east is the thirteenth century postern, blocked when the divider was thickened to help the new structures above, and re-utilized as a chimney. At the north end of the cellar is a vaulted jail for freemen, and underneath this, a stone cut pit, square, to house detainees of the worker classes. Over the jail, yet at the same time inside the storm cellar, is a vaulted house of prayer with different formal breaks, for example, a sacristy and a piscina, or water bowl. A private chamber for the minister is nearby. The lobby above is by , and once had a high timber rooftop, and a minstrel's display at the south end. A luxuriously cut stone smorgasbord, or pantry, is situated on this divider, which framed piece of the servery by the kitchen. At the north-east corner of the palace, a pinnacle house gave convenience to the Lord's family and visitors. Once more, just the most minimal floor stays, over the house of prayer. This most likely framed a private chamber for the Lord, and was associated with the neighboring lobby. 

Built by the Ruthvens after they procured the palace around 1515, the Ruthven Lodging speaks to the last phase of structure at Dirleton. In the later piece of the sixteenth century, it filled in as the principle home of Lady Dorothea, spouse of the primary Earl of Gowrie, and their 15 kids. The three-story building is built, similar to the Haliburton run, from stripped stone, despite the fact that the Ruthven Lodging is enriched with string courses, flat moldings going around the dividers. The huge windows were ensured by iron grilles and little weapon gaps. The rectangular Lodging is quickly toward the north of the de Vaux building, isolated by a limited sporadic patio, which is gotten to by means of a section in the ground floor of the Lodging. The rest of the ground floor was involved by basements, with family rooms and rooms on the upper floors. The principal floor lounge area was cleared with designed floor tiles, and may once have had a painted timber roof. 

The manor is set inside broad greenhouses, limited by a nineteenth century divider. The patio nurseries were first spread out in the sixteenth century, yet have experienced numerous changes. A bowling green deceives the west of the stronghold, bordered by yew trees, which may once have shaped a support around a parterre here. West of the bowling green is a bloom garden, spread out in 1993 to an eighteenth century plan, and containing yew, cedar, monkey baffle and Lawson's cypress trees. Toward the north is the 1920s Arts and Crafts garden, which is home to a - long herbaceous fringe, and is disregarded by a castellated nineteenth century gazebo, or summer house. The outskirt is perceived by the Guinness Book of Records similar to the longest on the planet. The remainder of the greenery enclosures involve gardens, with various develop example trees, including redwood, beech, and sycamore. 

There is a well-safeguarded sixteenth century bee sanctuary molded doocot, or pigeon house, in the manor grounds. The doocot is high, and contains around 1000 settling boxes for pigeons, which were a critical wellspring of sustenance for the manor's occupants. Toward the north-east, presently situated outside the manor gardens, is a sixteenth century portal which previously served the palace, however at this point serves the contiguous ranch.
