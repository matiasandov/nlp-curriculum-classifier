Osbert fitzHervey (kicked the bucket 1206) was an Anglo-Norman imperial judge. Sibling of Hubert Walter and Theobald Walter, Osbert served three lords of England and may have added to the lawful treatise credited to his uncle, Ranulf de Glanvill. Ralph of Coggeshall, a medieval author, applauded Osbert's learning of law, yet denounced his acknowledgment of blessings from offended parties and respondents in lawful cases. Osbert was one of a gathering of men who are viewed as the main indications of an expert legal executive in England. 

Osbert was from East Anglia, where he held grounds. He was a more youthful sibling of Hubert Walter, later Archbishop of Canterbury, and in this way the child of Hervey Walter and his significant other Maud de Valoignes, one of the girls (and co-beneficiaries) of Theobald de Valoignes, master of Parham in Suffolk.

He was frequently sent as a nomad equity to East Anglia; the student of history Barbara Dodwell said of him that "of the considerable number of judges his insight into East Anglian question was presumably the best". It gives the idea that Osbert's illustrious administration was limited to legal issues, as no other proof of some other workplaces has surfaced. 

The treatise "Tractatus of Glanvill", which is generally credited to Osbert's uncle Ranulf de Glanvill, and to which Osbert himself may have contributed, names just seven judges, including Osbert. He was one of a gathering of imperial judges that included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard Barre, William de Warenne, and Richard Herriard, utilized by Hubert Walter, the Justiciar of England amid Richard's rule, and picked for their capacity instead of any familial ties. This gathering supplanted the past arrangement of utilizing for the most part nearby men, and speak to the main indications of an expert legal executive. In 1194 Osbert was one of the gatherers of the carucage in eastern England, alongside Barre and de Warrene. 

In 1198 Osbert wedded Margaret of Rye, with whom he had somewhere around one child. Osbert paid the ruler 20 pounds for the privilege to wed Margaret. Osbert passed on in 1206, without having made a will. At his demise, his yearly salary was in excess of 240 pounds. Ralph of Coggeshall makes reference to Osbert, without utilizing his name, as an imperial judge who might get lost in his "Vision of Thurkill". This work definite the disciplines that anticipated delinquents, and Osbert was blamed for tolerating endowments from the two sides of claims. Coggeshall stated that Osbert was "most master in common law" and was acclaimed for "his flooding persuasiveness and involvement in the law". As indicated by Coggeshall, Osbert's discipline in Hell would comprise of gulping hot coins and afterward being compelled to upchuck the coins back. After his passing, William of Huntingfield offered King John a fine for the privilege to the authority of Osbert's beneficiary and terrains, the fine adding up to 200 imprints and two palfreys.
