Made by a staff of twenty, it was the primary film to be created by the Thanhouser Company. The film was discharged in August 9, 1910, after the achievement of the organization was guaranteed, and met with positive gathering by commentators. The film is assumed lost. 

Despite the fact that the film is assumed lost, an abstract makes due in "The Moving Picture World" from August 13, 1910. It expresses: "The story focuses on Harry Willard, a trudging rancher. A city refined man guarantees Harry's unimportant spouse a real existence of straightforwardness and extravagance - and it is the old, old story. She takes her little girl, Agnes, with her, and leaves a note reporting the reality for Harry. The youthful rancher, who adores his significant other and tyke with an all-expending love, loses his reason as he peruses the declaration of his treachery. In spite of the fact that without the exposed methods for his subsistence, he looks for a considerable length of time for his friends and family. In the long run the strain, mental and physical, tells on him - he leaves it every one of the a crazy person. His fury appears as an antipathy for all humanity. He needs to overlook the world that has treated him so sick - he chooses to turn into a loner and betakes himself to a ruined cavern, where he goes through the years repulsing humankind. 25 years passes by. Once in a while in that time does he adventure on beaten ways for dread that he may meet a detested human, however one day he overlooks his determination sufficiently long to cross a carriage drive. He hears the clack of hooves and sights a pony tearing toward him with an influencing carriage and shouting tenants - runaway! As the carriage goes by him, a lady throws a group to him; he gets it and discovers it a pink and white piece of mankind. Disoriented he keeps running into the wild with an infant and makes for his cavern. Touched base at the cavern the neurotic makes plans to even his score with society by taking the angel's life. Yet, his eyes light on the child's memento and his hand is remained. For the memento bears an image of the offspring of the spouse who sold out him!" 

"The guardians of the infant have phenomenally gotten away demise in the accident of their carriage and follow the bizarre animal who safeguarded the tyke to his refuge. They touch base as he contemplates upon the image in the memento and endeavors to review its first. The darling is the little girl of the first and its mom the loner's girl, Agnes - the one-time tot whom the forsaking spouse took with her. A spouse and mother, she is a significant full grown lady now - yet her highlights are unaltered. The face seems commonplace to the recluse and he endeavors to put it. In the long run he succeeds. The stun of acknowledgment stupors him - and transforms him. The light of mental stability comes back to his eyes. His reason is reestablished. He takes to his bosom the little girl whom he had lost and found once more. She takes him from his backwoods home and back to the human advancement that had deceived him. Be that as it may, the benevolently care and love his little girl gives on him to act in a measure as a reward for the wrong destroyed him the quite a while in the past, and with the passing years the harshness goes from his being. The image contacts the heartstrings; it will please to an assurance." 

"The Mad Hermit" was the primary film to be delivered by the Thanhouser Company, however the main discharge was "The Actor's Children". The author of the situation is obscure. The film was shot in the harvest time of 1909. Edwin Thanhouser would later depict the creation as, "...a rather grievous issue. It included everything from homicide through theft and a romantic tale. It flaunted enough material for 15 plots." According to Q. David Bowers, Edwin Thanhouser felt that the generation had numerous crude viewpoints and held off on discharging the film until the notoriety of the organization was verified. The movie was coordinated by Barry O'Neil, the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy. O'Neil would coordinate numerous critical Thanhouser pictures, including its initial two-reeler, "Romeo and Juliet". There are no known credits for the cast, yet Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane are two conceivable on-screen characters that were conspicuous players in 1910. Included with the organization since its beginnings, Anna Rosemond was one of two driving women of the Thanhouser organization in this time. Straight to the point H. Crane was a main male on-screen character of the organization and furthermore included since the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company. Arbors expresses that a large portion of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser preparations. A later explanation by Edwin Thanhouser would express that 20 people, including the chief and cameraman, were associated with the creation. An enduring film still leaves open the likelihood of distinguishing two characters. 

The single reel dramatization, around 1,000 feet long, was discharged on August 9, 1910. The film had a wide national discharge, with ads incorporating those in Kansas, California, Arizona, Nebraska, Washington, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Texas. A commercial for the Province Theater recommends that the film touched base in British Columbia, Canada inside days of its discharge. 

The film got acclaim from pundits with "The Moving Picture World" expressing, "[It is a] picture which contacts the heart and stirs the most grounded feelings. It very well may be promptly seen how a man may turn into a crazy person under such conditions. The departure of a spouse and girl is adequate to topple reason. That a man ought to be a recluse thereafter appears not irregular. At that point comes the fervor of the runaway, the salvage of the infant and the disclosure of his little girl, with returning reason and love to pursue amid his declining years. The feelings will be firmly stirred by this image, and that will make it mainstream. Whatever contacts the heart is constantly mainstream, and this appears to bid with strange power." "The New York Dramatic Mirror" offered minor recognition for the film for the creation and its acting.
