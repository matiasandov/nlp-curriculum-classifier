Mycena overholtsii 

Mycena overholtsii, regularly known as the snowbank pixie cap or fluffy foot, is a types of parasite in the family Mycenaceae. The mushrooms created by the parasite are moderately huge for the family "Mycena", with raised grayish tops up to in distance across and stems up to long. The gills on the underside of the top are whitish to pale dim, and at first firmly separated before ending up well-dispersed at development after the top extends. The mushrooms are portrayed by the thick covering of white "hairs" on the base of the stem. "M.Ã¢Â overholtsii" is a case of a snowbank parasite, developing on well-rotted conifer logs close snowbanks, amid or soon after snowmelt. Once in the past known just from high-height territories of western North America, especially the Rocky Mountain and Cascade areas, it was accounted for without precedent for Japan in 2010. The edibility of the mushroom is obscure. "M.Ã¢Â overholtsii" can be recognized from other similar species by contrasts in area, or spore estimate. 

The species was first portrayed by mycologists Alexander H. Smith and Wilhelm Solheim in 1953, based on examples gathered in the Medicine Bow Mountains of Albany County, Wyoming. The particular sobriquet praises the mid twentieth century American mycologist Lee Oras Overholts. It is generally known as the "snowbank pixie protective cap", or "fluffy foot", in spite of the fact that it imparts the last name to "Tapinella atrotomentosa" and "Xeromphalina campanella". "M.Ã¢Â overholtsii" has been given the Japanese name "yukitsutsumikunugitake". 

"Mycena overholtsii" creates probably the biggest mushrooms of the class "Mycena". They have tops that are in breadth, and arched fit as a fiddle, building up an umbo (a focal distension taking after an areola) in development. The top surface is smooth, soggy, and set apart with outspread striations. The tops are fairly hygrophanous, and relying upon age and condition of hydration, go in shading from darker or grayish-dark colored, to dim or pale blue dim. The mushroom tissue is slim and watery, with a light dark shading. 

The gills have an adnate, adnexed, or shallowly decurrent connection to the stem, and are at first firmly separated before ending up well-dispersed at development. They have a whitish to pale dim shading, and will recolor dark when they are wounded. There are three or four levels of lamellulae (short gills that don't broaden completely from the top edge to the stem) blended between the gills. The stem is long by thick, and decreases upward with the goal that the stem zenith is somewhat more slender than the base. It very well may be straight or bended, has ligament like tissue, and is empty in development. When developing on delicate, well-rotted wood, the stem frequently infiltrates profoundly into the substrate. The stem is pinkish-dark colored in shading, and the lower half is tomentose Ã¢ÂÂ thickly secured with white, wooly hairs. The mushroom has a yeast-like scent and a gentle taste; its edibility is obscure, however it isn't viewed as noxious. 

Seen in store, likewise with a spore print, the spores seem white. Infinitesimally, the spores are generally circular, some of the time showing up bean-molded, with measurements of 5.5Ã¢ÂÂ7.0 by 3.0Ã¢ÂÂ3.5Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. They are meager walled and smooth, and bear an undefined hilar member. The spores are amyloid, which means they will retain iodine and swing dark to blue-dark when recolored with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge), which are dispersed and mixed with basidia, are generally cylindric to fusoid (shaft molded), smooth, hyaline (translucent), and measure 45Ã¢ÂÂ65 by 2Ã¢ÂÂ5.5Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are unprecedented, and comparable in appearance to the cheilocystidia. The top fingernail skin is an ixocutis (a parasitic tissue type in which the hyphae are coagulated and lie level) with for the most part smooth hyphae that are 1.5Ã¢ÂÂ3.5Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m in distance across. The top substance is dextrinoid, which means it will turn ruddy dark colored in Melzer's reagent. Clip associations are available in the hyphae of "M.Ã¢Â overholtsii". 

Other comparative mycenas that develop in groups on wood incorporate "M.Ã¢Â maculata" and "M.Ã¢Â galericulata". The organic product groups of "M.Ã¢Â maculata" frequently create red stains as they develop, yet this trademark is conflicting and can't be dependably utilized for distinguishing proof. Its spores are bigger than that of "M.Ã¢Â overholtsii", estimating 7Ã¢ÂÂ10 by 4Ã¢ÂÂ6Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. "M.Ã¢Â galericulata" is fundamentally the same as in appearance to "M.Ã¢Â maculata", yet does not experience rosy recoloring; its spores are 8Ã¢ÂÂ12 by 5.5Ã¢ÂÂ9Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. Another comparative species is "M.Ã¢Â semivestipes", which can be recognized by its detergent like scent, an eastern North American dispersion, fruiting season amid summer and harvest time, and little spores estimating 4Ã¢ÂÂ5 by 2.5Ã¢ÂÂ3Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. 

This species is now and then found independently, however more regularly in bunches on well-spoiled conifer logs and stumps (frequently Douglas-fir) close dissolving snowbanks, or some of the time in soggy snow chambers framed by retreating snow. Cool evening temperatures decrease the snowmelt rate, and help guarantee that spores discharged by the mushroom will be scattered into the dirt. The mushroom is regular in western North America, especially the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountains and the Cascade mountains. It has been accounted for in four US states: South Dakota, California, Washington and Wyoming, yet isn't known in Oregon. It is likewise found in western Canada. The mushroom is limited to regions with least rises of . In 2010, it was accounted for developing in the boreal coniferous timberlands of Hokkaido, Japan, in estates of Sakhalin fir ("Abies sachalinensis"), just as in normal woodlands overwhelmed by both Sakhalin fir and Jezo spruce ("Picea jezoensis"). In North America, the mushroom generally shows up among March and July; Japanese accumulations were made in May. The fruiting time frame can be drawn out, particularly in regions with substantial snowfall, or at high rises where the snowmelt is deferred.
