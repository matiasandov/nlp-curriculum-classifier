Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos 

Nikephoros Phokas (, Ã¢ÂÂ15 August 1022), surnamed Barytrachelos (ÃÂÃ®ÄÄÂÄÂÄÂÄÂÃ®ÅºÄÂÃ®ËÃ®Å¥Ã®Å¼ÄÂ, "substantial neck"; Armenian: "CÃ¡Å¡Â[a]viz", "Ts'arvezi", "wry-neck"), was a Byzantine privileged person and head honcho, the last significant individual from the Phokas family to endeavor to guarantee the majestic position of royalty. He was a child of the general Bardas Phokas the Younger and incredible nephew of Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas, and assumed a functioning job in his dad's fizzled resistance to Basil II in 987Ã¢ÂÂ989. After the passing of his dad, he looked for and got Basil's exculpation. Nothing further is known about him until 1022 when, alongside the general Nikephoros Xiphias, he propelled another insubordination. The revolt assembled across the board support, yet doubt between the two chiefs prompted Phokas' death by Xiphias on 15 August 1022. The disobedience crumbled rapidly after that. 

Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos was a child of the general Bardas Phokas the Younger, and had one more seasoned sibling, Leo. In spring 970, after the homicide of Barytrachelos' incredible uncle Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas by John I Tzimiskes, his dad attempted to raise an insubordination to the new routine in the family's base at Cappadocia. Tzimiskes dispatched his lieutenant Bardas Skleros against Bardas Phokas. Skleros had the capacity to draw away a large number of Phokas' supporters, until he was compelled to surrender. In spite of the fact that not unequivocally referenced in the sources, Nikephoros most likely shared his dad's fortune, being ousted to the Aegean island of Chios with the remainder of his family. 

In 978, after Tzimiskes' demise and the ascent of Basil II to the royal position, Bardas Phokas was reviewed to lead the magnificent powers against his old adversary Bardas Skleros, who had revolted and caught quite a bit of Asia Minor. After early inverts, the supporter powers under Phokas demonstrated successful in spring 979, constraining Skleros to escape to Byzantium's eastern Muslim neighbors, discovering asylum in the Buyid court at Baghdad. 

In 987, be that as it may, Bardas Skleros was discharged from Baghdad and endeavored to raise another revolt. He reached Bardas Phokas for a typical endeavor against Basil II, yet Phokas hoodwinked and detained Skleros, before at long last propelling his very own uprising by announcing himself ruler in August/September 987. It is here that Nikephoros is named without precedent for the sources: his dad sent him to David III of Tao to verify military guide, and to stand up to the follower general Gregory Taronites, who had arrived in the Phokades' back at Trebizond and had raised a multitude of Armenians in the eastern territories. Nikephoros verified 1,000 Georgian officers from David and vanquished Taronites, however not long after that news contacted him of the passing of his dad at the Battle of Abydos on 13 April 989. Bardas Phokas' death prompted the quick breakdown of the disobedience: the Georgians came back to their nation, and Nikephoros' troops scattered to their homes. Nikephoros fled to the stronghold of Tyropoion, where his mom dwelled and where the detained Bardas Skleros was held. Alongside his sibling Leo, Nikephoros now bolstered Skleros' office as sovereign, however the last mentioned, old and exhausted, liked to surrender the battle and submit to the head in return for tolerance. Like Bardas Skleros, Nikephoros got an exoneration, and was permitted to hold his benefits. Leo then again attempted to oppose from his base at Antioch, however the city's occupants surrendered him to Basil. 

Nothing is known about Nikephoros Phokas Barytrachelos until the mid year of 1022, when he plotted with the general Nikephoros Xiphias against Basil II, who since spring had been occupied with a battle against the Georgian ruler George I. The two plotters planned to oust Basil and have one of them supplant him, yet the issue of who might have priority was uncertain, and would prompt the disobedience's speedy defeat. In spite of the fact that Xiphias held the lofty post of "strategos" of the Anatolic Theme and Phokas held no office however the title of "patrikios", as indicated by the report of the contemporary Christian Arab history specialist Yahya of Antioch, incredible quantities of privileged people ran to him because of his family's impact, inciting Xiphias' jealousy. 

The resistance of the two men was especially threatening to the ruler, as it assumed responsibility for Cappadocia and took steps to remove his back and abandon him stranded between two foes. To be sure, the plotters are said to have been in contact with George I for that reason. Basil initially pulled back to the security of the post of Mazdat, and as per John Skylitzes sent an agent to the revolutionary heads intending to sow doubt between them, while as indicated by Yahya the sovereign selected as the new legislative head of the Anatolic Theme Theophylact Dalassenos and sent him to smother the revolt. Regardless of whether the agent achieved his undertaking is obscure, however on 15 August 1022, Xiphias orchestrated a gathering with Phokas, where the last was killed by one of Xiphias' workers. Armenian sources anyway report, rather disastrously, that Phokas was slaughtered by the previous lord of Vaspurakan, Senekerim-Hovhannes, or his child David, or one of their adherents. The disjoined head was sent to Basil, who mounted it on a stake and put it on open showcase at Mazdat. 

Following the passing of Phokas, the insubordination crumbled, and Xiphias was captured and compelled to turn into a priest. Discharged from the danger to his back, Basil II quickly and definitively crushed George I, and forced his terms on him. Different supporters of the uprising were detained and discharged in 1025, after the demise of Basil II and the progression of his more youthful sibling, Constantine VIII. In 1026, be that as it may, Constantine VIII blamed the last enduring part for the once extraordinary family, Bardas Phokas (potentially a child or nephew of Nikephoros Barytrachelos), of plotting against the royal position, and had him blinded.
