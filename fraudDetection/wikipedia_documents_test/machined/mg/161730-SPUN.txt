Stephen V of Hungary 

Stephen V (, , ; before 18 October 1239Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ 6 August 1272, Csepel Island) was King of Hungary and Croatia somewhere in the range of 1270 and 1272, and Duke of Styria from 1258 to 1260. He was the most seasoned child of King BÄÅ¡la IV and Maria Laskarina. Ruler BÄÅ¡la had his child delegated lord at six years old and named him Duke of Slavonia. Still a kid, Stephen wedded Elizabeth, a girl of a chieftain of the Cumans whom his dad settled in the Great Hungarian Plain. 

Ruler BÄÅ¡la delegated Stephen Duke of Transylvania in 1257 and Duke of Styria in 1258. The neighborhood aristocrats in Styria, which had been attached four years prior, contradicted his standard. Helped by King Ottokar II of Bohemia, they revolted and removed Stephen's troops from most pieces of Styria. After Ottokar II steered the unified armed force of Stephen and his dad in the Battle of Kressenbrunn on 12 July 1260, Stephen left Styria and came back to Transylvania. 

Stephen constrained his dad to surrender every one of the grounds of the Kingdom of Hungary toward the east of the Danube to him and embraced the title of junior ruler in 1262. In two years, a common war broke out among dad and child, since Stephen blamed BÄÅ¡la for intending to exclude him. They finished up a harmony bargain in 1266, yet certainty was never reestablished between them. Stephen succeeded his dad, who passed on 3 May 1270, without challenges, however his sister Anna and his dad's nearest guides fled to the Kingdom of Bohemia. Ottokar II attacked Hungary in the spring of 1271, however Stephen steered him. In the following summer, a defiant master caught and detained Stephen's child, Ladislaus. Presently, Stephen surprisingly became sick and kicked the bucket. 

Stephen was the eighth youngster and first child of King BÄÅ¡la IV of Hungary and his better half, Maria, a little girl of Theodore I Lascaris, Emperor of Nicaea. He was conceived in 1239. Ecclesiastical overseer Robert of Esztergom sanctified through water him on 18 October. The youngster, beneficiary clear from birth, was named after Saint Stephen, the main King of Hungary. 

BÄÅ¡la and his family, including Stephen, fled to Zagreb after the Mongols had destroyed the imperial armed force in the Battle of Mohi on 11 April 1241. The Mongols crossed the solidified Danube in February 1242 and the illustrious family kept running off the extent that the well-invigorated Dalmatian town of Trogir. The King and his family came back from Dalmatia after the Mongols surprisingly pulled back from Hungary in March. 

An imperial contract of 1246 notices Stephen as "Ruler, and Duke of Slavonia". Evidently, in the earlier year, BÄÅ¡la had his child delegated as junior ruler and supplied with the terrains between the waterway DrÄÄva and the Adriatic Sea, as indicated by students of history Gyula KristÄÅ and Ferenc Makk. The seven-year-old Stephen's provincesCroatia, Dalmatia and Slavoniawere regulated by imperial governors, known as bans. 

In a letter routed to Pope Innocent IV in the late 1240s, BÄÅ¡la IV composed that "[o]n benefit of Christendom we had our child wed a Cuman young lady". The lady of the hour was Elizabeth, the little girl of a pioneer of the Cumans whom BÄÅ¡la had welcome to settle in the fields along the stream Tisza. Elizabeth had been purified through water, however ten Cuman chieftains present at the service by and by made their standard vow upon a canine cut into two by a sword. 

At the point when Stephen accomplished the time of dominant part in 1257, his dad named him Duke of Transylvania. Stephen's standard in Transylvania was brief, since his dad exchanged him to Styria in 1258. Styria had been attached in 1254, yet the nearby masters ascended in defiance and ousted BÄÅ¡la IV's representative, Stephen Gutkeled, before Stephen's arrangement. Stephen and his dad together attacked Styria and stifled the agitators. Notwithstanding Styria, Stephen additionally gotten two neighboring countiesVas and Zalain Hungary from his dad. He propelled a looting attack in Carinthia in the spring of 1259, in countering of Duke Ulrich III of Carinthia's help of the Styrian rebels. 

Stephen's standard stayed disliked in Styria. With help from King Ottokar II of Bohemia, the neighborhood rulers again revolted. Stephen could safeguard just Pettau (present-day Ptuj, Slovenia) and its locale. On 25 June 1260, Stephen crossed the stream Morava to attack Ottokar's domain. His military power, which comprised of SzÄÅ¡kely, Romanian and Cuman troops, directed an Austrian armed force. Be that as it may, in the unequivocal Battle of Kressenbrunn King BÄÅ¡la's and Stephen's assembled armed force was vanquished on 12 July, fundamentally on the grounds that the principle powers, which were under King BÄÅ¡la's direction, arrived late. Stephen, who instructed the development watch, scarcely got away from the war zone. The Peace of Vienna, which was marked on 31 March 1261, put a conclusion to the contention among Hungary and Bohemia, driving BÄÅ¡la IV to disavow of Styria for Ottokar II. 

Stephen came back to Transylvania and began to govern it for the second time after 20 August 1260. He and his dad together attacked Bulgaria and seized Vidin in 1261. His dad came back to Hungary, however Stephen proceeded with the crusade alone. He laid attack to Lom on the Danube and progressed similarly as Tirnovo in quest for Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria. Notwithstanding, the Tsar prevailing with regards to staying away from any conflicts with the intruders and Stephen pulled back his troops from Bulgaria before the year's over. 

Stephen's association with BÄÅ¡la IV crumbled in the mid 1260s. Stephen's contracts uncover his dread of being excluded and removed by his dad. He additionally blamed some anonymous noblemen for impelling the old ruler against him. Then again, Stephen's sanctions demonstrate that he made land allows in Bihar, SzatmÄÄr, Ugocsa, and different areas which were arranged outside Transylvania. 

Ecclesiastical overseers Philip of Esztergom and Smaragd of Kalocsa attempted to intervene after certain conflicts happened between the two lords' partisans in the harvest time. As indicated by the Peace of Pressburg, which was finished up around 25 November, BÄÅ¡la IV and his child partitioned the nation and Stephen got the grounds toward the east of the Danube. While affirming the arrangement on 5 December, Stephen likewise guaranteed that he would not attack Slavonia which had been conceded to his more youthful sibling, BÄÅ¡la, by their dad. On this event, Stephen styled himself "Junior King, Duke of Transylvania and Lord of the Cumans". 

A Bulgarian aristocrat, Despot Jacob Svetoslav looked for help from Stephen after his spaces, which were arranged in the locales south of Vidin, were invaded by Byzantine troops in the second 50% of 1263. Stephen sent fortifications under the order of Ladislaus II KÄÄn, Voivode of Transylvania to Bulgaria. The Voivode steered the Byzantines and drove them out of Bulgaria. Stephen allowed Vidin to Jacob Svetoslav who acknowledged his suzerainty. 

The compromise of Stephen and his dad was just impermanent. Stephen reallocated the areas of his mom and sister, Annaincluding Beszterce (present-day BistriÄÂa, Romania) and FÄÅºzÄÅ¡rwhich were situated in the terrains under his standard. BÄÅ¡la IV's military crossed the Danube under Anna's direction after 1 August 1264. She attacked and took SÄÄrospatak and caught Stephen's significant other and youngsters. Voivode Ladislaus KÄÄn betrayed Stephen and drove a military, which comprised of Cuman warriors, to Transylvania. Stephen steered him at the fortification of DÄÅ¡va (presently Deva, Romania). Lord BÄÅ¡la's Judge regal, Lawrence touched base at the leader of another military and constrained Stephen to withdraw to Feketehalom (presently Codlea, Romania). The Judge regal lay attack to the post, however Stephen's partisans assuaged it. Stephen propelled a counter-hostile and constrained his dad's military to withdraw. He picked up a definitive triumph over his dad's military in the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265. The two diocese supervisors interceded another union among dad and child, which affirmed the 1262 division of the nation. BÄÅ¡la and Stephen marked the harmony settlement in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on the Rabbits' Island (presently Margaret Island in Budapest) on 23 March 1266. 

Amid the common war in Hungary, Stephen's vassal, Despot Jacob Svetoslav submitted himself to Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria. In the late spring of 1266, Stephen attacked Bulgaria, seized Vidin, Pleven and different fortresses and directed the Bulgarians in five fights. Jacob Svetoslav again acknowledged Stephen's suzerainty and was reinstalled in Vidin. From that point on, Stephen utilized the title "Lord of Bulgaria" in his sanctions. 

BÄÅ¡la and Stephen together affirmed the freedoms of the "imperial hirelings", from that point on known as aristocrats, in 1267. A twofold marriage partnership among Stephen and King Charles I of SicilyStephen's child, Ladislaus wedded Charles' little girl, Elisabeth, and Charles' namesake child wedded Stephen's little girl, Marystrengthened Stephen's global position in 1269. Certainty was never reestablished among BÄÅ¡la and Stephen. On his deathbed, the old King mentioned King Ottokar II of Bohemia to offer safe house to his little girl Anna and his partisans after his demise. 

The senior King passed on 3 May 1270. His little girl, Anna, caught the imperial treasury and fled to Bohemia. Henry KÄºÂszegi, Nicholas Geregye, and Lawrence AbaBÄÅ la's nearest advisorsfollowed her and given over KÄºÂszeg, BorostyÄÄnkÄºÂ (Bernstein, Austria) and their different manors along the western outskirts to Ottokar II. Rather than leaving Hungary, Nicholas HahÄÅt garrisoned Styrian fighters in his fortification at PÄÅlÄÅske, and made ravaging assaults against the close-by towns. Stephen selected his very own partisans to the most elevated workplaces; for example, Joachim Gutkeled moved toward becoming Ban of Slavonia, and Matthew CsÄÄk was delegated Voivode of Transylvania. Stephen conceded Esztergom County to Archbishop Philip who delegated him ruler in Esztergom on or after 17 May. 

The Polish writer Jan DÄºÂugosz composes that Stephen made "a journey to the tomb of St. StanisÄºÂaw" in Cracow and visited his brother by marriage, Boleslaw the Chaste, Duke of Cracow toward the finish of August. The two rulers reestablished "the old union among Hungary and Poland" and went into a coalition "to have similar companions and similar foes". Stephen likewise met Ottokar II on an island of the Danube close Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia), however they just finished up a ceasefire. 

Stephen propelled a pillaging assault into Austria around 21 December. Ruler Ottokar attacked the terrains north of the Danube in April 1271 and caught various posts, including DÄÅ¡vÄÅ¡ny (presently DevÄÂ­n, Slovakia), Pressburg and Nagyszombat (present-day Trnava, Slovakia). Ottokar steered Stephen at Pressburg on 9 May, and at MosonmagyarÄÅvÄÄr on 15 May, however Stephen won the definitive fight on the RÄÄbca River on 21 May. Ottokar pulled back from Hungary and Stephen pursued his troops similar to Vienna. The two lords' agents achieved an understanding in Pressburg on 2 July. As per their arrangement, Stephen guaranteed that he would not help Ottokar's adversaries in Carinthia, and Ottokar repudiated the manors he and his partisans held in Hungary. The Hungarians before long recovered KÄºÂszeg, BorostyÄÄnkÄºÂ and different posts along the western fringe of Hungary. 

As indicated by the "Life" of Stephen's righteous sister, Margaret, who had passed on 18 May 1270, Stephen was available when the main supernatural occurrence ascribed to her happened on the primary commemoration of her demise. Stephen, truth be told, started Margaret's canonization at the Holy See in 1271. Around the same time, Stephen allowed town benefits to the residents of GyÄºÂr. He likewise affirmed the freedoms of the Saxon "visitors" in the SzepessÄÅ¡g locale (present-day SpiÄºÄ, Slovakia), adding to the advancement of their self-ruling network. Then again, Stephen secured the Archbishop of Esztergom's rights against the contingent nobles of the archbishopric who endeavored to dispose of their commitments. 

Boycott Joachim Gutkeled captured Stephen's ten-year-old child and beneficiary, Ladislaus and detained him in the mansion of Koprivnica in the late spring of 1272. Stephen blockaded the fortification, yet couldn't catch it. Stephen became sick and was taken to the Csepel Island. He kicked the bucket on 6 August 1272. Stephen was covered close to the tomb of his sister, Margaret, in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island. 

Stephen's better half, Elizabeth, was conceived around 1239, as indicated by history specialist Gyula KristÄÅ. A sanction of her dad in-law, BÄÅ¡la IV, alludes to one Seyhan, a Cuman chieftain as his brother, inferring that Seyhan was Elizabeth's dad. Stephen's first youngster by Elizabeth, Catherine, was conceived around 1256. She was given in marriage to Stephen Dragutin, the senior child and beneficiary of King Stephen UroÄºÄ I of Serbia, in around 1268. Her sister Mary was conceived around 1257 and wedded the future Charles II of Naples in 1270. Their grandson Charles Robert moved toward becoming King of Hungary in the main decade of the 14thÃ¢Â century.
