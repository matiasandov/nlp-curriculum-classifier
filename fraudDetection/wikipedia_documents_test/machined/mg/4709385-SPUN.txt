It was initially wanted to be a highly contrasting film titled "Mayil" and supported by the National Film Development Corporation of India (NDFC), however as indicated by Bharathiraja, the NFDC pulled back finally without determining a reason. The film was in the long run gotten by S. A. Rajkannu who delivered it under his flag Shri Amman Creations. "Mayil" was in the long run re-titled "16 Vayathinile", and its exchange was composed by P.

For the job of Mayil's mom Kuruvammal, Bharathiraja needed somebody who could talk the town vernacular smoothly and picked Ganthimathi for her acting style. Accepting a pay of , Bhagyaraj was at first considered for the veterinarian's job however needed to focus on coordinating; regardless of that, despite everything he showed up in the film. The job of the veterinarian went to newcomer Shabbir Ahmed, who was given the screen name Sathyajith amid after creation. His scenes were shot in ten days.

A succession including flawed lip match up was held in the polished product in the wake of going unnoticed. 

While Bharathiraja needed the film to pursue a straight portrayal, it was Bhagyaraj's plan to start the film with a flashback arrangement.

Film pundit Naman Ramachandran contrasted Parattai with Rajinikanth's character Kondaji from "Katha Sangama" (1975), expressing, "As in that film, Rajinikanth is a card-playing wastrel with partners in crime close by. Much the same as the Thimmaraya character in "Katha Sangama" runs errands for Kondaji, here Chappani/Gopalakrishnan performs administrations for Parattai, however the similitude finishes there in light of the fact that Thimmaraya is malevolent and Chappani is great."
