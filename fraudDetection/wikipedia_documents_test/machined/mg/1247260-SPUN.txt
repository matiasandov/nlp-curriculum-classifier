Sukhoi Su-9 (1946) 

The Sukhoi Su-9 or Samolyet K (); (USAF/DoD assignment: Type 8), was an early stream contender worked in the Soviet Union not long after World War II. The plan started in 1944 and was proposed to utilize Soviet-planned turbojet motors. The plan was intensely affected by caught German fly warriors and it was in this manner updated to utilize a Soviet duplicate of a German turbojet. The Su-9 was slower than contending Soviet air ship and it was dropped thus. An altered variant with various motors and a reconsidered wing turned into the Su-11 ("Samolyet KL"), yet this did not enter generation either. The Su-13 ("Samolyet KT") was a proposition to re-motor the flying machine with Soviet duplicates of the Rolls-Royce Derwent turbojet just as to alter it for night battling, however neither one of the proposals was acknowledged. 

In 1944, the Sukhoi structure agency (OKB) started planning a twin-engined contender fueled by two Lyulka TR-1 turbojets, referred to inside as the Samolyet or Izdeliye (thing or item) K. A definitive structure was all around most likely impacted by a caught Messerschmitt Me 262, however the Su-9 was not a duplicate of the German air ship. The Su-9 had an oval cross-area, all-metal focused on skin monocoque fuselage that housed a solitary cockpit. The pilot was secured by protective layer plates to his front, a shielded seat back and an impenetrable windscreen for the air pocket shade. He was given a discharge situate, duplicated from that utilized in the Heinkel He 162. The airplane conveyed a sum of fuel in two bladder tanks, one each ahead and behind the pilot. The low-mounted, straight wing had a solitary fight and a slight dihedral of 4Ã¢Â°20'. The external folds were part and could go about as air powered brakes. The Su-9 was the primary Soviet airplane to utilize pressure driven controlled controls. A Soviet duplicate of the Junkers Jumo 004B turbojet, known as the RD-10, was hung under each wing in a streamlined nacelle. The flying machine had a tricycle undercarriage that withdrawn into the fuselage. The Su-9 was structured with an exceptionally high wing stacking which expanded the flying machine's speed and diminished its measurements. This subsequently expanded the take-off and landing speeds so it was outfitted with an arrangement for two JATO bottles (11.27ÃÂ kN (530Ã¢Â lbf) push for 8 seconds) mounted on the sides of the fuselage. These diminished the take-off separation by about 50 percent and a braking parachute was fitted to decrease the arrival remove. 

The nose housed the combat hardware of one Nudelman N-37 autocannon and two Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon. The N-37 could be supplanted by a Nudelman N-45. The flying machine conveyed 100 rounds for every NS-23 and 40 rounds for the N-37. Two FAB-250 high dangerous bombs could be conveyed underneath the forward fuselage, yet the N-37 must be gotten off to do as such. 

As the TR-1 motors initially planned for the Su-9 were not yet prepared for flight testing in late 1945, Pavel Sukhoi recommended substituting a couple of Jumo 004 motors and this was endorsed on 15 December. The full-scale mockup was observed to be satisfactory on 16 February 1946 and the Council of People's Commissars issued a request on 26 February that the maker's flight trying was to start on 1 November. This objective was not met on the grounds that the OKB was intensely dedicated to different activities like the mentor rendition of the Tupolev Tu-2 plane, freshness with JATO units, and late conveyance of RD-10 motors. The principal model was finished in mid-October and made its first trip on 13 November. The aircraft testers found the air ship simple to fly, yet the control powers were high at speed and it sufficiently needed directional soundness. Amplifying the vertical stabilizer restored this last issue and water powered promoters were fitted for the control framework. 

The air ship was uncovered to the overall population on 3 August 1947 at a flypast at Moscow's Tushino Airfield and the flying machine started its state acknowledgment preliminaries three days after the fact. Flight testing was finished by 25 May 1948 after 136 flights had been finished. It showed a top speed of at an elevation of and a continuance of one hour and 44 minutes. It had mild dealing with characteristics with one motor out of commission. The air ship was suggested for generation, however it was fundamentally slower than the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 and Yakovlev Yak-15. The administration declined to do as such and the program was ended. 

A two-situate coach form, the Su-9UT, was arranged amid 1946, yet it also was dropped. The cockpit for the understudy would have been situated in front of the educator's cockpit and each would have had a different covering. The weapon would have been decreased to a couple of Berezin B-20 autocannon, each with a hundred rounds of ammo. The protection would have been evacuated to spare weight. 

Another model was started in 1946, yet this flying machine was proposed to utilize the Yakovlev-structured rendition of the afterburning RD-10F motor. In any case, wind burrow testing of the Su-9 in September uncovered that drag could be decreased if the motor nacelles were mounted in the wing instead of underneath it, and the wing tips were upgraded to utilize an alternate airfoil that essentially diminished Mach tuck. These progressions necessitated that the whole wing be upgraded; the wing fight was twisted into a reversed U to oblige the motors and opened folds supplanted the straightforward folds recently utilized. The tailplane was given a 5Ã¢Â° dihedral to move it out of the motor fumes. 

Before the model was done, Sukhoi was requested to utilize the Lyulka TR-1 turbojets initially proposed for the Su-9. This airplane was assigned the Su-11 and was called Samolyet KL by the OKB. Each TR-1 grew just 12.7ÃÂ kN (2,865Ã¢Â lbf) push each, instead of the 15ÃÂ kN (3300Ã¢Â lbf) required. The air ship made its first trip on 28 May 1947 and furthermore took part in the flypast at Tushino in August. It had a greatest speed of adrift dimension, however flight testing uncovered that it needed longitudinal dependability at high speeds. Alterations of the wing/nacelle filets and extending the motor nacelles neglected to fix these issues. Combined with the inaccessibility of develop TR-1 motors, these issues made the program be dropped. 

The Su-13, ("Samolyet KT"), was the last endeavor to additionally build execution of the fundamental Su-9 configuration, utilizing wing areas diminished from 11% to 9% thickness/harmony proportion and cleared tailplanes. The airplane was additionally fitted with a couple of Klimov RD-500 (unlicensed duplicates of the Rolls-Royce Derwent) motors with 15.6ÃÂ kN (3,500Ã¢Â lbf) push each. The combat hardware was changed to three 37Ã¢Â mm Nudelman N-37 gun, while drop tanks could be fitted underneath the wingtips. A night warrior adaptation with a "Torii" radar was likewise proposed, yet this required major auxiliary changes to oblige the radar. Neither one of the versions made it off the planning phase.
