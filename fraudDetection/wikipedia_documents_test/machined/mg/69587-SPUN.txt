Eir 

In Norse folklore, Eir (Old Norse "insurance, help, benevolence") is a goddess or valkyrie related with restorative ability. Eir is authenticated in the "Wonderful Edda", arranged in the thirteenth century from prior conventional sources; the "Exposition Edda", written in the thirteenth century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic verse, including a runic engraving from Bergen, Norway from around 1300. Researchers have guessed about whether these three sources allude to a similar figure, and discussion whether Eir may have been initially a mending goddess or a valkyrie. Also, Eir has been hypothesized as a type of the goddess Frigg and has been contrasted with the Greek goddess Hygieia. 

In the "Beautiful Edda" lyric "FjÄÅlsvinnsmÄÄl", the gatekeeper FjÄÅlsviÄÂ°r presents a rundown of the ladies that go to the woman of the keepÃ¢ÂÂMenglÄÅÄÂ°Ã¢ÂÂthat incorporates Eir, and states that they all sit on the slope Lyfjaberg (Old Norse "slope of recuperating" or "mending mountain"). The trade between the legend Svipdagr and FjÄÅlsviÄÂ°r referencing Eir is as per the following: 

After the trade, Svipdagr inquires as to whether these figures will give help if blÄÅts are made to them. FjÄÅlsviÄÂ°r reacts that Svipdagr is right: 

In section 35 of the "Writing Edda" book "Gylfaginning", the enthroned figure of High gives brief depictions of 16 ÄÄsynjur. High records Eir third, and says no more regarding her other than taking note of that "she is an amazingly decent doctor." In section 75 of the "Writing Edda" book "SkÄÄldskaparmÄÄl" Eir shows up inside a rundown of valkyrie names, yet Eir is excluded in the rundown of ÄÄsynjur in a similar part. 

In skaldic verse, the name Eir is visit in kennings for ladies. An example development is "Eir air" ("Eir of wealth"), happening in "GÄÂ­sla adventure". The name is as of now utilized thusly by the tenth century writers KormÄÄkr ÄÂgmundarson and HallfreÄÂ°r vandrÄÅÄÂ°askÄÄld. Thus, the name Eir is utilized in a lady kenning in a runic engraving recorded on a stick from Bergen, Norway around the year 1300. The stick records a typical commercial exchange pursued by a refrain from a disappointed copyist (alters connected per the interpreter's notes): 

Mindy Macleod and Bernard Mees set that the principal line of the engraving basically signifies "ladies make me hopeless" or possibly "marriage makes me hopeless," while the second line signifies "ladies frequently take a ton of rest from me." 

The name remained oftentimes utilized in lady kennings in rÄÂ­mur verse. 

As to apparently three unique, apparently clashing, notices of Eir, Andy Orchard says that the historical underpinnings of the name "Eir" may seem to fit the job of Eir as a goddess and hireling of MenglÄÅÄÂ° best, however that one ought to think about that the valkyries likewise can arouse the dead. John Lindow is suspicious of there having been a confidence in Eir as a goddess, expressing that "whether we should trust Snorri and envision the presence of a goddess Eir is hazardous". Rudolf Simek says that Eir may initially have been essentially a valkyrie instead of a goddess, and records the hireling of MenglÄÅÄÂ° by a similar name as a different figure. 

Hilda Ellis Davidson remarks that "basically nothing" is thought about Eir outside of her relationship with mending, and calls attention to that she is "singled out as one of the Norns who shape the lives of kids". Davidson includes that "no palatable ends" have been drawn from her name, and considers all notices of Eir as of a similar figure. Davidson says that, in reference to Eir's appearance among MenglÄÅÄÂ°'s ladies, that the names of these ladies "propose that they are watchman spirits, and [they are] said to 'asylum and spare' the individuals who make contributions of them. They could be much the same as defensive spirits of the house, guarding the two people." She furthermore draws a connection between these spirits and Lyfjaberg: 

Lyfjaberg is the place the goddess sits encompassed by her supportive spirits. Albeit recuperating by a goddessÃ¢ÂÂor in reality by a divine being eitherÃ¢ÂÂhas left little imprint on Norse fantasies as they have come down to us, there is no uncertainty that the mending intensity of goddesses was of colossal significance in day by day life in the pre-Christian period, similar to that of numerous ladies holy people in Christian occasions. The goddess who managed labor was held to have control over life and demise, and was loved as a lifegiver, both in the family home and in the courts of rulers, however she may likewise pass sentence of death. 

Henry Adams Bellows proposes a connection among Eir and the spot name "Lyfjaberg", which he interprets as "slope of mending". Howls noticed that original copies shift about the spelling of the spot name, and that he, similar to other people, has pursued nineteenth century researcher Sophus Bugge's decision. Roars expresses that the stanza referencing Lyfjaberg "suggests that Mengloth is a goddess of mending, and subsequently, maybe a hypostasis of Frigg, as of now hinted by her name [...]. In stanza 54, Eir shows up as one of Mengloth's handmaidens, and Eir, as indicated by Snorri ("Gylfaginning, 35") is herself the Norse Hygeia. Contrast this stanza with stanza 32."
