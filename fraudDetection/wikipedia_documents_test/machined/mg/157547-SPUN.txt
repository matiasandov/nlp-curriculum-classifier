Who's Next 

Who's Next is the fifth studio collection by English musical gang the Who. It created from the prematurely ended "Lifehouse" venture, a multi-media shake musical show composed by the gathering's Pete Townshend as a follow-up to the band's 1969 collection "Tommy". The undertaking was dropped attributable to its multifaceted nature and to clashes with Kit Lambert, the band's director, however Townshend was influenced the gathering should record the melodies as a clear studio collection. 

The Who recorded "Who's Next" with help from chronicle engineer Glyn Johns. Subsequent to delivering the melody "Won't Get Fooled Again" in the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, they moved to Olympic Studios to record and blend a large portion of the collection's residual tunes. They utilized synthesizer on the collection, especially on "Won't Get Fooled Again" and "Baba O'Riley", which were both discharged as singles. The spread photograph was shot by Ethan Russell; it made reference to the stone monument in the 1968 film "", as it included gathering individuals remaining by a solid heaping jutting from a slag stack, obviously having peed against it. 

"Who's Next" was a prompt achievement when it was discharged in August 1971. It has since been seen by numerous faultfinders as the Who's best record and one of the best collections ever. It was reissued on CD a few times, with extra tunes initially expected for "Lifehouse". 

By 1970, the Who had gotten huge basic and business achievement, yet they had begun to turned out to be disengaged from their unique crowd. The mod development had evaporated, and the first devotees from Shepherd's Bush had grown up and gained employments and families. The gathering had begun to float separated from chief Kit Lambert, attributable to his distraction with their mark, Track Records. They had been visiting since the arrival of "Tommy" the past May, with a set that contained the vast majority of that collection, yet understood that millions had now observed their live exhibitions, and Pete Townshend specifically perceived that they expected to explore new territory. A solitary, "The Seeker", and a live collection, "Live at Leeds", were discharged in 1970, and an EP of new material ("Water", "Stripped Eye", "I Don't Even Know Myself", "Postcard" and "Now I'm a Farmer") was recorded, however not discharged as the band felt it would not be a tasteful follow-up to "Tommy". 

Rather, the gathering handled a task called "Lifehouse". This developed from a progression of sections Townshend composed for "Song Maker" in August 1970, in which he talked about the significance of shake music, and specifically what the gathering of people could do. Of all the gathering, he was the most quick to utilize music as a specialized gadget, and needed to fan out into other media, including film, to make tracks in an opposite direction from the customary collection/visit cycle. Townshend has differently portrayed "Lifehouse" as a cutting edge shake musical show, a live-recorded idea collection and as the music for a scripted film venture. The fundamental plot was sketched out in a meeting Townshend provided for "Plate and Music Echo" on 24 October 1970. "Lifehouse" is set sooner rather than later in a general public in which music is prohibited and the greater part of the populace live inside in government-controlled "experience suits". A radical, Bobby, communicates shake music into the suits, enabling individuals to evacuate them and become progressively edified. A few components precisely portray future innovation; for instance, The Grid takes after the web and "framework rest" computer generated reality. 

The gathering held a question and answer session on 13 January 1971, clarifying that they would give a progression of shows at the Young Vic theater, where they would build up the anecdotal components of the proposed film alongside the group of onlookers. After Keith Moon had finished his work on the film "200 Motels", the gathering played out their first Young Vic show on 15 February. The show incorporated another quadrophonic open location framework which cost ÃÅ30,000; the group of onlookers was for the most part welcomed from different associations, for example, youth clubs, with just a couple of tickets marked down to the overall population. 

After the underlying shows, the gathering traveled to New York's Record Plant Studios at Lambert's recommendation, for studio chronicles. The gathering were joined by visitors Al Kooper on Hammond organ, Ken Ascher on piano and Leslie West on guitar. Townshend utilized a 1957 Gretsch guitar, given to him by Joe Walsh, amid the session; it proceeded to turn into his primary guitar for studio recording. Lambert's cooperation in the chronicle was insignificant, and he turned out to be unfit to blend the last accounts. He had begun taking hard medications, while Townshend was drinking cognac normally. In the wake of coming back to Britain engineer Glyn Johns made security duplicates of the Record Plant material, yet concluded that it is smarter to re-record it starting with no outside help at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes. 

The gathering gave a further arrangement of shows at the Young Vic on 25 and 26 April, which were recorded on the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio by Andy Johns, yet Townshend became frustrated with "Lifehouse" and further shows were dropped. The venture turned out to be immovable on a few dimensions, and caused worry inside the band just as a noteworthy dropping out among Townshend and Lambert. A long time later, in the liner notes to the remastered CD, Townshend composed that the disappointment of the undertaking drove him to the skirt of a mental meltdown. Crowds at the Young Vic gigs were not keen on connecting with the gathering to make new material, yet just needed the Who to play "My Generation" and crush a guitar. At the time, Roger Daltrey said the Who "were never closer to separating". 

In spite of the fact that the "Lifehouse" idea was relinquished, pieces of the venture stayed in the last collection, including the utilization of synthesizers and PCs. An early idea for "Lifehouse" included the sustaining of individual information from gathering of people individuals into the controller of an early simple synthesizer to make a "widespread harmony" that would have finished the proposed film. Forsaking "Lifehouse" gave the gathering additional opportunity, inferable from the nonattendance of an abrogating melodic topic or storyline (which had been the premise of "Tommy"). This enabled the band to focus on augmenting the effect of individual tracks, and giving a binding together solid to them. 

Despite the fact that he surrendered his unique aims for the "Lifehouse" venture, Townshend kept on building up the ideas, returning to them in later collections, including a 6-CD set, "The Lifehouse Chronicles" in 1999. In 2007, he opened a site called The Lifehouse Method to acknowledge individual contribution from candidates that would be transformed into melodic representations. 

The primary session for what turned into "Who's Next" was at Mick Jagger's home, Stargroves, toward the beginning of April 1971, utilizing the Rolling Stones Mobile. The sponsorship track of "Won't Get Fooled Again" was recorded there before the band chose to move recording to Olympic at Johns' proposal; the primary session was on 9 April, endeavoring a fundamental take of "Deal". The heft of the sessions happened amid May, when the gathering recorded "Time is Passing", "Unadulterated and Easy", "Love Ain't for Keeping" (which had been revamped from a stone track into an acoustic game plan), "Behind Blue Eyes", "The Song Is Over", "How about we See Action" and "Baba O'Riley". Nicky Hopkins guested on piano, while Dave Arbus was welcomed by Moon to play violin on "Baba O'Riley". John Entwistle's "My Wife" was added to the collection late in the sessions, having been initially expected for a performance collection. 

Rather than the Record Plant and Young Vic sessions, recording with Johns went well as he was principally worried about making a decent solid, though Lambert had dependably been progressively distracted about the gathering's picture. Townshend reviewed, "we were simply getting amazed at the sounds Glyn was delivering". Townshend utilized the early synthesizers and adjusted console sounds in a few modes: as an automaton impact on a few tunes, strikingly "Baba O'Riley" and "Won't Get Fooled Again", just as on "Deal", "Going Mobile" and "The Song Is Over". The synthesizer was utilized as a fundamental piece of the sound, rather than giving sparkle similar to the case on other craftsmen's collections so far. Moon's drumming has an unmistakably extraordinary style from prior collections, being progressively formal and less dependent on long drum fillsÃ¢ÂÂpartly inferable from the synthesizer backing, yet in addition because of the straightforward generation procedures of Johns, who demanded a decent chronicle exhibition that possibly utilized ostentatiousness when genuinely fundamental. Johns was instrumental in persuading the Who that they should essentially put a solitary studio collection out, trusting the melodies to be phenomenal. The gathering gave him free rein to collect a solitary collection of whatever tunes he needed in any request. In spite of Johns' key commitments, he just got a partner maker credit on the completed collection, however he kept up he acted fundamentally in a designing limit and put together the vast majority of the plans with respect to Townshend's unique demos. 

The collection opened with "Baba O'Riley", including piano and synthesizer-handled Lowrey organ by Townshend. The melody's title pays respect to Townshend's master, Meher Baba, and moderate arranger Terry Riley (and is casually known as "Adolescent Wasteland" from a line in the verses). The organ track originated from a more drawn out demo by Townshend, segments of which were later included on a Baba tribute collection "I Am", that was altered down for the last chronicle. Townshend later said this part had "a few thousand alters to it". The opening verses to the following track, "Deal", "I'd readily lose me to discover you", originated from an expression utilized by Baba. Entwistle expressed "My Wife" in the wake of having a contention with his better half and overstating the contention in the verses. The track includes a few overdubbed metal instruments recorded in a solitary half-hour session. "Unadulterated and Easy", a key track from "Lifehouse", did not make the last track determination, however the opening line was incorporated as a coda to "The Song is Over". 

"Behind Blue Eyes" highlighted three-section amicability by Daltrey, Townshend and Entwistle and was composed for the primary rival in "Lifehouse", Brick. Moon, strangely, did not show up on the main portion of the track, which was later portrayed by Who biographer Dave Marsh as "the longest time Keith Moon was still in all his years." The end track, "Won't Get Fooled Again", was incredulous of upsets. Townshend clarified, "an upset is just an upheaval over the long haul and many individuals will get injured". The tune includes the Lowrey organ sustained through an ARP synthesizer, which originated from Townshend's unique demo and was re-utilized for the completed track. 

The spread work of art demonstrates a photo, taken at Easington Colliery, of the band evidently having quite recently peed on an extensive solid heaping jutting from a slag pile. The choice to shoot the image originated from Entwistle and Moon talking about Stanley Kubrick and the film "". As indicated by picture taker Ethan Russell, just Townshend really peed against the heaping, so water was tipped from an unfilled film canister to accomplish the ideal impact. The sky out of sight was added later to give the picture what Russell called "this other common quality." The back spread demonstrated the band behind the stage at De Montfort Hall, Leicester, among a garbage of furniture. In 2003, the TV station VH1 named "Who's Next's" spread one of the best collection fronts ever. 

Different recommendations for the spread incorporated the gathering peeing against a Marshall Stack and an overweight bare lady with the Who's faces instead of her genitalia. An elective spread including Moon wearing dark unmentionables and a darker wig, holding a whip, was later utilized for within craftsmanship for the 1995 and 2003 CD discharges. A portion of the photos taken amid these sessions were later utilized as a component of Decca's United States advancement of the collection. 

The lead single, "Won't Get Fooled Again" (altered down to three and a half minutes), was discharged on 25 June 1971 in the UK and in July in the US in front of the collection. It came to #9 and #15 in the graphs separately. The collection was discharged in August in the US and on 27 August in the UK. It turned into the main collection by the Who to top the UK graphs. 

The Who beginning visiting the US just before the collection was discharged. The gathering utilized the "Lifehouse" PA, however soundman Bob Pridden found the specialized prerequisites of the gear to be over-convoluted. The set rundown was patched up, and keeping in mind that it incorporated a littler determination of numbers from "Tommy", a few new numbers from the new collection, for example, "My Wife", "Baba O'Riley" and "Won't Get Fooled Again" turned out to be live top picks. The last two melodies included the band playing to a sponsorship track containing the synthesizer parts. The visit moved to the UK in September, including a show at The Oval, Kennington before 35,000 fans, and the opening gig at the Rainbow Theater in Finsbury Park, before returning to the US, finishing off with Seattle on 15 December. The gathering at that point took eight months off visiting, the longest break of their profession by then. 

A few extra tunes recorded at the "Who's Next" sessions were discharged later as singles or on assemblages. "We should See Action" was discharged as a solitary in 1971, trailed by "Consolidate" in June 1972 and "Transfer" in November. "Unadulterated and Easy", "Put the Money Down" and "A lot of Anything" were discharged on the collection "Chances and Sods", while "Time is Passing" was added to the 1998 CD rendition. A front of "Infant Don't You Do It" was recorded and the longest form right now accessible is on the choice release of the collection. 

The collection has been re-issued remastered a few times utilizing tapes from various sessions. The ace tapes for the Olympic sessions are accepted to be lost, as Virgin Records tossed out a significant number of old chronicles when they obtained the studio during the 1980s. Computer game distributer Harmonix needed to discharge "Who's Next" as downloadable, playable substance for the music computer game arrangement "Musical gang", yet were unfit to do as such because of trouble finding the first multi track accounts. Rather, an aggregation of Who melodies named "The Best of The Who", which incorporates three of the collection's tunes ("Behind Blue Eyes", "Baba O'Riley", and "Going Mobile"), was discharged as downloadable substance, in lieu of the prior guaranteed "Who's Next" collection. The 16-track tapes to "Won't Get Fooled Again" and the 8-track tapes to the next material with the exception of "Deal" and "Getting In Tune" have since been found. 

Looking into for "The Village Voice" in 1971, music commentator Robert Christgau called "Who's Next" "the best hard shake collection in years" and said that, while their past chronicles were defaced by a flimsy sound, the gathering currently "accomplishes the equivalent thunderous quickness in the studio that it does live". Billy Walker from "Sounds" featured the tunes "Baba O'Riley", "My Wife", and "The Song Is Over", and stated, "After the extraordinary splendor of "Tommy" something uncommon must be thoroughly considered and the way that they made due with a straight-forward collection instead of an expansion of their stone musical show, says much for their valor and imaginativeness." "Moving Stone" magazine's John Mendelsohn felt that, in spite of some measure of reality and imitation, the collection's image of shake and roll is "shrewdly imagined, greatly performed, splendidly delivered, and here and there energizing". Toward the finish of 1971, the record was casted a ballot the best collection of the year in the Pazz and Jop, a yearly survey of American faultfinders distributed by "The Village Voice". 

From that point forward, "Who's Next" has regularly been seen as the Who's best collection. In a review audit for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said its music was more veritable than "Tommy" or the prematurely ended "Lifehouse" venture in light of the fact that "those were workmanship Ã¢ÂÂ ["Who's Next"], even with its demands, is shake and move." BBC Music's Chris Roberts refered to it as the band's best record and "one of those cut in-stone tourist spots that the stone ordinance doesn't enable you to castigate." "Magic" asserted its advanced music and snare loaded melodies included inventive utilization of shake synthesizers that did not debilitate the Who's trademark "control group of four assault". In "The Encyclopedia of Popular Music" (1998), Colin Larkin said it raised the gauges for both hard shake and the Who, whose "feeling of elements" was featured by the differentiation between their amazing playing and a contradiction created on occasion from acoustic guitars and synthesizer obbligatos. Christgau, then again, was less energetic about the record amid the 1980s when the Who moved toward becoming what he felt was "the most exceedingly terrible sort of workmanship musical gang", composing that "Who's Next" uncovered itself to be less elegant everything considered as a result of Daltrey's theatrical singing and "all that synth noodling". 

As per Acclaimed Music, "Who's Next" is the 35th-most positioned record in commentators' arrangements of the untouched most prominent collections. In 2003, "Moving Stone" positioned it 28th on its rundown of the 500 biggest collections ever. The collection showed up at number 15 on Pitchfork Media's rundown of the 100 best records from the 1970s. It was additionally incorporated into the book "1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die" (2005). The "Exemplary Albums" BBC narrative arrangement publicized a scene on "Who's Next", at first on radio in 1989, and after that on TV in 1998, which was discharged in 2006 on DVD as "". That year, the collection was picked by "Time" as one of their 100 best records ever. In 2007, it was enlisted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for "enduring subjective or verifiable hugeness". 

The main plate of the Deluxe Edition contains the nine tracks from the first collection containing the first blend, trailed by six outtakes, of which "Getting in Tune" and "Won't Get Fooled Again" were already unreleased. Every one of the six outtakes was recorded amid the Record Plant sessions in March 1971 preceding work restarted in the UK. 

The tracks on the second plate were recorded live on 26 April 1971 at the Young Vic Theater, London. The majority of the tracks were already unreleased aside from "Water" and "Bare Eye".
