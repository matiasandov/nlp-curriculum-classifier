A Gold Glove Award-winning first baseman, he once held baseball's record for most back to back errorless amusements at a respectable starting point (later broken by Casey Kotchman). He is likewise a three-time MLB All-Star, two-time World Series Champion, and victor of the 2008 Hank Aaron Award. 

A serious entertainer on the playing field, Youkilis was known for his sketchiness, lumpiness, earth recolored pullovers, home-plate impacts, and his unusual batting position. He exceeded expectations in spite of a build that drove numerous eyewitnesses to think little of his athletic capacity. He was designated "roly-poly" by his secondary school mentor, "stout" by his school mentor, a "fat child" by general administrator Billy Beane, and a "thicker-bodied person" by the Red Sox scout who enrolled him. As Jackie MacMullan composed for the "Boston Globe": "He doesn't resemble a MVP competitor; more an icebox repairman, a butcher, the man selling hammers behind the counter at the True Value tool shop." Youkilis was named to the "Wearing News" rundown of the 50 biggest current players in baseball, positioning No. 36 on the rundown in 2009, No. 38 out of 2010, and No. 35 out of 2011. 

Youkilis' Jewish incredible extraordinary granddad, a local of nineteenth century Romania, moved to Greece at 16 years old to stay away from induction on account of the famously against Semitic Cossacks. He wound up achy to go home, in any case, and came back to Romania following two or three years, in spite of the fact that he changed his surname from "Weiner" to "Youkilis" to keep away from armed force and prison. 

Youkilis was conceived in Cincinnati, the child of Carolyn (nÄÅ¡e Weekley) and Mike Youkilis, a discount gem dealer. His dad was destined to a Jewish family, while his mom, a local of West Virginia, changed over to Judaism after her marriage. Youkilis has portrayed his dad as a "notable third baseman in the Jewish Community Center quick pitch softball alliance." 

Youkilis is Jewish and had a Bar Mitzvah at a Conservative synagogue. At 14 years old, he had an uncredited one-line talking job in the rom-com film "Milk Money". He went to Sycamore High School in the northeastern rural areas of Cincinnati, where he played third base, shortstop, a respectable starting point, and the outfield for the school group which won the Amateur Athletic Union National Championship in 1994. While at Sycamore High School, he was the main player to homer off his future Red Sox colleague Aaron Cook. 

When he moved on from secondary school in 1997, Youkilis weighed around 227 pounds and was 6' 1". He was enlisted by two Division I schools: Butler University and his definitive decision, the University of Cincinnati Ã¢ÂÂan organization that was the place of graduation of the two his dad and Youkilis' long-lasting symbol, Sandy Koufax, and had recently completed a 12Ã¢ÂÂ46 season. UC mentor Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. "I took a gander at him and stated, Well, we need someone", said Cleary. "I'd love to disclose to you I saw something nobody else did, yet he was simply superior to anything what we had." 

While studying fund, Youkilis exceeded expectations as a player for the Cincinnati Bearcats from 1998 to 2001. "I assume no praise", said Cleary. "He mentors himself. He knows his swing. Whenever we said anything to him, he was at that point a stage ahead. He made the changes he needed to make. I simply believe he's a truly shrewd person who had an incredible vibe for what he needed to do." In his lesser year in 2000, he was a second-group All-American and first-group All-Conference USA, as he set school records by hitting three homers in a single amusement and 19 for the season; still, he went undrafted. "He was somewhat of a square-formed body, a person [who] in a uniform didn't look such athletic", Cleary said. "He was certainly not a tall, prospect-y looking person. He looked rotund in a uniform. ... It wasn't fat. He was solid. [But] I figure the body scared a few people away." 

Amid the period between his lesser and senior years, he played in the Cape Cod League, completing 6th in the association in batting normal. In his senior year in 2001 he rehashed as second-group All-American. He set UC vocation records for grand slams (56), strolls (206), slugging rate (.627), and on-base rate (.499) with a batting normal of .366. "He had an incredible eye ... he barely ever struck out looking", said Brad Meador, UC's partner head mentor. "When he did, you realized the ump missed the call." Cleary, taking note of how determined Youkilis was to succeed, told his dad: "Your child will be a mogul sometime in the future. I don't have the foggiest idea if it's in baseball, however he's going to profit one of nowadays." Youkilis was later accepted into UC's James Kelly Athletics Hall of Fame. 

However, when gotten some information about Youkilis, previous Boston scout Matt Haas stated: "At first look, not a ton. He was unconventional. He had an outrageous crouchÃ¢ÂÂhis thighs were practically parallel to the ground. What's more, he was heavier than he is currently. Be that as it may, the more I watched him, the more I just idea, 'Toss the apparatuses out the window. This person can play baseball.'" 

In 2001, at Haas' encouraging, the Boston Red Sox drafted Youkilis in the eighth round (243rd in general), to the mortification of Billy Beane, who had trusted that he would almost certainly draft him in a later round. ESPN announced that: "inquiries regarding his resistance and power with wood kept him out of the top piece of the draft." He marked for an insignificant $12,000 marking reward. "Kevin would have played for a six-pack of brew", his dad said. 

"Groups didnÃ¢ÂÂt acknowledge execution as much then as they do now", watched Red Sox VP of Player Personnel Ben Cherington eight years after the fact. "His school execution was off the diagrams. On the off chance that he [were] in the draft this year, he'd be something like a sandwich pick, if not a first rounder. His execution was that great, in school and on the Cape. Presently, groups acknowledge what that implies. It is extremely unlikely heÃ¢ÂÂd keep going that long at this point." 

In 2001, Youkilis made his expert introduction as a third baseman with the Lowell Spinners, a Short-Season A Class establishment in the New YorkÃ¢ÂÂPenn League. He proceeded to lead the association with a .512 OBP, 52 runs, and 70 strolls (against only 28 strikeouts), while hitting for a .317 batting normal (third in the alliance) in 59 amusements. He additionally achieved base securely by hit or stroll in 46 continuous diversions (the third-longest such streak in the small time). Dwindle Gammons composed that August: "Recollect this name: Kevin Youkilis, who takes after Steve Balboni." Honored by the Spinners with a "Youkilis bobblehead night", Youkilis stated: "It's an honorÃ¢ÂÂyou realize you've influenced it when you to get a bobblehead of yourself." Promoted from Lowell towards the finish of the period, he played five recreations with the Augusta GreenJackets of the South Atlantic League, a Low-A Class alliance. He was named Red Sox Minor League Player of the Year. 

In 2002, Youkilis showed up in 15 amusements for Augusta, in 76 recreations for the Sarasota Sox (40 of them at a respectable starting point), and in 44 diversions for the Trenton Thunder.

After the 2002 season, Boston's then-collaborator general chief, Theo Epstein, sent Youkilis to the Athletes' Performance Institute in Tempe, Arizona, where he occupied with a concentrated six-week preparing routine. Youkilis then moved his off-season home to Arizona, and went to the Institute in the 2004Ã¢ÂÂ08 off seasons too.

Amid his time with Pawtucket, Youkilis figured out how to finish a streak he began while in Portland: he achieved base in 71 sequential recreations, tying future colleague Kevin Millar's small time record for back to back diversions achieving base. His 104 strolls were the third-most noteworthy number recorded in the minors in 2003. Asked, nonetheless, about the spotlight in position-playing baseball on five-instrument players, Youkilis joked, "I don't know whether I have a device." 

Composing for ESPN, John Sickels assessed him as follows in mid-2003: 

Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at an awful pitch, and is skilled at working forgets about and thinking the pitcher. Dissimilar to some folks who draw loads of strolls, Youkilis only occasionally strikes out. He reaches against the two fastballs and breaking pitches. Youkilis' swing is custom fitted for the line drive, and he may never hit for much grand slam control. Be that as it may, he hits balls to the holes successfully, and could create 10Ã¢ÂÂ14 grand slam shut not far off. Youkilis does not have excellent speed, however he is a not too bad baserunner. His resistance at third base draws blended audits. His arm, range, and hands all rate as satisfactory/normal. He doesn't murder the protection at third base, yet he doesn't resist much, either, and is probably going to finish up at a respectable starting point not far off. 

Youkilis spent the 2003Ã¢ÂÂ04 winter in Mexico, playing for Navojoa of the Mexican Pacific League. In 2004, he showed up in 32 diversions for Pawtucket, hitting .258 with three grand slams, and a .347 on-base rate, before being called up to the Red Sox on May 15.

On May 15, 2004, when Red Sox customary beginning third baseman Bill Mueller was set on the handicapped rundown, Youkilis was called up out of the blue. "I didn't rest much", Youkilis said. "I got around four hours of rest. ... They revealed to me the prior night I was playing... I got in there, and man, I was only amped up and energized." During his first significant class diversion in Toronto, with his folks viewing from the second column behind the burrow, Youkilis (in his second at bat) homered against 1996 Cy Young Award victor Pat Hentgen, winding up only the seventh player in group history to hit a grand slam in his first amusement. As a trick, the group at first gave Youkilis the quiet treatment when he came back to the burrow after his homer. "This one will go down most likely as the best day of my life", he said. 

Afterward, Youkilis was cleared up in the group's custom yearly initiation, in which he and different youngsters were made to wear scanty Hooters server outfits, orange glossy silk shorts and tight, clingy white tank tops, for the group trip from Canada through US Customs in Florida.

In mid-July he was sent down to AAA, nonetheless, to prepare for Ramiro Mendoza, however he was raised again towards the finish of the period. 

On September 24, which was Yom Kippur, Youkilis showed up in the hole in uniform, yet declined to take an interest in the amusement out of concession to the religious occasion. Youkilis was named the club's Rookie of the Year by the Boston part of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. For the season, in 44 recreations, he saw a normal of 4.67 pitches per plate appearance, first among real leaguers with no less than 90 plate appearances.

He was on the list for the Red Sox for the 2004 American League Division Series (ALDS), showing up in Game 2 against the Anaheim Angels. "It's been a mind blowing ride", Youkilis said. "It's an extraordinary first year, a year you most likely can't top. Ideally, it closes like a Cinderella story." He was expelled from the program for the following round, the American League Championship Series (ALCS), and was on the list yet did not play in the World Series. 

While for all intents and purposes no one else knew it, Youkilis broke his toe amid spring preparing in 2005, and was back playing again in only days. It was "in Vero Beach", Youkilis said. "I was endeavoring to make the group." 

On the Red Sox Opening Day list without precedent for his vocation in 2005, Youkilis wound up in transit down to Pawtucket on April 13 as the group expected to initiate Curt Schilling, and Youkilis happened to at present have small time choices; yet informed that he would be back, Youkilis chose to keep his Boston loft and drive to Pawtucket. Here and there all season as the Red Sox utilized his alternatives, he got a call-upÃ¢ÂÂprompted by Bill Mueller having back fits in batting practiceÃ¢ÂÂone August day as he was in Pawtucket's clubhouse before an amusement. Without changing out of a similar white jeans that he wore for both Boston and Pawtucket home recreations, he pressed his vehicle, drove the 40 miles to Boston, strolled into the Red Sox clubhouse, changed his shirt and spikes, and was prepared to play. 

He at last played 43 additional diversions for Pawtucket in 2005 preceding being called up for all time. On September 18, he broke the tip of the ring finger of his correct hand handling a ground ball, and did not play again until October 2, the last day of the ordinary season.
