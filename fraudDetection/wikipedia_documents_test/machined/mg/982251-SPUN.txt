It was the second scene of the arrangement to demonstrate the Simpson family's life later on, following the season six scene "Lisa's Wedding" that disclosed five years sooner in 1995.

As indicated by Greaney, the illustrators initially planned future Bart as "cool and fun" and made a few structures where he was "thin, alluring, and hip." Greaney did not think any about these structures obliged the identity he and the other the essayists had alloted to future Bart, so he advised the artists to draw the character with tummy fat, a pig tail, hangs under his eyes, and one hoop. Scully said on the sound critique that he thought the structure of Bart looked "extraordinary", however he included that it was "marginally irritating" to see the more seasoned variants of Homer and Marge in the scene, and kidded that it is "somewhat tragic to watch animation characters age." 

Greaney required a setpiece for the scene that empowered him to get into a dream of the characters later on, and "The Simpsons" author George Meyer thought of the possibility of the Indian club. Whenever Homer and Bart initially enter the gambling club, Homer discloses to Bart that "In spite of the fact that they appear to be unusual to us, we should regard the methods for the Indian." He continues to welcome everybody in the club by saying "Greetings how-are-you?" in the cadence of a clichÃ© Native American serenade. This joke was pitched by Tom Gammill, and there was a discussion among the staff of the show about whether to incorporate it in the scene as Native Americans could think that its hostile.

While checking on the eleventh period of "The Simpsons", DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson remarked on "Bart to the Future", expressing: "This sort of imagination scene can be all in or all out, and that pattern remains constant here. Be that as it may, a greater amount of 'Future' prevails than lemon. In spite of the fact that a couple of stiflers bomb, the vast majority of them demonstrate truly great. At no time does this become a work of art, however it entertains a significant part of the time." Hayden Childs of "The A.V. Club" wrote in 2011 that the scene "was not all that great, albeit superior to anything a significant number of the genuine stinkers yet to come by then. In any case, it completely neglected to meet people's high expectations of 'LisaÃ¢ÂÂs Wedding.'" 

In a 2003 article, journalists of "Diversion Weekly" recorded "Bart to the Future" as the most exceedingly awful "Simpsons" scene ever. They explained that "Picking the lamest "Simpsons" scene resembles picking the delegated portion of "Shasta McNasty" Ã¢ÂÂ it's everything relative. So while 'Bart to the Future' was likely superior to whatever else on TV the week it initially publicized, even Mojo the monkey could've slammed out an increasingly creative content [...] Plus, the entire investigating the-future reason is simply remembering past greatness, did unmistakably more effectively in 1995's 'Lisa's Wedding.'" Also in 2003, Ben Rayner of "Toronto Star" alluded to "Bart to the Future" as "a faltering 2000 trip" and noticed that "Diversion Weekly" "properly named [it] the 'most exceedingly terrible scene ever'".

Slaughtering off Maude was a wrongdoing aggravated by the Bart to the Future scene [...]". 

In his 2006 book "Viewing with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality", Jonathan Gray broke down the numerous commercial farces highlighted in "The Simpsons". He remarked on "Bart to the Future", stating: "As though promotions in youngsters' toys or in places of worship are insufficient, in 'Bart to the Future,' a scene in which an Indian shaman at a club get Bart a dream of his future, even his vision is hindered when future-Bart says, 'I surmise I am a humiliation,' and an apparition reacts, 'You beyond any doubt are. In any case, hello, there's a humiliation "of wealth" at the Caesar's Pow-Wow Indian Casino. You can wager on it!' Here [...] "The Simpsons" utilizes spoof with incredible impact, not exclusively to represent how annoyingly and insolently promotions encroach on any region, yet additionally to taunt their rationale and talk." 

The scene makes reference to that land magnate Donald Trump progressed toward becoming president, and caused a spending emergency that Lisa acquires. In 2015, news media refered to the scene as a foretelling of Trump's future keep running for president; the scene was delivered amid Trump's 2000 outsider run. Dan Greaney told "The Hollywood Reporter" in a 2016 meeting that the possibility of a Trump administration at the time "just appeared the coherent last stop before winding up in a sorry situation.
