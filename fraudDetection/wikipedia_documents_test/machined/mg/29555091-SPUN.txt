New Directions and the Warblers tie for the lead position, which implies that the two gatherings will progress to the Regionals rivalry. 

Emma reveals to Will that she wedded Carl in Las Vegas, and in spite of his stun, Will says he is upbeat for her.

"Specialized curriculum" got blended audits from TV commentators. The most excited analysts were from "The Atlantic", where both Kevin Fallon and Patrick Burns proclaimed it the "best scene of "Merriment" all season", and Meghan Brown recommended that the show should "simply do rivalry scenes starting now and into the foreseeable future". Aly Semigran of "MTV" was correspondingly commendatory, and said that the show was "back in top structure"; she included that the scene "felt reminiscent of the enchantment the primary season gave". 

Others were progressively tempered in their acclaim. James Poniewozik of "Time" said the scene was "grounded" and "strong if-not-marvelous", and featured how "Joy" "has formed into an expansive troupe, where any of a few characters is fit for taking the spotlight, even an initially lighthearted element character like Brittany." Todd VanDerWerff of "The A.V. Club" and the "Houston Chronicle" Bobby Hankinson both loved the episodeÃ¢ÂÂVanDerWerff gave it a "B+"Ã¢ÂÂbut they, similar to Erica Futterman of "Moving Stone" who was less complimentary, were frustrated that it neglected to measure up to the last time New Directions contended in Sectionals. VanDerWerff expressed, "When the show [Ã¢ÂÅ] stays, at some dimension, a show about a bundle of children who simply love to sing and move and possibly have wacky undertakings as an afterthought, it remains in a general sense solid, as it does today." He additionally expressed, "The way that the Warblers and New Directions tied, while presumably vital for reasons unknown, is absurdly paltry and keeps this scene from an A-basically without any help." 

Amy Reiter of the "Los Angeles Times" was disillusioned with nearly everything, and said the scene "felt increasingly like a long, moderate disappointment after a period of joyous highs". She included, "New Directions' sectionals execution was anything but a complete bungle, yet it wasn't the touchdown you might've sought after either", and of the hotly anticipated chance to see different individuals highlighted in rivalry: "the foreseen sparkling minute ended up being so dull." Reiter was one of a not many pundits to take note of the nonattendance of cheerleading mentor Sue Sylvester in the scene, and just when she bemoaned the "relative absence of amusingness". Futterman simply commented on Sue's non-appearance in passing; she reached the determination that "we got a spazzy, unfocused hour to the detriment of passionate venture", and however Anthony Benigno of the "Day by day News" complimented the "strong acting", he additionally composed that "this is the first run through the show's begun to feel really exhausting rather than, you know, happy." He made a general grievance too: "This show is beginning to experience the ill effects of making the music auxiliary to the plot." Robert Canning of "IGN" gave the scene a 7.5 out of 10 rating. He said that the show "endeavored to make everything work, and keeping in mind that the hour was sufficiently pleasant, every storyline felt only somewhat short of going from great to extraordinary." 

A couple of commentators commented on how the Hipsters appeared to be an impression of the New Directions team in fifty years, with Futterman getting into points of interest: "We see future Rachel begin the number with a stick and future Mercedes get through to complete the melody off with a riff, and it's hard not to be charmed to them." Poniewozik composed that Rachel's "quiet suggestion to Kurt to bless stage was an ideal, sweet little minute", a slant shared by Tim Stack of "Diversion Weekly". Poniewozik likewise noticed that "Lea Michele had a portion of her most grounded non-singing snapshots of the period by appearing exactly how Rachel managed her issues with Finn yet with being on the fringe of the gathering." The storyline that included the breaking down of the RachelÃ¢ÂÂFinn relationship, when remarked on by any means, was seen horribly; VanDerWerff considered it an "inept turn". 

Darker adulated the expansion of Fink as Lauren to New Directions, and announced, "I trust she's in the group for the long haul", while Poniewozik was satisfied that "the scene utilized Lauren for satire without just making her the object of jokes". Darker likewise stated, "Kurt's bend was subtler this week, and along these lines around multiple times all the more fascinating. I [Ã¢ÂÅ] am awed that "Merriment" dealing with his acclimation to Dalton so honestly." Canning was comparably awed, and called Kurt at Dalton "the most strong story" of the scene. There was little endorsement among analysts for the "canary in a confine" representation in the scene among Kurt and Blaine toward the finish of the scene, with Kurt the "canary" in his new Dalton confine; Hankinson described it as "super ham-fisted", and others were almost as unforgiving. 

The melodic exhibitions in this scene were generally adulated by commentators, however there was little said about the nature of the condensed execution by the Hipsters in rivalry. There was close general endorsement for the main melody heard, "Don't Cry For Me Argentina", which Stack called "absolutely delightful" and gave an "A-"; he, similar to Burns, who said it was "phenomenal", cherished having "Rachel and Kurt get an opportunity to sing together". Jen Harper of "BuddyTV" reverberated Kurt's words in the scene; she said "Rachel truly is as skilled as she is bothering", yet wished she "didn't generally resemble she's crying while she's singing", and included that she was "truly delving Kurt in a lower register". Futterman noticed that Rachel, as is regular with her "capacity melodies", "utilizes an opportunity to ponder the most recent snag to her future fame, while we see Kurt convey an unmistakable, controlled take. Benigno called Michele's voice "dumbfounding", and included that her performance exchanged "with Kurt's tryout with the Warblers, which is typically exceptional", and gave the melody a "B+". Indeed, even the individuals who loathed the tune or the author were prevailed upon by the execution: Berk gave it three stars out of five, and Burns thought it was "awesome"; both enjoyed the tune's tag-group introduction. 

The execution of Train's "Hello, Soul Sister" by the Dalton Academy Warblers got significantly more recognition than "Don't Cry For Me Argentina". Benigno called it perfect, and gave it an "A++", and Hanh Nguyen of "Zap2it" gave it her "top prize" of the night. Berk gave it four stars out of five, Burns said "the Warblers sounded fabulous and fun", and Harper said she cherished it, and that, similar to the gathering of people on the show, she "would have given it" an "overwhelming applause". Stack said he "sorta" abhorred the melody "from sheer overexposure", however "Darren Criss sold it for me with his movement and acting", and gave it a "B+". Pat Monahan, the lead artist of Train, stated: "Cherished it! I figured they worked superbly." 

The recognition was progressively lukewarm for Sam and Quinn's "(I've Had) the Time of My Life". Benigno called it "strong", however included "pointless excess thumps it down to a strong B." Both Futterman and Stack said the number "fell somewhat level", however Stack said the team had "extraordinary physical science". Fallon described it as a "charming two part harmony". Berk gave it five stars of five, his best grade for the scene, and called it "sloppy, souring flawlessness", while Reiter was the least awed, and composed that their "voices (and sentimental interchange) appeared to be wan and slight." 

The New Directions shutting number at Sectionals, "Valerie", got the most critique, with Santana's performance given excited commendation, however Brittany and Mike's moving was additionally praised. Hankinson, who had mildly called tunes "pleasant" so far, changed gears and stated, "At that point Santana torches the rooftop with a version of Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie'. It was magnificent." Raymund Flandez of "The Wall Street Journal" reverberated that enthusiasm: "However then Santana went ahead and executed. With an on-spot version of Mark Ronson/Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie,' and wearing a Snooki bun, Santana was jolting behind the mic, in an invigorating presentation that revved up the crowd", and included, "Brittany and Mike's pas de deux shook". Benigno opined that "Brittany and Mike Chang handle the moves (uncommonly well), however the vocals here are what take it. Naya Rivera (Santana) is totally remarkable on lead vocals, and I can't comprehend why she hasn't gotten a performance before this"; he gave it an "A". Stack was marginally less liberal with an "A-", and composed that it was an "incredible melody decision for Santana"; he gave "extra focuses for the marvelous Mike/Brittany movement", while Harper said that their moving "completely made the tune". Nguyen preferred the moving, however she was condemning of how the tune sounded, as she felt "it needed something and didn't generally feel deserving of the standing O", while Futterman said "Santana's cheeky vocals are an ideal reverberation of Winehouse's, yet the remainder of the melody feels somewhat like a bazaar". Reiter felt the whole melody "appeared to be somewhat attached", both the moving and Santana's performance. 

"Puppy Days Are Over" was the main tune of a few analysts, including Hankinson, who said "it was the precise brand of high-vitality celebration that I adore the most." Harper was additionally excited: "This execution for me speaks to what I like about New DirectionsÃ¢ÂÂand why Kurt needs to return asap. Everybody got the opportunity to do their very own individual thing, yet despite everything they work actually well as a gathering. I give it best tune of the night." In Semigran's view, "From the charming arranged applauds to the whimsical (yet strangely fitting) decision to have Tina and Mercedes sing the tune, I wish they'd spare this one for regionals. It was a victor", while VanDerWerff composed, " 'Puppy Days Are Over' is directly in this present show's wheelhouse, along these lines, normally, it hits the melody out of the recreation center." Benigno gave the tune a "B+", and Berk granted three stars out of five, while Stack gave it "An", and said arrangement maker Ryan Murphy "picked the ideal ladies to pull off this spread." 

Five of the seven spread variants discharged as singles appeared on the "Announcement" Hot 100, and showed up on other melodic outlines. The show's interpretation of "Pooch Days Are Over" appeared at number twenty-two on both the Hot 100 and Canadian Hot 100, and drove the first form of the melody by Florence and the Machine in front of it to number twenty-one on the Hot 100, up from number fifty-eight in the earlier week.
