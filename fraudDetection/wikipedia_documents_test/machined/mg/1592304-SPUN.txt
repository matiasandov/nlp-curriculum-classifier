California State Route 243 

State Route 243 (SR 243), or the Banning-Idyllwild Panoramic Highway, is a 30-mile (50 kilometer) two-path parkway that keeps running from Banning, California (in the north) to Idyllwild, California (in the south) in Riverside County, California. The roadway is a connector between Interstate 10 (I-10) and SR 74. Along its course, it gives access to the San Bernardino National Forest. A street from Banning to Idyllwild was arranged around the turn of the twentieth century, and was open by 1910. The street was added to the state thruway framework in 1970. 

SR 243 starts at SR 74 in the San Jacinto Wilderness close Mountain Center, Riverside County as Idyllwild Road. The thruway crosses north along a twisting street through the network of Idyllwild. SR 243 makes a left turn at the convergence with Circle Drive and proceeds through Pine Cove. The street proceeds through the timberland past Mount San Jacinto State Park through Twin Pines and the Morongo Indian Reservation before making a couple curves and slipping on the way to the city of Banning as the Banning Idyllwild Panoramic Highway. The thruway proceeds as San Gorgonio Avenue into the city before making a left onto Lincoln Street and a privilege onto eighth Street and ending at a precious stone exchange with I-10. 

SR 243 is a piece of the National Highway System, a system of expressways that are viewed as fundamental to the nation's economy, barrier, and versatility by the Federal Highway Administration. SRÃÂ 243 is qualified for the State Scenic Highway System, and is authoritatively assigned as a grand expressway by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), implying that it is a considerable segment of thruway going through an "important scene" with no "visual interruptions", where the potential assignment has increased prominent support with the network. In 2007, it was named the Esperanza Firefighters Memorial Highway to pay tribute to five firemen who kicked the bucket while battling the Esperanza Fire in October 2006. In 2013, SRÃÂ 243 had a yearly normal every day traffic (AADT) of 1,650 between Marion Ridge Drive in Idyllwild and San Gorgonio Avenue in Banning, and 6,500 at the northern end in Banning, the last of which was the most astounding AADT for the parkway. 

A street from Banning to Idyllwild was under development in 1904, and of the street was open by August, with an extra of the street arranged. Another were authorized in 1908. The oiled street was finished by September 1910, and gave a perspective on Lake Elsinore and the Colorado Desert, and it was relied upon to help with transporting wood and halting flames; along these lines, the government gave $2,000 to the development. The street turned into a piece of the woods thruway framework in 1927. 

Another "high-gear" street from Banning to Idyllwild was in progress by 1935, and after two years, the "Los Angeles Times" believed the street to be "high-gear". Endeavors to clear the street were in progress in 1950. The street from Banning through Idyllwild to SR 74 was known as County Route R1 (CR R1) by 1966. By 1969, plans were set up to add the Banning to Idyllwild to Mountain Center street as a state parkway; prior, State Senator Nelson Dilworth proposed enactment to require the street to be added to the state expressway framework if SR 195 was expelled, as the two were of generally a similar length, however the last stayed in the framework. SR 243 was added to the state roadway framework in 1970. The Division of Highways recommended erasing the parkway in 1971. In 1998, Caltrans had no designs to improve the course through 2015.
