Schiavo was Inspector General of the United States Department of Transportation for a long time, and surrendered in 1996 soon after the ValuJet Flight 592 carrier crash in the Florida Everglades. She turned into an informant and was very condemning of the aircraft business and its association with flying security offices in the United States government.

Most audits of the book in media productions were sure. A few people inside the carrier business asserted the book contained real errors, and this was researched as a major aspect of a class venture at George Washington University. 

Mary Schiavo was brought up in Williams County, Ohio, and got her pilot's permit while concentrating in her initial two years of school at Ohio State University (OSU). She acquired a four year certification from Harvard University, and a graduate degree in open organization from OSU.

Schiavo left her situation at the U.S. Branch of Transportation so as to blow the whistle on what she saw as lacks in security rehearses by the central government's oversight of the carrier business. She was openly condemning of high-positioning U.S. aeronautics authorities with respect to the ValuJet Flight 592 traveler stream crash in the Florida Everglades which brought about the passings of each of the 110 individuals on board. Schiavo showed up on ABC's "Nightline" program the night after the accident and was exceptionally disparaging of FAA wellbeing examinations techniques.

The book is an exposÄÅ¡ of what Schiavo saw as extortion, debasement, waste, botch, and risky carelessness in the flying business and the FAA as a crusader for flight security. Her essential reactions in the book center around the FAA's hesitance to address its numerous deficiencies, while communicating her worry that there was a major irreconcilable circumstance between the FAA occupation of oversight and the FAA employment of advancing avionics. 

Schiavo portrays how the FAA utilizes an equation crediting explicit money related an incentive to human lives, and how the office enables numbers to choose whether the expense of additional security merits the extra cost. For instance, if furnishing a carrier armada with smoke identifiers would cost $100 million, however would just spare 10 experience every value $1 million, at that point the cost is precluded. Schiavo is correspondingly disparaging of the inward FAA governmental issues and the FAA's chairmen. 

The last 145 pages of the book is routed to travelers, to enable them to figure out which aircrafts have great wellbeing records and how to all the more likely guarantee safe travel while flying. Schiavo talks about the normal times of certain aircraft armadas, uncovers the mishap rates of the real carrier bearers, security evaluations at national carriers, bomb identification rates at U.S. airplane terminals, and gives a rundown of air terminals where control disappointments have influenced the adequacy of control towers. She finishes up with a rundown of proposals for how people can impact change at government organizations including the FAA, and how to address worries of irreconcilable situation between air security and review and the carrier business.

Christina Del Valle explored the book for "BusinessWeek", and expressed: "Flying Blind, Flying Safe is a sharp introduction on what troubles the avionics business and its feds' guideline". A consequent article in "BusinessWeek" featured the book among "The Best Business Books of 1997". In an audit in "The Washington Post", Judy Mann called the book "a scorching - and startling - arraignment of the FAA, the multibillion-dollar aircraft industry and its lapdogs in Congress". James T. Yenckel of "The Washington Post" called the book "terrifying" and "instructive", and composed that "travelers ought to have this sort of wellbeing data while picking a flight." In a survey for "The Virginian-Pilot", Michael Anft expressed: "She might be to the plane what Ralph Nader was to the car." Bill Wallace gave the book a good audit in the "San Francisco Chronicle", and stated: "Part journal, part uncover, her book gives an inside perspective on how the FAA carries out its responsibility of directing air travel - and how it as often as possible comes up short." R.J. Ignelzi gave the book a positive proposal in a survey for "The San Diego Union-Tribune", and remarked: "Mary Schiavo's real assessment of the Federal Aviation Administration, air terminal security and air traffic controllers will give even the incidental flier some misgiving. In any case, it ought to be perused." 

Carl Marbach of "AVweb" composed emphatically of the main bit of the book, however was condemning of the last half: "all in all, the book has some beneficial segments despite the cleanser musical drama ramblings toward the end. Peruse the principal half, at that point pass it along to another pilot-companion." John Clark of "The Plain Dealer" gave the book a positive audit, but on the other hand was disparaging of the enlightening segment toward the finish of the book: "Narratively, the book separates when Schiavo resorts to records and tables to give data to enable the peruser to fly all the more securely." Robert W. Poole Jr. evaluated the book for "Reason", and called it "significant and disappointing". Poole noted "Just an untouchable insider like Schiavo could furnish standard individuals with genuine records of how seriously off-track the FAA has landed in its position of caring for flight security," yet remarked that some avionics veterans viewed her as an "unstable presence". Jerry Fraser of "The Boston Globe" was basic in his audit of the book, and composed that "a book that embarks to be 'all that you have to know to travel more secure via air' ends up fussing about how the FAA repays representatives for moving costs and directs rough administration preparing classes". The book got a basic survey from Bill Adair in the "St. Petersburg Times", who expressed: "Schiavo is directly about numerous issues at the FAA. ... In any case, Schiavo appears to be unfit to offer a quiet and productive record of the FAA's issues. She'd preferably snatch features with wild and frequently mistaken remarks." 

Numerous in the carrier business were disparaging of the book, and attested that it contained verifiable mistakes. In 1998, Instructor Darryl Jenkins of George Washington University chose to allocate a class venture in an alumni course he was instructing on aircraft financial matters for understudies to actuality check articulations made by Schiavo in the book. Edmund Pinto, a previous Federal Aviation Administration representative and distributer of the bulletin "Flying Daily", later co-created a report with Jenkins on their discoveries. In certain occasions the creators concurred with Schiavo's decisions, however contended that what they saw as disparities reduced Schiavo's position. Accordingly Schiavo remarked that the report by Jenkins and Pinto was "not really the kind of unprejudiced revealing which warrants my reaction", and an article on the issue in "The Washington Post" noticed that: "Jenkins periodically does monetary counseling work for carriers and for aircraft associations, yet he said he took on the book venture without anyone else."
