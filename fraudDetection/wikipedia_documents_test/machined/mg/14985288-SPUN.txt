In a meeting on Canada AM, Adams said the title "11" was picked on the grounds that it was his eleventh studio collection, when soundtrack collection "" is incorporated. Likewise, Adams referenced there was no shrouded significance behind the title, it was his eleventh studio discharge and contained eleven tracks, "there are no auxiliary implications" as Adams later referenced in a meeting with the BBC. The collection's spread was taken amid a photograph shoot in an inn in Switzerland, while Adams was completing a self-photograph story for an Italian men's magazine. Adams wound up enjoying the photograph so much that he wound up utilizing it as the collection's spread 

Similarly as with the past collection, "Room Service", critical segments of the collection were created while on visit. As per co-essayist Jim Vallance current innovation and hardware made it much simpler to record the collection. Adams recorded the collection while on visit, utilizing the time between playing in front of an audience and preparing himself for the following gig. Vallance and Adams recorded the collection regularly while sitting behind the stage or in a lodging with little gadgets which they as a rule conveyed along on visits, however particularly amid their off days. Adams, in a meeting, referenced that when recording a tune, they expected to set up sleeping cushions against the windows, and having amplifiers gone through the can. 

"11" was initially going to be an acoustic record, going for the "delicate hard methodology" culminated by the British shake gathering, The Who. Be that as it may, after a long visit, a portion of the acoustic melodies began developing on him, which prompted changes. Adams would record for a couple of hours, until he wheeled the entire chronicle pack back in front of an audience. "It makes me somewhat more keen on going on visit," he said all things considered. Adams who was never completely dedicated to making an undeniable acoustic collection, chose not to in the wake of seeing an acoustic band opening for him amid one of his shows. What he saw made him sure that he was not ready to make such a collection. 

At the point when the composition season for "11" had finished, Adams and his sidekicks had composed 30 melodies. After a determination procedure, 19 of these melodies were expelled, anyway some of them made it to the exclusive version discharged later in 2008. The primary single, "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" was written in 2007, and experienced a few changes before Adams made the completing contacts. Initially, it had another title, and an alternate tune, and as Adams later placed it; "over the span of tuning in to the music and investing energy with it, you do finish up evolving it. 

Adams hadn't cooperated on a collection with Vallance since the late-1980s. They collaborated after, as Adams stated, "tossing thoughts forward and backward" from 2003 until the collection was discharged. Vallance would send MP3 sound documents by email to Adams amid the chronicle seasons. Adams would then add a few components to them and send them back. They kept doing this until a melody was finished; Vallance asserted it took more time for them to compose tunes than amid their past coordinated efforts, yet felt the final result was similarly as great. 

The primary subjects in the collection, in Adams words are; "hunting down something". The expressive importance behind track number four, "Oxygen" is the thing that an individual needs so as to endure. At the end of the day, "The individual you are with is giving you the air you inhale", and that individuals by and large "need each other 100%."

"Something to Believe In" depends on the certification of life and confidence, while "Stroll on By" cautions the audience of skepticism. Similarly as with different collections, as per Adams, he gets a kick out of the chance to end the collection with a melancholic tune, for example, "Something to Believe In" in "11", it's not the last track be that as it may. "Blooms Gone Wild" addresses a similar topic as two tunes he wrote in the mid 1980s, "Model" and "The Best Is Yet To Come", depend on the killed playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. Yet in addition individuals with lost feelings and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forward by the media, which Adams says, drives individuals to lose their "feeling of conventionality".
