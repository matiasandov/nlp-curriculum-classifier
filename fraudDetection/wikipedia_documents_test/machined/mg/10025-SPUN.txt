The European Flag or Flag of Europe is an official image of two separate universal associations, the Council of Europe (CoE) and the European Union (EU). It comprises of a hover of twelve five-pointed yellow ("or") stars on a blue ("purplish blue") field. 

The banner was structured in 1955, and authoritatively propelled soon thereafter by the Council of Europe as an image for the entire of Europe. The Council of Europe asked it to be received by other European associations, and in 1985 the European Communities (EC) embraced it. 

The EU acquired the banner's utilization when it was shaped in 1993, being the successor association to the EC beginning from 1 December 2009 (date of passage into power of the Lisbon Treaty). It has been in wide authority use by the EC since the 1990s, however it has never been given authority status in any of the EU's arrangements. Its selection as an official image of the EU was arranged as a feature of the proposed 2004 European Constitution, which neglected to be sanctioned in 2005. Then again, it is now and again called the "Banner of the European Union" while speaking to the EU. 

Since its selection by the European Union, it has turned out to be extensively connected with the supranational association, because of its prominent and substantial utilization of the token. It has likewise been utilized by professional EU protestors in the shading transformations of the 2000s, e.g., in Belarus (2004) or Moldova. 

The graphical determinations given by the EU in 1996 portray the structure as: "On a sky blue field a hover of twelve brilliant mullets, their focuses not contacting." 

As indicated by graphical details distributed online by the Council of Europe in 2004, the banner is rectangular with 2:3 extents: its fly (width) is one and a half times the length of its crane (stature). Twelve yellow stars are focused around (the range of which is 33% of the length of the crane) upon a blue foundation. Every one of the stars are upstanding (one point straight up), have five and are divided similarly, similar to the hour positions on the essence of a clock. The breadth of each star is equivalent to one-ninth of the tallness of the crane. 

The hues are controlled in the 1996 guide by the EC, and equally in the 2004 guide by the Council of Europe. The base shade of the banner is characterized as Pantone "Reflex Blue", while the brilliant stars are depicted in Pantone "Yellow": 

The 2013 logo of the Council of Europe has the hues: 

The Council of Europe gave the 1955 banner a representative depiction in the accompanying terms: 

The authority emblematic portrayal received by the EU overlooks the reference toward the "Western world". 

The quantity of stars on the banner is fixed at twelve, speaking to "flawlessness and fulfillment" (in the first ). It isn't identified with the quantity of part conditions of the EU (despite the fact that the EU happened to have 12 part states at the season of Maastricht Treaty). 

Other emblematic translations have been offered dependent on the record of its plan by Paul M. Duty. The five-pointed star is utilized on numerous national banners and speaks to goal and training. Their brilliant shading is that of the sun, which is said to symbolize greatness and edification. 

Their game plan around speaks to the group of stars of Corona Borealis and can be viewed as a crown and the strength of government. The blue foundation looks like the sky and symbolizes truth and the keenness. It is additionally the shading customarily used to speak to the Virgin Mary. In numerous artistic creations of the Virgin Mary as Stella Maris she is delegated with a hover of stars. 

The twelve-star "banner of Europe" was structured in 1950 and authoritatively embraced by the Council of Europe in 1955. A similar banner was received by the European Parliament in 1983. The European Council embraced it was a "symbol" for the European Communities in 1985. Its status in the European Communities was acquired by the European Union upon its arrangement in 1993. The proposition to embrace it as official banner of the European Union fizzled with the sanction of the European Constitution in 2005, and notice of all seals recommending statehood was expelled from the Treaty of Lisbon of 2007, albeit sixteen part states marked an announcement supporting the proceeded with utilization of the banner. In 2007, the European Parliament authoritatively received the banner for its very own utilization. 

Preceding improvement of political foundations, banners speaking to Europe were constrained to unification developments. The most prevalent were the European Movement's substantial green 'E' on a white foundation, and the "Skillet European banner" of the Paneuropean Union (1922). 

The Council of Europe in 1950 delegated a board to ponder the subject of receiving an image. 

Various recommendations were investigated. 

Among the fruitless recommendations was the banner of Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi's International Paneuropean Union, which he had himself as of late received for the European Parliamentary Union. 

The plan was a blue field with a red cross inside an orange hover at the middle. 

Kalergi was exceptionally dedicated to protecting the cross 

as "the incredible image of Europe's ethical solidarity", the red cross specifically being "perceived by the entire world, by Christian and non-Christian nations[,] as an image of universal philanthropy and of the fraternity of man", however the proposition was dismissed by Turkey (an individual from the Council of Europe since 1949) on grounds of its 

religious relationship despite Kalergi's proposal of including a bow close by the cross to beat the Muslim protests. 

Different proposition incorporated the banner was the European Movement, which had an expansive green E on a white foundation, 

a structure depended on the Olympic rings, eight silver rings on a blue foundation, dismissed because of the rings' comparability with "dial", "chain" and "zeros", or an expansive yellow star on a blue foundation, dismissed because of its closeness with the supposed Burnet banner and the banner of the Belgian Congo. 

The Consultative Assembly limited their decision to two plans. One was by Salvador de Madariaga, the originator of the College of Europe, who recommended a group of stars of stars on a blue foundation (situated by capital urban communities, with a substantial star for Strasbourg, the seat of the Council). He had coursed his banner round numerous European capitals and the idea had discovered support. 

The second was a variation by ArsÄÂ¨ne Heitz, who worked for the Council's postal administration and had submitted many plans; the structure of his that was acknowledged by the Assembly was like Salvador de Madariaga's, yet rather than a group of stars, the stars were organized around. 

In 1987, Heitz would guarantee that his motivation had been the crown of twelve stars of the Woman of the Apocalypse, regularly found in Marian iconography (see beneath). 

On 25 September 1953, the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe prescribed that a blue banner with fifteen gold stars be received as a token for the association, the number fifteen mirroring the quantity of conditions of the Council of Europe. West Germany protested the fifteen-star structure, as one of the individuals was Saar Protectorate, and to have its very own star would suggest power for the locale. The Committee of Ministers (the Council's principle basic leadership body) concurred with the Assembly that the banner ought to be a hover of stars, however decided on a fixed number of twelve stars, "speaking to flawlessness and aggregate". The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 25 October 1955 consented to this. Paul M. G. LÄÅ¡vy drew up the definite plan of the new banner. Authoritatively received on 8 December 1955, the banner was revealed at the ChÄËteau de la Muette in Paris on 13 December 1955. 

Following Expo 58 in Brussels, the banner got on and the Council of Europe campaigned for other European associations to embrace the banner as an indication of European solidarity. 

The European Parliament stepped up to the plate in looking for a banner to be embraced by the European Communities. Soon after the primary direct decisions in 1979 a draft goals was advanced on the issue. The goals recommended that the Communities' banner ought to be that of the Council of Europe and it was embraced by the Parliament on 11 April 1983. 

The European Parliament utilized its own banner from 1973, however never formally embraced it. It dropped out of utilization with the reception of the twelve-star banner by the Parliament in 1983. The banner pursued the yellow and blue shading plan anyway rather than twelve stars there were the letters EP and PE (initials of the European Parliament in the six network dialects at the time) encompassed by a wreath. 

The June 1984 European Council (the Communities' chiefs) summit in Fontainebleau focused on the significance of advancing an European picture and personality to residents and the world. The European Council selected a "specially appointed" board of trustees, named "Advisory group for 'a People's Europe'" (Adonnino Committee). 

This panel presented a significant report, including wide-extending recommendations, from sorting out an "European lottery" to battling for the presentation of neighborhood casting a ballot rights for remote nationals all through Europe. Under the header of "fortifying of the Community's picture and character", the Committee proposed the presentation of "a banner and a symbol", prescribing a structure dependent on the Council of Europe banner, yet with the expansion of "a gold letter E" in the focal point of the hover of stars. The European Council held in Milan on 28/29 June 1985 to a great extent pursued the suggestions of the Adonnino Committee. Be that as it may, as the appropriation of a banner was unequivocally reminiscent of a national banner speaking to statehood, was amazingly disputable with some part states (specifically the United Kingdom), the Council of Europe's "banner of Europe" structure was embraced just with the status of a "logo". The trade off was broadly neglected from the earliest starting point, and the "European logo" notwithstanding the express shirking of giving it the status of a "banner" was alluded to as "Network banner" or even "European banner" from the beginning. 

The Communities started to utilize the "image" as its "true" banner from 1986, with it being raised outside the Berlaymont building (the seat of the European Commission) out of the blue on 29 May 1986. 

The European Union, which was set up by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 to supplant the European Communities and incorporate its capacities, has held "accepted" utilization of the "Network logo" of the EC. In fact and authoritatively, the "European banner" as utilized by the European Union remains not a "banner" however "a Community 'logo' Ã¢ÂÂ or 'image' Ã¢ÂÂ [...] qualified to be duplicated on rectangular bits of texture". 

In 1997, the "Focal and Eastern Eurobarometer" survey incorporated a segment aiming to "find the dimension of open familiarity with the European Union" in what were then hopeful nations in Central and Eastern Europe. Interviewees were indicated "a sticker of the European banner" and requested to recognize it. Reactions considered right were: the European Union, the European Community, the Common Market, and "Europe when all is said in done". 52% of those talked with gave one of the right answers, 15% gave a wrong answer (naming another establishment, for example, NATO or the United Nations), and 35% could or would not distinguish it. 

In 2002, Dutch designer Rem Koolhaas structured another banner, named the "standardized identification", as it showed the shades of the national banners of the EU part states in vertical stripes. It was never formally embraced by the EU or any association, however it was utilized as the logo of the Austrian EU Presidency in 2006. 

The official status of the seal as the banner of the European Union was to be formalized as a feature of the Constitution of the European Union. In any case, as the proposed constitution fizzled sanction, the notice of all state-like symbols, including the banner, were expelled from the substitution Treaty of Lisbon of 2007. 

Rather, a different revelation by sixteen Member States was incorporated into the last demonstration of the Treaty of Lisbon expressing that the banner, the song of praise, the witticism and the money and Europe Day "will for them proceed as images to express the feeling of network of the general population in the European Union and their faithfulness to it." 

In response to the expulsion of the banner from the settlement, the European Parliament, which had bolstered the consideration of such images, supported a proposition to utilize these images "all the more frequently" for the benefit of the Parliament itself; Jo Leinen, MEP for Germany, recommended that the Parliament should take "a "cutting edge" job" in their utilization. 

In September 2008, the Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposed a formal change in the foundation's principles of methodology to make "better utilization of the images". In particular, the banner would be available in all gathering rooms (not simply the hemicycle) and at all official occasions. The proposition was passed on 8 October 2008 by 503 votes to 96 (15 abstentions). 

In 2015, a lot of dedicatory Euro coin was issued on the event of the 30th commemoration of the appropriation of the insignia by the European Communities.

In Belarus, it was utilized on dissent walks nearby the prohibited previous national banner and banners of restriction developments amid the challenges of 2004Ã¢ÂÂ2006. The banner was utilized generally in a 2007 star EU walk in Minsk. Comparable utilizations were accounted for from Moldova. 

In Georgia, the banner was on most government structures since the coming to intensity of Mikhail Saakashvili (2007), who utilized it amid his introduction, expressing: "[the European] banner is Georgia's banner also, to the extent it encapsulates our civilisation, our way of life, the substance of our history and point of view, and our vision for the fate of Georgia." 

It was utilized in 2008 by master western Serbian voters in front of a decision.

against the "Jyllands-Posten Muhammad" kid's shows, the Danish banner was most as often as possible consumed, however (as the kid's shows were republished in numerous European nations), a few nonconformists settled on consuming "the EU banner."

By the 2010s, the relationship of the token with the EU had turned out to be strong to the point that the Council of Europe saw it important to structure another logo, to "maintain a strategic distance from disarray", formally embraced in 2013. 

In 1987, after the appropriation of the banner by the EC, ArsÄÂ¨ne Heitz (1908Ã¢ÂÂ1989), one of the originators who had submitted recommendations for the banner's plan, proposed a religious motivation for it. He guaranteed that the hover of stars depended on the iconographic convention of appearing Blessed Virgin Mary as the Woman of the Apocalypse, wearing a "crown of twelve stars". The French ironical magazine "Le Canard enchaÄÅ¾nÄÅ¡" responded to Heitz's announcement with an article entitled "LÃ¢ÂÂEurope violÄÅ¡e standard la Sainte Vierge" ("Europe Raped by the Blessed Virgin") in the version of 20 December 1989.

In a meeting given 26 February 1998, LÄÅ¡vy precluded mindfulness from claiming the "Marian" association, yet in addition denied that the last plan of a hover of twelve stars was Heitz's. To the inquiry "Who truly planned the banner?" LÄÅ¡vy answered: 

Carlo Curti Gialdino (2005) has reproduced the plan procedure such that Heitz's proposition contained fluctuating quantities of stars, from which the rendition with twelve stars was picked by the Committee of Ministers meeting at Deputy level in January 1955 as one out of two outstanding applicant structures. 

LÄÅ¡vy's 1998 meeting clearly offered ascend to another variation of the "Marian" story. An article distributed in "" in August 1998 affirmed that it was LÄÅ¡vy himself who was propelled to present a "Marian" component as he strolled past a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 

An article posted in "La Raison" in February 2000 further associated the gift of a recolored glass window for Strasbourg Cathedral by the Council of Europe on 21 October 1956.
