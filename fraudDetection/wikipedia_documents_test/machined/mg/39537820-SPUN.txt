Xue Susu 

Xue Susu (; otherwise called Xue Wu, Xuesu, Sunjung among other nom de plumes) (1564Ã¢ÂÂ1650? C.E.) was a Chinese concubine. Known as one of the "Eight Great Courtesans of the Ming Dynasty", she was a practiced painter and artist, and was noted for her ability at mounted arrow based weaponry. She was especially noted for her figure artistic creations, which included numerous Buddhist subjects. Her works are held in various exhibition halls both in China and somewhere else. Her arrow based weaponry was remarked upon by various contemporary journalists, just like her manly, military inclinations; these were viewed as an appealing element by the literati of the period. 

She lived in Eastern China, dwelling for the greater part of her life in the Zhejiang and Jiangsu locale. After a profession as a commended prostitute in Nanjing, Xue wedded a few times, however none of these associations kept going. Amid her later life, she in the long run picked the life of a Buddhist loner. 

Xue was conceived in either Suzhou or Jiaxing (contemporary sources oppose this idea). As indicated by the student of history Qian Qianyi she spent probably a portion of her adolescence in Beijing. She went through her expert time on earth in the Qinhuai delight quarter of Nanjing during the 1580s, where she moved toward becoming something of a big name among the literati and government authorities who frequented the "blossom houses" there. She was very particular in her customer base, tolerating just learned and insightful men as her sweethearts and declining to proffer her affections for insignificant monetary benefit; suitors may burn through a huge number of taels on her without much of any result. 

During the 1590s she came back to Beijing, where the gatherings and artistic social affairs that she facilitated, just as her bows and arrows exhibitions, further solidified her notoriety. Xue alluded to herself as "a female knight-errant", and took her name from a well known lady warrior from history; she additionally picked the sobriquet Wulang Ã¤ÅÂÃ©ÂÂ ("fifth youthful noble man") as a moniker. The "female knight-errant" designation was repeated by both the book lover Hu Yinglin and Fan Yulin, Secretary to the Ministry of War. Obviously partial to military causes, she was not above utilizing her situation to impact military undertakings, on one event deserting her darling Yuan Baode when he would not subsidize an endeavor against the Japanese in Korea. 

Sooner or later after 1605 her profession as a mistress arrived at an end when she wedded the writer and civil servant Shen Defu. She was hitched a few times (making a large number of the recommendations herself) however none of these associations kept going. Just as Shen Defu, her spouses included General Li Hualong, workmanship faultfinder Li Rihua and, in later life, an anonymous (yet well off) trader from Suzhou. In spite of the fact that she needed kids, she was never ready to have any. 

In later life she changed over to Buddhism and stayed single from there on, to a great extent resigning from the world. Indeed, even in her eighties, in any case, she was as yet dynamic in the abstract world, engaging female specialists, for example, Huang Yuanjie and Yi Lin at her home on the West Lake after the breakdown of the Ming Dynasty. With her Buddhist companion Yang Jiangzi (the sister of Xue's kindred mistress Liu Yin), she made journeys to sacrosanct destinations, for example, Mount Lu and Mount Emei. The date of her passing is dubious; a few sources propose that she may have lived into the 1650s while others put her demise in the late 1630s or mid 1640s. Qian Qianyi makes reference to her demise in a work distributed in 1652, so it is obvious that she should have kicked the bucket before this date. 

As of now a practiced painter in her adolescent years, Xue was notable for her aesthetic ability. Her work was viewed as like that of Chen Chun. One of her compositions was considered "the most practiced work of its sort in the entire of the Ming time frame", and contemporary craftsmanship faultfinders viewed her as "an ace of system". Hu Yinglin believed her to be at the zenith of contemporary painting, asking, "What celebrated painter with gifted hands can outperform her?" and guaranteeing that "... [she] outperforms anybody in the artwork of bamboo and orchids." She was additionally definitely respected by prominent painter and workmanship pundit Dong Qichang, who was roused to duplicate the whole Heart Sutra in light of Xue's composition of the bodhisattva Guanyin; he guaranteed that "None [of Xue Susu's works] does not have a goal and soul that approaches the celestial." Although she painted the standard subjects of scenes, bamboo and blooms (being especially attached to orchids), Xue was noted for her work in figure painting, which was a similarly bizarre aesthetic point for prostitutes to address. Instances of her works of art are shown at the Honolulu Museum of Art and the San Francisco Asian Art Museum. 

Xue routinely highlighted her artistic creations with her very own ballads, and distributed two volumes of composing, just a solitary one of which is as yet surviving. "Hua suo shi" ("Trifles about Flowers") is an accumulation of short writing articles and stories about different blooms, while "Nan you cao" ("Notes from a Journey toward the South"), which has been lost, clearly contained a determination of her lyrics viewing life as a prostitute. Some of these were gathered in different compilations from the late Ming and early Qing lines. 

Hu Yinglin composed that "Her verse, albeit ailing in opportunity, demonstrates an ability uncommon among ladies." Moving in scholarly circles, Xue additionally gave the topic to numerous contemporary writers. Xu Yuan, another female writer of the period, portrays Xue's appeal: 

<poem> 

"Lotus blooms as she moves her pair of curves" 

"Inclining bashfully against the East Wind" 

</poem> 

Hu Yinglin composed of Xue: 

<poem> 

"Who transplanted this blossom of famous species to the Imperial patio nursery?" 

"She lives close to the securing like Taoye [Peach Leaf], under the breeze" 

"The red phoenix is half-raised as a result of her mate" 

"This is the minute to peruse "Unceasing Regret", the ballad of Bo Juyi" 

</poem> 

Xue's own works manage an assortment of topics, from the mildy sexual: 

<poem> 

"Inside the city dividers of stone in the joy quarter" 

"The waterway sparkles, the waters clear, and the seagulls swim in sets" 

"My weaved dress halfway acquires the tone of hibiscus" 

"On the off chance that I didn't respond your sentiments" 

</poem> 

to the sentimental: 

<poem> 

"This stunning night I consider you, pondering whether you will return" 

"I grasp one solitary cushion; there is no one to converse with" 

</poem> 

to the unusually philosophical: 

<poem> 

"Loaded with fragrance is the flavor of wine underneath the sprout" 

"In isolation I watch the seagulls fly over the sky" 

</poem> 

Xue frequently traded ballads and sketches with her customer base, getting their very own fine arts in return. 

While she exceeded expectations at verse, painting and weaving, the aptitude that set Xue apart from different concubines and made a clique of superstar around her was her ability for bows and arrows. Her dominance of a customarily manly craftsmanship gave her a quality of hermaphrodism that was considered exceedingly alluring by the literati of the time. Having drilled in Beijing as a tyke she assisted her aptitudes amid a visit in the organization of a military officer in the distant locales of China. The horsemen of the neighborhood clans there were inspired with her shooting, and she moved toward becoming something of a nearby big name. Sometime down the road she gave open exhibits in Hangzhou, which drew substantial gatherings of people. Hu Yinglin portrays one such execution: 

"She can shoot two balls from her crossbow consistently and make the second ball strike the first and break it in mid-air. Another trap she can do is to put a ball on the ground, and, by pulling the bow in reverse with her left hand, while her correct hand draws the bow from despite her good faith, hit it. Out of a hundred shots, she doesn't miss a solitary one. 

The artist Lu Bi reviews another trap shot performed by Xue: "When the hireling young lady takes a ball in her grasp and places it over her head/She [Xue] pivots, hits it with another ball, and the two balls tumble to the ground."
