No. 76 Wing RAAF 

No. 76 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing that worked amid World War II. At first situated in Far North Queensland, its central station exchanged to Darwin, Northern Territory, in September 1944 to assume responsibility for three PBY Catalina units: Nos.Ã¢Â 20, 42, and 43 Squadrons. The prime undertaking of these squadrons was minelaying in the South West Pacific theater, and they led these tasks as far away from home as Java, Borneo, the Philippines, and China. Just as minelaying, No.Ã¢Â 76 Wing's Catalinas flew besieging, watch, and transport missions, and dropped a large number of publicity flyers in the end a very long time of the war. The wing base camp disbanded in November 1945. 

No. 76 Wing home office was set up at Townsville, Queensland, on 3ÃÂ January 1944, and moved to Cairns mid-month. Driven by Wing Commander Reginald Burrage, it exchanged to Darwin, Northern Territory, in September to arrange and control minelaying activities in the North-Western Area by Nos.Ã¢Â 20, 42, and 43 Squadrons. Every one of the squadrons was furnished with PBY Catalina flying vessels, nicknamed "Dark Cats"; No.Ã¢Â 20 had been situated in Cairns with No.Ã¢Â 76 Wing central station, No.Ã¢Â 42 had recently been shaped at Darwin in August, while No.Ã¢Â 43 had been working out of Darwin since March. Minelaying missions completed by the RAAF over the previous year had been credited with effectively disturbing adversary shipping for an a lot littler cost of working hours than regular besieging, and were therefore viewed as sufficiently productive to devote a wing with three squadrons to facilitating the work. Despite the fact that the Catalinas were generally moderate and defenseless to adversary warrior assault, their misfortune rate was close to one for each 95 fights. Notwithstanding its flying squadrons, the wing controlled No.Ã¢Â 2 Flying Boat Maintenance Unit, No.Ã¢Â 11 Air Sea Rescue Flight, and No.Ã¢Â 3 Mobile Torpedo Unit. All units were situated in Darwin with the exception of No.Ã¢Â 42 Squadron, which was based at Melville Bay. 

The Catalina squadrons were relied upon to do a sum of 100 missions for every month from Darwin. In their initial three weeks of activity from 13ÃÂ September 1944 they achieved 98, mining focuses in Celebes, Java, and Surabaya. In October, they had the capacity to utilize the as of late freed island of Morotai as a forward base for activities against Balikpapan and Tarakan. On 14ÃÂ December, No.Ã¢Â 43 Squadron, increased by Catalinas from No.Ã¢Â 11 Squadron based at Rathmines, New South Wales, mined Manila Bay to keep Japanese transportation "contained", in this way supporting the Allied arriving at Mindoro occurring the following day. Flying from Leyte, the 24 Catalinas effectively dropped 60 mines in the intensely guarded target territory for the loss of one of their number, and came back to base at the point of confinement of their fuel holds. 

In the early piece of 1945, monsoonal climate in Darwin diminished the quantity of missions flown by No.Ã¢Â 76 Wing. The evening of 5/6ÃÂ April, three Catalinas kept watch on the Japanese cruiser , which was along these lines struck by Allied aircraft and sunk by submarines. Amid the month, the Catalinas mined Hong Kong harbor, just as focuses on the shoreline of terrain China, flying as long as sixteen hours for each mission. On 26ÃÂ May, they embraced the RAAF's most northerly activity amid the Pacific War, against Wenchow. That month, Group Captain Stuart Campbell, previous pioneer of No.Ã¢Â 42 Squadron, took over order of the wing. In MayÃ¢ÂÂJune, fortified by a separation from No.Ã¢Â 11 Squadron, No.Ã¢Â 76 Wing flew mining and besieging missions in help of the imminent Operation Oboe Six, the Battle of North Borneo, and Oboe Two, the Battle of Balikpapan. Prior to Oboe Six, while a portion of the Catalinas focused on mining the ways to deal with Surabaya harbor, others besieged landing strips in Java and Celebes working together with RAAF B-24 Liberators. The Catalinas and Liberators joined again ahead of the pack up to Oboe Two to strike any Japanese landing strips that could compromise Balikpapan, sometimes shelling a similar focus nonstop, the Catalinas by night and Liberators by day. 

With the Allies' choice to bind RAAF minelaying activities to regions south of China from June onwards, the quantity of beneficial focuses for the Catalinas was diminished. Forays for the month were down to 58, various which were done from Labuan against Banka Strait. The wing's last minelaying missions of the war occurred in July, again in the Banka Strait. In the last a long time before the Japanese surrender, the Catalinas likewise conveyed promulgation pamphlets around the Dutch East Indies and South China Sea, dropping over a million in June alone. No.Ã¢Â 76 Wing and its squadrons stayed at Darwin in the prompt fallout of the war, leading routine watches, transporting supplies and prescription to detainees of-war in the South West Pacific, and aiding the repatriation of Australian faculty. In November 1945, under a revamping of RAAF units at Darwin, the wing central command was offered requests to disband. It progressed toward becoming non-operational on 16ÃÂ November and was authoritatively broken up five days after the fact. No.Ã¢Â 42 Squadron disbanded that month, while Nos.Ã¢Â 20 and 43 Squadrons exchanged to Rathmines, where they disbanded in 1946.
