New York State RouteÃ¢Â 326 (NYÃÂ 326) is a state roadway in Cayuga County, New York, in the United States. NYÃÂ 326 keeps running in a southwest to upper east course from the town of Union Springs to the city of Auburn. The western end of the course is at a crossing point with NYÃÂ 90 close to the northern town line of Union Springs. Its eastern end is at an intersection with U.S. RouteÃ¢Â 20 (USÃÂ 20) and NYÃÂ 5 only west of the Auburn city constrains in the town of Aurelius. NYÃÂ 326 goes through to a great extent country bits of the Finger Lakes district and does not leave through any worked behind regions other than those at every one of its ends. 

NYÃÂ 326 was allocated as a major aspect of the 1930 renumbering of state expressways in New York as a connector parkway between Union Springs and Auburn. Notwithstanding, its unique arrangement pursued Oakwood Road and Genesee Street from the villa of Oakwood to downtown Auburn. It was realigned in the mid-1970s to finish at USÃÂ 20 and NYÃÂ 5 west of downtown Auburn. In 1981, NYÃÂ 326 was rerouted between the villages of Oakwood and Half Acre to pursue Half Acre Road. NYÃÂ 326's previous directing between the two is presently kept up by Cayuga County. 

NYÃÂ 326 starts at a crossing point with NYÃÂ 90 close to the northern town line of Union Springs. The interstate heads eastbound, after Auburn Street as it keeps running along the northern town limit. It quickly parallels a previous arrangement of itself, presently known as "Old RouteÃ¢Â 326", before leaving Union Springs and entering the encompassing town of Springport. Quite a bit of Springport, a town arranged on the eastern shore of Cayuga Lake, is provincial and to a great extent undeveloped. The course goes by houses and fields as it continues to an intersection referred to locally as "Forces Corner". Here, NYÃÂ 326 turns northeastward and moves toward becoming referred to just by its assignment as it makes a beeline for the village of Oakwood. 

In Oakwood, NYÃÂ 326 passes a few homes and converges Oakwood Road, a northÃ¢ÂÂsouth thruway connecting the network to West Genesee Street in the town of Aurelius toward the north. At this intersection, NYÃÂ 326 turns out to be Half Acre Road, named for the villa of Half Acre toward the upper east. The roadway proceeds with its northeastern track for before swinging toward the north and entering Half Acre, a little network in Aurelius that is developed around the intersection of Half Acre Road and West Genesee Street. Here, NYÃÂ 326 swings eastbound to pursue West Genesee Road toward the city of Auburn. It parallels USÃÂ 20 and NYÃÂ 5 for to the Veterans Memorial Parkway, which NYÃÂ 326 turns northward onto.

NYÃÂ 326 was doled out as a feature of the 1930 renumbering of state interstates in New York and stretched out from the town of Union Springs to the city of Auburn. The course at first pursued Oakwood Road and Genesee Street from the village of Oakwood to Auburn, where it finished at a crossing point with NYÃÂ 34 (South Street) in downtown Auburn. A partitioned roadway was fabricated west of Auburn , associating the covering courses of USÃÂ 20 and NYÃÂ 5 to NYÃÂ 326. USÃÂ 20 and NYÃÂ 5 were rerouted to pursue the new interstate south to NYÃÂ 326, and each of the three courses proceeded with east into downtown on Genesee Street. By 1977, USÃÂ 20 and NYÃÂ 5 were realigned by and by to pursue another blood vessel driving from the north end of the isolated thruway eastbound into downtown. NYÃÂ 326, in the interim, was realigned to pursue the isolated parkway north to USÃÂ 20 and NYÃÂ 5. 

On AprilÃ¢Â 1, 1981, NYÃÂ 326 was realigned between the villages of Oakwood and Half Acre as the consequence of a parkway support swap between the province of New York and Cayuga County. As a feature of the swap, the province of New York expected support of Half Acre Road from Oakwood to Half Acre while upkeep of NYÃÂ 326's previous directing between the two areas was exchanged to Cayuga County. The previous steering of NYÃÂ 326 on Oakwood Road is currently assigned as County RouteÃÂ 168A (CRÃÂ 168A) in the town of Aurelius and CRÃÂ 168B in the town of Springport. The Genesee Street segment of old NYÃÂ 326 is presently part of CRÃÂ 1. In the 1981 support swap, the territory of New York likewise accepted upkeep of the segment of Half Acre Road between Half Acre (at NYÃÂ 326) and the USÃÂ 20ÃÂ /NYÃÂ 5 simultaneousness. This bit of Half Acre Road is presently NYÃÂ 931E, an unsigned reference course.
