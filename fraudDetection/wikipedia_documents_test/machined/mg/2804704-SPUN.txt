Run with the Wind (film) 

Run with the Wind is a 1939 American epic recorded sentiment film, adjusted from Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel of a similar name. The film was delivered by David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures and coordinated by Victor Fleming. Set in the American South against the setting of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction period, the film recounts to the tale of Scarlett O'Hara, the solid willed little girl of a Georgia estate proprietor. It pursues her sentimental quest for Ashley Wilkes, who is hitched to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, and her ensuing marriage to Rhett Butler. The main jobs are played by Vivien Leigh (Scarlett), Clark Gable (Rhett), Leslie Howard (Ashley), and Olivia de Havilland (Melanie). 

Creation was troublesome from the begin. Shooting was postponed for a long time in view of Selznick's assurance to verify Gable for the job of Rhett Butler, and the "look for Scarlett" prompted 1,400 ladies being met for the part. The first screenplay was composed by Sidney Howard and experienced numerous amendments by a few essayists trying to get it down to a reasonable length. The first executive, George Cukor, was terminated not long after recording started and was supplanted by Fleming, who thus was quickly supplanted by Sam Wood while Fleming took a break because of fatigue. 

The film got positive surveys upon its discharge in December 1939, albeit a few commentators discovered it overlong. The throwing was generally adulated, and numerous analysts discovered Leigh particularly fit to her job as Scarlett. At the twelfth Academy Awards, it got ten Academy Awards (eight focused, two privileged) from thirteen selections, including wins for Best Picture, Best Director (Fleming), Best Adapted Screenplay (after death granted to Sidney Howard), Best Actress (Leigh), and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel, turning into the primary African American to win an Academy Award). It set records for the all out number of wins and designations at the time. In spite of the fact that the film has been condemned as authentic revisionism celebrating subjugation, it has been credited with activating changes in the manner by which African Americans are delineated artistically. 

"Run with the Wind" was massively well known when originally discharged. It turned into the most noteworthy gaining film made up to that point, and held the record for over a fourth of a century. At the point when balanced for money related expansion, it is as yet the best film in film industry history. It was re-discharged intermittently all through the twentieth century and wound up imbued in mainstream culture. The film is viewed as one of the best movies ever; it has put in the best ten of the American Film Institute's rundown of the best 100 American movies since the rundown's commencement in 1998. In 1989, the United States Library of Congress chose it for conservation in the National Film Registry. 

On the eve of the American Civil War in 1861, Scarlett O'Hara lives at Tara, her family's cotton ranch in Georgia, with her folks and two sisters and their numerous slaves. Scarlett discovers that Ashley WilkesÃ¢ÂÂwhom she covertly lovesÃ¢ÂÂis to be hitched to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, and the commitment is to be declared the following day at a grill at Ashley's home, the adjacent estate Twelve Oaks. 

At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett secretly proclaims her sentiments to Ashley, however he repels her by reacting that he and Melanie are progressively good. Scarlett is frustrated when she finds another visitor, Rhett Butler, has caught their discussion. The grill is upset by the assertion of war and the men hurry to enroll. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie farewell, Melanie's more youthful sibling Charles proposes to her. Despite the fact that she doesn't love him, Scarlett assents and they are hitched before he leaves to battle. 

Scarlett is bereaved when Charles bites the dust from an episode of pneumonia and measles while serving in the Confederate Army. Scarlett's mom sends her to the Hamilton home in Atlanta to brighten her up, despite the fact that the O'Haras' blunt house slave Mammy reveals to Scarlett she realizes she is going there just to sit tight for Ashley's arrival. Scarlett, who ought not go to a gathering while in grieving, goes to a philanthropy bazaar in Atlanta with Melanie where she meets Rhett once more, presently a barricade sprinter for the Confederacy. Commending a Confederate triumph and to fund-raise for the Confederate war exertion, men of their word are welcome to offered for women to hit the dance floor with them. Rhett makes an unnecessarily substantial offer for Scarlett and, to the objection to the visitors, she consents to hit the dance floor with him. 

The tide of war betrays the Confederacy after the Battle of Gettysburg in which a considerable lot of the men of Scarlett's town are slaughtered. Scarlett makes another ineffective intrigue to Ashley while he is visiting on Christmas leave of absence, despite the fact that they do share a private and energetic kiss in the parlor on Christmas Day, just before he comes back to war. 

After eight months, as the city is blockaded by the Union Army in the Atlanta Campaign, Scarlett and her young house slave Prissy must convey Melanie's infant without therapeutic help after she goes into untimely work. Subsequently, Scarlett calls upon Rhett to take her home to Tara with Melanie, her child, and Prissy; he gathers them in a pony and wagon, yet once out of the city heads out to battle, leaving Scarlett and the gathering to make their own specific manner back to Tara. Upon her arrival home, Scarlett discovers Tara left, with the exception of her dad, her sisters, and two previous slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett discovers that her mom has only kicked the bucket of typhoid fever and her dad has turned out to be uncouth. With Tara plundered by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett promises she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself. 

As the O'Haras work in the cotton handle, Scarlett's dad is slaughtered after he is tossed from his steed trying to pursue away a bastard from his property. With the thrashing of the Confederacy, Ashley additionally returns, however discovers he is of little help at Tara. At the point when Scarlett implores him to flee with her, he admits his longing for her and kisses her enthusiastically, however says he can't leave Melanie. Unfit to make good on the regulatory obligations on Tara executed by Reconstructionists, Scarlett hoodwinks her more youthful sister Suellen's fiancÄÅ¡, the moderately aged and well off plant proprietor Frank Kennedy, into wedding her, by saying Suellen became weary of pausing and wedded another suitor. 

Straight to the point, Ashley, Rhett and a few different associates make a night assault on a shanty town after Scarlett is assaulted while driving through only it, bringing about Frank's demise. With Frank's burial service scarcely finished, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she acknowledges. They have a little girl whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, however Scarlett, as yet pining for Ashley and chagrined at the apparent ruin of her figure, lets Rhett realize that she needs no more kids and that they will never again share a bed. 

One day at Frank's plant, Scarlett and Ashley are seen grasping by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an extreme abhorrence of Scarlett she energetically spreads bits of gossip. Later that night, Rhett, having heard the bits of gossip, powers Scarlett to go to a birthday party for Ashley. Unequipped for thinking anything awful of her, Melanie remains close by so all realize that she trusts the tattle to be false. In the wake of returning home from the gathering, Scarlett discovers Rhett first floor alcoholic, and they contend about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett without wanting to, expressing his aim to engage in sexual relations with her that night, and conveys the battling Scarlett to the room. The following day, Rhett apologizes for his conduct and offers Scarlett a separation, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disrespect. At the point when Rhett comes back from an all-encompassing outing to London, Scarlett educates him that she is pregnant, however a contention follows which results in her tumbling down a trip of stairs and enduring an unnatural birth cycle. As she is recouping, catastrophe strikes when Bonnie bites the dust while endeavoring to hop a fence with her horse. 

Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has experienced entanglements emerging another pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett supports Ashley, Rhett gets ready to leave Atlanta. Having understood that it was he she genuinely cherished from the beginning, and not Ashley, Scarlett begs Rhett to remain, however Rhett repels her and leaves into the morning mist, abandoning her in tears on the staircase, vowing to one day win back his adoration. 

In spite of getting top-charging in the opening credits, GableÃ¢ÂÂalong with Leigh, Howard, and de Havilland who get second, third, and fourth charging respectivelyÃ¢ÂÂhas a generally low setting in the cast rundown, because of its strange structure. As opposed to requested by ordinary charging, the cast is separated into three segments: the Tara estate, Twelve Oaks, and Atlanta. The cast's names are requested by the social status of the characters; hence Thomas Mitchell, who plays Gerald O'Hara, drives the give list a role as the leader of the O'Hara family, while Barbara O'Neil as his significant other gets the second acknowledge and Vivien Leigh as the oldest girl the third credit, regardless of having the most screen time. Essentially, Howard C. Hickman as John Wilkes is credited over Leslie Howard who plays his child, and Clark Gable, who plays just a guest at Twelve Oaks, gets a moderately low credit in the cast rundown, in spite of being introduced as the "star" of the film in all the special writing. Following the passing of Mary AndersonÃ¢ÂÂwho played Maybelle MerriwetherÃ¢ÂÂin April 2014, there are just two enduring credited cast individuals from the film: Olivia de Havilland, who played Melanie Wilkes; and Mickey Kuhn, who played her child, Beau. 

Prior to production of the novel, a few Hollywood officials and studios declined to make a film dependent on it, including Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Pandro Berman at RKO Pictures, and David O. Selznick of Selznick International Pictures. Jack L. Warner enjoyed the story, however Warner Bros'. greatest star Bette Davis was uninterested, and Darryl Zanuck of twentieth Century-Fox did not offer enough cash. Selznick altered his opinion after his story editorial manager Kay Brown and colleague John Hay Whitney encouraged him to purchase the film rights. In July 1936Ã¢ÂÂa month after it was publishedÃ¢ÂÂSelznick purchased the rights for $50,000. 

The throwing of the two lead jobs turned into an unpredictable, two-year attempt. For the job of Rhett Butler, Selznick needed Clark Gable from the begin, yet Gable was under contract to MGM, which never lent him to different studios. Gary Cooper was considered, yet Samuel GoldwynÃ¢ÂÂto whom Cooper was under contractÃ¢ÂÂrefused to advance him out. Warner offered a bundle of Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, and Olivia de Havilland for lead jobs as a byproduct of the dispersion rights. At this point, Selznick was resolved to get Gable and in the long run hit an arrangement with MGM. Selznick's dad in-law, MGM boss Louis B. Mayer, offered in August 1938 to give Gable and $1,250,000 to half of the film's financial plan however at a staggering expense: Selznick would need to pay Gable's week after week pay, and a large portion of the benefits would go to MGM while Loew's, IncÃ¢ÂÂMGM's parent companyÃ¢ÂÂwould discharge the film. 

The game plan to discharge through MGM implied postponing the beginning of generation until the finish of 1938, when Selznick's conveyance manage United Artists closed. Selznick utilized the postponement to keep on reexamining the content and, all the more significantly, construct attention for the film via looking for the job of Scarlett. Selznick started an across the nation throwing call that met 1,400 questions. The exertion cost $100,000 and was pointless for the film, yet made "precious" exposure. Early leaders included Miriam Hopkins and Tallulah Bankhead, who were viewed as conceivable outcomes by Selznick before the buy of the film rights; Joan Crawford, who was marked to MGM, was additionally considered as a potential blending with Gable. After an arrangement was hit with MGM, Selznick had dialogs with Norma ShearerÃ¢ÂÂwho was MGM's top female star at the timeÃ¢ÂÂbut she pulled back herself from thought. Katharine Hepburn campaigned hard for the job with the help of her companion, George Cukor, who had been enlisted to coordinate, however she was vetoed by Selznick who felt she was not directly for the part. 

Numerous famousÃ¢ÂÂor destined to-be-famousÃ¢ÂÂactresses were considered, however just thirty-one ladies were really screen-tried for Scarlett including Ardis Ankerson, Jean Arthur, Tallulah Bankhead, Diana Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Nancy Coleman, Frances Dee, Ellen Drew (as Terry Ray), Paulette Goddard, Susan Hayward (under her genuine name of Edythe Marrenner), Vivien Leigh, Anita Louise, Haila Stoddard, Margaret Tallichet, Lana Turner and Linda Watkins. Despite the fact that Margaret Mitchell declined to openly name her decision, the on-screen character who came nearest to winning her endorsement was Miriam Hopkins, who Mitchell felt was only the correct kind of performing artist to play Scarlett as written in the book. Nonetheless, Hopkins was in her mid-thirties at the time and was viewed as unreasonably old for the part. Four performers, including Jean Arthur and Joan Bennett, were still under thought by December 1938; notwithstanding, just two finalists, Paulette Goddard and Vivien Leigh, were tried in Technicolor, both on December 20. Goddard nearly won the job, yet discussion over her marriage with Charlie Chaplin made Selznick alter his opinion. 

Selznick had been discreetly considering Vivien Leigh, a youthful English on-screen character who was still minimal known in America, for the job of Scarlett since February 1938 when Selznick saw her in "Flame Over England" and "A Yank at Oxford". Leigh's American specialist was the London illustrative of the Myron Selznick ability office (headed by David Selznick's sibling, one of the proprietors of Selznick International), and she had mentioned in February that her name be submitted for thought as Scarlett. By the mid year of 1938 the Selznicks were consulting with Alexander Korda, to whom Leigh was under contract, for her administrations soon thereafter. Selznick's sibling masterminded them to meet out of the blue the evening of December 10, 1938, when the consuming of Atlanta was shot. In a letter to his significant other two days after the fact, Selznick conceded that Leigh was "the Scarlett dim steed", and after a progression of screen tests, her throwing was declared on January 13, 1939. Just before the shooting of the film, Selznick educated paper feature writer Ed Sullivan: "Scarlett O'Hara's folks were French and Irish. Indistinguishably, Miss Leigh's folks are French and Irish." 

Of unique screenplay author Sidney Howard, film history specialist Joanne Yeck states, "lessening the complexities of "Run with the Wind"s epic measurements was an enormous undertaking ... furthermore, Howard's first accommodation was very long, and would have required something like six hours of film; ... [producer] Selznick needed Howard to stay on the set to make corrections ... be that as it may, Howard would not leave New England [and] accordingly, corrections were taken care of by a large group of nearby authors". Selznick expelled chief George Cukor three weeks into taping and searched out Victor Fleming, who was coordinating "The Wizard of Oz" at the time. Fleming was disappointed with the content, so Selznick got acclaimed author Ben Hecht to change the whole screenplay inside five days. Hecht came back to Howard's unique draft and before the week's over had prevailing with regards to changing the whole first 50% of the content. Selznick attempted changing the second half himself however fell behind timetable, so Howard came back to deal with the content for multi week, adjusting a few key scenes to some degree two. 

"When of the film's discharge in 1939, there was some inquiry regarding who ought to get screen credit", composes Yeck. "In any case, in spite of the quantity of journalists and changes, the last content was astoundingly near Howard's variant. The way that Howard's name alone shows up on the credits may have been as much a signal to his memory as to his composition, for in 1939 Sidney Howard passed on at age 48 out of a homestead tractor mishap, and before the motion picture's debut." Selznick, in an update written in October 1939, talked about the film's composition credits: "[Y]ou can say honestly that of the nearly little measure of material in the image which isn't from the book, most is my own actually, and the main unique lines of exchange which are not my very own are a couple from Sidney Howard and a couple from Ben Hecht and a couple more from John Van Druten. Spur of the moment I question that there are ten unique expressions of [Oliver] Garrett's in the entire content. As to development, this is around 80% my own, and the rest isolated between Jo Swerling and Sidney Howard, with Hecht having contributed substantially to the development of one grouping." 

As per Hecht biographer, William MacAdams, "At first light on Sunday, February 20, 1939, David Selznick ... furthermore, executive Victor Fleming shook Hecht alert to advise him he was on advance from MGM and must accompany them promptly and get down to business on "Run with the Wind", which Selznick had started shooting five weeks prior. It was costing Selznick $50,000 every day the film was on hold hanging tight for a last screenplay change and time was of the pith. Hecht was highly involved with chipping away at the film "At the Circus" for the Marx Brothers. Reviewing the scene in a letter to screenwriter companion Gene Fowler, he said he hadn't perused the novel yet Selznick and chief Fleming couldn't sit tight for him to peruse it. They acted scenes dependent on Sidney Howard's unique content which should have been changed in a rush. Hecht expressed, "After every scene had been performed and talked about, I sat down at the  and worked it out. Selznick and Fleming, anxious to proceed with their acting, continued rushing me. We worked in this style for seven days, putting in eighteen to twenty hours per day. Selznick wouldn't give us a chance to have lunch, contending that nourishment would moderate us up. He gave bananas and salted peanuts ... accordingly on the seventh day I had finished, sound, the initial nine reels of the Civil War epic." 

MacAdams expresses, "It is difficult to decide precisely the amount Hecht scripted ... In the official credits documented with the Screen Writers Guild, Sidney Howard was obviously granted the sole screen credit, yet four different journalists were attached ... Jo Swerling for adding to the treatment, Oliver H. P. Garrett and Barbara Keon to screenplay development, and Hecht, to exchange ..." 

Key photography started January 26, 1939, and finished on July 1, with after generation work proceeding until November 11, 1939. Chief George Cukor, with whom Selznick had a long working relationship, and who had gone through very nearly two years in pre-generation on "Run with the Wind", was supplanted after under three weeks of shooting. Selznick and Cukor had just differ over the pace of shooting and the content, yet different clarifications put Cukor's takeoff down to Gable's distress at working with him. Emanuel Levy, Cukor's biographer, asserted that Clark Gable had worked Hollywood's gay circuit as a hawker and that Cukor knew about his past, so Gable utilized his impact to have him released. Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland scholarly of Cukor's terminating on the day the Atlanta bazaar scene was taped, and the pair went to Selznick's office in full outfit and begged him to alter his opinion. Victor Fleming, who was coordinating "The Wizard of Oz", was brought in from MGM to finish the image, in spite of the fact that Cukor proceeded secretly to mentor Leigh and De Havilland. Another MGM executive, Sam Wood, labored for about fourteen days in May when Fleming briefly left the creation because of depletion. Albeit a portion of Cukor's scenes were later reshot, Selznick evaluated that "three strong reels" of his work stayed in the image. As of the finish of main photography, Cukor had embraced eighteen days of taping, Fleming ninety-three, and Wood twenty-four. 

Cinematographer Lee Garmes started the generation, yet on March 11, 1939Ã¢ÂÂafter every period of shooting film that Selznick and his partners viewed as "too dark"Ã¢ÂÂwas supplanted with Ernest Haller, working with Technicolor cinematographer Ray Rennahan. Garmes finished the principal third of the filmÃ¢ÂÂmostly everything before Melanie having the babyÃ¢ÂÂbut did not get a credit. The greater part of the recording was done on "the back forty" of Selznick International with all the area scenes being shot in California, for the most part in Los Angeles County or neighboring Ventura County. Tara, the anecdotal Southern estate house, existed just as a compressed wood and papier-mÄËchÄÅ¡ veneer based on the Selznick studio parcel. For the consuming of Atlanta, new false exteriors were worked before the Selznick backlot's numerous old surrendered sets, and Selznick himself worked the controls for the explosives that torched them. Sources at the time put the evaluated generation costs at $3.85Ã¢Â million, making it the second most costly film made up to that point, with just "Ben-Hur" (1925) having cost more. 

Despite the fact that legend continues that the Hays Office fined Selznick $5,000 for utilizing "damn" in Butler's leave line, in reality the Motion Picture Association load up passed a correction to the Production Code on November 1, 1939, that restricted utilization of the words "hellfire" or "damn" aside from when their utilization "will be basic and required for depiction, in legitimate recorded setting, of any scene or exchange dependent on authentic truth or old stories ... or then again a citation from an abstract work, gave that no such use will be allowed which is characteristically frightful or affronts great taste". With that correction, the Production Code Administration had no further complaint to Rhett's end line. 

To form the score, Selznick picked Max Steiner, with whom he had worked at RKO Pictures in the mid 1930s. Warner Bros.Ã¢ÂÂwho had contracted Steiner in 1936Ã¢ÂÂagreed to loan him to Selznick. Steiner went through twelve weeks dealing with the score, the longest period that he had ever spent thinking of one, and at two hours and thirty-six minutes in length it was likewise the longest that he had ever composed. Five orchestrators were employed, including Hugo Friedhofer, Maurice de Packh, Bernard Kaun, Adolph Deutsch and Reginald Bassett. The score is described by two love subjects, one for Ashley's and Melanie's sweet love and another that summons Scarlett's enthusiasm for Ashley, however eminently there is no Scarlett and Rhett love topic. Steiner drew significantly on society and enthusiastic music, which included Stephen Foster tunes, for example, "Louisiana Belle", "Dolly Day", "Ringo De Banjo", "Delightful Dreamer", "Old Folks at Home", and "Katie Belle", which shaped the premise of Scarlett's topic; different tunes that highlight conspicuously are: "Walking through Georgia" by Henry Clay Work, "Dixie", "Garryowen", and "The Bonnie Blue Flag". The topic that is most connected with the film today is the tune that goes with Tara, the O'Hara ranch; in the mid 1940s, "Tara's Theme" framed the melodic premise of the tune "My Own True Love" by Mack David. On the whole, there are ninety-nine separate bits of music included in the score. Because of the weight of finishing on schedule, Steiner got some help with forming from Friedhofer, Deutsch and Heinz Roemheld, and also, two short cuesÃ¢ÂÂby Franz Waxman and William AxtÃ¢ÂÂwere taken from scores in the MGM library. 

On September 9, 1939, Selznick, his significant other, Irene, speculator John "Muscle head" Whitney and film manager Hal Kern drove out to Riverside, California to review it at the Fox Theater. The film was as yet an unpleasant cut at this stage, missing finished titles and lacking uncommon optical impacts. It kept running for four hours and twenty-five minutes, yet later was sliced to under four hours for its appropriate discharge. A twofold bill of "Hawaiian Nights" and "Playmate Geste" was playing, and after the primary component it was reported that the performance center would screen a see; the gathering of people were educated they could leave however would not be readmitted once the film had started, nor would telephone calls be permitted once the venue had been fixed. At the point when the title showed up on the screen the crowd cheered, and after it had completed it gotten an overwhelming applause. In his life story of Selznick, David Thomson composed that the crowd's reaction before the film had even begun "was the best snapshot of [Selznick's] life, the best triumph and reclamation of every one of his failings", with Selznick portraying the review cards as "likely the most astounding any image has ever had". At the point when Selznick was asked by the press toward the beginning of September how he felt about the film, he stated: "Around early afternoon I believe it's perfect, at midnight I believe it's lousy. Here and there I believe it's the best picture at any point made. Yet, on the off chance that it's solitary an incredible picture, despite everything i'll be fulfilled." 

Around 300,000 individuals turned out in Atlanta for the film's debut at the Loew's Grand Theater on December 15, 1939. It was the peak of three days of celebrations facilitated by Mayor William B. Hartsfield, which incorporated a motorcade of limousines highlighting stars from the film, gatherings, a large number of Confederate banners and an ensemble ball. Eurith D. Waterways, the legislative leader of Georgia, proclaimed December 15 a state occasion. An expected three hundred thousand occupants and guests to Atlanta arranged the roads for to seven miles to watch a parade of limousines bring the stars from the airplane terminal. Just Leslie Howard and Victor Fleming decided not to visit: Howard had come back to England because of the flare-up of World War II, and Fleming had dropped out with Selznick and declined to go to any of the debuts. Hattie McDaniel was additionally missing, as she and the other dark cast individuals were kept from going to the debut because of Georgia's Jim Crow laws, which shielded them from sitting with their white partners. After discovering that McDaniel had been banished from the debut, Clark Gable took steps to blacklist the occasion, yet McDaniel induced him to visit. President Jimmy Carter later reviewed it as "the greatest occasion to occur in the South in my lifetime". Debuts in New York and Los Angeles pursued, the last gone to by a portion of the on-screen characters that had been considered for the piece of Scarlett, among them Paulette Goddard, Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford. 

From December 1939 to July 1940, the film played just development ticket street show commitment at a predetermined number of theaters at costs upwards of $1Ã¢ÂÂmore than twofold the cost of a normal first-run featureÃ¢ÂÂwith MGM gathering an exceptional 70 percent of the movies receipts (rather than the run of the mill 30Ã¢ÂÂ35 percent of the period). Subsequent to achieving immersion as a roadshow, MGM updated its terms to a 50 percent cut and divided the costs, before it at long last entered general discharge in 1941 at "mainstream" costs. Alongside its circulation and publicizing costs, complete consumption on the film was as high as $7 million. 

In 1942, Selznick exchanged his organization for expense reasons, and sold his offer in "Run with the Wind" to his colleague, John Whitney, for $500,000. Thusly, Whitney sold it on to MGM for $2.8 million, with the goal that the studio claimed the film out and out. MGM quickly re-discharged the film in spring 1942, and again in 1947 and 1954; the 1954 reissue was the first run through the film was appeared in widescreen, bargaining the first Academy proportion and trimming the top and base to a perspective proportion of 1.75:1. In doing as such, various shots were optically re-confined and cut into the three-strip camera negatives, always changing five shots in the film. A 1961 discharge celebrated the centennial commemoration of the beginning of the Civil War, and incorporated a function "debut" at the Loew's Grand Theater. It was gone to by Selznick and numerous different stars of the film, including Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland; Clark Gable had kicked the bucket the earlier year. For its 1967 re-discharge, it was exploded to 70mm, and issued with refreshed blurb fine art including GableÃ¢ÂÂwith his white shirt tore openÃ¢ÂÂholding Leigh against a scenery of orange flares. There were further re-discharges in 1971, 1974 and 1989; for the fiftieth commemoration reissue in 1989, it was given a total sound and video rebuilding. It was discharged dramatically once again in the United States, in 1998. In 2013, a 4K advanced rebuilding was discharged in the United Kingdom to harmonize with Vivien Leigh's centennial. In 2014, uncommon screenings were booked over a two-day time span at theaters over the United States to harmonize with the film's 75th commemoration. 

The film got its reality TV debut on the HBO link arrange on June 11, 1976, and played on the channel for an aggregate of multiple times all through the remainder of the month. It made its system TV debut in November soon thereafter: NBC paid $5 million for an irregular airing, and it was communicated in two sections on progressive nights. It progressed toward becoming around then the most elevated evaluated TV program at any point introduced on a solitary system, viewed by 47.5 percent of the family units inspected in America, and 65 percent of audience members, still the record for the most elevated appraised film to ever air on TV. In 1978, CBS marked an arrangement worth $35 million to communicate the film multiple times over the same number of years. Turner Entertainment procured the MGM film library in 1986, yet the arrangement did exclude the TV rights to "Run with the Wind", which were as yet held by CBS. An arrangement was struck in which the rights were come back to Turner Entertainment and CBS's communicated rights to "The Wizard of Oz" were broadened. It was utilized to dispatch two link stations possessed by Turner Broadcasting System: Turner Network Television (1988) and Turner Classic Movies (1994). It appeared on videocassette in March 1985, where it put second in the business diagrams, and has since been discharged on DVD and Blu-beam Disk positions. 

Upon its discharge, shopper magazines and papers for the most part gave "Run with the Wind" brilliant surveys; be that as it may, while its creation esteems, specialized accomplishments, and size of desire were all around perceived, a few commentators of the time observed the film to be excessively long and drastically unconvincing. Candid S. Nugent for "The New York Times" best summed up the general slant by recognizing that while it was the most eager film creation made up to that point, it likely was not the best film at any point made, however he by the by observed it to be a "fascinating story perfectly told". Franz Hoellering of "The Nation" was of a similar sentiment: "The outcome is a film which is a noteworthy occasion in the historical backdrop of the business however just a minor accomplishment in movie craftsmanship. There are minutes when the two classifications meet on great terms, however the significant lots between are loaded up with insignificant staggering productivity." 

While the film was commended for its devotion to the novel, this viewpoint was likewise singled out as the fundamental factor in adding to the protracted running time. John C. Flinn composed for "Assortment" that Selznick had "left a lot in", and that as stimulation, the film would have profited if dull scenes and exchange from the last piece of the story had been cut. "The Manchester Guardian" felt that the film's one genuine disadvantage was that the story come up short on the epic quality to legitimize the cost of time and found the second half, which centers around Scarlett's "immaterial relational unions" and "residential quarrels", for the most part pointless, and the sole explanation behind their consideration had been "basically in light of the fact that Margaret Mitchell composed it that way". "The Guardian" trusted that if "the story had been stopped and cleaned up at the point set apart by the interim, and if the individual dramatization had been made subservient to a true to life treatment of the focal themeÃ¢ÂÂthe breakdown and decimation of the Old SouthÃ¢ÂÂthen "Run With the Wind" may have been an extremely extraordinary film". In like manner, Hoellering likewise found the second 50% of the film to be flimsier than the principal half: recognizing the Civil War to be the main impetus of the initial segment while the characters command in the second part, he finished up this is the place the principle issue of the image lay, remarking that "the characters alone don't get the job done". In spite of numerous amazing scenes, he believed the dramatization to be unconvincing and that the "mental advancement" had been dismissed. 

A great part of the applause was saved for the throwing, with Vivien Leigh specifically being singled out for her execution as Scarlett. Nugent portrayed her as the "turn of the image" and trusted her to be "so flawlessly intended for the part by workmanship and nature that some other on-screen character in the job would be unfathomable". Additionally, Hoellering discovered her "flawless" in "appearance and developments"; he felt her acting best when she was permitted to "emphasize the split identity she depicts" and thought she was especially viable at such times of portrayal like the morning after the conjugal assault scene. Flinn additionally discovered Leigh fit to the job physically and felt she was best in the scenes where she shows mettle and assurance, for example, the break from Atlanta and when Scarlett slaughters a Yankee weakling. Leigh won in the Best Actress classification for her execution at the 1939 New York Film Critics Circle Awards. Of Clark Gable's execution as Rhett Butler, Flinn felt the portrayal was "as near Miss Mitchell's conceptionÃ¢ÂÂand the audience'sÃ¢ÂÂas may be envisioned", a view which Nugent agreed with, in spite of the fact that Hoellering felt that Gable didn't exactly persuade in the end scenes, as Rhett leaves Scarlett in nauseate. Of the other important cast individuals, both Hoellering and Flinn observed Leslie Howard to be "persuading" as the powerless willed Ashley, with Flinn distinguishing Olivia de Havilland as a "champion" as Melanie; Nugent was additionally particularly taken with de Havilland's execution, depicting it as a "generous, honorable, delicate diamond of portrayal". Hattie McDaniel's execution as Mammy was singled out for applause by numerous pundits: Nugent trusted she gave the best execution in the film after Vivien Leigh, with Flinn putting it third after Leigh's and Gable's exhibitions. 

At the twelfth Academy Awards, "Run with the Wind" set a record for Academy Award wins and designations, winning in eight of the focused classes it was named in, from an aggregate of thirteen selections. It won for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Editing, and got two further privileged honors for its utilization of gear and shading (it likewise turned into the primary shading movie to win Best Picture). Its record of eight aggressive successes remained until "Gigi" (1958) won nine, and its general record of ten was broken by "Ben-Hur" (1959) which won eleven. "Run with the Wind" additionally held the record for most assignments until "About Eve" (1950) verified fourteen. It was the longest American sound film made up to that point, may in any case hold the record of the longest Best Picture victor relying upon how it is deciphered. The running time for "Run with the Wind" is just shy of 221Ã¢Â minutes, while "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) keeps running for simply over 222Ã¢Â minutes; in any case, including the suggestion, recess, entr'acte, and leave music, "Run with the Wind" goes on for 234Ã¢Â minutes (albeit a few sources put its full length at 238Ã¢Â minutes) while "Lawrence of Arabia" comes in somewhat shorter at 232Ã¢Â minutes with its extra parts. 

Hattie McDaniel turned into the primary African-American to win an Academy AwardÃ¢ÂÂbeating out her co-star Olivia de Havilland who was likewise assigned in the equivalent categoryÃ¢ÂÂbut was racially isolated from her co-stars at the honors service at the Coconut Grove; she and her escort were made to sit at a different table at the back of the room. In the interim, screenwriter Sidney Howard turned into the main after death Oscar victor and Selznick actually got the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his profession accomplishments. 

Dark pundits condemned the film for its delineation of dark individuals and as a glorification of bondage. Carlton Moss, a dark playwright, griped in an open letter that though "The Birth of a Nation" was a "frontal assault on American history and the Negro individuals", "Run with the Wind" was a "back assault on the equivalent". He proceeded to expel it as a "nostalgic request for compassion toward an as yet living reason for Southern response". Greenery further censured the clichÃ© dark portrayals, for example, the "idle and dull-witted Pork", the "sluggish and completely flighty Prissy", Big Sam's "brilliant acknowledgment of subjection", and Mammy with her "consistent lecturing and spoiling each desire of Scarlett". Following Hattie McDaniel's Oscar win, Walter Francis White, pioneer of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, blamed her for being an Uncle Tom. McDaniel reacted that she would "preferably make seven hundred dollars seven days playing a servant than seven dollars being one"; she further scrutinized White's capability to talk for the benefit of blacks, since he was light-cleaned and one and only eighth dark. 

Feeling operating at a profit network was commonly partitioned upon discharge, with the film being called by nearly a "weapon of fear against dark America" and an affront to dark crowds, and showings were held in different urban areas. All things considered, a few segments of the dark network perceived McDaniel's accomplishments to be illustrative of movement: some African-Americans crossed picket lines and applauded McDaniel's warm and clever portrayal, and others trusted that the business' acknowledgment of her work would prompt expanded perceivability on screen for other dark performing artists. In its publication compliment to McDaniel on winning her Academy Award, "" utilized the film as notice of the "limit" put on dark desire by old preferences. Malcolm X later reviewed that "when Butterfly McQueen went into her demonstration, I had a craving for creeping under the floor covering". 

Upon its discharge, "Run with the Wind" broke participation records all over the place. At the Capitol Theater in New York alone, it was averaging eleven thousand confirmations for every day in late December, and inside four years of its discharge had sold an expected sixty million tickets over the United StatesÃ¢ÂÂsales proportionate to simply under a large portion of the populace at the time. It rehashed its prosperity abroad, and was a hair-raising hit amid the Blitz in London, opening in April 1940 and playing for a long time. When MGM pulled back it from course toward the finish of 1943 its overall conveyance had restored a gross rental (the a lot of the movies net) of $32 million, making it the most beneficial film at any point made up to that point. 

Despite the fact that it earned its financial specialists generally twice as much as the past record-holder, "The Birth of a Nation", the movies exhibitions of the two movies were likely a lot nearer. The greater part of the income from "Run with the Wind" originated from its roadshow and first-run commitment, which spoke to 70 percent and 50 percent of the movies net separately, before entering general discharge (which at the time normally observed the merchant's offer set at 30Ã¢ÂÂ35 percent of the gross). On account of "The Birth of a Nation", its wholesaler, Epoch, sold off a significant number of its circulation domains on a "states rights" basisÃ¢ÂÂwhich normally added up to 10 percent of the movies grossÃ¢ÂÂand Epoch's records are just characteristic of its own benefits from the film, and not the nearby merchants. Carl E. Milliken, secretary of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association, evaluated that "The Birth of a Nation" had been seen by fifty million individuals by 1930. 

When it was re-discharged in 1947, it earned a noteworthy $5 million rental in the United States and Canada, and was one of the best ten arrivals of the year. Effective re-discharges in 1954 and 1961 empowered it to hold its situation as the business' top worker, in spite of solid difficulties from later movies, for example, "Ben-Hur", yet it was at long last overwhelmed by "The Sound of Music" in 1966. The 1967 reissue was strange in that MGM selected to roadshow it, a choice that transformed it into the best re-discharge ever of industry. It produced a film industry gross of $68 million, making it MGM's most worthwhile picture after "Specialist Zhivago" from the last 50% of the decade. MGM earned a rental of $41 million from the discharge, with the U.S. what's more, Canadian offer adding up to over $30 million, putting it second just to "The Graduate" for that year. Counting its $6.7 million rental from the 1961 reissue, it was the fourth most noteworthy worker of the decade in the North American market, with just "The Sound of Music", "The Graduate" and "Specialist Zhivago" making more for their wholesalers. A further re-discharge in 1971 enabled it to quickly recover the record from "The Sound of Music", bringing its complete overall gross rental to about $116 million before the finish of 1971Ã¢ÂÂmore than trebling its income from its underlying releaseÃ¢ÂÂbefore losing the record again the next year to "The Godfather". 

Over all discharges, it is assessed that "Run with the Wind" has sold more than 200 million tickets in the United States and Canada, creating more theater affirmations in that region than some other film. The film was amazingly effective in Western Europe as well, creating around 35 million tickets in the United Kingdom and more than 16 million in France, separately turning into the greatest and 6th greatest ticket-merchants in those business sectors. Altogether, "Run with the Wind" has earned over $390 million all inclusive in the cinematic world; in 2007 Turner Entertainment assessed the gross to be proportionate to roughly $3.3 billion when balanced at expansion to current costs, while "Guinness World Records" touched base at a figure of $3.44 billion out of 2014, making it the best film in film history. 

The film remains colossally well known with gatherings of people into the 21st century, having been casted a ballot the most famous film in two across the country surveys of Americans embraced by Harris Interactive in 2008, and again in 2014. The statistical surveying firm studied more than two thousand U.S. grown-ups, with the outcomes weighted by age, sex, race/ethnicity, training, area and family unit salary so their extents coordinated the piece of the grown-up populace. 

In returning to the film during the 1970s, Arthur Schlesinger noticed that Hollywood movies for the most part age well, uncovering an unforeseen profundity or trustworthiness, however on account of "Run with the Wind" time has not treated it generous. Richard Schickel places that one proportion of a film's quality is to solicit what the watcher can recall from it, and the film tumbles down in such manner: exceptional symbolism and discourse are just not present. Stanley Kauffmann, in like manner, additionally observed the film to be a to a great extent forgettable experience, asserting he could just recall two scenes distinctively. Both Schickel and Schlesinger put this down to it being "severely composed", thus portraying the discourse as "extravagant" and having an "image postcard" reasonableness. Schickel additionally trusts the film flops as prevalent craftsmanship, in that it has constrained rewatch valueÃ¢ÂÂa assessment that Kauffmann likewise agrees with, expressing that having watched it twice he trusts "never to see it again: twice will be twice as much as any lifetime needs". Both Schickel and Andrew Sarris distinguish the movie's primary falling flat is in having a maker's reasonableness as opposed to a masterful one: having experienced such huge numbers of executives and journalists the movie does not convey a feeling of being "made" or "coordinated", but instead having risen "steaming from the packed kitchen", where the principle inventive power was a maker's fixation in making the film as truly devoted to the novel as could reasonably be expected. 

Sarris surrenders that in spite of its masterful failings, the film holds a command far and wide as the "absolute most cherished amusement at any point created". Judith Crist sees that, kitsch aside, the film is "without a doubt still the best and most strong bit of mainstream excitement to have fallen off the Hollywood sequential construction systems", the result of an artist with "taste and knowledge". Schlesinger takes note of that the principal half of the film has a "range and power" that try to its epic subject, butÃ¢ÂÂfinding concurrence with the film's contemporary criticismsÃ¢ÂÂthe individual lives take over in the second half, and it winds up losing its topic in unconvincing nostalgia. Kauffmann additionally finds fascinating parallels with "The Godfather", which had quite recently supplanted "Run with the Wind" as the most astounding grosser at the time: both were created from "ultra-American" top rated books, both live inside codes of respect that are romanticized, and both basically offer social manufacture or revisionism. 

The basic impression of the film has moved in the interceding years, which brought about it being positioned 235th in "Sight and Sound"s esteemed decennial pundits survey in 2012, and in 2015 sixty-two worldwide film faultfinders surveyed by the BBC casted a ballot it the 97th best American film. 

The film has highlighted in a few prominent industry surveys: in 1977 it was casted a ballot the most well known film by the American Film Institute (AFI), in a survey of the association's enrollment; the AFI likewise positioned the film fourth on its "100 Greatest Movies" list in 1998, with it descending to 6th spot in the tenth commemoration version in 2007. Movie chiefs positioned it 322nd in the 2012 release of the decennial "Sight and Sound" survey, and in 2016 it was chosen as the ninth best "directorial accomplishment" in a Directors Guild of America individuals survey. In 2014, it set fifteenth in a broad survey embraced by "The Hollywood Reporter", which ballotted each studio, office, exposure firm and creation house in the Hollywood district. "Run with the Wind" was chosen for safeguarding in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress in 1989 for being "socially, generally, or stylishly huge". 

"Run with the Wind" has been reprimanded as having sustained Civil War fantasies and dark generalizations. David Reynolds composes that "The white ladies are exquisite, their menfolk honorable or if nothing else dashing. What's more, out of sight, the dark slaves are generally obedient and content, plainly unequipped for an autonomous presence." Reynolds compared "Run with the Wind" to "The Birth of a Nation" and other reimaginings of the South amid the time of isolation, in which white Southerners are depicted as safeguarding customary qualities and the issue of servitude is to a great extent overlooked. The film has been portrayed as a "relapse" that advances the fantasy of the dark attacker and the decent and guarded job of the Ku Klux Klan amid Reconstruction, and as a "social purposeful publicity" film offering a "racial oppressor" perspective on the past. From 1972 to 1996, the Atlanta Historical Society held various "Run with the Wind" shows, among them a 1994 display titled, "Questioned Territories: "Run with the Wind" and Southern Myths". One of the inquiries investigated by the display was "The means by which True to Life Were the Slaves in GWTW?" This area indicated slave encounters were assorted and reasoned that the "upbeat darky" was a fantasy, similar to the conviction that all slaves experienced viciousness and severity. 

W. Bryan Rommel Ruiz has contended that regardless of accurate errors in its portrayal of the Reconstruction time frame, "Run with the Wind" by and by reflects contemporary understandings that were basic in the mid twentieth century. One such perspective is reflected in a concise scene in which Mammy battles off a sneering freedman: an administration authority can be heard offering fixes to the liberated slaves for their votes. The induction is taken to be that freedmen are oblivious about legislative issues and caught off guard for opportunity, accidentally turning into the apparatuses of degenerate Reconstruction authorities. While propagating some Lost Cause legends, the film makes concessions with respect to other people. After the assault on Scarlett in the shanty town, a gathering of men including Scarlett's significant other Frank, Rhett Butler and Ashley attack the town; in the novel they have a place with the Ku Klux Klan, speaking to the normal figure of speech of ensuring the white lady's ethicalness, yet the producers deliberately kill the nearness of the Klan in the film by alluding to it just as a "political gathering". 

Thomas Cripps reasons that the film in certain regards undermines racial generalizations; specifically, the film made more noteworthy commitment among Hollywood and dark crowds, with many motion pictures making little signals in acknowledgment of the developing pattern. Just half a month after its underlying run, a story supervisor at Warner composed a reminder to Walter Wanger about "Mississippi Belle", a content that contained the most exceedingly bad abundances of manor films, recommending that "Run with the Wind" had made the film "unproducible". More than any film since "The Birth of a Nation", it released an assortment of social powers that foreshadowed a partnership of white nonconformists and blacks who empowered the desire that blacks would one day accomplish uniformity. As per Cripps, the film in the end turned into a layout for estimating social change. 

In 2017, "Run with the Wind" was pulled from the calendar at the Orpheum Theater in Memphis, Tennessee following a 34-year keep running of yearly showings because of its apparent racially obtuse substance. 

A standout amongst the most infamous and generally denounced scenes in "Run with the Wind" portrays what is presently lawfully characterized as "conjugal assault". The scene starts with Scarlett and Rhett at the base of the staircase, where he starts to kiss her, declining to be told 'no' by the battling and alarmed Scarlett; Rhett beats her obstruction and conveys her up the stairs to the room, where the group of onlookers is left in most likely that she will "get what's going to her". The following scene, the next morning, indicates Scarlett shining with scarcely stifled sexual fulfillment; Rhett apologizes for his conduct, accusing his drinking. The scene has been blamed for consolidating sentiment and assault by making them unclear from one another, and of fortifying an idea about constrained sex: that ladies covertly appreciate it, and it is an adequate route for a man to treat his better half. 

Molly Haskell has contended that by and by, ladies are for the most part uncritical of the scene, and that all around it is predictable in light of what ladies have in the event that they fantasize about being assaulted. Their dreams rotate around affection and sentiment instead of constrained sex; they will expect that Scarlett was not a reluctant sexual accomplice and needed Rhett to step up to the plate and demand having sex. 

"Run with the Wind" and its creation have been unequivocally referenced, mocked, performed and broke down on various events over a scope of media, from contemporaneous works, for example, "Second Fiddle"Ã¢ÂÂa 1939 film ridiculing the "look for Scarlett"Ã¢ÂÂto current TV programs, for example, "The Simpsons". "The Scarlett O'Hara War" (a 1980 TV sensation of the throwing of Scarlett), "Evening glow and Magnolias" (a 2007 play by Ron Hutchinson that performs Ben Hecht's five-day re-compose of the content), and "Ran with the Wind!" (a sketch on "The Carol Burnett Show" that mocked the film in the consequence of its TV debut in 1976) are among the more significant instances of its suffering nearness in pop culture. It was additionally the subject of a 1988 narrative, "", itemizing the film's troublesome creation history. In 1990, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp portraying Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh grasping in a scene from the film. 

Following production of her novel, Margaret Mitchell was immersed with solicitations for a spin-off however professed to not have a thought of the end result for Scarlett and Rhett, and that she had "left them to their definitive destiny". Mitchell kept on opposing weight from Selznick and MGM to compose a continuation until her passing in 1949. In 1975, her sibling, Stephens Mitchell (who accepted control of her domain), approved a spin-off of be together delivered by MGM and Universal Studios on a financial plan of $12 million. Anne Edwards was dispatched to compose the continuation as a novel which would then be adjusted into a screenplay, and distributed related to the film's discharge. Edwards presented a 775-page original copy entitled "Tara, The Continuation of Gone with the Wind", set somewhere in the range of 1872 and 1882 concentrating on Scarlett's separation from Rhett; MGM was not happy with the story and the arrangement crumbled. 

The thought was resuscitated during the 1990s, when a continuation was at long last delivered in 1994, as a TV miniseries. "Scarlett" depended on the novel by Alexandra Ripley, itself a spin-off of Mitchell's book. English performers Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton were given a role as Scarlett and Rhett, and the arrangement pursues Scarlett's migration to Ireland after again getting to be pregnant by Rhett.
