Joseph Parry 

Joseph Parry (21 May 1841 Ã¢ÂÂ 17 February 1903) was a Welsh writer and performer. Conceived in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, he is best known as the writer of "Myfanwy" and the psalm tune "Aberystwyth", which the African melody "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika" is said to be founded on. Repel was additionally the principal Welshman to form a musical show; his organization, "Blodwen", was the main musical drama in the Welsh language. 

Naturally introduced to a substantial family, Parry left school to work in the neighborhood coal mineshafts when he was nine years old. He at that point got down to business at the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, where his dad was additionally utilized. In 1854 the family emigrated to the United States, settling at Danville, Pennsylvania, where Parry again discovered work at an iron works. 

In spite of the fact that Parry had an extraordinary enthusiasm for music, he had no chance to contemplate it until there was a brief conclusion of the Rough and Ready Iron Works. A portion of his associates were additionally artists, and they offered music exercises while the iron works was shut. Repel joined a music locate perusing class instructed by one of the men. He kept on contemplating concordance with another collaborator, and figured out how to peruse and compose while he was finding out about agreement. 

Repel before long started submitting pieces to eisteddfodau in Wales and the United States and winning honors. Amid an arrival visit to Wales for the National Eisteddfod at Llandudno, Parry was offered two music grants, yet was unfit to acknowledge because of family commitments. A reserve was built up for the help of Parry and his family while he examined music. 

Repel proceeded to get a Doctorate in Music from the University of Cambridge; he was the principal Welshman to get Bachelor's and Doctor's degrees in music from the University. He came back to Wales in 1874 to turn into the main Professor of Music at Aberystwyth University, later tolerating a situation at Cardiff University. 

Repel was conceived in Merthyr Tydfil in 1841, the seventh of eight offspring of Daniel and Elizabeth Parry (nÄÅ¡e Richards). The family was musically disposed, with all relatives singing in the house of prayer choir. Repel's mom, who performed at chapel capacities, was associated with her fine voice; two of Parry's sisters, Elizabeth and Jane, and a sibling, Henry, increased some unmistakable quality in the United States as vocalists. He left school at age nine to work in the mines as the family required the salary. Youthful Parry worked a 56-hour week for twelve and a half pence while at the mine. By age 12, Parry was working at the puddling heaters of the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, where his dad likewise worked. 

Repel's dad, Daniel, emigrated to the United States in 1853; the remainder of the family followed in 1854. Like his dad and sibling, Parry turned into a specialist at the Rough and Ready Iron Works in Danville, Pennsylvania. Danville had an extensive Welsh people group and he ended up associated with fortifying Welsh culture locally, going to the Congregational Chapel and the Sunday school. Repel additionally filled in as the organist for the Mahoning Presbyterian Church in Danville; the organ he played is still in administration. In spite of the fact that he had sung in chapel choirs in Wales and the United States, Parry got no formal music exercises until he was 17 and living in Danville. 

Repel's chance to examine music came as a brief conclusion of the iron works where he was utilized. Repel had the favorable luck to turned out to be well disposed with three individual laborers who were additionally performers. Amid rest periods, the three regularly would sing. Repel tuned in with enthusiasm at first, later participate. One of the men began a music locate perusing class while the iron works was shut; Parry joined this class and turned into a fine sight-peruser. His enthusiasm for agreement made him need to contemplate that moreover. One of his other associates consented to accept Parry as a student. Youthful Parry was unfit to peruse or compose at the time he started amicability ponders. The instructor quietly mixed perusing exercises with standards of concordance, and Parry rapidly wound up talented at both; the educator regularly thought that it was difficult to stay aware of his student. Amid this time, Parry additionally figured out how to play the harmonium. 

Repel contended in the eisteddfod at Utica in 1861, and took first prize for "Restraint Vocal March". Inquisitive regarding how his music would be gotten in his local Wales, in 1864, he sent a hymn to the National Eisteddfod of Wales at Llandudno. The adjudicators granted him first prize, trusting he was an expert performer. In 1865, Parry again arranged a section, yet this time he ventured out to the challenge in Aberystwyth. Repel's song of devotion section was lost in the post, so it couldn't be judged. Rather, he was given a seat in the Gorsedd and the title "Pencerdd America" ("Chief Musician of America"). 

Amid this visit, Parry and his companions who had went with him to Wales ventured to every part of the nation giving shows of Parry's own works. They were generally welcomed all through the land. Repel was offered the chance to consider for a year under Dr Davies of Swansea, trailed by a one-year grant at the Royal Academy of Music. He needed to decline the two ideas since he had a spouse and kid in the United States subject to him for help. By 1865, Parry's melodic capacity had turned out to be outstanding in Wales and in the United States. A store was built up to help Parry and his family while he examined music; gifts were gotten from the two nations. Repel supported his very own motivation by giving shows in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio. 

In August 1868 Parry and his family touched base in England, where he started a three-year learn at the Royal Academy of Music under William Sterndale Bennett and Manuel Garcia. Amid his last year of concentrate at the Royal Academy, Parry showed up before Queen Victoria multiple times, each time by her uncommon solicitation. The Queen made another solicitation of Parry each time he showed up: that he perform just works he had created. In 1871, Bennett persuaded Parry to enter University of Cambridge for a degree in music. While at Cambridge, Parry turned into the principal Welshman to take both the MusB and MusD there. Subsequent to procuring his four year certification, Parry and his family came back to Danville, where he worked a school of music for the following three years. At the point when Aberystwyth University set up a seat for music, it was offered to Parry; he moved his family back to Wales, turning into the college's first Professor of Music. 

Repel worked at Aberystwyth from 1874 to 1881. Notwithstanding his college obligations, Parry every now and again went as an adjudicator and directing shows of his structures. He got his Doctorate from Cambridge in 1878. At the time a hopeful was required to form a short oratorio and to have the work freely played out; the typical technique was to have one of the school Chapel Choirs play out the oratorio. Yet, Parry acquired the administrations of many Welsh vocalists; 100 made the trek to Cambridge to play out Parry's oratorio. At the point when Parry surrendered his situation at Aberystwyth University in 1880, he opened his very own foundation of music in the town. 

In 1881, the Parry family left Aberystwyth for Swansea, where Parry turned into the organist at Ebenezer Chapel and was leader of a melodic school he established. When he was offered a seat at Cardiff University in 1888, Parry and his family moved to the adjacent town of Penarth. He addressed and instructed at the college and was known as ""Y Doctor Mawr"" ("The Great Doctor"). Repel likewise acknowledged a situation as the organist at Christ Church Congregational Church in Penarth. 

Repel turned into a contender for vital of the Guildhall School of Music in 1896; the opening was because of the passing of Sir Joseph Barnby. Authorities of the city of Cardiff, associates and understudies at Cardiff University, just as Parry's previous educators composed letters to the School of Music Committee in help of his race to the position. There were 38 candidates for the position; the field was decreased to two applicants through a progression of votes by the Court of Common Council. Repel was never again under thought after the first round of decreases. He stayed at the college and proceeded with his work as an eisteddfod adjudicator, a conductor at Cymanfaoedd Canu, and as an entertainer and teacher all through Wales and the United States until the season of his demise. 

In 1861, Parry wedded Jane Thomas. She was the little girl of Welsh migrants and the sister of Gomer Thomas, who distributed a large number of Parry's initial pieces. The couple had three children and two little girls. The more seasoned kids were conceived when the family was all the while living in Danville; just Parry's most youthful tyke was conceived in Wales. Two of Parry's three children passed on after the family moved to Penarth. Repel's most youthful child, William, passed on in 1892; his most established child, Joseph Haydn, kicked the bucket two years after the fact. While the majority of Parry's kids are said to have had melodic ability, his oldest, Joseph Haydn, emulated his dad's example as an arranger and educator. 

Later in 1894, Parry and his significant other trusted an excursion to the US would help facilitate a portion of the trouble over the passings of their two children. Repel had last visited the United States on a vocal show visit in 1880. In spite of the fact that the Parrys would visit family, he trusted he ought to be accessible to the general population amid the visit since numerous individuals in the US had helped him monetarily when he was contemplating music in England. 

Repel requested that an old companion inform the Welsh people group in the United States that he would visit and would mediate at eisteddfodau, address or lead cymanfaoedd canu whenever wanted. The people group could organize Parry to visit by reaching Rev. Thomas Edwards of Edwardsville, Pennsylvania. Repel and his family visited numerous urban communities and towns in the eastern US and were energetically gotten wherever they went. He kept those back in Cardiff informed with respect to his movements through letters to "The Western Mail" which were printed by the paper. Repel's last adventure to the United States in 1898 incorporated a visit to Salt Lake City, where he mediated at the third Salt Lake eisteddfod which was held in the Mormon Tabernacle. His last real work, a musical show entitled "The Maid of Cefn Ydfa", debuted at the Grand Theater in Cardiff in late December 1902. 

Repel was known as a religious man and a diligent employee both at the iron works and at his art. Regardless of his acknowledgment in Wales and in the United States, he was not an affluent man. Repel had little bent for business. With his authorization, a board of his companions dealt with his issues, with Parry making organizations and his companions keeping an eye on the matter of productions. Since his arrangements depended fundamentally on Welsh subjects, a large number of Parry's companions trusted it would have been further bolstering his good fortune to have settled in London, where there were progressively cosmopolitan encounters to draw motivation from. In 1859, Parry and his family moved toward becoming natives of the United States; he was similarly pleased with being a Welshman and a United States resident. 

David Jenkins, who was an understudy and right hand to Parry at Aberystwyth, depicted him as imprudent and unfit to censure his very own works, too flighty to even consider being a decent conductor and unreasonably eager for everything except cutting edge understudies, yet with an innocent excitement, particularly for music. Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who additionally worked with Parry, likewise noticed his extraordinary excitement and depicted him as a man of incredible melodic capacity. 

Around about fourteen days before his passing, Parry turned out to be all of a sudden sick. The ailment was not kidding enough to warrant medical procedure. A task was performed and a full recuperation was normal. Some days after the medical procedure, it was important to play out a second task because of confusions. Repel built up a high fever from blood harming a couple of days after the second medical procedure. There was a slight rally, however Parry kept on having backslides and became consistently flimsier. Repel, who had arranged a voyage through Australia and the US for 1904, lay in his debilitated bed when "The Maid of Cefn Ydfa" was marked for exhibitions by three musical drama organizations; he was never ready to be recounted the uplifting news. Repel kicked the bucket at his Penarth home on 17 February 1903. His last creation was composed amid his last sickness a tribute to his better half, Jane, entitled "Dear Wife". 

Something like 7,000 individuals from all pieces of the nation assembled in Penarth for the memorial service of Joseph Parry. They lined the course from Parry's home to Christ Church, where the family adored and to the churchyard at St Augustine's. His family and companions were joined by authorities from the city of Cardiff, personnel and understudies from Cardiff University, delegates from the National Eisteddfod and numerous individuals from different choirs all through Wales. Pastors of different categories were additionally part of those assembled to pay regards to Parry. He was covered on the north side of St Augustine's Churchyard, Penarth. Repel's landmark is a marble segment finished by a lyre with seven strings, with the strings speaking to the individuals from Parry's family. Two of the seven strings of the lyre are broken to speak to the passings of his two children, who kicked the bucket before Parry. 

Soon after his demise, a national reserve was built up in Parry's name. This was intended to offer help for his widow, Jane, through a yearly annuity; any finances staying after Jane's passing were to be utilized to give a national music grant named for Parry. 

Repel was a productive writer; one of his initial works, "My Childhood Dreams", was distributed while he was living in Danville. Regardless of his propensity for making, the majority of his significant works were not economically effective. His oratorio, "Saul of Tarsus", was charged for the National Eisteddfod at Rhyl in 1892, and was to some degree effective. Repel and others believed it to be his best work; the issue with the oratorio was that it was hard to perform and that the score for the arrangement is 305 pages in length. 

Repel is accepted to have formed 27 complete works, among them ten musical dramas, five cantatas and two oratorios, just as endless melodies and songs. By the 1890s, Parry was adequately notable and was solicited to deliver numerous from his takes a shot at a commission premise. He managed an assortment of distributers for a portion of his works, while he distributed others himself. Repel distributed his musical show, "Blodwen", himself however the explanations behind this are not clear. He seems to have done less independently publishing during the 1890s. Some portion of the purpose behind this may have been the loss of his printing plates in the "Western Mail" flame of 1893. 

Amid Parry's lifetime, a significant number of his works stayed unpublished; the racks of his examination held heaps of compositions. A companion of Parry's conversed with him about the likelihood of losing the majority of his original copies if there was a flame and proposed Parry required a safe to store his compositions in. At the point when Parry said he couldn't bear to purchase a safe, the companion gave him one as a blessing. More than 100 years after his passing, one of his obscure works, "Te Deum", was found coincidentally in the National Library of Wales chronicles. 

After Parry's passing, the Welsh Congregational Church tried to buy the copyrights of every one of Parry's works and to distribute them. The congregation was fruitful in acquiring the copyright to "Aberystwyth" and in excess of 60 different songs and hymns composed by Parry. In 1916, Parry's widow, Jane, sold the rights to all works which Parry claimed the copyrights of to Snell and Sons, music distributers, for ÃÅ1150. 

The music, composed by Parry, was first distributed in 1879 by Stephen and Jones in "Trouble Lyfr Tonau air conditioning Emynau" (English tr. "Second Book of Tunes and Hymns"). It was matched with Charles Wesley's words, "Jesus, Lover of My Soul", and first sung at the English Congregational Church in Portland Street in Aberystwyth, where Parry functioned as an organist. 

Enoch Sontonga worked in a Methodist mission school close Johannesburg. Sontonga, similar to Parry, was a choirmaster; in 1897, he set new words to Parry's music and called the psalm "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika". Welsh ministers frequently conveyed different duplicates of hymn books to their African missions; it is trusted Parry's psalm achieved Africa as such. While Sontonga composed just a single stanza of verses and a tune for the melody, Samuel Mqhayi made seven additional stanzas in 1927. The tune turned into the national song of praise of South Africa and four other African countries. 

Repel's musical show, "Blodwen", was first performed in Aberystwyth's Temperance Hall on 21 May 1878, in spite of the fact that Parry did not distribute it until 1888, while at Swansea. This was the primary musical show composed by a Welsh writer and furthermore the main musical drama to be performed in Welsh. The musical show, with its lyrics composed by Richard Davies, is set amid the season of the Welsh RevoltÃ¢ÂÂthe last endeavor by the Welsh to save their autonomy. 

At the time, not many individuals in Wales had seen a musical drama, and they had no clue what it resembled. The musical drama programs gave clarifications, particularly that the vocalists would wear outfits however would not be acting. The individuals who were individuals from Welsh free thinker houses of worship required consolation this was not a dramatic exhibition, as acting and theaters were held in as much scorn as bars. Repel was brought up in the protester Annibynwyr Chapel and clung to the precepts of his confidence for as long as he can remember. Most of members in the principal execution of "Blodwen" were music understudies of Parry; his two more seasoned children were likewise part of the generation, playing piano and harmonium. Prior to the execution, Parry addressed the crowd. He rehashed what had been imprinted in the projects: that the members were not acting and disclosed to those accumulated what a musical show was. Notwithstanding this, there were some pastors who were not satisfied. 

Not long after the primary execution of "Blodwen", a neighborhood couple named their infant girl after the musical drama's champion. There were no recorded cases of any youngsters being named Blodwen until after the debut of Parry's musical show. Records demonstrate the incredible ubiquity of the name for young ladies and furthermore the fame of Howell, the name of the legend, for young men. The musical drama was effective, with a further 500 exhibitions worldwide by 1896. Regardless of the accomplishment of "Aberystwyth" and "Myfanwy", "Blodwen" appears to have been Parry's most famous work while he was living, 

While Parry is frequently thought of as the sole maker of the anthem, it was really crafted by three men. Sooner or later, Thomas Walter Price, a writer and columnist, distributed a sonnet in English called "Arabella". It is trusted that Parry composed the music before the Welsh expressions of "Myfanwy" were composed by Richard Davies. Repel's work was distributed in 1875, with Parry pitching all rights to the melody to a distributer for ÃÅ12. The tune was first performed at the main show of the Aberystwyth and University Musical Society on 28 May 1875, with Parry as the conductor. It remains a standard in collections of Welsh male choirs today. 

Edward-Rhys Harry remade Parry's setting of the "Te Deum" taken from the content of The Book of Common Prayer. The composition was found in the National Library of Wales files. Repel composed the original copy in 1863, while living in Danville. Harry revealed the original copy while exploring choral conventions at the library. He worked a year at deciphering the first Parry original copy. The London Welsh Chorale gave the work its reality premiÄÂ¨re execution under Harry at StGiles Cripplegate, Barbican, London on 14 July 2012. 

Repel was additionally engaged with music-related distributing. Starting in 1861, he was a standard giver of Tonic sol-fa material to the Welsh music diary, "Y cerddor Cymreig". Repel's work with making Tonic sol-fa available permitted everybody with an enthusiasm for choral work to take an interest. He altered "Cambrian Minstrelsie" (A National Collection of Welsh Songs) in 1893. He likewise arranged "Dr Parry's Book of Songs", which was his very own accumulation works, and stated "Elfenau Cerddoriaeth" ("Elements of Music"), a Welsh handbook on hypothesis, in 1888. In 1895, Parry went into a concurrence with an American music distributing firm, the John Church Company. The organization distributed a portion of Parry's melodies alongside English interpretations of ballads by Heinrich Heine. The interpretations were finished by artists of note, including James Thomson. Since it is dicey that Parry knew about Heine's work, there is the likelihood that Parry was dispatched by the organization to compose the melodies amid a broad US trip he had made the prior year. 

After his turn to Penarth, Parry wound up associated with reporting, composing customary sections for both "The Cardiff Times" and "The South Wales Weekly News". He additionally did some composition for "The Western Mail". In his later years, Parry composed a collection of memoirs which has been portrayed as erroneous; he never distributed the data. The National Library of Wales procured this original copy in 1935 from Edna Parry Waite, Parry's girl and his last enduring tyke. The National Library distributed Parry's compositions as a bilingual book, "The Little Hero-the Autobiography of Joseph Parry", in 2004. 

In 1947, another child of Merthyr Tydfil, Jack Jones, based his novel, "Off to Philadelphia in the Morning ", on the occasions in the life of Joseph Parry. The book turned into a BBC three-section introduction of a similar name in 1978. Jones never offered the book as anything aside from a work of fiction; regardless of this, a few parts of the novel have been confused as actuality. 

The centennial of Parry's demise was set apart by an outdoors show in Merthyr Tydfil's Cyfarthfa Park highlighting exhibitions of Parry's works. The show was recorded on 28 July 2002 by Welsh TV generation organization Avanti Media. It was communicated by S4C on 17 February 2003. An incredible granddaughter of Parry's, who was an expert musical drama vocalist, was available for the occasion. 

A song of praise Parry formed with the Rev. Robert David Thomas while living in Pennsylvania was performed without precedent for Wales to check the century of the author's demise. There was no record of the song of devotion, "Cymry Glan Americ", having been performed in Wales; it isn't sure if the work, which was composed on January 1, 1872 had ever been performed beforehand. A relative of Rev. Thomas found the arrangement and imparted the data to Geraint Jones, the director of the Trefor metal band. Jones and his band played out the song of praise on 28 May 2002 in Pwllheli at the century of the town corridor. 

In 2011 conductor Edward-Rhys Harry directed the all out reproduction of Parry's oratorio "Emmanuel", which was performed by Cor Bro Ogwr and The British Sinfonietta, led by Harry, in December of that year. In May 2013, "Emmanuel" was performed in the US out of the blue when Harry and CÄ'r Bro Ogwr performed in New York and Philadelphia. 

The bungalow at 4 Chapel Row, Merthyr Tydfil, where Parry was conceived, is presently open to general society as a historical center. The column of houses was joined to the Bethesda Chapel, where the family gone to administrations. There are two rooms upstairs with the kitchen and another room ground floor. The Parry family lived here with two guests until emigrating to the United States in 1854. 

The sanctuary and its connected houses were slated for devastation in 1977; endeavors by the neighborhood chamber and understudies from Cyfarthfa High School spared the column of bungalows, yet not the Bethesda Chapel. In 1979, the Merthyr Tydfil Heritage Trust opened the bungalow to general society. Presentations were introduced upstairs in 1986 and reclamation of the ground floor was finished in 1990. Repel's house was renovated in 2016 through assets from a neighborhood organization and was revived to the open start on what might have been the writer's 175th birthday celebration. The house is currently part of the Cyfarthfa Heritage Area. 

Repel is energetically recalled, especially at the Mahoning Presbyterian Church in Danville, where he filled in as organist and choirmaster. Each time he visited the US, Parry came back to the congregation to play the organ. The Susquehanna Valley Welsh Society holds a yearly Cymanfa Canu in his respect at the congregation on the Sunday closest his May 21 birthday. In 2007, the congregation's steeple was reestablished with assistance from the National Welsh American Foundation. The re-devotion of the congregation was hung on May 21, the birthday of Parry. A plaque has been set at one of his homes in Danville; the network denoted the centennial of his passing at the neighborhood Danville Festival by a dedication show of Parry's works.
