Footrest ironclad Mesudiye 

Mesudiye (Ottoman Turkish: Happiness) was a focal battery ironclad of the Ottoman Navy, one of the biggest boats of that type at any point manufactured. She was worked at the Thames Iron Works in Britain somewhere in the range of 1871 and 1875. "Mesudiye" had one sister deliver, however she was obtained by the Royal Navy and appointed as . Her essential deadly implement comprised of twelve weapons in a focal heavily clad battery. 

"Mesudiye" was inadequately kept up for a large portion of her profession, including a twenty-year extensive stretch between the Russo-Turkish War in 1877Ã¢ÂÂ78 and the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. Subsequently, she was in extremely poor condition by the late 1890s, which incited a noteworthy remaking of her into a pre-gunboat configuration type vessel in Genoa. The ship's deadly implement was updated, however the firearm turrets that were to have mounted firearms never gotten the weapons. Another drive framework was additionally introduced, which essentially improved execution. 

The ship saw broad activity amid the First Balkan War in 1912Ã¢ÂÂ13, including the clashes of Elli and Lemnos in December 1912 and January 1913, separately. Amid the last commitment, she was severely harmed by a Greek shell and compelled to pull back. Following the episode of World War I in 1914, "Mesudiye" was secured at Nara to ensure the minefields that obstructed the passageway to the Dardanelles. On the morning of 13 December, the British submarine went through the minefields and torpedoed "Mesudiye", which rapidly sank. A large portion of the team endure, be that as it may, and a considerable lot of her weapons were rescued and used to fortify the resistances of the Dardanelles. A battery of these firearms, named Mesudiye out of appreciation for the ship, sank the French warship in March 1915. 

In the outcome of the Crimean War, where a whole Ottoman squadron was wrecked by a Russian armada at Sinop, the Ottoman Empire started a maritime development program, constrained principally by the incessantly feeble Ottoman economy. A few ironclad warships were requested during the 1870s, principally from British and French shipyards. Notwithstanding the deficiency of assets, by the late 1870s, the Ottomans had gained an armada of thirteen extensive ironclads and nine littler shielded warships. "Mesudiye" was structured by Edward Reed, who put together the plan with respect to the as of late form British ironclad . 

"Mesudiye" was long, and she had a light emission a draft of . She dislodged as initially constructed. Her structure was built with iron, and was fitted with a slam bow. She had a group of 700Ã¢Â officers and enrolled men. 

The ship was fueled by a solitary even, two-chamber compound motor, with steam given by eight coal-terminated box boilers. The boilers were trunked into a couple of pipes found amidships. The motors were evaluated at and delivered a top speed of . By 1884, many years of poor support had decreased her top speed to . She conveyed of coal. Albeit expected to work basically by means of her steam motor, "Mesudiye" was likewise fitted with three poles and a barque rig. 

"Mesudiye" was furnished with a principle battery of twelve RML 10 inch 18 ton weapons, all mounted in a focal battery. Six were on each side, with four on the broadside, one calculated forward and the other calculated rearward. She was likewise furnished with three RML 7 inch weapons, all on the upper deck, with two forward and one toward the back. In 1891, six brisk discharging weapons (QF) and six QF firearms were introduced. 

Reinforcement assurance comprised of iron plate; the shielded belt had a most extreme thickness of in the focal part of the ship, where it secured apparatus and ammo magazines, and was diminished on either end, first to and afterward to 76Ã¢Â mm. The thickest piece of the belt stretched out beneath the waterline or more the line, and was made out of three strakes. The center strake was the thickest, the upper strake was diminished marginally to , and the lower one was and decreased to . The firearm battery was secured by another two strakes of shield, the lower being 254Ã¢Â mm thick and the upper decreased to . 

"Mesudiye" was requested in 1871 and was set down at the Thames Iron Works shipyard in London the next year. She was propelled on 28 October 1874 and was appointed in December 1875 for ocean preliminaries. She had one sister transport, "MahmÄÅ¥diye", which was renamed "Hamidiye" while under development. She was bought by the Royal Navy before finish and dispatched as . "Mesudiye" and "Sublime" were the biggest casemate ironclads at any point assembled. In September 1876, "Mesudiye" turned into the lead of the Ottoman Black Sea Squadron, however she didn't see activity in the Russo-Turkish War that broke out in April 1877. 

After the Ottoman annihilation, the armada was laid up at the Golden Horn and left to a great extent unattended for the accompanying twenty years. Amid this time of latency, "Mesudiye" got a minor modernization at the TersÄËne-I ÄÂmire shipyard on the Golden Horn. Toward the beginning of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, "Mesudiye" was observed to be unfit for battle, as were the vast majority of the other significant warships of the armada. On 15 May "Mesudiye" and a few different warships endeavored to hold a preparation work out, which just featured the poor condition of preparing of the boats' groups. 

Following the finish of the war, the administration chose to start a maritime reproduction program. The main stage was to remake the more seasoned reinforced warships, including "Mesudiye". Solicitations for proposition were sent to remote shipyards, and in October 1898 the Gio. Ansaldo and C. shipyard in Genoa mentioned consent to review the ship and the ironclad . The two vessels were appropriately sent to Genoa in January 1899, touching base on the 28th, however Ansaldo just got the agreement for "Mesudiye". "Mesudiye" was revamped into a pre-man of war type vessel. 

The modernization included radical remaking of the body; the bow and stern were chopped down to account for a couple of firearm turrets, each mounting a solitary 40-gauge weapon fabricated by Vickers. The turrets had 230Ã¢Â mm thick heavily clad countenances, however they never got their firearms; wooden sham weapons were introduced in their place. A battery of twelve 45-gauge QF firearms was introduced instead of the old rifled gag loaders, and sixteen 76Ã¢Â mm QF weapons were included an upper battery. "Mesudiye" likewise gotten ten firearms and a couple of weapons. 

A substantial superstructure was fabricated amidships, with another conning tower, which was given of protection plating. Relocation rose to typically and at full burden. The ship's drive framework was additionally totally supplanted. Two triple-development motors were introduced, alongside sixteen coal-terminated Niclausse boilers. The two screw propellers covered, so the port side screw was put marginally in front of the starboard one. Execution improved to and . Her group expanded to 800 because of the adjustments. On 15 March 1904, "Mesudiye" finished ocean preliminaries and from that point came back to Constantinople. 

In 1909, she partook in the principal armada move directed by the Ottoman Navy in twenty years, some portion of a change program started by a British maritime mission to the Ottoman Empire. Beginning in July 1911, "Mesudiye" joined the two pre-gunboats and , four destroyers, and a torpedo vessel for a progression of activities that finished in the normal summer journey to Beirut. The armada was coming back to Constantinople when Italy pronounced war, beginning the Italo-Turkish War on 29 September 1911. "Mesudiye" and the remainder of the armada secured at Nagara Point on 2 October and came back to Constantinople the next day. "Mesudiye" was from that point doled out to the Reserve Division, which likewise incorporated the reconstructed ironclad "ÄÂsÄËr-ÃÄ Tevfik" and the torpedo cruiser . She didn't see activity amid the contention, since the Ottoman armada spent the war in port. This was to some extent because of the rising pressures in the Balkans that forecasted the Balkan Wars; the Ottomans kept their armada in port so it could be set up for the unavoidable clash. 

In October 1912, the Balkan League announced war on the Ottomans, a month prior to the Italo-Turkish War finished. At the time, "Mesudiye" was secured off BÄÅºyÄÅºkdere, an area in Constantinople, with the torpedo pontoons and , positioned as a gatekeeper dispatch. In December, the Ottoman armada was redesigned, with "Mesudiye" joining the recently framed Battleship Division, under the direction of Ramiz Naman Bey. The division likewise included "Barbaros Hayreddin", "Turgut Reis", and "ÄÂsÄËr-ÃÄ Tevfik". The ship was moved to BÄÅºyÄÅºkÄÂ§ekmece on 15 November, where she joined the remainder of the armada. After two days, "Mesudiye" and "Barbaros Hayreddin" led shore bombardments in help of the Ottoman troops holding the ÄÂatalca Line; the bombardments did not cause especially huge material harm to the assaulting Bulgarians, however it boosted Ottoman confidence. 

The boats partook in the Battle of Elli, the primary Ottoman surface activity including significant warships since the Russo-Turkish War, on 16 December 1912. The Ottoman armada sortied from the Dardanelles at 9:30; the littler art stayed at the mouth of the straits while the warships cruised north, embracing the coast. The Greek flotilla, which incorporated the heavily clad cruiser and three s, cruising from the island of Lemnos, modified course toward the upper east to hinder the development of the Ottoman ships. The Ottoman boats opened flame on the Greeks at 9:40, from a scope of about . After five minutes, "Georgios Averof" traversed to the opposite side of the Ottoman armada, putting the Ottomans in the negative position of being enduring an onslaught from the two sides. 

At 9:50 and under overwhelming weight from the Greek armada, the Ottoman boats finished a 16-point turn, which switched their course, and set out toward the security of the straits. The turn was ineffectively led, and the boats dropped out of development, obstructing each other's fields of flame. "Barbaros Hayreddin", "Turgut Reis", and "Mesudiye" endured a few shots amid the fight, however just "Barbaros Hayreddin" was essentially harmed. By 10:17, the two sides had stopped terminating and the Ottoman armada pulled back into the Dardanelles. When they moved toward the straits, "Mesudiye" and "ÄÂsÄËr-ÃÄ Tevfik" took up positions to cover the withdrawal of the harmed pre-gunboats. The boats achieved port by 13:00 and exchanged their setbacks to the emergency clinic transport "Resit PaÄºÂa". 

In late December, the Ottomans started a crusade of attacks and watches in the Aegean Sea against the islands that had been as of late vanquished by the Greeks. The Ottoman Army started wanting to make an arrival on Tenedos in late December, which had been caught by Greece before in the war. "Mesudiye" and the remainder of the Battleship Division sortied from the Dardanelles on the morning of 4 January 1913, however the activity was canceled after the Greek armada showed up. On 10 January, the armada left on another hostile activity, this opportunity to strike the island of Imbros. After a concise, uncertain conflict with Greek destroyers, the armada again pulled back to the wellbeing of the Dardanelles. After eight days, another armada task started, which created the Battle of Lemnos, the second major maritime commitment of the war. Stool intend to draw the quicker "Georgios Averof" far from the Dardanelles. The secured cruiser dodged the Greek bar and broke out into the Aegean Sea trying to draw the Greek cruiser into interest. In spite of the risk presented by the cruiser, the Greek authority would not disconnect "Georgios Averof". 

The Ottoman armada left the Dardanelles at 8:20 on the morning of 18 January, and cruised toward the island of Lemnos at a speed of . "Barbaros Hayreddin" drove the line of ships, with a flotilla of torpedo pontoons on either side of the development. A long range mounted guns duel that went on for two hours started at around 11:55, when the Ottoman armada opened discharge at a scope of . They focused their flame on the Greek "Georgios Averof", which returned fire at 12:00. At 12:50, the Greeks endeavored to cross the T of the Ottoman armada, yet "Barbaros Hayreddin" swung north to obstruct the Greek move. At around that time, "Mesudiye" endured a genuine shot that incapacitated three of her 150Ã¢Â mm weapons; this harm, combined with heater inconvenience, drove the Ottoman officer to separate the ship and send her back to port. 

On 5 February, "Mesudiye" bolstered tasks off Ä¹ÂarkÄÅy in the Sea of Marmara, barraging Bulgarian troops that had involved the town. This was the last wartime activity directed by the ship; she didn't take an interest in the land and/or water capable attack on Ä¹ÂarkÄÅy three days after the fact. The Ottoman armada at that point spent the rest of the months of the war in port, until the peace negotiation finished the contention in April. 

In late July 1914, World War I broke out in Europe, however the Ottomans at first stayed unbiased. On 6 September 1914, "Mesudiye" was sent to Nara to secure the minefields guarding the passage to the Dardanelles. She was bolstered by the minelayer and the pull . Strains between the Ottomans and a British armada watching the passageway to the Dardanelles expanded until 5 November, when Britain and France announced war on the Ottoman Empire. 

On the morning of 13 December, the British submarine , told by Lieutenant Norman Holbrook, entered the Dardanelles. At around 11:30, she spotted "Mesudiye" at grapple and terminated a solitary torpedo from a separation of . The torpedo hit the ship's stern and caused genuine harm; "Mesudiye"s weapons quickly discharged at "B11"s periscope before the ship inverted and sank in shallow water. Setbacks were light, with just 10Ã¢Â officers and 27Ã¢Â enlisted men slaughtered in the assault. A rescue exertion expelled the 150Ã¢Â mm and 76Ã¢Â mm firearms, which were utilized to fortify the resistances of the Dardanelles. Meanwhile, "B11" effectively gone back through the Dardanelles and came back to port; Holbrook was granted the Victoria Cross for sinking "Mesudiye". 

"Mesudiye"s rescued 150Ã¢Â mm firearms were introduced as "Battery Mesudiye" in the Dardanelles. These weapons assumed a job in the sinking of the French war vessel on 18 March 1915, having hit the ship eight timesÃ¢ÂÂone of which impaired her forward turretÃ¢ÂÂbefore she struck a mine and sank with extremely substantial death toll.
