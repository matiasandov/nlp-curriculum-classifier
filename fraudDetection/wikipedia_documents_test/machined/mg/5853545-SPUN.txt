STS-125 

STS-125, or HST-SM4 (Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission 4), was the fifth and last space transport mission to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). 

The dispatch of the Space Shuttle "Atlantis" happened on 11 May 2009 at 2:01Ã¢Â pm EDT. Landing happened on 24 May at 11:39Ã¢Â am EDT, with the mission enduring an aggregate of just shy of 13 days. 

The group of STS-125 included three space explorers who had past experience overhauling Hubble. 

Scott Altman visited Hubble in 2002 as administrator of STS-109, the fourth Hubble adjusting mission. John Grunsfeld, a stargazer, has overhauled Hubble twice, playing out a sum of five spacewalks on STS-103 of every 1999 and STS-109. Michael Massimino presented with both Altman and Grunsfeld on STS-109, and performed two spacewalks to support the telescope. 

NASA supervisors and specialists proclaimed the mission a total achievement. The fulfillment of all the real destinations, just as some that were not viewed as essential, overhauled the Hubble telescope to its most innovatively propelled state since its dispatch nineteen years prior and made it all the more dominant. The updates helped Hubble to see further into the universe and more distant into the past, closer to the season of the Big Bang. 

STS-125 was the main visit to the Hubble Space Telescope for "Atlantis"; the telescope had been recently adjusted twice by "Disclosure" and once each by "Columbia" and "Try". The mission was the 30th trip of Space Shuttle "Atlantis" and furthermore the first by "Atlantis" in more than 14 years not to visit a space station, the last one being STS-66. 

The fifth adjusting mission to Hubble, HST-SM4, was initially booked to dispatch in late 2005 or mid 2006. On 16 January 2004, at that point NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe dropped the mission, just as any future missions to Hubble, refering to security requirements forced by the "Columbia" Accident Investigation Board. Amid the declaration, O'Keefe expressed that it was his choice alone, and not a proposal from some other divisions. The choice was broadly censured by the media, the science network, and those in NASA. Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, an individual from the Senate subcommittee that directs NASA's financial plan, freely blamed O'Keefe for settling on a choice outside the straightforwardness procedure against the desires of the science network, and expressed she would work to switch the choice. In March 2004, Representative Mark Udall acquainted a bill with the House of Representatives that mentioned an autonomous board of specialists survey O'Keefe's choice to drop the adjusting mission. Likewise in March 2004, Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Director Stephen Beckwith discharged the aftereffects of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field overview to the whole science network, which helped demonstrate the open how imperative Hubble was to science. The information demonstrated the most profound pictures at any point taken by a telescope and uncovered around 10,000 systems, some of which in all probability dated back to when the universe was only five hundred million years of age. With Beckwith when he discharged the information to established researchers was Mikulski, who said of the outcomes, "I believe it's simply stunning... this is the reason I will keep on going to bat for Hubble." 

Joining Mikulski as a backer for overhauling Hubble was NASA's Chief Scientist, physicist John Grunsfeld, who was available at the gathering when O'Keefe reported the undoing of the mission. A veteran space explorer of four transport missions, including two Hubble adjusting missions, Grunsfeld had committed a long time to Hubble, and was extremely baffled when O'Keefe dropped the mission. He quickly thought to be resigning from NASA, however acknowledged whether he stayed, he could keep on propelling material science in different ways. Rather, Grunsfeld devoted himself to discovering substitute approaches to support the telescope, perhaps by sending a robot into space to carry out the responsibility. At the point when O'Keefe reported his renunciation as Administrator in December 2004, five days after a National Academy of Sciences board restricted O'Keefe's position with respect to adjusting Hubble, the media and science network saw trust in the telescope's overhauling mission to be reestablished. 

O'Keefe's substitution, Michael D. Griffin, took only two months after his arrangement to declare that he couldn't help contradicting O'Keefe's choice, and would think about sending a van to fix Hubble. As a specialist, Griffin had recently dealt with Hubble's development, and regarded the disclosures the telescope conveyed to the science network. He concurred with the National Academy of Sciences that an automated mission was not doable, and said that in light of the "Arrival to Flight" changes made after the "Columbia" mishap, a van mission to fix Hubble ought to be reassessed. After the triumphs of the Return to Flight STS-114 and STS-121 missions, and the exercises scholarly and upgrades made after those missions, directors and architects attempted to figure an arrangement that would enable the bus to support Hubble, while as yet holding fast to the post-"Columbia" wellbeing necessities. 

On 31 October 2006, Griffin reported that the Hubble adjusting mission was restored, booked for 2008, and declared the team that would fly the mission, which included Grunsfeld. Representative Mikulski communicated her joy at the news, expressing "The Hubble telescope has been the best telescope since Galileo designed the first. It has gone to take a gander at spots known to mankind that we didn't know existed previously." 

New Yorker and devoted New York Mets fan, Mike Massimino, brought the home plate from Shea Stadium along on the mission. He was compelled to marginally adjust the plate to enable it to fit into the storage assigned for memorabilia. Massimino displayed the plate back to the Mets the executives upon return and tossed out the primary pitch there. The plate is presently in plain view at Citi Field. 

The mission added two new instruments to Hubble. The main instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, is currently the most delicate bright spectrograph introduced on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is multiple times more delicate than past instruments and the close UV is twice as touchy. The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a panchromatic wide-field camera that can record a wide scope of wavelengths, including infrared, obvious, and bright light. "Atlantis" likewise conveyed the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was introduced onto the telescope. 

This will empower a shuttle to be sent to the telescope to aid its sheltered de-circle toward a mind-blowing finish. It is a round component containing structures and focuses to help docking. 

The framework of the telescope was updated by supplanting a "Fine Guidance Sensor" that controls the telescope's directional framework, introducing a lot of six new spinners, supplanting batteries, and introducing another external cover layer to give improved protection. 

The payload straight components were the Super Lightweight Interchangeable Carrier (SLIC) which held the Wide Field Camera 3, new batteries, and a radiator; the ORU Carrier which put away the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and FGS-3R instruments; the Flight Support Structure (FSS) which clutched the Hubble amid fixes; the Multi-Use Lightweight Equipment Carrier (MULE) which held help hardware and the Relative Navigation Sensor (RNS) Experiment. 

Alongside the collectible things that are flown on transport missions, for example, mission patches, banners, and other individual things for the group, were an official Harlem Globetrotters b-ball and a b-ball that Edwin Hubble utilized in 1909 when he played for the University of Chicago. In the wake of being come back to Earth, the Harlem Globetrotters b-ball would be set in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and Hubble's ball would be come back to the University of Chicago. Michael Massimino flew a 1964 reproduce of Galileo's "Sidereus Nuncius" from the library of his institute of matriculation, MIT. 

Toward the finish of September 2007, Warner Bros. Pictures and IMAX Corporation declared that in collaboration with NASA, an IMAX 3D camera would make a trip to the Hubble telescope in the payload cove of "Atlantis" for creation of another film that will account the tale of the Hubble telescope. An IMAX camera was additionally positioned at the LC-39 Press Site for the dispatch. IMAX has made various motion pictures revolved around space, including "Fate in Space", "The Dream Is Alive", "Mission to Mir", "Blue Planet", "", and "Space Station 3D", made in 2001 on the main trek of IMAX to the ISS. The motion picture was discharged in March 2010, with the name "IMAX: Hubble 3D". 

Space traveler Michael J. Massimino utilized Twitter to archive the preparation and arrangements for the mission. He referenced that he might want to have a go at sending Twitter refreshes from space amid his on furlough time. 

Massimino's first update read, "From circle: Launch was marvelous!! I am feeling extraordinary, buckling down, and appreciating the glorious perspectives, an incredible experience has started!". Massimino was the principal individual to utilize Twitter in space. 

The mission checked: 

STS-125 was first doled out to "Revelation" with a dispatch date no sooner than May 2008. This initially propelled the mission of STS-119, ISS Assembly flight 15. Deferrals to a few transport missions brought about an adjustment in mission requesting, and the orbiter was changed to "Atlantis" on 8 January 2007. The team of "Atlantis" went to the Kennedy Space Center for the Crew Equipment Interface Test toward the beginning of July 2008. This permitted the STS-125 group to get acquainted with the orbiter and the equipment they would use amid the flight. 

On 22 August 2008, after a defer following Tropical Storm Fay, "Atlantis" was moved from the Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building, where it was mated to the outside fuel tank and strong rocket supporter stack. Issues were experienced amid the mating procedure, and poor climate because of Hurricane Hanna caused a deferral in the rollout of "Atlantis" to the platform, which is ordinarily completed seven days after rollover. 

STS-125 was additionally pushed back to October 2008 because of assembling delays on outside tanks for future space transport missions. Lockheed Martin experienced deferrals amid the creation changes to make new outer tanks with every one of the improvements prescribed by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, making it incomprehensible for them to deliver two tanks for the STS-125 missionÃ¢ÂÂone for "Atlantis", and one for "Attempt" for a crisis salvage mission, if necessaryÃ¢ÂÂin time for the first August dispatch date. 

The first rollout to Launch Pad 39A happened on 4 September 2008. On 27 September, the Science Instrument Command and Data Handling (SIC&DH) Unit on the Hubble Space Telescope fizzled. In view of its significance to the telescope, NASA delayed the dispatch of STS-125 on 29 September until 2009 so the fizzled unit could be supplanted too. "Atlantis" was moved back to the Vehicle Assembly Building on 20 October. 

On 30 October 2008, NASA declared that "Atlantis" would be expelled from its strong rocket promoters and outside tank stack and sent back to the Orbiter Processing Facility to anticipate a focused on dispatch time at 1:11Ã¢Â pm EDT on 12 May 2009. The stack was swung over to be utilized on the STS-119 mission. On 23 March, "Atlantis" was mated to its new stack in the Vehicle Assembly Building, and took off to Launch Pad 39A on 31 March. On 24 April 2009, NASA administrators issued a solicitation to move the STS-125 dispatch up one day to 11 May at 2:01Ã¢Â pm EDT. The change was made authority at the flight status audit on 30 April. 

The reason refered to for the change was to add one more day to the dispatch window, from a few days. 

Following a smooth commencement, "Atlantis" propelled on time at 2:01Ã¢Â pm EDT. 

Very quickly after dispatch and amid the climb, flight frameworks detailed issues with a hydrogen tank transducer and an electrical switch; the group was promptly encouraged to slight the resultant cautions and keep on orbitting. 

Amid the post-dispatch news meeting, NASA chiefs said the underlying early survey of the dispatch video demonstrated no conspicuous flotsam and jetsam occasions, yet an intensive investigation would be performed to guarantee the orbiter supported no huge harm amid rising. 

In the wake of working through their post dispatch agendas, the group opened the payload inlet entryways, conveyed the Ku band reception apparatus, and moved into the mechanical exercises segment of the day, which incorporated a study of the payload cove and team lodge review with the orbiter's automated arm. 

Amid the post-dispatch investigation of Launch Pad 39A, a twenty-five foot zone on the north side of the fire diverter was found to have harm where a portion of the warmth safe covering fell off. 

Following the dispatch of STS-124, extreme harm was seen at the cushion where blocks were impacted from the dividers, however NASA authorities expressed the harm from the STS-125 dispatch was not so serious and ought not affect the dispatch of STS-127 in June. 

Following the morning reminder, the team started take a shot at the day's undertakings, which were focused on assessment of the orbiter's warmth shield. Utilizing the van automated arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the team experienced a point by point review of the orbiter's warm security framework (TPS) tile and Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) surfaces. Amid the examination, designs on the ground saw a little zone of tile on the forward region of the bus' conservative that seemed to have endured some harm amid climb. 

Mission administrators called up to the group to caution them of the find, exhorting Altman ("Scooter") that one of the orbiter's wing driving edge sensors recorded a trash occasion amid climb, around 104 Ã¢ÂÂ 106 seconds following liftoff, which may have been the reason for the harm found here. 

CAPCOM Dan Burbank exhorted the group that the harm did not at first seem, by all accounts, to be not kidding, however guaranteed the group that the picture examination group would survey the symbolism further, and designs on the ground would break down it to decide whether an engaged investigation would be required. 

As a major aspect of the Flight Day 2 Execute Package, ground builds likewise given additional data on the electrical switch disappointment seen at dispatch. 

The breaker (Channel 1 Aerosurfaces, ASA 1) is a piece of the bus' Flight Control Systems (FCS), a subsystem of the direction, route, and control (GNC) frameworks. The disappointment would have no effect to the mission, because of excess frameworks. 

Notwithstanding the overview of the orbiter's warmth shield, the team accumulated and examined the EVA instruments and spacesuits that would be utilized for the mission's spacewalks and arranged the Flight Support System (FSS) for berthing with Hubble on flight day three. 

Following the team's post-rest exercises, they got down to business playing out the meeting activities that included consuming the orbiter's motors to refine the way to deal with the Hubble telescope. Following some postponements because of interchanges issues, Altman and Johnson ("Ray-J") guided the orbiter inside fifty feet of the telescope. McArthur effectively caught Hubble at 17:14 UTC, and at 18:12 the telescope was securely berthed in the payload cove of "Atlantis". Later in the day, Grunsfeld and Feustel (Drew), alongside Good ("Bueno") and Massimino ("Mass") chipped away at getting ready for the following day's spacewalk, gathering apparatuses and looking at the suits and hardware that would be utilized amid the EVA. 

At the Mission Management Team (MMT) preparation, MMT Chairman LeRoy Cain announced that the harm appraisal group had cleared the majority of the orbiter's TPS tiles and covers, and were relied upon to clear the RCC part of the orbiter by flight day four. He expressed that no engaged investigation would be required. Cain additionally noticed that a trash occasion was recorded on the orbiter's wing driving edge sensors, yet it was far beneath the power that would show an issue, and would not affect the mission. The late examination that is routinely performed before reentry would give any extra data, however Cain expressed "We're not worried that it's done any sort of harm that would be any worry to us, surely not basic harm." 

Amid the Mission Status instructions, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci noticed that amid the camera overview of the hardware in the payload inlet, the group saw some fine particulate issue around the container containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and requested that the team take extra pictures utilizing a higher goals camera for the ground groups to evaluate. Cain later affirmed that the residue was absent before dispatch, and was undoubtedly particulate shaken free from the thick protection covers inside the payload straight amid dispatch. The group exhorted the team to evade the particulate however much as could reasonably be expected amid the spacewalks, and use alert when working around the holder to maintain a strategic distance from the garbage, yet it was anything but a huge concern. 

Following the team's wake up, they set to work getting ready for the mission's initially spacewalk. Grunsfeld and Feustel fit up with the help of their EVA partners, Massimino and Good, and the spacewalk authoritatively started when the two changed their suits to battery control at 12:52 UTC. Toward the beginning of the spacewalk, Feustel furnished supervisors on the ground with a visual investigation report on the particulate issue seen before around the WFC3 box, answering to the ground group that "I don't generally observe any of those particles...It's practically imperceivable. I can see approximately couple of particles on the facade of the W-SIPE, little, whitish, dim looking, genuine little. It's low thickness, as well." After getting their instruments and gear for the EVA set up, Grunsfeld and Feustel expelled the old Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, which was introduced in 1993 amid the telescope's first overhauling mission, and supplanted it with the new Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). Feustel at first experienced difficulty expelling the jolts from the old camera, which after more than fifteen years in space required more torque to evacuate than anticipated. After numerous endeavors, directors on the ground chose to have Grunsfeld get a possibility torque limiter from the airtight chamber, which would permit Feustel to apply more power without surpassing a particular point, however the jolt would in any case not discharge. The worry was that the jolt would shear, and the camera would be unfit to be evacuated should that occur. At long last, chiefs affirmed Feustel to expel the limiter, and apply as much power as he securely suspected it would take to discharge the jolt, which was fruitful. 

The new camera has enabled Hubble to take extensive scale, amazingly clear and point by point photographs over a more extensive scope of hues than the old camera. After the establishment, controllers at the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center sent directions to the camera to play out an aliveness test, which passed, demonstrating the camera was introduced accurately. 

The following errand was to evacuate and supplant the telescope's Science Instrument Command and Data Handling Unit, or SIC&DH, a PC that sends directions to Hubble's science instruments, and configurations science information for transmission to the ground. This was the thing that bombed in September 2008, postponing STS-125 while engineers arranged a new part for the mission, and the team prepared for the new errand. While the disappointment of the SIC&DH did not handicap the telescope, supplanting the unit reestablishes the redundancies. The last real errand was to introduce the Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM), which incorporates the Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) that will enable shuttle later on to dock with the telescope, and to securely de-circle the telescope toward an incredible finish. Feustel likewise introduced two of four Latch Over Center Kits, or LOCKs, that make opening and shutting Hubble's vast access entryways simpler for the remaining spacewalks. The spacewalk authoritatively finished at 20:12 UTC, for a period of seven hours and twenty minutes. It was the nineteenth spacewalk given to adjusting the telescope, and acquired the absolute time overhauling Hubble to one hundred thirty-six hours, thirty minutes. Because of the length of the spacewalk, and the deferral in starting, the team was over an hour behind their planned course of events throughout the afternoon, however worked through the post-EVA exercises and night exercises without issues, and got the opportunity to rest just somewhat behind their booked time. Amid the mission status preparation, David Leckrone, Hubble Project Senior Scientist, noted he was exceptionally alleviated that the camera was supplanted effectively, and noticed that the issues with the jolt caused some worry, "I don't typically uncover my age and I'm not going to here, yet I can reveal to you I'm five years more established now than I was the point at which I came to work at the beginning of today, we can rest quite well this evening, realizing that has been cultivated." 

Following their wake up, the "Atlantis" group set ideal to work planning for the second spacewalk of the mission, with Massimino and Good fitting up with help from Grunsfeld and Feustel. As they were getting ready for the EVA, the group on the ground educated the team that the WFC3 had breezed through all the medium-term practical tests, showing it was in great working request. 

While the spacewalk arrangements were in progress, Altman and McArthur finished an automated review of a little line of warmth shield tiles that had not been adequately imaged amid the day two investigation. Following the investigation of the review, the administrators cleared the majority of the TPS frameworks until the pre-landing assessment. 

The mission's second spacewalk authoritatively started at 12:49 UTC, and the pair set to work evacuating and supplanting the telescope's three spinner rate detecting units (RSUs). Every unit contains two whirligigs that enable the telescope to point itself. The primary unit, RSU 2, was supplanted without issues, however when they endeavored to supplant the second unit, RSU 3, the unit would not adjust onto the guide pins, and they couldn't situate it into the hardware straight. Supervisors chose to put the unit initially proposed for the RSU 1 inlet into the RSU 3 narrows, and it was introduced without issues. The pair at that point endeavored to introduce the second unit into the third and last straight, yet the unit again would not situate legitimately, and they were unfit to introduce it. Rather, it was chosen that an extra unit conveyed as an extra would be set into the last narrows. The extra unit was one that was expelled amid the STS-103 mission, and had been revamped on the ground. The establishment of every one of the three gyro units was a basic target of the overhauling mission, as three had fizzled, one was disconnected because of electrical issues, and the other two had additionally been encountering issues with execution. Ground controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center affirmed that every one of the six gyrators and the new battery breezed through starter tests. 

The issues with seating the second RSU set the spacewalkers back in the course of events by around two hours, yet after Altman asked Massimino and Good how they believed, they answered they were progressing admirably and felt fine to proceed. Flight controllers on the ground assessed the consumables for the two spacesuits, and chose that if Massimino revived his suit's oxygen in the isolated space, the pair could securely proceed with the battery establishment. In the wake of moving to the battery unit site, Good and Massimino evacuated one of the first battery modules from Bay 2 of the telescope, and supplanted it with another unit. The batteries give capacity to the telescope when it goes into the Earth's shadow and its sunlight based clusters are not presented to the sun. The spacewalk formally finished at 20:45 UTC, for a period of seven hours, fifty-six minutes. It was the twentieth spacewalk to support Hubble, getting the all out time EVA overhauling the telescope to one hundred forty-four hours and twenty-six minutes. 

Amid the mission status preparation, Tomas Gonzalez-Torres, the Lead EVA Officer, and Hubble Program Manager Preston Burch both clarified that the extra RSU would not affect the life of the telescope, as it had been completely revamped on the ground with two of the three upgrades fused in more up to date models. "I would state the distinction in the anticipated life span of the observatory in the out years is exceptionally little. We don't see this is a huge inconvenience at all to the observatory. This was a gigantic achievement for us." Burch noted. Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci noticed that because of the length of the spacewalk, and the subsequent slip in the course of events, the group's rest move would need to be moved an hour later, to enable them to get the best possible measure of rest, and the remainder of the docked timetable would likewise be moved forward 60 minutes. 

In the wake of enlivening, the team set to work getting ready for the mission's third spacewalk, one that was viewed as the most testing and questionable, yet had probably the most elevated need things planned. The undertakings were to evacuate the out of date Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR), initially introduced amid STS-61 to address the round abnormality of Hubble's mirror, and introduce the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), and to fix the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The ACS bombed in June 2006 because of an electrical issue, and subsequent to being reestablished halfway, flopped again in 2007 because of an electrical short. The ACS was not intended to be adjusted or fixed in space, so the errand was viewed as a standout amongst the most testing of the mission. Subsequent to running into different tangles in the initial two spacewalks, administrators on the ground were set up to see unforeseen issues emerge amid the convoluted fix work. The spacewalk started at 13:35 UTC, and Grunsfeld and Feustel had no issues. The pair worked through their course of events so productively that they were over an hour ahead at a certain point. Subsequent to expelling COSTAR and stowing it in the orbiter's payload narrows, they introduced COS, and after that proceeded onward to the ACS fix. Utilizing extraordinarily structured devices, they expelled an entrance board, supplanted the camera's four circuit sheets, and introduced another power supply. 

The spacewalk was finished in six hours and thirty-six minutes, and the ACS breezed through the underlying aliveness tests. It was the twenty-first Hubble overhauling spacewalk, and Grunsfeld's seventh EVA, moving him up to fourth in the record book of spacewalking time. Amid the earlier day's main goal status preparation, Dave Leckrone, Hubble Space Telescope Senior Project Scientist, made an expectation, kidding that since the initial two spacewalks, which were viewed as direct, had kept running into issues, the most troublesome EVA Ã¢ÂÂ to fix the ACS, would be the smoothest one of the mission. "I have an expectation, We've generally said EVA 3 would have been the most troublesome and the most testing, and I anticipate it will go more easily than some other EVA on this mission. I simply imagine that is some rendition of Murphy's Law that is going to lead us toward that path." 

After the underlying aliveness testing, the ACS was put through its practical tests. Supervisors and specialists had noticed that the fixes were intended for just a solitary one of the three photograph channels, the wide-field channel, and that the issues with the high-goals channel may not be settled by the structured fix. Amid the useful testing, the wide-field channel passed, however issues were seen with the high-goals channel, demonstrating that the power issue might be more distant upstream in the electronic circuits than the spacewalk fix tended to. Extra testing would be performed, however Hubble Program Manager Preston Burch noticed that the fix was intended to "back power" the high-goals channel through the ways associated with the wide-field channel, and keeping in mind that doable, it was a plausibility that the short out harm was in a region not revised with the arranged fix. Regardless of whether the high-goals station is unfit to be reestablished, it was viewed as less vital, since the main part of the ACS science yield is attempted by the wide-field station. The third channel, the sunlight based visually impaired channel, passed medium-term useful testing without issues. 

Starting the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good got down to business fixing the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph bombed in 2004 because of a blown power supply. Likewise with the ACS, the STIS was not planned with the goal of overhauling it while in space, and one of the real difficulties was to expel a spread plate held tight with more than 100 screws utilizing an uncommonly structured instrument called a clasp catch plate, intended to trap the screws and washers and keep them from drifting into space when evacuated. While setting up the latch catch plate, Massimino experienced issues with a handrail that must be evacuated to oblige the clasp catch plate. The handrail had a stripped jolt on the base, keeping it from being discharged. Subsequent to attempting different alternatives without progress, supervisors on the ground exhorted Massimino to utilize beast power to evacuate the handrail, so he could continue with the expulsion of the spread plate. The methodology was tried at Goddard Space Flight Center before favoring it, demonstrating that the stripped jolt could be severed securely utilizing power. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel strolled Massimino through the method gradually, encouraging him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to keep any parts from severing or flying free, to know about the response the power would have, just as to look for sharp edges on the handrail after expulsion. 

When the handrail was evacuated, Massimino got down to business connecting the catch plate, however kept running into extra issues when the battery in one of his capacity devices fizzled. Massimino was told to come back to the orbiter's sealed area to recover an extra device and to energize his suit's oxygen holds, to take into account consummation of the STIS fix. The remainder of the STIS fix work was finished with no issues, yet the spacewalkers were about two hours behind the planned course of events, so supervisors on the ground chose to defer the undertaking of introducing a New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs) onto the telescope's external shell. The spacewalk, initially planned to most recent six hours and thirty minutes, finished at 21:02 UTC, for a period of eight hours and two minutes. At the time, it turned into the 6th longest spacewalk ever. It was the twenty-second spacewalk committed to overhauling the Hubble telescope, and Massimino's fourth spacewalk, conveying his all out EVA time to thirty hours, forty-four minutes. 

Amid the mission status preparation, Jennifer Wiseman, Chief of Exoplanet and Stellar Astrophysics for Goddard Space Flight Center, noticed that the fix of STIS was a noteworthy triumph for both the mission and the science network, as that piece of the telescope performed interesting capacities, helping researchers comprehend the materials planets are made out of, and seeing things like the movement of stars around dark gaps. 

After beginning aliveness testing that demonstrated no issues, STIS was taken into useful testing, and issues were seen when the telescope place itself into protected mode because of a low warm breaking point sensor. Ground controllers at Goddard would restart the testing once as far as possible sensor was back in ordinary sensor extend, yet it is trusted the segment is fit as a fiddle. 

Finishing the fifth of the five arranged spacewalks, Grunsfeld and Feustel effectively introduced the second battery, evacuated and supplanted the Fine Guidance Sensor number three, and worked so proficiently that they were over an hour in front of the course of events, giving them an opportunity to expel corrupted protection boards from three inlets of the telescope, and introduce three New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs). Starting the spacewalk at 12:20 UTC, the pair originally took a shot at evacuating a maturing battery module, and supplanted it with another pack, which joined with the battery substitution performed amid the second spacewalk, gave the telescope all new nickel-hydrogen batteries. They at that point proceeded onward to the expulsion and substitution of the Fine Guidance Sensor unit number three, improving Hubble's concentration and security when imaging. NASA engineers compare the new FGS to having the capacity to keep a laser bar concentrated on a U.S. dime coin that is away. Both the new batteries, and the FGS passed both aliveness and practical testing. The mission's last EVA finished up at 19:22 UTC, following seven hours and two minutes. The complete time spent amid the mission in additional vehicular action was thirty-six hours, fifty-six minutes. The twenty-third and last spacewalk to support Hubble brought the complete time spent in EVA dealing with the telescope to one hundred and sixty-six hours, six minutes. Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci noticed that the last EVA was likewise the last arranged spacewalk from a van airtight chamber. In what was likely his last EVA, Grunsfeld's has amassed fifty-eight hours and thirty minutes spacewalking, only two minutes not as much as Jerry L. Ross, who is third on the rundown of spacewalking time. 

The finish of all the significant goals, just as some that were not viewed as indispensable, updated the telescope to its most mechanically propelled state since its dispatch nineteen years back, and made it more dominant than any other time in recent memory. The updates will likewise assist Hubble with seeing further into the universe, and more remote into the past, closer to the season of the Big Bang. Hubble's significance to science isn't simply found in the emotional pictures it gives, yet additionally in the volume of work it has produced Ã¢ÂÂ a normal of fourteen logical articles are distributed every week dependent on information accumulated from the telescope. Authoritatively, the overhauls ought to expand Hubble's life through 2014, however Hubble Space Telescope Senior Scientist David Leckrone noted before the mission that if the majority of the mission's goals were fruitful, the telescope could without much of a stretch last longer than that. The following vast telescope planned to be propelled is the James Webb Space Telescope in 2020, which is infrared-just, so to have Hubble, which has bright, obvious, and close infrared abilities, still operational after 2018 would be of incredible advantage to established researchers. 

Subsequent to arousing at 8:31 UTC, the team set to work getting ready to discharge Hubble from the payload inlet of "Atlantis". Utilizing the van's automated arm, McArthur hooked Hubble at 10:45 UTC, and lifted it out of the orbiter's payload narrows to plan for the discharge. Great and Massimino were remaining by prepared to play out a spacewalk if something turned out badly amid the telescope's organization. Subsequent to working through the agenda to set up the telescope for discharge, administrators on the ground gave the go to Altman to discharge Hubble, and at 12:57 UTC, McArthur effectively discharged the telescope as the vehicles flew over Africa. Playing out a little division consume, Johnson upheld the orbiter far from the telescope, and Altman called down to supervisors on the ground affirming the sending of Hubble. Lauding the team, Altman said "And Houston, Hubble has been discharged, it's securely back on its adventure of investigation as we start ventures to finish up our own. Not all things go as we arranged, yet we arranged an approach to work around everything and with the entire group pulling together... we've had the capacity to do some mind boggling things. What's more, presently Hubble can proceed without anyone else, investigating the universe, and conveying it home to us as we head for home in a couple of days. Much obliged to you." Hubble's new gear and overhauled frameworks would be tried for a while before continuing activity, yet in the event that all tests are fruitful, task of the telescope would continue toward the beginning of September. 

Following the partition consume, the team set to work playing out the standard late examination of the warm security arrangement of the orbiter. Utilizing the mechanical arm, McArthur, Altman, and Johnson worked through the strategies to assess the wing driving edge boards, strengthened carbon-carbon nose top, and warmth shield tiles. Subsequent to assessing the climate forecasts, chiefs on the ground marginally refined the calendar for landing, picking to bring the van home one circle ahead of schedule to attempt to stay away from the likelihood of showers that would counteract an arrival on Friday. The new landing open door would bring the team home at 10:01Ã¢Â am EDT. 

Following a bustling week adjusting Hubble, the group of "Atlantis" had most of the three day weekend, giving them an opportunity to rest and get ready for landing. They took their customary on-circle group picture, and talked with journalists from around the globe in a news meeting. The group likewise had the chance to talk with the Expedition 19 team on board the International Space Station, in a phone call directed through satellites. The station group saluted them on an extremely effective mission, and the team of "Atlantis" offered their thanks to the station team for all the work they do amid their long length remains on the station. 

The Spaceflight Meteorology Group at Johnson Space Center was foreseeing not exactly ideal climate for Friday's arrival, so supervisors requested that the team shut down some non-basic frameworks to help ration control, if the orbiter can't arrive until Saturday. 

In the wake of assessing the symbolism sent down from the late investigation, the ground group formally cleared the orbiter's warm assurance framework for reentry. At first, NASA had moved toward discharging "Attempt" from its remain by status following the late investigation, however supervisors on the ground chose to hold up until "Atlantis" had played out the de-circle copy before remaining down the STS-400 salvage mission formally. 

Prior to resting, the team accepted a telephone call from President Barack Obama, who saluted them on their effective mission, clowned with them, inquiring as to whether they could see his home in Chicago, and communicated his pride in the group. Obama told the team, "Similar to a ton of Americans, I've been viewing with wonder the lovely pictures you've been sending back, and the unbelievable fix mission you've been making in space," he said. "I believe you're giving a superb case of the sort of devotion and pledge to investigation that speaks to America and the space program for the most part. These are qualities that have constantly made this nation solid, and every one of you exemplify them." 

The group went through the day in arrangements for Friday's arrival. Subsequent to working through their post-rest exercises, Altman, Johnson and McArthur played out a registration of the flight control surfaces, played out a response control framework hot-fire, and experienced correspondences checks with supervisors on the ground. The remainder of the group attempted to stow away things that were utilized amid the mission. The group held a deorbit arrangements instructions with the ground groups, and Altman and Johnson worked with the test system on board to go through a progression of landing recreations. 

Toward the evening, the team turned into the primary transport group to ever affirm live from circle in a United States Senate hearing. Barbara Mikulski, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, and previous space traveler Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, talked with the group about the significance of spaceflight and the fix of Hubble. The primary individual to give declaration from space was John L. Phillips, who affirmed before the House Science Committee, Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics in June 2005 while an individual from Expedition 11 on board the International Space Station. The team of "Atlantis" later talked with columnists from the significant systems CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX before resting. 

While the climate in Florida kept on looking horrid for an arrival Friday, chiefs on the ground exhorted the team that they would continue with deorbit arrangements as arranged, and check whether the climate cleared up toward the beginning of the day. NASA directors expressed that for Friday, they would concentrate on a KSC arriving for Friday, not initiating any of the reinforcement locales, yet in the event that the climate was not great for a Friday arrival, Edwards Air Force Base could be actuated on Saturday. "Atlantis" has enough consumables to remain in circle until Monday. 

Additionally late on Thursday, administrators formally discharged "Try" from its remain by state, as "Atlantis" was cleared of any harm to its warmth shield and was fit as a fiddle to come back to Earth. 

As the group worked through the methods and agendas for section on Friday, the directors on the ground intently analyzed the climate designs around Florida, which were not exactly good. The group was prompted that there were low mists and rainstorms, the two conditions that abused landing criteria, so supervisors deferred the primary chance. A second open door was likewise not taken, as the climate had not improved. Section Flight Director Norm Knight called up Edwards Air Force Base not long after the choice to defer to Saturday was made, which would give the group a sum of six Saturday landing openings, three at every area. 

The group of "Atlantis" had six conceivable landing openings on Saturday. Chiefs assessed the best three chances of the day to take a stab at bring the orbiter home. Saturday's first arrival open door at Kennedy Space Center was postponed because of poor climate estimates, and watched climate infringement for the arrival criteria. After further assessing climate designs around Florida, chiefs on the ground postponed the second open door also, and hold up one more day to endeavor to get the orbiter into Florida on Sunday. Climate in California had astounding conjectures, so if the endeavors on Sunday to arrive in Florida were not fruitful, the van would almost certainly land at Edwards Air Force Base without climate being an issue. 

The "Atlantis" group had two Florida return open doors through the afternoon, just as two for a California arrival, giving the administrators time to assess the climate and use California if important. In the wake of passing on the primary open door for KSC and assess the second, supervisors on the ground chose that the climate in Florida was too powerful to even think about risking acquiring the orbiter, and selected to arrive at Edwards Air Force Base. The de-circle consume was started at 14:24 UTC, a consume of the van's motors that conveyed it out of circle to start the orbiter's reentry into the Earth's climate. "Atlantis" effectively arrived at Edwards Air Force Base on Runway 22 at 8:39Ã¢Â am PDT after 197 circles in space and a separation of around 5.2Ã¢Â million miles. 

In the wake of working through the agendas to securely shut down the orbiter, the team played out the conventional stroll around of the bus and met with representatives from NASA. Talking quickly to the press chasing after the walk, Altman kidded, "I didn't understand it would have been so difficult to return to the Earth! We're altogether excited to have the mission complete." 

Amid the post-arrival instructions, Associate Administrator for Space Sciences Ed Weiler proclaimed the mission an absolute achievement, and in the wake of taking note of the rough street that it took to get the mission finished, said he believed the mission to be Hubble's Great American Comeback story, part two. 

Following standard post-landing preparing at Edwards Air Force Base, "Atlantis" was lifted into the air utilizing the Mate-DeMate gadget, and joined to the highest point of a changed Boeing 747, called a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) for its arrival trip to Florida. In the wake of withdrawing California on 1 June, the flight made a medium-term stop at Biggs Army Airfield in El Paso, Texas, and on 2 June made stops in San Antonio, Texas, and Columbus, Mississippi to refuel. In the wake of playing out a flyby of the coast, the SCA arrived at Kennedy Space Center at 6:53 p.m EDT on 2 June 2009. One of the heavier return flights, "Atlantis" was all the while conveying the load from the mission in the payload narrows, and weighed around one fourth of a million pounds. Joined with the 747, the absolute load of the vehicle was around six hundred thousand pounds. "Atlantis" was expelled from the SCA and towed to the Orbiter Processing Facility late 2 June. 

Five consecutive EVAs were anticipated the mission. Spacewalks one through four were initially planned to most recent six hours, thirty minutes, while the fifth spacewalk was booked to most recent five hours, forty-five minutes. Every one of the five EVAs were directed effectively, for an all out time in EVA movement of thirty-six hours, fifty-six minutes. 

NASA started a convention of playing music to space travelers amid the Gemini program, which was first used to awaken a flight group amid Apollo 15. Each track is uncommonly picked, regularly by their families, and for the most part has an exceptional significance to an individual from the team, or is pertinent to their day by day exercises. 

STS-125 was the main arranged transport mission after the "Columbia" mishap to be propelled into a low-tendency circle that did not permit rendezvous with the International Space Station. Because of the tendency and other circle parameters of Hubble, "Atlantis" would have been unfit to utilize the International Space Station as a place of refuge in case of basic or mechanical disappointment. To save NASA's post-"Columbia" prerequisite of having transport Launch On Need (LON) salvage capacity, STS-400 was the flight assignment given to the Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS) mission which would have been flown by "Try" in the occasion "Atlantis" ended up debilitated amid STS-125. After "Atlantis" played out the late review and was cleared for reentry, "Try" was formally discharged from remain by status on Thursday, 21 May.
