These names characterize family relationship connections that impact favored marriage accomplices and might be related with specific totems. Despite the fact that they might be utilized as terms of location, they are not surnames in the sense utilized by Europeans. Accordingly 'Tjunkiya ' is the component of the craftsman's name that is explicitly hers. 

A Pintupi speaker, Tjunkiya was conceived in the region northwest of Walungurru (known as Kintore, Northern Territory), close to the Western Australian outskirt, and west of Alice Springs), after which her family moved to Haasts Bluff. She turned out to be second spouse to Toba Tjakamarra, father of one of the noticeable authors of the Papunya Tula workmanship development, Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula.

Contemporary Indigenous craft of the western desert started when Indigenous men at Papunya started painting in 1971, helped by instructor Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which utilized acrylic paints to make plans speaking to body painting and ground figures, quickly spread crosswise over Indigenous people group of focal Australia, especially following the beginning of an administration authorized workmanship program in focal Australia in 1983. By the 1990s, such work was being displayed universally. The primary specialists, including the majority of the organizers of the Papunya Tula craftsmen's organization, had been men, and there was obstruction among the Pintupi men of focal Australia to ladies painting. Be that as it may, there was likewise a craving among a significant number of the ladies to take an interest, and during the 1990s expansive quantities of them started to make artistic creations. In the western desert networks, for example, Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the outstations, individuals were starting to make fine arts explicitly for show and deal. 

Like some of the other focal and western desert ladies in the area, Tjunkiya was acquainted with painting through the Minyma Tjukurrpa (Women's Dreaming) painting venture in the mid-1990s. Alongside sister Wintjiya and other ladies, she took an interest in a depiction camp in 1994 which brought about "a progression of exceptionally expansive collective canvases of the gathering's shared Dreamings".

In the mid 2000s she and her sister painted at Kintore, yet in 2008 they were working from their home: "the widows' camp outside her 'child' Turkey Tolson's previous habitation". Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya did not limit their exercises to painting canvases.
