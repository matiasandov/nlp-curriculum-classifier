The patio nurseries, which were given to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society by the British Royal Family in 1828, involve some portion of the previous grounds of St. Mary's Abbey. The general public procured the land to construct an exhibition hall to house its accumulations; the Yorkshire Museum was finished in 1830. The land was allowed to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society under the condition that professional flowerbeds would be set up on the site. These were made amid the 1830s in a gardenesque style configuration via scene planner Sir John Murray Naysmith. They initially contained a studio, a lake and a zoological display, which was decimated when a bear got away from it and had brief control of the region. The then Princess Victoria visited the greenery enclosures in 1835, the year that they were first open to the general population. In 1854 the greenhouses were depicted as "one of the primary attractions of York". Right now entrance as allowed to individuals and for non-individuals entrance cost one pushing aside from on Saturday when it cost six pence. 

In 1960, the patio nurseries and the Yorkshire Museum were given in trust to the City of York Council and they turned into an open park.

York Museum Gardens spread a zone of on the north bank of the River Ouse, simply outside the city dividers in the focal point of York. There are four passageways to the patio nurseries: on Marygate (off Bootham) by St Olave's Church, on Museum Street by Lendal Bridge, by means of a way along the edge of King's Manor, and from the riverside stroll beside the River Ouse. The site inclines tenderly down towards the waterway and is comprised of authentic structures and undulating yards sprinkled with plants and trees. The greenery enclosures are available to general society amid light hours, so the opening and shutting times differ consistently. Ordinarily confirmation is free however there are charges for certain occasions. In 2010 it was evaluated that the patio nurseries pull in 1.3 million guests per year.

Planting comprises of huge beds containing transcendently bushes and trees, and gardens scattered with individual trees. Types of tree incorporate a monkey perplex tree alongside oak and chestnut trees; three of the trees in the greenhouses are classed as United Kingdom champion trees. There is a rockery beside the Marygate entrance, by the vestiges of the convent church, and before the passage to the Yorkshire Museum there is a patio flanked with beds of white roses, the image of Yorkshire. 

The patio nurseries are home to a populace of semi-tame dim squirrels and numerous types of winged animals. A 1970 report covering the period 1965-1969 recorded the vertebrates occupant in the greenhouses around then: Common wood pigeon, Tawny owl, Blue tit, Eurasian Wren, Dunnock, European Robin, European greenfinch, Missel thrush, Song thrush, Blackbird, and House sparrow, Common vixen, Wood mouse, and Brown rodent. 

In the mid nineteenth century, the greenery enclosures incorporated a zoological garden. Henry Baines' girl, Fanny, reviewed 70 years after the fact that in this period the zoological displays contained a dab, a brilliant hawk, and a few monkeys, among different creatures. In 1831, a bear from the zoological display got free in the patio nurseries and apparently pursued the Keeper of the Yorkshire Museum, John Phillips, and Reverent Harcourt into a shed. The bear was along these lines sent to London Zoo. 

Until 2006 a group of peacocks had been in living arrangement for no less than 70 years. 

In 2012 the greenhouses was one of the discharge destinations for another populace of the imperiled Tansy bug and, starting at 2015, is a standout amongst the best places to see them in nature. 

There is additionally a land peculiarity near the principle doors, comprising of a vast stone of pink rock that was found amid development of the city's railroad station. Since this sort of stone isn't nearby it was resolved as having been transported there from Shap in Cumbria by icy activity amid the last ice age. 

In 2015, to commend the 200th commemoration of the production of the topographical guide of Britain by William Smith, a mosaic guide was authorized for the Gardens from craftsman Janette Ireland which demonstrates the geographical strata of Yorkshire in rocks of the relating stone. 

Just as being a well known recreational space for the two inhabitants and guests, the greenery enclosures are the scene for extraordinary occasions, for example, outside theater and music exhibitions. The greenery enclosures are the area of York's Saluting Station, one of just 12 in the United Kingdom, with 21-firearm salutes being terminated around early afternoon to praise events identified with the British Royal Family consistently.

In 1970, groups including Roxy Music, Hawkwind and Pink Fairies organized concerts,in 2007 The Lord Chamberlain's Men displayed a generation of "Romeo and Juliet". 

Different occasions and exhibitions include: 

In the upper east of Museum Gardens there are survives from the west corner of the fortresses that encompassed the Roman stronghold of Eboracum. The first barriers, comprising of turf defenses on a green wood establishment, were worked by the Ninth Legion somewhere in the range of 71 and 74ÃÂ AD. Later those were supplanted by a mud hill with a turf front on another oak establishment, and in the end wooden fortifications were included, which were then supplanted by limestone dividers and towers. These stone barriers are a portion of the couple of Roman remains that are obvious over the ground in York. 

The Multangular Tower is the western corner tower of the Roman fortification, and comprises of both Roman and medieval engineering. The pinnacle has 10 sides, from which it infers its advanced name ""multangular"", and is 19Ã¢Â feet (5.8Ã¢Â m) high. It was worked in its late Roman structure amid the mid fourth century, when it was developed with three stories to house a sling. Five Roman stone boxes are in the Multangular Tower, which were brought from burial grounds in different zones of York. 

A 76-foot (23Ã¢Â m) area of fourth century divider associates the Multangular Tower to a little interim pinnacle. The side of the divider and towers looking into Museum Gardens is deliberately looked in stone, as amid the Roman time frame it was in plain view. The opposite side is rougher in light of the fact that it was initially secured by an earth bank. The divider and towers were still being used after the finish of the Roman time frame in Britain, and were accordingly joined into the medieval city dividers. As late as the English Civil War they were being utilized to shield the city, and there is a gap in the divider along from the Multangular Tower that was made by a cannonball amid this period. The Roman pieces of the divider and towers are developed of customary rectangular limestone hinders with a band of red tile going through them. The later medieval increases can be distinguished by the utilization of a lot bigger squares of limestone that slice through the red tiles in spots and by the cross formed bolt cuts on the Multangular Tower. 

Toward the north of the Multangular Tower there is a stretch of the medieval city divider with the remaining parts of the first Roman divider running parallel to it on the city side. Incorporated with this piece of the divider is the stone Anglian Tower, which was once thought to have been worked amid the rule of Edwin of Northumbria, however at this point is for the most part thought to be of the exceptionally late Roman time frame. Behind the Anglian Tower are a progression of banks appearing dimension of the guards amid the Roman, early Middle Ages, Norman, and late medieval periods. 

The patio nurseries contain a few structures going back to the medieval period, the majority of them identifying with St Mary's Abbey. The Benedictine Abbey's starting points go back to 1086 when Alan Count of Brittany allowed St Olave's Church and the connecting area to the priest Stephen of Whitby, who turned into the main abbot of St. Mary's. At the point when St Olave's Church turned out to be excessively little, a bigger church in a Romanesque style was manufactured close-by, the establishment stone of which was laid in 1089 by William II. This was supplanted somewhere in the range of 1270 and 1279 by a congregation in a Gothic style. The convent turned into the wealthiest religious community in the North of England, worth over ÃÅ2,085 every prior year it was broken up by Henry VIII on 25 November 1539. Throughout the following 200 years the nunnery fell into decay and the convent church was generally disassembled for its stone. 

Stones from the monastery church can be seen lining ways all through the patio nurseries, however the significant vestiges of the congregation are on the western side. The congregation was adjusted on an upper east hub as a result of the shape and size of the site, rather than indicating the east, the ordinary arrangement for houses of worship in England. Some portion of the north and west dividers that framed the nave and intersection, planned in Gothic style by designer Simon of Pabenham in the thirteenth century, stay standing. The remnants incorporate sham lancet windows, tracery windows and "tracery stays to demonstrate that the examples switched back and forth between a solitary expansive hover more than two lights and three little circles more than three lights". The section capitals are adorned with foliage in a solid leaf style just as in a naturalistic style, in spite of the fact that this stonework is weatherworn thus this design is difficult to recognize. Areas of the establishments of the congregation and its Norman antecedent are uncovered, and an arrangement of their formats can be found in the grass. Finds uncovered from the site, including life-sized statues of Christian holy people, can be found in the Yorkshire Museum. 

St Mary's Lodge was worked around 1470 as an expansion to the late twelfth century structures that shaped the gatehouse at the primary access to the monastery, Ã¢ÂÂ now the Marygate access to the greenhouses. Some remaining parts of the twelfth century gatehouse can in any case be seen, specifically the passage appended to the side of the hotel. The hotel is worked of stone, and does not contain timber confining like the adjacent Hospitium. The cabin, alongside the connected railings, doors and entryway docks are all Grade I recorded structures, which implies that they are of remarkable intrigue. Initially, the cabin may have been utilized as a guesthouse for the monastery, and was where the poor could guarantee charity from the nunnery. After the convent's disintegration, the cabin turned into a town hall until 1722, when part of the structure turned into the Brown Cow bar. In 1840 John Philips, the Yorkshire Museum's custodian, reestablished and changed over it to use as his home while holding its outer appearance. The hotel accordingly ended up utilized as workplaces, and amid the mid 21st century turned into the home office of the York Museums Trust. 

Alongside the cabin, a portion of the monastery's area dividers are as yet standing. A segment of the rest of the dividers keeps running along the north-west piece of the greenery enclosures and stretches out further along Marygate to Bootham. The dividers were built in 1266 and expanded in stature and crenelated in 1318 under a regal permit from Edward III. Initially there was a cautious dump along the outside of the dividers. The dividers incorporate a few towers, not every one of them dating from the medieval period; the half circle tower close to the gatehouse is a nineteenth century recreation. The dividers and towers were utilized for the convent's safeguard, for example in question with the City of York over land possession and imposes, and assumed a job in the guard of the city amid the Siege of York. 

The Hospitium is situated between the remains of St. Mary's Abbey Church and the River Ouse and is thought to have initially been a visitor house for guests to the monastery of low social status, or potentially a horse shelter. It was initially part of a gathering of structures in the convent grounds that incorporated a mix house, stables, factory and, close to the principle door, an all inclusive school with 50 understudies. The most seasoned pieces of the ground floor were worked around 1300, yet the upper story has been broadly reestablished in present day times. The demolished entryway along the edge goes back to the fifteenth century, and was likely the passageway to a section that kept running towards the water-door by the stream. 

The remaining parts of St. Leonard's Hospital church and undercroft are on the east side of the greenhouses, by the Museum Street entrance. The medical clinic was the biggest in England amid the Middle Ages, and was controlled by a network of people of the Augustinian request. Amid the fourteenth century, the medical clinic could have contained upwards of 240 patients, 18 church and 30 choristers. St. Leonard's Hospital was shut amid the disintegration of the religious communities, when it was surrendered to Henry VIII by Thomas Magnus. The undercroft and sanctuary were a piece of the clinic worked somewhere in the range of 1225 and 1250. The inside of the undercroft, available from the greenhouses, has a rib vaulted roof and houses an accumulation of Roman and medieval stonework. In 1999, the clinic and encompassing zone in Museum Gardens was one of three destinations in York to highlight in a version of the British Channel 4 TV program "Time Team". 

Between the Museum Street access to the greenhouses and the River Ouse is a short stretch of York's city dividers, which closes at the medieval Lendal Tower. 

William Hincks was instrumental in setting up the patio nurseries. Henry John Wilkinson reports as pursues: 

"Mr. Hincks was instructor on herbal science at the York School of Medicine, and the administrations he rendered to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society for more than ten years merit our appreciative much obliged. He dedicated his relaxation time to change over the " squander land " into a plant and ornamental* garden, and in this work he was capably helped by the late sub-guardian, Henry Baines. " 

The Yorkshire Philosophical Society developed a few structures in the greenery enclosures amid the nineteenth and mid twentieth hundreds of years, including the Yorkshire Museum, one of the main reason assembled exhibition halls in Britain. The Yorkshire Museum was planned by modeler William Wilkins in a Greek Revival style and was formally opened in February 1830. On 26 September 1831 the debut meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was held at the Yorkshire Museum. Three of the historical center's changeless accumulations are housed in the Yorkshire Museum constructing all of which have English assigned gathering status, which implies they are "pre-prominent accumulations of national and universal significance". The science gathering contains 200,000 examples, including both fauna and verdure, with the greater part of the accumulation made up of bugs. There are two stuffed examples of the wiped out incredible auk, a practically total skeleton of a terminated moa and an extensive accumulation of examples from the Yorkshire locale including the remaining parts of elephants, cavern bears and hyena from Kirkdale Cave dated to the Quaternary time frame, around 125,000 years prior. The land accumulation contains more than 112,500 examples of rocks, minerals and fossils. Fossils make up a large portion of the gathering numbering more than 100,000 examples, and incorporate critical examples from the Carboniferous, Mesozoic and Tertiary periods. The prehistoric studies accumulation has near a million items that date from around 500,000ÃÂ BC to the twentieth century, including the Coppergate Helmet found in York in 1982, and the Ormside Bowl, a complicated case of an Anglian silversmith. 

The majority of the historical center's cosmology accumulation is housed in the octagonal observatory in the focal point of the greenery enclosures, worked amid 1832 and 1833. The plan of its turning rooftop is credited to John Smeaton creator of the Eddystone Lighthouse. A telescope worked in 1850 by the instrument creator Thomas Cooke of York was introduced amid the observatory's 1981 reclamation. It is Yorkshire's most established working observatory and as of August 2007 was opened to people in general by a group of volunteers. The structure is as of now opened each Thursday and Saturday 11.30 until 2.30. The check in the observatory was made by Barraud of London in 1811, and amid the nineteenth century it was utilized to set the ideal opportunity for different checks in York. 

At the eastern, Museum Street, access to the patio nurseries is Museum Gardens' Lodge worked in 1874 to a structure by George Fowler Jones in a Victorian Gothic restoration style. The cabin currently houses the Yorkshire Philosophical Society's workplaces and perusing room. 

The custodian's home, worked in 1844 and initially called the guardian's home, is situated by King's Manor. It was structured by J B Atkinson and was fabricated utilizing recovered limestone from St. Mary's Abbey. 

The Tempest Anderson Hall is a 300-situate assembly room style address theater worked in 1912 as an annexe to the Yorkshire Museum. Dr Tempest Anderson, a York specialist and vulcanologist, exhibited the corridor to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society to supplant its current address theater. Planned by E Ridsdale Tate, it is an early case of the utilization of strengthened cement and is a Grade I recorded structure. In the late twentieth century it housed a film, yet it is presently utilized as a gathering scene and address theater. 

York's first swimming shower was situated in the south-west corner of the Museum Gardens. It was an outside pool planned by the engineers Samuel and Richard Hey Sharp, one of the originators of the Yorkshire Museum, and estimated by and had a limit of around 290,000 gallons. It opened to people in general on 8 August 1837, and utilized a Keeper of the showers all through its life expectancy.
