Place of Hasan-Jalalyan 

The House of Hasan-Jalalyan ( was an Armenian administration that governed the area of Khachen (Greater Artsakh) from 1214 onwards in what are presently the districts of lower Karabakh, Nagorno-Karabakh and little piece of Syunik. It was named after Hasan-Jalal Dawla (ÅÂÅÄÅËÅÄÅÅ-ÅÂÅÄÅÅºÅÄÅÅº Ã'ÅÂ¸ÅÅºÅÄ), an Armenian primitive ruler from Khachen. The Hasan-Jalalyan family had the capacity to keep up its self-sufficiency during a few time of remote control of the area by Seljuk Turks, Persians and Mongols as they, just as the other Armenian rulers and "meliks" of Khachen, saw themselves of holding the last bastion of Armenian autonomy in the locale. 

Through their numerous supports of temples and different landmarks, the Hasan-Jalalyans developed Armenian culture all through the district. By the late sixteenth century, the Hasan-Jalalyan family had spread out to build up melikdoms in Gulistan and Jraberd, alongside their unique property in the melikdom of Khachen, were, close by the separatly led melikdoms of Varanda and Dizak, a piece of what was then known as the "Melikdoms of Khamsa." 

Hasan-Jalal followed his drop to the Armenian Aranshahik line, a family that originated before the foundation of the Parthian Arsacids in the district. Hasan-Jalal's family line was "solely" Armenian as indicated by antiquarian Robert H. Hewsen, an educator at Rowan University and a specialist on the historical backdrop of the Caucasus: 

A lot of Hasan-Jalal Dawla's family establishes were dug in a complex exhibit of illustrious relational unions with new and old Armenian "nakharar" families. Hasan-Jalal's granddad was Hasan I (otherwise called Hasan the Great), a sovereign who led over the northern portion of Artsakh. In 1182, he ventured down as leader of the locale and entered cloister life at Dadivank, and partitioned his property into two: the southern half (involving quite a bit of Khachen) went to his most seasoned child Vakhtank II (otherwise called Tangik) and the northern half went to the most youthful, Gregory "the Black." Vakhtank II wedded Khorishah Zakarian, who was herself the little girl of Sargis Zakarian, the ancestor of the Zakarid line of sovereigns. When he wedded the little girl of the AÃ¡Å¡Âanshahik lord of Dizak-Balk, Mamkan, Hasan-Jalal additionally acquired his dad in-law's territories. 

In the late 1960s and into the 1970s, Hasan-JalalÃ¢ÂÂs starting points turned into a piece of a bigger discussion rotating around the historical backdrop of Artsakh among Armenian and Azerbaijani researchers. Notwithstanding the position held exclusively by Azerbaijani history specialists that a lot of Artsakh at the time was under overwhelming Caucasian Albanian impact, they additionally battle that the populace and landmarks were not Armenian but rather Caucasian Albanian in beginning (this contention has likewise been utilized against Armenian landmarks in the locale of Nakhichevan). Among the chief revisionists who elucidated these perspectives were Ziya Bunyadov and Farida Mamedova. Mamedova herself affirmed that Hasan-Jalal, in light of her understanding of an engraving cut into the Gandzasar Monastery by the sovereign, was Caucasian Albanian. Armenian students of history just as specialists of the area, for example, Hewsen, dismiss her decisions, alongside the idea held in Azerbaijan, that the Armenians "stole" Caucasian AlbaniaÃ¢ÂÂs culture. 

With the surrender of Ani to the Byzantine Empire in 1045 and the Byzantine extension of Kars in 1064, the last autonomous Armenian state in memorable Armenia, Bagratuni kingdom, arrived at an end. In any case, notwithstanding remote mastery of the district, which turned out to be progressively articulated after the Seljuk Turks vanquished the Byzantines at the clash of Manzikert in 1071, Armenians in eastern Armenia had the capacity to keep up self-governance in the two sloping kingdoms of Syunik and Lori and in the territory of Khachen. From the ahead of schedule to mid-twelfth century, the consolidated Georgian and Armenian armed forces were fruitful in driving the Turks out of Eastern Armenia, in this way setting up a time of relative harmony and thriving until the presence of the Mongols in 1236. 

Khachen used to be a piece of Syunik until various Turkic intrusions separated it from the remainder of the kingdom. The rule of the Hasan-Jalalyan family was focused around the Terter and the Khachenaget waterways. Hasan-Jalal's introduction to the world date is obscure; anyway his rule, starting in 1214 and finishing at the season of his passing at some point between 1261-1262 in Qazvin, included both Artsakh and the encompassing Armenian districts. At the point when his dad Vakhtank kicked the bucket in 1214, Hasan-Jalal acquired his properties and relocated to a stronghold at Akana in Jraberd. He was tended to with the titles "tagavor" (lord; ) or "inknakal" (dictator or supreme ruler; ÅÅ¥ÅÅÃ¶ÂÅÅÅÄÅÅ¼ÅÄÅÅº) yet took the official title of "Lord of Artsakh and Balk" when he wedded the little girl of the last lord of Dizak-Balk. The medieval Armenian student of history Kirakos Gandzaketsi lauded Hasan-Jalal in his work "History of Armenia", binding him with recognition for his devotion and commitment to Christianity: 

A further demonstration of this commitment included Hasan-Jalal's appointing of the Gandzasar Monastery. Development of the religious community started in 1216 and went on until 1238. On July 22, 1240, in the midst of incredible festival amid Vardavar festivities and within the sight of almost 700 ministers including Nerses, the Catholicos of Albania, the congregation was sanctified. The religious community proceeded to turn into the living arrangement and tomb of the family just as the place of the catholicos; starting in the fifteenth century, the family additionally hoarded authority over the seat of Catholicos itself, which would from consequently in go down from uncle to nephew. Hasan-Jalal's child John VII is viewed as the first to have set up this training when he turned into the Catholicos though his nephew, likewise named John, turned into the second. 

Regardless of his steadfastness to Christianity, Muslim impact in the district had swarmed and affected the way of life and traditions of the Christians living in Georgia and Armenia, particularly after the Seljuk Turks attacked the Caucasus. Byzantine craftsmanship researcher Anthony Eastmond, for instance, takes note of that "a considerable lot of the outward indications of [Hasan-Jalal's] rule were displayed through Islamic traditions and titles, most prominently in his portrayal on his key establishment of Gandzasar." The picture of Hasan-Jalal on the drum of Gandzasar's vault makes them sit leg over leg, which Eastmond comments was an "overwhelming gadget for delineating influence at the Seljuq court." Muslim impact was likewise observed in Hasan-Jalal's name: as a design of the time, numerous Armenians embraced Arabic patronymics ("kunya") that lost any "association with unique Armenian names." Hasan-Jalal's Armenian name was Haykaz yet the Arabic words in his name, truth be told, depicted his individual; hence, Hasan implied attractive; Jalal, terrific; Dawla, riches and administration. 

Gandzasar ended up home to Armenia's previously finished Haysmavurk (Synaxarion), a logbook accumulation of short existences of holy people and records of critical religious occasions. The plan to have another, better composed Haysmavurk originated from Hasan-Jalal himself, who at that point set his solicitation with Father Israel (Ter-Israel), a pupil of an essential Armenian medieval scholar and Artsakh local known as Vanakan Vardapet. The Haysmavurk was additionally created by Kirakos Gandzaketsi. From that point forward, the Haysmavurk requested by Hasan-Jalal wound up known as "Synaxarion of Ter-Israel;" it was mass imprinted in Constantinople in 1834. 

In 1236, the Ilkhanate Mongol militaries attacked the Caucasus. Preceding them entering Khachen, Hasan Jalal and his kin had the capacity to take shelter at Ishkhanberd (found legitimately south of Gandzasar; additionally known by its Persian name of Khokhanaberd). Given its imposing area on a mountain, the Mongols decided not to assault the post and sued for dealings with Hasan-Jalal: they traded his steadfastness and military support of the Mongol Empire as a byproduct of a portion of the prompt grounds nearby Khachen that they had won. Afterward, in 1240-1242 Hasan Jalal even had struck coins of regular Mongol sorts in Khachen on the mints of "QarabÃ¤Âgh" (in Khokhanaberd) and "LajÃ¤Å¥n" (in Havkakhaghats berd). 

Wanting to safeguard his capacity, Hasan-Jalal made a trip twice to Karakorum, the capital of the Mongol realm, where he had the capacity to acquire unique self-governance rights and benefits for himself and the general population under his area from the decision "khan". In spite of this course of action, the Mongols saw a considerable lot of the general population of the area with disdain and burdened them too much. Arghun Khan, the territorial Mongol "ostikan" at the time, set such a large number of limitations against Armenians that it incited Hasan-Jalal in 1256 to voyage to the capital yet again to challenge the infringements upon Catholicos Nerses. Accordingly, Batu Khan drafted a record "ensuring opportunity for Lord Nerses, Katolikos of Albania, for every one of his properties and merchandise, that he be free and untaxed and permitted to travel openly wherever in the bishoprics under his power, and that nobody resist what he said." 

Hasan-Jalal likewise endeavored to reinforce his coalitions with the Mongols by having his little girl Rhuzukan wed Bora Noyan, the child of a Mongol head. Relations among Armenians and Mongols kept on breaking down notwithstanding, and the record issued by the khan neglected to maintain its guarantees. 

At last, in 1260, Hasan-Jalal chose to align himself with the powers of the Georgian lord David Narin, who was driving an uprising against Mongol principle. He was caught a few times by the Mongols yet his family had the capacity to free him by paying a payment. The revolt in the end fizzled and compelled of Arghun Khan, Hasan-Jalal was captured yet again and taken to Qazvin, (presently in Iran). As indicated by Kirakos Ganzaketsi, Rhuzukan spoke to the Hulagu Khan's significant other Doquz Khatun, to weight Arghun to free her dad. In any case, as Arghun Khan educated of this, he had Hasan-Jalal tormented lastly executed. Hasan Jalal's child Atabek requested a few of his men to Iran to recover his dad's dissected body, which had been hurled into a well; after bringing it back, the body was given an appropriate memorial service and covered at Gandzasar cloister. 

Following his demise, the family truncated Hasan-Jalal's legitimate title to the shorter "Sovereigns of Artsakh." Atabek was requested by Hulegu to assume control over his dad's position and held the post until 1306. His cousin Vakhtank, whose relatives would turn into the Melik-Avanyan family, was given authority over the area of Dizak. As a technique for demonstrating their connection to Hasan-Jalal, his relatives embraced Hasan-Jalal as their surname and affixed - yan as far as possible to shape a postfix. The family subsidized various engineering and social tasks which keep on standing today, including Gandzasar religious community and the adjoining Church of St. John the Baptist. In the late sixteenth century, the family spread out and built up "melikdoms" in settlements in Jraberd, Khachen and Gulistan. 

Amid the Turko-Persian wars of the seventeenth century and eighteenth century, the meliks furiously opposed and battled back against invasions made by the two sides. In the last quarter of the eighteenth century, they supported the attacking Russian armed forces to help clear the locale of both the Turks and Persians. The Hasan-Jalalyans were a standout amongst the most conspicuous of the melik families that took up the reason to free the area from outside control; the premier among them being Catholicos Yesayi Hasan-Jalalyan (? - 1728). In 1677, Armenian Catholicos Hakob of Julfa had held a mystery meeting with the meliks of Karabakh, recommending that an appointment travel to Europe to gather support for a freedom of the area. In 1711, Yesayi, going with Israel Ori, made a trip to Russia to help assemble support for a military under Peter the Great. Ori, notwithstanding, passed on in transit, and Yesayi before long took over as the lead figure of the development. He proceeded with arrangements with Peter, and in a letter sent to him in 1718, guaranteed the help of a 10-12,000-man Armenian armed force just as help from neighboring Georgian powers. His supplications proceeded until 1724, when the Treaty of Constantinople (1724) was marked by Peter the Great that, strangely, gave the Muslim-populated districts in eastern Transcaucasia to Russia and Christian-populated western areas to the Turks. Both had recently completed the process of overcoming swaths of Safavid region including expansive pieces of the Caucasus and Eastern Anatolia, while the last was crumbling in a common war. 

Russian enthusiasm for the Caucasus before long wound down after Peter's passing in 1725 as its pioneers pulled their powers back over the Terek River. what's more, the picked up regions in the North and South Caucasus were surrendered back to Iran (presently driven by Nader Shah) per the settlements of Resht and Ganja of 1732 and 1735, respeticely. 

While the Ottomans hence incidentally along these lines picked up the Christian districts of the breaking down Safavids, Yesai was accused for this disappointment by a portion of the pioneers of the Armenian armed force as they were compelled to battle for themselves against the Turkish attacks. 

Over the span of the period from the seventeenth century to the mid nineteenth century, the Jalalyan house likewise multiplied in the foundation of a few other Armenian honorable houses, including the Melik-Atabekyan family, who turned into the last leaders of the realm of Jraberd. Allahverdi II Hasan-Jalalyan, who was to kick the bucket in 1813, was the last melik of Khachen when the Russian Empire previously entered the district in 1805 amid the Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813. In 1828, after the second's end Russo-Persian War, when per the result as affirmed in the Treaty of Turkmenchay and Persia's constrained surrendering of the last domains it was holding in the South Caucasus, the Russians at long last broke down the workplace of Catholicos. 

At the season of the production of Hewsen's underlying article in the diary "Revue des ÄÂtudes ArmÄÅ¡niennes", the writer was unfit to follow any overcomers of the house yet noted that the last two Catholicoi of Albania, Hovhannes XII (1763Ã¢ÂÂ1786) and Sargis II (1794Ã¢ÂÂ1815), had twelve siblings by and large, all who left a "various descendants by the center of the nineteenth century." He was additionally ready to recognize a lady named Eleanora Hasan-Jalalyan who was living in Yerevan as a craftsman at the turn of nineteenth to twentieth century. In later years, Soviet sources likewise recorded the memoir of Ruben Hasan-Jalalyan (1840Ã¢ÂÂ1902), an Armenian essayist, writer and legal advisor who lived in the Russian Empire. One individual, a man named Stepan Hasan Jalalyan from Drmbon, Martakert Region of Nagorno Karabakh, filled in as an appointee in the Armenian National Assembly as an individual from the Heritage Party and battled in the Nagorno Karabakh War. 

A few antiquities of the Hasan-Jalalyans get by until today, including Hasan-Jalal's own blade, complete with an Armenian engraving, which is as of now in plain view at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.
