Zaharije OstojiÃ¤Â 

Zaharije OstojiÃ¤Â (; 1907Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ April 1945) was a Montenegrin Serb military officer who filled in as the head of the operational, authoritative and insight parts of the Chetnik Supreme Command driven by DraÄºÅ¾a MihailoviÃ¤Â in Yugoslavia amid World War II. He was a noteworthy in the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force before the Axis intrusion of Yugoslavia, and was engaged with the overthrow that removed Prince Paul of Yugoslavia on 27 March 1941. After the overthrow, he escorted Prince Paul to oust in Greece, and was in Cairo at the season of the attack in April. In September 1941, he was arrived on the Italian-involved Montenegrin coast alongside a British Special Operations Executive (SOE) contact officer and two mates. He escorted the SOE officer to the German-involved domain of Serbia and acquainted him with the Yugoslav Partisan pioneer Josip Broz Tito then MihailoviÃ¤Â. OstojiÃ¤Â before long turned into MihailoviÃ¤Â's head of staff, and after the German endeavor to catch the Chetnik pioneer amid Operation MihailoviÃ¤Â in December 1941, conveyed the Chetnik Supreme staff to Montenegro where they were re-joined with MihailoviÃ¤Â in June 1942. Amid the rest of 1942, OstojiÃ¤Â propelled a counter-assault against UstaÄºÄe troops of the Independent State of Croatia coming back toward the eastern Bosnian town of FoÃ¤Âa where they were required to proceed their destructive enemy of Serb strategies. Upwards of 2,000 nearby Muslims were in this way executed in the town by powers under OstojiÃ¤Â's direction. OstojiÃ¤Â later supervised extensive scale slaughters of regular people and consuming of Muslim towns in the fringe area among Montenegro and the SandÄºÅ¾ak. 

While the Chetniks were an enemy of Axis development in their long-go objectives and engaged in peripheral opposition exercises for constrained periods, they likewise completed nearly all through the war a strategic or specific joint effort with the occupation specialists against the Partisans. The Chetnik development embraced an approach of coordinated effort with the Axis controls, and occupied with collaboration to some degree by setting up "modus vivendi" or working as assistant powers under Axis control. This was shown in late 1942 and mid 1943, when OstojiÃ¤Â arranged and regulated the Chetnik inclusion in the expansive Axis hostile to Partisan hostile Case White nearby Italian troops. In 1944, he turned into a pioneer of the Chetnik powers in Herzegovina, and alongside Dobroslav JevÃ¤ÂeviÃ¤Â was associated with endeavors to grapple with the Allied powers. In late 1944, as the Partisans fixed their hold on the nation and the Soviet Red Army aided the catch of Belgrade, he rejoined MihailoviÃ¤Â in northeastern Bosnia yet they couldn't concede to what game-plan to take. OstojiÃ¤Â, alongside Chetnik pioneers Pavle ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â and Petar BaÃ¤ÂoviÃ¤Â and Chetnik ideologue DragiÄºÄa VasiÃ¤Â chose to move west to the region of the Ljubljana Gap in current Slovenia where other well disposed powers were concentrating. Toward the beginning of April 1945, looked with assaults by the Partisans and the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (HOS) along their course, the joined Chetnik constrain was vanquished by HOS powers in the Battle of LijevÃ¤Âe Field, after which OstojiÃ¤Â was caught by the UstaÄºÄe in an evident snare. As indicated by certain sources, he was executed in the Jasenovac inhumane imprisonment nearby ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â, BaÃ¤ÂoviÃ¤Â and VasiÃ¤Â. 

Zaharije OstojiÃ¤Â was a Montenegrin Serb, and was conceived in 1907 in the town of Gluhi Do in the Crmnica area, close to the Adriatic seaport of Bar in the Principality of Montenegro. After his tutoring, he joined the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force (VVKJ) and before the flare-up of World War II had ascended to the position of major. Little else has been recorded of OstojiÃ¤Â's initial life, yet his sister was hitched to Royal Yugoslav Army Brigadier General Ljubo NovakoviÃ¤Â, another Montenegrin Serb who likewise turned into a Chetnik leader amid World War II. 

After the episode of World War II, the legislature of Regent Prince Paul of Yugoslavia proclaimed its lack of bias. In spite of this, and with the point of verifying his southern flank for the pending assault on the Soviet Union, Adolf Hitler started putting overwhelming weight on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia to sign the Tripartite Pact and join the Axis. After some deferral, the Yugoslav government restrictively marked the Pact on 25 March 1941. After two days a bloodless overthrow d'ÄÅ¡tat ousted Prince Paul and proclaimed 17-year-old Prince Peter II of Yugoslavia of age. OstojiÃ¤Â was engaged with the upset through his cozy association with one of the primary instigators, the agent administrator of the VVKJ, Brigadier General Borivoje MirkoviÃ¤Â. OstojiÃ¤Â escorted Prince Paul to oust in Greece and after that ventured out on to Cairo. Following the resulting German-drove attack of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav capitulation 11 days after the fact, OstojiÃ¤Â stayed in Cairo until he was chosen to join a consolidated BritishÃ¢ÂÂYugoslav Special Operations Executive group which was to penetrate into involved Yugoslavia and reach opposition gatherings. Different individuals from the group were Captain Bill Hudson, an individual VVKJ officer, Major Mirko LalatoviÃ¤Â, and a radio administrator. They flew from Cairo to Malta on 13 September 1941, preceding being arrived from the British submarine HMS "Triumph" on the Montenegrin coast close Petrovac somewhere in the range of 20 and 22 September 1941. They rapidly came into contact with Montenegrin Partisans, including Milovan ÃÂilas and Arso JovanoviÃ¤Â, who escorted Hudson and OstojiÃ¤Â to Partisan-held UÄºÅ¾ice in the German-involved domain of Serbia. While Hudson acquainted himself with the Partisans, OstojiÃ¤Â went on to MihailoviÃ¤Â's central command at Ravna Gora, yet in the wake of instructions MihailoviÃ¤Â returned to escort Hudson to Ravna Gora, touching base there on 25 October. When he initially touched base at Ravna Gora, OstojiÃ¤Â had conveyed a message to MihailoviÃ¤Â from the War Minister of the Yugoslav government estranged abroad, Bogoljub IliÃ¤Â, guaranteeing him of the official help of the administration in a state of banishment, however expressing that "a defiance would not go on without serious consequences". OstojiÃ¤Â additionally disclosed to MihailoviÃ¤Â that the socialists had assumed responsibility for Montenegro. OstojiÃ¤Â and LalatoviÃ¤Â then accepted ranking staff positions in MihailoviÃ¤Â's preeminent order base camp. 

After MihailoviÃ¤Â went on the keep running toward the beginning of December 1941 in the wake of Operation Uzice, Operation Mihailovic and the split with the Partisans, OstojiÃ¤Â kept up a little central station comprising mostly of the knowledge staff, which stayed near MihailoviÃ¤Â and his little close to home staff as he moved around the Rudnik mountain zone amid the rest of the winter a long time of 1941Ã¢ÂÂ1942. MihailoviÃ¤Â in the end advanced toward Montenegro, where he landed in June 1942. OstojiÃ¤Â, Hudson and different officers went along with him before long, going through Italian-held towns by truck masked as troops of the NediÃ¤Â routine, a manikin government in the German-involved domain of Serbia. 

In an order letter dated 30 July 1942, OstojiÃ¤Â encouraged all Chetnik commandants to "build up the most grounded conceivable oral and composed purposeful publicity". He expressed that, "the general population must be induced that the Chetniks are their solitary companions and that it is from them that they can anticipate opportunity and a cheerful life" and taught the Chetniks to "work day and night and keep up the soul of the general population". He expressed, "the hour of opportunity is close. United guide for the Chetniks is guaranteed, and the entire world is appreciating them." In August, he propelled a counterattack against UstaÄºÄe troops coming back to FoÃ¤Âa as the Italians pulled back their battalions from the hinterland. The Chetniks dreaded the UstaÄºÄe were going to release another round of destructive viciousness on the Serb populace in the region. No less than 2,000 nearby Muslims were in this way slaughtered in FoÃ¤Âa by powers under OstojiÃ¤Â's direction. 

In November 1942, OstojiÃ¤Â was urged by MihailoviÃ¤Â to wage a battle of fear against the Muslim populace living along the outskirts of Montenegro and the SandÄºÅ¾ak, and in this way announced Chetniks had devastated 21 towns and murdered around 1,300 individuals. Between 30 November and 2 December 1942, OstojiÃ¤Â spoke to MihailoviÃ¤Â at the Conference of Young Chetnik Intellectuals of Montenegro at the town of Ä¹Â ahoviÃ¤Âi close Bijelo Polje in the SandÄºÅ¾ak, which was additionally gone to by the Montenegrin Chetnik pioneer Pavle ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â. The meeting was commanded by ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â and its goals "communicated radicalism and narrow mindedness", just as a motivation which was centered around reestablishing the pre-war "the present state of affairs" in Yugoslavia executed in its underlying stages by a Chetnik tyranny. It additionally made a case for parts of the domain of Yugoslavia's neighbors. 

Half a month after the meeting, MihailoviÃ¤Â sent OstojiÃ¤Â to set up a forward base camp in Kalinovik in south-eastern Bosnia. OstojiÃ¤Â was to direction an activity gone for surrounding and decimating Partisan powers in Bosnia, which was to utilize Chetnik units filling in as Italian helpers in Herzegovina and Montenegro, just as other Chetnik units in the Lika district, northern Bosnia and northern Dalmatia. The arrangement was predicated on an Allied arriving on the Dalmatian coast, which MihailoviÃ¤Â accepted was impending. The blueprint idea was that the Chetniks would set up a hall through the Italian involved zone of the NDH to the extent the Partisan freed zone in western Bosnia and Lika, killing the Italians through a blend of obscure guarantees, urging them to surrender, and incapacitating them if essential. The arrangement was settled by early December 1942 at MihailoviÃ¤Â's central station in Montenegro, and tasks were intended to initiate on 5 January 1943. Be that as it may, the arrangement accepted that MihailoviÃ¤Â's powers were bound together, which they were not, and furthermore that his position reached out to a lot more Chetniks than it did as a general rule. 

Be that as it may, what happened rather was that the Chetniks that were planning for the "walk on Bosnia" were moved into nearer joint effort with the Axis amid the second period of Case White that occurred in the Neretva and Rama stream valleys in late February 1943. Amid this hostile, somewhere in the range of 12,000 and 15,000 Chetniks battled close by Italian powers, and in one case nearby German and Croatian troops against the Partisans. In spite of the way that the Chetniks were an enemy of Axis development in their long-extend objectives and engaged in negligible opposition exercises for constrained periods, their inclusion in Case White is a standout amongst the most critical instances of their strategic or specific coordinated effort with the Axis occupation powers. In this occurrence, the partaking Chetniks worked as authorized assistant powers under Italian control. OstojiÃ¤Â trusted that it was activities, for example, these that would cost the Chetniks the help of the Allies, and he wrote to MihailoviÃ¤Â that the Allies would presumably have bolstered the Chetniks had they been progressively engaged with battling the occupation. OstojiÃ¤Â disclosed to MihailoviÃ¤Â that his officers additionally held this view, and recommended that Chetnik joint effort be reexamined. Be that as it may, after getting OstojiÃ¤Â's message, MihailoviÃ¤Â did not in any case think about changing his system. 

The arrangement that OstojiÃ¤Â drew up required the Chetniks to stay south of the Neretva to abstain from being defeated by the Partisans. In any case, this basically guarded system was dismissed by Herzegovinian Chetnik commandants, for example, Dobroslav JevÃ¤ÂeviÃ¤Â and Bajo StaniÄºÄiÃ¤Â, who wished to pursue the Axis-drove hostile methodology. This set OstojiÃ¤Â in a troublesome position, with a portion of his key separation leaders following the requests of the Italians instead of his, while the Chetniks were dependent on Italian air and ordnance support, especially around Jablanica. OstojiÃ¤Â along these lines altered his opinion and bolstered the Italian hostile plans, propelling an assault against the Partisans withdrawing from Jablanica to Prozor on 27 February 1943. The assault was uncertain and OstojiÃ¤Â criticized the separation administrators dependable, especially StaniÄºÄiÃ¤Â. 

Amid this stage OstojiÃ¤Â first asked JevÃ¤ÂeviÃ¤Â to get more supplies from the Italians, and afterward when they can't, took steps to announce war on them. By early March, similarly as the Partisans were constraining an intersection of the Neretva at Jablanica, MihailoviÃ¤Â joined OstojiÃ¤Â. In a letter to one of his other Montenegrin Chetnik authorities, MihailoviÃ¤Â expressed that he was dealing with the entire activity through OstojiÃ¤Â, in spite of the fact that MihailoviÃ¤Â later denied that he was accountable for the task when addressed amid his preliminary by a Yugoslav court after the war. MihailoviÃ¤Â and OstojiÃ¤Â understood that the expansive convergences of Chetnik troops in and around Mostar and the adjacent bauxite mines were probably going to draw German consideration, and keeping in mind that they were centered around this issue, the Partisans constrained an intersection of the Neretva. 

Inside seven days of MihailoviÃ¤Â's landing the Partisans had effectively crossed the Neretva, and inside one more week they had constrained the Chetniks to pull back, losing Nevesinje then Kalinovik to the Partisans before the finish of March. Amid the battling, Chetnik officers had been not well taught and had neglected to collaborate, causing OstojiÃ¤Â to undermine them with courts military and synopsis execution. MihailoviÃ¤Â requested OstojiÃ¤Â to pull the Chetniks back towards positions on hold of the DrinaÃ¢ÂÂPiva streams, some southeast of Jablanica. By this point the Chetniks had endured substantial misfortunes, and the Partisans got through the joined ItalianÃ¢ÂÂChetnik protection line toward the beginning of April. In a report dated November 1944, Colonel Bill Bailey, the senior British contact officer with the Chetniks amid the war, expressed that both OstojiÃ¤Â and Major Vojislav LukaÃ¤ÂeviÃ¤Â had been condemning of MihailoviÃ¤Â's "reckless, however courageous, strategic taking care of" of Chetnik powers amid Case White, which had "contributed to a great extent to the disappointment of activities". Notwithstanding, OstojiÃ¤Â himself did not have the fundamental specialist with his subordinate commandants, had been unfit to adapt to the quickly evolving circumstance, had embraced a disliked and ineffectual cautious methodology, and had then accused the separation administrators for the Chetnik disappointments. 

In July 1943, the Montenegrin Partisan pioneer ÃÂilas reached both OstojiÃ¤Â and BaÃ¤ÂoviÃ¤Â to build up their eagerness to work mutually against the Axis occupiers, given that another legislature in a state of banishment was going to be built up without MihailoviÃ¤Â. They announced this contact to MihailoviÃ¤Â who took steps to prohibit them from his Chetnik association on the off chance that they kept up contact with the Partisans. 

By September 1944, OstojiÃ¤Â had been elevated to lieutenant colonel, and was the Chetnik region officer in eastern Bosnia. Toward the beginning of September 1944, as MihailoviÃ¤Â had been evacuated as Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Force with the destruction of the PuriÃ¤Â government estranged abroad, OstojiÃ¤Â attempted to reach Allied powers in Italy, and concurred with LukaÃ¤ÂeviÃ¤Â to issue a declaration to the general population clarifying that they were going to assault the Germans. After 12 September 1944, when King Peter required all in Yugoslavia to rally around Tito, he and BaÃ¤ÂoviÃ¤Â cautioned MihailoviÃ¤Â that their men were losing their will to battle the Partisans. Worried that the Russians would hand the Chetniks over to the Partisans, he at that point reached the United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS) contact officer with the Chetniks, Colonel Robert H. McDowell, however was unfit to organize the Chetniks to be set under American direction. 

After the fall of Belgrade on 20 October 1944, MihailoviÃ¤Â and a power of a couple of hundred of his Chetniks pulled back from A serbian area, crossed the Drina and based themselves in the Majevica mountain territory north of Tuzla in north-eastern Bosnia. OstojiÃ¤Â, who was directing Herzegovinian Chetniks, was joined by ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â and his Montenegrin Chetniks and together they pulled back towards MihailoviÃ¤Â. 

From the time he joined MihailoviÃ¤Â in northeastern Bosnia, ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â was extremely incredulous of MihailoviÃ¤Â's authority, and contended unequivocally for all the remaining Chetnik troops to move to the zone of the Ljubljana Gap in cutting edge Slovenia. Now OstojiÃ¤Â and BaÃ¤ÂoviÃ¤Â were additionally scrutinizing MihailoviÃ¤Â's arrangements. At the point when MihailoviÃ¤Â stayed unconvinced, ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â chose to move to the Ljubljana Gap free of MihailoviÃ¤Â, and orchestrated Dimitrije LjotiÃ¤Â's powers as of now in the Ljubljana Gap to meet him close BihaÃ¤Â in western Bosnia to help his development. When he left MihailoviÃ¤Â, he was joined by Chetnik ideologue DragiÄºÄa VasiÃ¤Â and the Chetnik separations instructed by OstojiÃ¤Â and BaÃ¤ÂoviÃ¤Â just as countless. 

So as to get to BihaÃ¤Â, ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â made a protected direct concurrence with components of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia (HOS) and with the Montenegrin dissident Sekula DrljeviÃ¤Â. The subtleties of the understanding are not known, however it shows up ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â, OstojiÃ¤Â and BaÃ¤ÂoviÃ¤Â and their troops were intended to cross the Sava stream into Slavonia where they would be lined up with DrljeviÃ¤Â as the Montenegrin National Army with ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â holding operational order. The Chetniks in any case, seem to have endeavored to beat the HOS powers and DrljeviÃ¤Â by sending their debilitated and injured over the waterway, yet holding their fit troops south of the stream, after which they started moving them westwards. Badgering by both the HOS troops and Partisans, they achieved the Vrbas stream, which they started to cross. In the Battle of LijevÃ¤Âe Field, north of Banja Luka, the joined Chetnik compel was seriously beaten by a solid HOS drive which had German-provided tanks. 

Following this thrashing and the deserting of one of their sub-units to DrljeviÃ¤Â, ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â was instigated to arrange straightforwardly with the pioneers of the HOS powers about the further development of the Chetniks towards the Ljubljana Gap. Be that as it may, this seems to have been a snare, as he was assaulted and caught by them on his way to the gathering. As indicated by the antiquarian Professor Jozo Tomasevich, precisely what happened after his catch isn't clear, yet BaÃ¤ÂoviÃ¤Â, ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â, VasiÃ¤Â, OstojiÃ¤Â were consequently slaughtered, alongside some Serbian Orthodox ministers and others. As per a few sources, on 20 April, ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â, BaÃ¤ÂoviÃ¤Â, VasiÃ¤Â and OstojiÃ¤Â were taken to the Stara GradiÄºÄka jail, close Jasenovac. The UstaÄºÄe accumulated them in a field nearby 5,000 other Chetnik detainees and organized DrljeviÃ¤Â and his devotees to choose 150 Chetnik officers and non-warrior erudite people for execution. ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â, BaÃ¤ÂoviÃ¤Â, VasiÃ¤Â and OstojiÃ¤Â were among those chosen. They and the others were stacked onto pontoons by the UstaÄºÄe and taken over the Sava River, gone forever. It is accounted for that they were executed either in the Jasenovac inhumane imprisonment itself, or in a bog in its region. The site of the Jasenovac Memorial Site says OstojiÃ¤Â was executed at the camp by the UstaÄºÄe in 1945. The area of OstojiÃ¤Â's grave, assuming any, is obscure. Both the NDH powers and DrljeviÃ¤Â had explanations behind capturing ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â. The NDH powers were roused by the mass fear submitted by ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â on the Muslim populace in SandÄºÅ¾ak and southeastern Bosnia, while DrljeviÃ¤Â was against ÃÂuriÄºÄiÃ¤Â's help of an association of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to DrljeviÃ¤Â's dissidence.
