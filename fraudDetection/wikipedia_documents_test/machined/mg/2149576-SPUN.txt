The band visited in the meantime years, making positive informal. In 2004, the band joined Blink-182 out and about for a series of shows, which prompted their bassist, Mark Hoppus, joining the band in the studio for his initially delivering exertion. 

Recorded more than about a month and a half in late 2004, "Submit This to Memory" was made generally at Seedy Underbelly Studios, a rural home changed over into a studio in Los Angeles' Valley Village area. The collection was composed in part in the place where they grew up of Minneapolis and halfway in Los Angeles, amid a period in which frontman Justin Pierre was looking for treatment for liquor misuse. He sought after his lyricism to all the more likely underline narrating, motivated by the verses of Tom Waits, Ben Folds and John K. Samson. Hoppus essentially worked with the band on finishing melody plans.

The collection crested at number two on "Bulletin" Independent Albums outline. The singles' music recordings accomplished revolution on link channel MTV2 while the band visited close by Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco on the Nintendo Fusion Tour, later additionally joining the Warped Tour for a stretch. In 2014, "The A.V. Club" alluded to the collection as an exemplary of pop punk, "brimming with snare loaded, console helped tunes whose splendid tunes donÃ¢ÂÂt veil the despondency and self-hatred hiding underneath them." 

Movement City Soundtrack framed in 1997 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The band marked to Epitaph Records in 2003 in the wake of account "I Am the Movie", their presentation, autonomously and selling duplicates of it out of the back of their visit van for a year. Movement City turned out to be a piece of a huge number of Epitaph signings, including Matchbook Romance, Scatter the Ashes and From First To Last, in the midst of concerns the Southern California name had strayed excessively a long way from its foundations, and appeared "excessively emotional." By the time the band started generation on their sophomore record, "I Am the Movie" had sold almost 62,000 duplicates. The gathering had collected noteworthy buzz, and were viewed as an "unquestionable requirement see" follow up on the Warped Tour 2004. 

Imprint Hoppus' contribution comes from when an Atticus Clothing worker played him "I Am the Movie". He was so taken with it that he raved about the band in "Moving Stone", welcoming them to open for his gathering, Blink-182 on their 2004 European visit. On the trek, he turned out to be great companions with the artists. He revealed to them that he had obtained a wealth of chronicle rigging and speakers for the past Blink-182 collection and told the band of his enthusiasm for account music from a creation point of view. At the last show of the visit, guitarist Joshua Cain went to Hoppus' changing area and requested that he produce their next record. In spite of the fact that Hoppus had never created anything, he was eager to be a piece of the collection and acknowledged the offer. 

The band initially started composition tunes at their practice space in the place where they grew up of Minneapolis, which they nicknamed the "Prison", because of its capacity to "suck the life and vitality out of the band." For Pierre, the collection came at the precarious edge of a transitional period for him, in which he started to look for treatment for liquor misuse. He left the band amid the composition stages for Los Angeles where he moved in with Epitaph author Brett Gurewitz and started going to Alcoholics Anonymous gatherings. A short time later, the band rejoined Pierre in Los Angeles to start recording demos for a month; the difference in view achieved new vitality for the gathering, as per Pierre. "Submit This to Memory" would be the principal collection by the band to include material made by every performer in the gathering, as past discharges had highlighted tunes written in the years before every part joining. What's more, the band had additional time and assets to invest energy chipping away at the collection. "It was additionally the first occasion when we had significantly additional time and cash to go in and feel like we were making a genuine record this time, while "I Am the Movie" was recorded in little portions all over and in the end sorted out," said drummer Tony Thaxton. 

Recording sessions for "Submit This to Memory", which were reserved by Hoppus, were booked more than about a month and a half at Seedy Underbelly Studios in Valley Village, a region of Los Angeles, California, which was really a leased house that had once had a place with Jeff Porcaro, the drummer for Toto. The band had, as indicated by Hoppus, "a million thoughts and a ton of vitality and energy to make an extraordinary record". Pierre took a stab at the record to have a sound that taken after the groups Braid, Superchunk, Jawbox and the Pixies. Living in a suburb, the neighbors had called police to the band and Hoppus a few times for being excessively noisy during the evening time, particularly when Hoppus brought a Roland TR-808 drum machine outside to take a shot at a melody late around evening time. As per Pierre, Hoppus was not keen on putting his own stamp on the music, but instead drawing out the best in what he found in the gathering. Hoppus by and large demonstrated his generation after Jerry Finn (a long-lasting maker of Blink-182), and in this manner it included much watching and tuning in. "Imprint continued letting us know, 'Your name will be significantly greater on the front than mine is on the back'," reviewed Justin Pierre, "So he would toss proposals out there however dependably state, 'Don't hesitate to turn these down.' And we would!" 

Pierre described Hoppus as both "extremely included and not included," with his activity as maker chiefly giving notes on the sound of the instruments and offering proposals to improve melodies. Hoppus generally worked with the band on courses of action, trusting the tunes were excessively pressed and "expected to relax". Hoppus referenced that name governmental issues had frustrated the imagination of Blink's "Remove Your Pants and Jacket" (2001), and did not have any desire to see a similar destiny come upon the band. He was "fastidious" in his methodology, mostly because of the way that it was his first creation work. Hoppus was the person who exhorted the band to blend two already disconnected songsÃ¢ÂÂa slower, gentler tune and a throbbing drum trackÃ¢ÂÂinto one, which progressed toward becoming "Time Turned Fragile". The frontman of Fall Out Boy, Patrick Stump, contributed visitor vocals to "Everything Is Alright", and Hoppus to "Executioner". With generation finished, Hoppus was energized for the band that he felt was on the cusp of "extraordinary things", reviewing, "Following a month and a half of these folks living all together in two rooms of this house with a studio appended they made this incredibly excellent and legit collection. Justin's verses are so ruthlessly honest." The gathering finished chronicle in November 2004, and made a decision about last blends over the between time months. Pierre later called "Submit This to Memory" his undisputed top choice collection by the band. 

In a 2015 meeting, Pierre takes note of that fans have revealed to him that they discover "Submit This to Memory" a "winter collection," to which he concurs, noticing the accidental notice of the new year in a few tunes. His lyricism on "Submit This to Memory" incorporates around change and, in his words, "being a finished fuckup, yet, in the meantime, being to some degree effective". On the record, he "addresses the topics of substance misuse, mental disarranges and coming up short connections." Pierre wrote "Everything Is Alright" as an outline of his OCD (ObsessiveÃ¢ÂÂcompulsive confusion) propensities. He proposed to use his social uneasiness and fears in the tune's structure, which he has since utilized in various different organizations. "I donÃ¢ÂÂt think the [phrase] "offhanded" is right, however itÃ¢ÂÂs something where the refrains are a certain something and after that the chorale is another, yet it's similar to giving yourself a get up and go talk," said Pierre. The melody's verses incorporate despising such commonplace things as "amusement parks, flying, outsiders, [and] holding up in line," things that Pierre really loathed at the season of the tune's composition. For the record, he planned to streamline his verses to upgrade narrating and he drew motivation from Tom Waits, Ben Folds and John K. Samson's composition styles. Keeping in the Waits/Folds motivation, Pierre endeavored to compose from someone else's perspective; on account of "Time Turned Fragile", it is sung from the point of view of his dad. 

Pierre has by and large named half of the collection's composition as being finished while intoxicated and the other half while getting calm. For instance, he wrote the verses to "Appealing Today" and "Time Turned Fragile" while alcoholic in his condo, in a "tragic and forlorn spot." In this methodology, words generally "just turned out," and were not generously updated. What's more, he was tuning in to the 2003 collection "Remaking Site" by the Weakerthans, and wound up motivated by the songwriting of frontman John K. Samson. Pierre would regularly take verses from different groups melodies for tune titles; "Time Turned Fragile" is lifted from a verse in Limbeck's "Julia", while "Together We'll Ring in the New Year" was pulled from the Tom Waits tune "Please Wake Me Up". "L.G. FUAD"Ã¢ÂÂwhich means "How about we Get Fucked Up and Die"Ã¢ÂÂgrew out of a night on Motion City Soundtrack's 2003 UK visit with The All-American Rejects, in which the last band's product supervisor was seriously intoxicated. He remained on the product stand and yelled what turned into the tune's hold back. All included discovered extraordinary silliness in the "mantra", which proceeded to be imprinted on business cards as a joke. "Hold Me Down" was propelled by a previous flat mate of Pierre's. After she had moved out, Pierre found a part of her math homework in a lounge chair pad, prompting him envisioning a situation of finding a letter from a withdrew darling. 

The collection has been called authoritative of pop punk. Joshua Cain expelled this mark, commenting, "I certainly wouldn't think of us as a pop-punk band. Our persuasions are increasingly founded on '90s groups like Superchunk and early Weezer." 

Upon its discharge, "Submit This to Memory" got general recognition from music pundits. Scott Heisel of "Elective Press" composed that ""Memory" is a roused, develop sophomore circle stuffed with appealing, shrewd pop-shake." Allmusic's Johnny Loftus considered the band more insightful and modern than their Warped Tour peers: "Movement City Soundtrack['s] contemplative recollections, stories of separating, and unhinged scans for answers [are] realer than the following pop-punk combo on the fourfold late spring bill." Jennifer Maerz of "Diversion Weekly" finished her audit with the note that "MCS' smooth, taking off songs of praise at last join the spirits of the individuals who see themselves, similar to Pierre, as 'dormant corners of this unfilled casing.'" Mark Griffiths of "Kerrang!" expressed, "It's a splendid and stimulating issue [...] and is, to put it plainly, phenomenal." "The Washington Post" Marianne Meyer opined that the record "agilely moves from touchy rhythms to truly delicate assessment." 

Jessica Grose of "Turn" positively contrasted it with Blink-182's "Douche of the State" (1999). Tony McMenamin of "Blender" esteemed it the distribution's collection of the month, calling it "a charged blend of right away snappy pop-punk lashings and grave acoustic wailings."

It graphed better on the magazine's Independent Albums outline, where it crested at number two. The last official gauge put it at 285,000 collections sold in the U.S., however Pierre said in 2015 meeting that the number is more like 500,000. The band's music recordings discovered ordinary turn on systems, for example, MTV2, and the band additionally performed on "Late Night with Conan O'Brien". "Moving Stone"s Lauren Gilton considered the collection a sleeper hit. All things considered, the bandÃ¢ÂÂs leap forward brought naysayers, and the gathering progressed toward becoming focuses for commentators of pop punk: "[the band was] every now and again portrayed as the kind of ultra-business punk poseurs who water down the class to the point of suffocating it." 

Ensuing audits of the collection have kept on being sure. In 2014, "The A.V. Club" alluded to the collection as a great of pop punk, "brimming with snare loaded, console helped tunes whose brilliant tunes donÃ¢ÂÂt veil the misery and self-hatred hiding underneath them." Reyan Ali of "Cincinnati CityBeat" composed that "Submit This to Memory" "totally drains engage," remarking, "Even with all the critical topical issue PierreÃ¢ÂÂs verses secured, [...] the band encircled the words with music that shone, attributable to spunky, propelled snares, full-sounding record creation and adequate portions of Moog." "Elective Press" Tyler Sharp considered the record a "work of art," while Taylor Morgan of "OC Weekly" called it "the soundtrack of millennial youth, reminiscent of breakups, making out, messing about, and growing up."
