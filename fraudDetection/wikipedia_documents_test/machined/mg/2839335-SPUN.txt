1821 Norfolk and Long Island tropical storm 

The 1821 Norfolk and Long Island Hurricane was one of four known tropical violent winds that have made landfall in New York City. Another, much progressively extraordinary tropical storm in pre-Columbian occasions (at some point somewhere in the range of 1278 and 1438) left proof that was recognized in southern New Jersey by paleotempestological look into. The third was the 1893 New York typhoon, and the fourth was Hurricane Irene in 2011. 

The first of three recorded tropical tornados recorded in the 1821 Atlantic typhoon season, the tempest that would in the end strike New York was first seen off the southeast United States coast on September 1, with winds evaluated in overabundance of 135Ã¢Â mph (215Ã¢Â km/h). It moved shorewards close Wilmington, North Carolina, and go close Norfolk, Virginia before traveling through the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey simply inland. On September 3, the tropical storm struck around close Jamaica Bay, which later turned out to be a piece of New York City, and on September 4 it was seen over New England. This was only 6Ã¢Â years after the damaging Great September Gale of 1815. 

A tropical tornado was first seen on September 1 off the southeast bank of the United States. At first, it was accepted to be a similar tempest that struck Guadeloupe around the same time, however ensuing exploration showed there were two separate tempests. The typhoon followed by the Bahamas while following commonly northward, and it accomplished serious sea tempest status over the western Atlantic Ocean. As it moved toward the United States coastline, the tropical storm was extreme, with winds assessed at over 135Ã¢Â mph (215Ã¢Â km/h) and conceivably as solid as 160Ã¢Â mph (260Ã¢Â km/h), or a Category 5 typhoon on the SaffirÃ¢ÂÂSimpson Hurricane Scale. Late on September 2, the storm made landfall close Wilmington, North Carolina and later swung toward the upper east to cross the Pamlico Sound. 

The storm quickened northeastward, and disregarded the Hampton Roads zone right off the bat September 3. In the wake of intersection the Chesapeake Bay, the typhoon crossed the Delmarva Peninsula close to the Atlantic coastline, and at around 1500ÃÂ UTC the eye ignored legitimately Cape Henlopen, Delaware; a thirty-minute time of quiet was accounted for. It proceeded over the Delaware Bay and later disregarded Cape May, New Jersey, where a fifteen-minute quiet was accounted for. Present day analysts gauge it was a CategoryÃ¢Â 3 or CategoryÃ¢Â 4 typhoon after striking New Jersey, one of only a handful couple of tropical storms to hit the state. Moving aground at exceptionally low tide, it paralleled the state's coastline simply inland, and in the wake of leaving into Lower New York Bay the tropical storm made landfall on New York City at around 1930ÃÂ UTC on September 3; this makes it the main serious typhoon to legitimately hit the city. An insignificant sea tempest in 1893 likewise made landfall on what later turned out to be a piece of New York City. One present day scientist assesses the sea tempest was moving at a forward speed of 35Ã¢Â mph (55Ã¢Â km/h), and after moving aground had a weight of 965Ã¢Â mbar. The tropical storm proceeded with northeastward through New England, and in the wake of entering Massachusetts on September 4 its precise way was obscure; one analyst evaluated the tornado followed northeastward until losing its personality over southeastern Maine, while another surveyed the tempest as going far toward the west of Maine. 

In view of the game plan of impacts in New England, meteorologist William C. Redfield reasoned that the breeze field and focal point of tropical violent winds are roundabout; beforehand the breezes were accepted to be in a straight line. 

In North Carolina, an incredible tempest flood overwhelmed vast bits of Portsmouth Island; inhabitants evaluated the island would have been totally submerged had the most noticeably bad of the tempest went on for two additional hours. Solid breezes happened crosswise over eastern North Carolina, bringing about in any event 76Ã¢Â destroyed houses. Various individuals were slaughtered in Currituck. 

The most grounded breezes of the sea tempest went on for around an hour in southeastern Virginia, after which the tempest quickly decreased. A few houses were totally annihilated, with numerous others accepting moderate to extreme harm. The breezes demolished the majority of the top of the town hall, and removed trees over the area; fallen tree appendages harmed a stone scaffold in Norfolk. The tropical storm delivered a solid tempest flood along the Virginia coastline, which achieved 10Ã¢Â feet (3Ã¢Â m) at Pungoteague on the Delmarva Peninsula. The tempest flood, which achieved a few hundred yards inland, devastated two scaffolds and overflowed numerous distribution centers along the Elizabeth River. Unpleasant waves grounded the USS "Guerriere" and the USS "Congress", and furthermore demolished a few clippers and brigs. Along the eastern shore, the tempest flood overwhelmed obstruction islands along the Atlantic coastline, causing serious harvest harm and bringing down numerous trees. A few houses were annihilated, and at Pungoteague the effect of the sea tempest was depicted as "unexampled demolition"; five individuals suffocated in Chincoteague. Thought about a standout amongst the most savage sea tempests on record in the Mid-Atlantic, the storm caused $200,000 in harm in Virginia (1821ÃÂ USD, $3.1Ã¢Â million 2007ÃÂ USD). 

Intense breezes influenced the Delmarva Peninsula; on Poplar Island in Talbot County, Maryland, twists crested at 1600ÃÂ UTC on September 3. The most grounded breezes were limited to the Atlantic coastline, with external rainbands creating overwhelming precipitation in Washington, D.C. what's more, Baltimore, Maryland. Furious breezes were seen in Cape Henlopen, Delaware, with the most grounded hurricanes happening after the eye ignored the region. 

After making landfall on Cape May, New Jersey, the violent wind created a 5-foot (1.5Ã¢Â m) storm flood on the Delaware Bay side of the city. Going on for a few hours, the storm constrain winds were depicted as "[blowing] with incredible savagery", causing broad pulverization over the area. Wind blasts in Cape May County came to over , and around in Atlantic County. In Little Egg Harbor, the typhoon harmed to the port. Solid breezes came to as far inland as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where winds of over 40Ã¢Â mph (60Ã¢Â km/h) brought down trees and smokestacks; in the city, precipitation gathered to 3.92Ã¢Â inches (99.6Ã¢Â mm). Further toward the north, the sea tempest demolished a windmill at Bergen Point, New Jersey. Despite the fact that the sea tempest struck at low tide, it delivered a tempest flood of over 29Ã¢Â feet (9Ã¢Â m) along a few parts of the New Jersey coastline, causing noteworthy overwash. 

The sea tempest created a tempest flood of 13Ã¢Â feet (4Ã¢Â m) in just a single hour at Battery Park, a record just broken 191 years after the fact by Hurricane Sandy. Manhattan Island was totally overflowed to Canal Street; one typhoon specialist commented that the tempest flood flooding would have been much more terrible, had the tropical storm not struck at low tide. In any case, couple of passings were accounted for in the city, since the flooding influenced neighborhoods significantly less populated than today. The sea tempest brought light precipitation as it passed New York City, however solid breezes left extreme harm over the city. Elevated tides happened along the Hudson River. Solid waves and winds blew numerous boats shorewards along Long Island. One ship sank, slaughtering 17Ã¢Â people. Along Long Island, the breezes demolished a few structures and left yields annihilated. 

In New England, the typhoon created far reaching intense breezes, with harm most prominent in Connecticut. The Black Rock Harbor Light in Black Rock, Connecticut, was annihilated on September 21. Somewhere else in the express, the breezes harmed or crushed chapels, houses and little structures. Moderate harvest harm to natural product was accounted for too. Solid breezes stretched out into eastern Massachusetts, however little harm was accounted for in the Boston region. Sea tempest drive twists came to as far north as Maine. 

The Swiss Re insurance agency appraises that a sea tempest with the careful track of the 1821 tempest would cause $107Ã¢Â billion in direct property harm in 2014. Harm would reach over $1Ã¢Â billion in Atlantic and Ocean areas in New Jersey and New Haven, and Hartford regions in Connecticut. Harm would reach over $2Ã¢Â billion in Nassau and Suffolk districts on Long Island, just as Fairfield County, Connecticut. Circuitous misfortunes, including lost expense income and lower land, would reach about $250Ã¢Â billion across the country for a comparative tempest. The harm would be far more prominent than what happened amid Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which caused $65Ã¢Â billion in harm in the nation when it struck New Jersey.
