ChÄËteau de Verteuil 

The ChÄËteau de Verteuil is an authentic structure in Charente, France. It goes back to 1080 and has since been broadly reconstructed, albeit twelfth century dividers remain. The chÄËteau has dependably been in the property of the La Rochefoucauld family. 

Amid the Hundred Years' War (1337Ã¢ÂÂ1453) the chÄËteau was involved a few times by the English. It was devastated in 1442, however was soon remade utilizing the first stones. In the religious wars of sixteenth and seventeenth hundreds of years the chÄËteau was a base for Huguenot powers, and in 1650 it was incompletely pulverized by illustrious troops. Another chÄËteau was raised however it got broad harm in a flame in 1793 amid the French Revolution. The chÄËteau was redesigned in the sentimental style after the Bourbon Restoration of 1815, and has been widely altered from that point forward. Amid World War II (1939Ã¢ÂÂ45) the chÄËteau housed French troops and evacuees from Alsace-Lorraine in 1940 and for a while it was incompletely involved by some German units. In 1944 a few individuals from the "maquis" were covered up there. The chÄËteau was recorded as a "landmark historique" on 31 March 1966, and acquired full insurance on 19 November 2010. 

The present chÄËteau, structured on a triangular arrangement, has five conelike towers and a watchtower topped by slate rooftops. Archeologists have revealed hints of the more established structures on the site going back to the eleventh century. The designer Frantz Jourdain revamped the inside of the fourteenth century tower as a library for the Rochefoucault family in 1893. The Hunt of the Unicorn woven artworks of the structure, which hung in the main room, were rediscovered in 1850; they were later sold to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1923. 

The palace is in a key position, commanding the town of Verteuil-sur-Charente and the Charente valley. 

In the past it controlled the street from Limoges to La Rochelle, on the course between the courts of France and Spain. "Verteuil" was regularly utilized in the Middle Ages to assign a strengthened spot. 

Jean Froissart () depicted it as ""un meult post chasteau en Poictou sur les walks du Limousin et de la Saintonge"" (a solid manor in Poitou on the outskirts of Limousin and Saintonge). 

The chÄËteau, a couple of miles north of AngoulÄÅme and in certainty in Angoumois, was later utilized as the nation seat of the La Rochefoucauld family. 

The ChÄËteau de Verteuil is recorded in 1080 as the property of the Lord of La Rochefoucauld. From that point forward the mansion has quite often had a place with an individual from this family. The principal recorded fruitful attack was in 1135, by Count Wulgrin II of AngoulÄÅme (Ã¢ÂÂ1140), when the palace had a place with Aymar II de la Rochefoucauld. Threats proceeded between their relatives, William VI of AngoulÄÅme (kicked the bucket 1179) and Guy IV of la Rochefoucauld, however had stopped by 1170 when the two of them went to the commitment of the congregation of Saint-Amant-de-Boixe. Louis VII of France (1120Ã¢ÂÂ80) and Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122Ã¢ÂÂ1204) may have remained at Verteuil in 1137. Eleanor's mom was a Rochefoucauld, and because of the agitated condition of the nation the youthful couple just remained in safe and ideally well-sustained places in their voyage from Bordeaux to Paris. 

Ruler Philip VI of France (1293Ã¢ÂÂ1350) remained at the palace in 1332. Because of the Anglo-French threats the mansion was assuming an inexorably imperative job. Amid the Hundred Years' War the English were given the palace from 1360 to 1385 by the Treaty of BrÄÅ¡tigny. The stronghold was yielded reluctantly to Edward III of England's official in France, John Chandos, on 25 October 1361. He had conveyed the sibling of the attendant to the stronghold and took steps to execute him except if there was a quick capitulation. French troops directed by the Duke of Bouillon and Geoffroy III of Rochefoucauld laid attack to the stronghold in 1380, yet it didn't yield until five years after the fact. The English later recaptured the mansion, yet in 1442 Charles VII of France (1403Ã¢ÂÂ61) at long last caught it from the English. 

The Rochefoucaulds, who had assumed a noteworthy job in the battle against the English, presently started to violate AngoulÄÅme. Charles VII returned, and this time demolished the mansion, generally by flame. In any case, the stones were recuperated and the mansion modified. In 1446 the Rochefoucaulds figured out how to acquire the ruler's absolution and consent to assemble a cautious divider and two towers in Verteuil to reestablish the customary shelter of the townspeople. Under this appearance they made the stronghold among the best protected in France. 

The dividers were reestablished as well as strengthened utilizing the most recent procedures. 

FranÄÂ§ois I de La Rochefoucauld (passed on 1541) was the back up parent of Francis I of France (1494Ã¢ÂÂ1547), who visited Verteuil in 1516. Anne de Polignac, widow of Count FranÄÂ§ois II de la Rochefoucauld, got the Emperor Charles V (1500Ã¢ÂÂ1558) in Verteuil on 6 December 1539. Her mom's sister was the spouse of the antiquarian Philippe de Commines. She made numerous enhancements to the chÄËteau, and assembled the celebrated library. In 1558 King Henry II of France (1519Ã¢ÂÂ59) remained at Verteuil with his child Charles, Duke of Orleans (1550Ã¢ÂÂ74), and his girl Elizabeth (1545Ã¢ÂÂ68), the future spouse of Philip II of Spain (1527Ã¢ÂÂ98). 

FranÄÂ§ois III de La Rochefoucauld (1521Ã¢ÂÂ72) progressed toward becoming brother by marriage of the Protestant Louis, Prince of CondÄÅ¡ (1530Ã¢ÂÂ1569), and in 1560 sorted out a gathering at Verteuil among CondÄÅ¡ and the Cardinal Georges d'Armagnac (Ã¢ÂÂ1585) legate of Pope Pius IV, trying to anticipate further clash. After two years FranÄÂ§ois III had put his support behind the Protestants. In 1567 the sixth national synod of the Reformed Church of France was held at the chÄËteau, and the following year it was an encouraging point for Huguenot troops that went to the guide of La Rochelle when it was assaulted by Catholics. The chÄËteau was visited by the future ruler Henry IV of France (1553Ã¢ÂÂ1610), Catherine de' Medici (1519Ã¢ÂÂ89) and her little girl, Margaret (1553Ã¢ÂÂ1615), Louis XIII of France (1601Ã¢ÂÂ43), Anne of Austria (1601Ã¢ÂÂ66) and the Queen Mother Marie de' Medici (1575Ã¢ÂÂ1642). 

In 1650 FranÄÂ§ois VI, Duc de La Rochefoucauld (1613Ã¢ÂÂ1680) assembled in excess of 2,000 knights whom he prompted Bordeaux to help the nobles in the second Fronde revolt. 

Not long after Charles de La Porte, Marshall of France and Duc de la Meilleraye (1602Ã¢ÂÂ64) assaulted and took the manor with imperial troops. 

He crushed the Orangery and mostly devastated the chÃ¢teau. The dividers of the north wing were seriously harmed, the towers destroyed, the drawbridge evacuated and the profound discard that guarded the northwest of the stronghold was mostly filled. 

The palace stayed tenable, and in 1651 was visited by the Prince de Conti, however he was compelled to pull back by fighters of the Queen's regiment. They introduced an army of 150 men at Verteuil. 

FranÄÂ§ois VI was ousted by Louis XIV of France (1638Ã¢ÂÂ1715) after the revolt. 

In 1652 FranÄÂ§ois VI came back to the ChÄËteau de Verteuil, where he invested the vast majority of his energy until 1659 composition his "MÄÅ¡moires". 

He was reestablished to support in 1662 and in 1665 distributed his "Maximes". 

FranÄÂ§ois passed on in Paris in 1680 however was covered in the Franciscan church of Verteuil, which had been established in 1470 by his precursor, John, sixteenth ruler of Rochefoucauld and thirteenth master of Verteuil. The majority of John's successors were covered in this house of prayer until the Reign of Terror started in 1793. 

There were some recognized guests amid the rule of Louis XV of France (1710Ã¢ÂÂ1774). Elisabeth Farnese (1692Ã¢ÂÂ1766) the second spouse of Philip V of Spain (1683Ã¢ÂÂ1746), invested energy at Verteuil. The English agronomist Arthur Young in his record of a Journey to France in 1787 gave an itemized and complimenting portrayal of Verteuil, adulating the rural upgrades and the life of the populace. 

At the season of the flare-up of the French Revolution (1789Ã¢ÂÂ99) there were phenomenal relations between the La Rochefoucauld family and the general population of Verteuil. As indicated by Marquis de Amodio, nothing may have happened to the chÄËteau on the off chance that it had not been for Ruffec's Committee of Public Safety and the Convention part Gilbert Romme, who is credited with consuming the greater part of the documents at Verteuil and thirty representations. 

A flame mishap happened in 1793 that crushed the extensive exhibition that associated the sanctuary toward the north pinnacle, and the west essence of the vast focal pinnacle was genuinely harmed. The flame spread along the rooftops and turrets of the northwest wing, and the upper piece of the north pinnacle was additionally scorched. The house of prayer was sacked, and the blazes annihilated its exterior and part of its north divider. The sepulcher was not harmed. The vast majority of the floors and chimneys in the chÄËteau and every one of the entryways, windows and woodwork were hopelessly pulverized. 

After the Revolution the senior part of the Rochefoucauld family recaptured ownership. The chÄËteau was remodeled in the main portion of the nineteenth century. The work was attempted by the La VillÄÅ¡ons in the sentimental style that went with the Bourbon Restoration after 1815. They added beautifications to the windows and made false bolt openings, added two towers toward the south veneer, included an ostentatious balustrade and dormer windows, and made changes to part of the house of prayer. 

Amid the Second French Empire (1852Ã¢ÂÂ70) further changes were made, fundamentally to the inside. Hippolyte de La Rochefoucauld (1804Ã¢ÂÂ63), who had been serve emissary in Germany and Florence, brought a fine gathering of furniture and eighteenth century Venetian glass ceiling fixtures when he resigned. He reestablished the incredible stone staircase. Affected by EugÄÂ¨ne Viollet-le-Duc he chose to change the expansive East pinnacle into a library. He obstructed old openings and penetrated substantial new windows in the old dividers. 

He authorized a duplicate of the statue by Didier DÄÅ¡but on the exterior of the HÄ'tel de Ville, Paris of the creator of the "Maximes". 

Amid World War II (1939Ã¢ÂÂ45) the chÄËteau housed French troops and displaced people from Alsace-Lorraine in 1940. 

For a while it was mostly involved by some German units. In 1944 a few individuals from the "maquis" were covered up there. 

Different incredibly fascinating archeological finds have been made since the war. 

Research begun by Count Gabriel de La Rochefoucauld, which had been hindered by the war, revealed a covered piece of the manor dating to the twelfth and thirteenth hundreds of years, including the room that housed the drawbridge instrument. 

A twelfth century stairway was found that drove down to a lower house of prayer from the eleventh century, in fantastic condition, whose presence was totally obscure before 1958. Different hints of the early structures have been found. 

The chÄËteau was recorded as a "landmark historique" on 31 March 1966, with the veneers, rooftops and substructure secured. 

The site was totally ensured on 19 November 2010 as it was trusted that the chÄËteau, the inside patio and the land toward the north may hold archeological remains. 

The present chÄËteau with its five conelike towers and watchtower topped by slate rooftops started to be worked in the fifteenth century, and was adjusted and expanded a few times from that point forward. A recreation center was worked in the nineteenth century through which a wide garage conveyed guests to the fundamental structure. This depends on a focal square pinnacle with a pyramidal rooftop. 

The square keep is the fundamental outstanding piece of the medieval structure. 

The present structure is planned on a triangular arrangement. The huge pinnacle at the tip of the triangle is the medieval gatehouse, from which wings reach out on either side. A separated pinnacle that currently has the library on two stories partitions the window ornament divider on the east. 

The structures in the southeast were barely influenced by the nineteenth century reclamation separated from the house of prayer. A significant number of the dividers of the twelfth century tower have endure, incompletely remade in the fifteenth century, and there are hints of a Romanesque house of prayer. The recreation center was upgraded in the nineteenth century, encased in dry stone dividers with a few passageways. These have since been expelled, as have the rich patio nurseries of the eighteenth century. A few follows stay as boxwood, some back roads, the pools on the two porches and the rockery. 

A stock was made in 1728 after the passing of Duke Francois VIII. 

The library contained 1,069 works. 

The main room incorporated an exquisite bed with lavish fittings of violet velvet weaved in gold and silver, easy chairs upholstered in a similar velvet, a substantial Turkish floor covering in a recess, a walnut table and different things. 

The engineer Frantz Jourdain redesigned the inside of the fourteenth century tower as a library for the Rochefoucault family in 1893. He structured it as a ""chapelle intellectuelle"" to show memorabilia of the well known creator. Adrien Karbowsky contributed embellishing paintings to the room. 

Hippolyte's child, Count Aimery de La Rochefoucauld kept on gathering the trinkets of his predecessors, transforming the chÄËteau into a kind of family historical center. He refurbished the church and included recolored glass windows. 

Seven of The Hunt of the Unicorn embroidered works of art were recorded in a 1680 stock of the Paris assets of Duke Francois VI. From different representative themes, the embroidered works of art appear to have been made to praise a marriage, likely that of Anne of Brittany (1477Ã¢ÂÂ1514) and Louis XII of France (1462Ã¢ÂÂ1515). The regal arms of Louis and Anne would have once enriched the sky in the majority of the embroidered works of art. 

The 1728 stock recorded five of The Hunt of the Unicorn woven artworks hanging in the chÄËteau's main room. The embroidered works of art, which were then well more than two hundred years of age, were practically half exhausted. Two a greater amount of the embroidered works of art were in "a substantial lower lobby close to the house of prayer, by and by filling in as a capacity place for furniture". They were depicted as "two bits of embroidered artwork of the Unicorn, torn in different spots". 

Amid the French Revolution, Ruffec's "ComitÄÅ¡ de Surveillance" decided that the old embroidered works of art of the chÄËteau could be protected, since they bore no illustrious emblem. It appears that the symbol had been removed so the embroidered works of art would not be devastated by the crowd when the chÄËteau was plundered in 1793. They were taken by laborers who utilized them to shield their potatoes from solidifying and to cover their rspalier trees. 

Tally Hippolyte rediscovered the Unicorn embroidered works of art of the chÄËteau during the 1850s, being utilized by a worker to cover vegetables in his horse shelter. Subsequent to being reestablished they were hung in a salon of the chÄËteau in 1856. Xavier Barbier de Montault saw the embroidered works of art at Verteuil during the 1880s and said that, albeit "to some degree reestablished, [they] are of a freshness and of a unique beauty". 

In 1923, the woven artworks were sold to John D. Rockefeller Jr. what's more, sent to New York, where they are presently in plain view in The Cloisters medieval displays.
