The operators head to the accident site in Northville, New York, and go to a NTSB meeting where Flight 549's last transmissions are appeared. Mulder speculates that the plane was constrained somewhere around outsiders endeavoring to steal Max; the NTSB group, driven by boss agent Mike Millar (Joe Spano), rejects his cases. 

Whenever Mulder and Scully review the accident site, they understand that there is a nine-minute uniqueness between the accident and the time on the exploited people's wristwatches, showing missing time. Mulder trusts that Max was kidnapped from the plane and that his body won't be found. In the interim, Scott Garrett, a Man in Black acting like a NTSB agent, takes the zip firearm from the professional killer's body and deletes his face and fingerprints with corrosive. Larold Rehbun, a traveler who sat alongside Max, is discovered alive. His wounds show introduction to radiation. 

After being defied by Scully, Sharon denies that Max brought a radioactive substance on board the plane, yet unveils that she isn't really Max's sister. She additionally surrenders insights regarding his underground life. Scully in this way reveals to Mulder that Max worked at an atomic weapons gathering office in Colorado under a nom de plume, and trusts that he may have caused the accident subsequent to expediting plutonium load up; Mulder, in any case, trusts that Max was removed the plane by a UFO, and that Rehbun's wounds were brought about by presentation to the art. Scully advises Mulder that Max's body has just been pulled from the accident site. Then, Sharon is stole from her lodging. 

Subsequent to distinguishing Max's body, Mulder finds that the wristwatches have been stolen from different unfortunate casualties. He invalidates the NTSB's authentic clarification of breakdown as a reason for the accident, and is dicey that the genuine reason will be discovered except if they perceive what occurred amid the nine minutes of missing time. The operators visit Sergeant Louis Frish (Tom O'Brien), an air traffic controller from the U.S. Aviation based armed forces who was on obligation amid the accident.

In the wake of discovering Sharon's destroyed lodging, Mulder meets with Millar, who discloses to him that the entryway was pulled off the plane all things considered while it was in flight. Afterward, Frish discovers his associate dead from a faked suicide. A gathering of commandos land to catch Frish, yet he get away.

Amid the generation of the third season, embellishments chief Dave Gauthier developed an intricate fake up of a Boeing 737 plane so as to have the capacity to mimic an accident. Arrangement maker Chris Carter chose to utilize this apparatus amid the fourth season. When thinking about the scene, the craving to add to Fox Mulder's passionate inclusion by having somebody he knew on board prompted the scholars bringing back the character of Max Fenig to be that individual. 

Scott Bellis, who had recently depicted Fenig in the main season scene "Fallen Angel", had tried out for different jobs on the show in the meantime, yet had dependably been rejected by the makers since his character was felt to be excessively vital. Bellis met arrangement star David Duchovny at an exercise center a few times, and gained from him that the character of Max was being considered for a two-section scene.

In that capacity he thought of the plan to execute off Fenig in the initial segment of the scene, which he felt was "a strong decision". 

Gauthier's 737 rigÃ¢ÂÂwhich expected of water driven liquid to constructÃ¢ÂÂwas intended to move over various tomahawks so as to more readily reproduce disturbance; it could pivot 22 degrees every route about its length, and move four feet to either side. The fuselage could be opened up at interims each to all the more likely enable cameras to record inside it. The show's makers needed the plane accident site and examination to be as legitimate as could be expected under the circumstances, so they utilized a National Transportation Safety Board authority to go about as their specialized counselor on the scene to guarantee that everything was appropriately reproduced. The NTSB authorities noticed that the site was valid all around "aside from the smell"; Carter has noticed that this dimension of verisimilitude left a portion of the team individuals "unnerved by their work". Executive Rob Bowman conceded that the scene surpassed its given spending plan, noticing that Carter would frequently protect him from Fox studio authorities irate at his generation costs. Bellis' kidnapping scene, in which his character is suspended through the entryway of the plane, was accomplished by hauling the performing artist out of the plane apparatus with a tackle; extra inclusion was accomplished by rehashing this with a double, who Bellis notes was hauled out of the apparatus "much harder".

Paula Vitaris, composing for "Cinefantastique", evaluated "Tempus Fugit" more than two stars out of four, depicting it as "grasping" with "loads of activity". In any case, Vitaris felt that the temporary utilization of visitor star Scott Bellis was "a waste", and that the revelation of an outsider carcass towards the end "victimizes this account of any vagueness".
