Following the achievement of "Homer at the Bat", the authors needed to attempt a comparable visitor star-substantial scene, aside from with famous people rather than baseball players. The scene demonstrated very troublesome, the same number of the performing artists asked to visitor star declined at last and the rebound exceptional segment was about rejected. Johnny Carson, Hugh Hefner, Bette Midler, Luke Perry, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers (Flea, Anthony Kiedis, Arik Marshall and Chad Smith) all visitor star as themselves and show up on Krusty's unique. Elizabeth Taylor and Barry White, both of whom visitor featured in past scenes this season, show up. The scene is known for being the main scene to date where Marge (in spite of her conspicuousness) does not have a solitary line of exchange. 

One evening while at the same time sitting in front of the TV, Homer and Bart see an exceedingly diverting business for something named "Gabbo"; this is the beginning of a viral showcasing effort. At long last, "Gabbo" is uncovered to be a ventriloquist's sham. Ventriloquist Arthur Crandall declares that Gabbo's new program will air in direct challenge with the built up "Krusty the Klown Show" on every evening at 4 p.m. Gabbo's catchphraseÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ "I'm a terrible wittle boy"Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ immediately charms his target group, and this negatively affects Krusty and his show. The comedian promises to withstand the challenge from the new program, yet Gabbo's merciless strategies rapidly pull in Krusty's gathering of people. Krusty attempts to battle back with his very own sham, yet because of its grim appearance and poor condition, it goes to pieces, and drives away a significant number of the kids in the group of onlookers. To exacerbate the situation, Itchy and Scratchy have moved to the Gabbo Show, constraining Krusty to demonstrate an Eastern Europe Cartoon "Laborer and Parasite" rather, which has neither rhyme nor reason. In the end, Krusty's evaluations hit absolute bottom, and his show is dropped.

Bart and Lisa then help Krusty get over into shape before the uncommon pretense due him drinking a great deal of milkshakes (Krusty didnÃ¢ÂÂt realize he needs to drink exceptional eating routine milkshake to shed pounds.)
