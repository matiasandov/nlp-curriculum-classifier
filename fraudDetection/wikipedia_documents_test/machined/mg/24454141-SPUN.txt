The idea was filled by other local reference books that had met with business accomplishment in 1990s. In the long run, the vision to make the book discovered starting financing from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The book was generally welcomed and turned into a smash hit amid the 2004 Christmas season following its October 2004 discharge. The next May the "Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago" was discharged. Northwestern University joined the Newberry Library/Chicago Historical Society cooperation to distribute the web version. The web release was the second of its sort for a U.S. city.

Dissimilar to asset arrangement endeavors for the urban areas that enlivened this reference book, the work was not limited by as far as possible.

In the long run, the inclusion of the topic extended to incorporate Southwest Michigan and Northwest Indiana. Newberry Library depicts the work as "a standout amongst the most huge authentic tasks embraced over the most recent twenty years". 

Enlivened by reference book assemblage endeavors of urban communities, for example, New York City, Indianapolis and Cleveland, Keating moved toward the Newberry Library in 1991 to strategize on the most proficient method to best to study and show Chicago history. In the long run she and Grossman consented to set up a financing demand from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). Their underlying proposition was declined, yet subsequent to working with Grossman to refine the points of interest of their proposition, the NEH acknowledged their thought. The book adventure was initially declared in 1994 as an undertaking subsidized by a NEH US$200,000 ($ today) allow. The give additionally incorporated a $300,000 challenge give to be met by Newberry Library for the initial three years of work. The first arrangement was to distribute a hardcover book by 2001 and after that to pursue with what at the time was alluded to ambiguously as "hypermedia" in reference to conceivable web and CD-ROM assistant items. After Grossman and Keating acquired the underlying gift, Reiff, a PC innovation master, and reference book veteran Carol J. Summerfield all turned out to be a piece of the group. The editors looked for the counsel of Chicago-territory custodians who were sorted out into center gatherings to decide the correct parts for the arranged distribution.

Daley nor Michael Jordan had passages in light of the fact that just prominent expired people were incorporated. By 1998, the editors had settled on the chapter by chapter guide and started the activity of allocating, altering, reality checking and re-altering the many passages, some of them up to 4000 words. By March 2000, 1100 of the focused on 1400 passages were finished. Additionally, the development of the web had cleared up the vision of an online rendition of the print release. In 2000, the last volume was relied upon to be 1300 pages set for discharge in fall 2002. The web adaptation was normal the next year. By June 2001, almost 1300 of the passages had been submitted and a third had been altered and checked on for precision. The exertion had turned into a $2.5 million exertion and was yearning towards the achievement of prior exhaustive endeavors anticipating a fall 2003 production of a 1.3-million-word 1300-page release. As of now, the last electronic structure accessible through the Chicago Historical Society had been conceptualized. 

By 2001, two releases of "The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History" (1987) had sold 24,000 duplicates; "The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis" (1994) had sold 9000 duplicates and "The Encyclopedia of New York City" (1995) had sold 70,000 (50,000 in its first year). Hardcover forms of these works had sold for $59.95 and up. The business accomplishment of these other local reference books clarified that there is a business opportunity for such items. A few college presses discharged provincial all encompassing distributions in 2004. In April, Rutgers University Press distributed "The Encyclopedia of New Jersey". In September, the University of Nebraska Press distributed "Reference book of the Great Plains". In October, the University of Chicago Press discharged "The Encyclopedia of Chicago".

Utilizing official statements from the Copley News Service, the book was broadly pitched all through the territory of Illinois, and it was even assessed by "The Wall Street Journal". At the point when initially distributed in 2004, the book was on the "USA Today" suggested Christmas presents list. That year it was at the highest point of the Chicago territory success records at book shops amid the Christmas season.

At the season of the print discharge, the online form, known as the "Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago", was being created to incorporate extra highlights, which depended on hyperlinks, that were not accessible in the print version. At the time, it was relied upon to be discharged by the Chicago Historical Society in April 2005. On May 11, the Electronic version, which cost about $1 million to make and is ceaselessly accessible for nothing to people in general, was discharged. It included several extra sections (bringing the aggregate to 1766), in excess of 1000 extra pictures, video of notable figures and occasions, and broad essential source material. The online form incorporates 1000 a greater number of sources than the print version. The Web website incorporates numerous tables and maps that date to the nineteenth Century. Northwestern University media authorities built up the Web design for the electronic rendition. The electronic release made Chicago the second major U.S. city (following Cleveland) with a broad Internet reference book committed to its history and its discharge was secured by papers all through the Midwest. The additional highlights of the online release would have required 10,000 pages to deliver in print-version design. At first, the online release was a static rendition, yet updates and modifications were arranged. 

"USA Today"' alluded to it as a decent foot stool book. "Chicago Tribune" writer Rick Kogan portrays this as a monstrous endeavor with the regular shortcomings of the human component in it determinations and exactness, and commonly of its endeavor to fill in as a recorded assemblage a quickly dated item because of the dynamic idea of the city. Notwithstanding, he feels it is certain to astonish its group of onlookers. A "Chicago Sun-Times" commentator depicts it as an academic item that may be "effectively the most thorough reference book on the Chicago area at any point distributed". "The State Journal-Register", the Springfield, Illinois paper, commentators gripe that downstate urban communities and locales are disregarded in the book.

Ethington that spoke glowingly about the two forms of the reference book portraying it as "one of the best aggregate works (with 633 recorded writers) of North American chronicled grant of our period". They commended it for its expansiveness and intelligibility. The online adaptation was noted for its careful hyperlinking. The online survey was superficial as in it didn't understand the extension of the online form. In any case, the audit noticed that the online rendition gives "amazing and substantive" intuitive assets that are unrealistic in the print version. The audit is particularly conscious of the cartographic commitments, which it portrays in detail. It rejects the sequential structure of the online form as a pointless intricacy. The audit additionally grumbles about true to life oversights that require broad route to related articles. The audit felt a portion of the online shortfalls left open the likelihood that the creation may get eclipsed by future endeavors that influence the electronic conceivable outcomes all the more completely. 

"The Chronicle of Higher Education" checked on the "Reference book" alongside a few of its companions and referenced right off the bat in the audit that the approach of online reference books makes the works a lot simpler to address and refresh. Be that as it may, the accessibility of online reference books decreased the criticalness of the print versions as indicated by the audit since it made gifting them less noteworthy and it diminished deals at libraries. The audit additionally noticed that the online methodology is ending up so fruitful that the territory of Georgia has delivered the online-just "New Georgia Encyclopedia", which began as a 300-article adventure and has bloomed to a 1300-article work. In any case, they noticed that when the "Reference book of Chicago" was first discharged that the neighborhood media upheld the book; some Chicago circle racers read entries from it on air.
