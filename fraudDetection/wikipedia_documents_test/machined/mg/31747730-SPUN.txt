"New York" was met with blended surveys by numerous faultfinders. Erica Futterman of "Moving Stone" stated, "We didn't really anticipate that the New Directions should win nationals, yet the scene just felt like it was making a halfhearted effort as opposed to catching the chance to accomplish something genuinely fantastic." "The A.V. Club" Todd VanDerWerff considered the scene a "decent bit of TV", and gave it a "B+". He said it "wasn't as great" as the main season finale, "Adventure to Regionals", "to a great extent since it squandered a ton of time on exhibitions planned exclusively to flaunt how the show was quite New York and furthermore in light of the fact that it obtained a ton of that scene's set pieces without discovering anything remotely as amazing as the execution of 'Bohemian Rhapsody. Robert Canning of "IGN" gave "New York" a "great" evaluation of 7.5 out of 10 and expressed, "while not as epic as Nationals in New York ought to have been, 'New York' was a nice near a pleasant season." "The Atlantic" Meghan Brown said the scene was "an uneven end to an uneven season, with a couple of executioner numbers, weird goals, and head-scratching plot gadgets", while her partner Kevin Fallon opined that the season finale was "no special case" to "Happiness" having "been unquestionably baffling in season two", however "there was as yet sufficient motivation to tune in and appreciate". 

A few components of the scene were featured for their improbability. The landing of New Directions in New York without having their tunes officially arranged gotten across the board judgment, including from VanDerWerff and the "Houston Chronicle" Bobby Hankinson, and drove Brown to express, "there is positively no universe in which that bodes well. By any means. It was so legitimately unsound that it was diverting." The idea that Rachel would not realize that "Felines" had shut eleven years before was criticized by Brown and Amy Reiter of the "Los Angeles Times", while Rachel and Kurt's experience with "the main agreeable security protect in New York City" was taunted by Anthony Benigno of "The Faster Times" and "Excitement Weekly" Sandra Gonzalez. A few commentators were disillusioned that Quinn's unpropitious notice of designs for New York in "Burial service" came to nothing, including Benigno, who considered her real thought a "cockamamie harm plot", however he acknowledged Agron's scene as an "extraordinary, squandered occupation in an incredible, squandered character", suppositions resounded by VanDerWerff and James Poniewozik of "Time". Terron R. Moore of "Ology.com" gave the scene a "C+", and compared Quinn's dropped plot to Will leaving for Broadway and Rachel abandoning her affection for Finn: "the way that none of this happenedÃ¢ÂÂand the way that we know none of it could ever happenÃ¢ÂÂis simply one more issue I have with the show. I trust that next season, it really grows a pair." 

Finn and Rachel's date in New York was commended, however not every person was content with its consummation. Gonzalez loved LuPone's short visitor spot, and trusted it would be "an exercise to makers in how to manage visitor appearances later on". Canning said the date had a "sweet clever tone", and thought the scene was "the best the arrangement has done as such far with this couple". Reiter felt Rachel was making a "false" decision in her refusal of Finn toward the finish of the date, and pondered "wouldn't she be able to in any event have asked him" on the off chance that he would think about coming to New York. At the challenge execution, Poniewozik said of the finish of "Imagining", "I may not be that put resources into Finn/Rachel, yet the frightening minute where the crowd vanished amidst their kiss made me feel like I was." Benigno called the occasion "amazing", and VanDerWerff was likewise satisfied. 

Those commentators who singled out the show's last portion, set after the arrival to Ohio, did as such with compliments. Poniewozik composed that the scene "completed an actually fine activity dealing with its epilog, in which New Directions had their expectations pounded, returned to LimaÃ¢ÂÂand found that it was a really great encounter in any case. Brittany associated with Santana, a concise scene that reminded me how far the two characters have come this season. Kurt didn't get a title, however he has Blaine, and he has a sample of what life can resemble for him after graduation." Canning said it was a "pleasant conclusion, putting everybody settled for having neglected to achieve the main ten at Nationals and getting their expectations high for one year from now." Hankinson acknowledged Brittany for probably the most clever lines in the scene just as the most imperative sceneÃ¢ÂÂin the epilog with SantanaÃ¢ÂÂand he was awed with her lead vocals all through. He finished up, "She's the M.V.P. of the night and conceivably the season." 

The melodic exhibitions got a blended response from commentators, both all in all and independently. Poniewozik said the tunes "generally had a craving for cushioning, without anything that offered a solid association of appear differently in relation to the story." VanDerWerff called the music his least most loved component of the scene, and was just complimentary about "Bella Notte". Brittany's unique tune, "My Cup", was classified "light and fun" by Benigno. Kubicek portrayed it as "another splendidly preposterous unique melody", and Canning said it was a "silly act". While Brett Berk of "Vanity Fair" expressed that it was "incredibly ghastly", he by and by gave it three stars out of five. 

The blend of "I Love New York" and "New York, New York" was run of the mill of the scope of responses tunes got. Benigno gave it a "C" and pondered whether unfortunately he "thought this was a joke melody before [he] acknowledged it was a blend". Gonzalez gave it a "B" and said it was "not [her] top pick". Futterman considered it an "irresistible, fast concoction" and Hankinson recorded it as one of the four main tunes from the scene, however Kubicek said the on-screen execution "would make any genuine New Yorker need to kick [New Directions] in the shins". 

Most analysts were profoundly condemning of the incorporation of Morrison's "Still Got Tonight", the second single from his performance collection. VanDerWerff called it "too liberal" and Kubicek portrayed it as "improper self advancement". Gonzalez said the melody "isn't half awful" and gave it a "BÃ¢ÂÂ", while Benigno was progressively liberal with a "B+", in spite of his conviction that it didn't have a place in the scene. Futterman called it "a nonexclusive sounding pop tune". The utilization of "Bella Notte", on the other hand, was commonly endorsed of, however Kubicek thought it was "somewhat bizarre that they weren't generally there", and Berk gave both of its two stars out of five exclusively due to the "phantom vocalists". VanDerWerff thought the tune was "well-performed", and Benigno gave it a "B+"; he had an altogether different take from Kubicek, as he found the fanciful appearance by the male club individuals entertaining. 

In spite of the fact that Kurt and Rachel being permitted on the phase of a Broadway theater was esteemed doubtful in the extraordinary by numerous commentators, most were happy to suspend skepticism and make the most of their two part harmony of "For Good". Futterman composed that the execution brought occasions "full hover from their season one dramatization around singing 'Resisting Gravity'. It's a fitting tune for companionship and Kurt and Rachel nail it." "The Wall Street Journal" Raymund Flandez portrayed it as "so glorious that it could have fit so effectively in the cast variant of the melodic's CD". While Benigno wished the melody had begun two-voice amicability sooner, he gave it an "AÃ¢ÂÂ" and called it "mother lovin' stunning". Among the less good remarks, VanDerWerff felt that the tune itself was "really frail". 

Usher's "Better believe it!" by an anonymous all-female a cappella gathering got variation sentiments. Aly Semigran of "MTV" said that the gathering "nailed" the tune, yet Benigno found the track and entertainers irritating and gave it a "DÃ¢ÂÂ". Futterman noticed, "the course of action feels level and the moving is overexaggerated", and Hankinson called this melody and the Vocal Adrenaline offering, "As Long As You're There", "meh". The last tune additionally gathered unique suppositions, from Kubicek's "neither fun nor fascinating" to Gonzalez's honor of an "A+", her best grade of the show. Futterman composed that Sunshine took care of her number with "wonderful expertise and mind boggling ease". 

The two unique tunes sung by New Directions were appraised from superb to appalling. Benigno gave every melody a "B+"; he called the two part harmony, "Imagining", "beautiful". The most pleasant thing Kubicek composed of it was that it seemed as though the verses had been "composed by a lovesick adolescent kid", and he called "Light Up the World" a "trainwreck". Berk was considerably harsher: "When the show has unconditional authority access to each stunning tune ever of music, there's something frightfully mortifying about watching the children sing this poop tune as their finale, and do as such with such urgent conviction." Gonzalez gave "Light Up the World" a "B+", yet said it sounded "a lot" like "Failure Like Me", and keeping in mind that Benigno thought it had a superior tune than "Washout" and furthermore made "much better utilization of the Gleeks in general", he scrutinized the chorale for its likeness to "Let It Rock" by Kevin Rudolf. Semigran said it was an "elevating, if not rather dull pop tune", yet Hankinson called it his most loved number in the scene. 

Three unique tunes and two spread forms that were included in the scene appeared on various melodic outlines. The two unique tunes sung by the primary "Happiness" cast did best, with "Light Up the World" appearing at number thirty-three on the "Announcement" Hot 100, on an issue dated for June 11, 2011.
