Religious recluse nibbled wir lair Heiligen Geist 

"" (We presently beseech the Holy Ghost) is a German Christian psalm. The principal stanza is a leise from the thirteenth century which suggests the Latin succession Veni Sancte Spiritus (Come, Holy Spirit) for Pentecost. It was generally known, and was utilized past its Pentecostal cause, additionally as a parade melody and in sacrosanct plays. 

The most unmistakable type of the present song contains three further stanzas composed by the Protestant reformer Martin Luther. He prescribed the leise in his 1523 sacrament to be utilized consistently in faith gatherings. The solicitation to the Holy Spirit for the correct confidence the vast majority of all ("um nook rechten Glauben allermeist") fit Luther's religious philosophy well. In 1524, conceivably for Pentecost, he composed the extra stanzas. This variant was distributed first in Wittenberg a similar year as a component of Johann Walter's First Wittenberg Hymnal. The tune's topics of confidence, love and expectation render it suitable for Pentecost as well as for general events and memorial services.

His song was reexamined by Maria Luise Thurmair and distributed in 1972, and still piece of the 2013 Catholic hymn book "Gotteslob". 

The medieval leise (a kind of sort of vernacular medieval church melody), which later turned into the principal stanza, is reported in the thirteenth century: ascribed to the Franciscan Berthold von Regensburg (passed on 1272) who cited it in a message: 

The stanza frames a petition in German to the Holy Spirit, reminiscent of the Latin grouping Veni Sancte Spiritus. The worry is "the majority of all" (allermeist) the "right confidence" (rechten glouben), considering to return "home" (heim) after the "oust" (ellende) of life. In the old German, "ellende" implied banish and was worried on the second syllable, rhyming with "ende", though the cutting edge "Elend" is worried on the primary syllable and means "hopelessness". The center is, as in the finish of Veni Sancte Spiritus ("da salutis exitum"), the help of the Holy Spirit at the season of death.

The leise had a long convention. Its points of the correct confidence ("rechter Glaube", "veram fide"), and the possibility of the season of death, more likely than not spoke to Luther. He had referenced "veram fide" in an early lesson about the leise (1509 or 1510), and advanced salvation by confidence alone ("sola fide"). Considerations of the season of death were with him all through life, and he was not the only one.
