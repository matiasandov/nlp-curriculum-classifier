Bigeye sand tiger 

The bigeye sand tiger ("Odontaspis noronhai") is an incredibly uncommon types of mackerel shark in the family Odontaspididae, with a conceivable overall circulation. A huge, massive animal types coming to at any rate long, the bigeye sand tiger has a long bulbous nose, extensive orange eyes without nictitating films, and a vast mouth with the limited teeth unmistakably uncovered. It very well may be recognized from the comparable smalltooth sand tiger ("O. ferox") by its teeth, which have just a single horizontal cusplet on each side, and by its consistently dull darker shading. 

Possessing mainland edges and maritime waters at profundities of , the bigeye sand tiger may make vertical and flat transient developments. It benefits from hard fishes and squid, and its sizable eyes and dull tinge propose that it might invest the majority of its energy in the mesopelagic zone. Proliferation is presumably viviparous with oophagous developing lives like in other mackerel shark species. This shark is gotten by chance by business fisheries, however so rarely that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) can't yet decide its protection status. 

The main realized bigeye sand tiger was a female long gotten off Madeira in April 1941, on a longline set for dark scabbardfish ("Aphanopus carbo"). The example was mounted and later framed the reason for a logical portrayal composed by German ichthyologist GÄÅºnther Maul in a 1955 article for "Notulae Naturae". He named the species "noronhai" to pay tribute to Adolfo CÄÅ¡sar de Noronha, the late Director of the Funchal Museum. Destroy allocated his new species to the sort "Carcharias", which at the time was utilized for all individuals from the sand tiger shark family. At the point when the "Odontaspis" came to be perceived as a legitimate sort separate from "Carcharias", the bigeye sand tiger was reassigned also given its similarity to the smalltooth sand tiger ("O. ferox"). Until more examples were inspected during the 1980s, a few creators estimated that this species spoke to an outrageous variation of the smalltooth sand tiger. Different names for this shark incorporate dark sand tiger, maritime sand tiger, and bigeye battered tooth shark. 

Regardless of whether the bigeye and smalltooth sand tigers have a place in a similar family as the externally comparable sand tiger shark ("C. taurus") has been bantered among systematists, with morphological and dentitional thinks about giving conflicting outcomes. A 2012 atomic phylogenetic investigation, in view of mitochondrial DNA, upheld a sister species connection between "O. noronhai" and "O. ferox" however not a clade comprising of "Odontaspis" and "Carcharias". Rather, "Odontaspis" was observed to be nearer to the crocodile shark ("Pseudocarcharias kamoharai"), proposing that it and "Carcharias" ought to be put in independent families. 

With its pudgy body, cone shaped bulbous nose, and huge mouth loaded up with distending teeth, the bigeye sand tiger looks much like the better-known sand tiger shark. The vast eyes need nictitating layers, and behind them are little spiracles. The edge of the mouth reaches out to behind the dimension of the eyes, and the jaws are exceedingly protrusible. There are 34Ã¢ÂÂ43 upper and 37Ã¢ÂÂ46 lower tooth pushes; these incorporate zero to two columns of little teeth at the upper symphysis (jaw midpoint) and two to four additional lines at the lower symphysis. In every 50% of the upper jaw, the teeth in the first and second columns are expansive, those in the third and now and then fourth lines are little, and those in the lines after are huge once more. Every tooth has a limited, drawbore like focal cusp flanked by one littler cusplet on each side; this stands out from the smalltooth sand tiger, which has a few sidelong cusplets on each side. There are five sets of gill cuts. 

The pectoral balances are medium-sized and expansive with adjusted tips. The vast first dorsal balance has an adjusted summit and is situated nearer to the pectoral than the pelvic blades. The second dorsal balance is about a large portion of the span of the first and begins over the back tips of the pelvic blades. The pelvic balances are nearly as extensive as the principal dorsal blade. The butt-centric balance is littler than the second dorsal blade and situated behind it. The caudal peduncle has a sickle molded score at the dorsal beginning of the caudal blade. The lower flap of the caudal blade is short however unmistakable, while the upper projection is long and has a profound indent in the trailing edge close to the tip. The skin is secured by covering dermal denticles, each with three flat edges prompting minor teeth. This species is plain dull ruddy dark colored to chocolate darker, in some cases with dark trailing edges on the blades or a white-tipped first dorsal balance. The eyes are dull orange with vertically oval, green-tinted understudies. There are a few dark fixes inside the mouth, for example, around the jaws, on the floor of the mouth, and on the gill curves. The biggest male and female examples estimated long individually. 

In spite of the fact that amazingly uncommon, the bigeye sand tiger has been accounted for from dissipated areas around the globe, recommending a wide and potentially disjunct worldwide circulation in tropical and warm-calm maritime waters. Most realized examples have originated from the Atlantic, where it has been found off Madeira, southern Brazil, Texas, eastern Florida, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The main proof for its quality in the Indian Ocean is a lot of jaws that may have started from the Seychelles, however the South China Sea is another probability. The presence of this species in the Pacific Ocean was first suspected in 1970 from teeth recuperated from base residue, which was affirmed over 10 years after the fact by catches from the Marshall Islands and Hawaii. 

The bigeye sand tiger has been gotten between the profundities of . Some were recorded over mainland and isolated racks, both from close to the ocean depths and in mid-water. Others were angled from parts of the vast sea that were profound, where they were swimming in the upper dimensions of the water segment. Evening time catches from generally shallow profundities recommend that this species may make a diel vertical relocation, ascending from the mesopelagic zone to the epipelagic zone during the evening to nourish. In Brazilian waters, bigeye sand tigers are just caught in spring, alluding to some kind of occasional transitory development. 

One record of a bigeye sand tiger that had been gotten alive noticed that it carried on in all respects forcefully, whipping and snapping viciously all through the water. Its expansive eyes and consistently dim shading are trademark attributes of a mesopelagic fish. The bigeye sand tiger benefits from hard fishes and squid. Its generation is little-known however most likely like that of other mackerel sharks, which are viviparous with incipient organisms that feed on unfertilized eggs amid incubation (oophagy). Grown-up females have a solitary practical ovary, on the right, and two utilitarian uteruses. Guys develop explicitly at somewhere close to long, while females develop at around long. No data is accessible on development or maturing. 

Since the bigeye sand tiger is experienced so inconsistently, it has no business significance. It is gotten by chance on longlines and in gillnets and handbag seines, however the scarcity of catches propose that it for the most part lives in waters unreasonably profound for business fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has recorded this species as Data Deficient, refering to an absence of organic and populace information. Since 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has restricted the taking of this species in United States waters.
