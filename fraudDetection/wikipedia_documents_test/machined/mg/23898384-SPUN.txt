The house was built from 1855Ã¢ÂÂ56. After Schneller and his family took inhabitance, the house was assaulted a few times by Arab looters from the town of Beit Sorek, constraining them to withdraw to the security of the Old City. Toward the decade's end, after the Turks had raised stations and dispatched equipped watches on horseback to watch Jaffa Road (the course among Jerusalem and the port city of Jaffa, which lay close to the Schneller compound), Schneller and his family had the capacity to come back to their home. 

In 1860 Lebanese Druze slaughtered a great many Maronite Christians in Lebanon and Syria. Schneller ventured out to Beirut with the expectation of saving fight stranded youngsters. He was repelled by the neighborhood network, which did not confide in outside Protestant ministers, however figured out how to convey back nine stranded young men to Jerusalem in October 1860. He chose to open a halfway house for them in his home, and before the finish of 1861 had selected 41 young men in what ended up known as the Syrian Orphanage (). Throughout the following four years Schneller extended his property to 13.6 sections of land (55 dunam) and raised a - high stone divider around it. Through 1867 Schneller extended and included new framework, making a kitchen, lounge area, stockpiling basement, rooms and living regions. In 1867 the shelter started tolerating young ladies. 

Assets for development and extension, together with attire and covers, were requested from Protestant people group in Germany and Switzerland. Somewhere in the range of 1861 and 1885 Schneller gathered a sum of 550,000 francs in gifts. 

Schneller was resolved to give stranded and surrendered Arab youngsters a total training, including showing them an exchange. Keeping that in mind, he utilized both scholarly and professional instructors, principally from Germany. The last driven proficient workshops in fitting, shoemaking, etching, carpentry, metalworking, ceramics, painting, printing, cultivating, and planting.

Toward the start of the twentieth century, a huge block and tile industrial facility was raised on the premises, which delivered one million blocks and 250,000 tiles every year. 

In 1889 Schneller procured 1,235 sections of land (5,000 dunam) in Bir Salem (today Kibbutz Netzer Sereni) so as to build up a rural school and land for settlement for his understudies and graduates. In 1906 another 890 sections of land (3,600 dunam) was added to the first bundle. Despite the fact that the agrarian school did not emerge, the grain, leafy foods delivered by the ranch enhanced the halfway house diet amid the sustenance deficiencies of World War I. 

In 1889 Schneller gave over the task of the shelter to a consortium situated in Stuttgart, while his oldest child, Theodor (1856Ã¢ÂÂ1935), moved toward becoming administrator of the foundation. In 1927 Theodor's most youthful child, Ernst, assumed control over the administration of the organization until its seizure by the British in 1940. 

Like other European Christian establishments worked in Jerusalem during the 1800s, the Schneller Orphanage was arranged on high ground and was encompassed by a high stone divider, with an iron door that was bolted during the evening. The property radiated the power and impact of European Christians in Jerusalem with its multistory structures, a clock tower, and beautifying faÄÂ§ade, incorporating reliefs in stone and sayings.

Following the visit of Kaiser Wilhelm to Jerusalem in 1898, the halfway house got three ringers for its pinnacle. 

The engineering style of the primary structure is a mix of Southern German and nearby Arabic. The tile rooftop and onion-vault tower mounted on a square base mirrors the previous, while wide, adjusted curves for entryways and windows mirror the last mentioned. A lightning pole reaches out from the onion arch. The H-formed fundamental structure has two inside yards which held a water reservoir, greenery enclosure and play region. The whole structure covers a zone of 50,590 square feet (4,700 square meters). At three stories, the fundamental structure housed the focal lounge area, a kitchen, an examination corridor, a library, a perusing room, a little historical center, and a Lutheran church in which understudies and staff loved. 

Johann Ludwig Schneller acquired talented Arab workers from Bethlehem and Beit Jala to develop an aggregate of eight structures, which were built in stages and finished in the mid twentieth century. The time of fruition and the name of the German city in which the benefactors for that building lived were engraved on each structure faÄÂ§ade. One of the structures, called Ã¢ÂÂthe Red HouseÃ¢ÂÂ or Ã¢ÂÂthe display house,Ã¢ÂÂ was fabricated completely from materials created on the halfway house grounds, including blocks, floor tiles and fashioned iron work. 

For a large portion of its reality, the halfway house was in a constant condition of development and modernization. Ruth Kark et al. notes: 

... the locksmith-shop was renovated and changed area inside the mind boggling multiple times between the time of 1861 and 1930 (1861, 1867, 1900, 1908, 1930). The bread kitchen changed spot and was modernized multiple times andÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ in a comparative wayÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ the majority of the capacities and employments of the rooms changed amid the seventy years of the institutionÃ¢ÂÂs presence.

Two of these "Batei Schneller" (Schneller Houses) still remain over the road from the principle entrance, just as three of the first five homes manufactured a few yards toward the west (close to the present corner of Malkhei Yisrael and Sarei Yisrael Streets). A plaque on each home bears the name of the German city of its benefactors. The urban areas are: Halle, Stuttgart, Kletz, Munich, Hamburg, Petersberg, and Erpfingen, Schneller's origination. 

By 1903 the instructive office had developed to eight structures and incorporated the halfway house, the school for the visually impaired, and professional workshops for youth. 

In 1910, the celebration year of the shelter's establishing, a flame wrecked the third floor and wooden top of the primary structure, and harmed the second floor where the congregation was housed. Ludwig Schneller, a child of the organizer who was the manager at the time, figured out how to gather more than 200,000 stamps in gifts from Germany and remade the whole structure. The upper story of the structure was reconstructed in stone. 

Building and development proceeded up to World War I, by which time the shelter involved 150 sections of land (600 dunam) of land. The Schneller grounds achieved right to introduce day Romema, where Schneller planted woods ashore that in the end housed the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo. The halfway house's property were slowly decreased to 17.5 sections of land with the clearance of land to the new neighborhoods of Mekor Baruch and Kerem Avraham. 

Amid World War I, the compound was utilized by the Turkish armed force and its partners as a sleeping shelter. From 1921 to 1927, Theodor Schneller continued administration of the halfway house, administering the modernization of the property with electrical and sewage establishments, just as new apparatus for the different workshops.

On 12 March 1947, the Irgun entered the camp itself in a pre-sunrise activity and exploded explosives in one of the structures to challenge the inconvenience of military law on Jerusalem. One British fighter was killed and eight harmed in the impacts; military law was lifted four days after the fact. 

On 17 March 1948, the British deserted the camp and the Etzioni Brigade of the Haganah utilized it as a command post amid the 1948 Israeli War of Independence. For the following 60 years, the compound filled in as a preparation base for the Israel Defense Forces and a military facility; at a certain point, it likewise filled in as base camp for the Home Front Command. 

In 1951 the Israeli armed force called agents of the World Lutheran Church to expel religious curios from the halfway house church; church delegates expelled chimes, windows and a pipe organ, however left the substantial marble special raised area encased in a wooden chest. The congregation was then changed over into a ball field for the warriors. In October 2009, on a voyage through the office after the military had abandoned the grounds, the executive of the Evangelical German Lutheran Church of the Redeemer saw the chest and requested it to be opened, uncovering the special stepped area. The Lutherans consulted for it to be moved to the Lutheran church at Augusta Victoria Hospital, where it was introduced in November 2010. 

Amid the 60 years of inhabitance by the Israeli armed force, the base was served by a military synagogue in one of the corridors of the primary structure, including a Torah ark, cabinet, and a gallery entryway set with 12 recolored glass windows delineating the Twelve Tribes of Israel. 

In 2008 the military base migrated to the Ofrit base close Mount Scopus. The Jerusalem district set up together a "conservation and development plan" for the Schneller compound, requiring the eight noteworthy structures to be created for open use by the Orthodox Jewish people group adjacent. In November 2010, some portion of the Schneller grounds were assigned as an open parking area by the region to facilitate the stopping issues in the neighboring Geula business locale. One hundred parking spots were made accessible for as long as three hours. 

In 2011 the Israel Land Administration affirmed plans for the improvement of 218 extravagance lofts on the property while saving the eight memorable halfway house structures. 

Starting at 2012, portions of the complex are being utilized for a Bais Yaakov young ladies' school, a Gerrer Talmud Torah, a preparation territory for urban battle police, and civil waste stockpiling.
