"Judge, Jury, Executioner" was coordinated by Greg Nicotero and composed by Angela Kang. The scene turned into Nicotero's first coordinating credit for a full-length TV scene of the arrangement; he had recently imagined and coordinated the six-section web arrangement "". As a major aspect of a special crusade, cast part Norman Reedus took an interest in a live visit on "Amusement Weekly" agreeing with the airing of "Judge, Jury, Executioner". 

This scene tends to the passing of Dale Horvath, who is assaulted and tore open by a walker. Jeffrey DeMunn was "angry" about the terminating of long-term companion Frank Darabont, who created and recently went about as showrunner for the arrangement, and requested to be given up from the show. In a 2018 meeting with "The Plain Dealer", DeMunn stated, "I went through seven days not having the capacity to take a full breath. And after that I understood, 'Gracious, I can stop.' So I called them and stated, 'It's a zombie appear. Slaughter me. I would prefer not to do this any longer.' It was a massive help to me." Since author Robert Kirkman felt that Dale embodied a character of ethical quality and mankind, a lot of "Judge, Jury, Executioner" investigates topics identified with the declining profound quality of people amid a calamitous occasion. Kirkman broadcasted that Dale's demise was an earth shattering event, at last denoting a defining moment for future improvement of "The Walking Dead". "Dale's character has been the essence of the show," he iterated. "He's unquestionably the ethical compass. HeÃ¢ÂÂs the person that, more so than anybody, has been cautioning individuals to be cautious how you let this world change you and checking what lengths individuals will endure. His misfortune is going to mean a lot for every one of the characters in the show and is certainly going to speak to a swing to a darker space. His passing methods a ton." Kirkman added that it was hard to discharge DeMunn from the cast. He expressed: "ItÃ¢ÂÂs unfortunate to lose Jeffrey DeMunn. He's truly given us a ton, these keep going two seasons on the show. It's been astounding to work with him and become more acquainted with him and heÃ¢ÂÂs a great man and weÃ¢ÂÂre certainly going to miss him." 

Rather than his job in the TV arrangement, Dale's comic book partner is among the longest enduring characters in the arrangement, and he goes into a sexual association with Andrea. Kirkman affirmed that it was important for scholars to separate the advancement of Dale's TV character from that in the comic: "I have talked ordinarily the amount I like the contrast between the funnies and the show. There will be huge plot lines that we may not really get the opportunity to, similar to the sentiment among Dale and Andrea. On the off chance that you think you truly need to peruse that story line, that is accessible in the funnies, and I exceedingly suggest you lift those up. The show is continually going to be an alternate creature and the choice to execute Dale off was a major one and it wasn't one that was made daintily." 

As an obviously troubled Rick falters to shoot Dale, Daryl takes the weapon and definitely shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of "The Hollywood Reporter" recommended that makers were unobtrusively developing before the occasion. Kirkman felt this denoted Daryl's place in the gathering and was conclusion for the perished Sophia Peletier, whose passing caused Daryl to pull far from connecting with the gathering. Kirkman iterated that such activities were the confirmations of his "putting everything at stake and opening himself up in a manner he had never done in light of the fact that his adolescence was so failed."; "So when he discovered she was dead and in the animal dwellingplace constantly, that is the reason he withdrawn and isolated himself from the gathering. It was on the grounds that he enabled himself to mind and it just exploded backward on him in a major manner. He would not like to be a piece of the gathering and have those feelings and care about these individuals. So he's been separating himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these individuals need him and that he can fill a job and in being that unforgiving removed person, you can do the things that nobody else needs to do. He needs to venture in and remove that load from Rick for a minute. Rick is the person who ventured up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and on account of his agony over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. In any case, when he sees Rick falter to do something very similar with Dale he knows: this is my minute, this is the place I can demonstrate my value, and he ventures in and does what he needs to do." 

In "Judge, Jury, Executioner", Carl develops into a desensitized character and eventually surrenders his naÄÅ¼vetÄÅ¡ to his general surroundings. In spite of the fact that "Diversion Weekly" essayist Clark Collis attracted parallels to a sequential executioner, Kirkman proposed this was an activity to give more screen time to the character. He affirmed that Carl was "a standout amongst the best time characters to recount anecdotes about in this world." He proceeded: "It's valid for the comic and it's valid for the show. After some time, weÃ¢ÂÂre going to begin to see increasingly more of this child. What's marvelous about that is, think about what it resembles to experience childhood in this world. It's one thing to have all that you know detracted from you and need to manage this sÃ¢ÂÂy world you currently need to live in. Yet, to have scarcely even truly perceived what the world is and how it functions and what's in store and after that to be pushed into this prophetically catastrophic danger and to grow up and develop with these sorts of circumstances. It will influence him to grow up bizarre, is the thing that I like to state." 

"Judge, Jury, Executioner" was initially communicated on March 4, 2012 in the United States on AMC. After airing, the scene gathered 6.771 million watchers and a 3.5 rating in the 18-49 statistic, as indicated by Nielsen evaluations. This shows 3.5% of individuals from the statistic saw the scene.

"Judge, Jury, Executioner" was commended by TV pundits. Imprint A. Perigard of the "Boston Herald" considered it an "extraordinary scene"; ""Walking Dead" again demonstrates it is a standout amongst the best dramatizations on TV and nearly makes me like paying my link charge." Writing for the "San Antonio Express-News", Rene Guzman opined that it "conveys all that muddled show in spades with a genuine terrible end to one of the seriesÃ¢ÂÂ center characters". Wetpaint's Molly Friedman expressed that in "Judge, Jury, Executioner", the group of onlookers "at long last had motivation to shed a few tears and recollect exactly the amount we care about the first pack of prophetically catastrophic nonconformists". Kevin Yeoman of "The Christian Science Monitor" and E! Online writer Tierney Bricker presumed that the scene figured out how to viably amaze the crowd, while Cyriaque Lamar of io9 pronounced that "Judge, Jury, Executioner" was mediocre compared to its forerunner by composing that it "presented a bundle of semi engaging scenes of individuals contending and topped them off with a standout amongst the most incidentally clever closers at any point focused on satellite TV". In his B+ survey, Zack Handlen of "The A.V. Club" said that the scene proceeded with the arrangement's way of a progressively engaged and focal bearing. Josh Jackson of "Glue" was charmed with the arrangement's investigation of ethical quality amid a prophetically catastrophic occasion in "Judge, Jury, Executioner".

Dale's passing was applauded by observers, who avowed that it was a frightful and passionate scene. Scott Meslow of "The Atlantic" proposed that in light of his passing, "The Walking Dead" grasped an increasingly dim and vile theory. He declared, "Taken extensively, his passing imprints the demise of a specific profound quality on the show, and the grasp of a reasoning that is something crueler and darker. Dale, in contrast to any of different survivors, kept up his humankind to the very end of his waking lifeÃ¢ÂÂbut even he couldn't decide not to return as something irreverent and barbaric. In a world that appears to be completely unequipped for showing signs of improvement, it's a none-too-consoling sign that things will very likely deteriorate." Gina McIntyre of "Los Angeles Times" resounded synonymous considerations: "It's left to Daryl to shoot the man to end his misery, which is significantly excessively terrible. Without Dale to raise each one of those annoying worries about making the wisest decision, zombie end times or no zombie end times, I dread for the fate of this walker-invaded world." Handlen and "Calgary Herald" Kimberly Potts believed that it was among the stunning minutes in the arrangement, while Friedman communicated that she was "bolted by the wonderful assault [...] and loaded up with pity, as the first group viewed their companion die in some horrible, nightmarish way". Handlen commented: "ItÃ¢ÂÂs a stunning scene, somewhat for its straight-forward blood, and in part for the shocked, uncomprehending appearance on DaleÃ¢ÂÂs face. [...] This, directly here, is the sort of arrangement the show needs. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs too little feeling of risk at this moment." Verne Gay of "Newsday" depicted the succession as "rough", and eventually summated that DeMunn's nonattendance will be felt as the show advances. Nonetheless, Lamar affirmed that the journalists ought to have discounted Dale in a progressively good manner; "That wasn't the best approach to off the show's most annoyingly normal character. Dale's saving grace was his capacity to blame everyone for paying lip administration to govern of law; his shortcoming was his naÄÅ¼vetÄÅ¡. Having a getting away Randall murder him would've offered some lovely symmetry. I'm not going to miss this character, however he merited a superior send-off." "Time" writer Nate Rawlings drew implications from Dale's assault to the scene title, remarking that "when the solitary zombie we find in this scene tears open DaleÃ¢ÂÂs stomach, spilling the substance of his body onto the virus ground, weÃ¢ÂÂre reminded that the walkers are the judges, theyÃ¢ÂÂre the jury, and this specific one was a most severe killer." Although he was stunned by the succession, Goldman pounced upon the before advancement of Dale in the scene, opining that he was unpalatable. 

Handlen felt that the character advancement of Carl Grimes was more steady than comparable improvements in the scene; "Utilizing Carl to both purpose the episodeÃ¢ÂÂs plot, and making him semi-in charge of DaleÃ¢ÂÂs passing, has a wonderful tidiness, and fills in as an update that for all their discussion, Rick and the gathering have no clue what sway their decisions will make." Likewise, Jackson and Ryan Rigley of MTV saw the darker change of the character; "Carl's ethical compass has extraordinarily moved since being shot and seeing the strolling cadaver of his companion, Sophia," attested Rigley. Jackson inferred that it was one of the scene features, stating, "He stirred from his unconsciousness discussing the excellent doe, yet as far back as the dead collection of Sophia limped out of that horse shelter entryway, he's turned out to be colder and harder. At the point when Carol sees him at SophiaÃ¢ÂÂs gravesite, she attempts to comfort him with discuss paradise, and he calls her a numbskull. He's hoping to copy the men driving the groupÃ¢ÂÂthe various types of sturdiness shown by his dad, Shane and Daryl. Also, he finds the opportunity to test his very own valiance, playing close to a zombie stuck in the mud by the rivulet, remaining quiet about the revelation." Jackson remarked on Carl's response to the demise of Dale, saying that in spite of a slow change to a dim nature, he "understands [...] that he's still especially a child".
