Following the arrival of Furtado's second collection, "Fables" (2003) through DreamWorks Records, it was reported that Universal Music Group would get DreamWorks Records, the last was collapsed into the Interscope Geffen A&M umbrella where Furtado would discharge any new music. Recording sessions for the collection occurred from 2005 to 2006. Timbaland and his protÄÅ¡gÄÅ¡ Danja delivered the majority of the collection, which fuses impacts of move, R&B and hip bounce. The collection investigates the subject of female sexuality and has been portrayed as reflective or even tragic in parts. 

The collection got analysis due to the sexual picture Furtado received for the chronicle, as certain commentators felt it was a ploy to sell more records. Further debate ascended over allegations of copyright infringement on Timbaland's part in the tune "Do It" (which contained the tune from Finnish artist Janne Suni's tune "Acidjazzed Evening" without legitimate approval) when chronicles were spilled onto YouTube. The record was seen for the most part as basically and economically fruitful.

The collection has now sold more than 18 million duplicates around the world. 

The collection was vigorously advanced, discharged in a few versions and upheld by the Get Loose Tour, which is the subject of the show DVD "". "Free" appeared at number one, making it Furtado's first collection to top the diagram alongside eight singles were discharged from the collection, including the US number-one singles "Wanton" and "State It Right", which got Grammy Award selections for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, individually. Other effective singles incorporate the UK number-one single "Maneater" and the European number one single "Every Good Thing (Come to an End)". 

Furtado's second collection, "Legends", was discharged in November 2003. The lead single is "Frail (Say What You Want)" and the second single is the ditty "Attempt". The collection was not as effective as her introduction, halfway because of the collection's less "poppy" sound. "Feeble (Say What You Want)" was later remixed, highlighting Colombian rocker Juanes, who had recently worked with Furtado on his track "FotografÄÂ­a" ("Photograph"). The two would work together again on "Te BusquÄÅ¡" ("I hunt down you"), the single from Furtado's collection "Free". 

The collection was underpromoted from her mark DreamWorks Records; it was declared on 11 November 2003 that Universal Music Group achieved a consent to secure DreamWorks Records from DreamWorks SKG for "about $100 million". The buy came when the music business was "experiencing significant changes" as it attempted to "counter falling deals and the effect of informal online music deals". DreamWorks Records was collapsed into the Interscope Geffen A&M umbrella mark in January 2004. Furtado's chronicle contract was then retained into Interscope Records. 

Furtado needed to make a popular music record "to demonstrate to myself that I could be increasingly streamlined", and refered to as a noteworthy impact Madonna's collection "Beam of Light", saying that "she was smooth however attractive, all inclusive, epic, notorious!" Interscope administrator Jimmy Iovine proposed for Furtado to work with Timbaland, who had created Missy Elliott's "Get Ur Freak On", which highlighted Furtado in a remix, and completed a remix of Furtado's hit "Turn Off the Light". 

Furtado started chip away at "Free" by holding with emcee Jellystone what she alluded to as a "hip-jump workshop", in which they would "compose rhymes, analyze them, and attempt distinctive streams over beats." The principal makers she worked with were Track and FieldÃ¢ÂÂwho co-created her initial two collections, "Hold up, Nelly!" (2000) and "Legends" (2003)Ã¢ÂÂand by May 2005, she had teamed up with Swollen Members and K'naan. She worked with Nellee Hooper in London on reggae-situated material and with Lester Mendez in Los Angeles on acoustic tunes. One of the tracks Mendez made is "Te BusquÄÅ¡", which is co-composed by and highlights Juanes, who teamed up with Furtado on his 2002 tune "FotografÄÂ­a". 

Amid her time in Los Angeles, she worked with Rick Nowels, who co-composed and created "In God's Hands" and "Someone to Love". 

In Miami, Florida, Furtado worked together with Pharrell (who acquainted her with reggaeton and who gave her a "yell out" in his 2005 single "Would i be able to Have It Like That") and Scott Storch (with whom she recorded a "straight-up rap melody") before entering the studio with Timbaland. He and his protÄÅ¡gÄÅ¡ at the time, Danja, co-created eight of the tracks, with another delivered exclusively by Danja. For a portion of the beats on the melodies, Timbaland completed work on ones effectively present in the studio that were half-created or just "cores"; the rest were totally revised. Furtado recorded around forty tracks for "Free", choosing which she would incorporate dependent on the sonics of the albumÃ¢ÂÂshe called Timbaland "a sonic extraterrestrial" who thought of an arrangement of melodies that streamed, and said that the one she had concocted was evidently unacceptable. She recorded an unreleased joint effort with Justin Timberlake, "Group Control", which she depicted as "sort of hot" and "a charming, clubby, cheery, fun track". Different melodies considered for incorporation on the collection incorporate "Chill Boy", "Companion of Mine", "Go", "Turns in the Air", "Pretty Boy", "Bad habit" and "Feeble". 

Furtado said in her journal on her official site that she recorded a remix of "Maneater" with rapper Lil Wayne; it was just discharged as a component of an aggregation collection, Timbaland's Remix and Soundtrack Collection, she likewise utilized the instrumental of the melody amid numerous TV exhibitions of "Maneater". An adaptation of "Every single Good Thing (Come to an End)" including vocals by Coldplay lead artist Chris Martin, who co-composed the tune, was not discharged after a solicitation from Martin's mark, EMI. The melody was discharged on the collection, yet just Furtado's vocals are included. Furtado clarified that ""Loose" was 90 percent composed with a beat first, and afterward IÃ¢ÂÂd compose my tunes and tunes to the beat." 

The "without any preparation" end to generation was one reason the collection was titled "Free". It was named somewhat after the unconstrained choices she made while making the collection. 

The collection is likewise called "Free" since it is "the inverse of determined" and fell into place without any issues for Furtado and Timbaland; she called him her "far off melodic cousin since he was continually pushing limits and continually cutting out his very own way", which she trusted she was doing with "Free". "I think you need to continue astonishing individuals as a craftsman, and I like thatÃ¢ÂÂI love doing that", she said. 

"Free" was additionally named somewhat for the R&B young lady bunch TLC, who Furtado said she appreciates for "reclaiming their sexuality, demonstrating they were finished ladies." She said she needed the collection to be "decisive and cool" and "provocative yet fun", like TLC, MC Lyte, Queen Latifah and Janet Jackson, who enlivened Furtado in light of the fact that, as she put it, she was "agreeable in her sexuality and womanhood" when her 1993 single "That is the Way Love Goes" was discharged. 

Amid the chronicle of "Free", Furtado tuned in to a few electro and shake performers, including Bloc Party, System of a Down, M.I.A., Feist, Queens of the Stone Age, Metric and Death from Above 1979, some of whom impacted the "stone sound" present on the collection and the "hacking, chuckling, misshaped basslines" that were kept in the tunes intentionally. 

As indicated by her, music by such groups is "boisterous and has a carport subject" to it, some of which she believed she caught on the collection. Furtado has said shake music is "cadenced once more" and hip jump affected after it had moved toward becoming "so beating and exhausting." 

Since the blending engineers knew about Timbaland and Furtado's shake impacts, the tunes were blended on a blending board in the studio rather than "the extravagant blender toward the end". Furtado said she favored the more intense volume that procedure provided for the collection since she needed it to seem like her demo tapes, which she wants to her completed collections. She stated, "It didn't have that last wash over it; it didn't have the last squeezing toward the end, put something aside for a few sounds". 

Furtado said that with the arrival of her collections before "Free", she had needed to substantiate herself as an artist and gain regard from audience members through utilizing a wide range of instruments on a collection, which most hip jump artists did not do. After she trusted she had achieved that, she believed she had opportunity to make the kind of music she "truly love[d]". Furtado said her past issue with hip bounce was that she didn't think it was adequate to put together one of her collections with respect to, however that she at that point wondered why she was being "self important". 

The collection speaks to her isolating from such thoughts and, in her words, "hopping in the profound end of the poolÃ¢ÂÂ'Ahh, screw it, this is fun!'". 

Furtado said she sees herself as "everywhere" and unbridled musically in light of the fact that she isn't reliable to one style. 

Out of the blue, Furtado worked with an assortment of record makers and pursued an increasingly community approach in making the collection. 

Delivered fundamentally by Timbaland and Danja, "Free" grandstands Furtado exploring different avenues regarding a more R&BÃ¢ÂÂhip jump sound and, as she put it, the "dreamlike, showy components of '80s music". 

She has arranged the collection's sound as "punk-jump", which she portrays as Eurythmics-impacted "present day, poppy, creepy music" and expressed that "there's a baffling, after-12 pm vibe to [it] that is incredibly instinctive". 

Furtado has portrayed the collection as "increasingly urban, progressively American, increasingly hip-bounce, [and] increasingly rearranged" than her prior work, which she said was increasingly layered and finished on the grounds that she "tend[s] to overthink things". Conversely, amid her studio time with Timbaland, she said she was "in the VIP young men club of simply giving up" and being progressively imprudent. 

As per Furtado, rather than "perfect stuff", the collection highlights "extremely crude" components, for example, contorted bass lines, chuckling from studio outtakes and general "space for blunder". Furtado has said "Free" isn't as much about the verses, which are excluded in the liner notes, all things considered about "enjoying pleasuresÃ¢ÂÂwhether it's moving or lovemaking." According to her, she wasn't attempting to be attractive with the albumÃ¢ÂÂ"I think I simply am hot now", she said. 

The opening track, "Apprehensive" (including rapper Attitude), is a portrayal of Furtado's dread of what individuals think about her, and she has said the chorale helps her to remember "strolling a few doors down in secondary school ... since you live from the outside in. Presently that I'm a grown-up, I care about within me ... Before I said I couldn't have cared less about what individuals thought about me, yet I truly did." 

"Maneater" is an uptempo electro shake tune that consolidates 1980s electro synths and a more move situated beat. The up-beat melody has unmistakable electropop and synthpop impacts and is expressively identified with how individuals become "hot on themselves" when moving in their clothing before a mirror. 

"Unbridled" (including Timbaland) was propelled by a being a tease trade Furtado had with Attitude, who co-composed the tune. 

She has described the fifth track, "Showtime", as "an appropriate R&B moderate jam". 

"No Hay Igual" is a hip bounce and reggaeton melody, that has a Spanglish tongue twister over "future-tropic" beats. The melody contains a "sharp blend" of percussion and "engaged reciting". In "No Hay Igual", Furtado sings in Spanish and raps in Portuguese over a reggaeton beat. 

The collection additionally includes progressively reflective melodies, and "The Sunday Times" composed that it "has an astounding bitterness to it." The seventh track, "Te BusquÄÅ¡", which highlights Latin vocalist Juanes, is about Furtado's encounters with dejection, which she said she has had intermittently since she was around seventeen years of age. 

Furtado said she was uncertain what "State It Right" is about, however that it epitomizes her inclination when she composed it and "takes advantage of this other circle"; in a meeting for "The Sunday Times", it was referenced that it is about her separation with DJ Jasper Gahunia, the dad of her little girl. "In God's Hands", another melody on the collection, was likewise roused before the finish of their relationship.

Extensive consideration was produced by the more sexual picture of Furtado introduced in advancement and attention for the collection, and specifically the music recordings for "Unbridled" and "Maneater", in which she moves around with her midsection uncovered.

It will require a lot of confidence and, obviously, cash." On 9 February 2007, Timbaland remarked on the issue in a MTV talk with: "It makes me chuckle. The part I don't comprehend, the man is endeavoring to act like I went to his home and took it from his PC. I 

don't have any acquaintance with him from a container of paint. I'm 15 years profound. That is the means by which you 

assault a lord? You assault moi? Please, man. You got the chance to come right. You 

the fool. Individuals resemble, 'You must be joking.'"
