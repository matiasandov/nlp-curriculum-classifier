U.S. Highway 40 Alternate (HagerstownÃ¢ÂÂFrederick, Maryland) 

U.S.ÃÂ RouteÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate (USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate) is a backup course of action of USÃÂ 40 in the U.S. province of Maryland. The interstate keeps running from Potomac Street in Hagerstown east to USÃÂ 40 in Frederick. USÃÂ 40 Alternate parallels USÃÂ 40 and a lot of InterstateÃ¢Â 70 (I-70) toward the south through eastern Washington County and western Frederick County. The backup course of action associates Hagerstown and Frederick with Funkstown, Boonsboro, Middletown, and Braddock Heights. USÃÂ 40 Alternate crosses two noteworthy northÃ¢ÂÂsouth segments of the Blue Ridge Mountains that different the Great Appalachian Valley and the Piedmont: South Mountain among Boonsboro and Middletown and Catoctin Mountain, which is privately known as Braddock Mountain, at Braddock Heights. 

USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate is the old arrangement of USÃÂ 40. The expressway's way was blasted in the mid-eighteenth century to associate the Hagerstown Valley and Shenandoah Valley with eastern Pennsylvania and focal Maryland. In the mid nineteenth century, USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate's way was improved as a major aspect of a progression of expressways to associate Baltimore with the eastern end of the National Road in Cumberland. The thruway was improved as one of the first state streets in the mid 1910s and assigned USÃÂ 40 in the late 1920s. Development on a migrated USÃÂ 40 among Hagerstown and Frederick with improved intersections of South Mountain and Braddock Mountain started in the mid-1930s; the new thruway was finished in the late 1940s. USÃÂ 40 Alternate was allocated to the old course of USÃÂ 40 in the mid 1950s. 

US 40 Alternate is a piece of the National Highway System as a key blood vessel from Edgewood Drive in Funkstown to its underpass of I-70 south of Funkstown and from Old Hagerstown Road close Middletown to US 40 in Frederick. 

USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate starts as Baltimore Street at its crossing point with single direction southbound Potomac Street inside the Hagerstown Historic District on the southern edge of downtown Hagerstown. Baltimore Street, which proceeds with west as a city road toward the Hagerstown City Park, runs eastÃ¢ÂÂwest two squares south of USÃÂ 40, which includes a single direction pair of Washington Street eastward and Franklin Street westward. In the wake of traveling east for two squares, amid which USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate converges single direction northbound Locust Street, the municipally-kept up backup course of action turns southeast onto Frederick Street at a five-way intersection that likewise incorporates northÃ¢ÂÂsouth Mulberry Street. USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate converges Memorial Boulevard, which travels east past Municipal Stadium, home of the small time baseball Hagerstown Suns. The interstate meets a CSX rail goad at evaluation while going through a modern zone that stretches out toward the southern city points of confinement of Hagerstown at Kenly Avenue. 

USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate proceeds with southeast as a state-kept up thruway that passes the noteworthy home Garden Hill and crosses Antietam Creek into Funkstown, where the roadway's name changes to Westside Avenue. Inside the Funkstown Historic District, the backup way to go turns east onto Baltimore Street, at that point southeast onto Frederick Street. At the southern town points of confinement of Funkstown, USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate moves toward becoming Boonsboro Pike, which goes through farmland as it parallels Antietam Creek. The expressway goes under I-70 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway) with no entrance and meets Poffenberger Road, which drives west to the notable home Valentia. The parkway veers far from Antietam Creek simply past the notable Cool Hollow House. It at that point goes through the villa of Benevola and crosses Landis Spring Branch and Beaver Creek on its approach to Boonsboro. 

USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate enters the town of Boonsboro and its name changes to Main Street at its convergence with MarylandÃÂ RouteÃÂ 68 (MDÃÂ 68) (Lappans Road). The roadway meets the south end of MDÃÂ 66 (Maple Avenue) by the Bowman House and the east end of MDÃÂ 34 (Potomac Street) in the focal point of town. USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate leaves the town of Boonsboro after its convergence with MDÃÂ 67 (Rohrersville Road). The backup way to go proceeds with southeast as Boonsboro Pike and climbs South Mountain. At the summit, known as Turner's Gap, USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate crosses Washington Monument Road, which drives north to Washington Monument State Park, and passes the Dahlgren Chapel and the Old South Mountain Inn. 

USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate's name changes to Old National Pike as it converges the Appalachian Trail at the WashingtonÃ¢ÂÂFrederick area line and starts its voluptuous plummet of South Mountain into the Middletown Valley. In the western piece of the valley, the interstate passes the Henry Shoemaker Farmhouse and meets Mount Tabor Road, which parallels South Mountain north past the noteworthy Daniel Sheffer Farm and Routzahn-Miller Farmstead. In Spoolsville, USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate crosses Catoctin Creek and meets Old Hagerstown Road, which passes the Bowlus Mill House. The backup way to go's name winds up Main Street as it travels east through Middletown. USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate passes the Stonebraker and Harbaugh-Shafer Building and meets MDÃÂ 17 (Church Street) inside the Middletown Historic District. The interstate goes through the Airview Historic District before leaving as far as possible. 

East of Middletown, USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate goes through a rural zone at that point starts to climb Braddock Mountain. The parkway picks up an ascending path eastward to the highest point of the mountain, which contains the network of Braddock Heights. On the plummet of Braddock Mountain, USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate extends to a four-path street, with one path eastward, two paths westward, and a middle turn path. At the base of the mountain, the backup course of action incidentally extends to a four-path separated expressway through its half-precious stone trade with I-70, which has inclines to and from the heading of Frederick. East of I-70, USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate lessens to two paths and passes the Highland Lodge. The backup way to go achieves its eastern end at a fractional crossing point with USÃÂ 40 (Patrick Street) at the western edge of Frederick and the Frederick Golden Mile, a vigorously marketed territory east to USÃÂ 15 (Frederick Freeway). There is no immediate access from eastward USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate to westward USÃÂ 40 or from eastward USÃÂ 40 toward the westward backup course of action; those developments are made by utilizing Old Camp Road. 

The bit of USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate among Frederick and Boonsboro generally pursues the Monocacy Road, a pack-horse trail bursted by pilgrims from Pennsylvania around 1730. The trail associated Philadelphia, Lancaster, and Hanover with Winchester, Virginia by method for what is presently Taneytown, Frederick, Boonsboro, and Williamsport. The bit of the Monocacy Road from Frederick to Williamsport was utilized by the Braddock Expedition on its way from Alexandria to Cumberland to start its doomed attack on Fort Duquesne. Following the establishing of Hagerstown in 1762, a street was spread out north from Boonsboro to associate the new town with the eastern piece of the province. While the Monocacy Road all in all was neglected by 1794, the segment pursued by USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate remained a critical association among Baltimore and Western Maryland. 

The Baltimore and Fredericktown Turnpike Company was contracted in 1805 to manufacture a street along the way from Baltimore to Boonsboro. This freeway was the initial phase in associating Baltimore with Cumberland, the eastern end of the just-initiated National Road. By 1808, the expressway had been finished west from Baltimore and another was under development. The Baltimore and Fredericktown Turnpike was finished in 1812. That equivalent year, sharp for an improved street to completely stretch out among Baltimore and Cumberland, the Maryland General Assembly recruited the state's banks to subsidize expressway organizations to finish the hole among Boonsboro and Cumberland with the advantage of having their sanctions reached out from 1816 to 1835. The banks restricted this measure yet reluctantly bankrolled the development of a street from Conocheague Creek to Cumberland somewhere in the range of 1816 and 1818 and from Hagerstown to Conococheague Creek in 1818 and 1819. The Maryland General Assembly utilized their forces again in 1821, consenting to stretch out the banks' sanctions to 1845 on the off chance that they would support a freeway in the hole among Boonsboro and Hagerstown. At the point when the National Turnpike was finished in 1823, it turned into the principal macadam street built in the United States. The Baltimore and Fredericktown and National expressways stayed in task through 1909. 

In 1909, the incipient Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSRC) assigned the street among Frederick and Hagerstown for development as one of the first state streets. The commission's first errand was to secure the important option to proceed by obtaining the two expressways in 1911. MDSRC remade the street among Frederick and Hagerstown with a wide macadam surface from Frederick to Middletown and from South Mountain to Boonsboro in 1913. The state street was worked from Middletown to South Mountain and from Boonsboro to Hagerstown in 1914. The part of the expressway inside Boonsboro was cleared in 1915. The last bit of the FrederickÃ¢ÂÂHagerstown state street to be built was inside Funkstown, where the parkway was surfaced with cement by 1919. The roadway was assigned piece of USÃÂ 40 in 1927. 

Around 1926, USÃÂ 40 got its first improvement when solid shoulders were added to grow the roadway from to in width. By 1934, MDSRC prescribed extending the thruway to from west of Frederick to east of Hagerstown. Eventually, the commission chose to develop another parkway between the two urban areas that would abbreviate the separation by and sidestep the sharp bends and constrained sight separations of the old street. Evaluating and seepage take a shot at the new expressway started in 1936 and was finished in 1938 for the main roadway of what might eventually turn into an isolated parkway. The primary wide solid roadway was built from downtown Hagerstown southeast to close Beaver Creek Road in 1938. Surfacing of the rest of the moved National Pike was deferred by World War II; development continued in 1946 and the new parkway opened in 1948. 

The migrated National Pike was initially assigned USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate; the old and new streets changed to their present assignments in 1952. Regardless of the development of another parkway, enhancements proceeded on the first street. Trolley tracks of the Hagerstown and Frederick Railway were expelled from the roadway in Funkstown and the road was reemerged in 1940. Slope ascending paths were included for a length of the two sides of Braddock Mountain and South Mountain around 1942. The roadway among Funkstown and Boonsboro had bends altered and was enlarged and reemerged in 1949. USÃÂ 40ÃÂ Alternate from USÃÂ 40 in Frederick west to Braddock Mountain experienced a similar kind of work in 1951 and 1952.
