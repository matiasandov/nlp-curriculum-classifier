Mycena intersecta 

Mycena intersecta is a types of mushroom in the Mycenaceae family. First revealed as another species in 2007, it is known just from focal Honshu, in Japan, where it is discovered developing singularly or dissipated, on dead leaves in swamp backwoods ruled by oak. The mushrooms have olive-darker tops up to in distance across on thin stems that are long by thick. On the underside of the top are the indirectly divided, whitish gills that have cross-veins running between them. Tiny qualities of the mushroom incorporate the smooth, sporadically round and hollow cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge), the nonattendance of pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face), the diverticulate components of the top fingernail skin, the comprehensively club-formed to unpredictably molded caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem), the pitifully dextrinoid tissue (recoloring rosy to ruddy darker in Melzer's reagent), and the nonappearance of brace associations. The edibility of the mushroom is obscure. 

The mushroom was first gathered by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 1999, and distributed as another species (alongside seven other Japanese Mycenas) in a 2007 production. The particular appellation is from the Latin word "intersecta" or "met", and alludes to the intervenose gills. Its Japanese name is "Oriibu-ashinagatake" (ÄÂÅÄÂÅÄÂÅºÄÂÂÄÂËÄÂËÄÂÂÄÂÅºÄÂÅ¼ÄÂÄ). 

As per Takahashi, the organism is best arranged in the area "Fragilipedes" (Fr.) QuÄÅ¡l., as characterized by the Dutch "Mycena" expert Maas Geesteranus. 

The top of "M.Ã¢Â intersecta" is at first conelike to arched to chime formed, in the end coming to in distance across. When it is clammy, it is incompletely translucent, with the goal that the frameworks of the gills underneath the top can be seen. The top is to some degree hygrophanous, and dry. Its surface is at first minutely pruinose (as though secured with a fine white powder), yet this impact before long quagmires off, leaving the surface smooth. The top shading is at first olive-dark colored to yellowish-darker, at that point to some degree paler from the edge. The white tissue is up to 0.7Ã¢Â mm thick, and comes up short on any unmistakable taste and scent. The slim stem is long by thick, round and hollow, and empty. Its surface is dry, and hued pale olive-darker close to the top, getting to be olive-dark colored descending. Like the top, it is at first pruinose, however smooths out in age. The base of the stem is secured with coarse white hairs. The gills are adnate to subdecurrent (running marginally down the length of the stem), and remotely separated, with 16Ã¢ÂÂ19 gills achieving the stem. The gills are up to 1.5Ã¢Â mm wide, slender, to some degree intervenose, and whitish, with edges that are a similar shading as the gill faces. Takahashi's portrayal does exclude any discourse of the mushroom's edibility. 

The basidiospores are generally ellipsoid and measure 7.5Ã¢ÂÂ8.5 by 5Ã¢ÂÂ6Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. They are flimsy walled, smooth, lackluster, and inamyloid to feebly amyloidÃ¢ÂÂindicating a frail capacity to assimilate the iodine in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia are 22Ã¢ÂÂ31 by 5.5Ã¢ÂÂ7Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m, club-formed, and for the most part two-spored. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are 27Ã¢ÂÂ40 by 3Ã¢ÂÂ6Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m, inexhaustible, and structure a sterile gill edge. They are sporadically round and hollow to tightened, smooth, dreary, and meager walled. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are missing. The hymenophoral tissue is made of meager walled hyphae that are 5Ã¢ÂÂ18Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide, round and hollow, smooth, boring, and feebly dextrinoid. The top fingernail skin is made of parallel, twisted around hyphae that are 2Ã¢ÂÂ6Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide, round and hollow, and thickly secured with warty or finger-like dainty walled diverticulae that are drab and inamyloid. The layer of hyphae underneath the top fingernail skin are parallel, olive-dark colored, and feebly dextrinoid, with short and expanded cells up to 22Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide. The stem fingernail skin is made of parallel, twisted around hyphae that are 2Ã¢ÂÂ4Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide, round and hollow, smooth to scantily diverticulate. These hyphae bend outward to frame club-molded or unpredictably formed caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are olive-dark colored, inamyloid, and dainty walled. They measure 13Ã¢ÂÂ29 by 3Ã¢ÂÂ7Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m, and are extensively club-formed to unpredictably molded, and frequently have one to three handle like excrescences. The stem tissue is made of longitudinally running, tube shaped hyphae that are 5Ã¢ÂÂ12Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide, smooth, lackluster, and have a pitifully dextrinoid in Melzer's reagent. Clip associations are missing in all tissues of "M.Ã¢Â intersecta". 

The European species "Mycena viridimarginata" is to some degree like "M.Ã¢Â intersecta" in appearance, however might be recognized by its greenish-edged gills, cheilocystidia with suddenly decreasing focuses, and brace associations. 

"Mycena intersecta" is known just from Kanagawa, Japan. The organic product bodies are discovered singular or dispersed, on dead leaves in marsh timberlands overwhelmed by the oak trees "Quercus myrsinaefolia" and "Q.Ã¢Â serrata".
