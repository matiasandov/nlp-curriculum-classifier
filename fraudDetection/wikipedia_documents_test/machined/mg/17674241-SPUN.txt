Creation for the scene occurred in New York City and Los Angeles. 

Weiner considered the content in 2000 while filling in as an essayist for the TV sitcom "Becker". Prior to composing the pilot scene, he examined American writing and film of the 1960s to get a point of view on American culture amid that period. Weiner sent the content to "The Sopranos" maker David Chase, who enrolled Weiner to work with him on "The Sopranos". Weiner racked the undertaking for a long time to concentrate on Chase's program; enthusiasm for "Crazy people" did not surface until the finish of "The Sopranos" last season. 

As indicated by the Nielsen Media Research, the scene accomplished a rating of 1.4 (1.2 million family units) upon beginning airing. 

In 1960, in Manhattan, Don Draper (Jon Hamm), inventive chief for the promoting office Sterling Cooper, is confronting an expert predicament: how to sell cigarettes in spite of expanded open attention to their wellbeing dangers. He looks for contribution from clients and his better half Midge Daniels (Rosemarie DeWitt), yet is unfit to discover an answer. He rejects scholarly research results given by the organization's counseling clinician that recommends a few clients will be attracted to smoking notwithstanding the wellbeing dangers in view of an aggregate "passing wish". 

In the interim, Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) begins work at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary, where she encounters some inappropriate behavior. She appears to be eager to work in Manhattan, however maybe overpowered by her new environment. Office chief Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks) exhorts Peggy on the most proficient method to request the men of the workplace in order to make both progress in her profession and conceivably an invaluable marriage. Junior record official Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) shows up and attire, for which Don reprimands him. On her break, Peggy goes to a medical checkup masterminded by Joan, amid which she experiences a vaginal examination and is given a solution for the as of late presented oral preventative, Enovid, which at the time was just expected to be endorsed to wedded ladies with their better half's assent. Later in the day, Peggy makes an explicitly welcoming motion to Don, which he rejects. 

Wear and Roger Sterling (John Slattery) meet with Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff), the Jewish proprietor of a substantial retail establishment. So as to make Rachel all the more decidedly slanted towards the office, Roger enrolls the main Jew in the organization, a young fellow from the mailroom, to go to the gathering camouflaged as an individual from the workmanship office. Wear at first idea the man was the proprietor, not Rachel. Rachel, hoping to draw in wealthier clients, is baffled by the office's recommendations of coupons to pull in economical housewives. The gathering ends up warmed, with Don irate that a lady would converse with him in a telling manner, and Rachel furious that the men have not regarded her arrangements for her business. A later gathering with officials from Lucky Strike tobacco organization likewise seems to go gravely, as Don still battles to locate another way to deal with cigarette publicizing. Pete raises the "passing wish" thought set forth by the organization's examination, yet the officials dismiss this. Exactly when it appears that the gathering is finished, Don concocts another taglineÃ¢ÂÂ"It's toasted!"Ã¢ÂÂand a system that features their technique for readiness, which, despite the fact that it's the same as that of different cigarettes, he proposes will make Lucky Strikes emerge in the psyches of general society. The customer is awed, however after the gathering Don communicates his wrath with Pete for having experienced his rubbish to take the examination information. 

Wear meets Rachel for supper to present appropriate reparations in light of the gathering. Amid the supper, Don says he is living to separate the most extreme measure of delight as there is no tomorrow, while Rachel perceives in Don the component of the disengaged pariah, for whom the world is spread out like a riddle hanging tight to be fathomed. Both of them start to bond, and she consents to give Sterling Cooper another shot. In the interim, Pete and a portion of his associates go to a men of honor's club to observe Pete's looming wedding. There, a lady rejects Pete's advances. Blue from this dismissal and Don's ongoing reactions, Pete arrives alcoholic at Peggy's loft, and she permits him in. Wear takes a train to an extensive house in suburbia, where he is welcomed by his cherishing spouse Betty (January Jones), whom he has made no notice of so far in the scene. He keeps an eye on their two dozing youngsters as she observes reverently from the entryway. 

Maker Matthew Weiner considered the content for "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" in 2000, while he was filling in as an essayist for the sitcom "Becker". The main draft of the scene was composed as a spec content and was titled "The Division". After two years, Weiner sent the content to David Chase, the maker of "The Sopranos", in spite of the fact that Weiner's specialists demanded that he not continue with his arrangements. Pursue later selected him upon first look. "It was what youÃ¢ÂÂre continually wanting to see," he reviewed. "It was vivacious and it had something new to state. Here was somebody who had composed a tale about promoting during the 1960s, and was taking a gander at ongoing American history through that crystal." Weiner put the pilot content aside for the following seven years to concentrate on "The Sopranos". Neither HBO nor Showtime communicated enthusiasm for the venture until the initiation of "The Sopranos" last season. Amid that time, AMC started investigating the TV advertise for new programming. "The system was searching for refinement in propelling its first unique arrangement," as indicated by AMC Networks president Ed Carroll, "and we took a wager that quality would prevail upon equation based mass intrigue." 

Preceding composition the pilot scene, Weiner examined American culture amid the 1960s, investigating artistic works, for example, "The Feminine Mystique" (1963) and "Sex and the Single Girl" (1962) while survey such movies as "The Apartment" (1960) and "A Guide for the Married Man" (1967). He proceeded with his undertakings when the arrangement's idea started to appear, as he got a duplicate of Richard Yates' epic "Progressive Road" (1962) from the administrators of AMC. Weiner talked about the vibe of "Crazy people" with creation originator Bob Shaw and cinematographer Phil Abraham, whom Weiner had recently worked together with in "The Sopranos". Abraham needed to build up an increasingly certifiable way to deal with depicting society during the 1960s, as opposed to "just referencing the period as found in motion pictures of that time. We needed to be more authentic than that. Motion pictures were an impact." In summoning recorded precision of components, for example, engineering and visual computerization, Abraham looked for motivation from the structures planned by the design firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. He stated, "We saw that in all the Skidmore, Owings and Merrill plans of contemporary structures, the ceilingÃ¢ÂÂthe overhead network of lightsÃ¢ÂÂwas a solid realistic component in all the workplace spaces. In one structure we cherished, the entire roof resembled a lightbox. It was a period of high innovation, and we grasped the thought of showing the world in that manner. These were new work spacesÃ¢ÂÂsleek, not stuffy." 

Jon Hamm was given a role as Don Draper, the focal character of the arrangement. Hamm, who was moderately obscure at the time, rivaled 80 different on-screen characters in the trying out procedure. Weiner broadcasted that Hamm precisely depicted the character, saying that he was "the main individual who truly had this incredible blend of compassion and manliness and insight. Both Don and Jon have an internal life. Inasmuch as you have that sort of profundity in a person, individuals will pull for him [...] Jon left the room and I stated, 'That person has lived.'" Hamm conceded that he felt that he had an impressive hindrance contrasted with his companions and at first trusted Thomas Jane would obtain the job. "I began, actually, on the exceptionally, base," he iterated. "I couldn't have had less warmth on me. No one knew my identity. The throwing executives didn't have even an inkling my identity. I wasn't on anyone's rundowns. The amusing thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were informed that Thomas Jane does not do TV." Hamm experienced seven tryouts; his last one occurred at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. "When we were riding down on the lift, the lady accountable for whatever the basic leadership process was let me know, 'You landed the position.'" 

John Slattery, who was later given a role as Roger Sterling, initially tried out to depict Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's greatest draw and was disillusioned after becoming aware of his character's inadequate screen time. He reviewed, "I truly prepared the thing and went in and I buckled down on it and afterward read for Don and they really gave me changes and I went and I did it once more. And afterward they kind of stated, 'Well, look, hereÃ¢ÂÂs the arrangement. We have a person. The reason we requested that you come in and read for Draper is on the grounds that we didn't feel that youÃ¢ÂÂd arrive in a read for Roger in light of the fact that there wasnÃ¢ÂÂt that much Roger in the content.'" During generation of "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," Slattery conceded he was uncertain of whether to keep dealing with "Maniacs". "I was going back and forth somewhat, even while shooting it. What's more, I think Matt at last resembled, 'Look man, weÃ¢ÂÂre not twitching you around here. WeÃ¢ÂÂre genuine about this and IÃ¢ÂÂve truly considered this. I guarantee you this will be an incredible character and it will be a major piece of the show.'" 

Makers of "Lunatics" moved toward January Jones to depict Betty Draper, Don's better half and the mother of their two youngsters. Jones asserted that depicting the character would offer the gathering of people a chance to see a clouded side of her temperament. She at first tried out for the job of Peggy Olson, which was later given to individual cast part Elisabeth Moss. "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was clearly progressively fit to her, yet Matthew had stated, you know, thereÃ¢ÂÂs this other job, of the spouse." Jones marked a seven-year contract with the show, in spite of the fact that her character initially had two lines in "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." Weiner in the end altered the content to oblige her wants. "ItÃ¢ÂÂs such a demonstration of his capacity," Jones expressed. "He just removed something from slight air, which makes me think since he needed to have had a thought that the spouse would have been a piece of the show, since I sort of took the activity with the guarantee that Betty would be a piece of the show. When you sign a seven-year contract, you need to ensure youÃ¢ÂÂre in the show." Christina Hendricks was gotten to play Joan Holloway, the workplace supervisor and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had recently shown up on "ER" before being on "Crazy people", her acting vocation had been to a great extent dormant, and Hendricks' operator encouraged her not to partake in the task. "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have some other huge showsÃ¢ÂÂwhy would you do this as opposed to taking something that is a superior wagered?' I stated, 'Look, I've run with the one that is the better wagered in the pastÃ¢ÂÂlet's run with the great content this time.'" 

"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" highlights visitor appearances from a few on-screen characters and performing artists, including Rosemarie DeWitt (as Midge) and Maggie Siff (as Rachel Menken). DeWitt was given a repetitive job in the season as Don's paramour, which went on for six scenes. She at first felt strange while playing out her character. DeWitt expressed, "They were toward the finish of throwing, and hadn't discovered the correct Midge yet. Initially they had a scene where she opens the entryway wearing a red kimono, and I thought 'I'm not that', so I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt beyond any doubt I was directly for the part. Possibly the way that I wasn't this 'vamp' is the thing that made Matt Weiner give me a shot." Prior to taking a shot at "Psychos", Siff principally worked in theater and performing expressions. 

"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" was planned at US$3 million, somewhat more than the US$2Ã¢ÂÂ2.5 million planned in ordinary "Crazy people" scenes. The pilot scene was for the most part shot at different areas in and around New York City including the Silvercup Studios, where main photography went on for two days. The vast majority of the generation team were beforehand part of "The Sopranos". Subsequent to shooting finished up in New York, generation moved to the Los Angeles Center Studios. Abraham teamed up with a completely unique generation group from the one in New York. As per Abraham, Los Angeles contained a coherence that was identified with the show. "When we moved to L.A., there was a congruity of style that originated from Alan and me, and that was vital to Matt [Weiner]." 

In making a functional impact, a network comprising of glaring lights was introduced onto the set that housed Sterling Cooper's fundamental office. The show's craft division purchased a few 2-by-2 four-tube apparatuses, which was resolved to be precise in respect to the timespan. The shipments touched base on the primary day of taping the pilot. Be that as it may, examination by the set-lighting team uncovered the lights utilized were inside modernized, having been intended to hold T-8 knobs estimating two feet each. "Getting in excess of 800 2-foot shading amended T-8 tubes turned into a noteworthy issue, and none of the normal providers had enough in stock," reviewed Mike Ambrose, the gaffer for the generation group in Los Angeles. "Movietone halted generation of whatever knobs it was making, retooled the plant and began fabricating the T-8s we required. The last shipment arrived the morning of our first day of shooting." 

Abraham made a light-control framework trying to shield the overhead from being unflattering. Be that as it may, after fruitlessly endeavoring to execute the vital wiring to control each light, the generation group built up controlling columns of light. Pat O'Mara, the key grasp amid creation, introduced a few 2x1 and 2x2 power outage boards and casings that were retrofitted with little yet solid magnets. Amid a scene when and on-screen character or on-screen characters remained under a glaring light, a board or an edge was set over the installation, in this manner diffusing light onto their countenances. "In the event that someone was strolling through the workplace in a wide shot, I simply turned the overhead lights on. However, on the off chance that Don was conversing with somebody at his work area and the workplace was the scenery, I turned every one of the lights on and afterward specifically expelled a few; at that point, I carried the key around with Kino Flo Image 80s through 4-by-8 casings of 250 or 216, or sourced my key with a bigger Fresnel through the window." 

The set containing Sterling Cooper's corporate workplaces contained skypans fitted with 5K knobs onto the focuses, which estimated 8Ã¢Â inches separated. Ambrose worked together with the creation group to found twenty-five inch brackets on chain engines and to devise dollys with Arri Alexa cameras that were in the long run introduced on aluminum I-bars. Ambrose announced that the adaptability of the trolleys and chain engines empowered generation to move all the more effectively in focusing on the structure of the window. He included: "We additionally had four 20Ks and a couple of more T-12s on stands that could be moved around the workplace floor. For tungsten close-ups, we frequently utilized Barger-Baglite six-and three-light units with Chimeras, delicate fabric, diaper astounds and 60-and 90-degree honeycomb networks for control." In correlation, Ambrose utilized customary lighting while making the lodging for the character, as he supported the shading range of a family unit light. For instance, Don's home expected four to five rooms to be lit at the same time. "We utilized a ton of secure strips with 100-watt family globules," noted Ambrose. "The globules are so close they're practically contacting, so they make a solitary source that doesn't cast different shadows. After some time, we fabricated lodgings for them with channels into which you can slide dissemination edges or egg cases. We call them 'Whiteys' on the grounds that the person who thumped these shells out of tin back in New York was named Whitey; I utilized them broadly on "The Sopranos" and felt they fit the homes in "Crazy people" too." 

In the days prompting the "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" debut, the guard dog bunch Commercial Alert recorded a grumbling against makers to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Observers from the gathering scrutinized refinery brand Jack Daniel's for its choice to support "Crazy people", refering to that it disregards industry codes that disallow liquor promoting, also "delineations of untrustworthy drinking, obvious sexual movement or explicitly prurient pictures". Robert Weissman, the chief for Commercial Alert, expressed that dependent on AMC's site, "it gives the idea that the sponsorship plan will damage various arrangements of the business' self-administrative promoting code." He proceeded: "There is no motivation behind why an organization ought to have the capacity to escape typical authorization and usage of the Code essentially on the grounds that it abuses the code in such shameless way that relieving the infringement would cause non-minor complexities for a noteworthy TV arrangement." In relationship with the objection, Weissman encouraged in his letter that the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States become progressively proactive in controlling the refineries' drives in media outlets. "Our protest in this occasion isn't with the depiction of substantial liquor utilization, or even with the glorification of such overwhelming utilization; it is explicit to industry sponsorship of and entwinement with such depictions. Very extraordinary issues are raised where specialists delineate such exercises without industry sponsorship." 

"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" was initially communicated on July 19, 2007 in the United States on AMC. After airing, the scene obtained a 1.4 rating (1.2 million families) as per the Nielsen Media Research. All out viewership was 75 percent higher than all TV programming airing on Thursdays on AMC. 

Correspondents lauded the pilot scene. Heather Havrilesky of "Salon" proclaimed that "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" raised desires for future challenge at the time, and included that it imitated the absolute best scenes of "The Sopranos". "Chicago Tribune" writer Maureen Ryan said that it was an "astutely made character dramatization". In his four star audit, Adam Buckman of "New York Post" portrayed it as "shocking" and proposed that "Crazy people" "simply happens to be the best new TV arrangement of the late spring and perhaps the whole year". Tim Goodman of the "San Francisco Chronicle" and Brian Lowry of "Assortment" praised the scene for its recorded exactness; "since they're on the cusp of another decade does not mean they can perceive what watchers definitely know is around the bend," expressed Goodman. "That looming change gives an additional component of viewpoint to the arrangement." Lowry tended to that in spite of the unobtrusive methodology of "Crazy people", it figured out how to incite a significant importance. "In that specific situation, the show outlines that period's own type of abundance without swaying fingers, while advising us that before sex, medications and shake 'n' move, there was lewd behavior, free-streaming mixed drinks and soul-filled anthems, constantly sung by white folks." "USA Today" essayist Robert Bianco resounded synonymous notion: ""Mad Men" is a delight to watchÃ¢ÂÂthe garments, the timekeepers, the furnishings, it resembles a mid-century night's fantasy. Be that as it may, this is no minor period piece. It's a savvy, complex dramatization that endeavors to overcome the exteriors that have constantly concealed reality." 

Troy Patterson of "Slate" attracted correlations with the HBO parody dramatization "Sex and the City", and confirmed that it presented a licentious and critical viewpoint of the alleged "brilliant age" of commercial. Nancy Franklin of "The New Yorker" inferred that "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" was "brilliant and hugely alluring", while "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" writer Melanie McFarland felt that it was an irregularity contrasted with other TV portions. Composing for the "Boston Globe", Matthew Gilbert commented that the setting and configuration were promptly recognizable. Gilbert stated, "This is a beautifully molded period piece, from its IBM typewriters and revolving telephones to the steady haze of tobacco smoke hanging over each scene. The show has an unpretentious shading palette, to coordinate the ivory metal Venetian blinds at the Sterling Cooper advertisement office workplaces, however it might sit in your memory as though it had been recorded in highly contrasting." Citing its credibility as a scene feature, Randy Cordova from the "Arizona Republic" noticed that "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" was well-built. 

A few commentators were less excited than the general accord. In spite of the fact that "The New Republic" Sacha Zimmerman expressed that the scene's tasteful highlights were practically identical to true to life works, she insisted that "Maniacs" came up short on any substance, at last censuring the social references and the character improvement introduced in the scene. "Crazy people" is by all accounts endeavoring parody without an arrangement," Zimmerman said. "The inclination is not kidding, not awkward, and there aren't roar with laughter minutes, only a great deal of groanersÃ¢ÂÂat which point, the show basically turns into an impression of its characters: discouraging. Things being what they are, watching touchy, brutal men and unsatisfied, put-upon ladies for an hour simply isn't that much fun." Similarly, Tim Shale of "The Washington Post" presumed that regardless of the suggestive idea of the program, "Smokes Gets in Your Eyes" bombed; "The general population in and around them ruin the show, gum up the works and break veracity." To "New York" John Leonard, the portion felt like a "fifties remaining". 

Pundits applauded the exhibitions of a few cast individuals, explicitly Hamm's depiction of Don Draper. Goodman attested that the acting from the cast individuals was one of the perspectives that conveyed the show. Gilbert assessed that Hamm played his character to "smooth flawlessness".
