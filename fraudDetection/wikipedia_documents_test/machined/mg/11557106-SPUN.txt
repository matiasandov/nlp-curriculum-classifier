It was Uslan's desire "to make the authoritative, dull, genuine form of Batman, the way Bob Kane and Bill Finger had imagined him in 1939. An animal of the night; stalking culprits in the shadows." Richard Maibaum was drawn nearer to compose a content with Guy Hamilton to coordinate, yet the two turned down the offer. Uslan was ineffective with pitching "Batman" to different motion picture studios since they needed the film to be like the goofy 1960s TV arrangement. Columbia Pictures and United Artists were among those to turn down the film. 

A disillusioned Uslan then composed a content titled "Return of the Batman" to give the film business a superior thought of his vision for the film.

Wesley Strick completed an uncredited revise, erasing portrayals of Harvey Dent and Robin and changing the peak. Different A-rundown performing artists campaigned hard for the job of Catwoman before Michelle Pfeiffer was thrown, while Danny DeVito marked on to depict the Penguin. Taping began at Warner Bros. in Burbank, California in June 1991. "Batman Returns" was discharged with money related achievement, yet Warner Bros. was frustrated with the's film industry run since it earned not as much as its ancestor.

Schumacher felt he "owe[d] the Batman culture a genuine "Batman" film. I would return to the nuts and bolts and make a dim depiction of the Dark Knight." He moved toward Warner Bros. to do "Batman: Year One" in mid-1998. 

In spite of Warner Bros. also, Schumacher's enthusiasm with "Year One", Lee Shapiro, a comic book fan, and Stephen Wise pitched the studio with a content titled "Batman: DarKnight" in mid-1998.
