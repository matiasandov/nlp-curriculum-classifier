David III of Tao 

David III Kuropalates (, "DavitÃ¢ÂÂ III Kuropalati") or David III the Great (Ã¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂ III Ã¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂ, "DavitÃ¢ÂÂ III Didi"), otherwise called David II, (c. 930s Ã¢ÂÂ 1001) was a Georgian ruler of the Bagratid group of Tao, a noteworthy area in the GeorgianÃ¢ÂÂArmenian marchlands, from 966 until his homicide in 1001. "Kuropalates" was a Byzantine squire title offered to him in 978 and again in 990. 

David is best known for his urgent help to the Byzantine Macedonian line in the 976Ã¢ÂÂ9 common war and his novel job in the political unification of different Georgian nations just as his support of Christian culture and learning. Somewhere in the range of 987 and 989, David joined his companion Bardas Phocas in a rebel against the Byzantine head Basil II, yet was crushed and consented to surrender his territories to the realm on his demise. However he had the capacity to verify for his beneficiary, Bagrat III, a chance to turn into the main leader of a bound together Georgian kingdom. 

David was the more youthful child of Adarnase V, a delegate of the Second House of Tao, a part of the Kartli line of the Georgian Bagrationi (Bagratid) line which held influence over Tao (a region on the notable Georgian-Armenian fringe referred to the Armenians as Tayk; presently part of Turkey) since the elimination of the first Tao line during the 940s. 

He succeeded his sibling, Bagrat II, as a duke of Tao in 966, and through his expansionist arrangement and adaptable tact started collecting a bigger state. So as to authorize his aspiring plans, David needed to verify his freedom from the Byzantine Empire, which would achieve its most prominent tallness under the head Basil II (r. 976-1025). 

The Byzantines' eastern neighbors Ã¢ÂÂ the divided Armenian and Georgian territories Ã¢ÂÂ once in a while undermined the realm straightforwardly, however were exceptionally compelling to Constantinople as they controlled vital universal exchange courses that went through their spaces. The Byzantines had just added the Armenian realms of Taron (966) and Manzikert (968) and represented a potential peril to the heavenly body of a few Georgian Bagratid territories known as Tao-Klarjeti. Be that as it may, the uprightness of the realm itself was under genuine risk after a full-scale disobedience, driven by Bardas Skleros, broke out in 976. Following a progression of fruitful fights the renegades cleared crosswise over Asia Minor and undermined Constantinople itself. In the earnestness of a circumstance, the youthful head Basil mentioned help from David of Tao, who quickly reacted and sent 12,000 top notch rangers troops under the direction of Tornikios to strengthen the as of late crushed faithful Byzantine general Bardas Phokas, in this way adding to the definitive follower triumph at the Battle of Pankalia close Caesarea on 24 March 979. 

David's reward was the lifetime principle of key royal regions in eastern Asia Minor, referred to the contemporary Georgian sources as the "Upper Lands of Greece" (Ã¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂ Ã¡ÂÄ¾Ã¡ÂÅÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂ§Ã¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂ Ã¡ÂÄÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂ Ã¡ÂÅ¥Ã¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÄÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂÃ¡ÂÂ), comprising mainly of northwestern Armenian terrains: the city of Theodosiopolis or Karin (Geo. Karnu-kalaki, present-day Erzurum, Turkey), Phasiane, Hark (presently MuÄºÂ Province), Apahunik, Mardali (Mardaghi), Khaldoyarich, and Chormayri. On this event, he was conceded the high Byzantine court title of "kouropalates". Basil II likewise remunerated the valor of DavidÃ¢ÂÂs authority Tornikios by financing a Georgian Orthodox religious community on Mount Athos. Albeit populated now mostly with Greek priests, it is right up 'til today known as Iviron, "of the Iberians (for example Georgians)". 

These imposing acquisitions made David the most powerful ruler in the Caucasus, empowering him to meddle in and parley dynastic question in both Georgia and Armenia. The medieval Georgian creators call him "most noteworthy of the considerable number of lords of Tao" and the eleventh-century Armenian writer Aristakes Lastivertsi depicts him as: 

Being responsible for exceedingly critical business focuses, his realm benefitted from burdening the real exchanging courses going through southwestern Caucasus and eastern Anatolia. David put these incomes in broad structure ventures: developing towns, fortifications and houses of worship, and advancing Georgian devout networks and social exercises both in Georgia and abroad. 

Having no offspring of his own, David received his brother, the youthful sovereign Bagrat, beneficiary to the Bagratid position of authority of Kartli (Iberia). He did as such in line with the fiery Georgian aristocrat Iovane Marushis-dze. Through his blessed bloodlines Bagrat was bound to sit upon two positions of authority. Besides, through his mom Gurandukht, sister of the childless Abkhazian ruler Theodosius III, Bagrat was a potential beneficiary to the domain of Abkhazia. Making an arrangement for the formation of an all-Georgian state, David involved Kartli for his encourage child in 976 and repelled the troops from the easternmost Georgian kingdom of Kakheti, which had as of late involved the western division of Kartli with its stone cut city of Uplistsikhe. After two years, in 978, David and Marushis-dze verified the crown of Abkhazia for Bagrat by uprooting Theodosius III. 

DavidÃ¢ÂÂs favorable circumstances changed in 987 when he, on edge to make his broad belongings an inherited Bagratid area, joined his long-lasting companion Bardas Phokas in a disobedience to the ruler Basil. When the dissidents were crushed by the Byzantine-Rus' powers in 989, Basil dispatched a solid power under John of Chaldea to rebuff the Georgians, and David needed to submit. Accommodated with the head, he was in truth, in c. 990, the title of kuropalates again as a byproduct of his guarantee that upon his demise the grounds recently set under his power would return to the Byzantine Empire. 

Another issue emerged around that year, when Bagrat of Abkhazia arranged a corrective endeavor against the non-accommodating duke Rati of Kldekari in Lower Kartli. Induced that his cultivate child expected to assault Tao and execute him, David pounded the military driven by BagratÃ¢ÂÂs normal dad Gurgen on its walk to Kldekari. As a medieval Georgian recorder relates: 

After the compromise with the ruler and his family, David drove a progression of effective strikes against the Muslim emirates of Lake Van and Azerbaijan. Bagrat II of Georgia (granddad of Bagrat, DavidÃ¢ÂÂs adoptee), and Gagik I of Armenia aligned themselves with David, who recovered Manzikert from the Marwanid emir of Diyar Bakr around 993 and assaulted Akhlat, another vital fortification of this Kurdish administration, in 997. Mamlan, the Rawadid emir of Azerbaijan, was additionally twice vanquished, the second time conclusively, in 998, close Archesh. 

David was killed by his nobles right off the bat in 1001. As indicated by Aristakes: 

In spite of the fact that the "Georgian Chronicles" keep up that David kicked the bucket in 1001, a few Armenian and Muslim records recommend he may have passed on in 1001. Aristakes gives the date of DavidÃ¢ÂÂs demise as March 28, 1001, which is intently validated by another Armenian writer Asoghik who says David kicked the bucket on the Easter day of the year 449 of the Armenian logbook, i.e., March 31, 1001. One more Armenian, Samuel Anetsi, additionally puts the date as 1001. 

Basil II was around then in the eastern territories of his realm, wintering on the plain of Tarsus following his battle against the Fatimid administration in Syria. On becoming aware of DavidÃ¢ÂÂs passing he walked north-eastbound to guarantee the terrains David had guaranteed to the ruler. The nearby Georgian and Armenian respectability submitted with no genuine opposition. The main outstanding occurrence happened when a squabble between a Georgian fighter and a Varangian Guardsman over a bunch of roughage formed into a noteworthy battle, including 6,000 Varangians and ending the lives of thirty Georgian high-positioning nobles. 

Ruler Bagrat, DavidÃ¢ÂÂs encourage child, met with Basil be that as it may, unfit to counteract the extension of DavidÃ¢ÂÂs domain, needed to perceive the new fringes in remuneration of the royal title of "kouropalates". Notwithstanding this difficulty, Bagrat had the capacity to turned into the primary ruler of an all-Georgian bound together government, an outcome tried conceivable generally by the endeavors of David of Tao, who, as the cutting edge researcher Stephen Rapp puts in, "suitably positions high on any 'Best Ten' rundown of Georgian history." 

There is some difference among present day researchers on whether David surrendered to the Byzantines just those terrains which had been conceded to him as a reward for his help against the agitator Bardas Skleros, or on the off chance that it had been the entire of his territory that was gained by Basil II. As the previous was enriched upon David for lifetime stewardship, it would be increasingly sensible to expect that he yielded his whole domain, i.e., Thither Tao/Tayk and the neighboring Armenian districts up to Lake Van. Whatever the degree of DavidÃ¢ÂÂs space, the Georgian rulers would not all that effectively accommodate with the loss of those regions, prompting a progression of contentions with the Byzantine Empire in the eleventh century.
