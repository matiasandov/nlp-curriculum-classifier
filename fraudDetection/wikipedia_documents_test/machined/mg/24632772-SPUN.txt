Mycena nargan 

Mycena nargan, ordinarily known as the Nargan's hat, is a types of growth in the Mycenaceae family, and the sole individual from the area "Nargan" in the variety "Mycena". Revealed as another species in 1995, it is known overwhelmingly from Southern Australia. The saprobic parasite produces mushrooms that develop on well-rotted wood, frequently on the underside of wood lying in litter. The dull chestnut-hued tops are secured with white, effectively evacuated scales, and achieve measurements of up to wide. The pale, slim stems are up to long and have white scales at the base. On the underside of the top, the cream-shaded gills are generally divided and gruffly connected to the stem. The edibility of the mushroom is obscure. 

The species was first found in 1992 in Kuitpo Forest, South Australia, and revealed as new to science in a 1995 "Australian Systematic Botany" distribution. The species name alludes to the nargan or nargun, a legendary native being Ã¢ÂÂ initially the mycologists Tom May and Bruce Fuhrer had called it "nargan", as its white dots shimmered in obscurity like the eyes of the nargan, and Cheryl Grgurinovic joined this into its particular sobriquet. It is generally known as "Nargan's hood", however has additionally been alluded to as the "spotted pixie top". 

Regarding infrageneric grouping (i.e., ordered positioning underneath the dimension of class) in "Mycena", a few attributes propose the mushroom fits best in Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus' area "Fragilipedes": the ellipsoidal, amyloid spores; dextrinoid spore-bearing tissue; smooth cheilocystidia; gills with the edge a similar shading as the face; and the non-vile, particularly hued top. As per the 1986 infrageneric arrangement proposed by Rolf Singer, the mushroom would be characterized in subgenus "Mycena", subsection "Ciliatae", stirps "Alcalina" (generally proportionate to segment "Fragilipedes" of Maas Geesteranus) due to the amyloid spores, smooth, stretched cheilocystidia, dull-shaded color, and stem without either latex or a vile sheath. Grgurinovic raised the new segment "Nargan" to suit "M.Ã¢Â nargan", in light of the fact that its scales, absence of coarse fibrils at the base of the stem, and absence of pruinose covering implied it was anything but a solid match for segment "Fragilipedes". 

The tops of youthful mushrooms are at first egg-molded to conelike, extending to progress toward becoming chime formed and up to 2Ã¢Â cm (0.8Ã¢Â in) in width. At first, the edge of the top is rolled inwards; it ordinarily accept a lighter shading than the focal point of the top surface. Dull dark colored in shading, the mushroom is recognized by the nearness of white dots or scales on the top and stem; these scales may vanish when they become sloughed off or washed away by downpour, which can make the species difficult to perceive. The thick gills have an adnate connection to the stem (comprehensively joined to the stem somewhat over the base of the gill, with the greater part of the gill intertwined to the stem), and are white to light dark in shading, paler toward the edge. There are about 24Ã¢ÂÂ28 gills broadening totally from the top edge to the stem, and a couple of levels of lamellulae (shorter gills does not stretch out completely from the edge to the stem). The flimsy stem is up to 4Ã¢Â cm (1.6Ã¢Â in) high and 0.3Ã¢Â cm (0.12Ã¢Â in) wide, and does not have a ring. Youthful examples will commonly have whitish scales at the base; later, these will swamp off and a felt-like whitish mycelium might be clear. The mushroom have no particular smell. The spore print is white or cream. The edibility of the mushroom has not been accounted for. 

The spores of "M.Ã¢Â nargan" are generally ellipsoid, smooth, hyaline, and measure 7.4Ã¢ÂÂ10.4 by 4.8Ã¢ÂÂ7.1Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm. They have a little, sideways apiculus, and need oil beads. As far as recoloring responses, they are acyanophilous (not retaining methyl blue color), and amyloid (turning blue-dark in Melzer's reagent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-formed, have clip associations at their bases, and measure 29.6Ã¢ÂÂ36.4 by 8.2Ã¢ÂÂ10.7Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm. They are four-spored, and the spores are appended to the basidia by long slim sterigmata that are up to 7.2Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm long. The gill edge is sterile (without basidia), and has adundant cystidia. These dainty walled cheilocystidia extend fit as a fiddle from swollen in the center with a mouth like point, to axle formed (fusiform) to club-molded. They are smooth, hyaline, and inamyloid, with measurements of 20.8Ã¢ÂÂ38.4 by 4.8Ã¢ÂÂ10.4Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm. They have a clasp association at base. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent in this species. The gill tissue is made of smooth, slight walled barrel shaped to egg-formed cells, up to 30.4Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm in width. The cells are dextrinoid (delivering a dark to blue-dark positive response with Melzer's reagent), and ruddy darker. The outside of the top (the pileipellis) is made of a layer of twisted around filamentous hyphae estimating 1.8Ã¢ÂÂ4.8Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm. These approximately organized hyphae are marginally gelatinised, smooth, slight walled, hyaline, inamyloid, and have cinch associations. The tissue layer legitimately under the pileipellis (the hypodermium) has cells containing darker shade. The top tissue comprises of smooth, slim walled, barrel shaped to extensively round and hollow or ovoid cells, up to 37.0Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm in width, with cinch associations. These cells are dextrinoid and rosy orange-dark colored in shading. The outside of the stem is made of filamentous hyphae, 2.2Ã¢ÂÂ4.0Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm in width, either smooth or with inadequate to respectably thick short, pole like to barrel shaped projections. The cells are dainty walled to in all respects somewhat thick-walled, hyaline, inamyloid, and have cinch associations. Caulocystidia (cystidia on the top surface) are absent. The stem tissue comprises of short, barrel shaped cells, up to 28.0Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm in measurement that are smooth, slight walled, and with or without dark colored shade in the cytoplasm. The cells contain cinch associations and are ruddy orange-dark colored. 

"Mycena nargan" has an unmistakable appearance, and is probably not going to be confused with different Mycenas. Notwithstanding, one noted inadvertent misidentification happened when the "M.Ã¢Â nargan" on the spread photo of Bruce A. Fuhrer's 2005 book "A Field Guide to Australian Fungi" was marked as "Mycena nivalis", a species with a white top. 

A typical mushroom, "Mycena nargan" is discovered developing independently or in bunches on the underside of spoiling wood in wet and shaded regions, and is particularly inclined toward "Eucalyptus" and "Pinus pinaster". Organic product bodies typically show up from April to June. The species has been recorded from Tasmania, Victoria and southeastern South Australia. The Australian Fungimap activity has announced secluded accumulations in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, in spite of the fact that most of sightings have been in Tasmania and Victoria. The growth is saprobic, which means it gets supplements from dead or biting the dust natural issue. A field ponder directed in Tasmania demonstrated that it is considerably more liable to be found in develop eucalypt backwoods (characterized as having developed somewhere around 70 years before the last out of control fire) than youthful, recovering woodland that had encountered clearfelling, consuming, and sowing a few years beforehand.
