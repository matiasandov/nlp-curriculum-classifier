The railroads originally came to Avonmouth in 1865, when administrations started on the Bristol Port Railway and Pier (BPRP), an independent railroad which kept running along the north bank of the River Avon to a profound water wharf on the Severn Estuary. The BPRP line went through the site of the present station and past to an end at the first Avonmouth station. The BPRP kept running into inconvenience by 1871 when the terminal dock at Avonmouth wound up hard to use because of a development of sediment. With no prospect of an appropriate dock being subsidized without an association with the national rail organize, the Clifton Extension Railway (CER) was endorsed. This was a joint endeavor by the BPRP, Great Western Railway (GWR) and Midland Railway (MR) which kept running from Sneyd Park Junction, south of , by means of , to get together with the national system at Narroways Hill Junction. The connection opened in 1877, however at first just for merchandise trains. The course from Sneyd Park Junction to Clifton Down was hence cleared for traveler use on 3 August 1878, however the Midland and Great Western Railways did not think the BPRP track was in an appropriate condition thus would not run any traveler prepares past Clifton Down. 

The station, initially known as Avonmouth Dock, was opened in 1877, not long after the opening of the Avonmouth Docks in February that year. It was based on, or extremely close to, the site of a stop worked in 1868 for the Docks' development laborers. The neighborhood still generally country Ã¢ÂÂ there were a couple of structures around the station region, just as the docks, with the nearest degree of the Bristol conurbation away at Shirehampton. The station cost ÃÅ275 to fabricate, and was simply a stage on the south side of the single track, served by eight trains for each day between and the BPRP's Avonmouth end, expanding to ten every day from 1887. The Great Western and Midland Railways considered the station deficient for the traveler numbers expected, thus acquired extra land to upgrade the station with additional tracks. The new station contained a wide island stage Ã¢ÂÂ the northern face on the first through line, the southern face being for another terminal line. The station, presently known as Avonmouth Dock Joint, was built utilizing primarily wood and layered iron. It was opened on 1 September 1885, harmonizing with the start of traveler benefits past Clifton Down. The Great Western at first offered six trains for every day every bearing between Avonmouth Dock and . Dreading rivalry, the BPRP did not enable travelers to utilize GWR benefits between its stations. The Midland Railway did not run any traveler benefits past Clifton Down, aside from a one-month preliminary administration in September 1885. Notwithstanding the expanded traffic the BPRP endured monetarily, and was taken over by the CER in 1890.

In 1910, some traveler prepares by and by started to keep running past Avonmouth Dock, proceeding towards on the recently opened Henbury Loop Line, which permitted merchandise trains to the docks to maintain a strategic distance from the precarious Clifton Down Tunnel. Different trains landed from London by means of the circle, interfacing with steamer administrations to Canada and Jamaica. Now there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth Dock and 15 back every day; expanding to 21 and 19 separately by 1920.

After the war, development of the Bristol Portway along the Avon Gorge required the conclusion of the line from Sneyd Park Junction to Hotwells, with trains along it stopping on 3 July 1922. By this point there were nine trains for each day from Hotwells, and eight return. To make up for the loss of administration, the Great Western gave an extra four trains day by day from Avonmouth Dock to Bristol and six return. In 1923, gathering brought about the Midland Railway being retained into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line proceeded in a joint course of action between the Great Western and the LMS. The motor shed was shut in 1924. 

By the mid-1920s, the station was demonstrating deficient for the traveler numbers, thus work started on a thorough reconstruct in 1926. The new structures were made of block; with an expansive, four-chimneyed constructing containing the majority of the offices; just as a different bundles office. The northern stage had a wooden shade constructed, which is still set up today. 

From 1928 numerous administrations to Avonmouth Dock were stretched out to . By 1947, just before the railroads were nationalized, there were 33 benefits every heading between Avonmouth Dock and Temple Meads, with 18 on Sundays. A few trains made roundabout excursions to and from Temple Meads by means of Clifton Down and Henbury or . 

At the point when the railroads were nationalized in 1948, administrations at Avonmouth Dock went under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. By 1955, administration levels had diminished marginally to 28 trains for each day from Bristol and 29 return, yet the administrations were at ordinary interims. Traveler numbers anyway dropped pointedly in 1961 as the consequence of an admission increment, thus in 1962 another decreased timetable was sanctioned, which lost more travelers. After a year in 1963, the Beeching report proposed the total withdrawal of administrations along the line, at the end of the day just those past Severn Beach or by means of Henbury were pulled back. Products administrations from the station finished on 20 June 1966, that day that the station was renamed "Avonmouth". The inlet stage was removed from use and the land later taken for mechanical structures. From 17 July 1967 all staffing was pulled back from stations along the line, including Avonmouth, with tickets issued by the train protect. The station structures on the island stage made due into the 1970s, as did the footbridge, yet except for the bundles office, all were later crushed. The packages office was being used in 2006 as a hairdressing salon. The flag enclose was shut January 1969, and in September 1973 the wooden dimension crossing doors were supplanted via programmed lifting hindrances. By 1974, administration had decreased to 19 trains for every day toward every path, with no Sunday administrations to Severn Beach. 

English Rail was part into business-drove segments during the 1980s, at which time activities at Avonmouth go to Regional Railways. As of now, all trains hurried to Severn Beach, yet the administration design was unpredictable. This changed in 1995 when an hourly timetable was presented for pinnacle times, however northbound administrations were ended at Avonmouth. 

At the point when the railroad was privatized in 1997, neighborhood administrations were diversified to Wales and West, which was prevailing by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express, in 2001. Following activity by Friends of Severn Beach Railway and a series of dissents, administrations had expanded to 10 every day toward every path by 2005, with Bristol City Council giving an endowment to Wessex Trains. The Wessex establishment was amalgamated with the Great Western establishment into the Greater Western establishment from 2006, and obligation go to First Great Western, a backup organization of FirstGroup, in this way rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015. A base administration prerequisite was composed into the establishment understanding, guaranteeing an hourly administration along the line, and this has since been expanded to three trains like clockwork (25 trains for every day). Sunday administrations to Severn Beach were reestablished in 2010. 

The final station assembling, the old packages office, is undermined with decimation by Network Rail, which possesses the station. System Rail expresses that the structure is past financial fix, yet neighborhood rail campaigners, including Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways and MP Charlotte Leslie, have appealed to avoid the pulverization. 

First Great Western declined a legally binding alternative to proceed with the Greater Western traveler establishment (of which administrations at Avonmouth are a section) past 2013, refering to a craving for a more drawn out term contract because of the looming move up to the Great Western Main Line. The establishment was put out to delicate, yet the procedure was ended and later rejected because of the aftermath from the breakdown of the InterCity West Coast establishment rivalry. A two-year establishment augmentation until September 2015 was concurred in October 2013, and in this manner stretched out until March 2019. 

With the coming move up to the Great Western Main Line, the principle line from London to Bristol is expected to be charged by 2016. Notwithstanding, the jolt won't stretch out past the primary lines, so Avonmouth will keep on being served by diesel trains. Stephen Williams, MP for Bristol West; and the gathering Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways bolster the jolt being reached out to the Severn Beach Line. 

Improved administrations at Avonmouth are called for as a feature of the Greater Bristol Metro plot, a rail transport plan which means to upgrade transport limit in the Bristol region. There is a desire for half-hourly administrations, with trains towards Bristol ending on the other hand at and , anyway because of the extensive areas of the Severn Beach Line which are single-track, and to the blocked primary line from Temple Meads, such recurrence isn't as of now attainable. The improvement plot was given the approval in July 2012 as a major aspect of the City Deal, whereby nearby committees would be given more prominent power over cash by the legislature. There are likewise requires the reviving of the Henbury Loop Line, which could permit an immediate administration from Avonmouth to . Plans for a circle were dismissed by the West of England Joint Transport Board, be that as it may 

Bristol City Councilors casted a ballot to send the choice back to the board for further discourse.
