Pharnavaz I of Iberia 

Pharnavaz I (; ) was a ruler of Kartli, an antiquated Georgian kingdom known as Iberia in the established artifact. "The Georgian Chronicles" credits him with being the principal ruler establishing the sovereignty of Kartli and the Pharnavazid line, while other free accounts, "The Conversion of Kartli" makes him the second Georgian ruler. In light of the medieval proof, most researchers find PharnavazÃ¢ÂÂs rule in the third century BC: 302Ã¢ÂÂ237 BC as indicated by Prince Vakhushti of Kartli, 299Ã¢ÂÂ234 BC as indicated by Cyril Toumanoff and 284Ã¢ÂÂ219 BC as per Pavle Ingoroqva. Pharnavaz's ascent and the appearance of the Iberian government was straightforwardly attached to the triumph of Alexander the Great over the Achaemenid Empire. 

As indicated by the "Georgian illustrious records", Pharnavaz dropped from Uplos, child of Mtskhetos, child of Kartlos, who was one of the incredible and acclaimed eight siblings, who from their part were relatives of Targamos, child of Tarsi, the grandson of Japheth, child of the Biblical Noah. He isn't legitimately verified in non-Georgian sources and there is no unmistakable contemporary sign that he was to be sure the first of the Georgian lords. His story is immersed with amazing symbolism and images, and it appears to be plausible that, as the memory of the authentic actualities blurred, the genuine Pharnavaz "gathered an unbelievable faÄÂ§ade" and rose as the model pre-Christian ruler in the Georgian chronicles. 

As indicated by the c. 800 narrative "The Life of Kings", Pharnavaz had a recognized lineage, following back to Kartlos, the legendary ethnarch of Kartli. His fatherly uncle, Samara, held the situation of "mamasakhlisi" ("father of the house") of the Georgian clans around Mtskheta. PharnavazÃ¢ÂÂs mother is professed to have been a Persian lady from Isfahan, whom Prince Teimuraz of Georgia and Patriarch Anton I of Georgia relate to a little girl of King Darius III. The whole story of Pharnavaz, albeit composed by a Christian writer, possesses large amounts of antiquated Iranian-like symbolism and spiritualist references, an impression of the archeologically affirmed social and apparently political ties among Iran and Kartli of that time. The name "Pharnavaz" is likewise an illustrative precedent with its root "standard"- being founded on the Persian "farnah", the awesome brilliance accepted by the old Iranians to stamp a genuine dynast (cf. "khvarenah"). The dynastic tag Parnavaziani ("of/from/named for Pharnavaz") is additionally saved in the early Armenian chronicles as P'arnawazean ("Faustus of Byzantium" 5.15; fifth century) and P'arazean ("History of Armenia" 14; most likely the early fifth century), an affirmation that a ruler named Pharnavaz was comprehended to have been the originator of a Georgian tradition. Pharnavaz is likewise referenced in the Stele of Serapit. 

Maybe the most creatively adjusted area of the Georgian archives, the story pursues Pharnavaz's life from birth to internment. Matured 3, little Pharnavaz's family is devastated, and his legacy is usurped by Azon introduced by Alexander the Great amid his battle in Kartli. Alexander's intrusion of Iberia, recollected by the Georgian chronicled custom, yet in addition by Pliny the Elder (4.10.39) and Gaius Julius Solinus (9.19), seems, by all accounts, to be memory of some Macedonian obstruction in Iberia, which more likely than not occurred regarding the campaign referenced by Strabo (11.14.9) sent by Alexander in 323 BC to the bounds of Iberia, looking for gold mines. 

Pharnavaz is raised illegitimate, however an enchantment dream, in which he blesses himself with the pith of the Sun, proclaims the peripeteia. He is influenced by this vision to "give [himself] to respectable deeds". He at that point sets off and goes chasing. In a quest for a deer, he experiences a mass of fortune put away in a concealed cavern. Pharnavaz recovers the fortune and adventures it to mount a dependable armed force against the overbearing Azon. He is supported by Kuji of Colchis, who inevitably weds Pharnavaz's sister. The agitators are likewise joined by 1,000 warriors from Azon's camp; they are misguidedly alluded to by the creator as Romans, and professed to have been entitled by the triumphant Pharnavaz as "aznauri" (i.e., nobles) after Azon (this historical underpinnings is false, be that as it may). 

The fundamental strings of Pharnavaz's story - an illegitimate kid covered up and brought up in a remote mountains, an overlooked ancestry, his fantasies, sacral authority, sunlight based symbolism, the chase, disclosure of cavern hid treasure and so forth are reminiscent of legends about Iran's establishing lords, similar to Cyrus the Great and Ardashir I. Pharnavaz's self-anointment may have a Sasanian motivation, as some early "Shahanshahs" delegated themselves. 

In the resulting fight, Azon is vanquished and slaughtered, and Pharnavaz turns into the lord of Kartli at 27 years old. He is accounted for to have recognized the suzerainty of the Seleucids, the Hellenistic successors of Alexander in the Middle East, who are managed by the Georgian annals the nonexclusive name of Antiochus. 

Pharnavaz is additionally said to have designed his organization upon an "Iranian" display. 

Pharnavaz had presented a military-managerial association dependent on a system of local governors or "eristavi". The emblem of the eristavi, got from the lord, established a staff, a unique seal ring, belt and weapon. Iberia had in absolute seven eristavis, in Colchis, Kakheti, Khunani (current northern Azerbaijan), Samshvilde (Kvemo Kartli), Tsunda (included Javakheti, Kola and Artaani), Odzrkhe and Klarjeti. The kingdom had one spaspet who was under the immediate control of the regal power situated in Inner Kartli. Eristavates imitated parts of Achaemenid "satrapies" and Seleucid "strategoi". The real rationale of later student of history of the annals was to persuade children that the essential political structure of Kartli was made by the absolute first Georgian ruler in the wake of Wars of Alexander the Great; was of Achaemenid managerial framework and had stayed stable all through Hellenistic, Parthian and Sasanian times. Along these lines, the long haul suitability and solidness of the Georgian domain are built up. 

The hierarchic structure made by Pharnavaz was the accompanying: lord; president (spaspet) of the illustrious armed force; eristavis; center authorities ("atasistavis tsikhistavis") of the armies positioned in the imperial fortresses; junior leaders ("asistavis") who were the more youthful children of the highborn families; hired fighter proficient warriors from the neighboring nations and every one of the officers sorted out around the whole kingdom. 

It is clear that the division of Iberia by Pharnavaz into saeristavos served most importantly a military point, specifically the association of individuals with the end goal of barrier. This association was less coordinated against different nations. In those days the complete populace of the kingdom would have been, including remote hostages and the number of inhabitants in the tributary territories, around 600,000, which could raise a genuinely enormous armed force at least 100,000. As indicated by Strabo the Iberian armed force numbered 70-80,000 so it creates the impression that each saeristavo had 10,000 fighters. 

While Georgian and Classical proof makes the contemporaneous Kartlian joins with the Seleucids conceivable (Toumanoff has even suggested that the lords of Kartli may have supported the Seleucids in holding the resurgent Orontids of Armenia within proper limits), Pharnavaz's supposed change of the eristavi fiefdoms is no doubt a back-projection of the medieval example of subdivision to the remote past. 

Pharnavaz is then answered to have set out on social and social activities; he regulated two structure extends: the raising of the icon Armazi Ã¢ÂÂ supposedly named after him Ã¢ÂÂ on a mountain edge and the development of a likewise named stronghold. 

Pharnavaz made collusions with different North Caucasian people groups amid his rule, to whom he called upon for help against both Macedonia and inner enemies. He took a Durdzuk lady in marriage, so as to solidify the collusion of Iberia with the Durdzuks, who helped him merge his rule against his raucous vassals. Thus he wedded his sister to a Sarmatian boss. 

As per the "Georgian illustrious archives" he likewise made the Georgian content and made the Georgian language an official language of the kingdom: 

The narratives report Pharnavaz's extensive rule of 65 years. 

Upon his demise, he was covered before the symbol Armazi and venerated. His child Saurmag succeeded him to the position of royalty. 

Pharnavaz's grave is undisclosed up until now. One of the last rulers who visited his grave to embellish it and offer his regards was King Mirian III. Pharnavaz's very internment before symbol Armazi recommends a Hellenistic idolization of the early rulers of Iberia. 

A few present day researchers have been enticed to make recognizable proof between the Pharnavaz of the medieval Georgian custom and the Pharasmanes of the Greco-Roman history specialist Arrian, a second century AD creator of "The Anabasis of Alexander". Arrian relates that "Pharasmanes (ÄÂ¤Ã®ÄÄÂÃ®ÄÄÂÃ®ÅºÃ®ÅºÃ®ËÃ®ËÄÂ), lord of the Chorasmians", visited Alexander the Great with 1500 horseman, and promised his help should Alexander want to battle to the Euxine terrains and quell Colchians, whom Pharasmanes names as his neighbors. Aside from the closeness of the names of Pharasmanes and Pharnavaz (the two names are obviously founded on a similar root, the Iranian "farnah"), the ruler of Chorasmia in Central Asia reports Colchis (todayÃ¢ÂÂs western Georgia, i.e., the western neighbor of antiquated Kartli/Iberia) to be a neighboring nation. Some Georgian researchers have proposed that the Greek copyists of Arrian may have mistaken Chorasmia for Cholarzene (Chorzene), a Classical rendering of the southwest Georgian marchlands (the medieval Tao-Klarjeti), which in reality flanked with Colchis and Pontus. 

As indicated by Arrian: 

The Bagrationi administration asserted plunge legitimately from Pharnavaz. Amid the progression of government in Georgia, the Georgian lords introduced themselves as beneficiaries to the Kingdom of Iberia established by King Pharnavaz. 

In Tbilisi there is a King Pharnavaz Street, Avenue, and furthermore a statue of Pharnavaz. Likewise, there are boulevards named after Pharnavaz in Batumi, Kutaisi, Khashuri, Gori, Gurjaani, Sachkhere, Zestaponi and others. A few structures, including schools and lodgings, additionally bear his name, just as around five hundred Georgians.
