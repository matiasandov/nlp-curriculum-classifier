Throw E. Cheddar's Pizza Time Theater was established by Atari author Nolan Bushnell, who was looking to grow the domain of computer game arcades past increasingly grown-up areas like pool lobbies to a youngster and family-accommodating setting. Bushnell's involvement in the entertainment mecca industry, just as his affection for the Walt Disney Company, were persuasive in the conceptualization of the Pizza Time Theater idea. The principal area opened in San Jose, California, in 1977, and was named as the primary family eatery to incorporate sustenance, modest enlivened excitement, and an indoor arcade. In 1978, Bushnell acquired the Pizza Time Theater idea from Atari's then-corporate parent, Warner Communications.

Bushnell has said of his choice to open a pizza eatery, "It was my pet projectÃ¢Â ... I picked pizza as a result of the hold up time and the assemble plan: not many parts and not very numerous approaches to mess it up." After discovering from representatives chipping away at the animatronics that the outfit he purchased was a rat instead of the coyote he thought he was purchasing, Bushnell says he recommended changing the name of the foundation from the arranged "Coyote Pizza" to "Rick Rat's Pizza". Showcasing individuals despised that and proposed "Toss E. Cheddar" rather, which is what was utilized. 

To grow past California and the west coast, Nolan started to establishment, bringing about a co-improvement understanding among himself and Robert Brock of Topeka Inn Management in 1979. The understanding gave Brock selective diversifying rights for opening Pizza Time Theaters in sixteen states over the Southern and Midwestern United States, while additionally framing an organization subdivision, "Pizza Show Biz", to build up the Pizza Time Theaters. 

In November 1979, Brock met Aaron Fechter of Creative Engineering, Inc.

In December 1979, Brock and Fechter shaped "Showbiz Pizza Place Inc", disjoining Brock's business association with Bushnell. ShowBiz Pizza Place was theoretically indistinguishable to Pizza Time Theater in all angles aside from movement, which would be given by Creative Engineering. Showbiz Pizza Place opened its first area on March 3, 1980, in Kansas City, Missouri. 

Upon the opening of ShowBiz Pizza Place, Bushnell sued Brock and Topeka Inn Management over break of agreement. Brock quickly issued a counter-suit against Bushnell, refering to distortion.

Amid this period, Topeka Inn Management likewise changed its name to Brock Hotel Corporation and moved its central station to Irving, Texas. The two eateries experienced expanded accomplishment as the computer game industry turned out to be increasingly hearty, and, to look after challenge, the two establishments ceaselessly altered and broadened their animatronic appears. 

In 1981, Pizza Time Theater opened up to the world; be that as it may, the advancing computer game industry and the computer game accident of 1983 brought about noteworthy misfortunes for Pizza Time Theater, which lost $15 million out of 1983, and by 1984, Bushnell's obligations were inconceivable, bringing about the documenting of Chapter 11 insolvency for Pizza Time Theater Inc. Showbiz then purchased the foundering organization, reproducing itself as Showbiz Pizza Time Inc. 

After the merger, both eatery networks kept working under their individual titles, while major money related rebuilding had started. Amid this period, Creative Engineering started to disjoin ties with ShowBiz Pizza Time (formally part in September 1990), bringing about the unification of the two brands. By 1992, all eateries expected the name of "Toss E. Cheddar's Pizza". The name was then abbreviated to "Throw E. Cheese's" by March 1995 after an upgraded idea. In 1998, Showbiz Pizza Time renamed itself CEC Entertainment, Inc. to mirror the rest of the chain brand.

The name change had to do with the normal importance of "hurl", which in Australia is a reference to the expression "to hurl". Pizza Time Theater, Inc. additionally opened no less than one eatery in Hong Kong, which shut presently because of the underlying organization's 1984 chapter 11.

In February 2014, Apollo Global Management procured CEC Entertainment, Inc. for $54 per share, or about $950 million. 

In August 2017, the organization started to direct another plan idea at seven redesigned areas (three in Kansas City, three in San Antonio, one in Selma, Texas), marked as Chuck E. Cheddar Pizzeria and Games. These areas highlight increasingly upscale stylistic layout with a "quieted" inside shading plan, an open kitchen, the "Play Pass" card framework to supplant arcade tokens, and the animatronic organize show supplanted by a move floor zone. These changes, alongside developments to sustenance contributions, are expected to enable the chain to give an encounter that can request better to grown-up guests, and support family eating rather than essentially parties. 

While its essential center is pizza, Chuck E. Cheddar's additionally offers cold-cut sandwiches, chicken wings, serving of mixed greens bars, canapÃ©s, platters, and pastries. A few stores are additionally utilized as test areas which include new Chuck E. Cheddar sustenances. Certain Chuck E. Cheddar areas additionally offer brew and wine.

From the season of the organization's commencement to today, one of the principle draws for the stores has been the arcade. The arcade amusements principally comprise of either recovery recreations or video arcade diversions. 

The metal tokens issued by the organization for use in their arcades exist in various assortments, and are gathered by exonumia lovers. The organization once tried a card get to strategy for use with their arcade and aptitude amusements in a single area. The test area would never again use tokens, and rather utilize a refillable card to get to credits, which supplant tokens, and focuses, which supplant tickets. Be that as it may, this was later rejected. It was tried under various names, including "Throw E's. Super Discount Card" and "Toss E. Token Card". 

This technique is at present being tried in certain business sectors once more. Rather than electronic tickets like the previous cards, supporters still convey paper tickets, and the card just replaces the metal tokens. CECE, or CEC Entertainment, has called the new framework "Play Pass". 

Alongside the arcade, the other fundamental draw for the focuses since the start was its animatronic appear, until the mid-1990s. All the more as of late, less consideration has been set on animatronics. Be that as it may, there are presently a few distinct styles of animatronic appears being used inside the organization, contingent upon when the area opened, regardless of whether it was redesigned, and different elements. 

At the point when the principal area opened in 1977, the animatronic characters were included in confined representations holding tight the dividers of the fundamental feasting zone, yet they are never again being used today. The show included Crusty The Cat (the primary character to confront retirement as he was before long supplanted with Mr. Chomp in 1978), Pasqually the singing gourmet specialist, Jasper T. Cheeks, the Warblettes, and the primary focal point of the show, Chuck E. Cheddar. Afterward, eateries additionally included "Men's club" appears in discrete rooms of every eatery. They additionally much of the time changed out the sole female character, as of now named Helen Henny, in the primary show. They accomplished this by applying a corrective change to the current robot, just as a difference in stage background, to coordinate the entertainer. The in-house control framework which comprised of a 6502-based controller in a card confine with different driver sheets was classified "Cyberamics". 

Starting in 1998, the organization's show introduced into new stores, alluded to as "Studio C", comprises of a solitary vivified Chuck E. Cheddar character made by Garner Holt nearby huge TV screens, lighting impacts, and intuitive components. Different characters show up as manikins on the TV screens. The control framework named "Cyberstar" was re-planned starting from the earliest stage and created by Dave Philipsen. In certain business sectors, the organization has likewise attempted another store idea that discards the vivified show totally. This is the Circle of Lights organize which either comprises of a live Chuck E. Cheddar ensemble character or an animatronic in a cutting edge light stage with huge TV screens. In 2017, the chain declared that animatronic shows would be expelled for a modernized move floor. The move is being steered in a bunch of areas before being executed expansive. 

The individuals that performed in the animatronic demonstrates were: 

Two kinds of costumed shows are utilized by Chuck E. Cheese's: the Live show and the Road appear. The Live show is performed at the front of the phase in the showroom, at whatever point a tyke is praising a birthday. In the live demonstrate a modified interpretation of "Cheerful Birthday" is sung to the youngster that is praising the birthday. A costumed Chuck E. Cheddar hits the dance floor with the visitors and sings, while being joined by the cast individuals. The Road show is an act by a costumed Chuck E. Cheddar character, and is performed outside the typical showroom. Kids are assembled through the open declaration framework or by Chuck E. Cheddar himself. Hurl E. Cheddar needs the kids to move so as to win free tickets. The free tickets are tossed toward the finish of the execution for every one of the kids that took an interest.
