SMS "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was the lead ship of the of broadside ironclads worked for the Austrian Navy during the 1860s. She was worked by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino, with her bottom laying in October 1863, propelling in May 1865, and appointing in June 1866 at the flare-up of the Third Italian War of Independence and the Austro-Prussian War, battled simultaneously. The ship was equipped with a primary battery of sixteen 48-pounder firearms, however the rifled weapons initially proposed, which had been requested from Prussia, must be supplanted with old smoothbore firearms until after the contentions finished.

She saw activity at the Battle of Lissa in July 1866, where she smashed and sank the Italian ironclad . Marginally harmed in the crash, "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" had her bow fixed in Malta after the war. She stayed in the Austro-Hungarian armada for the following twenty years, however seriously decreased maritime spending plans attributable to Hungarian lack of engagement in maritime issues prompted an uneventful vocation. She was rearmed with more up to date firearms in 1874 and again in 1882. Stricken from the maritime register in May 1886, "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was utilized as a delicate to the gunnery preparing school from 1889 to 1908. She stayed in the stock until 1916 when she was separated for scrap. 

"Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was long by and large; she had a light emission a normal draft of . She uprooted . She had a group of 511. Her impetus framework comprised of one single-extension steam motor, produced by the "Stabilimento Tecnico" shipyard in Fiume, that drove a solitary screw propeller. The number and kind of her coal-terminated boilers have not endure. Her motor delivered a top speed of from . 

"Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was a broadside ironclad, and she was furnished with a primary battery of sixteen 48-pounder gag stacking weapons. She likewise conveyed a few littler firearms, including four 8-pounder weapons and two 3-pounders. The ship's body was sheathed with fashioned iron defensive layer that was thick on the battery and diminished to at the bow and stern. 

"Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was set down at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste on 6 May 1863. She was propelled on 24 May 1865; the developers were compelled to finish fitting-out work rapidly, as pressures with neighboring Prussia and Italy ejected into the simultaneous Austro-Prussian War and the Third Italian War of Independence in June 1866. "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max"s rifled substantial firearms were still on request from Krupp, and they couldn't be conveyed because of the contention with Prussia. Rather, the ship was equipped with old smooth-bore firearms. Back Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, the authority of the Austrian Fleet, quickly started to activate his armada. As the boats turned out to be completely kept an eye on, they started to direct preparing activities in Fasana. With his banner on board "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max", Tegetthoff conveyed the Austrian armada to Ancona on 26 June trying to draw out the Italians, however the Italian authority, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, would not connect with Tegetthoff. Tegetthoff made another fight on 6 July, however again couldn't convey the Italian armada to fight. 

On 16 July, Persano took the Italian armada, with twelve ironclads, out of Ancona, destined for the island of Lissa, where they touched base on the eighteenth. With them, they brought troop transports conveying 3,000 officers. Persano then went through the following two days assaulting the Austrian barriers of the island and fruitlessly endeavoring to drive an arrival. Tegetthoff got a progression of wires between the 17 and 19 July informing him of the Italian assault, which he at first accepted to be a bluff to draw the Austrian armada far from its primary bases at Pola and Venice. By the morning of the nineteenth, in any case, he was persuaded that Lissa was in actuality the Italian goal, thus he mentioned consent to assault. As Tegetthoff's armada touched base off Lissa on the morning of 20 July, Persano's armada was showed for another arrival endeavor. The last's boats were separated into three gatherings, with just the initial two ready to amass so as to meet the Austrians. Tegetthoff had organized his ironclad boats into a wedge-molded development, driving with "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" at the inside; the wooden warships of the second and third divisions pursued behind in a similar arrangement. 

While he was shaping up his boats, Persano exchanged from his leader, to the turret dispatch . This made a hole in the Italian line, and Tegetthoff caught the chance to partition the Italian armada and make a scuffle. He made a go through the hole, however neglected to slam any of the Italian boats, driving him to pivot and make another endeavor. Amid the second endeavor, Austrian gunfire had debilitated "Re d'Italia"s rudder, abandoning her unequipped for moving. Tegetthoff caught the chance to smash the Italian vessel, and requested his ship to greatest speed. After two impacts that happened at points too angled to even think about inflicting genuine harm, "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" struck the ship all the more legitimately. The Austrian ship's slam tore a vast opening in "Re d'Italia"s body on the port side, however "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" supported no critical harm herself. Tegetthoff turned around course, enabling the Italian ironclad to sway back to port and rapidly sink. Tegetthoff at first arranged his group to bring down pontoons to get the Italians battling in the water, yet the Italian ironclad was drawing closer, and he couldn't enable his ship to turn into a stationary target. Rather, he requested the aviso to stay behind and get the survivors while "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" connected with "San Martino". The other Italian boats, be that as it may, did not understand "Kaiserin Elizabeth" was endeavoring to get the Italian survivors, thus started shooting at her, pushing her far from the men in the water. 

At this point, the seaside resistance deliver was consuming severely, destined to be obliterated by a magazine blast. Persano severed the commitment, having lost two boats, and however his squadron still dwarfed the Austrians, he would not counter-assault with his gravely debilitated powers. Moreover, the armada was low on coal and ammo. The Italian armada started to pull back, trailed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having shown signs of improvement of the activity, stayed away so as not to chance his prosperity. Moreover, the Austrian boats were slower than their Italian partners, thus they couldn't drive a second commitment. As night fell, the restricting armadas separated totally, setting out toward Ancona and Pola, individually. "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" had shot 156 shells over the span of the fight. She hosted continued boarding gatherings on her deck, prepared to assault Italian vessels, yet the open door had not introduced itself in the commitment; steam controlled boats could basically turn around course and withdraw before a boarding gathering could traverse. "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was not essentially harmed by Italian flame or the smashing endeavors. A couple of protective layer plates were marginally unstuck, the paint had been taken from the frame where she had slammed into "Re d'Italia", and she had a minor hole from the blackout, yet she was generally sound. 

Subsequent to coming back to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his armada in the northern Adriatic, where it watched against a conceivable Italian assault. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two nations marked the Armistice of Cormons; this finished the battling and prompted the Treaty of Vienna. In spite of the fact that Austria had vanquished Italy at Lissa and ashore at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian armed force was unequivocally crushed by Prussia at the Battle of KÄÅniggrÄÂ¤tz. With the war over, "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" went into the British Royal Navy shipyard in Malta to have her bow fixed. Because of Austria's annihilation, Kaiser Franz Joseph was compelled to consent to Hungarian requests for more prominent self-governance, and the nation progressed toward becoming Austria-Hungary in the "Ausgleich" of 1867. The two parts of the Dual Monarchy held veto control over the other, and Hungarian lack of engagement in maritime extension prompted seriously diminished spending plans for the armada. In the prompt result of the war, the heft of the Austrian armada was decommissioned and incapacitated. 

In 1869, Kaiser Franz Joseph took a voyage through the Mediterranean Sea in his majestic yacht ; "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max", her sister send , and a couple of oar steamers escorted the Kaiser for the outing to Port Said at the mouth of the Suez Canal. The two ironclads stayed in the Mediterranean while different vessels went through the Canal into the Red Sea in organization with Empress Eugenie of France on board her very own yacht. The Austro-Hungarian ships in the long run came back to Trieste in December. In 1874 she was rearmed with a battery of fourteen gag stacking Armstrong weapons and four light firearms. Her battery was changed again in 1882, with the expansion of four breech-loader weapons, two breech-loaders, a couple of snappy shooting gun firearms, and three auto-guns. "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" was stricken from the maritime register on 19 May 1886 and her combat hardware was decreased to eight firearms. The next year, these were evacuated and a solitary firearm and a weapon were introduced. From 1889 to 1908, she filled in as a delicate to the gunnery preparing school. The ship was at last separated for scrap in 1916 amid World War I.
