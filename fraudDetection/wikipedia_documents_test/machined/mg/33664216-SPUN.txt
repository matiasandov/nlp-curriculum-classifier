Tornado Keila 

Cyclonic Storm Keila (IMD assignment: ARB 02, JTWC assignment: 03A) was the first named tempest of the 2011 North Indian Ocean tornado season. A frail framework for quite a bit of its span, Keila created in the western Arabian Sea in late October 2011, in the midst of a region of possibly good conditions. On NovemberÃ¢Â 2, it quickly sorted sufficiently out to be delegated a cyclonic tempest, which has most extreme continued breezes of in any event 65Ã¢Â km/h (40Ã¢Â mph). Given the name Keila by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the tempest immediately moved shorewards southern Oman close Salalah, and debilitated while winding over the nation. The leftovers not long after moved seaward, disseminating on NovemberÃ¢Â 4. 

The tempest conveyed substantial precipitation to Oman, achieving only over in the mountains close Salalah. Dampness from the tempest spread crosswise over the greater part of the nation, causing streak flooding close to the capital Muscat. Floods from the tempest slaughtered 14Ã¢Â people, harmed more than 200, washed away several vehicles, and harmed numerous structures. Two emergency clinics were harmed, compelling 60Ã¢Â patients to be cleared somewhere else by helicopter. Generally speaking harm was evaluated at US$80ÃÂ million (2011ÃÂ USD). Seaward, Keila upset a vessel beginning from India, executing five of the team and leaving another nine missing; six mariners were safeguarded by the Omani Coast Guard. 

The Intertropical Convergence Zone created a zone of convection in the southeastern Arabian Sea close to the finish of October 2011. The general framework moved west-northwestward, building up a particular low weight territory on OctoberÃ¢Â 27. At that point, the tempest action was as yet disarranged and connected with a feeble course. Ecological conditions were horrible at first, comprising of solid breeze shear and dry air. An anticyclone over the framework made the shear decline by OctoberÃ¢Â 28, in the midst of warm water temperatures of , both increasingly ideal conditions. At that point the dissemination turned out to be well-characterized, albeit still prolonged, and the convection was as yet dissipated. On OctoberÃ¢Â 29, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) assigned the framework as Depression ARB 02 about 885Ã¢Â km (550Ã¢Â mi) east of the Yemeni island of Socotra. 

Convection kept on sorting out and extend as the beginning sorrow proceeded with west-northwestward, controlled by an edge toward the north. In any case, dry air from the Arabian Peninsula and cooler waters demonstrated injurious to the framework, and the dissemination turned out to be progressively disrupted on OctoberÃ¢Â 30. Regardless of the insignificantly ideal conditions, the general structure enhanced NovemberÃ¢Â 1, with articulated outpouring creating along the western fringe. An adjacent float detailed a barometric weight of , which affirmed the expanding association. At 03:00ÃÂ UTC on NovemberÃ¢Â 1, the IMD updated the wretchedness to a profound gloom, and 24Ã¢Â hours later to Cyclonic Storm Keila. At that point, the organization evaluated top 3Ã¢Â minute continued breezes of 65Ã¢Â km/h (40Ã¢Â mph) while the tempest was simply 150Ã¢Â km (95Ã¢Â mi) southeast of Oman. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) additionally assigned the framework as Tropical Cyclone 03A at 03:00ÃÂ UTC on NovemberÃ¢Â 2. 

With cool waters and a horrible period of the MaddenÃ¢ÂÂJulian wavering, Keila neglected to escalate essentially as it moved toward the southeastern Arabian Peninsula. An unpredictable focal thick cloudy created over the course, comprising of shallow convection. A passing trough debilitated the edge toward the north, directing Keila toward the north. In the wake of debilitating to a profound melancholy once more, Keila made landfall close Salalah, Oman around 18:00ÃÂ UTC on NovemberÃ¢Â 2. Around that time, the JTWC stopped warnings, when the tempest was debilitating quickly over land. With an edge toward the north and east, Keila pursued the track of the anticyclone on high, which expedited it back seaward Oman NovemberÃ¢Â 3. Such circling close to the coast was viewed as uncommon by the IMD. As per the organization, the framework proceeded with eastbound and scattered on NovemberÃ¢Â 4. In any case, the JTWC followed the framework further in a post-season investigation, evaluating that Keila strengthened once seaward and achieved crest winds of 100Ã¢Â km/h (65Ã¢Â mph) on NovemberÃ¢Â 3. The office surveyed that the tempest swung toward the southwest and debilitated, just to swing back toward the northwest and disperse over extraordinary eastern Yemen on NovemberÃ¢Â 5. 

There was perplexity in the nation over Keila's power; the IMD grouped it as a cyclonic tempest, while authorities in Oman assigned it as a profound melancholy, in light of accessible perceptions. Authorities cautioned occupants of the potential for substantial precipitation. The Pakistani government additionally cautioned anglers not to dare to the vast oceans, because of the questionable impacts of the tempest. 

While Keila was seaward and still in its formative stages, it brought winds of 41Ã¢Â km/h (25Ã¢Â mph) to Salalah International Airport, and at the season of landfall, the station revealed marginally more grounded breezes of 43Ã¢Â km/h (26Ã¢Â mph). Be that as it may, the tempest's most serious impacts were identified with the substantial precipitation it delivered over Oman, which topped at only over in the mountains close Salalah. In southern Oman, Keila dropped of precipitation at Salalah, the likeness a year of precipitation. Dampness from the tempest combine over the Al Hajar Mountains in northern Oman, delivering serious rainstorms that prompted blaze flooding. Crosswise over southern Oman where the tempest crossed, there were no passings; the majority of the passings happened because of the glimmer floods in northern Oman, where 14Ã¢Â people lost their lives. Three individuals were executed because of electric shocks, another two were squashed to death by extensive items, and nine suffocated. Generally speaking harm was evaluated at US$80ÃÂ million, and over 200Ã¢Â people were harmed across the nation. 

The downpours caused aqueducts Ã¢ÂÂ normally dry riverbeds Ã¢ÂÂ to aggregate with floodwaters, washing ceaselessly several vehicles and upsetting traffic. Cops helped salvage unfortunate casualties who were stranded in overwhelmed aqueducts. A few drivers rode out the floods on the tops of their autos. The storm likewise harmed harvests and homestead structures somewhere else in the nation. Harm was heaviest close to the capital city Muscat, where houses and organizations were harmed by the floods, and there were many car crashes. A school transport was cleared away in Wadi Kabir, in spite of the fact that the understudies were not long after protected by neighborhood specialists. A few structures crumbled in Sur because of the downpours. In the valley close Al-Rustaq, floodwaters cleared away autos, dead creatures, and property, with water levels achieving high in certain spots. The floods harmed two emergency clinics in northern Oman; police helicopters exchanged 60Ã¢Â patients after the offices were shut for support, and different patients were moved to other neighborhood medical clinics. Only days after Keila dispersed, another profound misery undermined Oman and brought extra precipitation. 

Cruising from the Indian province of Gujarat to Dubai, a ship with the call sign "MSV Shiv Sagar MNV 2169" experienced Keila seaward southern Oman. The tempest's high breezes made the vessel invert, murdering five of the mariners, and leaving nine others missing. Six of the group were protected by the Omani Coast Guard.
