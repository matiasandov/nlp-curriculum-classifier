Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen, BWV 51 

Johann Sebastian Bach formed the congregation cantata ("Exult in God in each land" or "Yell for satisfaction to God in all grounds") 51, in Leipzig. The work is Bach's solitary church cantata scored for a performance soprano and trumpet. He created it for general use ("ogni beat)", as it were not for a specific date in the congregation timetable, in spite of the fact that he utilized it for the fifteenth Sunday after Trinity: the primary realized execution was on 17 September 1730 in Leipzig. The work may have been created before, perhaps for an event at the court of Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, for whom Bach had formed the "Chasing Cantata" and the "Shepherd Cantata". 

The content was composed by an obscure artist who took motivation from different scriptural books, particularly from songs, and included as an end chorale a stanza from the psalm "Religious recluse heave, mein Seel, nook Herren". Bach organized the work in five developments, with the performance voice joined by a Baroque instrumental troupe of a virtuoso trumpet, strings and continuo. While the external developments with the trumpet express outgoing individual celebration of God's decency and his ponders, the focal contemplative aria, joined just by the continuo, passes on a "significant articulation of pledge to God". He set the end chorale as a chorale capriccio, the soprano sings the unadorned song to a trio of two violins and continuo, prompting a strange happy fugal Alleluja, in which the trumpet joins. 

The Bach researcher Klaus Hofmann takes note of that the work, curiously prevalent among Bach's congregation cantatas, is one of a kind in the requested virtuosity of the soprano and trumpet soloist, and confirmations "flooding celebration and brilliant excellence". 

Bach utilized the cantata in Leipzig for the fifteenth Sunday after Trinity on 17 September 1730. The recommended readings for the Sunday originated from the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul's exhortation to "stroll in the Spirit" (), and from the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew, which urges the devoted not to stress over material needs, yet to look for God's kingdom first (). The creator is obscure. With no reference to the endorsed readings, he consolidates in the primary development thoughts from , and , and in the focal aria musings from and . The end chorale is the fifth stanza of "", added to Johann Gramann's psalm in KÄÅnigsberg in 1549. Bach utilized a similar stanza in an alternate setting to close his cantata . Bach drove the execution on 17 September 1730. 

Bach's original copy shows the fifteenth Sunday after Trinity "et in ogni beat" ("and whenever"). The last expression demonstrates the conceivable general utilization of the work, with a cantata message that has no immediate importance to the scriptural readings. The devotion for the fifteenth Sunday was included later, showing that the cantata was not expected for the particular event. 

Bach made BWV 51 amid a period when he created church cantatas just sporadically, some of them to finish his prior cycles. As per the Bach researcher Christoph Wolff, Bach may have composed the cantata in no time before 1730 for an obscure event. The execution material endure however does not uncover further detail, other than showing one later execution. Hofmann sees an association with the court of WeiÄÂenfels where a scoring of solo soprano and trumpet was mainstream, and expect that the work may have been initially planned for an act at court by an expert female artist. Bach had composed two birthday cantatas for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels. He was welcome to the birthday festivity of 1729 and came back with the title of (court executive of music of Saxe-Weissenfels), and Hofmann thinks an association between the title and cantata "exceedingly likely". 

Both the soprano part, which covers two octaves and requires a high C, and the performance trumpet part, which now and again exchanges melodic lines with the soprano on an equivalent premise, are incredibly virtuosic. The Bach researcher Alfred DÄÅºrr expect that Bach had a bizarrely talented vocalist, including that a female voice was improbable in moderate Leipzig. As indicated by Joshua Rifkin, Christoph Nichelmann is a conceivable competitor since Bach monitoring his abilities acknowledged him eagerly to the Thomasschule and Nichelmann registered into the school three weeks before the primary execution. The trumpet part was most likely composed for Gottfried Reiche, Bach's foremost trumpeter at the time. The scoring is one of a kind in Bach's cantatas, however was every now and again utilized by Italian arrangers, for example, Alessandro Scarlatti. Bach's child Friedemann Bach masterminded the work by including a second trumpet and timpani. 

The cantata is one of just four sacrosanct cantatas that Bach composed for a performance soprano (on the off chance that one rejects his plan of the cantata for solo bass and oboe , for woodwind and soprano BWV 82a) and no other vocal soloists (the others being , and ), while he composed a few mainstream cantatas for solo soprano: , and . 

Bach organized the cantata in five developments and scored it for a soprano soloist and a Baroque instrumental gathering of trumpets (Tr), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc). The title of the signature score peruses: "Dominica 15 post Trinitatis/et/In ogni Tempo. /Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen. /ÄÂ /Soprano solo/1 Tromba*/2 Violino/Viola/e/Continuo/di/Joh:Seb:Bach". It is the main church cantata by Bach scored for solo soprano and trumpet. The span is allowed as 20 minutes. 

In the accompanying table of the developments, the scoring pursues the "Neue Bach-Ausgabe". The keys and time marks are taken from DÄÅºrr, utilizing the image for basic time (4/4). The instruments are appeared for wind instrument and strings. The continuo, playing all through, isn't appeared. 

The music is concertante and virtuoso for both the trumpet and the soloist. The principal aria and the closing "Alleluja" are in the style of an Italian concerto. DÄÅºrr sees that the five developments are in five diverse melodic structures: concerto, monody, variety, chorale capriccio and fugue. The scoring is most extravagant in the external developments (with the trumpet), and diminished to only continuo in the focal aria. 

The main aria, "" (Exult in God in each land), is in da capo structure, with broadened coloraturas. The topic, with a start in a set of three exhibit, is appropriate to the trumpet. It is first created in a ritornello of the ensemble and after that "continually worked" in the soprano part. 

The main recitative, "" (We ask at your sanctuary), is first joined by the strings, a second part is secco yet arioso. The second part builds up the possibility of "von seinen Wundern lallen" (gab about His marvels) in coloraturas of rhythmical multifaceted nature. 

The second aria, "" (Highest, restore Your integrity), is joined just by the continuo "semi ostinato" which bolsters expressive coloraturas of the voice. The lines in the continuo, in steady development in 12/8 time appear to always ascend, towards the tended to "HÄÅchster" (Highest) which shows up as an octave bounce down. Two broadened melismas express appreciation for being an offspring of God. The musicologist Julian Minchem takes note of that Bach can pass on with humble methods a "significant articulation of pledge to God". 

The chorale, "" (Glory, and commendation with respect), is a chorale rhapsody, with the soprano singing the unadorned tune to a three-section backup of two violins and continuo. 

The chorale leads without a break to a finishing up fugal "Alleluja" with the trumpet, conveying the cantata to an especially merry close. The development starts with the soprano and the reacting trumpet, before different instruments come in to construct a "fine presentation piece". Mincham outlines: "The long streaming melismas flabbergast one with the sheer delight in, and vitality created through, the association with God." 

The determination is taken from the posting given by Bach Cantatas Website. 

The cantata was recorded by sopranos, for example, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (from 1948), Maria Stader (1959), Elly Ameling (1970), Edith Mathis (1972), Edita Gruberova (1979), Lucia Popp (1980), Helen Donath (1983), Elizabeth Parcells (1983), Monika Frimmer (1984), Barbara Hendricks (1989), Christine SchÄÂ¤fer (1999), Siri Thornhill (2007), and Natalie Dessay (2009).
