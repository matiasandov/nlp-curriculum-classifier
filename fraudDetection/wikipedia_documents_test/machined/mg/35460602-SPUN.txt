It is situated on a generally triangular package limited by New York Avenue NW, K Street NW, and tenth Street NW, and is north of the CityCenterDC blended utilize private, office, and retail venture. 

The triangular zone was initially home to Victorian lodging yet in 1977, the city utilized prominent space to buy the territory southwest of Mount Vernon Square itself, and throughout the following couple of years, the homes and organizations on these squares were leveled. During the 1980s, Golub Realty and Willco Construction acquired the site and proposed a 11-story office square. They sold it to Peterson Co., who sold it to Monument Realty in May 1999. Landmark Realty had visualized structure either an office and retail mind boggling, or a 1,000-room inn. They at long last sold it to Boston Properties for $43.2 million in October 2000.

Two little stops exist on the triangular bundle of land, which are claimed by the National Park Service.

The eatery shut in December 2018, and as of January 2019 no substitution occupants have been declared. 

Initially, Victorian-style townhomes involved the triangular region limited by K Street NW, New York Avenue NW, and tenth Street NW on Mount Vernon Square. The area was initially an energetic business locale with sizeable Victorian homes, yet the territory went into a lofty decrease during the 1930s. Amid the 1968 Martin Luther King, Jr. riots, the territory around the square endured revolting, fire related crime, and broad vandalism. 

In 1977, the city utilized prominent space to buy the territory southwest of Mount Vernon Square itself. Throughout the following couple of years, the homes and organizations on these squares were annihilated. One of the keep going organizations to exist on the 901 New York Avenue NW parcel was a Chinese eatery named Nan King (which was one of the principal eateries in the city to serve diminish whole). It remained in business until 1979. In spite of the fact that the Washington Convention Center was developed on the squares only south of 901 New York Avenue, nothing was based on the triangular square itself. In time, it was moved toward a parking area. 

Golub Realty and Willco Construction bought the site from the city during the 1980s. Despite the fact that the site was zoned for private utilize just, in 1988 Golub/Willco proposed fabricating a 11-story place of business on the property. Under a city approach known as "private linkage," Golub/Willco would most likely develop their place of business in the event that they made or redesigned low-pay lodging somewhere else in the city. By May 1992, Golub/Willco had consented to buy a 27-unit condo working in Northwest Washington and to reestablish 149 homes in Southeast Washington, yet the proposed place of business never was built.

Landmark Realty proposed two uses for the parcel; an office and retail intricate, or a 1,000-room inn to serve guests at the D.C. conference hall. Landmark assessed that the inn would cost $206 million. In any case, so as to make it beneficial, the expense would should be diminished to $169 million. In 1999, the legislature of the District of Columbia made an assessment increase locale to advance downtown redevelopment and lodging. Landmark looked for $57.3 million in expense increase financing yet never gotten endorsement from the city for the assets. 

In late October 2000, Monument Realty sold the bundle for $43.2 million to Boston Properties. Despite the fact that news sources announced that Boston Properties planned to manufacture a lodging on the site, the organization expressed that it had never genuinely thought about how conceivable it is. Or maybe, they had planned to develop a place of business for inhabitance by government offices, law offices, and exchange affiliations. The organization declared that development was planned to begin in mid-2001, and to be available to inhabitants by mid-2003. The compositional firm of Davis Carter Scott was procured to plan the structure. The deal to Boston Properties shut on December 8, 2000. Then, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had mentioned proposition from land firms for development of another home office. Boston Properties presented its structure for thought by the SEC not long after the deal shut. In any case, the SEC discounted the site in mid-February 2001. 

Boston Properties had presented its structure plan for SEC thought despite the fact that the site had not yet been zoned for office/retail space. About of the site was still zoned for private lodging. In April 2009, the D.C. Zoning Commission affirmed a "private linkage" concurrence with Boston Properties. The Zoning Commission did as such in light of the fact that Monument Realty had concurred two years sooner to pay into a city-run reasonable lodging development subsidize and burn through $2 million to fabricate three townhouses in a low-salary region Ã¢ÂÂ fulfilling the "private linkage" necessity. 

Notwithstanding the zoning triumph, Boston Properties chose not to start development until it had a lead occupant marked. Be that as it may, a half year later, in November 2001, the law office of Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett and Dunner marked a letter of goal to rent of the structure. Boston Propoerties reported that it proposed to manufacture a , 11-story structure to oblige its occupants. In March 2002, the organization said it would start development in September. It likewise declared that the ground floor would be given to retail, and there would be four dimensions of underground stopping. The Finnegan company's contact was marked in March 2002, at which time Boston Properties expanded the floor space to and deferred the normal fulfillment date to late 2004. 

Boston Properties shut the parking area in late August 2002, and started development the next month. A month after development started, the law office of Shea and Gardner marked a rent at 901 New York Avenue for of space. Boston Properties currently said the conveyance date for the structure was September 2004. In February 2003, the law office of Powell Goldstein Frazer and Murphy marked a rent for of space (despite the fact that the media had recently detailed that it had turned down Boston Properties). At this point the structure's area was said to be on 11 stories. By September 2003, in excess of 80 percent of the structure had been rented, in spite of the fact that the conveyance date was again deferred to late 2004. In May 2004, the law office of Piper Rudnick allegedly marked a rent for of space in the structure, however the firm later settled on a rent for in a Boston Properties building situated at 505 Ninth Street NW. 

In June 2004, 901 New York Avenue NW was 75 percent rented, at a normal expense of $36 per square foot. The conveyance date was changed yet again to September 2004. The structure, notwithstanding, was in the long run conveyed in mid 2005. 

Indeed, even as the structure was being raised, it was undermined with annihilation. The development of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center left the city with not many lodgings rooms to oblige the extraordinarily extended number of guests anticipated. A conference hall "central station inn" was direly required, yet debate seethed for quite a long while over where to put the lodging. In mid-2004, the Washington Convention and Sports Authority (WCSA) dispatched an investigation of potential locales. In the fall of 2004, the WCSA ponder expressed that one of three alternatives was to catch 901 New York Avenue NW and fabricate a 1,500-room assembly hall lodging on the site. 

In June 2005, the Council of the District of Columbia casted a ballot to put the new assembly hall "home office lodging" west of ninth Street NW between L Street NW and Massachusetts Avenue NW.
