Beck 

Beck Hansen (conceived Bek David Campbell; July 8, 1970), better known by his stage name Beck, is an American artist and record maker. He rose to distinction in the mid 1990s with his trial and lo-fi style, and ended up known for making melodic collections of wide type styles. Today, he musically includes society, funk, soul, hip jump, electronic, elective shake, nation, and psychedelia. He has discharged 13 studio collections (3 of which were autonomously discharged), just as a few non-collection singles and a book of sheet music. 

Conceived in Los Angeles in 1970, Beck developed towards hip-jump and society in his youngsters and started to perform locally at cafÃ©s and clubs. He moved to New York City in 1989 and wound up engaged with the city's little and red hot enemy of society development. Coming back to Los Angeles in the mid 1990s, he cut his leap forward single "Failure," which turned into an overall hit in 1994, and discharged his first real collection, "Smooth Gold", that year. "Odelay", discharged in 1996, topped faultfinder surveys and won a few honors. He discharged the hallucinogenic "Changes" in 1998, and the funk-implanted "Midnite Vultures" in 1999. The delicate acoustic "Ocean Change" in 2002 exhibited an increasingly genuine Beck, and 2005's "Guero" came back to "Odelay"s test based generation. "The Information" in 2006 was motivated by electro-funk, hip jump, and psychedelia; 2008's "Advanced Guilt" was enlivened by '60s popular music; and 2014's society injected "Morning Phase" won Album of the Year at the 57th Grammy Awards on February 8, 2015. His thirteenth studio collection, "Hues", was discharged in October 2017 after a long creation procedure, and won honors for Best Alternative Album and Best Engineered Album at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. 

With a pop workmanship montage of melodic styles, angled and amusing verses, and postmodern courses of action consolidating tests, drum machines, live instrumentation and audio effects, Beck has been hailed by pundits and people in general all through his melodic vocation as being among the most particularly inventive performers of 2000s elective shake. Two of Beck's most well known and acclaimed chronicles are "Odelay" and "Ocean Change", the two of which were positioned on "Moving Stone" rundown of the 500 biggest collections ever. The four-time platinum craftsman has teamed up with a few craftsmen and has made a few commitments to soundtracks. 

Beck was conceived Bek David Campbell in Los Angeles, California, on July 8, 1970. His dad, Canadian arranger, author, and conductor David Campbell, took a shot at several collections and various movies. His mom, American visual craftsman Bibbe Hansen, grew up in the midst of New York's Andy Warhol Factory workmanship scene of the 1960s, where she was a Warhol whiz, however moved to California at age 17, where she met Beck's dad. Bibbe's maternal grandma was Jewish, while her dad, craftsman Al Hansen, was of Norwegian plunge and was a pioneer in the cutting edge Fluxus development. Beck has said that he was "raised observing Jewish occasions" and that he views himself as Jewish. 

Beck started life in a staying house close downtown Los Angeles. As a kid, he lived in a declining neighborhood close Hollywood Boulevard. He later reviewed, "When we left there, they were tearing out miles of houses as a group and building low-lease, monster condo obstructs." The lower-class family battled monetarily, moving to Hoover and Ninth Street, an area populated essentially by Koreans and Salvadorian evacuees. He was sent for an opportunity to live with his fatherly grandparents in Kansas, later commenting that he thought "they were somewhat worried" about his "abnormal" home life. Since his fatherly granddad was a Presbyterian serve, Beck grew up impacted by chapel music and psalms. He additionally invested energy in Europe with his maternal granddad. 

After his folks isolated when he was 10, Beck remained with his mom and sibling Channing in Los Angeles, where he was affected by the city's differing melodic offeringsÃ¢ÂÂeverything from hip jump to Latin music and his mom's specialty sceneÃ¢ÂÂall of which would later return in his work. Beck acquired his first guitar at 16 and turned into a road performer, regularly playing Lead Belly covers at Lafayette Park. Amid his adolescents, Beck found the music of Sonic Youth, Pussy Galore, and X, yet stayed uninterested in most music outside the people sort until numerous years into his vocation. The main contemporary music that made an immediate association with Beck was hip bounce, which he previously heard on Grandmaster Flash records in the mid 1980s. Experiencing childhood in a transcendently Latin region, he got himself the main white youngster at his school, and immediately figured out how to breakdance. When he was 17, Beck became interested in the wake of hearing a Mississippi John Hurt record at a companion's home, and invested hours in his room attempting to imitate Hurt's finger picking procedures. Presently, Beck investigated blues and society music further, finding Woody Guthrie and Blind Willie Johnson. 

Having a feeling that "a complete pariah", Beck dropped out of school after middle school. He later said that despite the fact that he felt school was critical, he felt hazardous there. When he connected to the new performing expressions secondary school downtown, he was rejected. His sibling took him to post-Beat jazz puts in Echo Park and Silver Lake. He hung out at the Los Angeles City College, examining records, books and old sheet music in its library. He utilized a phony I.D. to sit in on classes there, and he additionally become friends with a writing educator and his artist spouse. He worked at a string of modest occupations, including stacking trucks and working a leaf blower. 

Beck started as a people artist, exchanging between nation blues, Delta blues and increasingly conventional rustic society music in his teenagers. He started performing on city transports, frequently covering Mississippi John Hurt close by unique, at times improvisational arrangements. "I'd jump on the transport and begin playing Mississippi John Hurt with completely extemporized verses. Some alcoholic would begin shouting at me, calling me Axl Rose. So I'd begin singing about Axl Rose and the levee and transport passes and strychnine, blending the entire thing up," he later reviewed. He was additionally in a band called Youthless that facilitated Dadaist-roused freestyle occasions at city bistros. "We had Radio Shack mics and this custom made speaker and we'd draft individuals in the gathering of people to recount comic books or complete a beatbox thing, or we'd tie the entire group of onlookers up in covering tape," Beck reviewed. 

In 1989, Beck got a transport to New York City with minimal in excess of eight dollars and a guitar. He spent the late spring endeavoring to get a new line of work and a spot to live with little achievement. Beck in the end started to visit Manhattan's Lower East Side and unearthed the last part of the East Village's enemy of people scene's first wave. Beck ended up associated with a free group of acoustic musiciansÃ¢ÂÂincluding Cindy Lee Berryhill, Kirk Kelly, Paleface, and Lach, headed by Roger ManningÃ¢ÂÂwhose frayed state and unpredictability put them well outside the acoustic standard. "The entire mission was to wreck all the clichÄÅ¡s and make up some new ones," said Beck of his New York years. "Everyone knew one another. You could go up in front of an audience and state anything, and you wouldn't feel strange or feel any weight." Inspired by that opportunity and by the neighborhood verbally expressed word entertainers, Beck started to compose free-affiliated, surrealistic tunes about pizza, MTV, and working at McDonald's, transforming ordinary considerations into tunes. Beck was flat mates with Paleface, resting on his love seat and going to open mic evenings together. Overwhelmed by the possibility of another destitute New York winter, Beck came back to his home of Los Angeles in mid 1991. "I was worn out on being cool, tired of getting beat up," he later commented. "It was difficult to be in New York with no cash, no place[...] I kinda spent every one of the companions I had. Everybody on the scene became ill of me." 

Back in Los Angeles, Beck started to work at a video store in Silver Lake "doing things like arranging the sex entertainment segment". He started performing in arthouse clubs and cafÃ©s, for example, Al's Bar and Raji's. So as to keep detached gatherings of people occupied with his music, Beck would play in an unconstrained, clowning way. "I'd hit away into a Son House tune and the entire group of onlookers would talk. So perhaps out of distress or weariness, or the gathering of people's fatigue, I'd make up these ludicrous melodies just to check whether individuals were tuning in," he later commented. For all intents and purposes an obscure to general society and a conundrum to the individuals who met him, Beck would jump in front of an audience between acts in nearby clubs and play "peculiar people melodies", joined by "what could best be depicted as execution craftsmanship" while at times wearing a "Star Wars" stormtrooper cover. Beck met somebody who offered to help record demos in his front room, and he started to pass tape tapes around. 

In the end, Beck increased key sponsors in Margaret Mittleman, the West Coast's executive of ability acquisitions for BMG Music Publishing, and the accomplices behind free record mark Bong Load Custom Records: Tom Rothrock, Rob Schnapf and Brad Lambert. Schnapf saw Beck perform at Jabberjaw and felt he would suit their little endeavor. Beck communicated a free enthusiasm for hip jump, and Rothrock acquainted him with Carl Stephenson, a record maker for Rap-A-Lot Records. In 1992, Beck visited Stephenson's home to team up. The resultÃ¢ÂÂthe slide-inspecting hip jump track "Loser"Ã¢ÂÂwas an irregular investigation that Beck put aside, returning to his people tunes, making his home tapes, for example, "Brilliant Feelings", and discharging a few free singles. 

By 1993, Beck was living in a rodent invaded shed almost a Los Angeles rear way with minimal expenditure. Bong Load issued "Washout" as a solitary in March 1993 on 12" vinyl with just 500 duplicates squeezed. Beck felt that "Failure" was unremarkable, and just consented to its discharge at Rothrock's request. "Failure" suddenly gotten radio airplay, beginning in Los Angeles, where school radio station KXLU was the first to play it, and later on Santa Monica College radio station KCRW, where radio host Chris Douridas played the tune on "Morning Becomes Eclectic", the station's leader music program. "I called the record mark that day and requested to have Beck play live reporting in real time," Douridas said. "He came in that Friday, rapped to a tape of "Failure" and did his melody 'MTV Makes Me Want to Smoke Crack.'" That night, Beck performed at the Los Angeles club Cafe Troy to a pressed group of onlookers and headhunters from real names. The tune at that point spread to Seattle through KNDD, and KROQ-FM started playing the melody on a practically hourly premise. As Bong Load attempted to squeeze more duplicates of "Failure", Beck was plagued with offers to sign with real names. Amid the offering war in November, Beck went through a few days in Olympia, Washington, recording material with Calvin Johnson of Beat Happening, which would later observe discharge the next year on Johnson's K Records as "One Foot in the Grave". 

A wild offering war followed, with Geffen Records A&R executive Mark Kates marking Beck in December 1993 in spite of exceptional challenge from Warner Bros. what's more, Capitol. Beck's non-selective contract with Geffen permitted him an irregular measure of imaginative opportunity, with Beck staying allowed to discharge material through such little, free marks as Flipside, which issued the rambling, 25-track accumulation of pre-"Failure" chronicles titled "Stereopathetic Soulmanure" on February 22 the next year. When Beck discharged his first collection for Geffen, the low-spending plan, type mixing "Smooth Gold" on March 1, "Washout" was at that point in the main 40 and its video in MTV's Buzz Bin. "Washout" immediately climbed the diagrams in the U.S., achieving a pinnacle of number ten on the "Bulletin" Hot 100 singles graph and fixing the Modern Rock Tracks outline. The melody likewise graphed in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and all through Europe. Beck's recently discovered position of consideration prompted his portrayal as the "Lord of Slackers", as the media named him the focal point of the new purported "loafer" development. Faultfinders, feeling it the basic follow-up to Radiohead's "Creep", discovered vacantness in the verses of "Failure" unequivocally connected with Generation X, in spite of the fact that Beck himself firmly challenged his situation as the essence of the "loafer" age: "Bum my "rear end". That is to say, I "never" had any slack. I was working a $4-an-hour work endeavoring to remain alive. That good-for-nothing stuff is for individuals who have room schedule-wise to be discouraged about everything." 

Feeling just as he were "continually endeavoring to substantiate myself", Beck endured a reaction, with doubters reprimanding him as a liberal phony and the most recent promoting opportunity. In the mid year of 1994, Beck was battling and a large number of his kindred performers thought he had lost his direction. Joined with the melody's uncontrollably well known music video and the world visit, Beck responded trusting the consideration couldn't last, bringing about a status as a "one-hit wonder". At different shows, swarms were blessed to receive twenty minutes of reggae or Miles Davis or jazz-punk emphasess of "Failure". At one-day celebrations in California, he encircle himself with an artnoise combo. The drummer set flame to his cymbals; the lead guitarist "played" his guitar with the strings looked towards his body; and Beck changed the words to "Failure" so no one could chime in. "I can't reveal to you how often I was taking a gander at appearances that were glancing back at me with complete bewildermentÃ¢ÂÂor simply pointing and shaking their heads and laughingÃ¢ÂÂwhile performing amid that period," he later reviewed. In spite of this, Beck picked up the regard of his companions, for example, Tom Petty and Johnny Cash, and made a whole rush of groups resolved to recover the "Smooth Gold" sound. Feeling his past discharges were only accumulations of demos recorded through the span of quite a while, Beck wanted to enter the studio and record a collection in a nonstop straight manner, which moved toward becoming "Odelay". 

Beck mixes nation, blues, rap, jazz and shake on "Odelay", the aftereffect of a year and half of hot "cutting, gluing, layering, naming, and, obviously, inspecting". Every day, the artists began starting with no outside help, regularly chipping away at melodies for 16 hours in a row. "Odelay"<NOWIKI></NOWIKI>'s origination lies in an incomplete studio collection Beck initially set out on following the accomplishment of "Failure", chronicling the troublesome time he encountered: "There was a cycle of everybody biting the dust around me," he reviewed later. He was continually recording, and in the long run set up together a collection of grave, coordinated people tunes; one that, maybe, "could have been a business blockbuster alongside comparably themed work by Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and Nirvana". Rather, Beck culled one melody from itÃ¢ÂÂthe "Odelay" collection closer "Ramshackle"Ã¢ÂÂand retired the rest ("Brother" and "Credit to you" were anyway later discharged as B-Sides). Beck was acquainted with the Dust Brothers, makers of the Beastie Boys' collection "Paul's Boutique", whose reorder, test overwhelming generation fit Beck's vision of a progressively fun, available collection. After a record official clarified that "Odelay" would be an "immense oversight", he spent numerous months thinking "that I'd blown it until the end of time". 

"Odelay" was discharged on June 18, 1996, to business achievement and basic praise. The record delivered a few hit singles, including "Where It's At", "Fiends Haircut", and "The New Pollution", and was designated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1997, winning a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album just as a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for "Where It's At". Amid one occupied week in January 1997, he handled his Grammy designations, showed up on "Saturday Night Live" and "Howard Stern", and completed a very late jog on "The Rosie O'Donnell Show". The joined buzz gave "Odelay" an unexpected burst of energy, prompting an extended fan base and extra presentation. Beck delighted in at the same time, similar to a few administrators at Geffen, was confused by the accomplishment of "Odelay". He would regularly get perceived openly, which made him feel peculiar. "It's simply odd. It doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel normal to me. I don't think I was made for that. I was never great at that," he later told Pitchfork. "Odelay" sold two million duplicates and put "one-hit wonder" reactions to rest. Amid this time, he contributed the tune "Deadweight" to the soundtrack of the film "A Life Less Ordinary" (1997). 

Having not been in an appropriate studio since "Deadweight", Beck felt restless to "go in and simply do some stuff genuine brisk", and gathered a few tunes he had for quite a long time. Beck and his bandmates pounded out fourteen melodies in fourteen days, albeit only twelve made it onto the collection, 1998's "Changes". Beck settled on Nigel Godrich, maker for Radiohead's "alright Computer" the earlier year, to be behind the sheets for the task. Godrich was leaving the United States for England in a brief timeframe, which prompted the collection's fast creation scheduleÃ¢ÂÂ"No thinking back, no doctoring anything". The general purpose of the record was to catch the execution of the performers live, a strange long ways from the reorder stylish of "Odelay". Despite the fact that the collection was initially slated for discharge by Bong Load Records, Geffen mediated and issued the record against Beck's desires. The craftsman at that point looked to void his agreements with both record names, and thus the names sued him for rupture of agreement. The suit continued for quite a long time and it stays hazy right up 'til the present time on the off chance that it has ever been totally settled. Beck was later granted Best Alternative Music Performance for "Transformations" at the 42nd Grammy Awards. 

"Midnite Vultures", Beck's next studio exertion, was initially recorded as a twofold collection, and in excess of 25 almost finished melodies were abandoned. In the studio, Beck and makers contemplated contemporary hip bounce and R&B, explicitly R. Kelly, so as to grasp and join those impacts in the manner Al Green and Stax records had done in earlier decades. In July 1998, a center gathering started to amass at Beck's Pasadena home: bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen, keyboardist Roger Joseph Manning Jr., and maker engineers Mickey Petralia and Tony Hoffer. Many session players went through, including Beck's dad, David Campbell, who played viola and orchestrated a portion of the strings. The performers held shared suppers and off-road bicycle rides on dusty trails close-by, yet stayed concentrated on Beck's guidelines: to make an up-rhythm collection that would be enjoyable to play on visit after a long time after night. "I had such a significant number of things going on", said Beck of the chronicle procedure. "I had several rooms of PCs snared, I was doing B sides for Japan, I was customizing beats in a single room and somebody would prepare supper in the other room." In November 1999, Geffen discharged the eagerly awaited "Midnite Vultures", which pulled in perplexity: "fans and faultfinders misguidedly stressed whether it was not kidding or a goof," and subsequently, "The New York Times" composed that the collection "never won the crowd it merited". The record was upheld by a broad world visit. For Beck, it was an arrival to the high-vitality exhibitions that had been his trademark as far back as Lollapalooza. The live stage set incorporated a red bed that plunged from the roof for the melody "Debra", and the visiting band was supplemented by a metal area. "Midnite Vultures" was selected for Best Album at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. 

In 2000, Beck and his fiancÄÅ¡e, beautician Leigh Limon, finished their nine-year relationship. Beck slipped by into a time of despairing and thoughtfulness, amid which he composed the hopeless, acoustic-put together tracks later found with respect to "Ocean Change". Beck sat on the tunes, not having any desire to discuss his own life; he later said that he needed to concentrate on music and "not by any means strew my things over the open anteroom". In the long run, in any case, he chose the melodies addressed a typical encounter (a relationship separation), and that it would not appear to be liberal to record them. In 2001, Beck floated back to the tunes and called maker Nigel Godrich. 

Retailers at first anticipated that the collection would not get much radio help, however they additionally trusted that Beck's nonconformist notoriety and basic recognition, notwithstanding the likelihood of numerous Grammy designations, may balance "Ocean Change's" noncommercial sound. "Ocean Change", issued by Geffen in September 2002, was in any case a business hit and basic sweetheart, with "Moving Stone" loving it as "the best collection Beck has ever constructed, [...] a flawless collection of truth and light from the finish of adoration. This is his "Blood on the Tracks"." The collection was later recorded by the magazine as a standout amongst the best records of the decade and ever, and it likewise put second on the year's Pazz and Jop Critics Poll. "Ocean Change" yielded a serene, theater-based acoustic visit, just as a bigger visit with The Flaming Lips as Beck's opening and support band. Beck was perky and lively, now and then tossing in fronts of The Rolling Stones, Big Star, The Zombies and The Velvet Underground. 

Following the arrival of "Ocean Change", Beck felt more current structures were portrays for something more advanced a similar way, and composed about 35 additional tunes in the coming months, keeping demos of them on tapes in a bag. Amid his performance visit, the tapes were left behind the stage amid a stop in Washington, D.C., and Beck was never ready to recoup them. It was debilitating to the performer, who felt the two years of songwriting spoke to something all the more in fact complex. Accordingly, Beck enjoyed a reprieve and composed no unique organizations in 2003. Feeling as if it may take him some time to "return to that [songwriting] domain", he entered the studio with Dust Brothers to finish a venture that dated back to "Odelay". About portion of the melodies had existed since the 1990s. 

"Guero", Beck's eighth studio collection, was recorded over the range of nine months amid which a few huge occasions happened in his life: his sweetheart, Marissa Ribisi, ended up pregnant; they were hitched; their child, Cosimo, was conceived; and they moved out of Silver Lake. The joint effort with the Dust Brothers, his second, was striking for their utilization of cutting edge measures to accomplish a lo-fi sound. For instance, subsequent to recording a "sonically impeccable" variant of a tune at one of the most delightful chronicle studios in Hollywood, the Dust Brothers handled it in an Echoplex to make a dirty, reverb-overwhelming sound: "We did this cutting edge recording and ran it through a transistor radio. It sounded excessively great, that was the issue." Initially due to be discharged in October 2004, "Guero" confronted delays and did not turn out till March 2005, however unmastered duplicates of the tracks surfaced online in January. 

"Guero" appeared at number two on the "Bulletin" 200, selling 162,000 duplicates, an unequaled deals high. Lead single "E-Pro" crested at number one at Modern Rock radio, making it his first diagram topper since "Failure". Beck, enlivened by the Nintendocore remix scene and feeling an association with its lo-fi, home-recording technique, worked together with craftsmen 8-Bit and Paza on "Damnation Yes", an EP issued in February 2005. In December 2005, Geffen likewise issued "Guerolito", a completely modified variant of "Guero" highlighting remixes by the Beastie Boys' Ad-Rock, the Dust Brothers' John King and Scottish electronic couple Boards of Canada. "Guerolito" joins remixes recently heard as B-sides and new forms of collection tracks to make a track-by-track reconfiguration of the collection. Likewise discharged in 2005 was "A Brief Overview", a 12-track special just "History of Beck" assemblage CD sampler that highlighted a blend of more established and more up to date Beck tracks. 

"The Information", Beck's ninth studio collection, started generation around a similar time as "Guero", in 2003. Working with maker Nigel Godrich, Beck constructed a studio in his greenhouse, where they composed a significant number of the tracks. "The thought was to get individuals in a room together account live, hitting terrible notes and shouting," said Beck, including that the collection is best depicted as "contemplative hip bounce". Beck depicted the account procedure as "excruciating", noticing that he altered down melodies always and he maybe recorded the collection multiple times. For the discharge, Beck was took into consideration the first run through to satisfy a long-running wish for a whimsical rollout: he made low-spending recordings to go with every tune, bundled the CD with sheets of stickers so purchasers could alter the spread, and spilled tracks and recordings on his site a long time in front of the collection's discharge. Computerized download discharges naturally downloaded the tune's extra video for each single deal, and physical duplicates came packaged with an extra DVD highlighting fifteen recordings. 

In 2007, Beck discharged the single "Timebomb", which was designated for a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. For his next studio exertion, his tenth, Beck tapped Danger Mouse to create, and the two initially met in December 2007 to record. The pair thumped out two tracks in two days, yet the thought that the collection would be done in an auspicious manner before long dissipated. Beck had realized Danger Mouse coolly previously, the same number of his previous artists wound up working with Danger Mouse's side task, Gnarls Barkley. In any case, the performers were astounded at how well they got along. Following the overwhelming account plan, Beck was depleted, calling it "the most serious work I've at any point done on anything", relating that he "did no less than 10 weeks with no days off, until four or five toward the beginning of the day consistently." Beck's unique vision was a short 10-track burst with two-minute tunes, yet the melodies step by step developed as he fit 'two years of songwriting into more than two months." "Present day Guilt" (2008) was "loaded with helter-skelter rhythms and left-field breakdowns, with a general 1960s vibe." 

"Current Guilt" was the last discharge in Beck's agreement with Geffen Records. Beck, at that point 38, had held the agreement since his mid 20s. Discharged from his mark contract and going autonomous, Beck started working all the more intensely all alone seven-year-old name, which experienced an assortment of names. His attention on littler, progressively impetuous tasks, Beck worked two jobs as a maker, working with craftsmen, for example, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Thurston Moore and Stephen Malkmus. Beck worked for five or six days seven days at the little studio on his property in Malibu, and established Record Club, a task whereby a whole great albumÃ¢ÂÂby The Velvet Underground, Leonard Cohen, INXS, YanniÃ¢ÂÂwould be canvassed by another vocalist in the range of a solitary day. Beck gave four melodies to the film "Scott Pilgrim versus the World" (2010), each ascribed to the title character's anecdotal band, Sex Bob-Omb. Beck likewise teamed up with Philip Glass, Jack White, Tobacco of Black Moth Super Rainbow, Jamie Lidell, Seu Jorge, Childish Gambino, and The Lonely Island. 

"Melody Reader", a venture Beck discharged in December 2012, is 20 tunes displayed just as sheet music, in the expectations that venturesome performers will record their own adaptations. The possibility of "Melody Reader" came about almost fifteen years earlier, not long after the arrival of "Odelay". At the point when sent a book of deciphered sheet music for that collection, Beck chose to play through it and became intrigued by the world before recorded sound. He expected to keep the courses of action as open as could reasonably be expected, to re-make the effortlessness of the principles, and ended up distracted with making just pieces that could fit inside the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck started playing uncommon "Melody Reader" shows with an assortment of visitors and declared he was taking a shot at a record of "Tune Reader" material with different performers just as potentially an accumulation of fan renditions. 

In the late spring of 2013, Beck was accounted for to take a shot at two new studio collections: one a progressively independent acoustic circle in the vein of "One Foot in the Grave" and another depicted as an "appropriate development" to "Present day Guilt". Beck expected to discharge the two collections autonomously, and discharged two independent singles through the span of the mid year: the electro song "Defriended" and the melody substantial "I Won't Be Long". A third single, "Gimme", showed up on September 17. 

In October 2013, Beck marked to Capitol Records. On January 20, 2014, Beck discharged the track "Blue Moon", which was to be the lead single for his twelfth studio collection, "Morning Phase". On February 4, second single "Waking Light" was discharged, only preceding the official arrival of "Morning Phase" on February 21, 2014. For the chronicle of the collection, Beck rejoined with huge numbers of similar artists with whom he had chipped away at the widely praised 2002 collection "Ocean Change", and likely along these lines, it has been noticed that the two collections have a comparative classification. 

On February 8, 2015, at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, "Morning Phase" won three Grammys: Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical; Best Rock Album; and Album of the Year. After getting the Album of the Year grant, the collection beat out Pharrell Williams' "G I R L", BeyoncÄÅ¡'s self-titled collection, Sam Smith's "In the Lonely Hour", and Ed Sheeran's "x". 

In the time in the wake of "Morning Phase's" discharge and general basic achievement, Beck referenced that he had been chipping away at another collection at around a similar time, however that the new collection would be even more a pop record. Not long after "Morning Phase's" Grammy wins, on June 15, 2015, Beck discharged the primary single titled "Dreams" off this up and coming thirteenth studio collection. "I was truly attempting to make something that would be great to play live," he said soon after its discharge. In any case, no further word was gotten notification from Beck relating to the arrival of the collection. On June 2, 2016, very nearly a year after the underlying arrival of "Dreams," Beck discharged another single titled "Amazing", alongside a verse video of the melody and a declaration that his still untitled collection would be discharged on October 21, 2016. In September 2016, the collection was postponed with no new discharge date declared and, on September 24, Beck said he didn't know "when it's turning out. It's most likely in a couple of months." once more, be that as it may, no further singles were discharged and no new discharge date was planned for the collection. 

On September 8, 2017, Beck discharged the single "Dear Life," which was immediately caught up with the official arrival of "Up All Night" on September 18. "Hues" was discharged on October 13, 2017. It was recorded at co-official maker Greg Kurstin's Los Angeles studio, with Beck and Kurstin playing almost every instrument themselves. The exploratory pop-combined record got commonly positive surveys from pundits. On July 18, 2018, Beck played out the title track "Hues", and the primary single "Amazing" on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert". 

In 1999, Beck added to a tribute collection for Bruce Haack and Esther Nelson and their mark Dimension 5 Records. The collection, Dimension Mix, discharged in 2005, was an advantage for Cure Autism Now that was delivered by Ross Harris, an early colleague who planned the work of art for "Smooth Gold". 

On June 20, 2009, Beck reported that he was beginning a trial called Record Club, in which he and different artists would record spread variants of whole collections in a single day. The primary collection secured by Beck's Record Club was "The Velvet Underground and Nico". Beginning on June 18, the club started posting fronts of melodies from the collection on Thursday nighttimes, each with its own video. On September 4, 2009, Beck declared the second Record Club collection, "Melodies of Leonard Cohen". Benefactors included MGMT, Devendra Banhart, Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother and Binki Shapiro of Little Joy. In the third Record Club adventure, Wilco, Feist, Jamie Lidell and James Gadson joined Beck to cover Skip Spence's "Paddle". The principal tune, "Little Hands", was posted on Beck's site on November 12, 2009. The Record Club has since secured collections by INXS and Yanni. 

On June 19, 2009, Beck reported Planned Obsolescence, a week by week DJ set up together by Beck or visitor DJs. Before long, on July 7, Beck reported that his site would highlight "expanded casual discussions with artists, specialists, producers, and different people" in a segment called Irrelevant Topics.
