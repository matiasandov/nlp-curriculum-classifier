SECR N1 class 

The SECR N1 class was a sort of 3-chamber 2-6-0 ('investor') steam train structured by Richard Maunsell for blended traffic obligations, at first on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), and later worked for the Southern Railway (SR). The N1 was an improvement of the essential standards built up by the Great Western Railway's (GWR) Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) George Jackson Churchward and by Maunsell's past NÃ¢Â class structure. 

The N1 model was the aftereffect of changes made to NÃ¢Â class No.Ã¢Â 822 amid development in 1922. The train wound up operational in 1923 and utilized parts compatible with other Maunsell train classes. The model N1 was the main individual from the class developed before the SECR turned out to be a piece of the Southern Railway at the Grouping in 1923, and included a variation of the Gresley conjugated valve gear structured by Harold Holcroft. The class set the point of reference for the Southern Railway's resulting 3-chamber plans. 

The N1s contrasted positively and the NÃ¢Â class, despite the fact that the sort indicated little improvement in execution. A greater amount of the class were constructed when it turned out to be certain that the sort's littler barrels gave more prominent course accessibility. An aggregate of six motors were assembled. The N1Ã¢Â class was essentially utilized on the Eastern segment of the Southern Railway organize, and utilized by the Southern Region of British Railways (BR) from 1948. The N1s gave important administration until they were pulled back in 1962. None were protected. 

Richard Maunsell's NÃ¢Â class blended traffic 2-6-0 model for the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) was finished in 1917. It demonstrated a checked improvement in execution over his antecedent Harry Wainwright's 0-6-0 and 4-4-0 structures when tried on cargo and neighborhood traveler trains. The accomplishment of the model urged the SECR the board to arrange a group of 15 out of 1919 after government limitations controlling train generation amid the First World War were loose. Ashford train works was at that point focused on embraced conceded fix work be that as it may, which incidentally impeded development of new trains. This brought about the steady culmination of the 1919 NÃ¢Â class request as works limit allowed somewhere in the range of 1920 and 1923. 

Operational involvement with the NÃ¢Â class model showed that it was equipped for adapting to peacetime traveler and cargo traffic on the mainline among London and Ramsgate, however Maunsell foreseen an expansion in rush hour gridlock that would require an all the more dominant train fit for pulling longer trains. The utilization of bigger motors was forestalled by low allowed hub loadings on parts of the SECR arrange, brought about by economies in track development by utilizing rock shoreline stones as track stabilizer; this material neglected to hold the track set up when under strain and couldn't bolster substantial trains. Meanwhile Maunsell settled after delivering a 3-barrel form of the NÃ¢Â class 2-6-0, which gave the chance to test a variation of the Gresley conjugated valve gear created by his colleague, Harold Holcroft. 

Maunsell and Holcroft finished designs for another 3-barrel train in 1919. Assigned N1, the new plan was an endeavor to build the operational adaptability and intensity of the SECR 2-6-0 without generously expanding hub stacking. Holcroft's past work as an architect required with the GWR's 4300Ã¢Â class implied that the N1 utilized the equivalent Churchward includes as the NÃ¢Â class to help institutionalization and the production of parts. These incorporated the utilization of long-travel valves with the expectation of complimentary running at speed, right-hand drive in the taxi and driving wheels. The maintenance of the 2-6-0 wheel course of action implied adequate settlement for the NÃ¢Â class' decreased kettle with Belpaire firebox. Likewise with the NÃ¢Â class, detail structure on the N1 was left to another of Maunsell's collaborators, James Clayton, who conveyed practical Midland Railway impacts to the plan: the stacking measure well disposed state of the taxi, the delicate and the vast distance across smokebox. The smokebox housed a substantial superheater, controller valve and snifting (hostile to vacuum) valves. The N1 additionally held Walschaerts valve gear on both outside chambers. 

The primary plan contrasts with the NÃ¢Â class incorporated the taxi front, exhaust courses of action, and the expansion of an additional (inside) chamber between the casings to drive the middle driving hub. Clayton had reconsidered the design of the taxi front scene plates (little windows on the facade of the taxi) to improve forward perceivability. This consolidated two huge single sheets of glass either side of the evaporator rather than the four littler windows utilized on the NÃ¢Â class. Within barrel was to be impelled by Holcroft's plan of conjugated valve gear, which comprised of mechanical connections fitted to the two arrangements of outside Walschaerts gear, killing the requirement for a different arrangement of valve gear between the edges to work within chamber. The outcome would be a decrease in weight and the measure of mechanical gear in this difficult to reach some portion of the train. 

HolcroftÃ¢ÂÂs valve gear configuration was likewise an endeavor to address the issues related with GresleyÃ¢ÂÂs conjugated valve gear, which was inclined to varieties in valve occasions brought about by warmth extension of the valve shafts inside the cylinders. The structure used the movement of the outside valve poles (the bars transmitting the movement of the driving axles to the valves, for example, the mix switch) rather, despite the fact that the limited space between the back of the outside chambers and the front driving wheels made it difficult to find the shaking arms controlling the conjugating component in the region. HolcroftÃ¢ÂÂs arrangement was to move the system to a situation over the horse truck and in front of the chambers and connection it to the outside valve bars with augmentation switches, which must be suited inside the exacting SECR stacking check resiliences. This required another structure of chamber square whereby the outside steam chests were set inwards and the extent of the barrels diminished to stroke and width. The sides of the outside barrels subsequently inclined inwards towards the top in a setup like GWR 2-chamber trains, in this manner giving abundant space in which to suit the augmentation switches. Within barrel and conjugation get together were set at a grade of 1 out of 8 to clear the front horse truck, departing space for a third arrangement of free Walschaerts valve gear between the edges ought to HolcroftÃ¢ÂÂs conjugation instrument demonstrate temperamental in administration. 

Another issue concerned the quality of the train outlines around the chambers. Taking motivation from the 3-barrel trains planned by Vincent Raven for the North Eastern Railway, Holcroft recommended that every one of the three chambers and related steam entries ought to be thrown in a solitary square, with rectangular gaps slice into the edges to empower the outside chambers to extend through them. Be that as it may, the SECRÃ¢ÂÂs set up routine with regards to utilizing outside steam chests on trains with outside chambers counteracted this, and the plan group depended on cutting a hole in the casings to suit the outside barrels, which were then verified set up with a shot join plate. Creation impediments at the Ashford works foundry likewise forestalled the assembling of a solitary throwing that joined each of the three barrels. This implied the barrel castings were part into two segments, with the left and inside chambers shaping a solitary unit that would be catapulted onto a different right-hand chamber throwing. HolcroftÃ¢ÂÂs new barrel square plan additionally joined a different seat throwing, a setup that permitted the N1 chamber examples to be utilized with any breadth of smokebox, making a standard part with potential applications on future train structures. 

The development of the model at Ashford railroad works was affirmed by the SECR the board to begin in 1919. Be that as it may, Ashford works was intensely occupied with handling a build-up of fix and support work brought about by government limitations amid the First World War with minimal extra limit with respect to new development ventures, especially when endorsement for the development of the N1 model concurred with a need request for 15 2-chamber NÃ¢Â class trains. In outcome, the works accumulation implied that just 12 NÃ¢Â class trains were finished between June 1920 and October 1922. 

Seeing minimal indication of an expansion underway limit at Ashford, Maunsell chose to develop the model N1 train from parts proposed for use on the following NÃ¢Â class train in the group, No.Ã¢Â 822. The outside barrels were traded for the N1 type, which had been machined at the GWR's Swindon railroad works following throwing at Ashford to stimulate development once the NÃ¢Â class outlines were altered to acknowledge the new plan of chamber square. This created a strong frame equipped for supporting the two arrangements of Walschaerts and the Holcroft conjugated valve gear. The last was given oil weapon grease focuses to ease support. 

A distinctive element of the train was the high-set NÃ¢Â class evaporator, which was pitched over the edges to suit within chamber gathering, conceivably uncovering the conjugation system to the components. To avert consumption, Maunsell fused a vertical metal spread over the front support bar to secure within barrel and valve gear get together, the fundamental visual distinction from the NÃ¢Â class. Maunsell and Holcroft foreseen that the standard NÃ¢Â class stack would gag the fumes impact created by the three chambers. To alleviate this, a more extensive width blastpipe was thrown for the train and another smokebox created to oblige a wide-measurement cast stack. The remainder of the development procedure pursued the 1919 N1 particular, and the last three individuals from the request for 15 NÃ¢Â class trains were worked as planned. The N1 model was finished in December 1922 and joined to a standard Maunsell level sided Ashford NÃ¢Â class delicate. It entered administration on 24 March 1923 and the evaporator weight was decreased from to for No.Ã¢Â 822's fuel utilization to be contrasted and that of the 2-chamber NÃ¢Â class amid preliminaries. 

The finish of No.Ã¢Â 822 matched with the ingestion of the SECR into the recently made Southern Railway in the 1923 Grouping. Maunsell was designated the CME of the new organization and left upon an extraordinarily extended program of armada institutionalization to supplant the acquired "pre-Grouping" plans. In 1924, No.Ã¢Â 822 took part in a progression of preliminaries to look at the execution of the N, LSWRÃÂ S15 and LB&SCRÃÂ K classes when pulling cargo trains of 65 stacked wagons between and . Notwithstanding accomplishing the most minimal coal utilization per mile of the considerable number of plans tried, the N1 model cost more to keep up and showed poor steaming characteristics that influenced timekeeping. After the preliminaries, No.Ã¢Â 822 remained the sole N1 until 1929, when the Southern Railway requested a clump of five trains (Nos. A876Ã¢ÂÂA880). The goal was to expand the accessibility of the class to supplement the recently presented U1Ã¢Â class traveler trains on check confined courses. 

The cluster was developed at Ashford works and consolidated a few refinements dependent on operational involvement with No.Ã¢Â 822 and were given boilers set at . The other change was the end of the Holcroft valve gear as a result of the trouble experienced in getting reasonable extra parts for the model. The Southern Railway had additionally updated the changeless path on a significant number of the previous SECR courses by 1929, expelling huge numbers of the weight confinements that propelled the utilization of the Holcroft gear in any case. Maunsell was along these lines allowed to utilize three separate arrangements of Walschaerts valve gear driven by the inside driving haggles wrench hub, a framework that was simpler to keep up because of the wide accessibility of parts. 

The new trains were finished among March and November 1930. They were discernibly not the same as the model in light of the fact that the Holcroft conjugation instrument over the outside chambers was precluded, in spite of the fact that the section front and calculated profile of the outside barrels was held. Different varieties incorporated a lot of strides underneath the front cushion shaft, inversion to the NÃ¢Â class cast smokestack structure and an amended vault that consolidated the controller to ease access amid routine support. When complete, Nos. ÃÂ A876Ã¢ÂÂA880 were connected to level sided tenders to increment operational range over the Southern Railway's more extended Eastern segment courses. No further N1 trains were requested after the culmination of No.ÃÂ A880 as the precisely comparable U1Ã¢Â class was equipped for undertaking a more extensive scope of assignments. Albeit proposed for middle of the road traveler work, the last's driving wheels were of little impediment when utilized on slower cargo obligations. 

The N1Ã¢Â class model was at first based at Bricklayers Arms shed for tests on administrations over the Eastern segment. No.Ã¢Â 822 turned into a well-known sight on cargo operations between the Hither Green marshaling yard and on traveler prepares between and , as expanded train lengths on these obligations had exhausted the ex-SECR 4-4-0 and 0-6-0 plans. This portion likewise gave a chance to looking at execution against the 2-chamber NÃ¢Â class. The tests were finished by December 1923 and No.Ã¢Â 822 was moved to Ashford shed and utilized on traveler administrations to Charing Cross. In 1925, No.Ã¢Â 822 was re-allotted to Bricklayers Arms shed from where it was utilized on the measure limited TonbridgeÃ¢ÂÂHastings line out of the blue. No. ÃÂ 822 demonstrated perfect for this line however was again re-designated to for preliminaries over the troublesome undulating course to in 1928. 

In spite of the high upkeep costs and steaming challenges uncovered amid the 1924 cargo preliminaries, the N1 model looked at positively against the NÃ¢Â class, enabling the Southern Railway's administration to arrange the last five trains in 1929. Nos.ÃÂ A876Ã¢ÂÂA880 were at first designated to the Central area shed at , from where they were normally utilized on through communicates from the LMS between and Brighton and administrations to Hastings and . Three of the class were moved to Tonbridge shed in 1931 to work over the Hastings line while the other three stayed at New Cross. The class was re-designated in 1935 with three put together at Eastbourne with respect to the Central area to pull through trains to the GWR and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). By 1939 the class was isolated between New Cross, Stewarts Lane and Tonbridge sheds. 

Likewise with the previous NÃ¢Â class, the N1s were fit for pulling substantial burdens at moderate speeds, a valuable property that was abused during the Time World War. They were for the most part utilized on cargo prepares on both Central and Eastern segments in spite of the fact that No.Ã¢Â 1822 was recorded pulling a 17Ã¢ÂÂcarriage troop uncommon over the Redhill to Reading line in April 1942. The whole class worked in the Hastings territory amid the development to Operation Overlord in 1944. On 3 May, No.Ã¢Â 1878 was focused by a German contender close yet was flawless. The whole class came into British Railways' possession in 1948 and was utilized on the Southern Region. 

As an improvement of the NÃ¢Â class, the N1Ã¢Â class spoke to the subsequent stage forward for the British 2-6-0 idea, making a fit workhorse similarly skilled at pulling traveler and cargo traffic. The model demonstrated prudent in administration as it utilized 10Ã¢Â percent less coal than the NÃ¢Â class, yet utilized 11Ã¢Â percent more water. Be that as it may, the N1 configuration demonstrated prepared to do quick speeds; No.Ã¢Â 822 came to amid preliminaries between Charing Cross and Tonbridge in 1923. When run-in, No.Ã¢Â 822 ended up well known among its ordinary groups as they supported the manner in which the three chambers adjusted cyclic powers on the driving pivot. This brought about improved riding qualities on the footplate at low speeds while lessening mechanical wear and the impact of hammerblow on the track. The Holcroft valve gear additionally implied that No.Ã¢Â 822 was a nearly light train that could be utilized on weight-limited courses. 

Albeit fruitful at beating the issues related with the Gresley conjugated valve gear, the Holcroft variation utilized on No.Ã¢Â 822 endured under a poor support routine brought about by the trouble and cost of creating non-standard extra parts at Ashford works. The principle issues related with the Holcroft gear included insufficient oil of the moving parts and the whipping of the conjugation switches interfacing within barrel to the outside movement while running at high speeds, which made uneven steam appropriation the chambers. In this regard, the N1 model offered little favorable position over the less difficult 2-barrel Ns and the train was infrequently utilized on long-remove keeps running on the Western area. Scarcely any changes were made to the model before 1929, despite the fact that kettle weight was expanded to the full working weight in June 1925. 

The presentation of Nos.ÃÂ A876Ã¢ÂÂA880 into administration permitted No.ÃÂ A822 to be pulled back for modifying with three separate arrangements of Walschaerts valve gear in August 1931. Different changes included moving the controller valve from the smokebox to another NÃ¢Â class-type vault to ease access amid routine support and the expansion of a front stride behind the bufferbeam. In spite of the chance to move up to the delicate connected to the new class individuals, No.ÃÂ A822 held its littler limit level sided Ashford delicate. The consequence of the different changes was a heavier train, despite the fact that it now profited by overhauled track on the Eastern area and the trade of institutionalized parts that diminished the time expected to finish fixes. The modified train rose up out of Ashford fills in as No.Ã¢Â 1822 in October 1931. Despite the fact that the N1s showed minimal generally speaking improvement over the NÃ¢Â class, they demonstrated perfect for the check limited Hastings course, where their smaller profile enabled them to work through thin scaffolds and burrows, and their capacity empowered them to pull heavier trains than the dominating ex-SECR 4-4-0 and 0-6-0s. 

The last adjustment of the class embraced by Maunsell was the steady presentation of little smoke redirector plates from 1934. These were fitted to improve driver perceivability because of smoke avoidance tests made on the King Arthur class somewhere in the range of 1926 and 1927. Maunsell resigned from the Southern Railway in 1937 and his substitution was Oliver Bulleid. Notwithstanding making different adjustments to the steam circuit on other Maunsell classes, Bulleid saw no motivation to make such extreme changes to the N1Ã¢Â class. Accordingly, the last arrangement of alterations made under Southern Railway possession was made after the Second World War and incorporated the expulsion of unnecessary smokebox-mounted enemy of vacuum snifting valves and the substitution of the wide-distance across N1 stack with the U1 type to improve draughting on the model; the standard NÃ¢Â class smokestacks of the other five were additionally supplanted. The class was well-utilized by British Railways over both Central and Eastern areas somewhere in the range of 1948 and 1962 and advocated the fitting of Automatic Warning System (AWS) hardware in 1959 close by the NÃ¢Â class. 

Reasonable work for the class started to decay under British Railways proprietorship after the enlarging of extensions and passages on the Hastings line, which empowered Bulleid's incredible Q1Ã¢Â class 0-6-0 to be utilized on cargo prepares among Hastings and Tonbridge. Following the fulfillment of the Kent Coast zap in 1959, the class was congregated at Tonbridge shed nearby individuals from the U1Ã¢Â class to pull neighborhood benefits all through the Central segment. The decrease of work over the Brighton primary line and the pervasiveness of the N class hastened another move to Stewarts Lane shed in London. Be that as it may, with outstanding work being allotted to Bulleid's "Light Pacifics", the class was pulled back from administration in November 1962. 

No.Ã¢Â 822 was finished before Grouping, and at first kept running in the SECR's unlined dull dark attire with white lettering and numbering. It was repainted in the meantime as the resetting of the evaporator weight in June 1925, in a dull olive green attire. The green was supplemented with plain white coating, dark outskirts and primrose yellow markings. This attire was likewise connected to the five trains worked in 1930. Amid the Second World War, when work and paint were hard to come by, the class was bit by bit repainted in matt dark. The repainting occurred amid fundamental support visits to Ashford works, and incorporated the use of Bulleid's "Daylight" yellow square lettering and numerals on both delicate and cabside. This attire was steadily supplanted with sparkle dark somewhere in the range of 1945 and 1947. 

The model was developed as a component of a group of 15 NÃ¢Â class trains requested by the SECR and moved toward becoming No.Ã¢Â 822 inside this arrangement. At the point when repainted to Maunsell's dim olive green uniform, a prefix "A" was connected to the number to mean a train allotted for update at Ashford. The five trains built by the Southern Railway among March and November 1930 were numberedÃÂ A876Ã¢ÂÂA880. Presently the prefix was dropped and 1000 added to the numbers as a component of a general renumbering of Southern Railway train stock; in this manner on the reconstructing of the model in 1930 it wound up 1822. The other five individuals from the class moved toward becoming Nos.Ã¢Â 1876Ã¢ÂÂ1880. 

The class was consumed by British Railways in 1948, and like their NÃ¢Â class partners were given the power arrangement 4MT in 1949. Under British Railways possession, the class was renamed from 4MT to 4P5FB in 1953; the "B" indicating the brake control rating when utilized on unfitted (non-vacuum braked) products trains. The trains at first held their Southern Railway attire, yet No.Ã¢Â 1876 was the primary train to rise up out of Ashford works with "English Railways" painted on the delicate in Gill Sans lettering. From 1949 to 1950 N1Ã¢Â class trains were bit by bit repainted in the British Railways blended traffic fixed dark uniform with red, cream and dim coating and the British Railways peak on the delicate. Numbering was changed to the British Railways standard numbering framework: the model progressed toward becoming No.Ã¢Â 31822 and the 1930 cluster was apportioned the arrangement 31876Ã¢ÂÂ31880. 

The N1 was a proficient class of blended traffic train that could work over the Southern Railway's check confined courses and was noted by groups for its happy with riding characteristics. The class additionally furnished Maunsell and his colleagues with a point of reference for other smaller 3-chamber train structures and shaped a mechanical format for the Southern Railway's K1Ã¢Â class tank motor of 1925. In any case, the model offered little improvement in execution over the NÃ¢Â class when tried on non-limited courses, which prompted an underlying hesitance inside the administration of the Southern Railway to approve cluster development. This implied the non-standard Holcroft valve gear demonstrated costly to keep up due to the subsequent absence of extra parts. 

The utilization of three separate arrangements of valve gear on the 1930 cluster facilitated upkeep and improved the institutionalization of parts. The model was reconstructed to a similar detail as the 1930 group, making a vigorous workhorse equipped for a decent turn of speed when working substantial traveler and cargo trains. The amended valve gear format was along these lines connected to the 3-chamber U1 and VÃ¢Â class plans. The moderately early withdrawal of the N1s pre-dated the period of preservationists purchasing pulled back trains from scrap vendors or British Railways, and thus no instances of the N1Ã¢Â class made due into conservation.
