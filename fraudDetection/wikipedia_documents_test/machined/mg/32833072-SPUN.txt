It was composed by Gareth Roberts and coordinated by Steve Hughes. It is a continuation of "The Lodger", a scene Roberts composed for the past arrangement. 

In the scene, outsider time traveler the Doctor (Matt Smith) is going on a "goodbye visit" before his looming demise and visits his companion Craig (James Corden) in present-day Colchester, who has another child, Alfie. Despite the fact that not at first aiming to remain, the Doctor progresses toward becoming charmed by a Cybermen attack at a nearby retail establishment. 

Roberts and showrunner Steven Moffat needed to bring Craig back, having delighted in "The Lodger" and Corden's execution. However "Shutting Time" was intended to be fun, with parody worked around the twofold demonstration of Smith and Corden, it contains topics and an epilog that lead into the finale. The scene denotes the primary appearance of the Cybermats in the recovery of "Specialist Who", and they were fittingly upgraded. A great part of the scene was taped in a retail establishment and a private home in Cardiff during the evening, with shooting going right on time into the morning. "Shutting Time" was viewed by 6.93 million watchers in the UK and got commonly positive surveys from faultfinders; while the exhibitions, satire, and passionate minutes were adulated, numerous pundits were not satisfied with the utilization of the Cybermen. 

The Doctor is on a goodbye voyage through his companions and has just a single day to go before his passing. He stops by Craig, who is living with his better half Sophie in another home in present-day Colchester and is raising their child, Alfie. Craig, attempting to think about Alfie alone while Sophie is away for the end of the week, suspects the Doctor is exploring something outsider. The Doctor gets ready to leave, however he sees an abnormal electrical aggravation in the zone and chooses to explore. 

The Doctor accepts a position at the retail establishment to explore the unsettling influences further, alongside reports of missing workers. The Doctor and Craig enter a lift and end up transported to a Cyberman shuttle. The Doctor figures out how to switch the teleporter and cripple it. With Craig's assistance, the Doctor enters the store twilight and gets a Cybermat, which has been siphoning little measures of vitality to the rocket. The Doctor additionally experiences a breaking down Cyberman in the structure's storm cellar, and is interested how it touched base in the store. At Craig's, the Doctor reinvents the Cybermat to find the Cybermen flag. 

The Doctor leaves without anyone else to find the Cybermen at the store; Craig instantly pursues, bringing Alfie along. The Doctor finds the spaceship really sits underneath the store, underground, got to from the evolving room. With the siphoned vitality, the Cybermen will before long have enough capacity to change over humankind. Craig, leaving Alfie at the store, pursues the Doctor, and is caught and set into a transformation machine to turn into the new pioneer of the Cybermen. Alfie's cries over the shut circuit TV reverberation in the ship. Craig, hearing Alfie, battles and turns around the change. The remainder of the Cybermen horrendously experience the feelings they have curbed from Craig's battle, and their circuits begin to over-burden. The Doctor and Craig escape by means of the teleporter as the ship detonates. The Doctor leaves in the TARDIS to confront his demise. 

In the far future, River Song, as of late made a Doctor of Archeology, noticed the date and area of the Doctor's demise. She is hindered by Madame Kovarian and operators of the Silence. Kovarian reveals to River that she is as yet theirs, and will be the one to slaughter the Doctor. Without wanting to, they place her in an expanded space traveler's suit and submerge her in Lake Silencio in 2011 to anticipate the Doctor. 

Two hundred years have gone for the Doctor since the occasions of "The God Complex", taking him to the age his more established self was in "The Impossible Astronaut". He invested this energy "waving through time" at Amy and Rory, which is seen toward the start of "The Impossible Astronaut". The Doctor takes the blue envelopes he uses to gather his buddies from Craig's level and Craig gives him the Stetson he wears toward the beginning of "The Impossible Astronaut". From River Song's point of view, the last scene happens preceding the excursion in "The Impossible Astronaut", and she is affirmed to have been that scene's eponymous space explorer. 

Cybermats are appeared without precedent for the resuscitated arrangement. In the great arrangement, they showed up in "The Tomb of the Cybermen" (1967), "The Wheel in Space" (1968), and "Vengeance of the Cybermen" (1975). The Doctor inspects a toy and comments, "Robot hound; not as much fun as I implied," to K-9, a robot hound who went with the Fourth Doctor. The Doctor professes to have the capacity to "talk 'infant'", as he did in "A Good Man Goes to War". The Doctor communicates his aversion for Craig's "refurbished" house by utilizing a line from the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) in "The Three Doctors" (1973) and "The Five Doctors" (1983). The Doctor discusses the smaller than expected lyric "Not a rodent, a cybermat" from the novelisation of "Vengeance of the Cybermen". 

Amy has turned into a minor VIP, showing up in an advertisement for Petrichor scent, with the slogan, "For the young lady who's burnt out on pausing." The idea of petrichor was utilized as a clairvoyant secret word in "The Doctor's Wife" and signifies "the smell of residue after downpour". The Doctor much of the time alludes to Amy as "the young lady who paused". The scent and slogan suggest that the scene happens after "The God Complex". This contentions with the date on Craig's paper, 19 April 2011, which is three days before the Doctor's passing at Lake Silencio. 

Author Gareth Roberts said in a meeting that he was thinking about bringing the character of Craig back when he saw James Corden's execution in "The Lodger", saying that "it previously felt like he was one of the "Who" family". Showrunner Steven Moffat was satisfied with "The Lodger", a scene he called "very near my heart", and needed to bring Craig back. He remarked that it was a difference in pace for Corden, who typically was given a role as "the amusing one"; as Craig he may be "the straight man to the wacky Doctor". Chief Steve Hughes contrasted the Doctor and Craig with well known comedic pairs, for example, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, and Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Despite the fact that the vast majority of the scene is expected to be fun, it likewise sets the phase for the finale and the Doctor's forthcoming passing. The "genuine" last scene, composed by Moffat, finished up occasions throughout River's life that had been indicated since "Fragile living creature and Stone". Other scene titles recommended by Roberts included "Everything Must Go", "The Last Adventure", and "Cyberman and a Baby". A prequel, entitled "Up All Night", is incorporated as a major aspect of the "Night and the Doctor" arrangement of little scenes in the Series 6 DVD bundle. 

It was additionally Roberts' plan to bring back the Cybermen, on the grounds that there were no other returning beasts in the arrangement and he thought "there ought to be a feeling of history about the Doctor's last fight to spare Earth before he takes off to meet his demise". He felt this was predictable with the topic of "death and waiting dimness" that had kept running all through the 6th arrangement. Roberts needed the group of onlookers to imagine that perhaps Craig would truly be changed over. Moffat felt the "exploding the Cybermen with adoration" end was the "Specialist Who" variant of a dad holding with his child. Roberts felt that the scene's portrayal of the Cybermen put it on the "senseless/frightening pivot" that was basic in "Specialist Who". 

Daisy Haggard's diminished job as Sophie in the scene was because of her job in the play "Becky Shaw" at Almeida Theater in London. This scene marks Lynda Baron's third association with "Specialist Who", having given vocals to the "Melody of the Last Chance Saloon", heard in "The Gunfighters" (1966), and the job of Wrack in "Illumination" (1983). The going with "Specialist Who Confidential" to "Shutting Time" is entitled "Open All Hours" out of appreciation for Baron's job in the sitcom of a similar name. Radio 1 DJ Greg James shows up in a non-talking appearance job, as a man looking for unmentionables. His character was nicknamed "Carlos". Alfie was depicted by seven distinct children, generally matched in twins, in light of exacting tenets about infant hours. A few fakers were utilized too. Corden, who was going to turned into a dad, took in tips from the moms. 

Quite a bit of "Shutting Time" was recorded in a retail establishment in Cardiff. As the store must be shut, they recorded more than four or five evenings, now and then going until 6:00 in the first part of the day. Hughes said it was a "channel" on the creation group, while Corden reviewed it made the cast and team "woozy" and "crazy". Allegedly, the retail establishment scenes were shot in March 2011. The remainder of the scene was taped in a private home in Cardiff; the couple who possessed the house enabled the taping to happen with the goal for it to be an encounter for their two young men. Generation at the house likewise went into the early hours of the morning. The window of the sliding entryway in the house that the Doctor hops through to spare Craig from the Cybermat was excessively little, so the creation group constructed another. The new entryway was too huge for shatterglass; rather, glass that breaks into lumps was utilized, set up with a little hazardous that would split the glass when Matt Smith's stand-in bounced through it. Hughes needed it to look as though the group of onlookers was slamming through the window with the Doctor; he grafted together shots of Smith recorded running up to the entryway, the double hopping through it, and Smith arriving with shards of glass tossed over him. 

The Cybus Industries logo, which had been utilized on the Cybermen since their update for the restored arrangement in "Ascent of the Cybermen"/"The Age of Steel" (2006), was concealed for the Cybermen in this scene just as the ones which had recently showed up in "A Good Man Goes to War". This is on the grounds that the Cybermen from "Ascent of the Cybermen" started from a parallel universe, while the prime universe has its own Cybermen from the planet Mondas, as found in the exemplary arrangement. As the Cybermen that include in "Shutting Time" were scarcely enduring, the generation group made them look separated and as though they had been tearing up parts to endure. The suits were at that point worn to a degree, as they had been utilized so frequently in the a long time since they were made. The Cyber Controller change gear was worked around Corden. 

The Cybermats, which had not been seen on screen since 1975's "Retribution of the Cybermen", were upgraded to seem all the more cutting edge. The top was intended to review the leader of a Cyberman, and piranha-like teeth were added to recommend that they were changed over creatures, similarly as Cybermen were changed over people. Three renditions of the Cybermat were made. The first was essentially a "stunt twofold" which did not have teeth and was intended for being tossed around or laid still. The second was a link controlled "close-up" form that had teeth and whipped, and was utilized for when the characters dealt with it. Smith broke this one when he hit it with a skillet in the scene where Craig is being assaulted, and it was along these lines fixed with tape. The third was radio-controlled to dash along the floor. The after creation enhancements group The Mill made a PC produced Cybermat that jumped up to assault Craig. 

"Shutting Time" was first communicated in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 24 September 2011, and in the United States on BBC America. It accomplished medium-term evaluations of 5.3 million watchers, coming in second for its schedule opening behind "Elite player Family Fortunes". At the point when last united considers were brought with record, the number rose to 6.93 million, making it the second most watched program of the day behind "The X Factor". "Shutting Time" was the fifth most-downloaded program of September on BBC's online iPlayer. It was likewise given an Appreciation Index of 86, considered "fantastic". 

The scene got commonly positive surveys, with commentators adulating the comic transaction among Smith and Corden. Dan Martin of "The Guardian" scrutinized the choice to air an independent scene as the penultimate show of the arrangement, calling "Shutting Time" "something of an anomaly" just as composing emphatically about Smith and Corden's "Shrub and Hardy act". In any case, he felt that the Cybermen had been denied of their danger. Martin later appraised it the eighth best scene of the arrangement, however the finale was excluded in the rundown. Gavin Fuller of "The Daily Telegraph" granted the scene three out of five stars, contrasting Smith's execution positively with that of Patrick Troughton. Neela Debnath of "The Independent" said it was a "captivating difference in pace" and prevailing with "incredible comedic minutes" and the "splendid science between the Doctor and Craig". She commended Corden for exceeding expectations after his "normal" execution in "The Lodger". 

Patrick Mulkern, composing for "Radio Times", believed that the closure was a "passionate overload...but what better approach to manage the sincerely denied Cybermen?" He was satisfied with the "sweet appearance" from Amy and Rory and the "strained coda" with River Song and Kovarian. Keith Phipps of "The A.V. Club" gave "Shutting Time" an evaluation of "B+", feeling that the scene was more about little character minutes than the Cybermen plot. In spite of the fact that he composed it was not as solid as "The Lodger", he adulated the manner in which it offered a reprieve before the season finale to draw out the milder side of the Doctor. Computerized Spy's Morgan Jeffery lauded Smith, Corden, and Lynda Baron as Val, and felt that it was a "consolation" to have a ton of fun scene after two passionate substantial ones. Be that as it may, he didn't think it was in the same class as "The Lodger" and suspected the Cybermen were "squandered", refering to the finish of Craig exploding them with affection as "inadmissible". Andrew Blair of Den of Geek safeguarded the Cybermen in the scene, opining that the scene drew out the deplorability of them scarcely enduring and changing over individuals precisely with no enthusiastic comprehension of the circumstance. 

IGN's Matt Risley evaluated the scene 7.5 out of 10, adulating the science among Smith and Corden just as Smith's association with the child, yet was frustrated with the Cybermen, who he said "never truly conveyed on the danger or awfulness fans know they're prepared to do". "SFX magazine" analyst Rob Power gave the scene three and a half out of five stars, saying it "[worked] ponders" as a carefree scene before the finale and with "legitimately awful" Cybermen. In spite of the fact that he thought the Cyberman needed "genuine threat" and Craig got away in a "mushy manner", he believed the fundamental spotlight to be on the Doctor's "goodbye visit" and adulated Smith's execution. He suspected that the snapshots of "tragic peered toward depression and abdication" added weight to "what might some way or another have been a paper-flimsy scene". Power likewise adulated the consummation for uniting things for the finale, however he thought the last scene with River Song felt "a little attached". Charlie Jane Anders composing for io9 depicted it as a "commendable spin-off" and "welcome shot of parody" and was sure towards the "sweet" investigation of the Doctor's self-hatred that demonstrated the universe required him. In any case, Anders was disturbed by the running joke of the Doctor and Craig being confused with a gay couple and the generalizations the scene depended on, for example, the "dumbfounded father" and the oblivious shop young ladies. Christopher Hooton of "Metro" observed the scene to be "drenched" and "wiped out sweet", reprimanding Corden for his "challenging", "irritating" execution, the dependence on "droll escapades" that "swayed a bit excessively near the CBBC end of the range" and the "chipper [and] self-satisfied" soundtrack.
