Mycena fonticola 

Mycena fonticola is a types of growth in the Mycenaceae family. First revealed in 2007, it is known just from focal Honshu, in Japan, where it develops on dead leaves and twigs in low-rise woodlands ruled by oak trees. The natural product body of the parasite has a smooth, violet-dark colored top up to in distance across, and a slim stem up to long. Recognizing minuscule attributes of the mushroom incorporate the moderately expansive, particularly amyloid spores (swinging blue to dark when recolored with Melzer's reagent), the smooth, axle molded cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge), the nonattendance of pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face), the diverticulate hyphae of the top fingernail skin, and the nonappearance of cinch associations. 

The parasite was first gathered by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 1999, and depicted as another species alongside seven other Japanese Mycenas in a 2007 production. The mushroom's Japanese name is "Izumino-ashinagatake" (ÄÂÂ¤ÄÂÅÄÂÂÄÂÂÄÂËÄÂËÄÂÂÄÂÅºÄÂÅ¼ÄÂÄ). The particular appellation "fonticola" is gotten from Latin, and signifies "tenant in wellspring". 

As indicated by Takahashi, different large scale and minuscule highlights recommend that this species is best grouped in the segment "Fragilipedes" (Fr.) QuÄÅ¡l., as characterized by the Dutch "Mycena" pro Maas Geesteranus. 

The top is in breadth, and ranges fit as a fiddle from cone shaped to curved to chime formed. The surface has radially masterminded shallow furrows stretching out nearly to the focal point of the top. The top surface is to some degree hygrophanous (changing shading as it loses or ingests water), dry, and smooth. It is hued violet-dark colored when youthful, at that point turns out to be fairly paler from the edge. The white tissue is up to 1Ã¢Â mm thick, and comes up short on any unmistakable scent or taste. The stem is long and slim contrasted with the extent of the top, regularly tall by thick, tube shaped, marginally expanded at the base, and empty. It is grayish-dark colored to violet-darker at the top, bit by bit getting to be violet-darker on the lower divide. The stem surface is at first pruinose (seeming, by all accounts, to be secured with a fine whitish powder), however ends up smooth in age. The stem base bears extensive, bristle-like coarse white hairs. The gills are adnexed (barely joined to the stem), with between 23Ã¢ÂÂ27 achieving the stem. The gills are up to expansive, slight, and have a whitish or with a grayish tint; the gills edges are a similar shading as the gill faces. 

The spores are ellipsoid, smooth, drab, unmistakably amyloid (retaining iodine recolor from Melzer's reagent), meager walled, and measure 11.5Ã¢ÂÂ14 by 6Ã¢ÂÂ8Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 17Ã¢ÂÂ28 by 6Ã¢ÂÂ8Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m, club-formed, and four-spored. The basidioles (juvenile or prematurely ended basidia) are club-molded. The cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the gills edges) are 32Ã¢ÂÂ39 by 5Ã¢ÂÂ12Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m, plenteous, axle molded to generally club-formed, regularly apically comprehensively adjusted, smooth, lackluster, and slim walled. They structure a sterile gill edge. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are missing in this species. The hymenophoral (tissue of the hymenium-bearing structure) is made of dainty walled hyphae that are 7Ã¢ÂÂ15Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide, round and hollow, smooth, boring, and dextrinoid (recoloring ruddy to rosy dark colored in Melzer's reagent). The top fingernail skin is made of parallel, twisted around hyphae that are 2Ã¢ÂÂ5Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide, barrel shaped, and thickly secured with warty or finger-like slender walled diverticulae that are drab or contain cytoplasmic caramel color. The layer of hyphae hidden the top fingernail skin are parallel, vapid or with cytoplasmic tanish color, dextrinoid, and have short and swelled cells measuring up to 30Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide. The stem fingernail skin is made of parallel, twisted around hyphae that are 3Ã¢ÂÂ5Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide, and round and hollow. These hyphae are secured with dispersed, flimsy walled warty or finger-like diverticulae that can be either boring, or contain earthy shade in the cytoplasm. The substance of the stem is made of longitudinally running, barrel shaped hyphae that are 5Ã¢ÂÂ17Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide, smooth, dry, and dextrinoid. Brace associations are missing in all tissues of this species. 

"Mycena mustea" is another comparative "Mycena" that was found and revealed simultaneously with "M.Ã¢Â fonticola"; it contrasts in shaping a pale grayish purple top with a low and expansive umbo. Infinitesimally, it has club-molded cheilocystidia with a few apical short finger-like outgrowths, and nondiverticulate hyphae in the stem fingernail skin. 

"Mycena fonticola" is known just from Kanagawa, Japan. Natural product bodies are discovered lone or dissipated, on dead leaves and twigs in low-height backwoods ruled by the oak species "Quercus myrsinaefolia" and "Q.Ã¢Â serrata".
