Howard Knox Ramey 

Howard Knox Ramey (28 June 1896 Ã¢ÂÂ 26 March 1943) was a United States Army Air Forces general amid World War II. Ramey figured out how to fly in 1918 amid World War I and filled in as a teacher at the Air Corps Advanced Flying School and as a staff officer with the first Bombardment Wing between the wars. He was leader of the IV Bomber Command from 12 August 1942 to 8 November 1942, and was elevated to brigadier general on 17 September 1942. In November 1942, he progressed toward becoming delegate administrator of the Seventh Air Force in Hawaii. In January 1943 he turned into the leader of the V Bomber Command in Australia and Papua, which he drove amid the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. In March 1943 he vanished on a surveillance trip over the Torres Strait. Neither his air ship nor his body has ever been found. 

Howard Knox Ramey was conceived in Waynesboro, Mississippi on 28 June 1896. He went to Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College from 1915 to 1917. In December 1917 he enrolled as a private five star in the Aviation Section, U.S. Flag Corps, in which he was authorized as a second lieutenant on 20 April 1918. 

In July 1920, Ramey got a lasting commission as a first lieutenant in the United States Army Air Service. He went to the Air Service Photography School in 1921, and moved toward becoming officer of the sixth Photo Section at Camp Nichols in the Philippines from January to October 1925. He at that point filled in as knowledge officer there until he came back to the United States in February 1927. He directed the 22nd Photo Section at Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas from 1927 to 1928, and was a teacher at the Air Corps Advanced Flying School there from 1928 to 1931. 

After over ten years as a first lieutenant, Ramey was at long last elevated to skipper on 1 March 1932. On 26 March 1934, Ramey was one of 35 American World War I military pilots who established the Order of the Daedalians, a brotherly request of military pilots. 

He went to the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama, graduating in 1934, and after that the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, graduating in 1936. In a matter of seconds a while later, he was elevated to major on 16 June 1936. Ramey filled in as activities officer and associate head of staff for knowledge of the first Bombardment Wing at March Field, California from 1936 to 1941. He was elevated to lieutenant colonel on 30 December 1940. 

Ramey was vice president of staff for activities (G-3) of the Fourth Air Force from January to August 1942, with the position of colonel from 5 January 1942. He was authority of the IV Bomber Command from 12 August 1942 to 8 November 1942, and was elevated to brigadier general on 17 September 1942. In November 1942, he moved toward becoming appointee administrator of the Seventh Air Force. 

Following the demise of the leader of the V Bomber Command, Brigadier General Kenneth Walker, in an air strike over Rabaul in January 1943, the officer of the Fifth Air Force, Lieutenant General George Kenney asked Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold, the head of Army Air Forces to send Ramey to Australia as a substitution. The two men had known each other for a considerable length of time and Ramey had as of late been on Kenney's staff when Kenney was administrator of the Fourth Air Force. "I had a great deal of trust in him," Kenney later stated, "and trusted he would complete a genuine activity for me. Arnold answered the following day that I could have him." Ramey accepted order of V Bomber Command in January 1943. After the contentions over besieging strategies with Walker, Kenney was satisfied that Ramey enjoyed the skip bombarding strategies the Fifth Air Force was creating. These strategies were placed practically speaking with decimating impact at the Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943. 

On 26 March 1943, Ramey took off from Port Moresby in the B-17 Flying Fortress #41-24384, "Pluto", to complete a booked seven-hour surveillance trip to Merauke and Horn Island. A message from the radio administrator twenty minutes after take-off was the last that was ever gotten notification from the flying machine. A broad air look was directed however no sign was found of the air ship or the twelve men ready. Ramey was proclaimed dead on 19 November 1945. He deserted a spouse and two little girls. Ramey Air Force Base in Puerto Rico was named in his respect. 

In February 2007, jumper Ben Cropp revealed that he had discovered the destruction of the plane. Be that as it may, the plane ended up having been a misidentified C-47. The area of the disaster area of "Pluto" stays obscure.
