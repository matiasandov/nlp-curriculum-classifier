George W. Johnson (representative) 

George Washington Johnson (May 27, 1811April 8, 1862) was the main Confederate legislative leader of Kentucky. An attorney diverted rancher from Scott County, Kentucky, Johnson favored severance as a methods for avoiding the Civil War, trusting the Union and Confederacy would be powers of equivalent quality, each too careful to even think about attacking the other. As political assumption in the Commonwealth took a firmly Union turn following the decisions of 1861, Johnson was instrumental in arranging a power show in Russellville, Kentucky with the purpose of "disjoining everlastingly our association with the Federal Government." The show made a Confederate shadow government for the Commonwealth, and Johnson was chosen its representative. 

Regardless of his pitiful political experienceÃ¢ÂÂhaving recently served just three years in the Kentucky House of RepresentativesÃ¢ÂÂJohnson worked intensely to guarantee the accomplishment of the shadow government. Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861, however the shadow government's impact in the Commonwealth broadened just to the extent the Confederate Army progressed. At the point when Albert Sidney Johnston relinquished the Confederate capital of Bowling Green, Governor Johnson and the other government authorities went with him. In spite of his propelled age and an injured arm, Johnson volunteered for military administration in General Johnston's military. Johnson was murdered at the Battle of Shiloh, making him the main state representative, Union or Confederate, to fall fighting amid the Civil War. He was prevailing by Richard Hawes, the second and last legislative head of Confederate Kentucky. 

George Washington Johnson was conceived on May 27, 1811 close Georgetown in Scott County, Kentucky, the child of major William and Betsy Payne Johnson. Significant Johnson kicked the bucket not long after the end of the War of 1812, in which he was a member, and George Johnson was raised in the home of his stepfather, John Allen. Johnson got three degrees from Transylvania University: an A.B. in 1829, a LL.B. in 1832, and a M.A. in 1833. On August 20, 1833, he wedded Ann Eliza Viley, little girl of Captain Willa and Lydia Smith Viley. The couple had ten youngsters, seven of whom lived to adulthood. 

Johnson quickly specialized in legal matters in Georgetown, yet chosen he favored cultivating. He claimed a homestead close Georgetown, just as a ranch in Arkansas. In 1838, Johnson was chosen as a Democrat to the Kentucky House of Representatives. He was offered the assignments for lieutenant representative and U.S. Congressman, however declined them both. In August 1845, Johnson headed the Committee of Sixty that caught abolitionist Cassius M. Earth's printing press and sent it to Cincinnati, Ohio. 

Despite the fact that he upheld John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860, he didn't feel that Abraham Lincoln's race supported severance, since Republicans controlled neither Congress nor the Supreme Court. As the Confederate States of America were shaped, notwithstanding, Johnson started to lose trust in Kentucky as a piece of the Union. Rather, he started to advocate that Kentucky join the Confederacy, trusting that the Union and Confederate countries would be excessively uniformly coordinated to think about war and would arrange an organized commerce understanding that would profit both. 

In 1861, Johnson made a trip to Richmond, Virginia to request that Jefferson Davis regard Kentucky's lack of bias in the Civil War. Following a close compass of Kentucky's state and government decisions by Union sympathizers, William "Bull" Nelson set up Camp Dick Robinson, a Union enrolling camp, in Garrard County. Southern sympathizers considered this to be a rupture of the Commonwealth's nonpartisanship, and called a State Rights Convention on September 10, 1861. Johnson was among the representatives from seventy Kentucky provinces who went to the show. The representatives chose Richard Hawes as seat, required a rebuilding of Kentucky's lack of bias in the war, and censured the Federal government for its "intrusion." This very late exertion to keep Kentucky from helping the Union was ineffective, and Johnson, a known Southern sympathizer, fled to Virginia with Breckinridge and others to maintain a strategic distance from potential capture by Union powers. From Virginia, Johnson made a trip through Tennessee to Bowling Green where, regardless of his age (49) and a disabled arm, he volunteered as a guide to General Simon B. Buckner. 

On October 29, 1861, a gathering of KentuckiansÃ¢ÂÂJohnson among themÃ¢ÂÂmet at Russellville, Kentucky to talk about the development of a Confederate government for the Commonwealth, trusting the Unionist government in Frankfort did not speak to the desire of most of Kentucky's natives. Johnson led the council that created the show's last report, and by and by presented a portion of its key goals. The report required a power show to disjoin ties with the Federal government. Johnson, Breckinridge, and Humphrey Marshall were among the prominent individuals from the Committee of Ten that made courses of action for the show. 

On November 18, 1861, 116 representatives speaking to 68 Kentucky provinces gathered at the Clark House in Russellville. Throughout the following three days, a shadow government was built up with Bowling Green as its brief capital. Johnson was consistently picked as legislative head of the new Confederate state. 

On November 21, 1861, Johnson composed Confederate president Jefferson Davis to demand Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy. In spite of the fact that Davis had some booking about the circumvention of the chosen General Assembly in shaping the Confederate government, he reasoned that Johnson's solicitation had merit. Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861. 

Amid the winter of 1861, Johnson attempted forcefully to affirm the authenticity of the youngster government, yet without much of any result. Its locale expanded just to the extent the region constrained by the Confederate Army. Johnson came woefully shy of raising the 46,000 troops mentioned by the Confederate Congress in Richmond. Endeavors to require charges and to urge natives to turn over their weapons to the legislature were comparably ineffective. On January 3, 1862, Johnson mentioned an entirety of $3Ã¢Â million from the Confederate Congress to meet the temporary government's working costs. The Congress rather endorsed an entirety of $2Ã¢Â million, the consumption of which required endorsement of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis. 

Amid his works to support the temporary government, Johnson's absence of got notification from his family weighed vigorously upon him. The main relative with whom he had contact was his child Madison ("Matty"), who had joined John Hunt Morgan's rangers. Johnson appreciated and regarded Morgan, and was satisfied that his child had served under him. In 1862, he mentioned by letter that his better half send their fifteen-year-old child Junius to serve in the Confederate Army. In spite of Johnson's protestations that he would guarantee his child's wellbeing, his better half rejected this solicitation. 

It was Johnson's training to stay away from impedance with military choices, anyway he upheld Morgan's solicitation for two light big guns pieces that progressed toward becoming signs of his order. On the other hand, he reliably restricted the direction of General Lloyd Tilghman, attempting more than once yet fruitlessly to have him evacuated. It is hazy how much military impact Johnson employed in his situation as senator, however he delighted in a warm association with a large portion of the Confederate commanders. 

At the point when General Albert Sydney Johnston was compelled to pull back his troops from Bowling Green in February 1862, the Confederate state government moved with his military to Tennessee. On April 6, 1862, General Johnston assaulted the Union armed force at Shiloh, Tennessee. Amid this fight, Governor Johnson filled in as a volunteer helper to General Breckinridge and Colonel Robert P. Trabue. After his pony was executed out from under him, Johnson battled by walking with Company E of the Fourth Kentucky Infantry Regiment, and demanded being confirmed as a private. He announced "I will take a decent night's rest and be prepared for the battle tomorrow." 

The following day, Governor Johnson was truly injured in the correct thigh and midriff. He lay injured on the front line until the following morning, when he was perceived by Union General Alexander McDowell McCook. Johnson and McCook had both gone to the 1860 Democratic National Convention and were the two Freemasons. Johnson was taken on board the Union emergency clinic dispatch "Hannibal", where notwithstanding the ministrations of a few doctors, he kicked the bucket on April 8. Companions in the Union armed force, including General John M. Harlan, stuffed Johnson's body in salt and dispatched it to Louisville, at that point on to Georgetown for entombment.
