"Previously, Brendan would state, 'It's an extraordinary melody, yet I figure you ought to do it in an alternate key,' and we'd state no. However at this point we've heard Bruce <nowiki>[Springsteen]</nowiki> has tuned in to his proposals, I figure we will as well." Bassist Jeff Ament stated, "He brings a fiercely legitimate way to deal with what he supposes is working and what isn't, and it truly moves things along... We don't get weighted down with thoughts that possibly aren't even that great.

That is one reason we kept the courses of action lean." The artist refered to Guided by Voices as a kind of perspective in making the shorter and quicker melodies of "Backspacer". Gossard said that "Backspacer" is "the thing that we could have accomplished for the last five records, as far as reconnecting with the underlying foundations of why this band works," and that "there are a lot of anthems, as well... also, there are a few moves in how Jeff and Matt and I are all relatingÃ¢ÂÂI think this current record has an opportunity to sound essentially extraordinary."
