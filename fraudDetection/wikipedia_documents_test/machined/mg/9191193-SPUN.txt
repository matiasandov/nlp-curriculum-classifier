Measure of the Ptolemies 

The Cup of the Ptolemies (French: Coupe des PtolÄÅ¡mÄÅ¡es), otherwise called the Cup of Saint Denis, is an onyx appearance two-took care of container, or "kantharos". The container, beautified with Dionysiac vignettes and symbols, was cut sooner or later in Classical Antiquity, presumably in Alexandria. In the end, it discovered its way into the treasury of the French kingdom, before it was given to the nunnery of St. Denis. Amid the Middle Ages, it was utilized as a Christian cup, and sumptuous mounts were included, with Latin engravings. In 1804, the glass was stolen, and the mounts were lost, in spite of the fact that the container itself was recouped. It is presently in the Cabinet des MÄÅ¡dailles at the BibliothÄÂ¨que Nationale de France, Paris. 

The two-dealt with appearance glass, one of the recognized artful culminations among hardstone carvings of traditional relic, was cut out of onyx and measures 8.4Ã¢Â cm high with a breadth of 12.5Ã¢Â cm. The container is shrouded in Dionysiac vignettes that highlight covers, vases, blessed creatures, and wreath: images of the religion itself. 

What is today viewed as the front of the vessel portrays six covers encompassing an "anclabris". The "anclabris" is delineated as though it were made out of marble, and two sphinxesÃ¢ÂÂbeings that fill in as figurative portrayals of the riddles of the Dionysian religionÃ¢ÂÂare supporting the table. On the "anclabris" stands a little statue of Hermes, by which balances a cover with funnels. Over this veil might just be the raven of Apollo. On the left half of the table, a goat is seen laying on the ground, encompassed by the images of the clique. At last, a wicker bin can be found to one side of the table, out of which a snake rises; this crate theme is regularly found in Dionysian work of art, and apparently was an object of incredible significance to the religion. 

On the upper-left half of what is today considered the back of the vessel, the cover of Pan can be found in the tree. Underneath, a goat is going after aged grapes. Behind the goat lies foods grown from the ground table, in all likelihood an "anclabris" with five formal vessels on top. On the left half of the table stands a little female figure, whose lit lights speak to the celebrations and the blow-outs related with the faction's rituals. FrÄÅ¡dÄÅ¡ric de Clarac contended that the statues could symbolize either Telete or Ceres, two gods regularly connected with Dionysus. Over the table is a woven artwork and two bacchante covers. To one side, in an apple tree, another cover of Pan can be seen. Two more bacchante covers are available on the base, before the table. 

It appears that the vessel's agnostic birthplaces were neglected when it was changed over into a Christian cup amid the Middle Ages. Classicist Erika Zwierlein-Diehl noticed that numerous portrayals of the container overlooked the Dionysiac idea of the carvings and pictures, just taking note of that the glass was engraved with "trees, heads, creatures, and winged animals." This (perhaps deliberate) loss of iconographic seeing, likewise alluded to as "un-naming", appears to have been a route for agnostic ancient rarities to be reused for Christian purposes. 

The container was likely made in Alexandria, Egypt. It was once thought to go back to the Hellenistic time frame, c. 250 BC, however is presently viewed as dating to the first century AD. Its alleged association with the Ptolemies goes back to 1644, when the history specialist Jean Tristan de Saint-Amant contended that the vase was made for the burial service parades of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who managed the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 285 until 246 BC. Afterward, the researcher E. Babelon proposed the more broad thought that the glass had been cut amid "the season of the Ptolemies"a wide range extending from 305 to 30 BC. Notwithstanding, there is no specific proof for this, and different researchers, for example, John Henry Middleton or Martin Conway, propose that the glass was cut later, amid the first or second hundreds of years AD by Romans. Deciding the careful date of the container has been hazardous to a great extent on the grounds that comparative pieces are uncommon, making any conceivable correlation troublesome. 

The careful history of the glass is to a great extent obscure, despite the fact that Conway proposes that the container likely had a place with the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne before being gone down through the French rulers, one of whom in the long run gave it to the nunnery of Saint Denis. The container was every so often utilized as a vessel for fellowship wine, and figured in the crowning ritual of the French ruler, at which, as per S. G. Millet as cited by Conway, the rulers took "bathing from this cup, after heavenly fellowship". In 1634, the container was evaluated to be worth around 25,000 livres, with the pearl encrusted gold mountings esteemed at 1,200 livres. Until September 1791 it framed piece of the treasury of the Basilica of Saint-Denis. It was stolen in 1804, despite the fact that it was later recuperated missing its mounts when the criminals were gotten in the Netherlands. The glass is presently in the Cabinet des MÄÅ¡dailles at the BibliothÄÂ¨que Nationale de France in Paris. 

At some point amid the Carolingian time frame, a base "in the state of a truncated cone" was built to influence the vessel to seem increasingly like a customary cup, and the glass' handle was "somewhat secured with cloisonnÄÅ¡ goldsmith work". Afterward, in the twelfth century, Abbot Suger of Saint Denis (who served from AD 112251) likely decorated the goblet, including metalwork that broadened its base. These mounts were made out of gold and were diamond studded. After the container was recouped in the nineteenth century, it was feeling the loss of its mounts, which were likely liquefied down for their valuable materials. Today, the mounts are just known through an etching by Michel FÄÅ¡libien that was made in 1706. 

Suger additionally included a two-line Latin engraving on the cup mount, known just from the etching made by FÄÅ¡libien, which peruses: "hoc vas Xpe tibi [devota] mente dicavit tertius in Francos [sublimis] regmine Karlus". In English, this legend signifies: "The [exalted] Charles, third on the French honored position, blessed this vessel for you, Christ, with a [faithful] mind." Most researchers concur that this engraving joins it to Charles the Bald, who ruled Western Francia from AD 84077. Others think it alludes to either the Charlemagne who ruled Francia from AD 768Ã¢ÂÂ814, or Charles the Simple who likewise governed Western Francia from AD 919Ã¢ÂÂ23, in spite of the fact that these proposals appear to be far-fetched.
