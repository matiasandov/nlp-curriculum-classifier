James Brudenell, seventh Earl of Cardigan 

Lieutenant General James Thomas Brudenell, seventh Earl of Cardigan (16 October 1797Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ 28 March 1868) was an officer in the British Army who instructed the Light Brigade amid the Crimean War. He drove the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava. 

For an incredible duration in legislative issues and his long military vocation he described the egotistical and extreme blue-blood of the period. His movement through the Army was set apart by numerous scenes of phenomenal inadequacy, yet in addition by liberality to the men under his direction and veritable fortitude. As an individual from the landed nobility he had effectively and ardently restricted any political change in Britain, yet in the most recent year of his life he yielded and came to recognize that such change would convey advantage to all classes of society. 

James Brudenell was conceived in what was, by the models of the Brudenell family, an unassuming home at Hambleden, Buckinghamshire to Robert Brudenell and his significant other Penelope Brudenell, Countess of Cardigan. In February 1811 his dad acquired the Cardigan earldom, alongside the colossal domains and incomes that ran with it, and the family seat of Deene Park, Northamptonshire. James likewise moved toward becoming "Master Brudenell", and moved to the most terrific of family units, at fourteen years old. 

He was instructed at Harrow where, despite the apprehensions of his family that a youth head damage brought about by a risky tumble from a pony had truly harmed his mind, he demonstrated fitness in Greek and Latin. He gained great scholarly ground, however after he had settled a squabble with another understudy by a composed clench hand battle, his dad expelled him from the school. (Clench hand battles were endured at Harrow: it was the reality of Brudenell's getting discipline for unapproved nonappearance while having a broken bone in his grasp took care of by a London specialist that had irritated the duke). He was therefore taught at home. Here, as the main child among seven sisters, he formed into something of a spoilt tyke, acquainted with getting his own particular manner. This has been viewed as a reason for his self-importance and obstinacy in later life. 

Brudenell was a fine rider and, enlivened by the conclusive job of mounted force at the skirmish of Waterloo, his desire was to buy a commission in an in vogue regiment and fill in as a military officer. His dad, in any case, aware of protecting the family from danger of fight, would not permit this. Rather in November 1815 he was sent up to Christ Church, Oxford; as a noble he was naturally allowed affirmation without examination. He left in his third yearÃ¢ÂÂaristocrats with no scholastic bowed were discharged after just two yearsÃ¢ÂÂbut in spite of demonstrating some inclination, he didn't take a degree. 

In February 1818, amid his last term at Oxford, and again following his dad's desires, he progressed toward becoming Member of Parliament (MP) for Marlborough, a pocket precinct claimed by his cousin Charles, Earl of Ailesbury. The aim was to give Brudenell an establishing in parliamentary undertakings previously, in the long run, he would have his spot in the House of Lords. 

Brudenell's first activity on leaving Oxford was not to take his parliamentary seat but rather, as was customary for rich young fellows of the time, to take the Grand Tour. His agenda, with Russia and Sweden included, was more broad than the customary goals of France and Italy. The outing permitted Brudenell to appreciate the full delights of both social and social open doors managed by the nations he visited. 

On his arrival Brudenell sat down in the House of Commons, normally on the decision, Tory, side of the House. His commitment to government was negligible: he presented with parliamentarians, for example, Canning, Peel and Castlereagh, of incredible duty and mind and he could offer nothing to contend. On one issue, be that as it may, he held fast. In 1829 his gathering presented a bill permitting constrained Catholic liberation yet his benefactor, cousin Charles, educated him to contradict it. In three vital votes Brudenell went without, on account of his adoration for Wellington, the bill's support, and in outcome he was tossed out of his seat. 

His arrival to parliament in 1830 cost him sincerely. After his prior insubordination he couldn't hope to be given a pocket district in this way, rather, he needed to purchase his own. He was chosen part for Fowey, Cornwall, at an expense of at any rate ÃÅ5,000 (). The cash, nonetheless, was not very much spent. Just two years after the fact the seat was one of those canceled in the Reform Act of 1832, intended to get rid of such acts of neglect. He looked for rather the recently made voting demographic of Northamptonshire North, nearby to the family seat of Deene Park in any case, in spite of holding the favorable position that a considerable lot of the voters were reliant on family's support and altruism, the battle did not go easily. On 12 September in Wellingborough he was thumped and "considerabl[y]" harmed while battling. As a precautionary measure he circulated about ÃÅ20,000 () among the electorate and the seat was won, though as "junior part" to his Whig rival. 

He was presenting with his regiment in India in 1837 and did not look for re-appointment at the general decision that year; a couple of days after it occurred he acquired the earldom from his dad, together with the broad family bequests, including Deene Park. 

Right off the bat during the 1820s Brudenell met Mrs. Elizabeth Tollemache Johnstone (8 December 1797 Ã¢ÂÂ 15 July 1858). Her better half, Lt.- Col. Christian Johnstone, had been a companion of Cardigan's since adolescence, be that as it may, as per the record of Johnstone's mom, the charming of his companion's new spouse began not long after the wedding. Johnstone began separate from procedures in June 1824 and the suit was concluded right off the bat in 1826. Johnstone, who had gotten harms of ÃÅ1,000 from Brudenell, was obviously glad to be freed of her, calling her "the most accursed terrible tempered and unrestrained bitch in the kingdom". She and Cardigan wedded on 19 June 1826. It was anything but an upbeat marriage; they had no kids, and by 1837 they had isolated. 

In the wake of leaving his first spouse, Elizabeth, he wedded for a second time, on 20 September 1858, to Adeline de Horsey, accomplishing still more noteworthy reputation as he had been directing an illicit relationship with her as his significant other was passing on. This, in any case, was an upbeat association, despite the divergence in their ages and Cardigan's mistake that there were, once more, no youngsters. Adeline, barred from elegant society for the remainder of her life, acclimated herself to life in the nation, cheerfully neglecting her past advantages of books, painting and music, while Cardigan spent extensive entireties of cash making their home together agreeable. Adeline even stayed on great terms with Cardigan's foremost escort, Maria Marchioness of Ailesbury, and endured his different undertakings. 

Past every other intrigue, which included legislative issues and the conservation of the old benefits of the gentry against the atmosphere of the period, Brudenell subscribed to a vocation in the military. At 22 years old, as a skipper in the Northamptonshire Yeomanry Cavalry, he shaped his very own troop of pony, outfitted from authority stocks, to prepare for conceivable reformist shows in Northamptonshire. On 6 May 1824, at 27 years old, he joined the eighth King's Royal Irish Hussars. Utilizing the buy of commissions framework at that point being used, he turned into a lieutenant in January 1825, a skipper in June 1826, a noteworthy in August 1830 and a lieutenant-colonel, though on half-pay, just three months after the fact, on 3 December 1830. He got direction of the fifteenth The King's HussarsÃ¢ÂÂat a revealed premium of ÃÅ35,000 ()Ã¢ÂÂon 16 March 1832. 

Parliamentary business, as the fervently challenged Reform Bill battle, deferred his taking direction until May. His childhood and inability, contrasted and that of the fight tried officers whom he drove (some were veterans of the skirmish of Waterloo) drew his normally careful nature to show itself in negligible disapproved of tormenting. In 1833 he was freely rebuked for "reprehensible...conduct" in a court military held to decide charges he had laid against Captain Augustus Wathen, a subordinate. Brudenell was rejected, by close to home request of King William (who agreed with "Master Hill's equitable judgment"), right off the bat in 1834. He had, notwithstanding, impact at court and he asked his sister Harriet, wedded to Queen Adelaide's chamberlain, Lord Howe, to get the choice turned around. He annoyed senior officers and lawmakers until in March 1836 he was permitted order of the eleventh Light Dragoons (later restyled the eleventh Hussars), despite the perspective on his president, Lord Hill, that he was "unavoidably unfit for direction". After a lackadaisical section with his significant other, he joined his new order in India in October of the next year, in the nick of time to appreciate some tiger-shooting before observing the regiment off for Britain toward the finish of its long posting. He voyaged independently in a procured vessel, despising to share the inconveniences of the warship conveying his troops. Of the two years following his arrangement, just a month were gone through with his regiment. 

It was in India that Brudenell gotten word that, resulting on the passing of his dad on 14 August 1837, he had acquired the title of seventh Earl of Cardigan. 

In an authentic want to lead a keen and productive unit, Cardigan start utilizing his very own fortune to improve his regiment's notoriety and execution. George Ryan, an author generally exceptionally reproachful of Cardigan, evaluated that he spent about ÃÅ10,000 () a year towards remounts and unmistakable uniform for his troops. In buying splendid new regalia for his men, Cardigan caused disdain among his expert officers; they needed to coordinate the men's clothing with significantly increasingly exorbitant garbs (a Hussar officer's coat, for instance, cost ÃÅ40Ã¢ÂÂ) and officers needed to purchase their own. He wanted his officers to be as highborn, ostentatious and in vogue as he was himself and as a result he possessed no energy for those menÃ¢ÂÂ"Indian officers"Ã¢ÂÂwho had taken in their calling over numerous long periods of administration with the eleventh amid its long presenting on India. This demeanor was especially in proof in the wreckage: Cardigan had prohibited the serving of doorman, the refreshment of decision among the expert officers, and when at a formal chaos supper a guest had mentioned Moselle wine, which was served in a "dark jug" like that of watchman, he chose that the "Indian" Captain John Reynolds, who had requested it for the visitor, was opposing him. Reynolds was captured and at the appointed time got an emphatic impugn from Lord Hill, who albeit secretly trusting that his second thoughts about Cardigan had been very much established, felt that, in light of a legitimate concern for good request and order, an open showing of help was important. Reynolds' watchman sent the subtleties of the case to all the London papers and for a long time from that point Brudenell, his regiment and the president were liable to disparagement, murmuring and heckles of "dark container" at whatever point they showed up out in the open. A progressively genuine discipline was managed to Richard Reynolds, cousin to John Reynolds and another long-serving chief, who was court-martialled for sending Cardigan a "rebellious" letter because of being banished from his boss' quarters. Slope drafted a solid reminder asking Cardigan to utilize "temper and circumspection" in dealings with his officers, yet Reynolds was cashiered. 

Not the majority of the "Indian" officers of the eleventh got themselves the object of Cardigan's disapproval: when, in October 1840, Major Jenkins, a long-serving veteran, fell genuinely sick, Cardigan went to his bedside for two evenings and, when he kicked the bucket, made a considerable installment to the family and verified an appropriate position for his more youthful child. George Ryan recognized his liberality towards his officers and men when in hardship and noted him to be a standard, mysterious supporter of numerous municipal philanthropies. 

Cardigan was arraigned in 1841 for a duel with one of his previous officers, another long-serving proficient. He was vindicated on a legitimate detail, despite his gloat on capture that "I have hit my man". The arraignment had shown that Cardigan - utilizing a dueling gun with covered rifling and a hair trigger (provided by the Mayfair gunsmiths Manton and Hudson) which was thought unsporting as indicated by the uses of dueling - had discharged upon Captain Harvey Tuckett. The prosecution, in any case, was that the unfortunate casualty had been "Harvey Garnet Phipps Tuckett". Proof was gotten from a military operator paying Tuckett's military annuity this was undoubtedly the full name of Captain Tuckett of the eleventh Hussars, yet the inconsistency in the wording of the charge permitted the jury of his companions, 120 in number, collectively to vindicate him; as an aristocrat the law of the time enabled him to be striven for a capital wrongdoing before the House of Lords sitting as a jury, with the Lord High Steward as judge. This additional to his disagreeability, with "The Times" charging that there was conscious, abnormal state complicity to leave the proviso in the arraignment case and revealing the view that "in England there is one law for the rich and another for poor people" and "The Examiner" portraying the decision as "a thrashing of equity". Indeed, even his eulogy portrayed this avoidance of equity as "a ridiculous specialized lack". 

His most famous endeavor occurred amid the Crimean War on 25 October 1854 when, in direction of the Light Cavalry Brigade at the clash of Balaclava, he drove the Charge of the Light Brigade achieving the Russian firearms before returning, actually sound, in a move that cost the lives of around 107 out of the 674 men under his order who partook in the charge (in spite of the fact that others may have passed on of wounds later on). The degree to which Lord Cardigan was at fault is dubious, since he assaulted simply subsequent to communicating his questions and getting an immediate request before the troops from his quick predominant Lord Lucan, officer of the Cavalry Division. The two men were scarcely on talking terms as Lucan was hitched to one of Cardigan's sisters and, as Cardigan accepted, did not treat her well. The request had been passed on by Captain Louis Nolan, who kicked the bucket in the charge, and both Lucan and Cardigan censured him for passing on the request mistakenly. Cardigan's first activity on his arrival from the charge was to report the unrestrained conduct of Captain Nolan (whom he didn't know to be dead) in riding in front of him toward the beginning of the assault. 

A staff officer to armed force authority Lord Raglan, Colonel the Hon. Somerset John Gough Calthorpe, claimed in his book "Letters from a Staff Officer in the Crimea" that Cardigan had endure simply because he had fled the scene before the accuse reached of the foe. In his first release, Calthorpe permitted that Cardigan's steed may have blasted, however later versions distinctly expressed the duke was too fine a horseman for this to be an acceptable clarification. The steed, "Ronald", a celebrated charger reared on Cardigan's Deene Park domain, endure the war and returned securely to England. After some starter lawful skirmishing, Cardigan looked for a prosecution for criminal criticism in 1863, however his activity fizzled, in spite of the fact that the seat made plain that it was just his ability, and not his strength, that was in uncertainty. They found that he had driven his men onto the foe's weapons with "valour...conspicuously showed" however from that point "his lead as a General was available to analysis". This end is shared by student of history Alexander Kinglake, who infers that in spite of the fact that Cardigan showed a "want...of fitness" after the charge, he had lost contact with his men just through his courageous perseverance in jogging excessively a long ways in front of them. 

There is no uncertainty that Cardigan had come to and overwhelmed the foe battery: he was perceived past the weapons by Prince Leon Hieronim RadziwiÄºÂÄºÂ (), a foe officer with whom he was familiar before the war; RadziwiÄºÂÄºÂ issued directions that Cardigan was to be taken prisoner and not slaughtered. Cardigan, considering his obligation at that point done and abhorring, as he later clarified, to "battle the foe among private warriors", turned about and advanced relentlessly - he himself said that his arrival was at the stroll to maintain a strategic distance from any boorish appearance of flurry - for his own lines. Lucan reviewed things in an unexpected way, later giving proof that Cardigan had been jogging back, possibly easing back to walk when he understood he was being viewed. This rushed retreat was additionally seen by General Liprandi, Russian administrator, who made enquiries to distinguish the English officer whom he saw dashing endlessly after the assault. Officers and men of the second and third lines - men for whom as detachment administrator Cardigan stayed capable - were all the while progressing at the charge when they saw their leader riding in retreat. Different officers also had seen his nonappearance and when Lord George Paget of the fourth Hussars, one of the last to return after some extreme, hand-to-hand battling, experienced a "formed" Cardigan, he provoked him to represent himself. Unsatisfied with the reaction, Paget composed an official grumbling to the new Commander-in-Chief, the Duke of Cambridge. Cambridge sent the letter to Cardigan for input and Cardigan's answer thusly whined that Paget had not in truth taken the part he guaranteed amid the assault that day. Uncertain case and counter-guarantee pursued, until Cardigan's considerations were redirected to the charges made open when Calthorpe's book "Letters" went on special. 

In the week following the clash of Balaclava, the leftovers of the Light Brigade were posted inland, to high ground managing the British lines encompassing Inkerman. Cardigan, who had burned through most evenings of the battle on board his extravagance yacht "Dryad" in Balaclava harbor, discovered this move an incredible burden and his authority of the detachment endured therefore. He missed the Battle of Inkerman (4 and 5 November 1854), calmly asking columnist William Russell (who was coming back from the contention) "What's happening with they, what was the terminating for...?" as he rode up from the harbor around early afternoon on the main day. The definitive phases of the fight were on the second day and again Cardigan was missing, in spite of the fact that he figured out how to land at a progressively respectable 10.15Ã¢Â am. The part played by the detachment was not extraordinary and, to abstain from humiliating the duke, it was not referenced in the official record of the fight sent to London. 

Whatever Cardigan's flaws, he had constantly attempted to guarantee that the troops under his order were very much prepared. Be that as it may, as the Crimean winter fell over the Light Brigade's uncovered position, sustenance, feed, dress and safe house were all hard to find. Past composition letters calling attention to the inadequacies, Cardigan did nothing. Sustenance and grub were accessible at the coast, yet he wouldn't discharge any men and steeds to convey up stores, as his officers argued, in the event of an unexpected assault by the foe and on the grounds that "I had no requests to do as such". Colonel Alexander Tulloch, who offered proof to a leading group of enquiry into the disappointment, noticed that in truth Cardigan had a bigger number of steeds than he had required: for sure a bigger number of ponies than men to ride them, and composed secretly after his proof was avoided from the last report: "Since Lord Cardigan may have had some trouble in conveying up all the grain to which his corps was entitled he [resolved himself] along these lines supported in raising none." There was incredible hardship and numerous ponies passed on. 

On 5 December 1854, refering to sick wellbeing, Cardigan set off for England. In these conditions, the expression of an officer in regards to his wellness to serve would ordinarily be acknowledged, yet Raglan allowed his takeoff simply after a therapeutic board had affirmed his asserted handicap. 

News records of the brave charge had been given wide course in England when Cardigan's ship berthed at the port of Folkestone on 13 January 1855 and the town offered him a happy welcome. In London he was mobbed by an eager group and on 16 January at Queen Victoria's welcome he was gotten at Windsor to disclose to her and Prince Albert the subtleties of the fight. Victoria noticed how "unobtrusively" he introduced his story, yet this hesitance was missing in his open appearances: on 5 February, he gave an exceedingly overstated record of his investment in the charge at a feast held in his respect at the Mansion House, London. On 8 February, at a discourse in the place where he grew up of Northampton, he went considerably further, depicting how he had shared the privations of his men by living the "entire time in a typical tent" and how, after the charge, he had mobilized his troops and sought after the escaping adversary artillerymen to the extent the Tchernaya stream. As his biographer Saul David calls attention to, "an all the more deceptive record of his own adventures could scarcely have been given". 

Cardigan had the capacity to appreciate numerous long stretches of idolization before questions about his direct developed: He was made Inspector-General of Cavalry, the legislature suggested him for the Order of the Garter, in spite of the fact that the Queen denied him this respect in view of the past graceless occurrences in his private life; he was designated Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He was likewise made Commander of the French Legion of Honor on 2 August 1856 and Knight (below average) of the Turkish Order of Medjidie on 2 March 1858. 

Dealers, anxious to benefit from his distinction, sold pictures delineating his job in the charge and composed narratives, in view of his own records, were hurried into print. The "cardigan", a sewed petticoat apparently as worn by the lord on crusade, ended up in vogue and many were sold. 

Cardigan's leader and brother by marriage, Lord Lucan, had been reviewed in disgraceÃ¢ÂÂlargely achieved by the assurance of the president, Lord Raglan, to dislodge fault from himselfÃ¢ÂÂ and landed in England just two weeks after his subordinate however, as the officer who had "looked on" (a joke on his name much abused via Cardigan) while the charge had occurred, little respect was given to his adaptation of occasions. (Lucan had earned the lamentable moniker of "Master Look-on" when Lord Raglan requested him to pull back, and stay for possible later use, amid an engagement at the Bulganek River before the prior Battle of Alma.) In July 1855, "The Times" indicated that the open had been deceived over "the genuine idea of [Cardigan's] benefits in the East", at the same time, without anything authoritative, his prominence remained. In any case, officers who had taken order in the result of the charge, the job that Cardigan was guaranteeing for himself, had known about his gathering in England and were on edge to put the record straight. The author George Ryan, who had hurried out a rushed flyer adulating Cardigan, withdrew his words, and was the first to report Cardigan's individual officers' doubts about the duke's direct on the day. As the warriors themselves came back to England, the questions solidified. It was not until the next year, nonetheless, with the official enquiries of Colonel Tulloch and the distribution of Calthorpe's "Letters", was there evidence that Cardigan had not been coming clean. In any case he proceeded, with trademark presumption and self-hallucination, as though nothing was out of order and he stayed in his rangers post for the following five years. "Eight months on dynamic administration, or, A journal of a general officer of mounted force, in 1854", distributed in 1855, was Cardigan's own record of his time in the Crimea. 

Cardigan's mind-boggling excitement for the military remained and the fastidious principles of dress and march that he had expected of his before directions he presently connected to the entire rangers. He was made Colonel of the Regiment of the fifth Dragoon Guards in 1859, yet he determined more fulfillment when, after his formal retirement in 1860, and its going with advancement to Lieutenant-General, he progressed toward becoming colonel of his preferred regiment, the eleventh Hussars, which he had first directed in 1836. He stayed in imperial support and from the get-go in 1861 he was chosen to go with the Prince of Wales, beneficiary to the position of royalty, to investigate Prussian mounted force moves. He was perhaps an indiscreet decision as his egotistical conduct towards his hosts, themselves no outsiders to high confidence among military officers, brought about various difficulties to duel; he was rapidly sent home. The Queen, nonetheless, obstructed his colonelcy of one of the Household regiments in light of his dalliance with Adeline while still wedded to Elizabeth. His last military capacity was a mounted audit of the eleventh Hussars before their embarkation for India in May 1866. He was joined by Colonel John Reynolds, who had been Cardigan's enemy in the "dark container issue", however the men had finally settled their disparities in the earlier year. 

After his retirement in 1866, he lived joyfully at Deene, breathing easy with steed dashing, chasing and shooting. He remained an individual from the Royal Yacht Squadron and was Commodore of the Royal Southern Yacht Club. 

His parliamentary life proceeded, with the incidental invasion to London to talk in the House of Lords on military issues and to keep on squeezing for further authority acknowledgment of his great profession. In 1866 he was, with Thomas Carlyle, one of the coordinators of open shows of help for Edward Eyre, disputable Governor of Jamaica, against claims that he had managed too cruelly with the Morant Bay resistance of the past October. He shocked a few pundits when, in 1867, he talked for the second Reform Bill. In recognizing his difference in heart he said that the ideal opportunity for attempting to stem the tide of change, an undertaking in which he had since quite a while ago strived, had passed and given "good karma" the expansion of the vote would "present... an incredible advantage upon each class of the network". In 1868 he displayed to the House an appeal requiring extra acknowledgment of the late General Henry Shrapnel, creator of the unstable cannons shell, in acknowledgment of its viability at Waterloo. 

He kicked the bucket from wounds brought about by a tumble from his pony on 28 March 1868, conceivably following a stroke, and was covered in the family vaults at St Peter's Church, Deene. He was prevailing in his title by his second cousin, George William Brudenell-Bruce, who kicked the bucket childless in 1878. 

After the passing of his widow in 1915, Deene Park returned to the relatives of George William's more youthful sibling, Ernest Augustus Charles. 

Evaluations of Lord Cardigan have changed altogether after some time. The ninth version (1889) of the "EncyclopÄÅdia Britannica" noticed that his activities at Balaclava had turned into "the subject of much discussion, a few faultfinders having an eye just to the awe inspiring brave and unquestioning submission to requests, and others seeing just an imprudent and ridiculous discarding of significant lives", while the eleventh release (1910Ã¢ÂÂ11) rethought the entry to peruse that "Cardigan and his men alike have been credited by the bitterest commentators of the accuse of astonishing brave and unquestioning acquiescence to orders". 

In her general judgment of the Victorian class framework, "The Reason Why (1953)," Cecil Woodham-Smith utilized the Earl as a crystal on the ills of British society of the time (yet yielded that in the Charge itself Cardigan maintained faithful bravery and order). Donald Thomas' 1974 history "Cardigan: The Hero of Balaclava" gave an increasingly thoughtful depiction. Saul David's 1997 unfriendly evaluation, then again, was entitled just "The Homicidal Earl". Terry Brighton's 2005 book "Damnation Riders: The Truth about the Charge of the Light Brigade" gives a later basic record of Cardigan as a unit administrator yet discovers him not the slightest bit to fault for the charge. 

"The Charge of the Light Brigade", a 1968 film dependent on Woodham-Smith's exploration, made Cardigan (played by Trevor Howard) its essential rival. The motion picture portrays Cardigan as an unforgiving drill sergeant, womanizer and military uncouth. It demonstrates the "dark jug" issue, however it erroneously makes Louis Nolan Cardigan's enemy, and vigorously includes his contention with Lord Lucan. It additionally falsely indicates Cardigan seeking after an issue with Fanny Duberly. 

George MacDonald Fraser's "The Flashman Papers" books include Cardigan as a common lowlife. In the primary portion, he directions Flashman in the eleventh Hussars and exchanges him to India after he weds Elspeth in light of the fact that she is the little girl of a tradesman. Cardigan returns in "Flashman at the Charge", where Flashman finds Cardigan attempting to tempt Elspeth. Flashman later reluctantly joins Cardigan for the Charge of the Light Brigade. He shows up quickly in "Flashman in the Great Game", where Cardigan requests Flashman guard Cardigan's notoriety against antagonistic writers. Flashman rejects as well as distinctly affronts Cardigan. His last notice comes in "Flashman and the Angel of the Lord", where Flashman watches Cardigan's contact with Fanny Paget. 

Cardigan shows up as a foe in the 2015 computer game "Professional killer's Creed Syndicate" by Ubisoft, set in 1868. In the amusement, Cardigan is an individual from the Templar Order who headed a plot to kill the Prime-Minister Benjamin Disraeli. The lead character, Jacob Frye, finds the plot, averts Disraeli's passing lastly finds and murders Cardigan.
