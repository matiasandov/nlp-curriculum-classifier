After the whole Hayami family gets away from the ship with Danbei's fly pack, Honey develops alive from inside a falling rock.

The principal anime manifestation of "Cutie Honey" was communicated from October 13, 1973 to March 30, 1974, close by the Go Nagai "Cutie Honey" manga that had begun distributing on October 1, 1973. Fred Patten wrote in the liner notes for Rhino Entertainment's CD "The Best of Anime" (1998) that the arrangement, even untranslated, was a most loved among early anime fan clubs for its naked change groupings and allusions. Indeed, even as brief bareness wound up ordinary in 1980s anime, the proceeded with prominence of "Nectar" roused "New Cutie Honey" creation in 1994. Toei Video declared the arrangement in a question and answer session dated October 12, 1993, with Go Nagai, arrangement executive Yasuchika Nagaoka, Hitomi (the lead artist of the gathering les 5-4-3-2-1, who play out the arrangement's Japanese signature tune), and Honey and Chokkei's Japanese voice on-screen characters Neya and Matsumoto in participation. 

The Japanese name of the arrangement, , turned out to be formally romanized as "New Super Android Cutey Honey" or "New Cutey Honey". It has additionally been spelled with "Cutie" rather than "Cutey". Not at all like the first "Cutie Honey", the arrangement is an "OVA" (unique video movement), one made for home video configurations, for example, VHS tape. OVAs are known for their higher quality than anime TV arrangement, and Toei felt the new "Nectar" was particularly top notch on the grounds that (as per them) every scene utilized ten thousand cels, multiple times the standard number. By November 1994, arrangement organizer Naoko Takahashi said that "Nectar" was likely set to last twelve scenes, with additional to be viewed as later, however the arrangement was stopped at the eighth scene, discharged in late November 1995. A few scenes in that scene have unshaded forefronts, somewhat drawn characters with missing legs, or both. A content for an arranged ninth scene was delivered as a show CD voiced by the arrangement's unique voice on-screen characters.

In a post at the "Anime on DVD" gatherings, voice on-screen character and author George ManleyÃ¢ÂÂwho has worked for the Houston-based ADVÃ¢ÂÂpraised both Neya and Calvello's work in "Nectar" as instances of "amazing" exhibitions, and said that the arrangement, whose name was discharged four years before he started voice work, "was the title, and I regularly concede this, that took me back to watching anime and began me on a lengthy, difficult experience to, 'Stunning, I wonder what may occur on the off chance that I moved to Houston... 

At the 1994 Anime America show, Nagai discussed the differentiation among Honey and the dull Cosplay City: "I thought... all things considered, what might Honey-chan do in the event that she showed up in a dull advanced city like in BATMAN. In the film BATMAN, everything is dull. Dim foundation and dull characters. Notwithstanding, on account of Honey-chan, sheÃ¢ÂÂs too happy and bright. She truly emerges because of the dull foundation." He trusted that "New Cutie Honey" varied from other anime that emphasis on settings and characters' works, and that Honey rather "makes her very own moves, and she conveys the entire story". On the general shortcoming of male characters in the arrangement, he stated, "Nectar chan resembles a mother, and she wants to secure feeble men. Their reality is her motivation to live, similar to goodness, 'I need to battle to ensure you. 

"Nectar" pays respect to a portion of Nagai's different manifestations, for example, the "Mazinger" and "Devilman" arrangement; the initial two scenes alone incorporate numerous appearances. The principal indicates Mayor Light and Chokkei in an image with characters from Nagai's "Harenchi Gakuen", "Iyahaya Nantomo", and "Oira Sukeban", while "Devilman" main character shows up as a figure of deformity.

The opening arrangement utilized in the initial four scenes indicates variants of Honey's unique seven structures in the TV arrangement: Kisaragi, Hurricane, Misty, Idol, Flash, Fancy, and Cutie. Danbei's procedures spoof those of Nagai's super robots Mazinger Z and Grendizer. Later scenes highlight appearances by Akira Fudo of "Devilman" and Professor Kabuto of "Mazinger Z". In scene 7, Honey changes herself into Kouji Kabuto. The title grouping of scenes 5 through 8 highlights Sirene, Devilman's foe, and Akira Fudo of "Devilman" alongside Mazinger Z's Juzo Kabuto.

Chris Beveridge of "Anime on DVD" (presently part of "Mania.com") gave positive surveys to the two "New Cutey Honey Collections" discharged in 2000 by ADV; he "was truly inspired with the generation estimations of this show" and called it "a considerable amount of fun, particularly for those searching for fan-administration with more knowledge and style than a portion of different contributions out there". Two surveys of "Nectar" on the site "Anime Jump" incredibly separated: site maintainer Mike Toole appraised the arrangement 3.5 out of 5 stars and called it "huge amounts of fun, a light, scrumptious activity parody that'sÃ¢Â ... lively and senseless and whimsical", and lauded its character structures as "letter-immaculate to Go Nagai's unique (very engaging!) character plans"; Jason Carter applauded Calvello's voice work in his audit of the 2004 ADV discharge, however evaluated it 1.5 out of 5 stars, said that a lot of Cosplay City "returns and forward between resembling a customary present day city and looking like some kind of Smurf town worked of contaminated marshmallows", and finished up "The characters are to a great extent irritating, the plot is overdone, the bareness is preposterous, the battling is once in a while more than normal, and the entire thing is eventually trivial - as the arrangement's later endeavors at creating Honey as an individual make very clear." Sandra Dozier of "DVD Verdict" was additionally unmoved with "Nectar": "I can perceive any reason why it is popularÃ¢ÂÂthe lustrous liveliness, the plentifully supplied chicks, the meager apparel. On the off chance that that isn't your thing, notwithstanding, there is next to no to attract you to this arrangement." 

Commentators have seen Go Nagai's effect on "New Cutie Honey"; a few considered it among the best anime dependent on his works, while others favored distinctive arrangement. Dozier said that Nagai is "perceived in the anime world as a compelling craftsman and storyteller who is known for inclining toward additional helpings of nakedness and viciousness in his work", and that such impact "unquestionably comes through" in the arrangement. Carlos Ross of "THEM Anime" gave prior Nagai anime terrible evaluations, however called "Nectar" "another Go Nagai-based anime that normal rationale should manage that THEM rate brutally - then again, actually we really delighted in it tremendously", while calling its "outrageously monstrous backgrounds, and abnormal looking characters" "standard Go Nagai". Beveridge says he enormously favored "Nectar" over other Nagai contributions, yet that "it truly doesn't ascend an excessive amount of higher than not at all subtle fan administration with something of a story". Scott Green of "Ain't It Cool News" adulated "Nagai's bland feeling of peculiarity" as the arrangement's "highpoint", saying its "brilliant American style hero plan, with multicolored peculiarity, hilariously unwarranted nakedness and viciousness" make it "diverting rubbish". In his negative survey, Carter said the "Devilman"- based "Fiend Lady" was an all the more engaging anime with a comparative "astonishingly constructed lady battling beasts" premise. 

Numerous analysts likewise differentiated its depiction of primary character Honey as an amazing figure with how it additionally flaunts her body through her bare change groupings. Susan J. Napier, creator of "", separated the arrangement from increasingly explicit anime, for example, "Mischievous City", "Twin Dolls", and "La Blue Girl". Napier imagined that the arrangement "sends blended messages" on the grounds that despite the fact that Honey has extraordinary quality and gallantry, her changes are exceptionally sexual in nature. She composed that "the apparently male watcher is welcomed in, to take an interest in the unclothing and dress of her bare body, while both male and female watcher alike are permitted the vicarious cooperation in the euphoric change process", however immediately included: "In spite of the backward and voyeuristic parts of her portrayal, she is still obviously the film's legend, one deserving of profound respect and emulationÃ¢Â ... in the film's few rough scenes she more than stands her ground." Dozier did not share that estimation: she said "Nectar has some intrigue as a contender and as somebody who thinks particularly about the general population who are imperative to her, however her android past and her family life aren't investigated too deeplyÃ¢ÂÂmostly, she's too occupied with getting into trading off circumstances and battling fiendish." 

Both Dozier and Yuricon president Erica Friedman expounded on the sexual idea of "Nectar", including the lesbian want of the Jewel Princess (one of Honey's foes) for her in the second scene. FriedmanÃ¢ÂÂwho had searched for such "inferred yuri" in "Cutie Honey" mangaÃ¢ÂÂcalled the Princess' appearance "*just* what I was seeking after", and lauded Honey's change to her S&M Queen structure accordingly. Ross said about the arrangement: "It's apparently exploitative, it's extraordinarily misogynist, and the female individuals from my family unit - you'd anticipate that them should be resentful, at the same time, no, they were ignoring their butts since it was so unmitigated, but then Honey was very generalized in the entire arrangement." He further expresses, "Nectar Kisaragi is an incredibly solid character who is no lady in trouble. On the off chance that anybody needs assistance in this arrangement, it's the folks!" Toole said that Jessica Calvello "gives the character a snarling, intense young lady engage that was prominently missing from the first form", while Dozier said that Calvello caught "the blend of honesty and bluster [of Honey] that is both so befuddling but so suitable". Beveridge said the "battle arrangements are quite very much done and give some fun minutes watching Honey fight the different devilish structures", however presumed that "Nectar" principle objective is to feature the lead courageous woman's changes: "Goodness, let's be honest. it's about the half to totally bare change arrangements. They're grrreat!"
