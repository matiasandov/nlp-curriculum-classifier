With regards to the North American arrival of that form, the references to the Nazi party found in the first Japanese title are not included in "Rearmed". In any case, just like the case in the first, the last supervisor of the amusement still obviously looks like Adolf Hitler, and is alluded to as "The Leader". 

"Rearmed" bases on two warring groups: the Federation and the Empire.

While "Bionic Commando Rearmed" remains for the most part consistent with its NES partner, various interactivity improvements were made. A wellbeing bar replaces the diversion's unique wellbeing arrangement of a constrained wellbeing pool which develops in the wake of gathering projectiles from vanquished adversaries. Players gather wellbeing things from adversaries to reestablish wellbeing, instead of the first framework which included winning more hit focuses. Crushing foes with full wellbeing currently grants players additional focuses, urging players to abstain from being hit so as to get high scores.

Weapons would now be able to be changed in a split second amid ongoing interaction, rather than being constrained to one weapon for each mission. Manager fights have additionally been overhauled.
