Quick expressed "Tim McGraw" amid her first year, realizing that she and her senior beau, Brandon Borello, would separate toward the year's end when he left for school. Rose said Swift appeared at her after school work composing tunes for Sony/ATV "with the thought and the tune. She knew precisely what she needed." The nostalgic melody depicts a late spring sentiment and Swift's expectation that when Borello "think[s] Tim McGraw" he would "think [her] main tune" Ã¢ÂÂ McGraw's "Can't Tell Me Nothin" Ã¢ÂÂ and recall her. On the other hand, "Picture to Burn" depicts a young lady enraged after a separation. Quick says that while the tune is about "simply being frantic" and is "totally, severely legit"; she gave it a comedic edge. While at work after school, Swift "got [her]self simply staying there with [her] guitar going, 'I despise his inept truck that he doesn't give me a chance to drive. He's such a redneck! Goodness my God!'," a line which formed into the tune's chorale. The up-rhythm melody is overwhelming with banjos and drums, while the tune is set apart by twisted guitars and huge vocals. 

The vocalist wrote the personal melody "The Outside" as an outlet at age twelve, the year she started thinking of her own tunes.

Quick remarked, "I generally felt that one of the greatest ignored issues American young ladies face is instability."

"Mary's Song (Oh My)" was really roused by her adjacent neighbors' durable marriage, being the opposite sensationalist newspapers focus on. Quick expressed "Our Song" for her first year of secondary school ability appear without any goals of including it on the collection. She guaranteed she "just knew there was something about it" and included it on "Taylor Swift". "I composed it about this person I was dating, and how we didn't have a melody.

While recording her demo collection, Swift worked with demo maker Nathan Chapman, whom she met in a little shed behind a distributing organization she was at. Quick stated, "I'd generally go in there and play him some new melodies, and the following week he would have this great track, on which he played each instrument, and it seemed like a record. We did this for a time of a year to two years before I got my record bargain." 

To record "Taylor Swift", she needed to pick which collection maker she would work with: "At that point, out of the blue, it was, 'alright, we're going to utilize this maker' or 'We're going to utilize that maker.'" After exploring different avenues regarding diverse makers, starting from Nashville, Swift picked Chapman as a result of the novel sound he put into melodies.
