French war vessel Henri IV 

Henri IV was a pre-gunboat war vessel of the French Navy worked to test a portion of the thoughts of the noticeable maritime engineer Louis-ÄÂmile Bertin. She started World War I as guardship at Bizerte. She was sent to strengthen the Allied maritime power in the Dardanelles battle of 1915, albeit a portion of her auxiliary combat hardware had been expelled for move to Serbia in 1914. A short time later, she was consigned to second-line jobs before being sent to Taranto as a station transport in 1918. She was struck from the naval force list in 1920 and rejected the next year. 

"Henri IV" was structured by the acclaimed French maritime planner Louis-ÄÂmile Bertin to assess a portion of his thoughts. She was intended to make her a little target and needed the vast majority of the typical back superstructure regular to boats of her period, other than that expected to shield her back turret from being washed out. Her back body had just of freeboard, in spite of the fact that she was developed to the typical upper deck tallness amidships and at the bow for better ocean keeping and to accommodate her group. Her superstructure was limited and recessed from the body over the primary deck. 

"Henri IV" was littler than her ancestors, at by and large. She had a light emission a greatest draft of . She was fundamentally lighter than the "Charlemagne"- class warships and uprooted just typically, some not exactly the prior boats. Her group comprised of 26 officers and 438 enrolled men. 

"Henri IV" had three vertical triple-extension steam motors, each driving one propeller shaft. The motors were evaluated at utilizing steam given by 24 Niclausse boilers and gave a top speed of . She conveyed a limit of coal that gave her a scope of at a speed of . 

"Henri IV" conveyed her principle combat hardware of two 40-bore Canon de 274 modÄÂ¨le 1893/1896s in two single-firearm turrets, one forward on the upper deck and the other on the primary deck at the back. The weapons shot covering puncturing shots at a gag speed of . 

The ship's optional combat hardware comprised of seven 45-bore Canon de 138 mm ModÄÂ¨le 1893 maritime firearms. Four were mounted in individual casemates on the primary deck; two more were mounted on the sanctuary deck with weapon shields and the last firearm was mounted in a safe house deck turret superfiring over the back principle firearm turret. This was the first superfiring turret in maritime history and, for this situation, was not effective in light of the fact that the barrel of the 138Ã¢Â mm weapon was too short to even think about clearing the locating hood of the turret underneath. These firearms shot shells at gag speeds of . 

Twelve 40-bore Canon de 47 mm ModÄÂ¨le 1885 Hotchkiss weapons were mounted as against torpedo pontoon firearms. They were mounted in stages in the foremast and mainmast and on the superstructure. They terminated a shot at to a greatest scope of . Their hypothetical most extreme rate of flame was fifteen rounds for each moment, however just seven rounds for every moment continued. Two submerged torpedo tubes were additionally conveyed. Precisely which sorts of torpedoes conveyed is obscure, yet the vast majority of the torpedoes in administration amid the war had warheads of , greatest velocities of and most extreme scopes of . 

"Henri IV" had a waterline covering belt of Harvey defensive layer that was high and decreased from the most extreme thickness of that to at the ship's closures. The belt finished shy of the stern in a cross bulkhead. The lower edge of this belt decreased also from in thickness. The upper defensive layer belt was for the most part thick and kept running from the bow to toward the back of the midriff. It was commonly high, yet expanded to advance and finished in a cross bulkhead. The most extreme thickness of the defensively covered deck was , yet decreased to at the ship's finishes. Underneath this was a more slender protected deck that decreased from on the centerline to at the edges. It bended down going to shape a torpedo bulkhead before it got together with the inward base. This framework depended on analyses led in 1894 and was more present day than that utilized in the Russian warship "Tsesarevich" despite the fact that it was still excessively near the side of the ship. The fundamental turret shield was in thickness and the ammo shafts were ensured by of protective layer. The casemates for the 138Ã¢Â mm weapons extended from in thickness and their ammo tubes had of shield. 

"Henri IV" was set down at Cherbourg on 15 July 1897 and propelled on 23 August 1899, yet did not enter administration until September 1903, at an expense of Ã¢ÂÅ15,660,000 francs. The ship spent the early piece of World War I as the guardship at Bizerte, until February 1915 when she was appointed to the recently shaped Syrian Squadron ("escadre de Syrie"). This squadron was expected to assault Turkish positions and lines of correspondence in Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula. "Henri IV" was exchanged to the French squadron in the Dardanelles crusade to supplant the sunk ship and the harmed after the Allies endured vigorously amid their first endeavor to cruise through the Dardanelles and past the strongholds them on 18 March 1915. The ship assaulted Kum Kale, on the Asiatic side of the Dardanelles in help of the French diversionary arriving on 25 April 1915, and gave fire backing to the troops aground for the remainder of the month. She was hit multiple times while offering help amid this time. 

Three of her 138.6Ã¢Â mm weapons had been gotten off by November 1914 and sent to fortify the French maritime mission to Serbia, known as "Mission D", by rail from Salonica. In 1916, she was alloted to the Complementary (Reserve) Division of the third Battle Squadron. In this way she presented with the French Eastern Division in Egypt and afterward she was sent to Taranto in 1918 as a warehouse deliver. "Henri IV" was stricken from the Navy List in 1920 and rejected the next year.
