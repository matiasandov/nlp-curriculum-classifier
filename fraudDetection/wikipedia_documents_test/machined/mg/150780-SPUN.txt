Haakon IV of Norway 

Haakon Haakonsson (c. Walk/April 1204 Ã¢ÂÂ 16 December 1263) (Old Norse: "HÄÄkon HÄÄkonarson"; Norwegian: "HÄÄ¾kon HÄÄ¾konsson"), some of the time called Haakon the Old as opposed to his child with a similar name, and referred to in current regnal records as Haakon IV, was King of Norway from 1217 to 1263. His rule went on for a long time, longer than any Norwegian lord since Harald Fairhair. Haakon was naturally introduced to the grieved common war period in Norway, yet his rule in the end figured out how to put a conclusion to the inward clashes. Toward the beginning of his rule, amid his minority, his later adversary Earl Skule BÄÄ¾rdsson filled in as official. As a ruler of the birkebeiner group, Haakon crushed the uprising of the last bagler regal actor, Sigurd Ribbung, in 1227. He put a complete end to the common war time when he had Skule BÄÄ¾rdsson killed in 1240, a year after he had himself broadcasted lord contrary to Haakon. Haakon from there on formally selected his own child as his co-official. 

Under Haakon's standard, medieval Norway is considered to have achieved its apex or brilliant age. His notoriety and imposing maritime armada enabled him to keep up companionships with both the pope and the Holy Roman Emperor, in spite of their contention. He was at various focuses offered the supreme crown by the pope, the Irish high authority by a designation of Irish rulers, and the order of the French crusader armada by the French lord. He intensified the impact of European culture in Norway by bringing in and making an interpretation of contemporary European writing into Old Norse, and by developing momentous European-style stone structures. Related to this he utilized a functioning and forceful remote approach, and toward the finish of his standard included Iceland and the Norse Greenland people group to his kingdom, leaving Norway at its regional tallness. In spite of the fact that he for the minute figured out how to verify Norwegian control of the islands off the northern and western shores of Great Britain, he became sick and kicked the bucket while wintering in Orkney following some military commitment with the extending Scottish kingdom. 

The fundamental wellspring of data concerning Haakon is the "Adventure of Haakon Haakonsson", which was written in the quick years following his passing. Authorized by his child Magnus, it was composed by the Icelandic essayist and government official Sturla ÄÂÄÅrÄÂ°arson (nephew of the acclaimed history specialist Snorri Sturluson). Having collided with the imperial agent in Iceland, Sturla came to Norway in 1263 trying to accommodate with Haakon. When he arrived, he discovered that Haakon was in Scotland, and that Magnus ruled Norway in his place. While Magnus at first took an antagonistic demeanor towards Sturla, his abilities as a story-teller and skald in the long run won him the support of Magnus and his men. The adventure is viewed as the most definite and dependable of all adventures concerning Norwegian rulers, expanding on both composed file material and oral data from people who had been near Haakon. It is regardless composed straightforwardly in help of the political program of the House of Sverre, and the authenticity of Haakon's sovereignty. 

Haakon was conceived in Folkenborg (presently in Eidsberg) to Inga of Varteig in the mid year of 1204, likely in March or April. The dad was generally respected to have been King Haakon Sverresson, the pioneer of the birkebeiner group in the continuous common war against the bagler, as Inga had been with Haakon in his lodging in Borg (presently Sarpsborg) in late 1203. Haakon Sverresson was dead when his child Haakon was conceived, yet Inga's case was bolstered by a few of Haakon Sverresson's devotees. Haakon was conceived in bagler-controlled region, and his mom's case put them in a risky position. While the bagler began chasing Haakon, a gathering of birkebeiner warriors fled with the kid in the winter of 1205/06, heading for King Inge BÄÄ¾rdson, the new birkebeiner lord in Nidaros (presently Trondheim). As the gathering was struck by a snowstorm, two of the best birkebeiner skiers, Torstein Skevla and Skjervald Skrukka, continued with the kid over the mountain from Lillehammer to ÄÂsterdalen. They in the end figured out how to convey Haakon to security with King Inge; this specific occasion is recognized in cutting edge Norway by the mainstream yearly skiing occasion "Birkebeinerrennet". Haakon's sensational youth was frequently parallelled with that of previous ruler Olaf Tryggvasson (who acquainted Christianity with Norway), just as with the accounts and Child Jesus, which filled in as an imperative ideological capacity for his sovereignty. 

In the adventure, Haakon is depicted as splendid and clever, and as being little for his age. When he was three years of age, Haakon was caught by the bagler yet wouldn't call the bagler ruler Philip Simonsson his master (he in any case originated from the catch safe). When he learned at eight years old that King Inge and his sibling Earl Haakon the Crazy had made an understanding of the progression to the position of royalty that barred himself, he called attention to that the understanding was invalid because of his lawyer not having been available. He along these lines recognized his lawyer as "God and Saint Olaf." Haakon was quite the main Norwegian ruler to get formal instruction at a school. From the late thoughtful war period, the administration organization depended progressively on composed correspondence, which thusly requested educated pioneers. At the point when Haakon was in Bergen under the consideration of Haakon the Crazy, he began accepting training from the age of seven, likely at the Bergen Cathedral School. He proceeded with his training under King Inge at the Trondheim Cathedral School after the Earl's demise in 1214. Haakon was raised close by Inge's child Guttorm, and they were treated as the equivalent. When he was eleven, a portion of Haakon's companions incited the ruler by requesting that he give Haakon an area to oversee. At the point when Haakon was drawn nearer by the men and was encouraged to wage war against Inge, he dismissed it to some extent as a result of his young age and its terrible prospects, just as on the grounds that he trusted it would be ethically wrong to battle Inge and along these lines split the birkebeiner. He rather said that he asked that God would give him a lot of his dad's legacy when all was good and well. 

In the wake of King Inge's demise in 1217, a debate emitted over who was to turned into his successor. Notwithstanding Haakon who picked up the help of most of the birkebeiners including the veterans who had served under his dad and granddad, applicants incorporated Inge's ill-conceived child Guttorm (who dropped out very soon), Inge's relative Earl Skule BÄÄ¾rdsson who had been selected pioneer of the lord's "hird" at Inge's deathbed and was bolstered by the Archbishop of Nidaros just as a major aspect of the birkebeiners, and Haakon the Crazy's child Knut Haakonsson. With his boundless prominent help in TrÄÂ¸ndelag and in Western Norway, Haakon was broadcasted ruler at ÄÂyrating in June 1217. He was later that year hailed as ruler at Gulating in Bergen, and at Haugating, Borgarting and nearby things east of Elven (GÄÅta ÄÂlv). While Skule's supporters at first had endeavored to thrown uncertainty about Haakon's regal lineage, they in the long run suspended open protection from his application. As the debate could have taken steps to part the birkebeiners in two, Skule settled on getting to be official for Haakon amid his minority. 

Regarding the disagreement regarding the imperial race, Haakon's mom Inga needed to demonstrate his parentage through a preliminary by experience in Bergen in 1218. The aftereffect of the preliminary reinforced the legitimate reason for his majesty, and improved his association with the congregation. The adventure's case that Haakon previously had been commonly acknowledged as lord in 1217/18 has anyway been challenged by current students of history, for example, Sverre Bagge. Skule and Haakon progressively floated separated in their organization, and Skule concentrated principally on administering Eastern Norway after 1220, which he had picked up the privilege to manage in 1218 as his third of the Norwegian kingdom. From 1221 to 1223, Haakon and Skule independently issued letters as leaders of Norway, and kept up authority contacts abroad. In 1223 an extraordinary gathering of religious administrators, ministry, mainstream nobles and other high-positioning figures from the whole way across the nation was held in Bergen to at long last choose Haakon's entitlement to the royal position. Different contender to the royal position were available either actually or through lawyers, yet Haakon was at last consistently affirmed as King of Norway by the court. 

The last bagler lord Philip Simonsson passed on in 1217. Rapid political and military manoeuvering by Skule prompted a compromise between the birkebeiner and bagler, and along these lines the reunification of the kingdom. In any case, some malcontented components among the bagler found another imperial actor, Sigurd Ribbung, and propelled another ascending from 1219. The rising just picked up help in parts of Eastern Norway, and were unfit to deal with Viken and Opplandene as the bagler in the past had done. In the mid year of 1223 Skule in the long run figured out how to drive the Ribbungar to surrender. The extraordinary gathering in Bergen not long after anyway reestablished the division of the Norwegian kingdom with Skule, who from that point dealt with the northern third of the nation rather than the east, in what denoted a mishap regardless of his military triumph. In 1224, Ribbung who had been in Skule's care gotten away, and Haakon was disregarded to battle him as the new leader of Eastern Norway. Skule stayed latent all through the remainder of the war, and his help for Haakon was tepid, best case scenario. Expecting the military lead in the battle, Haakon all things considered vanquished Ribbung through extensive and organisationally requesting fighting throughout the following years. As a major aspect of the battle, Haakon moreover drove a substantial armed force into VÄÂ¤rmland, Sweden in 1225 so as to rebuff the occupants for their help of Ribbung. While Ribbung kicked the bucket in 1226, the revolt was at long last suppressed in 1227 after the surrender of the last head of the uprising, Haakon the Crazy's child Knut Haakonsson. This left Haakon pretty much uncontested ruler. 

Haakon's councilors had tried to accommodate Haakon and Skule by proposing marriage among Haakon and Skule's little girl Margrete in 1219. Haakon acknowledged the proposition (despite the fact that he didn't figure it would change much politically), yet the marriage among Haakon and Margrete did not happen before 1225, mostly because of the contention with Ribbung. The connection among Haakon and Skule by and by disintegrated further amid the 1230s, and endeavors of settlements at gatherings in 1233 and 1236 just removed them more from one another. Intermittently, the two regardless accommodated and fraternized, just to have their fellowship pulverized, as indicated by the adventure by interests got from gossipy tidbits and criticism by men who played the two against one another. Skule was the principal individual ever in Norway to be titled Duke ("hertug") in 1237, yet rather than authority over a district picked up the rights to the livelihoods from 33% of the "syssels" dispersed over the entire of Norway. This was a piece of an endeavor by Haakon to constrain Skule's capacity. In 1239 the contention between the two emitted into open fighting when Skule had himself announced ruler. Despite the fact that he had some help in TrÄÂ¸ndelag, Opplandene and in eastern Viken, he couldn't face Haakon's powers. The resistance finished when Skule was executed in 1240, leaving Haakon the undisputed lord of Norway. This revolt is commonly taken to stamp the last end of Norway's considerate war period. 

While the congregation in Norway at first had would not perceive Haakon as King of Norway, it had generally swung to help his case to the honored position by the 1223 gathering, albeit later differences happened. In spite of moreover having turned into the undisputed leader of Norway after 1240, Haakon had still not been affirmed as ruler by the Pope because of his ill-conceived birth. He in any case had a solid individual want to be affirmed completely as an European ruler. A few ecclesiastical commissions were selected to research the issue, and Haakon announced his authentic child Haakon the Young his successor rather than a more established living ill-conceived child. In spite of the fact that Haakon had youngsters with his fancy woman Kanga the Young preceding his marriage with Margrete, it was his kids with Margrete that was assigned as his successors as per an ecclesiastical acknowledgment. The Catholic guideline of authenticity was hence settled in the Norwegian request of progression, despite the fact that Haakon's new law still kept up that ill-conceived youngsters could be assigned as successor without any genuine kids or grandchildrenÃ¢ÂÂcontrary to Catholic standards. While his solid position enabled him to define limits to the congregation's political impact, he was then again arranged to give the congregation much self-governance in interior undertakings and relations with the rustic culture. 

Haakon likewise endeavored to reinforce his ties with the papacy by issuing a promise of campaign. In 1241 he anyway changed over this into a pledge of taking part in fighting against agnostic people groups in the north in light of the Mongol intrusion of Europe. At the point when a gathering of Karelians ("Bjarmians") had been constrained westwards by the Mongols, Haakon enabled them to remain in Malangen and made them christianizedÃ¢ÂÂsomething that would satisfy the papacy. Afterward, in 1248, Louis IX of France proposed (by Matthew Paris as delegate) to Haakon to go along with him for a campaign, with Haakon as authority of the armada, yet Haakon turned the idea down. While Haakon had been ineffective in picking up the acknowledgment of Pope Gregory IX, he immediately picked up the help from Pope Innocent IV who looked for unions in his battle with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Haakon at long last accomplished illustrious acknowledgment by Pope Innocent in 1246, and Cardinal William of Sabina was sent to Bergen and delegated Haakon in 1247. 

Subsequent to combining his situation in 1240, Haakon concentrated on showing the amazingness of the sovereignty, affected by the undeniably closer contact with European culture. He began developing a few great regal structures, essentially in the illustrious domain in Bergen where he fabricated an European-style stone royal residence. He utilized a great armada with stately regal boats when meeting with other Scandinavian rulers, and effectively sent letters and endowments to other European rulers; his most extensive contact was accomplished when he sent gyrfalcons with a consulate to the Sultan of Tunis. 

The regal court in Bergen likewise begun bringing in and interpreting the main genuine European writing that ended up accessible to a more extensive Norwegian group of onlookers. The writing which was mainstream at that point was brave sentimental writing gotten from the French and thusly English courts, quite "chansons de geste" around Charlemagne (the Matter of France) and stories of King Arthur (the Matter of Britain). The principal work that was converted into Old Norse was allegedly the Arthurian sentimental story "Tristan and Iseult", which was done in 1226 after requests from the youthful and recently marry Haakon. HÄÄkon's program appears to have been the sparkle for the development of another Norse kind of chivalric adventures. 

Haakon additionally had the well known religious content "Visio Tnugdali" converted into Old Norse as "Duggals leiÄÂ°sla". The writing additionally spoke to ladies, and both Haakon's significant other Margrete and his little girl Kristina possessed lavishly outlined psalters. 

Haakon likewise started legitimate changes which were vital for the improvement of equity in Norway. Haakon's "New Law" composed around 1260 was a leap forward for both the thought and routine with regards to open equity, rather than the customary Norwegian traditions for fights and vengeance. The impact of the changes is likewise obvious in Haakon's "Above all else's Mirror" ("Konungs skuggsjÄÄ"), an instructive content expected for his child Magnus, which was presumably written in collaboration with the imperial court in the mid-1250s. 

Relations were threatening with both Sweden and Denmark from the begin. Amid his competition with Earl Skule, Skule endeavored to pick up the help of Valdemar II of Denmark, however any guide was made incomprehensible after Valdemar's catch by one of his vassals. Since the Danes needed overlordship of Norway and bolstered the Guelphs (those supporting the Pope over the Holy Roman Emperor), Haakon thus looked for nearer ties with the Ghibelline Emperor Frederick II, who sent diplomats to Norway. As Haakon had picked up a ground-breaking notoriety because of the quality of his armada, other European rulers needed to profit by his companionship. In spite of the battle between the Pope and the Emperor, Haakon had the capacity to keep up companionships with both. As per an English writer, the Pope needed Haakon to turn out to be Holy Roman Emperor. It has been recommended that Haakon wavered to leave Norway because of the Mongol danger. 

Haakon sought after an outside approach that was dynamic every which way (albeit premier toward the west and south-east). In the north-east, the association with Novgorod had been tense because of a disagreement regarding the privilege to charge the Sami individuals, just as striking from both Norwegian and Karelian sides. In the long run, the Mongol risk drove Prince Alexander Nevsky to dealings with Haakon that probable fortified Norwegian control of Troms and Finnmark. An international safe haven from Novgorod one time requested Haakon's little girl Christina for a marriage, however Haakon declined because of the Mongol danger. Because of the Elven-based Norwegian nearness in the oceans around the south of Sweden and into the Baltic Sea, Norway progressively depended on Baltic grain from LÄÅºbeck. The import was anyway ended in the late 1240s because of the ravaging of Norwegian ships in Danish oceans by boats from LÄÅºbeck. In 1250, Haakon made a harmony and exchange concurrence with LÄÅºbeck, which in the long run additionally opened the city of Bergen to the Hanseatic League. Amid the contention, Haakon had supposedly been offered command over the city by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Regardless, Haakon's arrangement with respect to Northern German ports to a great extent got from his procedure of endeavoring to misuse the inner disturbance that had ejected in Denmark following the demise of King Valdemar II in 1241. 

In Scandinavia, Haakon routinely met with neighboring rulers in the fringe region around Elven from the late 1240s through the 1250s. Utilizing excellent armadas as agents, Haakon's armada at most supposedly checked more than 300 boats. Haakon looked to extend his kingdom southwards of Elven into the Danish area of Halland. He in this manner searched for partnership with the Swedes, just as ties with adversaries of the decision line of rulers of Denmark. Haakon made an arrangement with Swedish pioneer Earl Birger in 1249 about a joint Swedish-Norwegian attack into Halland and Scania, however the understanding was in the long run relinquished by the Swedes ("see" Treaty of LÄÅdÄÅse). Haakon guaranteed Halland in 1253, lastly attacked the territory all alone in 1256, requesting it as pay for the plundering of Norwegian ships in Danish oceans. He was anyway compelled to repudiate his cases in 1257 after a harmony understanding was made with Christopher I of Denmark. Haakon from that point arranged a marriage between his solitary outstanding child Magnus and Ingeborg, girl of previous Danish lord Eric Ploughpenny. Haakon had likewise accommodated with the Swedes when he had his child Haakon the Young wed a girl of Earl Birger. Haakon's Nordic arrangements started the development to the later close to home associations (called the Kalmar Union), that at last had critical ramifications for Norway as it didn't have the monetary and military assets to endure and keep up Haakon's forceful approaches. 

All the more indirectly, Haakon looked for a union with Alfonso X of Castile, a potential next Holy Roman EmperorÃ¢ÂÂchiefly as it would ensure new supplies of grain in light of rising costs in England, and conceivably offering access to Baltic grain through Norwegian control of LÄÅºbeck. Alfonso thusly looked to extend his impact in Northern Europe, just as to increase Norwegian maritime help for the battle or campaign he had proposed in Morocco (seeing that the Iberian Moors got backing abroad from North Africa). Haakon could in this way possibly additionally satisfy his ecclesiastical pledge of campaign, despite the fact that he likely did not plan to. He sent a government office to Castile in 1255, and the going with Castilian envoy on the arrival to Norway proposed to set up the "most grounded ties of companionship" with Haakon. In line with Alfonso, Haakon gave his assent that his little girl Christina could go to Castile and wed one of Alfonso's siblings. Christina's demise four years after the childless marriage, notwithstanding, denoted a compelling end of the fleeting "union", and the proposed campaign fell into the blue. 

Haakon utilized a functioning and forceful outside arrangement towards fortifying Norwegian ties in the west. His strategy depended on companionship and exchange with the English ruler; the primary known Norwegian exchange understandings were made with England in the years 1217Ã¢ÂÂ23 (England's first business bargains were likewise made with Norway), and the fellowship with Henry III of England was a foundation in Haakon's remote arrangement. As they had moved toward becoming lords around a similar time, Haakon kept in touch with Henry in 1224 that he wished they could keep up the companionship that had existed between their dads. Haakon looked to safeguard the Norwegian power over the islands in the west, to be specific the Hebrides and Man (under the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles), Shetland and Orkney (under the Earldom of Orkney), and the Faroe Islands. Further, the Norse people group in Greenland consented to submit to the Norwegian ruler in 1261, and in 1262 Haakon accomplished one of his long-standing aspirations when he figured out how to join Iceland into his kingdom by using the island's inside clashes to support him. The reliance on Norwegian sea exchange and their subjection to the Nidaros ministerial area were a portion of the key reasons which permitted Haakon to affirm power over the islands. The Norwegian kingdom was at the biggest it has ever been before the finish of Haakon's rule. 

Norwegian command over the Faroe Islands and Shetland was solid because of the significance of Bergen as an exchanging focus, while Orkney, the Hebrides and Man had progressively common ties with the Scottish territory. Albeit generally having had ties with the network of Norse pioneers in northern Scotland, Scottish rulers had progressively stated their power over the whole terrain. Haakon had in the meantime overseen the Hebrides and Man than any Norwegian ruler since Magnus Barefoot. As a major aspect of another advancement the Scottish lord Alexander II asserted the Hebrides and mentioned to purchase the islands from Norway, however Haakon staunchly dismissed the recommendations. Following Alexander II's demise, his child Alexander III proceeded and ventured up his dad's arrangement by sending a government office to Norway in 1261, and from that point assaulting the Hebrides. 

In 1263 the debate with the Scottish ruler over the Hebrides initiated Haakon to attempt an endeavor to the islands. Having learned in 1262 that Scottish nobles had attacked the Hebrides and that Alexander III intended to vanquish the islands, Haakon went on a campaign with his imposing "leidang" armada of something like 120 ships in 1263, having turned out to be acclimated with arranging sponsored by a scary armada. The armada left Bergen in July, and achieved Shetland and Orkney in August where they were joined by chieftains from the Hebrides and Man. Exchanges were begun by Alexander following Norwegian arrivals on the Scottish territory, however were intentionally drawn out by the Scots. Having held up until September/October for climate that caused inconvenience for Haakon's armada, a conflict happened between a littler Norwegian power and a Scottish division at the Battle of Largs. Albeit uncertain and of a constrained effect, Haakon pulled back to Orkney for the winter. An appointment of Irish lords welcomed Haakon to enable them to free Ireland of English pilgrims as High King of Ireland, yet this was clearly dismissed against Haakon's desire. 

Haakon over-wintered at the Bishop's Palace in Kirkwall, Orkney, with designs to continue his crusade the following year. Amid his stay in Kirkwall he anyway became sick, and kicked the bucket in the early long periods of 16 December 1263. Haakon was covered in the St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall for the winter, and when spring came he was uncovered and his body reclaimed to Norway, where he was covered in the Old Cathedral in his capital Bergen. Hundreds of years after the fact, in 1531, the house of God was obliterated by the leader of Bergenhus, Eske Bille for military purposes regarding the Protestant Reformation, and the graves of Haakon and other Norwegian rulers covered there might have been crushed all the while or moved to another area. 

Norwegian students of history have held unequivocally varying perspectives on Haakon's rule. In the nineteenth century, history specialist P. A. Crunch depicted Haakon as a relentless, practically immaculate ruler, which thus affected Henrik Ibsen in his 1863 play "The Pretenders". In the mid twentieth century, writer Hans E. Kinck countered and saw Haakon as an immaterial ruler subjected to powers outside of his control, a view which affected students of history, for example, Halvdan Koht and Edvard Bull, Sr.. Haakon has regularly been contrasted and Skule BÄÄ¾rdsson, and history specialists have favored one side in the old clash. While Munch considered Skule to be a backstabber to the legitimate Norwegian ruler, Koht saw Skule as a brave figure. On progressively scrappy grounds, Kinck applauded Skule as speaking to the first and kicking the bucket Norse culture, and Haakon as a shallow emulator of remote culture. Since the 1960s, history specialists including Narve BjÄÂ¸rgo, Per Sveaas Andersen, Knut Helle, Svein Haga and KÄÄ¾re Lunden have thus claimed a response against Koht's view. As indicated by Sverre Bagge, present day history specialists will in general pursue Koht with regards to see Skule's disobedience as a last urgent endeavor to prevent Haakon from enroaching his capacity, however lean nearer to Munch's general assessment of the two men. 

Knut Helle translates the adventure to leave an impression of Skule as a gifted warrior and lawmaker, while taking note of that the creator of the adventure deliberately made a diffuse picture of his job in the contention with Haakon. Then again, Helle takes note of that Skule was defeated effortlessly by Haakon's supporters in the quick years after 1217, and this may propose some constrained capacities. While neither giving a reasonable picture of Haakon, Helle keeps up that Haakon "clearly" figured out how to ace the political amusement in his initial years. He deciphers Haakon as an autonomous and willstrong ruler whom he relegates a "critical moral obligation" for the arrangements sought after amid his reignÃ¢ÂÂnotably with respect to the inside combination of the sovereignty, the introduction towards European culture and the forceful remote approach. In his article in "Norsk biografisk leksikon", Knut Helle recognizes that Haakon was engaged by the solid institutional position of the majesty toward the finish of his rule (which it ought to be noticed that he had created himself), and that his arrangements were not constantly effective. It in any case perceives the generous political capacities and amazing assurance Haakon more likely than not had so as to advance from the troublesome position in which he began his rule. 

Haakon had two ill-conceived youngsters with his special lady Kanga the Young (who is just known by name) before 1225. They were: 

Haakon wedded Margrete Skulesdatter on 25 May 1225, little girl of his opponent Earl Skule BÄÄ¾rdsson. Their kids were: 

HÄÄ¾kon and Kristin were the mascots of the 1994 Winter Olympics. HÄÄ¾kon is named after Haakon IV of Norway and Kristin after Christina of Norway. 

In "The Last King" (2016), the newborn child HÄÄ¾kon IV is depicted by Jonathan Oskar Dahlgren.
