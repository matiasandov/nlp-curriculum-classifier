Mari Lwyd 

The Mari Lwyd () is a wassailing society custom found in South Wales. The custom involves the utilization of an eponymous side interest horse which is produced using a pony's skull mounted on a shaft and conveyed by an individual covered up under a rough clothing. It speaks to a provincial variety of a "hooded creature" custom that shows up in different structures all through Great Britain. 

The custom was first recorded in 1800, with resulting records of it being delivered into the mid twentieth century. As indicated by these, the Mari Lwyd was a custom performed at Christmas time by gatherings of men. They would shape into groups to go with the pony on its movements around the neighborhood, in spite of the fact that the cosmetics of such gatherings changed, they commonly incorporated a person to convey the steed, a pioneer, and people dressed as stock characters, for example, Punch and Judy. The group would convey the Mari Lwyd to neighborhood houses, where they would demand passage through the mechanism of melody. The householders would be relied upon to deny them section, again through melody, and the opposite sides would proceed with their reactions to each other thusly. In the event that the householders in the end yielded, at that point the group would be allowed section and given nourishment and drink. 

Despite the fact that the custom was given different names, it was best known as the "Mari Lwyd"; the historical background of this term remains the subject of scholastic discussion. The folklorist Iorwerth C. Peate trusted that the term signified "Blessed Mary" and in this way was a reference to Mary, mother of Jesus, while individual folklorist E. C. Cawte thought it almost certain that the term had initially signified "Dark Mare", therefore alluding to the heads' equine appearance. Various prior folklorists to inspect the theme, for example, Peate and Ellen Ettlinger, trusted that the convention had once been a pre-Christian religious ceremony, albeit academic help for this translation has declined in the midst of an absence of supporting proof. The nonattendance recently medieval references to such practices and the geographic dispersal of the different British hooded creature traditionsÃ¢ÂÂamong them the Hoodening of Kent, the Broad of the Cotswolds, and the Old Ball, Old Tup, and Old Horse of northern EnglandÃ¢ÂÂhave prompted recommendations that they get from the regionalised promotion of the sixteenth and seventeenth-century style for side interest ponies among the social tip top. 

In spite of the fact that the convention declined in the ahead of schedule to mid-twentieth century, to some extent because of resistance from some nearby Christian pastorate and changing social conditions, it was restored in new structures in the mid-to-last piece of the century. The convention has additionally motivated different aesthetic portrayals, showing up, for example, in crafted by the painter Clive Hicks-Jenkins and the writer Vernon Watkins. 

The Mari Lwyd itself comprises of a pony's skull that is brightened with strips and appended to a shaft; to the back of the skull is joined a white sheet, which wraps down to disguise both the post and the individual conveying this gadget. Once in a while, the pony's head was spoken to not by a skull but rather was rather produced using wood or even paper. In certain occurrences, the pony's jaw had the capacity to open and close because of string or switch appended to it, and there are records of bits of glass being joined into the eye attachments of certain models, speaking to eyes. An onlooker of the custom as it was performed at Llangynwyd amid the nineteenth century noticed that arrangement for the action was a collective occasion, with numerous local people including themselves in the enriching of the Mari Lwyd. 

The Mari Lwyd custom was performed amid winter merriments, explicitly around the dates of Christmas and New Year. Notwithstanding, the exact date on which the custom was performed differed among towns, and in various cases the custom was done for a few sequential evenings. There is an extraordinary precedent given by a record from Gower in which the head was kept covered consistently, just being uncovered for use amid the Christmas season. 

The exclusively used to start at sunset and frequently kept going late into the night. The Mari Lwyd party comprised of four to seven men, who regularly had shaded strips and rosettes appended to their garments and here and there wore a wide band around the midriff. There was generally a cleverly dressed "Pioneer" who conveyed a staff, stick, or whip, and once in a while other stock characters, for example, the "Merryman" who played music, and Punch and Judy (both played by men) with darkened countenances; regularly splendidly dressed, Punch conveyed a long metal flame iron and Judy had a besom. 

The Mari Lwyd gathering would approach a house and sing a melody in which they mentioned permission. The occupants of the house would then offer reasons for why the group couldn't enter. The gathering would sing a second stanza, and the discussion between the opposite sides Ã¢ÂÂ known as the "pwnco" Ã¢ÂÂ would proceed until the house's occupants came up short on thoughts, at which time they were obliged to permit the gathering passage and to furnish them with brew and nourishment. A record from Nantgarw portrayed such an exhibition, in which the Punch and Judy characters would cause a commotion, with Punch tapping the ground to the beat of the music and rapping on the entryway with a poker, while Judy brushed the ground, house dividers, and windows with a sweeper. The householders needed to make Punch guarantee that he would not contact their chimney before he entered the structure, else it was the nearby custom that before he forgot he would rake the flame with his poker. For the situation from Llangynwyd, be that as it may, there was no transaction between the householders and troupe, yet rather the last were commonly allowed section consequently subsequent to singing the principal stanza of their melody. 

Once inside, the stimulation proceeded with the Mari Lwyd going around neighing and snapping its jaws, making destruction, terrifying kids (and maybe even grown-ups) while the Leader claimed to attempt to control it. The Merryman played music and engaged the householders. The folklorist Iorwerth Peate trusted that in recorded models from Glamorgan it was clear that the Mari Lwyd custom had progressed toward becoming "undefined" from the act of wassailing, despite the fact that additional that there were still a few instances of wassailing that did not include the Mari Lwyd. He included that joins between Mari Lwyd and wassailing were additionally evident from recorded models in other piece of Wales, in this way opining Mari Lwyd spoke to a variation of the more extensive wassailing custom that was found all through Britain. 

Most recorded sources term this specific custom "Mari Lwyd". Jones believed this to be an interpretation of "Favored Mary", and consequently a reference to Mary, mother of Jesus, a key religious figure in the Catholic Church. Despite the fact that deciphering it marginally in an unexpected way, as "Sacred Mary", Peate embraced this perspective. Albeit a portion of his colleagues later proposed that the utilization of "Mari" for Mary was obscure in Wales preceding the Protestant Reformation, he countered these reactions with the perception that the expression "Mari" was being utilized in reference to the Virgin in the mid-fourteenth century "Dark Book of Carmarthen", subsequently confirming its initial use in Welsh. He in any case acknowledged that amid the medieval period the term may have been confined to a great extent to writers, given that there is no proof of its utilization among the normal tongue in this period. 

Given that "llwyd" is the typical word for "dark" in the Welsh language and that Welsh speakers would have been presented to the English word "female horse", an elective proposal considered by Peate was that the expression "Mari Lwyd" had initially signified "Dim Mare". This etymological clarification would have parallels with the name of a comparable hooded horse custom found in Ireland and the Isle of Man, which is referred to in Irish as the "LÄÄir BhÄÄn" and in Manx as the "Laare Vane", in the two cases signifying "White Mare". At first trusting that "there is a lot to be said for this recommendation", Peate later grasped it completely. Cawte comparatively trusted that "Dark Mare" was the no doubt unique significance of the term, taking note of that the Mari Lwyd seemed to speak to a pony and that comparative leisure activity horse traditions in neighboring England, for example, the hoodening custom of East Kent, likewise made reference to ponies with their name. Peate recommended that regardless of whether the expression "Mari Lwyd" had initially alluded to a "Dark Mare", it could in any case have come to be related with Mary in prominent society culture following the Reformation, therefore clarifying why Mary is alluded to in the verses of some enduring Welsh wassailing melodies. 

A further proposal is that "Mari Lwyd" gets from the English expression "Happy Lude", alluding to a joyful amusement. Peate contradicted this thought, contending that on the off chance that the last was changed over into Welsh, at that point the outcome would be "merri-liwt" or "merri-liwd". Peate additionally rejected that had been proposed to him that the expression "Mari" in this setting had gotten from "Morris", a reference to Morris move. Another motivation to question this thought is that there is no known recorded connection between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris move, which was gathered in the north of the nation. 

In other recorded cases, the "Mary Lwyd" custom is given distinctive names, with it being recorded as "y Wasail" "The Wassail" in parts of Carmarthenshire. In the principal half of the nineteenth century it was recorded in Pembrokeshire under the name of "y March" "The Horse" and "y Gynfas-farch" "The Canvas Horse". One record from West Glamorgan has the head named the "aderyn honey bee" ["bi"?] "y llwyd", which means the "Dark Magpie", despite the fact that this might be because of a blunder with respect to the recorder, who could have befuddled the pony's head for the "aderyn pica llwyd", a fake winged animal in a tree that was conveyed by wassailers in a similar region. 

Placing the custom to be "the survival of some antiquated famous ritual or service", in 1888 David Jones proposed that its starting points were Christian, and that it had once been a piece of the merriments of the Feast of the Ass, a remembrance of the trip into Egypt of Mary and Saint Joseph that was verifiably set apart on 14 January. As per Jones' thought, the Mari Lwyd itself spoke to the jackass on which Mary rode amid the story. 

Peate was of the conclusion that the Mari Lwyd was "no uncertainty a survival of a pre-Christian convention" that had once been spread crosswise over Britain and different pieces of Europe, and which Ã¢ÂÂ having endure the Christianisation of Britain Ã¢ÂÂ had been renamed "Mari Lwyd" in reference to the Virgin Mary amid the Middle Ages. He communicated the view that the first custom had been "horrendous in inception and aim" and that from an early date it had been associated with wassailing. Cawte agreed that it was "sensible to acknowledge" that the Mari Lwyd head had turned out to be joined to a free wassailing convention, yet said that the association with the Virgin Mary was pointless. Pearce additionally recommended the likelihood that in parts of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire the Mari Lwyd custom went under the impact of secret plays, in this way clarifying why later recorded precedents from those regions contained characters known as "the Sergeant" and the "Merryman". 

The folklorist Trefor M. Owen likewise proposed that the Mari Lwyd was a training "which most likely had a religious (if pre-Christian) source", including that when it had been recorded, it had moved toward becoming "discharged of its religious substance". Additionally grasping Peate's proposal of antiquated causes, Ellen Ettlinger trusted that the Mari Lwyd spoke to a "demise horse", as symbolized by the white fabric worn by its bearer, recommending that it was initially utilized in a pre-Christian ceremony to check the celebration of Samhain. The folklorist Christina Hole proposed that this "old character" was at one time "a carrier of richness". Be that as it may, after 1970 the folkloric pattern for deciphering such leisure activity horse conventions as pre-Christian survivals had finished, as researchers came to express more prominent alert about proposing roots for such traditions. 

The Mari Lwyd was a piece of a more extensive "hooded creature" custom that the folklorist E. C. Cawte recognized as existing in various structures in different pieces of Britain. Highlights basic to these traditions were the utilization of a diversion horse, the execution at Christmas time, a melody or spoken articulation mentioning installment, and the utilization of a group who incorporated a man wearing ladies' attire. A related precedent is the hoodening custom of East Kent in southeastern England. In a zone along the fringe among Derbyshire and Yorkshire, the Old Tup custom included gatherings thumping on entryways around Christmas conveying a leisure activity horse that had a goat's head. Gap drew parallels among hoodening and the Christmas Bull custom recorded in Dorset and Gloucestershire. In south-west England, there are two surviving leisure activity horse traditionsÃ¢ÂÂthe Padstow 'Obby 'Oss celebration and Minehead Hobby HorseÃ¢ÂÂwhich happen not at Christmas time but rather on May Day. 

Despite the fact that the roots of these conventions are not known with any assurance, the absence of any late medieval references to such practices may propose that they rose up out of the recorded world class style for pastime steeds in the sixteenth and seventeenth hundreds of years. In this, the hooded creature conventions might be practically identical to England's Morris move custom, which turned into an "across the country rage" in the sixteenth and seventeenth hundreds of years before developing into "a lot of strongly portrayed local customs". 

In mapping the dispersion of Mari Lwyd appearances, Cawte noticed that it was mainly an exclusively connected with Glamorgan, with 66% of cases falling inside that area. The uniquely extended east into the mechanical valleys of Monmouthshire, with the most easterly record originating from Monmouth itself; this record is additionally one of the soonest. Various precedents were additionally found in Carmarthenshire, with a solitary model found in both Brecknockshire and Ceredigion. There is a solitary record of the custom being performed in North Wales, in a model from Wrexham, which Cawte accepted was the aftereffect of a Glamorgan man carrying the custom with him as he moved north. Beforehand, Peate had forewarned that the near nonappearance of recorded precedents from Mid and North Wales was not verification that the Mari Lwyd custom had never been available in those regions. 

Cawte opined that there was "no unmistakable reason" for the dispersion of the Mari Lwyd custom, which slice through different nearby social highlights. Those territories where it was found did not relate with any refinement between English-talking and Welsh-talking regions in South Wales. He recognized anyway that there was a "sensible correspondence" between the territories in which the Mari Lwyd was recorded and the regions which were utilized for mineral creation in the fourteenth century. He in this way proposed the likelihood that it may have been performed by coal and iron excavators in western Glamorgan, Carmarthenshire, and western Monmouthshire, and that from that point it could have spread into those towns where products were made utilizing those minerals. 

The soonest distributed record of the Mari Lwyd showed up in 1800 in J. Evans' "A Tour through Part of North Wales, in the year 1798, and at Other Times". In spite of the fact that the book itself concentrated on North Wales, the part in which the entry was incorporated talked about the language and traditions of Wales all the more for the most part. In this segment, Evans related that: 

Evans came back to the custom in his 1804 work "Letters Written During a Tour Through South Wales, in the year 1803, and at Other Times". Here he gave a more clear discourse than previously, making it obvious that groups going with a man dressed as a pony or bull visited the neighborhood Christmas until after Twelfth Day, and that they were given nourishment or cash to disregard the householders. 

The Mari Lwyd next showed up in a 1819 record from West Glamorgan, where the Mari Lwyd itself was named an "Aderyn Bee y llwyd" (generally "Dim Magpie") and was joined by "three or four accomplices in the benefits of the endeavor, who are by turns steed, lucky man, or chaperons". 

It has been recommended that the Welsh Methodist restoration added to the decay of both the Mari Lwyd and various other Welsh people traditions. In 1802, the harpist Edward Jones of Merionethshire distributed a book in which he deplored the ruinous effect that Christian ministers were having on Welsh society traditions, which they were reprimanding as wicked. In his view, "the result is, Wales, which was in the past one of the merriest and most joyful nations in the World, is presently getting to be one of the bluntest". Reflecting such a view, in 1852 the Reverend William Roberts, a Baptist serve at Blaenau Gwent, censured the Mari Lwyd and other related traditions as "a blend of old Pagan and Popish functions... I wish of this habit, and every single comparable indiscretion, that they discover no spot anyplace separated from the exhibition hall of the student of history and classicist." 

Owen proposed that the custom's decay was likewise an aftereffect of changing social conditions in South Wales. He contended that the Mari Lwyd wassailing custom "gave an endorsed methods for going into the places of neighbors in a culture in which there were not many open gatherings Ã¢ÂÂ at any rate in the core of winter Ã¢ÂÂ in which the jovial soul of the period could be discharged". Further, he recommended that the blessings of sustenance, drink, and now and again cash "no uncertainty assisted the sentiment of network among nation people while in the meantime showing it". He contended that the changing social conditions modified the manners in which that individuals in southern Wales observed Christmas, subsequently adding to the people custom's decrease. 

In a 1935 article regarding the matter of the Mari Lwyd, Peate expressed that the convention "is still met with; it is rehearsed in the Cardiff locale, Bridgend, Llangynwyd, Neath and other Glamorgan regions". He featured a precedent from Christmas Eve 1934, in which a Mari Lwyd was watched performing nearby no less than twelve vocalists in a scientist's shop in the Mumbles, Swansea. Ettlinger hence communicated the view that "Dr. Peate merits the sincerest appreciation of all old stories understudies for having so valiantly infiltrated the secrets encompassing the Mari Lwyd." 

The student of history Ronald Hutton expressed that the Mari Lwyd convention seemed to have turned out to be dead in the mid twentieth century. Amidst that century it was resuscitated in Llangynwyd. In 1967, Lois Blake distributed a letter in the diary "English Dance and Song" in which she noticed that the Mari Lwyd seemed every Christmas Eve at the Barley Mow Inn at Graig Penllyn, close Cowbridge, where a man named John Williams had kept the custom alive for as far back as sixty years. Blake additionally clarified that she trusted that the custom was still performed at a few towns in the Maesteg region of Glamorgan. Amid the 1970s, Hole remarked that the convention was as yet found in Glamorganshire and Carmathenshire. 

Amid the 1980s, further restored types of the Mari Lwyd convention developed in Caerphilly, Llantrisant, and St Fagans, which are all in a similar borderland among Vale and mountains. Remarking on the case of Llantrisant, which was initiated in 1980, Mick Tems noticed that the custom had "restored herself so unequivocally that there are grumblings in the event that she misses any of her standard calls". He noticed that in 1991 the Llantrisant Mari Lwyd was taken to Yn Chruinnaght, a Pan-Celtic celebration on the Isle of Man, and that it had additionally been taken to the Lowender Peran celebration at Perranporth in Cornwall. Hutton trusted that the custom re-rose in the borderlands among Vale and the mountains to some extent since individuals in Glamorgan looked to reaffirm their feeling of social character amid the end of their conventional enterprises, and incompletely in light of the fact that the Welsh Folk Museum was situated in the territory. All the more generally, he trusted that the restoration of the Mari Lwyd was in vast part due to the "powers of neighborhood energy", taking note of that a comparative circumstance had brought about the revival of the hoodening custom in East Kent. 

The town gathering of Aberystwyth sorted out "The World's Largest Mari Lwyd" for the Millennium festivities in 2000. 

A blend of the Mari Lwyd and Wassail traditions happens in the bordertown of Chepstow, South Wales, each January. A band of English Wassailers meet with the neighborhood Welsh Border Morris Side, The Widders, on the scaffold in Chepstow. 

The Mari Lwyd has provoked reactions from expressions of the human experience in Wales. The writer Vernon Watkins distributed his "Anthem of the Mari Lwyd" in 1941. The Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams has composed that this, "one of the extraordinary lyrics of the century, draws together the people custom of the New Year, the Christian Eucharist, the uneasy outskirts among living and dead, in order to exhibit a model of what verse itself is Ã¢ÂÂ wilderness work among death and life, old year and new, bread and body." 

The Mari Lwyd was used by the craftsman Clive Hicks-Jenkins in a progression of illustrations from around 2000 that concentrated on a transforming horse/man as a nightmarish harbinger of his dad's demise. Catriona Urquhart composed a grouping of ballads titled "The Mare's Tale" which were distributed nearby Hicks-Jenkins' pictures in 2001. In her 1977 novel "Silver on the Tree", the creator Susan Cooper incorporated an appearance from the Mari Lwyd. 

In 1919, H. W. Evans recorded the presence of a comparable custom which had existed in Solva, Pembrokeshire around 1840, amid his mom's adolescence. He expressed that this specially involved the utilization of what he named a "Mari Lwyd", moreover giving an illustration of it utilizing his mom's memories as a premise, despite the fact that was ignorant of how this outfit had been utilized. As per Evans' portrayal, this Mari Lwyd comprised of a sheet that had been sewn together along two contiguous sides to make a cone, which was then loaded down with roughage and finished with catches for eyes and gather gloves for ears, in this way taking after a creature's nose. An individual could cover themselves under the sheet and utilize a feed fork embedded into the roughage to hold it up. A comparative custom shows up in a record from 1897, in which an element known as the "Bwca Llwyd" ("Gray Bogy") was portrayed; it included an impersonation pony's head being produced using canvas and loaded down with feed, being conveyed about utilizing a feed fork on All Hallow's Eve. 

Cawte likewise noticed the case of other Welsh people traditions highlighting the leader of a steed, anyway he opined that these "so not appear to be firmly identified with the mari lwyd". A steed's head was set up in a way much the same as the Mari Lwyd for a spring celebration known as the "mynwenta" or "pynwenta", which occurred in Pembrokeshire around 1820. As a feature of this celebration, young fellows and ladies accumulated at a factory for a night's amusement. 

In the late nineteenth century, a custom was recorded in North Wales that was known as "giving a skull", in which the skull of a steed or jackass was put over the front entryway of a lady's home on May Day as an indication of hatred. 

In parts of Wales a pony's head Ã¢ÂÂ here and there with horns joined Ã¢ÂÂ was highlighted as a major aspect of the "charivari" parades intended to disgrace the individuals who were esteemed to have carried on in an indecent way.
