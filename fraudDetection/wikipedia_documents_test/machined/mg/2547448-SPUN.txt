Amid a congregation message, Bart begins to look all starry eyed at Reverend Lovejoy's little girl, Jessica. Be that as it may, when he approaches her, she disregards him. The following Sunday, Bart chooses to go to Sunday school to endeavor to persuade Jessica that he is a decent individual, yet despite everything she overlooks him. Baffled, Bart pulls a trick on Groundskeeper Willie, and is rebuffed with detainment. Jessica approaches him to express compassion and welcomes him to her home for supper with her family. 

Amid the supper with the Lovejoys, Bart's rough quirks and foul language cause Reverend Lovejoy to deny him from consistently observing Jessica once more. Be that as it may, Jessica discloses to Bart that she loves him and they start furtively dating, while at the same time causing fiendishness through the town. Bart rapidly understands that Jessica is more gravely carried on than he is, so at the following Sunday administration, he attempts to make her see the blunder of her ways. In spite of the fact that she appears to concur, Jessica promptly takes from the gathering plate before driving it back upon Bart. The gathering erroneously trusts that Bart took the cash when they see him with the unfilled plate. Bart endeavors to clarify, yet they won't tune in. Albeit Homer accept Bart is blameworthy, Marge is eager to listen to him, yet Bart claims he doesn't have even an inkling who did it. The next day, Bart visits Jessica at her home, and concedes that he doesn't care for her after Jessica won't possess up to the wrongdoing. 

After discovering reality, Lisa is resolved not to enable her sibling to be accused for something he didn't do, and she tells the assembly that Jessica is the blameworthy party. The townspeople look through Jessica's room, where the cash is found under her bed. Jessica is rebuffed by being compelled to clean the congregation steps, and Bart gets a conciliatory sentiment from the assemblage. Afterward, Bart approaches Jessica at chapel and discloses to her what he has realized, to which Jessica reacts that she has discovered that she can make young men do anything she desires. Bart at that point consents to complete Jessica's errands as she keeps running off with another beau, despite the fact that, he comments how he plans to complete a poor occupation to give just desserts to her. 

"Bart's Girlfriend" was composed by Jonathan Collier and coordinated by Susie Dietter. David Mirkin, who was show sprinter at the time, initially had the possibility of Bart having a sweetheart that was more malevolent than he was. Mirkin gave the plan to Collier to compose it with the assistance of the show's official maker James L. Streams. Collier said later that he thought it was an instance of Brooks thinking of smart thoughts and him "chuckling slavishly". The thought for the closure of the scene was to have none of the characters take in anything from the experience. 

Matt Groening, the maker of "The Simpsons", felt that Jessica Lovejoy was difficult to attract his very own style and yet make her alluring. Julie Kavner, who gives the voice of Marge Simpson on the show, was especially awed by the eyes. Jessica was made the Reverend's little girl to give the feeling that she was great at first and after that to demonstrate that she was defying the honesty of her family. In the scene where Bart converses with Jessica outside her home, her implement playing was in the content yet the precise movement was definitely not. Dietter preferred its fuse since it gave Jessica something different, other than Bart, to focus on. This was likewise done in the last scene when Jessica scours the congregation steps and plays with the clean brush. 

Institute Award winning performing artist Meryl Streep was brought in to do the voice of Jessica. Nancy Cartwright, who gives the voice of Bart Simpson on the show, was an immense devotee of Streep and she accepted that Streep would record her lines exclusively, yet the majority of their chronicles were done together. Streep appeared alone with no escort at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles at 2:30 p.m., where she recorded her parts with Cartwright. Streep was persistently doing a wide range of variants of her lines. Mirkin felt she was anything but difficult to work with in light of the fact that she was flexible and quick to complete various things, and as Mirkin communicated it, "effectively insidious". Cartwright said in a meeting with "The Pantagraph" that she truly needed Streep's signature, yet was hesitant to request it. After the chronicle session, Streep tapped Cartwright on the shoulder, and said her children were enormous "The Simpsons" fans and that she would be in "huge inconvenience" in the event that she didn't get Cartwright's signature. 

At the point when Homer is pondering over Bart's first date, he starts to sing "Dawn, Sunset" from "Fiddler on the Roof", before proceeding onward to "Feline's in the Cradle", and after that "Indeed, We Have No Bananas". The joke was over the top expensive for the essayists to put in light of the fact that they needed to pay a huge number of dollars for the rights to utilize the tunes on the show. 

"Bart's Girlfriend" initially broadcast on the Fox organize in the United States on November 6, 1994. The scene was chosen for discharge in a 2001 video gathering of chosen scenes titled: "The Simpsons Ã¢ÂÂ Love, Springfield Style". Different scenes incorporated into the accumulation set were "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge", "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons", and "I'm with Cupid".

"Misirlou", the signature melody of the 1994 film "Mash Fiction", plays amid Bart and Jessica's date. Bart calls Jessica "savvy, wonderful and a liar..." and after that claims she is "...so much superior to that "Sarah, plain and tall"". The scene at that point slices to a dose of a plain and tall young lady named Sarah that catches Bart and starts to cry. The Lovejoy family has an imitation of Leonardo da Vinci's work of art "The Last Supper" holding tight the divider in their lounge area. The sign on the Springfield Church marquee peruses: "Underhanded Women ever: From Jezebel to Janet Reno".

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the writers of the book "I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide", stated: "Poor Bart gets singled out in all respects cold-bloodedly by Jessica in a cunningly drawn investigation of pre-pubescent love. We're partial to the scene in which Bart jumps out of the window at the congregation, after which Homer cries: He's setting out toward the window!" Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in an audit of the 6th season DVD: "We donÃ¢ÂÂt regularly observe Bart in a thoughtful light, so indicates like this one are entertaining. [The episode] helps me to remember season fourÃ¢ÂÂs "Newcomer" since it likewise highlighted Bart in affection, however the projects contrast since here the young lady responds. Streep does pleasantly as the terrible child and we get many fine minutes in this important program." TV Squad's Adam Finley stated: "Homer and Marge stayed out of sight for a large portion of this scene, with Bart and Lisa turning into the principle center. Prior scenes appeared to concentrate more on the elements between the two kin, and it's dependably a decent difference in pace when the show looks at their affection for each other rather than consistent competitions. Lisa truly needs to help Bart in this scene, and it's entirely contacting." 

In a 2008 article, "Excitement Weekly" named Meryl Streep's job as Jessica Lovejoy as one of the sixteen best visitor appearances on "The Simpsons". "All out Film"s Nathan Ditum positioned Streep's execution as the fifth best visitor appearance in the show's history, remarking that she is "the ideal blend of boggling and fiendish as Reverend LovejoyÃ¢ÂÂs defiant little girl". David Mirkin told the "Day by day News of Los Angeles" that "Bart's Girlfriend" and "Homer the Great" are his most loved scenes of the period. Mirkin enjoyed the scene where Bart is punched by Nelson at the play area since Bart requires a significant stretch of time to recoup, which made the scene progressively reasonable. Nancy Cartwright told the "Chicago Tribune" that this scene, and "Lisa's Substitute" from season two, are her two top pick "The Simpsons" scenes.
