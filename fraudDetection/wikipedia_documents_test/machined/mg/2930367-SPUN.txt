This choice was not made to prohibit Clear Channel. It was made to incorporate Concerts West.

The show is going to be extremely about how she's turning into a lady, how she's getting herself and her freedom. She recognizes what she needs to do, she knows who she needs to be, and that is the thing that the show's about." 

The stage was structured by creation creator Steven Cohen and generation chief Rob Brenner for the HBO unique. This was the first run through Spears utilized a whole new stage plan in the wake of having utilized a regular end-organize with an incline and stairs at the inside as on her initial 3 visits (the "...Baby One More Time Tour", the "(You Drive Me) Crazy Tour", and the "Oops!... I Did It Again Tour"). Cohen structured the principle organize with an oval shape so Spears could perform around the stage thus that it would look great from numerous camera edges. He said that the remainder of the stage was made in view of three principle segments: a runway, a B-organize, and a flying gadget over the group. The latter was created, as clarified by Cohen, "around this present Cleopatra's freight ship idea I got into my head while structuring when the motion picture "Cleopatra" was playing out of sight.

Cohen stated, "The water screen is the cornerstone of the whole plan since it impacts each systemÃ¢ÂÂelectrics, organizing, moving. Victimize found the organization (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, and I promptly took a gander at what they had available, which was a straight line. Furthermore, I realized we didn't need a straight line. We needed a roundabout water screen so we could physically manufacture a shower for her to remain amidst and not get wet and after that stroll through when she needed to. Obviously, everybody thought I was insane, so I recommended a six-sided shape. Everybody was worried that the holes between the segments may cause holes in the real sheets of water. In any case, I continued saying that on the off chance that you put them 40' to 50' not yet decided, gravity will make the water append to itself, so you end up getting a strong sheet." 

The lighting was structured by Cohen and his accomplice in Steve Cohen Productions, Joel Young, who filled in as the visit's lighting chief.

Seven days before the visit started, Spears said of the show: "I originate from Broadway, so I need it to be extremely showy. The entire procedure for me is mystical. Ideally it will be something individuals have never at any point envisioned or imagined in their mind. I was experiencing a gone through yesterday and was considering, 'When I'm 30, there won't be anything left for me to do'". Introductory practices for the band began on September 9, 2001.
