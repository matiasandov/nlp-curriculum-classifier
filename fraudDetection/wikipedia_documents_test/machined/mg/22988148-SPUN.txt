Around the time Key finished the principal arrival of their 6th visual novel "Little Busters!", Hironori Toba of Aniplex (himself an enthusiast of Key's works) drew nearer Maeda around October 2007 about teaming up to create a unique anime arrangement. Maeda started meeting with Toba and Aniplex on a month to month premise and the story began to bit by bit advance. Aniplex needed Maeda to compose a screenplay that would be exceptionally "Key-like, with contacting snapshots of giggling and tears," yet at first Maeda wound up at a misfortune to compose a story more interesting than "Little Busters!", since he suspected that he had achieved a point of confinement with "Little Busters!" concerning a "Key-like story". Nonetheless, one day Maeda was struck by motivation, where he brainstormed the underlying thought of a story set in life following death. Moreover, with everybody officially dead, Maeda considered ostentatious fights where the soldiers go hard and fast without dread of death. As per Maeda, the subject of the arrangement is "life", which in "Blessed messenger Beats!" is delineated as a valuable and awesome thing, regardless of the characters in "Holy messenger Beats!" who battle against their destiny. 

Maeda selected Na-Ga to start deal with the character plans close to the start of 2008. Na-Ga was concerned that other PC designs (CG) work for Key would get postponed, yet he took the position due to his amassed involvement in CG.
