Extraordinary Zab 

The Great Zab or Upper Zab ( ("al-ZÃ¤Âb al-KabÃ¤Å¥r"), or , "(zÃ¤Âba ÄÅ¥alya)") is an around long stream coursing through Turkey and Iraq. It ascends in Turkey close Lake Van and joins the Tigris in Iraq south of Mosul. The waste bowl of the Great Zab covers around , and amid its course, the waterways gathers the water from numerous tributaries. The waterway and its tributaries are fundamentally encouraged by precipitation and snowmelt Ã¢ÂÂ because of which release changes exceptionally consistently. Somewhere around six dams have been moved toward the Great Zab and its tributaries, yet development of just one, the Bekhme Dam, has started yet was stopped after the Gulf War. 

The Zagros Mountains have been involved since at any rate the Lower Paleolithic, and Neanderthal control of the Great Zab bowl has been affirmed at the archeological site of Shanidar Cave. Verifiable records for the locale are accessible from the finish of the third thousand years BCE ahead. In the Neo-Assyrian time frame, the Great Zab gave water to water system for the grounds around the capital city of Nimrud. The Battle of the Zab Ã¢ÂÂ which finished the Umayyad Caliphate Ã¢ÂÂ occurred almost a tributary of the Great Zab, and the valleys of the stream gave haven to displaced people from the Mongol victory of Iraq. Amid the nineteenth and twentieth hundreds of years, the Great Zab bowl saw visit uprisings of nearby Kurdish clans making progress toward self-governance. 

The Great Zab ascends in Turkey in the rocky area east of Lake Van at a rise of around amsl and joins the Tigris to its left side bank in Iraq. In Turkey, the Great Zab navigates the territories of Van and HakkÄËri, though in Iraq it courses through Duhok Governorate and Erbil Governorate, both piece of the Kurdistan Region. Together with the Tigris, the Great Zab frames the limit between Erbil Governorate and Ninawa Governorate. In its upper achieves, the Great Zab moves through steep, rough crevasses. The stretch among Amadiya and the Bekhme Gorge, where the Bekhme Dam stays incomplete, has been known as the Sapna valley and will have an extensive segment of it immersed with water if the venture is finished. Various mountain streams and watercourses join the Great Zab to its right side and left banks. The Great Zab gets the majority of its waters from the left-bank tributaries; the Rubar-I-Shin, Rukuchuk, Rubar-I-Ruwandiz, Rubat Mawaran and Bastura Chai. 

The length of the Great Zab has been differently evaluated at and . Around of the stream's course are situated inside Iraq. The normal release of the Great Zab is every second, except pinnacle releases of up to every second have been recorded. The normal yearly release is . In view of its heavy nature, Medieval Arab geographers have portrayed the Great Zab Ã¢ÂÂ together with the Little Zab Ã¢ÂÂ as "demoniacally had". 

Assessments of the waste bowl of the Great Zab shift generally Ã¢ÂÂ from a low to a high figure of . Roughly 62 percent of the bowl is situated in Iraq; the rest of in Turkey. Toward the south, the Great Zab bowl verges on that of the Little Zab while on the east it borders the Tigris bowl. The Zagros comprises of parallel limestone folds ascending to heights of over amsl. The valleys Ã¢ÂÂ including that of the Great Zab Ã¢ÂÂ and the south-western lower region zone are loaded up with rock, combination, and sandstone; the aftereffect of water disintegration. The Amadiya valley inside the Great Zab waste bowl is the third-biggest valley in the Iraqi Zagros, after the Shahrazor and the Ranya Plain. 

The Great Zab ascends in the good countries of the Zagros Mountains, where an atmosphere with virus winter and yearly precipitation in overabundance of wins. From that point, the waterway streams into the lower region zone of the Zagros, where precipitation drops to not exactly every year at the conversion with the Tigris. Normal summer temperature in the lower region zone are commonly higher in the lower region zone than in the mountains. The high Zagros is portrayed by three diverse ecozones: the zone over the treeline at where bushes and herbs overwhelm, the region between that was in the past commanded by open oak woodland ("Quercus aegilops"), and the wetter and once in a while mucky waterway valleys. Different trees other than oak that can be found in the forested zone including juniper at higher heights; cinder, hawthorn, maple and walnut at middle of the road rises; and pistachio and olive trees in lower, drier zones. In the lower region zone, numerous regions are currently developed, yet there stay little fixes of normal vegetation ruled by herbs of the class "Phlomis". 

Until now, one vast dam has been halfway built on the Great Zab: Iraq's Bekhme Dam and Turkey's 24 MW weir-controlled run-of-the-waterway BaÃ¤ÂÃ¤ÄÄºÂlÃ¤Ä Hydroelectric Power Plant. Five others have been arranged in the Great Zab bowl by both Turkey and Iraq. Turkey's State Hydraulic Works intends to build the ÄÂukurca and DoÃ¤ÂanlÃ¤Ä Dams close ÄÂukurca and the HakkÄËri Dam close to the city of HakkÄËri. The HakkÄËri Dam with a 245 MW control station is in definite plan and the ÄÂukurca and DoÃ¤ÂanlÃ¤Ä Dams will bolster 245 MW and 462 MW control stations, separately. 

Iraq has started development of the Bekhme and Deralok Dams and arranged two others Ã¢ÂÂ the Khazir-Gomel and Mandawa Dams. Plans to assemble a dam in the Great Zab at the Bekhme Gorge for flood control and water system were first proposed in 1937. A plausibility think about discovered that the site was not appropriate for dam development and the arrangement was relinquished. In 1976, another investigation proposed three unique areas on the Great Zab, incorporating the site recommended in the before study. This site was in the end picked in 1989, when chip away at the dam initiated. Development of the Bekhme Dam was hindered by the episode of the Gulf War in 1990 and the dam stays incomplete. After the war, the site of the dam was plundered. The plans of the Bekhme Dam required a high rockfill dam and an underground hydroelectric power station lodging six turbines with an all out limit of 1,560 MW. The supply that would have been made by the Bekhme Dam would have a capacity limit of and would have overwhelmed various towns, the archeological site of Zawi Chemi Shanidar and the frontage road to Shanidar Cave (in spite of the fact that not simply the cavern). 

Proof for human control of the Zagros ventures once more into the Lower Paleolithic, as confirm by the disclosure of many cavern destinations dating to that period in the Iranian piece of the mountain run. Center Paleolithic stone apparatus gatherings are known from Barda Balka, a cavern site south of the Little Zab; and from the Iranian Zagros. A Mousterian stone apparatus gathering Ã¢ÂÂ created by either Neanderthals or anatomically present day people Ã¢ÂÂ was as of late unearthed in Erbil. Neanderthals additionally involved the site of Shanidar. This cavern site, situated in the Sapna Valley, has yielded a settlement succession extending from the Middle Paleolithic up to the Epipalaeolithic time frame. The site is especially notable for its Neanderthal entombments. The Epipalaeolithic control of Shanidar, contemporary with the utilization of the Kebaran stone device array, is the most established proof for anatomically current human control of the Great Zab bowl. The accompanying Protoneolithic, or Natufian, occupation is contemporary with the most seasoned control of the adjacent outside site Zawi Chemi Shanidar. M'lefaat on the Khazir River (a tributary to the Great Zab) was a little town of seeker gatherers dating to the tenth thousand years BCE that was contemporary with the Pre-Pottery Neolithic An in the Levant. An archeological study of the Citadel of Erbil, in the plain south of the lower course of the Great Zab, has demonstrated that this site was consistently involved at any rate from the sixth thousand years BCE upward. 

The soonest recorded reference to the area dates to the Ur III tradition, when lord Shulgi referenced the city of Urbilum Ã¢ÂÂ the old name of present day Erbil. The incomparable Assyrian capitals of Assur, Nineveh, Nimrud and Dur-Sharrukin were altogether situated in the lower region zone where the Great Zab streams into the Tigris, and the Great Zab bowl turned out to be progressively incorporated into the Middle Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian realms. Nimrud, the capital of the domain until 706 BCE, was found just far from the intersection of the Great Zab with the Tigris. The Assyrian lord Ashurnasirpal II built a waterway called "Patti-Hegalli" that tapped water from the Great Zab to flood the land around Nimrud, and this trench was reestablished by his successors Tiglath-Pileser III and Esarhaddon. This waterway kept running along the correct bank of the Great Zab and slice through a stone feign by methods for a passage is as yet unmistakable today. After the fall of the Neo-Assyrian realm, the Medes oversaw the region, trailed by the Achaemenids in 550 BCE. The Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BCE Ã¢ÂÂ one of the conclusive fights prompting the fall of the Achaemenid domain on account of Alexander the Great Ã¢ÂÂ evidently occurred north of the Great Zab in the region of Mosul. After AlexanderÃ¢ÂÂs demise in 323 BCE, control of the zone moved to the Seleucids. 

In 750 CE, the last Umayyad caliph Marwan II was crushed by the Abbasid As-Saffah in the Battle of the Zab on the banks of the Khazir River, a tributary to the Great Zab. At the point when the Mongols cleared over Iraq in the thirteenth century and sacked Erbil, numerous survivors looked for an asylum in the blocked off valleys of the Great Zab. The Sapna Valley was home to both Christian and Muslim people group, as confirm by Christian ancient rarities found at Zawi Chemi Shanidar. Amid the nineteenth century, the zone was constrained by nearby Kurdish pioneers. Amid World War I, overwhelming battling occurred in the zone, and Rowanduz was ravaged by Russian troopers in 1916. Following World War I, scenes of substantial battling occurred between the Barzani clan Ã¢ÂÂ taking a stab at the foundation of an autonomous Kurdish country Ã¢ÂÂ and a few other Kurdish clans, and between the Barzanis and the Iraqi Government. The remainder of these uprisings began in 1974 and prompted substantial bombardments of towns and towns in the Great Zab bowl.
