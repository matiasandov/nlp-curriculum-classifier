Syrgiannes Palaiologos 

Syrgiannes Palaiologos Philanthropenos (, Ã¢ÂÂ 1334) was a Byzantine privileged person and general of blended Cuman and Greek plummet, who was associated with the common war between Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos () and his grandson Andronikos III (). Faithful just to himself and his very own desire, he exchanged sides a few times, and wound up vanquishing quite a bit of Macedonia for the Serbian ruler Stefan DuÄºÄan () before being killed by the Byzantines. 

Syrgiannes was brought into the world around 1290. He was named after his dad or potentially granddad, a Cuman pioneer who progressed toward becoming "megas domestikos" (president of the Byzantine armed force) under Emperor Andronikos II. At the time there were numerous Cumans in the Empire, who settled amid the rule of John III Doukas Vatatzes (). The senior Syrgiannes' unique name was "Sytzigan" (from Cuman-Turkic "SÄÅ¼Ã¤ÂÃ¤Âan", "mouse"); it was Hellenized to "Syrgiannes" ("ace John") when he was submersed. The more youthful Syrgiannes' mom was Eugenia Palaiologina, an individual from the decision Palaiologos family and niece of Emperor Michael VIII (). Aware of the renown of his mom's family name, youthful Syrgiannes utilized that so as to propel himself in the supreme order. Syrgiannes additionally had a sister, Theodora, who wedded Guy de Lusignan, later King of Armenian Cilicia as Constantine II. Syrgiannes shows up in history in 1315, when he was set as military legislative head of a Macedonian area close to the Serbian fringe. Regardless of the current settlements, and against his directions, he set out to assault both Serbia and Epirus. Mitigated of his post, he revolted, was caught and detained. At some point before 1320, in any case, he was in the long run acquitted and designated to an order in Thrace. 

In 1320, after the demise of Michael IX Palaiologos (oldest child of Andronikos II and co-ruler from 1295 on), his child Andronikos III was delegated as co-head by Andronikos II. Albeit at first well known with his granddad, the more youthful Andronikos and his company of youthful nobles, to which Syrgiannes had a place, had at that point caused the senior head's dismay by their excess. Their overabundances finished in the mixed up character murder of the youthful sovereign's more youthful sibling, Manuel; rankled, the senior Andronikos abrogated his grandson's titles, and a profound individual fracture was opened between the two. 

Around then, Syrgiannes and John Kantakouzenos purchased for themselves governorships in Thrace, where discontent with the old sovereign was overflowing, and they immediately activated help for the more youthful Andronikos. Together with Alexios Apokaukos and Theodore Synadenos, they arranged to topple the matured Andronikos II for his grandson. In Easter 1321, the more youthful Andronikos came to Adrianople, and the uprising broke out. Syrgiannes drove an expansive armed force towards the capital, driving the old head to arrange. Subsequently, on 6 June 1321, an understanding was achieved which apportioned the domain. Youthful Andronikos III was perceived as co-sovereign and offered Thrace to administer as a semi appanage, setting up his court at Adrianople, while Andronikos II kept on decision from the capital, Constantinople, as senior head. 

Syrgiannes was disappointed with the new game plans, feeling that he had not been adequately compensated for his help of Andronikos III. He likewise hated the more noteworthy support appeared by the youthful sovereign to Kantakouzenos, and built up a furious competition with the last mentioned. Moreover, recorders likewise report a story whereby Andronikos III endeavored to tempt Syrgiannes' significant other. In December 1321, Syrgiannes exchanged sides, escaping to Constantinople. Remunerated with the grandiose title of "megas doux", he persuaded Andronikos II to continue the war against his grandson. In July 1322, in any case, another understanding was come to between the two Andronikoi, which left Syrgiannes in an unbalanced position. His own plans having fizzled, he started plotting to kill the matured Andronikos II and catch the position of authority for himself. The plot was thwarted, in any case, and Syrgiannes was condemned to life detainment. 

In 1328, Andronikos III at long last ousted his granddad and built up himself as sole head. Syrgiannes was liberated, and had the capacity to reestablish himself to Andronikos' support, to the degree that in late 1329 he was depended with the imperative governorship of Thessalonica, the Empire's second-biggest city, and of western Macedonia and Albania. There, he was again associated with plotting against Kantakouzenos, this time with the head's mom, Empress Maria. She lived in Thessalonica, and should watch out for Syrgiannes; rather, she turned out to be so beguiled by him that she had him received. Following the passing of the Empress in late 1333, the plot was revealed and Syrgiannes was captured and conveyed to Constantinople to deal with indictments of conspiracy. Syrgiannes, be that as it may, figured out how to escape and escape to the court of the Serbian ruler Stefan DuÄºÄan. 

DuÄºÄan put Syrgiannes at the leader of an expansive Serbian power, with which he attacked Byzantine Macedonia in 1334. Syrgiannes' capacities as a general, his insight into the Byzantine armed force's auras and the fellowships he had kept up with a few neighborhood Byzantine officers brought about the quick catch of numerous vital Byzantine urban areas, including Ohrid, Prilep, Strumica, and Kastoria. The street was open for a development towards Thessalonica, and Syrgiannes' military digs in before the dividers of the city, confronting a Byzantine help compel. The two sides remained stayed going up against one another for a few days, however on 23 August 1334, Syrgiannes was tricked far from his camp with just a couple of retainers and killed by Sphrantzes Palaiologos, a Byzantine general who had surrendered deliberately to the Serbian camp a couple of days sooner. With the loss of their important military pioneer, the Serbs made due with an arranged harmony with the Byzantines, which was exceptionally profitable for them as they were left possessing the vast majority of the urban communities won by Syrgiannes in northern Macedonia. 

Syrgiannes' desire, deep rooted plotting, and various disloyalties made him one of the darkest figures of the period according to both contemporary and later students of history: the fourteenth century antiquarian Nikephoros Gregoras contrasted his trip with Serbia with Themistocles' trip to the Persians, while Donald Nicol compared him to Alcibiades and Angeliki Laiou called him "the most malicious nearness" of the common war.
