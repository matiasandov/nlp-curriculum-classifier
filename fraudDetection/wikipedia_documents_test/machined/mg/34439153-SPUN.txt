Resolved to clean up his language abilities, Will goes to night school for a supplemental class and meets educator David Martinez (Ricky Martin), who brings up that kids adapt better through music.

Sue finds that Cheerios co-chief Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) was the person who griped about her instructing. Becky trusted that Sue had turned out to be less centered around the squad, to its disservice, and Sue lauds her commitment to the group.

"The Spanish Teacher" was offered blended to positive surveys. Todd VanDerWerff of "The A.V. Club" composed that "quite a bit of this scene felt like a conscious return to season one, in some generally excellent ways", and IGN's Robert Canning said that "the all-encompassing storylines on "Happiness" have turned out to be definitely more captivating than what we found in the primary portion of the period". John Kubicek of "BuddyTV" expressed that the scene "completes a ton of things right with regards to the plot", and "Announcement" Rae Votta depicted the plot as "steady and very much oversaw, with authentic inspiration, reaction and activity all around". In any case, Jen Chaney of "The Washington Post" composed that the scene "brought increasingly story improvements that didnÃ¢ÂÂt bode well", and "Moving Stone" Erica Futterman expressed that beside Martin's scenes, "the remainder of the scene discovered us back in thoughtless plot an area". Amy Reiter of "The Los Angeles Times" enjoyed the scene and portrayed it as "the benevolent that makes you paunch chuckle and laugh and giggle regardless of your better judgment". 

The presentation of Ricky Martin as David Martinez was invited by generally analysts. Futterman composed that "Ricky Martin carried on the Gwyneth Paltrow custom of truly incredible visitor educator appearances", and "TVLine" Michael Slezak said that the scene was great "in any event at whatever point Ricky Martin showed up on screen". VanDerWerff called him "fun and irresistible", and Kate Stanhope of "television Guide" said he "showed himself to be a visitor star with "mucho" potential". Kubicek, however he said Martin was "extraordinary at singing", discovered him "sort of dull as an on-screen character", and Canning said Martin "felt strange" in the scene. 

In spite of the fact that Canning composed that "the authors completed a fine occupation of fusing the residency, Will's horrible Spanish and the tunes into the storylines", Will's absence of Spanish abilities was addressed by different analysts. "Diversion Weekly" Joseph Brannigan Lynch said this did not "appear to gel with the enthusiastic Will Schuester I recall from season 1", and Slezak communicated shock that "he hadn't aced the nuts and bolts of the language!", as did Chaney. Slezak additionally said Will, as confirm by his "La Cucaracha" interpretation for his class, was "all of a sudden moronic as the cardboard box that Finn winningly transformed into a robot head", and Chaney remarked, "Mr. Schuester dependably appeared more delicate than this." VanDerWerff composed of "the bizarre, dull sadness at the core of Will's situation: He's a secondary school Spanish instructor, and he generally is that since he doesn't have the foggiest idea what else to do." He included, "I think this was most likely the best scene for the character since early season one." Canning expressed that "the pressure among Will and Emma was a much needed development", and Votta remarked on the scene's less emotional completion with Will's conciliatory sentiment and "observing Emma's recently discovered residency with a supper" with the end, "some of the time you needn't bother with a huge explosion to get oomph out of a scene". Chaney, be that as it may, was astounded with respect to why Emma was given showing residency "when she's been working at McKinley as a direction guide and passing out completely astonishing independent leaflets". 

The scene among Sue and Roz was singled out by numerous commentators. Chime composed that she was "truly adoring the feisty dynamic" among them, and that it was "about time that Sue had a legitimate competing accomplice". Flandez called Roz "the superbly brilliant synchronized swimming educator", and said her "blistering comments were expertly conveyed" and that there were "an excessive number of good lines to appreciate". Futterman said Roz helped her to remember "what an engaging firecracker Sue was amid season one", and that Sue is "a sorry excuse for [her] previous self" as prove by the way that Roz has not been a casualty of Sue's "underhanded arranging". Lynch portrayed the experience as "one of the scene features", however he felt that "the authors tried too hard a touch" when Sue "scarcely got in any counters" against Roz. Reiter called Roz "an extraordinary expansion to the cast of characters" and Leakes "spot-on" in the job, likewise noticing back to the early Sue. Kubicek said he "may like this subplot" if Leakes did not botch "yelling for acting", and Slezak remarked on Roz's "especially loathsome evaluation of SueÃ¢ÂÂs regenerative capacities". Votta, in any case, proclaimed that the show "should never let NeNe go", and said she "conveys the absolute best lines ever". Chaney and Slezak felt that Sue ought to have been terminated promptly for mentioning sperm gifts from New Directions guys, while Lynch simply considered it a conceivable drawback to her residency offer. Kubicek figured the pregnancy storyline should push ahead "on the grounds that Sue turning into a mama has comedic potential composed on top of it". 

A "feature" for Lynch was where Kurt, Mercedes and Rachel were watching "Sundown" together, not just on the grounds that the "fellowship among Kurt and Mercedes" has been "unfortunately made light of", but since it was "decent to see the Glee kids simply being children now and then". The ensuing discussion among Kurt and Finn in the storage space was depicted by Canning as "one of the most genuine snapshots of the period up until now". Votta stated, "Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith frequently sparkle together in scenes, particularly one-on-one, and this is no special case." Another team that analysts complimented was Mercedes and Sam. Futterman, while she reprimanded the scene for setting "its degree excessively wide", acknowledged their storyline as the "just a single played out firmly enough through exchange and melody". Votta expressed that ""Glee" is getting increasingly sentimental pressure mileage out of this team than you can shake a stick at, and it's flavorful, particularly with Valentine's around the bend", and Canning noticed that their week-long verbal quiet "helped incorporate their association with something we care progressively about". Chaney, in any case, couldn't see the sense in Mercedes carrying Sam with her "to see Miss Pillsbury to deal with her tangled affections for Sam and Shane". 

The melodic exhibitions got a blended reaction from commentators. Votta said that "the melodies were for the most part forgettable and for the most part futile to propelling the plot", and Canning kept up that "the music this week was simply alright". In spite of the fact that VanDerWerff called the melodic numbers "generally pointless", he depicted a large number of them as "really fun", while Bobby Hankinson of "The Houston Chronicle" said he "wasnÃ¢ÂÂt unimaginably moved by this weekÃ¢ÂÂs Spanish-seasoned choices". 

"Attractive and I Know It" was looked into emphatically by "HuffPost TV" Crystal Bell, who refered to Martin's "fantastically provocative execution". Slezak gave the number an energetic "Gracious dear God, please yes", "extra focuses" and an "A" grade. Chaney proclaimed that "Martin did what he does great: move and sing with high force", however she wished "they had picked a superior melody" and gave it a the last conclusion was reverberated by Lynch, who called the tune "blockhead" and gave it a somewhat lower "C+". Futterman portrayed it as an "energizing number that toes the line of being unreasonably racy for a secondary school homeroom", however Kubicek felt that having "an educator crushing with understudies" was "fiercely wrong" if "hot and really engaging". MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan, notwithstanding, called it "a standout amongst the most eye-forehead raising melodic numbers" in the show's history, "peculiar", and "a Rory-moving, Finn-thrashing come up short". VanDerWerff was likewise basic, and depicted it as "moronic and inept and off-base". 

Slezak expressed that "Mercedes' melodic minutes in Season 3 have been extremely solid" and that "Don't Wanna Lose You" was "no special case"; he gave it a "B+" grade. Lynch gave an and expressed, "It's been a treat to hear her build up the milder side of her voice." Chaney said that "the number was fine, just not especially fascinating" and gave it a "C", however Futterman announced that Mercedes "brings an extravagance and control and estimable Spanish articulation to Gloria Estefan's melody". Lynch called the "Bamboleo"/"Legend" blend "another Samcedes champ" and gave it a "B", and Chaney said it was a "fun decision" that "would have a fabulous time number" without the "consistent" center around the fashionable person boots, and evaluated it "C+". Sullivan concurred that the boots were better not seen, yet that "the tune really worked"; he likewise noticed that "Sam can sound one serious parcel like" Iglesias. Futterman likewise heard the likeness among Sam and Iglesias, however she said "the execution does not have the flame and sex intrigue of the firsts". Raymund Flandez of "The Wall Street Journal" depicted it as "the most clichÃ© number in a few seasons". 

Futterman called "La Isla Bonita" the "best number of the night". She included that it "blends smooth move moves and spot-on singing with maybe a touch an excess of sexual pressure for an understudy/educator matching". Slezak said that "the harmonies were sweet, and the moving was provocative without going too far into irritating AprilÃ¢ÂÂOctober domain" and gave it a Votta composed that "the pair don't have any science", yet that "they're both exceptionally lovely to take a gander at and tune in to" and "their understanding of Latin culture is present day and hot". Both Chaney and Lynch noted what she called "mysteriously high creation esteems"; the way that "these two looked extraordinary together", moved the merengue "wonderfully" and "sounded smooth" drew a "B+" grade from her, while his "B" was given in light of the fact that "the moving wowed yet their voices simply didn't interface for me on this unfilled club form". 

The two tunes performed by Will Schuester got the most negative audits. Chaney portrayed "La Cucaracha" as "tolerantly concise", and Slezak gave it a "F" for being "purposefully terrible" however "dreadful horrendous". Chaney was all the more liberally slanted toward "A Little Less Conversation". She expressed, "Matthew Morrison figured out how to give his everything to this Spanish-mixed Elvis Presley spread, despite the fact that he looked truly crazy in that bullfighter outfit", and gave it a "B". Futterman expressed that the execution achieved "an extraordinary failure" with the presence of "Mike and Brittany as his bulls", and Lynch said that the number "should suck" and "carried out its responsibility well"; all things being equal, he gave it a Slezak gave a single word summation to go with his "D" grade: "No." 

Two of the scene's five discharged singles appeared on the "Bulletin" Hot 100: "Attractive and I Know It" appeared at number eighty-three and "La Isla Bonita" at number ninety-nine. The second of those tunes, "La Isla Bonita", likewise appeared on the "Announcement" Canadian Hot 100 at number ninety-three, and was the one melody from the scene to show up on that graph.
