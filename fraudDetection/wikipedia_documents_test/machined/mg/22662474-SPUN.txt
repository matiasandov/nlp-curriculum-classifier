Varagavank 

Varagavank (, "Religious community of Varag"; , "Seven Churches") was an Armenian cloister on the inclines of Mount Erek, southeast of the city of Van, in eastern Turkey. 

The cloister was established in the mid eleventh century by Senekerim-Hovhannes Artsruni, the Armenian King of Vaspurakan, on a previous religious site. At first filling in as the necropolis of the Artsruni lords, it in the end turned into the seat of the diocese supervisor of the Armenian Church in Van. The religious community has been portrayed as one of the extraordinary devout focuses of the Armenian church by Ara Sarafian and the most extravagant and most commended cloister of the Lake Van region by Robert H. Hewsen. 

Amid the Armenian Genocide, in AprilÃ¢ÂÂMay 1915, the Turkish armed force assaulted, consumed, and annihilated a great part of the cloister. A greater amount of it was obliterated during the 1960s, albeit a few segments are as yet surviving. 

As per custom, in the late third century, Hripsime shrouded the leftover of the True Cross she wore on her neck at the site of the religious community. In 653, when the area was found, Catholicos Nerses III the Builder fabricated the Church of Surb Nshan (Holy Sign). It is depicted by Robert H. Hewsen as "a straightforward withdrawal". Catholicos Nerses additionally settled the Feast of the Holy Cross of Varag (ÅÂÅÄÃ¶ÂÅÄÅÅÅÄ ÅËÅÂ¸Ã¶ÂÃ¶ÂÅË ÅÂ­ÅÄÅÅ¡ÅÅ¥ ÅÅ¼ÅÂ¸ÅÅ), celebrated by the Armenian Apostolic Church on the Sunday closest to September 28, constantly two weeks after the Feast of the Cross. 

Ruler Khushush, the little girl of King Gagik I of Armenia and companion of Senekerim-Hovhannes Artsruni, the future Artsruni King of Vaspurakan, fabricated a congregation at the site in 981 devoted to the Holy Wisdom ("Surb Sopi"). In the late medieval period, it was changed over into a manor and was known as "Berdavor" ("berd" signifies "fortification" in Armenian). The Church of Surb Hovhannes (Saint John) was worked toward the north in the tenth century. 

The cloister itself was established by Senekerim-Hovhannes right off the bat in his rule (1003Ã¢ÂÂ24) to house a relic of the True Cross that had been kept on the site since Hripsime. In 1021, when Vaspurakan tumbled to Byzantine standard, Senekerim-Hovhannes took the relic to Sebastia, where the next year his child Atom established the Surb Nshan Monastery. In 1025, after his demise, Senekerim-Hovhannes was covered at Varagavank and the True Cross was come back to the cloister. Dreading an assault by Muslims, Varagavank Father Ghukas took the True Cross in 1237 to the Tavush locale of northeastern Armenia. There he settled in the Anapat religious community, which was renamed Nor Varagavank. In 1318, the Mongols attacked the district and stripped the cloister. Every one of the temples were annihilated aside from St. Hovhannes, which had an iron entryway and was the place the priests stowed away. Among 1320 and the 1350s, the cloister was totally reestablished. 

The Safavid ruler Tahmasp I scoured the cloister in 1534. In 1648, alongside different structures in the locale, Varagavank was annihilated by a tremor. Its reclamation started quickly from that point by religious community father Kirakos who found money related help among the rich shippers in Van. As per the seventeenth century history specialist Arakel of Tabriz, four holy places were reestablished and revamped. 

The draftsman Tiratur assembled a square-arranged gavit (narthex) west of Church of Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) in 1648. It worked as a congregation amid the nineteenth century, called Surb Gevorg. Toward the west of the narthex was a seventeenth century three-angled outside yard; toward the north was Church of Surb Khach (Holy Cross); while toward the south was the seventeenth century Church of Surb Sion. Urartian cuneiform engravings were utilized as lintels on their western doorways. 

Suleyman, the ruler of HoÄºÂap Castle, attacked the religious community in 1651, plundering it of its Holy Cross, compositions, and fortunes. The cross was later repurchased and it was added to the Tiramayr Church of Van in 1655. The cloister declined in the late seventeenth century and, in 1679, a considerable lot of its fortunes were sold because of monetary troubles. Diocese supervisor Bardughimeos Shushanetsi remodeled the religious community in 1724. 

In 1779, father Baghdasar "vardapet" beautified the narthex dividers with frescoes of King Abgar V, Theodosius I, Saint Gayane, Hripsime, Khosrovidukht, and Gabriel. As per Murad Hasratyan, the obscure painter had combined the styles of Armenian, Persian, and Western European craftsmanship. 

A divider was worked around the cloister in 1803 and, after fourteen years, the Church of Surb Khach (Holy Cross) was totally revamped and changed over into a storehouse of original copies by ecclesiastical overseer Galust. In 1832, Tamur pasha of Van looted the religious community's fortunes and choked the dad Mktrich "vardapet" Gaghatatsi to death. In 1849, Gabriel "vardapet" Shiroyan reestablished the Church of Sion, which had been decimated by a seismic tremor, and changed over it into a wheat stockroom. 

Mkrtich Khrimian, the future leader of the Armenian Church, moved toward becoming dad of Varagavank in 1857 and made the religious community successfully free and subordinate just to the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople. He established a printing house and started distributing "Artsvi Vaspurakan" ("The Eagle of Vaspurakan"), the main paper in recorded Armenia, which was distributed somewhere in the range of 1858 and 1864. He likewise settled a cutting edge school. The school showed subjects, for example, religious philosophy, music, language structure, topography, Armenian examinations and history; the conspicuous author Raffi was quickly one of the instructors. The school delivered its first alumni in 1862. 

Amid the Hamidian slaughters of 1896, the religious community was sacked and ransacked. A few educators and understudies were slaughtered. As indicated by a contemporary report by an American at Van, "Varak, the most popular and notable religious community in this [Van] area, which has faced the hardships of hundreds of years is practically sure to go [on fire]." 

On twentieth April 1915 somewhere in the range of 30 gendarmes touched base at Varagavank and killed the religious community's two priests together with four of their workers. The religious community stayed under their occupation until the 30th April, when, for obscure reasons, the gendarmes pulled back and came back to Van city. This withdrawal matched with the entry on Varag heap of somewhere in the range of 3000 Armenian displaced people from the Hayatzor valley who had gotten away from the slaughters that had occurred there a few days sooner. They were before long joined by somewhere in the range of 3000 overcomers of slaughters somewhere else, and together they found a transitory shelter in the Armenian towns and cloisters on the mountain, including Varagavank. Self-preservation units were additionally set up trying to secure the towns - around 250 men, practically a large portion of the power, was positioned at Varag, with a large portion of the rest of at close-by Shushants religious community. On the request of Van's Governor Djevdet Bey, Turkish powers returned in quality, with a power of 300 calvarymen, 1000 state army, and three batteries of mounted guns. As indicated by Kevorkian this was on the eighth May. Shushants rapidly fell in the wake of setting up a weak safeguard and was burned to the ground. Varagavank fell in no time a short time later and was additionally singed. Most of the townspeople and the evacuees figured out how to run away to Van during the evening. The Turkish powers made no endeavor to stop them entering the Armenian-controlled segments of the city; it is guessed that they were purposely permitted in with the goal that they would go through the constrained nourishment supplies of the safeguards. 

The precise date of the consuming of the religious community isn't known beyond a shadow of a doubt. On April 27 1915, a message sent "To Americans, or any Foreign Consul" by Clarence Ussher and Ernest Yarrow, American preachers in Van, said that "From our window we could evidently observe Shushantz aflame on its mountain-side and Varak Monastery, with its invaluable store of antiquated original copies, going up in smoke." However, a kindred teacher, Elizabeth Barrows Ussher, Clarence Ussher's significant other, wrote in her journal that the religious community was assaulted by 200 rangers and troopers on April 30, yet they were rebuffed. She gave May 4 as the day the religious community was scorched. Another evangelist instructor Grace H. Knapp related, be that as it may, that "On the eighth May we saw the spot on fire, and Varak Monastery close by, with its inestimable antiquated original copies, additionally went up in smoke." 

Countless structures enduring the 1915 decimation were crushed during the 1960s. Starting at 2006, the religious community's remaining parts were utilized an animal dwellingplace. As indicated by student of history Ara Sarafian, starting at 2012, "great areas have scarcely made due until our days." Dr. Jenny B. White, a researcher on Turkey, wrote in 2013 that, on her visit, the remaining parts of the religious community "comprised of just a couple of block vaults used to house goats in the midst of a grasp of tumbledown Kurdish homes." The best-saved segment of the cloister is the congregation of Surb Gevorg (St. George), which is presently taken care of by an overseer. The vault is mostly fell and contains a few hints of enduring frescoes. The vault of the congregation of Surb Nshan is altogether gone. 

In February 2010, after the remodel of the Holy Cross Cathedral at Akdamar Island in Lake Van, Halil Berk, the Deputy Governor of Van Province, reported that the Governor's Office looked to reestablish Varagavank and the Ktuts religious community at ÄÂarpanak Island. In June of that year, the senator additionally expressed that the cloister at ÄÂarpanak Island and Varagavank would be revamped "soon." In October 2010 "Radikal" revealed that an adjacent mosque, worked in 1997, would be obliterated to account for the rebuilding of Varagavank. 

The cloister was harmed because of the 2011 Van tremor. As indicated by Ara Sarafian, "portions of the primary church fallen, while different parts were essentially debilitated. Old splits got greater, new ones showed up." Turkish designers purportedly examined it and reported that they would initiate rebuilding work in the spring of 2012. Sarafian composed that "such guarantees have been made before and one should be somewhat incredulous. The present condition of the congregation makes such work a lot harder than whenever previously." He noted in a 2012 article that the neighborhood and commonplace governments bolstered the protection and rebuilding of the religious community. In October 2012, the craftsman Raffi Bedrosyan, who added to the reclamation of the St. Giragos Church in DiyarbakÃ¤Är, expressed that he had would have liked to reestablish Varagavank and included that "Both Ankara and Van consented to dispatch the reclamation venture, yet social and characteristic hindrances deferred the procedure.". In 2017 it was reported that the rest of the stones of the religious community are routinely taken off by the neighborhood experts to fabricate a nearby mosque and different advancements with them. 

"Taraf" revealed in September 2012 that the religious community is possessed by the Turkish writer and media official Fatih AltaylÃ¤Ä. In a meeting, AltaylÃ¤Ä told the paper that the cloister had a place with his granddad and he acquired it from his dad. The religious community was reallocated amid the Armenian Genocide. A gathering of Armenians in Turkey, driven by the lobbyist Nadya Uygun, began a request requesting that he "Apply to the Armenian Patriarchate of Turkey and exchange the title deed of the congregation to the concerned [Armenian community] establishment." Altayli told "Agos" that he is prepared to offer it to the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople, however no administration expert has moved toward him to react to his idea to give back the congregation to its proprietors, and that they showed no enthusiasm for participating. Progressive Socialist Workers' Party (DSÃÂ°P) activists showed toward the beginning of October 2012 preceding the HabertÄÅºrk home office in BeyoÃ¤Âlu, Istanbul requesting the arrival of the religious community land to the Armenians. As of September 2014, there was no advancement. In 2017 it was recorded that the Turkish government effectively endeavored to tear the stones of what stays from the cloister to build a mosque, houses and different improvements in the territory. 

The religious community was made out of six places of worship, gavit, narthex, (nakhasrah), and different structures. The principle church of Varagavank was called Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God). It dated to the eleventh century and was comparative in plan to the conspicuous Saint Hripsime Church in Vagharshapat. The most punctual structure was on the southern piece of the troupe and was known as Surb Sopia (tenth century). Ruler Khushush left an engraving (dated 981) on its western divider. 

In the tenth century, Queen Mlke, the spouse of Gagik I, introduced the cloister the "Good news of Queen Mlke" (), a standout amongst the best known Armenian lit up original copies. In the 14thÃ¢ÂÂ16th hundreds of years the religious community turned into a noteworthy focus of original copy generation. Various Varagavank original copies are presently kept at the Matenadaran in Yerevan. 

Raffi makes reference to the religious community in volume two of the novel "Flashes" (ÃÅ¥Ã´Å¼ÅÄÅÄ¾ÅÅ¾ÅÄ¾Ã¶ÂÃ¢Å¥, 1883Ã¢ÂÂ87). The conspicuous writer Hovhannes Tumanyan composed an article about the religious community in 1910, on the fiftieth commemoration of Mkrtich Khrimian getting to be father of Varag and the cloister's resulting restoration as an incredible focal point of instruction and culture.
