The name Astrid Peth produced some theory before the scene's communicated over the discoveries that "Astrid" is a re-arranged word of "TARDIS", and that "Peth" signifies "thing" in Welsh. Notwithstanding, the scene set up no such association. On "Specialist Who Confidential", Minogue portrays Astrid as a "visionary" and that gathering with the Doctor revives Astrid's craving to investigate.

Gareth McLean, a TV author for "The Guardian", portrayed Minogue as "not that good...she's clear and lifeless". McLean composed: 

"There's no science among Astrid and the Doctor, she conveys her lines with a genuine absence of conviction and hence we never truly put stock in Astrid as a character. Where Catherine Tate's Donna in a year ago's unique was domineering, Kylie Minogue's Astrid is scarcely there by any means. It makes you wonder why giving Kylie was viewed a role as an overthrow. She's a pop starÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ obviously she's going to express yes to being transmitted into a huge number of homes in the run-up to Christmas. She has a duff collection to sell. In truth, Kylie ought to be thankful to ["Doctor Who"]." 

David Belcher of "The Herald" composed that Minogue looked too old to even think about playing a server. Sam Wollaston of "The Guardian" asserted Kylie's execution was "frustrating" and did not satisfy those of Freema Agyeman or Billie Piper in "Specialist Who".
