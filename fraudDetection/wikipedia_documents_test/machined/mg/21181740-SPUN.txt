SM "U-28 or U-XXVIII" was a "U-27" class U-pontoon or submarine for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. "U-28", worked by the Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT) at the Pola Navy Yard, was propelled in January 1917 and authorized in June. 

She had a solitary structure and was only over long. She dislodged almost when surfaced and over when submerged. Her two diesel motors moved her at up to superficially, while her twin electric engines impelled her at up to while submerged. She was equipped with two bow torpedo tubes and could convey a heap of up to four torpedoes. She was likewise outfitted with a deck weapon and an automatic weapon. 

Amid her administration profession, "U-28" sank the British Q ship and nine different boats, sending a joined tonnage of to the base. "U-28" was surrendered at Venice in 1919, allowed to Italy as a war reparation and separated the next year. 

Austria-Hungary's U-vessel armada was to a great extent out of date at the flare-up of World War I. The Austro-Hungarian Navy fulfilled its most critical needs by acquiring five Type UB I submarines that contained the from Germany, by raising and recommissioning the depressed French submarine "Curie" as , and by structure four submarines of the that depended on the 1911 Danish "Havmanden" class. 

After these means mitigated their most dire needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy chose the German Type UB II structure for its freshest submarines in mid 1915. The Germans were hesitant to dispense any of their wartime assets to Austro-Hungarian development, yet were eager to offer designs for up to six of the UB II vessels to be built under permit in Austria-Hungary. The Navy consented to the proposition and bought the plans from AG Weser of Bremen. 

"U-28" dislodged surfaced and submerged. She had a solitary frame with seat tanks, and was long with a light emission a draft of . For drive, she had two shafts, twin diesel motors of for surface running, and twin electric engines of for submerged travel. She was prepared to do while surfaced and keeping in mind that submerged. Despite the fact that there is no particular documentation of a range for "U-28" in "Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906Ã¢ÂÂ1921", the German UB II vessels, whereupon the "U-27" class was based, had a scope of over at surfaced, and at submerged. "U-27"- class vessels were intended for a team of 23Ã¢ÂÂ24. 

"U-28" was outfitted with two bow torpedo tubes and could convey a supplement of four torpedoes. She was likewise outfitted with a 75Ã¢Â mm/26 (3.0Ã¢Â in) deck weapon and an automatic rifle. 

After mind boggling political dealings to designate creation of the class among Austrian and Hungarian firms, "U-28" was requested from Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT) on 12 October 1915. She was set somewhere near mid 1916 at the Pola Navy Yard, and propelled on 8 January 1917. 

After her finishing, "U-28" was authorized into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 26 June 1917 under the direction of "Linienschiffsleutnant" Zdenko HudeÃ¤Âek. Already in direction of , HudeÃ¤Âek was a 30-year-old local of Theresienstadt (present-day TerezÄÂ­n in the Czech Republic). 

Four days after the U-vessel's authorizing, HudeÃ¤Âek accomplished his first kill in charge of "U-28". On 30 June, while on watch about east of Malta, "U-28" happened upon the 4,809-ton British steamer "Haigh Hall". The turret body dispatch was conveying wheat from Bombay to Naples when torpedoed and sunk by HudeÃ¤Âek. After three days, the British India traveler dispatch met a similar destiny. Despite the fact that escorted by an Italian destroyer and a trawler, "Mongara" was torpedoed and sunk by "U-28" just from the barrier at Messina. The 8,205-ton linerÃ¢ÂÂthe biggest ship sunk by "U-28"Ã¢ÂÂwas on the way from Sydney to London when she went down, yet was saved any death toll in the assault. In eight days in commission, "U-28"s count was more than 13,000 tons, officially surpassing the aggregates of each of the four U-vessels of the . 

The next month, "U-28" sank the 3,881-ton collier "Maston" from Cape Spartivento, Calabria, on 13 August, killing two men of the British ship's group. Three days after "Maston" went down, "U-28" sank "Bradford City", a 3,683-ton British Q dispatch in the Straits of Messina, with no death toll. "Bradford City", working under the nom de plume", "had been especially withdrawn to the Straits to chase "U-28" and had disregarded requests to continue to port from officers unconscious of her maritime status. After the torpedo struck, the ship's "alarm party" had taken to the vessels in the desire for baiting her aggressor to the surface, yet the entry of the French maritime trawler "Hiver" drove "U-28" away before the firearm groups on board "Bradford City" could connect with the submarine. "Bradford City" sank inside 30 minutes off San Remo. In October, "U-28" finished off her 1917 rundown of exploited people with "Bontnewydd", a British steamer sunk north-upper east of Susa. The 3,296-ton steamer was cruising in balance from Marseilles for Karachi. 

In January 1918, "U-28" sank an extra three boats. "Bosforo", an Italian steamer of 2,723 tons set out toward Salonika, was sent to the base close Cape Spartivento on 12 January. The next day, "U-28" dispatched the British steamer "Rapallo" south of Cape Peloro. One mariner on board the one-year-old ship kicked the bucket in the assault, which happened while the ship was made a beeline for Messina in counterbalance. On 21 January, "West Wales", a collier headed from Barry to Alexandria, was sunk from Malta, taking her heap of coal and two of her team to the base. 

On 8 March, "U-28" assaulted two boats, sinking one of them. The main ship, "Mitra", a 5,592-ton tanker was hit by "U-28" however had the capacity to make port in Malta with her payload of oil. Later in the month, "U-28" sank from Linosa, killing one mariner in the assault. The 1905 British ship was conveying cotton and cottonseed from Alexandria for London when the assault happened. After three days, "Stolt Nielsen", a 5,684-ton steamship, was sent to the base from Malta. Conveying a general freight for the Admiralty when she went down, the British ship ended up being the last ship to be sunk by "U-28". 

At the war's end, "U-28" was surrendered to Italy at Venice in 1919. Later granted to Italy as a war reparation, she was rejected at Venice in 1920. In her 18-month profession, "U-28" sank ten boats with a consolidated tonnage of 44,743, and harmed an eleventh.
