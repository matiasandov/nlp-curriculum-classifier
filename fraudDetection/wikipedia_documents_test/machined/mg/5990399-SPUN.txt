Jan Mayensfield 

Jan Mayensfield is an aerodrome serving Olonkinbyen in Jan Mayen, Norway. Worked by the Norwegian Armed Forces, it serves the island's solitary populace at the consolidated military and meteorological station. It has an earth runway numbered 06Ã¢ÂÂ24. 

The landing strip was worked regarding the LORAN-C transmitter at Olonkinbyen and was finished in 1960. Jan Mayensfield is served eight times each year by Lockheed C-130 Hercules flying machine of the 335 Squadron from BodÄÂ¸ Main Air Station, which give supplies and change team at the station. The close-by Beerenberg well of lava can cause a KÄÄrmÄÄn wind, which makes troublesome landing conditions. 

North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Norwegian Armed Forces began development of a military correspondences station at Olonkinbyen in 1958. At initial a LORAN-A transmitter was manufactured, trailed by a LORAN-C transmitter in 1960. In August, it was declared that the island would get a landing strip to permit constant activity of the transmitter. Initially, the aerodrome comprised of a segment of the island's earth street. This was picked to decrease the administration of development. The main air ship to arrive was a Consolidated PBY Catalina of the Royal Norwegian Air Force on 17 September 1960. 

The main regular citizen airplane was a Douglas DC-4 worked by Braathens SAFE, which arrived with certain columnists on board on 29 October 1961. Other early flying machine working to Jan Mayen were the Grumman HU-16 Albatross and the Douglas DC-6. The head officer of the Norwegian military's correspondences division was later condemned by Chief of Defense Bjarne ÄÂen, who closed: "Men of their word, I won't have any further development of airplane terminals on Norwegian soil by the Communications Division without the plans being exhibited to the Central Command." The field was named Jan Mayensfield, to some degree as a joke having the motion picture star Jayne Mansfield at the top of the priority list, however this name stuck. 

In 1970, an unexpected ejection in Beerenberg constrained the quick clearing of the station. A Hercules was dispatched to the island and effectively arrived on the strip. From that point the Hercules turned into the normal military flying machine at Jan Mayen. Airplane bit by bit took over a greater amount of the vehicle to the island, and from 1973 all provisions with the exception of diesel and extraordinary cargo was transported by ship. From 1975 the 333 Squadron would at times drop mail and supplies utilizing the P-3 Orion as an enhancement to the arrivals of the Hercules. 

Jan Mayensfield's single normal administration is the Royal Norwegian Air Force's Lockheed C-130 Hercules, which work to the island eight times each year. The flying machine are a piece of the 335 Squadron, based at Gardermoen Air Station, despite the fact that the flights from Jan Mayen work from BodÄÂ¸ Main Air Station. The runway isn't open for business traffic, in spite of the fact that it tends to be utilized for research and inquiry and salvage activities. 

The soil runway is being adjusted 06Ã¢ÂÂ24. Jan Mayensfield has variable climate conditions, a great deal of mist and frequently has a KÄÄrmÄÄn wind. The KÄÄrmÄÄn wind is made in the wake of the Beerenberg spring of gushing lava, bringing about customary vortex avenues and lee-waves. This can make unexpected alter the breeze course on the island. 

In 1991, a C-130 Hercules airplane from the Royal Norwegian Air Force nearly slammed after take off due to KÄÄrmÄÄn twist abruptly moving.
