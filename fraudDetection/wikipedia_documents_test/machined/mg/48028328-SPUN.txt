"Regina Maria Pia" was set down in July 1862, was propelled in April 1863, and was finished in April 1864. 

"Regina Maria Pia" partook in the Battle of Lissa amid the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. She assaulted the unarmored frigates in the Austrian second division, and harmed two vessels. Her profession was restricted after the war, attributable to the rise of increasingly current ironclads and a serious decrease in the Italian maritime spending following their thrashing at Lissa. She was modified as a focal battery dispatch some time after Lissa, and was modernized again in the late 1880s. "Regina Maria Pia" was in the long run separated for scrap in 1904. 

"Regina Maria Pia" was long generally; she had a light emission a normal draft of . She uprooted ordinarily and up to at full burden. "Regina Maria Pia" was a broadside ironclad, and she was at first outfitted with a primary battery of four firearms and twenty-two weapons, however her deadly implement changed all through her profession. The ship was ensured by iron belt protective layer that was thick and stretched out for the whole length of the body at the waterline. The battery deck was ensured by of iron plate. She had a team of 480Ã¢ÂÂ485Ã¢Â officers and men.

Her motor delivered a top speed of from . She could steam for at a speed of . The ship was at first yacht fixed to enhance the steam motor, however her poles were later decreased to a barque rig. At last, she lost her cruising rig totally, having it supplanted with a couple of military poles with battling tops. 

"Regina Maria Pia" was worked at the French shipyard "SociÄÅ¡tÄÅ¡ Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la MÄÅ¡diterranÄÅ¡e" in La Seyne. Her bottom was set down on 22 July 1862 and her finished structure was propelled on 28 April 1863. The ship was finished on 17 April 1864 and conveyed to the Italian armada. In June 1866, Italy announced war on Austria, as a component of the Third Italian War of Independence, which was battled simultaneously with the Austro-Prussian War. The Italian armada authority, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, at first received a careful strategy; he was reluctant to hazard fight with the Austrian Navy, in spite of the way that the Austrian armada was a lot flimsier than his own. Persano asserted he was basically looking out for the ironclad slam , "on the way" from Britain, however his inaction debilitated assurance in the armada, with huge numbers of his subordinates straightforwardly blaming him for weakness. 

Back Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff conveyed the Austrian armada to Ancona on June 27, trying to draw out the Italians. At the time, huge numbers of the Italian boats were in disorder; 

a few boats did not have their whole deadly implement, and a few others had issues with their motors. "Regina Maria Pia" was one of only a handful couple of ironclads fit for activity, so she, , and framed up to get ready to assault Tegetthoff's boats. Persano held a gathering of war on board "Principe di Carignano" to decide if he should fight to connect with Tegetthoff, yet at that point, the Austrians had pulled back, settling on the choice unsettled. The Minister of the Navy, Agostino Depretis, encouraged Persano to act and proposed the island of Lissa, to reestablish Italian certainty after their annihilation at the Battle of Custoza the earlier month. On 7 July, Persano left Ancona and led a breadth into the Adriatic, yet experienced no Austrian ships and returned on the thirteenth. 

On 16 July, Persano removed the Italian armada from Ancona, destined for Lissa, where they touched base on the eighteenth. With them, they brought troop transports conveying 3,000 warriors; the Italian warships started shelling the Austrian strongholds on the island, with the goal of finding the officers once the fortifications had been hushed. Accordingly, the Austrian Navy sent the armada under Tegetthoff to assault the Italian boats. "Regina Maria Pia" was around then in the third Division, directed by Captain Augusto Riboty, alongside the ironclads , and , and the beach front resistance deliver . In the wake of spending the eighteenth ineffectively barraging the Austrian posts, the Italians pulled back late in the day, getting ready to dispatch another assault the next morning. Persano sent a large portion of his boats to shell the town of Vis, however he was unfit to impact the arrival. 

The following morning, Persano requested another assault; four ironclads would drive the harbor guards at Vis while "Regina Maria Pia" and the remainder of the armada would endeavor to smother the external strongholds. This second assault likewise ended up being a disappointment, however Persano chose to make a third endeavor the following day. "Regina Maria Pia" and the heft of the armada would again endeavor to cripple the external fortresses in anticipation of the arrival. Before the Italians could start the assault, the dispatch pontoon arrived, bringing updates on Tegetthoff's methodology. Persano's armada was in disorder; the three boats of Admiral Giovanni Vacca's first Division were three miles toward the upper east from Persano's fundamental power, and three different ironclads were further away toward the west. Persano promptly requested his boats to shape up with Vacca's, preferred choice side by side arrangement, and afterward in line ahead development. "Regina Maria Pia" at first was the last ship in the line, however "Varese" later signed up behind her. 

In the blink of an eye before the activity started, Persano chose to leave his lead and exchange to "Affondatore", however none of his subordinates on different boats knew about the change. They were therefore left to battle as people without course. All the more perilously, by halting "Re d'Italia", he enabled a huge hole to open up between Vacca's three boats and the remainder of the armada. Tegetthoff took his armada through the hole among Vacca's and Persano's boats, trying to part the Italian line and start a scuffle. He neglected to smash any Italian vessels on the main pass, so he moved back in the direction of Persano's boats, and took "Re d'Italia", "San Martino", and "Palestro" under overwhelming flame. The Austrians immediately exacted genuine harm on "Re d'Italia" and "Palestro". While Tegetthoff's ironclads were assaulting Persano's division, Riboty's division, including "Regina Maria Pia", connected with Anton von Petz's division of unarmored steam frigates. In the scuffle, "Regina Maria Pia" crashed into "San Martino", harming the last's slam bow. 

After "Palestro" pulled back, the Austrian ironclads directed their concentration toward the boats of Riboty's division. At this point, "Re d'Italia" had been slammed and sunk, and "Palestro" was consuming angrily. Persano severed the commitment to combine his powers, yet his boats, low on coal and ammo, and with seriously unsettled groups, couldn't be encouraged by Persano's irresolute endeavor to dispatch an assault. The Italian armada started to pull back, trailed by the Austrians; as night started to fall, the restricting armadas withdrew totally, setting out toward Ancona and Pola, individually. "Regina Maria Pia" had one iron plate obliterated, and another had a steel shot held up in it. She had been severely singed, and the flares had almost contacted her powder magazine. Consequently, she had harmed the Austrian ship of the line and the ironclad . After the fight, Vacca supplanted Persano; he was requested to assault the fundamental Austrian maritime base at Pola, yet the war finished before the task could be done. 

For the remainder of her long vocation, "Regina Maria Pia" served in an assortment of jobs, both in the principle armada and in Italy's pilgrim realm. In the quick repercussions of the war, the Italian maritime spending plan was definitely diminished; so huge were the cuts that the armada had extraordinary trouble in preparing its ironclad squadron to assault the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870, as a feature of the wars of Italian unification. Rather, the boats were laid up and the mariners recruited to man them were sent home. Some time after 1866, the ship was modified as a focal battery deliver, with a large portion of her firearms situated in a focal, protected casemate. Two different weapons were put in the bow as pursue firearms, with a third mounted as a stern chaser. Right now, her combat hardware was additionally changed, to two firearms in the bow and nine 8Ã¢Â in weapons, four on each broadside and the toward the end in the stern. 

"Regina Maria Pia" partook in the starting service for the ironclad on 29 September 1880; likewise present were the Italian ironclad and King Umberto I on board his yacht, and the British ironclads and with Vice Admiral George Tryon, the two individuals from the Mediterranean Fleet. Somewhere in the range of 1888 and 1890, the ship had her barque rig supplanted with military poles. At this point, she had been rearmed with eight weapons in the casemate and a few littler firearms for short proximity protection against torpedo vessels. These included five firearms, four weapons, and eight Hotchkiss pistol gun. She additionally gotten three torpedo tubes. The ship was stricken from the maritime register in 1904 and in this manner separated for scrap.
