2011 Orange Bowl 

The 2011 Discover Orange Bowl was a postseason school football bowl diversion between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the Stanford Cardinal on Monday, January 3, 2011, at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Stanford vanquished Virginia Tech 40Ã¢ÂÂ12. The amusement was a piece of the 2010Ã¢ÂÂ2011 Bowl Championship Series of the 2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season and was the closing round of the period for the two groups. The diversion, the 77th version of the Orange Bowl, was broadcast in the United States on ESPN and the communicate was seen by an expected 8.23Ã¢Â million watchers. 

Virginia Tech was chosen to take an interest in the Orange Bowl after a 11Ã¢ÂÂ2 customary season that finished with a 44Ã¢ÂÂ33 success in the 2010 ACC Championship Game. Stanford was picked as the other portion of the matchup following a 11Ã¢ÂÂ1 crusade that incorporated the school's best-ever normal season record. That execution earned the Cardinal a No. 4 positioning in the BCS Poll and the programmed offer to a BCS diversion that goes with a best 4 positioning of a second school in a gathering other than the boss. In the weeks prior to that amusement, media consideration concentrated on the two groups' turnarounds from authentic troubles and the execution of Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck. The amusement likewise was the principal Orange Bowl not supported by FedEx in 21 years, finishing the longest-running title sponsorship bargain among the real dishes. 

The diversion commenced at 8:39Ã¢Â pm in warm climate, and Stanford scored initial, a touchdown, with its third hostile belonging. Virginia Tech quickly led the pack with a security pursued by its very own touchdown, yet Stanford reestablished a 13Ã¢ÂÂ12 preferred standpoint before halftime. In the second half, Stanford pulled far from Virginia Tech as it scored 13 points in the second from last quarter and 14 in the fourth while holding the Hokies scoreless. 

In acknowledgment of his execution amid the amusement, Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck was named the diversion's most important player. He set a Stanford bowl-diversion record for touchdowns, and tossed three of those scores to tight end Coby Fleener, who set a Stanford and Orange Bowl record with 173 getting yards. The two groups made instructing changes after the diversion, as Stanford head mentor Jim Harbaugh left the group to mentor the National Football League's San Francisco 49ers and Virginia Tech supplanted a few associate mentors. Players from each group were chosen in the 2011 NFL Draft. 

The Orange Bowl is one of five Bowl Championship Series (BCS) bowl recreations that have been played at the finish of each school football season since 2006. As characterized by contract, the bowl coordinates the boss of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) against an everywhere pick picked by an uncommon council. On December 4, 2010, the Virginia Tech Hokies vanquished the Florida State Seminoles in the 2010 ACC Championship Game, in this manner winning a programmed offer to the 2011 Orange Bowl. 

The everywhere spot in the Orange Bowl was filled by means of a round-robin determination technique characterized by the other Bowl Championship arrangement amusements (the Sugar, Fiesta, and Rose dishes) and the programmed offers. In the event that a diversion's programmed offer group is chosen for the BCS National Championship Game, it is permitted to choose a substitution group. In the 2010 season, groups generally assigned for the Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl were picked for the national title amusement. Following the two compensatory determinations are the everywhere picks. The request of everywhere determinations turns yearly among the BCS bowls. 

For the January 2011 amusements, the Sugar Bowl chosen first, trailed by the Orange Bowl and Fiesta Bowl. The Sugar Bowl picked Ohio State, which left the Orange Bowl to settle on two groups authoritatively bound to show up in a BCS bowl diversion. These were Stanford, which was ensured a BCS offered by its No. 4 national positioning, and Connecticut, boss of the Big East Conference. Favoring Stanford's capability to draw an expansive TV group of onlookers, the Orange Bowl chosen the Cardinal, departing Connecticut to the Fiesta Bowl. 

The Stanford Cardinal started the 2010 season subsequent to going 8Ã¢ÂÂ5 in 2009 under first year recruit quarterback Andrew Luck. The 2009 season saw the Cardinal annihilation eighth-positioned Oregon and No. 9 USC in transit to breaking a seven-year bowl diversion dry season with an appearance in the 2009 Sun Bowl against Oklahoma. Stanford changed a few position mentors and its cautious technique in the offseason, and however the Cardinal returned 17 of 24 conceivable players from the earlier year's beginning lineup, few trusted the Cardinal would be among the best groups in the nation. In the yearly preseason survey of media individuals covering the Pacific-10, Stanford was picked to complete fourth in the 10-group gathering. Broadly, Stanford showed up in the "likewise accepting votes" classifications of the preseason surveys. In the AP Poll, the group was 27th; in the mentors' survey, the Cardinal was 32nd. 

The Cardinal opened the season by vanquishing Football Bowl Subdivision group Sacramento State, at that point beat meeting adversary UCLA in the main Pacific-10 round of the period. The success over Sacramento State drove Stanford to No. 25 broadly, and the success over UCLA raised Stanford to No. 19, the rank it held when it crushed Atlantic Coast Conference enemy Wake Forest 68Ã¢ÂÂ24 on September 18. The next week, Stanford crushed Notre Dame as the country's No. 16 group, and the success raised the Cardinal to No. 9. 

On October 2, No. 9 Stanford played No. 4 Oregon. The diversion was touted as a matchup between two of the top offenses in school football and was broadly broadcast. Stanford drove 21Ã¢ÂÂ3 after the primary quarter and 31Ã¢ÂÂ24 at halftime, yet the Cardinal permitted 28 unanswered focuses in the second half and lost to Oregon, 52Ã¢ÂÂ31. Oregon later proceeded to play in the BCS National Championship amusement, and the thrashing was Stanford's solitary one of the period. The misfortune dropped Stanford to No. 16 in the surveys, yet the group bounced back the next week to vanquish USC on a very late field objective, 37Ã¢ÂÂ35. 

The triumph over USC started a series of wins, the best in Stanford football history since the season of the Korean War. The week subsequent to beating USC, Stanford crushed Washington State, moving to a 6Ã¢ÂÂ1 record out of the blue since 1970. The Cardinal rose to No. 13 broadly and vanquished the University of Washington on October 30. Against No. 15 Arizona, Stanford coordinated its past season's success all out. On November 13, Stanford crushed Arizona State in an intently battled 17Ã¢ÂÂ13 win that conveyed the Cardinal football crew to 9Ã¢ÂÂ1 and its best record since 1951. The next week, Stanford beat conventional opponent California in The Big Game by a 48Ã¢ÂÂ14 score. It was the biggest edge of triumph in the competition since 1930. Stanford's last ordinary season amusement was against the Oregon State Beavers, and Stanford won the challenge convincingly, 38Ã¢ÂÂ0. The No. 4 and No. 5 broadly positioned groups had lost before that day, lifting Stanford in the surveys and in position for a Bowl Championship Series diversion compartment. 

The Virginia Tech Hokies entered the 2010 season after a 2009 battle that saw the group complete 10Ã¢ÂÂ3, including a season-finishing win in the 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl against the Tennessee Volunteers. As a result of that season-finishing triumph and the Hokies' general great execution amid the 2009 season, Virginia Tech was positioned No. 10 in preseason national surveying. The Hokies' first round of the period was a broadly broadcast challenge against then-No. 3 Boise State at FedExField close Washington, D.C.. Since the diversion was the first of the period to include two top-10 groups, it got a lot of media inclusion. Amid the diversion, Virginia Tech fell behind 17Ã¢ÂÂ0 in the principal quarter, yet encouraged to take a 21Ã¢ÂÂ20 lead right off the bat in the second from last quarter. The two groups exchanged the lead, substituting scoring drives until Boise State scored a touchdown with 1:06 remaining. Virginia Tech was unfit to answer one last time, and Boise State earned a 33Ã¢ÂÂ30 triumph. 

The nearby misfortune disheartened the Virginia Tech players, who at that point had just five days to plan for their next adversary, delicately respected James Madison University. At Lane Stadium, Virginia Tech's home field, James Madison upset the intensely supported Hokies, 21Ã¢ÂÂ16. The misfortune was just the second time in school football history that a group positioned broadly was crushed by a group from the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision. In the wake of the misfortune, Virginia Tech tumbled from No. 13 to out of the surveys altogether. 

Following the misfortune, seniors on the football crew held a players-just gathering with an end goal to rally the group. Players later reviewed that gathering as the defining moment in the group's season. The following week, Virginia Tech earned its first win of the period, a 49Ã¢ÂÂ27 triumph over East Carolina in Lane Stadium. The Hokies pursued that by venturing out to Boston College for a 19Ã¢ÂÂ0 success, their first shutout since 2006. 

The two triumphs were the beginning of a series of wins that saw the Hokies complete the customary season without another misfortune. Following Boston College, they vanquished No. 23 NC State in its home arena, 41Ã¢ÂÂ30. They crushed nonconference adversary Central Michigan, at that point beat meeting rival Wake Forest and reemerged the surveys at No. 25. Their situation in the surveys moved with every rival they vanquished. They beat Duke as the No. 25 group, Georgia Tech as the No. 23 group, North Carolina as the No. 20 group and No. 23 Miami as the No. 16 group. The Miami triumph secured Tech the division title and a space in the ACC title diversion, yet the Hokies still won their last recently booked amusement, the yearly Commonwealth Cup competition against Virginia. In the ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech vanquished Florida State 44Ã¢ÂÂ33, securing the ACC's programmed offer to the Orange Bowl. 

In 2008, sports channel ESPN won the privilege to communicate Bowl Championship Series amusements somewhere in the range of 2011 and 2014. In remuneration, it consented to pay the BCS $125Ã¢Â million every year, more than a contending offer from Fox ($100Ã¢Â million), which had been paying $82.5Ã¢Â million every year for the agreement that finished in 2010. To adjust the greater expense of broadcasting the diversions, ESPN requested more cash for title sponsorship of each amusement. Transportation organization FedEx, which had turned into the Orange Bowl's title support in 1990 and was the longest ceaseless supporter of any bowl diversion, shrugged off ESPN's expanded demandsÃ¢ÂÂabout $20Ã¢Â million every year and required promoting outside the Orange BowlÃ¢ÂÂand finished its sponsorship. 

Citi, the title patron of the Rose Bowl, moreover finished its sponsorship over the expanded expense. ESPN promptly started seeking after an elective title patron for each amusement. Treat maker The Hershey Company was an early probability for the Orange Bowl, and the organization considered titling the amusement the Reese's Orange Bowl, however dealings failed to work out. In August, ESPN achieved an arrangement with Mastercard organization Discover Financial to make the diversion the Discover Orange Bowl through 2014. 

Pregame media inclusion of the 2011 Orange Bowl concentrated on the way in which the two groups included had turned around their fortunes amid the 2010 school football season. Stanford had its longest series of wins since 1991 its most successes ever, and was four years expelled from a one-win season, while Virginia Tech turned into the main group in school football history to win 11 back to back diversions in a season in the wake of losing its initial two. The two groups had never played one another, yet they shared a typical 2010 adversary, Wake Forest. Prior to the Orange Bowl, Wake Forest head mentor Jim Grobe said he didn't see much contrast in quality. Another purpose of discussion was the poor execution of the ACC in nonconference diversions and Virginia Tech's poor past execution against groups positioned in the main 5. The Hokies had won only one of 27 recreations against groups in that class. Somewhat in view of this factor, spread bettors favored Stanford by three points when the primary chances were discharged December 10, an edge that different associations either kept consistent or raised to 3.5 focuses constantly of the diversion. It was the first run through all season the Hokies were point spread longshots. 

Two evenings before the amusement, Virginia Tech running back David Wilson and security Antone Exum missed a 1Ã¢Â am time limitation. As discipline, Virginia Tech head mentor Frank Beamer suspended the two players for the primary quarter of the Orange Bowl. 

Virginia Tech and Stanford each were allocated 17,500 tickets to sell through their school box workplaces, yet each school had issues selling that sum. For Stanford, whose essential grounds is in California, the separation fans were required to travel was a noteworthy impediment. Stanford head mentor Jim Harbaugh stated, "It will most likely be more Hokie fans there than Stanford fans. That distant from home it presumably could be an unfriendly domain for us." 

Orange Bowl coordinators anticipated that Virginia Tech fans, who were found nearer to the site of the amusement, would be pulled in by its nearness and the warm climate offered by southern Florida. Delta Air Lines added more flights from Virginia to Florida in expectation. To allure more fans to visit, the travel industry authorities wanted to venture up their promoting so as to support the monetary effect of the occasion, assessed in 2009 at $200Ã¢Â million. The publicizing effort was a troublesome sell in light of the fact that the diversion was planned for the main Monday after New Year's Day, the date when most American laborers come back to their occupations after the New Year. 

Halfway in light of this reality, ticket deals were moderate. By December 23, Tech had sold only 6,500 of its 17,500-situate designation, while Stanford fans had obtained 9,000 tickets from their assignment. These figures expanded somewhat as the diversion day drew nearer, however the schools were hampered by a few variables. The tickets doled out to the schools were in less-attractive seats, and numerous seats were accessible unmistakably more inexpensively in the auxiliary market. In one model, an upper-deck ticket sold by Virginia Tech cost $65, while a comparable ticket was accessible for $12 through an online ticket vender. The two schools were compelled to buy the staying unsold tickets, costing each few hundred thousand dollars. 

Stanford's offense was instructed by redshirt sophomore quarterback Andrew Luck, who finished 70 percent of his pass endeavors, increasing 3,051Ã¢Â yards, 28Ã¢Â touchdowns, and 7Ã¢Â interceptions. The touchdown mark was a Stanford single-season record. He likewise increased 438Ã¢Â yards running the ball, setting a Stanford record for surging by a quarterback, and his joined hurrying and passing all out set a record at Stanford for all out offense. On December 13, Luck completed second in the voting in favor of the Heisman Trophy, the yearly honor given to the best player in school football that season. NCAA rules permit a player three years expelled from secondary school to enter the NFL Draft, and despite the fact that he was just a sophomore in 2010, he fulfilled the three-year guideline at the finish of the period. Prior to the Orange Bowl, media and fans guessed as to Luck's probable decision. 

Karma circulated his passes generally equally among his recipients. Doug Baldwin was the group's driving collector, with 56 gatherings for 824 yards and 9 touchdowns amid the ordinary season. Wide recipient and kick returner Chris Owusu, who played in just six recreations due to knee damage, experienced arthroscopic medical procedure and was relied upon to play in the Orange Bowl. He was the group's fourth-driving recipient as far as yardage, getting 24 goes for 394 yards and 3 touchdowns. 

Stanford's running diversion was driven factually by sophomore running back Stepfan Taylor, who earned 15Ã¢Â touchdowns amid the customary season. Prior to the diversion, Cardinal head mentor Jim Harbaugh said he wanted to give three other running backsÃ¢ÂÂTyler Gaffney, Jeremy Stewart, and Anthony WilkersonÃ¢ÂÂopportunities to convey the ball when Taylor was removed from the amusement. 

Virginia Tech's prosperity at blocking kicks amid the 24 years of head mentor Frank Beamer's residency made Stanford invest additional energy in pregame rehearses on kick security. 

Due to his achievement in directing Stanford's offense, head mentor Harbaugh was referenced as a contender for the empty head training places of different colleges and National Football League groups. In the leadup to the Orange Bowl, be that as it may, Harbaugh wouldn't remark on any of the potential outcomes and said he needed to concentrate on directing his group to triumph. Stanford players resounded that line. "We've contributed a lot to give something to that effect a chance to occupy us," linebacker Shayne Skov said December 30. 

Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor was the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year and its title amusement MVP. As indicated by pregame media inclusion, he exhibited a differentiating style to Stanford's Luck. Taylor picked up tossed for 2,521Ã¢Â yards and set a school record with 23 passing touchdowns, yet was lauded essentially for his physical versatility and capacity to evade guarded weight, something Luck needed. Taylor's essence was a contributing component to Tech's hostile accomplishment in 2010. Virginia Tech's offense was the most gainful since hostile facilitator Bryan Stinespring joined the group in 2001. It set group records for focuses and absolute yards, and drove the ACC in scoring and red-zone productivity. 

Notwithstanding Taylor's prosperity passing the ball, the Hokies additionally had an effective running offense. Running back Ryan Williams, who was restricted for a significant part of the period due to damage, had 473Ã¢Â rushingÃ¢Â yards. Individual running back Darren Evans, who missed the 2008 season in view of damage, increased 11Ã¢Â touchdowns. Sophomore running back David Wilson increased 616Ã¢Â yards. Joined with Taylor's surging aggregate, Virginia Tech increased 30Ã¢Â touchdowns on the ground. 

In 2010, Stanford's protection improved under new cautious facilitator Vic Fangio, who was given kudos for a significant part of the group's accomplishment in that division. Toward the finish of the normal season, Stanford was first in the Pac-10 and eleventh of 120 groups broadly in scoring guard (permitting a normal of 17.83Ã¢Â points per diversion) and 24th in all out protection (allowing 326Ã¢Â yards per amusement). In 2009, Stanford was 69th in scoring protection (26.5) and 90th in all out resistance (403Ã¢Â yards per diversion). An unmistakable player on Stanford's barrier was Owen Marecic, the main individual in significant association school football that season to play both offense and resistance. On guard, Marecic collected 45 handles and 2 block attempts as a linebacker; on offense, he increased 117Ã¢Â yards and 4 touchdowns as the group's fullback. 

Stanford's driving tackler was linebacker Shayne Skov, who gathered 72 handles notwithstanding missing the initial two rounds of the period. Prior to the diversion, Skov said one of Stanford's needs is contain the portability of Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor. "We have to attempt to keep him in the pocket and (apply) weight a similar way we have all year," Skov said. 

Virginia Tech's safeguard was driven by organizer Bud Foster, who was named a hopeful in a few groups' scans for another head mentor, yet chose to stay at Virginia Tech as the development to the Orange Bowl proceeded. Heading into the amusement, Tech's resistance positioned 38th broadly in all out yards permitted, its second-most noticeably awful execution since 1993. Tech's run barrier was 58th, allowing a normal 148.9Ã¢Â rushingÃ¢Â yards per diversion. On the positive side of things, Tech's barrier had the third-most captures (22) in the nation, and its scoring resistance was sixteenth (19.1 focuses per diversion). 

Tech's top entertainer on guard was sophomore cornerback Jayron Hosley, who had eight block attempts amid the seasonÃ¢ÂÂtied for most in the countryÃ¢ÂÂand was named a first-group Walter Camp All-American, a second-group Associated Press All-American, and a second-group activities Illustrated All-American for that execution. Other top entertainers included linebackers Bruce Taylor and Stephen Friday, who had 15.5 and 15 handles for misfortune, individually. 

The Hokies played the Orange Bowl without beginning linebacker Lyndell Gibson, who broke his shoulder in the second quarter of the ACC Championship Game. Gibson was fourth in the group in handles with 66. Supplanting Gibson was redshirt first year recruit Tariq Edwards, who played just a couple of times before the Orange Bowl. The Hokies additionally restored a player from damage for the Orange Bowl. Linebacker Barquell Rivers, who had been anticipated to be Tech's beginning center linebacker, endured a torn quadriceps ligament in offseason exercises, making him miss each diversion. Heading into the Orange Bowl, mentors were idealistic that he had mended enough to have the capacity to play. 

The 2011 Orange Bowl commenced at 8:39Ã¢Â pm EST on January 3, 2011 in Sun Life Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida. Bowl authorities said 65,463Ã¢Â tickets were sold for the diversion, yet many went unused, and that official figure was more than 9,000 beneath arena limit. The diversion was broadcast on ESPN, and the commentators were Mike Tirico, Ron Jaworski, Jon Gruden and Michele Tafoya. An expected 8.23Ã¢Â million watchers watched the communicate, procuring it a Nielsen rating of 7.1. That figure was the second-most minimal imprint to date for a BCS diversion. For contributing groups to the Orange Bowl, the Atlantic Coast Conference and Pacific-10 each gotten a lot of cash to be separated among their individuals. Since the Pac-10 had two BCS groups, that meeting got $27.2Ã¢Â million from the BCS. The ACC, which had just Virginia Tech in a BCS bowl, got $21.2Ã¢Â million. In the ACC, Virginia Tech got a to some degree bigger offer of the cash as a reward for winning the meeting: All other ACC groups got $1.1Ã¢Â million; Tech got $1.7Ã¢Â million. Stanford got a comparative sum, however the additional cash was counterbalanced by the expense of sending 500 players, mentors, and staff to Miami. 

Stanford restored the amusement's opening kickoff to its 24-yard line, where the Cardinal offense started the diversion's first belonging. On the amusement's first play, Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck ran 11Ã¢Â yards through the Virginia Tech guard for a first down. The achievement was fleeting, in any case, as Stanford's next three plays did not increase enough ground for another first down, and the group punted from its 37-yard line. Virginia Tech's first belonging was not any more fruitful than Stanford's had been. The Hokies' offense entered the amusement at its 31-yard line after the punt, yet went three-and-out in the wake of neglecting to pick up a first down. 

Tech punted, and Stanford's offense came back to the field. The two groups exchanged belongings once again, with Stanford turning the ball over on downs after a flopped fourth-down change endeavor, and Virginia Tech restoring the ball with another punt. Following the kick, Stanford's offense started work from its 14-yard line with 8:08 staying in the quarter. Two plays increased fiveÃ¢Â yards, at that point Luck finished a 21-yard go to wide recipient Doug Baldwin for simply the second initially down of the diversion.

The score and ensuing additional point gave Stanford a 7Ã¢ÂÂ0 lead with 6:16 staying in the quarter. 

Stanford's post-score kickoff was brought down for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense started from its 20-yard line.

Tech punted from its 43-yard line, and the kick was brought down at the Stanford 5-yard line, where the Cardinal offense began work. Two hurrying plays were halted for no addition, at that point Luck endeavored a passing play on third down. Since the line of scrimmage was so near the Stanford objective line, Luck needed to move into his own end zone to endeavor the pass. Under strain from the Virginia Tech protection, he tossed to Derek Hall, who got the ball at last zone and was handled before getting out. The aftereffect of the play was a wellbeing, a 2-point guarded score for Virginia Tech. 

Trailing 7Ã¢ÂÂ2 with 59 seconds staying in the quarter, Virginia Tech's offense got the ball at its 25-yard line following Stanford's post-wellbeing free kick. On the primary play of the consequent drive, Taylor went through the Stanford guard for 22Ã¢Â yards and a first down at the Tech 47-yard line. The second play of the drive, a 4-yard kept running by running back Darren Evans, pushed Tech into Stanford's side of the field without precedent for the amusement, and was the last play of the quarter. With seventy five percent remaining, Stanford drove Virginia Tech, 7Ã¢ÂÂ2. 

The second quarter started with Virginia Tech possessing the ball and confronting second down on Stanford's 49-yard line. On the main play of the quarter, Taylor finished a 10-yard toss to wide beneficiary Marcus Davis for a first down.
