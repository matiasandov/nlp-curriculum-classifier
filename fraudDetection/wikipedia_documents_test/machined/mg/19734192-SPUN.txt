Forster's execution at Arsenal on 2 February 2016 in his fourth match was very amazing and drew acclamations from many.

Albeit first decision goalkeeper since his landing in Southampton, it was simply after the retirement of Kelvin Davis in the late spring of 2016 that Forster was at last given the conventional goalkeeper's "number 1" shirt at the club. Southampton made a poor begin to the season under new administrator Claude Puel, taking just a single point in their initial three association matches, yet from mid-September onwards Forster went on a keep running of five progressive clean sheets in all rivalries. This keep running of tidy sheets caused Southampton ascend to eighth in the class. Be that as it may, both Forster and his group persevered through a droop in structure from there on. A mis-kick by the goalkeeper against Crystal Palace on 3 December talented Christian Benteke a simple chance to open the scoring in a 3Ã¢ÂÂ0 success over Southampton. Southampton endured a similarly overwhelming thrashing on 29 December against Tottenham Hotspur, losing 4Ã¢ÂÂ1 in match where ESPN portrayed Forster's dispersion as "out and out horrifying" and held him punishable for no less than two of the objectives yielded. Forster's poor structure proceeded into January 2017, where it was noticed his spare/shot proportion was the most noticeably bad among Premier League goalkeepers for the season to date. 

Regardless of impassive structure with respect to both Forster and Southampton all in all, Southampton turned into the primary group in history to achieve the League Cup last without yielding a solitary objective.

Despite the fact that he had a conflicting year, Forster ended the season with an aggregate of 14 clean sheets, in spite of the fact that his side just completed eighth in the association and neglected to meet all requirements for European football in the accompanying season. 

On 19 July 2017, Forster marked another five-year contract, and depicted Southampton as being "an awesome club to be at". His uninterested structure, be that as it may, proceeded into the new season, with oversights against Manchester United, Newcastle and Brighton all subsequent in Southampton dropping focuses amid the early months in the class. Regardless of these mistakes, supervisor Mauricio Pellegrino shielded Forster, demanding he is a "great goalkeeper" and that "the situation of the goalkeeper is constantly uncovered in this kind of circumstance however no one recollects the great circumstances." Forster was in the end dropped from the group in December 2017, supplanted in objective by Alex McCarthy. He has not played for Southampton since. 

By July 2018, Forster was pushed further down the pecking request at Southampton with the landing in the club of Angus Gunn from Manchester City as back-up for Alex McCarthy.

Britain lost 2Ã¢ÂÂ0 however Forster was "innocent" for the two objectives, making a "fine plunging recovery" to deny Chile a third. This appearance against Chile saw Forster become just the second individual ever to play for England while a Celtic player, after Alan Thompson in 2004. 

On 12 May 2014, Hodgson named Forster in England's 23-man squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. In England's last warm-up match before the competition, on 7 June, he substituted Joe Hart throughout the previous 15 minutes of a 0Ã¢ÂÂ0 draw with Honduras. Forster ventured out to Brazil with the remainder of the England squad however did not include in any of the three matches England played. 

Knee damage saw Forster miss a large portion of 2015, however his structure on coming back to playing football in mid 2016 earned him a review to the England squad in March. He played the second 50% of England's 3Ã¢ÂÂ2 neighborly success over Germany in Berlin, making a noteworthy spare from a Marco Reus free kick, albeit later surrendered an objective from a Mario GÄÅmez header. Forster played the full an hour and a half three days after the fact on 29 March 2016 out of a 2Ã¢ÂÂ1 misfortune against the Netherlands. The two objectives yielded were questionable; Danny Rose challenging that the handball that prompted the punishment for the Netherlands first objective was not think, while Phil Jagielka seemed, by all accounts, to be messed in the development to Luciano Narsingh's triumphant objective. Notwithstanding the thrashing, Forster turned in a formed exhibition and made a few magnificent recoveries. On 31 May 2016, Forster was named in England's 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016, but he was indeed understudy to Joe Hart and did not play in any of England's four matches at the competition. 

Following Euro 2016, Forster remained an unused substitute in resulting England coordinates, and was dropped from the squad through and through in August 2017. 

Notwithstanding his vast form, Forster has an abnormal state of dexterity; Ian Brown who instructed him as an adolescent at Wallsend said that "he was and is a stunning shot plug. I've seen him for Southampton spare shots he shouldn't, his body twists." In one-on-circumstances, he seems to make his effectively substantial stature much greater to an onrushing adversary. 

Forster was, be that as it may, scrutinized in the early piece of his time at Celtic for lacking certainty and order, and questionable when he had the ball at his feet. In time he developed, with his certainty and kicking detectably improved. His dimension of fixation was likewise noted; given Celtic's predominance over most of their rivals in Scotland, their goalkeeper regularly has extensive stretches of inertia, however when inevitably called without hesitation Forster was perpetually caution and prepared.
