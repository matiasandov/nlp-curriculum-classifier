1959 Atlantic typhoon season 

The 1959 Atlantic typhoon season had a then record-tying number of tropical tornados Ã¢ÂÂ five Ã¢ÂÂ create before AugustÃ¢Â 1. The season was formally to start on JuneÃ¢Â 15, 1959 and last until NovemberÃ¢Â 15, 1959, the time of every year when most tropical twisters structure in the Atlantic bowl, anyway in reality the season started early when Tropical Storm Arlene framed on MayÃ¢Â 28. Hurricane Arlene struck Louisiana and conveyed minor flooding to the Gulf Coast of the United States. The following tempest, Beulah, shaped in the western Gulf of Mexico and conveyed irrelevant effect to Mexico and Texas. Later in June, an anonymous typhoon, nicknamed the Escuminac calamity, caused minor harm in Florida and crushed beach front Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, subsequent to getting to be extratropical. Tropical storm Cindy conveyed minor effect to The Carolinas. In late July, Hurricane Debra delivered flooding in the province of Texas. Typhoon Edith in August and Hurricane Flora in September caused immaterial effect ashore. 

The most huge tempest of the period was Hurricane Gracie, which crested as a 140Ã¢Â mph (220Ã¢Â km/h) CategoryÃ¢Â 4 sea tempest on the SaffirÃ¢ÂÂSimpson tropical storm wind scale. In the wake of debilitating marginally, Gracie made landfall as a 130Ã¢Â mph (215Ã¢Â km/h) CategoryÃ¢Â 4 sea tempest in South Carolina on AugustÃ¢Â 29. It brought solid breezes, unpleasant oceans, overwhelming precipitation, and tornadoes to the state, just as North Carolina and Virginia. Generally speaking, Gracie caused 22Ã¢Â fatalities and $14Ã¢Â million in harm. Following Hurricane Gracie was Hurricane Hannah, a seemingly perpetual tempest that did not bring about any realized effect ashore. The last two tropical typhoons, Tropical Storm Irene and Hurricane Judith, both caused minor seaside and inland flooding in Florida. The tempests of the 1959 Atlantic typhoon season were aggregately ascribed to $24Ã¢Â million (1959ÃÂ USD) and 64Ã¢Â fatalities. 

The 1959 Atlantic typhoon season formally started on JuneÃ¢Â 15, 1959, and it finished on NovemberÃ¢Â 15, 1959. Eleven tropical dejections created amid the season. Every one of the eleven of the dejections achieved hurricane status, which was somewhat over the 1950Ã¢ÂÂ2000 normal of 9.6Ã¢Â named tempests. Of the eleven frameworks, seven of them achieved typhoon status, which was additionally somewhat over the normal of 5.9. Besides, two tempests achieved serious tropical storm status Ã¢ÂÂ Category 3 or more noteworthy on the SaffirÃ¢ÂÂSimpson Hurricane Scale. Five typhoons and three sea tempests made landfall amid the season and caused 64Ã¢Â fatalities and about $24Ã¢Â million (1959 USD) in harm. 

Season movement started with the advancement of Tropical Storm Arlene on MayÃ¢Â 28. In the long stretch of June, Tropical Storm Beulah and an anonymous sea tempest framed, the last turning into a typhoon on JuneÃ¢Â 19. Another pair of storms, Cindy and Debra, framed in the long stretch of July. All things considered, the fiveÃ¢Â tropical violent winds that shaped in May, June, and July made the 1959 season the a standout amongst the most dynamic seasons before AugustÃ¢Â 1, tied with 1887, 1933, 1936, 1966, 1995 and 1997. The record was later outperformed in 2005 when sevenÃ¢Â tropical violent winds shaped before AugustÃ¢Â 1. In any case, tropical cyclogenesis backed off in August, with just Tropical Storm Edith framing amid the month. Next, three tropical violent winds framed in September Ã¢ÂÂ Flora, Gracie, and Hannah Ã¢ÂÂ all of which accomplished typhoon status. Besides, in October, Tropical Storm Irene and Hurricane Judith, the 1959 season's last tempest, created. The last tempest dispersed on OctoberÃ¢Â 21, very nearly a month prior to the official end of the period on NovemberÃ¢Â 15. 

The season's action was reflected with a collected typhoon vitality (ACE) rating of 77, which is somewhat underneath the 1950Ã¢ÂÂ2000Ã¢Â average of 94.7. Pro is, comprehensively, a proportion of the intensity of the sea tempest duplicated by the time allotment it existed, so storms that keep going quite a while, just as especially solid tropical storms, have high ACEs. It is determined for full warnings on tropical frameworks at or surpassing 34Ã¢Â knots (39Ã¢Â mph, 63Ã¢Â km/h) or hurricane quality. 

A tropical wave formed into the principal tropical misery of the period on MayÃ¢Â 28, while situated in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. The melancholy fortified and, at an opportune time the next day, was moved up to Tropical Storm Arlene. The tempest gradually heightened and achieved its pinnacle power of 65Ã¢Â mph (100Ã¢Â km/h) on MayÃ¢Â 29. Quick debilitating occurred as the tempest moved toward land. By late on MayÃ¢Â 30, Arlene made landfall close Lafayette, Louisiana with winds of 45Ã¢Â mph (75Ã¢Â km/h). At an opportune time the next day the tempest debilitated to a tropical sorrow while scarcely inland. The framework in the long run bended east-northeastward and wound over the Southern United States until disseminating over South Carolina on JuneÃ¢Â 2. 

In Louisiana, a state most extreme precipitation of fell in Houma. Therefore, a couple of towns along the coast revealed brought down trees and electrical lines from high breezes, which caused dissipated power blackouts. In New Orleans, a few streets were closed down because of immersion. Furthermore, in any event 100Ã¢Â homes inside the city were overwhelmed. In Baton Rouge, many individuals were emptied from an overflowed home by means of rescue vehicle and wagon to more secure zones. 

Generally speaking, harm was light, coming to $500,000. One passing was identified with Arlene; a man suffocated in harsh surf off the shore of Galveston, Texas. After tempest scattered over the Southeastern United States, the extratropical remainders of Arlene conveyed moderate precipitation to parts of the Mid-Atlantic States and New England. 

A virus front wound up stationary as it moved over the Gulf of Mexico on JuneÃ¢Â 13. After the "SS Hondo" revealed winds of 60Ã¢Â mph (95Ã¢Â km/h), it is assessed that a tropical despondency created at 1800ÃÂ UTC on JuneÃ¢Â 15, while situated in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. By JuneÃ¢Â 16, the sadness reinforced into Tropical Storm Beulah. Further extending happened and the tempest crested with winds of 70Ã¢Â mph (110Ã¢Â km/h) on JuneÃ¢Â 17. As Beulah neared the Gulf Coast of Mexico, a structure edge of high weight constrained the tempest southward. It at that point started to experience more grounded upper dimension winds and debilitated to a tropical misery on JuneÃ¢Â 18. Presently, the tempest scattered about upper east of Tuxpan, Veracruz. Tides of better than average happened along the Texas coast, however no effect was accounted for in Mexico. 

A tropical wave formed into a tropical sorrow while arranged in the focal Gulf of Mexico on JuneÃ¢Â 18. It headed quickly northeastward and made landfall close to the Tampa Bay Area of Florida soon thereafter. The tempest dropped reasonably overwhelming precipitation in Florida, which made harm crops. A tornado close Miami and elevated tides on the west shoreline of the state additionally brought about harm. Misfortunes in Florida were around $1.7Ã¢Â million. Presently, in entered the Atlantic Ocean and fortified into a typhoon later on JuneÃ¢Â 18. By the next day, it had fortified into a typhoon; the tempest all the while topped with greatest continued breezes of 85Ã¢Â mph (135Ã¢Â km/h). 

The tempest progressed into an extratropical tornado on JuneÃ¢Â 19. The leftovers struck Atlantic Canada, once in Nova Scotia and again in Newfoundland before scattering on JuneÃ¢Â 21. In the wake of getting to be extratropical, the tempest caused critical impacts in Atlantic Canada. About 45Ã¢Â boats were in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and they didn't have radio to get cautioning of the moving toward tempest. Harsh oceans of up to 49Ã¢Â ft (15Ã¢Â m) in stature harmed or demolished numerous pontoons. At any rate 22Ã¢Â fishing vessels overturned over water with their team, causing 35Ã¢Â deaths. High breezes likewise upset interchanges in certain regions, and a few houses were harmed, with misfortunes coming to about $781,000. The New Brunswick Fishermen's Disaster Fund was made to help exploited people. The gathered pledges $400,000 in a couple of months from gifts from all through Canada, just as Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II, the last who was on a voyage through the nation at the time. 

A low-weight zone related with a virus front formed into a tropical sadness on JulyÃ¢Â 5, while found east of Florida. Following north-northeastward, it reinforced into Tropical Storm Cindy by the following day. Cindy turned westbound in view of a high-weight territory situated to its north, and further escalated into a storm seaward the Carolinas on JulyÃ¢Â 8. Cindy made landfall close McClellanville, South Carolina right off the bat JulyÃ¢Â 9, and re-bended toward the upper east along the Fall Line as a tropical sadness. It re-developed into the Atlantic on JulyÃ¢Â 10 and immediately restrengthened into a hurricane. On JulyÃ¢Â 11, Cindy ignored Cape Cod, while a few other climate frameworks helped the tempest keep up its power. Cindy changed into an extratropical twister on JulyÃ¢Â 12 while moving toward Atlantic Canada. 

Generally speaking auxiliary harm from Cindy was insignificant. One driver was slaughtered in Georgetown, South Carolina in the wake of slamming into a fallen tree, and five passings were brought about by poor street conditions created by the tempest in New England. Numerous regions experienced substantial downpours, and a few thousand individuals emptied. Harm was chiefly bound to broken tree appendages, broke windows and power blackouts. Cindy carried a sum of eleven tornadoes with it, of which two caused minor harm in North Carolina. The heaviest precipitation happened in northern South Carolina, where precipitation added up to . Tides extended from better than average along the coast. As dry spell like conditions were available in The Carolinas at the time, the downpour that fell in the territory was valuable. Subsequent to getting to be extratropical over Atlantic Canada, the tornado delivered substantial downpours and solid breezes that sunk one ship. Harm brought about by Cindy was evaluated at $75,000. 

On JulyÃ¢Â 23, cooperation of a chilly center low and a tropical wave produced a tropical sadness found south of Louisiana. The melancholy wandered westbound while consistently strengthening, turning into a Tropical Storm on JulyÃ¢Â 24. A turn towards the northwest ended up apparent as it accomplished CategoryÃ¢Â 1 sea tempest status on the SaffirÃ¢ÂÂSimpson Hurricane Scale on the next day. Quality was kept up as the sea tempest bended northward at a moderate forward speed, and it moved toward the bank of Texas as an insignificant sea tempest. Debra made landfall among Freeport and Galveston, Texas at an opportune time JulyÃ¢Â 25. Debra quickly debilitated into a hurricane and later a wretchedness as it moved inland, and it disseminated on JulyÃ¢Â 28. The remainder dampness later started upper-level rainstorms in late July and early August. 

Heavy rains were created in southeastern Texas, topping at in Orange. This prompted far reaching flooding on roadways, including parts of Farm Road 518, Highway 6, Highway 146, and U.S. Highway 75. Ocean vessels took the brunt of the tempest, with many getting to be stranded or harmed. Air, rail, and street transportation were altogether hindered or even closed down. High breezes from the tempest made extensive harm structures, windows, signs, and rooftops. The tropical storm brought about 11Ã¢Â injuries however no human passings, albeit roughly 90Ã¢Â cattle suffocated. Harm in Brazoria, Galveston, and Harris regions surmounted $6.685Ã¢Â million. Also, sway in different zones expanded the absolute misfortunes to $7Ã¢Â million. 

A debilitating virus front produced a tropical misery on AugustÃ¢Â 2 close to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The structure was expansive, perhaps much the same as a subtropical violent wind. The tempest immediately increased dependent on ship reports, potentially to tropical storm force, despite the fact that the most extreme continued breezes were evaluated at 70Ã¢Â mph (110Ã¢Â km/h). A moving toward frontal limit made the tempest quicken northeastward, while additionally carrying drier air into the windfield, causing debilitating. On AugustÃ¢Â 4, the tempest changed into an extratropical violent wind, and for two days floated toward Atlantic Canada before disseminating. The tempest was added to the Atlantic typhoon database in 2016. 

A tropical wave was followed east of the Lesser Antilles in mid-August. At 1530ÃÂ UTC on AugustÃ¢Â 17, a surveillance air ship revealed a feeble focus and winds of 35Ã¢Â mph (55Ã¢Â km/h). Under three hours after the fact, a tropical sorrow created while found east of the Windward Islands. The dejection reinforced into Tropical Storm Edith at an early stage AugustÃ¢Â 18. The tempest moved west-northwestward at a generally fast pace, hitting Dominica with winds crest winds of 60Ã¢Â mph (95Ã¢Â km/h) on AugustÃ¢Â 18. By 1800ÃÂ UTC on AugustÃ¢Â 18, Edith crested with winds of 60Ã¢Â mph (95Ã¢Â km/h). It bended westbound and quickened on AugustÃ¢Â 19. Edith debilitated to a tropical wretchedness at 1200ÃÂ UTC, hours before dispersing close to the southern tip of Dominican Republic. There was "significant uncertainty" if a dissemination at any point existed. Squally climate and breezy breezes were accounted for in certain territories, including Guadeloupe, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola. 

A scattering cold front brought forth a low weight over the focal Atlantic Ocean on AugustÃ¢Â 26. Moving gradually northward, the framework sorted out into a typhoon on AugustÃ¢Â 28, and multi day later, a moving toward virus front turned the tempest toward the east-upper east. In light of ship perceptions, it is evaluated that the tempest achieved crest winds of 65Ã¢Â mph (100Ã¢Â km/h) on AugustÃ¢Â 31. By SeptemberÃ¢Â 3, the tempest changed into an extratropical violent wind as it cooperated with the virus front, found somewhere between Newfoundland and the Azores. Multi day later, the tempest was consumed by a bigger extratropical storm southwest of Iceland. The tempest was added to the Atlantic typhoon database in 2016. 

On SeptemberÃ¢Â 6, a wide low weight region created between the Bahamas and Bermuda. The framework moved northward, sorting out into a hurricane on SeptemberÃ¢Â 9. The framework had an expansive breeze field, and was likely a subtropical twister. Moving northwestward at first, the tempest swung toward the upper east in front of a virus front, with continued breezes of around 45Ã¢Â mph (75Ã¢Â km/h). Nantucket island in Massachusetts revealed continued breezes of amid the tempest's entry. On SeptemberÃ¢Â 11, the tempest connected with the virus front, turning into an extratropical storm, which went on until SeptemberÃ¢Â 14. The tempest was added to the Atlantic sea tempest database in 2016. 

A tropical wave went through the islands of Cape Verde on SeptemberÃ¢Â 6 and followed westbound at about . At an opportune time SeptemberÃ¢Â 9, a tropical dejection created while situated about halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The discouragement moved northeastward and by SeptemberÃ¢Â 10 it reinforced into Tropical Storm Flora. An observation air ship trip into the tempest on SeptemberÃ¢Â 11 recorded breezes of 75Ã¢Â mph (120Ã¢Â km/h); along these lines, Flora turned into a typhoon. Around the time, the tempest accomplished its pinnacle power with most extreme continued breezes of a similar speed and a base barometric weight of . Vegetation at that point quickened northeastward toward the Azores. Amid another surveillance trip on SeptemberÃ¢Â 12, no proof of a tropical twister was accounted for. In this manner, Flora progressed toward becoming extratropical at 1200ÃÂ UTC that day. 

A tropical wave generated a tropical misery north of Hispaniola on SeptemberÃ¢Â 20. The sorrow stayed seaward the island and moved west-northwestward. By SeptemberÃ¢Â 22, it bended northeastward and wound up Tropical Storm Gracie. The tempest at that point traveled through The Bahamas, delivering on Mayaguana. Later on SeptemberÃ¢Â 22 Gracie increased into a sea tempest. It extended further to a CategoryÃ¢Â 2, on SeptemberÃ¢Â 23, before debilitating soon thereafter. Gracie at that point wound gradually and whimsically while upper east of The Bahamas, before bending northwestward on SeptemberÃ¢Â 27. It turned into a CategoryÃ¢Â 2 typhoon again by SeptemberÃ¢Â 28. Amid the following 24Ã¢Â hours, Gracie extended altogether and crested as a 140Ã¢Â mph (220Ã¢Â km/h) CategoryÃ¢Â 4 tropical storm. In any case, it debilitated marginally to a 130Ã¢Â mph (215Ã¢Â km/h) CategoryÃ¢Â 4 storm before making landfall on Edisto Island, South Carolina at 1625ÃÂ UTC on SeptemberÃ¢Â 29. Gracie was the one of the most grounded tropical typhoons to strike South Carolina until Hurricane Hugo in 1989. It quickly debilitated inland, getting to be extratropical on SeptemberÃ¢Â 30. 

Along the bank of South Carolina, the most astounding tide recorded was above mean low water at Charleston Harbor. On Folly Beach, all waterfront houses supported some harm, while streets on the east side of the island were washed away. Gracie conveyed wind blasts as high with regards to the Beaufort region. Inland, 100Ã¢Â mph (155Ã¢Â km/h) winds lashed Walterboro. As much as 75% of Charleston County was left without power. More distant north, a tornado harmed homes in Garden City. All through the South Carolina Lowcountry, 48Ã¢Â homes were decimated, 349Ã¢Â homes endured real harm, and 4,115Ã¢Â homes endured minor harm. The leftovers dropped precipitation and brought forth tornadoes in a few different states as it traveled northeastward over the Mid-Atlantic and New England locales. In Virginia, three tornadoes in Albemarle, Greene, and Fluvanna Counties on the whole caused 11Ã¢Â fatalities. Precipitation from the tempest topped at in Big Meadows. Generally speaking, Gracie caused 22Ã¢Â deaths and $14Ã¢Â million in harm. 

After boats announced a low-level course, it was evaluated that a tropical misery created at 26.8ÃÂ°N, 49.9ÃÂ°W on SeptemberÃ¢Â 27. From the get-go the next day, the despondency fortified into Tropical Storm Hannah. Observation flying machine flew into the tempest late on SeptemberÃ¢Â 28 and demonstrated that Hannah increased into a CategoryÃ¢Â 1 typhoon. Hannah moved commonly westbound at about . By SeptemberÃ¢Â 30, the tempest turned into a CategoryÃ¢Â 2 tropical storm, and it bended northwestward soon thereafter. Hannah developed to a CategoryÃ¢Â 3 sea tempest on OctoberÃ¢Â 1, hours before the tempest achieved its pinnacle force with greatest continued breezes of 120Ã¢Â mph (195Ã¢Â km/h) and a base barometric weight of . The tempest kept up this power for about 48Ã¢Â hours and bended northeastward on OctoberÃ¢Â 2. 

Hannah started to a debilitate late on OctoberÃ¢Â 3. By the next day, the tempest tumbled to CategoryÃ¢Â 2 tropical storm force. It quickened eastbound or east-southeastward over the focal Atlantic, beginning on OctoberÃ¢Â 4. Hannah re-fortified somewhat to a 110Ã¢Â mph (175Ã¢Â km/h) CategoryÃ¢Â 2 tropical storm on OctoberÃ¢Â 5, however then gradually started debilitating once more. The last warning on the tempest was issued at an opportune time OctoberÃ¢Â 7, while it was focused about south-southwest of the Azores, anyway Hannah remained a tropical typhoon and crossed through the Azores soon thereafter. No effect was accounted for in the islands. It debilitated to a CategoryÃ¢Â 1 sea tempest from the get-go OctoberÃ¢Â 8, and progressed into an extratropical violent wind over the far northeastern Atlantic a few hours after the fact. 

Toward the beginning of October, a virus front floated through Texas and entered the Gulf of Mexico. On October 5 the front scattered while a related trough continued. Upper-level air temperatures were commonly warm, and a negligible anticyclone was arranged over the Gulf. Right now, a Colorado low drew polar air into the Mississippi Valley, proposing extratropical qualities of the creating framework. A tropical despondency shaped on October 6; it wandered in a north-northeasterly heading for the following two days. The tempest increased into Tropical Storm Irene around 1800ÃÂ UTC on October 7. Around this time, a Hurricane Hunters flight showed that the course was ill defined, in spite of the fact that it was slowly developing. On OctoberÃ¢Â 8, Irene made landfall close Pensacola, Florida as an efficient typhoon. The tempest quickly debilitated to a tropical sadness, before disseminating from the get-go October 9. 

The most astounding tides, better than average, were accounted for at Cedar Key, Florida, while the most grounded blast recorded, , was estimated at Pensacola International Airport. Substantial precipitation from Irene spread crosswise over a great part of the Southern United States, topping at in Neels Gap, Georgia. In Florida, flooding from precipitation related with Irene caused harm around the Lake Okeechobee zone. Misfortunes in Florida was constrained to uncollected harvests, essentially peanuts and corn, that were in bunches during the time spent being dried. A few floods were overwhelmed along the coast at Shalimar close Fort Walton Beach. The breezes brought down trees and an utility pole, causing a short power blackout in Ocean City. Red tides were continuous in western Florida; twists from the tempest's forerunner blew a huge number of dead fish shorewards. Nearby inhabitants grumbled that the scent from the decaying fish were horrendous. 

A tropical wave formed into Tropical Storm Judith on OctoberÃ¢Â 17, close to the YucatÄÄn Channel. It fortified rapidly, and by right off the bat OctoberÃ¢Â 18 the tempest was moved up to a CategoryÃ¢Â 1 typhoon. Anyway six hours after the fact Judith had debilitated back to a hurricane. Around 1800ÃÂ UTC on OctoberÃ¢Â 18 the tempest made landfall close Boca Grande, Florida, with winds of 50Ã¢Â mph (85Ã¢Â km/h). In the wake of developing into the Atlantic Ocean on the next day, Judith started re-fortifying while at the same time traveling east-northeastward, achieving typhoon status a few hours after the fact. It topped with winds of 80Ã¢Â mph (130Ã¢Â km/h) at an opportune time OctoberÃ¢Â 20, before debilitating back to a hurricane again on OctoberÃ¢Â 21. Judith debilitated further, before changing into an extratropical typhoon soon thereafter. 

Effect from Judith was commonly minor and restricted for the most part to Southwest Florida. Wrap blasts up to toppled a few trees on Sanibel Island and a couple of intensity posts; a man was harmed when his vehicle struck a fallen shaft. Unpleasant oceans caused disintegration on Captiva Island and in Fort Myers, while likewise immersing a few streets in the territory. A blend of locally overwhelming precipitation and tides caused minor flooding in low-lying territories. Precipitation from the tempest topped at in Miles City. The Imperial River flooded close Bonita Springs, flooding field grounds and washing out yields, the greater part of which were as of late planted. A bit of U.S. Highway 41 was immersed by up to of water in Bonita Springs. 

The accompanying names were utilized for named storms (typhoons and sea tempests) that framed in the North Atlantic in 1959. All names in this rundown were first time in 1959. Gracie was later expelled from the rundown for obscure reasons.
