KirkenesÃ¢ÂÂBjÄÂ¸rnevatn Line 

The KirkenesÃ¢ÂÂBjÄÂ¸rnevatn Line (), or the Sydvaranger Line (), is a long railroad line among Kirkenes and BjÄÂ¸rnevatn in SÄÂ¸r-Varanger, Norway. Claimed by the private mining organization Northern Iron, the single-track railroad is exclusively used to pull 20 day by day iron mineral trains from BjÄÂ¸rnevatn Mine to the port at Kirkenes. It was the world's northern-most railroad until 2010, when the ObskayaÃ¢ÂÂBovanenkovo Line in Russia went further north. 

The line was worked by the mining organization Sydvaranger, who began development in 1907 and introduced the railroad in 1910. From 1912, the port system got jolt, as did the mainline in 1920. Initially, free traveler trains administrations were likewise advertised. Amid the Second World War, the line was to a great extent annihilated, however modified a short time later and re-opened in 1952. Electric footing was deserted in 1955 when two EMD G12 diesel trains were purchased. The line shut in 1997, however was revived in 2009, after an adjustment in responsibility for mine. There are recommendations to associate the line to it is possible that either of the Finnish and Russian railroad systems. 

The KirkenesÃ¢ÂÂBjÄÂ¸rnevatn Line is long and keeps running from BjÄÂ¸rnevatn Mine to Kirkenes Port. While the line had traveler transport, it had two stations, Kirkenes Station and BjÄÂ¸rnevatn Station, which were situated from one another. A third station, Armeverplegungslager, was just utilized amid the Second World War and promptly subsequently and was situated from Kirkenes Station. The railroad is standard check, non-zapped and single track. 

Beginning at BjÄÂ¸rnevatn, the railroad line begins underground at a storehouse, above mean ocean level (AMSL). From BjÄÂ¸rnevatn, the line begins to fall with a 0.3-percent inclination. Subsequent to passing the local location, the inclination drops to 1.5 percent. On this area, the line goes through its solitary passage, which is long. The line at that point keeps running along a compliment territory, and crosses through a long cutting towards the absolute bottom of the line, at AMSL. 

The railroad at that point keeps running under European Road E6 and begins moving at a 1.0-percent inclination until coming to AMSL. Starting here to Kirkenes it keeps running by the E6, and goes by the lakes Tredjevatn, StuorrajÄÄvn and FÄÂ¸rstevatn. While the initial segment of this segment is level, towards Kirkenes the scene is all the more rolling. The line passes Kirkenes Station, which is AMSL. The swing towards the station is as a bend span of , while the rest of the piece of the line has a base sweep of . The line ends at the storehouse in Kirknes in the wake of running over a raised segment, nicknamed the Air Bridge. 

Iron mineral was found at BjÄÂ¸rnevatn in 1866. The metal was of low quality, yet lay near the surfaceÃ¢ÂÂallowing for open-pit mining, had huge stores and was found near a port. The mining organization Sydvaranger was built up by German and Swedish speculators in 1906. A partition plant was worked in Kirkenes and the organization chose to transport all metal from the mine to the port by rail. Inge T. Wiull, previous director of the Valdres Line, was procured as divisional pioneer for the development of the railroad, the port and the neighborhoods. 

Development of the railroad was given high need to as right on time as conceivable guide in transport of laborers to the mining locales. The two stations were finished in 1908, a similar year as the laying of tracks began. The line initially had a rail profile of 30 kilograms for every meter (60Ã¢Â lb/yd). The primary steam train, worked at Hamar JernstÄÂ¸peri, was conveyed amid the fall of 1908. For the tacks in the mine, a shunter required and the organization purchased a fireless train. At the season of the opening, the line was long, notwithstanding tracks at both Kirkenes and BjÄÂ¸rnevatn. The two stations got a turntable, while Kirkenes additionally gotten water tower, rationale control warehouse and a workshop. BjÄÂ¸rnevatn Station got a warehouse for the fireless train. Tracks were exposed through the pit mine, with the length fluctuating. For example, in 1910 there were of tracks in the mine. 

Mining began on 7 July 1910, with the main metal train being kept running on 13 July. The primary shipload left Kirkenes on 11 October, however SS "Bengal" sank with the main shipment. In 1911, the framework sent out 330,000 tons of metal. The railroad was likewise utilized for transporting specialists, with trains running from the towns to the plants toward the beginning of the day and returning after the working day was finished. Before private vehicles getting to be normal, the railroad worked a traveler carriage on the trains among Kirkenes and BjÄÂ¸rnevatnÃ¢ÂÂallowing free travel. The railroad has never had any planned or open transport of travelers, however the organization's concession determines that the experts could sometime in the future require the organization to work open traveler benefits under indicated conditions. 

In 1910, development began of an electric power supply for tracks at the port. Initially it had 500 volts direct current, however this was later diminished to 400 volts. Since an overhead wire could meddle with the cranes, third-rail conduction was picked. Notwithstanding, in light of the likelihood of iron sludges spilling onto the tracks, the railroad utilized two third rail conductors, one on each side of the track, and stay away from the arrival current going through the tracks. The electric parts were conveyed by Siemens-Schukert and were taken into utilization in 1912. The organization took conveyance of two electric trains, both with a Bo wheel course of action, in 1910 and 1911. Sydvaranger worked one port train like clockwork, comprising of one train and four container vehicles, with a joined of mineral. 

The first framework was intended for a fare limit of , and in 1913, the organization sent out and had 1,150 representatives. The organization started plans to begin zap of the mainline, however the plans were put on hold amid the First World War. Deals plunged amid the war. At first, the mining organization put away the overproduction, however later creation was decreased fundamentally. In 1918, the tracks at the mine were energized at 750 volts direct current. Two Bo'Bo' trains were conveyed by Siemens-Schukert and Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk in 1917. The next year, another Bo-train was worked for the port. Power was verified with the development of Jarfjord Power Station. Be that as it may, absence of materials after the war deferred the jolt of the mainline railroad until 1920. Likewise the port got overhead wires, as the third rail caused issues for snow evacuation. The new electric framework was taken into utilization on 23 December 1920. 

During the 1920s, the economy fell into a low conjuncture, compelling Sydvaranger to declare financial insolvency in 1925. Be that as it may, the offices were immediately revived. Two new Bo-trains, which could work both on the mainline and at the port, were conveyed in 1930. Worked by Siemens-Schukert, they were initiated "Lisa" and "Sonja". Two mainline Bo'Bo' trains were conveyed by Siemens-Schukert in 1935, which were named "Oscar" and "Ivar". They were trailed by the Bo "Laila" and "Gerd" two years laterÃ¢ÂÂwhich could work both on the mainline and at the port. Amid the late 1930s, the railroad organization began supplanting the rails with heavier 35 kilograms for every meter (70Ã¢Â lb/yd) rails, in spite of the fact that this work was not finished. The last electric train was a Siemens-Schukert-fabricated Bo unit conveyed for the port in 1940. In 1938, the most recent year before generation was diminished as a result of the Second World War, the mine sent out . 

After the control of Norway by Nazi Germany, mining proceeded under German organization until January 1942. Kirkenes and the regions along the railroad and at the mine were being utilized to store material for "Wehrmacht". To enable better ability to send out the materials, in 1942, a branch line was worked to Haganes. Known as the Port Line (Norwegian: , ), the line was finished in 1943 and annihilated after the war. "Wehrmacht" additionally settled the "Armeeverpflegungslager" (armed force apportions stockpiling) Station, which was utilized amid and somewhat after the war. From the spring of 1944, German experts requested that mining was to continue, and apportioned two steam trains and thirty hooper vehicles to the line. There was likewise assembled another station for the German moving stock. 

As a major aspect of Operation Nordlicht, Kirkenes was singed, making broad harm the mining organization's foundation. Amid the reproduction, Sydvaranger expected to transport expansive hardware to BjÄÂ¸rnevatn, so the stacking measure was expanded to . All substantial transport amid the reproduction was finished utilizing railroad, and tracks were laid all through the mining office. From 1945, traveler trains kept running between the two settlements, at first with steam trains, and from 1950 with electric trains. New capacity storehouses were worked in BjÄÂ¸rnevatn, however from activities began, transport inside the mine was performed utilizing trackless hardware. Another port office was worked in Kirkenes, with the line ending at the Air Bridge, a raised railroad which prompted the plant. Mining tasks and income administration on the railroad did not begin until 1952. 

The Directorate for Enemy Property assumed control over the German bit of the responsibility for after the war. In 1948, responsibility for organization was exchanged to the state. The underlying post-war plans were to utilize the current moving stock. The main staying train which could pull a metal train from the mine to the port was "Oskar", which could pull up to 14 hooper vehicles and a train weight of . Be that as it may, the train demonstrated inconsistent, so Sydvaranger chose to arrange new trains. The electric footing was removed from use in 1955, however the overhead wires stayed until 1963. Two G12 diesel-electric trains were conveyed from General Motors Electro-Motive Division in 1954 and 1956. The Bo'Bo' units had a power yield of . Likewise, new hooper vehicles were worked by Skabo. 

To take into consideration bigger trains, the changeless way was overhauled. The rail profiles were moved up to 49 kilograms for every meter (78Ã¢Â lb/yd), were consistently welded and the rock counterweight was supplanted with pounded stone. The separation of the line was after the overhauls . The redesigns permitted the greatest pivot burden to be expanded to and the train weight to expanded to . An ostensible train comprised of 20 hooper vehicles with compressed air brakes. In 1960, work began on wrecking the tracks at the port, trailed by all tracks at the workshop at Kirkenes the next year. From that point, all non-mineral transport in the organization was assumed control over utilizing street transport. The three staying electric shunters and the steam train were cleaved up. Two diesel shunters were sold to Norsk Jernverk in Mo I Rana. Up until this point, the railroad had worked 33 steam trains, 14 electric trains and 4 diesel trains. 

In 1980, the mine's generation crested with a fare of 2.4Ã¢Â million tons and 1,000 representatives. In 1984, to improve the work environment condition, an utilized AllmÄÂ¤nna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA)- fabricated T45 train was purchased from Sweden. Be that as it may, it endured a few breakdowns and was resigned in 1989. As a substitution, another G 1203 BB was purchased from Maschinenbau Kiel and was conveyed to Kirkenes on 8 February 1991. In 1988, the initial segment of the Kirkenes plant was shut, and the mining organization radically decreased generation since its proprietor, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, would never again finance tasks. All mining stopped in the spring of 1996, and the last heap of metal was pulled in April 1997. After tasks shut, the most seasoned G12 was exchanged to SÄÂ¸r-Varanger Museum. 

Ice Bulk Minerals purchased the mining rights, and worked a train once to two times every year to keep the track and moving stock kept up. This organization sought financial protection in 2002. The mining organization was then purchased by the neighborhood control organization Varanger Kraft and SÄÂ¸r-Varanger Municipality. In 2006, they sold the mining organization to Tschudi Group for 102Ã¢Â million Norwegian krone (NOK). The Tschudi Group set up Northern Iron, enlisted in Perth, Australia, as a holding organization to claim the mining organization. Tasks in the mine and hanging in the balance continued in 2009, after the cost of iron had risen significantly since the end of the mine. With the opening of the mine, generation is evaluated at 3Ã¢Â million huge amounts of fare every year. The KirkenesÃ¢ÂÂBjÄÂ¸rnevatn Line was the northern-most railroad on the planet until 2010, when Russia's ObskayaÃ¢ÂÂBovanenkovo Line was opened. 

To pull the trains, the mining organization took conveyance of a Vossloh G1000 BB. Fabricated new in 2009, it was conveyed to Kirkenes on 12 February 2010. The unit goes amiss from standard creation by having its most extreme speed diminished by programming from ; it is further outfitted with snowplow, air supply to open the container vehicle entryways, radio remote control and janney couplers. As a back-up, the organization will hold the MaK G 1203. The old hooper vehicles were revamped and put into administration, while the track got new solid ties. The train keeps running up to 20 trips for every day. 

On 18 November 2015 the mining organization went into chapter 11. 

In the Railway Plan of 1923, Parliament chose to expand the Nordland Line from Fauske to VadsÄÂ¸ with a branch to Kirkenes. Amid the Second World War, the "Wehrmacht" revived the designs to assemble a railroad to Kirkenes. Close to the incomplete Polar Line was fabricated and there was never any railroads assembled north of Narvik and the Ofoten Line. Nonetheless, nitty gritty plans were made for the line, including looking over geographical conditions and decision of the course. 

Since 1992, there have been proposition to stretch out the KirkenesÃ¢ÂÂBjÄÂ¸rnevatn Line to either Nikel or Zapolyarny, Russia, where it would interface with the MurmanskÃ¢ÂÂNikel Line. About of railroad is missing to associate the two lines. The proposition calls to create Kirkenes as a port for fare of Russian items, as the Murmansk is less fit and under-dimensioned. Significant transshipment items incorporate metals from MMC Norilsk Nickel, steel from Arkhangelsk and unrefined petroleum. The MurmanskÃ¢ÂÂNikel Line was worked in 1936, is long, isn't zapped and is worked by the Russian Railways. As it is Russian check, the KirkenesÃ¢ÂÂBjÄÂ¸rnevatn Line would be probably experience measure change or get double measure. Another railroad would most likely transport 5Ã¢Â million huge amounts of load every year. 

In 2003, the expense of the vital of new railroad was evaluated at 1.4Ã¢Â billion Norwegian krone (NOK), while the expense of overhauling the current Russian line was NOKÃÂ 400ÃÂ million. In 2007, Murmansk Oblast's senator, Yury Yevdokimov, rejected the designs for an association with Russia, expressing that his conclusion was bolstered by President Vladimir Putin. Since Kirkenes is a more qualified port than Murmansk, nearby experts in Murmansk would prefer not to lose transshipment business to Norway. Be that as it may, with the expanded authenticity of a line to Rovaniemi, which would fill in as an elective course to Kirkenes from Russia, Russian specialists have since 2010 again upheld a railroad line among Kirkenes and Russia. 

A prestudy additionally exists about the likelihood to associate Kirkenes to the Finnish railroad network,named the Arctic Ocean Line. Conceivable courses incorporate from either Rovaniemi, Kolari, KemijÄÂ¤rvi or numerous of these, by means of SodankylÄÂ¤, SaariselkÄÂ¤ and Ivalo, at that point either east or west of Lake Inari or by means of Nikel to Kirkenes. The length of the line would be between . The foundation is the blast of mining in Finnish Lapland and the requirement for access to a profound, sans ice port. Railroad lines exists to the Baltic Sea, yet the cove is both shallow and ice-secured amid winter. The line would likewise take into account fare of wood and different items from Finland, while it would give a course to send out fish from Norway to Finland and Eastern Europe. In 2011, the expenses of the line were evaluated at Ã¢ÂÅº1.1 to 1.6Ã¢Â billion. A fundamentally going amiss option is to assemble westwards from Kolari to Skibotn (300Ã¢Â km).
