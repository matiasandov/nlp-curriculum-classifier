From OsloÃÂ S, there are four principle passageways. All trains going through the West Corridor proceed with either the North, South or East Corridor. Since there are more administrations in the last three, a portion of these end at OsloÃÂ S. The line numbers for the suburbanite and the territorial lines are with the end goal that those coming the Eastern and Western passage (past Stabekk) have 1 and 10-14, those coming the Southern hall have 2 and 20-22, and for the Northern hallway 3 and 30.

These were intended to work on longer segments and were outfitted with just a single entryway for each vehicle. This ended up extending ceasing time excessively, and the C and D renditions were conveyed with two entryways per vehicle. From 1975 to 1977, NSB took conveyance of fourteen 69Cs and from 1983 to 1993 thirty-nine 69Ds. The last is recognizable due to its diverse front. NSB works both two-and three-vehicle sets, and up to three units can be kept running in numerous, permitting NSB to work any train length from two to nine autos. Eighty-two units stay in administration, albeit a portion of those are utilized on the Bergen Commuter Rail and the Arendal Line. 

NSB Class 72 is a progression of 36 four-vehicle electric numerous units worked by AnsaldoBreda. The units are for all time coupled together utilizing Jacobs intruders. Every unit has a power yield of , permitting a top speed of . The trains are long and weigh , and have seating for 310 travelers and one latrine. The trains have preferable availability over Class 69 and not at all like their antecedents are furnished with an electronic open data framework. A portion of the 36 units are utilized on the JÄÅren Commuter Rail.

West of Oslo, the initial segment of the present worker rail was the Randsfjord Line (portions of which have since moved toward becoming piece of the SÄÂ¸rland Line), which opened on 15 November 1866 among Drammen and Vikersund. The SÄÂ¸rland Line from Hokksund to Kongsberg opened on 10 November 1871 and associated with the Randsfjord Line. On 7 October 1872, the Drammen Line opened from Oslo West Station (OsloÃÂ V) to Drammen. This line, alongside the segment from Drammen to Kongsberg, were worked with thin measure and did not associate with the fundamental station of OsloÃ¢Â ÄÂ. The GjÄÂ¸vik Line opened from Grefsen to Jaren on 20 December 1900, and from OsloÃ¢Â ÄÂ to Grefsen and from Jaren to GjÄÂ¸vik on 28 November 1902. 

In 1903 and 1904, the Trunk Line was moved up to twofold track. The segment from Drammen to Kongsberg was changed over to standard check on 1 November 1909. Somewhere in the range of 1917 and 1920, double measure was laid among OsloÃÂ V and Drammen, and from 13 November 1922, the Drammen Line was totally worked with standard check. The primary zap of NSB's lines was put into administration on 26 October 1922 on the Drammen Line among OsloÃÂ V and BrakerÄÂ¸ya. The area from OsloÃÂ V to Sandvika was moved up to twofold track on 26 November 1922. From 1922, NSB presented El 1-pulled traveler prepares on the Drammen Line, and later different lines. 

The following zap happened on the Trunk Line from OsloÃ¢Â ÄÂ to LillestrÄÂ¸m on 1 September 1927, the Randsfjord Line from Drammen to Kongsberg on 10 April 1929 and the Drammen Line from Drammen to BrakerÄÂ¸ya on 6 May 1930. El 5 trains were gained for the Trunk Line. Electric different units were put into administration in 1931, with the conveyance of four Class 62 units on the course from OsloÃÂ V to Sandvika. These turned out to be adequately amazing for the huge traffic and were later moved to less utilized administrations from OsloÃÂ V to Asker or Heggedal. The class stayed on the suburbanite rail administration until 1953. 

From 1936, NSB took conveyance of Class 65 different units, supplanting El 1 as the essential hauler on the energized worker rail organize. Class 65 were the principal that were streamlined for nearby traffic, with wide entryways and turnable seats. NSB took conveyance of 49 units until 1952, in spite of the fact that they were likewise utilized outside the suburbanite rail arrange. The ÄÂstfold Line was moved up to twofold track and put into administration in four segments: from Bekkelaget to Ljan on 1 June 1924, from OsloÃ¢Â ÄÂ to Bekkelaget on 15 May 1929, from Ljan to Kolbotn on 15 December 1936 and from Kolbotn to Ski on 14 May 1939. The ÄÂstfold Line was likewise the following line to be charged, which opened in segments somewhere in the range of 1936 and 1940. NSB took into utilization El 8 trains on hold. 

On 15 June 1953, the Trunk Line from LillestrÄÂ¸m to Eidsvoll brought charge into utilization. Further redesigns on the Drammen Line introducing twofold track were put into administration on 24 July 1953 from Billingstad to Hvalstad, on 29 November 1955 from Hvalstad to Asker and on 9 November 1958 from Sandvika to Billingstad. Somewhere in the range of 1953 and 1955, NSB took conveyance of 18 Class 67 various units. While outwardly like Class 65, they had improved innovation and unwavering quality. On 1 February 1961, the GjÄÂ¸vik Line from OsloÃ¢Â ÄÂ to TÄÂ¸yen was put into administration with twofold track and the line from OsloÃ¢Â ÄÂ to Jaren put into administration as jolted. Twofold track from TÄÂ¸yen to Grefsen opened on 27 May 1962 and the areas from Jaren to GjÄÂ¸vik was energized in 1963. 

During the 1960s, NSB found the requirement for another age of trains. Class 69 was worked in aluminum and were longer, taking into consideration more travelers per vehicle. They had a greatest speed of ; this had a huge cost sway, as it permitted quicker travel time, however permitted the administrations from OsloÃ¢Â ÄÂ to LillestrÄÂ¸m and Ski to run quick enough to get rid of 33% of the past number of units. Joined with the expanded size, NSB could supplant three-vehicle trains with two-vehicle trains. In the meantime, some littler stops were ended to permit quicker travel time. Eighty-eight units were conveyed in four arrangement somewhere in the range of 1970 and 1993, with later arrangement having a three-vehicle design. On 3 June 1973, the long LierÄÄ¾sen Tunnel opened, shortening the Drammen Line by . The long segment from Asker to Spikkestad was kept as a branch line, and named the Spikkestad Line, while the segment from Spikkestad to BrakerÄÂ¸ya was expelled. 

The Oslo Tunnel opened on 30 May 1980, associating the Drammen Line to OsloÃ¢Â ÄÂ. At first, just the LillestrÄÂ¸mÃ¢ÂÂ 

Drammen/Spikkestad lines utilized the passage, notwithstanding a few administrations from Eidsvoll and ÄÂrnes to SkÄÂ¸yen. In the meantime, OsloÃ¢Â ÄÂ was modified to the 19-stage OsloÃÂ S, which was put into administration on 26 November 1986. OsloÃÂ V was shut on 27 May 1989. 

In 1993, NSB got an expansive conveyance of center autos for most of the Class 69 units, permitting NSB to work them as three-vehicle trains. Somewhere in the range of 1992 and 1996, another, overhauled twofold track was put into administration among Ski and Moss. The area is fit for rates from . The Gardermoen Line opened as Norway's first fast line on 8 October 1998. The line runs parallel to the Trunk Line from OsloÃÂ S to Eidsvoll, by means of Oslo Airport, GardermoenÃ¢ÂÂwhich opened that day. The segment from OsloÃÂ S to LillestrÄÂ¸m, comprising chiefly of the Romerike Tunnel, was deferred on account of breaks in the passage, and opened on 22 August 1999. In 1997, NSB requested 36 Class 72 various units to enhance and supplant existing material. They were tormented green and marked as a major aspect of the NSB Puls plot, which was immediately relinquished. The four-vehicle units were taken into administration in 2002. 

The service chose in the mid 2000s to make the administrations on the GjÄÂ¸vik Line subject to open administration commitments, as a preliminary to privatize task of all traveler train benefits in Norway. In the delicate, NSB's auxiliary, NSB Anbud (since renamed NSB GjÄÂ¸vikbanen) won the ten-year contract, subsequent to having underbid Veolia Transport Norge and DSB. Nine Class 69 trains were updated and assigned 69G and will work until 2015 on the GjÄÂ¸vik Line. In view of a bureau change in 2005, the PSO contracting was ended. On 27 August 2005, the Asker Line opened among Sandvika and Asker, enabling trains to sidestep the numerous nearby stations at . 

In 2011, the Asker Line from Lysaker to Sandvika, and another Lysaker Station opened. This expanded the limit and consistency along the Drammen Line. 

The opening of four tracks at Lysaker will permit NSB to run every neighborhood train that beforehand have hurried to SkÄÂ¸yen right to Lysaker. The shut HÄÂ¸vik Station will be utilized to turn trains. The Oslo Tunnel remains the bottleneck west of Oslo, so no more trains can run westwards, albeit more will probably proceed past SkÄÂ¸yen. 

In 2008, NSB requested 50 Stadler FLIRT numerous units, to be assigned Class 74 and 75, and later 16 more Class 75. 42 of these, class 75, have a passenger train design. NSB holds a possibility for an extra 84 units. The trains have a greatest speed of and a quicker increasing speed than the more seasoned classes. The mix of the Asker Line and all the more moving stock permits NSB to work an increasingly forceful administration after a noteworthy rebuilding of the lines in 2012. Specifically, there are somewhere in the range of five and seven-minute progress on the segments among Asker and LillestrÄÂ¸m, and a twenty-minute progress to Oslo Airport and Eidsvoll. 

The following bigger railroad development around Oslo is booked to be the Follo Line, which will interface Oslo Central Station legitimately with Ski. The long queue is wanted to be constructed about altogether in a solitary passage and will permit speeds at . It will permit higher velocities and limit southwards for the lines to Moss and Rakkestad, just as local trains to ÄÂstfold and Sweden. The line is booked for fulfillment in 2018. Parliament has passed the Ringerike Line, which would keep running from Sandvika to HÄÂ¸nefoss Station on the Bergen Line. While for the most part proposed as a shortening of the Bergen Line, the line would bend over as a passenger train line, permitting HÄÂ¸nefoss and Ringerike altogether quicker open transport to the capital zone. The line would be long and permit rates of . Be that as it may, no financing has been verified for the venture.
