Kevin Feige had an appearance as a Weapon X tech, yet his scenes did not make the polished product of the film. 

Wonder Comics essayists and boss editors Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas composed a "X-Men" screenplay in 1984 when Orion Pictures held a choice on the film rights, however improvement slowed down when Orion started confronting money related inconveniences. All through 1989 and 1990, Stan Lee and Chris Claremont were in exchanges with Carolco Pictures for a X-Men movie adjustment, with James Cameron as maker and Kathryn Bigelow coordinating. A story treatment was composed by Bigelow, with Bob Hoskins being considered for Wolverine and Angela Bassett being considered for the job of Storm. The arrangement went into disrepair when Stan Lee aroused Cameron's enthusiasm on an "Arachnid Man" film, Carolco going bankrupt, and the film rights returning to Marvel. In December 1992, Marvel talked about pitching the property to Columbia Pictures without much of any result. In the mean time, Avi Arad created the vivified "X-Men" TV arrangement for Fox Kids. twentieth Century Fox was inspired by the achievement of the TV show, and maker Lauren Shuler Donner bought the film rights for them in 1994, bringing Andrew Kevin Walker to compose the content. 

Walker's draft included Professor Xavier selecting Wolverine into the X-Men, which comprises of Cyclops, Jean Gray, Iceman, Beast, and Angel. The Brotherhood of Mutants, which comprised of Magneto, Sabretooth, Toad, Juggernaut and the Blob, attempt to overcome New York City, while Henry Peter Gyrich and Bolivar Trask assault the X-Men with three tall Sentinels. The content concentrated on the competition among Wolverine and Cyclops, just as the last's self-question as a field chief.

Fox at that point reported a Christmas 1998 discharge date. In late 1997, the monetary allowance was anticipated at $60 million. In late 1998, Singer and DeSanto sent a treatment to Fox, which they accepted was "immaculate" in light of the fact that it took "genuinely" the topics and the examinations among Xavier and Magneto and Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, in contrast to different contents. They made Rogue a critical character since Singer perceived that her change, which renders her unfit to contact anybody, was the most emblematic of estrangement. Artist combined traits of Kitty Pryde and Jubilee into the film's portrayal of Rogue. Magneto's plot to change the world chiefs into tolerating his kin is reminiscent of how Constantine I's transformation to Christianity finished the oppression of early Christians in the Roman Empire; the similarity was stressed in an erased scene in which Storm educates history. Congressperson Kelly's case that he has a rundown of freaks living in the United States reviews Joseph McCarthy's comparable case with respect to socialists. 

Fox, who had anticipated the financial plan at $75 million, dismissed the treatment which they evaluated would have cost $5 million more. Brute, Nightcrawler, Pyro, and the Danger Room must be erased before the studio greenlighted "X-Men". Fox head Bill Mechanic contended this would improve the story, and Singer agreed that expelling the Danger Room enabled him to concentrate on different scenes he favored. Components of Beast, especially his therapeutic skill, were exchanged to Jean Gray. Vocalist and DeSanto brought Christopher McQuarrie from "The Usual Suspects", and together did another rework.

Some portion of Scott's agreement incorporated a continuation, however pulled out because of planning clashes with "" toward the beginning of October 1999 and was harmed in a motorbike mishap. Jackman was then cast three weeks into shooting, in light of an effective tryout. Glenn Danzig was welcomed by twentieth Century Fox to try out for the job of Wolverine, as his tallness and fabricate intently take after that of the film's hero, as depicted in the first comic books.

Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey were additionally considered for the job of Storm. Anna Paquin dropped out of the lead job in "Tart" for "X-Men". Drew Barrymore, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Katie Holmes, Christina Ricci, Alicia Silverstone and Katharine Isabelle were considered for the job of Rogue, in spite of the fact that Natalie Portman turned it down. Selma Blair, Renee O'Connor, Lucy Lawless and Maria Bello were considered for the job of Jean Gray. Peta Wilson was offered the job of Jean Gray, yet needed to film the fourth period of "La Femme Nikita" (1997) rather and Helen Hunt was approached to play Jean Gray, yet she turned down the job. David Hemblen, Christopher Lee and Terence Stamp were considered for Magneto before Singer cast Ian McKellen, who had acted in his past film, "Able Pupil". McKellen reacted to the gay moral story of the film, "the purposeful anecdote of the freaks as pariahs, disappointed and alone and going to the majority of that at pubescence when their distinction shows," Singer clarified. "Ian is a dissident and he truly reacted to the capability of that purposeful anecdote." 

The first begin date was mid-1999, with the discharge date set for Christmas 2000, however Fox moved "X-Men" to June. Steven Spielberg had been booked to film "Minority Report" for discharge in June 2000, yet he had shot "A.I. Man-made reasoning", and Fox required a film to fill the void.

Spencer Smith Park (in Burlington, Ontario) multiplied for Liberty Island. After creation was riotous, with Shuler Donner saying that "we needed to bolt picture and score and alter, some of the time in the meantime." 

The movie producers chose not to duplicate the X-Men ensembles as found in the comic book. Stan Lee and Chris Claremont bolstered this choice. Claremont clowned, "you can do that on an illustration, yet when you put it on individuals it's aggravating!" Producer/co-essayist Tom DeSanto had been steady of utilizing the blue and yellow shading plan of the funnies, however came to reason that they would not work onscreen. To recognize the fan objections, Singer included Cyclops' line "What might you favor, yellow spandex?"Ã¢ÂÂwhen Wolverine whines about wearing their uniformsÃ¢ÂÂduring shooting. Artist noticed that strong dark calfskin seemed well and good for the X-Men to wear as defensive attire, and Shuler Donner included that the ensembles helped them "mix into the night". 

Oakley, Inc. given the red-lensed glasses worn by Cyclops, a tweaked rendition of the organization's very own X-Metal Juliet. Wolverine's paws required no cast of Hugh Jackman's hands, and were fabricated so he could without much of a stretch put them on and take them off for wellbeing reasons. Creation had demanded that they be connected consistently under a full prosthetic sleeve yet fashioner Gordon Smith would not do it. Creation additionally demanded genuine metal sharp edges, which Smith likewise wouldn't do, making infusion formed mortar cutting edges. Several sets were worked for Jackman and his trick pairs. 

Rebecca Romijn-Stamos wore 110 individual silicone prosthetics on her body to depict Mystique; just the edges were stuck, the rest were self-staying. The prosthetics were assembled level and wrapped her body. They were inside shaded with nourishment shading and required extra cosmetics or paint. The first consented to and tried structure was, to shading her skin with corrective evaluation sustenance shading also, yet at last Bryan Singer demanded painting her skin to look hazy, as in the comic book, which added six hours to the cosmetics, making the difficulty troublesome for her. There were additionally no offices given to deplete paint vapor, amid one of Canada's colder winters. Romijn reflected, "I had no contact with the remainder of the cast; it resembled I was making an alternate film from every other person. It was damnation."

At the point when rendered together, it took 39 hours for each casing." They thought about appearing's inside organs amid the change, "however that appeared to be excessively grisly", as per Cunningham. 

Vocalist moved toward John Williams to make the film score, yet Williams turned down the offer due to booking clashes. At that point Singer set on his standard author, John Ottman. In any case, when Fox pushed "X-Men" from December to July, Ottman's responsibility to coordinate "" made him unfit to work with Singer. Michael Kamen was in the long run contracted. Given the film was just finished without further ado before its debut, Kamen composed the score to the completed scenes, which were sent to him similarly as work was done on them. Artist asked him not to utilize any melodies in the soundtrack as he "would not like to date the motion picture".
