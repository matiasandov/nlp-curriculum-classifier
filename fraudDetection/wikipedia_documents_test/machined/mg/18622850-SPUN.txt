Everything That Happens Will Happen Today 

Everything ThatÃÂ Happens WillÃÂ Happen Today is the second collection made in joint effort among DavidÃÂ Byrne and BrianÃÂ Eno, discharged on August 18, 2008, by TodoÃÂ Mundo. The collection investigates subjects of mankind versus innovation and hopefulness regardless of grim condition through the mixing of electronic and gospelÃ¢Â music. Basic gathering was to a great extent positive and the collection got grants for both the melodic substance just as the bundling and specialized generation. 

This collection is the principal joint exertion between the two performers since 1981's "MyÃÂ LifeÃÂ inÃÂ theÃÂ BushÃÂ ofÃÂ Ghosts" and Eno's work creating and co-composing with TalkingÃÂ Heads. Byrne and Eno chipped away at the tracks in their home studios all through 2007 and mid 2008 and sent computerized duplicates of the chronicles to each other over email. The single "StrangeÃÂ Overtones" was discharged for nothing to advance the collection and Byrne visited through 2008 and 2009, performing tunes from this discharge just as the team's past joint efforts. This visit was later recorded with the live extendedÃ¢Â play "" and the concertÃ¢Â film "Ride,ÃÂ Rise,ÃÂ Roar". 

"Everything ThatÃÂ Happens WillÃÂ Happen Today" was discharged with a showcasing procedure that included Byrne making the vanity name TodoÃÂ Mundo and employing Internet new business TopspinÃÂ Media to advance the collection web based utilizing verbal exchange and Internet deals to advertise the music. A few organizations were made to enable clients to have choices on the most proficient method to tune in to the musicÃ¢ÂÂfrom free gushing sound to a fancy bundle housed in a tin. 

In December 2007, David Byrne reported on the BBCÃÂ Radio music show "TheÃÂ Weekender" that he was working with previous partner BrianÃÂ Eno on a pristine collection of "legitimate melodies," portraying it as a "totally extraordinary thing" from the exploratory "MyÃÂ LifeÃÂ inÃÂ theÃÂ BushÃÂ ofÃÂ Ghosts". While the two were talking about the 2006 re-arrival of that collection at an evening gathering, Eno recommended adding verses and vocals to a portion of his incomplete melodies, some of which were eightÃ¢Â years old. The team did not at first arrangement on making a whole collection, however in the end felt sufficiently certain to complete a full accumulation of tunes. In spite of the fact that the two had examined making a collection together for quite a long while, this was their first earnest exertion since the mid 1980s. 

Byrne visited Eno's London studio to tune in to the demos and the two chose to team up to wrap up the melodies, leaving Eno and PeterÃÂ Chilvers to change over an assortment of digitalÃ¢Â music positions into MIDI, in this manner stripping out unessential data and making them reasonable for Byrne to decorate. (Chilvers would be said thanks to in the liner notes for "Advanced Archeology".) The two kept on chipping away at this and other melodic undertakings for a while and concurred that if the venture was not pleasant, they would forsake it. The pair chose to not report their new coordinated effort for dread that they may not finish a collection of new material, or that they would finish up re-stepping their past joint efforts and rule against discharging the new tunes. 

Eno had a few melodic sytheses, however couldn't compose verses to go with them, though Byrne had a few verses with no backup. Eno needed to make the vocals the "focal occasion" of the music by matching gospel singing with sudden electronic music that additionally included components of WestÃÂ African music. The songwriting's accentuation on vocals was mostly motivated by PhillipÃÂ Bimstein. In late 2007, Byrne took a CompactÃÂ Disc of stereo blends of the demos from Eno and went through a year endeavoring to compose verses to complete the tunes, endeavoring to adjust the basic harmonies that Eno had composed with the more mind boggling ones Byrne lean towards. In spite of the fact that it was strange for Eno, a significant number of the melodies were composed on acousticÃ¢Â guitar, with the assistance of SteinbergÃÂ Cubase. The performers traded Eno's demos with the verses and vocal songs finished by Byrne over email and by June 2008, 14Ã¢Â songs had been recorded. Eno at first gave positive input, which urged Byrne to keep composing and just wound up basic as the task was wrapping up. Close to the finish of the chronicle, Eno sent progressively provoking tracks to check whether Byrne could total themÃ¢ÂÂthe last two wound up on the collection as "IÃÂ FeelÃÂ MyÃÂ Stuff" and "PoorÃÂ Boy". 

At the beginning, Byrne was reluctant to add verses to the tracks since they sounded a lot of like society music. He described the procedure as moderate and brimming with fear, to a limited extent due to desires from their past coordinated effort and furthermore because of the severe division of work they had between composing instrumentation and vocalization. Eno just gave a couple of vocal demos and proposed straightforward changes like including an additional section. Byrne rolled out negligible improvements to the instrumentation on a few tracks and abstained from changing harmonies in the tune to suit his singing style. The couple just worked in the studio together on two events, including one entire week and an end of the week on another event and neither one of the partners got a veto during the time spent track determination or generation. As per Byrne, the primary test in this composition method "was more passionate than specialized: to compose straightforward sincere tunes without illustration on clichÄÅ¡." 

He later clarified, "more or less, Brian composed the vast majority of the music, and I made most out of the vocal tunes and verses, and afterward sang them." If Byrne's vocal harmonies were radical enough, Eno would overhaul the instrumentation to go with it, yet Byrne abstained from composing instrumentation and adjusted to the instrumentals as composed. Utilizing a style like the Talking Heads collection "SpeakingÃÂ inÃÂ Tongues", Byrne scatted and mumbled a few verses before they were finished, because of Byrne's inclination for the sonic nature of verses as opposed to their exacting significance and his strategy for composing verses utilizing free affiliation. In making verses for the collection, Byrne endeavored to compose remembering what might please Eno as his partner. He likewise endeavored to compose harmonies for Eno, who ruled against singing any lead vocals on the collection. Eno performs backing vocals all through the collection, which he acknowledges on one track as "inhumanÃ¢Â piano" 

The two performers kept on dealing with their very own tasks amid the organization of "Everything ThatÃÂ Happens WillÃÂ Happen Today". Byrne of "BigÃÂ Love" and finished his coordinated efforts with Fatboy Slim on the collection and melodic "HereÃÂ LiesÃÂ Love" and the single "ToeÃÂ Jam". Eno created Coldplay's "VivaÃÂ laÃÂ Vida or DeathÃÂ andÃÂ AllÃÂ HisÃÂ Friends" and U2's "NoÃÂ LineÃÂ onÃÂ theÃÂ Horizon". Byrne and Eno talked about the previous' coordinated effort with FatboyÃÂ Slim and ChrisÃÂ Martin of Coldplay composed verses to the instrumental track for "OneÃÂ FineÃÂ Day", yet submitted when he heard Byrne's form (the band would likewise adjust another of Eno's instrumental organizations that Byrne did not complete into a track on "VivaÃÂ laÃÂ Vida"). When Byrne's adaptation of "OneÃÂ FineÃÂ Day" was done, the two started decisively composing the remainder of the tracks. Byrne at first had a long postponement recorded as a hard copy material, however as the task advanced, he got to working a few hours every day on the collection and put his coordinated effort with FatboyÃÂ Slim on hold to complete the tunes in the early piece of 2008. Since the two did not cooperate up close and personal as they had before, it was more earnestly for them to finish material rapidly, and they needed to race to finish two of the tracks were done toward the finish of the sessions. He later depicted the procedure as simple once subtleties were sort out and summed up this technique as "pureÃ¢Â joy" and pronounced composing cooperatively to be simpler than composing solo. He even credited the time between their last cooperation and the transoceanic separation as a quality, since it enabled the two to keep their very own timetables. Eno concurred, as it gave him an opportunity to concentrate on a little bit of music without holding up Byrne's advancement. Byrne later utilized a comparable methodology through 2010 and 2011 in joint efforts with St.ÃÂ Vincent ("Love This Giant") and WillÃÂ Oldham (the soundtrack to "This Must Be the Place"). 

The two were enlivened by gospelÃ¢Â music and both have depicted their music as "electronicÃ¢Â gospel"Ã¢ÂÂin specific the tracks "LifeÃÂ IsÃÂ Long" and "OneÃÂ FineÃÂ Day". Notwithstanding inconspicuous Biblical subjects in the verses, Eno was affected by gospel musicality, which he at first found through Talking Heads while taking a shot at "MoreÃÂ SongsÃÂ AboutÃÂ BuildingsÃÂ andÃÂ Food" by tuning in to "SurrenderÃÂ toÃÂ HisÃÂ Will" by ReverendÃÂ MaceoÃÂ Woods and The ChristianÃÂ TabernacleÃÂ Choir. For quite a while paving the way to this task, Eno had principally tuned in to gospelÃ¢Â musicÃ¢ÂÂeven joining a gospelÃ¢Â choirÃ¢ÂÂand was pulled in to the music's unreasonable vocals and absence of cynicism just as its comprehensive nature. Eno had been pondering gospel for quite a long while, however couldn't compose verses to confident melodies. 

While Byrne considers the music "[un]like any contemporary gospel record that you would hear out there," it is "educated by that feeling and those sort of verses, which imply trust notwithstanding despair." Eno likewise considers the collection "something that joins something exceptionally human and untrustworthy and individual, with something electronic and scientific here and there." The music consolidates electronic and gospel impacts to "make that image of the human as yet attempting to get by in an inexorably confused computerized world... It's very simple to make just digitalÃ¢Â music and it's very simple to make just humanÃ¢Â music, yet to attempt and make a mix is kind of, energizing, I think." Tracks, for example, "MyÃÂ BigÃÂ Nurse" consolidate apocalypticism and solace, mixing confidence and depression. 

The instrumental demos were basically written in majorÃ¢Â chords, which Byrne considered somewhat "unpropitious" and astonishing from Eno. Regardless of this present, Byrne's verses wound up being cheerful and profound, with subjects of redemptionÃ¢ÂÂwhat he considers "hopefulness disregarding the fear." The pressure among good faith and negativity and the otherworldly topics immediately risen through the span of a year in which Byrne was composing verses, which he has theorized may be a cure to being "totally skeptical and critical about legislative issues and the condition of the world;" for example, "TheÃÂ River" is about the impacts of HurricaneÃÂ Katrina. He has additionally refered to the political atmosphere of the IraqÃÂ War, the start of the late-2000s subsidence, the approaches of the GeorgeÃÂ W.ÃÂ Bush organization, and his 2004 separation from AdelleÃÂ Lutz as components that roused him to make inspiring music. As he clarified, "I was amazed that is the thing that turned out... The tracks are altogether different from what I would have done myself. I lean toward things that are progressively convoluted." Eno likewise thinks the collection is vastly improved than the tunes he envisioned when making them solo. 

Eno has likewise said the collection is about "paint[ing] an image of the human attempting to get by in an undeniably computerized world" and Byrne considered his activity as lyricist to "bring greater humankind" to Eno's instrumentals, which can be "cold and scholarly." Themes of mankind battling with innovation are clear on a few tracks and Byrne has described the "general vibe" of the collection as "We will get past this. Mankind will win." The expressive substance incorporates "a vile emphasis" however "numerous tunes feel decently elevating and the general tone is cheerful." Byrne centered around everyday occasions and endeavored to write in a style that was "straightforward yet not cheesy, fundamental yet genuine." His motivation recorded as a hard copy verses for "OneÃÂ FineÃÂ Day" was the narrative of ValentinoÃÂ AchakÃÂ Deng as told in DaveÃÂ Eggers' ""Ã¢ÂÂthe two are said thanks to in the liner notes and Byrne had recently performed at a pledge drive for Eggers' 826ÃÂ Valencia. The narrative of the LostÃÂ Boys of Sudan is significant of the otherworldly subjects of the collection as they experience "a wide range of persistent detestations, yet [are] interminably confident and even merry, in a way that makes no sense." The music on this collection additionally communicates homesicknessÃ¢ÂÂa melodious pattern that is evident in Byrne's work with TalkingÃÂ Heads. 

By March 2008, the pair had selected SebÃÂ Rochford to play drums with Byrne in New York City. Soon thereafter, multi-instrumentalist and past Eno colleague LeoÃÂ Abrahams was enrolled to perform guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio. Abrahams and Rochford would keep taking a shot at the tracks in Abrahams' studio through May and their work was messaged to other collaboratorsÃ¢ÂÂByrne went to one session to play guitar. Different performers worked with Byrne in NewÃÂ YorkÃÂ City and Eno in London, for example, visit Byrne teammate MauroÃÂ Refosco, Eno's girls Darla and Irial, and JarvisÃÂ Cocker of Pulp, who included uncredited guitar in London. The couple endeavored to record however much of the music from home studios as could be expected and played practically all instrumentation themselves, sparing the drums and percussion for the studio. Notwithstanding the tracks that were discharged, the artists had some different instrumentals that Byrne did not finish. 

Talking at an April 2008 occasion in New York, Byrne affirmed the arrival of another collection, considering it a "record of sung tunes" rather than the trial music from "MyÃÂ LifeÃÂ inÃÂ theÃÂ BushÃÂ ofÃÂ Ghosts" and later told the "NewÃÂ YorkÃÂ DailyÃÂ News" that "Brian had composed a great deal of music, yet required a few words, which I realize how to do. What's it seem like? ElectronicÃ¢Â gospel. That is all I'm stating." Eno likewise clarified the contrasts between this collection and their past one saying, "[T]his is very unique in relation to "MyÃÂ Life" in that the expectation of that collection was to not utilize our voices by any stretch of the imagination, yet rather to discover voices and stick them on to the music. This new one is differentÃ¢ÂÂthese are tunes composed and sung by David... They go from electronic folkÃ¢Â gospel to very indefinable zones of music." 

All through the center of the year, Abrahams recorded drums at his home studio and CherifÃÂ Hashizume recorded more at CafeÃÂ MusicÃÂ Studios, while RobertÃÂ Harder at HarderÃÂ Sound recorded the drums on "MyÃÂ BigÃÂ Nurse", "NeverÃÂ Thought", "TheÃÂ Painting", and "LifeÃÂ IsÃÂ Long". Abrahams gathered the majority of the chronicles to have them blended and Byrne booked visit dates fully expecting finishing the collection. Blending proceeded through June 2008 in New York by past Byrne teammate PatrickÃÂ Dillett at KampoÃÂ Studios, who recorded metal and percussion. They messaged the blends to Eno for definite endorsement and sent the concluded sound to GregÃÂ Calbi at SterlingÃÂ Sound for acing. On July 28, 2008, subtleties of the collection ended up open learning when Byrne posted on his blog that he and Eno had completed the new collection and it would be discharged on August 18. The collection site was propelled around the same time, with a limited time video of Byrne presenting the new collection. 

The physical arrivals of the collection accompanied illustrations and bundling structured by StefanÃÂ Sagmeister with RichardÃÂ The, JoeÃÂ Shouldice, and JaredÃÂ Stone; delineation by StephanÃÂ Walter; and generation by GamilÃÂ Design. Sagmeister had before gotten a BestÃÂ Boxed or SpecialÃÂ LimitedÃÂ EditionÃÂ Package Grammy in 2005 for artÃ¢Â direction on the TalkingÃÂ Heads' "OnceÃÂ inÃÂ aÃÂ Lifetime" boxÃ¢Â set and furthermore planned the spread to Byrne's "Emotions". This collection would likewise win a Grammy in 2010 for BestÃÂ RecordÃÂ Packaging and was furthermore perceived by "CreativeÃÂ Review". 

His motivation for the bundling depended on the tune "Home" and the work of art mirrors a urban scene of a house by a roadside; the linerÃ¢Â notes give closeups on the home and the fine art on the CompactÃÂ Disc is the grass from the garden. Sagmeister continued to make a picture for the spread, however a whole three-dimensional model for the house, which was later discharged as the luxurious version bundling. Upon rehashed listenings to the collection, he wound up persuaded that there was an evil component to the setting and gave hints to the "darkÃ¢Â edge" of the scene, for example, a disposed of condom wrapper in the drain, a man watching out the window with binoculars, and a gas bottle in the kitchen. 

The luxurious bundle arrives in a tin with a microchip that plays a sound of somebody strolling down a lobby in the house and hammering an entryway when the bundle is opened. The urban subjects of the bundling are extended in this version, with the collection entitled "Stick" and the reward content "Shake"; circles are intended to appear as though they are canvassed in grass. This structure of a pixelated, dimetricÃ¢Â projection residential scene has been contrasted with "TheÃÂ Sims". 

The collection was self-discharged on August 18, 2008, only through the collection's site. It was made accessible there free for spilling and for buy as a download of sans drm MP3s. The couple discharged the collection from other online digitalÃ¢Â music administrations beginning the next month, including 7digital, AmazonÃÂ MP3, eMusic, the iTunesÃÂ Store, Napster, and the ZuneÃÂ Marketplace. No recordÃ¢Â label was associated with discharging the digitalÃ¢Â format and independentÃ¢Â distributors were permitted to deal with the physical item, which was discharged on November 25 as an enhancedÃÂ CD and a special bundled CD in a tin. 

At first, three unmistakable variants of the collection were discharged: 

What's more, clients are qualified for lossless FLAC variants of the collection at no additional expense. By mid-December 2008, 12Ã¢Â percent of clients downloaded the FLAC choice. 

This collection is inventoried as the second discharge from Byrne's vanity name TodoÃÂ Mundo after ""; duplicates of the CD were stamped CD-TODO-002. The CD was discharged in Japan with a reward trackÃ¢ÂÂ"PoorÃÂ Boy" (Eno and LeoÃÂ Abrahams Remix)Ã¢ÂÂand obiÃ¢Â strip in November 2008 through BeatÃÂ Records with list number BRC-218. On February 17, 2009, the collection was discharged on 180-gram vinyl LP as LP-TODO-002. 

The primary single off the albumÃ¢ÂÂ"StrangeÃÂ Overtones"Ã¢ÂÂwas discharged on August 4, 2008, as a free computerized download accessible just through the collection's site. The track has been portrayed as "a melody about composition a tune" and highlights topical components of humankind versus innovation that are investigated all through the collection. It was downloaded over 40,000Ã¢Â times inside the initial three days it was accessible. In September 2008, JonÃÂ Yeo made a music video for the track highlighting the depictions of BrianÃÂ Eno. In May 2009, the tune was supplanted by "OneÃÂ FineÃÂ Day" as a free download to advance the EP "". 

Positive audits have accentuated the pop songcraft on the collection, calling it "exceedinglyÃ¢Â pleasant" ("Billboard") and "energetic" ("Tucson Weekly"). Composing for the BBC, Chris Jones summed up the collection by saying that it would not break any melodic limits, yet audience members will discover music that was "intriguingly and, here and there, maddeningly irresistible." 

The music has been contrasted with the tone of elective musical gangs Radiohead, TheÃÂ FlamingÃÂ Lips, and R.E.M's. 1998 collection "Up". Moreover, Barry Walters of "Turn" has contrasted the music with previous Eno associates U2 and a few analysts have contrasted the musicality with PaulÃÂ SimonÃ¢ÂÂespecially his 2006 Eno coordinated effort "Shock". The vocals have been proclaimed like NeilÃÂ Young; and the course of action has been contrasted with TheÃÂ BeachÃÂ Boys. Despite the fact that the music was educated by gospel and computerized music, correlations have been made with classes as various as nation because of the vocal conveyance and oldÃ¢Â schoolÃ¢Â hipÃ¢Â hop. One shortcoming tended to by a few commentators is the predictability of the music, particularly in contrast with the couple's past joint efforts. 

Differentiating "Everything ThatÃÂ Happens WillÃÂ Happen Today" with "MyÃÂ LifeÃÂ inÃÂ theÃÂ BushÃÂ ofÃÂ Ghosts", some have discovered an association between the two. Commentators have discovered likenesses in Eno's performance collection "AnotherÃÂ GreenÃÂ World" and the Eno-delivered Talking Heads collections "FearÃÂ ofÃÂ Music" and "RemainÃÂ inÃÂ Light", just as "LittleÃÂ Creatures", which was created by the band. This is mostly because of the one of a kind utilization of innovation in the production of the majority of the collections related with Eno. Different observers have underscored the contrasts between the two ventures. For example, "The Age" Bernard Zuel considers these desires worked by the before work to be "out of line... what's more, wrong." "TheÃÂ Observer" audit by KittyÃÂ Empire names this collection "moderate" and JohnÃÂ Doran of "TheÃÂ Quietus" calls it "lessÃÂ exciting"Ã¢ÂÂ"Erie Times-News" commentator Dr.ÃÂ Rock ventures to consider it a "direct opposite" to "BushÃÂ ofÃÂ Ghosts". Specifically, the trial idea of the previous has been stood out from the popÃ¢Â music style of this collection and the absence of AfricanÃ¢Â beats and worldÃ¢Â music. AudraÃÂ Schroeder of "TheÃÂ AustinÃÂ Chronicle" noted "ThirtyÃ¢Â years after first teaming up on the TalkingÃÂ Heads, these two don't need to mine the past since there's nothing that surprising about "Everything"." FrancisÃÂ Jones summed up his audit for "HotÃÂ Press" by finishing up "No limits were hurt in its creation however "ETHWHT" is a collection of undeniably incredible melodies" and LouiseÃÂ Gray of "NewÃÂ Internationalist" proclaimed that, "it's not got the tense, out of control bricolage that portrayed the before collection and nor does it look for that." in the meantime, different analysts have discovered the break with the exploratory idea of "MyÃÂ LifeÃÂ inÃÂ theÃÂ BushÃÂ ofÃÂ Ghosts" to be sure. JimÃÂ DeRogatis from the "ChicagoÃÂ Sun-Times" watched: 

Audits have stressed the complexity among confidence and premonition on the collection, just as the battle of humankind against innovation. Furthermore, a few commentators have noted parallels between this collection and Byrne's "BigÃÂ Love:ÃÂ Hymnal", especially their basic otherworldly subjects and barometrical inclinations. "ResidentÃÂ Advisor"s audit likewise noticed the move in Eno's chronicles toward more gospel vocals. SteveÃÂ Matteo of "Crawdaddy!" composed that Eno's generation rules the collection, while "Filter"s KenÃÂ Scrudato considers the collection basically a David Byrne adventure. ConsequenceÃÂ ofÃÂ Sound's audit notes progression between this collection and Byrne's 2004 discharge "GrownÃÂ Backwards", while "The Village Voice" has proclaimed this collection "increasingly extensive and daring" than everything else Byrne has discharged in decades and GregÃÂ Kot of "TheÃÂ ChicagoÃÂ Tribune" composed that the collection highlights "one of the most grounded vocal exhibitions of Byrne's profession." 

The collection was designated for three GrammyÃÂ AwardsÃ¢ÂÂBestÃÂ AlternativeÃÂ MusicÃÂ Album, BestÃÂ RecordingÃÂ Package, and BestÃÂ Boxed or SpecialÃÂ LimitedÃÂ EditionÃÂ PackageÃ¢ÂÂon December 2, 2008. On February 8, 2009, originator StefanÃÂ Sagmeister won the honor for BestÃÂ RecordingÃÂ Package at the 51st Annual GrammyÃÂ Awards. The deluxeÃ¢Â edition bundling was given a bronzeÃ¢Â medal by the ArtÃÂ DirectorsÃÂ Club of New York. The collection was selected for a TechnicalÃÂ ExcellenceÃÂ &ÃÂ CreativityÃÂ Award in the RecordÃÂ Production/Album class. 

A multi year-end records incorporated the collection among the best arrivals of 2008: 

DeRogatis' and Kot's surveys were highlighted on "SoundÃÂ Opinions" and the collection was additionally set on two individual essayists' rundowns for "NoÃÂ Ripcord"s best of the year. Two supporters of "NoÃÂ Depression" incorporated the collection on their best-of records for 2008. "TheÃÂ A.V.ÃÂ Club" appointed VIPs to give their picks for collection of the year and TimÃÂ Heidecker picked this collection, depicting it as "the most fascinating and listenable popÃ¢Â record of the year, in my book." "TheÃÂ Fader"s multi year in audit named this one of the "Top TwelveÃÂ Albums That We Thought Would Have a Bigger Impact On Our Lives", yet later proclaimed the collection "profession characterizing." The production committed their yearly symbol issue to Byrne in 2009 to some degree because of the accomplishment of this collection. 

A few tunes from this collection showed up on "TheÃÂ VillageÃÂ Voice"s PazzÃÂ &ÃÂ Jop singles survey for 2008Ã¢ÂÂ"StrangeÃÂ Overtones" came in at 60, "LifeÃÂ IsÃÂ Long" put 337, "MyÃÂ BigÃÂ Nurse" was 350, "EverythingÃÂ ThatÃÂ Happens" wound up at 748, and "IÃÂ FeelÃÂ MyÃÂ Stuff" achieved 942. Furthermore, a vote was thrown for "". 

In spite of the fact that the craftsmen have not discharged deals figures, they have demonstrated that the collection was bought over the globe amid the principal 24Ã¢Â hours it was accessible and that the servers facilitating the collection conveyed "severalÃ¢Â terabytes" by September 6. A report in lateÃÂ December affirmed that they had sold "almost 20,000Ã¢Â downloads." In March 2009, IanÃÂ C.ÃÂ Rogers of TopspinÃÂ Media clarified that 20Ã¢Â percent of the individuals who tuned in to the collection spilling acquired it and 30Ã¢Â percent of them incorporated a physical duplicate of the CD; drifts that would hold through September of that year. By October 2008, Byrne clarified that they had recovered their misfortunes on the collection and that deals had "paid back the chronicle expenses and expenses for structure the WebÃ¢Â site." He would later clarify that this plan of action functioned admirably for set up goes about just as littler groups, because of insignificant creation and dissemination costs. Their plan of action additionally enabled them to self-discharge and plan a visit following completing the music generation, as opposed to hang tight months for record name headway. 

The collection did not diagram until it was physically releasedÃ¢ÂÂa improvement which amazed Byrne. In the main seven day stretch of December, "Everything ThatÃÂ Happens WillÃÂ Happen Today" achieved the top spot on the "CollegeÃÂ MusicÃÂ Journal" AAA diagrams and third on the CMJ RadioÃ¢Â 200. The collection entered the "Billboard"Ã¢Â 200 for the seven day stretch of January 17, 2009, appearing at 182 with 4,008 duplicates sold. It crested the next week at 174 preceding dropping off the graphs. It was on the IndependentÃÂ Albums outline for 10Ã¢Â weeks, achieving 18. 

Byrne's 2012 book "How Music Works" gives a progressively careful breakdown of the collection's deals and conveyance. When of distribution, he professes to have sold 160,000 duplicates of the collection, making somewhat over $300,000 in deals: 

While Byrne and Eno completed a couple of meetings for the collection and ensuing visit, the two endeavored to advertise the collection through informal exchange and Internet publicity as opposed to a customary showcasing plan. Eno was persuaded to some degree due to his very own inclinations for advanced music from the iTunesÃÂ Store as opposed to CDs just as the accomplishment of Radiohead's 2007 collection "InÃÂ Rainbows" and the self-limited time methodologies of NineÃÂ InchÃÂ Nails for the collections "YearÃÂ Zero", "Phantoms IÃ¢ÂÂIV", and "TheÃÂ Slip". Byrne was additionally awed by Radiohead's discharge procedure as a methods for esteeming music. The pair deliberately kept away from InternetÃ¢Â leaks by not giving out limited time duplicates of the collection to columnists, yet Byrne previewed the melody "OneÃÂ FineÃÂ Day" preceding the discharge by performing it with a choir of senior residents and Eno welcomed MarkÃÂ Coles for the BBCÃÂ WorldÃÂ Service program "TheÃÂ Beat" to his home to tune in to the tunes on Eno's PC. In 2017, Byrne uncovered that he and Eno had teamed up again on Byrne's next solo collection. 

In 2010, a few of the tunes from this albumÃ¢ÂÂ"Home", "IÃÂ FeelÃÂ MyÃÂ Stuff", "LifeÃÂ IsÃÂ Long", "MyÃÂ BigÃÂ Nurse", and "StrangeÃÂ Overtones"Ã¢ÂÂwere incorporated into the TodoÃÂ Mundo to the film "" alongside other DavidÃÂ Byrne tunes. 

Byrne and Eno have both communicated their dismay with the musicÃ¢Â industry and customary models of advertising music, with Eno considering the music business an "excitingÃ¢Â mess" and saying: 

Byrne has composed for "Wired", plotting the general benefits of various dissemination models with this one mirroring his "self-distributionÃ¢Â model" in which "the craftsman stands to get the biggest level of pay from deals per unitÃ¢ÂÂsales of anything. A bigger level of less deals, probably, however not generally. Craftsmen doing it for themselves can really get more cash-flow than the gigantic popÃ¢Â star, despite the fact that the business numbers may appear to be infinitesimal by correlation." The inspiration for making and advertising this collection straightforwardly came to a limited extent from the very article Byrne composed just as Eno's conviction that music fans need something beyond the music on a collection and lean toward collectible exclusive versions just as the live exhibitions that advance them. A month in the wake of discharging the collection, Byrne was incredulous of market immersion guaranteeing "I sense that many individuals don't realize we have a record out" and would have liked to offset that numbness with his visit. He likewise depicted the computerized music showcase as "so boundless [that] it's simple for music to get missed out there" and has noticed that this plan of action would not work for entertainers who are not effectively settled.
