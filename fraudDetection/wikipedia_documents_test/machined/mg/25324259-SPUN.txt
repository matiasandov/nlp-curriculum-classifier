AgustÄÂ­n Ross Cultural Center 

AgustÄÂ­n Ross Cultural Center (Spanish, " Centro Cultural AgustÄÂ­n Ross"), recently known as Casino ("Ross Casino"), is the social focus of the city of Pichilemu in Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region, Chile. It was developed somewhere in the range of 1906 and 1909 in line with lawmaker AgustÄÂ­n Ross Edwards. The structure of the social focus is fundamentally the same as that of the Grand Trianon in Versailles, France. 

It is best known for lodging one of the primary gambling clubs of Chile; a club worked in the structure somewhere in the range of 1917 and 1931. After 1931 all gambling clubs, aside from the recently opened Casino de ViÄÄa del Mar, were proclaimed illicit. The structure has additionally been utilized as a mail station, a store selling imported products, a lodging, a discotheque, and a bar. There were two endeavors by the neighborhood government to buy the structure; the first run through in 1982 fizzled while the second in 1995 succeeded. The previous gambling club was pronounced a National Monument of Chile alongside the AgustÄÂ­n Ross Park in February 1988. 

After some time, the structure decayed, and an undertaking was endorsed in January 2007 for it to be redesigned for use as a social focus. The reestablished structure opened in January 2009 and houses the neighborhood library. In January 2010, the social focus was introduced by President Michelle Bachelet and Mayor Roberto CÄÅrdova. 

AgustÄÂ­n Ross Edwards was an affluent Chilean essayist, individual from parliament, government pastor and lawmaker. He apparently had the fantasy of "making a port which could be an option in contrast to the ValparaÄÂ­so port," however this would transform later into "making a touristic place, a first class resort, gathering the most vital attributes of European spots, which would make it exceptional." 

For this reason, Ross Edwards purchased Fundo Pichilemu, a homestead, from Juan Esteban Torrealba Maturana in 1885. There was a little lodging in Fundo Pichilemu called La Posada, which he changed over into a top of the line inn called the Gran Hotel Pichilemu (presently the AgustÄÂ­n Ross Hotel). Following the improvement of the Gran Hotel Pichilemu, Ross Edwards saw the need of making "a shoreline resort with every one of the solaces and extravagances equipped for alluring the Chilean nobility;" for this reason, he imagined making a recreation center, and a mail station building. A short time later, AgustÄÂ­n Ross introduced courtesies, for example, a clothing, stables, and stairways, among others, as indicated by neighborhood history specialist JosÄÅ¡ ArraÄÄo Acevedo, transforming Pichilemu into a mid year resort town for well-off individuals from Santiago and Mendoza, Argentina. 

As per Washington SaldÄÂ­as GonzÄÄlez, manager of "Pichilemu News", the development of the structure kept going from 1906 to 1909, while Jorge Godoy Rojas, draftsman of the University of Chile, expresses that it was worked somewhere in the range of 1904 and 1906. Ross needed it to appear to be like the Grand Trianon of the Tuileries Palace in Paris, France; he imported structure materials and furniture from France and England. After its opening, the structure incorporated a mail station with broadcast administration and a store for imported merchandise, selective to customers of the Gran Hotel Pichilemu. 

The National Monuments Council attests that the principal gambling club in Chile was opened in the structure in 1906; in any case, antiquarians Antonio SaldÄÂ­as and JosÄÅ¡ ArraÄÄo Acevedo have called attention to that it was initiated as an "accepted" gambling club in the mid year of 1917, after AgustÄÂ­n Ross leased the structure to Argentinean representative Alfredo Master. SaldÄÂ­as additionally noticed that there were gambling clubs in Chile before AgustÄÂ­n Ross' landing in Pichilemu, in towns, for example, ConstituciÄÅn. The club worked until 1931, when the Casino de ViÄÄa del Mar, the main authority gambling club of Chile, opened; all others were announced unlawful. Ross passed on in 1925 at age of 82 in ViÄÄa del Mar, only months before "one of his most noteworthy" dreams was practiced: the railroad from Palmilla and the nearby rail route station. 

After the club shut, the structure was generally left unused until the 1940s, when the GonzÄÄlez PÄÅ¡rez family bought it from AgustÄÂ­n Ross de Ferrari, a relative of Ross Edwards. The family changed over the structure into an inn, and in the late 1940s, the underground floor was rebuilt and made a surreptitious gambling club. After twenty years, in the late 1960s, Gustavo GonzÄÄlez PÄÅ¡rez, at that point a pilot in the Chilean Air Force, alongside another individual from the Air Force, made an American-style discotheque called "La Caverna" ("The Cavern") in the storm cellar. A long time later, GonzÄÄlez PÄÅ¡rez exchanged the business to different individuals from his family, who renamed the discotheque "Los Tijuana" ("The Tijuanas"). At last, the GonzÄÄlez PÄÅ¡rez family chose to close the discotheque in the late 1970s. In the blink of an eye a while later, Rancagua agent Carmelita Tello introduced a "boÄÅ¾te" called "Carmelita" in the fundamental room. Afterward, Pichileminian Roberto ÄÂlvarez chose to run a discotheque called "Ace" in a similar spot, while in the meantime, there was a "flame broil bar" called "Wa-Na" in another room; the two organizations worked until the 1990s. The state of the structure step by step weakened, and its utilization ended up limited. 

Amid the organization of Mayor Julio Waidele Wolff (1981Ã¢ÂÂ1983), an endeavor was made to purchase the structure with city reserves; be that as it may, Waidele was not permitted to finish the buy in light of the fact that the cost of eight million pesos (around US$16,000) was "unreasonably high for the city spending plan, and would leave numerous things without financing." The structure would at last be acquired in 1995 by Mayor Orlando Cornejo Bustamante with the help of the Pichilemu City Council, at that point made out of Aldo Polanco Contreras, Jorge Vargas GonzÄÄlez, Mario BichÄÅn CÄÄceres, Mariano Polanco Galarce, and RaÄÅl Tobar Pavez, for 30 million pesos (roughly US$60,000). 

In 1987, after the re-introduction of another work of AgustÄÂ­n Ross, the Ross Park, a solicitation was made to the National Monuments Council that both the recreation center and the previous gambling club be announced "Monumentos HistÄÅricos" (National Monuments); they were so assigned on 25 February 1988. 

After the previous gambling club was bought by the legislature of Pichilemu, the structure was utilized to hold gatherings, shows of artistic creations, models, theater, and for propelling books. In 1997, the Club AÄÅ¡reo de Pichilemu (Aero Club of Pichilemu) mentioned the structure to have the fiftieth yearly get-together of the Air Federation of Chile. Consent was without a doubt, yet the Club AÄÅ¡reo needed to buy latrine installations, as the ones in the structure were genuinely harmed. This incited the administration of Mayor Jorge Vargas GonzÄÄlez (1996Ã¢ÂÂ2007) to start reestablishing the decayed previous gambling club, yet it was not until 2004 that the Regional Government of Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region affirmed financing for a reclamation configuration think about. The examination by the Department of Architecture of the Ministry of Public Works started in 2005 and went on until midÃ¢ÂÂ2006. A while later, on 15 December, Intendant of Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region HÄÅ¡ctor Leiva Polanco disclosed to the network of Pichilemu the structure and declared that he would show a financing proposition amid the following year to the Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Regional (National Fund of Regional Development). The undertaking was endorsed on 23 January 2007; the monetary allowance, as indicated by engineer Jorge Godoy Rojas, was 513,125,000 pesos (US$1,026,250). On 12 June 2007, the monetary allowance was expanded to oblige extra rebuilding work, by 100 million pesos to 663,702,000 pesos (US$1,327,404). 

On 14 February 2007, the Regional Secretary (Seremi) of the Ministry of Public Works, Beatriz Valenzuela, wrote in an article in the online paper "El Rancahuaso", "The momentum condition of the noteworthy landmark is awful, as a result of the weakening of the rooftop, which throughout the years has had for all time spilled water and stickiness. This can be effectively found in the harmed wood of its inside fenced in area and the incredible edge of the mansard rooftop, which is of oak wood." Some months after the fact, on 23 August, Valenzuela declared that the reclamation of the structure would start that equivalent day, after it was approved by the Regional Government; the structure would turn into a social focus, lodging the nearby open library and workmanship exhibitions. The reclamation work was the duty of improvement firm Atelier Consultores. 

Amid the reclamation of the gambling club, various verifiable things were found. Those included papers, explicitly a duplicate of "Las ÄÂltimas Noticias" from February 1941, amid the time the structure filled in as an inn; a US phone battery from 1909; and a tile from the gambling club's roof with marks and illustrations by gambling club laborers in 1915. 

The totally reestablished structure opened on 23 January 2009, one hundred years after its unique development. A show of photos by Ana MarÄÂ­a Encina Lemarchand was the first to be organized in the reestablished structure. In June 2009, a non-political association called the CorporaciÄÅn Cultural de (Pichilemu Cultural Corporation) was shaped to deal with the social focus, as a team with the neighborhood government. The inside's introduction should happen in March of that year, with President Michelle Bachelet Jeria in participation; be that as it may, it was deferred until 27 January 2010. Bachelet visited the rooms of the social focus with Mayor Roberto CÄÅrdova, and later said that the inside "[is] to consolidate itself with the birthplaces of present day Pichilemu, reestablishing the offices to do what is so important: to prepare for the inventiveness, ability, creative energy, longs for such huge numbers of youthful and numerous individuals." 

After the seismic tremors of 27 February, and 11 March 2010, the social focus was "marginally" harmed. The balustrades of both the northwest and southeast towers of the structure tumbled down after the seismic tremors; in the northwest pinnacle, a shaft broke; and there were a few splits and minor harm to the dividers. Fixes occurred in February 2011, with a venture of fourteen million pesos (US$28,000) by the administration of Pichilemu. 

The Centro Cultural AgustÄÂ­n Ross houses the neighborhood open library, and has four presentation rooms, an assembly hall, a music room, and a few different rooms in which workshops happen for yoga, gymnastics, theater, and different controls for individuals everything being equal. The rebuilding of the social focus incited the production of an autonomous association called the CorporaciÄÅn Cultural de (Pichilemu Cultural Corporation). 

The Biblioteca PÄÅblica de Pichilemu (Public Library of Pichilemu) is the open library of the city of Pichilemu, and its executive starting at 2011 is MarÄÂ­a AngÄÅ¡lica YÄÄÄÄez CortÄÅ¡s. The library was made on 16 May 1989, under the initiative of Mayor RenÄÅ¡ Maturana Maldonado. 

The library was recently situated in a devoted structure on Santa MarÄÂ­a Avenue from 1989 until 16 January 2009, preceding moving to the Centro Cultural AgustÄÂ­n Ross. In September 2010, the library got a gift of 150 music and culture-related books with the assistance of Alejandra Domedel, the social focus' correspondences and social administration officer. 

Jorge Godoy Rojas, designer of the University of Chile, proposed in a January 2007 article he composed for the online paper "El Cachapoal" that a semi-self-ruling lawful element be set up for the administration of the social focus. Such a lawful substance had likewise been recommended to the specialists beforehand by neighborhood social associations for quite a long while, yet they had been to a great extent disregarded. On 20 November 2008, fourteen neighborhood associations, including the Tourism Chamber of Pichilemu, the AgrupaciÄÅn Ciudadana por un Pichilemu Limpio (Citizens Group for a Clean Pichilemu), and Canal 3 Pichilemu, sent a letter to the Pichilemu City Council mentioning the formation of the CorporaciÄÅn Cultural de (Pichilemu Cultural Corporation) for the third time. 

In May 2009, city representative Jorge Torres Avaca revealed that the Cultural Corporation had been endorsed by the City Council, and its constitution was to be drawn up on 2 June; it was affirmed on 11 June. Of the seven chiefs of the partnership, two are chosen, two are designated by the Pichilemu City Council, and another two by the territorial or commonplace government, and the city hall leader directs as the seventh part. Long-term Pichilemu occupant stone carver Macarena IrarrÄÄzabal Correa and Professor Carlos Leyton Labarca, local of the adjacent town of Ciruelos and maker of the Museo del NiÄÄo Rural (Museum of the Rural Child), were chosen. 

There is a prevalent misconception encompassing the previous gambling club which recounts "underground surrenders" between the Gruta de la Virgen (otherwise called the Gruta de Nuestra SeÄÄora de Lourdes; Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes) and the structure, crossing AgustÄÂ­n Ross Park. Amid the reclamation of the structure, in December 2007, it was accounted for that "two extraordinary dividers developed with flagstone, extremely wide and exceptionally near one another" were found, however nothing was affirmed a short time later. 

Before the previous gambling club building was finished, in 1908, AgustÄÂ­n Ross Edwards and Evaristo Merino answered to historiographer JosÄÅ¡ Toribio Medina the presence of indigenous stays in the cavern presently called the Gruta de la Virgen. Medina asked Argentinean ethnographer FÄÅ¡lix Faustino Outes to examine the remaining parts, and in this way Medina composed the book "Los Restos IndÄÂ­genas de Pichilemu" ("The Indigenous Remains of Pichilemu"), utilizing the report Faustino Outes gave him. 

American author Trudy Larkin Forster composed the book "Los Gatos del Casino: la Historia de Don AgustÄÂ­n Ross Edwards y la Brigada de los Gatos Negros" ("The Cats of the Casino: the History of Sir AgustÄÂ­n Ross Edwards and the Brigade of the Black Cats") in 1999. The book is set in Pichilemu and the AgustÄÂ­n Ross Casino, and it was debuted in the Children's Book Fair of Santiago in June 1999, and afterward in the AgustÄÂ­n Ross Art Room (in current Centro Cultural AgustÄÂ­n Ross) on 18 September of that year.
