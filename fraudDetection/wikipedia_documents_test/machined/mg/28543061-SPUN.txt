Hygrophorus eburneus 

Hygrophorus eburneus, usually known as the ivory waxy top or the cowpoke's hanky, is a types of consumable mushroom in the waxgill group of growths. It is across the board in Europe and North America, and has additionally been gathered in northern Africa. The natural product bodies are medium-sized, unadulterated white, and when wet are shrouded in a layer of sludge thick enough to make the mushroom hard to get. The gills are comprehensively connected to the stem or running down it; as the family name recommends, they feel waxy when scoured between the fingers. Like all "Hygrophorus" species, the organism is mycorrhizalÃ¢ÂÂa harmonious affiliation whereby the underground parasitic mycelia enter and trade supplements with tree roots. They are normal in an assortment of woods types, where they develop on the ground in bushes or lush zones. "Hygrophorus eburneus" is the sort types of the class "Hygrophorus". Various naturally dynamic synthetic substances have been filtered from the organic product assortments of the growth, incorporating unsaturated fats with bactericidal and fungicidal action. 

The species was first named as "Agaricus eburneus" by French botanist Jean Bulliard in 1783. Elias Fries partitioned the extensive variety "Agaricus" into various "clans" (systematically equal to present day areas) in his "Systema Mycologicum I", and grouped "A.Ã¢Â eburneus" in the clan "Limacium". At the point when In 1836, Fries previously characterized the family "Hygrophorus" in his "Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici", "H. eburneus" was incorporated. The parasite has likewise been named "Limacium eburneum" by Paul Kummer in 1871, when he raised the clans of Fries to the position of class, and "Gymnopus eburneus" by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821. "H.Ã¢Â eburneus" is the sort types of the variety "Hygrophorus", and is grouped in the segment "Hygrophorus", subsection "Hygrophorus". This incorporates species with non-amyloid, smooth spores, and different hyphae in the tissue of the hymenium. Different species in this subsection incorporate "H.Ã¢Â eburneiformis", "H.Ã¢Â coccus", "H.Ã¢Â ponderatus", "H.Ã¢Â chrysaspis", and "H.Ã¢Â glutinosus". 

The mushroom is usually known as the "ivory waxy top", the "white waxy top", or the "cattle rustler's tissue". The particular appellation "eburneus" is a Latin descriptive word signifying "of ivory". 

The top of "H.Ã¢Â eburneus" is expansive, with a shape running from arched to smoothed, now and then with an umbo (a brought zone up in the focal point of the top). In age the top edge once in a while winds up raised and the focal point of the top discouraged. The top is unadulterated white, and relying upon the dampness in nature, might be glutinous to sticky. The top surface is smooth, the edge is even and in youthful examples, rolled internal and secured with short fibrils. The substance is white, thick in the focal point of the top yet diminishing toward the edge. The smell and taste are mellow. The gills are to some degree arcuate-decurrent, which means they are molded like a bow, bending upward and after that running down the stem for a short separation. Regarding dividing, they are subdistant to inaccessible, with the goal that space can be seen between them. The gills are tolerably wide, broadest close to the stem, limited in front, unadulterated white, somewhat yellowish or buff with age or when dried. The stem is long, thick, equivalent in width all through its length to some degree decreased descending or with an incredibly weakened base, and glutinous. Its surface is luxurious underneath the gluten. The highest point of the stem is secured with short fibrils, unadulterated white, now and again getting to be grayish or grimy with age. It is at first loaded down with cotton-like mycelia, at that point later ends up empty. The tops of dried natural product bodies will commonly stay white, while the stems will dry darker, particularly on the off chance that they are at first waterlogged. 

When they are seen in mass, for example, with a spore print, the spores seem white. Seeing with a light magnifying instrument uncovers extra subtleties: spores are ellipsoid, smooth, and measure 6Ã¢ÂÂ8 by 3.5Ã¢ÂÂ5Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m. They are light yellow in Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 42Ã¢ÂÂ52 by 608Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m, and four-spored. There are no pleurocystidia or cheilocystidia. The gill tissue is made of expanding hyphae about 7Ã¢ÂÂ12Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m wide. The top fingernail skin is made of thick, limited (3Ã¢ÂÂ6Ã¢Â Ã¢Ä¾m) hyphae which are apologize (twisted around) however commonly with some erect free closures. Cinch associations are available in the hyphae. 

The mushroom is eatable, despite the fact that it may not be speaking to numerous because of its foulness. In China, a yak milk refreshment is made with "H.Ã¢Â eburnus" and yak milk, by lactic corrosive maturation with "Lactobacillus bulgaricus", "Streptococcus thermophilus" and "Lactobacillus acidophilus" as blended starter. 

A twin types of "Hygrophorus eburneus" is "H.Ã¢Â piceae", which contrasts by having a less foul top, dry to somewhat viscid stem, and successive relationship with spruce. "H.Ã¢Â gliocyclus" is similarly as disgusting, however has a cream-shaded top, thicker stalk, and develops with pine. The "snow white waxy top" ("H.Ã¢Â borealis") is additionally comparative in appearance, yet has a littler top measurement of up to Ã¢ÂÂand isn't disgusting. "Hygrophorus cossus", which ordinarily develops with "Quercus" species, contrasts in its pale pinkish-buff top and gills, and has a particular harsh scent; additionally, "H.Ã¢Â cossus" does not have a potassium hydroxide response on the stem as does "H.Ã¢Â eburneus". The "white ooze mushroom" ("Limacella illinita") has non-waxy gills that are free from connection to the stalk. 

The natural product assortments of "H.Ã¢Â eburneus" develop on the dirt, for the most part in coniferous woods, shrubberies and green regions. The parasite lean towards soil that is sodden, mesic, loamy and calcareous. 

The growth is generally appropriated in North America. It is likewise found in Europe (Poland and Portugal), Israel and North Africa. 

A few unsaturated fats with bactericidal and fungicidal action have been segregated and recognized from the organic product groups of "H.Ã¢Â eburneus". The bioactive unsaturated fats are based upon a concoction structure called ÃÅ-oxocrotonate. The accompanying gamma-oxocrotonate subordinates have been distinguished from the mushroom: (2"E",9"E")- 4-oxooctadeca-2,9,17-trienoic corrosive, (2"E",11"Z")- 4-oxooctadeca-2,11,17-trienoic corrosive, ("E")- 4-oxohexadeca-2,15-dienoic corrosive, ("E")- 4-oxooctadeca-2,17-dienoic corrosive, (2"E",9"E")- 4-oxooctadeca-2,9-dienoic corrosive, (2"E",11"Z")- 4-oxooctadeca-2,11-dienoic corrosive, ("E")- 4-oxohexadec-2-enoic corrosive, and ("E")- 4-oxooctadec-2-enoic corrosive. The compound ("E")- 4-oxohexadec-2-enoic corrosive has been examined for potential use as a fungicide against the oomycete species "Phytophthora infestans", a causal specialist of potato and tomato late scourge sickness. 

Extra optional metabolites found in "H.Ã¢Â eburneus" incorporate the ceramide compound named "hygrophamide" ((2"S",3"R",4"R",2Ã¢ÂÂ"R")- 2-(2Ã¢ÂÂ-hydroxy-9Ã¢ÂÂ"Z"- ene-tetracosanoylamino)- octadecane-1,3,4-triol), and the ÃË-carboline alkaloids known as "harmane" and "norharmane". The report of disclosure of the last two mixes in 2008 speaks to their first known event in parasitic natural product bodies.
