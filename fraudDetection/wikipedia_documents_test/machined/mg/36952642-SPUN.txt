Mycena chlorophos 

Mycena chlorophos is a types of agaric parasite in the family Mycenaceae. First depicted in 1860, the organism is found in subtropical Asia, including Japan, Taiwan, Polynesia, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka, in Australia, and Brazil. Natural product bodies (mushrooms) have pale earthy dim sticky tops up to in width on stems long and up to a millimeter thick. The mushrooms are bioluminescent and produce a light green light. Fruiting happens in woodlands on fallen woody trash, for example, dead twigs, branches, and logs. The organism can be made to develop and natural product in lab conditions, and the development conditions influencing bioluminescence have been examined. 

The species was first depicted deductively by Miles Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis in 1860 as "Agaricus chlorophos". The first examples were gathered from the Bonin Islands by American botanist Charles Wright in October 1854 as a component of the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition of 1853Ã¢ÂÂ56. Dock Andrea Saccardo exchanged the species to the family "Mycena" in a 1887 production. Daniel Desjardin and associates redescribed the species and set a lectotype example in 2010. 

In 1860 Berkeley and Curtis portrayed the species "Agaricus cyanophos" from material likewise gathered from the Bonin Islands. This material was found close to the area that the first examples of "M.Ã¢Â chlorophos" were found, however two or after three weeks. Japanese mycologists Seiya Ito and Sanshi Imai examined these accumulations in the late 1930s, and inferred that "Agaricus cyanophos" was indistinguishable species from "M.Ã¢Â chlorophos", in spite of contrasts fit as a fiddle, gill connection, and the shade of discharged light. Desjardin and associates concurred with this assurance subsequent to inspecting the sort material of both taxa. "M.Ã¢Â chlorophos" is arranged in the segment "Exornatae" of the class "Mycena". Other luminescent species in this segment are "M.Ã¢Â discobasis" and "M.Ã¢Â marginata". A few creators have considered "M.Ã¢Â illuminans" to be synonymous with "M.Ã¢Â chlorophos" because of their morphological similitude, however sub-atomic examination has demonstrated that they are unmistakable species. 

In Japan, the mushroom is known as "yakoh-take", or "night-light mushroom". In the Bonin Islands it is designated "Green Pepe". 

The top is at first arched before smoothing out (now and again shaping a focal misery), and measures up to in breadth. The top has spiral scores reaching out to almost the inside, and some of the time creates splits in the edge, which has little adjusted teeth. Its shading is pale tanish dark that blurs after development, and it is to some degree sticky. The white stem is long by 0.3Ã¢ÂÂ1Ã¢Â mm thick, empty, and translucent. It has small hairs superficially. The base of the stem is circle molded or to some degree bulbous, estimating 1Ã¢ÂÂ2.5Ã¢Â mm wide. The slender gills are free from connection to the stem, or are adnexed (barely appended) to a slight neckline circling the stem. At first white then grayish in shading, they are fairly packed, with 17Ã¢ÂÂ32 full-length gills and 1 to 3 levels of lamellulae (shorter gills that don't broaden completely from the top edge to the stem). The gills are 0.3Ã¢ÂÂ1Ã¢Â mm wide with micaceous edges. The tissue is slim, and has a solid scent of smelling salts. Both the tops and the gills are bioluminescent, while the mycelia and stems have next to zero radiance. 

The spores are white, smooth, generally circular, and have measurements of 7Ã¢ÂÂ8.5 by 5Ã¢ÂÂ6Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 17Ã¢ÂÂ23 by 7.5Ã¢ÂÂ10Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm, and four-spored with sterigmata around 3 ÃÅºm long. The paraphyses are 5Ã¢ÂÂ8Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm wide, shorter than the basidia, progressively plenteous and structure a to some degree coagulated layer. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the top edge) are 60 by 7Ã¢ÂÂ21Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm, hyaline, funnel shaped or ventricose (expanded). The tips of the cheilocystidia are attracted out to a point, or have a short limb estimating 15 by 2Ã¢ÂÂ3Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm, which is once in a while fanned, and is meager or marginally thick-walled. There are no cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia). Pileocystidia (cystidia on the outside of the top) are club-molded, estimating 25Ã¢ÂÂ60 by 13Ã¢ÂÂ25Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm. They are to some degree thick-walled, and prickly on the uncovered surface with short straightforward outgrowths stretching out up to 3Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm long. The pileocystidia are combined and structure a consistent layer over the youthful top, yet separate as the top extends. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are funnel shaped or spear molded, hyaline, and smooth, with dividers that are slim or somewhat thickened. They measure up to 300 by 10Ã¢ÂÂ25Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm, yet are shorter in the upper locales of the stem. Brace associations are available in the hyphae all things considered. 

The two other luminescent types of "Mycena" segment "Exornatae" are comparable in appearance to "M.Ã¢Â chlorophos". "M.Ã¢Â discobasis" natural product bodies have paler tops; minutely, they have bigger spores estimating 9.9 by 6.7Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm, and do not have the short apical member found on "M.Ã¢Â chlorophos" cheilocystidia. "M.Ã¢Â margarita" has littler spores averaging 6.9 by 4.4Ã¢Â Ã®Åºm, littler cheilocystidia, and circle like brace associations. 

Natural product assemblages of "Mycena chlorophos" are found in timberlands, where they develop in gatherings on woody flotsam and jetsam, for example, fallen twigs, branches, and bark. In the Japanese Hachijo and Bonin Islands, mushrooms happen transcendently on rotting petioles of the palm "Phenix roeberenii". The parasite requires a legitimate scope of dampness to frame mushrooms; for instance, on Hachijo Island, fruiting just happens in the stormy seasons in June/July and September/October when the relative mugginess is around 88%, for the most part the day after downpour falls. Exploratory investigations have demonstrated that mushroom primordia that are too wet turned out to be twisted, while conditions that are too dry reason the tops to twist and break in light of the fact that the fragile coagulated layer covering them is broken. 

In Asia, the species has been found in Japan, Taiwan, Polynesia, Java, and Sri Lanka. In Japan, the growth is winding up progressively rare as its common propensities are diminishing. A few Australian field guides have announced the species from that nation. The parasite has likewise been recorded a few times from Brazil. "Mycena chlorophos" was one of a few growths highlighted in a lot of postage stamps issued in Samoa in 1985. 

Since the mushroom is little, and natural products in just a restricted season in a little region, scientists have examined the conditions expected to falsely develop the species in research facility conditions, so as to have progressively material to ponder the component of bioluminescence, and to help safeguard the species. The ideal temperature for the development of mycelia is , while the ideal for the development of primordia is . These temperatures are steady with the subtropical atmosphere in which the species is commonly found. Most extreme radiance happens at 27ÃÂ ÃÂ°C, and about 25Ã¢ÂÂ39Ã¢Â hours after the primordia start to shape, when the top has completely extended. At 21ÃÂ ÃÂ°C, radiance endures for about 3Ã¢Â days, and winds up imperceptible to the bare eyes about 72Ã¢Â hours after primordium inception.
