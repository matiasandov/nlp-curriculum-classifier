1976 Canada Cup 

The 1976 Canada Cup was a worldwide ice hockey competition held September 2Ã¢ÂÂ15, 1976, in Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg and Quebec City, Canada just as in Philadelphia, United States. It was the first of five Canada Cup competitions held somewhere in the range of 1976 and 1991, sorted out by Alan Eagleson, and authorized by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), Hockey Canada and the National Hockey League (NHL). 

The six-group, round robin competition finished with a best-of-three last between the best two groups. Canada completed on the standings and vanquished Czechoslovakia in the last in two successive recreations. Bobby Orr was named the most significant player of the competition, and Viktor Zhluktov was the main scorer. 

The Canada Cup was the primary genuine best-on-best big showdown in hockey history as it enabled any player to speak to their group paying little heed to novice or expert status. The hockey was both energizing and engaging, with one of the recreations being announced "best round ever" by fans. Bobby Orr and Lanny MacDonald both asserted that triumphant the Canada Cup was more critical to them than their Stanley Cup wins. Thus, it denoted the finish of Canada's six-year blacklist of the IIHF. The accomplishment of the occasion made ready for more noteworthy utilization of expert players in the World Championship and Winter Olympics. 

The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) had whined for a considerable length of time that Team Canada confronted an aggressive weakness in universal competitions as it was limited from utilizing its best players, who were experts in the National Hockey League (NHL), while European groups veiled the status of their best players. The issue reached a critical stage in 1970 when International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) president Bunny Ahearne reneged on a guarantee to enable each group to utilize something like nine expert players at the 1970 World Championship. Accordingly, the CAHA pulled back Canada from all global challenge until the IIHF gave it the privilege to utilize its best players as the European groups could. 

Around a similar time, talks were started to hold a neighborly competition between Canada's top players and the Soviet national group. These discussions finished in the Summit Series in 1972 that was barely guaranteed by Canada's NHL all-stars. A second Summit Series in 1974 saw the Soviets effectively rout the World Hockey Association's (WHA) top all-stars, however the two arrangement made interest for a genuine best-on-best big showdown. It was amid the 1974 Summit Series that National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) official executive Alan Eagleson started exchanges with Soviet and European specialists to make such a competition. The dealings, which developed to incorporate the IIHF and Hockey Canada and endured more than two years, brought about various understandings: Canada would come back to universal challenge in 1977, the World Championships moved to an open configuration that enabled experts to play and club groups of the Soviet League would visit North America and face NHL groups in what turned into the Super Series. The key understanding was the formation of the Canada Cup, to be held in 1976. 

Having increased global endorsement, Eagleson then persuaded the NHLPA's players to help the competition with guarantees of expanded annuity commitments coming about because of their investment. The NHL's proprietors bolstered the idea in the wake of concurring that half of the returns from the diversions would go to them. A few groups stayed uneasy, nonetheless. The Philadelphia Flyers were apprehensive their players may endure wounds in the competition and promised that no player from their program would be allowed to play. They were persuaded to withdraw on their dangers subsequent to being guaranteed two recreations would be played in Philadelphia with the Flyers accepting a lot of the income. In spite of the fact that the competition was held in September so as not to meddle with the NHL season, association president Clarence Campbell stayed distrustful of the competition's suitability, calling it "inefficient". 

Six groups contended in the 1976 Canada Cup. Canada was favored to win as they had brought what was contended to be the most grounded group in the country's history to the competition Ã¢ÂÂ 18 of the 25 players on the program would later be chosen into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Looking for its most ideal list, the Canadian group set aside the harsh contention between the NHL and WHA, choosing players from the two alliances, however for the most part from the NHL (Winnipeg Jets winger Bobby Hull was the main WHA player to skate in the competition, while Cleveland Crusaders defenseman Paul Shmyr took an interest in preparing camp as it were). Bobby Orr, tormented by developing knee issues almost turned down the welcome to play before reexamining, while goaltender Rogatien Vachon, who was not at first welcome to join the group, ended up playing each moment in the Canadian objective. 

While the fans sought after a Canada-Soviet Union last, experts positioned the Soviets as just the fourth best group entering the competition. They left the greater part of their first class players home for reasons that stay indistinct. The capability of rebellions, or losing stars to North American expert hockey, are two conceivable outcomes. Formally, Soviet authorities said huge numbers of their players were experiencing weariness, however goaltender Vladislav Tretiak later asserted the exclusions were the consequence of a power battle between Olympic mentor Boris Kulagin and Canada Cup group mentor Viktor Tikhonov and that the previous looked to undermine the last by compelling him to mentor a more fragile group. 

The Soviets made light of the significance of the competition, expressing their actual center was the World Championships and the Winter Olympics. Accordingly, they sent an a lot more youthful, "exploratory" group to Canada. Valeri Kharlamov, considered by numerous individuals to be their best forward, additionally did not play in the arrangement, as he was recuperating from genuine wounds endured in an auto collision. 

The Czechoslovak group was anticipated to confront Canada in the last by most specialists as they brought a similar group that won the 1976 World Championship a couple of months earlier. Their goaltender, JiÄºÂÄÂ­ HoleÃ¤Âek, was viewed as the best on the planet outside the NHL. Czechoslovak mentor Karel Gut foreseen his group would develop to demonstrate the world that there was "more to worldwide hockey than Canada and the Soviet Union". Sweden was positioned third entering the competition and had a vast blend of novices and experts who were playing in the NHL and WHA. The United States and Finland adjusted the competition and were not expected to be aggressive. 

The competition opened in Ottawa on September 2 as Finland confronted a Canadian group concentrated on keeping away from a feeling of lack of concern following thrashings against the Soviets in 1974 and 1975. Rick Martin scored a cap trap to lead Canada in a defeat of the Finns, 11Ã¢ÂÂ2. Sweden at that point crushed the United States, 5Ã¢ÂÂ2, on the quality of four first period strategic maneuver objectives. Swedish star BÄÅrje Salming, who played in the NHL for the Toronto Maple Leafs, was welcomed with a five-minute overwhelming applause by the Toronto swarm before the amusement. 

The third diversion included the title holder Czechoslovaks against the Olympic hero Soviets. Czechoslovakia defended pre-competition desires by winning 5Ã¢ÂÂ3 while the Soviets griped about the planning, asserting coordinators intentionally coordinated them facing the Czechoslovaks in their opening amusement to set them at an early detriment in the competition. The Soviet grumblings became more intense after a 3Ã¢ÂÂ3 tie against Sweden. While the Swedish press was hailing Salming as the best player in their country's history after his second back to back prevailing exertion, the Soviets took steps to stop the competition as they were disturbed about the administering of Canadian official Andre Legace. Coordinators did not take the Soviet dangers to stop the competition genuinely. 

The Czechoslovaks stayed prevailing, crushing the Finns 8Ã¢ÂÂ0 in an amusement where they out-shot their rival 49Ã¢ÂÂ15. Czechoslovak goaltender HoleÃ¤Âek recorded the primary shutout in the competition's history. The Finns were likewise annihilated by the Soviets, who did not pull back from the competition, by a 11Ã¢ÂÂ3 score. In the interim, the Americans, scrutinized in the media as being "group pointless" over their apparent absence of ability, earned a proportion of regard when they lost to Canada 4Ã¢ÂÂ2 in an amusement where the result was not sure until the last moment of play, at that point earned a 4Ã¢ÂÂ4 tie against the Czechoslovaks, and the regard of their mentor, in a diversion played at Philadelphia. 

A 4Ã¢ÂÂ0 misfortune to Canada pursued by a stunning 8Ã¢ÂÂ6 thrashing because of their Scandinavian opponent Finland disposed of Sweden from dispute. The Finns, who defeated a 4Ã¢ÂÂ1 shortage, felt the outcome vindicated their arrangement in the competition while the Swedes considered the outcome a shame. The Soviets stayed alive by overcoming the United States 5Ã¢ÂÂ0 in Philadelphia while Canada confronted the Czechoslovaks in the meantime in Montreal. The diversion included a goaltender fight between Canada's Rogatien Vachon and the Czechoslovak's VladimÄÂ­r Dzurilla and was quickly professed to be one of the best rounds ever. Milan NovÄË scored with under five minutes to play to lift the Czechoslovaks to a 1Ã¢ÂÂ0 triumph and guaranteed them a spot in the last. The outcome implied that the victor of the CanadaÃ¢ÂÂSoviet Union diversion would guarantee the second spot in the last. 

Three recreations denoted the last day of the round robin on September 11. The United States conquered a 2Ã¢ÂÂ0 shortfall to vanquish Finland 6Ã¢ÂÂ3 to complete fifth in the competition. American co-general administrator Tommy Ivan communicated his pride in his group's competition, and anticipated that this competition had set the phase for the United States to develop into a contender in hockey. The Swedes, in the interim, earned a 2Ã¢ÂÂ1 triumph over Czechoslovakia in a diversion that had no effect on the standings. 

While fans expected Canada and the Soviet Union would meet in the last, eventually, they squared off in an informal semi-last. The two groups played the amusement at an irate pace, exchanging objectives in a first period from which Canada rose with a 2Ã¢ÂÂ1 lead. Canada broadened their lead in the second time frame at that point depended on defenceman Bobby Orr's excellent play to hold off the Soviets and advance to the last. As they had before in the competition, the Soviets whined of one-sided administering assuming a job in the result of the diversion. 

The 1976 Canada Cup last was a best-of-three arrangement. The principal amusement was played September 13 at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto. The Czechoslovaks began Dzurilla in objective after his splendid presentation against Canada in the round robin. Dzurilla was unfit to copy his prosperity as Gilbert Perreault opened the scoring one moment into the diversion on the way to a four-objective assault by the Canadians in the primary time frame. The Czechoslovaks were more grounded in the last 40 minutes, however were unfit to beat Canada's Vachon, who recorded his second shutout of the competition in a 6Ã¢ÂÂ0 triumph for Canada. Amid the diversion, the Czechoslovaks were infuriated when Canada's Steve Shutt crosschecked JiÄºÂÄÂ­ NovÄÄk from behind. Novak endured a blackout and was unfit to play the rest of the arrangement. Shutt, an ability player of littler stature, was sorry after the diversion, guaranteeing he had not proposed to hit his rival in the design he did. 

Amusement two was played in the Montreal Forum on September 15. Jiri HoleÃ¤Âek, who supplanted Dzurilla in objective after the main time of the primary diversion, began amusement two for Czechoslovakia, while Vachon stayed in the Canadian net. As they had in the main diversion, Canada bounced out to an early lead, scoring two objectives in the initial three minutes of play. HoleÃ¤Âek was immediately pulled and supplanted with Dzurilla, who finished the diversion. The Czechoslovaks answered with a second time frame objective and another right off the bat in the third to tie the diversion. Bobby Clarke restored the Canadian lead halfway through the period before Josef Augusta and MariÄÄn Ä¹Â ÄºÄ¾astnÄË scored objectives one moment separated to give Czechoslovakia its first lead, 4Ã¢ÂÂ3, with four minutes staying in the third time frame. Dzurilla was solid in net as the Canadians put 39 shots on objective in guideline time, however committed a basic error with under three minutes remaining. His endeavor to clear a puck from his zone went rather to Canada's Bill Barber, who scored into an open net to tie the diversion and send it to additional time. 

The groups played an extreme extra time period loaded up with start to finish surges and splendid spares by the goaltenders. At a certain point, Canada's Guy Lafleur put a shot on net that snuck through the Czechoslovak goaltender, however Ivan Hlinka purposely pushed the net strange before the puck went too far. He got a deferral of diversion punishment, however avoided a Canadian win. A couple of minutes after the fact, Guy Lapointe rifled a low shot that again beat Dzurilla, anyway this objective was likewise denied as the bell had sounded to end the initial ten-minutes of the extra time frame one-tenth of a second prior to it went too far. Universal principles of the time directed that play was to be ceased at the ten-minute sign of every extra time period and the groups would switch the side of the ice they safeguarded. Amid the break, Canadian partner mentor Don Cherry noted to his group that Dzurilla frequently overcame much out of his net to safeguard and could be beaten on a shot from a sharp edge. 

Under two minutes into the second 50% of the additional time frame, Darryl Sittler got a pass 

from Marcel Dionne as he skated into the Czechoslovak zone near the side sheets. As Dzurilla turned out to challenge, Sittler faked a shot that solidified the goaltender, took two additional steps at that point discharged the puck into an open net. The objective contacted off a wild festival among the Canadian players on the ice and the fans in the stands. Sittler's title winning objective stays a standout amongst the most well known in hockey history. Amid the festivals, the players of the two groups exchanged garbs; Bobby Orr was given the Most Valuable Player grant while wearing a Czechoslovak shirt. Leader Pierre Trudeau introduced Canadian skipper Bobby Clarke with the Canada Cup.
