On 3 July 1939, Waddy was charged into the Somerset Light Infantry as a second lieutenant and sent to India two months after the fact with the first Battalion, at that point directed by Lieutenant Colonel John Harding. In the wake of going from Taunton to Scotland he cruised from Britain around the same time that Britain proclaimed war on Germany. He was elevated to acting, at that point brief, chief from September 1940, and substantive lieutenant on 3 January 1941. His time in India, be that as it may, was for the most part gone through on activities with minimal possibility of activity. Edgy to leave, Waddy effectively volunteered for another British Parachute Battalion when the shot came in August 1941, and in October joined the 151st Parachute Battalion as their insight officer. Parachuting was simple in India and preparing hops were produced using Vickers Valentia biplanes. He fit the bill for his hop wings around the same time that Japan assaulted Pearl Harbor, albeit just two months after the fact he was almost killed in a preparation hop and went through three days in a trance like state. 

In October 1942 the force was sent to North Africa and re-assigned 156th Parachute Battalion, where it turned into the focal unit of the new fourth Parachute Brigade, framed in December. Waddy was quickly made assistant of the legion, however immediately climbed to the post of the fourth Brigade's Intelligence Officer. The detachment moved from Egypt to Palestine in February 1943, and to Tunisia in June where it joined the first Airborne Division, at that point told by Major General George Hopkinson. Waddy reviewed that the presentation of the now well known maroon beret was especially disagreeable with the 156th Battalion, who had recently worn shrubbery caps. The fourth Brigade did not participate in the Allied intrusion of Sicily yet on 5 September the entire Division cruised to Taranto in Italy (Operation Slapstick), effectively catching the port with 156th Battalion and detachment HQ in the vanguard. 

The division propelled northwards over the coming weeks, gradually seeking after the first German Parachute Division. In one activity Waddy found an Italian 179mm Howitzer which he used to scatter Germans social occasion to counterattack the 156th Battalion's positions, terminating through open sights at a structure in the focal point of their front. Waddy was elevated to acting major in October and assumed responsibility for the 156th Battalion's B Company, a month prior to the first Airborne Division was pulled back and cruised back to the United Kingdom, touching base there in December. On 24 January 1944, he was made a war substantive commander and brief major. 

first Airborne Division's next sending was in September 1944 amid Operation Market Garden. The Allies wanted to utilize airborne powers to verify key extensions over various streams and trenches in the Netherlands, opening a course around the Seigfried Line and into the core of Germany. first Airborne Division was entrusted with verifying scaffolds over the Lower Rhine at Arnhem and fourth Parachute Brigade was nitty gritty to involve the northern methodologies of the city in case of a counterattack by German powers. The detachment was planned to touch base on the second day of the activity, 18 September, utilizing drop zones secured by components of first Airlanding Brigade. In the occasion, ground fog in England implied that the second lift was postponed by four hours, which saved the Dakota transport flying machine from gathering Luftwaffe warriors over the drop zone. By the by, the flying machine experienced impressive enemy of air ship fire as they moved toward the drop zone. Waddy later reviewed that his air ship was so close to the ground that he could see the upturned essences of the German firearm teams. He watched various fire blasts and watched the escorting Hawker Typhoon contenders assaulting fire batteries as they moved toward the DZ. His own flying machine was hit in the tail however the pilot proceeded to the drop zone where, in spite of awful yawing, Waddy and his men had the capacity to bounce. The paratroopers went under little arms fire coordinated at the air ship's entryways as they left the air ship and parachuted under substantial flame onto Ginkel Heath. Waddy's signaller lost his radio as he hopped behind him; the cumbersome gear was hit by a round the minute he bounced out of the Dakota. 

On the ground an angry skipper, who had expected the men four hours sooner, disclosed to a stunned Waddy the quickly breaking down circumstance on the ground. With eleventh Parachute Battalion despatched to Arnhem and tenth Parachute Battalion safeguarding the injured on the drop zone, just 156th Battalion was allowed to move. At about 5pm they got off along the Utrecht-Arnhem railroad and met their lightweight plane borne components at Wolfheze just before being strafed by a German warrior. Drawing closer Oosterbeek they experienced German Panzer troops and halted through the evening. 

Toward the beginning of the day, crisp requests were issued to lead the fourth Brigade to one side flank of first Parachute Brigade. B Company were requested to give supporting flame from the flanks of A Company's development, which they effectively did before coming back to unit HQ and following up the development. Lieutenant Colonel Sir Richard des Voeux requested Waddy to take B Company through A Company's positions and proceed with the development to the high ground, trusting that there was very little resistance. Actually A Company had been about annihilated, and Waddy passed various bodies on his way forward. As the organization propelled, they were held up by what Waddy accepts was a twin barrelled 20mm fire firearm. He drove a little gathering to assault it, however was spotted by a German expert rifleman as they pushed ahead. A friend was slaughtered right away and Waddy, without his automatic rifle, could just discharge inadequately with his gun. The expert sharpshooter shot him in the crotch and endeavored to hit him again as he crept away, compelling Waddy to lay doggo for a minute prior to one of his men, a tall Rhodesian warrior, conveyed him back to Company HQ. Looked with a substantial grouping of adversary protective layer, the assault slowed down and was then canceled; the unit had taken such overwhelming setbacks that it was diminished to the extent of what was basically a solitary organization. 

At the Regimental Aid Post, Waddy found that the specialists did not rate his odds especially very; the 156 Battalion's war journal even recorded that "B Company officer was lethally injured". He was taken alongside a Field Ambulance present and from that point on the Tafelburg inn in Oosterbeek, presently being utilized as a Main Dressing Station. Here he was worked on in the inn's pool room where Major Guy Rigby Jones utilized the billiard table to perform medical procedure. Multi day later he was moved to a house inverse as the quantity of losses expanded. Since the guide stations were in the bleeding edges of the Oosterbeek edge, they went under consistent flame and he was injured twice more. A mortar round shell part held up in his left foot, and a later hit caused fragment wounds to his face and shoulder. On another event, as the fight wavered around the guide post, Germans involved his structure. A British sharpshooter shot a German shooter, inciting a German sergeant to address the British about shooting at a Red Cross house. At the point when the house burst into flames he was taken outside and headed to an accumulation point from where German doctors took him to Apeldoorn. 

Waddy went through the following a month and a half in a German emergency clinic in Apeldoorn. Indeed the British patients were addressed about terminating at the Red Cross after a Spitfire strafed the working theater, however generally speaking Waddy was awed by the graciousness of the German staff and protects. He barely abstained from having his foot cut away when a medical caretaker evacuated the fragment installed in it with a couple of forceps, and once he had adequately recouped from his injuries he was taken to Stalag VII-A where he stayed until the camp was freed toward the finish of April 1945. 

Waddy stayed in the military after the war finished and joined the HQ of third Parachute Brigade before being sent to Palestine in September 1945. After a month he joined ninth Battalion managing the Jewish psychological militant danger and in July 1947 he was injured by and by, this time by individuals from the IZL. Since the Parachute Regiment was not permitted to select officers for longer than three years, Waddy was posted in March 1948, after right around seven years with the regiment. He went through the following four years in staff posts, at first in Greece, at that point Taunton where he moved toward becoming GSO 3 for 43rd (Wessex) Division.

He went through a year in the nation amid the Malayan Emergency and was Mentioned in Despatches. 

Coming back from Malaya, Waddy invested energy at RAF Staff College and as a preparation major for the Somerset Light Infantry Territorial Army Battalion.

In 1958 the Parachute Regiment was permitted to keep its own officers and Waddy quickly connected. He was presented on Jordan and afterward Cyprus as 2IC of second Battalion, an encounter he compared to being back with family. In 1960 he was elevated to lieutenant colonel and presented on Aldershot to order the Depot The Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces amid which time he built up the Parachute Regiment Battle Camp at Brecon, which later advanced into the Infantry Battle School. In 1962 he came boss educator at a little arms school in Hythe. In the 1963 New Year Honors he was named Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his direction of the terminal.

At the point when creation of the film "A Bridge Too Far" started in 1975, Waddy was given a half year leave by Westland to go about as boss Military Advisor, an arrangement that John Frost thought was perfect. Waddy was in charge of preparing "Attenborough's Private Army", a gathering of fifty men who experienced training camp so as to depict Frost's men at Arnhem Bridge and give the foundation of the additional cast. Waddy admitted to being profoundly worried by the performing artists' quality at first, yet had the capacity to transform them into men who looked and acted the part. 

In spite of the fact that there was little that Waddy or his kindred military specialists (who included Frost, Roy Urquhart, James M. Gavin, Brian Horrocks and J.O.E. Vandeleur) could do to incredibly impact the film's content, he had the capacity to guarantee that a few sections were kept truly exact. By method for saying thanks to him subsequent to getting some guidance, Edward Fox alluded to his driver as Waddy in his first scene in the motion picture, and he had a concise appearance in one of the film's last scenes. 

Alongside numerous veterans, Waddy has come back to Arnhem habitually. When visiting in 1954 he was given a harmed silver cigarette case bearing his surname.
