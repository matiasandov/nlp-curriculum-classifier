The course for the race was reported on 27 March 2012. 

The DauphinÄÅ¡ started with its customary short individual time preliminary stage, with a close level course around the lanes of Grenoble; the city was facilitating the introduction of the race for the fourth time in fifteen years following earlier begins in 1997, 2000 and 2007, the remainder of which was won by the 2011 race victor Bradley Wiggins, at that point riding for the group. With downpour expected to disturb the stage, as it had done as such in the 2011 introduction, groups chose to spread their time preliminary authorities over the field so as to augment their capability of winning the stage. For the main rider to leave the begin in Grenoble, 's Lieuwe Westra, climate conditions were dry. Westra at last recorded a period of 6' 46" for the stage, which was adequate for a main 12 organize putting after every one of the 175 riders had taken to the course. Westra's time was beaten in a matter of seconds a while later by rider Carlos Barredo, who went four seconds snappier around the course, long. 

Barredo held the top spot for around quarter of 60 minutes, as his time was barely beaten by Andriy Hryvko, a four-time Ukrainian victor in the order, riding for the group. Before long, the possible stage-winning execution was recorded by the Australian national hero Luke Durbridge, for . Durbridge set a period of 6' 38", in the good conditions; he clutched his spot all through the normal variable climate that was a factor in the rest of the running request. Following a downpour shower that affected the hustling amid the center segment of the stage, the later riders to take to the course had dry streets to fight with however the breeze had gotten and made conditions more troublesome than what the prior riders had for their entries through the parcours. Durbridge's time stayed untroubled as far as possible, notwithstanding the best endeavors of safeguarding champion Wiggins, who completed simply 1.35 seconds falling behind financially in second spot, having begun last of the 175 contenders. Subsequently, Durbridge took his first stage triumph at World Tour level, which gave him a decisive victory of the shirts post-arrange, for holding the lead of the generally speaking, focuses and youthful rider groupings. Other by and large contenders Tejay van Garderen (), 's Tony Martin, JÄÅ¡rÄ'me Coppel (), just as van Garderen's partner Cadel Evans and 2010 champ Janez BrajkoviÃ¤Â () all lost time in contrast with Wiggins; Martin put best in fifth position, in spite of the fact that Evans likewise made the best ten, in ninth spot. 

With no less than six sorted trips amid the parcours, the principal mass-begin organize was not preferably fit towards the sprinters, however was ideal towards puncheurs, as the last of the six climbsÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ the third-class "CÄ'te de la Sizeranne"Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ came just from the stage's completion in Saint-Vallier. Six ridersÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ Giovanni Bernaudeau (), rider Markel Irizar, 's Maarten Tjallingii, Nicolas Edet of , Sep Vanmarcke () and rider Yukihiro DoiÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ propelled clear of the primary field in the early running of the stage; the sextet figured out how to stretch out their leeway to a limit of more than thirteen minutes around a fourth of the path through the stage. Around a similar point, an accident including Pierrick FÄÅ¡drigo () and Samuel SÄÄnchez () cut the two riders down. Neither one of the riders came back to the fundamental gathering, as FÄÅ¡drigo lost more than six minutes and SÄÄnchez right around multiple times that; losing very nearly 24 minutes, after reports that he had been enduring with broken ribs. He was taken to medical clinic after the stage, where he was determined to have wounded ribs. 

The groups of a few of the general characterization contenders were predominant on the facade of the peloton as they start decreasing the preferred standpoint that the breakaway gathering of six riders were holding over them. The hole had been diminished to around the three-minute imprint with left of the phase to cover. Another enormous accident happened some later with 's Simon Gerrans, rider Pim Ligthart and Dan Martin of among those to hit the landing area. pushed ahead, and pulled the hole under two minutes and made the breakaway fragment through weight. BernaudeauÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ who had figured at every one of the mountain goes to the pointÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ and Doi neglected to remain with their allies as they moved toward the day's last ascension, the "CÄ'te de la Sizeranne". Tjallingii was additionally dropped by the rest of the individuals from the breakaway, while in the primary field, Alexander Vinokourov () and Andy Schleck of ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ who had been scrutinized by group supervisor Johan Bruyneel for his poor opening half to the seasonÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ were both battling off the back of the gathering. The two riders lost more than three minutes by the stage end. 

As the lead bunch moved toward the highest point of the "CÄ'te de la Sizeranne", Irizar assaulted from the gathering of the staying three breakaway riders, while Vanmarcke and Edet were joined by rider Pierre Rolland, who had gotten away from the limits of the principle bunch itself. Another three-rider move went advances from the peloton as Rolland's colleague Cyril Gautier, 's Luis LeÄÅn SÄÄnchez and rider Philippe Gilbert got clear by a few seconds. Irizar held a thin preferred standpoint, yet overshot a corner and was in the long run gotten with around to go. As Irizar was gotten, JÄÅ¡rÄ'me Coppel of counter-assaulted, and was in the end joined by Cadel EvansÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ a colleague of Gilbert at ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ and 's Andrey Kashechkin, who completed third in the race in 2007. The trio figured out how to hold off the end peloton into the completion, where Evans figured out how to battle off the advances of Coppel and Kashechkin to make that big appearance win. rider Nacer Bouhanni drove home the peloton only four seconds financially past due, and with race pioneer Luke Durbridge () not highlighting in the split peloton, Bradley Wiggins expected the race lead for ; Evans climbed to second, one moment behind Wiggins. 

Much the same as the earlier day's stage, the second phase of the race additionally included six sorted ascensions, stuffed into the course through the ArdÄÂ¨che district, with the most noteworthy point coming at the summit of the second-class "Col de Montivernoux". The completion in Saint-FÄÅ¡licien came toward the finish of a trip, which would pretty much standard out the sprinters more clearly than the principal arrange parcours. rider RÄÅ¡mi Pauriol and 's Maxime MÄÅ¡derel broke clear of the peloton in the opening stages, and they were in this manner joined by a gathering which contained various by and large race contenders including "maillot jaune et bleu" wearer Bradley Wiggins (), Vincenzo Nibali of and rider Sylvain Chavanel. The gathering was in the long run reabsorbed again into the fundamental gathering after around of dashing. 

After a time of dependability inside the principle gathering, a four-rider move comprising of three French ridersÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ David MoncoutiÄÅ¡ speaking to , Blel Kadri of and 's Christophe Kern, who won a phase amid the 2011 raceÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ just as Colombia's Cayetano Sarmiento, riding for the group, propelled clear of the field and immediately settled leverage over them; of those, Kadri was best-put at only eleven seconds behind Wiggins preceding the stage. marshaled the front of the peloton therefore, not letting the hole more than four minutes anytime. Behind, there were a few moves with the end goal for riders to connect a hole between the principle field and the pioneers; at the "Col de Lalouvesc" with to go, the pioneers just held a hole of around a large portion of a moment over their chasers. Five riders endeavored to do as such, however just a solitary one had the capacity to remain in the middle of the breakaway and the peloton. 

's Anthony Roux was the rider being referred to, and he set off after the group of four in advance, and had the capacity to contact them with around staying of the stage. In any case, the peloton was not a long ways behind, and the breakaway did not last any longer after that. With the field back together, a few riders endeavored solo gets off the front of the peloton, including Kadri's partner MickaÄÅ¥l Cherel, yet all were ineffective. The gathering stayed together into the move towards the completion; and headed the gathering, securing their principle riders Nibali and Cadel Evans from any potential inconvenience. World time preliminary boss Tony Martin attempted to get clear inside the last kilometer for however couldn't continue a hole over every other person, and rider Daniel Moreno planned his run splendidly, to take his third win of the period, in front of French pair Julien Simon () and 's Tony Gallopin. Wiggins completed ninth to keep up his one-moment in general lead over Evans, who was seventh. 

With a long individual time preliminary and three precipitous stages left amid the schedule, the third stage was charged as the sprinters' one staying chance at a phase triumph at the DauphinÄÅ¡. All things considered, the parcours of the stage fit them; despite the fact that there were three classified ascensions amid the stageÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ a third-classification climb and two fourth-classification passesÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ they were all inside the main portion of the stage. Two ridersÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ Spanish blending Luis ÄÂngel MatÄÅ¡ of and rider Egoi MartÄÂ­nezÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ went clear very quickly after the beginning of the stage, making the early breakaway from the field, and the pair figured out how to broaden their preference over the primary field to around five-and-a-half minutes, inside the first of the stage. Behind the lead pair, 's Giovanni Bernaudeau was the primary rider from the peloton to cross the fourth-classification ascends, and recovered the lead of the mountains order from rider Blel Kadri. 

Not at all like the third stage time preliminary in 2011, in which the course utilized in Grenoble to a great extent set the course for the penultimate-day time preliminary in the Tour de France a month later, the time preliminary in the 2012 occasion was hung on an autonomous course, running from west-to-east between VilliÄÅ¡-Morgon and Bourg-en-Bresse, with an undulating parcours that just added up to a distinction in height all the way. As was standard of time preliminary stages, the riders set off backward request from where they were positioned in the general grouping toward the finish of the past stage. Consequently, Arnaud GÄÅ¡rard of , who, in 172nd placeÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ of the 175 startersÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ trailed generally speaking pioneer Bradley Wiggins () by thirty minutes and forty-nine seconds, was the primary rider to set off on the stage. In any case, he was not the first to complete as he was passed by the two riders straightforwardly behind him on the begin request, that began at one-minute interims, Dan Martin of and 's Travis Meyer. 

Meyer recorded a period of 60 minutes, seven minutes and fifty seconds as he was first to achieve the line; his time held for around a fourth of 60 minutes, as no rider could get inside twenty seconds of his time, until his partner Luke Durbridge, the preamble victor and officeholder under-23 world time preliminary boss crossed the end goal in a period of 60 minutes, four minutes and forty-nine seconds, a little more than three minutes faster than Meyer. Durbridge's time held top spot for more than two hours, as most of the field neglected to coordinate his time for the course. It was not until Wilco Kelderman of the teamÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ beginning 143rd instead of Durbridge beginning 19thÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ had set snappier occasions at every one of the middle of the road timing focuses that Durbridge's opportunity arrived under danger from another rider, and Kelderman at last beat Durbridge's time by twelve seconds, regardless of nearly overshooting the last corner, barely dodging the boundaries outwardly of the corner. Toward the finish of the stage, Kelderman expressed that his execution came as "an astonishment", leading the pack of the youthful rider arrangement from Tony Gallopin () all the while. 

The first of four riders to begin inside the last twenty-five riders, Chris Froome got inside eight seconds of Kelderman's time, however it was not until one more of the group's riders, Michael Rogers, that the lead changed hands. In spite of the fact that he trailed at the primary middle of the road point, Rogers upgraded the season of Kelderman toward the wrap up by fourteen seconds; he held the lead into the last five starters, where it was then required by the world investment preliminary victor Tony Martin, riding for the group. Martin bettered the season of Rogers by 37 seconds, however it was not to last as Wiggins was establishing his general lead. Wiggins made up a shortage of seven seconds to Martin at the primary middle of the road point, and transformed it into a 36-second lead in the space of , in the end making that big appearance triumph by 34 seconds over Martin. Such was Wiggins' execution, which he later esteemed "fulfilling", that he was practically getting Cadel Evans () out and about, notwithstanding Evans beginning two minutes before Wiggins; Evans eventually completed the phase in eighth position, 1' 43" down on Wiggins' time. rider Andy Schleck, one more of the general contenders for the Tour de France alongside Evans and Wiggins, lost more than ten minutes to Wiggins on the phase after an accident and a cut. 

The first of three rocky stages to finish up the DauphinÄÅ¡, the fifth phase of the race was viewed as a forerunner to the tenth phase of July's Tour de France, with most of the day's course making up the parcours of that phase to be hung on 11 July. Three ordered trips were a piece of the parcours of the day, eminently the hors catÄÅ¡gorie "Le Grand Colombier"Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ making its dÄÅ¡but in the raceÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ with a normal angle of 6.9%, coming to up to a height of , yet the summit of the last climbÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ the "Col de Richemond"Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ accompanied surviving from the stage. Small scale assaults set the course of the early running of the stage, which was done a speedy pace, with the peloton covering in the primary hour of hustling. After rider Blel Kadri got away out of the peloton to take the distinctions at the principal summit of the day, the "CÄ'te de Corlier", it was not until the uncategorised "Col de la Berche" a few kilometers later that a gathering of riders figured out how to get clear. 

An aggregate of ten riders went clear, and immediately accumulated a five-minute lead over the remainder of the field. At the foot of "Le Grand Colombier", another seven riders framed a pursuit bunch out and about in front of the peloton, which was later decreased to simply Christophe Kern () and Brice Feillu (), after Kern had increased the pace in the gathering. Now, Kern's partner KÄÅ¡vin Reza was dropped from the lead gathering, and the peloton itself had been thinned to around fifty riders, with Sylvain Chavanel () and David Millar ()ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ both in the best ten of the general characterization overnightÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ alongside 's Alexander Vinokourov among those that did not include inside the peloton. On the plummet from the trip, a gathering of riders including Cadel Evans, George Hincapie and Tejay van Garderen broke out from the peloton, in the expectation of pulling Evans closer the general lead of 's Bradley Wiggins, following his time misfortune the earlier day in the individual time preliminary. 

Having gotten Kern and Feillu out and about, the gathering lost ground to the peloton and with Wiggins later cooperating with the gathering, Evans' endeavors were futile; with the gathering currently back together all in all, their endeavors returned to the first break. Kern was a piece of another six-rider wave that went clear on the plunge from the "Col de Richemond", with the most elevated put rider being ninth-set Luis LeÄÅn SÄÄnchez of . took up station on the facade of the fundamental field, not permitting SÄÄnchez to pick up an excess of ground. The hole topped out at around the 30-second imprint and with no one hoping to help SÄÄnchez with the pace-production in the gathering, they sat up and permitted to be reabsorbed into the peloton. 's Arthur Vichot assaulted out of the lead bunch with around to go, and soloed far from his breakaway friends to take the triumph by 26 seconds from the remainder of the gathering. The peloton went too far around one moment down on Vichot, with Wiggins keeping up his 38-second in general lead as he was a piece of that gathering. 

The ruler phase of the 2012 DauphinÄÅ¡, the penultimate stage comprised of six ordered ascensions amid its parcours, the first coming after just with the primary class "Col de Plainpalais". After a couple of third-class passes, the field handled another first-classification climb, the "Col de la ColombiÄÂ¨re" accompanying surviving from the stage. Inside the last , the day's two residual ascensions were ascented; the third-class "CÄ'te de ChÄËtillon", and the race's second and last hors catÄÅ¡gorie move, with the "Col de Joux Plane"Ã¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ achieving a height of ÃÂ Ã¢ÂÂ being the beginning of the run-in towards Morzine, with the summit of the trip accompanying to go of the stage. 

Nineteen riders went clear of the peloton very quickly after the beginning of the stage; among those riders were the two warriors for the mountains grouping, Blel Kadri of and 's Cayetano Sarmiento. Sarmiento took out most extreme focuses at every one of the initial two ascensions, and in this manner broadened his focuses preference that he held over Kadri. With 's Tiago Machado being the best-put rider of the gathering at very nearly six minutes down on generally speaking pioneer Bradley Wiggins (), Wiggins' colleagues were driving the peloton around four minutes down on the lead gathering. rider Andriy Hryvko, who had been in the main three prior in the race, at that point joined the gathering in the wake of assaulting out the front of the peloton. 's Brice Feillu quickened out of the lead bunch on the "CÄ'te de ChÄËtillon", and before long grabbed a hole of over a moment in front of his previous breakaway partners, while the peloton had fallen somewhat further far from Feillu, as they were very nearly four-and-a-half minutes behind on the trip. 

Despite the fact that the stage was generally short at long, the parcours still highlighted five ordered climbsÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ of which one was to the completion in ChÄËtelÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ achieving its most elevated point with the principal class "Col du Corbier". Smaller than usual assaults set the course of the early running of the stage, with the field staying all in all for the main hour of hustling after the assaults were shut down inside minutes. It was not until 33% of the route through the stageÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ some inÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ that a move was permitted to be built up out and about, as rider Pierre Rolland, 's JÄÅ¡rÄ'me Coppel and Lieuwe Westra of quickened out of the peloton. They were later joined by five additional riders as blending Sylvain Chavanel and Stijn Vandenbergh, 's Dmitry Fofonov, Yaroslav Popovych of and Christophe Le MÄÅ¡vel speaking to the group gave some help to the breakaway move. 

Coppel was the best-set rider of the octet, as he was in fifteenth spot by and large medium-term around four-and-a-half minutes down on race pioneer Bradley Wiggins (); thusly, the breakaway's preference was not permitted to accumulate force and the hole stayed somewhere in the range of two and more than two minutes for most of the stage. permitted to complete the greater part of the work in the peloton, with Wiggins watching out for their rider Cadel Evans, who had made a late-race assault the earlier day and recovered time to Wiggins. Coppel, Westra and Rolland, the break initiators, at that point went clear again on the second-classification "CÄ'te de la Vernaz", however the peloton were all the while surrounding them, subsequent to pursuing down a gathering that had got clear on the ascension. Vincenzo Nibali () stayed off the front, and endeavored to shut down the pioneers. Rolland and Coppel dropped Westra on the plummet from the accompanying "Col du Corbier" climb, where he was in the end joined by Nibali, yet the performance move that he had put in was beginning to appear as he couldn't remain with Westra, and was in the end gotten by the - drove peloton with around remaining. 

Westra was gotten not long after that as the lead pair's favorable position was decreasing by the kilometer, as they held a half-minute lead into the last . 's Alexandre Geniez assaulted out of the principle gathering, and got his two comrades up the street however the breakaway was not to prevail as they were gotten with to go. took the front in the expectation of a second stage win for Daniel Moreno, yet Fabrice Jeandesboz assaulted in the last kilometer for yet was shut somewhere around Richie Porte, securing his group chief Wiggins. Moreno and 's Luis LeÄÅn SÄÄnchez combat it out for the stage respects, with Moreno defeating his comrade for the triumph. Wiggins went too far ten seconds behind the nine-man lead gathering, however was sufficiently adequate for a second back to back DauphinÄÅ¡ title by 1' 17" over partner Michael Rogers. Evans later expressed that he was beaten by "the better rider", yet stayed satisfied with his execution of third spot, a phase triumph and the focuses arrangement title. 

In the 2012 CritÄÅ¡rium du DauphinÄÅ¡, four diverse shirts were granted. For the general characterization, determined by including every cyclist's completing occasions each stage, the pioneer got a yellow shirt with a blue bar. This characterization was considered the most critical of the 2012 CritÄÅ¡rium du DauphinÄÅ¡, and the victor of the arrangement was viewed as the champ of the race.
