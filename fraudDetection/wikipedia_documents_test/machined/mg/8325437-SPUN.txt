In 1994, Brunner likewise spoken to neighbors of a grown-up video store that was being demolished to clear path for a McDonald's store in a well-off neighborhood. She got a 14-day limiting request to stop issuance of a zoning authentication and decimation and building licenses. The Bexley, OH neighborhood has the Ohio Governor's Mansion and houses once possessed by "Trickster" distributer Larry Flynt and The Limited executive Les Wexner. She got residents to show up before the zoning claims board to endeavor to stop the development. The Citizens were ineffective in persuading the Board of Zoning Appeals to change their prior choices. After the residents were fruitless with the zoning board, they sought after cure in the Franklin County Common Pleas Court. Notwithstanding the court procedures, the natives looked for the consideration of the City Council in endeavor to protect the area by keeping the video store from being changed over into a McDonald's. On April 7, 1995, Brunner picked up a decision for her customers that in light of a legitimate concern for keeping away from traffic clog and person on foot perils, the McDonald's would not be permitted to assemble. The designer endeavored to bid the choice by getting companion of-the-court briefs from encompassing districts. The Franklin County Appeals Court upset the lower court administering clearing path for the development of the McDonald's. Brunner's customers spoke to the Ohio Supreme Court. In any case, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. A couple of different arguments against the designers stayed in some lower courts. In any case, these were ineffective.

The test fizzled. 

Brunner was engaged with a hanging chad discussion when in a 14,696-poll November 4, 1997 race in Licking County a pay charge issue which had bombed by four votes in this manner gone by thirteen on a November 26 programmed describe. Brunner was available for a court-requested second January 6 relate to assess whether chads remained hanging by one, two, or three pivots or whether they were adequately indented to tally. 

Brunner spoke to the Save The Doves Committee, an every living creature's common sense entitlement bunch that endeavored to boycott the chasing of grieving birds in Ohio by means of a tally activity. The gathering had recently endeavored to appeal to the state to have the pigeons expelled from the state diversion list. Ohio had some time ago had a background marked by ensuring grieving pigeons going back to 1917, yet chasing them was authorized beginning in 1995. The pigeons had an Ohio populace of 5 million and were lawful prey in 38 states. An ace chasing untamed life gathering, ineffectively tested the board of trustees' petitions. The real wording of the ticket issue, which turned into "No individual will take or chase a grieving bird," was argumentative. Some found the issue wording befuddling on the grounds that a "Yes" vote implied support for "No chasing". TV advertisements contradicting the vote issue additionally were fervently challenged. This issue was the main statewide issue on the 1998 tally. The boycott proposition fizzled. 

Brunner spoke to professional betting interests in an off-track wagering tally issue in Stark County. After the Canton City Council permitted another wagering parlor, the Stark County Board of Elections gridlocked along partisan loyalties on whether to permit a province wide choice against off-track wagering. Republican Secretary of State Taft, broke the tie permitting the submission on September 14. Brunner advanced the Board's choice to permit the voters the opportunity to overrule the city committee.

On different events, amid the race she got reasonable justification conclusions by the Ohio Elections Commission that there were indecencies in Taft's TV ads.

Amid a similar decision period, she spoke to Mark L. Mallory in a comparable promotion crusade fight when he unseated State Senator Janet Howard. In another battle promoting case, she spoke to Richard Cordray who charged his rival, Betty Montgomery with illegal tax avoidance of crusade publicizing reserves. Brunner felt Montgomery ought to have been excluded in the race. 

Brunner additionally spoke to a couple of judge competitors who were accused of unfortunate behavior amid the 1998 races. She had the capacity to get charges rejected against Judge Deborah P. O'Neill of Franklin County Common Pleas Court. In any case, a disciplinary board of the Ohio Supreme Court suggested Stark County Common Pleas judge hopeful Elizabeth Burick to pay a $5,000 fine for activities that "disparages the legal executive". 

In 1999, she spoke to a couple of people whose distributed decision related writing was tested. She spoke to Northland Mall proprietor in his endeavors to square subsidizing for streets to the arranged Polaris Fashion Place shopping center. Her customer had the capacity to get a tally issue put to contradict the unique financing. TV advertisement with respect to this issue were fervently challenged. The voters fizzled the proposition before the Franklin County examiners chose whether to take activities following the Ohio Election Commission's assurance that the advertisements were false. 

In one of her last cases in private practice, Brunner came back to speak to invested individuals in Bexley. In spite of the fact that she was battling for her own November 2000 race at the time, she spoke to an eatery in danger of losing its Sunday alcohol permit. Following quite a while of speaking to dubious gatherings in decisions issues, Brunner, a chief of Brunner, Kirby and Jeffries Co., ran a non-questionable crusade. Brunner, who was making her originally pursued elective position, restricted officeholder John F. Drinking spree who had been selected by Governor Taft in April 2000 to supplant the resigning James J. O'Grady. The race was the main challenged race in the general division of Franklin County Common Pleas Court. Amid the battle, Bender outpaced Brunner in gathering pledges by a $76,613 to $58,145 edge. 

In 2000, Brunner was chosen to an unexpired term on the Franklin County Common Pleas Court. She was reelected in 2002. The Court of Common Pleas passes judgment on tried, affirmed and made a different medication court to decrease enslavement related recidivism. Judges prescribe recurrent guilty parties who have been accused of peaceful lawful offenses coming from their medication or liquor addictions for the program, which focuses on those over and over accused of robbery, getting stolen property, composing terrible checks, prostitution or medication ownership, which are all fixation related wrongdoings. Brunner began the court in April 2004 following quite a long while of research. 

In December 2001, she affirmed a US$22 million settlement between Georgia-Pacific and 6,000 occupants that came about because of a 1985 and a 1997 blast. The settlement ended up disputable when a few occupants stayed uncompensated about a year later. She dealt with cases running from a medication related firebomb demise, a previous Columbus Division of Policeman's intramarital shooting and Interstate 71 expressway pursue, and an Ohio State University understudy Drive-by shooting passing, to a global abducting case, liquor administration suspensions, local maltreatment, a sex guilty party rights case, a government criminal case, and a state development contract case. After Brunner's May 30 administering in the agreement case, which included the Ohio School Facilities Commission and their $2 billion school development program, Ohio Governor Bob Taft constrained the commission to audit its agreements for a five-year retroactive period. Brunner had decided that a three-man commission survey contracts rather than simply the commission's chief, Randall Fischer. Roughly 1,800 contracts were explored. The tenth Ohio District Court of Appeals in Franklin County upset her decision. The Ohio State Supreme Court would not hear requests. In spite of having been upset, Brunner was upheld by the Ohio Inspector General who discovered morals infringement. Brunner was additionally engaged with a contention for imprisoning an attorney who she asserted was in scorn of court that brought about opinion piece page banter. 

Brunner left the Court on September 1, 2005 to keep running for Secretary of State. She ran unopposed in the May 2, 2006 Democratic Primary. On November 7, 2006, she crushed Republican Greg Hartmann in the 2006 general decision by a 55%Ã¢ÂÂ40% edge and got to work on January 8, 2007. Since the workplace is one that fills in as a manager of open records, the accounts of the two competitors' cautiousness against data fraud was a vital issue. The crusade additionally included mudslinging. She additionally gotten critical help from the Secretary of State Project, which "helped me toward the race". 

Ohio had grumblings of casting a ballot abnormalities in the 2000 and 2004 decisions. The state had hours-long queues at surveying places in its significant urban areas in 2004 and a misrepresentation outrage in Cuyahoga County, which incorporates Cleveland, that prompted the feelings of two decisions specialists on gear describes and Ms. Brunner's takeover of the region leading group of decisions. In September 2007, Brunner declared broad endeavors to recognize and address major issues with the security and unwavering quality of casting a ballot machines in time for the March 4, 2008 Ohio Democratic and Republican primaries. In a US$1.9 million governmentally financed investigation discharged December 14, 2007, Brunner detailed the consequences of trial of every one of the five casting a ballot frameworks utilized in Ohio. All frameworks had real defects. The investigation concentrated on security; dependability of the gear and the frameworks; the product arrangement; and strategies of the neighborhood authorities. Security and systems supposedly was not kidding issues. The security dimension of the PC gear did not coordinate the contemporaneous dimensions of security utilized in other data touchy enterprises. 

She has upheld the substitution of all Ohio casting a ballot machines, including the immediate account electronic (DRE) contact screen ones utilized in more than 50 of Ohio's 88 regions. Brunner bolsters a move to paper tickets, which would utilize optical checking. Because of the investigation, amid the March 2008 primaries, paper votes should be accessible at all surveying spots for voters who favored them. The paper votes likewise filled in as a reinforcement for machine disappointments. Brunner ordered a paper ticket race for the November 2008 general decision. This was expected both to the investigation and issues looked amid the 2007 race with contact screen electronic casting a ballot machines. Be that as it may, the Republican-controlled Ohio General Assembly has not tended to the subject of financing an all-paper vote. Thusly, Brunner focussed on tending to the methods rather than the innate absence of specialized security. 

In January 2007, Brunner proposed an arrangement that would enable areas to enroll survey laborers via mail, who might then attempt two paid preparing days, and work a paid eight-hour move at the surveys on Election Day. Brunner clarified the arrangement in a meeting: 

Regarding Ohio and what occurred in the 2004 presidential race, there has been an emergency in trust in our decision framework in Ohio, both broadly and in our state. One of the snappiest approaches to fix that is to ensure that we have satisfactory quantities of survey laborers. ... We proposed this as one device that the sheets of decisions would have accessible to them for selecting survey specialists. We would look do this like how we select members of the jury, just attendants are enrolled for about fourteen days of administration though we'd just request three days. It would likewise enable us to offer split movements to survey laborers. In Ohio the surveying places are open for thirteen hours, so basically a survey specialist works no less than fourteen hours; with the normal age of our survey laborers at 72, that is an intense day for anybody, regardless of what their age is. ... It's a choice, and we can even incorporate a trigger, with the goal that a province must be inadequate by a specific level of survey specialists to try and have the capacity to utilize this. 

In the underlying proposition it was not yet chosen what wages would be paid, and in the case of denying enrollment would result in punishments. The proposition will be chosen by the Ohio General Assembly. 

Brunner has built up the Voting Right Institute (VRI) to improve voter access to races in Ohio. The VRI has initiated a "Graduates Vote" program which supplies voter enlistment structures to all graduating secondary school seniors. The VRI has additionally joined forces with the U.S. Postal Service to incorporate voter enrollment frames in government moving bundles and with the Overseas Vote Foundation to improve online non-attendant vote applications for abroad and military voters. 

She has likewise moved to shield standardized savings data and other private data from general visibility for many online records and composed with the Ohio General Assembly to forestall the documenting of private data. 

Brunner worked with Ohio's 88 area sheets of races and a large number of survey specialists to guarantee record voter turnout in the March presidential primaries. In spite of the record turnout, the essential was defaced by paper poll deficiencies, bomb dangers, ice tempests and power disappointments. What's more, flooding constrained the movement of some surveying spots in southeastern Ohio. 21 areas in the Cleveland metropolitan territory were held open for an additional hour and a half because of paper poll deficiencies. Brunner guaranteed that in Clermont and Summit Counties tickets ran out in view of the quantity of Republicans who casted a ballot in the Democratic essential and that just Democratic polls ran out. 

Brunner has taken a stand in opposition to decision authorities taking casting a ballot machines home with them in the days prior to a race. Such activities could permit hacking despite the fact that it makes transport and conveyance to the inevitable surveying place more straightforward. A few decisions authorities state they feel the framework is better if races authorities watch out for machines the days prior to the races. Brunner says survey specialists have here and there cast polls on machines in their homes. She issued the accompanying mandate on the issue: "We need Ohio's voters and the remainder of the country to see that we have arranged a straightforward procedure of transporting casting a ballot gear, tallies and supplies. That starts with security rehearses at sheets of races and surveying places, archived chain of care, and now techniques to make secure casting a ballot machine conveyance." She has requested bipartisan transport groups and banished stockpiling conditions, for example, mugginess. The central government will finance the expense of her command. 

In 2008 Ohio encountered a unintended outcome of another resolution that brought about a short time of cover casting a ballot, when non-attendant casting a ballot has begun and before the end of voter enrollment. This period kept running from September 30 until October 6, due to the recently established early casting a ballot approach. On August 13, 2008, Brunner requested province race board authorities to build up techniques to empower voters who register to be promptly issued a truant vote. Since a voter could appear with just a phone charge, give any four digits and case they were the last four digits of his or her Social Security Number, and after that quickly vote and have such tickets put into a similar pool as different votes with no system for progressively thorough investigation of their legitimacy, the Republican Party contradicted that day casting a ballot plan and battled it in a few Ohio Courts. Ohio Republican Party authorities and Republican voters contended in discrete claims that Ohio law expects voters to be enlisted for 30 days before they cast a truant ticket. On September 29, 2008 (multi day after lower state and government courts overruled GOP complaints to same-day enrollment and casting a ballot or GOP demands for commanded ticket isolation and confirmation) the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, Ohio rejected Republican endeavors to stop the arrangement. US area court judge James Gwin in Cleveland, Ohio additionally governed against the Republicans and issued a limiting request to authorize Brunner's arrangement. In Columbus, Ohio, U.S. Area Judge George Smith declined to administer on another statewide test, conceding to the state Supreme Court's choice. The decisions, which opened a window to enlist and cast a ballot around the same time until the non-attendant vote due date on October 6, 2008, was maintained by the Ohio Supreme Court in a 4-3 choice in which two Republican legal scholars who were on the November 2008 tally recused themselves and were supplanted by one Republican and one Democrat by Chief Justice Thomas Moyer. The typical program of Ohio Supreme Court law specialists is all Republican and the solitary Democrat substitution, William H. Wolff Jr., make the tie-breaking choice. The dissidents noticed that Ohio's Constitution necessitates that an individual register to cast a ballot 30 days in before casting a ballot. Brunner requested isolation of same-day-enlistment tickets and check of them before tallying them on Election Day, November 4, 2008. In related procedures on September 30, 2008, Judge Smith of The U.S. Area Court for the Southern District of Ohio in Columbus hosted allowed an Ohio Republican Gathering demand for a limiting request that would order decision spectators amid early casting a ballot. Brunner won in the re-appraising court which decided that the locale court "mishandled its carefulness" in giving the limiting request. 

That day enrollment tickets are liable to the standard Ohio notice card convention whereby a postcard is sent to the recently enlisted location to help with deciding the legitimacy of the location. A card that returns stamped come back to sender is addressed and set apart on the voter rolls. Moreover, the sheets of races submit new voter enlistments into a database in the workplace of the Ohio Secretary of State. The data is coordinated with driver's licenses on an Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles database and falling flat a match there it is sent to the Social Security Administration to seek after a match. 

Ohio (alongside Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina) is one of six states expected to be intensely influenced by consistence with the 2002 Help America Vote Act, which commands that states validate voter enlistment applications with government databases. Because of the lopsided voter enrollment by Democrats it is foreseen that a significant part of the disarray at the surveying spots will be for difficulties to recently enlisted Democrats who have been delisted from the positions of enrolled voters. 

It gives the idea that Ohio is utilizing standardized savings data to confirm new voter enrollment, despite the fact that "[u]nder government law, race authorities should utilize the Social Security database to check an enlistment application just if all else fails, if no record of the candidate is found [within the state's own] databases," as indicated by a "New York Times" article. Michael J. Astrue, chief of the Social Security Administration, cautioned the United States Department of Justice and sent letters to six states including Ohio to guarantee consistence with government law. Brunner has expressed that the documenting of administrative work by Republican authorities might be an endeavor to set up reason for challenging tallies on Election Day. The administrative work requires utilization of temporary tallies by people with discrepant enlistments. On October 9, 2008, the Republicans additionally were conceded a request against Brunner by Judge Smith requiring that Brunner must perform voter enrollment check as indicated by the Help America Vote Act. Coordinating new registrants' data against Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles or the Social Security Administration databases is one of the necessities. Difficulties to bungled enrollments, which constrain the utilization of temporary tallies, must be documented twenty days before the decision. Lawful master Greta Van Susteren saw the decision as a critical breaking news story and talked with Brunner on her show "On the Record w/Greta Van Susteren" the day it was made. Van Susteren translated the decision as an explanation that Brunner has not been finding a way to counteract voter misrepresentation. "Majority rules system Now!" additionally talked with Brunner on that day, yet they did as such before the last decision. 

Between January 1, 2008 and mid-October 2008, more than 666,000 Ohioans enrolled to cast a ballot either out of the blue or with refreshed voter data, and more than 200,000 of them gave driver's licenses or Social Security numbers that don't coordinate government records. Over 20% of these voters are from Cuyahoga County, which is intensely Democratic. Likewise, a significant number of the recently enrolled voters were the consequence of voter enlistment drives to enlist voters for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for the March 4, 2008 Ohio Democratic essential. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in a 9-6 choice, ruled against Brunner on October 14, 2008 in choosing that additional means must be taken to confirm these registrants and Jeffrey Sutton's greater part conclusion recommended that these misregistered voters cast temporary tallies. Generally, 20% of temporary tallies have been tossed out. Because of the decision, Brunner's Office of the Ohio Secretary of State must furnish every district with a rundown of registrants with befuddling data and give guidance on an appropriate game-plan. There are government laws banning cleansing voters from the race moves inside 90 days of a race. This issue is viewed as a factional one with Republicans favoring more prominent investigation, and the judges casted a ballot nearly along partisan loyalties dependent on the United States President that delegated them. 

On October 17, 2008, in Brunner v. Ohio Republican Party, 07A332, the United States Supreme Court toppled the sixth Circuit Decision requiring Brunner to give arrangements of inappropriately enlisted voters to every area race board. The decision implies that Brunner can train the 88 region sheets of races to disregard open record demands by the Ohio Republican Party made to challenge registrants with data befuddled between their enlistment and their driver's permit or government managed savings number. The Republican Party asserted that the decision depended on a detail as opposed to the benefits of the contentions. Bennett said that "The judges did not differ with our contention that Jennifer Brunner has neglected to consent to government race law. They simply said we don't reserve a privilege to bring a private test against her under this specific arrangement." The McCain-Palin crusade said "...the United States Supreme Court does not address infringement of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) by Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner. Or maybe, the Court decided that Congress had likely not approved private people or ideological groups to bring suit under the segment of HAVA requiring voter enrollment confirmation through information coordinating." Since the decision did not legitimately address the issues that the Republicans needed decided, they documented a comparable case in the Ohio Supreme Court. In any case, they pulled back the case. 

One month before the 2008 United States race, 5% of Ohio contracts were either seriously reprobate or in dispossession. There were 67,658 abandonment activities in the main portion of 2008. An article in "The New York Times" implied that Republicans may endeavor to utilize abandonment records to square voters. Brunner cautioned all race sheets that contribution in a dispossession isn't, without anyone else's input, adequate reason for testing liberation. 

On entering office, Brunner made quick move against Republican region races authorities, including Robert T. Bennett, Ohio Republican Party Chairman. At the time, while composing for "The Cincinnati Enquirer", feature writer Peter Bronson depicted Brunner as "the most factional state official in Ohio". All the more as of late, she has been blamed for partisanship by her previous Secretary of State rival in the 2008 general decision. He asserts that she set strategy so as to toss out truant polls liable to be thrown for the John McCain-Sarah Palin ticket. The Ohio State Supreme Court bolstered the Republican contention. Different sources guarantee that ACORN prompts and impacts Brunner. 

The 2008 general decision was relied upon to be defaced by Diebold electronic casting a ballot machines that had failed on vote exchanges from the neighborhood area machines to the district race board home office. Brunner is suing Diebold for different kinds of vote-dropping breakdowns. Fifty-three of eighty-eight provinces utilized the risky touch screen electronic casting a ballot machines. The machines had likewise bafflingly smashed and their printers had stuck in the 2007 races. Brunner feels that electronic machines ought to be stayed away from until they accomplish indistinguishable security principles from the PC gear in the banking and interchanges enterprises. She issued a report that both Premier Election Solutions (a Diebold backup) and Hart and Election Systems and Software produce electronic casting a ballot frameworks with extreme security imperfections. 

Brunner has tried a few explicit endeavors to lighten a portion of the past casting a ballot troubles. 2008 was the primary Ohio decision that grants truant casting a ballot as an issue of inclination with no support for need. This brought about a record number of non-attendant tickets. Moreover, casting a ballot machine redistribution has been firmly considered with the expectation of lightening long holds up in issue regions. Redistribution depends on past turnout, new enrollments, any ongoing cleanses under the National Voter Registration Act, and the quantity of vote issues in the area. Every region has been provided with adequate paper tallies to suit 25% number of voters who casted a ballot in the past presidential decision. 

Brunner has noticed that just detained sentenced criminals become ineligible to cast a ballot in Ohio. Accordingly, people imprisoned for offenses and people kept in detainment facilities anticipating new preliminaries can cast a ballot straightforwardly from jail. 

In fall of 2008, Brunner was tested in a couple of cases including the Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless. In September, in Project Vote (in the interest of Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless) v. Madison County Board of Elections, No. 1:08-cv-02266 (N.D. Ohio), Judge Garvin charged the Madison County Board of 

Races from holding fast to its September 5 declaration that it would neglect Secretary Brunner's orders to issue a truant ticket to any individual who has not as of now been enlisted for 30 days. The Board had compromised an activity that the judge decided would disregard Section 202 of the Voting Rights Act making hopeless damage 

enrolled voters will's identity unfit to get truant polls. On October 27, 2008 for the situation The Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless v. Brunner, Case No. C206- 

896, U.S. Locale Judge Edmund Sargus decided that working together with Ohio Revised Code ÃÂ§ 3503.02(I) which states: "If an individual does not have a fixed spot of home, yet has an asylum or other area at which the individual has been a steady or customary occupant and to which the individual has the goal of restoring, that cover or other area will be esteemed the individual's living arrangement to register to cast a ballot." The request ordered that Brunner as Secretary of State "teach the County Boards of Elections that temporary votes may not be rejected for neglecting to list a structure address on the temporary vote envelope if the voter dwells at an area that does not have a location." This decision expresses that all Ohio areas must permit destitute voters use non-building areas, for example, park seats as their addresses. In the meantime, the court decided that survey specialist blunder is anything but a legitimate motivation to dismiss a temporary ticket. "Time" said that these decisions acquired consistency dealing with temporary tickets to the regions that did not already exist. 

On October 20, 2008 Brunner needed to briefly closed down the Ohio Secretary of State site after it was hacked. The offense was set under the locale of the Ohio State Highway Patrol.
