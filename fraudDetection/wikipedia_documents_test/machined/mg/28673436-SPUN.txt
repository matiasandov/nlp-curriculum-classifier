Stephen Lekapenos 

Stephen Lekapenos or Lecapenus (; kicked the bucket 18 April 963) was the second child of the Byzantine ruler Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920Ã¢ÂÂ944), and co-sovereign from 924 to 945. With his more youthful sibling Constantine, he ousted Romanos I in December 944, yet was toppled and banished by the real sovereign Constantine VII (r. 913Ã¢ÂÂ959) half a month later. Stephen experienced his life in a state of banishment on the island of Lesbos, where he kicked the bucket on Easter 963. 

Stephen was the second child of Romanos I and his significant other Theodora. His more seasoned kin were Christopher (co-ruler from 921 until his demise in 931) and his sisters Helena, who wedded Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913Ã¢ÂÂ959), and Agatha, who wedded Romanos Argyros. His more youthful siblings were Constantine (co-sovereign 924Ã¢ÂÂ945) and Theophylact (Patriarch of Constantinople in 933Ã¢ÂÂ956). He most likely additionally had somewhere around two anonymous more youthful sisters, known simply because of their relational unions to the "magistroi" Romanos Mosele and Romanos Saronites. 

Romanos Lekapenos had ascended to control in 919, when he had figured out how to delegate himself official over the youthful Constantine VII and wed his little girl Helena to him. Inside a year, he progressively ascended from "basileopator" to "Caesar", and was in the long run delegated senior sovereign on 17 December 920. To merge his hang on power, and with a perspective on replacing the decision Macedonian tradition with his very own family, he brought up his oldest child Christopher to co-ruler in May 921, while Stephen and Constantine were broadcasted co-heads on 25 December 924. 

Following Christopher's initial passing in 931, and given Constantine VII's "true" sidelining, Stephen and Constantine expected an expanded noticeable quality, albeit formally despite everything they positioned after their brother by marriage in the school of rulers. In 933, Stephen was hitched to Anna, the little girl of a certain Gabalas, who was delegated "Augusta" on a similar event. The couple had one known child, Romanos. As per the eleventh century recorder George Kedrenos, he was mutilated in 945, yet later turned into a "sebastophoros". 

Stephen and Constantine Lekapenos went to the fore in 943, when they restricted a dynastic marriage for their nephew, Romanos II. Their dad needed to have his oldest enduring grandson hitched to Euphrosyne, a girl of his effective general John Kourkouas. Albeit such an association would viably concrete the dedication of the military, it would likewise reinforce the situation of the authentic Macedonian line, spoken to by Romanos II and his dad Constantine VII, over the supreme cases of Romanos' own children. Typically, Stephen and Constantine contradicted this choice, and swayed their dad, who was at this point sick and old, to reject Kourkouas in the fall of 944. Romanos II rather wedded Bertha, an ill-conceived girl of Hugh of Arles, King of Italy, who changed her name to Eudokia after her marriage. 

With Romanos I moving toward an amazing finish, the matter of his progression wound up earnest. In 943, Romanos drafted a will which would leave Constantine VII as the senior sovereign after his demise. This significantly disturbed his two children, who expected that their brother by marriage would have them ousted and constrain them to take ascetic pledges. Propelled, in the feeling of Steven Runciman, incompletely without anyone else safeguarding and somewhat from certified aspiration, they began intending to catch control through an overthrow d'ÄÅ¡tat, with Stephen obviously the instigator and Constantine a fairly hesitant accomplice. 

Their kindred schemers included Marianos Argyros, the "protospatharios" Basil Peteinos, Manuel Kourtikes, the "strategos" Diogenes, Clado, and Philip. Kedrenos, in any case, considers Peteinos to have filled in as an operator of Constantine VII among the plotters. On 20 December 944, the backstabbers get their arrangements under way. The two siblings carried their supporters in the Great Palace of Constantinople amid the late morning break in castle exercises. They at that point drove their men into the assembly of Romanos I, where they effectively caught the "evil elderly person". They had the capacity to transport him to the closest harbor and from that point to Prote, one of the Princes' Islands and a well known spot of outcast. There, Romanos consented to take religious promises and resign from the position of royalty. 

Having figured out how to discreetly dismiss their dad, the siblings currently needed to manage Constantine VII. Sadly for them, bits of gossip before long spread around Constantinople, such that, following Romanos' statement, Constantine VII's life was in risk. A little while later, swarms accumulated before the royal residence, requesting to see their ruler face to face. The contemporary Lombard student of history Liutprand of Cremona takes note of that the ministers and agents from Amalfi, Gaeta, Rome, and Provence present in the capital likewise upheld Constantine VII. Stephen and his sibling needed to surrender to the inescapable, perceiving their brother by marriage as the senior head. 

The new triumvirate went on for around 40 days. The three rulers before long delegated new pioneers for the military administrations. Bardas Phokas the Elder was delegated as the new Domestic of the Schools, and Constantine Gongyles as leader of the Byzantine naval force. Stephen and his sibling figured out how to compensate their kindred plotters. Peteinos moved toward becoming "patrikios" and Great Hetaeriarch, Argyros was delegated Count of the Stable, Kourtikes a "patrikios" and "droungarios" of the Watch. On 26 January 945, be that as it may, at the encouraging of their sister, the "Augusta" Helena, another overthrow expelled the two Lekapenoi from power and reestablished the sole magnificent specialist to Constantine VII. 

At first, the two siblings were sent to Prote. The Byzantine recorders have their dad inviting them by citing an entry from the Book of Isaiah, explicitly Chapter 1.2: "Hear, O sky, and give ear, O earth; for Jehovah hath spoken: I have sustained and raised youngsters, and they have defied me." Liutprand of Cremona, notwithstanding, gives a marginally extraordinary record, having Romanos get his children with severe mockery, expressing gratitude toward them for not dismissing him and imploring them to pardon the priests for their obliviousness on the most proficient method to appropriately get sovereigns. Before long, be that as it may, Stephen was proceeded onward to a jail at Prokonnesos, and after that to Rhodes, before at last settling in Methymna, Lesbos. 

A plot by certain individuals from the supreme government to reestablish him was found in December 947 and the backstabbers mangled and openly mortified. Stephen kicked the bucket at Methymna on Easter Sunday (18 April), 963. John Skylitzes claims that Stephen was harmed by request of the Empress Theophano as a feature of her endeavors to secure the rights to the position of authority of her children Basil II and Constantine VIII, by disposing of other conceivable inquirers to the royal position. It should, notwithstanding, be noticed that few passings of the all-encompassing majestic family at the time are credited to Theophano by antagonistic sources, as a rule by toxin.
