During the 1980s, remixing was as yet another idea and innovation, by which a specific vocal expression could be unendingly duplicated, rehashed, hacked up, transposed all over in pitch and give them more reverberation, resonation, treble or bass. Madonna ended up intrigued by the idea, taking note of that she detested when others remixed her melodies and needed to do it independent from anyone else. 

Madonna swung to her old companion and maker John "Jellybean" Benitez to help her remix the melodies, and furthermore enrolled the assistance of Patrick Leonard, the maker of "Good 'ol fashioned". The blends on "You Can Dance" showed various run of the mill blending procedures. Instrumental entries were extended to expand the ideal opportunity for moving, which undermined the more tightly structure of the first pop tune. Vocal expressions were rehashed and exposed to different echoes, panned over the stereophonic sound outlets. At specific focuses, no music is heard aside from the drums and at different occasions, the drums are expelled with just the hello cap left to keep time.

After its discharge, "You Can Dance" got commonly positive surveys from pundits, some of whom noticed how the definitely realized tunes appeared to them in a total new structure, considering it a fundamental collection to be played at gatherings.

"Spotlight" was the main single discharged from the collection in Japan, however diagrammed on the airplay outlines of "Board" because of radio play and crested at number 32. 

In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records charged the arrival of "You Can Dance"Ã¢ÂÂMadonna's first retrospectiveÃ¢ÂÂwhich was gone for the move fragment of her gathering of people. It was a collection containing seven of Madonna's melodies in remixed design, which was as yet a progressive idea during the 1980s. By the mid-eighties, post-disco move music was amazingly famous and the idea of remix was generally viewed as another bearing of music. A few specialists were remixing their tracks and assembling them to make new collections. Blending was an interpretative procedure, where the craftsman was normally included, however the advancement was for the most part cared for the record maker. The distinctive pieces of a melody, including the lead vocals, foundation vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machineÃ¢ÂÂall experienced the way toward blending to sound impressively unique in relation to their unique partner. Blending decided how boisterous these instruments were going to sound in connection to one another and what specific audio effects ought to be added to each instrument. Upgrades in studio advances implied the likelihood of forming the sound of a tune in any capacity, after it has been recorded. The game plans were itself made at the blending stage, instead of being made beforehand. A specific vocal expression could be interminably replicated, rehashed, cleaved up, transposed all over in pitch and give them more reverberation, resonation, treble or bass. 

It was this idea which captivated Madonna, while she was building up her third studio collection "Good 'ol fashioned" (1986). She stated, "I abhor it when individuals do ace blends of my records. I would prefer not to hear my tunes changed that way. I don't have a clue about that I like it, individuals screwing with my records. The jury is out on it for me. Be that as it may, the fans like it, and extremely, this one was for the fans, for the children in the clubs who needed to hear these melodies in a new manner." She went to Warner with discharging her tunes by remixing them in a total move tune. From Warner's perspective, the ascent of remix was a business shelter, since it implied making more cash out of a similar bit of music. Rather than paying Madonna to go to studio and record distinctive tracks, they found that enabling her to record similar tracks in various configurations was substantially less exorbitant. Subsequently they chose to discharge the collection, however gave full opportunity to Madonna to pick the makers with whom she needed to build up the remixes. 

Madonna swung to her old companion and maker John "Jellybean" Benitez to help her remixing the tunes, and furthermore enrolled the assistance of Patrick Leonard, the maker of "Honest to goodness". Together they picked six of Madonna's old tunes and chose to give it a remixed structure. The tunes picked were "Occasion", "Everyone" and "Physical Attraction" from "Madonna" (1983), "Into the Groove" and "Again and again" from "Like a Virgin" (1984), and finally, "Where's the Party" from "Honest to goodness". Alongside the pre-discharged tracks, an at no other time discharged tune called "Spotlight" was incorporated as a little something extra. Madonna said that she was motivated by the melody "Everyone Is a Star" (1970), by American musical gang Sly and the Family Stone. Composed by Madonna, Stephen Bray and Curtis Hudson, "Spotlight" was initially recorded amid the "Good 'ol fashioned" recording sessions. It was discarded from the collection since Madonna felt that it was comparable in organization and structure to "Occasion". 

After the remixing of the melodies began, Benitez noted, "We settled on essential inquiries like 'How boisterous should the drums be? What amount should the vocals emerge?' These are inventive choices which will change the completed bit of music." Shep Pettibone, one of the makers of the collection remarked that "ordinarily, without some music to chip away at, the remixer has nothing. Be that as it may, we previously had Madonna's list of danceable tunes which was sufficient material for lifetime." The blends on "You Can Dance" showed various average blending procedures. Instrumental entries were protracted to expand the ideal opportunity for moving, which undermined the more tightly structure of the first pop melody. Vocal expressions were rehashed and exposed to various echoes, panned over the stereophonic sound outlets. At specific focuses, no music is heard aside from the drums and at others, the drums are evacuated with just the hello there cap left to keep time. 

The collection spread meant Madonna's proceeded with interest with Spanish culture and style. She wore a female toreador outfit with a frilly bustier, weaved bolero coat and a cummerbund with a flouncy clamor. Jeri Heiden, who had taken a shot at the spread workmanship for "Honest to goodness", was given the undertaking of altering the photographs and showing up in a collection spread. Shot by Herb Ritts, the spread indicated Madonna again as a bleach fair. Heiden clarified in a meeting with "Opening" magazine in October 2006 that the spread was not intended to be a connect to the "Good 'ol fashioned" spread. "It was only Madonna's take a gander at the timeÃ¢Â Ã¢ÂÂ Platinum Blond. What's more, obviously the penmanship returns on that collection." The collection sleeve incorporated a free notice and the gold fold over liner notes contained surmised running time to demonstrate the contrast between the length of the remix and the first track. Brian Chin, a "Moving Stone" writer, composed the liner notes for the collection, clarifying the procedure of remix and why the seven tunes were picked for the track list. 

As per Rikky Rooksby, creator of "The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna", "Upgrades in studio innovation implied that potential outcomes for molding the sound after it has been recorded are practically boundless." Such plausibility were connected in the tune structure and the remixes present in "You Can Dance". Beforehand to change the sound of an instrument, or to hop starting with one sound then onto the next, chronicles used to quit playing the instrument and the drums by then. Be that as it may, for the remixes on "You Can Dance", the blur building innovation was connected to the melodies, wherein the fader was basically pulled down, and was pushed up again when the sound of the instruments were made to come up to the surface. The principal tune on the collection is "Spotlight" which starts with the sound of drums, bass synths and handclaps, trailed by Madonna articulating the words "Spotlight, sparkle splendid". After the primary section, the sound of console is heard amid the ensemble. It proceeds with like this during that time refrain, which is trailed by a break including vocal echoes, a piano fragment and violin phrases. Madonna pursues the music played by the piano and expresses the words "Dad da-dad da pappa dad" in a similar song. The verses manage Madonna influencing the audience to recall that "everyone is a star" and that on the off chance that one needs to be well known and be under the "spotlight", the individual ought to sing about it and reality may make up for lost time with the person in question. As indicated by the sheet music for the tune, is set in the time mark of basic time, with a rhythm of 100 beats for every moment. It is set in the key of F major with Madonna's voice spreading over from the notes of C to B. "Spotlight" has a fundamental grouping of AmÃ¢ÂÂCÃ¢ÂÂAmÃ¢ÂÂCÃ¢ÂÂGÃ¢ÂÂF as its harmony movement. 

The second track is "Occasion", which Benitez said that he constantly needed to remix, remarking "There are new sounds on the 1987 remix [of 'Holiday'], however it had a furrow that required no improvement." The sound of the guitar is conveyed to the front in the remix, with a piano break and a center area comprising of rhythms. The blend for "Everyone" begins with four redundancies of the vocal guide and after that moves into a musicality focused game plan. Like "Occasion", the center area of "Everyone" includes a drum break, with a synth tune backing it up. "Dance" is reverberated and backed off consistently through the break, bit by bit changing into the intermedia section. At the very end, the drums are hauled out, leaving Madonna rehashing the "get up and do your thing" expression, which floats over to the introduction of the following tune "Physical Attraction". It starts with the game plan of the first tune, until the center eight, where the creation is changed. An unsettling sound is available toward the finish of the track, which, after at some point increments in volume up to that point next track "Again and again" starts. In the "Into the Groove" remix, overdubs are available with the constant redundancy of the expression "c'mon". The main refrain does not begin until around ninety seconds into the remix. After the principal "Now I realize you're mine" line is sung, there is a percussion break, and reiteration of the expressions "venture to the beat" and "c'mon". The keep going section fuses resounding on the vocals, causing cover of the expressions. The remix closes with instrumentation from congas, whistles and timbales, giving it a Mexican consummation. 

Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that "["You Can Dance"] keeps the focus on her first record, including non-LP singles like 'Into the Groove' for good measure, alongside a reward track of 'Where's the Party'. Since it is a move collection, it doesn't make a difference that 'Occasion' and 'Into the Groove' are here twice, when each in name forms, in light of the fact that the basic sections and music are very extraordinary in every manifestation. The facts demonstrate that a portion of this presently sounds datedÃ¢ÂÂthese are obviously broadened blends from the mid 80sÃ¢ÂÂbut that is a piece of its appeal, and everything holds together great. Not fundamental, yet fun." In "The Village Voice", Robert Christgau thought about that "the impacts, rehashes, breaks, and segues included by a star team of remixers [...] sum to new musicÃ¢ÂÂthis time the melodies don't surface, they connect and snatch you". He additionally contended that "You Can Dance" reminded the group of onlookers that before MTV, they "adored the way she "sounded"". Creator J. Randy Taraborrelli noticed that ""You Can Dance" made one point obvious about Madonna. While she was advancing into a genuine pop star, musically despite everything she realized how to have the best get-together." He complimented the remixed adaptations of "Occasion", "Everyone", "Physical Attraction" and "Into the Groove". 

Timothy Green from "The Miami Herald" said that "[The collection has] got a decent beat and you can move to it. Madonna's new collection isn't generally new, yet rather a gathering of danceable hits, remixed by club disk jockeys astonishing at that exceptional specialty of taking the craftsmen's work, track by track, and recreating it. Most such remixes become 12-inch move singles, and "You Can Dance", is essentially a gathering of these. The remixes sound crisp and gives another point of view toward the officially renowned and prevalent melodies." However, Daniel Brogan from a similar paper lauded the collection, saying that "Madonna has conveyed another bliss to the general population purchasing presents for Christmas, as "You Can Dance" is an exciting, quick paced review that will consume the move floor till New Year."
